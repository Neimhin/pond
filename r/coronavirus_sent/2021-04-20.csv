0,I lived in NC and couldn't get smoke for 6 months.
1,Decided to move to a legal state so that wouldn't happen again.
2,We are at more than half of adults with at least one shot.
3,"We also have one state where more than half of the total population has at least one shot (NH) and another 5 states that are 48%+ (CT, ME, MA, VT, NM)."
4,Yes!
5,Astra is manufactured in Argentina and then sent to Mexico to complete the process.
6,A lot

8,&gt; Why hasn’t one of the worlds largest economies built domestic vaccine production?
9,Because you can't do it overnight.
10,Canada drew up plans to make covid vaccines domestically last summer and it may start rolling out vaccines this fall.
11,"Well, that's wrong"
12,Yep..
13,"Unfortunately, some people just confirmed my pre-pandemic (judgry) opinion."
14,Should let your kids choose the college lol
15,"If there is no difference, why do they not go ahead and fully approve the vaccines?"
16,"To elaborate, I was stopped at stop lights with cars in front of me, so I had nowhere to go."
17,"I could be wrong, but I believe that seeing an incoming collision can cause you to tense up before contact, which can actually make your injuries worse."

29,"&gt; The sooner everyone gets vaccinated the sooner shit will be opened back up and masks will go away

yeah and the CDC needs to be more explicit about that rather than more of this ""the worst is yet to come"" bullshit."
30,"The messaging so far has entirely been more hunker down, mask up, keep social distancing even after you've been vaccinated, with zero indication of the endgame."
31,"It's fine waiting until a certain threshold has been vaccinated (or more appropriately, until a certain threshold has vaccinations *available* to them if they want it imo), but that messaging needs to be much more clear."
32,There is.
33,Its already pretty hard for an average Indian to get any visa to the US.
34,You need  to prove you won't try to stay or be in a situation where it's clear you won't.
35,Or get a work visa sponsored which recently has become really hard to impossible.
36,"Whops, I mean Doug Ford."
37,I just can't believe this is the one who doesn't smoke crack.
38,We really should ban the export of vaccines to countries that themselves have a blanket ban (de jure or de facto) on the export of them.
39,"I'm fine with exporting vaccines, even if production issues cause deliveries to the EU to be cut (as long as deliveries are cut by an equal percentage everywhere) but only if the recipient country allows exports themselves or does not have any production capacity themselves."
40,"&gt; But if the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting or transmitting the virus


It DOES stop you from getting infected or transmitting."
41,To say otherwise is dishonest.
42,Put drive-through vaccinations at every fast food drive-through.
43,"Put nurses in front of grocery stores ready to give out shots as you enter and hand out 20% off coupons (ID req'd to prevent idiots from getting 20 shots, of course)."
44,"Once we can get rid of appointments, and put vaccines where people are rather than making people come to vaccines, I bet we can get another ~20% of the population."
45,"Those studies say statistically significant, but marginal."
46,Not exactly strong data.
47,"People wearing them in TX aren't doing so under a mandate, tho."
48,Where did you see a gender mentioned?
49,"“Most adults are vaccinated”

Currently only 26% of Americans 16+ are fully vaccinated according to:


https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html"
50,But you have free healthcare though!!!!
51,How great is that
52,"The 40+ was only to use up the remaining AZ vaccine though, 40+ aren't getting Pfizer/moderna yet"
53,Same reasoning.
54,Itll be nice when its a choice and not a necessity
55,No of course not lol.
56,"But I'm not confident I personally have the resources to figure out who the next Patient Zero is, so everyone's suspect as far as I'm concerned - which isn't very far, I mean, its a silly mask, I'm hardly scrubbing my skin bloody or something"
57,"I am patiently waiting for the day when I'll no longer have to wear a mask indoors, period."
58,"I'm doing it now out of obedience, not by choice."

65,Are you really walking around expecting to be patient zero?
66,You should absolutely be watching your mirrors though...
67,"Just going after high fructose corn syrup and unhealthy foods isn’t enough, just like the reduction in smoking wasn’t just from coming down hard on tobacco companies."
68,"Doctors, public health officials, and others have been telling people for years to quit smoking - what happens when they equivalently tell people to quit being fat?"
69,That’s “fat shaming”.
70,"Smokers have been exiled out of buildings and into little bus-station huts 100 feet from the doors, to smoke outside in the rain or cold."
71,Is there an equivalent to making obese people get told to eat outside?
72,"Obviously those are extreme examples, but the point is that a LOT of the reduction in smoking was from making smoking much more socially unacceptable than it once was, and putting pressure on smokers *themselves* to quit (or not start)."
73,The same pressure has to be put on obese people themselves to make the change.
74,YIKES.

77,"Why call it a ""ploy""?"
78,No one is trying to deceive anyone.
79,It's a very plainly marketed incentivization.
80,Like.
81,That's the whole point.
82,"In fairness, it says ""safe"", which means you won't get food-borne illness (assuming it was stored properly)."
83,"Beef, pork, and lamb we know have a very, very small risk of food-borne illness as long as the exterior is cooked."
84,"As long as the FDA isn't requiring restaurants to cook meat to their safe temperatures, whatever."
85,Admittedly it would be nice if they added some nuance to safe vs. effectively safe for healthy people.
86,At least it would stop kids from being served rubber for 16 years for those parents who always cook to FDA guidelines.
87,will check them out too.
88,thank you.
89,I was really traumatized for years after getting them on a trip to NYC.

125,And do you also get the lovely experience of those same people coming in to see you and complaining that masks are just too hard to work around and they can’t breathe so they’re just going to keep it on their chin after the fifteenth time you’ve told them to pull it back up?

166,Less than 6000 americans have gotten covid since getting vaccinated.
167,6000 out of 84 MILLION vaccinated.
168,That's a massive reduction in cases.
169,No one ever thought that it would prevent 100 percent of cases unless they don't know how vaccines work.
170,"They work to decrease the amount of cases and deaths, and strain hospitals."
171,"Covid isn't going away, but the vaccines are proven by actual real world data to bring it to manageable levels."

188,"Yes, that was a factor in the consideration but my doctor also believed I’m at risk NOT to do well with Covid and he believed the antibodies would drop off eventually if I didn’t get a boost to that initial shot."
189,"He did tell me that two weeks after the Pfizer shot, I could relax about Covid for the most part."
190,Why in the world Schlesvig-Holstein did not change its name after the WWII I still try to comprehend that...
191,"I just had my second Moderna shot on Friday, I noticed immediately after both shots, my face got flushed but I was also making myself nervous while waiting (I had the 30 min wait as well)."
192,"Got the shot at 2:30, felt fine until 8:30 that night when the exhaustion knocked me out haha."
193,"Woke up Saturday, just felt very tired, no energy, sore arm/back, headache."
194,That lasted basically the entire day.
195,Sunday I felt about 80% better.
196,I still feel a little drained today but my experience was definitely better than a lot that I’ve read in other places.
197,If we can't get to herd immunity via vaccination then it seems like we'll get there naturally.
198,"Unless herd immunity is also being defined as ""covid going extinct."""
199,"I'm more supportive of safety measures than most people I know, but once everyone has a chance to get the vaccine I'm headed back for normal life."

202,My friends who are in their 20’s and 30’s are all getting vaccinated.
203,The problem is rural folks and black folks in urban areas aren’t getting vaccinated.
204,They will need to make a special effort to reach out to them.
205,Poverty and lack of education leads to people relying on Facebook kooks and YouTube doctors to give them misleading information

227,"But they can't, because they're DEAD"
228,"Thanks, yeah I gotta believe in it."
229,Some research in that area would be nice to have.
230,"I found exactly one thing directly measuring a multi-part vaccine response in nonsmokers vs regular weed smokers, smoking 4 joints during each shot."
231,"That one found no significant difference in the antibody responses between the two groups, but that's not much data and it was for the Hep B vaccine, not covid."
232,When the US finishes vaccination and we start exporting (hopefully Bc otherwise would be massive idiocy) I bet a lot of countries could speed up their timelines
233,I just don't see it happening like that.

251,It varies in intensity but doesn't go away.
252,I started searching what might cause this and it seems there could be some link between this symptom and covid and or covid vaccinations.
253,I haven't have covid that I know of but did get my first vaccine dose 2 weeks ago.
254,Its lightweight freaking me out because I use my ears to earn a living.
255,ANyone came across any research on this or has anyone else experienced this side effect post vaccination?

264,Many nurse practitioners have a doctorate degree.
265,Thanks.
266,It is only from the 28th of April.
267,But I am not very happy about it.
268,Cases are very high and hospitals are very busy.
269,"I am all for letting restrictions go, but what they are currently doing is not great."
270,They are letting go of restrictions while cases are rising with the assumption cases are currently peaking and will drop off soon.
271,Why not just wait until you know you are over the peak and let go of restrictions then.
272,The real reason is it got expensive to smoke.
273,Some people just couldn’t afford the habit anymore.
274,Non-smokers are less likely to try it with higher prices.
275,"Start taxing companies on sales of high sugar and high calorie products and make healthier options (fruits, veggies, fresh meat) cheaper is the way to go."

280,I am really worried about these kids wearing masks for 7-8 hours per day.
281,What’s the long term effects of that.
282,These kids will suffer when temperatures rises and a lot of schools do not have AC.
283,"As far as I know, our HVAC systems in schools are central."
284,Each room should have its own ventilation system.
285,We need to figure out a cost effective way to do this.
286,We need to have cutting edge technologies to fight this virus.
287,We better step up thing before it’s too late.
288,that is insane.
289,I wish.
290,I know people in IRL who are saying they will continue wearing masks and only do outdoor gatherings even after being vaccinated.
291,I wish I was exaggerating.
292,"Yeah, it's going to be a no on used furniture for me."
293,I got pinworms from a used sofa bed when I was a kid.

380,I honestly could not tell if my first Pfizer shot actually gave me side effects or if it was just me being stupid.
381,Right after the shot I just felt really warm and lightheaded but that could have just been my anxiety of getting it and waiting 15 to see if I was gonna have a bad reaction.
382,Had a super mild headache for the rest of the day and then I was fine the next.

467,No basically about it.
468,I volunteered at a clinic and was a “scribe” for vaccination cards.

470,"Holy shit, they really did say vaccines cause herpes."
471,"Then I read the article and they meant shingles, which means all of those people previously had chicken pox... which could have been prevented through another vaccine."
472,2000 deaths in a population over a billion is nothing.
473,"If 2000 die all 365 days of a year it's still less than 0,1% of the population."
474,"So, since we're making stupid reductionist comparisons, how about the uk then?"
475,"Or germany, who did more to develop the shots than anyone?"
476,"Ugh great now that damn song is in my head, thanks"
477,Do you have evidence of this?
478,"The US *has* been exporting raw ingredients:  in fact, nearly every worldwide dose of the Pfizer vaccine begins with raw materials produced on US soil."
479,Don’t confuse short supply due to massive domestic demand with an export ban...
480,Sam Adams already tried the free alcohol but no one budged.
481,So did budweiser I think...
482,Because people were scared a lot more last year and then stopped caring after a year unfortunately.
483,Aussie here......we are in a similar boat.
484,AstraZeneca recommended for over 50's now.

488,Turns out you can hide.
489,"I hope this continues, with medical exemptions to those that can't get vaccinated of course (and I mean ACTUAL medical reasons)."
490,It’s not necessarily anxiety....waking up at 5:30am instead of 7:45am to spend money on commuting to an office full of people I don’t really like has very low upside.
491,I can just do my work from home.
492,Clock out at 5:01pm And maximize my personal time instead of sitting in traffic.
493,So you mean not educated.
494,"I have a masters degree and I'm not wearing a mask outside, I'm not a fucking moron

Or did just mean it's a way to try to signal that they're educated while they're actually not?"
495,I'm from rural India and last year covid barely made a dent in rural parts.
496,Was mostly an urban phenomenon.
497,This year tho..
498,"disgusting, selfish, pro-covid"
499,You could probably travel to the UK/EU or Europe in general.
500,Probably Canada aswell.
501,This all depends on when though.

503,"Just a bit to early maybe, we're looking at something like 40-50% vaccinated by the end of may in the EU I think."
504,In July sometimes?
505,Probably closer to 70% of all adults vaccinated.
506,This is just some quick math though so take this with a grain of salt.

526,It just seems reasonable to me that vaccines aren't the only thing this would apply to.
527,"Surely there are other things we could have spent money on, but didn't."
528,there is a vax they gave to black footed ferrets as they are endangered.

I had to double take because that's serious overkill at our current vaccination rate when even the most cynical experts are saying we'll be largely back to normal by fall."
562,I hope it's just a moonshot to cover asses and they plan to cut it early when vaccination shows real effect.
563,"The supplemental healthcare care covers 80-90% of prescriptions costs, covers eye glasses, pyhsio, massage, chiropractors, 500 in whatever health costs etc etc."

621,I'm not going to change what I'm doing until we can all relax a bit together.
622,Same here.
623,I think it all boils down to different levels of risk tolerance.
624,I regularly ride motorcycles and fly small planes so I take on more risk than the average person.
625,This whole mess has made me wonder if the vast majority of people have never dealt with risk assessment before.
626,It's like they went about their lives without a second thought that today could be their last for any number of reasons.
627,Now with this scary new virus going around they don't know how to cope with risk mitigation and just shut themselves down.
628,Amid all these depressing headlines this was a breath of fresh air
629,I'd rather the US become a Canadian state so we can get their healthcare.
630,Maybe it’s different in Quebec but Manitoba is not the pinacle of health care in Canada.
631,"For walk-ins, they are everywhere and I can get head to one in the morning and Be in and out in an hour when my kids get a bug."
632,Ers have been great for the kids which cuts/head bashes and all sorts of emergencies.
633,We stayed overnight last summer as they thought my daughter would need surgery after a fall but didn’t.
634,If you need non emergency surgery it can take a few months.
635,I had a. Limpoma I wanted removed in my shoulder.
636,"It’s took 2 months to get in to see the surgeon, and then 4 months to get it done."
637,"Cost me 12$ in parking for multiple visits and a physical by my DR.   

None of my friend seems to have issues getting into a walk-in or to see their family dr.   Our happened to be across the city so we will hit a walk-in in for an ear infection or whatever."
638,"All the visits, and treatments are all electronically sent back to their dr."
639,If you want non-merge my surgery fast the us system is going to be better.
640,If you have a very rare conditions the us is going to be better as their population means there are Probally more cases and a specialized dr to treat it.
641,If that’s the case Canada health pays for those visits from what I understand.
642,"But no matter what happens to you or how many times you have to go to ther dr (me and my kids are on adhd meds and have doses being dialed each month) , it costs us nothing each time we go."
643,"Wait times are and issue for non emergency stuff, but emergency services are done quickly at the time."
644,Canada really needs better vaccine manufacturing and with novavax coming that is a step in the right direction.
645,But the us is big business for pharma and healthcare.
646,It’s just the citizens paying a lot for it.
647,"I used to want to live in the us, but as I got older I realized I didn’t want what the reality was cs the shows I watched as a kid :)


I’m glad the us is doing really well on vaccinations,  everyone will be better for it."
648,They have 1.3 billion people.
649,I’m sure they could easily find takers that were actually in the country.
650,Also means they have the workforce to vaccinate faster
651,How about some free crack??
652,🤣🤣
653,Multiple factors.
654,"Aside from factors mentioned by others, New Hampshire used up its supply and can only administer as many are distributed."
655,Other states are also sending vaccines to rural areas where demand has dried up while urban and suburban areas are still undersupplied (it's time to start distributing to where demand is instead of proportionally)
656,This post appears to be about vaccines.

871,Deaths are a lagging indicator.
872,"It typically takes weeks to die from covid after you're infected, and there is a reporting delay too."
873,"At least some of the deaths that are being reported now were likely people who were infected in, say, February, died in March, and are just now showing up in the reports."
874,And some cases are likely even older than that.

876,This is good news
877,My parents got this!
878,Nice to know study being published reflects the doctors trust in this.
879,And let's not even talk about how much higher your risk of DVT is from having a job where you sit all day.
880,There is strong evidence that wearing masks indoors and good ventilation stops virus spread.
881,That is why I'm upset masks aren't mandatory in workplaces yet.
882,"Testing, masks, contact tracing and of course vaccinations are the only way out (with strong evidence behind them!)."
883,Opening up before we have infection rates under control is not.
884,I did not speak about 'sending the wrong message' nor do I think recommending mask wearing indoors is an 'abudance of caution'.
885,Either you are misunderstanding me or misconstruing my comment.
886,"Nope, Israel had vaccinations open to every adult months ago"
887,PA does when you’re unable to maintain 6’ from others (more or less)
888,I wouldn't stress it.
889,You don't even know if they were infected.
890,Combined with you likely having immunity the chances are extremely small from that interaction.
891,Faster?
892,It’s speed of light compared to the vaccination rate in Canada
893,That's true.
894,Fine by me.
895,Not worried about a .0004% chance of a clot.
896,Booked my appointment for next week.
897,It's crowded-ass Massachusetts.
898,"If you're more than six feet away from someone, that's only because another person is still closing that distance."
899,"Unless you're in the Berkshires, it's easier to just wear a mask when you're outside then it is to put on your mask whenever someone comes near."

906,"It's disingenuous to say an NP is ""just a nurse."""
907,"NPs have a larger scope since they diagnosis, prescribe, treat, etc."
908,This is why I say a lot of you argue in bad faith.
909,"You don't want to be called providers or clinicians, because you claim it's confusing, but then you're using that same logic to call an NP ""just a nurse,"" which is misleading."
910,Patients need to know that NPs have a larger scope.
911,"It doesn’t, but it’s the only vaccine that 40+ are eligible to be vaccinated with in Ontario."
912,Even though NACI didn’t approve that and stays with the recommendation of 55+ for AZ
913,"I wouldn't say true ""herd immunity"" has been reached in New York, New Jersey or Florida but all of them are in better shape than Michigan based on high rates of prior infection (and by now the vaccination effect)."
914,Seasonality matters but high prior infection rates do provide a population with a certain degree of protection in the future.
915,1 in 3 people have had COVID in Los Angeles.
916,You can't deny that in some way that's contributing to their very low rates now compared to Michigan.
917,The weed is gonna be trash bag quality
918,There's no reason to wait.
919,If you can manage to get an appointment through normal means then you're not pushing ahead of anyone.
920,Should we all hunker down in solidarity?
921,It's the same thing twice.
922,Sign up for a first dose and bring your card.
923,Doesn't need to be a second dose appointment.
924,It doesn't specify.
925,Could be any of them depending on where you live and how they're going about distribution.
926,No
927,I don't feel like this at all.
928,"Places will get back to normal but there's a difference  between having 40% of people vaccinated, now and 70% in a couple months."
929,We just aren't there yet
930,That was industrial oxygen.
931,Not medical.
932,For god sakes stop spreading half detailed news and resulting in panic.
933,The report which it relies on from Money Control was deleted as well when they got to know it was industrial.
934,The more educated parts of california are also the more crowded parts.
935,"Even though you're much safer from a spread outdoors than indoors, there's still a nonzero risk when you're on a crowded street, depending on the weather conditions."
936,So I don't think it's about intelligence *per se* but just a reflection of the local areas.

955,They have a huge problem with people being responsible and avoiding infection?
956,Was that a typo?
957,"I'm just surprised about how this sub has changed a little too, I guess enough evidence stacks up and it's hard to deny anymore."
958,I was fully expecting to get downvoted for not being on the super strict narrative.
959,"I remember how talking about Sweden trying it out was not too well received, of course their experiment turned out kind of bad initially because their nursing homes got it pretty bad."
960,Because you halted AZ for propaganda.
961,Look at UK and their numbers.
962,clickbait
963,"So if you're vaxxed, you may get infected but you won't know it because you won't have any symptoms and you're incapable of spreading it to anyone."
964,Sounds extremely worrisome.
965,BRB.
966,Gonna lose some sleep over this.
967,[removed]
968,Don't all strains show resistance to antibodies?
969,And the game is the vaccines keep you from severe cases?
970,I tried telling the ONE unvaccinated adult at my job that CDC said we don't have to quarantine if exposed after being fully vaccinated.
971,"Come to find out, not only did she not quarantine after being directly exposed before, she went to a holiday gathering of like 20 people."
972,"-_-

If masks were dropped as a requirement at work post vaccine, she would lose her marbles because she hates the masks and would be the only adult left in one"
973,If it's a pain in the ass to get a vaccine it means people ARE motivated to get a vaccine.
974,"I'm not saying your argument isn't partly true, I just think we aren't there yet."
975,Maybe at 60% fully vaccinated people will have to get rid of restrictions and just deal with hard headed people.
976,Read the article.
977,This virus does not spread outdoors.
978,(Except in mass gatherings).
979,SoCal had a worse winter for a lot of reasons.
980,Not wearing masks outdoors was definite belt not one of them
981,My first shot took me down for about 36 hours.
982,I’m a little nervous about the second shot.
983,Related: I was listening to an interview with a Northeastern (one of the first colleges to do this) official the other day.
984,"He was saying that the first thing they had to do was make sure it was legal, i.e."
985,the distinction between FDA EUA vaccines and FDA approved vaccines that colleges already require.
986,The legal team was pretty confident (obviously) and noted that colleges around the country have been requiring FDA EUA COVID tests throughout the pandemic.
987,Fed should allow cruising for vaccinated passengers.
988,Helps drive vaccination rates and stimulate the economy.
989,Win win.
990,only question is who provided the vaccines for the crew - but right now US has J&amp;J and AstraZeneca shots to spare
991,That's literally what I just said.

995,Schedule a first dose somewhere with the same vaccine.
996,They won't mix the type for you but you can get your second dose anywhere and it's the same as a first dose.
997,Be sure to bring your vaccination card.
998,You aren't thinking it through.
999,"If people are against vaccine passports,  how do you know its safe enough to be at a gym without a mask and social distancing?"
1000,If we really aren't going to require a passport we will probably need to use another metric like 60% of all people vaccinated to open without restrictions but then we have to also think of the kids who can't take the vaccine.
1001,"France's economy has been affected much more, while Germany's industry was saved by exports to Asian countries."
1002,Germany also tends to put on the brakes much earlier than other European countries while France probably has the most problems in containing the spread of all larger European countries.
1003,"Hopefully the French will get vaccinated now, they also had the worst vaccination willingness polls in the world a few months ago."
1004,Suddenly people with zero scientific knowledge are drawing stupid conclusions about subjects they have no qualifications to talk about.
1005,"J&amp;J vaccine is incredibly safe, there’s many more medicine we use in daily life with more frequent side effects every day."
1006,"I’m confident by Friday, the vaccine will be resumed in the US."
1007,But how does this play into states like NJ and NY still having high case numbers?
1008,"If we could have reached herd immunity, you'd think we would have after that first deadly wave in spring 2020, but in NJ, cases have been high again fall 2020-spring 2021."

1019,It’s so bad they’ve created a bonfire and thrown those scientists on it according to that photo.
1020,"Ok that's just stupid, need 2 mRNA for sure"
1021,Omg hero
1022,This is probably just a coincidence but Ontario has been mooning with cases lately as well.
1023,Probably something they bought.
1024,"If I bought something at Amazon and are not receiving it, I am gonna complain at Amazon, instead of Walmart."
1025,"Like AZ I sadly don’t think Janssen will be used in Norway, I don’t think our authorities will risk it."
1026,The additional deliveries from BioNTech over the summer makes it an easier decision for them too.
1027,We should be done in Aug/Sep relying only on the mRNA shots.

1034,"Nah mate I’m not taking one for the team, sacrificed enough so far and I won’t spin the roulette again just so we avoid some variants, my protection from dose 1 will be fine for now."
1035,I will happily take a different second vaccine like Moderna/Pfizer.
1036,I don’t agree at all.
1037,!Remindme!
1038,8 months and we will see.
1039,I’m guessing there will be plenty vaccines and treatments of many kinds still in use.
1040,"I don’t believe that encouraging mask wearing in 100% of situations, including those where it serves no purpose, helps the public health messaging."
1041,"It just gives some ammo to anti maskers, that look the govt isn’t actually making these laws based on science."
1042,People working an in-person job without paid sick leave most definitely did this.
1043,"If getting tested meant risking a positive test which would have forced you to stay home for 2 weeks and thus forfeit a half-month's pay, that really isn't an option for a low-wage worker."
1044,They would be unable to pay bills.
1045,Far easier overall to take a few ibuprofen and go to work anyway and just try not to cough too loud.
1046,"I don't believe they said that, they said we know natural immunity lasts 8 months at least."
1047,"Let's assume your friend is worried about j&amp;j, what about pfizer vaccine?"
1048,More importantly why are you friends with that person?
1049,[removed]
1050,"Good for you, you fucking asshole."
1051,I think maybe you are conflating some finer points.
1052,"I’m quite sure some experts hypothesized washing surfaces wasn’t necessary, but they did not have a crystal ball, and their opinion was an educated guess."
1053,"On the other hand, the experts telling us to wash down surfaces and groceries were all saying something like, “we don’t know how this virus transmits and wiping down surfaces is the safe play until we know more.”"
1054,Not specifically a bad thing.
1055,"Now that they are not negotiating with the EU, individual member states can make deals with Valneva on their own."
1056,Valneva also said in the article that they do not want to talk with the EU anymore but focus on contracts with individual member states instead.
1057,Yup!
1058,"I’m going through this right now, normally people send out save the dates like 6-8 months before too so people can literally “save the date”."
1059,&gt; Floss can occasionally cause harm.
1060,"Careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work."
1061,"Though frequency is unclear, floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature

Leaving this here...."
1062,That’s my point.
1063,These counties are letting those with first dose AZ get a second dose mRNA in it’s place
1064,"Still, scientists constantly talking about how it “mutates slowly” while they also knew that it was highly infectious and cases would keep climbing - making it mutate rapidly anyway - was fucking stupid messaging."
1065," Wow, that’s cold."
1066,Comparative mourning.
1067,These odds are INCREDIBLY low.
1068,Statistically speaking this shouldn’t alter your decision making.

1072,Which is irrelevant since the date changed.
1073,There are always going to be billions and billions of people around the world who are unvaccinated against Covid.
1074,"It’s endemic, it’s never going away, and there will always be the chance that some variant emerges somewhere."
1075,Better to just get used to it.
1076,Is there a way to visualize Covid vaccine supply and demand per state/county?
1077,I hear lots of anecdotes about supply being big in one area and demand being big in others.
1078,Would love to see it via data.
1079,I tried vaccine spotter but that shows “recently” so I can’t tell if that trend is holding over hours/days or just right now.
1080,The issue here is insurance.
1081,Even though the government have said restrictions will be lifted on 21st June festivals have to invest a lot of money up front.
1082,The government has shown no hesitation to change rules with little common sense or notice.
1083,"Beyond that, what’s does removing covid restrictions on 21 st June actually mean?"
1084,Especially for big events.
1085,The government are still investigating that and yet to report back.
1086,I purchased tickets to several festivals and gigs for the summer.
1087,They all sold out in minutes such was the demand.

1091,Good try though.
1092,So many thousands of people died and that is with health care.
1093,What's a few hundred more.
1094,"People are not supporting the rules if they are not following it, it just means they want rules for others."
1095,I honestly don’t know what you are up to here.
1096,I hope you have a good day.
1097,If two doses are needed for proper immunity taking just one dose creates the risk of new variants.
1098,In fact that’s exactly how variants are created in a laboratory.
1099,"Dude,  AstraZeneca is not an mRNA vaccine."
1100,Thrombosis is seen with non mRNA covid vaccine.
1101,We haven't seen this with pfizer and Moderna
1102,"After getting both shots and waiting two weeks, it's amazing how people not wearing masks doesn't bother me anymore."
1103,"I've never cared about people wearing them outside, and I'm as liberal as they come."
1104,That’s invites not save the dates.
1105,This looks like both an invite/save the date.
1106,For save the dates (basically saying when/where) the wedding is anywhere from 6 months to a year is customary.
1107,"Especially considering international travel, and people having to get passports, flight, hotel and child care."
1108,That’s why I wear a mask around my neck outside.
1109,"I’ll wear it when I need it, but I don’t really need to rn."
1110,"Oh I better call my dental practice and tell them they’re breaking the law, not only do they recommend it, they give it out!"
1111,And I just noticed the strings connection that is funny :)

1119,.006% chance of being hospitalized if you become infected after first dose of vaccine.
1120,"12 out of 192,131

1121,Oral hygiene is the basis of good health.
1122,About 18 hours for me.
1123,Got a fever that was easy to bring down with Tylenol.
1124,I think a silent majority had an easy time with it.
1125,"The flu-like symptoms were easy to handle knowing they would go away shortly, plus it's super weird to feel like you have the flu but without the chest congestion, sore throat, and runny nose."
1126,I went about my day happy to know that it was working.
1127,"Well yes, more people will die if it doesn’t happen soon."
1128,"It’s happening already with the US hoarding AZ vaccine it won’t use, but this will come back on Biden as deliberately withholding supplies and sabotaging the supply chain more selfishly than before."
1129,He doesn’t seem like that kind of president.
1130,But we will see.
1131,Important to note that these second infections are 99.99% mild covid.
1132,They are overwhelmingly not severe covid cases.
1133,Maybe go study English too
1134,"Actually, there is a lot of support for quite a lot for most measures, it is just that our compliance 70-90% for most measures except visitor rule at 40%)."
1135,"So we are probably good at accepting the rules, but had at following them."
1136,"Or what I also see a lot, people who think that they are somehow excluded from the rules for that ""one time"" (sort of a it does not count for me not for others it does mentality)."
1137,We as a society just can't take the responsibility sadly.
1138,"We are mostly for a lot of the measures and are against full ICU's as an society, but we have difficulty behaving according to our own believes and follow measures we agree with on a personal level."
1139,Certainly a failure for our society.
1140,"So yes, people have a complete lack of personal responsibility in this country."
1141,"Also, limiting amount of COVID patients in ICU is just cruel."
1142,Healthcare is meant to take care of all people if they want to receive care.
1143,"That is a right we have, and we can expect there to be capacity when needed."
1144,"We are not down third world country that cannot take care of it's citizens health needs (if that's what you are rooting for, I'd guess you would love to live in a country with almost no healthcare facilities)."
1145,"You want to take away the right from people to survive and restrict them from being treated, basically let people die."
1146,That is so much more than taking away some of the personal freedoms temporarily.
1147,"That is not the kind of country we live in, and luckily never ever will."
1148,You play music too loud?
1149,Right to jail 👉
1150,"There was a lot of reporting on this last fall was it, about the WHO bending to the interests of it's donor countries in not recognizing airborne spread until after that open letter was signed by all of those scientists worldwide and forced their hand."
1151,"This guy may just be a contrarion, but either way he was used to further the WHO's kowtowing to their donors."
1152,Getting my second moderna dose in a bit.
1153,Got a couple doorknobs on deck.
1154,It's a double wammy now .... PPL are out of money and hospitals are at capacity as well
1155,"&gt;40% of the city's population already at least partially vaccinated

1160,Avoid reposting information.
1161,Understandable.
1162,You never really know how bad your symptoms will be though.
1163,My friend had NO symptoms at all through two shots of Pfizer.
1164,My mom slept for nearly a whole day after her second moderna shot.
1165,"Like I said, I was uncomfortable, but I took Tylenol and powered through work."
1166,How will this end?
1167,It is endemic.
1168,It will mutate and return again and again.
1169,You have 7B people globally that are incubators...it will be 2030 before we vax them all.
1170,End game will be virus becomes mild aka the common cold or it gets sinister aka 1918.
1171,Question is what population will select best for the two scenarios above- vaccinated or non vaccinated.
1172,I really could not even guess.
1173,For those who believe the end game is afoot and we will be on a cruise ship together this summer....do you really think the virus is an evolutionary deadend?
1174,Yeah like fuck am I taking my second dose of this.
1175,The only reason it has only been seen post dose 1 is due to lack of data on dose 2.
1176,I don’t doubt the risks are the same.
1177,Germany/Denmark/Sweden/France all realising that and making the right call re mRNA second dose
1178,&gt; Floss can occasionally cause harm.
1179,"Careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work."
1180,"Though frequency is unclear, floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature

My dentist told me to brush my gums and now I have no problems with my gums...a little string isn't going to do what a brush is going to do to your gums."
1181,Flossing literally does not remove plaque.. did you not read the link I sent?
1182,They basically faked all the data to sell you a string that doesn't do anything...
1183,Here's the link again: https://apnews.com/article/f7e66079d9ba4b4985d7af350619a9e3
1184,"Great, good for you then"
1185,The US importer/partner of this vaccine is Ocugen (OCGN) r/ocugen based out of Pennsylvania.
1186,"You can find out more about this news at their press release here:

https://ocugen.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ocugens-covid-19-vaccine-co-development-partner-bharat-biotech-0

 They were waiting on this data to apply to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization."
1187,They've said they want to import more than 100m doses this year and produce this domestically in the US next year.
1188,This vaccine can be kept in a standard refrigerator for 2 years and at room temperature for 2 months!
1189,This is the classic old school way of making a vaccine where they give you a piece of the dead virus.
1190,Unless they're hiding dead bodies then infections have remained relatively low.
1191,WHOA
1192,Is this the old school way of making vaccines?
1193,Can anyone tell how the side effects of this may compare with the likes of using mRNA or Adeno virus vector?
1194,"Again, not Biden administration incompetence."
1195,"""Masks don't work against the virus but we desperately need them to protect health care workers from the virus?"""
1196,That's prime Trumpism doublespeak right there.
1197,"It really annoys me when people continue advocating for AZ saying stuff like ""it's still safer than catching covid"" or ""you have more chance of dying in a car etc""

That's assuming it's a binary choice between the AZ vaccine and catching covid, which isn't how it works at all."
1198,"Catching covid, especially here in the UK right now, is overwhelming unlikely and the chances of dying from it when you're young even less so."
1199,"And even if it wasn't, its all moot because alternative and superior vaccines exist."
1200,I'm also quite angry with how hard doctors are pushing people here in the UK to get it.
1201,I received another call today from my doctor saying my appointment to get vaccinated is available and he acted shocked when I told him I would prefer to wait for Pfizer or Moderna instead of getting the AZ vaccine.
1202,"They always try to guilt trip you into accepting them, dismissing your concerns with excuses like ""you'll be back of the queue""."
1203,Fair enough.
1204,"I'd rather wait a few more weeks/months than take something that has now been proven to have serious risks of death, while the MRNA vaccines don't."
1205,"But people are obviously rejecting this vaccine in number because I'm late 30s (officially, only those 45+ can get the jab here) so they're going down the list, desperately trying to use their existing supplies."
1206,The UK is being effectively bullied into getting it and it's not on.
1207,"If people want to roll the dice with it, then best of luck."
1208,I'm more than willing to take my chances waiting and getting something better.
1209,"And no, I won't apologise for it."
1210,Michigan was hit pretty hard on the first wave.
1211,"I don't know if they handled it ""well"""
1212,The people will have to be the ones to push back against more or longer restrictions.
1213,"If they keep meekly accepting them, they’ll never end."
1214,"Eh - the old people I understand, but I think we are also seeing that letting this run like wildfire through the most contagious age group is also problematic due to the mutation risk negating our vaccination efforts...

At this point shots in arms is more important in my mind."

1219,*
1220,Wrong.
1221,There was one study that showed almost no efficacy against SA variant for AZ for mild/moderate symptoms (no data on severe).
1222,Totally makes sense to me that the US wants to look out for their population first.
1223,But can a world leader please publicly ask what the timeline is on export?
1224,"The answer is always ""soon""."
1225,This is the classic old school way of using the whole dead virus to make a vaccine like we did with polio.
1226,Supposed to have near no side effects.
1227,They'll run into the same problem that prevented SARS vaccines from making it into Phase 2/3 trials at all back in 2003 - insufficient disease circulating in the population.
1228,There's a huge amount of randomness to which states have super spread incidents when.
1229,"This isn't newsworthy because it is the best vaccine, it is newsworthy because it is another vaccine going out the public."
1230,[removed]
1231,[removed]
1232,Take my upvote.
1233,I left and then got it and had to come back lol
1234,"I mean, this is what each individual country is doing."
1235,Of course he does.
1236,Why are we letting businessmen set health policy?
1237,[removed]
1238,Wrong.
1239,"There is plenty of data, from the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway that shows the AZ vaccine has a very small (\~1/100K) chance of inducing a rare clotting disorder."
1240,Similar results have been found for JnJ in the US.
1241,"That is why those vaccines were paused to assess risks, whereas the mRNA vaccines were not."
1242,Bharat Biotech is already an FDA certified lab and has made several US vaccines.
1243,Their US partner is Ocugen out of Pennsylvania.
1244,BB has just committed to manufacturing 700m doses this year!
1245,Ocugen is looking to import more than 100m by end of year and make more than 200m next year domestically.
1246,Feel this way about the US one!
1247,That was my guess too but there's no data that I have seen to support that.
1248,I would consider death severe.
1249,Why does it have to be 100% for it to be good?
1250,"It’s certainly better than just catching covid without any sort of protection, how is there no hope in that."
1251,Meanwhile there are two new strains wreaking havoc throughout the country.
1252,Less than 10% have been vaccinated sadly.
1253,Hope the situation improves soon.
1254,Or landing on their head.
1255,I've seen lots of stories of people getting knocked out and then they die or have brain injuries from their head hitting concrete...although I suppose with a tornado you have a good chance of landing in a field.
1256,Well maybe not good...but a chance.
1257,"I'm in Philadelphia, work in the suburbs, and the people I know here have to drive to Lancaster or somewhere like that to get a dose."
1258,[removed]
1259,The most similar to this is the Chinese vaccine _Sinovac_ and the vaccine VLA2001 under phase III trial made by Valneva.
1260,These vaccines use dead but whole SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
1261,"It has nothing to do with the J&amp;J and AZ vaccines, which use live (but non-replicating) _adenoviruses_, an entirely different virus family, with genetically modified genomes that produce the SARS-CoV-2 proteins instead of copies of the same adenovirus."
1262,Maybe - I hope so.
1263,"But here in Kentucky our governor has stated once we get to 2.5 million people with at least 1 dose, restrictions will be lifted and we're sitting on vaccine appointments that can't get put in arms."
1264,So that's the long con!
1265,"Invent a global pandemic, get all governments on board, in order to sell donuts!"
1266,"Big donut, you evil."
1267,Really interesting situation here.
1268,When will the UK pass the threshold where insurance companies feel secure that the gov.
1269,isn't going to shut down an event because of covid numbers.
1270,"Back of the napkin calculations tell me that the UK is going to look awfully normal by August, so it's interesting to see the conservative attitude."
1271,Here are the current restrictions in California.
1272,https://abc7news.com/california-stay-at-home-regions-covid-icu-capacity-shelter-in-place-bay-area-lockdown/6393906/
1273,"no it's not, stop this bullshit"
1274,Strict lockdown needed immediately.
1275,To be noted: SII is facing serious shortages of raw materials from USA.
1276,Mr. Adar has clarified.
1277,Until that the vaccination rate is expected to drop sharply.
1278,My city is already facing extreme shortages
1279,Then why were they giving them away?
1280,"Look at it this way, one day they stopped the J&amp;J vaccine because of reported side effects."
1281,What would happen if that happened today with Pfizer/Moderna?
1282,All vaccinations in the US would stop.
1283,Or what if there was a problem with manufacturing?
1284,Then AZ would be the backup plan.
1285,Those AZ doses are only about one week's supply at the current pace.
1286,Or it might be the well-established link between good oral hygiene and a lower rate of pneumonia.
1287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443306/
1288,Yup.
1289,They’re opening up the flood gates from May 1st.
1290,Everyone above 18 is eligible for vaccinations.
1291,"Plus, two more vaccines are in the pipeline to be approved soon."
1292,So I’m expecting things to pick up soon.
1293,"&gt;I think the wait times etc have given rise to a lot of private clinics doing various things, so I do like that I can wait 3 months for a free ultrasound or pay $100 for one next week."
1294,And that is a thing about universal health care that has to be emphasized to Americans - universal health care does not cause private clinics to completely go out of business but it keeps the prices reasonable that they can ask for procedures.
1295,"If your ultrasound was $2k and not $100, you would probably wait at the public clinic all day instead."
1296,Americans who cannot pay the $2k may have to wait until they are ill enough to be accepted into the ER.
1297,The risk can only be assessed if people are told the truth for their particular situation.
1298,I do not know the statistics for the J&amp;J vaccin but for the AstraZeneca vaccin it works out that the vaccin is more dangerous than the disease for young people (women).
1299,Early diagnosis and the right treatment will of course save lives but the long term effects of this side-effect are often life-changing.
1300,Only if people are given the real risk for them (like 1 in about 60000 for the AstraZeneca vaccin in young women) it is fair to say that people are informed properly.
1301,The fact that millions of grey-haired people have had a vaccin without side-effects is really no consolation if you as a young woman end up in a wheelchair because you thought the chance was 1 in a million instead of 1 in 60000.
1302,I am definitely not an anti-vaxxer but I am getting a bit concerned about the crazy comparisons that are flying around like less than the chance of being bitten to death by a dog or being killed when crossing the road.
1303,No true risk assessment can be made until we know how many of the millions vaccinated with J&amp;J were young women.
1304,If I was under 35 and healthy I would insist on a different vaccin until this information is freely released.
1305,Women have way more side effects from the vaccine (they are responsible for 80%+ of the reported ones) and women are known to have more active immune systems*.
1306,"They are also, as well known, less likely to die to die drom Covid."
1307,*Having a more active immune system isn't necessarily always a blessing of course.
1308,It's also why women are far more likely to have autoimmune conditions.
1309,"Ss: sorry for a little altered headline, word by word would be: Unknown new mutation found in Anyksciai city, mayor reports different numbers."
1310,"Basically yesterday labs found new strain that is a mix between Brazilian and SA strain in 36 samples in a very small Lithuanian city, several people who tested positive were already fully vaccinated."
1311,Today mayor of that city reported that numbers are bigger than that and more people are getting sick.
1312,"In last 7 days we had more under-35 year olds dying in the country than in all previous pandemic added together, however it might be just a coincidence."
1313,There’s no evidence that night curfews do anything
1314,"&gt;	Results from the first four years of the experiment, published in the Journal of Wine Economics, showed a typical judge’s scores varied by plus or minus four points over the three blind tastings."
1315,A wine deemed to be a good 90 would be rated as an acceptable 86 by the same judge minutes later and then an excellent 94.
1316,Plus or minus 4 points seems reasonable to me.
1317,It’s not like the judges loved a wine one minute then totally hated it when they got a second glass.
1318,"The scores are just within a small range rather than exactly reproducible, which is probably because it’s a difficult thing to do, to pin a wine down to an exact number from 0-100 based on taste."
1319,"This a genuine question, didn't scientists keep saying last year this virus mutates really slowly?"
1320,This is slow?a new variant of concern every other week?
1321,Or have they got it wrong and it actually mutates fast and constantly and we'll be living forever trying to outdo it with vaccines?
1322,Does anyone know what the expected endgame is?
1323,Is the hope that corona will disappear entirely with enough vaccinations or will yearly shots be needed to deal with mutations?
1324,For everybody or just the vulnerable?
1325,I would say something like 4-5x the number of actually reported cases.
1326,"There have been numerous studies estimating this, early on this was much higher as much as 15-20x."
1327,It is possible that early in the spread in each area there are far more unreported cases which gradually declines as the spread slows and there is more testing and awareness.
1328,"In India right now with 15 million reported cases, it would not surprise me in the least to hear that 10 times that many people have been exposed, if not higher."
1329,[removed]
1330,This is what we need.
1331,An END DATE.
1332,No more restrictions.
1333,No Masks.
1334,ONLY If you do your part.
1335,Our politicians in Washington and the CDC are clueless.
1336,&gt;Neuman says both problems of access and hesitancy need in Brazos County need to be solved.
1337,That’s because the state of Texas can’t afford to overlook anyone if it wants to reach herd immunity by vaccinating 75% of the total population.
1338,"&gt;“Problem is, 25% of Texas is under 18, and they’re not going to be able to get the vaccine yet because it’s not approved,” Neuman said."
1339,"“That means we would need literally everybody over 18 to get there, and that is an uphill battle.”

&gt;Neuman says it’s tough to tell from the data alone how large a factor vaccine hesitancy is playing in the county’s disparities."
1340,He hopes it’s more of a problem with access because he says it’s easier to tell people where to go and what to do as opposed to calming their fears.
1341,"&gt;“I know on some occasions there have been some available doses in the area where there were basically more doses than there was demand,” Neuman said."
1342,"“There’s a chance we could be getting this to more people, and I hope it’s not reluctance or lack of trust that’s behind it."
1343,"Those are tough problems to solve.”

&gt;The only way out of the pandemic, Neuman says, is through vaccination."
1344,That means it’s critical to get everyone on board to receive their shot.
1345,&gt;“Science has done this.
1346,We’ve knocked out smallpox.
1347,We’ve got polio basically on the ropes.
1348,"There aren’t any natural transmissions anymore,” Neuman said."
1349,"“This is doable, and we did those other things mostly with technologies developed between the 1950s and the 1990s."
1350,"We’ve got the tools, and it’s the right time."
1351,This is what we need to do.”
1352,I love roller coasters.
1353,Cuz why not?
1354,Seriously responding 7 days later...this is pathetic
1355,Part of it is younger folks have benefited from generations of people who were vaccinated.
1356,"They don't see these diseases as being a threat because diseases like Measles, Polio, Whooping Cough, Rubella are unknown to them."
1357,"Meanwhile they have people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jim Carrey, Alicia Silverstone and Robert De Niro telling them myths about vaccinations."
1358,They shroud their fictions as objective curiosity.
1359,I've seen some of these anti vaxxers now trying to link themselves to the civil rights movement by comparing themselves to civil rights marchers in the 60s.
1360,"Ok, I got on a bit of a soap box there but as a Baby Boomer (I was born in 1964 the last Baby Boomer year in theory) I knew people who had measles (My sister had them as a child just a week before she was to be vaccinated)."
1361,I knew people who had polio and there were pictures on TV of kids in iron lungs still.
1362,Polio still scared the shit out of people.
1363,When I was in elementary school we had  Rubella sweep through our school right before the vaccine came out (I did not get it) and I remember lining up in the cafeteria to get our Rubella shots.
1364,"I know it sounds like the old ""I walked 5 miles in the snow to school uphill both ways"" but the truth is young folks today did not have those experiences."
1365,They do not have a healthy fear of these things.
1366,Oh i always thought its that bad because no one gives a shit about restrictions
1367,Yes.
1368,"I was exasperated how these demonstrations were allowed again and again even though everyone knew they would not follow distancing nor mask mandates and attack police and, worst of all, media and journalists!"

1412,"In the US, specialists are competing for your business."
1413,"Doctors in the US also earn about double what they do in Canada, which might explain why there are also more doctors per capita in the US."
1414,Why stay in Canada when you can easily cross the border and make double?
1415,"Doctors in Canada make a good living, but doctors in the US are the 1%."
1416,All of this also helps to explain why the US spends an absurd percentage of GDP on healthcare.
1417,"But it sure does result in quick, high-quality care - just inequitably."
1418,"To me, the issue is that taking masks on and off, shoving them in pockets when not used, etc."
1419,"It increases the risk of transfer from the front of the mask to the wearer’s hands and uncovered face, especially paired with poor hand hygiene when handling the mask."
1420,"If a person has been in a higher exposure environment, and immediately takes off that dirty mask and shoves it into their pocket the second they get outside, or takes it on and off as they encounter others nearby, they are more likely to touch their face and the “dirty” side of the mask."
1421,It can degrade mask efficacy by degrading fit seals—especially if the user is taking on higher risks because they believe they are wearing a better-than-cloth mask that largely depends on seal and integrity for those increases.
1422,"It could speak to understanding how they work, or choosing a higher safety mask than the minimally required one, some of which are very poor fitting or worn improperly (nose exposed)—in part by not understanding how they work or only wearing them because they are forced, even if their pattern of use provides little or no protection to themselves or others."

1439,Nothing to be heard about that topic from China.
1440,"And then there's Russia - Western media claims that in Russia, vaccinations with Sputnik V are already open to everyone because nearly no one wants to get the jab."
1441,"One has to be careful with how Russia is depicted in Western media, though."
1442,Only 4.9 million?

1452,We average less than 50 covid deaths on a 17 million population and seeing how more and more people are being vaccinated I doubt that will go up by a lot.
1453,I'm not trying to justify the decision the government made.

1460,We are at 40% with one dose and 25 with 2 doses.
1461,We will be lucky with current eligibility to get to 60% fully vaccinated.
1462,"To think that with all the double and triple variants, that vaccines wont be nearly as effective anyway."
1463,Last big outbreak we had in my small-ish home town last month originated at a high school.
1464,Explosion of 400 cases within days.
1465,Luckily we locked down hard and fast and now we’re down to 25 cases or so  and they’re all travel related and there doesn’t seem to be community spread anymore.
1466,"But yeah, anyone who says schools are safe are out to lunch."
1467,&gt; Do they think Fauci and Biden are sitting in a room wanking it to pictures of people wearing masks?
1468,"Yes, as can be seen after spending 5 minutes on conservative Twitter."
1469,[removed]
1470,Does anyone actually pay attention to the State Department's travel advisories in the first place?
1471,They've been pretty ludicrous for a long time.
1472,"
&gt;India becomes fastest country to administer 130 million Covid vaccine doses."
1473,"The vast majority of countries couldn't hit 130 million doses, even with every adult in that country fully vaccinated."
1474,Under 10% of the countries in the entire have a high enough population to be able to use 130million covid vaccine doses on only adults.
1475,"As for Brazil, Latin America is headed into winter, a surge was to be expected, there was ample evidence to expect a Winter wave from what happened in the Northern hemisphere last October."
1476,Not sure what changed in India.
1477,These two countries seem to be the largest drivers of new infections and deaths.
1478,US servicemen and women are having a hard time getting vaccines abroad.
1479,"If I were serving abroad, hadn't gotten my vaccine and we started shipping to foreign nationals, I'd be royally pissed."
1480,"I got downvoted for saying something similar yesterday, you get upvoted."
1481,Reddit is a strange place!
1482,It is still dominant there.
1483,"I feel like you are joking but the situation there is serious, please restrain."
1484,The variants have silly names but both are of concern and you can see that the situation got much worse there with the double mutation variant.
1485,Yes I know that they already loaned Canada and Mexico some AZ doses.
1486,"But what I really want is for the US to release more doses to Korea, Japan, and the other key US allies."
1487,"And increasing their influence.... at the same time, Russia has only administered half the doses within its own population than the EU, and a fraction of the US or UK."
1488,Probably getting downvoted by the bots now.

1495,Maybe try this to put it into perspective.
1496,Get 7 dice.
1497,Try to roll all sixes in one throw.
1498,That is still more likely than having a bad side effect.
1499,"(If you do get all sixes then you are very lucky, you should skip the vaccine and go buy a lottery ticket!)"
1500,"Irrational fear is a hard thing to deal with, hope you get through it ok."
1501,yeah ima be honest i didnt read a word of what you said lmao
1502,We were initially told not to wear masks and that masks do nothing and that we should save the masks for healthcare workers.
1503,Except being a DNP just means you took classes in nursing theory and research.
1504,You don’t actually learn medicine.
1505,You are still a nurse at the end of the day.
1506,If the government wants this to end they need to incentivize people to get it.
1507,The next stimulus check (if we ever get it) should be 100% be tied to vaccination proof.
1508,Create Uncle Sam posters to promote this &amp; ads.
1509,There is a way out of this.
1510,Our politicians and messaging are dumb AF.
1511,Can you cite this for me?
1512,I have only found things saying around 40%.
1513,There were reports here and there.
1514,German health minister said or Curevac.
1515,Trump got a lot of people killed.
1516,"Fair, and I'm hoping for no restriction for Janssen, or at least something like 40+."
1517,"That would massively speed up vaccinations, provided they are able to deliver in sufficient volumes."
1518,"You have to take into account that the J&amp;J shot, due to being a single-shot, it has way more benefits than the AstraZeneca vaccine, especially with how slow their deliveries are."
1519,"And since the AZ shot is already given for people over +60 and the doses will cover that, it would make no sense to give J&amp;J for over +60 too."
1520,There's just not enough over 60 people for that
1521,The worst of all is that some people still aren't taking it seriously.
1522,"I live in Mumbai which is one of the worst hit cities in the country, I still see people rooming around on the roads doing their morning exercise, sitting in public gardens all this is happening even after the state government has imposed a curfew."
1523,100% it seems
1524,"If you asked anyone would you rather die when you’re 20 or 70, basically everyone would say 70."
1525,So how does that not apply to other people as well?
1526,My brother dying is more tragic than my great grandfather dying.
1527,It’s ok to admit that.
1528,It doesn’t make us monsters because we’d be even more traumatized if covid affected the younger demographic worse than the old.
1529,"The US certainly does, if Australia and NZ can manage it at the drop of a hat the US army could have easily set up a far larger operation even accounting for size."
1530,It just wasn't on anyone's agenda to do so.
1531,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted.
1532,USA and UK are only country blocking companies from exporting vaccines.
1533,It's poor corporate decisions like this and sending kids back to school unvaccinated that will continue to drive this spread.
1534,"Yeah, with J&amp;J and the extra 50M doses from Pfizer, the EU will reach more than 70% first doses by first week of July."
1535,I think a normal summer is more than possible
1536,"Just 32 vaccinated people were hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent months, according to “extraordinary” real world data showing the effectiveness of Britain’s jabs programme."
1537,"The figure represents a tiny fraction of the more than 74,000 people admitted to hospital with the virus during the time period examined in the study."
1538,"Scientists are preparing to hand findings to the Government’s advisers on Thursday, showing the dramatic impact of first doses on hospitalisations and deaths."
1539,AmERicA FirSt.
1540,Meanwhile those baddie countries like Russia and China are exporting the virus.
1541,Pathetic.

1543,"&gt; If American astronauts trust Russian state technology


They are working to replace Russia's rockets."
1544,"The Soviet rockets are fine machines, but Russia recalled dozens of them due to corruption."
1545,The precious metals where illegally replaced with cheaper metals.
1546,&gt; why shouldn't you?
1547,Who said I didn't ?
1548,My statement was why the general public in the West distrusts Russia's vaccine.
1549,"Not my opinion on said vaccine, which is indifference as it won't be used here (**UK**)."
1550,There are many countries happy to take them &amp; the results look promising.
1551,It’s “likely an underestimate” according to the director of the CDC.
1552,&gt;	The CDC chief acknowledged that the number could be an underestimate.
1553,"&gt;
&gt;“Although this number is from 43 states and territories and likely an underestimate, it still makes a really important point, these vaccines are working."
1554,"Of the nearly 6,000 cases, approximately 30% had no symptoms at all,” Walensky said."
1555,So basically they sacrificing people now 😑
1556,"Also, Walmart platform does not transfer you to register for a mailing list when they are out of slots like other pharmacy websites do."
1557,You can keep checking for nearby locations and some appointments show up as soon as they add slots or have cancellations.
1558,Just be fast to click to confirm if the location shows appointments are available.
1559,I got my appointment for Thursday by clicking back and forth between several nearby locations.
1560,"Missed one chance by taking two seconds to press confirm, but made sure not to repeat that mistake."
1561,Took about 20 min of effort Tuesday afternoon after I had tried out all other local pharmacy options.
1562,I'm glad to have an appointment that soon.

1622,There is a less-than-perfectly-rational line of thinking that says that the virus will gather mutations that will allow it to evade vaccine induced immunity (like Flu viruses do).
1623,"The people who are shouting this the loudest are ignoring T-cell immunity, and focusing entirely on antibodies."
1624,"Turns out that T-cell immunity is more important than antibodies, but both are great."

1633,So like can one develop this condition after a year of wearing a mask?
1634,You are a lot less likely to get it outdoors than indoors.
1635,Less than 10% of covid cases were contracted outdoors.
1636,That's why all the states with outdoor mask mandates only mandate them if you are unable to stay 6 feet away from others.
1637,That seems reasonable.
1638,&gt; Macron has urged EU countries to send 5% of their own vaccine supplies to developing countries to help the bloc regain the initiative from Russia and China in vaccine diplomacy.
1639,This seems extremely reasonable and indeed is our probably only way out of the global crisis.
1640,"If rich countries keep 95% of their own vaccines and share 5% with developing nations, it will be a drop in the bucket to the rich countries but make a world of difference to the ones receiving the donations (since they'll be able to prioritize their health care workers most vulnerable)."
1641,In the study— that’s important.
1642,"Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J also reported a 100% no death rate and people have died, it’s just an astronomically small number (.000something)."

1656,The blood clots that the AZ vaccine creates are called immune mediated thrombocytopenia.
1657,We can treat those and they are incredibly rare.
1658,Covid 19 will also give you one of those but at a much higher rate.
1659,"Countries that pulled the AZ vaccine are wrong to do so, they are endangering their population by potentially exposing them to Covid which is much deadlier than the blood clots from the AZ vaccine."
1660,The numbers don’t lie!
1661,"Honestly as crazy as it sounds given the amount of people involved, what we really needed was a Bubble Olympics."
1662,Planning for it should have started over a year ago.

It seems like people are still taking precautions and enough places are still requiring precautions, even if the government isn't requiring it

I've read there are people concerned that cases in texas will explode soon."
1668,"They might be right, but I just hope they're not"
1669,"And don't forget that, even if she did somehow manage to get some restrictions in place, we have all these sheriffs that refused to enforce the previous orders."
1670,Those aren't your only two choices.
1671,What you call panic train was top medical experts deciding to stop AZ vaccinations because something didn't look right.
1672,This is not something which started on FB/WhatsApp.
1673,Another thing is that these people obviously are aware of what's going on but they're several months behind the news and science.
1674,You should be recovered from acutely feeling sick (such as having a fever) and no longer meet the requirements for quarantine.
1675,Some pharmacies and vaccination sites are using rule this will be 14 days or more after they first felt sick or tested positive.
1676,"&gt; and if you get one, you'll very likely be just fine, something we can't say for sure with getting COVID

There have been 59 reported incidents in Germany so far."
1677,12 of those people have died.
1678,"That is more than 20%, which is orders of magnitude higher than having serious complications from COVID, and those are even lower for younger people, who seemingly have a higher risk from the vaccine than older people."
1679,So stop with the FUD.

1735,Side effects are limited from my knowledge.
1736,"Few got chills, fever, body pain."
1737,"However, we haven't heard of blood clots yet."
1738,The novel part of the vaccine is the adjunct Alhydroxiquim-II.
1739,That's what probably makes this better than the inactivated Chinese vaccine.
1740,Since this a traditional vaccine it should technically be much stronger around the variants.
1741,"Here is the tweet-

 https://twitter.com/ICMRDELHI/status/1384762345314951173?s=20 

Actually, there are other vaccines too."
1742,"We only have the mRNA, Adreno and traditional now but there is a DNA vaccine that India will approve shortly."
1743,"There is also Peptide, Nanoparticle, Protein subunit."
1744,There is also the E Coli based vaccine now coming up that might have broad protection against all corona viruses.
1745,Best thing is we can make similar to how beer is made.

1750,"I get you you think Europeans did it because they are kind, but why if China Russia India did it for their own reasons they are **bullies**?"
1751,"Yes, if you have somewhere you can isolate, go there."

1753,"Yeah it makes sense to a point and I'll be the first to admit that it really didn't help that over a year ago (fuck, I hope this ends soon) the media and science were all over the place and it felt like you were going to die if you looked at someone across the street."
1754,Remember the rumours and videos of Chinese people dropping dead in the street?
1755,I guess I thought people would start catching on.
1756,You're hopefully aware that blood clots are not created equally.
1757,The ones that are being caused by the vaccine are a special type of blood clot that emerges in the brain.
1758,"Its different from getting one in your leg, arm or even other organs."
1759,As having one in your brain is probably the worst spot to get them in.
1760,So to put them on an equal playing field is just ridiculous.
1761,Do you genuinely believe that if these were regular blood clots that multiple countries would stop?
1762,Exactly this.
1763,Now anyone can get their vaccine during their regular trip to a pharmacy.
1764,"We'll likely see vaccine administration rates start to taper off, but I think the total numbers will continue to slowly and steadily rise for a while yet."

1774,Comparing the two is not a false equivalence.
1775,"Blood clots can travel, that’s how they kill you."
1776,You can very easily get a PE from birth control or pregnancy and those kill you quite well.

1782,It's the same thing.
1783,It's a de facto  export ban.
1784,They keep upping their orders and those orders keep being moved to the front of the line.
1785,[Look at this story from December.
1786,"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-09/which-countries-have-reserved-the-most-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-is-32nd-on-list) The US was 32nd in the world in vaccines purchased, and had barely enough to cover their entire population."
1787,"The additional doses were purchased long after many other countries had signed their own contracts, and these contracts all got bumped down."
1788,"Saying ""you can't export until you fulfill our contract with us, and we can increase the amount in that contract any time"" is an export ban; there's nothing else to call it."
1789,It seems like locking down without some way of stopping infections was essentially just pushing the waves down the road.
1790,All it did unfortunately was burn up public sentiment towards another lock down.
1791,If we could do this all over again the best course of action may have been to tell people to mask up and socially distance and try to get on with life.
1792,Maybe in April do a lockdown/mass vaccination effort and end the pandemic.
1793,Obviously we know things now about covid we didn’t know at the start of this like how quick and effective the vaccines would be and how contagious covid is and actual fatality rates.
1794,Hopefully we learn from this for the future though.
1795,the problem with vaccinespotter is it basically doesn't work in indiana any more.
1796,it's still stupidly easy to get vaccine appointments here.
1797,"&gt; First off, I've seen first hand what a blood clot can do to someone."
1798,I take care of my mom who has had two.
1799,You can get clots when getting COVID.
1800,Some statistics say you have a much higher chance of getting clots from COVID than from the vaccine.
1801,"Sorry man, it's just not possible to discern this from an honest post."
1802,"It was not a few months ago, it's still ongoing, those people are in almost every thread."
1803,"Yes, clearly I am the one with unresolved feelings of self worth."
1804,"I thought the entire cornerstone of UKs lockdown strategy was to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, and not eliminating covid altogether."
1805,"Given that almost all vulnerable people will be fully vaccinated within a week or two, how is this a concern?"
1806,I don't understand this graph at all.
1807,The US  bought enough to cover 455 million people.
1808,That's bad somehow?
1809,Canada was number one on the list but they're behind where the US is.
1810,So is the UK for that matter.
1811,Clearly the US is doing something right.
1812,Which vaccine does Roche sell?
1813,"Yeah, this is the kind of people I am talking about, exactly."
1814,"This absolute obsession with masking, even in situation where no clear benefit is known."
1815,Where does it come from?
1816,Is the mask a symbol of virtue for you?
1817,Have you been suffering from the lack of ways to show your virtue and this has offered you a much wanted outlet for that?
1818,You can get blood clots in your lungs or PEs from birth control or from you know actually getting Covid and those can kill you pretty well.
1819,From a numbers point of view dying from the AZ vaccine is incredibly rare.
1820,You have a higher chance dying in car accident on the way to getting the shot than you do from the shot itself.
1821,"&gt;No, the argument is that ""it is infringing on my rights"" is not a sufficient argument in and of itself."
1822,That's a completely irrelevant argument.
1823,"This article has nothing to do with whether or not ""infringing on my rights"" is a sufficient argument."
1824,The article is about how people that believe it react to attempts to convince them otherwise.
1825,"Whether or not their argument is right does not change the fact that they believe it, and according to the study even attempting to convince them that they are wrong actually has the opposite affect than intended."
1826,"By trying to convince them they are wrong, you are only reinforcing their belief that they are right."
1827,"The question is, are you actually trying to convince these people to wear masks, or are you just trying to win an argument?"
1828,$11 billion is a rounding error when we're talking about government budgets.
1829,"given the consequences of not funding vaccine development and production that we're seeing around the world, I'd argue those other countries can't afford NOT to spend the money"
1830,I don't understand why this should annoy you.
1831,"The choice is not between vaccine A or vaccine B, but between vaccine A now or vaccine B at an unspecified time in the future."
1832,"If you've been offered the vaccine in the UK, then it's because you're either in an older or a more vulnerable age group."
1833,"By declining it, you run the risk of getting hospitalised with Covid in the time you wait for your vaccine of choice."
1834,"In arriving at current guidance, UK health authorities have concluded that people like you (meaning people of your age or with your condition) have \*more\* chance of catching Covid and being hospitalised in the next 15 days than of having a bad affect from the vaccine."
1835,And that's just for the next 15 days.
1836,"If you have to wait longer than that for your vaccine, the odds go up higher."
1837,In refusing the vaccine \*now\* you are therefore taking a bigger risk with your health than if you were to take it.
1838,"I don't see that this is in any way bullying by the NHS, and I'm glad to say that it would appear that for the vast majority of those who have been offered the vaccine in this country, they clearly don't think so either, because they've accepted it."
1839,Doh!
1840,Haha
1841,"the way japan's administration handled the whole covid situation is almost on par with brazil, they are lucky their folks wear masks anyway prior to the pandermic...."
1842,"The type of blood clots that people get from birth control, during pregnancy, and post partum, are a different type of blood clot that is less lethal and more easily treatable than the clots that the vaccine can give."
1843,Comparing the two is a false equivalence.
1844,"It's just a joke, its a quote from It's always sunny in Philadelphia."
1845,That's no how science works.
1846,"There is simply no evidence for outdoor masking having a significant effect, because it hasn't been found."
1847,"It's very hard to prove to opposite - and that should never be the bar for a public policy: you can't based wide public mandates on ""we are not sure it's not completely useless""."
1848,No my child masks at school where he spends most of his waking hours and is forming friendships etc 100% of the time 5 days a week.
1849,"Cool, I've known some random facts about the vaccine types but this explanation tied them up for me nicely."
1850,Thank you.
1851,"&gt; Edit: I should add that while Pfizer took no money from Warp Speed for development, the US did give them nearly $2 billion in pre-orders."
1852,&gt; Why be cheap trying to get out of a global crisis?
1853,Interesting comments.
1854,"In December, when the first vaccines were approved, the USA sat [32nd in the world in vaccines pre-purchased."
1855,"](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwqnnm.3Tre0/v1/-1x-1.png) 

So maybe it was the USA being cheap?"
1856,"But it doesn't matter, they upped that purchase later and still pushed their way to the front of the line, because who's going to stand up to them?"
1857,Absolutely botched vaccine roll-out plan as well...
1858,I think opening a third (if there is demand) certainly makes sense.
1859,And in-person schools can hopefully return to normalcy for those that are vaccinated and at low-risk.
1860,Curfew is a lot easier to enforce though.
1861,Compliance in The Netherlands was well into the 90%+ range.
1862,"The proposed timeline of radioactive material is along the lines of a banana each day for 40 years being tossed into the ocean, I thought."
1863,Sounds scarier than it is
1864,Will this stop the people in /r/indianews from bitching about how the US isn't exporting vaccines?
1865,"Is he shifting his narrative to ""I meant the fourth wave/hurricane as a global thing""?"
1866,That's what I am thinking.
1867,There's a difference between a blood clot in your legs versus a blood clot in your brain.
1868,The latter is much more dangerous and is what we're seeing with the Astrazeneca vaccine.
1869,Sorry to hear that.
1870,Especially frustrating if you're doing a road trip so you're in a car.
1871,Glad your family is safe though!
1872,Can you link to articles showing children and babies dying in large numbers in the US?
1873,[removed]
1874,Higher ed is an entirely different setting than priamry or secondary ed though.
1875,At the University of Amsterdam at least we sit in large lecture rooms for tutorials with 5 seats in between people and you only go there for 2 or 4 hours a day.
1876,Note that less than 1/5 the normal amount of people is actually in the buldings.
1877,The problem isn't really the time spent at uni but rather the socialising outside uni.

1910,https://youtu.be/K3odScka55A this is an incredible video I’ve seen describing why you shouldn’t base vaccine reliability off the efficacy rating given to them.
1911,J&amp;J was tested during a much worse time in the pandemic AND it was tested at a time when it had to also protect people against new variants compared to Pfizer which was tested when case numbers were lower and we weren’t worrying as much about the more vaccine resistant variants we have now
1912,what confusion ?
1913,there is a small chance of blood cloth the question is will you still take vaccine ?
1914,because i will cuz i don't care if i die
1915,It is a tough balance.
1916,"If you suspect a stroke, standard procedure is to do STAT head CT to make sure there's no bleed in the brain, then give an anti-thrombolytic (clot buster) to try to dissolve the presumptive clot that's causing the stroke."
1917,"Benefit is that if you do this early enough it might dissolve the clot, restore blood flow, and minimize damage from stroke."
1918,There are cases where someone with dense stroke symptoms like garbled speech and weakness affecting an entire side of the body gets the tPA and within minutes function is restored.
1919,"BUT, this is no ordinary medication."
1920,"It functions by dissolving clots, but that also means it may cause you to bleed."
1921,That's why they do that urgent CT first to make sure you are not already bleeding.
1922,"Now if you are having a stroke, the benefits of dissolving the clot far outweighs the smaller risk of bleeding."
1923,"But if a bunch of people are showing up with Bells Palsy, getting mistaken for being stroke patients, and are receiving tPA, then you've got no benefit, only risk, and some of those people may suffer catastrophic bleeds in their head for no good reason."
1924,[removed]
1925,And I'm responding to your vent and attempting to talk to you about why things aren't going the way you and many others want them to go.
1926,"Forgive me for bristling a bit at the ""wear your masky uwu"" line because it sounds very similar to how a lot of antimaskers talk about the situation."
1927,We should pay people $100 to get their shots and require it for kids attending public schools like we do with other vaccines.
1928,Those two things would probably get us to 90% immunity.
1929,UP
1930,I don't find any of these explanations satisfactory.
1931,Daily new cases and daily new deaths are both now 15X what they were a month ago.
1932,Cases are now 3X and deaths 2X what they were at peak surge in September and increasing exponentially.
1933,"Something changed over the last month and I don't think it can be attributed to more testing, holidays, or any of the usual explanations."
1934,We'd better figure it out soon.
1935,"That’s why I keep saying a metrics-based plan rather than a date-based plan, that way, when you hit the target metric or metrics, there’s no reason why you “can’t” lift restrictions"
1936,"True, that is the official procedure for strokes."
1937,They require immediate treatment and investigations later.
1938,"A driver’s license is literally designed to be difficult to forge and even then, it’s not considered proof alone and people with even valid licenses aren’t entitled to admission if the bouncer has doubt

The vaccine card is designed for having a record of which lot of vaccine they received in case there’s something like the Cutter Incident happening again so it can be investigated faster."
1939,Nobody signs it.

Also, it's not the same to run a sprint than a marathon :) so 1M one day is not the same than 1M sustained for 100 days"
1950,I hate those things with a burning passion.
1951,I always used a paper towel or a wad of tp to press them down again mid-wash because it felt counterproductive to touch them again.
1952,I support this as it would mean over time flue disappears completely.

1966,"Before the Super League’s failure-to-launch, the biggest story going in European soccer was the grotesque sight of the agent and the father of Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland flying between sporting capitals in an attempt to drum up as high a fee as possible for the powerhouse forward, and in turn, themselves."
1967,"Those faults, those problems — from wealth inequality to fan powerlessness to the desire of a cabal of elite clubs to be free of oversight and run their organizations for the sole purpose of turning a quick buck — will not go away either with the Super League’s demise or the pandemic’s approaching end."
1968,in my home state all the breakthrough deaths were folks in their 70s or 80s with pre-existing shit so this checks out
1969,Covid-19 doesn't care whether your country is the defender of democracy or not.
1970,South korea has had less than 2000 deaths while US has had more than 500k deaths.
1971,It doesn't make sense for one of the harder hit countries to give aid until they are safe themselves
1972,"
&gt;And for higher education I understand it as well."
1973,"Even though primary schools and high schools have proven to be huge corona factories this wave, the same could happen in higher education."
1974,"It is only one day per week with measures, mandatory distancing and voluntary mass testing (low compliance anyways), so maybe they can keep it out but I highly doubt it, as high schools have basically the same set of measures and they have not been successful."
1975,I mean I would have waited another month if needed.
1976,But when are those people we gave up our social and school life to protect going to help us with paying the cost of our education?
1977,I myself have to do an extra year of my HBO study to protect the people so it's only fair they do something in return right?
1978,"That context should probably be shared with that above comment then, it’s caused a lot of confusion and misinformation and hysteria, unfortunately even in me."
1979,As far as I am aware they produce consistently 2 mil per week in the UK.
1980,After problems at first.
1981,There is not really any productivity gain.
1982,And production sides inside the EU were always delivering according to contract.
1983,At least according to the EU and the subcontractors.
1984,"I am not aware of any speeding up by AZ, quite the contrary actually."
1985,For Q2 they expect to only deliver about twice as much doses to the EU with now twice as many production sides compared to Q1.
1986,An it looks increasingly like they will no meet those 70 mil doses by a long stretch...
1987,Most smoke is already burned - so it won’t burn more.
1988,"That being said, there maybe some trace particles in the smoke that may still ignite."
1989,"And if the fire is vigorous enough, it can pick up flammables and throw them around."
1990,"What would the reaction be if they give a detailed plan, and then the day comes and they can't drop the restrictions?"
1991,Because that's what they're trying to avoid.
1992,"2,563,671 administered (way better than yesterday!)"
1993,"87,592,645 and 1 🐉 fully vaccinated (26.4% total and 33.8% adults)

35,873,848 fully vaccinated seniors (65.6%)"
1994,"And this is London workers, who are more likely to live in tiny apartments with several other people, that are designed more as places to sleep when you're not working or out doing something than as full time homes long-term."
1995,I'd want to be back in the office if the alternative was sitting in my shoebox bedroom or with four other people in a communal living area.
1996,[removed]
1997,"""This one store on the indiana-illinois border is responsible for 30% of all Chicago COVID cases...."""
1998,You've cocked up your maths.
1999,I did a quick google and found about 12 million Germans are between the age of 25 and 35.
2000,So if you gave the AZ jab to all of them you'd get 36 deaths (based on 3 deaths for every million).
2001,This compares to the 153 in that age range that will die of it in the next 3 months (that you calculated).
2002,So the risk benefit is still vastly in favour of given them the jab.
2003,As I said for under 30s in the UK with much much less covid than Germany has the risk benefit has only just changed against AZ.
2004,Same thing is happening in Brazil.
2005,There is political war going on the judiciary about reopening churches to massive crowds of zombies that give their minimum wage to psychopathic religious leaders like Edir Macedo which also owns the second biggest tv channel and is a very close ally to Bolsonaro.
2006,"Bolsonaro himself prayed on his knees in front of the Governmental Palace with priests, saying that Covid would be over next morning."
2007,"That was last year and to this day he still hates vaccines, loves hydroxichloroquine, refuses to do a national lockdown and whatnot.He is a fanatic evangelical christian."
2008,There is not enough people talking about the impact of religion on this pandemic.
2009,[removed]
2010,"If you have questions about the effect of a particular drug itself, a pharmacist is better qualified for that than a general practitioner."
2011,"If you have concerns about it with individual medical history, you should be able to discuss that with your doctor without the wait required for a formal appointment and visit

And while pharmacists haven’t always been giving shots themselves, that’s because people got fewer shots."
2012,Pharmacists have been giving people routine vaccines for over 20 years now.
2013,"That’s not a brand new thing although some pharmacists still don’t do it at all

In like two months, yeah, it’ll make sense to have individually packaged doses so you’re not bringing a minimum of six out of temperature control at a time."
2014,Then it will make sense for doctor’s offices to have it on hand if they have a freezer that cold anyway.
2015,But this is still about the distribution of a drug.
2016,A prophylactic drug not for treating a condition but preventing it.
2017,The pharmacy is the more appropriate and accessible venue
2018,"You can choose, just keep booking until you get offered the one you want."
2019,No one stops you doing this.
2020,"You can book, turn up, hear what vaccine they have, cancel and rebook so you actually do kind of get a choice."
2021,"But once we have enough supply people will be able to actively choose, the UK government won’t offload the supply to other countries when there are UK citizens unvaccinated"
2022,India hasn’t vaccinated nearly as large a portion of its population compared to America.
2023,"Jerk and snap too, apparently."
2024,I wonder if crackle and pop are also increasing...
2025,"Consider that ""following the science"" rapidly means the public has to tolerate whiplash as data comes in and changes our understanding...

Don't think the public can do that."
2026,Hence policy decisions lag significantly.
2027,I love how quick data is spread and I also hate it.
2028,"Love it for me, hate it in the general population/media."
2029,In general people suck at changing their views as data comes in.
2030,Makes it more important to wait before saying anything.
2031,The flu is a totally different virus.
2032,"There are different versions of the flu such as type A, B and C. Covid19 is caused by one virus only, although there are different strains they are very similar to each other genetically."
2033,A vaccine for the flu targets the most likely seasonal strains.
2034,Vaccine for covid only targets one specific coronavirus.
2035,They're only mostly dead
2036,"Haha, yeah, just move out of state in the middle of a pandemic."
2037,Easy peasy!
2038,This is a vent post.
2039,Could be a good move for Canada / Europe.
2040,Too late for the US to make a change.
2041,"Nah, we need to send some to Mexico, they need it more"
2042,Barley Astra had 76% efficiency in the US and 100% over severe illness.
2043,"Was just reading a thread on Twitter about how actual covid deaths could be anywhere between 17,000 - 30,000 per day right now in India."
2044,"Crematoriums are burning people 10x - 20x+ the official covid death reports, depending on the city."
2045,We are getting there
2046,"Sure, for deceased that have family that are speaking up."
2047,But for unclaimed bodies piling up in a hospital mortuary?
2048,All bets are off.
2049,"Osterholm is full of shit and always has been, but tbh when we talk about the state of the pandemic, we should be talking about the state of the world."
2050,"Pandemics are, by definition, global."
2051,"The situation in the U.S. is vastly improving and coming to a close, but the pandemic itself is far from over, if only due to how bad things are in Brazil and India."
2052,So will the 2nd dosages really start to spike over the next couple weeks?
2053,Initial doses I'm guessing will start to dip quite a bit.
2054,Can't find vaccinated truck drivers?
2055,"If they're the ones spreading Covid, make it a requirement."
2056,"Remember, in the US everyone is now eligible."
2057,You just gotta get it done.
2058,If they can prove that second dose has no chance of causing same issues as first then fine I will take it otherwise I imagine if the statistics suggest that the risk is the same after the second dose the UK will follow Sweden/Germany/France and recommend a different second dose.
2059,Several states have ended religious exemptions to vaccination in the last decade.
2060,It's not completely on religious gatherings or election rallies.
2061,People stopped wearing masks and giving a fuck a long time ago.
2062,"Schools, colleges, local trains and everything else was opened with zero regards to mask wearing or social distancing."
2063,"People, including many scientists, acted like we achieved herd immunity just because we had low symptomatic cases and high seropositivity."
2064,This kind of arrogance gave perfect breeding ground for dangerous mutations.
2065,"Wow did you not read the headlines over the past few weeks, kids are starting to die in large numbers even babies are dying ...educate yourself."
2066,[deleted]
2067,I’d rather have a metric and a detailed plan for lifting restrictions than waiting for when my governor feels like it though
2068,&gt;room temperature for 2 months!
2069,"That's incredible, and great for places that lack electricity!"
2070,The EU paid a lower price per dose but in exchange the US got the vaccine first.
2071,The EU could've paid a higher price and got the vaccine first too.
2072,Maybe you should be asking your elected officials why they chose not to.

2081,For sure.
2082,My area many people wear them all the time.
2083,"I personally try to stay 6 feet away from people and will put on a mask if I can't, but I fully recognize i'm only doing that because of peer pressure, not because the science points to any possibility of transmission when I run by someone outside."

2103,"&gt;It really annoys me when people continue advocating for AZ saying stuff like ""it's still safer than catching covid"" or ""you have more chance of dying in a car etc""
&gt;
&gt;That's assuming it's a binary choice between the AZ vaccine and catching covid, which isn't how it works at all."
2104,"That assumption isn't implicit in the latter claim, which is true."
2105,"you've a higher chance of dying on a 20 mile car journey than you have taking the AZ vaccine, but people generally think nothing of those risks."
2106,"You presumably wouldn't, for example, insist a nurse come to your house and give you a Pfizer jab, rather than make that 20 mile journey yourself to get it."
2107,"So, I do agree that that reluctance is a strange one."
2108,"For that reason, I'll happily take AZ if it's offered."
2109,You do you though like.
2110,These people are not seeing what’s happening in India.. they are densely stupid
2111,The coolest door opener I have seen is just a sensor you wave your hand in front of.
2112,No touch and door automatically opens.
2113,I do not know if this is deliberately hidden.
2114,I do know that in the Netherlands you before your vaccination you have to fill in a form and tick a box if you agree to your information being used for research because of privacy laws.
2115,Not everybody gives this consent so the precise figures per age group/gender are not known.
2116,They should have a rough idea though.
2117,Your GP can get in contact with the JCVI and talk to them about giving his patients whatever vaccine they choose.
2118,I suspect they won't get far.
2119,"I'm sorry dude, but no one has an answer for you."
2120,There just isn't one.
2121,Epidemiology has too many variables.
2122,There isn't an on/off switch that's gonna get flipped in a few weeks.
2123,"They could make something up, but that wouldn't be ethical, or advisable, because if one of those variables fucks up the trajectory, people will be pissed."
2124,A good example of a variable that we didn't foresee was the pause in J&amp;J.
2125,"That, thankfully, was a pretty small one, all things considered, but it did cause the vaccine rollout to slow down."
2126,"The actual research was done in Leiden by the Dutch, but production is handed off to the Belgians to add on top of it too :)"
2127,"&gt; The outbreak involved a variant of the virus that has multiple mutations in the spike protein, of the kind that make the vaccines less effective."
2128,"Vaccinated residents and health care workers at the Kentucky facility were less likely to be infected than those who had not been vaccinated, and they were far less likely to develop symptoms."
2129,"The study estimated that the vaccine, identified as Pfizer-BioNTech, showed effectiveness of 66 percent for residents and 75.9 percent for employees, and were 86 percent to 87 percent effective at protecting against symptomatic disease."
2130,Unvaccinated people act as incubators for mutations such as these.
2131,It is not actually that rare.
2132,"6 young people died out of 140,000 AstraZeneca vaccinations in Norway."
2133,"I really do not think 6 people are killed in Norway for every 140,000 car journeys."
2134,That would work out to every car in Norway only being allowed one trip every two and a half years.
2135,A ridiculous comparison.
2136,And that too with extreme underreporting.
2137,"Two reasons:

1."
2138,Numbers fudging by the govt.
2139,2.
2140,People know that they are covid positive and it's obvious so won't get tested.
2141,"I have family in the state of Gujarat, and the numbers reported there are easily less than 10% of actual numbers."
2142,Cases &amp; deaths.
2143,India is likely having at least a million cases a day right now.
2144,"Won't surprise me at all if it is 2 million, even."
2145,"I can't imagine the guilt that a nursing home worker must feel just because she didn't get a readily available vaccination, and/or failed to use correct PPE."
2146,"The very fact that the variant isn't even ""one of concern"" informs us that getting vaccinated ASAP is of paramount importance."
2147,"We saw the first recorded death from P1 in Pasco, Florida reported this week: a 96 year old female."
2148,*This is how it starts.
2149,*
2150,"25% of all Americans are planning to refuse it

2158,In search of 1 Clemson/Georgia ticket in Charlotte in September.
2159,Man it’s gonna feel good to be in a full capacity stadium again
2160,"Honestly, as global vaccine production ramps up and a lot of the countries which preemptively secured their supplies are vaccinated, rich countries like South Korea will end up being perfectly fine."
2161,The thing with Korea is that community spread is so low that it *can* wait a few more months.
2162,"Meanwhile, in NA and EU, two orders of magnitude more people die per capita, and daily lives are interrupted by the pandemic more."
2163,"+1 for me, too."

2168,"So even though AZ got kicked out of Emergent, theyre not totally out of usa manufacturing, not the much urgency to find a replacement (no doubt a replacement helps increase total covid doses available)

2169,The main hurdle is not knowing exactly how they take to wane yet.
2170,Likely they want to be positive the immunity lasts at least 12 months before granting full approval.
2171,A study that tracks all the vaccine recipients at once against a similar control group over the same timeframe in the same environment of spread.
2172,I’m Canadian in the US for work today.
2173,Walked into a grocery store with no appointment and they gave me one (thank you).
2174,It was really weird.
2175,Maybe Sinovac isn’t really effective?
2176,l plan to keep my mask on afterwards.
2177,"Not for covid, though."
2178,"I went out with mask on as frequently as before pandemic, and I never had an allergy/flu/cold/fever during this whole pandemic."
2179,"I just hope that people around me wouldn't judge, just like how they did when I first put my mask on in Feb 2020"
2180,"Based on it having E484K mutation, I would say this is relatively good vaccine news."
2181,"Obviously sad that people died, but gives a good idea of what we can expect from the mRNA vaccines against variants with that mutation, which seems more and more to be “the” problem mutation as far as vaccine efficacy goes."
2182,"Yeah, a guy at work had a tantrum saying if they forced him to wear a mask he would leave and never return."
2183,He did this loudly and publicly.
2184,"He still works there, and he's been forced to consistently wear a mask."
2185,"Tyra Banks, is that you?"
2186,Vaccinations need to be mandatory for health workers like that in a nursing home.
2187,That's ridiculous!
2188,It has a higher efficacy than Pfizer?
2189,"On a positive note: if USA can ascend from Covid Hell, then any country can."
2190,Just wait on the vaccines to ramp up
2191,"Because look who’s telling us about our health, Bill Gates, Bill Nye, and Albert Bourla."
2192,No one even see the problem?
2193,1) That’s a single case report and who knows exactly what further complications this patient had post therapy.
2194,It still doesn’t explain the fact there is currently an IFR for this of about 20%.
2195,"Diagnosis is incredibly difficult

2) As I said, there is literally not enough data on second doses, particularly amongst those most at risk."
2196,"In actual fact, the last yellow card report actually reported 1 case post second vaccination."
2197,3) Countries are sensibly restricting the vaccine based on a cost risk analysis.
2198,"This is not some political move as you would like it to be, this is steeped in science and public health."
2199,"The world is in a pandemic with a lack of vaccine which drastically changes these risk analysis, if we weren’t in a pandemic and we could get access to better vaccines with no risks of course this vaccine would be chucked (Denmark) and indeed in the medium term it will be, it’s as good as junk in the medium term in the developed world."
2200,"In fact the UK is lucky other countries picked up these issues, it’s reporting system obviously doesn’t work as it was only after Europe nudged the UK that they realised that it was also happening there."
2201,"The UK is at herd immunity at a much greater vaccine related cost than Israel, the US, Germany and probably in the end France and oh the variants are going to fuck the UK up with AZ."
2202,"Anyway the damage is done for this vaccine, it’s more dangerous than Covid and the alternatives for a sizeable chunk of the population and that’s why we are lucky that health authorities have power and have restricted it unlike you who would happily see unnecessary death in healthy young people to get a pint in the pub"
2203,Oook so if it's so low and the united states is sooo bad then why do they need our vaccine supply genius?
2204,&gt;CDC recommends that children get four doses of polio vaccine.
2205,"They should get one dose at each of the following ages:  
&gt;  
&gt;2 months old  
&gt;  
&gt;4 months old  
&gt;  
&gt;6 through 18 months old  
&gt;  
&gt;4 through 6 years old

Hmmm.... kindergarten starts around age 5."
2206,Probably had your last polio vaccine at age 4.
2207,No need for the vaccine after that so no need for schools to require it.
2208,"Also from the same article...

&gt; Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000."
2209,So obviously the vaccine is still being administered.
2210,Both of my kids had all of their doses.
2211,"And finally, just because the US is polio free, that does not mean the WORLD is polio free."
2212,"As of October 7, 2020, there had been 441 cases of polio worldwide."
2213,"Since international travel is still an option occasionally, we still need to administer the vaccine."

2218,Husband and I contracted covid back in August.
2219,I received the Pfizer vaccine early January.
2220,My husband refuses to get vaccinated because he still has antibodies (he had the test done 2 weeks ago and results said he still has antibodies).
2221,His reasoning is why should he get vaccinated if he still has antibodies?
2222,The mrna vaccine is still “new” so he’s not going to get vaccinated.
2223,I’ve sent him many articles to read but he won’t budge.
2224,He also sent me videos of a Doctor backing up his claim about having antibodies.
2225,"Well, it’s his body, so I’m not going to force him or get into arguments."
2226,I just told him he needs to continue doing that antibody test often to see if he still has antibodies.
2227,Is there anything else I can do to persuade him?
2228,Or is he a lost cause lol.
2229,"What you said is true, but the problem right now is manufacturing."
2230,We are severely short on vaccines
2231,Are you really going to make the argument that the EU did the hard work and the US gets to benefit from it?
2232,The US literally threw 10 times the money into the vaccine efforts that Germany did.
2233,If the EU wanted first dibs on the vaccine they could've paid the same or similar prices that the US did.
2234,You should be asking your elected officials why they chose to pinch pennies.
2235,"I got my Moderna shot on Monday afternoon and was fine for a few hours, but had a terrible headache and fever by the time I went to bed."
2236,"I was sick all Tuesday, too, but Wednesday morning I was completely back to normal."
2237,"Hope your symptoms stay mild, that was a very not fun 36 hours."
2238,Asymptomatic Covid is a thing and much more common than you might think.
2239,"There's also cases like me, where I probably had Covid a year ago but tests were so sparse back then I was never able to confirm it, so I'm not on any official list."
2240,"I think 50% is a bit high, bit I wouldn't be surprised if 40% of LA has had it."
2241,During that winter surge it seemed like everyone I knew had it.
2242,"Please request your friends/family, whoever is affected to share their story on [https://covidspill.com](https://covidspill.com)

Most of these do not get the media coverage."
2243,"Somehow, a lot people think the second wave is not bad either."
2244,They are being irresponsible even with basic things as wearing masks properly.
2245,That team is consolidating all the personal stories to bring awareness and show the intensity of the problem.
2246,"&gt; When you're getting called out for your incorrect statements

I made no incorrect statements."
2247,"&gt;including from a doctor

A troll claiming to be a doctor."
2248,Or a dumb doctor.
2249,"Dude, i'm correct."
2250,I told you many times.
2251,Quite being an idiot.
2252,"It hasn't been linked to this specific syndrome, that is blood clots associated with very low platelet counts."
2253,"There are some other side effects that seem to be a bit higher in the mRNA vaccines though, such as allergic reactions."
2254,I live in an area that no longer has any state or local government mask mandates.
2255,"At the Walmart here, there is still a ""Masks required"" sign, but 80-90% of the customers aren't wearing them."
2256,I was just pooping can confirm
2257,"&gt; but you specifically said ""AZ is shit"",

I know."
2258,Because it is.
2259,I'm sure that you definitely haven't the slightest.
2260,They have been.
2261,Most counties are in 2nd or 3rd tier of reopening which is good.
2262,CA plans full reopening (with masks in some cases) on June 15th.
2263,This goes against pretty much what every health official said.
2264,"There’s just too many people in the US for this to be likely and it’s been going on for over a year so people who were initially infected will probably be infected again, especially with the variants."
2265,The good(?)
2266,news is that many people will be out of a job in the new post-COVID world.
2267,We could put those people to work being part of the distribution chain for vaccines for the next few years.
2268,Worked in a restaurant that was by a central business district that no longer receives enough foot traffic to stay open due to people working from home?
2269,Well now you can move pallets of dry ice for the next year or two.
2270,It's not the year but your assertion that this way of living needs to go on indefinitely even after vaccines and all roll out.
2271,0 risk life never was and will never be.
2272,The more you've kicked ass so far... the more susceptible you are to spikes as you likely have a higher % of your population with no immunity yet.
2273,At least until enough people are vaccinated.
2274,Am really sorry to hear that.
2275,It's unfortunate to notice how many such stories are going un-noticed.
2276,"Can you please share this story on [https://covidspill.com](https://covidspill.com) 

They are consolidating the individual stories that do not get the media coverage."
2277,To show the intensity of the problem.
2278,Please contribute by sharing.
2279,"The flip side of that is the US has more people who are immune due to infection, so it could be quicker."
2280,?
2281,"The CDC has: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html

Fully vaccinated people are allowed to gather *without masks* with other fully vaccinated people, and are allowed to travel without quarantining before or afterwards."
2282,Seems like some pretty significant privileges to me.
2283,"There have been cases, and deaths."
2284,But a causal link hasn't been confirmed.
2285,"It could just be coincidence, the same with any very rare events."
2286,"It.said they were vaccinated, but not if they had gotten both doses, or whether it had been 3 weeks following vaccination in order to develop full immunity."
2287,"But even if they were all fully vaccinated, the vaccines have between 75-95% chance of preventing symptomatic disease, but prevention of infection all together is lower again."

2295,*
2296,That's over the entire pandemic though.
2297,I believe here people are talking about current case rate.
2298,ie the last week or two.
2299,So this thing eventually becomes another coronavirus cold when it's no longer novel to the immune system?
2300,More reason for everyone to get the vaccine.
2301,"It's similar to when the native Americans first were introduced to the ""common cold"" brought by Europeans."
2302,It basically was like SARS for them due to the fact their immune systems didn't recognize it.
2303,"I’ve literally seen dozens of comments in this sub demanding that the US export more of its vaccines to Canada, unfortunately, saying the US is “selfish for keeping so many”."
2304,"Well, that's because people are falling sick."
2305,Duh.
2306,COVID-19 is a very common disease nowadays.
2307,Can you get Pfizer in a year if you got AZ this year?
2308,"&gt; The outbreak involved a variant of the virus that has multiple mutations in the spike protein, of the kind that make the vaccines less effective."
2309,"Vaccinated residents and health care workers at the Kentucky facility were less likely to be infected than those who had not been vaccinated, and they were far less likely to develop symptoms."
2310,"The study estimated that the vaccine, identified as Pfizer-BioNTech, showed effectiveness of 66 percent for residents and 75.9 percent for employees, and were 86 percent to 87 percent effective at protecting against symptomatic disease."
2311,It's not just that.
2312,We're also a county which means we have our own health department.
2313,"Most cities rely on counties for health management, and they can be stuck covering a large geographic area with competing interests (we're just 47 miles of non-park land)."
2314,We also have a very large homeless population with a lot of density so we have a lot of experience dealing with this outbreak and that outbreak.
2315,We were better prepared for something like this.
2316,Most vaccines tend to be less effective in older populations.
2317,Their immune systems are just not as strong.
2318,I believe there is data on most of these vaccines that shows a drop off in effectiveness in older people.
2319,"Yeah, the entire Bay Area is much closer to OR/WA in infection rate."
2320,SoCal and LA in particularly are much closer to AZ.
2321,Basically polar opposites.
2322,What about free riders?
2323,One vaccinated resident died though?
2324,I thought that the vaccines prevented death?
2325,Why is there no explanation about how that happened?
2326,[removed]

2328,"Compared to many other countries, Germany's prioritization is pretty simple and has only 4 different groups."
2329,"Denmark, for example, has about 18 groups."
2330,"My mom's on Vancouver Island and said the campsites near her were full Of RVs from Ontario and Quebec through November/December/January, when the campsites are usually dead at this time of year - presumably these were people who couldn't get to their usual holiday spot and figured wet and damp and just above freezing was better than -20"
2331,Why is California's deaths remaining stubbornly high despite its cases being so low?
2332,Is this just a data artifact from lag?
2333,It should be in the \~ 30/day range by now.
2334,[removed]
2335,"Yes, I'm aware that death is a symptom that may just happen to be relatively severe."
2336,Bad use of sarcasm on my part there.
2337,I'm working on it.
2338,&gt; I hope every country completely shuts down any travel to and from India.
2339,"Too late for that, sadly."
2340,"At the rate India is exploding with this, there's no way it hasn't already spread to most corners of the globe."
2341,The world has learned absolutely nothing form the last few years about acting quickly and decisively.
2342,What a ridiculous thing to say.
2343,Do you honestly think the people making these decisions in European countries are stupid.
2344,The chance of a young woman (under the age of 35) dying of Covid in the next three months in the Netherlands is about 1 in 4 million going on past statistics and the prevalence at the moment.
2345,"The risk of the rare side-effect of the AstraZeneca is about one in 60,000 in that age group."
2346,It is really not that hard.
2347,Giving them a different vaccin is the logical choice.
2348,As it is not yet entirely clear if this vaccin is any safer for young men they too will receive a different vaccin.
2349,What makes me most sad about that kind of person is that they're soooo easy to manipulate:  all you have to do is tell them NOT to do something and then they *have* to.
2350,And usually they are completely clueless about how easy they are to manipulate.
2351,Friday
2352,Neat.
2353,Why isn't FDA approved?
2354,I thought all testing and safety is done already.
2355,I’m not sure how a mask mandate comes into play?
2356,The feds have never had the power to impose a mask mandate!

2365,FWIW I teach undergrad and had a deaf student in one of my courses in the fall.

2367,Worked great!
2368,Maybe ask your school to consider?
2369,"Well, you would think, but that strain is already global and flights to and from India are happening at this very moment."
2370,"International travel should have been and should be suspended indefinitely, opened country by country at ""herd immunity."""
2371,Pretty sure the vaccine is sold at cost price?
2372,The effort it takes to forge the vaccine surely makes it prohibitive to make a large scale profit from this.
2373,Any idea on when to expect an update on J&amp;J?
2374,"Well California as a whole just didn't get hit at this time of year last year, including LA despite being one of the first places in the country with confirmed cases."
2375,There is some kind of seasonal or other factor at play that we don't fully understand yet as well.
2376,That’s awesome.
2377,The Indy 500 has always been on my bucket list.
2378,This year I’m getting back to Dover for NASCAR next month.
2379,"I’m not sure percentage wise what the crowd is, but I do know it’s greatly reduced."
2380,"Myself, my dad and my brother will all be 100% vaccinated well before race day (I’ve been done since January), so I’m stoked."
2381,That's black-and-white thinking.
2382,Not logically valid.
2383,Probably a lot more than the reports say
2384,This man epidemiologizes
2385,"Rather strange and illogical and a dick move for the gods to have made the default way to go to heaven an unnatural way of disposing of bodies, isn't it?"
2386,If a body being burnt was so *vital* then you' expect them to have made humans spontaneously combust when they die.
2387,But instead... no!
2388,If you die and there's no one else around and you just rot away naturally then it's an eternity of hell for you!

2397,"\&gt;unvaccinated worker causes an outbreak

What did we learn today?"
2398,WE LEARNED THAT VACCINES WORK
2399,[removed]
2400,...except they already have.
2401,"According to the CDC guidelines for vaccinated people, vaxxed people can meet *without masks* with other vaccinated people, and do not have to quarantine before or after traveling within the US."
2402,"Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html

To me, these seem like valuable privileges that restore a large sense of normalcy."
2403,"The only thing they are asking us to do is wear masks- which does make sense as there is the rare chance that the virus could continue to reproduce in the nose of vaccinated people, but is largely probably being kept as a rule because it would be nearly impossible to enforce mask wearing if not everyone is required to do so."
2404,"Think of all the people who were fake g mask exemption cards before- surely, they coukd do the same thing with these watermark-less vaccination record cards."
2405,"There's a nugget of uncertainty behind everything we know about the vaccines and their effectiveness, so you're going to see policies like this for a while yet, especially when the stakes are high."
2406,"exactly, give us the metric when we get out freedom back, or else, I won't get the jab."
2407,Ok.
2408,What are your referring to when you said bought but not delivered?
2409,Preferably with specifics to filter out politician lies.
2410,On top of my head it's astrazeneca but that have nothing to do with US.
2411,Many countries banned exports including China and EU atleast for some period of time the difference is that US is more strict and longer.
2412,I don't see a moral difference between short ban and long ban.
2413,"Good, some things should not have a single point of failure even it there are trust."
2414,Like EU gives farmers subsidies to keep critical food production alive.
2415,That should be done even for supply chains that isn't a big voting block.
2416,I just dislike that EU is so slow and dysfunctional like the French WW2 army.
2417,"I got my first dose (can’t speak for the second) at 8:30 pm, didn’t feel anything till 1pm the next day (headache and fatigue) my therapist who got the 2nd shot said she also didn’t feel any side effect until the following morning"
2418,Did you even read it?
2419,"There’s literally a paragraph on this point: “ But it’s unknown at this point what, if any, effect those DNA tweaks could have."
2420,"Many factors, including jobs that can’t be done remotely and lack of health care access, drive COVID-19 infections, he says (SN: 11/11/20; SN 7/2/20)."
2421,"And social factors, such as quick, strict lockdowns and widespread mask wearing, may have deterred infections in some East Asian nations.”

This study doesn’t take away anything."
2422,It only adds to a deeper understanding of factors that affect how the pandemic plays out in different countries.
2423,Agreed.
2424,It's most contagious before symptoms even set in.
2425,I like how that's important for Covid but everyone ignores the same thing with the flu.
2426,&gt;You referencing some idiot that wouldn’t even stop going to the movies like they’re a hero is just a weird confusion on your part.
2427,No need to play those stupid redditisms.

2431,"That said, I did buy an LED ""blacklight"" which I took on one trip to try to find the bedbugs."
2432,"However what I saw was far worse than bedbugs, the room looked like a crime-scene."
2433,I stoped taking that flashlight because I'd never be able to sleep in another hotel room again if I always used it.
2434,Weird that they didn’t lead with the raw number instead of the percentage
2435,I live in Maricopa County.
2436,"The majority of public schools are keeping masks, but many charter schools have dropped their mask mandates after Ducey's announcement."

2441,With vaccinations and herd immunity it’s not going to kill millions anymore.
2442,Government is going based on the statistics.
2443,"If anything, most governments in the US have been far more loose with restrictions than the statistics would have suggested was prudent."
2444,"In fact right now in Michigan that's the case - by numbers alone, we should be totally locked down again, at least for a few weeks."
2445,"But Whitmer isn't locking us down, likely because we're vaccinating so quickly, and also deaths are down a bit due to vaccination."
2446,"If I were governor, and had the ability, I'd 100% lock Michigan down right now."
2447,I can't imagine a government keeping any restrictions longer than absolutely necessary - they're ridiculously unpopular.

2569,What a fucking time to be alive
2570,I don't believe that women are more affected than men.
2571,The initial cases included many young women because AZ wasn't used for the elderly due to lack of trial data and because many health workers vaccinated were female nurses.
2572,Germ killers are only 99% effective.

2618,&gt; EU is not producing anything it's American/British companies with factories in Europe.
2619,Yes i know that biontech is German.
2620,"By that metric the US and China also produced 0 vaccines, but private companies."
2621,And private companies are not countries.
2622,It is the one or the other.
2623,"The EU does not have a flashy project called operation warp speeds, but it has invested billions into vaccine research and development."
2624,This is both for the EU and individual member states.
2625,So it is difficult to exactly point to number.
2626,It is just that we know it is a lot.
2627,[This site states](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/150747) that the EU has invested 2.7 billion euros.
2628,[This EU Commission document](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/research_by_area/documents/ec_rtd_cc-vaccine-development_factsheet.pdf) shows where some of the investments were spend.
2629,"Separately, individual member states have also invested a lot in to vaccine development."
2630,For Germany we are already talking about [over a billion](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/germany-boosts-investment-in-covid-19-vaccine-research-11600172209) [on vaccine development](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-spend-750-million-on-coronavirus-vaccine/a-53396167).
2631,"[Most of the funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-vaccine-s-funding-came-from-berlin-not-washington) for the German BioNTech vaccine also came from Germany and the EU, not from the US."
2632,The same goes for CureVac.
2633,"To make it even less clear, a small country as the Netherlands (pop."
2634,17 million) [has budgeted hundreds of millions of euros](https://www.rekenkamer.nl/onderwerpen/corona/coronarekening) for coronavirus vaccine development for 2020 and 2021.
2635,"Something you would probably never hear about, because you have to dig deep into unclear government websites."
2636,"Also, the EU contracts also include investment into production capacity next to the payment of doses (but these are not investments into development, so these are excluded) and the EU [has invested 12 billion euros](https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en) into funding to help develop and ensure equitable access to coronavirus vaccines."
2637,"Next to funding, the EU has also supplied a lot in terms of manufacturing."
2638,"They are on track to be either the largest or second largest of corona vaccines producers in the world, with dozens of factories all over the EU."
2639,"Also, it has also contributed a lot in terms of directly developing and researching vaccines."
2640,"For example it are European labs and researchers that developed the Janssen vaccine (Netherlands), BioNTech vaccine (Germany), CureVac vaccine (Germany), Sanofi vaccine (France) and Valneva vaccine (France)."
2641,"On top of that, some of the pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies behind other vaccines are partly from the EU."
2642,Examples are NovaVax (Swedish/US) and AstraZeneca (Swedish/British).
2643,Not a clear answer.
2644,But that is the point.
2645,"We know the EU contribution was a lot, but I cannot give a clear estimate on how much it exactly was, as it was done by multiple governing bodies under different programs under different levels of publicity."
2646,This is not good and probably a result of the complexity and bureaucracy of things within the EU.
2647,"But just because it is difficult to find, does not mean it did not happen."
2648,"As I am not a Governor, I am not measuring success the same way."
2649,I am dealing with bed bug panic and covid reentry panic now.

2656,On Monday my arm was still a tiny bit sore but I was otherwise fine
2657,[removed]
2658,CDC has civil enforcement powers so on it can sight and fine the cruise lines.
2659,The Coast Guard is also an option since they are responsible for enforcing health and safety rules at sea.
2660,[removed]
2661,&gt; Oh for sure.
2662,"I don’t think you’re who the article is talking about though- I think it’s more like vaccinated people who won’t see 2 also vaccinated friends without a mask even though even the CDC says that’s fine

I get the impression it's somewhat forward looking - an expect to see more of this issue in the future sort of thing (based on the behavior of the vaccinated now)."
2663,technically speaking the whole state doesnt have residency requirements.
2664,"you can be vaccinated in california no matter your residency status or citizenship status, and thats actually how it works in the vast majority of states."
2665,"they also cant deny you from getting vaccinated if you dont show id, and thats also how most state works."
2666,"that said, these facts arent well advertised so some people still get spooked by getting asked to show id even tho you dont actually have to"
2667,Yes that's what we need right now SEAN PENN!
2668,\s
2669,I think attributing it exclusively to anti-vax is a bit misguided.
2670,"While there is a concerning and growing cohort with that mindset, I suspect the real motivation is laziness and lack of care, particularly in younger, healthier individuals."
2671,"In fact, I expect you would find that the flu vaccine has far worse uptake in that group than covid."
2672,If you are in the Bay Area you can come to the Central Valley and get a shot pretty easily - my niece got one at CVS yesterday and didn’t even have an appointment.
2673,If you are near LA you can try Riverside - I hear a lot of people are having luck there too.
2674,"CVS, Walgreens etc don’t have residency requirements."
2675,This is the real truth about universal healthcare that all the people on Reddit who have it refuse to admit.
2676,It's also possible that a lot of Redditors with universal healthcare also have supplemental insurance and don't realize how bad things are without it.
2677,"I wouldn't say hesitancy, I would say apathy."
2678,People don't want to schedule an appointment for something that almost definitely won't kill them when they'll still have to wear a mask.
2679,"The ""Better safe than sorry"" attitude behind the restrictions has created a ""Why should I bother"" attitude on the public, and if politicians want people to get vaccinated they better catch up."
2680,"For me, I hate to say it, but there's been a lot of resentment all the way around."
2681,"At people who go out and party and congregate without masks like it's no big deal, thus prolonging everything for the responsible among us; at my wife, who took precautions to the extreme and wouldn't let me order takeout or go to the office for a year; at the courts (I'm a lawyer) who were anxious to force attorneys to start trying cases in courtrooms as early as June 2020 when it wasn't safe to congregate in a building; at the politicians in Florida and in the US prior to January 2021 who were willing to sacrifice my health and my family's health to improve economic numbers for their own political ends; and at all the news outlets who have fanned the flames of fear to sell clicks to the point where it's hard to even know how seriously to take the news any more."
2682,"&amp;#x200B;

I am just mad as hell at almost everyone, and I feel like a year+ of my life has been stolen from me."
2683,"I Just Got Covid, A Cautionary Tale: 

I'm a 23M who works as a poker dealer."
2684,I received my first vaccine two weeks ago and I thought I was nearly invincible after living covid-free for a year.
2685,Two of my coworkers tested positive and I started experiencing very mild symptoms (mostly a cough and tiredness.)
2686,"I took an antigen test and that came back negative, but I was still very slightly symptomatic."
2687,"I stayed home from work that night because I thought there was a chance of a false negative, but the room desperately needed another dealer (because of the two who were home sick.)"
2688,I felt pressure from my manager to come in but I didn't.
2689,The next day I took a PCR test and I just got the result: Positive.
2690,"I wanted to share for all the young people who may think they don't have the disease because:  


* Their symptoms were far milder than what they've seen in the news
* They had already gotten their first dose of the vaccine
* They took an antigen test very shortly after exposure or symptoms that returned negative
* They're young and their immune system will somehow deal with it

It's worth getting a PCR test!"
2691,"It only takes a minute, it's free, and it's not too uncomfortable."
2692,"Especially as cases rise, it's important to get tested as soon as you feel symptoms."
2693,Not too many other illnesses going around rn with the masks and such so if you feel sick there's a good chance it's corona.

2726,"Didn’t get a great night’s sleep that night, took off work the next day to nap and recover and I was good to go by that evening."
2727,I'm sure I have this to an extent.
2728,"Going to get Moderna 2nd dose on Thursday so will be... as good as one can be, two weeks from then."
2729,"But new cases still trending upward in my city, and only 21 percent fully vaccinated."
2730,"So it's still going to be a while before I'll feel comfortable resuming certain activities, notably indoor dining."
2731,"Already planning two small, at home reunions with friends who are also fully vaxxed in May."
2732,"To each their own, but taking small steps back toward normality feels just right to me."
2733,/r/pussypass
2734,"Today we have 272 million doses distributed, 213 million administered."
2735,That's a gap of 59 million vaccines.
2736,"A week ago we had 245 million doses distributed, 192 million administered."
2737,That's a gap of 52 million vaccines.
2738,"The trend continues if you go back further, someone else was doing an analysis on supply/demand."
2739,The supply pile is growing.
2740,Damn it why are things slowing down so much?
2741,I was expecting us to close in 250 mil by the end of the month.
2742,At this rate we'll be lucky to reach 230
2743,That's good for you guys.
2744,Hopefully everyone there who isn't anti-vax will be vaccinated by next week then.
2745,"I’ve been saying this to my friends and family for the last couple months, but we’ve gotten to a point in the pandemic where the US can just throw stupid amounts of money around to (semi)solve the problem."
2746,Don’t think we should be applauded for that lol.
2747,"Now, if the US participates in vaccine diplomacy once supply outpaces demand, then I think it’s something worth applauding."
2748,Why
2749,i dont think you are looking at the hard numbers lol.
2750,"on april 14th, the state averaged 408,000 vaccinations a day."
2751,"the next day, eligibility opened to everyone, and since then, california has climbed to an average of 495,000 vaccinations a day."
2752,"this shows that demand is higher than the supplies of vaccines, since our allocation has been flat for this week and it will be flat for the next."
2753,"in fact, we are actually looking at small drops in allocation overall, largely due to j &amp; j issues"
2754,cases are no longer the metric we need to be concerned with
2755,What is your source ?
2756,"I am from a rural area and we hardly saw 5-10 deaths, last year."
2757,This was also true for surrounding villages and towns in my region.
2758,Charlotte NC we have a Krispy Kreme vending machine
2759,Vaccine hesitancy kicking in.
2760,In my area demand has plummeted.
2761,I'm sure it's similar in most of the south.
2762,The outcome isn’t Japan being unable to produce the vaccine.
2763,Or any country.
2764,"They’d have to pay the same premiums as everyone else, as you’ve highlighted, but nothing was stopping them from paying Moderna to build a factory and scale production locally"
2765,Supply is 100% the issue.
2766,"&gt; However what I saw was far worse than bedbugs, the room looked like a crime-scene."
2767,"Just for the record, some detergents and other cleaners glow under blacklight, as I understand it."
2768,"Though, of course, I don't know if that was what was going on in your case."
2769,"Comparable to our worst year of influenza, around 81k/year for the US."
2770,"Break that down into a weekly average, that's the number we should be looking for before we consider COVID to be a manageable threat to everyday normal life, and get back to it."
2771,Right now we're a little over 3x that amount.
2772,"a lot of states that opened eligibility to everyone in march led to a big boost in uptake, but thats been petering off."
2773,"for example, texas opened eligibility to everyone in late march, and that caused a spike, as they went from an average of 200k doses a day to 300k a day for most of april."
2774,however that boost has petered off and they are now falling back to the 200k mark.
2775,a similar trend is happening to florida and new york.
2776,"fortunately, it hasnt happened to california yet, but you can probably find a similar trend in smaller states"
2777,Who would stop them from sailing?
2778,State police or fbi?
2779,Not sure who enforces cdc orders if the state doesn't comply.
2780,Yeah this is a worrying trend.
2781,Back to 3 million average when we were at 3.3 million four days ago.
2782,I am in Alabama now and 1/5 or so of the people I know are openly anti-vaccination.
2783,"Statewide, it's closer to 50%."
2784,We're at the point now where people are openly saying they refuse to get vaccinated.
2785,Minari is hardly a movie **necessary** to watch on a huge screen.
2786,Not really a spectacle movie.
2787,"It's pretty intimate, more than anything."
2788,"G vs. K was the first one, I guess, and even then, I'm not sure it was well enough executed to be worth it."
2789,2nd dose wasn’t even a sore arm.
2790,Absolutely no side effects.
2791,Felt completely normal.
2792,You’ll be fine!
2793,Now export it every single state
2794,And the virus circulating on the west coast where many of the first cases came in originated in China?
2795,And there’s some evidence it was circulating well before they caught it.
2796,What exactly is your point?
2797,Ugh.
2798,I really can’t stand people who claim to have a mask exemption.
2799,There is no medical condition that can prevent you from wearing a mask other than not having ears.
2800,Covid was spreading rapidly while the same mask and social distancing measures reduced flu to roughly 1 percent of a normal year.
2801,And it's not a fallacy if the person is actively lying and making propaganda against the truth.
2802,Acting in bad faith is a discrediting condition.
2803,Why?
2804,The US was ahead on the J&amp;J pause.
2805,No reason to think there won't be a bunch orange stickers on their vials now.
2806,I hear you.
2807,"And if given the chance, I’m still going to hang out with them vaccinated or not because my whole household is fully vaccinated."
2808,I don’t think it would be productive to lord over them and say I won’t see you if x or y isn’t met; it honestly might help MORE to show them I do trust the vaccine.
2809,"However, I’m concerned for my friends because they are in a high exposure job and what makes matters worse is they live with one of the friend’s mother who I’m pretty sure is also unvaccinated and has lung issues."
2810,So she is the poster child for will die if she gets it.
2811,same lol
2812,Well said.
2813,Ted nugget got fucked up.
2814,Supply is definitely not the issue for California.
2815,They are solidly middle of the pack in supply % used.
2816,https://www.vaccinespotter.org/CA/
2817,They don’t live near me so us hanging out in person isn’t really going to happen and I don’t think that would work even if they did.
2818,the list of countries with high enough vaccination rates that college-aged people would be getting them and who are also not using the FDA-approved vaccines is vanishingly small.
2819,"this would affect, like, chileans and Brits only, no?"
2820,Is he distributing the Cuban vaccine candidate?
2821,Minari was actually good.
2822,Saw it last week when my local theater opened up.
2823,Worth it!
2824,This post appears to be about vaccines.
2825,"We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines:

2826,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
2827,*
2828,That isn’t feasible at this point and anyone with an ounce of sense knows so.
2829,We don’t mask for other diseases even if cases aren’t 0 because humans are in fact social creatures that rely on facial expressions and connections.
2830,"I can’t tell if you’re a troll, mentally unwell, or both."
2831,lol supply is no longer the issue for some states.
2832,thats been that way for a few weeks now.
2833,"supply is absolutely the issue for other states, such as california"
2834,The individual response to events of the last year have been a great proxy for whether or not I share the same values with that person.
2835,It's helped me figure out which relationships I should be spending more time on.
2836,"If you're supposed to avoid alcohol for several days before and after the Jan, I would guess the same goes for other narcotics."
2837,I thought it was just me.
2838,I had lingering symptoms of body fatigue and headaches throughout the following week.
2839,"2nd shot was really bad for me; eyes became photosensitive, fever, bad body aches, joint pains, night sweats, extreme tiredness that I was bedridden for a full day, dry coughs, shortness of breath.. just the full package."
2840,"Putin not only president, he data scientist also.... comrade"
2841,I don't believe it explains the ~500k gap yesterday and today (vs previous week).
2842,"&gt;Millions die every year worldwide from the flu

Citation needed"
2843,Under control means zero cases.
2844,"Once that happens, I agree."
2845,That’s not the definition of a sociopath though.
2846,It’s a clinical term that is explicitly defined so as to only include a tiny fraction of the population.
2847,"Call the guy any number of vulgar obscenities if you want, but willful negligence does not make a person a sociopath."
2848,Because J&amp;J is 1 shot.
2849,This is becoming worrying.
2850,Are the antivaxxers going to prolong this pandemic this much?
2851,Google would of took you seconds and most think it's a dumb question....
2852,[deleted]
2853,"CDC has not released the 4/25 allocation numbers yet, but I don't think that will matter much based on the trends."
2854,Supply is no longer the issue.
2855,Facial expressions are a key part of human socialization.
2856,That’s just a fact.
2857,"Masks are essential right now and are the easiest containment measure, but they’re not natural and don’t need to be mandated once this is under control."
2858,I think up to a certain point none of this mattered because people can only take so much of this.
2859,It would have only ended with a vaccine.
2860,Yes!
2861,Tons on us at work had stomach pain after 2nd dose of Pfizer- some so badly they had to leave work.
2862,Nice strawman.
2863,Barkley Shut Up and Jab!
2864,The playground thing is so tricky.
2865,"I see so many kids wearing masks poorly (rendering it basically worthless), or touching their face a lot because of the mask (potentially making it more dangerous)."
2866,"In my city, they mandate kids over 2 wear masks on the playground."
2867,"I think I'd prefer to see it mandatory at 5 or 6 instead, an age when it seems like most kids can wear their masks more effectively (and recommended at younger ages if the child can wear it well)."
2868,"But then again, they're not ticketing for it here at all."
2869,"If people are isolated in their rooms, it shouldn't matter?"
2870,"We've had front-line workers at grocery stores, uber drivers, food delivery, medical staff, etc."
2871,Why would this be any different?
2872,"https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2021031201261/

&gt;If syringes capable of taking six shots from each vial are used, 4.66 million doses will be delivered by the end of this month and 12.25 million doses in April, Kono said."
2873,"In May, 10.74 million doses will likely be sent in each of the four weeks, and the supply amount in June is expected to surpass that in May."
2874,I have a friend who works for the government and with international relations .
2875,He said some european countries will open to almost all by July and most by September.
2876,Then he said asia will probably be a longer wait for tourism ..But korea and japan will probably be some of the first Asian countries to open up to tourism
2877,"Are the ""at this rate"" projections even any good now that the rate is not going to hold going forward?"
2878,Bruh
2879,I’m having a hard time coping with the fact that I lost a year and a half of college that I’ll never ever get back.
2880,So many irreplaceable missed experiences.
2881,&gt;My own “Christian” municipal council has publicly stated that it has no problem sacrificing the weak and elderly so the richer people in our community can keep their businesses open to make more money.
2882,Are these people anti-vaxxers?
2883,"There were studies showing UV lights kill 99.99% of covid in the air, if I'm not mistaken."
2884,I don't understand why airlines (or schools or offices etc) can't slap some leds in the vents.
2885,Wouldn't the extra protection lead to safer flying and thus help their bottom lines many times over the cost of some extra lights?
2886,[removed]
2887,"&gt; As far as hotels charging too much, hotels can negotiate with the government to become ""quarantine hotels"" and trade off 100% occupancy for set rates."
2888,It definitely should not be a free for all!
2889,Somehow I doubt the staff would be on board with being turned into a quarantine hotel.
2890,I mean the harm is that people think they're vaccinated and they're not.
2891,No harm from the saline.
2892,"The way that Pfizer is reconstituted, I expect there's more than a few examples of this occurring, and most will probably never be caught."
2893,"Luckily the odds of it occurring for both doses are incredibly small, so even if it occurs people will have some degree of protection."
2894, \&gt;At some point the risk will be low enough that we can get back to our normal lives and just live with it.
2895,"Thankfully, we now have vaccines that can make this an actual reality!"
2896,"Oh yeah, the bedbug paranoia and anxiety is very similar to the anxiety I often feel when it comes to that latent re-entry anxiety."
2897,"In fact, bedbug anxiety and covid anxiety feel very similar."
2898,I had bedbugs TWICE - the first was my very first apartment since leaving home at 23.
2899,The tenants/roomies who interviewed me and granted me the room didn’t tell me that had an out of control bedbug problem for OVER A YEAR.
2900,"Turns out, they were so deep in due to late treatments (and the treatments themselves being super ineffective and made it worse) that they were literally living in the framework of the house and thus were impossible to kill."
2901,"Had to throw all of my brand new furniture, mattress etc - about $1-2k worth of NEW furniture - in the trash, AND got a nice heaping dose of anxiety."
2902,Then I got them a second time in my next apartment because I bought a dress second-hand from a neighbor who had bedbugs and didn’t know it.
2903,The trauma flashbacks were INTENSE.
2904,"It took me YEARS to stop freaking out every time I saw a piece of lint on my bed, and to stop constantly inspecting my mattress."
2905,I can really relate to this analogy - it is the same type of hyper vigilance stemming from paranoia between bedbug and covid fears.
2906,"Kind of weird when a single Pfizer has better effectiveness than a single J&amp;J, but I guess we also might be required to prove ""full vaccination"" for certain things."
2907,The US has almost 600000 dead.
2908,Now is not the time for any country to boast about anything when it comes to this virus.
2909,It has been a global fuck up almost everywhere.
2910,"Yep, way too many people jumping the gun."
2911,"On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero"
2912,[removed]
2913,[removed]
2914,"Federal facilities, including parks, require masks outdoors when you can't maintain social distance."
2915,I'm hopeful they'll do this again since it seemed to be very successful
2916,No.
2917,The efficacy against any infection at all is 90 percent for Pfizer and Moderna.
2918,"I'm honestly not sure about J&amp;J or AZ, but the 90 percent figure for the mRNA vaccines includes asymptomatic infections."
2919,...and was a good investment.
2920,Every week of additional closure time is wildly expensive to the economy.
2921,It is worth throwing pallets of money at it to open asap.
2922,"Doesn't seem that way, seems like the dates keep falling further and further back even though distribution is pretty steady."
2923,20 somethings aren't going to the hospital or dying in any appreciable numbers.
2924,"It is a pain in the ass to find an appointment in the city right now, so why worry about it?"
2925,They'll probably get it at some point.
2926,Of course it was California
2927,The US isn't the land of have and have-nots.
2928,The have-nots get free health insurance from the government.
2929,"It's the land of the haves, the have-nots, and the people-who-spent-too-much-on-a-college-degree-in-basket-weaving-and-then-wonder-why-they're-working-at-Starbucks."
2930,Also ending the ban on vaccine ingredients.
2931,[removed]
2932,I can't tell if you're an anti-vaxxer or if you're decrying the poor messaging from public health officials.
2933,"If the latter, you might want to re-evaluate your methodology."
2934,"If the former, tell me now so I know to block you."
2935,"First dose of Pfizer: extreme exhaustion the evening of the shot, sore arm 

Second dose of Pfizer: horrific body aches (literally struggled to pick up a cup of water because I was so weak), chills, headache, no appetite, fever, night sweats."
2936,But it lasted only 24 hours and then I was totally fine.
2937,"It was weird how fast it came on and then went away honestly, but I’m glad it’s over and I am so happy to be vaccinated"
2938,"California has a mask mandate for any public space, indoors or outdoors (although the outdoor mandate is enforced as much as the speed limit on the freeways)."
2939,Sounds like Heisenburg is back in business
2940,America now has enough surplus covid doses to basically get Canada to herd immunity.
2941,I agree with you.
2942,"I watched the country music awards for about 3 minutes on Sunday and they went out of their way to show the ‘audience’ of fully vaccinated, socially distanced, mask wearing health care workers who were sitting in the nose bleed section."
2943,These health care workers have more than likely been vaccinated for months.
2944,"While I am sure state restrictions and insurance, etc."
2945,may have played a part in keeping these people 10’ apart from each other and wearing masks it definitely doesn’t encourage people to get vaccinated.
2946,If you want people to get vaccinated you show them in the front row in a mosh pit without wearing a mask.
2947,"As someone who is vaccinated myself and tries to convince folks about the benefit of it, I just don’t see how we’re doing anyone any favors by pointing out that even after you get a vaccine you will still need to be socially distant and have to wear a mask in the upper deck of an arena."
2948,Indeed.
2949,"A ""20% increase"" is not showing up in the data."
2950,Is it another case of a misleading fearmongering headline?
2951,Good News: The ol US of A is about to hit vaccine saturation in a couple months and will be happy to send our northerly neighbors a flood of vaccines soon.
2952,Bad News: It's not going to be soon enough for you to have a fun summer like we will in the US.
2953,Sorry bros.
2954,Yes it does have an effect.
2955,It lowers the hospitalizations and deaths.
2956,See Israel.
2957,Then restrictions decrease.
2958,These people you mention were never going to get vaccinated and are anti mask freedumb idiots
2959,"yeah, I mean, to be clear, I’d rather personally have mediocre healthcare and know my neighbor has it too, than live in a land of haves and have nots... but it definitely is not all magical rainbows and butterflies like some people make it out to be"
2960,Damn it I didn’t see this until 5:30!
2961,!
2962,I fully agree with you on accelerants.
2963,As a Canadian I am relieved how well the vaccination program in US has rolled out - after watching the shit show for the past four years I for one am glad to see America great again.
2964,Good job neighbours!
2965,"As for Canadians griping - we are not that far behind, please stay safe."
2966,"I took care of my father in law while he died from COPD, he was 62."
2967,Fuck tobacco.
2968,"He quit 18 years prior to his death, too."
2969,In a lot of cities masks are 100% required in stores and most entertainment is still closed.
2970,See Chicago as an example.
2971,"At this point, increased vaccination has no effect on reopening or removing the mask mandate."
2972,None.
2973,If you aren't worried about COVID there is no motivation to get vaccinated.
2974,Thank you.
2975,I greatly appreciate both your understanding of what we’ve been through and continue to go through and also your efforts to continue to be safe and help everyone and not just your own comfort.
2976,"We are hardly hailed as heroes now, now apparently we’re seen as nagging."
2977,"And just like I’m sure your daughter is, we are TIRED."
2978,"I wish we weren’t full, I really do."
2979,"But I cannot wish it away, we all have to do our part."
2980,I certainly hope my son's college follows suit.
2981,I will be looking at a vaccine requirement as a prerequisite for choosing a college for my other two kids.
2982,"Thanks to the vaccines, COVID will switch from a pandemic to an epidemic."
2983,"If COVID rates are not high in your community and you're vaccinated, the pandemic is basically over you."
2984,"If you're concerned about variants, not traveling to places where COVID rates are high just might be a good idea."
2985,What states have outdoor mask mandates and why?
2986,thanks so very much!!
2987,!
2988,Their point is that it should be spent more efficiently.
2989,PA just passed 60% of the adult population vaccinated.
2990,HYPE.
2991,There are companies (including be healthy usa) that have mix and match sample deals all the time where you can buy a few  different types of try.
2992,I found some KF94 masks that were comfortable and breathable (even when my nose is stuffy from allergies).
2993,I tried different brands and found that some masks feel better than others even though they looked the same.
2994,"Somehow they fit differently despite being the same ""style."""
2995,I think just trying a few different ones is worth it.
2996,I also always recommend people put the mask on and take a moment to relax and tell themselves they can breathe.
2997,I have asthma and the initial feeling of putting a mask on would make me feel like I couldn't breathe but sort of mentally working through it made a major difference.
2998,Now that I am used to it I don't have to take that extra moment.
2999,I don't feel like my breathing is restricted at all.
3000,"If the CDC keeps pushing mask mandates after vaccination, Yes they will"
3001,I was masking up in March.
3002,I got fully vaccinated so I feel pretty comfortable without a mask now.
3003,Starting to?
3004,Anyone watching this knew this was coming from a mile away.
3005,We needed aggressive communications and outreach stating weeks ago.
3006,"And I am sorry you can’t just keep matching Fauci out there, the hesitant are sick of him (even if it’s not fair) and we need new voices"
3007,You people are never happy.
3008,"Oh they're barely trying, something must be wrong."
3009,"Oh, they trying to hard something must be wrong."
3010,Just don't get the shot and good luck with the rona
3011,i had seen these and was curious about em - ill def check out - thank you so much!

3023,thank you so much!
3024,!
3025,Because they still have to wear masks at stores and capacity limits are everywhere.
3026,"They'll do the minimum required when required, but that's it."
3027,Setting even a modest vaccination target for dropping all restrictions would be at least some motivation for people.
3028,Im probably late to the party here.
3029,But I received my second dose of vaccine in the 3rd week of January.
3030,I tested positive for Covid today.. 5% chance.
3031,Until you consider my wife tested positive yesterday and has been vaccinated as long as I have..
3032,I'm sure we have a variant that the vaccine wasn't effective against but kind of surprised us.

3042,If you're unlucky you'll get it and die.
3043,Make peace with each other and god.
3044,And live your lives.

3046,Your government isn't gonna save you.

3106,And thanks for letting me know.
3107,Seriously made my day.
3108,:D
3109,Because I'm fully convinced the reason they haven't formally stated vaccinated people don't need to wear masks is because they're worried unvaccinated people will stop wearing them too.
3110,"They've lied about masks before, and I think they're doing it again."
3111,"There wasn't a scientific explanation for why masks wouldn't help prevent the spread of the virus, there isn't a scientific explanation for why people who aren't spreading the virus need to wear masks."
3112,I trust the CDC when they give me reasons to trust them.
3113,"Studies, evidence, logical conclusions based on facts."
3114,"But their reasoning for wearing masks after vaccination always circles back to ""You can't be too sure"" or ""We're looking into that."""
3115,"It doesn't make sense and I'm not going to have blind faith in an organization that's been dishonest before, I'll only trust them when they earn it."
3116,"If you call it ""picking and choosing"" to expect claims to be qualified with evidence, then sure, I'm ""picking and choosing."""
3117,Why wouldn't I be?
3118,We should have set up a vaccine passport system.
3119,"That way businesses could have opened up fully sooner and people could have seen real, immediate benefits to getting vaccinated."
3120,I'm sure the 500k dead people agree with your sentiment.
3121,"Yes,."
3122,Argentina is producing the AstraZeneca vaccine too.
3123,"The ivy league is a sports/academic division, so schools like stanford, duke, and the ""southern ivies"" like Virginia aren't technically part of it, they're just grouped with it due to prestige"

3126,It's better to just let tens of thousands of people die in car crashes rather than drive slowly.
3127,You act like this isn’t common in the US.
3128,Took my wife seven months to get in to a rheumatologist in a metropolitan city.
3129,Fastest she was able to get in.
3130,I haven't been able to find anything about this in the news media or scientific literature so I thought I'd pose the question for those who might know.
3131,Recently  there have been reports of very high efficacy claims about Russia's  Sputnik V vaccine.
3132,Much of this is attributed to the use of two  different adenoviruses.
3133,I know the  theory why the AstraZeneca doesn't perform as well is due to immunity  to the viral vector itself.
3134,"So, let's say someone was able to get a two  doses of either the ChAdOx1 AstraZeneca vaccine, the Ad26 J&amp;J  vaccine, or the Ad5 CanSino vaccine."
3135,Would one be able to expect a similar level of efficacy as the Sputnik V vaccine?
3136,"In  the same thread, could the combined Sputnik/AstraZeneca trials in  Russia and Azerbaijan be an example of planing for a 3rd adenovirus  booster for the future as immunity wanes?"
3137,thats definitely true for the young.
3138,"however, the young do not constitute everyone who hasnt been vaccinated yet, and there are a lot of 40, 50, and even 60 year olds who havent gotten the jab."
3139,"for them, you cant really blame laziness as much as hesitancy since well, they will probably tell you that they aint getting it lol"
3140,"I mean, on one hand I do agree with you that they should be pushing the benefits of the vaccine rather than playing up the risks."
3141,"But if the vaccine-hesitant are already forgoing masks and refusing to social distance, then what would announcing the end to those recommendations do to inspire people to get vaccinated?"
3142,Some of us never really were able to “leave”.
3143,"Essential workers never had the option to lockdown, we just had to continue on."
3144,How do people think that while they were holed up inside the groceries kept coming and the light and water stayed on?
3145,Essential worker were never given their due!
3146,Would you liked to have been in the US the prior 9 months?
3147,We are like only a month behind the US in our vaccination program.
3148,Plus we had way less diseases burden here.
3149,Without EU funding and/or European research/labs and companies the Pfizer and Janssen candidates would not have even existed.
3150,So these two are literally the EU candidates as well.
3151,Only Moderna is a purely American candidate.
3152,"Did you actually know that all the production steps for Moderna are being done by Lonza, a Swiss company, for both the US and Europe."
3153,But does all this matter?
3154,No.
3155,"The EU was just slower at buying vaccines, which means we will be exactly one month behind the US in terms of our vaccination program."
3156,"It is not a huge amount, but it is still significant whatsoever."
3157,"I am sure that if we knew from the beginning the EU would not take the lead or fail at buying vaccines, the rich EU countries where most of the production is (e.g."
3158,Belgium/Netherlands/Germany) would have been able to vaccinate and receive vaccines at a much higher rate earlier (just like during the swine flu vaccination program).
3159,But that wouldn't be fair for the EU as a whole.
3160,"if you trust the cdc on that part, why dont you trust the cdc on the part about wearing masks after being full vaccinated?"
3161,sounds like you are just picking and choosing what you want to hear.
3162,why dont you just follow the science like you used to?
3163,And politicians need to start addressing that if they expect younger Americans to get vaccinated.
3164,"A lot of users on this subreddit are content to just say the apathetic are stupid and lazy or whatever, but that isn't solving *anything* at all."
3165,The apathy exists and if it isn't being addressed that's a big problem.
3166,We have fast tracked approvals and surrogates in analysis and then severely lack on the phase 4 follow up studies.
3167,In fact over 1/3 of phase 4 studies the fda requires as a part of approval are never even done.
3168,The US Food and Drug Administration offers four primary pathways that can expedite the development and review of qualifying drugs.
3169,"The pathways are: orphan drug designation (intended for drugs treating rare diseases), priority review (guaranteeing no more than six months of drug application review time for drugs seeming to offer a therapeutic advance over available therapy), and fast track and accelerated approval (for drugs treating serious or life threatening conditions)."
3170,"&gt;As noted in two major reports of deficits in the FDA's capacity for postmarketing safety surveillance,29,30 ongoing assessments of drug risk are not conducted systematically."
3171,"As  a result, if a safety problem is not detected during the initial preapproval evaluation, it may not be fully defined or included as a prominent warning for years afterward, as occurred with the risks of potentially fatal drug–drug interactions with mibefradil (Posicor, Roche) and terfenadine (Seldane, Hoechst Marion Roussel), myocardial infarction or stroke with rofecoxib (Vioxx), hepatotoxicity with troglitazone (Rezulin, Warner-Lambert), and rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin (Baycol, Bayer AG)."

3204,I do agree seasonality is a huge issue as well.
3205,But of course lockdowns work.

3362,Again I don't think thats really at issue here.
3363,"Likewise, what even defines a ""hint of anti-masking"" and ""bad faith"" here?"
3364,"Let's say, hypothetically, that we hit a point in June or July where community spread is minimal and all but the vaccine hesitant have some form of resistance to covid and you have a section of the scientific community saying that we have to continue to all wear masks until covid is 100% eradicated and another saying that the social costs to that are too high."

3419,I almost think that Japan saw an opportunity to solve their old population problem.
3420,Does it say did the vaccinated people get serious symptoms?
3421,Herd immunity.
3422,If you look at cases per capita for the US it's relatively similar amongst all the big states despite lockdowns or mandates or lack thereof.
3423,Michigan didn't hit herd immunity earlier on like the rest of the big states so they are suffering now.
3424,Florida and Texas had insane summer numbers so were better able to handle the winter surge than say California where they went into winter with effectively no herd immunity.
3425,I don't know about that.

3433,The explanation of why the vector DNA vaccines are safe is that the human organism has been exposed to the wild versions of adenovirus viruses for a very long time.
3434,"However, that does not apply to the engineered adenovirus vector which carries the DNA of the corona spike protein into the cell nucleus."
3435,"If I understand correctly, corona viruses are RNA viruses which replicate in the cell cytoplasm and not the cell nucleus."
3436,"Thus, the question is, could it not be that the corona spike DNA entering the cell nucleus causes problems such as the blood clots?"

3448,indeed vaccines are not useless but reinfection is totally possible.
3449,"not certain, but possible."
3450,They will likely combine it with the flu shot and I would expect half the people will end up getting a booster every year.
3451,Only those that are older or work in healthcare will feel the need to always get it.
3452,Look to Sweden maybe?
3453,They are (again) the worst hit in Europe now...
3454,"Well thats kinda natural, more infections means more chances for mutation."
3455,Though Lithuania is a small country so i think this is more of a bad luck that it happened there.
3456,thanks for reporting this.
3457,It is indeed concerning but not unexpected.
3458,Mutations will happen again and again but my interpretation is that the vaccines do work and also against the current variants.
3459,you may test positive but you should get a bad flu or nothing at all (in fact the vaccinated people show no symptoms at all in this case) as the immune system already knows what to do without going crazy.
3460,And that's the miracle of the vaccines.
3461,Yeah it might be risk tolerance.

3478,"I agree with your post, someone needs to tell that to Biden and the CDC because they are still saying for the most part that even AFTER you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask, stay home, don't gather in crowds/groups, etc..."
3479,"I do think it is going to make people not get their vaccine because they are figuring, ""why should I get a vaccine if I still have to wear a mask the rest of my life, avoid crowds, stay at home, etc., etc"""
3480,I just read my area wants to drop the mask mandate when 50 percent are vaccinated.
3481,Given we only have 30 percent vaccinated now and we've already hit a demand wall he has warned this could last until end of summer when the 12-15 year olds get vaccinated.
3482,Personally I'm dropping the mask after next month.
3483,I'm over it.
3484,Gottlieb is my boy
3485,The only question is why did wuhan got hit so bad?
3486,Maybe all of wuhan where infected since like summer 2019 and most people where asymptotic.
3487,So what's up with states like Florida and Texas not basically being piles of dead bodies after months of being not locked down or really enforcing much of a mask mandate?
3488,You'd think all their hospitals would be full 24/7 by this point.
3489,Correct.
3490,99.3% of them.
3491,Curfews are an odd one.
3492,"On one hand, they concentrate people so actually may be counter-productive."
3493,"On the other hand, they make it more awkward to go out and about, so reducing contacts."
3494,I think we should have focused much more on indoor vs outdoor.
3495,Of course that raises uncomfortable questions about offices and classrooms.
3496,"&gt;Roche and Boston-based partner Atea Pharmaceuticals (AVIR.O) are hoping their AT-527 pill could offer an anti-viral therapy to treat COVID-19 patients that would be easier to administer and cheaper than other prospective treatments, such as antibody cocktails or Gilead Science's (GILD.O) remdesivir."
3497,"In an interview in Swiss media in early March, Roche Chairman Christoph Franz had offered the tantalizing prospect of data on AT-527 ""within the next weeks"", saying he dreamed of being able to fight the pandemic with a pill by year's end."
3498,"But Britain's success in reducing case numbers with a swift vaccination programme and strict lockdown meant it was taking longer than expected to collect data from the trial there, said Bill Anderson, head of Roche's pharmaceutical division."
3499,I wish I could upvote this more.
3500,"It is kind of disturbing as an American to hear your CDC director say almost everyday ""The worst is yet to come, we aren't out of this yet for a long time, we expect it to get worse""."
3501,"It's even more alarming that the message AFTER complete vaccination is still - ""stay home, keep your social distance, don't eat inside a restaurant, etc.. etc..""."
3502,"That type of messaging I worry is telling people ""why should I get a vaccine?"
3503,I was already doing all this stuff before.
3504,"Why get one if It doesn't change anything"" ?"
3505,Jesus man!
3506,Are you intentionally playing dumb or something?
3507,The US has hoarded multiple times more supply than needed to manufacture 300 mn doses.
3508,Thats the whole point of the argument.
3509,"Let's say you need 100,000 pounds of RAW materials to produce 300 m doses."
3510,The US has hoarded 3 million pounds of RAW material since late last year.
3511,"Even if the US lifts its ban now and starts exporting, it wouldn't create a single dent or wave in their rollout."
3512,"It is still going to get 200 m doses of Pfizer and Moderna, 100 m doses of JNJ."
3513,That's what the world is urging to US.
3514,Atleast resume partial supply and let companies like Serum Institute of India start manufacturing large scale so they can save thousands of lives down the months.
3515,Is it really that hard to understand how America has selfishly hoarded RAW materials despite securing and receiving majority of their doses according to their deals?
3516,And PS5 is a commodity of Luxury and Vaccines aren't.

3521,Nobel would go to the scientists that did the original mRNA research.
3522,The famous persons today used the mRNA on COVID but that is not as scientific significant.
3523,"I hope you are right, but I really don't see it."
3524,I think masks in public will be part of life in America for years to come.
3525,"Maybe not necessarily outdoors or at outdoor gatherings, but inside stores, restaurants, etc."
3526,"You have to remember that even if the government one day changes their mind and says ""We don't think you need a mask anymore"", that does NOTHING to stop private businesses and stores to require it."
3527,Some states have already made masks part of their permanent law for workplace safety.
3528,"When Texas dropped the mandate, individual stores still said ""we will still require them""."
3529,"So because of that divide right there, I still think that one day the government won't require it per say,  but private businesses, Wal-Mart, etc., still will."
3530,I see Denmark are full speed ahead with Coronapas.
3531,How do our Europeans here feel about the possibility of it being rolled out across the EU?
3532,"I've spent a lot of time in Germany where individual privacy is really important so I'm struggling to gauge how it will go down there, for example."
3533,The manufacturer had orders from other countries and they fulfilled them.
3534,Govt of India was often using those deliveries as a PRb exercise.
3535,Plus they did not place a big enough order or help the manufacturer with funds to increase capacity.
3536,"Now they've asked the manufacturers, SII, to stop fulfilling commitments."
3537,Technically true (although for how much longer?)
3538,but you've got to fight to realize it.
3539,Hospitals and other healthcare providers are keeping quiet about this and billing patients and their families as usual.
3540,We need to start thinking now about what the plan is if vaccinations continue to slow down.
3541,"It simply cannot be the case that restrictions continue and we all have to wait to get from 60% vaccinated to 80% vaccinated, which will happen at a glacial pace."
3542,"Someone (preferably at the federal level, but a coalition of states would be a good start) needs to say: We're opening everything on July 1st."

3547,"That could have been known last year, if people hadn't decided to burry their head in the sand."
3548,I sometimes have the impression that the history of the pandemic is a history of denial.
3549,"&gt; The U.S. has entered a precarious limbo period in the pandemic, with the nation teetering on the edge of a tipping point to win the battle against the virus, or succumbing to yet another deadly surge."
3550,India has only vaccinated less than 9% of it's population with the first dose.
3551,"Plenty of unvaxxed or newly vaxxed people, young and old to suffer from this."
3552,"Some people are just really good about following the rules, even if the rules are stupid."
3553,"It will probably never be fully eliminated, it isn't as serious as smallpox or polio which were largely eliminated through persistent vaccination campaigns."
3554,"Covid affects the elderly far more than the young, and over time the elderly will be either vaccinated, recovered or will die, leaving the next generation that is at least partially if not fully immune, and any cases among them will be less severe, more like common cold and flu."
3555,"Depending on what happens with variants and how serious it is there could be booster shots, maybe just one or maybe annually or every few years."
3556,Many believe it will just turn into a common cold or flu.
3557,Got my 2nd shot of Pfizer yesterday.
3558,"Arm is kinda sore around injection site but thats it, no other side effects so far."
3559,Similar here in Delhi as well
3560,Hysterical hyperbole is not helpful.
3561,"Just before anyone panics, ""major"" as in it having the same or similar mutations as the current escape variants (e.g."
3562,"Brazil, South Africa, India)."
3563,"Not as in ""vaccines are useless"" or ""reinfection is certain""."
3564,"It's really too early to draw those kinds of conclusions though, especially considering how many mitigation measures are still in place that we've never used for the flu."

3567,"Here in SF everyone wears a mask, indoors or outdoors, with the only exception being when eating or drinking and I am proud of my city for this."
3568,"Meanwhile when I went back to university in Socal this year, like a third of the people I saw didn't wear masks outside."
3569,It is no surprise to me that Socal did so terribly during this entire pandemic.
3570,"Prime minister's target is to make India a manufacturing hub, so i think it was a way to show the world that India is capable of mass production."
3571,"I got vaccinated with Sputnik V, and my antibody test came back positive."
3572,To be fair the UK hardly had any vaccine manufacturing capacity prior to covid and invested heavily in getting whatever they have now up and running.
3573,And they are still exporting tons of raw materials necessary for other places' manufacturing.
3574,"USA on the other hand, sitting on tons of unused and unapproved doses that may never actually even be approved and blocking raw material exports leading to hugely reduced manufacturing capacity in primarily India."
3575,It works if people do it.
3576,"Here in California barely anyone uses the mobile Covid app, making it basically pointless."
3577,And CA is one of the US states where you would expect it to be used the most.
3578,Of course you can go the Singapore/Taiwan/Korea route of making it mandatory but that probably wouldn't fly in most Western countries...

3605,"is a pretty old saying, so there's nothing new about this."
3606,Basically all of the vaccines no matter how they are made stimulate the immune system in the same way.
3607,It is just different ways to deliver the same thing to get it to react the same way.
3608,You can cook a potato in the oven or in the microwave or in a saucepan and it looks and tastes different but it's still a potato.
3609,UK is not blocking any export of vaccines.
3610,"And technically EU (though technically not country) is, even though just a few of them."
3611,"Putting aside your ignorance and lack of information, its easily accepted that Government of India didn't do enough for preventing the wave."
3612,"However, the country itself has exported more than 65 million doses, when it could've easily used it on its own people."
3613,Do you understand the term herd immunity?
3614,The pandemic isn't truly over unless we share supplies.
3615,India having so little still shared with the world.
3616,While the US having covered its majority and vulnerable population is still hoarding supplies.

3633,"I get the frustration around this but if there were any interruption in the manufacturing or use of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, such as what has happened with J&amp;J (they've had both problems), vaccinations in the US would abruptly stop."
3634,AZ is the backup plan and is about one week's supply at the current pace.

3638,What are you even talking about?
3639,You are literally comparing two very different things!
3640,The problem is that the EU and the world is not getting their vaccines on time due to US banning exports and hoarding supplies.
3641,This has nothing to do with pricing and funding.
3642,Although the EU specifically invested 2.7 bn in BionTech.
3643,Stop peddling misinformation.
3644,"The EU was only a month behind striking deals the vaccine makers but are getting fucked by ""*months*"" delay in deliviries due to US hoarding."

3646,You are spouting the same nonsense again and again.
3647,Let me give you an example.
3648,"If you book a car a day after your american friend and the manufacturer says that you'll get the car 3 months later than the american because the american is hoarding all the supplies needed for building a car, inspite being booked only after a day, you'll be rightfully pissed."
3649,Stop peddling misinformation man!
3650,Just read the comments and the sources given by reputible news outlets.
3651,The EU is going above and beyond its limits to bring this pandemic under control.
3652,"To add to this, US has loaned out 4M doses but is [sitting on ""tens of millions"" as of March](https://apnews.com/article/us-allies-coronavirus-vaccine-supply-96e0d1594748dd2c8ccf47d62b8d5fb0)."
3653,"So yeah, a lot more the US can be doing."
3654,"We're already starting to hit the point where supply outstrips demand, so I don't know how anyone can justify the US sitting on AZ."
3655,"First Moderna shot, the arm pain was insane."
3656,It hurt like hell going in and for days afterwards every time I moved it.
3657,"I honestly wonder whether the woman who did it screwed it up somehow because, 5 weeks on, I still have a bruise and it hurts when I move it a certain way!"
3658,"Other than that, I had a headache and felt flu-ey and utterly exhausted for about 24 hours."
3659,"Right on schedule, a week later, I got ""Moderna arm"" which lasted a couple days."
3660,"Shortly before the 2 week mark I had a few days of feeling awful - weak, exhausted, nausea and generally feeling like shit."
3661,"Not all that unusual for me really, especiallly right before my period, but I had 2 or 3 full on the whole room is spinning dizzy spells which really scared me because I've never, ever experienced that before."
3662,My period seemed much heavier than usual.
3663,But I honestly have no idea if these were vaccine side effects or entirely unrelated.
3664,I got the second shot on the other arm and though it was sore it was nowhere near as bad as the first.
3665,"I got the ""Moderna arm"" reaction after 3 days and it was nowhere near as bad which, again, is apparently how it is for most people."
3666,"The headache and exhaustion was not as bad as the first shot, but I got the chills pretty badly the first night and had a lot of body aches the first few days."
3667,It's been a week now so I hope I don't have to worry too much about any other side effects but I'm a bit worried about what the next 2 week mark/period brings...
3668,Reality is often terrifying and uncomfortable when one ignores it for too long.
3669,I hope everyone pays attention this time and actually works together collectively rather than individually.
3670,The global community did a poor job in taking this seriously the first time around and now we are stuck with triple mutation realities on multiple continents with God knows how many animal to human bounce backs.
3671,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html
3672,"Also if you wear the mask over your nose as well, you can limit the amount of viral exposure."
3673,Damn this sounds bad.
3674,"Most likely either intermittent booster shots (1-3 years), if mutations are relevant, or herd immunity keeping epidemics local and sporadic, if it's just about waning immunity over time."
3675,"Complete eradication is not really plausible, as it will most likely bounce back from animal reservoirs."
3676,a mask (N95) and the risk of getting acne while saving your life sounds more like some hysterical stand to defend himself from something that's still not clear to me.
3677,just like the covidiots it's hard to classify this kind of people and why they come up with absurdities like this one.

3679,I just hope he doesn't have a car.
3680,I can't see anyone who smokes that much being able to safely operate a motor vehicle.
3681,The doses in question were purchased by and are owned by the US government.
3682,The contracts the US signed include clauses saying they cannot be exported and used outside the United States;  this is because the US got a discount and better terms in exchange for waiving all manufacturer liability.
3683,"The US is working on solutions for using these doses anyway;  they have “loaned” some to Canada and Mexico, which skirts the contractual clause."
3684,"The US is also providing vaccines to neighboring countries in other ways:  as one example, they have also begun vaccinating Canadian truck drivers (North Dakota is currently piloting that idea)."
3685,"Northern Beaches Sydney (where I got caught in the one tiny corner of Australia over Christmas 2020) would maybe be the upper limit of micro, Victoria was definitive macro and possibly the realistic upper limit of that."
3686,And it was probably only possible because the Victorians did take and execute it quite seriously and the other states slammed their borders shut to it with in effect only tight transit controls.
3687,And it still took months with a number of persistent pockets of disease and flare ups before it finally months later dropped to zero and stayed there.
3688,Border area residents may wind up crossing over and getting jabs from US sites that already seem to make up their own rules.
3689,"Soon vaccine appointments will go unfilled and at that point if you can get across the border, I like your chances."
3690,A lot of my friends got vaccinated ahead of schedule because they put themselves in the right place at the right time.
3691,Expiring doses find their way into most any arm.
3692,But you gotta put yourself out -- not wait for someone to contact you.

3755,Here in Melbourne (Australia) we've recently removed our mask mandate for everywhere except for public transport/rideshare and many healthcare settings.
3756,"Life has pretty much returned to normal here, except that I need to wear a mask on the train to and from work."
3757,I'm currently getting over covid (isolation ended a week ago) and lost a filling tonight.
3758,What are the odds of me seeing this tonight?
3759,"We had a 7 day rolling average of 950,000 the day Biden took office."
3760,We cracked the million dose a day average mark two days later.
3761,100 mil in 100 days was a foregone conclusion already.
3762,&gt; Being vaccinated effectively means you aren't spreading the virus.
3763,The benefit from wearing a mask after being vaccinated is negligible.
3764,Do you think the CDC needs to learn a thing or two from you?
3765,Because I trust they're correct to say that being vaccinated effectively eliminates spread.
3766,"And if getting vaccinated somehow *doesn’t* protect you against COVID, then what’s the point of getting vaccinated?"
3767,I agree that the current messaging is poor.
3768,I’m vaccinated and ready to go back to normal.

3784,"For example, why should ExxonMobil buck its profits to help save the environment, if you are not willing to take a small personal cost to help end the pandemic?"
3785,I'm high risk so I didn't wanna go to the doctor *or* dentist haha I ended up doing virtual visits with my primary and I actually got my blood drawn by a mobile phlebotomist in my front garden lol.
3786,But I felt totally safe at the dentist.
3787,They made me gargle with this nasty disinfectant of some kind and it was also mixed in with the water they use to rinse your mouth while working.
3788,And they had air purifiers in each room too.
3789,Most dentists have been following similar practices and the cool thing is that most people at my dentist were vaccinated as well by now so that's cool too haha
3790,&gt;Real scientists like to wait for real data.

3802,Only see people without masks outside few and far between.
3803,At least here in Honolulu.
3804,"Its fairly clear that vaccine production is no longer a bottleneck in the US, no?"
3805,"Moreover, there are J&amp;J / AstraZeneca doses piling up that are not use-able"
3806,Buzz me mulatto
3807,3.3million a day is the total number of shots given a day and most of the vaccines we are using (well all right now) are 2 shots.
3808,"So that's more like 7 weeks rather than 3 weeks best case, but yeah it will probably slow down as we approach closer to that 80% as you said."

3810,The blame lies entirely on Japan's government for thinking that COVID would never get bad enough to require mass vaccinations.
3811,So now they've been caught unprepared - oh and there's a global sporting event in 3 months.
3812,Same here.
3813,Confused and vaccinated.

3835,"""Essential"" workers and young people who aren't established do."
3836,Let's give the empathy to them first.
3837,That might happen.
3838,"Opening up vaccination for all adults was a good decision imo, there is still a lot of vaccine hesitancy and vaccines were not fully being utilized."
3839,I'm confident this will help speed up vaccination from the frustratingly low rate we have right now.
3840,Ugh!
3841,I’m terrified I’ll be shelling out the same for neglecting one of my teeth as well.
3842,"The dentist was one place that absolutely scared me to go to during COVID, yet I had no issue going to the doctor if needed."
3843,Thank you!
3844,They didn’t say anything when I told them I was getting my vaccination 10 days before.

3946,"I don’t wanna stand out and I wanna be left alone, so I wear my mask where I’m supposed to."
3947,assume a 0.5% IFR on the 3mn reported deaths and that gives you 600mn cases.

Check out [this comment](https://reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/mivmqz/_/gtd68om/?context=1) I posted comparing education of a family medicine physician and a family nurse practitioner."
4008,You're going to see a huge difference.
4009,Because the difference in education between an FM physician and a FNP is greater than the difference between an RN and a FNP.
4010,I wouldn't call the game in the second period.
4011,Half the battle is vaccine acceptance and some states are seriously plateauing under 40%
4012,US gave them 1.2B from Operation Warp Speed.
4013,To date: not one dose and no one in the US even gives a shit about the money.
4014,I wish they would redirect the vaccine to the states that still have high demand.
4015,You’re right.
4016,Your idea is better than mine.
4017,I wear a mask and follow distancing mandates but the messaging is awful.

4020,Those are individual human lives
4021,Just because you have a doctorate in nursing doesn’t mean you should be able to mislead patients into thinking you’re a physician.
4022,NPs are nursing experts with a little more clinical/diagnostician background but they do not have even a fraction of the knowledge or training that an MD or DO has.
4023,There needs to be more  transparency because I don’t think the general public understands this and it’s deceiving.
4024,They should do that with every disease with a vaccine.
4025,"Indeed, and for good cause."
4026,"Now, the US has a new administration and a successful vaccination program in progress."
4027,It's almost like we live in a dynamic world.
4028,I imagine there are some Canadians who would like the border to be open right about now.
4029,How far behind are we?
4030,We're about 20 days behind the states on first shots and on track to be the 3rd major country to finish using western vaccines (probably second as I doubt USA gets to 70%)
4031,Oh we’re not closing down anything here in Michigan.

4036,Surprised you didn’t get downvoted into oblivion for saying this.
4037,No legal weed and no vaccines here in NZ :-(
4038,Not Biden's fault he came in too late but had the USA marketed masks and vaccines with pictures of Uncle Sam and branded it as serving your country akin to WW2 this would be a whole different story.

4109,This should be a reminder to us all that even after vaccination there are still risks.
4110,There are variants out there that might get around your immune response and there are levels of exposure that might simply overwhelm your immune system after you have been vaccinated.
4111,But there is also reason from my personal experience to be optimistic.
4112,After my wife had received only her first shot she did not come down with Covid after I did.
4113,"Obviously, her exposure was pretty high living in a small apartment with me but after her first Moderna shot she never developed symptoms and her weekly Covid tests were all negative."
4114,What concerns me the most now is polling data showing that most people who have not yet been vaccinated do not plan to get vaccinated.

4249,This should all be done by Christmas!
4250,"(lol) I'll owe it to myself - I'll do a trip to Europe, swing by Poland for a few days... it'll be great!"""
4251,Obviously that didn't go as planned and we hadn't heard a thing for a while.
4252,My one friend finally pushed him in a group chat about a month ago and asked what was going on.
4253,"He said they were still planning stuff out, that it *was* happening, but they were figuring out the guidelines and all."
4254,DIdn't hear a thing since then.
4255,Yesterday I got the invite.
4256,"Now, I'm vaccinated, but I also understand that while the US is doing very well, the rest of the world is not, and that makes me uncomfortable."
4257,"Second, my job is asking us to return to the office on July 1st — I know... the Thursday before July 4th."
4258,Unreal.
4259,"But I think it'd be very bad optics to go back to the office after all this, then a week later turn around and be like ""going to Europe!"
4260,"See ya in 2 weeks!"""
4261,"I think I'm just going to explain that I have to return to the office, it'd be bad optics to travel internationally right now, and that I'm not gonna be able to swing it."
4262,Simple as that.
4263,I'm more than happy to celebrate them when they get back.
4264,"Had to type all that out to provide the full story and sorta convince myself... but I ask you, internet strangers: am I the crazy one?"
4265,And then people blame the government for everything.
4266,"The BJP has a huge role in fucking the entire situation up, but people blame the government for everything to evade responsibility and still post on social media about going outside."
4267,It normalizes mask wearing.
4268,That's the main point.
4269,"In this round, vaccine efficacy of 78% was recorded against mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of Covid-19 based on 127 cases.The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, with a reduction in the number of hospitalisations."
4270,"The efficacy against asymptomatic Covid-19 infections was 70%, suggesting decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients."
4271,"Dude we are at #10, just barely at top 10."
4272,As if they were enforced to begin with.
4273,Just saw your old  silver review in wsb now we are close to big  days for silver and gather all at WallStreetSilver subreddit if you have time pls look amazing days are front bro  thanks regards
4274,The US recently asked for 5.1 billion in aid to Africa: [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R46368.pdf](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R46368.pdf).
4275,Agreed.
4276,I don't get how anyone can see wearing a mask anywhere is virtue signaling.
4277,Seriously.
4278,At worst its none of your business why they are wearing it.
4279,What if they have covid and just had to go somewhere?
4280,Why do we think the worst in people?
4281,Nice qualifier.
4282,Hey.
4283,Tested positive yesterday.
4284,Have been experiencing symptoms for 6 days now.
4285,"In addition to having impaired sense of smell and taste, I've been feeling some skin irritation wherein I feel a pinchy pain when my skin ruba against my clothes.?"
4286,?
4287,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4290,*
4291,"Idk about all the science about disease prevention, but my life experience tells me that flossing is necessary in order to not be gross."
4292,"I floss my teeth after brushing thoroughly, and I remove a bunch of stinky crap that was formed in the small gaps between my teeth."
4293,"I want the stinky crap removed, so I floss."
4294,Also crazy seeing “my family and I are all vaccinated.
4295,Is it safe for us to hang out?” What do you think the point of getting vaccinated is?
4296,I can still understand caution but we’ve had plenty time to see outdoor transmission isn’t a risk.
4297,I’m not anti-mask and will happily wear one in a store or on a subway but we have to return to normal at some point.
4298,Shush now.
4299,He died due to an unrelated cardiac event.
4300,The hospital already released a comment.
4301,Stop spreading misinformation.
4302,"I hope you have never flown in your life, ever had surgery, done any long distant road trips, or if you're female been on birth control because ALL of those give far far far higher chances of blood clots than the AZ vaccine."
4303,Not to mention the extremely high prevalence of blood clots when you get covid.
4304,Such a shame so many people are eating up this fear that the media is laying down
4305,"Yeah my friend, after a couple of drinks told me he probably got covid in December but didn't get tested because the county would have required him to quarantine."
4306,He would still go out to restaurants and work.
4307,Next door in Illinois our positivity rate is starting to go down.
4308,7 day average peaked at about 4.4% (knock on wood) and is now down under 4%.
4309,"Same is happening the other way round, so don't act high and mighty about it."
4310,That the US isn't actively blocking all raw materials from being exported is a pretty low bar to clear.
4311,The article appears to be paywalled for me.
4312,Can someone transcribe it or suggest a free workaround?
4313,Many thanks!
4314,Sorry to hear that!
4315,Getting mine tomorrow.
4316,"Hope that in this case the reverse happens, not looking forward to considersble worse side-effects :-)"
4317,"I'm saying Illinois' current plan will allow all businesses to reopen at full capacity with no distancing, but with masks."
4318,"A gym, a packed nightclub, indoor weddings, stadiums, churches, schools, stores, etc."
4319,"will all be open at full capacity, but everyone will be required to wear a mask if they aren't drinking."
4320,"So if you have water with you at the gym, you're ok."
4321,"If you're drinking in the club, ok."
4322,"If you're just dancing, wear a mask."
4323,"Eating wedding cake, ok."
4324,"The ceremony and pictures, wear a mask."
4325,"Outside at the zoo will require a mask, but eating in their cafe won't."
4326,&gt;Will they be a hypocrite or incompetent?
4327,Find out next week!
4328,I am unsure what you are trying to say so ill refrain from upvoting or downvoting.
4329,Seems like Africa always answers the phone
4330,"Chances are you'll test negative, but you can also use proof of recovery instead."
4331,"&gt;The CDC does not recommend getting tested again in the three months after a positive viral test, as long as the person does not have symptoms of COVID-19."
4332,"If you have had a positive viral test in the past 3 months, and you have met the CDC’s criteria to end isolation, you may travel instead with documentation of your positive viral test results and a letter from your healthcare provider or a public health official that states you have been cleared for travel."
4333,"The positive test result and letter together are referred to as “documentation of recovery.” 

https://www.bahamas.com/tourism-reopening"
4334,Correct.
4335,This will end socially before politically.
4336,It took me some nice policemen yo teach me that
4337,"I can’t imagine it would be impossible to do this, I think Biden must be aware of the implications if it doesn’t happen soon."
4338,I hope the USA starts loaning out those 20 million AZ doses that are just sitting there.
4339,"Maybe to South Korea, Canada and Mexico?"
4340,You still see most of these people pushing the “you can still spread the virus when fully vaccinated so keep double masking!” lines too.
4341,They’ve made an identity of it.
4342,"I mean, I am from India, realise india is a shithole, but at the very least india did indeed export a ton of vaccines, more than USA, despite being broke n poor"
4343,There is currently a scandal in Romania regarding how/if they declare the current number of deaths caused by covid.
4344,"So the record number now, doesn't necessarily mean this is the first time so many people die because of covid."
4345,"Arrogance, and dereliction of duty."
4346,He's kowtowing to interests that don't want to invest in safety measures and institute stricter safety protocols.
4347,"There are some things you don't lie about, a new killer virus is one, we need all new leadership at our institutions that have failed us this Pandemic."
4348,"Both vaccines are effective and safe, but who can blame someone for doubting AZ’s safety after Europe’s response to it?"
4349,Who can blame someone for doubting Sinovac’s efficacy given its negative media coverage?
4350,"Instead of just parroting that they’re effective and safe, maybe give OP some information to support that."
4351,(See my comment to him.)
4352,Calling someone with doubts “the problem” makes you the problem.
4353,"If we want our hesitant population to choose the vaccine, we need to be willing to have a dialogue, not shame people."
4354,Are there some dedicated anti-vaxxers whose minds won’t be changed?
4355,Sure.
4356,Are there also people who just might be misinformed?
4357,"Absolutely, and they’re not the same."
4358,"After a year of comments along the lines of ""haha stupid americans die"" guess I don't care."
4359,&gt;when the pandemic is highly suppressed by already existing vaccines?
4360,That seems like a good problem to have.
4361,We're not there yet.
4362,"Israel basically declared victory when about 56% of the population was vaccinated, and this was before they even started on the kids."
4363,"Remember that for every reported case, there are probably at least 2 or 3 people that become immune (because there are many unreported cases)."
4364,"This is how Israel believes they got to the finish line, with about 15% people that had recovered and 56% vaccinated = 71% which is enough to basically halt the spread."
4365,We really need to stick together and get our facts straight here.
4366,Here are the facts: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ and https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/ and https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations
4367,"It would, but a national domestic vaccine passport is never going to happen on a reasonable time scale."

4373,*
4374,I think there's also a subset of people that just won't get one until it's easy walk-in appointments.
4375,"Either they don't want to figure out how to make appointments, or have crazy work schedules."
4376,"They just want to get a a point where on their way to lunch they can swing by a CVS, get a shot, and be on their way."
4377,"Because it just isn't as simple as lots of masks = no cases, no masks = lots of cases."
4378,There are other things at play.
4379,The virus has its own path through each area and people affect it a lot less than they think.
4380,"Remember the original goal was ""flatten the curve"", not ""prevent every case""."
4381,Nobody ever thought that masks would perpetually prevent spread... until they did.
4382,"The reason the WHO and everyone else has been slow to recognize the obvious, that a respiratory virus is mainly spread through the air, is of course because then we would need stricter safety protocols and the governments the WHO is beholden to didn't want to be forced to adopt those stricter measures and invest in new ventilation and N-95 or otherwise effective masks."
4383,"It's very shortsighted, with that investment they could re-open more and quicker and instill confidence, and have a leg up on countries that don't follow suit."
4384,Bad leadership all around.
4385,"To add, vaccination also has a lagging effect since it takes 2 weeks after the matter to have immunity."
4386,"So reported cases should reflect vaccine data after two weeks, and deaths two weeks after that."
4387,"IMO, I think May is when we'll see the real difference we've all been waiting for."
4388,"Oh, good to hear."
4389,"From the headline, the situation sounded worse."
4390,They ICUs have been at (almost) full capacity for an entire year.
4391,If you're scared stay home
4392,"Poor oral hygiene is like, highly correlated with everything bad."
4393,I was doing research on a common pathology and all of the patient questionnaires stated that they had periodontal disease.
4394,The pathology is not something you would think of being related at all.
4395,"Anyway, that’s how I began flossing daily."
4396,Just exactly how addled does one have to be to believe that wearing a mask is equal to restricting their freedom?
4397,asking for a friend
4398,"Yes, Chicago has far more demand than the rest of the state."
4399,"But the entire state has already hit its vaccination target, so no single person has that motivation."
4400,"If Pritzker set a 65% threshold for removing the mask mandate, you would potentially see people downstate motivated again."
4401,There might not be enough Chicagoans to carry us to that goal.
4402,"Yeah, it also just killed a famous actor in India, so maybe calm down throwing around those numbers like that?"
4403,He has the most reasonable takes about covid all the time.
4404,He really seems to understand proper communication and to shape what he says for people to get whats going on.
4405,Seems you don’t know much about the scope of pharmacy.
4406,great news for the virus
4407,"I get why you’re waiting, but I do think the issues you’re citing have been overhyped by the media."
4408,"Sinovac is just over 50% effective against mild infection, 84% effective against cases requiring medical intervention, and prevents almost all moderate and severe cases ([Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-13/are-china-s-covid-shots-less-effective-experts-size-up-sinovac))."
4409,"Why not get Sinovac to get some protection, especially against serious complications?"
4410,"And if an mRNA vaccine eventually becomes available in your country, you can get that, too."
4411,There’s nothing to suggest that multiple COVID shots are bad for you.
4412,The issue is that the US still has stubbornly high cases (e.g.
4413,relative to the UK we're still nearly 5 times higher new cases per capita and that ignores positivity / testing rate differences in many regions).
4414,"I am optimistic that we finally truly had our final ""mini-peak"" (which was barely a peak - thanks to vaccinations) and we should have a pretty solid national downward trend from here on out."
4415,"But cases are still uncomfortably high in most states (especially ones like Michigan, albeit it looks like they have peaked as well)."
4416,The issue is that public health messaging is hard.
4417,"People want a ""when is this over?"""
4418,date.
4419,"I do think the message should be ""when X% of population is vaccinated and there are less than Y cases per 100K per week"" as a standard threshold for all clears (well, probably multiple thresholds: masks will probably be the last to go given the low economic and personal cost of wearing them)."
4420,Unfortunately that data is abstract and so I'm not sure how much it helps.
4421,People won't understand what it means or why it is relevant.
4422,"The issue is that a simple message of ""oh you're vaccinated, you're fully protected!"""
4423,is misleading as well.
4424,Case load matters.
4425,"The vaccines are highly personally protective, but not completely."
4426,"At 90-95% efficacy from symptoms and 87-99% efficacy from hospitalizations (depending on what data you're looking at), the mRNA vaccines are great."
4427,"But to put things into perspective: as of last week, it was about as safe to eat in a New Mexico restaurant unvaccinated (50 cases per 100K per week) as it was to eat in a Michigan restaurant vaccinated (500 cases per 100K per week)."
4428,There is no better protection than low case loads.
4429,"A 90% reduction in exposure risk is roughly just as ""effective"" as the vaccines (of course, the vaccines are also what enable us to reduce exposure - which is why are vaccines - and getting them in as many arms as possible - is so important)."
4430,"I think once you get below 25 or 50 cases per 100K per week and a high enough vaccination percentage, it's a no brainer to fully open everything up and party like it's 1999."
4431,"But again, that messaging is complex."
4432,Yes
4433,I tested positive about a week ago with VERY mild symptoms.
4434,"The doctor told me that Friday is my last day of isolation, and I won’t be contagious."
4435,I have a family trip planned to the Bahamas on May 3.
4436,"I just realized I might be fucked, as a negative PCR test is required, but these tests can pick up false positives on recovered covid people for THREE MONTHS."
4437,Should I even bother just crossing my fingers and hoping for a negative test?
4438,Or just cancel my hotel portion and offer it to a cousin or something?
4439,So basically they sacrificing people now 😑
4440,Preach
4441,"Urban always wins in these types of things, right?"
4442,Calling an NP a doctor is a far greater misnomer.
4443,"A DNP degree requires 500 clinical hours of training, with no standards for what that training looks like (you just need someone to sign off - it could be merely shadowing another NP)."
4444,"That's about on par with what a 3rd year medical student will complete in 2-3 months (although the medical student *does* have requirements for patient care that they have to fulfill), so they can't graduate until they have many times that amount of training."
4445,"That's before they complete 3+ years of residency, too."
4446,"Strictly speaking, NPs are nurses that are prepared to work with a bit more autonomy than an RN, but it's just as disingenuous to call them a doctor in a hospital or clinical setting as it would be to call a pharmacist, or a lawyer, or a professor of english a doctor."
4447,Patients already find out kafkaesque medical system overwhelming - we have no business misrepresenting ourselves or our training by obscuring these key differences between professional degrees.
4448,Cringe.
4449,I don’t remember being sick in a year.
4450,"Wife was REALLY sick last March after traveling through NYC, but never tested positive for antibodies."
4451,Imagine being the guy who caused that.
4452,[removed]
4453,I bet it’s because of bureaucracy.
4454,Just watch Shin Godzilla
4455,I really think there is something wrong with you.
4456,Wtf?
4457,😂
4458,Texas is about average in the US for rate of infection throughout the pandemic.
4459,Very similar.
4460,No fever or shakes (which I got from the 1st) but prolonged feeling of becoming sick.
4461,Lasted about 36 hours.
4462,After the second night I was good!
4463,Arm pain went away quicker too.
4464,"...do you think it’s *not* possible that blood clots can form and not actually be diagnosed or do any damage until later much later on, skewing the data on commonality of adverse symptoms?"
4465,?
4466,[deleted]
4467,"I've heard (anecdotally) that for Pfizer and Moderna, you get the big reaction on the first shot if you already had COVID, and you get it on the second shot if you didn't have COVID before vaccination."
4468,"My older brother had COVID in April 2020, got first dose (Moderna) a couple weeks back, and he was out the next day - pretty much slept the entire day off."
4469,"Everyone else I know in the family that got moderna (grandparents + father) had no reaction to the first dose whatsoever, but did to the second."
4470,Nor did the UK.
4471,The UK had zero production of vaccines.
4472,Zilch.
4473,Nothing that can’t be cured by bathing in a magical river/toilet.
4474,Do they not wear masks?
4475,"To be fair, Israel is using Pfizer, and OP says the aren’t getting vaxxed right now because their country’s vaccines are AZ and Sinovac."
4476,But the UK has been largely using AZ with great results.
4477,"The UK didn't gamble on 1 vaccine, it gambled on several."
4478,AZ was just the fastest to come out.
4479,I know two guys at work who had the second shot and were knocked on their ass.
4480,One guy said he doesn't even remember the day after his second shot.
4481,That was pretty much my experience with J&amp;J.  I also know one guy who got J&amp;J and said all he got from it was a sore shoulder.
4482,I was completely fine about 30ish hours after my shot as well but I would not go back for a second one that knocked me on my ass like that.
4483,&gt; Floss can occasionally cause harm.
4484,"Careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work."
4485,"Though frequency is unclear, floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature

I'll just leave that there."
4486,I was going to post that...but I tried to be nice.
4487,Thanks.
4488,What is it that they can only get from the US?
4489,"Bro, don’t start this of all days."
4490,Anyways Bharat biotech has denied the news sting they do not have the data.
4491,"Honestly, seeing these numbers, I can understand why young, healthy people would be hesitant to take this vaccine, when their risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID is smaller than 1/70,000."
4492,My worry is that there may be many more clotting cases that have not yet been reported.
4493,"I’m in PA too, and a mass vaccine site in the county adjacent to mine still had open slots when it was advertised on the news."
4494,The place I went to did seem to have a steady stream of people coming in and sitting in observation.
4495,I was in the hesitant group initially but decided to get it when I realized I could help my family and friends feel more comfortable with going back to normal.
4496,Get the syringe gun from TF2 and find some German inethical doctors.
4497,"Important not to forget that in 2020 the federal government refused to make a deal for 70 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which would have made a huge difference in our vaccination progress, even if not fully delivered."
4498,Good results and another vaccine that helps us to fight the virus worldwide.
4499,"Nope, it wont let me secure a first appt without a second one."
4500,"Trust me, I've been looking every day."
4501,"Frys, Walgreens,  Kroger's etc all have first aapts, it asks me to select a 2nd dose date in order to confirm the first."
4502,I’ll provide proof for any of my statements.
4503,&gt;Floss can occasionally cause harm.
4504,"Careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work."
4505,"Though frequency is unclear, floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature

Literally bad for you and people will still do it..."
4506,I'm very surprised people that don't believe in science are on this sub... Genuinely.. like the amount of downvotes I've gotten and people hating on me because they are getting suckered into a company that sells them a product that does nothing....I don't have food stuck in my teeth and the only reason you do is cause you keep flossing making more space between your teeth and making it easier for food to get in between your teeth...I don't have that problem unless I go to the dentist and they floss my teeth and the next two days I'm in the worst pain cause of it... You guys are literally making your teeth worse and worse and it's hilarious to me.
4507,It's like falling for the Nike and under armour scam but worse...
4508,"In the end, Novanax and Valneva were going to come a bit late, so this doesn't make a tangible difference."
4509,"EU seems to be focusing on a few projects which seem to be more reliable for us, both in terms of effectiveness and reliability of deliveries."

4512,"I don't know about Germany, but my town in the US more than tripled the number of ICU beds they had and ran them at over 100% capacity for months."
4513,A similar thing happened to non-ICU in patient beds.
4514,"When you more than triple the load on the healthcare system, you end up using a lot of supplies very quickly."
4515,0.0014%
4516,I’m about 24 hours out from my second Pfizer dose.
4517,I currently have a headache and my arm is still a bit sore.
4518,Woke up at 2:30 in the morning with soreness and wanting a little bit of a heavier blanket.
4519,But I was able to stand up and wash dishes (no dishwasher in my apartment) without any major issues this morning.
4520,"I got offered my job back with a minor league baseball team, and I’m thinking of returning."
4521,"I’m not thrilled about the outdoor masking, but I loved my job before COVID and missed it a lot last year."
4522,It’s a shorter season (60 home games) than normal and I am trying to have hope that more restrictions can be relaxed as the summer goes on.
4523,"I also feel it would probably benefit my mental health to have a good, consistent reason to leave my apartment when work from home feels never ending."
4524,Maybe ask him to get tested?

4532,&gt;They have a wider scope because legislation sponsored by health insurance companies and hospital cooperations lobbied to let them practice with a wider scope.
4533,That's not why they have a wider scope.
4534,I'm not talking about FPA.
4535,"I'm talking about the ability to prescribe, diagnose, and treat which is something NPs do across the board and have always done."
4536,"Their scope has always been higher than a regular nurse, so saying they're ""just a nurse"" is disingenuous and misleading."

4539,So now its a race between covid cases going vertical and the homegrown vaccine (and possibly imported doses) getting administered fast enough to arrest its growth.
4540,"it's mainly  due to lack of skilled personnel, atleast in Germany that’s the main reason"
4541,The pro-restriction public health folks will pound the table on children/people with certain health conditions not being able to get vaccinated as a reason to keep it in place.
4542,I don't think this will work though.
4543,"At that point, the number of people at serious risk of COVID death/complications who are unable to protect themselves will be so low that people will really start to question the cost/benefit of any sort of mass restrictions."
4544,But that brutal lockdown led to 75 million slipping back into poverty.
4545,That is a worse outcome.
4546,wait.......wtf
4547,This is not correct.
4548,"Yes, I too am confused as to why the leadership of a country is setting an example and asking all to start the course a little longer to avoid as many deaths as possible in this final hour."
4549,"It's not like if they said ""if you're vaccinated you don't need a mask"" people would lie about being vaccinated..."
4550,Right?
4551,"I voted for Trmp, I don't need proof."
4552,That’s awesome!
4553,Even better than some trials.
4554,Agreed.
4555,Do you support mask mandates annually during the flu season?
4556,I think even the simplest measures could help saves lives from the flu.
4557,This is disinformation.
4558,There’s no evidence about the SA variant and efficacy either way for either.
4559,Not from a global perspective.
4560,"Free trade allows for less arbitrary shortages and more effective manufacturing, meaning more doses being produced in total globally."
4561,"India was also one of the main contributors to COVAX, meaning that the doses they were primarily exporting to other places badly needing the doses as well."
4562,"From an Indian perspective (taking into account they are also very far behind the US and UK in vaccinations), yes, it was the wrong choice."
4563,"From a global perspective, it was the right choice."
4564,Because it's possible now.
4565,To spread some joy.
4566,To encourage people to get vaccinated ASAP.
4567,"Also, why the hell not?"
4568,"Life is difficult as it is, might as well relax a bit after doing something good for yourself and the community."
4569,That's why.
4570,This misconception is very common and is a perfect example of how media and science can be misconstrued if they’re not super careful about how they present studies.
4571,"Just the other day, my aunt said her friends (in their 70s) were telling her the vaccine only lasts 6 months and that they regretted getting it."
4572,I saw plenty of articles on social media saying “Studies found the vaccine lasts 6 months” in their headlines.
4573,Why not add “at least”?
4574,"Or even better, “It’s been 6 months and studies found vaccines are still effective”."
4575,Because shit like that doesn’t get clicks.
4576,"\*than  
You ignorant fool."
4577,"Everyone I know bad pretty shitty side effects with J&amp;J, with or without a previous covid infection."
4578,I wanted Pfizer because I wanted an mRNA vaccine and Pfizer had more real world data.
4579,My first shot was uncomfortable.
4580,I ran a slight fever and experienced muscle pain.
4581,"The second I was fatigued, but no fever or muscle pain."
4582,"I had pain at the injection site both times, but it wasn’t debilitating or anything."
4583,About 30 hours after my shots I felt totally back to normal.
4584,He's a Tamil comedian named Vivek.
4585,"Although I don't watch Tamil movies anymore, I thoroughly enjoyed his comedy growing up."
4586,"He was in a lot of movies and a social activist too, he was encouraging everyone to take the vaccine even a day before his death."
4587,"He was one of the good ones, RIP."
4588,Taken too soon at 59.
4589,It's really weird to see people that don't believe in science in this sub...
4590,I guess you guys are everywhere at this point.. man that sucks.

4593,The OP is probably speaking about Vivek from Tamil movie industry.
4594,He died of Arterial block a day later he got his vaccine shot.
4595,Using this some are running disinformation campaign.
4596,He was a good activist.
4597,If he could he see now he would be crying now of what has his death is being used as.

4600,Funny.
4601,That's what Kentucky is doing and I'm not sure we're gonna get there.
4602,I don't like it because it keeps those of us who are vaccinated beholden to the anti-vaxx dummies.
4603,"I don't have much hope for the whole US to have a reasonable number of vaccinations, so I'm just hoping my state (PA) and its surrounding states do."
4604,"It looks like that will happen, as the demand still seems high."
4605,"I don't think it has been discussed at all... and if you had treatment with the things in question, you likely would have spoken with your doctor about it."
4606,This is correct.
4607,"If de Blasio and the state legislators want the mandate lifted if NYC, the emergency power removal will make it very difficult for Cuomo to block their wishes."
4608,"Also, de Blasio has almost always been the bigger restriction advocate between the two throughout this entire pandemic."

4615,"Well it's important to point out that there's a difference from the vaccine rejecters, the vaccine hesitant, and the vaccine apathetic."
4616,The vaccine rejecters will never take it.
4617,"The hesitant are untrusting of it, but can and will still take it if it's necessary."
4618,"The apathetic are lazy, and don't see a point when nothing will change."
4619,The key here is to target the apathetic and hesitant.
4620,"Give people a goal to work towards, open up privileges for vaccination (travel, maskless, dining) and people will get vaccinated."
4621,The OMT has clearly stated this is a purely political decision and not one based on data.
4622,"They OMT is against opening up now, but suggest to wait for now."
4623,"Also, these projection have been wrong multiple times, both for being too optimistic and pessimistic."
4624,"This is just how models are, they are not certain."
4625,"So this could be a completely wrong decision, it is just a guess the government is taking."
4626,"I understand, no clue what the curfew is still doing."
4627,10 pm curfew does not really stop a lot.
4628,"Understandable that compliance is so high, because basically almost no one currently has the urge to go out at these times while clubs and pubs are closed anyway."
4629,"Also, that opening up outdoor parts of pubs and restaurants will decrease the amount of people in parks meetings what is that even based on?"
4630,The only thing this will probably do is ensure the same amount of people will be in parks and more people are in the terrasjes.
4631,So more people out and about.
4632,"Not specifically a bad thing (being outside), but then people should meet indoors less and keep following the measures outside and while going to such places."
4633,"We will see if this happens, for now it is just a gamble."
4634,And for higher education I understand it as well.
4635,"Even though primary schools and high schools have proven to be huge corona factories this wave, the same could happen in higher education."
4636,"It is only one day per week with measures, mandatory distancing and voluntary mass testing (low compliance anyways), so maybe they can keep it out but I highly doubt it, as high schools have basically the same set of measures and they have not been successful."
4637,"Look, the let go of measures separately I completely understand them."
4638,And each measure can be let go of without significant consequences.
4639,But this is assuming each measure is sperate and that people follow the rules.
4640,"However, this is not the case, people do not always follow the measures and you cannot see the measures separately."
4641,"Everything separately makes it look like it makes complete sense, but everything together still means a lot more contacts and a lot more movement, thus a lot more chances for it to spread."
4642,The fact that you're on a science subreddit and don't believe in actual science is what is horseshit...
4643,Oh I dunno.
4644,Home maybe.
4645,"1 in 70,000 which is fairly similar to UK 1.1 in 100,000 so not absurdly high, indeed not as high as the numbers from Denmark but it does speak volumes for how much of a disaster this vaccine is."

4648,"What the message needs to be (and should have been) is get vaccinated, then we go back to normal."
4649,"In that case, that would make Belgium blow the US out of the water."
4650,CDC needs to declare fully vaccinated individuals can drop the mask.
4651,That would encourage many people to get it that otherwise won’t.
4652,They already said you can’t carry/spread so I don’t get the point of a mask after both shots.
4653,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pfizer-says-trials-suggest-covid-vaccine-works-against-south-african-n1262710

4655,Good day to you sir from Ontario :D
4656,Literally everywhere did.
4657,We didn't have anywhere else to put people.
4658,The first wave had that brutal lockdown.
4659,Now hundreds of thousands of people are gathering.
4660,"At least in Sweden they have been saying that spread happens mostly at: work, within families and at private social gatherings - according to contact tracing."
4661,I think this was probably pretty common over the last year.
4662,"People didn't want to inconvenience themselves, so they spread it to others."
4663,"It's why it killed over 560,000 people."
4664,Would taking Prozac make the vaccine less effective since it acts as anti-inflammatory?
4665,"Similar to advil, etc."
4666,?
4667,Because by wearing a mask outside you get to signal that to everyone else.
4668,Nah they use the existing inactive viral as ingredient.

4677,I started feeling crummy about four hours after my second dose!

4679,"If you know who Ionnadis is, his entire reputation as an iconoclast is effectively being contrarian and saying everyone is wrong."
4680,His latest paper literally *attacked* someone because he had not finished his PhD - this is far more about their ego and unwillingness to admit they are wrong... which is about as anti-science as you can get.
4681,"We're both right, thanks to my skill of adding qualifiers 😌"
4682,"I chalk it up to two things (can be a combination of both)

1) re-entry anxiety/fear as  result of collective or individual trauma from the experience of living through a pandemic

2) lack of understanding of the science underpinning our understanding of coronavirus."
4683,"for example, I don't think my mom will ever understand the biological mechanisms of viral infection enough to understand that outdoors is different than sharing an indoor space with another person."
4684,"you could tell her that coronavirus was coming from the soil, or the sun, or anywhere and she'd believe it."

4688,You have to be a troll.
4689,Nobody is this oblivious.
4690,"If I may point out, doesn’t this essentially argue that India exporting out before getting the virus under control was not the right choice?"
4691,Eh fuck em.
4692,They will get antibodies one way or another.
4693,"I mean, I would really hope indoor mandates are lifted shortly after."
4694,What justification would there be for not doing that once everyone has been eligible for vaccination for over two months?
4695,"Just pointing out that US, while being infinitely more powerful and strong than india, is refusing to help us out while thousands of people are dying in india

4728,Learn that plaque results from bacteria that feed off the gunk between teeth and that flossing removes gunk.
4729,To remove plaque requires scraping by dental hygienist.

4733,the scientists and researchers who study and develop vaccines are planning ahead to see if booster vaccinations are necessary.
4734,we don't want to be left unprepared if boosters are necessary.
4735,If we weren’t vaccinating ourselves first we would be in the middle of another wave of deaths like the rest of the world.
4736,We don’t owe other countries to put ourselves through that.
4737,The counterpoint here is that I am skeptical that the vaccine hesitant really care about masks to begin with.
4738,"The social end is basically here in a lot of places, and the rapidly-increasing numbers of those who are fully vaccinated aren’t going to put up with continuing to distance and mask for much longer, if they still are at all."
4739,"Better messaging would help, but it’s ending either way."
4740,It would even end if we never had a vaccine - just like every other pandemic in history.

4745,There was a decent AMA on here a week ago talking about that fact.
4746,Indian rural areas are not remote.
4747,And there's tonnes of travel between cities and rural areas.
4748,I live in Maharashtra (the current epicentre) and last year during the September peak there were comparatively fewer cases in the rural areas.
4749,Then during December- early February the virus kind of disappeared (very few cases) in the entire state including rural areas.
4750,"In February, we heard of virus cases increasing in the eastern part of Maharashtra (which is a rural area)."
4751,This area is where the double mutant variant emerged and because of travel it soon spread to all areas in Maharashtra.
4752,"However this time, the spread was from rural to urban areas unlike the last wave."
4753,Mumbai was functioning normally until March.
4754,The wave spread from a rural part of Maharashtra to the entire state and now is spreading to the entire country.
4755,&gt;As it's an imported virus it make sense that it take some time before spreading to rural areas with less travel.
4756,This is conjecture.
4757,Most of India is uniformly and densely populated and rural population centres are well connected to cities by an expansive road and rail network.
4758,People in rural areas frequently travel to cities for various things.
4759,"Pune, another city in Maharashtra has no international flights and yet was battered by the virus in the first wave."
4760,Not all heroes wear capes.
4761,Thanks for the link.
4762,"Literally the point of ""flatten the curve"" was that the same number of infections were going to happen but you want to spread them out over a longer period so as to not overwhelm the medical system and ensure that people that need other care can still get help."
4763,Somehow this message got warped over time.
4764, Maybe was just my bad at understanding/reading english.
4765,"That ""In Latin American first"", I was understanding it more as if this was the first vaccine to be produced in LatAm, which is not the case."
4766,"It would have been clearer to me ""Argentina first LatAm country to produce Sputnik V"", but then again, I'm not a native speaker."
4767,Outdoors?
4768,That would be awful.
4769,"You have scientific experts here saying that outdoor spread isn’t even a low risk activity, it is a zero risk activity."
4770,Outdoor masking does literally nothing.
4771,It is a political statement.
4772,"I’m fine with masks on subways til 2022, but we need to end with the rules that serve no purpose."

4839,"To this day, the ATC is recommending against AT thru-hikes and refusing to recognize any in 2021."

4842,Indoor activities even in far smaller groups were much riskier from a transmission standpoint.

4863,"It would be increasing everywhere, but because more wealthy countries are mass vaccinating the virus just isn't taking hold there as much."
4864,Pretty much the body sees the pathegen(spike protein) and mounts a response.
4865,The seccond dose is the same but the body sees it and is like oh crap this dude again let's get serious and then mounts a stronger response.
4866,I think most people would come to that conclusion if they knew the true extent of the damage these lockdowns did.
4867,"But it forces people to make tough decisions, much easier to just say we have to save lives (at huge expense), when in fact it's amoral to not consider the people you are throwing under the bus by doing so."
4868,[deleted]
4869,People being unable to tell the difference between now and the last year when the majority of that almost 600K died is equally as disturbing.
4870,I understand that there is some trauma but that's not an excuse to overstate how dangerous the virus is today and will be in the coming months.
4871,Not allowed in restaurants either.
4872,"&gt;  in fact, nearly every worldwide dose of the Pfizer vaccine begins with raw materials produced on US soil."
4873,Do you have a source on that?
4874,"Because both BioNTech and Moderna have independent supply chains in Europe, according to [this](https://blog.jonasneubert.com/2021/01/10/exploring-the-supply-chain-of-the-pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines/) blog."

4883,I set up vaccine appointments for elderly by phone and talked to a woman recently who has not left her house in 5 years...
4884,Out.
4885,Both of you.
4886,"There was no ""empathy"" for those of us hurt by the pandemic mitigation measures."
4887,"Want the same kind of ""empathy"" for people nervous about going back to normal after vaccination?"
4888,You're going to have to get over it.
4889,"Back to normal isn't a ""If you feel like it"" thing."
4890,Many of us are going back asap and you'll be left behind.

4909,2 days ago someone got really colse to me when I was waiting in a line.
4910,"I had my mask on, he had his half on."
4911,They guy seemed pretty normal and talked normally.
4912,"Now given how bad the situation of my country is right now, I'm worried that I might get reinfected and pass it on to my family..."
4913,"Sucks, but they'll get over it."
4914,Just like we who hated shutdowns got over it for the last year.
4915,[deleted]
4916,This ain’t serious though.
4917,This is a joke and the media is creating it.
4918,"All this does is reduce vaccine acceptance and increase panic, unfoundedly."
4919,[deleted]
4920,Australia in particular likely won't open their borders until next year because their vaccination campaign is slow and it would be dangerous to open up before everyone is vaccinated.
4921,"Florida's response followed some ""fringe"" epidemiologists that advised every location needs to reach herd immunity and the main job of society should be to protect the vulnerable and otherwise just let people do what they are going to do."
4922,If you can't lock down until vaccination places like California proved the danger of locking down for too long and then opening up with zero natural immunity.
4923,Side note is that lockdowns seem to disproportionately affect POC.
4924,States with longer and harder lockdowns had a higher number of minority deaths as a percentage of population (Michigan I'm looking at you..).
4925,I think herd immunity plays into this as well.
4926,https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/covid-19-deaths-by-race-ethnicity/
4927,I have been seeing those articles everyday for at least the past week or so.
4928,If (when?)
4929,"an actual vaccine resistant strain actually emerges, a lot of people might not even pay attention after having been mislead so often by clicbait."
4930,Remember when the US COVID Taskforce was led by Jared Cushner?
4931,"We had that going for us, which was nice."
4932,What a bloody-handed asshat who probably hasn’t lost a wink of sleep knowing full well he made the landscape far worse than it would have been without him.
4933,I don’t trust them.
4934,Let me see some data first.
4935,Theoretically yes.
4936,But that would be very very rare and probably only with someone who had a suppressed immune system.
4937,"""one of the worst outbreaks"" is up to debate."
4938,Pretty much the entire central Europe had worse numbers than Lithuania through this entire time.
4939,"Plus Romania, Ukraine, some ex yoguslav countries, perhaps Greece...

We did not see variations of concern popping up in each of those countries."
4940,South Africa also did not have a particularly bad outbreak before the variation was detected.
4941,You are just forcing conclusions here.
4942,Why not wait?
4943,Because it was a 2 week lockdown last year.
4944,That turned into 4.
4945,Then 6.
4946,Then all of December.
4947,Then January and a curfew.
4948,Then well shit the UK variant.
4949,Ok February too then.
4950,Maybe March also?
4951,21st of April?
4952,"No, one more week."
4953,And you have the audacity to ask why we don't just wait?
4954,That’s not accurate at all.
4955,There’s no evidence either way to state anything like that.
4956,The 10% study you’re referring to was in no way conclusive whatsoever; it basically stated absolutely nothing.

4966,"There are more graphs on it somewhere, one showing risk with low societal spread and one with more societal spread."
4967,With low societal spread it's about even for under 30 with AZ (tipping towards risk).
4968,This is also why I believe the UK has opted for under 30's to get a different vaccine.
4969,"If you want to stay in your house forever then you do you

I'll do me"
4970,I wish this would feature more in the discourse.
4971,"There is always a lot of talk about imposing or rolling back restrictions, with much cheer and indignation in both cases, but there is very little analysis of what actually limits spread efficiently and what is just imposing a cost on society without really helping much."
4972,"At least in Europe, I feel like this is missing, and all we have instead is just calls to take it in the chin and hope whatever we are doing works out."

4977,"I am not from the field, so sorry if the way I question it sounds a bit odd?"
4978,"What exactly does it mean to ""produce""?"
4979,Because some countries claiming to produce Sputnik V are pretty much just getting the product almost ready from Russia and bottling it.

4981,Then why would you go to a movie theater?
4982,"Could just blanket say ""do not travel""."
4983,Dummies.
4984,"Not sure we could have beaten it in the pre-vaccine days, but I still think not as many people would have died if people had taken it more seriously, especially here in the States."
4985,"The politicization of the virus by the Trump administration really was like tossing a giant can of gasoline on the fire, and resulted in way too many people saying the virus was a hoax and/or refusing to take even simple measures to guard against getting sick and spreading the disease."
4986,"And even after a year, you still have people, like ole Ted Nugent, clinging to the lie that the virus is a hoax."
4987,It's disgusting.
4988,Plus it's really positive that it's just taking the same routes over and over again.
4989,"That suggests there are only so many moves it can make without damaging itself in other areas, plus increases the likelihood that boosters will absolutely handle whatever's around in autumn when we have them."
4990,"Amy Coney Barrett, probably."
4991,[removed]
4992,Deep red county of the South here.
4993,I think our cases have went down exponentially over the past month - despite full again - because so many of my kids have already been exposed at home.
4994,If I ask for a show of hands got whose parents have had covid it's at least 50% in each class.
4995,And the few others have parents who are now fully vaccinated.
4996,Out virtual (quarantined) list used to be 30+ kids.
4997,"Right now if you take out a bus driver causing a quarantine, there are like 5."
4998,[removed]
4999,I think its stubborn to imply that masks are responsible for the gigantic death rate discrepancy between Japan and western countries.
5000,If masks were that effective they would have stopped the virus dead in its tracks because western countries were regularly sitting at 80+% compliance.
5001,There must be a larger factor at play
5002,"&gt; vaccines do work and also against the current variants


That's not entirely accurate, AstraZeneca seems to be only 10% effective against the African variant."
5003,A larger studies needed to confirm but 10% protection against mild-to-moderate infections.
5004,AZ is already working on a fall booster due to the numbers.
5005,He was negative very shortly after he tested positive meaning he was also over it in December.
5006,"It’s only 14 days after now, but even going by 90 he would have been able to take it sometime in March."
5007,April is almost over.
5008,That’s still taking your sweet time even for a normal person.
5009,Any governor could have snapped their fingers and gotten one in February.
5010,"I'd rather wait an extra 30 minutes to get to the ER knowing that extra wait means those who aren't as fortunate as I am financially are taken care of, than worry about getting my 'boo boo' treated quicker selfishly."
5011,"We take pride is national healthcare not because it's 'free', but because we're willing to wait a bit of extra time if it means everyone gets access to it."
5012,Sit the fuck down
5013,Covid.
5014,Oh crap!
5015,What jealousy dude?
5016,"Despite toxic commenters and headlines, majority of us aren't sitting here all pouty because 'AMURICA GOT THEIRS FIIRTST'

&amp;#x200B;

We don't sit around here moping and are waiting our turn."
5017,"And people like myself are really happy that lives are being saved SOMEWHERE, it doesn't have to be my own country to be happy."
5018,"Cause frankly, that's bullshit nationalism"
5019,"Yeah, I would agree and also accept the AZ vaccine as a 31 year old."
5020,"I just want to emphasize that the J&amp;J is a single-dose vaccine, so it could really speed things up."
5021,&gt;it would only slightly surprise me if that death figure is missing a zero.
5022,"Looking at the shortage of hospital beds, oxygen supply and medicines that might be possible."
5023,"No it's fucking not, and never has been."
5024,"Your existence is contingent on ***our*** permission, because if we shut down NORAD Putin would gleefully rain nukes down on your heads."
5025,"Then again, we wouldn't need to."
5026,"If you tried to invade us you'd just fuck it up, same as you fuck up all your other invasions."
5027,"Do you even know how to win wars anymore, or do you actually ***plan*** to just blow shit up and then fuck up everything for decades until you finally slink out in utter defeat

Shit your big new plane the F35 doesn't even fucking work in northern climates, your entire air support would get tooled by random wandering MiGs"
5028,Well more young people have it atm.
5029,So they can also get sick (and I assume the virus spread much further in the population atm)
5030,Maybe we can share it with places like Brazil and India.
5031,The US should do the world a favor and release those stockpiled AZ vaccines
5032,I live in Canada and its funny we are restricted as fuck yet we are allowing flights come in daily and more than half of the ones that had a positive case Air India
5033,I hate headlines like these.
5034,"Being a Canadian waiting for his first jab while many younger than I having had their 2nd jab by now, I'm just fucking happy to see lives being saved no matter what country they're in."
5035,"We have limited world supply of vaccines, someone will have their lives saved somewhere and sadly lose elsewhere.. we can't magically pump a supply out that doesn't exist."
5036,"So if America shared theirs with us, that would be some of their people dying in a much more contagious (pre vacc roll out) place."
5037,"We're in this shit together, and that's that."
5038,"Holy moly, ditto situation here."
5039,Can't wait for science to find a way to vaccinate my 4 year old.
5040,"If anything saved the world, it's science and people who stood by it."
5041,Every medication has side effects.
5042,Governments have to make a calculation of the risk:benefit ratio and for the J&amp;J vaccine the benefit is greater than the very small risk.
5043,"If zero risk is the goal, only a wuhan style lockdown is good enough."
5044,"These vaccines have very little risks, creates a good shield against covid and will help us regain our daily life."
5045,Your last sentence.
5046,💯
5047,There are people ready to get vaccinated but the supply was never on par with the demand.
5048,There are massive election rallies happening there headed by none other than the prime minister.
5049,And then he comes up on TV to address the nation to follow COVID guidelines.
5050,🤦‍♂️
5051,What?
5052,And blood clots in AZ are not rare?
5053,Dont eat so much propaganda and think with your head.
5054,wtf is going on there
5055,&gt;I hate how our government handled this.
5056,No point being amazed now.
5057,"Religious meetings, Restaurant dining in closed air conditioned spaces, movie theaters in full swing."
5058,Full on election rallys.
5059,Nobody gave a fuck.
5060,"My question is that if that's how it's been in India for a year, then why now?"
5061,How come the disease didn't spread through the population already last year like it did in Europe and in Americas?
5062,India's covid deaths peaked at 1k level in September and then went down (and are now rising rapidly).
5063,"1k is of course a big absolute number, but for 1.4 billion people it's tiny."
5064,The UK with it's 1/20 population had higher daily number of deaths in January than that.
5065,"([source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries))

So, something doesn't add up."
5066,Either the Indians were far more careful last year than what you're implying or there is some hidden factor present in India that had a much bigger effect on the virus spread than the restrictions set by the government.
5067,"(Ok, the age of the population is a factor."
5068,"Indian's on average are much younger than Europeans, but even that can't explain alone the low death numbers)."

5083,"Yes it's hard, but yes it's possible to keep infections under control."
5084,Don't tell me Seoul is a tiny backwater town where people can go about their lives without being close to other humans.
5085,I don't know why you consider NZ's restrictions extreme when all of Europe and North America has been under more stress and limitations than they have.
5086,The difference is they don't have a significant proportion of people ruining it for the rest of them.
5087,"I have heard a lot about people not getting admitted to hospitals because they don't have a Covid positive report, sadly many of them die without receiving treatment."
5088,I found them in Iceland.
5089,You definitely don't need a microscope to see them.
5090,Racist against who?
5091,The article talks about a country (India) not about any race (India has many of them).
5092,The article doesn't mention anything about some races getting better treatment than others.
5093,I can't see any racist angle on the article.
5094,Could you give a link to a tweet that mentions racism related to this news?
5095,Ding ding ding.
5096,"While my wife risked her and my life treating covid patients, all our friends and family made bubbles and hung out without us."
5097,Then they complained about how hard zoom calls were for them.
5098,Meanwhile my wife and by proxy I have been struggling with depression from all the death and suffering she's dealt with at work.
5099,And my year has been great compared to those who've lost loved ones to covid.
5100,Wow Triple!
5101,What about that double media was talking about
5102,&gt; Why not just wait until you know you are over the peak and let go of restrictions then.
5103,Because we've been waiting for the promised peak ever since december
5104,Countries still have flights coming in every day.
5105,No one cares
5106,India has exported a lot more than the US.
5107,And I don't think anyone was counting on India to be a paragon of international free trade before this anyhow.
5108,but most countries that are probably worse than us have subpar testing.
5109,so its really mostly a comparison of developed countries.
5110,I'd also like to add that I find myself gasping for breath after I run on the treadmill at the gym.
5111,I do appreciate the fact that it can help me relate better to people who end up gasping for breath after catching COVID.
5112,"That being said, now that I'm fully vaccinated and I've been working from home for a year, and I'd like to know what it will take for me to not have to wear a mask that leaves me gasping for breath after a run."
5113,Especially since my gym doesn't allow people under 16 to enter.
5114,Well done... uhm... Te... ten.. Tendring!
5115,Tendring ladies and gentlemen!
5116,It was hard to get vaccinated even when the situation was under control during February and March.
5117,"So, India helped everyone else when they were doing well."
5118,Now is the time for the rest of the world to help India.
5119,Sharing resources during ups and downs is the best ways to get through this together.
5120,Nationalism and export bans are a cancer only making everything worse.
5121,Our health care in the US is top notch.
5122,It's the paying/billing part that we're criticized for
5123,The current vaccination rate is 3 million per day.
5124,Which brings it to 460 days for a population of 1.38 billion.
5125,So 1.3 years at the max.
5126,Edit: actually scratch that 120 million have already been vaccinated.
5127,So 420 days.
5128,[removed]
5129,"I mean, we're not the worst, but if you look at who is worse than us on this metric, it's not confidence boosting"
5130,I live here and work at a Sams club that now has the vaccine.
5131,I think the stall is just the people with such strong opinions.
5132,Literally today we had a corporate marketing person there trying to spread the word and get people on track to be vaccinated and when he was leaving he told us some of the rude things he was told.
5133,Most parts of MS are just VERY anti vaccination
5134,US has drained the world from any ability to purchase vaccine.
5135,Now acting like you are doing the world a service by letting them buy it from you?
5136,This is ridiculous
5137,Yeah that's why we get special treatment.
5138,Nothing to do with vaccination production or negotiation or anything good we did.
5139,The world is just *handing* us some special treatment that we didn't pay for or create.
5140,"And speak for yourself, plenty of people took it seriously and never got infected it's just a bit harder when you're not on a tiny well-off island country and you're surrounded by &gt;some&lt; dumb anti-maskers."
5141,"As an in-America example, there's a reason hawaii did better than a lot of the continental us and it's not because they're all better people."
5142,&gt;Then again we are also a long way since the Battle of Britain where it took collective effort for everyone to turn their fucking lights off at night.
5143,Is that really that hard to turn the fucking lights off so Jerry doesn't kill your neighbours --- er wear a mask?
5144,"I was dismayed to learn that in the Battle of Britain, people refusing to turn their lights off was a problem too."
5145,"Not in the cities being targeted by Germany, but in other cities whose lights could be used for navigation."

5150,The nice thing about science is it works whether or not you believe in it.
5151,Belief in science isn't the issue.
5152,"People can look at the same science, and with different sets of values, come to different conclusions."
5153,"A lot of people believe, myself included, that once vaccines are available to anyone who wants one, the disruption of mask mandates isn't worth the reduction in coronavirus spread."
5154,There aren't ten thousand countries in the world to compare to.
5155,I picked a Western nation that didn't have to infringe on any privacy or other rights and has actually eliminated covid multiple times.
5156,Korea is another great example of proper handling.
5157,Australia is another.
5158,So is Taiwan.
5159,So is Canada's Atlantic bubble.
5160,"You can pick at each example over how they're different but ultimately they do show that keeping a lid on outbreaks and minimizing spread is possible when people have their needs taken care of so they can stay home, and when they buy in as opposed to thinking they're above the collective good."
5161,"A curfew, a situation where you have to justify to your government why you are outside and can be punished for the wrong answer, is fundamentally at odds with liberal democratic values."
5162,"That we had it for 3.5 months is quite bad and can be justified if the counterfactual was healthcare breaking down, but if projections are showing that in the future it is no longer necessary it has to go ASAP imo."
5163,"Also, note that it still takes a week before this starts and current infections are actually from a week ago (5 days incubation +1-2 to report results)."
5164,There were every few infections in higher ed before this lockdown and I feel like opening it up once a week will vroeg out some unregulated meetings because us students are not locking ourselves up at 12m2 until we hang ourself out of loneliness.
5165,With all restictions for the *terrasjes* I feel like it will mostly crowd out park meetings.
5166,I doubt opening stores like this has much effect because they were open on similar less strict terms during the smart lockdown.
5167,From may 1 the vaccination is open to all above 18.
5168,We will see a large number of ppl getting vaccinated in the coming months and by sept oct I think we will have 55 percent herd immunity due to vaccination plus previous infection.
5169,"Still it is imperative to hold on to masks,sanitizers and physical distancing till we reach herd immunity."
5170,Another note during first wave it was the media who said herd immunity was reached no doctor ever said we reached herd immunity.
5171,Only 20 percent of ppl had antibodies after first wave
5172,Why every international arrival?
5173,"I'd understand that if the US were in the situation where New Zealand and Australia are, namely very low infections inside their own country, but when the US's own infection rate is tens of thousands per day, it doesn't make sense to quarantine all international arrivals."
5174,"It could still make sense to quarantine those who arrive from countries that are in worse situation than the US, such as India (probably)."
5175,In fact it would make more sense to quarantine those parts of the country where the infections are high and restrict the travel from there to those parts where it is low.
5176,That would probably have more effect than quarantining all international arrivals.
5177,"In the UK, almost nobody wears a mask outside, which I think is completely fine unless you're in a large crowd."
5178,The spread outdoors is very minimal.
5179,"Crazy to think that even at this rate it will take another 997.5 days or 2.73 years to give everyone else their first shot, to fully vaccinate everyone in India they could be looking at 4 years easily!"
5180,"Well, that's why I double-mask indoors."
5181,"When I got sick in December in TX, I didn’t get the automated call about contract tracing until over 2 weeks later."
5182,"By that point, what good could it do?"
5183,"""Avifavir"" is just one of the brand names of this drug [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir)

5184,"Yep, its pretty sad, that the US is the only large power that is barely helping others with vaccination (and the UK, but I dont consider them large)."
5185,"EU has exported almost half of its vaccines, India exported a ton too, same for China and Russia."
5186,Its pretty sad if your goodwill is behind Russia.
5187,But I'm pretty sure that the US will make a huge fuss when they start exporting when everyone and their cat is vaccinated.
5188,If you're staying at home what does it matter what people do outside of your home?
5189,The challenge with the term lockdown is that it's been used so much that it can refer to a spectrum of Non Pharmaceutical interventions ranging from government based mask mandates and business open to full capacity to Australian style lockdowns and then to Chinese style lockdowns..
5190,There's a large difference between government mandated mask mandates and private sector mask mandates.
5191,When I hear about countries trying to save money on purchasing vaccines it makes my head hurt.
5192,The daily impact of lockdowns and other restrictions will outweigh the cost of vaccinating your entire population.
5193,Which states even had this?
5194,Seems kind of unnecessary when the virus would be in the sun and humidity and people not on top of each other that they don't know

5210,The UK put in orders for 8 different vaccines in early 2020.
5211,Hardly a gamble.
5212,What the UK did is ensure we had domestic supply for at least one of them and we had to spend a lot of money to do so.
5213,What I don't get is how the death rate is still the same as last summer.

5224,India took 95 days to administer 130 million doses..The US took 101 days and China took 109 days to administer the same.
5225,New Zealand is one of a very small handful of countries that have done well.
5226,"Their success is to be commended, but most other countries across large political and cultural spectrums have failed to contain the virus even with many of them having extremely authoritarian measures in place."
5227,Even New Zealand has to maintain a ridiculously high level of alert (and they are a remote island nation) in order to prevent infections from occurring.
5228,My point is that most countries cannot replicate this because of the logistical impossibility.
5229,An outlier does not a trend make.

5250,&gt; If you can find any scientific evidence that protests actually do not contribute to infection rates I gladly read up on it.

5282,"If by cancelling the AZ vaccine postpones the vaccination plan by only days or weeks, the risks of using it outweighs the benefits."
5283,"Cancelling the Janssen vaccine would potentially postpone vaccinations by several months, during which the possible deaths from Covid could be higher than those of blood clots from a vector vaccine."
5284,"Of course as you mention, the more mRNA vaccines we get, the less dependent we are on AZ/J&amp;J."
5285,It will be interesting to see what they decide and how they defend their choice.

5288,"When I went to the Wal-Mart website and clicked on their covid-19 vaccine link,  it asks what province you're in, then takes you through the process of checking stores."

5290,Chances of getting a blood clot from Covid is 39 out of 1 million which is 8-10 times higher than the vaccine.
5291,"Yeah, getting a blood clot from a vaccine isn’t great but the odds of getting it are incredibly low and you’re much more likely to die from a myriad of different ways than you are from a blood clot from this vaccine."
5292,There are still plenty of Canadians crossing the border daily for work and school.
5293,"Who else would it be, though?"
5294,"The US is their neighbor and the only country that shares a land border with Canada, a fairly porous one at that."
5295,Germany gave nearly $1 billion to BioNTech and CureVac.
5296,And it's worth noting that Pfizer didn't take any money at all from Operation Warp Speed.
5297,&gt; Why did the rest of the world decide to try to be cheap and save money?
5298,"This is such a weirdly American sentiment, that the rest of the world is ""cheap."""

5310,"I just worry that, since there is so much social and political pressure to prove that these vaccines are safe and effective (not to mention all the money invested), they may not want to disclose all of the cases so as not reduce public confidence in these new vaccines."

5312,Just sayin’.
5313,"That is true, and it is the same with Covid itself."
5314,"Once kids and most(like 70%+) of the population has been vaccinated, the messaging will change."

5317,"Also, it's kind of like being on a plane."
5318,When the oxygen masks come down they tell you to put yours on first and then help anyone who needs it.
5319,If the US were struggling through a third (or fourth?)
5320,wave while exporting vaccine politicians would be getting crucified for it.
5321,The US threw money at the problem while other countries tried to be cheap about it.

5326,"The main source of the transmission is routine daily local contact, how do the governments not get that after more than a year?"
5327,It's a bit more complex than that.
5328,The USA protects its interests in order to maintain a strong economy (that's literally the job).
5329,The difference of opinion between the two parties lately is that strong allies protect our long term interests versus isolationism.
5330,"Historically, we know that strong allies and strong trading partners benefit a country much more than isolationism, and plenty of people continue to win elections on this message."
5331,"Now as far as vaccines go, strong allies are pointless if our local economy is shut down, so we focus on vaccinating here first, but as that winds down, we help out our allies in order of which one's pandemic impact is fucking up our trade the most."
5332,South Korea actually sounds about right.
5333,We also need to focus pretty hard on Africa and the South Pacific since China has been scooping up allies in both those regions will turbo fuck us in the long term.

5359,Those dead bodies belong to the unvaccinated.
5360,Less than 8% of Indians have been vaccinated till now.

PS: Hopeful Canadian who would love US to send a few million more vaccines to us"
5364,I think each year will only be as they think we need boosters to get through the pandemic.

The news forgets that transparency works both ways, and usually panic people with the new information, while not balancing the fear with known other factors."

5372,"Logistically speaking, it would’ve been very difficult for India to not have a huge outbreak, they only delayed it."
5373,Sadly they didn’t vaccinate enough before this outbreak to mitigate it
5374,"If those kids are actually high risk, that tiny piece of cloth (while somewhat helpful) is a pretty weak defense."
5375,"This is a traditionally made de-activated whole virus vaccine, the same type as Sinovac and Sinopharm, which bode well for all the nations using them."
5376,"There were some concerns that Sinovac initially seemed to have lower effectiveness, but it does seem to go up over time (from 50% to 73.8%) over 9 weeks according to [this study](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mrpuh2/performance_of_vaccination_with_coronavac_in_a/), so hopefully Covaxin will see similar improvement over time as well."
5377,Collateral
5378,What other answer can they give?
5379,They don't know.
5380,We went from 100m doses in 100 days to 200m doses in 100 days so soon is probably actually soon...
5381,"All that Pfizer 2 gave me was another sore arm, very minor body aches the next morning that went away in a few hours, and I had a massive migraine for half the day but that may not even be related to the shot because I get those pretty often."

5383,Yes!
5384,"And not that Michigan peaked and is now going on a downward trend, so is the country."
5385,That gives me hope that they get more consistent messaging going forward.
5386,"At the point where 60 - 70 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, I am hoping that the messaging then is not still “stay home, wear a mask, avoid crowds, etc”"
5387,There is so much to love on that headline.

5389,"As much as they ""offer"" a nice afternoon of waterboarding?"

5392,"But if they did, I would surely not accept a vaccine in order to protect my captors."
5393,i wonder which country was going to receive those shipments... and if other shipments already made it through from the same facility.
5394,The EU recognizes that it's in no one's best interest for them to impose export bans on private international companies.
5395,"They complain when the companies fall behind on their agreements with the EU, but otherwise they understand the global nature of this pandemic."
5396,"For example, the EU is not complaining about Pfizer, which has been meeting or exceeding its contract goals, while still exporting millions of doses from EU plants."
5397,"America is the only country (besides the UK, but their production is infinitely lower) that has decided not to allow exports."
5398,This is different from sharing their own doses!
5399,These are private companies being told they can't fulfill contracts with other nations before America.
5400,And it's not because they invested more or because their companies discovered the vaccine.
5401,BioNTech is German and Germany put more money into that vaccine than the US did.
5402,"AZ is British/Swiss, and got more money from the UK than the US."
5403,Janssen is Belgian.

5414,"Sorry, but you don't ""pretty much"" eradicate a disease."
5415,Coronavirus will never be eradicated.
5416,Which is why you'll need that booster shot 6 months after you complete your first round of vaccination.
5417,"Breakouts will come and go if and when some kind of ""herd immunity"" is reached."
5418,Especially if the number of population that refuses to get vaxxed remains high.
5419,The answer is likely multifaceted.
5420,Climate and geography are probably big factors.
5421,Other northern mid-west states like Illinois and Minnesota are getting fairly hard hit too.
5422,"Those states are better, but it could just be they got hit a few weeks later so they had more vaccines (and Illinois probably has more naturally immune people too)."
5423,"Other northern dense areas like PA, NJ, and NYC are still high, but they got hit harder the first several waves so they have more immunity."
5424,Don't try to reduce the cause to a single variable.
5425,There are likely many.
5426,And some of the variables are just random luck.
5427,Gather privately isn't what the vaccine was made for.
5428,It's also not the only thing that it protects you from.
5429,It was made for society to return to normalcy.
5430,All current data shows the risk for vaccinated people to live a pre pandemic lifestyle is very small.
5431,The fact the CDC wont acknowledge the science part because they are using an abundance of caution leads to eroded confidence that they using an honest science based approach.
5432,This leads to skepticism with the vaccine and its effects.
5433,Spinning the truth or just not saying everything so that we can prevent deaths may actually increase deaths because less people overall will be vaccinated.
5434,Why?
5435,"If the second dose is to reinforce antibodies to the spike protein, why does it matter if the spike protein is delivered via mRNA or adenovirus/DNA?"
5436,It might even be better to get two different vaccines if they have slight difference in spike proteins because then your body can react to mutations.
5437,"(Hypothetically, the [actual trials](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56730526) are just starting IIRC."
5438,Except Michigan has the same exact peak in cases as Indiana in the fall (same average case numbers)....but Michigan has 3 million more people.
5439,They have less natural immunity.
5440,This is nice to hear as someone who is currently experiencing just about every vaccine side effect lol.
5441,Definitely worth it
5442,"&gt; Catching covid, especially here in the UK right now, is overwhelming unlikely."
5443,Because of vaccines (AZ being the most used) have driven it down.
5444,Do you think Covid just disappeared by itself?
5445,Or do you just think you're so *special* that you're not worthy of taking this tiny risk of vaccine side effects that everyone else did to help us all get out of this mess?
5446,"It's such a selfish attitude, it really is."
5447,you’re seeing the track and trace through the eyes of *your* experience in the USA.
5448,"If you think everywhere has the same attitude to tracking and tracing, you’re wrong."
5449,"If Americans don’t like it, they won’t want to be going to those countries."
5450,What’s laughable is you thinking everywhere is like America.
5451,"Typical, but still laughable."
5452,"Wait, is that true?"
5453,"I thought odds of Covid death amongst young were low, but not that low."
5454,"Yes, forgot about them!"
5455,Or until aliens suddenly appear and nuke the humanity off the surface of the Earth.
5456,"Considering that we are lacking data on both scenarios, it's impossible to tell which is more likely."
5457,I'm worried about this too... Herd immunity doesn't take hold until we're at the top of the sigmoid function and it gets worse exponentially fast even between the cutoff when herd immunity starts.
5458,I think we need more like 85% with covid before herd immunity starts.
5459,Also if you fall BELOW 85% it can get worse FAST again.
5460,Obviously I hope I'm wrong.
5461,Bad comparison.
5462,The chance of getting struck by lightning is more or less a static number based on years of data.
5463,The % of vaccinated people who then got covid will continue to increase.
5464,That stat is a snapshot in time.
5465,"Hell yeah, thank you."
5466,I will start trying that!
5467,The fuck are you talking about lol?
5468,"It’s immune mediated thrombocytopenia, not a “blood disease”."
5469,I’m sorry what medical school did you go to again?
5470,"We can treat it, if you read the article you’ll find that 12 out of the people that got it died, so it’s not like it even kills every one that gets it."
5471,I think the 1st one is worse for a lot of people who had Covid
5472,That article is dated 3/12 and today is 4/21.
5473,So awesome to be downvoted for bringing actual math into a discussion.
5474,I’m talking about MIchigan RIGHT NOW.
5475,That’s the question - why is Michigan spiking?
5476,My point is that comment I am replying to is invalid logic.
5477,The historic cases per capita are similar for MI and big states.
5478,The good news is cases there have clearly peaked.
5479,"What’s amazing is it is also reflected in US cases, which are now on a downward trend."
5480,"So hilarious that the once-scary, never been tried ""DNA vaccine"" Moderna/Pfizer is now the super safe refuge for all the vaccine scaredy cats, while the vaccines using older, tested technology are to be avoided at all costs."
5481,ok
5482,"&gt; The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100% 

Which likely means that there was an issue with the trial and it's not really that high."
5483,Ah.
5484,Try WalMart scheduling just after midnight.
5485,They only have you make the first appointment.
5486,You need to realize that other variants of concern are a thing and nothing this person said is irrational.
5487,It also doesn't effect you and keeps other people who aren't or can't get vaccinated safe.
5488,Educate yourself.

5514,"Like, they mean precisely the same thing."
5515,"Where are you getting a distinction between blood clot and ""lethal blood disorder?"""
5516,Yes of course but we need to prioritize our limited vaccine rollout capacity to deal with the most likely to form variants and also die of the disease.
5517,"Imagine if every 1st world country decided to focus on getting every 75 year old and older in the world vaccinated first, before focusing on their entire younger populations."
5518,"We would see global death tolls plummet, as well as reducing the pool of those with weaker immune systems for the virus to mutate within."
5519,&gt; Go back to school and study how percentages work.
5520,Idiot.
5521,What is most interesting to me is that the mortality rate seems to be quite a bit lower for the more recent 30 cases than we were seeing when the side effect was first reported.
5522,Hopefully this is related to the treatment and diagnosis protocols that have emerged and this trend will continue.
5523,Got the first Pfizer shot yesterday and I feel more sick today than I did when I actually had Covid.
5524,This sucks.
5525,I thought the second one was supposed to be the doozy
5526,That's not an alter...you totally changed it to have a different meaning.

5542,"If Florida was testing at the rate Michigan is it’s raw positive cases would likely dwarf Michigan, and Florida has the most variants spreading of any state."

Also, the risks to children from COVID are so low that it genuinely might make no sense to vaccinate them given the side effects of the vaccine"

5594,"No, T was elected."
5595,"His cronies like Ben Carson, Robert Redfield, Alex Azar, were appointed by T because of their willingness to toe the line."
5596,"Lead Paragraphs:

Several cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617 have now been detected in the UK."
5597,"**Prof Sharon Peacock, Director of COG-UK, and Professor of Public Health and Microbiology, University of Cambridge, said:**

*What do we currently know about B.1.617?"
5598,"*

“This variant has been around for some time."
5599,The first B.1.617 genome in the global database (GISAID) dates back to 5 Oct 2020.
5600,"India has submitted the most B.1.617 genomes, following in frequency by UK and the US."
5601,"Based on genome information, B.1.617 was first detected in the UK on 22 Feb 2021, and in the US on 23 Feb 2021."
5602,B.1.617 has been identified from genome data submitted by 21 countries as of 19 April 2021.
5603,The relative frequency of genomes from different countries is biased because of the different amounts of sequencing being performed in different countries; a country sequencing a high number of genomes may be more likely to detect variants.
5604,"Friend of mine is from India, his dad (in India) had two shots of vaccine and still got symptomatic covid."
5605,His dad's coworker who'd also had two shots was in hospital.
5606,Apparently it's a variant strain.
5607,&gt; It’s crazy how simple this is yet it’s rarely stated.
5608,Hopefully the CDC starts saying the same soon.
5609,"They are experts in infectious diseases, not human behavior."
5610,I expect that they will continue to avoid this topic until state and local governments straight up ignore them.
5611,But it’s not like people are *only* ever seeing people wearing masks.
5612,"At home, with other vaccinated people, with people in a pod, with people outdoors, hell, even on TV, kids and adults are presented with unmasked people the majority of the time."
5613,If going to Walmart is the only time you see other people there are psychological issues well beyond masking.
5614,The curve of cases + positivity rate in Michigan begs to differ?
5615,Covishield and covaxin
5616,"As you see, things get worse within 29 days."
5617,"Well this is the upper limit of the observed sample size, who knows if  this disease evolves in a lot of more people and gets serious in a few months?"
5618,"Also the 59 cases were vaccineted before/earlie April, the 4.2 million jabs reference mid april total vaccinations."
5619,So it's totally misleading to calculate the risk based on these numbers.
5620,People would rather ignore the examples you cited than directly address them.
5621,That's probably because a few of the symptoms of the thrombosis are the same as the listed side effects of the vaccine (feeling of coldness and headaches).
5622,"I got the vaccine a few days before the thrombosis were reported and I had these exact side effects and to be honest, I wouldn't have known when to see a doctor because of that."
5623,But now we are all aware of the symptoms of a thrombosis and we know when to take it seriously and go to a doctor.
5624,I’ve been using a paper towel to open bathroom doors for years because I know at least 50% of people aren’t washing their hands after they use the bathroom.
5625,I’m not putting my clean hands on that handle
5626,I don't know that the two above posts are incorrect in their risk assessment.
5627,Take a look at [this presentation](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/976877/CovidStats_07-04-21-final.pdf) from the UK's Winston Center for Risk and Evidence Communication.
5628,"For folks in the age 20-29 bracket, the risk calculus between getting the AZ vaccine and waiting for a different vaccine is not at all clear cut."
5629,"If you're low-risk, or you expect the wait to be significantly less than 16 weeks, waiting might even be the safer option."
5630,"You can make an argument that this level of risk isn't worth fretting about, but I think that argument is still a little murky."
5631,The risk of dying from the AZ vaccine seems to be on the order of 3 micromorts or so.
5632,Possibly 2-3x that if the risk is concentrated in certain age groups.
5633,"In England, the average person's risk of dying of ""non-natural causes"" is [a bit under 1 micromort per day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort), or about 300 in a year."
5634,"So, in the year you get your AZ shot, you've increase your total yearly risk of death by ""non-natural causes"" by around 1-3%."
5635,"That's small, but it's not negligible - it's the sort of risk you'd take because there's a good reason to take it."
5636,"If you're in a country where case rates are high and vaccinations are low, I think that's a good reason to take it."
5637,"But if you're a young person in a country with high vaccination rates, low case rates, and a supply of other vaccines, it might be reasonable to wait a few weeks."
5638,Crossover was planned - I was in the trial and the crossover was explained to me back in January.
5639,I believe the plan was to start crossover once they’re almost ready to send data to the FDA so I’d expect an announcement soon.
5640,The pandemic is over for me.
5641,"Michigan hasn't even begun to peak, when it peaks all of Philadelphia is gunna feel it."
5642,There is nothing considerate about being anti-science.
5643,All you do is add fuel to the fire of anti-maskers when you do things like that
5644,We would need to see the number of men vs women that have actually received that vaccine.
5645,"The reason is that in the younger age bracket it is mostly healthcare workers who did, and they tend to skew female."
5646,But only 5000 people out of 77 million people have gotten infection with most of those people having mild infections.
5647,"Also, according to your logic, JJ should now redirect their vaccines to EU, since US blocked it for two weeks."
5648,This is 5th grader’s logic.
5649,Both yours and AZ (if they had the same approach)
5650,"It's dumb in my case mentioned above because the entire school shut down to quarantine and she was like ""nah."
5651,"Not only will I not get tested, I'm gonna go see a TON of family."""
5652,"I think you basically said it — we have three choices: make more people get vaccines, implement a way to check vaccine status, or mask up for a little longer until everyone is eligible."
5653,"People are still too stubborn to get vaccines in the numbers necessary, people are screeching about vaccine passports, so the only option left is to mask slightly longer."
5654,Just a troll.
5655,You totally missed the point of the article.
5656,"&gt;People high in PR tend to react to attempts at persuasion with hostility and counter-arguments, believing that they are defending their freedom."
5657,"Regardless of whether or not you believe the ""anti-maskers"" are wrong, *they* believe they are right and any attempt to persuade them that they are wrong simply reinforces their belief that their rights are being infringed."
5658,"The question raised in the article is ""how do we convince the people who refuse to be convinced?""."
5659,What you are doing does not work.
5660,This is a dumb and pointless article lol...do they not expect people to look past the headlines anymore?
5661,&gt;There's a difference between vaccinating an 18-year-old American brat that can't be arsed to wear a mask for another month and wants to party and a 60-year-old with underlying health conditions in another part of the world risking their life just by going to work to support their family.
5662,You're completely not understanding the situation in India right now.
5663,The reason it's so bad is exactly because they've been doing what you mentioned in the first part of the sentence.
5664,&gt; Just more COVID theater that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the science especially recent studies that show vaccinated people don’t spread the virus.
5665,Its a few small studies and no announcement from the CDC.
5666,Nothing will change until the CDC say its OK to drop the masks.
5667,And add bingo...
5668,"Also, I think you are not considering how not seeing people's faces affects humans psychologically and developmentally for children."
5669,The face is very very important for communication and it literally has its own part of your brain that is devoted to recognizing and interpreting faces.
5670,"There is some harm with mask wearing, during the height of the pandemic that harm was far outweighed by the benefits of wearing masks and preventing Mass death."
5671,"But once the mass death has stopped, we need to stop wearing masks."
5672,"There's also a big chunk of people who are not *excited* to get it (like most of this sub) but are *willing* to get it, once overly convenient to them."
5673,"Basically if it's readily available at the exact location where they usually get their prescriptions filled, on a walk-in basis, at any hour and any day of the week, when they happen to not be in a rush to get home from work (and remember to do it)."
5674,"If they heard about the mad dash for appointments in March, and then went about their lives not really looking up again until May and going ""Oh wow, how is it May already?"""
5675,not realizing that the dash is pretty much over.
5676,And then they might check out their pharmacy to see what's up.
5677,Hopefully!
5678,Yep.
5679,E484K and E484Q mutations.
5680,Nothing new.
5681,Carry on
5682,"As far as I’ve heard in my state (NC) the only free public options are our two statewide virtual charter schools, both of which have a significant waiting list."
5683,I think the presence of that list suggests the state should probably open a third.
5684,"CVST is pretty treatable if caught early, I'd imagine everyone receiving an adenovirus vaccine is now being told to report to A&amp;E if they develop a persistent heading lasting more than 24-48hrs."
5685,Also if they're avoiding the demographics where CVST is more common the cases that do occur are probably less severe.
5686,"Yeah, the day I got my first dose (about a week ago) was the day they started letting people come into the mass-vax site without any appointment."
5687,"On the one hand widening availability is cool since there are a lot of people that have volatile schedules and wouldn't be able to keep a set appointment, but it's kind of a worrying sign about demand if appointments aren't filling out the available doses entirely."
5688,"In places that have administered a lot of shots compared to elsewhere it seems like things are already starting to top out, way before where you'd hope things top out."
5689,Even more so: In Germany there were 59 cases for 4.2 million doses given.
5690,"Janssen is 8 cases for 7 million shots, translating to 1 in 875k."
5691,AZ would be roughly 1 in 70k.
5692,"That's a huge difference, especially if you consider that the US is vaccinating a much more diverse age group than the Germans are."
5693,You said that EU halted the use of AZ.
5694,Which it didn’t.
5695,Five or six countries out of 27 did.
5696,"Also, the main issue that UE as a whole has with AZ is that they don’t get enough orders."
5697,This was happening before it turned out that AZ causes clotting issues.
5698,There are situations in which children must be brought places — inadequate childcare for one.
5699,But also — children deserve not to be sequestered in their homes when the tiniest inconvenience for others could mean they can participate in society.
5700,Is this also a two shot?
5701,"(Covaxin)

I have friends that got the two shot there, but weren't sure which one they got rofl"
5702,"yep, tobacco is utterly disgusting"
5703,Same for Florida (assuming you are Texas).
5704,I see a few less maskers in the suburbs in the last few weeks but not a whole lot.
5705,Sayonara Olympics 😥
5706,What reason would you have for the fully vaccinated adults to continue to wear masks?
5707,"At this point we only do it essentially because enforcement of mass policies is problematic and people will fake their vaccine card etc

I think you can make a good argument that the kids who are in schools should continue to wear masks until they can get vaccinated, but if we're being honest the vaccinated people continuing to wear masks while being asymptomatic is basically virtue signaling at this point."
5708,Again I'm saying an asymptomatic vaccinated person.
5709,There is no reason for that person to wear a mask other than social pressure.
5710,Can we stop propagating the lie that the vaccines prevent severe covid with 100% efficacy?
5711,"None of the trials have enough positive cases to make such a claim, and observational studies from Isreal and the US on the Pfizer vaccine show the hospitalization and death rates among those who get COVID and are vaccinated is similar to those who get COVID and aren't vaccinated."
5712,"https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/15/cdc-reports-5800-covid-19-infections-74-deaths-in-fully-vaccinated-people

While the factor of ~15 reduction in getting COVID is a great reason to get the vaccine, the vaccinated are not immune to death, and it's dangerous to say so."
5713,&gt; You are going to have everyone who will never get a vaccine not wearing masks because it’s to hard to enforce.
5714,We've learned that the CDC is great at the hard science but absolute shit at managing/encouraging human behavior.
5715,"They were super concerned early on about mask hoarding, so they told people not to wear them and we saw how that ended being an opening for anti-maskers to make it political."
5716,"There is going to be a subset that will lie for sure, but I have a feeling its going to be such a small percentage."
5717,"The bigger problem is if they continue to push that vaccines = still need to wear a mask, social distance, you're going to get a lot of apathetic non-vaccinated people who don't see the point in getting shots especially if the virus is not a danger to themselves."
5718,"If this was simply a health policy concern, then the CDC would be absolutely correct to continue encouraging the wearing of masks but there are a lot of other factors at play here beyond simply health policy, there are societal, economic, political consequences that have to be factored in here and frankly the CDC just isn't good at that stuff."
5719,Not really?
5720,"The CDC says the Federal government has distributed 272 mln vaccines to the states/wherever they deliver them to, which is more than the 260 mln number listed in the article."
5721,Unless you’re using some number other than the 260 mln listed in the article?
5722,"I actually like the ""irrelephant"", misspell and will now attempt to use it in conversation."
5723,It's like a new way of referring to the elephant in the room...
5724,With confidence intervals so wide it could be anything from 0% to 55% as it was based on 2000 people and a handful of infections.
5725,"If it really didn't work, surely places that vaccinate heavily with AZ like the UK should start seeing a large uptick in SA variant cases by now, wouldn't they?"
5726,"Oh also, the white house has also issued guidelines to states that says 14 days of decreasing numbers to lossen restrictions... Is that not metricy enough?"
5727,"you seem to be saying that because the government can't tell you to have a license to date, the government can't tell you to have a license to drive"
5728,There are some all virtual schools that operate in many states that any child living in the state can attend free of charge instead of the local school.
5729,"The parent would have to be around to support their kid, but the kid would have a teacher to video chat with and would have lessons that would be done through the computer."
5730,"Israel is also enforcing vaccine passports, which makes it easier to declare victory."
5731,No vaccine passport?
5732,Ya staying home...
5733,"Same in WV but here in WV the vaccines are crawling to a halt, according to the WV Department of health website vaccines are slowing,

Monday 19th 956 first doses

Sunday 18th 373 first doses

by comparison 

March 26th 16,826 first doses, the state has only vaccinated 687,045 first doses, and people are just not getting them now, every since the governor all but opened everything up, and as of Monday removed some of the masks mandates, people just assume  that covid is over and get back to it, the state has not been seeing an average of 400 cases a day over the last 14 days, in 1 county here in WV health officials contacted 15,000 people telling them the vaccine was ready for them and 15 people made appointments."
5734,"well, would you rather die from smoking weed 

or die from bursted blood pressure/heart failure from tempers"
5735,"Medina home price in San Diego: $719k

Median home price in Toronto: $1 million

Median home price in Vancouver: $1.2 million

All from a quick Google search"
5736,Because you are not Poland your are part of EU.
5737,It was EU v AZ and these are consequences.
5738,I mean did you really expect to be status quo after almost every EU stated they wont use AZ anymore because of dangerous blood clots and every media outlet spread the word.
5739,Now everyone is hesitant to take AZ because of EU.
5740,I am sorry Poland cought in the middle of this but as far as i know EU is making deal with AZ.
5741,Does Poland has separate deal with AZ?
5742,And the cure?
5743,Bricks
5744,I'm reading [The Four Tendencies ](https://gretchenrubin.com/take-the-quiz) and can't recommend this enough.
5745,The tendency to hate rules is a certain personality tendency.
5746,It helped me develop coping skills when dealing with the public concerning masks.
5747,"No, they aren't."
5748,How do i convince my brother to get the vaccine?
5749,"He's pretty deep in the ""vaccine conspiracy rabbit hole"" and he gets angry when i bring up the subject."
5750,I don't want him to get sick and then get other family members ill.
5751,"It's not an opinion, it's fact."
5752,Look at the changes that osteopathic medicine was forced to undergo in order to be equivalent to allopathic medicine.
5753,"DOs had to increase years of education, had to increase areas of education, and had to complete equal residences as MDs."
5754,It eventually had to get to the point that DO and MD education was identical in order for DOs to have full practice authority.
5755,What did NPs do in order to get full practice authority?
5756,Did they increase their medical education?
5757,Did they agree to do multip-year required residencies?
5758,"No, they lobbied."
5759,Spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying state legislators into introducing and passing laws allowing for NP independent practice.
5760,Absolutely.
5761,"With the flu, we well understand the disease, its dangers, and its long term consequences."
5762,"We’ve developed an annual shot, and we understand that this risk is one we have to assume because this is about the best we do for now."
5763,"With Covid, it’s different — no one is asking to mask and distance indefinitely, just for a couple more months until vaccine approval for children."
5764,"It seems a reasonable ask for waiting until everyone is eligible for the vaccine, instead of defining “everyone” to  exclude children, just to enjoy a couple extra months without inconvenience."
5765,I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you're one of those people that won't get vaccinated because you did research on google and found an article that's linked to blood clots.
5766,Although the data shows it's an extremely low risk you disregard the positive benefits of it.
5767,Vaccinate all 11 people who vote in local election year primaries.
5768,.007 chance of being struck by Bond.
5769,James Bond in your lifetime.
5770,“Irrelephant” hahahaha that’s golden
5771,Why would a child die from covid
5772,"It's incredibly annoying, but it isn't going to change the fact that the social end of Covid in America is basically a month or two away."
5773,"goddammit, if people put half as much political capital into helping the situation."
5774,"like, that's a fuckload of work just to make sure everyone can still get covid if they want, cause, this is america, we're very, very free here"
5775,You really think people aren't getting vaccinated because they're not being told an exact number of deaths the US finds acceptable?
5776,The messaging is pretty consistent - we need to hit around 60-70% vaccinated.
5777,What more do you really need?
5778,do you think covid will be pretty much over in canada in a year?
5779,It's a pandemic.
5780,Let's not act like Covid wouldn't have spread to Canada without the US.
5781,I’m sure this has been asked millions of times but when can we expect restrictions to go away in the us?
5782,"Not a shift in focus, the plan was always to start second doses after 12 weeks."
5783,You are right that there is a world where the backup is needed.
5784,But everyday the probability of that happening gets exceedingly small.
5785,Compared to the surety that letting them be exported will save lives globally.
5786,Even if not all are exported but some calculated amount.
5787,One week’s worth for US could mean a lot to other smaller countries like Canada
5788,Well I’m obviously not talking about situations where you might be standing right next to someone.
5789,I’m gonna wear a mask if I’m shopping at an outdoor farmers market or something like that.
5790,But some people are wearing masks while they’re out on a walk and there’s nobody within a 10m radius.
5791,The chances of spreading Covid to someone outdoors who isn’t in close proximity are effectively 0%.
5792,Meh.
5793,"I don't know Indiana's distribution strategy, but I know they have Walmarts there, I know that Walmarts there are offering vaccines, I know the site can scrape Walmart and I know the Walmarts there aren't showing availability."
5794,"You can choose to believe some conspiracy theory about Indiana's state government adopting a vaccine strategy that's hidden from site or you can believe that uptake in Indiana is similar to Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota."
5795,The choice is yours.
5796,"Not too similar, more like 1/900k for Janssen (based on the known 8 cases)."
5797,I live in Detroit and it's pretty bad here.
5798,"&amp;#x200B;

Most small businesses have zero mask compliance."
5799,"I'm fully vaccinated and it's sad that I can't even begin to get a taste of the ""normal"" life."
5800,"Things like theaters, gyms are still completely unsafe in my opinion given how likely it is they'll be full of unmasked, likely unvaccinated people."
5801,I've always wanted to move out to this state.
5802,I've always had the feeling the general population here was just full of dead-end idiots.
5803,Now I have proof.
5804,Bharat biotech has said that there's virtually no side effects or only very minor side effects with their vaccine.
5805,They're actually starting trials on children soon I believe because of the low risk to side effects.
5806,Yes.
5807,Our work has to use them per legal department.
5808,"People can shit on Ohio as much as they want, but it's been a great place to ride out this pandemic."
5809,"Mask compliance indoors is very high here in Columbus, but people here generally don't wear masks in nonsensical situations and I've never seen the kind of outdoor confrontation that seems common on the coasts."
5810,/r/antiwork is in shambles
5811,There is also Novavax which I think is a different type but I don't fully understand how it works.
5812,Imagine arguing for public health measures and using your personal comfort as a talking point
5813,"Hey man, I know it's not really my place to say anything but I see you commenting on this thread a lot and it sounds like you're pretty distressed about the world right now and your family is certainly not helping."
5814,Just wanna say that I've been there as well (especially before the vaccine rollout started and we knew less about the variants).
5815,It might help to try to get off reddit a little bit.
5816,Especially this thread has a lot of toxic opinions and people who act like they know what's gonna happen when no one really does.
5817,Good luck bro

5824,Amazing results
5825,"And I can not wait for people like you, to get what you deserve."
5826,What comment OP said is most likely true.
5827,"The blood clots can be treated, but not necessarily successfully."
5828,"Whether the spike protein, the adenovirus or something else is causing the clots is yet to be determined, though."
5829,"It’s a moral dilemma: yes, more people will die now, because we’re vaccinating slower."
5830,But can you sacrifice a few young people to save many?
5831,This is not easily answered.
5832,"I'm ugly and don't like I people anyway, works for me."
5833,:)
5834,"&gt;Not the person you are replying to, but I’m someone who teaches and wears a mask 40+ hours a week and I think adults who whine about masks are acting like toddlers."
5835,Don’t assume that everyone who wears one for a long time agrees with you.
5836,No one is advocating to take away your ability to continue to wear a mask.
5837,People are saying that at some point in the near future the public health benefits of masks are going to be reduced to the point that the government will let individuals decide whether it's right for them.
5838,"""Don't assume everyone agrees with you"" you say, but you're saying that you want everyone to be forced to do the same thing as you."
5839,That's odd.
5840,The best way to combat apathy is to make it really easy to get the vaccine.
5841,"The appointment-only mass vaccination sites were great for the start of the vaccination campaign, but we need to start switching to smaller walk-in clinics in convenient locations, and eventually to neighborhood pharmacies taking walk-ins."
5842,Like back in the day when they used to snort ground up smallpox scabs
5843,And yet again...THE VARIANTS are mentioned 🤪I will say this until I’m blue in the face: Mentioning variants without any context or nuance is irresponsible journalism that stems from either intentional fear mongering or ignorance.
5844,Neither is an excuse.
5845,Come on media.
5846,Do better.
5847,Now do Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine!
5848,"&gt; Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O) has supplied 260 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine globally, with over 60% supplied to countries outside China, the company's chief executive Yin Weidong said on Tuesday."
5849,"The way this article is reported seems to indicate that 260 million is the amount produced, and of that, ~60% has been exported."
5850,"I’m only going off the number in this article, so I might be missing something."
5851,"For the last year I have heard so many ""theories"", and yet the virus continues to grow stronger and mutates."
5852,"Wearing a mask and avoiding crowds, will continue to protect the people I love."
5853,"I started to ""lock down"" in Feb 2020 with 2 highly susceptible people."
5854,We have been 100% healthy and I will continue with my caution for the foreseeable future.
5855,(even being vaccinated)
5856,Thanks to asymptomatic spread it would have made it to even the darkest corners of the world.
5857,It just would have taken longer.
5858,"But that comment will not be removed for ""misinformation."""
5859,"You are allowed to lie as long as it's about a ""Surge"" that doesn't exist."
5860,Not really.
5861,Up to 1% of women on birth control get blood clots or 1 in 100.
5862,"Yes this is a specific type of clot that is dangerous if not recognized but the rate is 1.4 per 100,000 based on German numbers."
5863,The rate of the same type of clot developing if you are infected with Covid-19 is at least 39 in a million on top of all the other issues the virus causes.
5864,Drugs and vaccines have side effects.
5865,The massive amount of uneducated press covering this makes things seems worse than they are.
5866,The vaccine is safe on a population basis.
5867,are we talking about this july?
5868,I think masking outdoors is partly a case of keeping it simple.
5869,"Just, wear a mask, is simple."
5870,"When we get to, wear a mask except in scenario A or if B or if C or D, it starts getting complicated."
5871,I think the possible benefit outweighs the drawback anyway.
5872,"Indoors or outdoors, if a person sneezes in your face, I would think that you are done, or do we need a million dollar study on that first?"
5873,"&gt;Despite what people on this sub like to claim, children are at risk for serious long-term illness from the virus and it is not right to put them in harm’s way just to make people’s faces more comfortable."
5874,Why does the CDC disagree with you?
5875,What a slanted and flat out wrong way to frame your comment.
5876,Can you provide any source to this claim?
5877,&gt;The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.
5878,"However, infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19."
5879,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm
5880,If they come up with more effective therapeutics along with the current vaccines that’s the end of this virus being a significant threat.
5881,For most people the vaccine alone should be enough to go back to mostly normal.
5882,Are we subsidizing businesses to hire people to do this checking?
5883,There aren’t personnel to do this and businesses don’t want to put their front line employees in that position to have to be gate keepers.
5884,"I completely agree with the idea of needing to incentivize this, I just think there are not systems in place to facilitate this specific idea."
5885,"Yeah, they have solid BBQ as well."

5887,I see it in my country too.

5898,Maybe they'd rather put a mask on and leave it on rather than taking the mask off and on repeatedly?
5899,"That way, they don't have to deal with ""where do I store it"" or ""can I get it back on without having contaminated the inner surface of the mask"" issues."
5900,Here’s what I don’t get though.
5901,I mean it all started from one person in China.
5902,Once it spread just a little bit from there it seems it was pretty much inevitable that it was going to reach practically every part of the globe in some capacity.
5903,"Immunity, whether it’s from a past infection or a vaccine, may last a long time, but it won’t last forever."
5904,"On top of that, a good chunk of the population is never going to consent to a vaccine."
5905,"In, say, 10 years, when less than half the population is immune, why wouldn’t 4 infections turn into 10, into 50, into 10,000?"
5906,And I don’t think I’d really believe you if you said that people are going to be disciplined in getting regular booster shots.
5907,I genuinely don’t know what I’m talking about.
5908,"I’m not saying I expect these events to play out this way, I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t, so someone help me out please."
5909,"You should read that data, AZ is shit."
5910,"As a German, the source of this article 'Bild' is exceptionally bad journalism."
5911,It's well known for misinformation and fear mongering.
5912,Please don't take it as a credible source of information.
5913,"I know, that's ridiculously **bad**."
5914,The main number you probably want to look at is preventing hospitalizations/severe cases.
5915,I think all of the main vaccines pretty much prevent all severe cases.
5916,Indiana's 7 day individual positivity rate is 13.6% today so it's on the rise
5917,Well pumping out vaccines is kinda what India does so here’s to hoping!
5918,[removed]
5919,Agreed and think that will happen sooner rather than later.
5920,It's already happening in rural areas and much of the South.
5921,"We'll be in a position where we could theoretically give more shots in large cities for a couple of weeks (if we added supersites, etc."
5922,"), but even that is unlikely to last long."
5923,"By this time in May, your average suburban Walgreens isn't going to be able to fill all their slots."
5924,I don’t understand.
5925,If you’re all vaccinated then still being masked is just silly and paranoid.
5926,At this point still being masked is pandering to those who refuse the vaccine because they’re crazy antivaxxers or something.
5927,The chances of you still being able to transmit the virus once fully vaccinated is very very low to none.
5928,It does say only when a fully vaccinated individual meets another fully vacinated individual.
5929,"Which, as the main benefit of masks/distancing is protecting you in general from people you do not know (e.g."
5930,"when on public transport, shopping etc), doesn't change the times when most people would actually be wearing  a mask or socially distancing."
5931,Everyone forgets earlier in the year where he forced out the guy that was fixing the subway because if it wasn't in crisis he couldn't funnel money to his cronies without oversight.
5932,I guess you’re right?
5933,"I’ve read an article from a German University that explained in detail how to handle the AZ blood clots because the auto immune reaction closely resembles a comparably common side effect of heparin, a blood thinner."
5934,I‘m not sure if having a treatment makes it any less lethal though (like eg.
5935,"the official late stage rabies treatment, which has a 0% success rate)."

5938,I got the J&amp;J too.
5939,In the least it is virtually a guarantee you won't get serious illness which is huge imho.
5940,"Also, not many people seem to be asymptomatic with J&amp;J or any other vaccines really, so that's really good too."
5941,Although that sounds really hard to quantify.
5942,"I'm sure if we need to get a booster or something later on, we'll get word of it."
5943,"After 12 months of TV experts making claims that are proven ridiculous just a few months later, I think everything on the massive grain of salt."
5944,"Just plain out a couple obvious ones, a year ago everybody proclaimed the reason coronavirus cases were so high in New York was because of their high population concentration, so who wins the award for highest case counts of Covid now?"
5945,North and South Dakota!
5946,"Two months ago everybody was reclaiming the reason case counts were so low in India was because they were all young and also they had all been exposed to all kinds of germs and head natural immunity, two months later?"
5947,Cases are through the freaking roof!
5948,There is no real logic at work when people say things like that.
5949,It's pure emotional fear coupled with a boatload of misinformation.
5950,I know someone who wasn't willing to get the vaccine and ended up getting covid.
5951,"Once they realized how bad the symptoms really were (not ""just the flu"") before they were even sick enough to need hospitalization, they were more than willing to take the antibody therapy available."
5952,It took actually getting the virus for it to become real to them.
5953,"I get that argument, I really do—- but then why are we sitting on 20 million AZ vaccines we aren’t using?"
5954,Why not ship them out?
5955,Why isn’t the WH administration working on developing a plan to ship the vaccines out once we hit a threshold?
5956,Why won’t they tell us what the threshold is?
5957,"No, it's very good."
5958,70% of the time you won't get ANY infection.
5959,It would be interesting to find out if those men were on hormones to transition.
5960,It would explain the anomalies.
5961,Eight billion Petri dishes.
5962,The successful ones get to try again.
5963,Intellectual property has nothing to really do with it.
5964,"India has its own vaccine, it could force the release of said IP and divert all its funds towards it... but it isn’t."
5965,So there’s little reason why letting the Moderna or J&amp;J vaccine be let go would increase the vaccine flow.
5966,"It would just let other companies profit off it, make mistakes and increase vaccine hesitancy."
5967,Texas's mask mandate was one of the weakest in the country and relied on businesses for enforcement to begin with.
5968,Businesses generally chose to continue enforcing it even after the mandate was lifted.
5969,[removed]
5970,Well.
5971,I was F’d up after Pfizer shot 2.
5972,"No fever, just bad headache and couldn’t stay awake."
5973,Started 12 hours after I got it.
5974,Ended 12 hours after it started.
5975,You got this!
5976,My second shot was absolutely painless but my first felt like I'd mashed my shoulder with a cinder block.
5977,So strange.
5978,Mandatory vaccination is quite common here.
5979,"As a child (and baby) you have to go through a set of mandatory shots if you want to be able to go to kindergarten, school etc."
5980,The problem with covid mandatory vaccination is that it is new and quite some people don’t trust the vaccines to be safe.
5981,"If covid stays around, I could see in a few years that it would become mandatory and part of these shots you get as a kid, but I hope they don’t try to force that too soon."
5982,The biggest issue is morons who won’t get vaccinated.
5983,How do you convince them to take it when you are being absurd and losing even more credibility by treating vaccinated people like they only received a shot of saline?
5984,Good.
5985,People will have had a chance to get vaccinated by then.
5986,"If people want to wear masks to feel better about themselves, they can do that."
5987,Could be worse.
5988,He could be Cuomo.
5989,"it will take the EU 6-9 months to vaccinate enough people for this to be relevant, so it all lines up"
5990,Share before they take care of their own?
5991,No way and stop acting like they should.
5992,"Cases were very low in the summer, though, so it evened out."
5993,"Yeah, this is my thought too."
5994,"I mean, I get a flu shot every year, what difference does it make if I get a Covid shot too?"
5995,"For that matter, the mRNA vaccine makers are getting into the flu shot business."
5996,"2-3 years from now we might just be getting our annual ""respiratory virus booster"" to cover both."
5997,They were not collapsing UNTIL the variants developed.
5998,They had Covid before but were fine until the variants began ravaging their countries
5999,The people who really don't want to wear masks are already not wearing them.
6000,Depends on your goal though.
6001,If its deaths - then absolutely elderly first.
6002,"If its overall spread, I would argue younger first."
6003,But I'm not a statistician.
6004,I waited my turn patiently until my number was called.
6005,What is everyone's predictions for when businesses will drop masks and other restrictions?
6006,"Places like Target, grocery stores, Starbucks allowing people to sit inside again, etc."
6007,Will they drop it once more states drop restrictions?
6008,"Even in states with no mask mandate these places still require masks, even if it's not enforced."
6009,Honestly they can go fuck themselves.
6010,I'm sorry.
6011,Even rural people go to church/restaurants/grocery stores/work/bars.
6012,Tbh it’s a major problem.
6013,"The US needs to start sharing its vaccines, or a variant worse than India and Brazil’s is gonna set us back."
6014,"Tell him if there is such an amazingly powerful conspiracy that could pull all this off, he’s but a flea on the back of a rat on the titanic thinking he has some kind of say so in reaching Tahiti."
6015,Why is this downvoted lol
6016,It literally doesn’t have to happen.
6017,Read any article in the past year warning about the consequences of intellectual property with this vaccine.
6018,There’s no reason for this to happen other than greed.
6019,Get your head out of your ass.
6020,Don’t forget the 0.03% mortality rate of the coronavirus itself!
6021,2 days until im 2 weeks out from my second shot.
6022,I’m so pumped.
6023,I live in a tourist town and it’s finally back so it couldn’t come at a better time
6024,[deleted]
6025,What are the demographics of people getting these blood clots?
6026,"The bubonic plague pandemic ended, but it took 400 years."
6027,Ok
6028,We gave some away since then but are still sitting on tens of millions for no reason.
6029,No.
6030,"There was a different vaccine that did not make it out of initial trials because it made people *test* positive for HIV, but did not give them HIV."
6031,It caused false positive HIV tests essentially.
6032,Development of this vaccine stopped early.
6033,I think it makes sense on both sides.
6034,The EU Is negotiating a deal for ASAP.
6035,"Therefore are focussing now on companies who have delivered on their promises, which so far is only biontech Pfizer (and hopefully CureVac) (Moderna is also under delivering but I don’t know the deal there)."
6036,On the other hand once the urgency is over it makes sense for the individual countries to negotiate different vaccines if they want to.
6037,"While I’m not against mRNA, I do hope they will keep more traditional vaccines on the market for people who are not so confident in new tech."
6038,The more the merrier.
6039,Also I’m interested in seeing progress on the regavac (I think that’s the name) based on the yellow fever vaccines and bring research in Leuven.
6040,"It apparently could be a game changer for the third world as it could be transported in a frigo box, and they expect a life time efficiency from what I understood."
6041,Oh and it would also work against the yellow fever so double win.
6042,the rarely seen jerk!
6043,My understanding is that they asked to be reimbursed as a way to get around contract law.
6044,I think there would be liability issues if they flat out gave the vaccines to those countries.
6045,"Not the person you are replying to, but I’m someone who teaches and wears a mask 40+ hours a week and I think adults who whine about masks are acting like toddlers."
6046,Don’t assume that everyone who wears one for a long time agrees with you.
6047,Oof.
6048,I hope you eventually convince him.

6051,TIL?
6052,So it has more to do with the health of the host than replicative drift?
6053,?
6054,"Yeah, the fact that it’s something only uneducated morons believe is very telling."
6055,You’re a prime example of the dunning kruger effect.
6056,Technically there's no guarantee of that
6057,"To be fair, India has stopped all all exports as well."
6058,People have their vax cards.
6059,"Carry it around, like your driver's license."
6060,"Show your card when entering gated, crowded, public spaces, like theaters, concerts, public transportation, ball games, etc."
6061,except for unattended entryways (e.g.
6062,subways).
6063,Otherwise wear a mask.
6064,"For air travel require either 2 shots + 2 weeks, or a recent test + a mask."
6065,"Sounds to me like those pandemics end too

Nah but jokes aside covid was never going to end the human species"
6066,Good news but they couldn't have picked a better image?
6067,Kinda cringey how she's not wearing her mask right.
6068,"Ah shit, here we go again"
6069,Indiana isn't too much higher at the moment.
6070,Thank goodness.
6071,My 17 year old son tested positive yesterday.
6072,Last week was his first full week of in person classes.
6073,His father and I are both fully vaccinated and crossing our fingers.
6074,So for reference I’m 33 years old and slightly overweight.
6075,"I had a constant fever of about 99-100, chills on and off, back pain for about 3 days."
6076,I lost my smell a few days in but luckily got it back when I recovered.
6077,"My cough was minor, it felt more like a scratchy throat, but my chest felt heavy like I had to get mucus up but to no avail."
6078,Also I was constantly tired 24/7 but I tried my best to get up and walk around a few times every day because I heard it’s good for the lungs.
6079,I recovered after about 10 days and got my wind back after a full 2 weeks.
6080,"I also went through an entire case of water, I think the constant fever makes you dehydrated."
6081,"It's 100% a marketing thing to say it's effective against a specific variant, which is a pity because the textile in itself looks interesting, no need to insult our intelligence."
6082,The EU delivered 100 million doses to the EU in Q1 and will deliver well over 400 million in Q2.
6083,That's over 100 million doses delivered to the EU in the first half year.
6084,"Considering the EU exports around 50%, they will actually deliver well over 1 billion doses during the first 6 months of 2021."
6085,"Deliveries are not production, so production will be even higher."
6086,How many is the US planning to produce during the first 6 months of this year excluding everything in 2020?
6087,Add to that 750 million deliveries to the EU on Q3 and over 600 million deliveries in Q4.
6088,That's around 1.35 billion deliveries to the EU in the second half of 2021.
6089,"Considering 50% is export, that is probably around 2.7 billion deliveries from the EU in the last 6 months of the year."
6090,Or almost 4 billion vaccine deliveries during all of 2021.
6091,"Most of which will be exported, as the EU only needs around 800-900 million doses at most (considering everyone wants a vaccine including minors)."
6092,Breton recently said for now he expects to produce around 3 billion doses in the EU in 2021.
6093,"So they are pushing vaccines out like it is the ""space race""."
6094,Maybe only China will be able to produce more or match these figures.
6095,"The big difference is that US supply is supplying only 330 million citizens, the EU supply is supplying 450 citizens + the billions of citizens outside the EU as we speak."
6096,...And?
6097,That doesn't mean it's not overkill.
6098,[deleted]
6099,That’s my point.
6100,"Japan isn’t getting the doses they ordered from Pfizer last year, they supposed to start getting more in the coming weeks."
6101,"South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand all are in similar situations."
6102,"Yes, this."
6103,And it’s harmless.
6104,It’s called “covid arm”.
6105,"""Stop trying to make others do the same"" they won't do this."
6106,They will push lockdowns until it gets so ridiculous they can't anymore .
6107,This history of so many people sacrificing nothing won’t exactly change will it.
6108,Man this whole reply hit different.
6109,It's crazy how life can change so goddamn fast.
6110,That’s fine you don’t have to get it but you’ll need to stay in quarantine.
6111,As giving it to others is not “my body my choice” qualifying
6112,"If you ever had or knew anyone who had an IV stuck in them, they use saline solution to flush the IV."
6113,Because there is no federal contract tracing program and the state ones were pretty limited.
6114,We don’t have anyone tracking this.
6115,"We’ve got a shit ton of legal weed here in Canada, and no vaccines."
6116,Let’s talk
6117,"Bye COVID, hello lung cancer!"
6118,"This study was run in September, before the winter surge where Florida cases and deaths peaked."
6119,[removed]
6120,That’s in absolute terms.
6121,Japan is the world’s 11th- most populous country so 39th in doses administered is terrible.
6122,My second pfizer shot last Sunday had me feeling like I had the full blown flu for 4 days.
6123,It was miserable.
6124,"Body aches, chills, fever, migraine, no appetite, thirsty as hell, everything hurt, exhausted...ugh."
6125,It was hell.
6126,I’d still do it all over again.
6127,:D A few days of misery is better than 2 weeks of sickness and potential long-term health effects.
6128,"Meanwhile, my friend got her second dose of pfizer a couple days after me and felt like a million bucks."
6129,|: Didn’t feel shitty in the least.
6130,So they are not legally handed out.
6131,They are illegally handed out in a way such that no one will be punished.
6132,[removed]
6133,Now this I'd get jabbed for.
6134,Yeah that works
6135,instead of having dumb gimmicks or moronic celebrities how about you just let ppl sue the vaccine makers if things go wrong?
6136,People swear up and down its safe but then won't drop their legal protection from lawsuits.....Why would I take a vaccine against a virus I already had if i have no recourse if i get a blood clot and die?
6137,"Our supplemental insurance covers prescription drugs, dentists, optometrists, physiotherapists, massage therapists, etc."
6138,"Basic care is covered by Medicare, our supplemental insurance covers extras."
6139,Our supplemental insurance is under 50$ a month for a family plan.
6140,Our medication might not be free but it is usually cheaper.
6141,"With insurance, I pay a 5$ dispensing fee for all prescription drugs."

6146,"Just ""Pennsylvania governor gets first dose of COVID-19 vaccine"" is sufficient enough."
6147,"I don't disagree, there are no easy answers."
6148,The influx of cash to Schools in the new infrastructure/stimulus dually does help because implementing safety measures is costly.
6149,"Unfortunately it is not continuous funding because what my county really needs is more teachers, counselors, etc."
6150,"If they could do a 3 year education bill to help lower class sizes, and increase educational staff thst would probably delay the retirement of many educators and lure more back so we can distance students better, and give more individualized attention to help kids catch back up."
6151,"More trailers around Schools would such, but if it lowers class sizes..it can help."

6153,I know you!
6154,You’re Ramadan Steve!
6155,"&gt;“With any vaccine, we expect such rare cases, but so far out of more than 84 million people who were fully vaccinated, we have only received reports of less than **6,000 breakthrough cases**,” Walensky told reporters at a press briefing."
6156,"**Breakthrough cases occur when someone contracts the virus more than 14 days after their second shot**, she said."
6157,"Quote from the article, emphasis mine."
6158,[removed]
6159,"Not sure what that has to do with insurance, or what evidence you have to suggest that that's likely."
6160,June 1
6161,you know you can get and transmit covid even after vaccination.....lol your likely the problem.
6162,"Lockdowns do work (see Victoria, Australia) but they're bloody hard to execute to completion (see Victoria, Australia)."
6163,The last pockets of disease (from which it could all spring back up again from) were incredibly difficult to completely eliminate and there was a lot of time at the end there for the last cases to finally completely disappear.
6164,Scale things up even further to probably several orders of magnitude like India and the factor of difficulty probably shoots up into the stratosphere and beyond.
6165,"As someone who lives in Brazil, unfortunately I'd say the chances of the AZ and/or J&amp;J vaccines even getting here are very slim."
6166,Our president (Jair Bolsonaro a.k.a.
6167,"""Tropical Donald Trump"") was well, not very in favor of covid vaccination and has refused the reception of quite a large amount of vaccines in the past, only after actual popular press did he allow for all vaccines to be used, instead of keeping a ""stock"" (sorry if this isn't very clear, I'm just a teenager so I'm not exactly keeping up with the news to explain this very further, but basically he intended for a ""stock keeping"", to have extra vaccines in case it's ""essential"" or an ""emergency"", even though it is a calamity in Brazil anyways) I hope I'm super wrong here, but I don't think it's very probable that he would even allow vaccines with proved counter-effects, even if they would massively reduce the amount of cases."
6168,It really seems like a lot of people never seriously considered the prospect of dying or death before the pandemic.
6169,"Or they were just posturing, but some of it was probably real."
6170,If you read past the headline you would see the relative number.

6176,Zero.
6177,Period.
6178,We shouldn't go back to life until deaths drop to zero.
6179,"My ""freedumbs"" are not worth someone dying over."
6180,Even if it's one Fucking person.
6181,My post is a generally true statement for fuck all USA.
6182,I thought that was obvious
6183,That's what this article says...
6184,These are confirmed cases.
6185,The articles I posted were peer reviewed.
6186,I don’t know what you mean by control groups where they are analyzing different mask mandates.
6187,"If you don’t want to believe masks work, go ahead."
6188,I know they do and I’m not going to dig up studies to your demand.
6189,It's not like it is *rear-entry* anxiety.
6190,"Good god, y'all - grow a layer."
6191,I got mine at 8am yesterday and didn’t feel anything until around 11pm.
6192,"Couldn’t sleep at all and felt very sore achy all night, but I feel fine now besides the tiredness."

6197,The day after my second Moderna shot I felt like I dropped acid and got run over by a herd of moose.
6198,"Brain fog, aches, headache, early and severe cramps and period, extreme lethargy."
6199,It lasted about a day and a half.
6200,"It sucked, but I’ve felt worse."
6201,"Would do it again twice if I had to for those sweet, sweet antibodies."
6202,Yep.
6203,"And I think this idea that there are two halves of society and I belong to one half, and the other half “caused” the pandemic is also incredibly toxic and dangerous."
6204,everyone has a price.
6205,"and for some, its simply a donut"
6206,Stupid science-deniers.
6207,"The article from the NY Post said ""herpes zoster""."
6208,It is more commonly known as shingles which is when chicken pox reactivates on your body when you are older.
6209,About 30 percent of people will get shingles in their lifetime so I am not sure you could even link the vaccine to it.
6210,"Similar, got rear ended on the high way when I came up on stopped traffic and someone hit me from behind at full speed."
6211,(Hit me so hard it broke my front seats!
6212,"Seats snapped backwards and we wound up in a laying down position)

For a long time any time I had to suddenly stop on the highway I couldn't help but brace myself for getting smashed from behind."
6213,Problem is what happens if someone does get Covid then gets it again it could potentially kill them due to the damage prior
6214,Yea I'm the exact same as you.
6215,"I told someone in March of last year how bad my anxiety was about what was about to happen in the upcoming year, they were like, ""It'll be ok. Just don't go out and be cautious."""
6216,"I was like, ""Yea, I'm not anxious about getting Covid."""
6217,I don't think they quite understood.
6218,No vaccine has claimed a 100% efficacy at preventing infection.
6219,Only 6000 cases in 84 million vaccinated people is a phenomenally good result.
6220,"They learned from their mistake.. also, bear in mind we started the School year virtual, then transitioned to hybrid in early October, so they were definitely trying to avoid shutting down again so quick."
6221,[removed]
6222,Ridiculous amounts of  plastic and chemical pollution are two reasons.
6223,its a big picture.
6224,"Pandemic to date, they have fared better than average statistically in the US, despite not closing their economy like most states."
6225,That is a success buddy.
6226,"They bought, they expect delivery."
6227,Where do you see any begging in this.
6228,It is like this: you buy something from someone and expect to receive it tomorrow.
6229,"But you will not receive it, the person you were buying it from decided to keep it for themselves and decides to give you the things later than agreed upon."
6230,Theft basically.
6231,The US is the buyers the EU is the buyer.
6232,"There is a bit of nuance here, as it is the US government deciding to steal bought supplies, and not the suppliers directly."
6233,"And something else, this implies that the EU is not capable of producing these things themselves."
6234,This is probably not true.
6235,There is a lot of vaccine and critical supply production in the EU.
6236,"It is probably just that CureVac decided to buy from the US, as it made more sense business wise (e.g."
6237,cheaper).
6238,"Now they are not getting it, so it must be sourced from the EU instead."
6239,This also implies the US does not need any supplies from China/Europe.
6240,"We do not know if this is not the case, as Europe and China just let private companies produce and deliver to whoever bought from them, instead of taking over production as c mmu nists."
6241,"So US companies do not have to complain about supply from Europe and China, because they are just getting it."
6242,"Everyone is preferably dependent on each other, it makes things cheaper."
6243,But this can only happen with trust.
6244,This is a two way street.
6245,"The US has broken the trust and made it a one way street (critical supplies in, nothing out)."
6246,Now everyone knows never ever to get anything important/critical from the US as they cannot be trusted.
6247,This is bad for all.
6248,We are already seeing this in the EU.
6249,"Previously they did not mind getting critical supplies from the US in the vaccine contracts they made, as they trusted the US even though there is domestic production."
6250,"The trust is now completely gone, and thus the EU wants all critical materials for vaccine production to be sourced from within the EU with all future contracts."
6251,"Some of this you can already see with Janssen, which was supposed to be filled and finished in the US."
6252,This has now been moved to the EU.
6253,And even more so in the new BioNTech contract for 1.8 billion doses all critical supplies must be sourced from within the EU now.
6254,Previously the first step for the BioNTech vaccine happened in the US (DNA plasmid production) while it could be done in the EU as well.
6255,The EU learned their lesson and will do everything in the EU in all their future contracts.
6256,uh huh enjoy dying of covid in your third world country you fucking leaf.
6257,US leads the world in medical innovation and we could also annex your country in 30 minutes lmfao
6258,"Ok, but you just matched Canada’s entire popultion in those 4 spots."
6259,"Actually, by naming one of those spots."
6260,Pretty much this indeed due to lockdowns the UK reported no flu season
6261,Thank you for this information.
6262,Sure.
6263,It would also be safer if everyone drove 30 mph at all times.
6264,Sometimes the added safety isn't worth the inconvenience.
6265,So what was your point then?
6266,The source admits it could be an underestimate because of that.
6267,"As they long they stay home, and stop trying to make others do the same, I couldn't give less of a fuck."
6268,"Honestly, I prefer it."

6369,I think LA County health has stated that there are some crowded urban neighborhoods where it's estimated that half the residents have been infected.
6370,Add in the protection from vaccines and it's easy to see how huge swaths of California are reaching herd immunity so quickly.
6371,It's just sad that it had to come at the expense of so many people's health and lives.
6372,Likely a vast overestimation of immunity from the first wave due to selection bias in seroprevalence estimates.

Comments
Two of the three variants in the triple mutation have been seen to have immune escape responses, meaning they are more resistant to antibodies."
6375,Not much more is known yet on the effectiveness of vaccines.
6376,Scientists believe the new variant has some ability to escape the body's naturally acquired immunity to Covid.
6377,Fuck
6378,"yeah it’s only just now started to warm up in the pnw the last week or so, i think we’ll start to see a case reduction reflecting that and the surge in vaccinations over the next week or two"
6379,"Not to sound like a jerk, but I think if we're measuring who owes who for what, the US has a vast amount of credit over South Korea generally..."
6380,That's pretty pessimistic.
6381,The pandemic has advanced infectious disease research in a way that's more like 2 decades of advancement in pre-pandemic research in a year.
6382,Its looking pretty certain that virtually any infectious disease that the immune system is capable of mounting an effective response against we can make an even more effective vaccine against than immunity induced by natural infection.
6383,"Yes, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria will still remain a challenge but even these long time challenges will see some benefit from scientific advances being made now."
6384,Yes there really is a silver lining.
6385,Humans are capable of great things when our collective will is in the right place.
6386,Agreed.
6387,I think small incentives like $50 gift cards would really encourage staff in the meantime as well.
6388,It's crazy to me at our hospital how many turned down the vaccine and they've made no attempt to reward/ encourage people to change their mind.
6389,Probably won't taste like much either
6390,Yep that's definitely what I meant.
6391,Idk about what all the states were at but dfw had a 34% positivity rate in January and the icus were full.

6405,There will probably be some spread but my guess is a majority of folks who are going to these events already got covid
6406,You're right the stock going bad was just an analyst opinion.
6407,Just checked a bottle and it says June.
6408,"That said, it is true a US government official said they're never going to use them anyway so the point still stands."
6409,Would it really have been a bad move to let Mexico have some doses that you weren't going to use anyways?
6410,I honestly don't see why you're arguing so hard against helping a poor country without asking for something in return....
6411,Yeah I was referring to the unique individual %
6412,Criminally negligent to turn down a vaccine when you have already ordered more than you'd need?
6413,And when the vaccines you are turning down are the ones with the most serious side effects?
6414,And when the deliveries of these specific vaccines are completely unreliable in comparison to the other options?
6415,"My understanding is that some boosters are needed not for mutations alone, but because efficacy decays over time"
6416,what will happen if all the family dies?
6417,or the living cant pay the cremation of so many members?
6418,"I know its hard, but it could get to a point where religion wont matter saddly."
6419,Are you even trying to keep up?
6420,It's **WORSE** than the others.
6421,Much worse.
6422,"It's not about ""saving lifes"", that's not the goal of a vaccine!"
6423,The goal is to frequent freaking symptoms.
6424,I hate repeating myself!
6425,Doesn't sound like a problem once everyone has access to the vaccine.
6426,Of course businesses will have their own rules to abide by.
6427,Even as a booster it's kinda pointless now.
6428,"Pfizer / BioNTech will be able to deliver at scale, Valneva hasn't even really gotten out of the gate."
6429,Ok. That is quite interesting.
6430,Why would someone steal a quote like that from this thread?
6431,"Oh well, the mysteries of Reddit."
6432,Thanks for pointing it out.
6433,"How is this the same thing as ""not the most accurate terminology?"""
6434,In July the US secured orders for Pfizer.
6435,In September the EU was still conducting “exploratory discussions” on preordering Pfizer.
6436,You’re not so stupid you don’t understand why the US is front of the line for Pfizer in front of the EU.
6437,At this point you’re willfully lying.
6438,"I hope that once the vaccines get full FDA approval (hopefully sometime this summer), nursing homes can mandate vaccination for employees."
6439,"Seriously lol a lot of the sensitive redditors like the dude you’re responding to just parrot some shit out to feel good about themselves but don’t actually live in any of these areas where these demographics got hit hard like in that part of Queens

Dudes all over canadacornavirus sub but talking out of his ass about nyc lmao"
6440,2 of my co-workers that drive every day are eligible but won't get the Az vaccine due to the 10 out of a million chance of getting a treatable blood clot.
6441,I am a year to young to get it.
6442,Ok then USA is only country blocking exports while the UK is secretly letting out less than a million.
6443,yeah this.
6444,i feel like the only thing J&amp;J pause slows down is those who were hesitant to get a vaccine already.
6445,that’s the real shame here and we need to be ramping up the effort on those folks as the supply of enthusiastic vaccine takers is running out in a couple weeks
6446,"We should still use the doses we have for now, but there's no point in getting more."
6447,Its not really a great position when we have turned the rest of the world into a petri dish for evolving a variant of the virus with breakthrough potential.
6448,If the US was smart they would not only distribute the extra vaccines but would have forced pharma companies to share intellectual property with developing countries.
6449,We could be back to normal by now if they had done the latter.
6450,[removed]
6451,It would take a few thousand people to agree to be studied.
6452,"You bring them into a lab, expose them to COVID and see what happens."
6453,"The problem is nobody knows how to expose someone to COVID, so a few hundred of that group had the placebo vaccine: 1-2 die, and 10-20 have significant long term effects (we would learn a lot about what ""long covid"" is from this)."
6454,As such nobody will actually run the study and you will be left forever wondering.
6455,Doesn't matter.
6456,"Don't say the EU didn't put money into the problem, they did and you guys are benefitting/paying for it from it as well."
6457,Outdoors.
6458,We are looking for a PCR test but it's not available everywhere.
6459,So it's more of a issue of where to get tested
6460,Death and illness will continue until the end of time.
6461,That's a terrifyingly horrific thought.
6462,I am watching one of my co-workers struggle to breath months after she recovered from COVID.
6463,She takes hours off of her inhaler like it's puff puff pass
6464,"Why is there a ""Book a room"" on the virovax website?"
6465,India also doesn't have half of its population with at least one vaccine.
6466,So low cases are bad?
6467,"Or maybe, juuust maybe.... vaccines work?"

6470,"I am glad i got astra and it turned my 
B117 corona infection in just a runny nose but they will drop astra and jannsen"
6471,315k cases there today.. yeah they're so fucked.
6472,"The weather's supposed to get nice again next week, so hopefully people being outdoors more will help."
6473,Currently looks like they will deliver a bit over 10 mil this month.
6474,So its not completly unreasonable that they will deliver 30 mil in Q2.
6475,But you should always keep in mind that they promised 60 mil per month...
6476,Seems it's time to lift restrictions.
6477,If you live your life hiding from everything you've already died
6478,"There's also the most important factor of them all, *luck*."
6479,"Seriously, the ""herd immunity"" argument was being tossed around in September 2020 when people were arguing states like Arizona just had too much natural immunity for another wave."
6480,"I bet if we didn't have vaccines, Florida would be in the throes of another terrible wave (it's had cases increase *despite* vaccinations!)."
6481,"With a disease that has a large k value, there's just a lot of randomness on where spikes happen."
6482,"In the case of MI, it just got unlucky that despite the vaccines, enough community spread happened that even with 30-50% of the population immune via vaccine or natural immunity (back in March), there were enough active hosts for COVID to spread."
6483,"It could've happened anywhere, MI just had bad luck."
6484,My mans 💙
6485,Only if you intend to use that pharmacy in the future.
6486,In how far?
6487,"NRW vaccinated 94% of its received AZ vaccines, Bavaria some 70%."
6488,The PEI recommendation still stands that under 60 years old shouldn't be vaccinated with AZ.
6489,So it's an uneccessary public health risk to give it to younger people.
6490,Other countries with lower infection rates have even an outright ban like Denmark and Norway.
6491,Maybe.
6492,The virus doesn't seem unstable enough to need annual boosters like flu viruses do.
6493,It's seeing a lot of mutations because of how rapidly it has been spreading amongst a sars2 naive population.
6494,"I see it being necessary for 1-3 variant boosters but with all of the research dumped into research and infrastructure made to produce vaccines we will eventually reach enough of the population with vaccines and boosters coupled with the people who never will get the vaccine but infected naturally we might actually be able to catch up with this one, unlike influenza."
6495,Influenza is unique in how rapid its antigenic drift is.
6496,"""Mutant"" is a loaded word that incites fear, especially in the context of viruses."
6497,"The average person doesn't have a background in microbial evolution like you do, so using this terminology is neither helpful nor explanatory to them."
6498,It probably relates to how much time is spent indoors.
6499,Last year we saw the Northern states hit the hardest during the time when people migrate indoors because it's cold.
6500,While in the Southern states we didnt see much spread because people were outdoors.
6501,Once summer arrived we saw what was expected.
6502,Southern states saw an increase in cases as people migrated indoors because of the heat.
6503,Northern states saw a drop as people could enjoy the weather outside.
6504,If being alive means avoiding humans and life indefinitely I don't want it.
6505,But you do you.
6506,"Its probably a mix of factors, best guesses:

* LA got hit hard earlier this year, so already has some natural immunity."
6507,"* Bay area has been relatively OK most of the time
* Last I checked Oregon was behind on vaccination (though Washington was ahead)
* Weather:  They haven't found what the casual relationship is like they have for the flu, but there is almost certainly some element that weather plays."
6508,The same thing happened last year where the trends seemed to be regionalized but correlated with weather.
6509,Perhaps its just more people are spending time indoors or perhaps there is a more direct relationship.
6510,If they deliver 30 million in Q2 I'd be shocked.

6583,"I wonder when Florida deaths will begin to decrease, feels like they have been stagnant for about a month"
6584,Of course this is looking at it from a strictly individual level.
6585,The benefits of vaccination go far beyond just that from protection of the individual.
6586,"Of course I agree that the benefits need to outweigh the risk, I'm just suggesting that in many cases people are hearing about the risks and far overweighting their risk from this ultra rare side effect compared to what they usually would, they aren't calculating the risk benefit calculation correctly."
6587,"Many people wouldn't even think twice about the risk of dying of a bloodclot whilst taking birth control (because it's tiny) yet because it's in the media they are very concerned about the ultra rare risk of dying from a blood clot due to AZ despite the risk being even smaller, it's about putting numbers into context."

6591,Yea for countries like Canada with limited supply a first dose strategy makes the most sense.
6592,I don’t think it’s really applicable for the U.S because there isn’t any significant supply shortages.
6593,"When vaccine development first started under project ""Warp Speed"" I felt the same way about waiting until it was in the wild for a pretty good long time."
6594,"As I've kept up with vaccine news and trying to understand every aspect of what has been going on with the vaccines, I have become much more comfortable with it."
6595,Especially the mRNA technology.
6596,I'm scheduled for my 2nd Moderna jab tomorrow.
6597,Production of vaccine isn't linear - once the producers get more experienced with the yields and materials it will get quicker - as shown in the UK's supply
6598,20 million?
6599,How come the other comment says it’s 4.2 million?
6600,Yes you are right.
6601,But in India situation is dire and outside my family on forums and groups there are countless 50+ vaccinated people who are getting severe disease.
6602,This triple mutation is a variant of interest now.
6603,I sincerely hope UK completes the genomic study and vaccine is tweaked.
6604,"As for the trials, they were done some time back when this mutant was not there."
6605,Israel and UK (shockingly not India) are at the forefront of investigating this strain.
6606,The ability of this virus to mutate so much is what scares me.
6607,Vaccines will need constant tweaking if this continues
6608,Ok im from india and i have a question.
6609,My father is 63 and is probably in better physical condition than most fit 40 year old men.
6610,My mom is fairly lethargic at 55.
6611,"They both got Astrazeneca vaccine 15 days back [1st shot]

dad developed a fever on saturday morning/friday late night."
6612,it never went beyond 99 and it actually subsided today.
6613,"No change in taste/smell, no breathing issues."
6614,But he is having wet/productive cough.
6615,and is feeling weak after 4 days.
6616,And my mom started having slight fever with no other issues.
6617,"Both have SpO2 of around 95-98 [changes at various times of the day]

 I live with them and i got nothing."
6618,Im wondering if this is covid or just regular flu.
6619,It's literally an increase of 60 people in a state with a population of 4.9m
6620,For opinions and seemingly for a mental health support system.
6621,There are actual real numbers that can be obtained for this type of question.
6622,Just seems to me that if you want a real answer that these random people on Reddit ain’t the way 🤷🏻‍♂️
6623,"Yeah, that should be alright."
6624,my guess is walmart does it first.
6625,What about Sinopharm?
6626,"Yes, obviously?"
6627,"They lag by far, far too much though."
6628,"It took the CDC much, much longer, like nine months longer, than the medical community to acknowledge that surface spread is not a significant source of transmission, for example."
6629,"Not that that’s directly a policy decision, but the official recommendation of cleaning surfaces definitely had an effect on covid mitigation strategies and how we spend our resources (lots of time and money wasted on “deep cleans”, for example)

If we are going to bluster about how well we’re following the science then I think we should try to actually follow the science as closely as possible"
6630,Which is in full accordance with CDC guidance.

6634,"Right, but that’s a very small part of the millions of years of history that life existed on the planet."
6635,It’s just a foolish point to make.
6636,This could easily become something that doesn’t go away if we don’t make it go away.
6637,Wishing it away with “pandemics end” won’t work.
6638,I think they were referring to immediate hospitalization from Covid symptoms vs hospitalization from the effects that Covid had on the body.
6639,"As in, not hospitalized for ventilation or the typical Covid issues, but months later with stiffening of the heart which lead to heart disease that required hospitalization or kidney failure that led to hospitalization, etc."
6640,My sister is a nurse in a Trauma 1 hospital and she is seeing a lot of people that had Covid months ago but now have permanent heart or lung or kidney damage from Covid and are in the hospital not for Covid (and not Covid positive) but from the damage Covid did to their organs.
6641,So I wonder how the vaccine works at keeping Covid from majorly affecting the organs long term
6642,Accodring to the state of Florida all persons above the age of 18 are elligble to recive the vaccine as of the 5th of April.
6643,"While supplies are limited, they are not limited enough to warrent not giving people full benefits."
6644,"If we were not moving at a break neck speed i might agree with partial coverage, but were just running into the problem of people not wanting it."
6645,Not a Florida problem but a problem non the less.
6646,I think it's because they're contradicting themselves.
6647,Sure the vaccine won't confer 100% protection and that's a risk when covid cases are exploding around you.
6648,"However it is perfectly suitable for a situation where a large portion of the population is vaccinated, which is the end goal anyway."
6649,But then where will the clicks go?
6650,There was an article from the UK today saying that the variant that's being blamed for this debacle has been around for quite some time and has been seen in other countries as early as last October.
6651,This is mostly just an excuse by the government so no one blames their lack of effective policy for the outbreak.
6652,"The restrictions not just protect \*those\* morons, but other people for whom vaccine didn't take (its 95% effective, not 100%), kids who can't yet take it etc

Not sure which restrictions would still make sense at which vaccination or risk levels, but I don't think 'no restrictions' is the right answer right now."
6653,"Cases dropping so he removed the one thing that has helped them drop, seriously bad republican educated politician."
6654,"Damn it is not even a hard thing to do, but they will cry when they are forced into lockfown again and are losing thousands of lives every week"
6655,"Well humans have faced plenty of pandemics in our 200,000 years."
6656,"So far, they all ended."
6657,I've had pretty strong side effects as well.
6658,My thought was better 1 day with guaranteed recovery than 14 days with possible effects rest of the life.
6659,Its already largely happened in my area and cases just keep dropping here.
6660,Third post I’ve seen on this study this week.
6661,The doomsday variant narrative is getting old.
6662,The virus doesn’t seem to be learning new tricks just the same markers.

6684,Good news.
6685,80k on friday was concerning so was surprised to see cases fall in the days after.
6686,But I wonder if this time we can hold it below 50k a day and hopefully make progress to go lower than that.

6704,They won't be giving people a choice as to what vaccine they'll get.
6705,If you are claiming they will could you please provide your source.
6706,This was written in January.
6707,We know more about how the vaccines work at preventing infection now than we did then.
6708,"This, from the article, is now the more likely scenario:

&gt; If the vaccines prevent people from transmitting the virus, “then it becomes a lot more like the measles scenario, where you vaccinate everybody, including kids, and you really don’t see the virus infecting people anymore,” Dr. Crotty said."
6709,that there are only 59 cases of 20 million vaccinations
6710,"https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1005

This begs to differ."
6711,"Sure, not peer-reviewed yet but University of Oxford."
6712,Same .
6713,All this fear mongering.
6714,"I mean I get they have to report it , but the news agencies see fear they can sell and run with it"
6715,The 4% was of all COVID cases from when the vaccine clinics began.
6716,It’s actually 16% of all cases if you look at the time period starting 2 weeks after the second vaccine clinics began (which is when you could start seeing breakthroughs as people have to be 2 weeks out from their second dose of the two-dose series).
6717,"The 16% (or 4%) doesn’t correspond 1:1 to vaccine efficacy, like you couldn’t say the vaccine is 84% (or 96%) effective just based on that data alone."
6718,However if you look at the epi curve in the report you can see how cases declined tremendously after vaccinations began in nursing homes which is great!
6719,Really?
6720,Name one.
6721,The solution is to pay people to get vaccinated.
6722,"There are essentially three groups of vaccine holdouts - those who are completely against getting vaccinated due to brainwashing/propaganda, people who are on the fence/sort of against getting vaccinated due to brainwashing/propaganda, and those who are merely indifferent or lazy."
6723,"A $500 check will incentivize a majority of the third group, and a good chunk of the 2nd group."
6724,"Biden's announcement to compensate businesses for PTO is an indirect example of this - it will encourage businesses to give people time off to get vaccinated, so many indifferent people will do it for the extra vacation days."

Then there's maybe 20% who are vaccine hesitant, but more like ""I'll wait and see..""

6869,Yes i know that biontech is German.
6870,Leadership from government is programs like warp speed or what China is doing.
6871,From what I have read EU didn't mobilize anything and just let private companies do it's thing.
6872,Do you have anything about an EU warp speed program?
6873,Chinas government did some communist magic and retooled lots of factories to produce medical stuff.
6874,EU was just debating each other and there where no leadership from the government.
6875,I live in EU and experienced confusion and bureaucracy firsthand.
6876,I can't think of anything specific EU politician have done to fix production issues.

6893,The global supply chain is disrupted because even some tiny components like plastic tubes can't be exported from the US.

6906,"Again, once COVID mortality reaches flulike rates, I don’t see restrictions continuing."
6907,"I think on a micro scale they have a better chance of working and Victoria, Australia is a good example but on a macro scale isn't doable, at least not for a sustainable future."
6908,Especially if your goal is zero covid.
6909,Yes.
6910,The decrease is maybe 70-80% due to J&amp;J but we have peaked for sure.
6911,But we are still at a very high rate
6912,They have to be injected at room temperature and they can stay at that temp for a few hours before injection.
6913,Wouldnt the operating permits for that be insanely expensive?

6930,Oh.
6931,Unfortunately all 14 lab tests of Sputnik in Slovakia were good.
6932,"After detail questioning pharma regulator what does it mean they are not same, and long hesitancy and avoiding answer they confirmed that only difference was in packaging - 2doses in Slovakia and 5 doses vial in Lancet."
6933,"Technically and strictly formally they were true, but there is a political background why regulator issued more political than science statement."
6934,Has the US hit its peak already?
6935,Seems like the decrease cant be explained just by the lack of J&amp;J shots

7030,Why does everybody think that the health authorities in many European countries are not doing their job properly?
7031,Confronted with the unfortunate situation that the risk of death from the AstraZeneca vaccin and the risk of death from Covid are inversely proportional in different age groups it makes sense that the European countries have now done a 180 degree turn and are not using it for younger people (whereas they started out not using it for older people).

7135,"Still, this kind of messaging does annoy me a little because it might suggest that vaccines provide 100% protection for individuals."
7136,"Vaccines, like pandemics, don't work in absolutes and they don't work at the individual level."
7137,"It's important to keep that actual science in mind, and I think they could communicate it in ways that still encourage people to get vaccinated."
7138,Have you made sure they're real?
7139,So what’s the point of the other dose?
7140,I’m going to have to disagree with you.
7141,"She is a nurse practitioner, it’s ***literally*** in the name of the title."
7142,"They practice nursing theory model of *healthcare*, not the medical model taught in MD/DO schools."
7143,They are nurses and should be proud to be nurses that are an integral part of the healthcare team.
7144,When did being a nurse become less of a thing?
7145,Being a nurse is a grueling profession and I know a lot of amazing nurses that have become nurse practitioners who don’t pretend to be doctors despite their doctorate.
7146,Nurse Practitioners **ARE** nurses.
7147,There isn’t a different profession they fall into.
7148,They are at the “top of the nursing food chain” but they are still nurses.
7149,Your logic would extend to not calling a gastroenterologist a doctor.
7150,"They are a doctor, the class of profession and a gastroenterologist the scope of their professional identity."
7151,Still a doctor and calling them a gastroenterologist or a doctor are synonymous.
7152,i don’t think so.
7153,"there’s huge amounts of people who don’t even need to go to college but they get lied to through media/teachers that they need to go, and then they all get loans 


the biggest problem in the US is that most people don’t make enough to afford college, but they make too much for government assistance, so it’s all loans if you wanna go."

7155,"0% chance of dying, 0% chance of hospitalization after 14 days, .004% chance of hospitalization within 14 days: https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-deaths-after-first-vaccine-dose-doesn-t-show-lack-of-effectiveness-province-1.5387416

Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J say its 100% effective at preventing severe disease or death."
7156,Yes but relative to NYC not as badly.
7157,There are other factors at play for sure.
7158,I tend to think that estimate is high It was based on some seroprevalence data.
7159,Keep in mind many people can be sick for literally one to three days though.
7160,The best estimates were from covid-19 projections which had I think around 35% for Los Angeles county and 12% for San Francisco county.
7161,"Right, that is exactly why the doctor’s office is an inappropriate venue to focus on for a new vaccination campaign"
7162,There have never been a documented super-spreading event where people are all masked and distanced.
7163,"It's not impossible that some transmission can happen here and there, but it's very unlikely."
7164,The vaccine manufacturers need 6 months of data to apply for full approval.
7165,"Moderna and Pfizer both announced they had 6 months of data a couple weeks ago, and apparently they intend to apply soon."
7166,Once they apply the FDA generally has 6 months to make a final decision.
7167,"I watched an interview with Peter Marks from the FDA the other day and while he was hesitant to give an exact date, he said they would do their best to get the approval done as quickly as possible."
7168,"Here’s the interview: https://youtu.be/oVz2Iu1Csyk

He talks about it in the Q&amp;A part at the end."
7169,"Also, the whole talk was great anyway, so I recommend watching it if you’re interested."
7170,"I'm no expert, but the fact that we have hundred of millions participating in a global trial, has to make the approval process faster than normal."
7171,We're going to know fairly quickly exactly how safe and effective the vaccine is.
7172,"If it helps, most people I know had very minor symptoms."
7173,"I got Moderna myself and only had maybe a low grade fever that evening and a little tired the next day, still worked and functioned fine."

7184,People like yourself continue to pass around death rates taken from before this syndrome was understood to distort the assessment of the risks involved in taking the vaccine.
7185,Storm in a teacup.
7186,&gt;You’d think that you’d offended someone’s mother when you point out how much of a disaster the Oxford vaccine is to a British person.
7187,"The UK is currently close to herd immunity, saving many thousands of lives, thanks in large part to the AZ vaccine."
7188,The desperation with which some people are trying to rubbish this and occasionally J&amp;J's vaccine suggests they're using it as consolation for the iniquity of their own vaccine programs.
7189,It's pretty transparent projection.
7190,&gt;Why else would most of the developed world restrict this vaccine with age groups?
7191,"If this vaccine were even fractionally as dangerous as people like yourself make out, the world would have stopped producing these vaccines and all remaining doses sent to the incinerator."
7192,These restrictions are political.

7502,That’s not an accurate conclusion.
7503,Remember the whole land doesn’t vote thing?
7504,Same thing here.
7505,Land doesn’t get coronavirus.
7506,"Some places just don’t need more doses, so it’s good they are not being selfish and hogging doses"
7507,"I am exasperated, but only with my Canadian government for allowing us to lose the sovereignty to build vaccines and not act fast enough to get it back."
7508,The US and anybody else owes us nothing.
7509,We are a high tech country that allowed ourselves to get into this predicament.
7510,Is there a certain time you should stop smoking before getting the vaccine?
7511,It's fine.
7512,I'm sure it's fine.
7513,That's a great approach.
7514,20% hike.
7515,Everything is just fine.

7520,"just follow the CDC guidelines: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

I don't get why some average joe somewhere keep pretending they have more data, a PhD, a deep understanding of immunology than the scientists and doctors who work at the CDC and NIAID."
7521,"Until they have more data to update their recommendations, why risk your own health and family's health."
7522,[deleted]
7523,Now we are getting a long way from an ELI5.
7524,"Viruses store their genetic information in different ways, and actually we classify them based on what their genomes look like: it's called the [Baltimare classification scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_classification), and there are 7 different groups."
7525,"The details are always complicated, but yes, one of these groups stores its genomic information as something that is pretty much a mRNA."
7526,'mRNA' is a very specific way of storing genetic information.
7527,In our (human) cells is is used only temporarily to carry the genetic information from our genome (DNA) to the parts of the cell that produce the proteins.
7528,"It carries a 'message', hence 'messenger RNA' or short 'mRNA'."
7529,"Some viruses contain DNA (that would be group I), and when they get into a cell it behaves like our genome - the DNA is read, mRNA is produced and sent off to carry the information about which protein to make."
7530,"Other viruses bypass that step, and already contain genetic information looks pretty much like mRNA."
7531,That would be the 'Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses' from the link above.
7532,"Funnily enough, this includes the coronaviruses."
7533,"And yes, once the cell was hijacked and made more viruses, they leave the cell and spread around."
7534,"One last addition: the vaccine mRNA only contains a small part of the coronavirus genome (the information on how to make the spike protein), and not the whole thing."
7535,So it's absolutely impossible for the mRNA vaccination to lead to virus production.
7536,Not even with Jeff Goldblum's level of optimism/pessimism ('life finds a way').
7537,cases.
7538,Were testing like crazy and florida isn't.
7539,Deaths and hospitalizations matter.
7540,Were pretty much the same per capita as florida.
7541,If lockdowns worked why was California the worst in the country when we were extremely locked down for over a month?
7542,When you couldn't eat outside LA was the worst in the country.
7543,Something like 1 out of 3 people in LA got covid.
7544,Wasn't till medical staff and elderly were vaccinated we dropped majorily after being the worst in the country.
7545,"Guess we will disagree, but sure looks like vaccinations and infections of a huge portion of CA is what drove cases down."
7546,"""Stopping"" the virus is slowing it down."
7547,"Slow it down until R0 &lt; 1, then wait for case numbers to drop."

7558,No joke it would probably work better than anything else for half the state.
7559,Yes.
7560,It lasted about 2 days for me.
7561,"The reasons I favor a date is because : 

1."
7562,"It is definite and not dependent on the general public


2."
7563,Let's people know that the clock is ticking on getting a vaccine.
7564,Might motivate them to get it sooner.
7565,So why are we still wearing masks?
7566,It obviously causes a ton of unrest between the public.
7567,Canada should become a US state and then it can get our extra doses ;)
7568,"Also, research shows that getting vaccinated after having had covid gives you extremely high levels of immunity."
7569,"I dunno, when I was living on disability, MediCal was realy damn good"
7570,Many or most of the world's industrialized countries predictably added the US to their 'do not travel' advisories many months ago.
7571,Not a date.
7572,A vaccination level.
7573,"""Everybody else is protected, if you get sick and are unvaccinated after this point then that's your own damn fault"""
7574,It isn't necessarily about politics in every case.
7575,A lot of people I've spoken to are genuinely afraid of the vaccine because of the media's coverage of the horror stories being circulated about them.
7576,"Blood clots, anaphylaxis, swelling in the arm, and flu symptoms."
7577,There just isn't enough information available about the vaccines yet to alleviate those fears completely.
7578,A lot of people seem to have this irrational fear that the government is actually trying to kill more people to thin the population.
7579,"Despite my attempts to point out how idiotic that sounds, they hold firmly to the belief that our government is lying about everything and should not be trusted."
7580,"Despite the evidence from previous vaccines and how well those have worked to eliminate deadly viruses and diseases, people still simply just do not trust that vaccines work."
7581,I get my second shot tomorrow and I'm nervous as hell.
7582,I've read the second shot is worse.
7583,First shot felt like the after effects of a wasp sting for 4 days.
7584,"My mom was fine,  however my dad had flu like symptoms."
7585,Just want to get this over with.
7586,So all the time?
7587,"It does not, it's not minimizing those efforts, it's a genetic study, this is not a one or the other thing..."
7588,You have to control for personal risk I think.
7589,"If you divide proactiveness to get vaccine by danger to self, it might even come out in their favor."
7590,"Honestly, they just need to pick a date for restrictions to drop."
7591,"If you got the vaccine, good."
7592,"If you didn't want it, good luck."
7593,Soylent.
7594,Sounds about right lol
7595,"most of them are, except the pride of america"
7596,Good point.
7597,I think if you drill down into the provincial stats you can toggle through some different reports but it’s not all of Canada.
7598,The covid data is collected provincially  and submitted federally and published as canned / preset public reports or ‘quick stats’.
7599,Decision makers most definitely get a much more in depth group of reports based off the larger data sets and presented to them by experienced data analysts.
7600,If a regular person wanted to do their own analysis I believe they can can submit a data request -  but it usually isn’t instant - there are still actual humans that process requests and there is a strict process to ensure that the data is accurate and de identified etc.
7601,It’s a balance of transparency and privacy.
7602,Giving enough info and not so much people drown in it.
7603,I know.
7604,Pfizer refused to do local trials when they approached Indian gov.
7605,"As someone who not only followed the rules, but also struggled for over a year to find a job, I resent those who worked from home, then partied in large groups to reward themselves and their mental health because ""they don't have major exposure other than grocery stores and visiting one of their 10 bubble households""."
7606,"Who moved into their family homes where they had essentially their own private wing, putting all their rent money to the bank, while I stressed about my dwindling checking and savings accounts, worried it would run out before I was hired or they extended benefits."
7607,"I was stressed living with my grandmother, doing the grocery shopping for her, taking her to appointments, terrified about bringing Covid home from my occasional babysitting gig I had picked up to make ends meet, to the point of wearing a mask anywhere in my house except my own bedroom and for the ten minute showers I took in our shared bathroom."
7608,You probably don't worry because it's not a problem for you now.
7609,"When you or someone close to you gets sick and can't pay for, then all of the sudden it becomes real."
7610,"And if you would rather be 37th than 30th, then I don't know what to tell you buddy."
7611,Just don't get sick I guess.
7612,As far as I know it's a shitshow with the rollout there.
7613,"Most of my husband's family is 60+ and they just this week got their appointments for getting it next month, the ones closer to 90 were told to go 50+ km to get theirs... without being provided a transport too."

7642,At least no one I knew did.
7643,Where do you live?
7644,"a particular virus type we might give a name like SARS-CoV-2 is less a ""species"" and more a constantly shifting sea of variants."
7645,all viruses have variants.
7646,it is normal &amp; expected.
7647,once people are vaccinated their immune system will be kept up to date thru community exposure.
7648,"just stay in good physical condition and you'll fight it off like you do variants of other cold &amp; flu viruses, etc."
7649,"The same people downvoting you I'm sure looked at Italy in Jan/Feb 2020 and thought ""Sucks for them"" and ignored it."
7650,A physician doesn’t have to demand to be called *doctor* either.
7651,"When I go to see my optometrist each year, I refer to him as “Dr."
7652,Smith“
7653,"After thinking about it, I think it may be best for healthcare professionals to introduce themselves with their credentials, like some of the other posters have said."
7654,That way patients know what type of ‘Dr.’ is treating them.
7655,"Yes, most have their credentials on their white coat and badge, but are patients going to read that and understand what the letters mean?"
7656,"Yah because the employees realized they could do their job remote, abandoned expensive apartments that were barely large enough to live in, let alone work in, and since the timeline of opening back up offices is still in the air, there will at least be a delayed reopening for many offices because you can't just force someone to move in an instant like that... 

Plus renting office space is so expensive for smaller companies if they can just pay for a desk and equipment (they had to do this anyway) and pay the person's WiFi bill."
7657,Let the employee pay the rent on their office space lol
7658,Well I live in Mexico and you can’t imagine the level of frustration I have with the government 😣
7659,The scope of practice is entirely different between a nurse and a nurse practitioner.
7660,"Nurses do not diagnose, prescribe, or devise treatment plans."
7661,Nurse practitioners do all these things.
7662,Calling a nurse practitioner a nurse is a misnomer.
7663,Disingenuous.
7664,"Just because you have a doctorate degree doesn't mean that that you have to demand to be called ""Dr."
7665,"x."""
7666,Go to a hospital and I guarantee you won't find pharmacists or physically therapists demanding to be called Dr.
7667,When will it be unblinded?
7668,"this is why people go 150k in debt for an english degree

sometimes mama and papa need to have a little bit of a say, considering they are gonna co-sign the loan"
7669,My country beat it 2 times (it kept coming back from immigrants in neighboring countries) but this year we are having trouble due to one of the variants.
7670,"If other countries did their part, we wouldn't have so many extremely contagious variants."
7671,People had stopped caring from Sept / Oct itself.
7672,"New Hampshire's ""mandate"" had no teeth anyways, and we wore masks by choice before it was implemented and still are."
7673,I'm not really sure why this same user keeps obsessively posting about my state when the move was completely meaningless.
7674,"He is kind of unique in being vehemently anti mask while being pro vaccine at the same time, which makes me think he is capable of understanding not everyone who wants a vaccine has gotten one yet and that's why masks are still the polite thing to do (until everyone waiting for the vaccine gets one)."
7675,"Like this is at least the third post I've seen by the same OP on this topic, and I would really appreciate it that he would stop trying to advertise NH as some kind of safe haven for rude people."
7676,We arent.
7677,Yes that’s what we want to do.
7678,Spread conspiracy theories about Florida.
7679,🤣🤣
7680,She is a nurse...a nurse practitioner.
7681,A nurse practitioner can still be called a nurse because they are just an advanced practice nurse.
7682,Also the only difference between a master of science in nursing and a doctor of nursing practice is a handful of administrative and leadership classes.
7683,No additional medical knowledge.
7684,So?
7685,"I assume everyone sees ""new variant"" and reads ""new antibody resistant vaccine"" at this point because there are tons of new variants being found all the time, but the only ones that matter and thus get reported on are antibody resistant."
7686,"3 Lakh = 300,000"
7687,And your health insurance won’t cover COVID treatments if you decided not to get vaccinated.
7688,I mean Florida actually has seen an actual increase while Texas saw a decrease.
7689,"But this is an important point, one of the things to note is that California's COVID cases have ticked lower than TX or FL."
7690,In none of the 3 states has there been a *spike* like in winter.
7691,"But CA has settled at about 6 cases per 100K, compared to 10 for TX and 29 for FL."
7692,"Positivity rates are 1.0, 6.7, and 10.5 respectively per some random website I found."
7693,"Now there's always some randomness involved (you couldn't have predicted that Michigan and not, say, Ohio would have the worst surge in January), so it's possible CA is doing better and FL is doing worse just out of pure randomness."
7694,"But I think this does suggest that reopening probably *does* have an effect, as common sense would imply."
7695,"But if vaccines and natural immunity mean only 50% of the population is susceptible to the virus, then the odds of exponential growth are just much lower (though, low probability does not mean impossible as Michigan revealed)."
7696,"So, in that sense, the exponential spread that some feared in March ended up being less likely than expected."
7697,"Given the politics of their constituents, I think the modal resident of all three states can be reasonably satisfied."
7698,They did!
7699,It all came back completely normal.
7700,"I got sent home with no explanation, and I'm thinking this was my problem."
7701,"I have PCOS so I was thinking a giant cyst ruptured, but I got a cat scan and ultra sound and nothing wrong with my organs, just generally inflamed and swollen."

7707,"This isn’t an all or nothing situation, nor has it ever been."

7714,"In a medical (clinic/hospital) setting, the term ‘doctor’ should be reserved for those with MD and DO degrees."
7715,The average patient will believe anyone introducing themselves as Dr. X is a physician.
7716,We must avoid this confusion to preserve trust in healthcare.
7717,"Chiropractor, psychologist, optometrist, etc."
7718,"All doctors, all acceptable, none are physicians."
7719,“how jobs should be?” no.
7720,"if an employer wants their employees to come to the office, they come to the office."
7721,"if an employer wants their employees to wfh, they wfh."
7722,that’s how jobs should be
7723,Ok thanks for clarification!

7725,and this is under mass under-reporting....
7726,If you want to go to Mars one day you can't be having a travel ban.
7727,"All we need to do is have walk-in vaccinations at pharmacies, and that will get a lot of people."
7728,Unfortunately it'd probably be too late for the Olympics.
7729,large swathes of the American populace have been genuine morons throughout the entirety of the pandemic so why stop now?
7730,"I don’t disagree, however I take issue with those who say she is just a nurse."
7731,She’s not.
7732,She is a doctor of nurse practitionership.
7733,Also IIRC Japan ordered a lot of moderna vaccines which is a US company so that could significantly help them
7734,Literally zero evidence for this provided.
7735,The researchers just said that it has mutations that could make it more resistant to antibodies.
7736,My bet is that it’s got an E484K/E484Q mutation and that’s about it.
7737,It’s trash article
7738,"I'd say it just helps as much to give antivaxers a point about vaccines turning people into zombies, but to each their own."
7739,"Should do both, ""All restrictions are gone starting July 4th weekend or once 60% of the country has been vaccinated, whichever comes first."""

7743,"doses % is only relevant in the extremes, small changes are expected and every state is basically hovering around the same number."
7744,"on top of that, the number itself is based on many factors, most of which are logistical such as vaccines arriving but not delivered to the inoculators, vaccines kept in reserve for whatever reasons they have to, or vaccines being transported from 1 place to another."
7745,"so again, useless stat unless its a ridiculous extreme"
7746,Of course we could have done things better.
7747,I just don't see why you think just because a country has wealth that they should handle COVID better.
7748,It's obvious that countries who've had experience dealing with pandemics and countries with compliant populations will fare the best.
7749,Also countries that are already naturally isolated (New Zealand) will have a natural advantage too.
7750,Do you wear masks because they stop the spread of the virus or because you think they're fun and look cool?

https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/vaccinated-individuals-dont-carry-virus-or-get-sick-cdc/2506677/

Being vaccinated effectively means you aren't spreading the virus."
7752,The benefit from wearing a mask after being vaccinated is negligible.
7753,Do you think the CDC needs to learn a thing or two from you?
7754,Because I trust they're correct to say that being vaccinated effectively eliminates spread.
7755,India is an exception because it did not take the right steps when they had a chance.
7756,SII was begging for funding to increase production.
7757,It got approved yesterday.
7758,"When the surge was contained, the head politician was upfront taking the credit instead of strengthening the medical system."
7759,The utter neglect of healthcare by the government had brought them here.
7760,This surge was totally avoidable.
7761,"I don't know, the people I've talked to who are younger and don't have plans on getting vaccinated seem more apathetic than hesitant or hostile."
7762,They don't feel they're at much of a risk and don't think it's worth the hassle.
7763,Or stupid.
7764,"so yea, you are saying dont follow the science, got it lol"
7765,Scientists correctly tell us masks reduce the spread of infectious disease.
7766,They've known that for decades.
7767,Politicians never acted on that knowledge for viruses like the flu because of the concept of acceptable risk.
7768,Biden encouraging vaccinations by saying mask mandates don't apply to vaccinated Americans would likely result in reducing apathy.
7769,I'm not sure how I can explain that more clearly.
7770,People don't like masks.
7771,"If getting vaccinated meant you didn't have to wear a mask, people would be more eager to get vaccinated."
7772,This is just very simple to me I don't see what's making it so confusing.
7773,This is ridiculously stupid.
7774,There will never be 100% efficiency in supply and demand and there NEVER IS in any field.
7775,\~10-15% of homes are vacant at any time and yet we have homelessness.
7776,Is that because people don't want homes??
7777,No.
7778,"It's because there's buying and selling and people moving, etc."
7779,"Same thing with vaccinations, they need to be distributed and then matched to an arm."
7780,There's a whole mess of logistics that has to happen before you get a shot in an arm and that lag time and inefficiency is the gap you see.
7781,Another point: Polling indicates at least 70% of people are willing to get the vaccine right now.
7782,We've currently vaccinated much much fewer than that.
7783,The issue is NOT demand.
7784,Agreed.
7785,It's extremely divisive.
7786,I see you’ve never tried to find care with Medicaid
7787,"It's so easy to wear a mask though, so why not just wear it annually during flu season regardless."
7788,I'm sure it would save lives.
7789,This headline is extremely disingenuous.
7790,https://bamatracker.com/
7791,"My first one hit me in an hour 103 fever felt like a drug almost, never had covid, never even left my house all year, saw no friends since covid started, still haven’t, so it’s weird, hopefully my second one doesn’t do anything cause it was pretty heavy"
7792,Lol at the guy telling people to read and understand things and then getting schooled by a policy analyst who pointed out he didn't understand the very source he was citing.
7793,Man's complains about redditors being uninformed then does that.
7794,Just comes off as a tool lmao.
7795,"My point is travel ban doesn’t work against Covid, there is so much silent transmission, unless a country completely shut off its border like North Korea, it’s not going to stop this virus."
7796,"And you seem to agree with me, so I don’t know what you are trying to argue?"
7797,"Well, the message has consistently been get vaccinated, social distancing and masks are still required."
7798,"So, there's a lot of apathy."
7799,"So, they see no benefit in the vaccine."
7800,Nothing changes.
7801,Agreed.
7802,It's better to just let tens of thousands of people die from the flu rather than wear a mask.
7803,How is it pointless?
7804,I even gave a 10% discount in the supply for the logistics of transporting the doses.
7805,"I'm not sure how else you'd be able to tell if a state is supply constrained, other than just declaring it like you are."
7806,And how are other states using a larger percentage of doses consistently above 85% and even 90%?
7807,That's my point.
7808,"People get so mad at people who can't do a simple thing like wear a mask during COVID, but they also won't do that same 'simple thing' during flu season."
7809,somehow i doubt there are that many people in a biden cult lol.
7810,"if the cdc says that masks arent necessary after being fully vaccinated, then thats that."
7811,"until then, we should follow the science rather than some random dude on r/coronavirus"
7812,*regardless
7813,Honestly I'm so happy we had this discussion 🤣 talked to my mom on the phone this morning and she decided to get one of the vaccines.
7814,Before this conversation I would have been much more nervous even though I know people who have gotten it with no issues.
7815,So thank you for relieving my mind before I even knew it needed to be relieved.
7816,"I know there’s concerns about variants, but since people who are vaccinated are now almost guaranteed not to get sick or die from it and almost everybody who was at risk will have had it in America by then, cases no longer hold the same weight they once did because they don’t hold nearly as much potential for harming people."
7817,There will soon come a time when they barely mean any of that at all.
7818,"So as Americans get increasingly vaccinated, yes there will be cases, but they soon will almost always mean the sniffles or most likely nothing at all compared to death or disability like they used to."
7819,"Hospitalizations and deaths will be what matters, because they’re the only reason we ever cared about Covid in the first place."
7820,They are the root cause of the suffering.
7821,"Once they’re gone, the cat has been declawed and should no longer be feared just because it exists."
7822,"I live in El Paso, it never affected me :)"

7826,I know Canadians and they must be absolutely livid that Americans are doing better than them at something.
7827,That's the way things will always be.
7828,We will never get to the point of zero risk.
7829,[removed]
7830,why should biden do that?
7831,"let the scientists make the decisions, not politicians"
7832,This statement implies all those who have died from the virus must be stupid.

7836,"Really good post, your posts are really insightful in general."
7837,"It’s just so frustrating to see the media coverage when you have: 

NY Post: VACCINES CAUSE HERPES AND PEOPLE TO GROW 7 ARMS 

then you have 

Twitter “experts”: THE NEW STRAIN 1.4.7.9.10 WILL MAKE EVERYONE DIE AND VACCINES WONT WORK AND KIDS ACCOUNT FOR 600% OF THE SPREAD!"
7838,"Vaccines are extremely effective and safe, and I know the worst voices get amplified, but there’s so much misinformation coming from both ends of the spectrum."
7839,Went to a backyard BBQ recently and had so much anxiety about it even though it was outdoors and literally everyone was fully vaccinated.
7840,"Yea, moderna was stopping them as well as IP law."
7841,"I have an anxiety disorder, being afraid of everyday situations is the norm for many people, add a pandemic on top of that and you get people who have a hard time letting go of that extra anxiety when it's all over."
7842,"Thankfully I'm not scared of the grocery store anymore but panic/flight mode still kicks in when I hear people cough in public, particularly if they aren't wearing a mask."
7843,I hope that goes away but knowing me it probably won't.
7844,People are downvoting this but it sounds reasonable to me.
7845,Not everyone is going to feel the same way of course.
7846,"Because being vaccinated means you have to keep wearing a mask, keep distancing, and keep dealing with all the restrictions."
7847,Most of the people who haven't been vaccinated absolutely aren't at serious risk.
7848,"How can you motivate these people to get vaccinated when Fauci and Biden just keep saying ""It's not safe to do so"" with absolutely no interest in explaining what they'd consider safe or when restrictions will go away."
7849,The supply isn't the problem.
7850,The availability isn't the problem.
7851,The messaging is the problem.
7852,And right now the messaging is that vaccination doesn't change anything for anybody.
7853,Anyone who didn't expect this to result in large scale apathy would have to be completely insane.
7854,D614G made wild type wuhan extinct within months due to how much more infectious it was.

7856,Not sure if I’m misunderstanding what you wrote or you’re misunderstanding how it works.
7857,So just to clarify:  the shot gets your cells to make a spike protein.
7858,Your immune system then reacts to that protein.
7859,(The ramping up of immune system can cause fever etc in some people.)
7860,"So yes, the vaccine causes an immune response."
7861,After the shot your body IS fighting an invader.
7862,It’s a harmless protein but your body doesn’t know that.
7863,"Later, if you are infected with sars-cov-2 virus, your body recognises that protein and already knows how to fight."

7865,"My guess is, of the 500k discrepancy, 350k is J&amp;J and the remaining 150k is hesitancy from the J&amp;J news."
7866,the supply used statistic is largely pointless and none of the stats youve mentioned are actually relevant as it takes time for doses to get delivered to the people administering them.
7867,"and no, california is not the only state, a handful of other states opened eligibility to everyone yesterday because demand has continued to outpace supplies"

7879,350k of it is j&amp;j
7880,Well it's kind of hard to blame them.
7881,If you're not at serious risk there's very little motivation to get vaccinated.
7882,Biden needs to say that being vaccinated means you don't have to wear a mask anymore.
7883,&gt;But then people who don't wear masks will just say they're vaccinated!
7884,They already aren't wearing masks.
7885,They hardly matter.
7886,The new concern is people who feel being vaccinated doesn't accomplish anything.
7887,"Telling them that getting vaccinated means another year of masks, distancing, and so on just tells them not to bother."
7888,It's time to stop amplifying that apathetic attitude.
7889,&gt;You must be from USA.

7896,We more than doubled it with a couple weeks to spare.
7897,your math is completely wrong tho.
7898,"even in the most hesitant states, we are seeing significant amounts of people getting vaccinated, which means that there is a smaller % of people who are lazy like you say than there are people who are completely hesitant or anti-vax."
7899,"therefore, the bigger issue is hesitancy and anti-vaxxers, not apathy."
7900,"dont get me wrong, they are both issues, but hesitancy and anti-vax is a far bigger % of the population than the lazy or the apathetic"
7901,"Lets put it this way... it wasn't ""evenly"" distributed like detergent."
7902,"Even so, there is plenty of available appointments at pharmacies (that's not including the state-run ones that are not listed)."
7903,And there are currently 7M excess vaccines in California.
7904,Let's say that only hitting 90% usage is realistic with the logistics of such a large state.
7905,That leaves us with 6.3M excess doses still able to be used.
7906,"If we bump the average up to 550k a day, there's still around ~11 days of supply."
7907,And then you have next week's allocation coming in which should be a minimum of 2M doses.
7908,"I definitely think California may be the only state that has an increasing daily average though, so they could easily become supply-constrained in the next few days (even NH, Maine, etc are trending down on the daily average)"

7915,I bet they were salty
7916,If that were the case we'd be going at a consistent rate until we hit at least 60% of adults in even the most hesitant states.

7946,"Imo, one issue is this has been a very traumatic experience for a lot of people and it’ll take time to move past that and stop feeling danger when you don’t need to."

8015,"They can't say, ""you can return to normal when you are vaccinated"", if normal already exists, and they have no power whatsoever to give a carrot or a stick."
8016,"Instead they rely on having actual evidence for their claims, which up until recently has not included a well evidenced claim that vaccines prevent transmission."
8017,They await data to provide advice.
8018,It's up to others how to message.
8019,"Rips for tips
Dabs for jabs"
8020,Because that would make too much sense and this country always has to do everything the hard way
8021,You clearly do not know a thing about Vietnam.
8022,Vietnam is superbly organized.
8023,The anarchy you mentioned is only applicable to traffic.
8024,LOL.
8025,You think human intervention can control nature?
8026,"Well, we can fuck it up with pollution maybe but for the long game my bet is on insects, viruses, bacteria and organisms with short generation times and a tendency to mutate quickly if we're talking about survival of individuals....and that is the issue here."
8027,Some humans will die and most will survive.
8028,And individuals behave with self-interest.
8029,Most animal behavior studies show little evidence for collective survival instincts.
8030,"In other words, I'm not going to behave in a way that maximizes your fitness."
8031,I'm out for myself.
8032,I'm actually a pretty responsible person...so if I really think I'm going to make a difference I'm not going to actively fuck others over...you know...the social contract and all that shit.
8033,But I'm going to act in my own self-interest and in the interests of my family so if I don't buy into your bullshit good luck trying to lockdown any viruses that might be floating around my neighbourhood because they'll be in your backyard real soon.
8034,It's not that I don't give a fuck about you PERSONALLY.
8035,I don't of course but that's a completely different issue.
8036,"It's just that I know these measures are stupid, ineffective and an insult to the intelligence of a sentient human being."
8037,I don't like to insult people.
8038,I will say that those who advocate outdoor masking don't understand viral transmission at all.
8039,"I'll go along with the indoor masking because I don't really want to create a scene in the grocery store but I think the human response to COVID has been pathetic, unscientific and largely driven by fear and political pressure upon governments afraid of being accused of inaction."
8040,Kids are stupid.
8041,I thought I wanted to go to Pepperdine!
8042,"good policy should listen to the expertise of many parties, but only parties acting in good faith."
8043,"anti-maskers are not acting in good faith, and thus their opinion should be relegated to a bin to be burned"
8044,Fair enough.
8045,"I think it generally carries a negative connotation, but hard to read tone"
8046,Didn’t Australia end religious exemptions?
8047,Why can’t we follow suit?
8048,Nonsense.
8049,The states that are most hesitant are states where restrictions do not exist in any meaningful way.
8050,"The resistance to vaccines exists for all sorts of reasons, but a lack of any scientific understanding of the world is a large one."
8051,"Canada is doing 16 weeks between doses, so not an apples-to-apples comparison either."
8052,"That does make sense, but the vast majority of people have no side effects to the vaccine, which would mean the vast majority of people have weaker immune system."
8053,"Young adults have the strongest immune systems, yet have the least side effects."
8054,"Lol,  I think maybe we're both wrong."
8055,"The more I think about, the more confused I get, lol."
8056,I just happy I'm vaccinated and hopefully will never find out if I'd have a mild or bad case.
8057,"The Covid vaccine is fully approved (each, individually, that has been emergency approved)."
8058,The only thing keeping it from not being an EUA is semantics.
8059,"They passed all trials with flying colors 

Not wanting it because it was an EUA is like drinking rusty water from lead pipes because the new pump well got a (reasonably) quick approval."
8060,Vaccines and weed are different.
8061,"There should be a tad bit more looking at for a vaccine, or something that is supposed to promote health, than a drug that is not necessarily meant to promote good health."
8062,It’s all ridiculous of course and I don’t believe any of that nonsense.
8063,"However, I do have a tiny heart monitor implanted in my chest."
8064,It’s the size of a small paper clip and the battery lasts about 5 years (after which they’ll remove it).
8065,"You can’t see it, but if I feel and search for it I can find it."
8066,"I have no idea how it works, but it does record and transmit data if I have an abnormality in heart rhythm."
8067,Pretty amazing technology!
8068,"The goal of the scientific community when dealing with a pandemic is always going to be geared towards absolute safety and prevention, i.e."
8069,it is in their interest to be incredibly conservative in their actions and assumptions.
8070,"The fact of the matter is that policy is nuanced and there are a wide array of both acceptable and unacceptable risks, trade-offs, and compromises that also need to be taken into consideration."
8071,"We are not governed or represented by scientists, and it is not denial of science to listen to what that community has to say while also weighing that information against other legitimate interests."
8072,"Scientist are just that, scientists, and we should not rely solely on their word as to what appropriate policy is."
8073,"A good policy should take the expertise of many different parties into account; scientists, psychologists, economists, educators, etc."
8074,in order to offer a balanced and comprehensive response.

Not really."
8082,"It is always exponential, it's just that when the numbers are small enough it can take a while for us to notice how fast it's actually growing."
8083,"But COVID-19 is quite contagious, around 1.4-3.9, which could infect a hundred million in around a month starting with one person."

8111,Ten days ago it was at 312.
8112,"That's a 60 person increase, 60/312 = 19.2%."
8113,"(Before someone mentions it -- yes, the 7 day average is not up 20%."
8114,"But hospitalizations is the one metric where the 7-day average is likely worse than the daily count, which is stable in the case of hospitalizations."
8115,"Meanwhile, the 7-day average will undercount when cases are rising and overcount when cases are falling, for reasons that should be self-evident.)"

8145,It doesn't clean in between your teeth either...

8147,It's a lie that flossing companies used to sell their products to you and others and they are laughing at this post right now cause you're downvoting the truth cause they have you in their arms...
8148,They are making money off of you for no reason.
8149,It's called placebo effect... Flossing doesn't do shit.
8150,They have a wider scope because legislation sponsored by health insurance companies and hospital cooperations lobbied to let them practice with a wider scope.
8151,The only reason it was done was to save them money.
8152,The patient will still pay the same fee for inferior care.

8172,When is it expected to be allowed/approved?
8173,since this was phase 3.
8174,Is the efficientie measured same between all vaccine?
8175,"I figured out that some do 2 weekly pcr test, and the biotech/moderna just do a test when there are any symptoms."
8176,"Wow, you guys are unbelievable."
8177,Even if everyone was dying on the streets you would refuse to admit any potential risks of mutations.
8178,I literally don't care as long as I don't have to kiss you.
8179,"I'm just saying that whether science says so or not, I can tell that it makes my teeth look cleaner and it removes bad tasting and smelling crap."
8180,This is from my boss's boss.
8181,He said that vaccines protect you for maybe 3 mos.
8182,This means that if they want to maintain a good base of immunity in the office then they would need to schedule people for shots sooner than 3 mos.
8183,This means rotating people every couple of weeks.
8184,And then the shots have been making a lot of people sick so that's a rotating chunk of your workforce who is out sick from the shot every week.
8185,He sees masks as really the only reasonable thing you can do to prevent the virus so he thinks the office will require them at all times when we do go back.
8186,"FWIW, this is also his reasoning for not getting the shot himself."
8187,"Since, according to him, it only gives you 90 days or so of immunity, maybe 6 mos tops it's not worth it as he can get similar results by just wearing a mask."
8188,"Yes, it’s mega depressing - because numbers like this mean it’s not just anti-vaxxers or right-wingers not getting it."
8189,There’s a big chunk of people just too lazy or just saying they’re not going to bother.
8190,Even on here I’ve seen a number of “well I’m not afraid of the vaccine but I’m young so I won’t die from the virus so I’m not going to bother.” Just totally missing the point of herd immunity and virus mutations.
8191,A stark reminder to the west that this is far from over.
8192,Even as the richest countries in the world are on the cusp of herd immunity it seems like the disease is only starting to get a hold on the poorest countries.
8193,There is a massive global vaccine shortage right now.
8194,She should not be taking vaccine she doesn't need.
8195,My breath is completely fine cause I brush my teeth ..
8196,Which cleans your teeth...as I said flossing DOES NOT CLEAN PLAQUE... that's a lie faked by the flossing companies to sell their products...
8197,It doesn't do that.. it's called the placebo effect...
8198,Fauci said that's really rare
8199,"At least Covaxin seems to be effective against the Indian variant, according to data from today."
8200,So there's good possibility that other vaccines will also be effective against it (even though we can't extrapolate too much between vaccines).
8201,"I feel like sadly, our only hope to end this pandemic is for Covid19 to have a limited number of possible advantageous immune escape mutations, because I don't see how we can globally slow down the virus mutation speed."
8202,Unless vaccine manufacturers can miraculously produce faster...our endgame will be covid's limits in mutating.
8203,"I't will eventually reach it's most treathening variant, and if our vaccines still protect against it, we'll be fine."
8204,AZ is not delivering after whole fiasco from EU.
8205,"Germany, France and rest defamed AZ so hard and they threatened with lawsuit last 3 months."
8206,"Just look how ty treat J&amp;J and how they treated AZ, while both vaccines come from Ad6."
8207,"Its normal to want to investigate but to halt AZ in all EU because 1 in 250,000 chances is clear bias."
8208,And now EU is slapped because of that.

8214,Over 3 million new Covid cases in the first 21 days in April.
8215,"To put it in perspective, India had just over 2 million new cases from Jan 1st through March 31st."
8216,Not a good sign.
8217,It is clear that a large percentage of the adult population has never thought very much about vaccines until the past few months.
8218,Texas according to the CDC is 26th for per capita gun deaths.
8219,But nice freaking try.
8220,😳 such ignorance!
8221,Texas is the second most populace state...so yes...they do have more gun deaths..: than say Connecticut.
8222,"LOL, trust me, he's a sociopath!"
8223,That guy probably also claims that Covid deaths are inflated by car accidents and suicides while still insisting that an unrelated heart attack is the vaccine's doing.
8224,The simple answer is that the vaccines have been around for 6 months so people are only certain that they are effective for 6 months.
8225,"But this doesn't mean ""only"" 6 months."
8226,"Most vaccines are effective for years, usually for basically your entire life."
8227,Could you imagine the blowback within the US if we started giving out vaccines before our own population is vaccinated?
8228,These people are morons.
8229,"The US will definitely start sending vaccines in the near future, they don’t want to cede influence to China and Russia."
8230,No.
8231,She is fully vaccinated.
8232,We are pretty middle of the pack when it comes to vaccinations.
8233,It does look like we are through the worst of new cases.
8234,Positivity rate is down and daily cases have dropped from 8-9K to 6-7K for the last week.
8235,However vaccines are working we are experiencing about a quarter of the deaths that we did during the winter surge and they should definitely have spiked by now given previous surges.
8236,As crap as it is that no one is making appointments I definetly think walk-ins is probably the best way to reach alot more people.
8237,Pretty wild imo to be walking down the street and be able to get the vaccine no problem.
8238,When I I was scavanging for sites.
8239,I'm happy it is getting more available
8240,It is a slippery slope.
8241,"People stop wearing masks outside, then they forget them at home or in their car, and then mask compliance goes down even when necessary."
8242,Just wear a mask outside when you are near others until our numbers are waaay down.
8243,"Well, when masks were first suggested last year, nobody knew if COVID could spread easily outdoors."
8244,"But now, with more research, we now know that outdoor transmission without close contact is very rare."
8245,I think 80% of Americans won't be wearing masks outdoors come this summer.
8246,It was clearly stated that he had a complete block in a vessel.
8247,And thai being due to vaccine has been completely ruled out.
8248,You really need to stop spreading your assumptions and misinformation as some kind of facts.
8249,"Bell's Palsy was an early possible side effect (debunked I think) for the MRNA vaccines, which can also mimic a stroke."
8250,"I wonder if the symptoms are related, or if it's literally just a coincidence."
8251,"Or it could something totally unique to sinovac obviously, I have no idea."
8252,No evidence from the brain scans of something seriously wrong though is good news.
8253,New York lawmakers put the finishing touches on a piece of legislation mandating extensive new workplace health and safety protections in response to the COVID crisis.
8254,"The New York Health and Essential Rights Act, or NY HERO Act, sponsored by state Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) and Assemblywoman Karines Reyes (D-Bronx), calls for fines against businesses that fail to adopt and enact new standards to protect workers and stem the spread of coronavirus or other airborne diseases."
8255,"“Too many workers have already sacrificed their health for our community’s benefit,” Gianaris said after the Senate passed the measure on Tuesday."
8256,"“The New York HERO Act honors their efforts by giving workers the tools to protect themselves while on the job.”

The union-backed bill directs the Department of Labor to issue airborne infectious disease standards for businesses that’ll include protocols on testing, face masks, personal protective equipment, social distancing and other measures."
8257,"The standards will be crafted by industry-specific worker committees, and the bill also includes strong anti-retaliation provisions that allow workers to call out employers without fear of reprisal."
8258,"New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader, Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) (Hans Pennink/AP)

“The devastating infection rate and death toll that continues to ravage New Yorkers, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that the status quo is broken— workers must have meaningful workplace health and safety protections, with real enforcement,” said Dennis Trainor, the vice president of CWA District 1."
8259,"“This legislation is a long-overdue step to ensure all workers are protected on the job, and we call on Gov."
8260,Cuomo to sign this bill into law.”
8261,Yes I do.
8262,"You can list all kinds of dates, but that is all on the government and us."
8263,That they made promises they cannot uphold and that we just believed it (we should know better by now) and that so many people do not follow the rules (look at the RIVM compliance metrics and google mobility trends) put us in the shit we are in now.
8264,"Also, opening the schools had been a mistake."
8265,"With schools closed a little longer, I know it would have been hard, we would have been in a much better position by now and could have reopened more weeks ago."
8266,"We are trying to do the same as the UK, but at a much higher number of infections and significantly lower vaccination grade."
8267,The hospitals are currently just in an extremely fragile position.
8268,They have been over their max regular capacity since October last year (including COVID and non-COVID patients and mandatory BOSS beds).
8269,"Currently around 1,400 beds are needed on the ICU for everything."
8270,This means so we are currently 28% over the regular capacity of our ICU.
8271,And occupancy is only increasing currently.
8272,"They have ""expanded"" capacity, but this is just a farce, the amount of ICU nurses and physician are not increasing."
8273,"We are just putting an even bigger workload on them, and calling it ""extra beds""."
8274,They just have to accept that they have been extremely busy the last 6 months and that that will not change any time soon.
8275,And what do you think about other care?
8276,"All that care is being postponed for now, and the more people get in ICU, the more it has to be postponed."
8277,The last week's they have constantly decreased other care to make sure they could handle the increase of COVID patients.
8278,Now this decrease of regular care will take even long and the postponed care will stack up even more.
8279,"All this postponed care has to be done after this wave as well, which means full ICU's after this wave for even longer."
8280,All in all just a terrible situation in the ICU's.
8281,"Currently there are as many COVID patients in ICU as mid-May last year and because we do more regular now, as many ICU patients in total since end-April."
8282,And you have the audacity to ask the people in ICU to just accept the risk and extra load and ask me if I have the audacity to ask the government to wait letting go restrictions?
8283,...
8284,Go back to school and study how percentages work.
8285,Idiot.
8286,"Yep, this is what I always say."
8287,"Just look at Brazil, India or Italy at the beginning for what it would be like."
8288,"And per capita, Texas does not have the highest number of gun deaths."
8289,But nice try
8290,"If your argument hinges entirely on ""personal experience"" instead of facts and figures you can point to, why throw bombs like ""you have no clue what you are talking about""?"

8295,Are you for serious?
8296,Looks like you are seriously just repeating some sort of talking point you heard once.
8297,"In Houston, we are reaching a point where we have far more doses than demand."
8298,It's kind of concerning despite the stat I saw that said 43% of adults have gotten at least one dose.
8299,The demand has just bottomed out completely that all of our major vaccine sites are taking walk-ins.
8300,I wonder if covid came out in 1918 how many people would have died??
8301,?
8302,When so many people are carrying it we will get more variants regardless of how fast it mutates.
8303,Since the virus is so prevalent in countries like Brazil and india right now there is a lot of opportunities for the virus to roll a lucky dice and develop mutations that gain it an advantage over previous strains.
8304,This will keep happening until these countries where it is currently spreading uncontested get their shit together and get on top of it.
8305,I took the dog for a long walk yesterday and was not wearing a mask because I was outdoors and nobody within 500 yards of me 99% of the time.
8306,"But each time I approached someone, I got a dirty look and they very slowly put their mask on as they glared at me."
8307,"They didn't swerve out of the way to give me distance mind you, they kept walking in the same line but just really wanted me to know how much I was affecting them."
8308,So tired of this nonsense.
8309,There is no mask mandate outdoors.

8320,His advice lines up with the CDC as well as my state’s health board.
8321,"With mild symptoms, you aren’t contagious ten days after your first symptoms."
8322,I don’t think NYS would tell me it’s safe to resume my life if they didn’t honestly believe that.
8323,I’m playing it safe and still not doing anything until 10 days after my positive test.
8324,I don’t even have any plans to see anyone or do anything until the family trip.
8325,I will also have had my second shot before the flight.
8326,Every bit of immunity helps.
8327,I don’t understand what your point is here.
8328,"Fully vaccinated Florida woman here, I wear my mask when not required only to make those who aren't fully vaccinated yet feel more comfortable wearing theres."
8329,"In a month or two when the only unvaccinated adults are those who are (mostly) unwilling to get the vaccine, I will ditch this thing."
8330,"Lol, More people get shot in Texas then all of America."
8331,Texans also regularly throw their shit on the front doors of homes.
8332,"The weather is also, disgusting in Texas."
8333,No.
8334,SH was the battlefield that started WWII.
8335,I hate this name so do many people allover the world.
8336,"Have no fear, us Hoosiers will fuck that all up for you folks in a few months."
8337,"Oh man I've had super spicy indian food and that just kept coming back at me all day, my breath was horrible"
8338,I see your point but this thing grows exponentially.
8339,"In 10 days the number of death its going to be at least 5000, and it will continue to double until it burns itself out."
8340,"By then the daily deaths could be like 80,000 per day or more."
8341,Of course those are crazy numbers.

8343,"I’d feel comfortable going to a domestic wedding when fully vaccinated but no chance I’d go to an international one right now, mostly because I wouldn’t want to get stuck in Poland if anything with borders happens."
8344,"Also, in the very small chance you got COVID, I’m guessing you wouldn’t want to deal with that in a foreign country."
8345,You guys are still going on about that 4 million?
8346,That's less than 20% of the AZ vaccines presently in the US.
8347,And the US has absolutely no plans to use them domestically.
8348,Just send them literally anywhere else.
8349,Well it sounds like it got a year's notice originally but didn't get any updates in the meantime.
8350,I made an edit for ya.
8351,I would be ashamed to live in a place named like that.
8352,They probably read an article on the 6 month update from the phase 3 studies.
8353,They still found effective immunity 6 months post vaccination.
8354,They cannot say longer than that for sure because they cannot see the future.
8355,"That said it is highly likely immunity lasts much longer than 6 months, likely years or even decades."
8356,[deleted]
8357,"If you go to covidactnow it's no longer severe

https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/?s=1765686"
8358,Well the good news is that flights should be cheap.
8359,"I dunno this is pretty complicated, if it were me personally I would probably go."
8360,"Being vaccinated I would feel safe, I'd be eager to travel, and companies asking people to come back to work on a certain date are going to have to expect people to phase back in over time for various reasons, for example they might not be vaccinated or their living situation may have changed or who knows what."
8361,"But from your friend's perspective, from where else are people coming for the wedding, how big is it going to be, and will it be indoors?"
8362,"The US and UK are probably doing the best among large developed countries but if for example they're going to get people from all over Europe, that sounds very risky for those people, unless they can all get vaccinated somehow."
8363,I'm sitting at my desk at work typing this.
8364,In liberal AF Connecticut.
8365,I'm wearing no mask.
8366,I see others at their desk with no mask.
8367,Where the hell do the people in these comments even exist?
8368,DO they really exist?
8369,The thing is that the people who break the rules in order to party have no issue with ignoring the curfews as well.
8370,Just one more thing for them to rebel against.
8371,"It is not, I have every ""compulsory"" and voluntary vaccination inside my body, the last one was the flu this autumn."
8372,Yet I 100% agree with the post you are replying to.
8373,"The risk at individual level is being kicked under de rug of ""overall good"" and the only age split so far was published by UK."
8374,"And that one showed very clearly the risk being inverse with age, while the risk of serious covid goes the other way."
8375,"This looks to be only for Ontario, not the rest of Canada as far I can tell."
8376,Do you have to wear the mask outside or just in businesses?
8377,False.
8378,But nice try.
8379,You are showing your ignorance.
8380,Just moved here from California.
8381,Now that is a third world shit hole.
8382,I watched that shit hole happen over the past 43 years.
8383,So cal is so dirty and full of trash.
8384,"Texas is cleaner, better air, more work being done on infrastructure, waaaay better schools, safer."
8385,Woot!
8386,The difference in schools is insane.
8387,California we had an amazing district for California...  but that doesn’t even compare to Texas.
8388,"Your thought process baffles me, how exactly does your experience correlate to literally anyone else?"
8389,Glad you don't get anything stuck in your teeth?
8390,You come off extremely unlikable and using a toothpick is the equivalent of using floss.
8391,You've also packed your comment full of contradictions.. maybe just sit this one out?
8392,Restrictions in many places are already being removed
8393,10/10 would have preferred a month of strict lockdown to this bullshit we have been doing all year.
8394,If you look at the big states they all have similar levels of infection per capita over the past year.
8395,Michigan had relatively less so it's reverting to the mean if you will.
8396,"Specifically they had less ""herd immunity"" going into the spring compared to California, Texas, New York or Florida."
8397,But natural immunity goes away.
8398,There are people who catch COVID-19 twice.
8399,Seems like 3 months is the norm.
8400,"https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-invitations-etiquette

“Traditionally, invitations go out six to eight weeks before the wedding."
8401,That gives guests plenty of time to clear their schedules and make travel arrangements if they don't live in town.
8402,"If it's a destination wedding, give guests more time and send them out three months ahead of the wedding”"
8403,"That's sounds incredible, I'm almost considering jumping on the plane"
8404,This is the answer.
8405,"What is frightening is that  
\- the derivative of the total number of death is increasing (2000/day)."
8406,\- the derivative of this derivative also increasing (142/day\^2).
8407,That's the acceleration of daily deaths.
8408,"\- the derivative of this derivative of derivative is also increasing (20/day\^3), that's the acceleration of the acceleration of the daily deaths."
8409,"Yep, that's look exponential."
8410,Also do they have a high % not taking vaccine?
8411,No one really knows.
8412,"People are not ""obeying"" restrictions maybe but it's not like it's worse than any other state right now."
8413,One big contributing factor is that when youth sports restarted routine testing become required for the participants.
8414,More like less than 10.

8418,AZ is not delivering the doses that we ordered.
8419,"In Poland we'll be getting around 30k AZ next week, and 1.2M Pfitzer, even though we ordered roughly similar amounts of both and never halted using AZ."
8420,And that's what I mean by doing their best.
8421,"I'm pretty sure when the vaccines were being exported to other countries a few months back, they were not really approved of in India."
8422,Better to provide it to other countries than leave it rotting in a freezer.
8423,"(Obviously vaccines don't ""rot"" but I believe you get my gist)."
8424,I've been talking to several people at work who are 100% convinced that the vaccine gives you immunity for no more than 3-6 mos.
8425,They're saying that this means we may never be able to really get back into the office or that if we do we'll be required to wear masks at our desks for 8 hrs a day as it's the only reasonable precaution we can take.
8426,Keeping some kind of database of who's vaccinated and who isn't isn't practical when you need a new shot ever 3 mos.
8427,Does anyone have any idea where this idea is coming from that the shot is only good for 6 mos tops?
8428,The risk seems similar (essentially close to zero) for both but the supply situation and the fact that J&amp;J is a single dose that's potentially more effective against SA variant would lead them to prioritize it over AZ.
8429,"I think they mean it would hypocritical to ban AstraZeneca but allow the J&amp;J, because they both are thought to have the same problem with blood clots."
8430,It would be incompetent to ban them both due to very low incidence of blood clots and then leaving the country with limited vaccine options.
8431,So I got my second shot on Monday; say after I wait my two weeks my state decides to drop the mask mandate.
8432,What would y’all recommend I do?
8433,Do I need to continue to wear one while shopping and stuff or since I would be fully vaxxed would I not even have to worry?
8434,I want to get back to as normal as possible but I also don’t want to be a part of the problem
8435,"You didn't alter the headline ""a little""."
8436,You wrote an entirely new headline.
8437,Did you see anything on death reduction?
8438,I read their pdf and a couple news articles but didn't see explicitly listing out death or hospitalization percentages.
8439,This Reddit user has extra qualifications to tell others what to think.
8440,"Believe them,  they perform research!"
8441,"""might be""

Pretty sure that IS the case."
8442,It’s frustrating to still people being alarmist when they see a picture of a video of pedestrians without masks outside.
8443,"For all the “yeah science rocks!” people out there, they still don’t seem to realise that outdoor transmission is incredibly low."
8444,Just because you think you are not anti vaxxer doesnt mean you aren't.
8445,You refuse to be vaccinated due to pseudoscientific arguments and exaggerate its risks.
8446,You ARE an anti vaxxer.
8447,Sorry to say.
8448,"We also have Sam Adams sending beer money to people who get vaccinated, and Krispy Kreme giving away donuts!"
8449,"Come to America, get a vaccine, and receive a joint, a beer, and a donut :)"
8450,I was more thinking of the massive contingency of people that think it changes your DNA or has a radio chip in it.
8451,and where did you get that nonsense from?
8452,"I,m sorry but usually I am a nice and polite fellow but you are spreading BS on this international forum with stuff that comes out of your behind."
8453,"Now say that you're sorry, delete or edit your false post and don't do it again!"
8454,You are an anti-vaxxer.
8455,"Texas: 3,297 new cases/day 
2,855,052 total cases

The numbers are available for anyone willing to look up."
8456,I don’t see this as a successful campaign against covid.
8457,Texas is increasing currently.

8459,Well at least Kejriwal seemed somewhat honest about the situation.
8460,That's at least a good start.
8461,It doesn’t.
8462,There is too many factors at play for the claim you’re responding to be true.
8463,Sure infections play a role but there are clearly other important factors that person is ignoring.
8464,"It takes 3 weeks for the first dose to work (real world data based on Israel, while clinical data showed 2 weeks)."
8465,So there's a lag before it even works.
8466,Add in re-opening + people refusing to get vaxx + death itself lags hospitalization which lags getting sick which lags getting infected... it *will* come down.
8467,"People say that Texans are still wearing masks, but that's usually if the business asks them to."
8468,"Restaurants have been busy for a while, and have been packed the last few weekends."
8469,"They make you wear a mask to go into Rangers Ballpark, but nobody really wears them during the game."
8470,People are still meeting at homes maskless after being out and about.
8471,I've had both Pfizer shots last month and if I have a choice I'll go to a maskless store over a mask mandated store.
8472,"At some point, you've got to let it go."
8473,"With vaccines available to everyone, we should be a couple of months away from the old normal."
8474,Cool.
8475,Canada is still allowing flights from India daily..
8476,It's sad as Health Canada (and associated orgs) have repeatedly said that it is spread through air.
8477,"This guy, Ionnadis - the arrogance of some assholes."
8478,That’s one data point also.
8479,Texas has a trickier component than New York...vast rural populations etc.
8480,and they are second in number of vaccine and case load per capita Texas has been much lower than new York!
8481,All the reported blood clot issues happen within about two weeks of administration (this was true for AZ as well) with most occurring within 10 days.
8482,We're getting closer to the window at which additional issues should have occurred.
8483,"Therefore, the number could still go up (we're a few days away from 10 days out where most cases happen) but it is *increasingly* likely that it will not - because we're running out of time for cases to appear."
8484,There's really no cause of action that could cause issues further out down the line simply because there is virtually no residual vaccine material or residual spike protein leftovers in the body once you get  more than a few weeks out.
8485,"If a blood clot is going to happen, it's going to happen early."
8486,Agree.
8487,"Just in the last 24 hours 300,000 cases have been reported in this country."
8488,2000 deaths is a big lie created by the government to seem like they have it under control.
8489,"I mean, we do have 1.4 billion people, not easy vaccinating everyone."
8490,At least that's something the govt's doing its best.
8491,[removed]
8492,They have not stopped testing.
8493,I live in Texas.
8494,Testing is available all over the place.

8513,"Since the latter is a much smaller, specialized workforce, they chose the healthcare professionals."
8514,At the detriment of long term public health and trust.
8515,A no win situation.

8640,"It's less of a pain to just wear it than to constantly take it on and off, especially with headphones on."
8641,"May first is when my state's mandate ends, so I'll be taking off then."
8642,"Sure, but the emergency we're experiencing isn't over yet so that seems a bit premature to worry about."
8643,Pleasantly surprised at the minimal side effects I have so far.
8644,"Other than a stomachache I had last night and a sore arm I’m actually doing pretty good, or at least better than what I was expecting."
8645,I’ll see how today goes.
8646,I’ve been taking Tylenol to help with my arm and hydrating a lot
8647,Some friend you are.
8648,“Do as I say or we can’t be friends”.
8649,"I mean, I think it’s pretty dumb to keep covid restrictions in place just to protect lazy, apathetic young morons."
8650,"If they’re too lazy to get the shot and they catch covid at a concert or something, that’s 100% on them."
8651,We shouldn’t be trying to protect these people when they won’t protect themselves.
8652,Aside from what you've posted it's a lot easier getting food un-stuck between your teeth or under gums with floss rather than stabbing at It with a toothbrush.
8653,"&gt;A health official draws a dose of the AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, at Infectious Diseases Hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka January 29, 2021."
8654,"India reported more than 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 over the last 24 hours, the highest single-day tally for the country so far, health ministry data showed on Wednesday."
8655,"Coronavirus infections also rose by a record, increasing by 295,041 over the last 24 hours, the data showed."
8656,"The time for throwing away nationalism was long ago, but the world is heading in the other direction."

So like... Israel and the UK don't count eh?"
8658,"Ahahaha

Get bent vassal states on the imperial periphery, imagine we would risk American human capital..."
8659,"I mean ""lives"" for you"
8660,To an extent.
8661,I was supposed to move to India over the summer.
8662,"However, my program receives funding from the Department of Education."
8663,"Since the U.S. government had COVID-related advisories in place, my program's administrators decided to move online."
8664,Sort of sucks.
8665,"I know India's getting hit hard, but my fiancée lives there and we haven't been able to meet for over a year now."
8666,Yeah this is a nothing burger as far as the article is concerned.
8667,AstraZeneca has delivered very few vaccines to NL compared to what Janssen will deliver.
8668,"AZ is easy to replace or assign to certain groups, Janssen is not."
8669,They are talking about giving AZ to people under 60 too if agreed with your GP - but currently all the AZ doses are reserved for the group 60-64 and probably not a single AZ dose will be available until mid May.
8670,He’s been right more often than most.
8671,That’s a long winded way of saying you’re an anti-vaxxer.
8672,problem with them is that they didnt and they dont give a shit about it
8673,"This article reeks of Eurocoping, or I guess in this case, Indocoping."
8674,You'll get your turn.
8675,It's been pretty freaking clear that the goal is 60-70% of the population vaccinated.
8676,And it's becoming clear that that could be completely over by end of summer.
8677,If people get their shots.
8678,"It's insane that you and others are arguing that ""people don't want to get a shot because the messaging has told them we have to get enough people shots before things go 100% back to normal""

It's self defeating."
8679,If that's actually how people are thinking then the answer is we'll not go back to normal unless the virus mutates into a less virulent but more infectious strain and burns itself out.
8680,how long do i wait after having covid to get the vaccine?
8681,Thank you for contributing to vaccine apathy.
8682,I appreciate you for prolonging the pandemic.
8683,/s
8684,They've said they can meet both domestic demand in India and international contracts.
8685,It's important to remember that this is a source of national pride for India having developed this vaccine and they want it to do well commercially as an export.
8686,Also that this is not the only vaccine being manufactured or distributed in India so their population won't be reliant on just one.
8687,My rotary club met for the first time in person in a year.
8688,One more baby step to normal.
8689,Thankfully I don’t think you can be an anti vaxxer and believe in the Rotary Club simultaneously since we pretty much eradicated polio from Africa.
8690,Next stop: Afghanistan and Pakistan
8691,"yeah sorry, I should have explained that a bit better."
8692,COVID isn't my concern.
8693,I'm vaxxed and ready to go.
8694,Booking a flight and potentially being over there and having shit hit the fan is my concern.
8695,"I know someone else mentioned not to be concerned about going back to the office, but having to take time right after being wfh for an international wedding just feels like bad optics."
8696,Do i have time and money?
8697,Sure.
8698,Do I wanna spend my PTO days and the money I saved on a vacation to Poland right now?
8699,"No offense to Poland, but no."
8700,"I started building out places I'd much rather see around the United States for the time being, then I'll start making my way back to international travel."
8701,"You're leaving out the type of blood clot, though."
8702,This is a much more dangerous type of clot.
8703,Michigan still has below average infection numbers on a per capita basis.
8704,Even after the past two months of high numbers they are still about 40th in the country.
8705,Basically they avoided a lot of this over 2020 and now are catching up.
8706,"I don’t disagree with you at all, my only issue is when people think of nurse practitioners as just a nurse."
8707,It’s an inaccurate assessment.
8708,Totally agree she should not be advertising herself as a medical doctor.
8709,The idea of getting it is not to pass it to anyone-including people you care about.
8710,That is a risk/sacrifice worth doing for them.
8711,But yeah we don’t know everyone’s background.
8712,"If there is a bigger chance of not having covid, i am for that, but that isn’t the case for some."
8713,"As i said above, i would choose to observe myself for 14 days after the vaccine rather than 14 days every time i feel something is off."
8714,imo it will be more burdensome for the people i care for if i left them without giving any vaccine a chance.
8715,"I’m guessing they didn’t want to do what AZ did and go to the public too early before they’re 100% sure, so they’re going radio silent for now."
8716,"Wow, you guys are unbelievable."
8717,You’ve decided to pretend that it’s over when nearly a quarter of the population (children) is not yet eligible for a vaccine.
8718,"And I know what the replies will be: kids don’t get sick, vaccines are coming, etc, etc."
8719,Doesn’t change the fact that it’s ridiculous to claim it’s “over” when it’s still circulating widely in a lot of the population.
8720,"It’s good news that the highest risk people are mostly vaccinated, but it is not the same thing as “the pandemic is over.”"
8721,"The UK vaccine portfolio is (or rather, soon will be) broad enough to cover all the UK population, without the need or AZ or J&amp;J."
8722,There is no need to take additional risks when supplies exist.
8723,Everyone will be covered.
8724,"If I lived elsewhere, then obviously my risk assessment may differ."
8725,[removed]
8726,The fact it hasn’t been updated since like March 8th makes it even more impressive
8727,That is not what I said.
8728,I’m complaining that there is no clear metrics for fully lifting restrictions.
8729,"I don’t need a date, but I want a clear metric or metrics."
8730,Why is that so hard to understand?
8731,And why are you so aggressively defending the fact that in most states there is no clear metric or indicator for lifting restrictions?
8732,It’s not really a data driven approach.
8733,"If we are “just seeing now what percent vaccinated is needed”, well, needed to do what, exactly?"
8734,Lower hospitalizations and deaths and cases I assume?
8735,How about we set clear metrics on those then?
8736,"My niece's boyfriend is very anti-vaccine and he's from MS. Super smart guy studying science, so it was surprising to me but I sensed very deep anti-vaccine thinking in MS, peer pressure from friends and neighbors."
8737,"Thankfully, my niece gave in and got the vaccine since it's the only way she could travel back home to Nepal and not infect her parents there."
8738,Probably causes cancer too... amirite.
8739,Exactly.
8740,Michigan was very locked down.
8741,"Vermont has also been super locked down throughout the pandemic, but the difference is that Vermont doesn't have a major metropolitan area like Michigan does and also Vermont is probably MUCH more liberal (and likely to follow covid rules very strictly) and much more well off (meaning Vermonters are more likely to be able to afford to WFH and effectively social distance)."
8742,"Michigan has Detroit, as well as a bunch of covid deniers who rebel against covid restrictions (and also attempt to kidnap the governor due to imposed restrictions)."
8743,I do have serious doubt it rises to the level of literal PTSD.
8744,I believe we had 3 cases in Canada and all seemed to be recovering at home
8745,"For one, the dangers and long-term consequences of the flu are already understood, treatments have been developed, and we understand that the annual flu vaccine is the best we can do to mitigate the flu, and non-selfish people will get that."
8746,"We’re only a few months away from a Covid vaccine for children — if we were a few months away from a total flu vaccine, wouldn’t it seem a reasonable ask to experience some minor discomfort until that could happen?"
8747,"India is really going whole hog into this ""US is hoarding vaccine materials"" misinformation."
8748,Seems like every single publisher from the country is pushing the narrative that the US is sitting on a mountain of raw materials that we aren't using.
8749,[removed]
8750,200 more people are dying of Covid in Germany than the UK every day right now.
8751,"A good chunk of the reductions in deaths in the Uk is due to lockdown, but if deaths of older lives had followed the reduction rates of younger lives rather than reducing really fast due to vaccines, the UK would still be seeing 200+deaths per day too."
8752,It might be that if there was enough Pfizer around you could save some of those 240 people but delays cost lives too.
8753,Ok. Are you saying Texas has a big problem or not?
8754,Most likely the US will be buying from Ocugen who places the order with Bharat Biotech who then ships it back out as US humanitarian aid to other countries.
8755,"Ocugen is the company getting the FDA approval in the US and has rights to the US market, but since we don't need more vaccine, however Covaxin is able to be kept at room temperature for 2 months and in a standard refrigerator for 2 years - it's an ideal candidate to ship around the world to places that can't distribute a vaccine like Pfizer's."
8756,No you can't get a second dose like that in Canada.
8757,These are first dose spots only.
8758,Youyang Gu an absolute legend for not only predicting the mini fourth wave but getting the day of peak cases to within two days.
8759,Called his shot month and a half ago lmao.
8760,https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/
8761,Their comment and yours are extremely irrational.
8762,Efficacy is greater than AZ but that isn’t the only factor for consideration.
8763,Both vaccines can be used.
8764,Original commentator had a typo that they've since fixed
8765,"So I'm not so worried about the saline injection, but I'm looking at this as a math equation."
8766,If 8000 shots were to be produced all made with idk a 10:1 ratio of saline to vaccine.
8767,"Did no one realize there were extra shots, or did some people just get injected with a whole lot more vaccine than they should have been?"
8768,"&gt;“We have been stressing to the United States that ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed,’” the minister, Chung Eui-yong, told reporters at the Kwanhun Club of South Korean journalists."
8769,Lol.
8770,We should have surplus vaccines since we have a decent amount of anti-vaxxers - give the shots to someone else who would appreciate them.
8771,"As with other mandates on the vaccine, I just personally think that is not going to happen until the vaccines are officially licensed and approved rather than ""Authorized for Emergency Use""."
8772,I would hate for that to become the standard.
8773,That's fine.
8774,I obviously meant no disrespect to a war vet.
8775,But pretending that there are no serious mental consequences to this pandemic is shortsighted.
8776,That is outstanding news.
8777,Can they scale production up quickly?
8778,India can use all the help they can get.
8779,Forever?
8780,Jesus.
8781,"Thank God


As soon as I read the headline I was about to cr@p my pants"
8782,So heartbreaking
8783,That only applies if you are pretending every single part of the process is a bottleneck.
8784,"For example the EU had planned to fill and finish EU produced J&amp;J doses in the US, but the US said that they would likely confiscate any EU doses if they cross the US border."
8785,So all in all the US decided that they would rather have fill and finish production sitting idle rather than the EU getting vaccines.
8786,It wasn't being an essential worker that was the problem.
8787,I was an essential worker working in an area where over 50 percent of the neighborhood got it.
8788,"No one in my store got it, because we were all wearing masks from January."
8789,"People in the neighborhood were acting like it wasn't real, and cracking jokes about us wearing masks."
8790,People were fake coughing on eachother.
8791,Bars were packed.
8792,"They did get their shit together when word got out that the neighborhood had one of the highest infection rates in nyc, also when everyone started seeing all the bodies at elmhurst hospital."
8793,I feel like there should be a vaccination goal for the end of the mask mandate.
8794,Like once 70% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated the mask mandate ends.
8795,"It would give people something to look forward to, a goal to work towards, and a light at the end of the tunnel."
8796,"My first shot on Pfizer sucked, second was almost nothing."
8797,I haven’t had COVID that I know of — but hopefully you have a similar experience.
8798,I got Moderna 2 last week and it was super mild for me too.
8799,Sore arm and mild head cold symptoms for ~8 hours and that was it.
8800,We do not have enough Pfizer vaccines right now to cover the whole population.
8801,Every single day 200+ people die from COVID here.
8802,Maybe (and this is a big maybe) there's an argument where people under 30 shouldn't take AZ.
8803,This argument pretty much falls apart once you approach people in their 40s though.
8804,"There's no calculation to even be made if you're 40+, the AZ vaccine is worth the ""risk"" almost immediately."
8805,Did you honestly just compare being in a war zone with not going in public for a year?
8806,Seriously?
8807,If I was a war vet I'd be fucking insulted.
8808,"We have Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax."
8809,These combined cover enough jabs for the entire population of the UK.
8810,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
8811,I've been hearing about these for a year now and still haven't seen a rapid test used.
8812,Really?
8813,What's the end point?
8814,Is it a certain number of vaccinations?
8815,Is it a certain  number of new cases?
8816,Is it hospitalizations?
8817,Is it when the vaccine is available to all adults?
8818,"Or when it's available to children, too?"
8819,"If there \*is\* messaging around this, it's been pretty weak and inconsistent across state or even county lines."
8820,"I absolutely see how ""over time"" is being communicated - and I think it's an extremely poor message."
8821,"It's vague, doesn't explain what the expectations are for getting to that point and does nothing to encourage people that are already hesitant."
8822,"If there's one misconception i wish would go away it's ""The British have bad teeth."""
8823,"They might not place an enormous emphasis on ""Straight Bright Hollywood Teeth"" but they have a public healthcare system that lets anyone go see a dentist and get procedures for $20-$50."
8824,"Compare that to America, where a simple trip to the dentist can cost you hundreds of dollars and god help you if you need dental surgery."
8825,"Children death rate is very, very low."
8826,It is lower than the flu for kids.
8827,Around 22 it gets worse than flu and then obviously MUCH worse for older people.
8828,So we always have accepted a certain amount of risk of infectious disease and unless you are arguing that that risk in general should change for all diseases the justification for The masks indoors really has gone away once everyone is vaccinated.
8829,Also keep in mind that it won't be nearly as much of a problem because the overall case numbers will be much lower as the virus will not be able to replicate and spread via the vast majority of the population.
8830,My school does offer a virtual option.
8831,Just over half our students have chosen it.
8832,We also have a mask mandate.
8833,I think we are doing plenty to protect those kids this school year.
8834,"My concern is for the fall, when my school has already announced that there will be no virtual option."
8835,"I’m worried that if mask mandates also end and kids under 12 still can’t be vaccinated, there will not be anything to protect those kids."
8836,Johnson and Johnson is known to have questionable morals in the pursuit for money so I am in no way surprised
8837,Those numbers seem very ambitious.
8838,I hope they can pull it off and then some
8839,My area has been under lockdown for nearly 6 months.
8840,"That had just as much, if not more, impact than vaccination, which is still only for those over 45."
8841,"As for being selfish, I'm giving up my spot for someone else."
8842,"Not sure that logic stands, but regardless, I am at peace with my decision."
8843,"My body, my rules."
8844,What is the cost of masking?
8845,I have never understood this position.
8846,So your complaining that there's no dates and then complaining newyork set a date for a capacity increase?
8847,"So damned if you do, damned if you don't?"
8848,I'm really not sure why you and others have a hard time understanding this - it's impossible to predict the future and put a date on things.
8849,"As for a metric, we're just seeing now what percent vaccinated is needed thanks to Pfizer running a giant ""trial"" with israel."
8850,But the number has been pretty consistent - somewhere from 60-70% vaccinated is needed.
8851,Are you kidding me?
8852,"The flu is seriously a much bigger danger to children's health than COVID is, and we have never forced all children to socially distance or wear masks to prevent flu transmission"
8853,She didn’t cite anything.
8854,She espoused these view in an interview with Dr. Fauci and he didn’t push back at all.
8855,Does anyone know why Novavax approval is taking so long?
8856,"With the other vaccines we heard lots speculating on approval timelines, but Novavax has turned to radio silence."
8857,Is it possible their trials were deemed insufficient and this is why we're now seeing a crossover?
8858,"&gt;the supply/demand tipping point is super concerning, and then if you keep scrolling down you're hit with the next article, which is about how you shouldn't change your behavior after the vaccine."
8859,Both of these things are true though.
8860,If every individual just jumps back to 2019 behaviors right away when they get vaccinated then we won't end the pandemic.
8861,People need to stop thinking of vaccines as a magic bullet.
8862,They are the most important part of ending COVID but they don't eliminate the short term need for masks and distancing at an individual level.
8863,[removed]
8864,This is what I don’t get on why they are stopping it.
8865,I would actually sign a waiver to get one if my area is a hotspot.
8866,Nobody is discussing the chances/effects of someone getting covid then spreading it then eventually dying without the option of the vaccine.
8867,"in my mind, if we got the vaccine on day one of the pandemic and the deaths would be only 1% for sure."
8868,Then we won’t be overcrowded with patients so we can actually focus on that 1%.
8869,Wouldn’t anyone take it then compared to this more than a year of suffering?
8870,"instead of observing possible covid victims for 14 days, why not observe those vaccinated for 14 days."
8871,The risk is less to all and imo the health workers would definitely choose this option more.
8872,&gt;it is not right to put them in harm’s way just to make people’s faces more comfortable.
8873,So don't take children to indoor dining and other such facilities?
8874,"This sub used to be very anti-indoor, maskless or not, but now we're saying it's not risky for kids to be indoors with masks?"
8875,Some of it is lack of education
8876,Even if everyone is.
8877,Masks are good because they lower spread and are effectively free and easy.
8878,But they aren’t that effective— especially all day in the same room.
8879,You are vastly overestimating how well masks work.
8880,They are intricate bags (you can’t just slap one together.)
8881,And different disposable bioreactor systems have different bag configurations.
8882,"Other supplies are super low too, many companies giving priority to “warp speed” accounts but even that is thin."
8883,"It’s pretty cool to think that each day of your vaccination period, your immune system is stronger against COVID than it was yesterday."
8884,I’m beyond excited to be only 10 days away from being completely worry-free about catching the stupid virus anymore!
8885,Wasn't this also a plot point in Contagion?
8886,"The legislation required to keep the restrictions expires in 5 months, and there was already grumbling about it when it was passed in March, so I very much doubt it would pass again if there was no threat imminent."
8887,"&gt;“my face is slightly more comfortable” 

You certainly have a way of building a strawman, that's for sure."
8888,Dont suffer through it to be tough.
8889,Tylenol worked really well for me.
8890,"Also avoid holding a sword above your head and screaming ""I have the power."""
8891,Results in lightning strikes 100% of the time.
8892,I know what you’re saying.
8893,I’m in NYC.
8894,"But I believe what the science is showing is that even in crowded cities, the virus does not spread outdoors."
8895,Period.
8896,We’ve seen article and study after study showing similar conclusions.
8897,"The exception may be folks standing shoulder to shoulder for hours at a time, yelling, like at a nascar event somewhere."
8898,The politicians on the left seem to be leaning towards ‘better to over restrict than under restrict’ and I think that’s an issue and leads to an erosion in public trust and gives credence to the conspiracy theorists.
8899,"If you have seen any science or evidence that there is some spread by maskless folks passing on busy sidewalks, I would love to see it and adjust my views accordingly."
8900,But this article and everything I’ve seen says there is not.
8901,Sorey
8902,That’s why I said “metric or date”.
8903,"Picking a metric, like percent vaccinated or hospitalizations, to lift restrictions means that events like JnJ being pulled would be accounted for."
8904,Most states have no metric or plan.
8905,"Mask mandates are literally “indefinite” in most states, as in there is no definite end or plan to end them."
8906,"Also I don’t think that saying “by July 4, there is a good chance you, your family and friends can get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout” is really a clear message for being “mostly normal” considering you can do that pretty much everywhere in the US already

And additionally, I think a lot of people are interested in “actual normal” rather that “mostly normal”, as in, no more mask mandates or capacity restrictions."
8907,"It’s well past time for us to talk about a plan for exactly how we will get actual normal, instead of, like, just setting random dates for when movie theater capacity can increase by 8% (that’s a real example coming from the state of New York)"
8908,"&gt; If you wait 6 months

Fine by me."
8909,[Here's a Derek Lowe article written about a year ago](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects) that discusses the various vaccine types being developed against COVID.
8910,"So far for COVID, we have mRNA (Moderna), deactivated virus (Sinovax) and DNA using a viral vector (J&amp;J)."
8911,"Novavax is in Phase III for a protein vaccine (e.g., manufacture the spike protein in a factory and inject that into you."
8912,Yeah.
8913,If you don't get vaccinated you probably will eventually get it.
8914,Or you are isolated from people that aren't vaccinated.
8915,(Rural)
8916,Or because they work a larger portion of public facing jobs and live in much higher density housing on average?
8917,Yeah it’s baaaaad right now
8918,Why is this downvoted?
8919,It’s the truth.
8920,Theres Like 3 rich countries for which it's almost over.
8921,Rest of us are eyeing the vaccines.
8922,Whereas poorer countries probably think about 2022
8923,[deleted]
8924,"I am generally pro relaxing outdoor mask requirements, but in NYC people are constantly forced into advocacy crowds at street corners waiting for the lights to turn."
8925,I think it makes sense to require outdoor masking until the metrics are really good.
8926,"Indoor, I don’t see a reason to budge until community spread is basically eliminated."
8927,The cost of mask wearing is almost zero and the benefit during community spread it pretty high.
8928,[removed]
8929,"&gt;And we don't know the long term effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines yet, either."
8930,They are completely new technology.
8931,"Sure, but at this point it's extremely unlikely that there are any long term side effects with high prevalence."
8932,Does your school not offer a virtual option?
8933,Our school district has many families that chose to remain virtual this year.
8934,"Adults that are vaccinated really shouldn't be much of a risk to children, even without a mask."

8967,The want people to wear masks because of people potentially lying.

8980,I agree.
8981,I think a lot of the evidence of increased transmission of the variants is more based on case increases and less on actual scientific proof.
8982,It seems to be just an assumption when cases go up and you need an explanation.
8983,"So, for MI he is saying lower levels of infections due to high restrictions, and then infection gets in and there you go...and he assumes the B117 made this easier, but that does seem to be an assumption."
8984,Just as cooler weather there is another assumption (assumptions that start to crack when you compare neighbor states like you did).
8985,"I know this sounds crazy, but its almost like this virus has a little clock in it and turns itself on and off periodically."
8986,"I have no problen with this, but that POS better put his photo in every death certificate too"
8987,"Finally, someone who understands statistics."
8988,"There’s still a ton of people who cross to work in Detroit from Windsor, I think it’s just closed for tourism"
8989,That article literally says that officials say the variant is not responsible for a rise of cases in India.
8990,Well the most dangerous outcome from a blood clot is death right.
8991,"According to this article: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-38265865 which quotes Dr Sarah Hardman, Deputy Director at the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare."
8992,&gt; So we're looking at maybe about three to 10 per million women dying as a result of having a clot that is attributable to use of their combined hormonal contraception.
8993,So chance of death from a bloodclot from birth control is 3-10 per million.
8994,"The figures here from Germany put the death toll from blood clots due to the AZ jab at 3 per million and the UK figures put it at 1 per million

So even though the type of bloodclot is more dangerous for AZ it occurs so much less that you are still less likely to die of it than dying of a bloodclot from birth control."
8995,So if you'd take birth control you should take the AZ jab.
8996,I honestly think the average human is just shit at comprehending tiny risks.
8997,"Despite what people think, a majority of Americans have been following the rules for the good of society."
8998,"If you don't believe me, you can look at the Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years/Super Bowl/Easter surges that never happened because we did make sacrifices."

9000,"We're more than 13 months into this and people are getting antsy for an ""endzone."""
9001,"We stayed home, masked up, cancelled vacations/weddings/birthday parties/holidays/etc, social distances, are now getting vaccinated for a virus that have a 0.01% chance to kill the people who are being affected by the restrictions the most."
9002,"I know for me, at least, I'm getting vaccinated not because I'm afraid of the virus, it's because I want my life back."
9003,"I haven't been to my office in 14 months, cancelled multiple get togethers with family that I look forward to, missed weddings and funerals..."
9004,I just need to feel like myself and my friends/family who are getting vaccinated did so with the understanding that vaccines were the endzone.
9005,And science says that they should be...
9006,"This rhetoric of ""Just a little bit longer"" or ""Just mask up, it's not that hard"" is making people like me, who still holds a ""follow the science"" narrative, seems incredibly dangerous for actually saving lives in the long run."
9007,"The vaccine hesitant are starting to say ""Why get vaccinated if nothing changes?"""
9008,and that is just something we should not be encouraging.
9009,This is export.
9010,You know that China also has to produce and deliver vaccines to their 1.4 billion population.
9011,So add over 200 million vaccines on top of the 260 million exported.
9012,"US numbers are very similar tot the EU, which has produced around 250 to 300 million vaccines as well (export + own use)."
9013,"So in absolute amount China produced more, per capita the US and EU produce more."

9021,"Other states, it will be a while."
9022,Ironically enough the states that have the larger vaccinated populations may have restrictions longer than states that have the smallest percentage of vaccinated people i.e.
9023,Alabama vs. Massachusetts (I'm in the latter).

9032,So explain why Indiana and Ohio aren’t also on fire?
9033,Less natural immunity is the only thing that can explain how neighboring Indiana and Ohio are not also on fire.
9034,There is no wall or force field separating them.

9042,You're comparing apples to oranges.
9043,"If we look at Pfizer alone, which has been the US's largest supplier, Germany invested way more in its development."
9044,Indeed Pfizer took exactly $0 from Operation Warp Speed for vaccine development.
9045,"Germany also pre-ordered more doses per capita, as did a couple dozen other countries."
9046,"So... the US spent less on the Pfizer vaccine development, and less on pre-orders."
9047,Can you tell me why they're first in line?
9048,"(Hint, I already gave you the answer in my post above)."
9049,"Yes, being fully vaccinated and wanting to go back to pre-2020 life now that you are essentially not a risk = doorknob licker."
9050,"This is the opposite of no new normal, though."
9051,Those folks probably won't get vaccines.
9052,If two individuals are fully vaccinated then it is a bit silly to keep wearing masks distancing yourself with them.

9058,Truth id i don't care.
9059,If you’re vaccinated the risk of contracting or spreading is incredibly low.
9060,"If the health officials and experts are telling you it’s ok for vaccinated individuals to loosen up a bit, why not listen to them?"
9061,"Well that’s also not what I said, my original comment was about how more people would be on board for still following restrictions if there were a clear end goal, maybe stop making up my arguments for me

It has not been consistently messaged that we need to hit 6-70% vaccinated."
9062,The majority of states have no official goal metric for lifting restrictions.
9063,I want a metric-driven plan for fully lifting restrictions.
9064,"Not saying I’m agreeing with this necessarily as the target metric, but if the target metric should be 65% vaccinated, why can’t state officials just... say that and make that the official goal for fully lifting restrictions?"
9065,Why is it so absurd to ask for that and why are you defending the complete lack of a metrics-driven reopening plan in most states?
9066,Can we please get a little more specific than a wink and a nod coupled with “just hang in there til enough people are vaccinated”
9067,I don't know about that.
9068,I was scheduled to get J&amp;J.
9069,"After the pause, I was switched over to Moderna pretty seamlessly - same appt time, location, etc."
9070,I think we're starting to bump up against the threshold for our capacity to give shots given the current infrastructure.
9071,"Of course, places could add more supersites, etc., but I don't think that would have happened without the J&amp;J pause."
9072,I know what you mean but I’m less concerned about this.
9073,"Truth is, it received emergency use authorization not FDA clearance, and it isn’t mandatory, and probably never will be."
9074,It was opened up after a very shaky rollout with too much red tape much more efficiently soon after to the people who needed it most.
9075,"Nationwide the number of vaccinated people is staggering, ESPECIALLY since it’s those most at risk."
9076,And the results are pretty good.
9077,The ones remaining are younger and therefore probably healthier.
9078,Some may feel it’s not worth getting it since their risk is much lower.
9079,Some may just not care.
9080,Some may be put off by the initial roll out.
9081,These people even if they get it probably won’t be admitted to a hospital or tie up resources.
9082,"So, they just are vectors."
9083,"Hopefully, HOPEFULLY, the at risk majority is vaccinated and safe despite the younger unvaccinated ones acting as vectors."
9084,"If that happens, then we should see hospitalizations and deaths continue to trend down."
9085,"Incidence and case numbers then become less meaningful, at that point."
9086,"So, all in all, a plateau is expected, unfortunately unavoidable, but not necessarily a roadblock to progress."

9112,A few months ago i think i would've been the top comment with a lot of support.
9113,Why bother signing up for extra doses if the ones of the original contract aren't delivered in the first place?
9114,AstraZeneca should first deliver the doses it promised for both the first and the second quarter of 2021 before they get extra EU business.
9115,The same goes for Johnson and Johnson.
9116,AZ will probably not be able to deliver their promised 300M doses by the end of the year.
9117,"They already 60-70 percent behind schedule, and from next year Pfizer looks to be delivering 1.8B doses."
9118,Pfizer consistently underpromised and overdelivered on their commitments.
9119,So not exercising these options makes sense.
9120,AZ and J&amp;J will be able to focus their efforts elsewhere in the world.
9121,free weed for getting a vaccine for a respiratory virus seems like a strange flex
9122,Whatever fits your narrative guy.
9123,Btw being fully vaccinated greatly lowers the risk of catching covid it does not eliminate it.
9124,So.. have fun with that.
9125,Last I read data shows out of 80k fully vaccinated adults roughly 6k were still infected showing 90-95% effectiveness.
9126,I was joking.
9127,I don’t know if flossing prevents cavities but it gets the bits of food out of my teeth and that can’t be bad
9128,Yeah but you don't get to choose what vaccine you get.

9141,Why does it bother certain folks so much if people wear it outside?
9142,It's so weird.

9159,"It’s better to think of them in four categories:

**Nucleic acid vaccines** 

These are where messenger RNA type vaccines like Moderna, Pfizer, and the phase 3 Curevac fall."
9160,"These use genetic material (like RNA, but others in the pipeline are using DNA) to hijack cells into producing antigens... and these antigens produce an immune response."
9161,It’s completely new technology and rather costly at times but it appears to be working the best.
9162,"**Viral Vector Vaccines** 

These are what AZ, J&amp;J, and Sputnik V are."
9163,"They work the same way that the nucleic acid vaccines work (hijacking cells to produce antigens) but they use harmless, altered viruses to do it rather than RNA/DNA."
9164,These don’t seem to work as well as their mRNA counter types but are generally cheaper to produce.
9165,"**Whole virus vaccines**

This is the group that contains the inactivated virus vaccine group (Like Covaxin and CoronaVac) but also contains the weakened live virus with no replication group."
9166,"This is a tried and true method, and often has little side effects, although production and storage are a pain."
9167,"**Protein subunit vaccines**

These vaccines use just a piece of the pathogen in order to invoke immune responses."

9226,There are top scientists who believe masking after vaccination is completely unnecessary and a factor in the vaccination apathy we are seeing.
9227,"The idea that the entire scientific community believes masking post-vaccination is necessary just isn't correct, there are many who are actively speaking out against that requirement as every study we have seen from your ""experts"" points to vaccination significantly nullifying asymptomatic spread."
9228,Whatever the CDC happens to be saying at the moment is not necessarily representative of the entire scientific community nor necessarily the scientific consensus.
9229,"Again, ""experts"" is not a monolithic group and the CDC is not infallible."
9230,I mean right now they're simultaneously saying that schools only need 3 feet of distancing to be safe while also stating that any exposure withing 6 feet needs to be treated as a presumptive positive and quarantined.
9231,This is exactly why we also need behavioral scientists and sociologists weighing in on how the scientific community should be communicating to the public and shaping policy.

9243,While it's not great that there isn't as much demand it's very good that sites are now taking walk ins.
9244,A lot of people aren't opposed to getting a vaccine but aren't willing to deal with anything that isn't extremely convenient and walk ins are a big step in that direction.
9245,Plus there are also a lot of people that aren't able to schedule things in advance due to work and family commitments but can swing by a site when they get an opportunity and walk ins are way better for that situation.
9246,That's because they didn't quarantine as seriously (as an overall demographic).
9247,There literally is data on the J&amp;J's efficacy against the South African variant.
9248,It's like the most tested against it.
9249,"It was a part of their trial, and showed an efficacy of 64% against it."
9250,Is that number based on age?
9251,How do numbers compare for people in their 30's?
9252,"Try to get Pfizer if you can, seems like the symptoms are less prevalent than Moderna, but pretty much everyone feels fine after a day or two."
9253,Way way way better than catching covid.
9254,They do?

9260,"I agree with you completely, I just disagree strongly with the guy's original statement that he'd rather get COVID."
9261,I don't think any statistic on any demographic shows that risk levels of the vaccine are anywhere near that high.
9262,The deaths from Covid are in a different age group to the deaths from the vaccin.
9263,"For older people the risk would be much lower than one in 70,000."
9264,For very young people it might even be higher.
9265,I do not know the number for the UK but in the Netherlands only one woman under 35 died of Covid.
9266,Vaccinate the group of women under 35 in the Netherlands with AstraZeneca and it would result in at least 5 deaths and about 10 cases of brain damage.
9267,As an older person I do not think it is fair to sacrifice the lives and health of young people unnecessarily.
9268,There is an alternative.
9269,This is an ethical question.
9270,Young people are already having a tough time because of Covid.
9271,It really does not make that much difference to the overall result to wait a few weeks longer for alternative vaccins.
9272,I think the UK is also a bit in the grip of this ridiculous race to beat the EU with vaccination.
9273,Sending a possible surplus of AstraZeneca to countries elsewhere in the world that have a shortage would be much more helpful to get this under control worldwide than to pressurize young people in the UK into taking this particular vaccin.
9274,Same way we know the outbreak in the article happened.
9275,The news would’ve been all over it.
9276,Personally I wouldn't consider Covid a problem.
9277,"You are fully vaccinated, put that concern away."
9278,Do you have the money and time off work for this?
9279,"Now, can you go to Poland is or is a massive hassle?"
9280,"Can you fly there, if the flight connects through Amsterdam or Paris, is it a massive hassle there?"
9281,Do you have to quarantine?
9282,Is anything else open in Poland.
9283,"You are flying all the way there, take a week and go do some touristy stuff if it's open."
9284,Are restaurants and bars open?
9285,[removed]
9286,"Yeah, I know what he meant but the way he phrased it made it look like you have a “20% chance of dying from the AZ vaccine” which is straight up lying."
9287,Oh wow so you have to prove you’ve been vaccinated to get in most places?
9288,The whole thing is dumb.
9289,"We ""need"" a system of money to pay for things and we could have come to a global consensus of ""money doesn't exist right now, we need to get a handle on this bug"" and been able to have people stay home, the people that need to go do stuff would go do their stuff, and it would have spread far far slower."
9290,"But then people would have gone ""hey if we didn't need money then, why do we need it now?"""
9291,and then well...there's that.
9292,"Not to mention the people that did go to work would be all, ""Those people got to sit on their ass during this...what do I get out of this."""
9293,It's just a big mess all around.
9294,I keep envisioning something like this happening in the Star Trek universe where there's no money and everybody on the planet just going oh...okay.
9295,I work by serving people food but I should stay home so we don't spread it farther.
9296,"Or, I need to go to work to help develop a vaccine, but I'll wear a mask when I'm out because we don't exactly know how it spreads yet."
9297,"And then some redshirt dies somewhere because they ""had"" to go on an away mission."
9298,I imagine every country in the world is going to be in severe debt when this is all done...I wouldn't be surprised if there's just a global blanket wipe of debt from everybody to get the numbers down.
9299,&gt;  we now know that outdoor transmission without close contact is very rare.
9300,"Yep, they make up less than 10% of infections."
9301,"The key is that they are only needed if you are unable to stay away from people, like an outdoor party or something."
9302,"If you are reasonably able to distance, they are not needed outside."
9303,"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/)  


&gt;In a [systematic review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true) of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors."
9304,But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
9305,"&gt;  
&gt;“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said."
9306,"She added: “If you are going to a beach — which is a beautiful thing — you should avoid times when it’s crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.”"
9307,Yep
9308,They really aren't held to a higher standard than nurses.
9309,Any time something goes wrong they always run right back to their attending or point fingers.
9310,There is 0 accountability in the profession and this is coming from someone who has worked as a physician in multiple states and multiple hospital systems.
9311,I have personally seen nurses get reamed for things that they did wrong.
9312,I really don't know why you seem to believe that once you graduate with a masters degree in nursing you suddenly aren't a nurse and you become a psedodoctor.
9313,I can tell you that I spend at least 30 minutes a day correcting NPs orders that don't make sense and it clearly shows the lack of education they receive.
9314,They were intended to do the scut work of physicians and nothing else.
9315,Same.
9316,Social pressure is a helluva drug.
9317,&gt;Why am I getting downvoted?
9318,It’s the truth.

9320,"Washington state is re-instating restrictions in certain counties due to rising cases, for what that's worth."

9325,People listen to public statements by key figureheads.
9326,&gt; Dr. Fauci says now is not the time to be traveling—even if you are vaccinated.
9327,"You could still be carrying the virus in your nose, including the more transmissible variants, and spread it."
9328,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said two words that sum it up: “Don’t travel,” she told JAMA."
9329,"If you do, you could end up spreading the COVID-19 variants."
9330,"“I mean, if we learned one thing in this MMWR (that’s the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) from Minnesota, the experience with the B117 variant, several of them came from California."
9331,Their only travel was from California.
9332,"We really, really would advocate for not traveling right now.”

IIRC these were statements within the past month."
9333,No one is going to be scouring the CDC website my dude.
9334,No one is going to be attempting to reconcile the CDC website language against something that will hit the headline from Fauci or Walensky.
9335,The messaging has been very confusing and disjointed.
9336,"It's understandable that the science changes, and when it does they need to make it **very clear** to the public that it has."
9337,Ending AZ completely in the Netherlands should give a 1-2 week delay.
9338,This due to very small expected deliveries.

9345,It is amazing the number of people I personally know not getting the vaccine that say....oh if I need it to get a job or fly on a plane or go to a concert I'll get it.
9346,Jesus how self serving.
9347,12 out of 59 is 20% I believe that's what they did.
9348,You have less than a 1% chance of this happening but a 20% chance of it being fatal if it does happen.
9349,"I don't know about the numbers given, but appointments are still really, really hard to find in Indiana based on [vaccinespotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/IN/)."

9351,"In comparison, places like [Kentucky](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/KY/) have appointments available all over the state."

9361,Any chance this is related to the large uncontrolled outbreak in Ontario?
9362,Did I miss it?
9363,How do we know this vaccine is even good?
9364,Several of this family of vaccines have been abandoned for low efficacy.
9365,mRNA seems to have won the vaccine wars.
9366,Next area for competition will be the best booster to cover known variants this fall or winter.
9367,I don’t need taught but thanks so much :)
9368,How did they catch them if they were asymptomatic?
9369,Did they get tested randomly and just happened to catch it?
9370,But seriously it’s awesome that none of them had major symptoms (or any symptoms at all in this case!)
9371,Thanks!
9372,Thankfully I’m not careless in my flossing :)
9373,Part of the problem is we don't really know the exact rate by age group that these clotting problems are occurring.
9374,"A 20 something man *may* have lower chances of dying than by covid, but a 20 something woman *may* not."
9375,"I think in the next couple of weeks we may start to get a better understanding of who exactly is at risk, the hard way unfortunately."
9376,There's also the aspect of control.
9377,"Maybe both men and women have a lower chances of these clots then dying from covid, but individuals have some level of control over their risk of getting covid."
9378,"Once they take the vaccine it is a true and complete roll of the dice, and then a terrible waiting game."
9379,"There's also better chances of survival if you have covid, compared to this clotting disorder (despite the lower chances of developing the disorder)."
9380,"In the US, we have two very effective, widely available alternatives with no risk of that complication."
9381,"For us, it seems very easy for a younger person to simply wait until they can get access to an mRNA vaccine."
9382,"Considering this a developing situation, it should be treated with prudunce and caution."
9383,Only justification I can think of is that the vaccination rate is too low.
9384,You could have everyone eligible for a year but if your vax rate is like 10% or something opening up is foolish and you're just asking for a massive outbreak.
9385,If the vax rate is high and the case counts are falling there's no reason not to lift all restrictions including masks.
9386,"Apparently I really need to start using /s 

Thought the quotes would do it; I guess not."
9387,"Wait, your second dose isn’t already scheduled, even if it’s a farther date than the recommended time frame?"
9388,You get your first dose and they just send you off and say good luck finding your second dose?
9389,Or do you mean as a way to get your second dose faster?
9390,Viral vector vaccines are also pretty new.
9391,Only used for Ebola vaccines as far as I know.
9392,Because lockdowns don't prevent the spread; they just delay it.
9393,Not really.
9394,People do move in and out.
9395,Now ADX Florence is another story.
9396,That might have been the safest place in the world during the pandemic.
9397,They take social distancing to a whole new level.
9398,"&gt; During the day when I walk my dog I wear a mask and at night when its much quieter I might have it down at my chin so I can pull it up fast if need be 

That's exactly what I do."
9399,Turns out my lost filling turned into an emergency root canal today.
9400,Fun fun.
9401,All women.
9402,Curious.
9403,I am aggravated to see media types like Joy Reid saying that vaccinated people are “irrational” if they don’t wear a mask or saying that they are going  to double mask and isolate themselves even though they are fully vaccinated.
9404,Just more COVID theater that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the science especially recent studies that show vaccinated people don’t spread the virus.
9405,Exactly.
9406,There will be treatment just like with the flu.
9407,"""Take within 2 days of symptoms and lessen your covid"""
9408,He's just an anti vaxer looking for a valid excuse.
9409,"3 months comes from NY, who put out something a while back that said you didn't have to do travel quarantine if you were in 3 months of getting the vaccine."
9410,"These states, like NY that put out insanely over cautious guidelines, really are doing harm by feeding the bullshit like this."
9411,"But don't worry, even if you managed to convince him that almost all scientists think that the vaccine will last years, he'll fall back onto the ""it's not fully approved by the FDA""."
9412,"And when it does get fully approved by the FDA, he'll say the side effects aren't worth it or find some other excuse."
9413,It's cumulative.
9414,"If you spend all day around other people, even if it is different people, it can add up."
9415,"Yes, it is much safer than the same thing but indoors."
9416,"But if you live in a really crowded place, it makes sense to have a mask on."
9417,It's not like it's some big burden anyway.
9418,"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0402-travel-guidance-vaccinated-people.html

""CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk to themselves""


I really feel like a lot of this "" but the guidance isn't showing any optimism"" baloney is because people don't bother to actually read the guidances..."
9419,The US does have an export ban.
9420,We have very little idea of what is happening with the ingredients beyond knowing they're not exported.
9421,Yeah because scary news articles gets more clicks.
9422,"This tipping point was always expected around now, when vaccine outreach would be more important because we had enough supply."
9423,It ends when we have successfully suppressed Covid.
9424,Don't kid yourself otherwise.
9425,The study was small &amp; limited but it's not the only study.
9426,"Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, UK was involved in a different study."
9427,"&gt;Conclusions A two-dose regimen of ChAdOx1-nCoV19 did not show protection against mild-moderate Covid-19 due to B.1.351 variant, however, VE against severe Covid-19 is undetermined."

9429,Exactly.!
9430,So Tuesday is higher than the rest of the week.
9431,"From my understanding, Whitmers hands are literally tied because she was stripped of the authority to make public health rules by the legislature."
9432,"Then she was using the health department to do the orders after that, and the head was fired and replaced by the legislature and now they won’t use their authority to make any rules."
9433,"So yeah, I don’t really know what you want her to do."
9434,She’s lost all power concerning COVID.
9435,Lol ok.
9436,"Ohhh, what a burn from someone who can’t even spell “irrelevant”."
9437,You still have a higher chance of getting a blood clot from Covid with only 1 shot of the AZ vaccine than getting a blood clot from the AZ vaccine itself.
9438,The problem is that there are still numerous restrictions in place that limit both social activity and travel.
9439,"The risk for a vaccinated person just isn't the same as an unvaccinated person, including the risk of credibly spreading it to others."
9440,I have been able to help assess my risks far more properly after reading up on the research and plan accordingly.
9441,"I say this as someone wearing a KN95 in an airport,  fully vaccinated as I type this."
9442,"Getting my shot helped me remove some restrictions, but too few people are willing to be honest about these differences to help encourage the uptake."
9443,"If we don't start pushing this message quickly, we won't hit the threshold needed to save the most lives in time."
9444,Problem with India is it's large population.
9445,I honestly don't know how we are going to stop the spread there.
9446,They need so much resources.
9447,It's insane.
9448,Sending vibes
9449,"For most of my family it was about 2 weeks of feeling ill, but 4 weeks for me."
9450,"I can't make any guarantees because I don't know you, or your age."
9451,"I hope you have a mild case, and get better soon!"
9452,"The article sheds light on how little spread is outdoors, and says it’s been known for a year (as many of us on here have known)."
9453,So *why* the theatrical mandates?
9454,Ridiculous.
9455,EU export vaccine not because they love people of the world.
9456,It is strategy to attracts vaccine manufacturers.
9457,"Russia, China, India exports vaccine for geopolitical reasons, they are true bullies here."
9458,"Well, the country recently allowed for some massive religious gatherings and celebrations, which didn’t help any matters."
9459,"And they never really avoided an outbreak of Covid, the start of the year India had 10 million “confirmed” Covid cases, and we all know how dubious official cases can be."
9460,"They did however keep their healthcare system relatively in check, but now that is starting to fall apart."
9461,"Really, India needed/needs more vaccines, thats the best way to mitigate the spread of the virus long term."
9462,"If you are in San Francisco during a workday, then you ARE in a mass gathering."
9463,It's impossible to distance.
9464,"What's happening in India right now will give you an idea of how the pandemic would 'end' if we (in the West) didn't have vaccines, and were not rich enough to physically distance ourselves."
9465,"But keep in mind that herd immunity is both parts, the people that got vaccinated and the people that got sick."
9466,If we only get 70% of people vaccinated an 85% herd immunity will still be reached when half of the remainder have gotten the illness and retained sufficient antibodies.
9467,"For official border crossing needs, I wonder if they couldn't require all US crossers to show proof of vaccination, or an antibody test showing past infection."
9468,"By now that's got to  be over half the country, so it shouldn't be impossible to locate safe truck drivers etc."
9469,As far as locals leaking back and forth across the border...I doubt they can do much about that.
9470,What?
9471,The U.S. doesn’t have enough vaccines stockpiled to vaccinate the whole country.
9472,Why do people think this?
9473,There have been somewhere around 270m vaccines shipped with 213m (plus likely a bit more) already administered.
9474,&gt; Not sure if it's something different with these shots vs the flu shot or just nurses doing them all day so they are good at.
9475,It's definitely the nurses being good at it.
9476,"My first shot I didn't feel the needle at all, but the second shot the nurse was definitely less skilled and i felt it go in at a little bit of an angle, so it stung a bit more."
9477,I had a bit of mental fog and kind of a body high type feeling but nothing else.
9478,"1st shot was worse for me, but still totally manageable."
9479,It's a start.
9480,But here I am a fully vaccinated under 40 pooping bricks thinking about getting on an airplane this summer for the first time in nearly two years.
9481,The CDC reassuring me would help morally.
9482,"We'll need therapy for our PTSD as well to ""get back to normal""."
9483,Yeah I remember that though it was for mRNA vaccine production.
9484,Mathematicians have to invent a new function to describe the number of cases in India
9485,\+1.
9486,The only ones in my family who had shot #1 side effects were the cousins who already had covid.
9487,That number is the risk of getting a blood clot.
9488,"The risk of dying of one is much, much lower (especially now that doctors are watching for it), and nearly all of those deaths also occurred in older people."
9489,"We also have no firm grasp on the long-term impacts of having COVID while young, whereas the long-term effects of having a blood clot that resolved itself are basically nil."
9490,thanks!
9491,added
9492,This is a good point.
9493,Walking around the middle of San Francisco in the middle of the day means that you will constantly be near people.
9494,It's much different than being out on a lonely hiking trail in the mountains.
9495,"&gt;There's no consensus on when a pandemic ends, but it does end."
9496,"everything ends eventually, so that is a meaningless statement."
9497,"So, we have to be careful using the word “live” with “virus”."
9498,"“Live” with reference to a virus means that it’s capable of replicating, like your electrical socket is “live”."
9499,"Virus are not, themselves *alive* or *dead*, they are *live* or *inactivate*."
9500,"We also use the term “killed” to distinguish from “attenuated” viruses, which *are* live but can no longer infect you (but might still infect something else), or can no longer reproduce effectively."
9501,"Types of vaccines I can think of off-hand are:
* mRNA
   * Messenger RNA that codes for spike protein riding on fatty acids get delivered to cells at the injection site, they produce this protein so your immune system freaks out and starts attacking it; this means it will attack those *specific* spike proteins in the future, including on viruses
* Vector viruses
   * Adenoviruses are the ones we use; they deliver DNA to cells to make them produce the spike protein, similar net result to mRNA
* Attenuated organism
   * These are viruses that are not “killed”, but have been deliberately mutated or denatured to become largely harmless, unable to infect you, etc."
9502,"; the equivalent of tying up a hostile enemy and using them for target practice
* “Killed” vaccine
   * These are viruses that were once “live” (active) but deactivated, so they can no longer infect cells; if attenuated vaccines are tying up an enemy combatant and using them for target practice, then this is rounding up dead enemy combatants and using their *corpses* for target practice
* Conjugate vaccines
   * These Are vaccines that don’t contain viruses/bacteria, but instead use something they use – following the enemy combatant simile, this would be like dressing up a dummy with actual clothes/armor/whatever from enemy combatants and using it for target practice
* Toxoid vaccines
   * Contains the dangerous toxins produced of the organism, allowing your body’s immune system to target that, so that if you get infected, it renders the organism itself harmless; think Princess Bride and the poisoned goblets, or someone who has survived many poisonous bites not being harmed (or as harmed) by those bites as time goes on

Currently, Pfizer and Moderna are type 1, J&amp;J and AZ are type 2, Covaxin is type 4."
9503,"Attenuated organisms have usually been the most effective vaccines, IIRC, but it’s looking like mRNA might take the cake."
9504,"It will take a lot of different trials, applications, types, and diseases to see how well vector vaccines stack up outside of COVID."
9505,"As far as these vaccines go, only Covaxin is “old school”."
9506,"AZ and J&amp;J use vector vaccines, which have been studied for a while (particularly vs. HIV), but only actually approved for use once before (vs. Ebola)."
9507,"Really glad to see mRNA working well, and hope we’ll see more applications of this biotech in the future."
9508,"Some general information on the distinction re: live/alive:

A virus falls in about two categories:
* Genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (capsid)
* Genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) and a partial or complete layer of lipids/fatty acids (envelope)

Genetic material can be DNA or RNA, depends on the virus."
9509,That’s it.
9510,"There’s no “life” to them, they aren’t actually alive – there’s no activity until they bang up against a cell that they can infect, and then they inject their genetic material into the cell, which then overrides cell function (immediately or at some future point in time, e.g."
9511,HIV reservoir cells) and makes it begin producing new viruses.
9512,"Honestly, the best comparison IMHO is that they’re basically little robots, built out of DNA/RNA and proteins – occasionally wearing the skins of their victims, too, since that’s what the lipid envelope is from (cell membrane when the host cell ruptures to release the virus)."
9513,Need at least another 2 months.
9514,We’ll get there.
9515,"Well there certainly is a way to tell, we just don't have access to it."
9516,"The states have this information and passports could be created, but won't because of various reasons."
9517,"That said the ""safest"" thing may or may not be the ""safest"" long term."
9518,"If you incentivize people enough, you might end up with a much higher vaccine uptake mid term."
9519,You really need to know your audience.
9520,They got better!
9521,I just got my 2nd shot!
9522,Yay!
9523,"Its weird that I felt the first one but this one I didn't even know she got me :)

I had a very mild first dose, so I hope I have a mild second dose, even though I already had covid."
9524,I have a situation that I don't know how worried I should be about it.
9525,I spent all weekend with out of town friends &amp; family (everyone fully vaxed or one shot in).
9526,"I found out yesterday that my friend's (two weeks post dose 1 pfizer) boss is postive, even though the boss was fully vaccinated."
9527,It's a small company &amp; they don't wear masks in the office.
9528,"My friend was around her boss Wednesday - Friday, then with us all weekend."
9529,"My gut reaction is that the odds are low that my friend was infected by her boss at all and even lower that if my friend tests positive, she wasn't infectious over the weekend."
9530,"Wow, I just got an appt for tomorrow thru walmart."
9531,"Wtf, thank u so much /u/zaidswith"
9532,"From what I read, the US doesn’t even have enough bags."
9533,Our facilities have started reusing what are supposed to be single use materials.
9534,thanks so much!
9535,added :)
9536,&gt;Never heard of compulsory travel vaccination?
9537,It’s not new.
9538,Of course.
9539,"I've had the Yellow Fever, Hep B and many other vaccines because of it."
9540,There's a huge difference between that and requiring annual vaccinations though.
9541,"Like I said, we'll be lucky to get to 80% now."
9542,We're not going to convince 80% of people to get the vaccine every year.
9543,Not sure your point on smallpox.
9544,I haven't had a smallpox vaccine (despite traveling to the developing world) and I suspect you haven't either.
9545,"The smallpox virus doesn't mutate quickly, so we were able to eradicate it."
9546,"Makes sense, I agree."
9547,The US needs to use its wealth to help the rest of the world vaccinate or we're all going to have to keep dealing with this forever.
9548,Love that.
9549,I'm getting Moderna #2 on Friday and I'm lowkey nervous about side effects.
9550,"(not enough to make me not get it of course, not by a mile, but nevertheless)"
9551,"WI, ND, SD, MT, NE, IA, IL, OH, IN, WY, ID...northern states with similar or worse climates to MI, all doing much better according to the map in the article."
9552,"For that matter you could include other states where climate is still such that heading south is appealing to many in the spring (KY, WV, MO, etc.)"
9553,"Spring travel could be a factor, but it's hard to say whether it's a main factor or even a significant one without more detailed data."
9554,Take a moment and put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't live in an uber-wealthy first world country.
9555,"And then remember that if everyone in Germany got Pfizer/Moderna and AZ and J&amp;J remained on the shelf, there would still be a pandemic raging elsewhere, and a variant from which that can avoid the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine will arrive with absolute inevitability."
9556,2nd dose of Pfizer in.
9557,I still can't get over how I didn't feel the needle at all.
9558,Not sure if it's something different with these shots vs the flu shot or just nurses doing them all day so they are good at.
9559,"Final ""just wait 2 more weeks"" for me"
9560,All those political rallies hosted by our very own Prime Minister and Home Minister paying off.
9561,"For me, it was pretty crummy, but far from ""terrible"" or anything."
9562,"E.g., not nearly as bad as flus I've had and if I recall only lasted night of and the day after."
9563,Woke up the next day feeling fine.
9564,Can't compare a island nation with a population no bigger than a metro area to  Europe or North America.
9565,No it is not true.
9566,"Ah, so we are in agreement then."
9567,I misread your statement as the USA would be at fault.
9568,India too?
9569,"Was not ""reported"" as higher."
9570,Yes the U.K. has approved them but Monocolonial antibodies are very expensive to produce so I highly doubt everyone that tests positive in the U.S. receives this treatment.
9571,"In contrast, these pills are intended to be sent to anyone with a positive test in the U.K. Also not requiring a hospital visit to administer a treatment is a huge deal."
9572,Wish we’d do the same in Germany
9573,I feel like COVID exposed the weaknesses of Western nations' roots in classical liberalism and individualism as far as social cohesion battling a common threat.
9574,Then again we are also a long way since the Battle of Britain where it took collective effort for everyone to turn their fucking lights off at night.
9575,Is that really that hard to turn the fucking lights off so Jerry doesn't kill your neighbours --- er wear a mask?
9576,"I think it's been a combination of the influences of classical liberalism, accelerating political polarization, and the internet providing a safe space for every opinion rather than broadcasting the scientific or societal consensus."
9577,"When this began, my friend  at Walgreens was told that she cannot wear a mask at work because it gave a bad image."
9578,"""If you wear a mask people will think you are sick and vulnerable and they may not shop here."""
9579,"It's been like watching how on your first date with someone they react and treat someone 
 like a server in a restaurant, in a year in slow motion."
9580,"What a litmus test for my friend group, holy fuck."
9581,My thoughts go in the same direction.
9582,AZ sold these vaccines to the US and the US can’t unilaterally gift or resell them.
9583,That means AZ essentially gets to take a second bite at the apple and sell them again.
9584,"Maybe the US wants other countries to reimburse whatever they paid initially, and perhaps AZ also wants an additional payment."
9585,This is a sensitive three-way negotiation that could lead to some ugly headlines.
9586,what
9587,"Oh, it is most definitely virtue signaling."
9588,"These well off, left leaning privileged people love wearing their masks out in public while giving looks of disapproval to those of us who do not wear masks outdoors."
9589,"Wow that was pretty epic, +1 reddit gold for that zinger you subzero iq neanderthal"
9590,My resentment has moved past those people on to those who think we need to tighten up restrictions even after vaccines.
9591,"That’s the whole point of a vaccine, to get back to normal."
9592,Research in every field?
9593,Sounds like you need to do some research yourself.
9594,"&gt;Because being vaccinated means you have to keep wearing a mask, keep distancing, and keep dealing with all the restrictions."
9595,"I hear this all the time but either way, you're still up against the same health restrictions."
9596,"Skipping the shot doesnt invalidate the guidelines, so it's a sort of pointless rebellion in that light."
9597,The incentive for getting the shot is that the planet returns to the way it was that much sooner.
9598,"I'm elated that the US has seen a major reversal of its covid trend, but many other places are still in the thick of it with a long road ahead."
9599,"Sure, but that would imply that both parties only want to change the one part about distribution reason."
9600,"Since you already started guessing, here's my attempt at explaining why AZ might be at fault:

Since the negotiations (in my current understanding) are held in secret, we have to guess about their current state, but what if AZ wants more money in a changed contract, because their EU deals aren't getting extended and they're holding the destribution clause hostage?"
9601,That's good.
9602,I do wish its efficacy is better.
9603,Massachusetts requires one at all times outdoors.
9604,"Even if you’re going to grab your mail... obviously no one goes that extreme, but I’ve witnessed more people than not walking alone with no one around while wearing a mask."
9605,I chalk that up to the equivalent of wearing one in the car when alone.
9606,"&gt;SCIENTISTS AT Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), at the forefront of sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, will culture the double mutant strain B.1.617 and other variants of concern and check if antibodies of vaccinated or recovered persons can neutralise the virus."
9607,"“It will take at least 10 days for the process,” Dr Rakesh Mishra, director of CCMB, told The Indian Express."
9608,"&gt;Dr Mishra said this was not a population study, so if someone’s antibodies were put in cell culture and the virus was unable to infect it, it would mean the vaccine had worked."
9609,This exercise was particularly significant as India opens vaccination to all aged 18 and above from May 1.
9610,"&gt;According to a report from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Tuesday, from 20,000 cases reported on January 1, the country has reported almost 10 times the number of cases (over two lakh) daily since April 15."
9611,"&gt;Dr Mishra said whichever variant was there in any state, the spread depended on lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour."
9612,"But if there were multiple variants in a location, the one which spread more would become more dominant and, so among existing variants in Maharashtra, the double mutation — E484Q and L452R — was more efficient, he said."
9613,"snip

&gt;“We are monitoring how much this variant is spreading and are in the process of collecting 5 per cent samples from each state to see which is doing worse or better in any of these places."
9614,"It may or may not be dangerous, but if it is spreading fast then that itself is a bad sign; so it needs to be urgently contained as we do not want a dangerous version of the virus,” he said."
9615,"&gt;Dr Mishra further said scientists were also monitoring hospital deaths due to a particular variant and, hence, it was important to culture these variants."
9616,"“Testing vaccinated people’s sera and those who have had the infection will help us understand if it prevents the growth of the virus,” he added."
9617,The borders of countries should be closed and travel very limited in a pandemic.
9618,Don't expect much.
9619,"  ""not willing to stop their lives forever""

You mean the ones that didn't die."
9620,It’s likely the export ban will be removed soon when they realise India needs vaccine materials and will run out very soon.
9621,Otherwise the US will have killed a lot of people.
9622,Not sure tbh.
9623,Had my 28 day check in and they mentioned they are struggling to get more trialists due to the big drop in cases here in the UK.
9624,They may have to look at European or other countries to extend the trial.
9625,And yet people are still pissing and moaning it isn't over fast enough.
9626,"I'm not going to lie, I'm nervous about getting the vaccine."
9627,"I'm not an anti-vaxx guy, nor am I attempting to persuade others to not get it."
9628,I'm 110% going to get it next month.
9629,I'm just nervous because of the side effects people are having from it.
9630,"My unnecessary fear is that when I get the vaccine, I'll be one of those rare cases of death."
9631,:(
9632,Came here to say this.
9633,New Zealand is not the only country either.
9634,And its now we have variants and tons of deaths we wouldn't have had otherwise.
9635,The idea of responsibly handling the virus and business and economy still running/mental health are not mutually exclusive.
9636,They are on the same side.
9637,Countries that handled it better and cooperated had better economies and less mental health issues and much less deaths.
9638,Deaths are a trailing metric and also don’t consider complications (like COVID long haulers).
9639,Why would the CDC withhold that information though regardless if it’s hard to enforce?
9640,Their messaging has been terrible and if they would harp on a return to normalcy as the reason for vaccination it would be a lot more effective.
9641,Probably in bed icing that massive injury to his already diminutive credibility.
9642,I do not miss that pompous face of his.
9643,"So, two points:

**One:** Yes, I agree, *but* I always find this kind of argument somewhat short-sighted, insofar that it views it in a vacuum."
9644,"The “problem” with “reducing SEVERE COVID down to a mild/asymptomatic infection” is that it **definitely** saves lives right now, it *may* reduce spread, but it also creates an environment where dangerous mutations are selected for – it doesn’t take very many people who are vaccinated, get infected, **AND** develop a mutated strain that evades the current immune defense built by current vaccines to reboot this entire pandemic back to day one."
9645,"Note, I emphasize “and” there because all three need to occur together, and by reducing spread via any percentage of the population having immunity we mitigate (but not remove) the risk of this, but yeah: the more people who are vaccinated (who also have an immune response) and still get infected *does* create an environment that selects for strains that can evade the immune system’s current antibodies."
9646,"Meaning, if someone has COVID and in their body it randomly mutates on the spike protein that most (all?)"
9647,of these vaccines target – and does so in such a way that it is largely ignored by the antibodies the vaccines produce – we’re back at square one.
9648,"Well, square one and a half or so, since we know Pfizer and Moderna are highly effective and it just becomes a matter of swapping out the mRNA for another that codes for this new protein."
9649,"Mind, 70% total immunity and 100% protection vs. severe immunity is a metric **fuck ton** better than nothing, but the better vaccines are at preventing *any* infection, the more effective they are at mitigating the risk of strains that evade the immune defenses."
9650,"**Two:** And therein lies the rub, one hinted at in your claim, too (emphasis mine): “if you catch COVID *but don’t have a chance to transmit it* AND you don’t die we’re going to lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.”

That requires a lot more self-control than most people have."
9651,"Nobody is going to know if they have a mild cold or a mild case of COVID, and while we don’t know if someone who has a mild case and is vaccinated (with immune response) can *definitely* spread it (or that they *cannot* spread it), it seems likely they can (infection implies the virus is replicating in their system)."
9652,"After the horrific social experiment we’ve seen play out over the last year and change, dollars to donuts, **many** people aren’t going to stay home over mild sniffles and a cough – a lesson we learned *without* a vaccine, never mind the belief that they have immunity *with* a vaccine."
9653,And that’s the shit that scares me still.
9654,"I’ve definitely been fucked up by all the isolation and stress from the last year, and I’ll be dealing with that for a while, but I can’t escape this impending dread that the combination of: vaccines which are less effective at preventing any COVID infection, and people giving up entirely on being cautious when they have symptoms, will put us back months to a year in dealing with this."
9655,Typical main stream media.
9656,"The headline touts great progress on daily vax rate, and then they include a graph that shows the rate has taken a significant nose dive for the last week."
9657,No point in mentioning facts that counter your message.
9658,Curious how this decline coincides with opening of the entire country to everyone for eligibility.
9659,You'd think that would make the rate climb higher.
9660,Hopefully it's just a fluke and will spring back to a positive slope like it did after that big winter storm.
9661,There's already 100 million aquired doses to be delivered until September.
9662,THIS!!!
9663,I guarantee you it happens around April 30.
9664,That’s when the first 100 days of the administration are done.
9665,They already paved the way in the most recent briefing by trumpeting how effective the vaccines are.
9666,The Overly Cautious tone will transition to where it becomes cool to relax restrictions since 1.
9667,The first 100 days will be over and 2.
9668,"Cases will be in decline (they already are starting) due to 50% of adults with the first dose/natural immunity/seasonality (also Michigan peaked, so that helps)."
9669,Jesus Christ.
9670,Did you know that drinking water isn’t 100% risk free either?
9671,Same goes for absolutely everything.
9672,Your fear is a phobia.
9673,Seek therapy.
9674,"It's not enforced at all though, I jog around my neighborhood most days, never wear a mask, and no one has said or done anything to me about it."
9675,"I just have to remind myself that this will one day end, in one way or another."
9676,"Somedays I see the falling amount of vaccine demand and think, will this thing ever fucking end?"
9677,So thanks for reminding me that it will eventually.
9678,But does that outweigh the benefit of being vaccinated?
9679,You’re not looking at the bigger picture.
9680,"To take this to the extreme, let’s just cancel all doses of AZ and wait for the supply chain of MRNA alternatives to ramp up."
9681,Walk me through the math of this please.
9682,What’s your prediction model in either scenario?
9683,You say this like most people have actually started doing these things.
9684,In my area it seems like no one is even aware there is a pandemic happening.
9685,"Someone said it's not in the spike protein , so vaccine will work ."
9686,"I'm somewhere in this camp, but slowly leaving it."
9687,"I'm fully vaccinated as of tomorrow, but I've been wearing masks outside and keeping my space from people who aren't for over a year now."
9688,"It's a tough habit to shake, but I know I'll get over this over the next weeks/months because I know intellectually that it's silly."
9689,It's the emotions/anxiety that make it tough.
9690,Hopefully we can all have some compassion as people fade out of this at their own speed.
9691,It is intentional for sure
9692,It's still a big problem on media channels.
9693,"[Here's the brain trust at CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/21/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html) telling us that the supply/demand tipping point is super concerning, and then if you keep scrolling down you're hit with the next article, which is about how you shouldn't change your behavior after the vaccine."
9694,Dude said 100 days of masking.
9695,I think it'd be smart to mark 100 days with reduced restrictions and benchmarks for further eliminating restrictions.
9696,FOLLOW THE LEAD PHILLY
9697,"No one is asking for American vaccines, they're asking America to allow private companies to fill existing paid orders, instead of their de facto export ban which they only get away with because they're the biggest and richest kid on the block."
9698,Except its not quite true.
9699,CDC has said if you are fully vaccinated you can gather with other fully vaccinated people.
9700,You also dont need to quarantine if exposed to an infected person.
9701,Those are two big changes there that they announced like over a month ago.
9702,Got my second Moderna shot today!
9703,My local pharmacy has really streamlined their process between my first one and today.
9704,"It took 45 minutes for me to get my first shot, and that was with no one in front of me in line."
9705,"Today took all of 20 minutes, including my observation period."

The Safer COVID-19 Response checklist has been produced for managers of health-care services, individual practitioners and health policymakers worried about the impact of violence against health-care workers, facilities and patients during the COVID-19 response."
9709,"It provides a practical, actionable summary of important measures for preventing, reducing and mitigating the effects of violence against health-care workers and patients during the COVID-19 response."
9710,It also contains a series of online references to help understand and implement these measures.
9711,"This checklist aims to encourage local risk assessment, informed response measures and accountability and transparency towards those receiving care as a means of preventing violence against health-care workers and services."
9712,We aim to protect health-care workers’ well-being and ensure that they apply the ethical principles of health care.
9713,I'm not saying the US doesn't need to help everyone else as soon as we're vaccinated but 1.
9714,We have millions of people who want a vaccine and haven't been given one... vaccines were only opened to the general population this week and 2.
9715,Of course we're going to vaccinate our own population and with our production capabilities and human being president I think we're gonna help others when we can... someone else linked an article out if Italy saying the US and Belgium are the only nations supplying them with AZ vaccines so it's not like we're not already helping......
9716,Do you have anything you can cite to support that?
9717,Countries that had stronger lock down and mitigation efforts controlled the pandemic.
9718,China locked down hard and life has been normal there for a long time now.
9719,"If people had uniformly locked down and we had done adequate testing and contact tracing at the end of the lockdown and quarantined all exposures, the experience in other countries suggests we could have lessened the impact greatly."
9720,We could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives with universal masking even.
9721,"Situation is horrible, as the public healthcare is demolished systematically, over last 2-3 decades, to promote the private operators, and the government's astronomical inefficiency!"

9727,"full article:

&gt; Pfizer Inc. says it has identified in Mexico and Poland the first confirmed instances of counterfeit versions of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with BioNTech SE, the latest attempt by criminals trying to exploit the world-wide vaccination campaign."
9728,&gt; Vials seized by authorities in separate investigations were tested by the company and confirmed to contain bogus vaccine.
9729,"The vials recovered in Mexico also had fraudulent labeling, while a substance inside vials in Poland was likely an anti-wrinkle treatment, Pfizer said."
9730,"&gt; About 80 people at a clinic in Mexico received a fake vaccine going for about $1,000 a dose, though they don’t appear to have been physically harmed."
9731,"The vials, found in beach-style beer coolers, had different lot numbers than those sent to the state, and a wrong expiration date, said Dr. Manuel de la O, the health secretary of Nuevo León state."
9732,"&gt; Polish authorities said no one there had received the counterfeit vaccine, which was seized at a man’s apartment."
9733,"&gt; The findings are the latest in an effort between law enforcement and drugmakers such as Pfizer, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson to stem criminal activity related to the Covid-19 vaccines."
9734,The global rollout of shots has provided criminals a fresh opportunity to take advantage of unsuspecting people.
9735,&gt; “Everybody on the planet needs it.
9736,"Many are desperate for it,” said Lev Kubiak, Pfizer’s world head of security."
9737,"“We have a very limited supply, a supply that will increase as we ramp up and other companies enter the vaccine space."
9738,"In the interim, there is a perfect opportunity for criminals.”

&gt; The U.S., Mexico and other countries have seized and taken down dozens of websites fraudulently claiming to sell shots or an affiliation with vaccine makers such as Moderna and Pfizer, according to government officials and records."
9739,"The fake, company look-alike websites appeared to be seeking consumers’ personal information to be used in identity-fraud schemes, government and industry officials say."
9740,"&gt; Police in China and South Africa last month seized thousands of doses of counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines in warehouses and manufacturing plants, arresting dozens of people, according to the international police agency Interpol."
9741,"Mexico also is investigating a shipment of some 6,000 doses of purported Sputnik vaccine from Russia, which were seized from a private plane headed to Honduras."
9742,Authorities haven’t determined whether the vaccines are genuine.
9743,"&gt; For months, agents from the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, an investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have been investigating fraud related to the Covid-19 pandemic globally, recovering $48 million worth of phony masks, personal protective equipment and other products."
9744,"Last fall, investigators shifted their focus to include Covid-19 vaccines that were nearing potential clearance by regulators, beginning with online scams."
9745,"They have removed 30 websites and seized 74 web domains, according to IPR officials."
9746,"&gt; So far, no counterfeit vaccines have been discovered in the U.S., according to the DHS."
9747,"But limited supply of Covid-19 shots and their high demand can steer people to seek vaccinations outside official channels, particularly in countries such as Mexico and Brazil, where Covid-19 cases are high and there is a history of counterfeiting prescription drugs, industry and security experts said."
9748,"&gt; “Whenever you see this mismatch between demand and supply in certain areas, there are people who are willing to fill that difference with counterfeits,” said Tony Pelli, a consultant with BSI Group who focuses on drug security."
9749,"“For new drugs, it’s usually just a matter of time before you see people trying to counterfeit them.”

&gt; Counterfeiting prescription drugs has grown more lucrative in the past decade, industry and security officials say."
9750,"The counterfeit prescription drug market is valued at more than $200 billion annually, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers."
9751,"&gt; Distributing fake Covid-19 vaccines also is easier than stealing and selling legitimate shots because of extreme security measures taken by countries and drugmakers during the pandemic, said Mr. Pelli."
9752,"“With counterfeits, you kind of can just show up, and say, ‘Here’s Covid vaccines, we’ve got some, don’t ask how,’ and start distributing them,” Mr. Pelli said."
9753,&gt; Big drugmakers such as Pfizer employ security teams consisting of former law-enforcement officials who help train government agencies and help with investigations related to counterfeit prescription drugs.
9754,Pfizer in recent years worked with law enforcement to find sellers of fake doses of erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra and antianxiety drug Xanax.
9755,&gt; One tactic used by IPR Center agents is searching the clear and dark web with keywords related to vaccines provided by their manufacturers.
9756,"&gt; “We’ve never seen so much fraud and misinformation and schemes,” said Steve Francis, director of the IPR Center, which has opened more than 35 cases related to Covid-19 vaccine scams."
9757,&gt; Mr. Francis’s agents and Pfizer began meeting weekly last fall to prepare for scams and counterfeiting.
9758,"During one presentation, company officials said they didn’t initially release images of the vial’s authentic labels partly as a means of staying ahead of criminals."
9759,&gt; Pfizer is also working with local law enforcement on counterfeit-vaccine cases like those recently uncovered in Mexico and Poland.
9760,"&gt; Polish police in January seized a number of vials filled with a liquid and labeled as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from a man’s apartment, according to Pfizer and Polish authorities."
9761,"No one is believed to have received a fake shot, according to Polish prosecutors leading the investigation."
9762,"Polish police arrested the man, who has been charged with fraud, Polish authorities said."
9763,"&gt; Pfizer suspected the vaccines were fake because they weren’t in the vials the company uses for its Covid-19 shot, Mr. Kubiak said."
9764,They were identical to containers police recovered in the man’s apartment that had a label for another company’s anti-wrinkle treatment.
9765,"&gt; Pfizer tested the liquid in the vials purported to be its Covid-19 vaccine at its laboratory in Groton, Conn., finding it lacked key ingredients and instead contained hyaluronic acid, which is used in skin products."
9766,"&gt; In early February, Mexican police raided a clinic in the northern state of Nuevo León, where alleged fake vaccines were administered to people."

9768,"&gt; “People were injected with distilled water,” said Dr. de la O in a telephone interview."
9769,"A spokesman for Mexico’s attorney general’s office, which is carrying out the investigation, declined to comment."
9770,"&gt; Pfizer, which is working with DHS officials to support Mexican authorities on the case, confirmed the vaccine was fake after using special light and microscopic analysis to find the adhesive label on the vial wasn’t authentic."
9771,Mr. Kubiak declined to provide additional details but said Pfizer may conduct more tests on the liquid.

9777,"This last year has certainly exposed some fundamental problems in our economic system, that's for sure."
9778,I don't think you understand the significance of testing numbers.
9779,Lack of testing in Texas is actually an indicator than there are not many people who \*believe\* they have Covid and need to get tested.
9780,Just arbitrarily testing people is an inane practice that provides no good other than to boost testing numbers and lower your positive rate without meaning.
9781,Texas is still testing about \~60k a day with a 5% positive rate.
9782,It might be an ethical thing.
9783,Just making sure everyone gets the vaccine without even creating the appearance of data corruption from lack of blindness.
9784,"Like I said, for better or for worse."
9785,But the fact remains.
9786,You’re comparing a lifetime risk with a risk within an unspecified time period.
9787,Where’s the risk of passing Covid on to my kid who can’t get vaccinated yet or my immunocompromised family?
9788,Last year I read about [this 'group' who made a DIY coronavirus vaccine ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/29/1005720/george-church-diy-coronavirus-vaccine/) and I was wondering if anyone had seen an update as to how well it worked?
9789,I know this is a wierd question.
9790,I'm not seeking to use this vaccine (Vaccinated already) I Just am truly curious how it worked out for them.
9791,"well, you're welcome Canada, we are glad we can share."
9792,I'm not even worried about hesitancy at this point.
9793,I'm worried about apathy.
9794,The people who aren't at any sort of serious risk and don't want to put in the effort of scheduling two appointments and driving or getting a ride to *somewhere* to get a vaccine.
9795,Why would they?
9796,"They'll still be told to wear a mask and keep their distance, and they still won't be able to have normal lives."
9797,They'll just be told that the virus that had a profoundly small chance of harming them now has an even smaller chance of harming them.
9798,"The government needs to start addressing apathy directly with something better than ""Do as you're told."""
9799,We have the doses.
9800,They're free.
9801,They're in pharmacies.
9802,"The issue is people not caring very much, and even something as small as saying ""There's no medical reason for vaccinated people to wear a mask"" would go a long way."
9803,"Obviously there would be people who lie about being vaccinated, but God damn, I simply do not care at all."
9804,"I get the sense that most people who are willing to *lie* to avoid vaccination are either never getting vaccinated or have already been infected- Probably both in a lot of cases  Within a few weeks most adults will be fully vaccinated, and the CDC has said vaccination dramatically reduces any chance of spreading the virus."
9805,We're approaching the point where a majority of people have no medical reason to wear a mask.
9806,"Basing policy and messaging around that would go a long way to combat the ""Why should I bother"" attitude that's predictably become very common."
9807,I have not had either a first dose or a 2nd dose.
9808,"I can find open 1st dose appointments, but they wont let me confirm the date without a 2nd dose date appointment, which I can't find any of."
9809,"I live in Phoenix, so theres tons of ppl trying to get their shots."
9810,"Frys, Walgreens and Keoger are all booked for 2 months."
9811,I havent tried Walmart because I figured it would be the same story.
9812,"I work from home so it's not a huge deal, I'd just like to be able to get vaccinated, but I'm sure I will by summer time."
9813,Good that people are willing to get a vaccine
9814,"Hmm, the article points out variants pop up in average people too:

9835,"It is completely incorrect to say that ""your chance of getting COVID is .04%""."
9836,"First, the data you're citing is very incomplete."
9837,The CDC's breakthrough data is very incomplete because it requires voluntary reporting.
9838,It is only starting to be industrialized at testing centers and testing data.
9839,"Secondly, this is a timebound risk (which efficacy *is not*)."
9840,Every day that passes (while case load exists) will increase the number of people infected.
9841,An individual's chance of getting infected is still dependent upon exposure risk.
9842,If my non-vaccinated exposure risk for the month was 10% (i.e.
9843,"I had a 10% chance of catching COVID before), then the vaccines lower your absolute risk of experiencing symptoms to .5-1%."
9844,"It is *safer* to be in a highly vaccinated, low case load population unvaccinated than to be vaccinated in a high exposure risk area."
9845,"For example, if you are vaccinated in measles but are in a low measles vaccination community, you are more likely to get measles than an unvaccinated person who lives in an area with high vaccination."

9937,The accident happened at a hospital in the western state of Maharashtra after a leak in the hospital’s main oxygen tank stopped the flow of oxygen to dozens of critically ill people.
9938,Televised images showed family members wailing in the wards and nurses frantically pounding on the chests of some patients.
9939,"All week, hospitals across India have been warning about an acute oxygen shortage."

9999,"Twelve of the 14 men affected were 20 to 59 years old, the remaining two were between 60 and 70."

10042,"But if small pox was able to infect bats, like COVID can,  it would still be there."
10043,"For this reason, zero COVID is not a realistic goal, in my opinion."
10044,"Instead, we should shoot for high vaccination rates which prevents large outbreaks."
10045,"The high vaccination rates will also lower severity of the disease for most, and it will fall into the background of other common respiratory viruses that are out there."
10046,"So, I think the endgame is relegating COVID to an endemic respiratory virus that we rarely think about because population immunity is high enough to limit severe illness."
10047,Thank you.
10048,That was very informative.
10049,Can't wait to get my second jab...
10050,It’s really bizarre.
10051,I’m trying not to picture what their teeth must look like 😬
10052,I think generally 10-15 hours.
10053,I got mine at 5pm and woke up with a “hangover” the next day
10054,"Technically the ordinance for my county reads ""masks are required in any public place""."
10055,"I've never seen outdoor masking at all here (with the exception of schools, Disney, and theme parks), but I guess the order implies we are supposed to be even wearing them outside."
10056,Isreal is a perfect example of how well the vaccine works.
10057,Covaxin was administered (with a license for emergency purposes only) from march in India.
10058,"Based on the production, around 10% of the vaccine shots administered in India were covaxin."
10059,"(This number could be wrong, just an estimate)
The demand shot up a bit after the covishield blood clot scare."
10060,So why do I keep hearing stories that say that we'll likely need an annual covid shot just like a flu shot?
10061,You’re right.
10062,Rumors have it the spread was among the high school kids but at things like parties and sports.
10063,I don’t think it was in the classroom setting.
10064,"Not sure about his name, he acted in this movie, [here's a famous scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRyJ0dawjM)"
10065,Got my second Moderna shot yesterday.
10066,Only side effect is a sore arm.
10067,I would think this means their trial results should be out soon if they no longer need an unvaccinated placebo group.
10068,I’m hoping it will lead to a quick approval by health Canada with its rolling review and a lot of data already looked at from the UK and South Africa trials
10069,It was a completely different world then..
10070, Combine walk-in appointments and primary voting...
10071,"A friend said yesterday ""I'm not getting the vaccine."
10072,"I'd rather get Covid and die, then get the shot and die."""
10073,"I try to understand the logic, but I can't."
10074,"How can someone be scared of dying from a vaccine, but not the virus?"
10075,How is one better than the other?
10076,I read an article someone posted on here (as well as other articles) regarding Prozac possibly having benefits against Covid because of anti-inflammatory properties.
10077,"My question is, will the covid vaccine not be as effective in people on Prozac because of its anti-inflammation properties?"
10078,Similar to how we are told to avoid taking advil before the covid shot since it could reduce its effectiveness?
10079,I'm not sure what your point is here.
10080,The Mayor has no control over the mask mandate and so what he hints at as being the end-time is irrelevant.
10081,He's been overruled time and time again on numerous other reopening actions and mandates already.
10082,this.
10083,You don’t know that they have been exposed.
10084,"I got vaccinated 2 months ago, but I never got exposed before that, which was about 12 months into the pandemic."
10085,"Im in my mid 20s, in good health, not anti vax but wasn't in a rush to get it."
10086,all my at risk family members are double vaxxed so me not getting it wasnt too big of a concern for me.
10087,and thennnn new york decided to mandate negative tests or vaccine proof to go to baseball games.
10088,"i figured this would become the norm  here for concerts, events etc and that was what made me sign up to get the vax."
10089,i havent gotten the flu shot in a decade.
10090,"i wasnt going to get a negative test every time i wanted to go to an event, so just getting the vax over with was what changed my mind."
10091,"i disagree with the direction NY is going and mandating tests/vax proof to do things, as i feel you should have the choice to go if youre willing to take the risk (same goes for others who go that are vaccinated coming in contact with those who arent) but, i think in doing so, itll get more people my age, in similar situations to get the vax if they werent originally planning to"
10092,Yeah.
10093,If you see my above comments I am acknowledging we did all of those things and have only ourselves to blame.
10094,Friends tell friends how it is.
10095,The whole world was sniggering at the US for Trump.
10096,He was a literal joke.

10100,Just pointing out the results.

1) Might be good to read CDC international travel guidelines."

10125,"""Continue to wear their masks and I'll keep saying it, at least through June,"" the mayor said as he talked about the city's vaccine efforts."
10126,"""Stick with the mask, stick with the social distancing, people are still being smart and cautious and that's helping us."""
10127,A similar message reverberates at state and federal levels around masks.
10128,"&amp;nbsp;

From the article."
10129,The other lawmakers are with him on this one.
10130,Where’s the data on the Chinese?
10131,India (some cities) for one - I have a friend there who is keeping me in the loop and they have been having curfews and lockdowns because of high community spread there.
10132,The correct take imo
10133,"Yeah, it's also the thing that needs to be done to get where I need to be."
10134,An improvement layer.
10135,Where the heck do you live that people act like that?
10136,That’s annoying.
10137,"Efficacy is not exactly comparable across vaccines unfortunately, you can't say ""this vaccine is 12% better than this other one"" you're better off just thinking of it as binary, ""This is a good vaccine that works"""
10138,I just logged on to Walgreens near me.
10139,:: and ever location says.
10140,:: many appts available.
10141,Like I said when I got my kids tested recently...  there were tests available every 15 mins the rest of the day.
10142,A healthy population doesn’t spend it’s days getting tested.
10143,Do you go for flu tests when you feel fine?
10144,Probably not.
10145,Same with covid so your info makes no sense.
10146,But nice try.
10147,I don't disagree but I think allowing non essential workers to reach some degree of immunity sooner ends up conferring some level of protection for POC in essential positions over the long run.
10148,It's interesting to me that COVID-19 disproportionately affected white Floridians while disproportionately affecting POC in Michigan.
10149,And Texas has the highest number of people in MLMs per capita.
10150,Now I am wondering what the Pearson's r correlation coefficient on that would be.
10151,"I guess undefined, no?"
10152,"SD would be zero, the numerator would also reduce to zero."
10153,Division by zero is undefined.
10154,"Thanks for the brain exercises, Reddit!"
10155,What?
10156,Also vaccinated Florida woman.
10157,Another reason to wear a mask is company policy.
10158,I worked retail for years and there’s no reason to make a service worker’s job harder by fighting them.
10159,I did switch to just the blue disposable though.
10160,Makes others comfortable but so much more comfortable than what I had been wearing.
10161,It’s your choice that a year was “stolen” from you.
10162,I’m very thankful I didn’t stick my head into my ass for a year and stay home and do nothing.
10163,"Honestly, the last 6 months have been some of the best months of my life."
10164,"I hang out with friends all the time, go to bars all the time, have been going to the gym 4x a week, see my family all the time and it’s wonderful"
10165,I had covid last March and when I got the shot I had pretty severe side effects but it lasted for about 24-36 hrs and was done.
10166,I was glad I got J&amp;J though because if it was anything else I would not have gone back for the second jab given how bad the first one was.
10167,If that 100% was also for hospitalization and death why didn't they write it out explicitly.
10168,Death risk reduction is like the #1 efficacy endpoint.
10169,"I think these were the interim results of the Phase 3 trial, the full data will be released once they get around 300 (I am not sure about the exact number) infections in the trial."
10170,"However, this is already approved in India and I doubt we would be exporting this vaccine anytime soon as the manufacturer is struggling just to keep up with the demand locally."
10171,And also the manufacturing standards might not be up to Western standards so there's that too.
10172,Could honestly see the indoor mask mandate ending sometime this summer too.
10173,"With ~55% of antibody tests coming back positive lately and 40% of the city's population already at least partially vaccinated, I expect cases to absolutely plummet over the next month."
10174,"The 7 day average of confirmed + probable cases fell as low as 250 last summer, when community protection was a fraction of what it is now."
10175,We could realistically see cases fall to sub-50 per day this time around.
10176,"&gt;I think they mean it would hypocritical to ban AstraZeneca but allow the J&amp;J, because they both are thought to have the same problem with blood clots."
10177,"&gt;  
&gt;It would be incompetent to ban them both due to very low incidence of blood clots and then leaving the country with limited vaccine options."
10178,Ahh thanks.
10179,Ill give you the upvote then:)
10180,&gt;Study of a promising COVID-19 vaccine by Novavax is continuing in the U.S. and Mexico.
10181,"Now, clinical trial participants, including me, are rolling up our sleeves for a third shot and then, three weeks later, a fourth."
10182,"&gt;“Today, Novavax began what we call a blinded crossover,” said Dr. Thomas Campbell, lead investigator at the study site at UCHealth, one of 115 sites."
10183,&gt;That means the participants who originally got two shots of the vaccine will get two shots of placebo and those who got two shots of placebo will get two shots of vaccine.
10184,"&gt;“Everybody who is still in the study will know they’ve been vaccinated, but they won’t know when they got the vaccine,” explained Campbell."
10185,On my Pfizer it was mostly next day for me.
10186,Maybe just a little sleepy the same day of injection.
10187,I think you probably can run some errands.

10277,Which jabs are they using?
10278,Had slow production till now.
10279,Both SII n BB who are the manufacturers of AZ n Covaxin respectively have received money from the Govt to increase production.
10280,Till now they were subsidising the vaccines for the Govt at 3$/ dose.
10281,"After the recent spikes because of the 2nd wave, the Govt has decided to open up vaccination for everyone above 18 and has let both the companies supply directly to State Govts and Private Hospitals at 2 times the current price."

10298,"Basically, a more-contagious covid variant found a bunch of virgin territory in communities that decided that, with the arrival of the vaccine and the end of winter, they were done being careful and were eager to return to normal."

10301,"In case it's behind a paywall, here are some good bits:

&gt;“Just so you know, you don’t have to wear that if you don’t want to,” owner Mark Heberling says as a masked visitor walks through door."
10302,"&gt;...

&gt;“I didn’t sign up to be the mask police,” says restaurant owner Troy Tank, as a handful of maskless employees clean up after the lunch rush."
10303,Tank casually mentions one worker is home quarantining after a positive COVID test.
10304,"&gt;...

&gt;Compared to the rest of Michigan, the Thumb was less impacted by previous surges, which meant fewer people had natural immunity coming into the spring."
10305,The area appears to be hard-hit by the new B.1.1.7.
10306,variant which is much more contagious and also more lethal.
10307,"Restrictions implemented in November have been eased, increasing social interactions."
10308,"&gt;
&gt;And fanning the flames is widespread resistance among local residents to coronavirus mitigation strategies such as masking and avoiding indoor gatherings, said Bryant Wilke, Sanilac County public health director."
10309,"&gt;
&gt;“There’s been a defiance towards masks,” Wilke said, “and I think it was because it got so political at the beginning of the pandemic."
10310,"People said, ‘We don’t trust this."
10311,"We never had to do it before,’ even through its been proven that it is a protective factor."
10312,"People haven’t gotten over the hump to say, ‘We need to do this,’ and now we’re seeing the causation of not doing it and that’s the skyrocketing numbers in cases."
10313,"&gt;
&gt;“I compare us to a potential wildfire,” Wilke said."
10314,“You’ve got fuel out there and the virus hadn’t hit us that bad yet.
10315,"Now it’s hitting us and we’re dealing with the U.K. variant, and it’s just moving through the population rapidly.”

&gt;...

&gt;At the same time, Thumb residents -- like many in Michigan -- are thoroughly sick of more than a year of various coronavirus restrictions."
10316,"They are ready to move on, whether the pandemic is over or not."
10317,"&gt;
&gt;“We’re just f----- done with it,” Heberling said."
10318,"&gt;...

&gt;Hamed has long worried that the Thumb is vulnerable because of residents’ disdain for coronavirus restrictions."

&gt;Still, good luck and geographic isolation meant the Thumb wasn’t hit as hard as other parts of Michigan in 2020."
10320,"&gt;
&gt;“I think that allowed people to discount how serious this is,” Hamed said."
10321,"It goes on, with more conversations with people in the community and the health officials from those areas."
10322,"Once the virus got politicized, rationality went out the window"
10323,Interesting data point.
10324,"I thought the UK was an outlier because from the news that come from there, it seems like everyone accepts AZ, while in the rest of Europe rejecting it is rather common."
10325,"From what you say, maybe the uptake is not so different with respect to other countries."
10326,Don't let the facts stand in the way of a good 'Murica bashing ;)
10327,I’m really interested in how this misinformation spreads.
10328,Could you link to the sources you used to come to this conclusion?
10329,"The conclusion is wrong, so they obviously weren’t scientific ones."
10330,I’m just really interested on how people get so fooled by unqualified sources.
10331,Perhaps there’s something in them I can see to help me understand.
10332,Important because I am starting to see US authorities giving the impression that herd immunity is a pipe dream since maybe 25%+ say they won’t get vaccinated.
10333,"Plus, with places like India getting hammered by the virus and community spread still happening in pockets around the world, eradication is unlikely so it’s just having a capable tool to treat those most vulnerable now (if you want to take the pessimistic view)"
10334,So there are basically 3 different types of vaccines?
10335,"1. mRNA like moderna
2."
10336,"Dead virus like covaxin
3. live virus with no replication like AZ

Right?"
10337,Are there anymore?
10338,For covid or in general?
10339,That's a possibility.
10340,He's high enough in the org chart and has enough influence that he does have some say on whether masks are required for 8 hrs a day while at your desk.
10341,"In Europe at least, some of the rules are implemented because of bad news appearing on TV like “family gatherings from 3 districts causes 40 people surge” and stuff like that."
10342,Some rules are just to counter those news.
10343,The thing is that no country has detailed data on where people get infected.
10344,"Yes, we have numbers but they are highly incomplete and inaccurate, specially in countries where the numbers got very high."
10345,So it’s really not possible to do rules just based on the data you require.
10346,We know the fundamentals and that is people gathering and mingling in high risk scenarios and then we try to make rules to avoid that.
10347,Also since one rule isn’t done isolated it’s not possible to draw those conclusions of “its working“ or not.
10348,You just don’t know if cases would be double if curfews weren’t implemented.
10349,"This is not easy and it’s not a pc game where we can see numbers, adjust, roll back, try again..."
10350,"Meanwhile in my country, according to social media posts the people believe that this is a conspiracy, and are 'praying' away the virus."
10351,The Brazil variant was found here a few days ago.
10352,"You're off by a factor of 5 and it's ""just as bad""?"
10353,Where are you even pulling this IFR from?
10354,Perhaps India shouldn't have gone back to complete normal 10 months ago?
10355,Irresponsible.
10356,&gt; I was thinking when the vaccines started to be rolled out that there should be a worldwide effort to vaccinate everyone over the age of 75 as soon as possible and then move into younger/healthier populations when that goal is mostly met.
10357,Is that not the case?
10358,That seems pretty universal in the countries I've looked at.
10359,I'm in Colombia now on vacation and they're doing that here.
10360,&gt; That way we could avoid the extremely high death and severe illness rates while reducing the ability for the virus to mutate in the sickest populations.
10361,Note that viruses actually mutate faster in populations that are more resistant but where the disease is still spreading.
10362,But keeping it alive for longer is still really bad.
10363,"And that's without even taking into account that the 127K deaths were mostly older people, and that they were mostly during the big waves and now the incidence is much lower."
10364,"Again: Poland never held up AZ, we are using it as it comes, every single week since it became available, and yet we’re not getting it."
10365,"yes, and part of the polarization in the USA at present stems from the wealthy elite thinking their views are / should be / must be the unquestioned norm, and then using their wealthy elite status to make it so, or attempt it."
10366,"Right or wrong on the issues, this is a dynamic."
10367,And people don't like it.
10368,We went from “this is political bullshit” to “I can see why healthy people would be hesitant.
10369,“  nice.
10370,Patience is key.
10371,You have a 10 to 20 times higher chance of getting a blood clot from Covid than you do from this vaccines.
10372,My dentist brother in law once posted a study that showed that people who floss live longer.
10373,"I would hazard a guess that it’s not the flossing that makes you live longer, but that flossers are simply more health conscious."
10374,I’m guessing the same thing applies here.
10375,People who take good care of their teeth also are probably more likely to eat well and get outside for a jog once in awhile.
10376,I’m surprised it took this long.
10377,I’m quoting a newspaper article.
10378,I think there may be few other components they export from the US.
10379,Do you have some sources?
10380,I’d like to know how much it was happening and how they tracked infections.
10381,The question is what does endgame mean?
10382,We literally have to vaccinate everybody each year from now on right?
10383,Until they find a cure for it?
10384,What is the real endgame here?
10385,"&gt;The pro-restriction public health folks will pound the table on children/people with certain health conditions

It would be nice if I didn't constantly see children screaming without masks on."
10386,I guess the concerned parents aren't the ones I see out with their kids all the time.
10387,"Covid-19: 43,098 new cases in 24 hours, 375 deaths in 24 hours in French hospitals

UPDATE ON THE SITUATION - New measures, new reports and highlights: an update on the latest developments in the Covid-19 pandemic around the world."
10388,"France has fallen to 33,000 daily cases, a clear decrease, but "" *fragile* "", for the Minister of Health Olivier Véran, who evokes a territorialized deconfinement."
10389,"In the United States, and soon in India, the vaccine is offered to all citizens, while the WHO is against the idea of ​​a compulsory vaccination passport for international travelers."
10390,"5,984 people in intensive care in France

43,098 new cases were recorded in 24 hours in France, according to figures from Public Health France published on Tuesday, against 6,696 the day before and 39,113 last Tuesday."
10391,The test positivity rate is 9.8%.
10392,The pressure on French resuscitations continues to increase.
10393,"5,984 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized in these services on Tuesday, including 601 people admitted in the last 24 hours, against 5,970 the day before."
10394,"In total, hospitals had 31,086 people affected by Covid-19, including 2,404 admitted in 24 hours."
10395,"375 people have died in the last 24 hours in French hospitals, bringing the number of hospital deaths to 75,413."
10396,"Regarding vaccinations, 12,999,655 people have received at least one injection since the start of the campaign (i.e."
10397,"19.4% of the total population) and 4,845,217 people have received two injections (i.e."
10398,7.2% of the total population).
10399,total population).
10400,"In the last 24 hours, 418,766 people have been vaccinated: among them, 248,557 received a first dose and 170,209 a second."
10401,Thank you.
10402,I needed to hear this right now.
10403,Everyone survived.
10404,It was not a stroke.
10405,Chill.
10406,"So the cases affected overwhelmingly more women (45 women vs. 14 men) but when it comes to deaths, men were equally affected (6 vs. 6)."
10407,"Giving the vaccine only to men has been suggested sometimes, but it doesn't look like a good idea either."
10408,"Sharing is always fun, kids"
10409,"Stomping out variants takes general mass vaccination of the population though, not just the 75+."
10410,That's a lot more vaccines.
10411,"It's unfair, but once the rich countries are mostly vaccinated the supplies should be flooding the poorer ones."
10412,"If they don't, then that would truly be a failure."
10413,It was literally Fauci who said that though...
10414,This article says it's a lot because of truck drivers (they don't have to follow quarantine).
10415,"Sadly, there's not a lot we can do about that."
10416,"Buuuuuuuut now that the U.S. is getting vaccinated massively, Canada will eventually be more protected."
10417,That is also why some states have decided to give vaccines to canadian truckers.
10418,[removed]
10419,"I mean, I took a look and actually can't find experts advising that you should wash your goods (other than produce, of course, but not for covid reasons)."
10420,"I imagine there was *someone* saying it, but the overwhelming majority of experts indicated even in March 2020 that it wasn't necessary."
10421,"The thing that they pushed more was washing hands, which of course is still good to do, but we also know now that it likely makes little difference for this virus."
10422,Wild speculation: he's afraid of needles.
10423,The German and Dutch regulator also published a risk assessment of the AstraZeneca vaccin.
10424,The German regulator basically said that the risk of vaccination for women under 55 was greater than the risk of Covid.
10425,Hence the decision to only give it to people over 60.
10426,The Dutch advising body said that if they used AstraZeneca for younger people it would mean that 70-90 people would have these side-effects.
10427,Out of those about 20 would die and half would have serious and mostly lasting health issues.
10428,So they also said to only use it for the over sixties.
10429,Worth mentioning in this context that only one woman under the age of 35 died of Covid in the Netherlands in more than a year now.
10430,The age split in the UK was still published in a roundabout way.
10431,"Saying the risk was 1.1 in 100,000 (so 1 in 90,000) and they offset this against the risk of ending up in intensive care."
10432,But the British figures have not been updated since they published that.
10433,The European updated figures show worse figures than this.
10434,The Scandinavian countries -with the possible exception of Sweden- will not be using AstraZeneca for the time being.
10435,"In Norway four young people died out of 140,000 vaccinations with AstraZeneca."
10436,I hope the figures will turn out better for the Johnson vaccin or our total vaccination effort will be delayed.
10437,I am not sure how it would go in the USA without using this vaccin.
10438,I also wonder how they will be able to enroll enough people to a separate stage 2 and 3 trial considering that people are receiving other Covid vaccines at the moment.
10439,That may be the reason why they propose no placebo group as well.
10440,Quite unfortunate that stage 2 and 3 could not be combined.
10441,They would probably need to do trials outside of Canada to be able to enroll enough participants.
10442,I would go get a pcr test today - you might get lucky.
10443,It's so patronising and dehumanising.
10444,"Oh, just risk young death for the team!"
10445,Yay science!
10446,"Nope, no thanks."
10447,"As long as safer alternatives exist, I will wait for one of them instead."
10448,I had pretty much the same experience as you
10449,It’s reality.
10450,You can’t be equally effected by every death.
10451,"Yes, but it's both nonzero *and* it compounds the more time you spend in proximity to asymptomatic spreaders."
10452,In a crowded urban environment you're not just passing near one or two people when you're walking around outdoors--at least not anymore.
10453,"There are plenty of crowds outdoors again, and both the state of Massachusetts and cities like NYC have *daily* case rates that match the worst single day of the first peak."
10454,"In these cities, outdoor masking still makes sense from a cost/benefit approach."
10455,It's just crowded.
10456,"Sucks for the burbs and the rural areas of the state, but I also haven't seen any sign of outdoor mask mandate enforcement outside of the urban areas."
10457,"Or really, even *in* the urban areas."
10458,My mom works with a department in India and apparently things are so bad there that they’re mixing up the dead bodies they send to funerals simply because there are so many.
10459,Germany looks to be heading that way based of new legislation.
10460,"The current VOCs are from the UK, Brazil, CA, NYC, India, etc., all of which had a particularly bad outbreak, while SA has the highest number of HIV positive cases."
10461,Immunocompromised patients are the ideal hosts for the virus to mutate in.
10462,"Yes, and now India's own people are getting sick and dying from another Covid wave."
10463,I'm sure people there are so happy that they are dying so that the government can have international good will.

10473,"That is still just as bad really, at least you can’t choose to get Covid and you can actually get a safer vaccine elsewhere."
10474,What a fucking disaster of a vaccine
10475,"Don’t disagree, it’s why we need to continue with better practices, masks in public places, and social distancing.. with the growing global population and movement between all areas of the planet daily we need to adopt better standards for personal and group hygiene or we will have worsening spread of new global mutations of many diseases."
10476,Humans need to clean up their act or we’re going to have massive future issues.
10477,Another Floridian here.
10478,I wear my mask only when required.

10482,Lmao Canada will be the last country to stop looking at the US as the world leader.
10483,The US does so much to protect and help Canada but because the government wants to help its own citizens first you no longer see it as the leader?
10484,Here is the truth:  Canada has no choice but to follow what the US tells it to do.
10485,Death falls under the “severe” umbrella my friend.
10486,I’ve felt like this all has to be the work of variants.
10487,I live in a county in another state that finally started to see case numbers going down as vaccines ramped up but then all of April we’ve been back to January numbers with no end in sight.
10488,Seriously?
10489,Should not be dangerous but obviously hard to know for sure
10490,"Everyone in some countries, but not many countries"
10491,And that's IF you get infected after taking the vaccine
10492,Oof 🤦‍♂️ Eight years after they were selected by the Gov to produce vaccines... Epic fail.
10493,"Also there’s no way to tell vaccinated from unvaccinated, so the safe thing to do is to treat us all as if we weren’t until this is under control."
10494,That doesn’t justify outright lying to people.
10495,"Even if it helped preserve masks, it’s eroded confidence in what the CDC was saying."
10496,Recently again the CDC said you can’t spread it after getting vaccinated then the next day said oh wait you can (even though you basically cant).
10497,Messaging has been a mess the whole time across both administrations.
10498,"I got my second dose on Saturday, also Pfizer."
10499,"I had had a decent amount of achiness and fatigue for about 36 hours with the first one so I was concerned about the second, but my symptoms were basically the same, even a bit milder."
10500,Was 100% normal with not even any residual arm ache by Monday morning.
10501,"We hear the horror stories, and forget that the people reporting side effects are something like less than half of the total."
10502,TROUBLE
10503,"My guess is it's the Brazil variant, which is more contagious and can likely reinfect those who had a mild or asymptomatic case before."
10504,"This variant is currently blowing up Ontario, and Michigan is nearby, so it probably came down from Canada, and started spreading in Michigan before widespread vaccines started fighting back."
10505,"Hopefully the rest of the country's vaccines kick in and block its spread before it causes spikes in other states, which seems likely."
10506,"Edit: Just saw the other reply about B.1.1.7, which is also more contagious, so maybe it's just that one."
10507,They all fuck with their masks on.
10508,"I’m not in favor of huge restrictions forever, but I don’t understand any “cost/benefit analysis” in which the benefit is “my face is slightly more comfortable” and the cost is “children and the immunocompromised get sick and die.”"
10509,"Your example data is highly incorrect, you don't understand how vaccine efficacy works."
10510,You don't have anywhere near a 10% chance of getting COVID after being vaccinated.
10511,"**With the mRNA vaccines, it's approximately 0.04%**

[https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html)"
10512,Outdoors doesn’t mean you can socially distance from others.
10513,"If you aren’t distanced, of course using a mask has a benefit."
10514,There is no science saying outdoors transmission is impossible.
10515,"If you are hiking alone, of course."
10516,"Running in the middle of a crowded city, no."
10517,How do you actually operationalize that though?
10518,You are going to have everyone who will never get a vaccine not wearing masks because it’s to hard to enforce.
10519,What are the validity of these numbers?
10520,Doesn’t show any independent verification and it considers Sputnik V as 92% effective LOL.
10521,There is no real reason to develop these random vaccines - just produce the ones that have indenpendent scientific validation and inoculate your people.
10522,The error proof comment was a great insight (at least for me).
10523,Or at a metal-bat softball game
10524,Is the bags supply enough for support both US and India production?
10525,From what I read the vaccine liquid is also shipped to other countries for bottling.
10526,Didn’t something like this happen in Egypt too a while ago?
10527,This 1000X
10528,Now if we could only get people to actually get the vaccines instead of hesitating.
10529,Where I live I think less than 30% of the population is vaccinated.
10530,This thing isn't over and we can't just pretend it is.
10531,I wouldn't go to Poland on 2 months notice *BEFORE* Covid.
10532,The fact that Covid is still raging in Europe makes it that much more ridiculous
10533,Please... these guys were not wearing masks nor distancing on purpose because it’s part of their message to show that the virus somehow doesn’t exist or is not really dangerous.
10534,This is actively contributing to the pandemic getting worse.
10535,"If they want to be respected and left alone during their protest, they have to follow the rules that exist to protect all of us."
10536,A redditor posted a great spread sheet by state of which states were supply and demand constrained late last week under one of the big daily vaccine threads.
10537,If I can't find it hopefully someone else can - it was interesting.
10538,Not everyone is eligible.
10539,A quarter of people are under 16 and do not have access to vaccination.
10540,"Despite what people on this sub like to claim, children are at risk for serious long-term illness from the virus and it is not right to put them in harm’s way just to make people’s faces more comfortable."
10541,"Again, ALTERNATIVE VACCINES EXIST THAT DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM."
10542,Why is this so hard for people to understand?
10543,It's not a binary choice of get AZ or get COVID and I really wish people would stop making that false equivalency.
10544,So far everybody has run into production problems ...
10545,It would be awesome if one goes smoothly.
10546,"First of all, the 7 day average NYS vaccination rate remains fairly robust at 200k despite the J&amp;J headwinds."
10547,"Also, the city is laser focused on increasing uptake in harder to reach communities by opening up more mass vaccination sites and increasing walk up appointment access."
10548,"We probably need to get to 55-60% vaccination for this crisis to basically end in NYC, which seems totally doable from the current baseline."
10549,This was a huge source of spread in california when it was in full lockdown.
10550," ""About a third of the people who have been prescribed this form are already well."
10551,"Many people have an asymptomatic form, ""said a representative of the NVSC."
10552,Among those infected and vaccinated.
10553,"""They are infected but have no symptoms, absolutely asymptomatic."
10554,"And no one else became infected with them either, ”said B. Sapkauskienė."

10567,Yeah there is a lot to think about.
10568,Clearly there is more that we don't know because it's silly to think that the massive outbreak in Wuhan was only capable of 3000 deaths yet a outbreak of lesser duration in Italy resulted in nearly 1000 deaths per day.
10569,I understand the differences in the countries but knowing what we know now there must be more intricacies to have a death rate that was around 10 times as high.

10642,It's composed of the southern part of Slesvig and the whole of Holstein.
10643,That just entails getting your doctor to check a box &amp; sign it.
10644,Which many will be happy to do if you just say I don't want the vaccine.
10645,My old gp would just sign the forms saying I don't have asthma despite his records clearly said I did.
10646,The US could reserve doses sent abroad for military and diplomatic service personnel abroad and possibly even expats.
10647,It has enough supply to do this.
10648,"I am not a believer in any of the Bill Gates vaccine tracking chip nonsense, however... if a chip were embedded in your body and there were scanners in doorways whatever, they could track your movements."

10651,"And out of curiosity I did look up if there are chips small enough to fit through the needle of a syringe, turns out that there are."
10652,Yes.
10653,But we’re expecting Sputnik doses from dr Reddys soon.
10654,And Bharat biotech has roped in haffkine and another PSU to manufacture covaxin.

10659,My wife has always been an introvert.
10660,This last year since she's been working from home she's settled in and except for doctor appointments she doesn't leave the house except to drive her car once a week.
10661,I've always been an extrovert so I've been the one to do the shopping and anything outside of the house.
10662,The last time she was in any kind of store was in September and she's told me she likes it this way.
10663,"Yes, and we know conclusively and without any shadow of a doubt that masks do not slow rT below 1 in many counties."
10664,"There are many examples of countries with universal adoption of masks with raging, out of control pandemics."
10665,"Argentina is a great example, with mandatory masks, substantial and enforced fines for not wearing masks, self-reported mask wearing in the upper 90s, and among the world's strictest and longest lockdowns, and still the pandemic rages out of control."
10666,"Masks reduce the spread, but it's obvious they don't reduce rT below 1 everywhere."
10667,14 days after receiving it
10668,It’s an uncomfortable truth: America’s vaccine success is coming at the expensive of the world.
10669,But it’s just what has to happen to control a runaway pandemic.
10670,India is now doing the same.
10671,Thanks god for hearing any good news
10672,"Once the US gets to 60%, it will have the same problem Israel is having: convincing the rest of the population to vaccinate."
10673,"That's when vaccination will slow to a crawl, not because of the lack of vaccines, but because of the lack of people."
10674,"At least once the vaccine gets approved for 12-15, that's another 5% vaccinated."
10675,Well I mean we probably receive more money than Puerto Rico

10684,"Yes:  

&gt;	Every dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is born in a Pfizer lab in Chesterfield, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis."
10685,That's where small DNA molecules called plasmids are made with the beginnings of the code for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
10686,"&gt;	From Missouri, the plasmids are shipped to two labs, one a Pfizer facility in Andover, Mass., and another a BioNTech facility in Germany, where they are used to make the mRNA."

10699,Both are extremely unlikely.

I get that you can look at articles and wiki - all of this is a real life scenario being applied as we go, statistics and data can be off by a margin or wildly speculative."
10724,90%+ is the base line for fully vaccinated seems like fox news is the only source I can find that keeps mentioning a 0.0008 chance of infection.
10725,"Things change with the virus often and quickly and a lot of speculation of ""should"" not ""it will""."
10726,\*official figures  .. ahem.

10728,"If these numbers are from a week ago, then maybe the current number are lower."
10729,OR the current numbers are actually higher.
10730,They certainly weren't decreasing.
10731,the states with larger vaccinated populations/more people wanting the vaccine seem to be the states where people take the virus more seriously so the leaders are more cautious about getting rid of restrictions versus the states that tend to take it less seriously
10732,this time the outbreak was too big to hide.
10733,"Ugh, I remember towards the beginning our only goal was making sure the hospitals weren't over loaded, now I hear a few people saying it's not okay to stop until covid is completely eliminated, which is frankly overkill."
10734,Funny how quickly that number goes down.
10735,7-day average goes down ~10% in less than a week.

10742,The endemic cold coronaviruses have probably been with us for centuries and will probably always be with us.
10743,"What will happen is that, like with those viruses, babies will acquire some base immunity from their mothers, and be exposed to the virus at a young age, when it causes little harm."
10744,That will make evolved versions of the viruses relatively harmless later in life (as is the case with the existing coronaviruses that affect humans).
10745,"A cold is as bad as it gets, and is primarily just evidence of the immune system response."
10746,How soon this will happen is the question.
10747,That’s what I kept telling myself Monday night when I was in too much pain to sleep.
10748,Way better to be sick as a dog for a day and a half than be sick for weeks while also worrying about who else caught it from me.
10749,See above and sorry for the “late” 24 hour reply.
10750,I don’t live my life on Reddit.
10751,Lockdowns + diverting all of their vaccines bound to the world to their citizens will hopefully do the trick but it’s going to be many more months of death.
10752,Should have outbid us then.
10753,One thing the Trump admin did right I guess was buy up everything to put us in a good position to beat the virus.
10754,that was propaganda.
10755,Well you can thank people like me who had both az doses to help limit the spread of covid so people like you could safely choose to decline because covid is disappearing.
10756,[removed]
10757,"Well, we shouldn't look at these matters so binary, and there are still questions on how enduring the protection of vaccinations will be (including risk from mutation)."
10758,But overall should have optimism that vaccinations will allow pretty much a return to normal if adoption is high enough.
10759,"They can, and imho are, saying that measures/posture can be relaxed for vaccinated populations, but there isn't a meaningful 'end' point when everything should shut off."
10760,"These are complex situations, and nuance is hard to communicate to the public particularly when you have to factor in aim is to guide the actual behavior that results, not just communicating the 'right' advice."
10761,That’s how I feel in the US.
10762,We stayed home for a year to protect the the boomers.
10763,Then the boomers were first in line to get their vaccination and then said see ya and headed to Florida on vacation
10764,so many stories like this over the last few days.
10765,Heartbreaking.
10766,"""I CANT BREATHE""  ... takes on a whole new meaning and stark reality for indians."
10767,"yeah, this"
10768,It is 100% illogical to pull the vaccine.
10769,"This decision was made due to fear and stupidity, not by looking at the data."
10770,The reason why the AZ vaccine can give you a blood clot is because of the interaction of the spike protein with your immune system.
10771,"That same spike protein is actually found on the Covid 19 virus and causes the same type of blood clot in much higher incidences, I’m talking at the low end 8 times higher and at the high end 20 times higher."
10772,"Looking at the data, looking at the numbers, you have a much higher chance of dying from Covid than you do from the vaccine."
10773,"you can go to a big party and your chances of getting it or spreading it are still small, and even if you did by some chance get it it would probably just be like a cold"
10774,"Religions may require cremation, but at some point it also might not be an option."
10775,"When the options are burial in a mass grave or bodies piling up in the streets, it's not hard to see the direction things will go."
10776,"I sincerely pray it doesn't reach that point, but given the current trajectory in the country it could be hard to avoid."
10777,Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection among young competitive athletes is associated with a low prevalence of cardiac involvement and a low risk of clinical events in short term follow-up.

10779,They are close to hitting it since fewer first shots are being administered.
10780,But I wouldn't count on them exporting any time soon since it will be bad optics.
10781,More likely it gets wasted.
10782,Canada's supply from the EU is enough to get everyone vaccinated by June.
10783,"Yep, I totally agree."
10784,I’m in the Metro-Detroit suburbs and the amount of ignorance here is disgusting.
10785,I’m particularly fed-up with the “let them play” crowd.
10786,large population means large number of doctors and nurses and people to help you.
10787,stop victim blaming
10788,I mean it is if you actually look at the numbers.
10789,Cases have been decreasing for the past two weeks and people in the ICUs are now plateauing too.
10790,All the typical signs of a peak.
10791,"With most of the senior population now being vaccinated, things are only going to get better."
10792,Yeah I'm from IL but now live in MN and have been following data for both states daily since last March.
10793,"During this most recent surge, the two have been in lockstep."
10794,It's kind of interesting.
10795,Both are now starting to fall over the past week or so.
10796,I wish we weren't doing this here in The Netherlands
10797,Can you blame them?
10798,The American media has gone to great length to paint ourselves as evil reincarnate.
10799,Just once I’d like to see the main stream media paper come out and say yeah we got problems but apparently they’re way less than everybody else’s because the flow of immigration it’s to the U.S. not away.
10800,Even Canada has a ratio of 10 to 1 toward the u.s.
10801,live free or die
10802,When are you considered fully vaccinated after the Johnson and Johnson shot?
10803,"This may sound harsh, but send your brother images of people in the hospital with Covid and explain that the only guarantee of not ending up like them is getting the vaccine."
10804,Yes.
10805,I thought that was implied since the question was about the study.
10806,"please pray for india tonight.... most hospitals in north india were already running out of oxygen, but now even the national capital of Delhi is at risk."
10807,the cries for help on twitter and facebook are heartbreaking.
10808,"Uppercaste rich people are also running from pillar to post for beds, oxygen, medicines, ventilators and medical attention, and begging for help on twitter and facebook and linkedin."
10809,Please pray for us.
10810,India the bully?
10811,lmao
10812,"Let me first address the mask ""lie""."
10813,You'll recall at the beginning of this there was a study showing alarmingly long time viability on surfaces.
10814,It wasn't only because of limitations on supply.
10815,"As for evidence not suggesting vaccinated people can spread - yes, it's true, the vaccine cuts back on 80-90% of infections."
10816,There's still 10% that aren't protected.
10817,"With such low vaccine rates still, and high community spread - advising people they're totes mc goats safe if they're vaxxed would be ill advised."
10818,People make that cost/benefit analysis every single year for the flu (which is more deadly to kids than COVID) every single year they didn't wear a mask before this.
10819,[removed]
10820,"Someone had a good analogy the other day when they said that ""Because one side acted like COVID was nothing at all, the other had to act like it was World War Z""."
10821,All indications are that fully vaccinated folks take more risk getting into their car to drive to the restaurant than they do eating inside of it.
10822,"I'm vaccinated, and if a store or restaurant has a policy for masks or such, I'll follow it and not make a stink."
10823,"But I won't brook being scolded by folks who can't wrap their head around numbers because I won't hunker in my home and post mask selfies on Twitter with captions like ""VACCINATED BUT NEVER LEAVING HOME."
10824,"#maybein2023 #OsterholmFan #SwimmingInSanitizer"""
10825,So why did it take that long?
10826,I think you have to allow people to pick their vaccine or you risk clogging the system with people who refuse and re-schedule.
10827,"Wait, Isn't israel the 51th state?"
10828,Israel also had a very big lockdown and still has a lot of restrictions in and out of their country.

Last year there were multiple stories of Canadians continuing to travel to the US on holiday."

10883,"We already have the vaccine effectiveness data, and that included plenty of people who drank and smoked weed."
10884,Yes.
10885,I think it’s largely over in Canada on July 1.
10886,I expect flare ups later on that will scare the crap out of us but will add up to nothing once the dust settles.
10887,Agree that it doesn't make sense.
10888,I am hopeful that there will be some political pressure on the governors to start easing restrictions.
10889,"For starters, masks outside aren't necessary as noted by a couple of doctors who write for the New England Journal of Medicine, yet there's still an outdoor mask mandate."
10890,"Here’s another source for you

10891,The US plans to vaccinate healthy 18 year olds while still banning exports and still importing vaccines from other countries.
10892,The scientific term for this is a so-called dick move.
10893,Of course I don't expect geo-politics to be fair.
10894,"But the point is it's not geo-politics, it's just the US."
10895,Every other vaccine producing country still exports their vaccines and is actively supporting other countries.
10896,The US proves time and time again that they are not a reliable partner to the international community.
10897,At least Trump was up front about it.
10898,The US doesn't even contribute vaccines to COVAX which is a fucking disgrace.

10909,Cases not that different either.
10910,CA has very low cases right now cause they got pummeled bad for months.

10991,"Up to 362 from 301, out of a state population of 4.9m."
10992,0.007%
10993,It honestly was pretty cool to plan to feel like crap and follow through for a good cause.
10994,I stocked up on my fave foods and snacks and binged The Office.
10995,What difference is there?
10996,Except that the blood clots for J&amp;J are so rare that the benefits of taking the vaccine far outweigh the risks of getting covid.
10997,"If there are still enough older people to get the vaccine when it arrives, then they should definitely get it first, but I think getting it into as many people as fast as possible is vital for any chance to save any glimmer of a European summer."
10998,"Too much bureaucracy has already hurt Europe's vaccine rollout so much, the J&amp;J single-dose vaccine is their only real shot at getting out of it anytime soon."
10999,Shouldn't that have been the way the entire time to remove the political debate?
11000,"While we all argued all spring and summer long, the major box stores, grocery, and restaurants could have EASILY stepped up and mandated masks and the problem would have been largely solved-- nationwide."
11001,"Look it up, most major stores like Costco and Walmart waited until JULY 2020 to do this, and some later."
11002,It's amazing that people don't see that government mandates should be a last resort and it would be preferable for independent private business to dictate their own policies--which a lot of people are now claiming works cause they have no other explanation.
11003,"You can add the University of Chicago, Stanford and Duke."
11004,"End of the year likely for 5-11
Summer for 12-15"
11005,EU have supplied Japan with over 17.7 million doses so far.
11006,That’s not “virtually no supply”.
11007,I have a feeling that quite a few of the people in our vaccine effectiveness data smoked some weed soon after they got vaccinated.
11008,Offer free football tickets to get the vaccine.
11009,Then watch the lines.
11010,"i must be high, i thought 10-15 was a drug codeword like 420, i sat here wondering if it was some form of E or Coke or something."
11011,took about 5 minutes before realizing you meant 10 year olds - 15 year olds.
11012,This is perhaps the least surprising thing I have read all week.
11013,I really don’t understand why any state would end their mask mandate before they have vaccinated enough of their population to see low case positivity.
11014,Because the US is one of the only countries still trying to block IP law.
11015,Biden keeps kicking the can down the line.
11016,"It’s important to remember that the longer the virus festers around, the more likely it is more variants come into play."
11017,"And some poor countries aren’t expected to be starting vaccinations until 2024....

We can also thanks bill gates for closing off the Oxford vaccine for open access world wide."
11018,But let’s just add another article which praises him.
11019,"If that's true, then why can't we just do this everywhere?"
11020,That's the part where they lose people when they explain why the mask mandates being lifted do not have the effect they claim it will.

11052,*
11053,Perhaps you are an outlier.
11054,Have you been personally impacted?
11055,I know several people who have died from it and plenty that have gotten seriously ill.
11056,It is not a disease I would wish on anybody.
11057,Especially if they are vulnerable.
11058,Is there withdrawal?
11059,And does that also count for CBD oil?
11060,I’ve been taking pretty high doses for pain management and went off it cold Turkey for 36 hours to recalibrate pain...
11061,"I felt like shit, chattering and throwing up."
11062,Just curious cause that was weird and I didn’t think CBD did that.
11063,Wrong.
11064,In any sort of non-democracy stupid people get promoted into powerful positions precisely because they don’t think for themselves.
11065,"Then when something serious happens, for instance a pandemic, all they can do is pretend it doesn’t exist as long as possible which makes everything worse for everyone."
11066,The problem is the same in both dictatorships like China and in corrupt democracies like Brazil or the US under T****.
11067,Lack of accountability kills.
11068,Seems like one of the good things about having had the flu in the last few years is that the vaccine side effects probably won’t phase me too much.
11069,I’ve had the flu destroy me for 4 days at a time; 1 day seems like nothing.
11070,"Of course, let’s see how much I whine about it when I get my second shot in a few days."
11071,&gt;  I think we only recently hit 50% of the population has at least 1 shot.
11072,"Will we even get to ""herd immunity"" ?."
11073,.I have serious doubts.
11074,"(at least not through vaccination)
&gt; 

You say this as if 50% isn't a lot.... but its literally half of adults with strong protection from the virus."
11075,+ another few % that have already had it.
11076,+ the vaccination rate has been increasing and at worst has been lingering around 3m (1% total population) administered per day.
11077,&gt; Sadly..
11078,"I think the ""long tail"" of Covid19 working it's way through the population and either killing off (or causing long term health effects).. is probably still the most likely outcome."
11079,I think you are dramatically overestimating the death/severe case frequency
11080,My understanding is some people get really sick when their immune system revs up.
11081,Others don't.
11082,Most people seem to be tired after shot 2 but not everyone.
11083,Some feel fine and some awful.
11084,Sour grapes is a great watch if you feel the same.
11085,"We're the battery, man!"
11086,But wasn’t there a study on vaccinated healthcare workers that showed the vaccine was extremely effective at preventing you from getting Covid where they tested them weekly?
11087,"The US is more than California, PNW, NYC, and DC."
11088,Affordable housing is definitely out there
11089,tbh not exactly sure but i'd do a day or two at least if you can.
11090,not day of for sure.
11091,i wouldn't sweat it if you smoke a little ways before.
11092,what matters most is trying to abstain as much as possible in that two week frame.
11093,"I’m only familiar with Michigan, but yeah."
11094,"Back when we were doing really well, back in June, some policies were lifted shortly after being implemented, even though they were originally going to go for several weeks."
11095,"Also while this isn’t a re-opening policy per se, vaccine availability has been much faster than originally planned and that moved policy forward too."
11096,"But I only really know Michigan, and we’ve not really set concrete dates for things we can’t know here."
11097,"That’s my guess on why this date is so far out - Whitmer knows we’ll be back to normal **months** before this date, and so this is classic “under-promise, over-deliver”"
11098,Why not?
11099,"Guys guys guys, hold on.... 

I’m a potato 🥔"
11100,This guy markets.
11101,"Damn it, I'm in Canada where we don't have free joints OR vaccines."
11102,FUCK!
11103,I think I might be an outlier but I have never felt even slightly afraid of COVID.
11104,The experience for me during this pandemic has been an annoyance with the various restrictions and confusion about what everyone was so afraid of.
11105,When I saw the average age of death back in January of 2020 I decided it was not a big deal.
11106,Not saying I am right or wrong but those are just my feelings on the situation.
11107,I think this is pretty ridiculous.
11108,There's only so many viable forms it can take and every one we have seen so far has been cross reactive to the others in at least some way.
11109,"It remains a possibility a worse variant could emerge, but that would be vaccinated in less time than the OG COVID."
11110,"The article even says that while babies are testing positive, they’re cases are almost always under control and “rarely turn fatal.”

No one believes that 0 kids will die from COVID, just that the disease disproportionately impacts the elderly and is no more of a threat to children than, say, the flu."
11111,"In India, I’m sure there are even more dangerous communicable diseases that children are regularly exposed to."
11112,The media focuses on very rare severe cases in children to drum up hysteria.
11113,Brewed and overcooked long ago
11114,I sharted while peeing years ago.

11126,100 million a month starting in September gets every Indian vaccinated in September 2022.

11128,"Hey man, just to be clear, vaccine lessens your of getting a ***severe infection and doesn't provide you with a 100 percentage protection***

Please look for vaccine efficacy and also note that it is providing considerable protection against mutant strains too."
11129,I don’t know what planet you’re from but 18-year-olds wanting to party are not pushing themselves to the front of the line to get vaccinated in any country.
11130,It’s funny though you say it’s because the “18-year-old American brat” can’t be arsed to wear a mask for another month but are perfectly content with letting 60-year-olds get sick because they refuse to wear a mask.
11131,"It’s only the “American brat” you assign agency to and then only to establish a villain 

This is pure xenophobia."
11132,"Pfizer is already reusing things that are designed to be single-use, things that most manufacturers of aren’t in the US and even in the cases when they are, they’re multinational companies with factories in other countries, too

You’re not mad at Ireland because they’re not exporting enough bioreactor bags."
11133,You’re not mad at China for not exporting enough bioreactor bags.

You’re not mad about insufficient supplies."

11146,I’m sincerely worried about or future if this is who you trust for medical opinion
11147,&gt;Lockdowns + diverting all of their vaccines bound to the world to their citizens will hopefully do the trick but it’s going to be many more months of death.
11148,It's too late on the vaccine front.
11149,They already exported half their production and are currently facing shortages due to western countries prioritizing precursors for their own production.
11150,India could source those vaccine components from China but I think the modi government would rather collapse than do that.
11151,Every week the German government spins the wheel and sees what demographic can be vaccinated.
11152,I think that's in the ballpark.
11153,"The antibody # might be a little high as I mentioned, but I think it is safe to assume that we are at 60+% protected with plenty more vaccinations to go."
11154,99% sure I read that mRNA Vaccines were primarily being researched initially as an HIV Hail Mary that never panned out.

11157,How is it irrelevant when talking about vaccine efficiency?

11185,There never were production facilities capable of producing those amounts.
11186,AZ needed all european facilities and until end of Q1 instead of end of Q3 2020 to produce 40 mil doses in total (EU+UK).
11187,Only because they sold 30 mil doses by September does not mean they could produce them.
11188,Again: According to the EU and the subcontractors of AZ there are NO shortfalls in production in the EU.

11232,The beginning of the trial is looking for symptoms after injection.
11233,They have the data for the 2/3 that were given the vaccination and can compare it to the 1/3 that got the placebo as designed in the study.
11234,The 2nd part of the research is checking antibody levels periodically over the next 2 years (or do) and ifentifying breakthrough Covid infection and they can measure the viral load in the nose by swabbing those who were infected but vaccinated to get more info if it’s even possible to spread Covid once vaccinated.
11235,"I’m primates, it showed very little to no virus is the nose - now we need to observe it in humans."
11236,"By vaccinating the last 1/3 trial participants, now they will have more data in that regards."
11237,We already know vaccinated people are going to get Covid if exposed.
11238,Not vaccinating them (or having them unblind because now they can get an approved vaccine) does not give us pertinent information after the first round of shots were given and side effects were measured.
11239,Plus who wants extra unvaccinated people walking around who are otherwise able to get it.

11245,I know the vaccine can't cause someone to get infected but have there been any cases where someone has got infected from the vaccine clinic?
11246,From what I've seen they are run really clean and strict.
11247,UK was the first to do it.
11248,Canada already implemented it in nationwide March though Quebec started doing it in January.
11249,About 90% of our shots are first doses.
11250,I meant that there are enough vaccines to do that by mid-July.
11251,While the first days of July every willing adult a first dose comes from a model of actually given shots.
11252,There is a big difference between given shots and delivered shots.
11253,"Vaccines get delivered, then have to go through quality check for a couple of days."
11254,"Then they go into a sort of ""emergency stock"" for some days."
11255,After that they go into available stock.
11256,"After a place is found for the vaccines, it will be delivered to and stored at the place where they will be used."
11257,And then they will be used.
11258,"This whole process took 3 to 4 weeks a while ago, currently this has been brought back to 1 to 2 weeks."

11308,"The dad and coworker are doctors which is why they were vaccinated, and also likely how they were exposed."
11309,&gt;After problems at first.
11310,That's the point...
11311,The UK could have had around 30 million doses if everything went well in September last year.
11312,But it took time for the production to be optimised to what it is now.
11313,"Hence why the UK has given out 40+ million doses, the majority being AZ."
11314,Vaccine production takes time to perfect and the other production sites across the world will improve with time.
11315,"It may not have spread as quickly, but once it enters a country, it would still spread."
11316,People still traveled internationally back then even without a World War being involved.
11317,"You’re the one that seems to whine, I’m merely saying the truth."
11318,Here is a better comparison of the population for two states of similar climate since temperature has a huge effect on spread.
11319,"March 1 2021:
S Dakota: 13% confirmed, 52% had Covid*
Michigan: 6.5% confirmed, 26% had Covid

*relies on CDC’s estimate that there are three unconfirmed cases per confirmed 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

With poor testing, SD is likely closer to 60% while MI is closer to 20% back in March, but that is speculation without enough available fine-grain data."
11320,"Anyway, a vast majority of people in S Dakota who did not socially distance came down with Covid and no longer spread the virus."
11321,A significant fraction of people in Michigan can spread the disease and many gave up their social isolation this Spring before the vaccine was widely available to the high-transmitters.
11322,Hence the MI spike when the more infectious variants came to the United States.
11323,Hope this is a politics-free fair comparison based on proven facts and the CDC’s best estimate on the true extent of the pandemic.
11324,"I am going to get lots of hate comments and might get banned by the mods, but everything is as factual and unbiased as I can get."
11325,"I am not judging which state is better, just sad that the Michiganders couldn’t wait for another couple months to save grandma."
11326,I can bet there's alot more then that
11327,Canada has adopted a first dose strategy.
11328,25% of Canadians have received at least one dose.
11329,Which is about 30ish percent of the eligible population.
11330,there is no way they will vaccinate people fast enough to make a difference in the immediate term.

11334,I'm on the reserve list for when it becomes available again.
11335,I'll also book in for appointments at other vaccine centers once they become available and cancel if they don't have my preferred vaccine available.
11336,"Well and the urban (SF and LA) areas have lower rates than the rural and San Joaquin Valley, so I'm guessing last year's infections in those heavily hit urban areas are also keeping rates low."
11337,It has - if everything went right the UK could have had around millions of doses in storage before approval.
11338,"But production for the plants producing for the UK had issues at the start and are now, as you say are producing 2 mil a week which is far from measly."
11339,"Hence why the UK has given over 40 million doses, the majority being AZ."
11340,"Here’s the thing, we actually know how to treat the AZ blood clots and we know to look out for them."
11341,If you or anyone else gets the AZ vaccine watch out for the symptoms of a blood clot and get your ass to an ER ASAP.
11342,Tell the doctors that you got the AZ vaccine and they can save your life.
11343,"If you get Covid you might die or you might live, but straight up, we can’t actually treat or cute Covid, we just support patients and wait for their body to kill the infection."

11350,Or did you mean fully vaccinate as in finish administering the first shot to this group?
11351,Just because the FDA has approved a drug or biologic for production doesn't mean that a company is actually *authorized* to *produce* the drug or biologic.
11352,The FDA has to inspect and license the facility for production.
11353,"Additionally, just because an approved biologic has been made in an approved facility, that doesn't mean the company can actually *distribute* or sell the biologic."
11354,"The company has to run a bunch of tests on every single batch they make, the test results are run past company scientists, then the test results and samples from the batch are sent to the FDA."
11355,"It's only *after* the FDA's scientists have reviewed the test results, and optionally run their own sets of tests on the samples, and the FDA scientists agree that the test results are acceptable, that the FDA will give approval for the biologic to be distributed and sold."
11356,Source: I was on the team that wrote the systems tracking the approval of drugs and facilities and monitoring the status of different batches of drugs.
11357,"Please note that I have no direct insight as to what's happening with this specific plant, nor do I know production monitoring systems outside of the US, but I can assure you there's absolutely no chance that any vaccines made in that plant will be legally released in the US."
11358,"Alright I didn’t know that, thank you!"

11435,"I guess they want to blame someone, but the AZ doses in the US amount to about one week's supply in the US, and India has 4x the population."
11436,If they were vaccinating at the same rate as the US it would be 2 days supply.
11437,This is like owing $100k in debt and getting mad at your brother in law because he won't give you $100.
11438,&gt;Ah yes the right way.
11439,Be super slow on pre-ordering vaccines and then use your clout to bully your way to the front of the line anyway via export bans.
11440,If you fuck something up you should absolutely fix the issue through whatever means necessary if you have the ability to.
11441,Especially when you have the worst outbreak in the world in nominal terms.
11442,"&gt;The lipids for the mRNA vaccines come from the EU, UK, and Canada."
11443,You're confusing where the companies that produce the lipids are headquartered with where the production is.
11444,There are several facilities producing lipids in the US.
11445,CordenPharma for example has a plant in Colorado.
11446,Croda has one in Alabama from a US company it acquired last year in anticipation of need.
11447,"You also confuse me for someone being a hypocrite on this issue: I'm also a German dual citizen and wouldn't complain about an EU, Indian, or UK export ban."
11448,&gt;It's also interesting to see how thrilled Americans are that their country imposed an export ban on private companies.
11449,I guess people suddenly like Communism when it's convenient.
11450,I'm the last person who would call government intervention or export bans Communism.
11451,National emergencies call for the marshaling of all resources available in the country and this is the worst one our country has faced since World War 2.
11452,I also don't believe in helping those who spend 4 years laughing at our misfortune and then turn around to ask for us to be a good neighbor.
11453,No it’s really not.
11454,Both the numbers are within the CI’s of each other
11455,Damn really?
11456,I thought the biggest source would be British people swimming across the Atlantic.
11457,Unfortunately this is going to be a politicized issue and hard to get good studies on it.
11458,"It seems like the lockdowns were not actually as necessary based on how similar states like Texas and California looked, but it will be hard to present that data without conservatives gleefully declaring that they were right all along."
11459,"Sure, once the US is there, which it ain’t."
11460,People were shitting on the US long ago over this topic when the numbers weren’t even close to caught up.
11461,"People are mad their country isn’t helping them out as well as the US, after shitting on the US the last year."
11462,"It’s tired and annoying at this point, and shows me these propels that think they are high and mighty because they aren’t America are every bit as bad as the Americans they mock."
11463,Do you not think that policy decisions lag conversations in the medical community...?
11464,Got my 2nd shot today.
11465,When will covid be over?
11466,However the FDA is unlikely to approve it for US unless trials are done locally and that will be difficult since people are getting vaccinated.

11471,I'm not trying to convince anybody to wear one...
11472,I'm simply stating why they think that way because I disagree with the article's premise.
11473,"Have you ever tried to convince somebody to quit smoking or quit drinking, that their religion is wrong, that the world is NOT flat, that they did go to the moon, or a host of other conspiracies that people believe in?!"
11474,So why would I try to convince people to wear a mask when I know they have the same mindset?!
11475,Good luck with that.
11476,"I did NOT miss the point, that's the point."

11491,"True, just reiterating that there are lots of us out there who are ready  to ditch masks."
11492,"But yes, the most important group is the people who don't see any benefit to getting vaccinated because all the same restrictions will still be in place."
11493,I'm envious of your pace.
11494,"I think regardless of how one felt about the US' export ban initially, there's a strong argument to be made that it should be relaxed soon."
11495,The US is starting to reach the point where supply exceeds demand.
11496,Once the US is producing vaccines faster than it can consume them and it has amassed a comfortable stockpile (a few weeks of supply?
11497,"), I don't think there's a defensible reason not to start exporting the surplus to countries with much greater need."
11498,Oh you are right - me bad - I was confusing the two.
11499,I did check the product information for Janssen and this one seems to be using the Emergent plant.
11500,Just such a dumb decision to prolong that tbh.
11501,Thanks!
11502,"I agree, this is the right thing to do for everyone’s sake."
11503,"I know people who don’t want the vaccine and I tell them that’s their choice, but it may just be a matter of time before they get exposed to the virus, since it’s not disappearing."
11504,They’re raw dogging the pandemic.
11505,Since there is a lot of vaccine hesitancy it seems that it would make more sense to use the more effective vaccines.
11506,"I think a lot of people have forgotten about mutations, and the fact that these vaccines don't necessarily work against those mutations."
11507,Getting a vaccine isn't the end of COVID.
11508,Amazing how civil the discussion is compared to similar proposals in states like FL or TX.
11509,"&gt; For official border crossing needs, I wonder if they couldn't require all US crossers to show proof of vaccination, or an antibody test showing past infection."
11510,Truckers.
11511,"Yeah, that's what I meant by disposal."
11512,That's going to bite us in the ass down the line.
11513,I thought my area would be back to normal by June but now the mayor is saying we need to have 50 percent vaccinated to ditch the masks and we are only at 30 percent with very little demand for vaccines left.
11514,In any case I'm ditching masks on memorial day.
11515,I'm over it.
11516,How does the benefit of hindsight explain the CDC saying it can’t be spread by vaccinated people then walking it back the next day?
11517,"This is the problem, the messaging is based on trying to illicit a certain outcome rather than just telling the truth."
11518,That doesn’t work because eventually people catch on and don’t trust you anymore.
11519,"Combination of:

* generally not being hit by a Christmas wave when every other state was, so in a way they were due for a wave
* things being more relaxed and people really starting to go out more/pandemic fatigue
* B117 variant"
11520,"Oh god, yes I see it now."
11521,I quickly went through the article with 2 graphs in the back of my mind (which showed that China had both produced and exported more vaccines and is planning to produce a huge amount of vaccines this year).
11522,So I just assumed that while quickly going through the article.
11523,So this is all the vaccines Sinovac produced.
11524,"260 million in total, 156 million exported and 104 million own use."
11525,The other 100 million vaccines China has used must have been from Sinopharm or any other Chinese vaccine manufacturer.
11526,"Sinopharm has exported quite a lot as well, but do not have exact figures on that."
11527,So the production from this vaccine and possibly others make up for the rest.
11528,"No, this is Catalent Maryland, not Emergent in Baltimore."
11529,[deleted]
11530,Exactly.
11531,Osterholm has spent the entire pandemic pretending like the worst possible outcome is also the most likely outcome.
11532,"Seems like he got a little overconfident with his category 5 Covid hurricane prediction though, as he was screaming about it from the rooftops until he realized he was wrong."
11533,Haven't heard from him since..
11534,"Yes we will, the UK government will always put their citizens before the rest of the world as they should"
11535,[removed]
11536,Does Ocygen has their own manufacturing plant already?
11537,What about fill-finish?
11538,Anything lying around has probably already been retooled for some existing vaccines.
11539,Sounds like a pretty normal progression for someone who got a mild case.
11540,I'd assume you had it.
11541,Take a test if it really makes a difference in how you'd act.
11542,I wouldn't.
11543,preach.
11544,I wish they would understand this.
11545,"Just like masks, the concern of people hoarding them versus getting people to wear them was such a massive fuck up."
11546,I feel they're doing it again with this.
11547,Friend of mine is in the air right now going there to help his parents who both have it.
11548,I am not sure why people really thought it wouldn't be a problem there.
11549,It's the perfect place for the spread of something like this.
11550,I just hope that they can deal with it.
11551,I have friends flying over there this week to be with their parents and relatives etc.
11552,Probably pretty tough situation there.
11553,"&gt;	and just any provider in low demand states to get it, rather than just these mass sites."
11554,"Wait, what providers aren’t getting it yet?"
11555,The mass sites help get a lot of people through but they’ve been shipping them directly to pharmacies for quite a while now
11556,[removed]
11557,Might I suggest India and Brazil
11558,I have to admit that these numbers are already higher than I thought they would be.
11559,I thought demand would taper off at about 60-65%.
11560,Looks like 65+ is slowing down at about 80% and we should see a big surge in other age groups starting this week.
11561,[deleted]
11562,If you live in the UK you live in a rich enough country to afford Moderna/Pfizer
11563,Which is absolutely completed irrelevant here!
11564,It also depends on state mask mandates though.
11565,"In california they are talking about keeping that in effect even when all other restrictions are dropped, and I know some other states are planning that as well."
11566,"I suppose it depends on the person, but me and my wife got our 2nd the same day (2 days ago) basically just a couple hours apart."
11567,"The night of started the symptoms: Chills, body aches, headaches, hallucinations, basically a bad head cold type of feeling."
11568,"Next day was aweful haha We have 3 kids, and we regretted getting ours at the same time haha."
11569,"Day 3, today, im good."
11570,"Head is still a little fuzzy, but im 10x better."
11571,This is all for the greater cause and I would much rather have had this over Covid any day of the week!
11572,Just be prepared for the worst so you dont have any surprises haha
11573,This whole thing of knowing one thing about a person and being able to judge them has been so weird to me.
11574,Like yeah you may not wear a mask but you’re the owner of a rescue shelter.
11575,Or yeah you wear a mask but you beat your wife and kids.
11576,National chains like Target won't drop mask mandates for quite some time.
11577,They'll do it when they can drop them country-wide to avoid having a patchwork of restrictions.
11578,What do people like me deserve?
11579,To catch COVID and die?
11580,"Here’s what I really don’t understand about people of your kin, what exactly do you want?"
11581,Cases to hit 0 forever?
11582,Because that’s not gonna happen.
11583,Do you just want life to be like this forever so everyone can be closer to as miserable and sad as you are?
11584,"Like, what’s your endgame?"
11585,"Because, truthfully, I just want to go out to dinner with my friends and not have it be some giant pre production before I can get a cocktail and some pasta..."
11586,Great source.
11587,Have you seen evidence of any major outbreaks from the last NFL season allowing limited in person fans?
11588,No I have numbers for hospital admissions and deaths.
11589,Just like soothsayers and prophets that predict the future... nobody keeps track of their predictions but if they happen to be right once they're geniuses.
11590,Yet my question still stands
11591,because 50% of their population is under 25 years old
11592,There are lots of logistical challenges every year we face.
11593,"It just has to be a new normal, until this thing is gone."
11594,And soon to be the lowest point since the beginning of all this once our 7 day average goes below 600/day (not too much longer).
11595,This has nothing to do with pharmaceutical companies.
11596,"The vaccination is administered by public health care workers, and the data is collected by them too."
11597,Gevernments in Europe seem quite open about wanting a treatment that can save as many lives as possible and avoid any unnecessary deaths.
11598,Your chances of getting covid after mrna vaccination are 90-95% lower than they would be if you weren't vaccinated.
11599,"Your chances of getting severe covid, dying, or spreading it to someone else vaccinated are 99%+ lower."
11600,[deleted]
11601,"Oh, you have numbers for symptomatic infection?!"
11602,Vaccinated people won't even get tested if they have a mild case.
11603,"It will probably be a domino effect, as soon as the first grocery store says 'fuck it' all others will soon follow, hopefully in the US at least that'll happen by July"
11604,"It's actually Dutch :) the vaccine was partly developed in Leiden, the Netherlands."
11605,IDK how the company is organized exactly but I think Janssen is the dutch subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson.
11606,&gt;Last year there were multiple stories of Canadians continuing to travel to the US on holiday.
11607,"The US treated them better than Canada for sure, they are now coming back with a tan and fully vaccinated, didn't have to go through the BS in Canada all winter and they still have to quarantine ..."
11608,Lol I know right?
11609,- I am simply 100% serious about knowing how well this worked because it was one fascinating article and neat idea and they're all background checked as being solid smart people.
11610,"Yup, that's me."
11611,I'm fully vaccinated and only wearing it because I have to and I don't want to end up in a fight at a grocery store.
11612,The social pressure is real.
11613,I'd drop it in a heartbeat if someone told me I could.
11614,Pfizer and Moderna?
11615,"No, I’m pretty sure they will get full FDA approval at some point."
11616,They’ve been extraordinarily safe so far.
11617,Don’t know about J&amp;J though.
11618,It's probably safest to assume it's Covid until you can get a test.
11619,"Hopefully the vaccine will have had some time to work, it usually starts giving some protection around 14 days so it might make it less severe for them."
11620,Keep monitoring them and try and get to medical advice if concerned.
11621,Stay well.
11622,[removed]
11623,Watched a replay of that just the other day.
11624,Hope nobody got fired to hide anything this time.
11625,They won't be able to get FDA approval with the side effects and deaths that occurred.
11626,They will not want to be open to being sued.
11627,We will need people vaccinated under the emergency order before lifting it.
11628,Yeah your chance of getting it depends both on how effective the vaccine is.
11629,And how prevalent the virus is.
11630,And how frequent your exposure to potentially infected people.
11631,If we were being reasonable we'd strictly limit the movement of willfully unvaccinated people.
11632,[deleted]
11633,This is not true.
11634,Ocugen has been in contact with the FDA since January about this and the India trials have been done in accordance with FDA guidelines.
11635,This is not Bharat Biotech's first FDA vaccine.
11636,"FDA has already said they would accept those trial results and Ocugen's Senior VP for Regulatory and Quality worked for the FDA ""Office of Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics at the U.S. FDA, where he received several awards, including the CDER Outstanding Reviewer Award, FDA Outstanding Achievement Award, and Awards of Excellence""

There are still some Americans who may not have been receptive to an mRNA vaccine but could be interested in a more traditional vaccine."
11637,This is the first right step this incompetent government did in the last 6 months
11638,[deleted]
11639,[removed]
11640,Behaving like spoiled brats.
11641,"""BUT MUUUUUUUUUM WHY CAN HE HAVE IT AND I CAN'T???"""
11642,"Some of that is not necessarily BS, there have been cases of people getting it after the vaccine, they are not nearly as ill as they would have been otherwise."
11643,We MIGHT need booster shots ... do not know yet.
11644,[removed]
11645,Exoect it to have problems with deliveries too.
11646,All vaccines fight for the same resources currently.
11647,"If you look up any data on what the mrna vaccines are doing to neutralizing antibodies over time (like do a Google search, pre-prints or peer reviewed, its all showing similar results), while it steadily declines over time it remains far(very far) elevated compared to what is seen from natural infection."
11648,"While not enough time has passed yet to assess what this will be like in the long term, it seems apparent that variants evading immunity will become a problem long before waning immunity will."
11649,But that's mostly because the virus is spreading around the world infecting so many people at a rapid pace.
11650,Once the pace of infections slows down so will the genetic diversification of the virus slow down .
11651,How long did everything take to do?
11652,"simple, from cockmeat sandwiches"
11653,NC resident here.
11654,I'm super happy Gov.
11655,Cooper is being more forward-thinking than the CDC/Dr.Fauci in regards to lifting COVID restrictions and the mask mandate.
11656,This announcement should create way more incentive for people to get vaccinated than what is currently being put forth by the federal government.
11657,I can use this to help sway some people I know that haven't gotten vaccinated yet to go ahead and do so.

11660,I've noticed my middle schoolers are having a harder time distinguishing between the /f/ and /th/ phonemes.

11662,"If they're really struggling, I'll give them a keyword ("" /f/ as in fun"")."
11663,"It's not the end of the world, but it's certainly another unexpected hiccup."
11664,"""Most of those who were infected with the coronavirus despite being vaccinated did not develop symptoms or require hospitalization, but one vaccinated individual, who was a resident of the nursing home, died, according to the study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
11665,"Altogether, 26 facility residents were infected, including 18 who had been vaccinated, and 20 health care personnel were infected, including four who had been vaccinated."

11672,Don't be silly.
11673,AZ works pretty well.
11674,"2/3 reduction in preventing symptomatic infection, and nearly 100% effective in reducing risk of severe infection (hospitalization/injury/death)."
11675,"Sure, given the all-else-being-equal choice of AZ and an mRNA vaccine I'd go with the mRNA, but everything is not equal globally."
11676,"&gt; I feel comfortable relaxing precautions, but still wear a mask when out in a crowded group setting."
11677,why do you still wear a mask in crowded setting?
11678,Are you trying to be polite or do you not feel 100% certain of the vaccine effectiveness?
11679,[removed]
11680,[removed]
11681,They don’t have the demand for it.
11682,"The article says that 170,000 tickets were sold and 33,000 have been returned thus far, which puts you pretty close to that 135k number."
11683,"Regardless, I’m happy to say I’ll be one of the 135,000 in attendance."
11684,Fully vaccinated and masked up of course!
11685,Is your kid immunocompromised as well?
11686,If not then your child is not in danger from covid anyways
11687,"Philadelphia: FEMA vaccination site got to the point they go out and grab pedestrians, I guess that's what phase 2 means, I expected a flood of people to get vaccinated, apparently anyone who wanted to get vaccinated already got vaccinated during phase 1b."
11688,Good luck getting to that magical 70% herd immunity maybe in 2025
11689,"Nothing is wrong with it, just like there’s also nothing wrong with *not* doing more than needed, which is why the dirty looks should stop for people who aren’t virtue signaling."
11690,I think it is also more to prevent the virus from mutating to something MUCH more deadly.
11691,The virus is already mutating to where it is attacking children.
11692,"Death is not the only result, we have yet to see the destruction we are going to see from the long term effects."

11694,"That makes like zero sense, why are they closed wtf"
11695,Congrats on your vaccination !
11696,Well not exactly.
11697,The problem India has is not Manufacturing of vaccines but the logistics of how/when/where to make it accessible to general public.
11698,Especially in rural areas.
11699,"&gt;To add to this, US has loaned out 4M doses but is   
&gt;  
&gt;sitting on ""tens of millions"" as of March  
&gt;  
&gt;."
11700,"So yeah, a lot more the US can be doing."
11701,"We're already starting to hit the point where supply outstrips demand, so I don't know how anyone can justify the US sitting on AZ."
11702,I don't think AZ has a very good reputation as a vaccine right now.
11703,The sun is bright
11704,"Won’t even lie, I don’t know."
11705,"In Texas some small businesses have opted to still keep the restrictions, which is in their full right."
11706,I’d say maybe around summer time as more and more people get vaccinated.
11707,Went to Kroger not long ago and saw a Decent amount of people not wearing masks
11708,"I wonder if part of the reason for this is that OR and WA are much more like a handful of liberal, urban areas smothered by rural, conservative areas."
11709,"CA has rural areas that resist vaccines and masking as well, but they're further afield and less likely to see as much travel between areas."
11710,"That could have nothing to do with it, but, as someone who lives north of Redding and in a troublesome area, I do wonder about that."
11711,Who said it would be easy?
11712,Going to the moon wasn't easy.
11713,Fighting wars wasn't easy (any of them).
11714,"We do lots of hard things, some are worth doing, some are not, but how hard they are is not a factor in if we should do them."
11715,Sure but oxford... you mean the guys trying to save face because their adenovirus based vaccine is crap like all other adenovirus based meds before?
11716,That study is ridiculously flawed btw.
11717,Maybe that will help our government use the 2M doses they have in storage before they get swamped with new deliveries.
11718,We have dropped to one of the last places when it comes to speed of vaccination because our government can't into logistics.
11719,That’s true about all workplaces.
11720,What are these anti vaxxers gonna do if basically all jobs require it?
11721,As of December they had bought fewer vaccines than Germany.
11722,It's in the article.
11723,[removed]
11724,"Meanwhile other “experts” keep pushing people to stay inside even while fully vaccinated, my dad was watching a YouTube video of a doctor last night who was talking about effectiveness of the coronavac (sinovac) vaccine and said you should still go out as little as possible and still wear masks and social distance from everyone at all times even if you’re fully vaccinated cause you might still die, my parents have gotten both doses and it was so discouraging for them to hear those words."
11725,I understand doctors and experts have a lot of weight on them and must think before speaking but still making people who are fully vaccinated scared of going out is not fair.
11726,Yeah I'm kind of wondering if they haven't because in theory wouldn't that mean Pfizer and Moderna's purchases might be cut in half?
11727,If only half the amount was required?
11728,"I've seen numbers as high as 80-85% for dose one,  but we don't really know how long term that is."
11729,Regardless it's weird they haven't looked into it more considering J&amp;J is mid 60s.
11730,I know it's not a 1:1 fair comparison but point being one dose seems to show a high level of efficacy for at least some period of time.

11733,So far most mass vaccination clinics are getting people to come in.
11734,"Mass clinics are the most efficient way to get people vaccinated, so as long as we can get people to come to them  we should push them."
11735,Once people aren't making appointment to the clinics we need to drop down to something that is more walk-in friendly.

11931,25% of Canadians have had a vaccine now compared to 40% of Americans so it's not like we're terribly far behind.
11932,March 25th was the date the US passed 25% so Canada is literally 4 weeks behind but at a faster pace than the US was then.

11962,I don't think there would be much backlash if we instituted this policy for visitors (non-US citizens).
11963,This would reduce the possibility of variants and strains that can bypass the vaccine.

11967,I think there are a number of paths we could have taken that could have helped.
11968,"The path we settled on was probably among the worst, as the  deliberate skepticism of science and public health expertise and the tribalism associated with taking the pandemic seriously or disrupting it are directly responsible for some of the vaccine hesitancy we are dealing with now."
11969,Same.
11970,I’m vaccinated but I have immuno compromised fam.
11971,I can’t really relax until we are at 60% fully vaccinated.
11972,Exactly.
11973,People who are comfortable doing things just have a different sense of the risk.

11979,The CDC for months said “masks don’t help” yet it’s a disease that spread from the respiratory system.
11980,Anyone with any sense of critical thinking should have guessed a mask would 100% help reduce risk of catching / spreading.

11994,How many tests can they do each day?
11995,"As fast as it’s growing, we might see a false plateau if it gets beyond their ability to keep up."
11996,I don't get the argument.
11997,"Even if the vaccines stopped tomorrow, most of those who are the most vulnerable have received their vaccine, and those who didn't get them would eventually spread the virus around enough that it would burn itself out."
11998,"It would take longer, for sure, and more would die, but 100k+ deaths isn't even possible unless the virus mutates to something beyond current immunity every year, in which case the current rollout in the US wouldn't fix that anyway."

12040,"If you're comparing urban areas, it probably makes sense to include the rest of the SF Bay area, as opposed to just San Francisco county."

I apologize and know this isn't in place of a medical professional to ask but my GP retired and I wanted to get the vaccine before going to see a new one."
12101,I am scheduled for a vaccine 1st dose tomorrow at 4:30.
12102,I had a migraine this afternoon at around 1:30.
12103,Reading articles that say you should not take any aspirin or Tylenol which are in the OTC migraine relief.
12104,Is 24 hours enough time or should I cancel for a few days?
12105,Thanks
12106,I see you've just jumped ship to another forum to lie there.
12107,You really have no conscience do you?
12108,"You've been delivered multiple citations clearly demonstrating how wrong you are, and all you do is hop, skip, jump somewhere else and perpetuate the same lie there."
12109,There's a lot you can whinge about in the program but when you can look on the [government website](https://www.gov.pl/web/szczepimysie/raport-szczepien-przeciwko-covid-19) and see the precise figures you can't spread lies like that.
12110,There's 450k in storage precisely for moments like these with Astrazeneca and the rest are either ready to be jabbed or in transit.
12111,There's about 900k doses not ready to be jabbed which is one weeks worth of Pfizer deliveries which arrive at the beginning of the week.
12112,I think cases will need to drop another 75% from their present level.
12113,I’m gonna guess 6 weeks.
12114,It is the most accurate word to someone with the qualifications to understand properly what it means.
12115,"But when Joe Schmoe hears you talking about ""mutant"" covid versions, he is not going to think what you are thinking."
12116,"Hence why the word in reality is not the best to use, even though in a vacuum it might be."

12118,"But sure whatever, you're doing God's work!"
12119,"True, but California's vaccination rate isn't substantially better than most other states."
12120,The success is likely due to good social distancing / mask wearing behavior following the big Dec/Jan spike.
12121,My guess is that it's easier to have a standard hospital procedure rather than individualized.
12122,"Also, there isn't currently a great way of looking up someone's vaccination status beyond the card so it would be difficult to verify when someone's status while in an emergency situation."
12123,[removed]
12124,You sound like you are in your 20s and fully vaccinated and still wearing a mask and face shield.
12125,Honestly you might want to seek some mental help more than anything.
12126,You literally have a higher chance of death or hospitalization in a car than you do from covid right now.
12127,Maybe time to re-adjust and go back to living a normal life.
12128,"If vaccine cards/proof of vaccination became mandated as an evolution from mask-wearing and social distancing mandates, that might help \*some\* on the fence."
12129,"Of course you'd get the same folks who didn't want to wear a mask bellyaching over needing a vaccine to attend an event, see a movie, eat inside a restaurant, etc; and several states have already dismissed the concept outright."
12130," From the way Fauci was talking in his last interview about the CDC revisiting guidelines for vaccinated people completely turning us loose might come sooner than later
 
 They may be realizing giving that incentive of ""okay, get the shots and you can just p**s off back to pre-covid behavior"" is what it will take to combat vaccine hesitancy."
12131,Made the random decision to try attending it this year.
12132,Think I might actually enjoy it if it's not a sellout zoo.
12133,Funding.
12134,"No doses, exactly."
12135,And how much did the US export?
12136,"There is an effective ban, call it what you want, the effect is the same."
12137,Not in places with enforced mask mandates.
12138,"I know in Washington, it would be weird to see people unmasked in public."
12139,Next week it will be two weeks after my 2nd vaccine.
12140,"At which point, masking is mostly theater."

12143,Good news!
12144,"California has been continually lifting restrictions, and has plans to lift more."
12145,"I feel pretty safe for myself, but there's no good way to indicate to the public that you're vaccinated, and I think in those settings to continue setting a good example, everyone should be masked."
12146,"It's also not clear to me whether there's a risk of me being a carrier to someone unvaccinated even if I am protected, so in case of that, I wear a mask."
12147,"End of May seems extremely unlikely, given that only 26% of us are fully vaccinated at this point."
12148,CT's vaccination rates and case numbers are allowing them to get rid of all Covid-related restrictions in mid-May.
12149,Our numbers are nowhere near as rosy.
12150,I had a baby in Virginia back in January so before the vaccines got really rolled out to the public and during the spike.
12151,While policy was I wore it while in labor it was not enforced.
12152,Everyone else in the room was masked and the maternity ward had a high vaccination rate so the only time they really enforced it was when the anesthesiologist was in the room for my epidural.
12153,June is still a long way aways and I wouldn’t be shocked if the hospital policy changes (it seriously changed monthly when I was pregnant) or they drop the enforcement of the mask for the person in labor

12167,"Only a fool wouldn't have seen that coming, but fools seem to run the team sports programs in the area..."
12168,Well clearly these blood clots are either not the same or do not occur in younger people otherwise it would not be possible that we have had only a handful of people under 35 dying and most of them actually had serious underlying conditions.
12169,I have heard about this assertion from the UK but I do not think it has been published yet.
12170,The regulator did the maths in the Netherlands and for our situation the risk of the AstraZeneca vaccin is greater than the risk of Covid for young people.
12171,For the Johnson vaccin it would work out about the same going on the currently known numbers.

12543,sore arm round one of pfizer.
12544,just super lethargic for round two.
12545,It’s been two weeks since my second dose and still haven’t felt them.
12546,You'd be surprised how many of those weirdos are complete stoners.
12547,Helps them absorb the hate and misinformation.
12548,Very mild.
12549,"Only got tested because I wanted to rule out allergies, turns out covid positive."

12583,“They’re the type to hold it against you for not going to their international wedding” just say that out loud to yourself a few times and think about what sort of friendships you want to keep and the precedent you set.
12584,I’m not saying you have to cut ties or anything as I don’t know anything about your friendship but even with friends you have to draw lines.
12585,It’s A LOT to ask for people to travel that far for a wedding and  nobody should hold it against you if you can’t or choose not to travel that far.
12586,Not necessarily.
12587,"Killer t-cells rapidly remove an infection and while there is a chance of spread, it should be greatly reduced."
12588,Significantly lowering the R0 could still effectively end the pandemic.
12589,where in the world is in lockdown right now?
12590,i’m in australia and OOTL with the world..
12591,"Because he's so damn bright that he started being able to challenge epidemiologists...

You think it is a joke ?"
12592,"And still, those are words of our ministry of education... 😐"
12593,It's very unlikely because blood clots - including blood clots triggering disseminated intravascular coagulation (the type linked to Jnj/AZ vaccines) dissolve naturally over time.
12594,"Once the underlying acute issue is solved (e.g., a traditional cause is sepsis), this type of blood clot risk goes back to population-level risk very quickly."
12595,There is no theoretical cause of action that would allow this type of clot - triggered by the adenovirus or subsequent spike protein - to persist in the body for very long once the underlying trigger is resolved.
12596,I beg your pardon?
12597,(Mumbled with mouth closed)
12598,How are ICU and supply shortages still happening in wealthy nations a year into this?
12599,!
12600,I felt this way with the russian and the chinese made ones and the data showed they were pretty on point.
12601,"I live in India, and am yet to see anyone wear the mask properly"
12602,"Yeah, I mean I can understand why people are hesitant."
12603,But if you’re going around blatantly telling people that peoples have died from any of the vaccines then you need to rethink some choices you’ve made.
12604,Our county executive was up on stage yesterday saying this exact thing.
12605,Felt like he was talking down to people and saying we are not Superman out there with bullets bouncing off our chest...
12606,I need to stop watching these press conferences
12607,"Honestly, the long term impact of USA vaccinating itself first will probably be positive."
12608,Imagine if we were doing the opposite.
12609,If we were trying to vaccinate other countries first it would feed into anti-vaxers hysteria.
12610,We only want to use the vaccine after testing on millions of poor people!
12611,This way the world gets a clear example of what vaccines can do for them and will be lining up to get them as quickly as possible.
12612,It would probably be 300-400k higher if not for the J&amp;J pause.
12613,There's a huge thread on indian twitter where people have commented about their vaccinated parents experiencing milder symptoms.
12614,"In fact, in quite a few cases, the young son/daughter had more severe symptoms compared to old vaccinated parents."
12615,"This is not scientific, rather anecdotal, but there's lots of posts like this to conclude that vaccines are indeed helping"
12616,"In this round, vaccine efficacy of 78% was recorded against mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of Covid-19 based on 127 cases.The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, with a reduction in the number of hospitalisations."
12617,"The efficacy against asymptomatic Covid-19 infections was 70%, suggesting decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients."
12618,We live in California.
12619,A family friend in Texas just died last week from covid.
12620,I just wonder if vaccine hesitancy or ending the masks mandates contributed to her death.
12621,"People need to realize that we are so close to the finish line, why put people in danger at this point."
12622,Thousands of people are still dying each day from covid when they really don't have to now that vaccines are available.
12623,Nope.
12624,"They didn't not plan for vaccinations at all, and exported vaccines to foreign countries."
12625,We're running out of vaccines now after just 10 million or so doses.
12626,"Now they've woken up and racing to increase production, get more vaccines approved etc."
12627,[deleted]
12628,lol
12629,"The WHO should change its stance on airborne transmission, but it would not be that easy to fix the ventilation issue for most office buildings."
12630,They don't have enough air changes per hour and you can't open windows if you wanted to.
12631,‘Anti-Vaxxers melt en-masse’
12632,Thank you.
12633,Yeah I thought that was wild.

12635,"There are over 25,000 participants in the study."
12636,Some of those are bound to die of other things than covid during it.
12637,"Yeahhh, I really just use it to keep up with some friends and scroll through videos, also troll and cause arguments with idiots :/"
12638,I've never had stinky crap in between my teeth ever... What are you eating that gets logged in your teeth?
12639,The only thing that has ever done that is corn and I just use a toothpick for that... Food shouldn't be logged in your teeth... You're doing something wrong if it is.

12645,This vaccine will save possibly millions of lives.
12646,FREE
12647,That was meant as hyperbole.
12648,Admittedly the intention can get lost in text.
12649,"As pointed out by other users, all pandemics end."
12650,The exact criteria of an 'end' is hard to glean in the midst of a pandemic though.
12651,I'd imagine hindsight will indicate this started in 2019 and ended in 2022.

12662,"I’m not contesting that she has a doctorate, nor that a lot of nurse practitioners get doctorates."
12663,I’m contesting that she uses “doctor” in a clinical setting.
12664,"In the US, doctor is synonymous with physician when in a clinical setting."
12665,Where as doctor in an academic setting usually refers to a PhD or equivalent.
12666,"Using doctor in a clinical setting when you are in fact a nurse is deceptive at the least, and ultimately fraudulent."
12667,Why can’t these nurse practitioners just be happy and proud of their degree without coopting the physician moniker in a clinical setting?
12668,That's like saying putting on sunscreen just to sit in your living room is important because it normalizes skin protection.

12677,"I think there are more benefits to showing your face than it being ""slightly more comfortable""."
12678,Children in particular benefit from being able to read facial expressions and see people smiling.
12679,They also are much more difficult to hear and understand (coming from a parent whose child has speech troubles) and have more difficulty understanding other people's speech.
12680,"In many states, children have been playing sports and attending school since last fall with no masks and no outbreaks (Iowa, Texas, etc)."
12681,It can be done - we should be looking at places that have lifted restrictions successfully to see what we can learn.
12682,"I think you're viewing this from a ""Phd"" perspective."
12683,To be honest probably the same exact perspective that Fauci and many other figure heads view this.
12684,But regular laymen don't.
12685,Hence why you have a lot of people complain about messaging.
12686,It hasn’t completed phase 3 yet so we don’t know how effective it is.

12688,"So if a joint gets them to vax before then, it's a win."
12689,We can dream.
12690,"Oh that’s good, although there’s a lot of pressure here in India to supply those doses locally to cover the demand due to the insane second wave here."
12691,So I actually thought they won’t start exporting until the supply is stable here in India.
12692,Again I don’t know for sure just guessing from the news etc.
12693,"&gt;the benefit is “my face is slightly more comfortable”

Isn't that pretty reductive?"
12694,Seeing people's facial expressions is important to me.
12695,Young children especially need to see people's faces for language development and emotional development.

12705,It \*is\* a slowly mutating one.
12706,Just doesn't matter if you give it free reign to spread and enough dice rolls.
12707,Your math is not accurate because it seems that the vaccine is more risky for younger people.
12708,"For covid, overwhelming majority of deaths are older people who seem to have a much lower risk from the vaccine."
12709,"Wow, you have to be a really terrible person to sell people fake vaccines during a pandemic."
12710,I can’t imagine this does a lot of good for the global vaccine rollout as more cases like this pop up and stories make it around about how the  vaccines are fake and don’t work.
12711,When the ones in question were literally fake.
12712,"My dad is 61 and only goes out one day a week, except for the occasional walk to a park one block from our house, or if there’s a family emergency, and he shares similar sentiments."
12713,Joy Reid is 52.
12714,I’m guessing a lot of people who are at the higher end of the “general population” tier are simply being more cautious.
12715,"A 20 or 30 year old isn’t at high risk of getting severe Covid or long haul symptoms, unless they’re blatantly being reckless, while someone in their 50s or early 60s could still get it, even if they have no pre-existing conditions and they’re following guidelines word for word."
12716,Asking here because I don't know where else to ask.
12717,I got almost all of the common covid symptoms on monday.
12718,"Fever, headache, tiredness, chest pain, etc."
12719,I measured my oxygen saturation with a pulse oxymeter and got 93-94%.
12720,I slept for almost the entirety of that day.
12721,"Yesterday I felt much better, my saturation got to 95% and the only other symptoms that I has was a slight high temperature (not to the point of fever) and a small but persisting headache."
12722,"Still, I spent the day resting."
12723,Today I woke up with no symptoms other than an sporadic cough.
12724,My saturation is at 96%.
12725,My question is if this is enough to assume that I have/had covid?
12726,"Ideally I would take the test, but it's kinda expensive (76 USD, more or less) in my country and I'm short of money right now."
12727,I asked family and friends that had covid and they are confused about the fast recovery.
12728,"I'm worried about my family, my parents specifically."
12729,I already isolated.
12730,But it's the doubt that consumes me.
12731,"""You're back home from Iraq, live your life like you used to prior."
12732,"What else do you need?"""
12733,Almost but not quite.
12734,"America doesn't say you can't export period, it arranged for first fulfillment of X number in their contracts by offering more money."
12735,"Then, it offered the companies a bunch of money and said if you want to use this money then you can't export anything that is made with what you used this money for until the President says you can."
12736,It's because you see these people online all the time talking about how they're such great people for wearing a mask 24/7.
12737,"When you're in a discussion on Reddit where you're telling other people that being vaccinated means you can use only 1 mask instead of 2, you're virtue signaling."
12738,That's absurd.
12739,"Sure, if they’re the only one wearing one."
12740,"That’s why we all ought to, at least in crowded indoor places, until kids can get vaccinated"
12741,Both AZ ( to 90% people) and this one to the rest.
12742,Damn!
12743,Guess ill call the dentist lol
12744,Still a while.
12745,"Phase 1 A and B would be upping shipments to states with high demand, then allowing doctors, employers, and just any provider in low demand states to get it, rather than just these mass sites."
12746,Once you see those two things happening in every state then I predict full exports occurring.
12747,My guess would be June or July.
12748,Possibly earlier if J&amp;J gets clear or Novovax gets approved.
12749,Your argument is that the US should be exporting the vaccines we manufacture.
12750,"That's fine, and I think it's a discussion worth having."
12751,"The US certainly should export all of their Astrazeneca supply, and should've done so months ago."
12752,"**But that is entirely separate from telling the US to just flat out manufacture fewer vaccines so you use less raw materials, which is what India is asking."
12753,"**

There's a reason airlines instruct you to secure your own oxygen mask before tending to others."
12754,"If the countries that supply the raw materials can also manufacture the vaccine, that's great, because that makes logistics and transportation far easier."
12755,"The poll is from Land Securities, a commercial real estate company."
12756,Of course the people selling office space want people returning to offices.
12757,"I know everyone has questions and no one seems to have answers, but the one I don't understand is when you look at COVID by county, the counties on the boarder between MI vs IN and OH are doing much worse."
12758,But why?
12759,"I would understand if it was up higher north, but it really seems like there is a clear line, based on the state, between MI and IN/OH."
12760,"I can't think of a single reason that neighboring counties would have vastly different infection rates, especially in rural IN/MI?"
12761,"They just updated it for today and it dropped sharply in MI, and continuing down in some of the other high rate states I looked at, too."
12762,Pedialyte and Tylenol... feel better
12763,"&gt;People working an in-person job without paid sick leave most definitely did this

Europe's taken just as bad of a hit from covid and they supposedly don't have this problem."
12764,Very much so
12765,And I thought it was coming in from polar bears swimming in from Greenland.
12766,I guess I learned something today.
12767,15 hours in to Pfizer shot 2 and a very slight fever and sore arm.
12768,That’s all you got Pfizer?
12769,Yep.
12770,"A family member of mine died of Covid in TX last summer, but that was not what his death certificate said."
12771,Covid would be so much deadlier if it happened 100 years ago.
12772,Our modern tech and theriputics keep so many people alive which gives people a false sense that this virus isn't dangerous.
12773,Nurses have a lot of practice with these.
12774,I didn’t feel either
12775,I realize and I'm optimistic that works but it's going to push out the length of the pandemic.
12776,Around the herd immunity point it can get worse quicker and better quicker.
12777,We're definitely better off with the vaccines though.
12778,I had nothing but a sore arm on both shots.
12779,"It's tough because you're almost trying to convince yourself that anything you experience is somehow related...for example, sure, I got a little sleepy later that afternoon."
12780,But that happens every day as I start to wind down!
12781,I think some people have understandable struggles with anxiety that contribute to real physical side effects.
12782,"I think that if you rule out a sore arm most people have essentially no side effects, followed closely by those who experience achiness and very low grade fever."
12783,The truly bad experiences I think are much less common (maybe 1 in 10).
12784,Indeed.
12785,"Problem is, that routine daily contact is at work, or at school (to let parents go to work)."
12786,Having lots of people not being able to work means wealth transfers from rich to poor - obviously the rich (and hence influential) don't like that very much.
12787,Sadly I’m coming across more people are not interested in taking the shot.
12788,"Recently learned this past weekend, my SIL who is 30, won’t take the shot."
12789,She thinks there’s other effects we don’t know and it was “produced too fast”.
12790,"Ugh, that’s now 6 family members that won’t take it."
12791,I’m getting my second this Saturday.
12792,You have the vaccine.
12793,You're protected.
12794,Go fly.
12795,What more reassurance do you need?
12796,It fuels their ego knowing that their followers are willing to risk their health to see and hear them speak.
12797,"Think about it, that’s significant pull."
12798,So would it make sense if I test negative today to go home and isolate there until the 7 days are up?
12799,Just to minimize chance of exposure?
12800,"People wearing masks outdoors aren't harming anyone, aren't flaunting any social or legal rules, aren't actively trying to endanger others."

12826,What?
12827,Texas has had one of the lowest per capita case loads in the country  for a long time... and they are second in vaccine doses administered.
12828,So what are you saying?
12829,When California had its variant did you say of course California?
12830,Neither of your concerns with the vaccines hold water.
12831,"They both are effective, they both are safe."
12832,You are an anti-vaxxer regardless of what you say.
12833,You’re the problem.
12834,Texas has a low case load right now and has for a while.
12835,Texas is currently second in number of doses administered.
12836,This variant isn’t because Texas is doing it wrong.
12837,Maybe in the future you can say that...but right now... that is false.

12874,I'm just saying that urban areas is more connected not that rural area is not connected.
12875,It's a statistical probability and some example don't prove stuff.
12876,The problem is that you need a lot of infections (probably several thousand) to get a good picture of how well protected vaccinated people are.
12877,The fact that a lot of them are asymptomatic is encouraging but it could be due just to chance.
12878,If you are under the age of 30 and female the vaccine is just as likely to kill you as coronavirus.
12879,If you are under the age of 30 and male you are more likely to suffer serious adverse effects from this vaccine than coronavirus.
12880,We don’t even know if the adverse reaction has the same chance as happening again after the second dose.
12881,Then the risks above are double than the actual disease.
12882,The truth of the matter is this vaccine is not safe for the under 30’s and shouldn’t be given to them even the UK has finally realised this
12883,"I've got an appointment for my second dose at CVS next Wednesday, but I've decided to go to a mass vax site with some friends on Monday instead."

12896,We might need a booster after one year and then every 5-10 like DTAP but early evidence suggests that yearly doses probably won't be needed.

12905,It would only last like 10 seconds so you couldn't even properly soap and rinse your hands in that time before having to press it again.
12906,Just gross.
12907,I haven't been there since Dec 2019 and I hope they've made some changes since then.
12908,"Sorry for my ignorance, but wasn’t India being praised for giving away vaccines to other counties?"
12909,How come they don’t use it for themselves first?
12910,"Oh yeah, didn't think of that."
12911,I still find this problematic if the vaccine actually is causing CVST.
12912,CVST is normally so rare that it isn't routinely being look for.
12913,"For regular blood clots, firstly they are more common, and secondly you have blood tests, ultrasounds, and other clinical criteria that can help the medical provider figure out who to test, and still we are doing tons of CT angiograms to catch just a few pulmonary embolis."
12914,"If the vaccines are causing CVST, and the most common symptom is headache, that's a whole different story."
12915,Headaches are so common and could have been caused by anything.
12916,I'm not sure doing mass CT or MR venograms for all headache patients that show up to EDs is gonna be feasible.
12917,"Also while treatable, CVST is still a much more severe disease than regular blood clots, with risk of stroke and intracranial bleeding."
12918,"It can also be difficult to pick up on a regular head CT, and you might miss it until a severe complications such as a bleed happens."

12943,There is no other viable explanation to the massive spike in deaths and cases happening right now.
12944,We were also told there was no human to human transmission when the w.h.o.

12953,Is it really .006% because my grandpa in india had to go to the hospital and he got the 1st dose of astrazeneca.
12954,It probably saved his life though as he has a bunch of comorbidities.

12961,Vaccines are much **much** slower.

13001,"That, combined with effective vaccines, will basically be a cure."
13002,There's also on-going studies which may indicate the mRNA/Adenovirus vaccines give a reasonable level of protection against some/many other coronaviruses.

13086,Appreciate you actually reading the discussion.
13087,Didn't stop me from being downvoted a lot as redditors aren't the best and the brightest and are easily swayed by dumb fucking quips.
13088,Do people wear masks while chilling on the beach?
13089,I appreciate the summation done here.
13090,"My question: are there any larger studies to determine: (a) the efficacy against variants for AZ, where both conflicting studies were small, and (b) how much t-cell responses factor into symptom severity for breakthrough infections?"
13091,I wouldn’t feel bad at all at getting J&amp;J.
13092,We want a good outcome at a population level.
13093,"On an individual level, a reasonably healthy person is not going to die or end up in the ICU if they get Covid without a vaccine."
13094,"So one shot vs the other, for most people, is not a critical difference."
13095,"But each of us that is vaccinated helps cut down the infection rate collectively, and the rate of spread."
13096,"So thank you for doing your part, and stay well!"
13097,"&gt;TMC campaigned also but they are not the government

You do realize they currently form the government in the state the campaigns are taking place?"
13098,"I think people don't trust them to tell the truth, not that Russia isn't technologically adept."
13099,The real endgame is that COVID becomes just another virus that we have to deal with and eventually becomes far less prevalent due to vaccinations and medications.
13100,"TB and malaria and AIDS still kill plenty of people each year, but they're not pandemics anymore."
13101,"We're currently in a transitional period with COVID, but how long the transitional period lasts depends on vaccination rates and how long vaccine protection lasts."
13102,"Yes, J&amp;J is the owner of Janssen (which is actually Belgian)."
13103,"Janssen Vaccines (formerly Crucell from Leiden, NL, which worked on vaccines against, amongst others, Ebola) is a subsdiary of Janssen."
13104,Just to make things less complicated.
13105,;)
13106,Then what is?
13107,Permanent lockdown?
13108,&gt; Pretty certain that the odds for those in their late 30s are similar to those over 45.
13109,"Not even close, hence why we're much lower down the government's priority list."
13110,"All things being equal, you should share a few more vaccines, too."
13111,"“During lab tests, research showed that ""several neutralizing antibodies are ineffective in controlling other variants with the same genetic markers as BV-1,"" the university said.”

So why are we writing articles about it already?"
13112,"In short, whenever it won’t be seen as bad/whenever it’s politically and optically safe."
13113,So whenever all of the other ones do.
13114,Which basically means we need one chain to nationally take the plunge and others will follow.
13115,"I don't want to come across as insensitive but, people in your family would be anecdotes."
13116,"Also, I'm a little confused since you said your uncle got the AZ vaccine but this is about the Covaxin vaccine."
13117,&gt;Maybe 100% in the trial sample.
13118,This is where the data is coming from yes.
13119,That doesn't mean there will never be cases where someone doesn't die or get severe cases of covid after getting the vaccine.
13120,"As more data comes available, the more precise it will be."
13121,&gt;And India is downplaying death numbers significantly.
13122,So I would also wait for an indepedent 3rd party review.
13123,"Fair enough, however I'd be surprised if the researchers didn't have access to their own independent data on these patients who were enrolled in the trial."
13124,&gt;One big contributing factor is that when youth sports restarted routine testing become required for the participants.
13125,"The tests aren't creating spread, they are measuring it."
13126,Youth sports are showing themselves to be a big cause of spread.
13127,Kids pile in to packed cars for hours and then spend all weekend competing against other groups of kids from all over the country and then bring it back to their homes and local schools.

13129,"Maybe he's decent at his regular day job, but the man is a shambles at predicting trends."
13130,"He looks at numbers, thinks ""What's the worst case scenario?"
13131,"Ok, I'll assume 50% worse than that"" and breathlessly gets the word out."
13132,Maybe he thinks by being so ominous he's scaring people straight and saving lives.
13133,I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.
13134,Whatever the case it's a big fat eye roll from me when someone tries to name drop him as a reputable predictor.

13142,I'm sorry *what*
13143,1) Who and where does is say it’s easy to treat?
13144,What are the following consequences even if it is treated?
13145,"2) There isn’t enough data either way, you are spreading disinformation by telling people they will be fine when we simply don’t know."
13146,"That is more dangerous

3) ‘storm in a teacup’ are you serious?"
13147,"A life threatening disease caused by a vaccine that affects significantly a group of people, of whom we don’t know why, is not a storm in a teacup."
13148,This is a serious problem.
13149,Why else would most of the developed world restrict this vaccine with age groups?
13150,You’d think that you’d offended someone’s mother when you point out how much of a disaster the Oxford vaccine is to a British person.
13151,This man vaccines
13152,They should really test pfizer/moderna in a single dose for those people.
13153,That removes like 60% of the inconvenience.
13154,"Only one trip, and usually dose 2 has the worse side effects."
13155,"Can't know until we really test it, but from what we do know we'd get most of the benefit with a one dose."
13156,Certainly more benefit than no dose.
13157,Just don't get cocky...
13158,"Oh, thank you for taking the time to explain."
13159,That does make more sense.
13160,I appreciate it.
13161,This is actually my biggest fear...
13162,"I feel like once everyone who is eligible (which should be now) has had ample time to get their shots, there shouldn't be any reason to keep restrictions."
13163,To hold people hostage because of the anti vax/ vaccine hesitant part of the population exists sets a bad precedent imo.
13164,"Wow, it’s difficult to misrepresent the situation better than you."
13165,"Yes because of the conservative media, include Yeonghap, Chosun and Donga."
13166,They are spreading BS everywhere.
13167,"one thing that this pandemic has taught me is to be appreciative of not having any intestinal isues/having to use the washroom often.I can go a long time without having to use the washroom 

I spent 15 minutes trying to find a washroom for my mom

Every restaurant we went to, We were willing to spend as much money as we had to buying food in order to use the washroom.But the washrooms were closed to everyone , even customers.I other places told us no too 

Eventually we got one."
13168,"Seriously, I know they are diseases that make people have to use the washroom often .How did those people survive during this time"
13169,"Are they closed for economic reasons, or because of covid restrictions?"
13170,"I feel like it’s actually happening, that we might just subdue this thing"
13171,"Weird how California's other West Coast pals (Oregon &amp; Washington), who have frankly kicked ass this whole time, are now seeing cases rise."
13172,I think it's hard to read too much into why any particular area is doing well or poorly at any given moment.
13173,Oh I’ve stopped wearing it outdoors in Manhattan now that I’m vaccinated.
13174,"I’m obviously fine with others doing what they want, but there’s no logical reason for me to wear one while walking outside"
13175,The guy got vaccinated in private.
13176,The only time he has ever wanted to do ANYTHING without thousands of people watching.
13177,That was no mistake and it's pathetic.
13178,"Since no one is actually answering your question, to compare efficacy numbers directly you'd need to study both vaccines together in one study (with a control/placebo group) at the same time, in the same place, under the same conditions (roughly same demographics and geographic distribution of participants)."
13179,"It might be done at some point, but this kind of comparative study is pretty low on the priority list, and the vaccine makers might never want to perform a study like this in case their vaccine ends up being proven verifiably less effective than the competition."

13361,*
13362,India is not North Carolina.
13363,We are going to get back to normal regardless of India or Canada or Brazil.
13364,Sorry this makes you so sad.
13365,There are people on the fence that just need a little more motivation.
13366,You know that the vaccine is produced in Europe and the EU also paid for it right?
13367,I was pretty much in the same boat.
13368,Got my shot Sunday evening and just now am feeling better.
13369,"Terrible aches and chills, then my lymph node under my arm got swollen and was super painful."
13370,You’ll probably start feeling better soon
13371,I wasn't really referring to Canada and I don't think Canada has any issue with paying it back.
13372,Moreso Mexico.
13373,Mexico is certainly not rich.
13374,To charge a poor neighbour for stock you were going to throw out anyway is in really bad taste.
13375,To hold on to stock your own government officials say won't even be used is even worse.
13376,"I think everyone would, but the truth is, we don't know what the future is for this virus."
13377,"Sorry, but that's the truth."
13378,Like anyone else I would like a definite end date.
13379,"However, with nearly 40% of the county (now over 40) and I'm sure more in the queue for 'first shots' we could be in a very good place come Memorial Day."
13380,And July 4th we could very well lift all state restrictions.
13381,"But we could be in a situation where this does last for a while, it's just too hard to tell."
13382,"Some states have opened and then had to pull back, as have countries."
13383,And there are new hot spots now (like India) that weren't there before....
13384,"It's too difficult to predict, and I wouldn't bet money on when it will be 'over' at least in the US."
13385,It's just too hard.
13386,"Unfortunately, the issue we have is it's 3-4 weeks between most shots for 'full protection' for the first dose (which is still pretty good actually) and for 'full protection' two weeks later, so it's six weeks."
13387,We are likely two weeks behind the state and CDC data.
13388,But there's real hope this is over sooner rather than later and that these vaccines may be starting to show that they are seriously working (in my view).
13389,"Likely it's about 20% country-wide in the US, which is why largely cases are starting to go slowly down (we can hope)."
13390,[removed]
13391,This seems extremely illogical if what you say is true.
13392,There would be no reason for all these countries to pull away from the AZ vaccine.
13393,I don't know the nitty gritty.
13394,But it seems extremely illogical for them to pull out given that Covid can also cause the same blood clots at a higher rate.
13395,1918 Spanish flu and World War I related soldiers travel across the world would like to have a word with you.
13396,Found the 80’s baby.
13397,😬
13398,The CDC paused the approval for J&amp;J..
13399,Are you seriously implying that the people living in the US aren’t currently at risk from Covid and that we should therefor be sending our vaccines and/or the materials required to make those vaccines to countries around the world?
13400,We’re in a global pandemic.
13401,"I don’t think anyone is blindly defending it, and how does “fair” even begin to enter the equation?"
13402,"The US is going to vaccinate our own population, and then we’re (almost certainly) going to start exporting those vaccines."
13403,You’re going to be experiencing a lot of disappointment over your life if you’re expecting international/geo-politics to be “fair.”
13404,"I'm thinking this might come as somewhat as a surprise to many though, considering the border has been CLOSED to all but essential work and goods for more than a year."
13405,"There are so many people who genuinely do think like this, so it's often difficult to pick up on sarcasm."
13406,Alabama actually.
13407,It expired here Easter weekend.
13408,About the only thing I can tell that has changed is you will occasionally see people walking around Publix (mid/upper tier grocery store chain) without a mask.
13409,[removed]
13410,Dangerous infections.
13411,Don't know what that exactly is but I'd rather not get them... You?
13412,How is that duplicitous?
13413,Oh very interesting.
13414,Here in the states they don’t check at all.
13415,Everything is just gradually opening up by % capacity
13416,How did you come to that conclusion?
13417,It seems more like 40% of the US population doesn't want to get vaccinated.
13418,"I know far too many people who are either conspiracy theorists, or play the ""tough guy"" role and don't think they need the vaccine, cause it won't kill them."
13419,These people suck.
13420,"No, you cited Germany's $1 billion investment in vaccine development."
13421,I cited the US $11 billion commitment plus $2 billion in pre-orders.
13422,What other country spent that kind of money on vaccines?
13423,It's not unreasonable that you get get first priority if you're the one spending all the money.
13424,You can't admit that the policy makers are being duplicitous and then be shocked that people distrust them...
13425,"That is nice... but NOPE, I will continue to treat every person as if they have the plague - masks on &amp; avoidance mode!"
13426,Umm how do you know that you aren't dislodging bad bacteria?
13427,Do you somehow know how to floss around bad microscopic bacteria?
13428,Didn't realize you had the eyes to see that...
13429,Counterpoint: Covid wouldn’t have been as wide spread 100 years ago.
13430,Global travel was slow and people all across the globe spent more time outside.
13431,"Not doubting the validity of their experience per se, but don't you think that a friend's dad's coworker is not really a great anecdote?"
13432,i had covid 15 days days ago but stopped having symptoms 7 days ago.
13433,bunch of appts opened up recently and i could go get it now if i wanted.
13434,which is why im wondering if i should wait.
13435,Just give it up
13436,[removed]
13437,Covid must not be as bad as they said.
13438,People who will show up to vote in primaries either already got the vaccine or definitely are not going to get the vaccine.
13439,Covid can melt steel beams.
13440,"&gt; If you've been offered the vaccine in the UK, then it's because you're either in an older or a more vulnerable age group

I'm in neither (I'm late 30s)."
13441,"My local GP offered me AZ because a large number of people in the current over 45s bracket are declining it, hence the surplus."
13442,"My risk of death from COVID is practically non-existent, particularly as I have perfect BMI, no pre-existing health conditions, work exclusively from home and do all shopping online."
13443,"When I do out, I use N95 masks."
13444,"I'm as low-risk of catching the virus as you can be, short of living on the ISS."
13445,Feeling safe enough to go back and actually wanting to go back are two different things.
13446,This ranks among the top apocalyptic headlines of the pandemic.
13447,"There are probably hundreds of different options, including both substance-based and non-substance-based."
13448,"Yeah, though most don't even check."
13449,I only eat indoor dining at responsible places that check at the door.
13450,It's easy to make these statements in hindsight.
13451,"At the time, no one had any sort of idea of what we were up against."
13452,More.
13453,MORE.
13454,That seems excessive
13455,Fair enough
13456,Can someone explain why so many young people are getting hospitalised in India (as opposed to just being infected)?
13457,This is the exact opposite of the usual pattern.
13458,"According to my state, CT, they are essentially non-existent."
13459,"with over 86% of the 75+ population with one dose, 77% fully vaccinated, the hospitalizations are are mostly occurring for younger people."
13460,"We have free vaccines, open to anyone, I don't understand why our hospitalization rate is so high."
13461,Triple Mutation strand is one of the cause.
13462,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-triple-mutation-variant-in-india-emerges-as-fresh-worry-in-covid-battle-2418430

13467,They failed the country.
13468,You’re really bad at math eh?
13469,12 out of 4.2 million is 0.00029% death rate.
13470,Covid death rate is 0.7 to 7.7%.
13471,It's not zero risk.
13472,It's just a lot lower than being inside.
13473,"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/)  


&gt;In a [systematic review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true) of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that **less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors."
13474,** But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
13475,"&gt;  
&gt;“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said."
13476,"She added: “If you are going to a beach — which is a beautiful thing — you should avoid times when it’s crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.”"
13477,We will never know if it was the lockdown that stopped wuhan or if the disease where finished anyhow.
13478,The death increased exponentially until lockdown where in place.
13479,This is also a large part of why current vaccines were developed much faster.
13480,It's unusual to have had no issues finding suitable people during clinical trials.
13481,"Agreed, however you have to know your audience."
13482,You're not going to somehow change the American individualistic mindset.
13483,Therefore you have to alter the message based on the audience.
13484,"It may be enough somewhere else to say ""Hey guys, we best all do our best until we get this under control""."
13485,In the US that simply doesn't work.
13486,"The message has to be ""Hey man, if you only take this freaking shot, you can do whatever the hell you want!""."
13487,People here need individual incentives or else they lose all interest.
13488,Or our good buddies up north in Canada
13489,You don't know if the person you are standing next to is immunocompromised and scared of you standing there maskless.
13490,It's just common curtesy to wear a mask until spread gets so low that there's no worry.
13491,That might be true in the U.K.
13492,It's not in most of the world.
13493,What’s your explanation for the spike in MI then?
13494,"I’m not sure I buy into your viewpoint, which seems to come down to “Since the government can do some things, that means it’s only logical that it should be allowed to do all things.”

But is that necessarily true?"
13495,"Since the government requires driver’s licenses, do you believe that now the government should be allowed to require you to have a license to date, for instance?"
13496,No.
13497,Of course not.
13498,But that seems to be the argument you’re making.
13499,That might be true for you.
13500,It's not true for the vast majority of the world.
13501,The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are brand new technologies that are extremely expensive.
13502,Try thinking beyond your own skin.
13503,"Yeah, you make sense, but the other guy says he'd ""rather get COVID""."
13504,"If you get COVID, you have more than a 0.0014% chance of dying, no matter your age."
13505,IIRC the lowest percentages I've seen were 0.02% which is more than 10x 0.0014%.
13506,"(Note that the most modern statistics may have updated that 0.02% number, please link if you have a better number)."
13507,"If you want to include the risk of getting COVID in your risk assessment, you'd have to believe that you had a less than 10% chance of getting COVID before the numbers make sense."
13508,Hopefully mRNA tech can change that.
13509,"&gt; The “problem” with “reducing SEVERE COVID down to a mild/asymptomatic infection” is that it definitely saves lives right now, it may reduce spread, but it also creates an environment where dangerous mutations are selected for

I totally agree and I'm very concerned about this considering the issue with people refusing to take the vaccine too."
13510,"However, the mutations we've seen so far seem to be spike protein efficiency mutations and not mutations that increase mortality."
13511,Hopefully I'm not wrong here but if so please correct me if I'm wrong.
13512,&gt; AND develop a mutated strain that evades the current immune defense built by current vaccines to reboot this entire pandemic back to day one.
13513,I suspect that won't happen just due to the fact that covid isn't very prone to mutations being a coronavirus.
13514,The mutations themselves we've seen tend to be focused around the spike and increase efficiency.
13515,We also haven't seen any mutations that completely evade current vaccines.
13516,I haven't seen updated R numbers yet though but if we can keep it around 1-1.5 like the flu we're out of the pandemic.
13517,"&gt; Mind, 70% total immunity and 100% protection vs. severe immunity is a metric fuck ton better than nothing, but the better vaccines are at preventing any infection, the more effective they are at mitigating the risk of strains that evade the immune defenses."
13518,I think we're on the same page here as the endemic mutation scenario does frighten me but the history is that viruses eventually domesticate themselves after a species jump and I don't see why it wouldn't do this again.
13519,We're just freaked out about covid because it's novel.
13520,I'd strongly prefer us to kill it though by having everyone get with the program and get vaccinated.
13521,"&gt; Two: And therein lies the rub, one hinted at in your claim, too (emphasis mine): “if you catch COVID but don’t have a chance to transmit it AND you don’t die we’re going to lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.”

I don't think I clarified my point here."
13522,Sorry.
13523,"If you lower the mortality rate, and total impact on infection, you're almost certainly going to reduce the infection transmission duration."
13524,I think right now it's 10 days on average from onset of symptoms.
13525,So if you lower this to 5 because the immune system can mount a stronger and faster response you're going to lower R too.
13526,&gt; And that’s the shit that scares me still.
13527,"I’ve definitely been fucked up by all the isolation and stress from the last year

I have to admit that I seriously underestimated the impact it would have on my family."
13528,I have a few family members that are in therapy after long term isolation and I myself had severe anxiety due to covid.
13529,I think what bothered me most is when I was out and OTHER people weren't being responsible.
13530,A few times I got in serious arguments with people that weren't wearing masks at the peak of the pandemic.
13531,Isn't the border closed?
13532,See my other post.
13533,"There's very clearly an end point being talking about...

Oh and, if you don't understand how ""i can only see vaccinated people"" turns into ""i can see everyone once enough are vaccinated"" over time clearly there's something wrong."
13534,"It's funny, anytime I got home and felt a bit sketchy I was using gin as mouthwash, then brushing my teeth."
13535,probably a good move.
13536,Dallas County doesn’t report Sundays numbers on Monday anymore.
13537,They report both Sunday and Monday numbers on Tuesday.
13538,I imagine other counties do something similar.
13539,What math would you prefer then?
13540,I’m not trying to cherry pick statistics.
13541,Give me a different mathematical model to consider.
13542,How long will it take for MRNA rollout and what is the mathematical trade off versus taking the AZ now?
13543,You are so right.
13544,It’s pure theater.
13545,Yep.
13546,It would be surprising if it WASN'T the US.
13547,"I think the issue is that there seems to be no endpoint, and that messaging may be discouraging people who would otherwise get vaccinated."
13548,What's the point of getting vaccinated if your life isn't going to improve beyond seeing other vaccinated people?
13549,We should be promoting a return to normalcy when numbers reach a certain point (X number of cases or X number of hospitalizations) NOT when every single person (children included) is vaccinated.
13550,"&gt; If we're supposed to follow the science, then outdoor masks are not needed."
13551,Depends.
13552,passing by someone?
13553,nah.
13554,"Sitting next to people and talking to them for an hour, yes."
13555,"Depending on the level of community spread, that is."
13556,Yes this is a more traditional vaccine technology.
13557,But side effects to vaccines in general are just your bodies natural response to pathogens.
13558,And vaccine technology can cause side effects.
13559,"That's, frankly, nonsense."
13560,"The fact that there's no way to identify vaccinated vs unvaccinated in public is clearly the reason the CDC isn't saying ""go back to normal in public""."
13561,Anyone who argues otherwise and argues that there shouldn't be a staging back to normal is blowing smoke up yer arse.
13562,I said all this a week or so ago and it was not a popular opinion in here.
13563,How the turn tables.
13564,I lost a filling during my covid stint.
13565,Well part of one.
13566,Yes.
13567,"Netherlands recorded 8 cases of blood clots in 400.000 AZ jabs, while the current american data suggests 8 cases in over 7 million doses J&amp;J"
13568,&gt;Taylor and Asmundson conducted a study to explore the core attitudes associated with non-adherence to wearing face masks.
13569,They proposed that anti-mask sentiment forms a network of related attitudes that influence each other in different ways.
13570,"To explore this web of attitudes, they used network analyses — a method of analyzing data that looks for patterns of relationships between interrelated variables or “nodes”."
13571,"&gt;The researchers collected survey data from a sample of over 2,000 Americans and Canadians with an average age of 54."
13572,The survey asked participants a range of questions designed to assess negative attitudes toward face masks.
13573,The surveys also asked respondents whether or not they wear a face mask because of COVID-19.
13574,"&gt;First, the vast majority (84%) of respondents said that they did wear a face mask, while only 16% did not."
13575,"Unsurprisingly, those who said they did not wear a mask endorsed more negative attitudes toward masks."
13576,&gt;A series of analyses were then used to determine the relative importance of each variable or node within this network of attitudes.
13577,"The researchers found that certain negative attitudes were strongly clustered — the belief that masks are ineffective, the belief that wearing a mask is a tough habit to acquire, the belief that masks make you look untrustworthy, the beliefs that masks look ugly or silly, and the beliefs that masks cause overheating or difficulty breathing."
13578,All of these negative attitudes — with the exception of beliefs about overheating and difficulty breathing — were significantly more endorsed by people who did not wear face masks.
13579,"&gt;Moreover, at the center of the network of attitudes was an aversion to wearing face masks, assessed with the item, “I do not like feeling forced to wear a facemask.” This attitude, which the researchers refer to as mask-related psychological reactance, was the node that scored highest in “closeness” and “betweenness” — two measures that denote how important a node is in connecting other nodes to each other."
13580,The belief that masks are ineffective scored the highest in “strength” — meaning that it made the most direct connections to other nodes.
13581,Oh only 20% death rate?
13582,Can't wait to take that risk.
13583,The group who's going to lie about being vaccinated probably isn't wearing masks anyway.
13584,"There are *a lot* of people who are wearing masks either because they're required to or because they are being told they should, but who want to drop them the minute they're told they safely can, too."
13585,That's the group we need to target.
13586,You have what chance of getting a blood clot with covid after one vaccine though?
13587,Stop shouting out random irrelephant stats.
13588,It's not a net-zero for the globe.
13589,There's a difference between vaccinating an 18-year-old American brat that can't be arsed to wear a mask for another month and wants to party and a 60-year-old with underlying health conditions in another part of the world risking their life just by going to work to support their family.
13590,"More lives could be saved if vaccines would be distributed to the at-risk groups first, that's just a fact."
13591,At least be honest about your nationalism.
13592,You're being downvoted for claiming that it's all the fault of the conservatives despite Texas having the same cases as California and Florida having less than NY
13593,But despite this they've avoided an outbreak for well over a year now.
13594,What changed?
13595,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html

See the section about ""Options to reduce quarantine"""
13596,"Actually, I recall hearing that one of the ways they identified the connection to AZ was by noting that individuals were *not* getting the clots after dose #2 (or, after Pfizer or Moderna for that matter)."
13597,I don't recall where I heard that - maybe on TWIV -- but it made me think the second dose was safe provided you did ok with dose #1.
13598,"What happens if they gave a date of june 1 and then the jnj vaccine was pulled completely, and they have to revise to July 1?"
13599,"Also, there's been very clear messaging about July 4th being mostly normal.. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56368328

This notion that there's some ""indefinite"" mask wearing is coming from left field to me."
13600,It's very clearly ending by the end of the summer - with the caveat that enough jags get jabbed.
13601,&gt;Study authors Steven Taylor and Gordon J. G. Asmundson suggest that the refusal to wear masks during the pandemic may be partially motivated by a phenomenon called psychological reactance.
13602,Psychological reactance (PR) is the unpleasant arousal that a person experiences when they are asked to follow orders that they believe to infringe on their personal choices.
13603,"People high in PR tend to react to attempts at persuasion with hostility and counter-arguments, believing that they are defending their freedom."
13604,I mean the WHO in general was like the last group to recommend mask wearing so I’m not surprised
13605,Shh... you're not allowed to say that in here.
13606,"I said the risk was too high with a well reasoned argument and got shouted down, just days ago."
13607,Idiots in this sub.

13612,If it was made in the US I don’t think there’s much doubt over what country is receiving those doses.
13613,I think it’s the mindset of being considerate of your fellow humans and not really giving a shit about wearing a tiny piece of fucking cloth for a while.
13614,Question here.
13615,I'm a college student for context.
13616,Yesterday my roommate tested positive for COVID--he traveled to another school this past weekend and partied.
13617,I tested negative at the same time.
13618,"As soon as he found out, we isolated ourselves from each other in our 2 bedroom apartment."
13619,I have no symptoms whatsoever and I plan on getting tested everyday.
13620,I also have the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine.
13621,Do I have to quarantine?
13622,And if so for how long if I continue to test negative?
13623,I have almost a full time job that really needs me so I want to get back to work as soon as possible.
13624,Plus I have one in person design class which would be very helpful to attend as finals are coming up.
13625,"Under 30s have sub 1% IFR, and there's the idea that you may never get covid or can get a much safer, more efficacious vaccine."
13626,"It sounds like the rates might be much higher in young women, so it's entirely reasonable for people in that age range to hold out for other options."
13627,Living in NY is pain.
13628,All the restrictions.
13629,None of the fun but still high Covid rates so everything is still closed.
13630,I’m vaccinated.
13631,Let me go to a movie theater ☹️
13632,I had sore arm and very minor fatigue
13633,don't forget the variants!
13634,But very selective use of math.
13635,As the Dutch regulator said the risk for people of death/serious side-effects from the AstraZeneca vaccin are inversely proportional to the risk of death/serious illness from the disease.
13636,What is so difficult to understand here?
13637,"A chance of approximately 1 in 65,000 is not something you should be asking of young healthy people."
13638,They have suffered enough in the common effort against Covid.
13639,Give young people a vaccin that for now appears not to have this drawback and stop making them feel guilty over this.
13640,I will happily take the AstraZeneca myself.
13641,I would personally like to know too if it's an 'on-off' condition or more complicated than that.
13642,"Is it that you either have the condition or don't, or do some people with severe side effects have a 'lesser' form of these clots that aren't being seen/studied, but then recover?"
13643,Is anyone even looking for that..
13644,That's great.
13645,Operation Warp Speed spent $11 billion on vaccine research spread around 8 different companies.
13646,The US threw money at the issue recognizing that the sooner the economy gets back on its feet the better.
13647,Why be cheap trying to get out of a global crisis?
13648,The cost of more crippling lockdowns would be far more than the cost of vaccine.
13649,"Edit:  I should add that while Pfizer took no money from Warp Speed for development, the US did give them nearly $2 billion in pre-orders."
13650,&gt;Until they find a cure for it?
13651,There will never be a cure for COVID.
13652,At least not in our lifetimes.
13653,"Yes, it's okay to face reality."
13654,That's why it's okay to realize there are a lot of stupid people and there are a lot of incredibly intelligent people that helped us create and distribute vaccines so rapidly.
13655,People love to just remember the negative things.
13656,And thank you for the mask wearing.

13658,The German parliament on Wednesday passed  potent new legislation to control the coronavirus pandemic across the country.
13659,The changes to the Infection Protection Act could be a watershed moment in Germany's fight against the third wave of COVID-19.
13660,"Up until now, the federal government was technically in charge of restriction measures — but in the country's decentralized federal structure, the 16 states were free to implement those guidelines as they saw fit."
13661,"Increasingly, the states have diverged in how to implement the guidelines they agreed on, leading to huge disparities across state borders on what rules were in place."
13662,"Some states were opening up, despite exponential infection growth, while others remained closed."
13663,"Although this may have won state premiers popularity among voters, it has also seen infection numbers soar."
13664,"Faced with such inconsistency, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced this legislation to legally obligate — rather than cajole — states into specific action in certain circumstances."
13665,"It has been described in German media as a move to centralize power to Berlin, however, but such a move would require a change in the constitution."
13666,What happens next?
13667,"The 16 federal states could still block it on Thursday in the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house of parliament."
13668,"However, this is not expected."
13669,"If passed by both houses, affected districts will be immediately required to implement the new rules."
13670,"At some point, the law could be challenged in Germany's Constitutional Court."
13671,IS
13672,"Makes no sense at all, unless the surge is caused by the vaccines"
13673,"Actually I am wrong in the original post, I was quoting the wrong IFR figures."
13674,I was reading for 0-19.
13675,Will delete comment but the IFR for death are about equal
13676,Willful ignorance?
13677,And not to mention they may be misclassifying the illness and cause of death.
13678,Good.
13679,Keep them coming.
13680,"&gt;A total of 10,775,817 people have been given both doses of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, according to figures published on Wednesday."
13681,"That is slightly over 20 per cent of the UK’s adult population, which is estimated at 52.7 million."
13682,"Oh, those yahoos?"
13683,Nothing is going to change their mind except possibly being told they will be fired without the vax.
13684,And I think we still have a lot of mildly persuadable people to get vaxed before we futz with them.
13685,"Interesting, didn't know that."
13686,"And if the US is fully vaccinated (everyone who doesn't refuse, anyways) do we produce it and donate to poor nations/nations who are having trouble securing vaccines?"
13687,I think as a wealthy nation with high production capacity we owe that to our global neighbors...
13688,Hopefully others can learn from this.
13689,Anyone who talks about herd immunity unironically shouldn't be taken seriously.
13690,Hello!
13691,Can you please send me the link to this source?
13692,"*Greece, Iceland, and possibly France have entered the chat*"
13693,Dentists in Japan are also incentivized by the insurance system to do work in three visits that could be done in one visit.
13694,"&gt;If everyone in Germany took this vaccine 240 people would die

Or they could just take Pfizer instead and enjoy immunity with a far lower risk of vaccine-related premature death."
13695,Exactly as I plan to do.
13696,"NJ, but its not really enforced"
13697,"Ok, you're right it is the same."
13698,"Still worth taking imo, reducing right now is definitely worth the tiny risk."
13699,How about laziness
13700,Has India stopped producing those meds?
13701,[removed]
13702,Will this be out in a year?
13703,I guess that’s the next big problem.
13704,"I’m not at all saying that we shouldn’t wear masks until the end, I’m saying that the indefinite mask wearing makes skeptical people more skeptical"
13705,I meant things like the COVAX program rather than individual countries.
13706,As for variant origination: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-variants-may-arise-in-people-with-compromised-immune-systems/
13707,"Ordered yes, not delivered."
13708,And most of those of those are in vaccines the FDA hasn't approved.
13709,Canada has 10x the doses for its population.
13710,Biden said weeks ago we'd be sending our extra vaccines to other countries.
13711,"Yeah, see how that works out long term."
13712,25% open is a joke for a year and very bad for your people.
13713,"We could have all locked down to 100% and did this faster, doesn't mean its consequence free."
13714,"Yeah, be careful around street lamps at night!"
13715,"New York City health officials estimate that nearly a quarter of adult New Yorkers were infected with the coronavirus during the catastrophic wave of last spring, and that the toll was even higher among Black and Hispanic residents."
13716,"The estimates, based on antibody test results for more than 45,000 city residents last year, suggest that Black and Hispanic New Yorkers were twice as likely as white New Yorkers to have had antibodies to the coronavirus — evidence of prior infection."
13717,"Hispanic New Yorkers had the highest rate, with about 35 percent testing positive for antibodies, according to the study, whose authors include officials and researchers at the city Health Department and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health."
13718,"Among Black New Yorkers, 33.5 percent had antibodies."
13719,"Among Asian New Yorkers, the rate was about 20 percent."
13720,"For white New Yorkers, the rate was 16 percent."
13721,"Antibody surveys of segments of the population have become a useful way to gauge what percentage of people were infected and what groups were most at risk, especially since there was limited testing for the virus during the first wave."
13722,"The new paper, which has been accepted by the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has substantial limitations: Of the 45,000 New Yorkers in the study, fewer than 3,500 were Black, a major underrepresentation."
13723,"And the participants were recruited partly through advertisements online, which the study’s authors acknowledge may have attracted people who believed they had been exposed to Covid-19."
13724,But the study adds to experts’ understanding of the disproportionate toll that the pandemic has taken on Black and Latino people.
13725,Its findings also come amid a push to vaccinate more people in the United States.
13726,"A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the number of Americans, particularly Black adults, who want to get vaccinated has continued to increase."
13727,"According to an analysis last month by The New York Times, Black people were still being inoculated at half the rate of white people."
13728,The disparities are especially alarming as Black and Latino people and Native Americans have been dying at twice the rate of white people.
13729,"In New York City, about 44 percent of white adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 26 percent of Black adults and 31 percent of Latino adults have, according to city data."
13730,"Experts and community leaders across the country say that over all, the lower vaccination rates are linked to technological and linguistic barriers and disparities in access to vaccination sites."
13731,Other factors include social media misinformation and a hesitancy to be vaccinated.
13732,"Hesitancy among African-Americans, experts say, can be tied to a longstanding mistrust of medical institutions that have long mistreated Black people."
13733,"The recent data from New York “show how frontline workers bore the brunt of the first wave of the pandemic,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study."
13734,"She noted that many jobs with higher levels of exposure — like grocery store employees, child-care providers and transit workers — have comparatively fewer white workers."
13735,"“These were the people who did not have the luxury of being able to work virtually,” she said."
13736,"Dr. Kitaw Demissie, who is dean of the School of Public Health at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and was not involved in the study, noted that household crowding may have also contributed to differing infection rates."
13737,Some predominately Latino neighborhoods which were particularly hard hit in the first wave had high rates of household crowding.
13738,How do you differentiate those who are vaccinated and those who aren't at a grocery store?
13739,Or do you think we should just have one last hurrah before the rona is over?
13740,"Who would have thought, that of all people, Kesha would be so ahead of her time (when she said she brushes her teeth with a bottle of Jack)?!"
13741,!
13742,[removed]
13743,They are almost certainly fighting over the same resources at this point.
13744,Their production problems stem from Pfizer and others using those resources to make more doses faster.
13745,"As someone else that checks Texas numbers daily, it’s almost infuriating hearing people on here that don’t live here talk about Texas."
13746,Just hope the moths don't go on strike or get moth blight or some weird shit
13747,Do you experience vaccine scepticism in SK?
13748,What about after dose 2?
13749,Where are you seeing rhetoric that says it doesn't work?
13750,CDC says vaccinated prime can gather with no worries privately.
13751,Isn't that decidedly saying it does work?
13752,"I live, work and shop in areas that are pretty crowded with foot traffic, I'd rather just put the mask on before I leave my house and keep it on until I'm clear again, than take it off and put it on over and over again as I pass by 5 people every block."
13753,"We're not told in advance what vaccine we will get, nor are we offered a choice."
13754,It's take what you're offered or decline.
13755,China is clearly producing a lot of vaccines.
13756,A lot more than Europe and the US at least.
13757,[removed]
13758,"&gt;Looking out over a sea of jostling, maskless faces gathered at a political rally in West Bengal on Saturday, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, proudly proclaimed that he had “never ever seen such huge crowds”."
13759,A mask was also noticeably absent from Modi’s face.
13760,Why do politicians of a certain leaning always do this?
13761,"Pretty much,  but it is ignoring actual facts that makes them look like they are just biased or ignorant and then one has to question everything they say which leaves their message is ineffective and unheard."
13762,This is where thinking for myself and reading facts really is useful.
13763,Are we not celebrating the vaccines when CDC says vaccinated people can gather privately with no worries?

13765,WITH
13766,You risk dying by leaving your house every day.
13767,You risk dying by consuming alcohol or driving in a car.
13768,This risk is hilariously low.
13769,If everyone in Germany took this vaccine 240 people would die.
13770,"Meanwhile, 3000 people die in automobile accidents a year in Germany."
13771,"Yeah, that's good, just give them a truckload of vaccines to take back."
13772,Working until a variant pops up that bypasses the vaccine protection and is far more deadly.
13773,"Well, the US better also be the biggest source of vaccines going into Canada then."
13774,Everything they do is targeted at the behavior of the public in aggregate but Americans think in a very individualist mindset.
13775,It’s “what do I get out of these rules?” as opposed to “what do we all get out of following these rules together?”
13776,WHO continues to demonstrate they simply are not credible.
13777,No one should confuse the potential of a world health organization with the sad reality of WHO.
13778,This is weird.
13779,:) What do they gain by not completely unblinding it at this point?
13780,It was...
13781,"Unpleasant for 24h, specially the first night, although the second one was OK and the next day (I mean, 36h after the shot) I was perfect."
13782,Paracetamol is your friend
13783,"AZ isn't live virus, it's a DNA segment embedded in a different virus which is used as the vector."
13784,Live attenuated virus is its own category.
13785,There's also protein vaccines.
13786,"The big Dave Blake line for today: CFR (case fatality ratio) at new low for the pandemic, which is reason to celebrate!"
13787,https://twitter.com/_stah/status/1384810786107891713
13788,"I posted this elsewhere but I still find the statistic interesting:

&gt;On February 24, Michigan recorded a seven day daily average of 1,208 new cases, and the country had its average at 68,604."
13789,"On April 9, Michigan went up to 7,614, the country went down to 67,927."
13790,&gt;This means that the country went down by 0.98%.
13791,"But without Michigan, just Michigan, those two dates for the country would have given us seven day new case averages of 67,396 and 60,990."
13792,That would have been a decrease of 11.10%.
13793,It's difficult to really comprehend what a massive impact Michigan is having on the country's case numbers.
13794,"I'm not trying to down play it, but the narrative we'd been seeing that ""The country's"" case number had stagnated was just misinformation, or at the very least a bent truth."
13795,"There are other states that had to deal with rising cases as well, but most states are heading in the right direction and Michigan was so far away from the normal numbers that the normal numbers need an asterisk to accurately explain."

13800,Flossing removes food from teeth and gums - does it's job pretty well.
13801,I won't deny the fact that the marketing for most products in general are misleading to make money.. that's how things work though.
13802,Simple fact is even if it doesn't remove plaque it still does it's job of removing food.
13803,Not sure how this corporate slander shit will strengthen anything you say other than coming off as kinda crazy.
13804,It's already being administered .
13805,"It is very rare, but the disease hasn’t been around that long."
13806,The CDC said that natural immunity can go away in 3-8 months.
13807,The rate of reinfection is going to increase as the earliest COVID-19 patients get exposed.

13813,Mask mandates should be focused and of limited duration.
13814,"believe me or not, straight to jail"
13815,This person is way too proud of not flossing like ew.
13816,Ok. I’d maybe keep that to myself however the smell must tell everyone what they need to know.
13817,Keep in mind the government is under reporting the cases.
13818,3 months is provably false.
13819,J&amp;J grows in how effective it is for the first 2 at least.
13820,Moderna and Pfizer are showing 90% efficacy after 6.
13821,"After 6 no one knows, but it's been speculated that a part of the immunity may be life long."
13822,Lockdowns were a terrible idea and never sustainable.
13823,"Society has given up enough and it has chosen to not care about covid any more, that's why compliance is super low."
13824,My life has been wasted enough now.
13825,All because of this hubris and superior ethics that say you must always treat someone.
13826,Let's put the responsibility on society instead.
13827,Put a limit on how many people with covid can make it to the ICU and let people take the gamble with their lives if they want.

13841,Just got my Moderna software upgrade a few minutes ago ;).
13842,How long does it usually take for side effects to show up after second dose?
13843,Wondering if I have enough time to run a few errands before the side effects kick in.
13844,help them immediately w/o question.
13845,"Personally, I think this is a huge mistaken on the part of the administration/CDC."
13846,"They had a chance to say ""the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner we can get rid of masks/social distancing"" but they did not and now people are wondering why even get vaccinated if nothing changes."
13847,I have heard this very line from coworkers who were already hesitant before.
13848,But if you're an illegal immigrant detained in Texas?
13849,Yeah Michigan and Florida are totally equivalent spring vacation destinations 🙄
13850,"I said “relationships I should spend more time on”, doesn’t meet I’m going to cut people off."
13851,Values !== opinions.
13852,People that share the same values can very much have different opinions.
13853,I think the key here is really crushing SEVERE covid and reducing transmission.
13854,This is missed in a lot of vaccine papers and isn't really highlighted.
13855,"If you catch covid but don't have a chance to transmit it AND you don't die we're going to lower overall community transmission, lower group mortality rate, etc."
13856,Once someone has natural covid they also bump up their own antibodies.
13857,I mean we all know that Modi did that to look fearless and cover up his killing of minorities.
13858,Your government could have cared about your people so idk why you’re comparing India to the US.
13859,Massively under-reported.

13864,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04709835?term=roche+covid&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3
13865,I stand corrected then.
13866,I thought Israel was following the UK model.
13867,The US has already lost influence.
13868,Many of us in Canada now look to the EU as the western leader as they sent vaccines and America refused.
13869,"After 4 years of Trump trade wars, Canada is not exactly getting a positive vibe from Biden."
13870,"A) floss is like $5 or less for a roll and lasts a decent amount of time, no one is wasting $ that could be better spent
B) have you ever flossed?"
13871,"I do daily and there definitely have been times I got stuff out that brushing didn’t get, that would have formed plaque that needs scrubbed by dentist
C) I had a deep scaling done a few years ago because I had dropped the floss ball for being overwhelmed with twins and another child I was asleep at the wheel flossing wasn’t top of the list, after that deep scaling I will go to the end of the earth to floss since that is what caused it (mainly)
I mean, if you think it’s silly then you don’t have to floss but to act like it’s being pushed for profit makes me think you’ve never bought it"
13872,"If my workplace allowed fully-vaccinated employees to ditch the masks and have normal meetings, most of us would be happy to work in the office at least 2-3 days a week."
13873,There's very little motivation to go in now because of the masking/distancing requirements and meeting restrictions - we can have Teams calls just as easily from home without the hassle.
13874,This guy specifically mentioned the flu vaccine though which is good for 3-6 mos or so.
13875,"Even better: while in undergrad at the same rural D3 university, we were told by our history teacher about that time they visited the Soviet Union as a class trip."
13876,"Well, one of the students *didn't get one (1) of the vaccinations* in the USA ahead of traveling to the Soviet Union."
13877,"At arrival, the Soviet Union vaccinated said student on the spot, to allow him to enter the Soviet Union."
13878,Do I support the state forcing unwanted vaccinations?
13879,"***Absolutely, 100%***"
13880,The thing is even if every American put their life on hold for 13 months the pandemic would still have lasted this long.
13881,Congrats on your moral superiority but it’s completely unreasonable to expect everyone to be able to put their lives on hold for 13 months
13882,That is completely irrelevant.
13883,"9,300 metric tonnes is a trivial amount compared to requirements, and it was industrial, not medical, thus being a different product."
13884,The real point is that you need the right gas with the right specification in the right places at the right time.
13885,This is an absolutely crap article.
13886,They should be ashamed for publishing this.
13887,Does he also claim that the millions dead are somehow less impactful than the roughly zero dead from the vaccine?
13888,That seems very common these days.

13890,"The [Indo-US Vaccine Action Program (VAP)](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/indo-us-vaccine-action-program) played an important role in bringing the two groups together (prior to the COVID pandemic), which led to this partnership."
13891,Who is the actor
13892,so you shouldn't have relationships with people who have different values?
13893,Sounds like a great way to live in an echo chamber.....
13894,She sent covid patients to nursing homes.
13895,Saw this yesterday and I was happy that it could be a sign of the increase stopping and turning around.
13896,"I know sometimes you see it zigzag a bit, but I’m being hopeful for now."
13897,keep telling yourself that lil stinky breath boy

13899,"They could make ad hoc sytems easy enough, especially with a little help from society."
13900,Fans blowing air through an old barrel filled with cloth and charcoal could be made easily and sit outside of normal ventilation and draw air away from people to clean it and then redistribute it for instance.
13901,"&gt; teeth look cleaner

Huh your gaps in your teeth are that dirty?"
13902,It's not cleaning any of that but ok...
13903,I guess I just thought that this sub wouldn't have science deniers on it but I guess we are here aren't we.
13904,Great news!
13905,I didn't quite get 100% efficacy against severe infection
13906,"Luckily the death rate is 0,000285%, which is a more fair comparison to IFR."
13907,This post appears to be about vaccines.

13910,*
13911,So higher than dying to COVID if you're young.
13912,"No thanks, rather get COVID then."
13913,Yeah I think so.
13914,The US is focusing on it's own population first which honestly makes sense.
13915,It is bizarre to me to see the EU exporting vaccines while it also complains that it doesn't have enough for it's population and its citizens complain about having to wait for a shot.
13916,"Well, it's being rolled out to everyone right now."
13917,It sounds to me like your anxiety is getting the better of you.
13918,"Variants form in the sickest populations, though."
13919,"Yes, the countries that have access to vaccines."
13920,"Most do not, and we are going to see the ""Haitian Variant"" or the ""Senegalese Variant"" pretty soon as a result of countries prioritizing healthy 30 year olds over international elderly people."
13921,"not really, yesterday's numbers were smal because we didn't get anything from Walgreens due to an error."
13922,They leveled out last week but everyone in Chicago is now elligible I expect we will see big numbers the rest of the week
13923,I thought of that but it’s kind of a moot point.
13924,"If your mask is “infected” then not using a mask just means you get the virus directly on your face...

A mask, even with those not perfect scenarios is still a win."
13925,AZ hasn't been approved in the US and honestly it may never be.
13926,There's really no reason to stockpile it here.
13927,Will just coment your last part.
13928,"Everything has an evolutionary deadend, speaking of virus, specially if they mutate too fast."
13929,"Most mutations arent ""allowed"", same with combinations of them."
13930,"With vacines, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions we pressure the virus to mutate faster (not the other way around: people think that if it spread at will it will mutate faster and thats wrong)."
13931,"Eventually, it wont be able to mutate in the way it needs OR he stays here forever if he is able to thrive like flu, but coronavirus has a ""error-proof"" system that most likely will ""kill him""."
13932,Yup exactly.
13933,Can’t imagine someone telling me to go to their destination wedding 3 months in advance like no.
13934,"Yeah, sorry, it's my third language but from what I understand he's trying to say ""learn how percentages work"" because the alternative sounds extremely autistic to me."
13935,"1 in 70,000 is low."
13936,The population of the UK is 67 million people.
13937,"This equates to 950 Thrombosis potential cases in the entire country, if everyone got vaccinated with AZ."
13938,"127,000 people in the UK have died from COVID so far in the UK."
13939,I’m just using math.
13940,"No they said they KNOW it lasts that long, odds are it last
Longer, ppl who survived the original SARs had immunity some 10 years later."
13941,"&gt;just risk dying for the sake of your community

I'll wait thanks."
13942,We paid for vaccines.
13943,Americans refused to deliver.
13944,It was the EU that stepped up and allowed private companies to fulfill the contacts they signed.
13945,I hate it when you asses just pass it off like the odds are low like it won't happen to me.
13946,Have you seen my luck?!
13947,Fuck that
13948,Your list has 2 of the most liberal states in it and 2 of the most conservative.
13949,How do you come to the conclusion that it’s “the political divide” from that list?
13950,&gt;1/70000 isn't low at all.
13951,Yes it is.
13952,"You don't take the vaccine for yourself, you take it for the sake of the community."
13953,A 1/350.000 risk of dying is pretty much negligible.
13954,"Our vaccinations have stalled, so..."
13955,[removed]
13956,All in all Wuhan didn’t actually get hit THAT bad considering how big the city is.
13957,"They didn’t end up using a lot of the temporary hospitals spaces, and they were starting with much lower healthcare capacity that you have in developed countries."
13958,It means nobody who had the vaccine got severe Covid19.
13959,But the rhetoric makes it sound like the vaccines are pointless and thus bolstering the idiots who don’t want to take it cuz it “doesn’t work” and it may cause more gullible ppl to rally the there side.
13960,Too a lot it makes it seem like the only way shit will get back to normal is when there is 0 community transmission which frankly will be impossible.
13961,"Wow, you guys are unbelievable."
13962,"Even if everyone was already vaccinated, you would refuse to admit that the pandemic is over and push for continued restrictions using a vague fear of mutations."
13963,"""people lying about being vaccinated""
I've seen this sentiment a bunch."
13964,My thinking on this is meh who cares.
13965,"At this point celebrating the vaccine and its effectiveness to get all the people we can to get their vaccine is probably going to save more lives than ""staying the course in this final hour""."
13966,Everyone has access to the vaccine and we are seeing demand slow.
13967,Give people more reason to get vaccinated.
13968,Let's promote it and start to transition away from the complaining about how people can't wear a mask.
13969,You really get a 1 shot kill bonus also.
13970,The US threw money at the problem recognizing the benefit of getting the economy back running again.
13971,Why did the rest of the world decide to try to be cheap and save money?
13972,You blow that horn.
13973,"Prevailing winds ... *metaphorically*        

I'm sure there's a lot of cheating going on but the border is closed."
13974,😉🤨🤔
13975,Don’t be on the golf course when it storms and it’s even less.
13976,All aboard the TrumpTrain!
13977,"It’s been a year and a half people are already out and about even without any sort of vaccine, it’s not ideal but that is the fact of the matter."
13978,Especially in less developed countries where people cannot just afford to stay home.
13979,In that case 78% is better than no vaccine.
13980,There will be much less deaths from people vaccinated with a vaccine at that efficacy and being lax than not having a vaccine at all.
13981,"Besides, even if people are vaccinated with it they are still going to have to wear masks if their country mandates masks."
13982,DC metro.
13983,"And then, ridiculously, after glaring at people in the wide open outdoors, people go to a restaurant and promptly take off their mask when they sit at their table, seated 10 feet away from someone else."
13984,I guess they think there is a bubble of invulnerability around restaurant tables?
13985,The masks aren't about science or spread... they're about social shaming.
13986,"Given the population of India is in the billions, preventing the virus from surging into the majority of the people is critical."
13987,"Not just because the death toll will be felt for generations but because the volume of people requiring care, both covid and non will overwhelm the system and possibly see a huge swing up in deaths."
13988,"Which makes it especially upsetting that a lot of countries with supposed ""free healthcare"" still don't cover dental."
13989,"If I want to see a dentist for a routine cleaning in Canada, I'm paying out of pocket because I'm uninsured."
13990,I hope to god I never need a major surgery.
13991,That is outstanding news.
13992,Can they scale production up quickly?
13993,India can use all the help they can get.
13994,Same.
13995,There are some people who I now see as total cowards.
13996,A Merv 13 furnace filter taped on a box fan works as well.
13997,True.
13998,You just make stuff up.
13999,I forgot.
14000,Probably not.
14001,That's what Ocugen is for.
14002,They will be in charge of finding manufacturing and then distributing.
14003,He better not do that
14004,That's a pretty convoluted way of thinking about this.
14005,"If you can't separate the place from something which is named after the place (not vice versa), you need a reality check."
14006,We can't all be Tintin.
14007,WTF happened in India?
14008,It seems like just a month ago people were praising them for their covid response.
14009,I really hope so... our healthcare system has already collapsed.
14010,And non-covid patients are dying because all the medical facilities have been redirected towards covid patients.
14011,Anyways.
14012,I apologise again.
14013,Why would you force people to wear masks to protect others who refuse vaccines?
14014,"At that point, it's their problem."
14015,That’s very good to know.
14016,Thanks for teaching me something!
14017,"If anything they should give more to Mexico and Canada because these two countries are doing much worse case wise than Japan or Korea, all while being our neighbors"
14018,Only leftist scum need proof.
14019,"People who die of COVID are those who got ""severe"" COVID."
14020,"If nobody goes severe, nobody dies."
14021,"No offense to Canadians but your definition of ""leadership"" seems to boil down to ""whoever gives us the most stuff"" and I'm not sure why you guys have skipped right past blaming your government for its vaccine procurement shortcomings and landed on Biden."
14022,"Staggered vaccination stages are likely more effective, which is why everyone is doing them."
14023,"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-do-we-get-back-to-normal-fastest-prioritize-access-to-the-vaccine/

The current variants in circulation would be there regardless, because they’ve emerged in areas that have not had a widespread vaccine rollout yet."
14024,"(Hell, nobody has had that yet except Israel... but UK and US are catching up.)"
14025,"Let him volunteer in a Covid ward with no mask for a week, and he will change his philosophy very quickly."
14026,"A stroke is seriously damaging, better to act first and ask questions later"
14027,"Data doesn’t support your argument:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

MI has had 89k cases  per 1M."
14028,"Big states: CA: 94k, TX: 94k, FL: 98k, NY:101k."
14029,Statistically this isn’t far off in cases per capita.
14030,"This likely more speaks to the political divide and a big chunk of MI blatantly disregarding social distances, masks, etc."
14031,I think this is where the vaccinations are really going to show up in the stats.
14032,Fatalities have been focused on 15-20% of the population and those are now 80%+ vaccinated.
14033,So CFR should basically fall by about 70-80% starting a few weeks ago.
14034,"Even where I work, where safety is literally always first over anything, we don’t need to wear masks at our desks."
14035,Just toss it on when you’re meeting someone or out and about.
14036,"&gt; import more than 100m doses this year

I hope this doesn't mean import from India?"
14037,I was in no shape to work whatsoever.
14038,I ran a fever about 12 hrs after the shot.
14039,Then I was just utterly exhausted the next day.
14040,Getting up to go to the bathroom left me completely spent.
14041,Walking to the couch left me out of breath.
14042,I felt like death the entire time as well.
14043,Oh no worries I think we got wires crossed.
14044,I do believe the ban will be lifted soon.
14045,Bioreactor bags.
14046,Pfizer being approved for 12-15yo will be key.
14047,There’s a crap ton of community spread among that age and families with those ages literally have no recourse of protection.
14048,Once that’s offered up that will help more families normalize.
14049,I can’t see mask mandates lasting as strongly past when that is available.
14050,Because people will be led to think they're perfectly protected from severe illness and thus drop all precautions.
14051,78% efficacy against infection means 22% can be mildly infected and contagious to others which will help keep the pandemic going if restrictions are lifted too soon.
14052,Unfortunately that 22% won't be all be mild cases and when you start talking about tens of millions of people you're going to be looking at hundreds of Covid deaths amongst vaccinated people and many times that from unvaccinated people who catch it from carefree vaccinated folks.
14053,You get x2 stack and hit point bonus for J&amp;J
14054,"That's a very reasonable explanation - less herd immunity than many other states, couple with relaxing the restrictions they had right at the time the UK variant was exponentially growing

Probably a lot of other factors too, such as weather, and whichever combination of factors that led to Michigan being an early hotspot in 2020 (likely combo of weather, international travel via DTW and manufacturing industries, etc)"
14055,It’s 100% wild.
14056,They could have at least sent a text as soon as they knew.
14057,If they want people there they gotta make the effort.
14058,that shouldn’t matter at all
14059,"I don't think there are real time updates or anything, but this site that I think you're referring to https://www.vaccinespotter.org is the best thing I've found."
14060,"You can run it on a state and see at a glance where appointments are available, but this changes literally every few minutes."
14061,Yesterday I saw dozens of appointments open up at Safeway in my area and they were gone in literally 10 minutes.
14062,"“The British variant’s warpath”

The level of fear-mongering anthropomorphism of the Covid virus is just so ridiculous"
14063,Both are true.
14064,And those protests didn't happen until later in the summer.
14065,A small group of idiots that protested do not represent all of the 10million people who live in the state.
14066,"It's because Whitmer has thrown her hands up claiming her hands on are tied and seemingly has given up trying to enforce restrictions, despite the CDC recommending we shut down."
14067,Then she blamed the white house for not sending vaccines when we have empty appointment slots and some cities  in northern MI and the UP can barely fill them.
14068,This is the same pattern of behavior we saw last year with the masks issue.
14069,"Although, that I think did actually have a bit to do with a certain former administration."
14070,"Basically, unfortunately, our government - both right and left in the state of MI - have made this political and now we are all suffering because of it."
14071,I'm referring to the NYS legislature.
14072,"Post power removal, they have the ability to block any modifications or extensions to outstanding restrictions."
14073,One realistic scenario could be that Cuomo tries to remove the mask mandate everywhere but NYC (in a similar flavor to this past winter's indoor dining ban).
14074,De Blasio could then proceed to encourage the legislature to modify the directive to include NYC as well.
14075,Oh... okay... my bad then.
14076,I interpreted your comment the wrong way.
14077,I thought you were saying he is doing the right thing.
14078,"That’s completely false, Pfizer is still in the 90 percent tile"
14079,HAS
14080,"It's kind of a joke, I live in Korea and everyone was so proud of how well corona was contained at first, now barely anyone is getting vaccinated."
14081,At the current rate it's going to take 7 years to vaccinate everyone
14082,"I only had the sore arm, nothing else."
14083,I was really happy since I had a competition to worry about lol.
14084,Thanks
14085,Thanks man!
14086,Dude.. Brazil and India’s healthcare systems are collapsing because of variants.
14087,So do you mind being more specific?
14088,"Killed vaccines are usually less effective overall, and the spike protein has been one of the most stable parts of the virus, I think?"
14089,Which is why everything else targets it.
14090,"So it could, in theory, but it could also be less effective (targets some other part of the virus)."
14091,"If I recall correctly, spike proteins are common targets by the immune system anyways, because it renders the virus innert once disabled (can’t dock with cells to inject genetic material)."
14092,"That’s all a bit too in-depth, for me, though."
14093,Lol it's 80 MILLION fully vaccinated people 6000 got sick and 60 or so died... MILLION with an M not thousand... That's a 99.9992% chance of not getting the virus...
14094,So yeah you're safe from the virus completely.
14095,If the number was 80/6 I would agree but it's not...
14096,It's 80 M I L L I O N.
14097,Then that should be made clear by health authorities “the vaccines are the key to ending this.
14098,"Once we reach most of the population, then we can end mitigation measures, until then please stay cautious.” They aren’t explicitly communicating that and continually waffling!"
14099,It needs to be more transparent.
14100,"Not to nitpick, as I generally agree, except with one thing:

This is purely anecdotal, but we had the largest spike post-Halloween here(big house party holiday)."
14101,Insane spike.
14102,"I don’t think that enough people did the right things on NYE/Super Bowl Sunday to avoid new spikes, from my observations."
14103,I just think that there was already significant herd immunity amongst those that did the wrong things.
14104,"Thanksgiving, it seemed pretty split."
14105,"But the house party days, it seemed to be close to normal activity."
14106,Same with giving away donuts.
14107,It'd go down much faster if we could get the holdouts in the Southern half to go get vaccinated.
14108,"Dumb as rocks, some of them."
14109,"Hold up, there's an actual Warpigs taproom in Copenhagen??"
14110,"I thought it was just a production collaboration, that rules!"
14111,[deleted]
14112,"Maybe that's your experience, but NPs legally are held to a higher standard because their role is different from a nurse, and they have a wider scope of practice."
14113,That's the truth.
14114,Conflating NPs with nurses at the bedside is misleading.
14115,"I never said they aren't nurses or that they're pseudo doctors, but it's disingenuous to not recognize the differences between the roles and scope of a standard nurse and any APRN."
14116,Ok.
14117,But what about TWO vaccines?
14118,Then in your opinion why does this discussion thread even exist?
14119,They asked a legitimate question.
14120,I can Google any thought I have in my head and I’ll come up with 100 different versions of the facts.
14121,This is also implicitly good news for those with natural immunity who often go dismissed or ignored in these conversations.
14122,"Similar thing going on where the message is mistakenly ""up to"" [amount of time] instead of ""at least"" [amount of time]."
14123,The only reason we can't claim it's longer for either case is because the virus itself literally has not been around long enough for it.
14124,I asked because My mom is a nurse and she keeps telling the same story of a coworker that tested positive post-vaccine to try to guilt trip anyone who wants the masks to come off.
14125,"&gt;That sign in the bathroom about washing your hands, that's only for the staff, right?"
14126,"""When fully vaccinated individuals meet other fully vaccinated individuals, physical distancing and the wearing of face masks can be relaxed, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a set of guidelines published Wednesday."
14127,"The rules can be relaxed even when vaccinated meet people who have still to get the shot, as long there are no risk factors for severe disease or lower vaccine effectiveness in anyone present."""
14128,The CDC literally said this like 3 weeks ago now
14129,They work but mrna is the way
14130,Why?
14131,That doesn’t make sense
14132,"Well, vaccine passports would resolve this easily."
14133,But so many people here are against them cause “muh freedoms”
14134,Like Johnson and Johnson?
14135,LoL or like AZ that's been banned in more than a dozen countries?
14136,Or like Pfizer and Moderna that are still in Emergency Use and not fully approved by the FDA?
14137,Bharat Biotech has published their results in the Lancet for peer review.
14138,God I hope so.
14139,"With the vaccine available to everyone I’d love the indoor mask mandate to be lifted in the next couple months, though maybe that’s a pipe dream."
14140,"I’ve worn my mask diligently the entire pandemic, but I’m so tired of wearing it at the gym particularly."
14141,I understand it’s helpful and also understand it’s too soon at this very moment to lift it with vaccinations only recently having been opened to all.
14142,"Idk I guess I’m just venting, I hope the end is in sight for mask mandates that’s all."
14143,Looks like we might be back on the downward trend of cases.
14144,This time for good.
14145,Thanks!
14146,"Just got mine, I hope yours went through well also!"
14147,[deleted]
14148,Most anti-vaxxers don't distinguish between vaccines.
14149,"That said, this was rejected as a move in the UK in part because it was perceived as unfair to lock everyone up for ages to protect the oldest members of society and then allow those oldest members to have much more freedom potentially months before younger people."
14150,There was A LOT of anger in the UK covid sub any time it was suggested that measures might be relaxed for vaccinated people before vaccines had been offered to all.
14151,"I'm not massively in either camp--I do think it's fair for everyone to exit restrictions together, but I'm not really mad about the alternative and suspect vaccinated people are likely to mingle regardless--but it's worth noting the strength of feeling it can evoke ."
14152,"Given the Trumpy contracts OWS signed, exports of filled and finished doses will open up after those contracts are fulfilled."
14153,"So it's ""number of doses produced"" driven not demand driven.. unfortunate but very in line with the previous administration's policy goals."
14154,"The good news is that production is going to stay ramped up, so once those orders are completed the floodgates will open for Canada."
14155,"&gt;Pandemics end

This is kinda a dumb statement, some pandemics wipe out entire species."
14156,So does brushing... You do know the liquid from brushing can get in between your teeth right?
14157,And I'm not joking.
14158,Big companies suck.
14159,"Big clothing like nike and under armor aren't better than their competitors it's just ""name brand"" neither are any type of glasses cause they are all made but luxxotica... Big glasses sucks!"
14160,!
14161,"Hopefully since Covaxin is an inactivated virus, and therefore doesn’t specifically target the spike protein, the immune response will be more comprehensive and give the virus less chance for immune escape."
14162,"If the US had completely given up on any restrictions since last summer like India has, and was now facing a crisis and asking the rest of the world to send them materials, every other country would be telling us to go fuck ourselves."
14163,"My apologies, I'm having discussions with several people in this thread and confused your arguments."
14164,Thr 60-70% absolutely has been consistently said is the goal line to cross for herd immunity.
14165,I'm not sure how you can argue otherwise.
14166,"As for easing restrictions, the WH has said 14 days of downward trajectory in cases should occur before anything is loosened."
14167,As for 100% ending things-metric.
14168,Maybe you're just not paying attention to the conversations?
14169,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/07/covid-vaccine-lift-restrictions/

The reality is there's multiple arbitrary metrics we can use."
14170,"I also question the logic of ""people aren't complying because there's no set in stone end date""."
14171,"I suspect the people who aren't complying are the same ones who weren't this whole time, and are just, for lack of a better word, assholes."
14172,And more of an incentive to get the damn vaccine!
14173,Most likely they caught it from someone who was symptomatic and got tested as a precaution.
14174,Unfortunately I don't think there's anything you can do.
14175,... what’s wrong with vaccinating everyone each year?
14176,"Like, why are people so upset with this?"
14177,Two shots a year for freedom seems pretty great for me.
14178,"The point of vaccines is the same as the point of masks &amp; distancing, to save lives."
14179,"It appears like vaccines are so effective that extra protection from masks/distancing will be unnecessary, but from enforcement point presumably these restrictions should stay in-force until vax adoption is high enough."
14180,So many countries would give anything to have your oversupplies.
14181,I just hope it will be used before it is expired
14182,"Here you go buddy 


https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/5-800-covid-19-infections-detected-among-77-million-fully-vaccinated-people-cdc.html"
14183,Lucky.
14184,My second Pfizer shot took me down for the count.
14185,"But, if he personally wants to keep wearing a mask why not?"
14186,That something is allowed does not mean is mandatory.
14187,I’m glad they have these recommendations but right now anyone could pretend they have been vaccinated.
14188,So I understand hope this person does not want to lower his/her guard.
14189,Once fully vaccinated if allowed here I will enjoy lowering my guard when I’m in trusted settings but I understand some may prefer to remain careful until the virus is circulating less
14190,It's been talked about sooo many times.
14191,Your chances are extremely small.
14192,A miniscule percentage of people have tested positive after being vaccinated.
14193,Walking around maskless post-vaccine is not reckless.
14194,And there's zero reason to be staying home as much as possible.
14195,"Or people who are speech pathologists, or foreign language instructors, or teachers of the deaf."
14196,No one seems to care about how they are struggling.
14197,Awesome.
14198,"Roughly in order IMO:

The population in India skews younger than in US/Europe, healthcare options vary more widely (meaning that as the systems become overwhelmed you’ll see more severe cases as management options become limited), and we currently lack data on how variant strains differentially affect age groups but do have some indications that some variants have a more severe progression in younger people."
14199,"If the us were a small nation, they wouldnt ever pull something like this."
14200,The free market is only awsome when we need to impose it on others.
14201,Meaning it will only take the CDC and FDA 6-9 more months to reach this same conclusion!
14202,No one can tell you the exact chance.
14203,I can tell you on average your risk of dying of covid post vaccination is on the order with or even likely lower than the flu.
14204,"If you wouldn't stay home to avoid the flu, you don't need to stay home to avoid covid post vaccination."
14205,"&gt; The facility has not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture or distribute Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine, and none of the doses manufactured at this plant has been distributed for use in the United States."
14206,The average r/coronavirus user would rather 1000 die of covid than 1 die of an extremely rare side effect.
14207,"1678 have died of coronavirus in Germany in the last 7 days, worrying about the 12 deaths due to an extremely rare side effect is just looking at the wrong thing."
14208,"Even if you vaccinated the whole of Germany with AZ (which isn't happening) you'd be looking at under 250 total deaths, they currently get that every day from COVID."
14209,"Now you can argue about risk benefit for young people but given the drastically lower rates in the UK and how close the risk benefit was for the under 30s here, I'd be surprised if in Germany it wasn't just better for everyone to get the first vaccine they are offered regardless of whether it's AZ or not."
14210,I am becoming increasingly convinced that COVID will become virtually eradicated in NYC by the end of May.
14211,"With our world-leading natural immunity being concentrated in communities with disproportionately low vaccination rates, it's getting really hard to see how this virus can spread for much longer."
14212,This post appears to be about vaccines.

14219,"According to Youyang Gu’s model, he had first doses peaking last week."
14220,So it seems we should expect a decline now in overall shots.
14221,I already told you the US threw money at the problem.
14222,Why didn't Germany throw money at the problem?
14223,Why didn't the EU?
14224,Now they're looking at lockdowns again and the US is debating if we need masks with even the most conservative saying they won't be needed by the end of summer.
14225,Because you're not including the frequency and risk involved.
14226,"If you've been doubly vaccinated, the probability that A) you have Covid, B) you're contagious with Covid, C) you transmit it to a child, D) the child catches it, E) their case is serious enough to threaten their lives, and F) all the medical assistance available from a not-overwhelmed health care system isn't enough to save them starts getting very low."
14227,"On the other hand, you're balancing against having to remember your mask, put on your mask, clean your mask, properly position your mask; plus the costs of manufacture and disposal of masks."
14228,All this is not zero-cost.
14229,"Hell, there's even the risk of injury just because of the loss of downward peripheral vision."
14230,"These costs are low too, but they exist."
14231,I think your non-understanding is that you'd always prefer to spread costs among as many people as possible rather than have a few people suffer greatly.
14232,"And there's a logic to that, but the problem is that if you *always* take that view, eventually all those costs pile up and then *everyone* is suffering greatly."
14233,It got politicized the moment we started asking people to change their behaviors in order to mitigate the spread of the virus.
14234,"There were always going to be people whose normality bias simply could not be overcome, and there were always going to be politicians willing to make hay out of people being inconvenienced--and corporations willing to profit off of maximally inconveniencing people."

14236,"Denmark started their corona pass system, where you need either the vaccine, earlier infection, or a negative test (within 72 hours I think) to access indoor restaurants and other venues."
14237,Rapid test is okay.
14238,Warpigs in Copenhagen offers a test and beer on the patio for 149dkk (circa $25).
14239,You can then move to the restaurant in 15 minutes as long as it's negative!
14240,[deleted]
14241,This is very concerning.
14242,It’s a massive country with a massive population.
14243,"If it’s your thing, I don’t understand why you can’t just pray at home."
14244,Horribly sad.
14245,100 percent agree.
14246,"Thanks, appreciate it"
14247,"A lot of them yes, although there isn’t much data on that as of yet."
14248,CDC also says if you’re fully vaccinated and exposed to covid you don’t need to quarantine.
14249,Explain that one?
14250,I've always found it interesting that in most countries with universal healthcare basic dental care is limited or nonexistent for anyone over 18.

14451,USD$800k means something different in the two countries.
14452,Sorry I just am not really understanding what the authors want to happen in Nashville?
14453,"Nashville, like most American cities, is super uncentralized."
14454,"I'm sure there are different music orgs and whatnot heading the city, but the Mayor resumed business-as-usual (aside from a slight capacity constraint) almost a month ago and it's on the onus of the establishments to recapture demand."
14455,Not really sure what NPR wants the municipal government or state government to do about that.
14456,Intervene more and personally call musicians/fans to come play/watch at these establishments?
14457,Could make sense.
14458,1st dose I only had some popping of my ears for a couple days.
14459,"2nd dose, which I got just 2 days ago, I got at 1pm."
14460,"That night I got chills, body aches, hallucinations."
14461,The next day i felt like I got hit by a bus lol!
14462,"Fever, body aches, headaches all day long until about 4pm."
14463,"Once my fever broke I felt so much better but man, i havent felt like that in YEARS."
14464,I dont get sick often.
14465,Im 36.
14466,"No, that's not how it works."
14467,"Efficiency is calculated vs the placebo group; more infections just means quicker data, it won't in itself impact the relative infection rates of the two groups."
14468,Nobody has a problem with anyone who chooses to wear a mask outside if it makes them feel safe.
14469,You do you.
14470,We have a problem with government telling us we also have to when there is no scientific reasoning that says we ought to.
14471,The risk is nowhere near high enough to justify an outdoor mandate.
14472,"Weird, cause 50% of all vaccinations in the UK are AZ and look at the numbers."
14473,Yeah so fully vaccinated here.
14474,"Still wear a mask in public but it is exactly what I thought, the chances of getting or spreading covid are extremely miniscule, even the variants."
14475,I got the J&amp;J shot and it seems like it might be slightly better at protecting from the variants.
14476,"I think people just keep saying ""oh we don't know much about post-vaccinated as data is still coming in"" but I think the data is pretty clear."
14477,If you're vaxxed you are good.
14478,Masked then virtually impossible.
14479,HIV is a really weird virus that makes it a terrible comparison to any other virus.
14480,"Covid doesn't insert itself into your DNA and systematically destroy your immune system, which makes it significantly easier to vaccinate against."
14481,"So far none of the variants are showing total vaccine escape, so even if they have a slightly better chance of infecting vaccinated people, herd immunity is still going to slow them down to the point where we don't need to worry about them much."
14482,"I mean yeah, isn’t this what a vaccine is for?"
14483,"yeah isn't reinfection more based around how you body fought it off the first time, don't some people fight it off with out producing specific anti bodies to it but instead simply take care of it with tcells"
14484,"Its a humanity problem, religion removes common sense."
14485,"I dont think its just religion thats the problem, but religion has been a real pain in the ass world wide over this pandemic."
14486,"If your god doesnt understand you need to take safety precautions about a virus it created, then maybe your god is not worth your worship."
14487,this guy Indianas
14488,Same for being struck by lightning.
14489,Fox news is the only site that I'm sure probably says that vaccines don't do shit.
14490,They've been saying that for a very long time... Their followers went to a health summit the other day to burn masks and hangout inside...
14491,They are crazy.
14492,All websites should be telling you .0008% because 6000/8 million is that number...
14493,"Yes, it's only BJP that's conducting election rallies in India."
14494,Other parties are quarantining.
14495,/s
14496,So how does Osterholm still have his job?
14497,"On January 27        
&gt;Osterholm said."
14498,"“You know, I worry the next six to 14 weeks could be the darkest weeks of the pandemic."
14499,3 months later deaths are at the lowest point since October
14500,"If people are motivated to lie, those cards cannot be used as proof"
14501,"In DC metro mask wearing and general compliance of the restrictions is high, but it is also a very suburban place so generally pretty easy for people."
14502,"That said, people wear masks in all kinds of nonsensical situations that I just don't understand."
14503,"Alone in the car with the windows rolled up, jogging or biking or kayaking, inside their houses."
14504,If you forget to wear a mask in a public place you'll get scolded and/or glared at by the staff and most people around you.
14505,It's a little over the top.
14506,"I was at an outdoor mall hangout type area which has a 50 foot wide TV that normally plays ads and random videos or whatever, and it had a PSA that played every few minutes with a voice that droned, ""I wear a mask because I love my family"", ""I wear a mask to keep us safe"", ""I wear a mask to stay healthy"", etc."
14507,I swear it felt exactly like a propaganda video from 1984.
14508,You can also get the vaccine in Washington DC through CVS and Walgreens without using the pre registration website
14509,isn't preventing hospitalisation the primary concern?
14510,We wouldn't even care about COVID as a society if it didn't kill and cause our hospitals to be overwhelmed.
14511,[removed]
14512,The speech therapist and students could both use face shields during a speech lesson.
14513,"That would reduce risk somewhat, though it would be important to do the speech therapy in a well ventilated space, and ideally a fast action test could be taken earlier in the day so that the risk of transmission between the student and therapist is reduced further."
14514,"I have been paying pretty close attention to these conversations and am in complete agreement with that waPo article, which I’ve seen before, where they lay out recommendations for clear metrics for restrictions-lifting."
14515,What is proposed in that article sounds great to me!
14516,What I want is something like what’s proposed in that article to be made as the official restriction-lifting policy in my state.
14517,"But unfortunately, the people that wrote that article are doctors and not the ones making policy, and there remains no detailed official reopening plan in most states."
14518,"I really wish my state officials would listen to reasonable people making recommendations like this, like Dr. Monica Gandhi, but seems like they are not

Sounds like we mostly agree but my problem is still with the fact that there is no detailed, official, full reopening plan, just vague promises upon vague promises"
14519,nice.
14520,"i hope it comes true

would be lovely"
14521,"Huh, I didn’t know that."
14522,Interesting that Islam is the exact opposite and requires quick burial.
14523,How?
14524,&gt; The group who's going to lie about being vaccinated probably isn't wearing masks anyway.
14525,"Midwesterner here, can confirm this is how people act"
14526,"yes, people lying about being vaccinated is a much smaller issue than people not getting vaccinated because they feel nothing will change after they do."
14527,change the national messaging
14528,Yeah whats that a Danish vaccine?
14529,"I just got my second shot, and while I'm fine with wearing a mask in public for a little while longer, I intend to start hanging out maskless with my vaccinated friends again as soon as I hit my two week mark."
14530,"The problem isn't efficacy, the problem is that given how utterly slow AZ has been in fulfilling their contracts, these doses would come years too late."
14531,"Possibly mRNA vaccines are safer and more effective, but as important, Pfizer and Moderna are on track to deliver exactly what they have promised the EU."
14532,"You can have the best and safest vaccine, but if it is not delivered in decent quantities it is a worse candidate."
14533,This is the case especially for AstraZeneca.
14534,Found the randian.
14535,"I’m saying that I’ve seen several people assume that everyone who has to wear a mask for a full time job hates it, and that’s just not true."
14536,[removed]
14537,"No, just weld them inside for 2 weeks at the same time."
14538,The logistical challenge of trying to vaccinate everyone annually is daunting.
14539,How many extraordinary steps are being taken to do this first round of shots?
14540,"Might end up being a single combo flu/Covid booster, mandatory for hospital staff and encouraged for anyone else who wants it, like the current flu shot program."
14541,Janssen????!
14542,?
14543,Doctors knowing to expect something that is both lethal if untreated and lethal if treated with the first drug they would usually reach for makes a large difference.
14544,Patients knowing they *can* be having a stroke like event even if that makes no sense makes a *huge* difference.
14545,"Never mind the chance of actually getting covid from a passer-by who is within range for about 3 seconds is about the same as being hit by lightning, or that even the CDC doesn't advise wearing masks outside."
14546,"It makes me realize how based in fear and paranoia so many people are, and how willing they are to be self-righteous about it."
14547,"All gas, no brakes is better."
14548,Another 100 mil AZ doses will take them about 15 months to produce at current speed.
14549,The 260 mil still not delivered another 39 months.
14550,Why should the EU buy doses they will likely not recieve before 2025?
14551,[removed]
14552,I am yes
14553,[removed]
14554,They *are* saying the vaccines are working.
14555,They’ve been unambiguous about that.
14556,"You’re redefining what working means to mean preventing community spread from an individual’s vaccination and that’s not how they work

If you actually to what they said instead of reformulating what you wished they said, you’d find them to be a lot more specific"
14557,"&gt; Good on our government for doing the right thing, the right way."
14558,Ah yes the right way.
14559,Be super slow on pre-ordering vaccines and then use your clout to bully your way to the front of the line anyway via export bans.
14560,"You're confusing ""the right way"" with ""the American way."""
14561,What if every country behaved this way?
14562,Not just with vaccine doses themselves but with the raw materials needed to make them?
14563,"The lipids for the mRNA vaccines come from the EU, UK, and Canada."
14564,The largest syringe exporters are the EU and China.
14565,The list goes on.
14566,"If every country employed US-levels of nationalism, even the US itself wouldn't be able to vaccinate everyone."
14567,It's also interesting to see how thrilled Americans are that their country imposed an export ban on private companies.
14568,I guess people suddenly like Communism when it's convenient.
14569,Build the wall!
14570,"Yeah i understand what you mean, but that only works for a limited time."
14571,At the start there are productivity gains due to learning.
14572,But at a certain point you stop significantly improving.
14573,We are now at least  half a year (probably 9 month or so) after production start.
14574,Most teething problems should be solved.
14575,Most processes should be optimized.
14576,Still AZ delivers about a 6th of what they sold.

14590,How about take the masks off.

14602,Is he ok?
14603,Is he safe?
14604,Well that means it’s working and they’re not getting severe cases!
14605,I think people are going to find that more and more places are going to require the vaccine as we go forward.
14606,i feel like if everyone/almost everyone has the option to get a vaccine waiting 2 weeks-ish after that to start dropping more and more restrictions on the vaccinated would be a good thing.
14607,decent compromise and it provides more incentives to get vaccinated
14608,Yeah seems a bit complicated.
14609,Question would be if cross border travel is deemed essential because you're going to get vaccinated.
14610,"Yes, if they cosign a loan."
14611,"Damn, it’s really slowing down."
14612,I figured the slow down would start for a few more weeks.
14613,I guess we’ll soon hit a point of everyone who wants them has them.
14614,Yeah otherwise what’s the point
14615,"&gt; That said, it is true a US government official said they're never going to use them anyway so the point still stands."
14616,When did this US government official say they're **never** going to use them?
14617,"&gt;I honestly don't see why you're arguing so hard against helping a poor country without asking for something in return....

Mexico isn't a poor country and there's at least 50 extremely poor countries that need more assistance than Mexico does."
14618,"They don't have money to pay for it, do not have orders with Pfizer, Moderna, or AZ, and don't have the means to negotiate expensive contracts with global pharmaceutical companies."

For gods sake, quit playing dumb."

14630,"What I said was ""And I can not wait for people like you, to get what you deserve.""...."
14631,"How you interpret ""what you deserve"", is your problem."
14632,They sold the UK 100 million doses - that was the deal.
14633,"Kate Bingham, the UK vaccine chief, who clearly knows more about it than you and me, said that the 30 million target was presuming the production went perfectly."
14634,In reality producing new vaccine with all the components comes with difficulties.
14635,Hence the 4 million once it was approved.
14636,Over time those difficulties get reduced and more is produced within the same factory and machinery.
14637,The big issue is going to be finding a way to replace staff who would refuse to get vaccinated.
14638,Our early numbers showed around 20 percent of staff would quit if our company mandated COVID vaccines.
14639,Almost all nursing homes are perpetually understaffed and can’t take that kind of hit and maintain federal and state staffing requirements.
14640,The only way I see the vaccines becoming mandated will be if state/federal regulations require them (a possibility for nursing homes).
14641,"Otherwise, no organization is going to mandate it, because they know they will hemorrhage staff and the other companies will scoop those staff up in a heartbeat."
14642,[deleted]
14643,There will be a shortage of vaccines for at least the coming 1.5 years.
14644,Thus we need all the vaccine production we have in the world.
14645,This virus could add extra production by using the currently unused (for COVID-19) whole inactivated virus vaccine production lines in both Europe and America.
14646,"Currently only China is producing whole inactivated virus vaccines, and European manufacturers might prefer to produce Valneva vaccines instead of  Chinese vaccines."
14647,Valneva might turn out to work well against variants.
14648,"And the vaccine hesitant people might be fine with this vaccines, as quite a lot of folks are calling the mRNA vaccines and to a certain extent the vector vaccines as experimental."
14649,So you might be able to get the vaccination grade even higher with this vaccine.

14660,My wife is fully vaccinated and due to give birth in June.
14661,Her doctor today informed her that she would have to wear a mask during labor.
14662,"Given the data on the vaccines, the effectiveness and extremely low transmission probability, why is this still a hospital policy?"
14663,"Even J&amp;J will likely still get approved, just with a warning label and/or contraindications."
14664,It's very valuable because it's significantly easier to transport and administer than the mRNA vaccines.

14679,"The phone call itself, about 30 minutes."
14680,"They ask for basic info like name, date of birth, social security, and address of you and the deceased."
14681,"Then info like the date of the expenses, address of where the deceased passed away, etc."
14682,"All you need really is the death certificate, a copy of the funeral contract would help as well."
14683,"At the end of the call they give you an address where you can mail everything, a registration ID number, and they email you some links if you want to check the status of your application by creating an account."
14684,Then you mail in a copy of the death certificate and receipts or invoices or bank statements or whatever you have as proof of payment.
14685,"Note that the name of the applicant must be the name on the invoice or funeral contract, and you can add up to 1 co-applicant."

14698,We can’t even if we want to though.
14699,"By the time we can get vaccinated, risk group will probably need boosters."

14726,Smoking doesn't = getting high
14727,Most doctors will update vaccinations while doing regular checkups.
14728,However checkups tend to be less than yearly for most of those who aren't vaccinated yet (the 16-30 group is the only one with vaccine numbers low enough to worry about right now)
14729,But the problem is that they literally cant get vaccinated(talking about the EU here).

14998,Just based on the percentages it would be around a 0.5% chance.
14999,BUT there's no correct answer to your question it's all based on the individual.
15000,I think you'd have to purposely aggressively expose yourself to someone with Covid to even have a chance of getting it.
15001,"Heh, I guess I thought that number would be a bit higher."
15002,"No, this could be very relevant by summer."
15003,Many EU countries are on track of vaccinating their adult population by mid-July.
15004,The latest developments in deliveries makes this a more and more realistic goal.
15005,Perhaps some notoriety bias in reporting coming into play here.
15006,"People are more likely to report any side effects following AZ vaccine and likewise, doctors are more actively investigating."
15007,Lmao this vaccine is such a PR and safety disaster they are having to literally remove a health authorities recommendation due to safety issues to try and shift stock.
15008,Soon they will have to pay people to take this
15009,I think people will flat out stop wearing them in places like this far before they formally allow it.
15010,Cheers pal
15011,In lots of states no doctor’s offices have access.
15012,"This discusses it https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/21/states-covid-vaccine-problem-483872

While pharmacies are convenient for some people getting them into regular doctors/urgent cares is needed to reach the full population."
15013,So we're just ignoring all the long term effects seen in even mild cases?
15014,I am honestly dumbfounded that over a year in people still think that if you don't experience a severe case of initial disease you have nothing to worry about.
15015,Some adults who just had mild sniffles ended up in the hospital months later from complications related to covid.
15016,&gt; Chances of getting a blood clot from Covid is 39 out of 1 million which is 8-10 times higher than the vaccine.
15017,Is this also accounting for your chance of getting COVID?
15018,"If you have a 39:1,000,000 chance of getting blood clots *after* you get COVID, you also need to include the chance of getting COVID before this is a fair comparison."
15019,"Yeah, and I don't have to be nice to other people as well, but I do it anyway."
15020,Mask wearing is no real hassle and will be over pretty soon anyway as community spread levels go down.
15021,This isn't like not being able to go to the store or the movies or anything.
15022,This is not some big burden.
15023,"&gt;Where’s the risk of passing Covid on to my kid who can’t get vaccinated yet

Much, much lower than passing COVID onto your kid if *you* were not vaccinated."
15024,"If you care about your kid or family, get a vaccine!"
15025,I’ve said it before I’ll say it again...there’s gonna be an amazing South Park character made to parody him.
15026,"Because scientists aren't supposed to predict the future, and he cannot possibly see every single factor, especially for a novel virus."
15027,thanks for the info!
15028,added!
15029,&gt;   I can’t see mask mandates lasting as strongly past when that is available.
15030,oh please.
15031,"First it's ""protect the at risk people"" then we can open up, then it's ""protect every adult,"" then it's ""protect 12-15 year olds."""
15032,"It's not the right time to drop all restrictions but I""d much rather drop everything a few months too early than for flu season to roll around and for the cdc to try to make us wear masks to   
""stop the spread."""
15033,"Yes, I""ll be accused of using a strawman but for every crisis the u.s has had, the response has dragged on far too long pointlessly."
15034,"Think 9-11 tsa, war on drugs, etc."
15035,"Spouse and kids are sick with cough, sore throat, sinus."
15036,Everyone got tested and at two separate testing locations.
15037,All negative.
15038,I thought for sure it was covid.
15039,It’s weird to think of being sick with anything but covid.
15040,"I think it includes Sinovac global production, thus Indonesia and Brazil production as well, it seems."
15041,But this sub told me it was just like the flu.
15042,I mean the third surge was almost completely isolated to Michigan and New York otherwise the trend would have been pretty good
15043,I agree it's not there yet.
15044,But it looks like that point is rapidly approaching.
15045,"We've seen a slight downturn in US vaccination rates over the past week, without a corresponding reduction in deliveries."
15046,The US has a bit more than 60M unused vaccines - just about a three week supply at current vaccination rates.
15047,"Polling suggests about 60% of adults will get the vaccine ""as soon as possible,"" and over 50% of adults in the US have received at least one dose, so we should expect demand to start significantly trailing off soon."
15048,"Now is the time to start talking about relaxing export restrictions, so that the US has a framework in place when the time comes."
15049,"The number, yes!"
15050,But the way its written up without putting things into perspective paints a skewed picture of reality.
15051,I've had people straight up tell me they ( may) wash their hands before using the bathroom.
15052,However rarely after because their privates are cleaner or they didn't touch them at all.
15053,There's a reason why I don't eat at potlucks.
15054,The problem is your sarcastic comment are exactly similar to what anti-vaxxers are using as comment but without the whole sarcastic part.
15055,There is no way to differentiate.
15056,"I know Israel is now completely open internally- but they still have heightened restrictions of people going in and out of their country, more than they usually do."
15057,"They had an extremely strong lockdown as they were getting vaccinated, something the US did not have."
15058,So it will likely take the US longer.
15059,"Or maybe ""I didn't say India but I meant India""?"
15060,"&gt; immunocompromised 

These people, who I feel very bad for, had problems pre-Covid and will have problems post-Covid as well."
15061,Communicable disease risk will never be zero.
15062,And there's no reasonable expectation whatsoever for outdoor mask wearing to continue just because someone might be immunocompromised.
15063,its not the mask wearing thats the problem or that bothers me.
15064,idgaf what someone wears outside.
15065,"its the total lack of awareness, common sense an complete gullibility of people who believe literally anything they see or read on TV/internet/social media, that not only bothers me but is the reason this country is goin downhill."
15066,with cali leading the way.
15067,people trust internet fads an headlines more than facts an the truth.
15068,[This page from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) shows the status of over 100 vaccine candidates.
15069,"Agreed, death rituals are serious business, and not something that can easily be put off because of a pandemic."
15070,I'd be having a pyre in my backyard for sure.
15071,I know several of them.
15072,"This idea everyone loves working from
Home is false."
15073,Many people need separation in their spaces so that things don’t blur together.
15074,There have been pandemics throughout all of human history.
15075,"All of them ended, almost all of them without vaccination."
15076,"Some amount of people will continue to catch covid, every year, for the rest of forever."
15077,So you won't just have a situation where nobody's getting it until a critical mass of unexposed people builds up and an explosion occurs.
15078,"It's going to become an endemic, circulating disease."
15079,"There are hundreds of pathogens that circulate around the human population constantly, this will just be another of them."
15080,"Kids will catch it while they're young, just like they do flu and rsv and other respiratory infections."
15081,They'll build some immunity from that.
15082,"They'll continue to be exposed throughout their life, some of them sometimes catching it again, but not as severely as an adult now who's never been exposed."
15083,"We'll continue vaccinating people, like we do for flu, as necessary."
15084,Some people won't take it.
15085,Some people will get sick.
15086,Some people will die.
15087,But it won't be half a million in one country dying in the span of a year.
15088,"Flu kills ~32,000 every year in the US, even though pandemics of novel influenzas have killed people in a manner far worse than this pandemic we've experienced."
15089,"After it burns through the population, it recedes into the background as just a regular circulating strain of flu."
15090,Does it count production outside of china?
15091,"(There's over 40 million produced doses in Brazil, because Sinovac licensed)."
15092,canada next
15093,I understand what you're saying but I wear those paper disposable face masks more than 10 hours a day running around a grocery store and sometimes having to work outside.
15094,It's not as bad as those cloth/homemade masks a lot of people wear.
15095,It doesn't get as hot and sweaty.

15264,"Honestly, who care if conservatives say they were right all along, especially if they were(at least in part)?"
15265,Repeating a suboptimal pandemic response to spite a political ideology is textbook idiocy.
15266,I would hope public health scientists wouldn't be so petty.
15267,"Let me be clear, I'm not saying my original comment is the perfect strategy."
15268,I have confidence that out public health scientific community will study the massive amount of data we have from this pandemic and move forward with a improved strategy for next time.
15269,I'm confused.
15270,Didn't know herd immunity was a sliding scale or spectrum.
15271,"In this usage, does “fully vaccinated” simply reflect both doses of a two-dose series, or is the +2 weeks reflected in this data?"

15277,"As much as I think mask-aversion is dumb as hell, during summer heat masks are a bit like water boarding yourself with your own sweat."
15278,Not everyone gets to work (and live) in air conditioned environments.
15279,"While the misery was worthwhile last summer, now that I'm fully vaccinated I would really appreciate being able to be unmasked at work whenever the heat index gets into a high risk zone."
15280,I think mask guidance should be loosened for the summer with a recommendation that people wear something in enclosed air conditioned environments with many other people.
15281,It should be reassessed in the fall when kids return to school and mask wearing would not create heat stress with the potential to be brought back of covid risk remains high but otherwise just being recommended for those who feel comfortable wearing them for the rest of the pandemic.
15282,"We should also maybe reassess our timeline for trials in kids, if the biggest concern while vaccinating kids is really the antibodies they produce when given a vaccine (honestly 100% the #1 reason for a vaccine to be immediately killed off in trials or pulled from the market historically), the risk of auto-antibodies is far lower when exposed to the spike alone rather than the whole virus."
15283,We should be seeking to minimize exposure to the whole virus using vaccines in the US where we are not using whole virus inactivated vaccines.
15284,"I work with the death side of medicine (transplant) and (this is probably just some kind of confirmation bias so brain of salt) I've noticed a lot of our ""dropped dead"" cases lately have ""COVID positive x months ago"" annotated somewhere."
