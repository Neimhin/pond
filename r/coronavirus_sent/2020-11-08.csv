3,"Governor Gnome wasn‚Äôt elected to be a leader, that‚Äôs your job!"
4,You said you had a problem with Biden listening to scientists.
5,I find that a strange issue to have since that science is conducted in a methodical and factual manner - there's zero idealogy tied to it.
6,"Of course you can make comments on that, but to have any real discourse you would need more than basic information."
7,I'm in one if the many lockdown countries right now due to methodical research about increasing covid rates.
8,I may find it shit but I could never say its wrong as there's unbiased evidence to the contrary.
9,I'm more than free to diagree but it would be objectively wrong.

61,The minks in utah have been dying by the thousands from COVID.
62,No word on any action at the state level to actually force them to cull them all.
63,It's time.
64,I'd suggest Fauci is best placed to head up the reform of the CDC.
65,"It was turned into a puppet by trump and is going to need someone with credibility to reform the whole thing, top to tail, and make it independent so this kind of fuck up can not happen the next time."
66,Covid task force is a simple role - you follow the maths and the best practice (that's already understood) and stomp hard on any state blowhard who tries to get in the way.
67,"It's rote work, they just need a plan and a timescale."

74,I did appreciate that it was a more distanced gathering at the speech itself.
75,"I thought everyone sitting on the cars was a smart, very on bramd American look and choice."
76,Plus masks abound.
77,LOL Fauci literally said ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt block droplets.‚Äù This has nothing to do with the changing of beliefs.
78,"This wasn‚Äôt over years or decades, nor with a powerful cigarette lobby standing in the way, but his tune changed over only a few months."

82,If the senate is deadlocked the Vice President votes to break the tie
83,All of Canada is under a mask mandate.
84,The feds mandated it.

86,"Again, I see them nearly all wearing masks, plus its outside where its actually very very hard to transmit infection from one person to another."
87,That's... sad.
88,"As long as the scientists don‚Äôt suggest anything that will curtail any liberty and freedom, all will be good."
89,Yet Clackamas isn't on the list (yet).
90,Don't try to take this milestone from them.
91,"It's proven safe in phase 1 and 2 trials, you know, the ones they do for safety."
92,Phase 3 is to try to see if it actually works.
93,That phase is ongoing.
94,Obesity makes literally everything worse
95,Outside with masks = low risk.
96,"I see almost universal mask wearing with the Biden celebrants 

Also its near impossible to transmit covid from one mask wearer to another outside."
97,"Think about it - the droplet has to escape your  mask, fly around, evade the UV degrading factors, not get blow away, fly around and thru the mask of someone else AND it has to do that again and again to reach a viral load high enough to create infection 

I mean, thats seems very very unlikely 

the data shows people being INSIDE restaurants, bars, churches, etc breathing recycled air are what is driving the infection rates"

It‚Äôs ok, we know you‚Äôre most likely not going to die if you‚Äôre young, but since you have less severe symptoms you‚Äôre also less likely to notice them, which makes you more likely to transmit them to others before you know you‚Äôre infected."

368,However this type of situation is *extremely* resource bottlenecked.
369,"Not only are people with expertise to treat limited, but the medication equipment and even space are as well."
370,As case count increases the resources available will be spread as thin as possible until eventually triage dictates that they be dedicated to patients most likely to survive.

651,I imagine he was probably not wearing a mask around trump so plenty of chances to infect other people...
652,I work in nursing homes and this is absolutely a huge issue.
653,"I am a therapist, we work on a productivity standard, and between recent regulatory changes and all the deaths in nursing homes most nursing home employees, even skilled employees with advanced degrees, have to work in 2-3 nursing homes to make ends meet right now."
654,It is a huge vector for the disease.
655,I received notice this week that an employee in one of the buildings had contracted COVID and I was exposed.
656,"Because that employee had to work in three different buildings to keep her family from starving, patients and employees in three separate buildings were exposed."
657,This is the way that the company passes all of its losses downward to the employees rather than the owners taking a financial hit.
658,The therapists I know who have refused to go work in other facilities are sometimes getting as little as 10 hours a week and these therapy/nursing home companies won't even furlough them so they can go on unemployment.

666,France has been ramping up for a bit now.
667,They were hit hard early in the pamdemic but had it under control through July and most of August at 0-0.01 percent of the population testing positive (USA saw 0.09-0.15 growth each week during that time frame).
668,"In early September they were seeing about 0.07-0.09 percent of the population test positive each week, and by mid October they were up to 0.22%, then the next week 0.29%, last week 0.33%, and this week 0.57%."
669,So it has really been blowing up since late August/early September.
670,"I don't think it can really be attributed to a particular event or gathering or anything, it's just the exponential growth of this virus."

744,"If they had been conditioned to care about others, they wouldn't be sociopaths."
745,Same as Japan.
746,"Everyone here expects that the numbers are so low because the cases may be mild enough (likely due to masking) that people aren't bothering to get tested (even if testing were widespread and easy to access, which it's not -- they only really test the severe cases that end up in the hospitals)."

781,"Like school shootings, there's just no solution..."
782,This guy is going to take some getting used to.
783,The problem with testing is the high false negative rate.
784,"Even if you mass test the whole population, you'll still miss maybe half the active infections."
785,"It's not entirely clear what the actual false negative rate is as it depends on the kind of test conducted, whether the person is showing symptoms, how many days it's been since symptom onset etc., but from what I understand it's anywhere from 30-70%."
786,"So mass testing is a way to isolate many of those who do have it, but you still miss a large number of carriers that go on to spread the virus."
787,"So while it likely will have an impact in reducing the spread, it seems unlikely that mass testing alone is sufficient to eradicate the virus."
788,Highschool is mandatory for at least 2 years.
789,The government decided to lockdown highschools mostly because of transportation.
790,Public transports were unable to follow covid regulations because of too many students (which most us already knew would happen months ago).
791,For middle schoolers that wasn't such a problem because most of them went to school with their parents

800,I could see weekly updates laying out best practices to address covid.
801,In short order it will be clear that states that follow the advice will have fewer deaths and more open economies so hopefully the laggards will follow suit.
802,"Many studies point to ""socially active"" people as the single cause of this pandemic."
803,"Without them, transmission would not be above 1, even in winter."

1."

806,2.
807,"When numbers are down, make tests mandatory for social gatherings and known high-risk groups like students, religious people and certain workers."
808,"In case of non-compliance, all costs in containing an outbreak, including health costs, have to be paid by the non-compliant."
809,That's an amazing result.
810,They've identified thousands of people in the community that can be treated that won't continue spreading the virus.
811,"but the conversation wasn‚Äôt about animal rights, it was about how animal agriculture is a problem generally."

819,This time next year we'll have 3 million dead americans from this and related causes like heart attacks or appendicitis that couldn't be helped because hospitals are full.
820,"(Yes I would count those as covid deaths too) and people will still go, ""Oh, that's less than one percent of the population."""
821,There's going to be a whole generation who don't know or have a vague memory of what a grandparent is.
822,Did you read the Atlantic article and watch the Dr. Seheult video?
823,The rapid tests are *in*sensitive enough to pick up *only* high viral load -- the time that the person is infectious.
824,"They can be used to prevent infections, in the sense that you test yourself, find that you have a high viral load, i.e."
825,"the test returns positive, so you don't go to work/school and don't pass the virus to colleagues/classmates."
826,I can't think of any way tests could prevent infections *other* than that.
827,"Masks and distancing remain good ideas, of course."
828,"At the White House, I suspect that a number of people in fact were not tested."
829,Who knows?
830,"I‚Äôve had a pack of extra long toilet rolls in my boot since April, bought during the Coles/woolies community hour time."
831,Not opened.
832,I forget it‚Äôs even there.
833,"I had colleagues who almost ran out, though."
834,So it was a backup for everyone.
835,"But still - I agree, in Adelaide we are very lax and it‚Äôs quite scary given the possibility of a second wave - will people remain lax or be vigilant?"
836,As someone working in the second dirty hospital on the list (after RAH) it‚Äôs quite scary if people do not.
837,Emergency powers mean I can be directed from my reasonably isolated location to the hospital front line.
838,Putting passengers on 2 train lines and my family at much greater risk almost every day of the week during peak hour.

876,Outsiders look at USAs inability the control the virus similar to that of a third world country squalor
877,Sweden have excellent sick leave systems including taking time off to look after a sick child at home instead of sending them to school sick because you fear losing your job.
878,Swedes get something like 90 days a year protected sick leave and after that the employer has to offer you an alternative position.

1043,"In ancient China, the Dengwen Drum was used to hang a drum outside the courtroom so that those who had a grievance or urgent case could hear the case by hitting the drum."
1044,"The ""Dengwen Drum"" was first recorded in ""The Epistle of Wu Di"" during the Northern and Southern Dynasties of Wei, Jin and Jin, and was followed by many other dynasties."
1045,"We often see in movies and TV shows that the aggrieved people would beat the drum at the gate of the government office to cry out for justice, and the drum beaten is the Dengwen Drum."

In the 18th year of Hongwu (1384), Chen Shouliu, a farmer from Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, was oppressed by Gu Ying, a local official, and was so angry that he and his friends and relatives tied Gu Ying up and sent him to Nanjing with a Da Qiu (Da Qiu) scroll on his head to complain to Zhu Yuanzhang."
1047,"After learning what had happened, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered Chen Shouliu to be imprisoned, and rewarded Chen Shouliu with 20 silver coins (equivalent to 12,000 yuan today) and exempted his family from taxes for three years."

1242,"They were seeing whether they could reach some form of herd immunity with the school children and younger adults to try to remove them as vectors, regardless of whatever they  say."
1243,It became clear to them that a vaccine was far off say middle of 2021 for wide scale vaccination to have happened and even then uptake would be low perhaps 40-50% and effectiveness not guaranteed.
1244,Long way off and economy not doing well.
1245,They let the number of cases go up for a very long time before doing anything about it and it became clear they‚Äôd only do something if their hospitals were projected to overflow or the death rate went up unacceptably.
1246,Which I suppose is sort of understandable but it was odd with cases so high how everyone was going about more or less like normal.
1247,We kept waiting to see if they‚Äôd do anything and nothing happened.
1248,"Even now with the current restrictions, its just a joke."
1249,There were 87k cases yesterday!

1261,Those are of course under patent protection.
1262,I remember reading about Jimmy Carter's experience surrounding Reagan's inauguration.
1263,"There had been reports that the US Iranian hostages were going to be released as soon as Reagan took office, but nothing had been confirmed when Carter left for the inauguration."
1264,"After the inauguration, Carter either returned to the White House to find out, or asked someone who would know, what the status of the hostages was, and was told ""I'm sorry, sir, that's classified."""

1304,"Meanwhile, only 25 thousand testings are performed in Japan everyday."
1305,At this point I'm wondering if enough people in some non-compliant populations have had it at at this point (and so now have antibodies) that the R number has dropped in that sub-population.
1306,"R0 only applies when all members of a group are susceptible, if 20-30%+ of people having house parties in a high infection city have antibodies, then adding in public measures that are not down to personal compliance (closed businesses and public spaces), that could actually be affecting the spread."
1307,R being lower than R0 could explain it.

1313,"Yes, but the trials and approval process would have to begin all over again."
1314,"If this spreads widely, it will mean *at least* another year of isolating."
1315,"/u/opelan is right, but you're right too that latitude isn't the sole factor of temperature."
1316,I think natural selection would still pursue a less deadly strain because of how **we** react to it.
1317,"Frankly the whole reason SARS-cov-1 died out as fast as it did those years ago, is because the 30%+ mortality rate scared the shit out of people and got the infected countries to lock down and snuff it out fast."
1318,"There's something insidious about this ~1% mortality rate where it's clearly bad and can kill tons of people, but is still somehow palatable as personal risk to people where they don't want to be inconvenienced or asked to sacrifice over it."
1319,"-----  
 
So, as long as the virus continues to kill people, people will want to stay inside."
1320,"But if it becomes less deadly and people sense that based on reporting or actual medical data, they won't be as inclined towards fear and would be willing to go to a bar where they contract and spread it - thus better propagating the virus even though the replication takes place before mortality of the host."
1321,Important to note: this 15 minutes has to be without sunscreen!!
1322,"You'd think no duh, but in a skin care subreddit there was a thread talking about this exactly."

I wonder what happens when poor people gets Covid-19 and dies."
1406,Do they even get to test and know that they have it?
1407,"Do they then get timely ventilators from any hospitals they can choose, or will they have to wait until their conditions worsen at home and then get carried to die in hospitals?"
1408,"&gt;U said cure, not me, so dont act like I‚Äôm stupid for not knowing you think cure and healthcare are the same thing

Seems like projection over here."

1524,Somebody also needs to be guarding Obama's portrait or it might get slashed or graffitied in the last days.
1525,Why did president Biden let this happen?

1633,"They either treat experts like they're not even people, are somehow so smart that they're stupid, or, worse, are part of a giant worldwide conspiracy to make one person look bad."
1634,I'm really hoping things go back to some degree of normal.

1653,"It only became ""a permanent change to the world"" because the dominant animal on earth, human beings decided it *should* be."
1654,"The virus doesn't need your decision to become a permanent part of the life on earth, it just needs you to not decide to remove it."
1655,"If you *want* a world with billions of people who are able to take a plane to visit another part of the world, you are going to have to adapt to the permanent risk of transmitting diseases that comes with the wish for a permanent logistical network like we have now."
1656,"Stuffing everyone together in small workspaces under the threat of being fired and starve for lack of money, insisting that pathogens that kills people should be allowed to spread for the sake of keeping industry ""living"" or simply making people live on the streets, is not compatible, with the ""normal"" that you claim that you want to see a return to."
1657,"It is not just a matter of your own national borders, it is also a matter of which countries you want to have business with and if you let a pathogen spread that other countries had a degree of success in stopping, they will begin to look to other business partners, because as they fail to contain the virus, they will realise that you needed that to happen in order to be able to continue travelling around freely and cross over their borders like you used to do."
1658,"Epidemics is nature's own way of forcing ""social distance""."
1659,"If you want to be in control of what nature is doing to the global population, we are going to have to adapt to the laws of reality so we can make sure we can actually keep this society that you seem to think is somehow a ""permanent part of the world""."
1660,"Right, I didn't even think about the owners."
1661,I guess until I'm discussing with my parents what care they need eventually I'm far from aware of what the standards of nursing homes and agencies that organize care at home are like.
1662,"In Japan and Germany I hear that they do slightly better, still their social network and infrastructure is not comparable to North America, and standards still vary from home to home."
1663,"One of my German grand mothers was lucky and the family paid for a private home (I didn't ask about the monthly fee, still I bet it was roughly four times the rent of a 3 bed room apartment in the same area)... and that's maybe still not a guarantee a lot of money flows into care taker's salaries and more to owners, right?"
1664,"I understand that like probably everywhere in the world and many job sectors most care takers are well trained and still on relatively low pay, often including immigrants that take jobs that most citizens won't go for and that may need to take 2 or 3 jobs."
1665,"Sounds like only an extreme, unrealistic (?)"

1778,We need a minimum 4 week national lockdown to accomplish anything close to curbing the virus.
1779,"Lock down, slowly open things up in extremely limited capacity with actual rules and mandates in place that are enforced, and pass legislation to financially take care of everyone until a vaccine is rolled out."
1780,We need coronavirus funding until June 2021 at the earliest.

1782,We can do this.
1783,"If a lockdown isn't in the cards then we should be allowed to volunteer to stay home and receive compensation for it while the people who want to go to work and live ""normally"" can do so."
1784,"I'll take one for the team, assign us case workers to make sure we're following the rules of such a program and only going out for essential needs."

1817,Did you think that people who are changing jobs otherwise *aren't* suppsoed to do that?
1818,"Except now it's a shit tonne of people who have to pass info all at the same time, instead of a few at a time naturally."

When comparing the inferred proCoV2 sequence with genomes in their collection revealed no full matches at the nucleotide level, Kumar‚Äôs research team knew the original timing of the start of the pandemic was off."
1906,"‚ÄúThis progenitor genome had a sequence different from what some folks are calling the reference sequence, which is what was observed first in China and deposited into the [**GISAID**](https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/hcov-19-genomic-epidemiology/) SARS-CoV-2 database,‚Äù said Kumar."
1907,**The closest match was to genomes sampled 12 days after the earliest sampled virus that became available on 24 December 2019**.
1908,Multiple matches were found in all sampled continents and detected as late as April 2020 in Europe.
1909,"Overall, 120 genomes Kumar‚Äôs group analyzed all contained only synonymous differences from proCoV2."
1910,"That is, all their proteins were identical to the corresponding proCoV2 proteins in the amino acid sequence."
1911,A majority (80 genomes) of these protein-level matches were from coronaviruses sampled in China and other Asian countries.
1912,"These spatiotemporal patterns suggested that proCoV2 already possessed the full repertoire of protein sequences needed to infect, spread and persist¬†in the global human population."
1913,"**They found the proCoV2 virus and its initial descendants arose in China, based on the earliest mutations of proCoV2 and their locations."
1914,"Furthermore, they also demonstrated that a population of strains with as many as six mutational differences from proCoV2 existed at the time of the first detection of COVID-19 cases in China."

2086,Joe Biden is 0% responsible for the spread of Covid-19.

2104,I like the fact that he is working hard to come in prepared.
2105,"If Trump's recent behavior is anything to go by, he is not going to be helpful at all during the transition period, so Biden is going to have to get himself prepared as much as he can."

2448,if Biden were smart he'd hand out free N95/KN95/KF94's in highly impacted Red regions where the virus is out of control and the populace is resisting masking and distancing measures.
2449,These high-filtration masks do in fact protect against build up of viral load that causes infections.

2492,But that's the problem- when people don't do their part your entire argument of how to control this pandemic falls apart.
2493,It can't be controlled 'village to village' when half the village is trying to control the spread and half isn't.
2494,I literally can't protect myself and my family if other people continue to do risky things.
2495,"No matter how much I isolate outside of work, I still have to spend my 9 hour work day locked in a room with 20 other people who are not following the same rules."
2496,That's where the function of a government should be to step in and pass reasonable restrictions on what people can do and enforce them.
2497,It becomes a matter of 'your right to swing your arm ends where my face begins'.
2498,They did this pretty early on in British Columbia as well.
2499,"I'm in a part of the US where masks are ""required"" in businesses, but it's not enforced at all."

2527,At the store I work at they are doing a little bit every weekend leading to black friday.
2528,It started at 5 am yesterday.
2529,And then of course the online sales too.
2530,There are some one day sales online too.
2531,"Honestly though, the government never had, nor should have, the power to really protect you from COVID."
2532,I wouldn't count on that.
2533,A stimulus package after Biden is sworn in is a very convenient way for the GOP to help add a couple trillion dollars to the national debt in the early days of his presidency and start (re)creating their (not at all) new narrative of reckless federal spending by the democrats.
2534,"Nevermind that it's spending that all should have taken place while trump was still president, since their supporters have the collective memory of a racist goldfish."
2535,I stopped caring about COVID after I got it and nothing happened
2536,Yes of course both are bad but it‚Äôs just the blatant hypocrisy that‚Äôs annoying
2537,"Going by her calculation, and I truly do not know whether or not it's backed up by any scientists at all, doesn't this imply that the anti vaccination crowd in the United States shouldn't be *that* big of a deal in terms of lifting restrictions?"
2538,I think the reopening will solely come down to how fast the vaccine can be distributed considering early reports are suggesting hundreds of millions of doses have been made ready.
2539,"I think that'll be the single biggest test that Biden faces when in office, and it'll likely be in his first month."
2540,What about my statement was wrong my man?
2541,Was it the your instead of you‚Äôre?
2542,Is price spy UK only?
2543,I‚Äôve been looking for a Canadian engine without much luck.
2544,"No, millions of people going out to eat inside had more impact than millions being outside partying."
2545,"When republicans don't believe in equality for their fellow man I can't say I give a shit about their side, honestly."
2546,"If they're immune by disease or vaccine, shame none of that is happening..."
2547,"&gt; There's some specific, arbitrary things that Americans are told to hold dear, like firearms, but I'm suspicious of this due the extent of the propaganda used to sell and encourage these ideas

Firearms (and previously cold weapons) have been a part of our societies for hundreds of years."
2548,"It's not about propaganda, it's about upholding the tradition of being able to protect yourself without waiting for a cop to show up."
2549,It's also about traditional firearms sports and hunting rights.
2550,"There is a problem with crazy people getting their hangs on guns, but this should be solved via background and mental care checks rather than outright bans."
2551,"&gt; It seems incredibly harmful to society - my partner is American, and the mass shooter drills in schools, bullet proof screens etc are just mindblowing to me."
2552,These shooter drills are primarily driven by gun fearing liberals who like to exaggerate the odds of a school shooting happening locally.
2553,"In reality, your child is far more likely to drown in a pool in America than become a victim of a school shooting."
2554,"Gun advocates do not want gun drills to take place, for the most part."
2555,&gt; maybe I am vulnerable to thinking that they don't have it all wrong over in those more socialist/communist countries.
2556,Yes that is the next step: abolishing elections and free speech.
2557,"Since protecting the common good is the number one goal of life, we should put our full trust in the governance of our leadership."
2558,"Victoria did just that for the duration of the pandemic by banning protests, so looks like nothing would stop them from doing the same Australia wide in the future."
2559,"If you tried to ban protests in the US, all the local gun owners would come out and challenge the local police to dare to arrest them, so the local government will never try to pull that off - thus ensuring democracy will keep on being the rule of the land in our country."
2560,"&gt; Quite happy with the middle ground we seem to have found here in Aus - tell me, are you genuinely happy with how your society is structured?"
2561,Do you believe most people are?
2562,"No, I'm not perfectly happy as I believe America has too many regulations in place."
2563,Things like banning kids from playing alone outside or restricting the amount of new construction that can take place.
2564,But I would definitely be a lot less happy if I lived in Melbourne right now.
2565,"No you said who gives a fuck about the cost, i responded the whole world cares about the cost and china is doing it because they made the testkits it is affordable for them."
2566,"People do care about the cost even when their own lives are at stake, when people fall sick, they are concerned about how much it will cost them to get treated."
2567,And you are still saying who gives a fuck.
2568,"&gt; Ffs it‚Äôs not your health at stake, it‚Äôs others health."
2569,If I am sick I will stay at home covid or not.
2570,"If I would be tested positive however, I would have to hand over my previous contacts and they would be forced to enter 10 days quarantine then."
2571,And I bet they wouldnt be exactly thrilled about that.
2572,"If somebody had forced me to spend 10 days homejailed like that, I would have a word or two with him afterwards for sure."
2573,There's already been confirmed transmission of COVID from humans to minks and from minks to humans.
2574,"There is a new strain (cluster 5) that mutated during one of those jumps, and could greatly reduce vaccine progress (keyword could, it could also make no difference)."
2575,"Cluster 5 has infected at least 12 humans, and because the mutation is on the spike protein it is more concerning than other mutations."
2576,"The big concern right now, is either this strain gets widespread and the vaccines currently being developed won't protect against it, or as vaccines are rolled out, other strains from jumps between species will mutate, and those that are resistant to current vaccines will spread."
2577,"Denmark has taken some measures to isolate communities where the mutated strain is present, and is culling their mink to prevent further jumps and mutations."
2578,"Other countries have culled mink herds infected with coronavirus, but not all of them."
2579,"Also, the disease was spreading between mink farms, potentially via seagulls, leading to spread between otherwise unrelated communities (Human in region A&gt;Mink in region A&gt;seagull&gt;mink in region B&gt;human in region B)

Right now we don't know how serious this is."
2580,"We don't know how far it's spread, or if it's spread."
2581,We don't know if the vaccines were developing will protect us.
2582,"The key takeaway is if we allow the disease to continue to spread, it will jump between humans and other animals, and each of those jumps has the potential to create a new strain that will be harder to vaccinate against."
2583,That may have already happened.
2584,"Unless we take more serious measures to contain COVIDS spread, we may be in a pandemic well past when the first round of vaccines are developed."
2585,I feel it‚Äôs about 50/50 looking at the votes.
2586,No reasonable person voted for trump.
2587,"still not gonna wear em outside, you can squash that idea."
2588,Just wait till Thanksgiving and Xmas.

2597,The point is that France didn't even have a rule to break.
2598,There were no restrictions on going into other people's homes at all.
2599,As long as some people are following the rules in the UK that will have reduced social contact relative to France.
2600,"So your argument is conservatives are less compassionate than ""animals"" because animals, while brutal can occasionally be compassionate?"
2601,"One of the weakest arguments I've read on here(that's saying something), but your entitled to your opinion."
2602,Also I feel there is a non zero chance our current president will take this personally and work even less to help Americans.
2603,I expect the next few months he will be solely focused on making things harder for the next administration and spreading false information about voter fraud.
2604,"If this happens, what‚Äôs is the deal with the majority leader position?"
2605,Would it be vacant?
2606,Would it go to the party with the presidency since the vp can break ties?

2621,Where does the 1% number come from?
2622,Why not 0.01% or 0.0001%?
2623,Please hire Fauci when he gets fired and hold a task force press conference every day (not run by Prez or VP) so the citizens hear over and over the social behavior changes we need to turn this around.
2624,"1 in 200 chance of dying after you pass the 1 in 44,000,000 chance of catching it."
2625,Well apparently that was 1 in 44 million chance of catching it over one day.
2626,So 365 chances out of 44 million in one year you will catch something you have a 1 in 200 chance of dying from.
2627,"Sorry, you misunderstand, I meant that we didn't generate a historical turnout out of spite, it would be hard to believe that."

2629,"That is my understanding, yes."
2630,"It has been estimated that each virus have only about 1/1000 chance of entering your cells, so the fewer times you roll that dice, the less likely you will get unlucky."
2631,And generally speaking a smaller dose of the virus should be easily for your body to clear before it can do much damage.
2632,"It is also much harder for any virus on a surface to enter a cell, because the Covid virus can only enter a cell through an ACE2 receptor, and those receptors are most abundant in the lungs, compared to mouth/nose etc, so it would be much harder for the virus to enter a cell if it didn't get breathed into the lungs"

2640,"It will define control of the Senate, which as McConnell has shown for the last few years, is vital for anyone to do anything."
2641,Thanks to our government's failure to even attempt to contain the spread.
2642,Officially Biden has not yet even been elected president.
2643,The electoral college still needs to vote for that to happen.
2644,"But, putting that aside, Biden is the leader of the Democratic Party which controls the House."
2645,"The Senate currently has a Republican majority, but with Trumps loss  it no longer must be beholden to the President‚Äôs desires and can choose to move forward on propositions from Biden."
2646,US Government is a complicated mess and a reason why so many Americans are ignorant enough to go against their own best interests.
2647,"Sept 13 the 7 day moving average of deaths/day in France was 13 

Today is it 471 

Stunning!"
2648,In just over a month and a half.
2649,"Meanwhile the curve for deaths/day is just going up and up, not end in sight

Meanwhile in the US 7 day moving average deaths/day is 946

France's deaths/day extrapolated out to the pop of the US would be 2,305 

So their deaths/day is 2.43 X the rate of the US's"
2650,"‚Äúin line with the flu‚Äù lmfao, find me a recent year where 1.2 million (and counting, two more months to go...) people died of the flu worldwide."

2658,Hes going to squeeze as much money as he can.
2659,Its all about the gift.
2660,Always has been.
2661,"Republicans can safely have two defections if they have a 52:48 lead, and thus keep seats safe for senators in risky areas."
2662,If it's 51:49 they can still have one senator break and use Pence as a tie breaker.
2663,Now that they're down the VP they need 51:49 to obstruct because at an even 50:50 Harris can safely tie break.
2664,"Let's not get confused though: they will always go all 50 against anything the Dems support because they are purely reactionary, with the exception of pork barrel neoliberal spending that can make themselves look good and Biden look bad."
2665,"Biden can get every fart he makes praised by the media but, in reality, won't get much done."
2666,"Even executive actions can and, probably, will be challenged to the SCOTUS which is against ""activism"" currently."
2667,Meaning they are more likely to actually rule on constitutional grounds and less on opinions.
2668,So the win isn't much of a win.
2669,"In fact, overall, his party lost seats this election."
2670,Will they do all that with the second gentleman for the Vice President's home?

2679,We shouldn't let a bunch of crybaby cultists degrade our best chance at finally getting this thing under control.
2680,"Trump's followers didn't pop into existence in 2016, they've always been there, so why didn't we hear from them until 2016?"
2681,Because they're followers.
2682,"They perceive that the world is against them because they never take initiative in the direction of their lives or responsibility for their actions, so they never get anywhere in life and blame it on others."
2683,They need someone to lead them around and Trump gave them that.
2684,"When their leader is gone, they'll go right back to drooling on a bar somewhere while rambling incoherently about the latest conspiracy that they'll forget about tomorrow."
2685,"As far as their cooperation in ending the pandemic, there's no new face that's going to make them miraculously grow up."
2686,We'll have to figure out how to do it despite their selfishness.
2687,Gobble gobble comingüò¢
2688,"Yes there's a lot to do, but many countries in the world do it in days or hours, not months."
2689,"For example in the UK, the main opposition has everyone appointed to a 'shadow' government already, fulfilling all the posts they'd need if they were in power."
2690,"This means that on election day, they can take charge overnight and everyone already knows what they're doing."
2691,"Of course there will be small tweaks, but most of it is smooth."
2692,To me it seems very strange that you let someone with nothing to lose have three entire months left in power.
2693,"The check on exercising power in a democracy is ultimately that you may lose the next election - but if you've already lost, there's nothing to stop bad faith across from doing the worst they can (within the law)."
2694,&gt; It's hard to believe we generated a historical turnout out of spite.
2695,That's why it is relevant.
2696,The historical turnout was for BOTH PARTIES.
2697,Most likely it‚Äôs the reduced viral load from even half measures taken.
2698,Wonder if there‚Äôs a good way of tracking for that avg

2723,Well that 19 billion is paying hundreds of thousands of peoples salaries so.. Fine with me.
2724,"While we shouldn't give up hope and we should try to win it, statistically the numbers work against that from happening."
2725,Both Georgian seats had the sum of republican votes being higher than democrat votes by around 1%.
2726,Republicans typically are stronger on elections when it isn't a major election.
2727,There will also be more salt and anger from the republican party which should drive up their vote turnout.
2728,I'd also argue there are a significant group of people that are pro-republican but anti trump which is why Biden won the presidential but the democrats lost the senate races.
2729,It won't fit over my mouth.
2730,The opposing Senators are some of the people getting exposed through the Trump campaign so maybe the problem won't be a problem by then.

2734,"True, but we may get so many cases by Christmas (or sometime this winter)  that large parts of the country will see a slow down in infections."

2792,Yeah this issue probably cost him the election at the end of the day.
2793,But I think his downfall was more his messaging than anything he really could have done to stop the virus spread here.
2794,There aren‚Äôt a lot of countries (maybe excluding some island nations) who weren‚Äôt hit hard by this despite their best efforts.
2795,Nobody knew what this thing was even back in March when we started locking things down here.

3138,"I like data and numbers, thank you :)"
3139,I had 15 rolls back in March.
3140,"Haven't bought any since, and now have 8.5 rolls."
3141,(and a bidet..)
3142,No he really didn‚Äôt
3143,You should take a look at the Obama years.
3144,You are dead wrong if you think it will do anything but make him worse
3145,You need to understand the problem if you want to solve it.
3146,This helps because it's true.
3147,It wasn't made to piss people off.
3148,"with asymptomatic cases thought to be above 45%,, might already be there"
3149,&gt; What is there to innovate?
3150,"Ok, I will just ignore that - you can't really mean it."
3151,"Those are the famous last words of countless failed businesses, governments, musicians, researchers, etc."
3152,&gt; The American people agreed we don‚Äôt want a rushed vaccine.
3153,They didn't want an overly-rushed or unsafe vaccine.
3154,"There were (and are) thousands of Americans who would have volunteered for testing that would have higher risk than the norm, that would have sped up the process."
3155,They would have been rewarded with the knowledge that they helped to save thousands of lives.
3156,"The medical establishment said ""no thanks""."
3157,"Someday there will be a worse pandemic, one that kills 100,000 a day rather than just a few 1000."
3158,Maybe then they will think about it.
3159,Huh?
3160,That‚Äôs literally what he has done for years.
3161,He doesn‚Äôt care that it goes on record- he‚Äôs literally sitting on hundreds of bills
3162,He'll try out of spite before he takes off for a undisclosed location in an nation without an extradition treaty with the US...He's that petty and holds grudges forever...
3163,"He advocated for complete lockdowns, so no supply chains, distribution centers, etc."
3164,"Yes, some people would starve."
3165,Close your borders please.
3166,"If not, I hope you guys are ready for taking responsibility for letting it leak to the world."
3167,"This is called ""projection""."
3168,"I don't think there's a serious number of people who think it's a hoax, as in, the virus doesn't exist."
3169,"I see a lot of people who think this response isn't justified, however."
3170,I'm one of them.
3171,ya man this ran thru my head all day... its incomprehensible to me.
3172,"what a slap in the face to resteraunt owners, small bussiness owners, anyones job that was effected over this."
3173,all hypocripcsy its awful the country didnt magically change b/c someone is taking a new job.
3174,absloute bs couldnt agree more we cannot just ignore this have some freaking consistency
3175,My clue is pointing this way
3176,"Wait, what was Cluster-4?"
3177,We're so screwed
3178,"maybe romney we know hes at least been opposing trump for a while, but he still does vote in party lines."
3179,"The world is doing it again, lol human nature never changes"
3180,So long superspreaders.
3181,Yes but if I recall correctly there have been no outbreaks attributable to schools since they reopened
3182,I was not wearing a seatbelt.
3183,My wife was and the car hit on her side of the vehicle.
3184,It cut the seatbelt
3185,This is terrifying.
3186,"It‚Äôs Mitch McConnell- he will do the same thing he did to Obama and refuse to allow any bill to go through, refuse to allow Biden‚Äôs cabinet member picks, refuse to do anything at all."
3187,For sure.
3188,But they are bought into the politicization of it.
3189,Wait what?
3190,Don't we need to end the election first?
3191,[The data says they're a major factor in spread.
3192,"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/coronavirus-r-rate-school-closures-lockdown-lancet-study-b1251617.html)We are trusting literal children to adhere to strict rules and not spread the virus, not a very good way to keep cases down."
3193,Are you under the impression that most Americans can afford to shop around for insurance or something?
3194,They get it through work
3195,[removed]
3196,and outdoors.
3197,There's a reason BLM didn't cause a spike in cases.
3198,"mitch and lindsey being re-elected makes me doubt the other senators will compromise, if people as vile as these 2 are voted back in the senate, its not likely it will happen."
3199,Also trump crystalized even more republicans to vote only gop.
3200,It's like nature is trying to send a message or something
3201,I mean.. he‚Äôs not downplaying it and pretending it doesn‚Äôt exist which is already like a 100x improvement.
3202,I wonder what the administration can really do at that point.
3203,Is another lockdown even an option?
3204,"Here in NYC, land of trump haters nobody is really social distancing at all."
3205,And whomever proposes another lockdown will be the most unpopular person ever.
3206,We can only hope for a vaccine...
3207,I've also been seeing masks not worn properly or at all (at times) and a total lack of distancing.
3208,Does it look like a Trump rally?
3209,"No, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that a lot of the celebrations are being done without risk."
3210,And this time it can't even be under the guise that it's for the sake of a larger cause like what was argued during the BLM protests.
3211,Stupid ass AD and Governor who would allow fans at the game when Indiana's numbers are skyrocketing
3212,Maryland beat Penn state though üê¢
3213,1 in 29 Texans has had a confirmed case of Coronavirus.
3214,I'm in Melbourne too and while it's great that we've got it to such a low level what we did here is not necessarily transferable to other countries or cities.
3215,"We were under restrictions of one kind or another for 3 months and fairly tight restrictions for 8 weeks or so, we could do this because the rest of the country had practically eliminated the virus, state and international borders are closed and our Federal government provided income and business support."
3216,"The virus is now endemic in most of Europe and the United States, to do what we did here in those places would require national lockdowns of a similar duration to our local one and border closures and that's just not feasible."
3217,"So while I'm very happy with how it went here and how our state handled the process I don't agree that it's automatically doable elsewhere, and I think that rather than look at a pie in the sky solution those countries would be better off trying to limit the damage as far as possible with mandatory masks, limits on crowd numbers and such, because there just won't be lockdowns stringent and long enough to actually get the virus under control."
3218,This is exactly the problem.
3219,"I keep hearing ""I'm not scared,"" and they aren't getting the message because they do not care about getting others sick."
3220,"I saw that it was just crazy, people just don‚Äôt care"
3221,The scariest thing we keep learning about Covid is that nobody seems to have it until everyone has it.
3222,we already lost some house seats to republicans.
3223,I mean you do understand this is why covid19 is ravaging the entire US now right?
3224,That this is why the US is still on its 1st wave while other countries have had multiple waves and recovered from each and every one of them?
3225,"Well, on the surface he restricted travel to/ from China, which was a good start, although Pelosi and the other lib morons called him a xenophobe for it."
3226,All the while - Cuomo kept the NY subway system open so that the virus could spread uncontrollably
3227,LOL
3228,Possibly.
3229,Who knows.
3230,Guess we will find out eventually lol.
3231,"Thank you, truly appreciated."
3232,People can be nice and still cause immense harm.
3233,"Yes, after the millionth article on this sub saying the same damn things we knew three months ago, you stop looking past a a certain point."
3234,Is it that high already.
3235,Last I looked it was around 100k a day.
3236,Between 1-2% of these people will die.
3237,That's 1000 - 2000 people.
3238,Every day.
3239,Don't you mean herd mentality?
3240,Should it be safe to assume fauci will be on it.
3241,"trump probably have some damaging info on some of the senators like mitch, who donated 500k to trumps legal team."
3242,Right because risking death is totally worth it if you get to keep your vacation days.
3243,This country is going to see a death toll like no other due to this incredible selfishness and complete and utter disregard for the lives of others.
3244,Gimme!
3245,"Funny, the same flu strain circulated in 2009 and I don't remember a 2% IFR with modern medicine."
3246,He is very good at that professional head shake.
3247,it means dems need both in order to tie them.
3248,a couple people were posting donation links to the 2 dem sensators of these election hopefully people can contribute if they can.
3249,Americans need him more now than ever.
3250,He should get a well deserved vacation after the Pandemic
3251,Agreed.
3252,It's an identity politics issue
3253,Why do you feel the need to throw around strong accusations.
3254,I read the title and figured that‚Äôs all I needed to see.
3255,The withdrawal information required more scrolling to see.
3256,Why do you feel the need to post poorly formatted articles?
3257,"Wait, why is there a task force for something Trump said would disappear November 4?"
3258,Did dear leader lie?
3259,I don't care.
3260,Really I don't fucking care.
3261,None of that justifies knowingly spreading this virus.
3262,Leadership plays an important role.
3263,To say that it doesn't have any effect (which is what you're inferring) is dumb as fuck.
3264,To be fair there's the possibility that the situation would be even worse without a mask mandate.
3265,It's not much colder but you guys are at a much higher latitude.
3266,I feel like that has an effect even though I don't know why.
3267,At least we didn't fight with rakes.
3268,As an Oregon fan the first thing I noticed when I switched over after my hand ended was that Notre Dame had lots of people in the stands.
3269,Oregon had none.
3270,Used cardboard cutouts.
3271,You didn't read beyond the headline did you?
3272,Although I don't blame you; the headline is misleading and it's tempting to skim academic reports.
3273,&gt;The authors have **withdrawn this manuscript** because there are **increased  rates of SARS- CoV-2 cases in the areas that we originally analyzed in  this study**.
3274,"New analyses in the context of the third surge in the United  States are therefore needed and will be undertaken directly in  conjunction with the creators of the publicly-available databases on  cases, hospitalizations, testing rates."
3275,Etc.
3276,We will be performing this  in conjunction with machine learning experts at UCSF.
3277,"Therefore, the  authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project."
3278,We hope to have an updated analysis using data from the 2nd and now 3rd wave of SARS-CoV-2 in this country soon.
3279,"If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author."
3280,"Also, 

&gt;This  article is a preprint and has **not been certified by peer review**."
3281,It reports new medical research that has yet to be  evaluated and so should *not* be used to guide clinical practice.
3282,Reevaluated for what?
3283,Most people with covid19 are infectious for 2 weeks.
3284,It wasn't decided arbitrarily.
3285,Reducing the length of quarantine makes quarantining entirely pointless.
3286,"I said it before and I will say it again, knowingly exposing others to a deadly virus needs to result in jail time."
3287,Hope it gets better for them.
3288,Sucks that anyone has to say bye to a loved one due to this terrible virus.
3289,[removed]
3290, My better senses tell me not to pin too much hope Biden can solve the Covid problem.
3291,"Yes, he'll be a refreshing change, and we'll finally have science believers and experts back in government."
3292,"BUT....most of what needs to be done - mask mandates, lock downs (if necessary), actually come from STATE governments, not the federal government."
3293,"Just as Trump couldn't force states to reopen in May, neither can Biden do anything if R.ed States pursue the herd immunity strategy."
3294,"The US doesn't even have the most important tool in Covid containment, which is to halt all travel from hotspots!"
3295,"In Australia, they did shut down Victoria and prevented anyone from crossing borders into other states."
3296,The US can't even do this!
3297,Even states like NY which had quarantine requirements on out-of-staters were mostly an honors system with negligible (read: zero) actual enforcement.

3311,"&gt;In a statement released with Saturday's numbers, *the department noted that while some of the case numbers come from a backlog ‚Äî caused by the state's transition in its case reporting system ‚Äî the enormous new case number is also due to ""significant community spread."

3562,"the issue here is the ""Availability depends on your political stance""."
3563,do you really think those millions will listen to anybody else?
3564,It‚Äôs entitlement to not want to suffer financial ruin and fall behind on bills?
3565,For most people 14 days of quarantine translates to fourteen days of no pay.
3566,Are they still healthy?
3567,But if you wanted to wait I'd say 10 - 14 days would be the recommended range
3568,"Lindstrom sounds like a movie character, pushing something hastily cobbled together to the main character, saying ""Trust me, it'll work"""
3569,I wonder what the new cases per number of tests taken looks like in comparison to other months

3584,Who‚Äôs you people?
3585,I‚Äôve been following Covid since December.
3586,I self isolated in early March and didn‚Äôt go back to work voluntarily till June.
3587,"Just because I don‚Äôt buy in to hype and fear at the first instance of seeing some shock headline, that‚Äôs designed to do JUST THAT, doesn‚Äôt make me some trump loving Q anon dipshit."
3588,Philadelphia County is to blame
3589,Because they don‚Äôt have the money to quarantine for fourteen days?
3590,In many cases positive test = two weeks no pay.
3591,I get people are excited but my moderate relief as a progressive is really being overshadowed by my horror at the lack of distancing.
3592,I'd be pissed if I was a healthcare worker.
3593,No u
3594,But that's just it.
3595,You don't have facts.
3596,You're just trying to fillibuster your way to making people believe there that the mutant strain did not escape.
3597,"You are spreading disinformation, because you do not know that to be a fact."
3598,You have no way of knowing.
3599,So you should stop doing that.
3600,Thank you.
3601,Well the average income of people who died of covid who were too young for social security is over 100 grand.
3602,How do u think rich people would fight off a virus with no cure better than poor people?
3603,I believe what you're talking about is referred to as the swiss cheese model - https://www.opus-group.com/News/Creative-Interior-Design-During-and-Post-COVID-19
3604,they just need to dig a bigger hole to bury the dead.
3605,"the poor &amp; weak are more exposed to the virus, because they have to work and live in poorer conditions, probably too poor to change a fresh mask on daily basis, so this will actually reduce government's financial load by taking out the lower income group."
3606,"by not spending too much on testing, this actually helps."
3607,"Well unless it's Australia or countries where they have literally free or $1 healthcare system, something USA lacks."
3608,You see why they just don't want health care proposal approved.

3614,"As for the Pfizer vaccine, the CEO shifted their timeline last month."
3615,Their plan is to apply for an EUA in late November.
3616,"I don‚Äôt know how long the approval process would be, but according the article below, an EUA is rare for a vaccine because you are dosing healthy people with it and it seems a vaccine would have to have pretty stellar safety and efficacy results to get approval."

3621,What?
3622,"Covid is easily controlled with competent leadership and once biden takes over the lives lost, while unfortunate, will be better than the widespread mistreatment of POC &amp; LBHTQ in the long run so they died for a good cause and ultimately china helped us get rid of a dictator"

3631,"Pfft, Donald, what an idiot."
3632,"What I will describe is terrible and I wish it was avoided:

Election day is pretty much going to infect a large portion of Americans of a particular political bent, and only them."
3633,In person voters of the other political bent took precautions.
3634,"Statistically, you put all of the people most likely to spread covid in contact with each other, all in one area, all in one night, and these people all have multiple overlapping social circles in common with each other.Within one or two hops, an entire political spectrum in America may become sick all at once."
3635,"It would be the grandest, most terrible irony of fate of the Trump era, that his followers decided to follow him out the door, Jim Jones style."
3636,I wish all of this could have been avoided.
3637,The same will similarly hold true to a lesser extent for the people partying now.
3638,He was appointed chairman in 2017 by trump.
3639,K.
3640,Oh thank God!
3641,We should mandate duct taping masks to your battle buddy's face.
3642,Also a national snitch line so we can tar and feather those who disagree.
3643,Mandate testing and tracing to 100% of the population if you don't come in for your testing you don't get your new universal basic income.

3645,"Man, I'd love if Facebook/Twitter actually did this."
3646,"Like if posts had a ""proven fact"" detector or something like that."
3647,Usa accounts for ~20% of the covid deaths in the world despite making up only ~5% of the population
3648,Shut the fuck up with this both sides bullshit.
3649,One side is purposely making policy decisions that they know for a fact will cause death or suffering for political gain and the other side is making mistakes that they actually own up to and correct.
3650,"Just call me Greenland, cause I ain‚Äôt leaving my house."
3651,A lot of people just don't care.
3652,"Even though we are linked by the decisions of others, it's been every person for themselves in the US for a while in regards to COVID for a while now."
3653,"Not saying that's right, but that's the situation the govt and people have let it devolve into to."

3663,"However, what Biden does now will have tremendous influence on people who are currently in position to affect policy."
3664,How does everyone feel about losing their jobs again and being locked in the house for another 3 months?
3665,"everyone has the right to their own opinion, my opinion is such efficient and near perfect virus can't be evolve in nature environment so quickly."
3666,It's like the virus has studied for the best means to infect humans.
3667,Even the bird flu couldn't be so effective after decades (or even centuries) of mutation and bam we have Corona virus the perfect virus.
3668,I'm not going to dive deeper since it will be tagged as political post.
3669,Abbott is choosing party over his own voters.
3670,That is literally murder.
3671,"Yes, it‚Äôs the standard PCR test kit."
3672,"We have rapid test labs at the ports of entry, so we are able to produce results for all those entering the country within 2 hours."
3673,"Meanwhile, they are quarantined for 2 weeks, usually in a government-rented hotel."
3674,Then they are tested again after the 2 weeks and allowed to travel around freely after that.
3675,Poor baby.
3676,Just turn off the TV.
3677,This thread is about Texas not NY.

3685,That‚Äôs the mentality
3686,What happens if a lockdown doesn‚Äôt occur til joe takes office?
3687,No one gives a god damn fuck about that.
3688,People are talking about what is happening RIGHT NOW.
3689,She‚Äôs also against the legal weed they just passed.
3690,Talk about a GOP dinosaur
3691,There are mass parties in the streets for Biden's victory.
3692,"I'm old enough to remember the commercials in NYC saying 'stay home, stay inside'."
3693,This thing is out of the news by April/May.
3694,"I feel like there‚Äôs a contextual element missing, I don‚Äôt really follow what you said."
3695,Make America Safe Again
3696,Even the death rate?
3697,[removed]
3698,I think this is why they get so confused about it.
3699,"The look at it from an individualistic, personal perspective instead of a community issue."
3700,"The conversation is different when you're saying, ""I don't want to give it to someone,"" rather than, ""I don't care if I get it."""

3704,How are people still this stupid?
3705,Outdoors and masks.
3706,"That's the main thing, masks and being outdoors."
3707,Just like most protesters were and all these celebrations are.
3708,This justifies Abbot's terrible pandemic response how exactly?
3709,"Cuomo made a mistake, admitted it, corrected it and moved on."
3710,Just a quick copy paste from wiki.
3711,"But according to teachers, if it's wikipedia it's 100% BS, sooo, who knows if it's true."
3712,so such instant test kit actually exist?
3713,He'll push a lockdown from Jan-April.
3714,Then the placebo vaccine will arrive.
3715,Then we'll hear no more about it.
3716,Thanks
3717,This is based on what exactly?
3718,Sorry but the election is major news and has huge ramifications in terms of a pandemic response both in the US and internationally.
3719,Watching the celebrations in the streets after Biden was declared the victor was insane.
3720,I was under the impression that the left in general were following social distancing guide lines.
3721,It scares me that the side of politics in America who believe the threat of corona virus is real also dont follow the rules.
3722,In Australia today we had no community transmission.
3723,We had a tough fight to get where we are but I feel it was worth it.
3724,Hopefully new administration can make some in roads into this.
3725,January cannot come soon enough
3726,It'll be a pleasant change to have both parties acknowledge that the pandemic is a problem.
3727,McConnell just got re-elected for 6 years.
3728,"Nobody is KY is going to remember this in 6 days, never mind 6 years."
3729,This talking point has to be the dumbest one yet.
3730,infections will increase or a lockdown is introduced.
3731,"just 2 options really, possibly even more than one lockdown within next 6 months."
3732,I see you don't understand centrism too.
3733,"Why don't you try to tell me what you think centrism is, and then how it allows the behavior of only one side to be bad?"
3734,"Yes please, fuck that guy."

3745,"Believe me, I remember Italy and how important it was to Flatten the Curve to keep hospital from being overrun."
3746,But I (maybe incorrectly) didn‚Äôt think we were close to that point again in the vast majority of cities anymore.
3747,Let‚Äôs goooo
3748,So conservative political talking points are untrue because they are conservative talking points and not liberal talking points?
3749,Exactly.
3750,It‚Äôs been mutating constantly since December.
3751,In January the tracker website was listing 60+ mutations.
3752,By now there must be thousands of them and they used the initial variants to track Spread origin when it first spread to Europe and the US.
3753,There was speculation that a particular strain was more infectious than others and that might have been why it spread so quickly in Wuhan vs elsewhere in China.
3754,But so far as I‚Äôve heard it was all a nothing burger.
3755,The mutations were basically insignificant.
3756,And most of the time when these things mutate it gets less effective as a virus not more dangerous.
3757,"So yeah, there‚Äôs probably no need for concern."
3758,"College student here, never got jack shit."
3759,Jesus fucking Christ.
3760,My country has 25 million people and never had a single day with more deaths than that.
3761,"They have such a demographic advantage too with a low and spread out population, we never saw anything remotely close in our rural areas."

3769,Pretty muxh what every administration does
3770,I'll take that bet.
3771,How much?
3772,Oh are we back to picking arbitrary metrics to downplay the pandemic again?
3773,Just give it a fucking rest already.
3774,This bullshit just isn't going to fly anymore.
3775,You‚Äôre missing that our hospitals cannot handle the influx of patients.
3776,"Not only because of bed availability, but because that availability also depends on hospitals being staffed."
3777,"On communities where spread is rampant, healthcare systems are reporting large numbers of sick employees."
3778,For example Mayo‚Äôs hospital systems in Western Wisconsin had over 200 employees out last week.

3781,Jesus christ you people never stop do you?
3782,No one gives a fuck about China.
3783,China is not responsible for how the rest of the world dealt with this virus.
3784,"About time, I hope the US can turn around."
3785,It really has.
3786,"Pretty damned sad, especially when there is an avoid-politics rule."
3787,I'm confident his cabinet will pick up the slack.
3788,they need to stop looking at it as primarily a respiratory disease and more like a blood disease.
3789,of course just having a mask mandate will automatically plummet the case numbers.
3790,"but of those who do catch it, it's more about surviving the initial infections across the body and across multiple organs before a critical organ fails."
3791,Are you saying we can disband the Flask Force now?
3792,And Texas still has about a third of the deaths because Cuomo sent patients back to nursing homes
3793,Everyone is out celebrating right now also.
3794,"Um, no."
3795,It has nothing to do with conservatism.
3796,It has to do with being an anti-mask evangelical.
3797,How did you miss that part?
3798,There is evidence that covid19 originated elsewhere and a few cases outside of China have been found that happened prior to when China first discovered the virus.
3799,I was in Time Square.
3800,"It was crowded, but most people had masks and of course it‚Äôs outdoors."
3801,But it‚Äôs pretty obvious it wasn‚Äôt the best environment in terms of risk minimization.
3802,Most people were young tho.
3803,People act like the president has total control over COVID.
3804,Politicians in Europe are much more authoritarian than Biden and still failed to contain COVID.
3805,So mass gatherings are fine as long as 80% of people have masks?
3806,In that case we should open everything up.
3807,If you disagree you‚Äôre a hypocrite and only support mass gatherings you politically approve of.
3808,I alone probably accounted half of the levels.
3809,If you live in Georgia - *please* don't forget to vote for Ossoff and Warnock.
3810,With those two we can wrangle a 50/50 Senate.
3811,Not all conservatives are this apathetic
3812,"I'm pretty sure there are already mutated strands of coronavirus:  
[https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)"
3813,"Unless you‚Äôre a lockdown truther who shouts New Zealand, you get negative karma here"
3814,There's also the chance to flip the Senate in GA with the runoff elections
3815,Shucks howdy!
3816,What you are saying just isn't factual.
3817,Look overseas.
3818,Are the people in britian and Spain and italy protesting over lockdowns and mask rules all mag a supporters?
3819,How about all the college students spreading it?
3820,How about all the rappers playing packed clubs night after night and posting it on IG?
3821,"These the ""only group of people that are maskless hoaxers""?"
3822,Those groups are all conservative mag a supporters?
3823,It's not a bipartisan screw-up when McConnell can kill any bill at the drop of a hat and both parties know it.
3824,"If we are at 50/50, Chuck Schumer would"
3825,Unbelievable.
3826,My mother asks me where would be an appropriate place for the trump presidential library.
3827,"Rather than have the best prison library in America (my previous choice), I now think his library should be a mausoleum surrounded by a cemetery to bury the deaths he caused from Covid."
3828,I am pleased to see this reference was appropriately upvoted!
3829,The clap is the virus for 2021.
3830,Yeah.
3831,Reddit is like that.
3832,"When I'm feeling irritable, I close reddit for a week or two."
3833,The stock market is a direct reflection of the economy.

3843,Both House and Senate had bills and played politics
3844,"I believe you're firmly in 'Making shit up"" territory."
3845,Sadly basically nothing.
3846,No major legislation will pass.
3847,The executive has a lot of power besides that though
3848,I... Um... No.
3849,I have wanted to punch people for trying to appeal to the anti-mask crowd in the US by talking about saving other people‚Äôs lives.
3850,People have not been paying attention.
3851,"If you want to motivate them, you need to put it in terms of what they value."
3852,Tell them that wearing masks will help keep the economy running.
3853,Wearing masks will help their business or employment.

3869,"Ouch, yeah I heard a lot of people never got the first one, perhaps if Biden does another it‚Äôll be handled better and everyone will actually receive the money instead of some cunt massive businesses"
3870,What is especially egregious is that the pandemic response team was responsible for coordinating international surveillance of viruses so if Trump hadn't gotten rid of them there is every chance we would have detected covid19 earlier and stopped it before it had a chance to get started.
3871,People don't realize how many viruses have been stopped this way over the past few years.
3872,These numbers are getting pretty wild.
3873,Scary stuff.
3874,&gt;What does a high test positivity rate have to do with population size?
3875,"&gt;It means there are lots of people

Yes I am absolutely having trouble processing your logic lol

3898,"For once, he'll listen to scientists instead of calling them idiots and making absurd, false statements that defy science (injecting disinfectants), in order to flatline corona."
3899,Bullshit.
3900,"The US MD/DO, for profit DO, and Caribbean for profit MD schools more than capture the talent capable of completing medical school."
3901,Hence why the for profits have such low grad and match rates.
3902,And still with this capture of talent we still don‚Äôt fill our Primary Care Residency slots.
3903,Because there simply are not enough people able to complete medical training and be competent providers.
3904,"Primary care pays peanuts, if there was some sort of cartel then primary care would pay well, but it doesn‚Äôt."
3905,You pay your plumber more per hour than a primary care physician makes per hour.
3906,"For many, read: idiots"
3907,"Mink fur as a lining, definitely can do without it."
3908,Leather though as a useful material.
3909,"Sorry friend, but no can do."
3910,"I've got an old leather coat of sheep skin I want to get repaired or properly replaced because with just a simple layer of a shirt, sweater/hoodie and that coat, it was able to keep me warm in down to -45c temperatures with ease."
3911,Just a simple sheep leather long coat.
3912,-25c with just a t shirt underneath.
3913,"What matters here is that it acts as a good wind break, while keeping the heat in for the most part."
3914,Increasing the insulation capacity with extra layers helped obviously.
3915,"Fur lining DOES help with this same thing, which does give some validity to some fur lined coats in certain areas of the world."
3916,Why?
3917,"Because like it or not, they perform BETTER when made properly."
3918,"Synthetic materials perform admirably, and in some cases better than them as well, but not in all ways that matter."
3919,For instance wind breaker jackets with a water resistant fabric.
3920,"Good at keeping some heat in like the leather jacket method I mention, and at shedding some water, while keeping the wind from piercing through."
3921,"But the difference is thermal load and heat transference, among other things minor but still important to some people."
3922,Stuff like the sound the clothing makes.
3923,(Que noise of swishing pants and jackets of polymer materials.)
3924,"Depending on the use of the clothing, the person might want completely different properties than what some synthetic materials make available."
3925,Leather kind of has this all in this perfect little trifecta.
3926,"It still has a lot of room for improvement in some ways, but has the basics down well enough that it makes for a great all around material for certain tasks."
3927,Jackets being a main one with immediate understandable feedback.
3928,"A well made leather jacket will have made the jacket mostly water proof on the outside, with a thin layer of insulation on the inside to allow for ample room for a thick shirt."
3929,"It will be somewhat tight to the body, but flexible enough and supple enough to stretch and twist as needed."
3930,The end result is a jacket that fits you like glove you never want to take off.
3931,How often can you say that of any other piece of clothing?
3932,"I have found a few, but it usually takes some really specialized combinations of synthetic materials, and at that point we reach a new conundrum."
3933,The pollution factor of those materials vs the pollution factor of leather.
3934,Which one tweaks your moral compass in a bad way more?
3935,Kinda complicated.
3936,Basically you have to read about what power the executive branch has.
3937,I didn‚Äôt imply any amount of people were anything.
3938,There is only one group of people that are maskless hoaxers though.
3939,There really is no getting around that.
3940,That doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre the only ones that are getting sick.
3941,I‚Äôm sure they bring their irresponsibility with them everywhere they go spreading it to this person and that.
3942,"They may not be disproportionately sick, but I‚Äôd bet a lot of money they are disproportionately spreading it."
3943,[removed]
3944,Not only did the US fail to contain it within its own borders the US also contributed to global spread of the virus.
3945,This is the entire reason why most countries closed their borders to us.
3946,I hope it stays that way.
3947,I could see her as a GOP VP nominee or even the GOP presidential nominee one day
3948,That‚Äôs the pattern every Democrat president has faced in 30 years.
3949,The 1000/day club used to be exclusive but now they're just letting anyone in.
3950,So basically a vigilante.
3951,"They had us in the first half, not gonna lie."
3952,This may be the world's best experiment on how having polar opposites on Covid19 response impacts the results.
3953,Don‚Äôt.
3954,Things are good and our economy is in way better shape than Canada.
3955,Probably just gonna hire the guys Obama and himself handpicked and left for trump.
3956,Like its not rocket science.
3957,Just listen to people who know what the hell they're talking about.
3958,"Don't reach out to a pillow manufacturer, don't award multi million contracts over Twitter."
3959,Like basic stuff guys
3960,It‚Äôs so funny from a centrist POV.
3961,"Each side just ruthlessly bashes the other, and nobody seems to be able to learn anything"
3962,Most epidemiologists have been saying for years that zoonotic transmission is going to be the origin of most new viruses.
3963,In fact most of the major viruses the past 20 years happened through zoonotic transmission which is why surveillance is so essential in fighting these viruses before they become an epidemic.
3964,So many had placed their bets on the coronavirus disappearing after the election.
3965,Believe Trump himself said it a few times.
3966,Based on science
3967,One of the problems imho of congress is really how much power they‚Äôve delegates to the executive branch.
3968,"In this case it‚Äôs good that Biden can pull back many of trumps policies thru direct executive order, but in general Trump shouldn‚Äôt have been able to go as far as he did without significant direct pushback from congress."
3969,Freedom is more important than safety or security.
3970,"And I‚Äôm not only talking about my freedoms, but everyone‚Äôs freedoms in this country."
3971,And what more am I supposed to do?
3972,"I wear a mask in public and if I got COVID, I‚Äôd quarantine for 14 days/until I‚Äôm COVID free."
3973,"There‚Äôs nothing more to do and if he says there was, I‚Äôd call bullshit if it infringes on my rights and civil liberties."
3974,But I‚Äôm not going to allow Biden to take my civil liberties in the name of ‚Äúsafety‚Äù though.
3975,Absolutely.
3976,Sugar is an addictive drug.
3977,Interestingly it came on the scene about the same time as distilled liquor and caffeinated beverages.
3978,What are the chances of getting covid back to back?
3979,I have bad anxiety so keep that in mind if this is a dumb question.
3980,"Back story:

I tested positive from covid over a week ago."
3981,"I live in 2 places, the health department made me stay at the house I was infected at."
3982,Here i have 2 roomates.
3983,"I only have a couch in the living room that I stay on, I only stay here on the weekends to see my son."
3984,The 1st roomate got me sick.
3985,The 2nd one tested negative the first time he tested and then 3 days ago he tested positive.
3986,Im pretty much recovered and have 3 days left of quarantine.
3987,2nd room mate comes out and spends all day in living room on his computer and refuses to stay away.
3988,I have no where else to go in the house.
3989,Its very small.
3990,He probably got infected from me or other roomate so should be the same strain.
3991,Do I have anything to worry about?
3992,Is it possible to get sick right away after recovering?
3993,The first time wasnt bad but I am a bit overweight and the anxiety the first time was bad enough.
3994,Sorry for the Novel over probably my brain over thinking things.

4094,"As per statistics released on Friday, the % of people who tested positively through PCR tests has fallen below the national average in those 4 counties after two rounds of Ag testing."
4095,When you look at the curve of cases in Slovakia which in official statistics includes only people tested with far more reliable PCR tests the curve was climbing steeply until some other precautions where put into place a few weeks before the testing and now after the first week of testing it looks like we might actually succeed in flattening the curve (which was the intent behind the mass testing).

4114,"It's a start, though, right?"
4115,I poked my head into a restaurant yesterday to see if it was worth getting lunch from them.
4116,There were unmasked customers in line.
4117,The _owner_ was making food without a mask on.
4118,Other employees had masks over their mouths but not their noses.
4119,I noped out of there and drove home for lunch instead (and also filed a report with the state department of health.)
4120,"Anything outdoors is automatically much lower risk,  ""The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment"" https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v2 If you were just passing through, chances are you were only next to any given infectuous person for a few seconds at a time, so even if you passed by a fair number of them (the number of people in NYC currently infectious should be significantly below national average based on their positive rates), the overall cumulative dose should be low."
4121,"That being said, low risk does not mean zero risk, it can take 2 days for people to go from exposed to starting to become infectious, I don't think your risk profile is high enough to require self isolation, but I would recommend cutting back on the duration of indoor conversations (currently believed to be the most risky thing we can do for transmission, apart from singing, https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html?ssm=TW_CC) with your high risk family members, and if you become symptomatic isolate immediately."

4173,Masks are fashionable where I live in California.
4174,Mostly due to the resistance that people had towards H1n1 in 2009.
4175,A theory as to why the most likely dead from Spanish flu were 20-45 year olds.
4176,"Older generations had a limited immunity due to past exposures of h1n1 strains, whereas the 20-45 year olds really only encountered h3n3 (don't quote me on the specific strain.)"
4177,Since the end of Spanish flu it became part of the seasonal flus.
4178,If you've had a flu there's a high chance you've had the ancestor of Spanish flu..
4179,Real plateau or test capacity plateau?
4180,Are you asking if covid has mutated among humans?
4181,The answer is yes.
4182,There are several versions of Covid (I've seen debates about whether or not strain is the correct word to use so I won't use it here) the one that gets the most attention is referred to commonly as the European strain which seems to be even more transmissible than the original version.
4183,"There doesn't seem to be any reduction in effects, so it is just as dangerous but also spreads faster."
4184,But can you test them?
4185,"Yesterday I read, that positive rates in Iowa were 40%+"
4186,So this is another one of those articles with clickbait names and they haven't actually identified patient zero?
4187,I won't deny that masks are not a golden goose for preventing the spread of any viral disease but there has been numerous studies done regarding their ability to curb spread specifically with asymptomatic people and large droplets which is now seen as the primary way covid is spread.
4188,There is a reason that doctors and surgeons wear masks even before covid in order to do procedures.
4189,"Also, look into Bloombergs article a few months ago regarding a chain of starbucks in New York City where the only employees who did not catch covid were those who wore masks the entire time until leaving the workplace."

4235,"Interestingly, covid19 hits fat people and darker-skinned people harder, both in terms of infection and in terms of effects."

4237,There have now been several cases of people becoming reinfected.
4238,"Right now it looks rare, however, it is also under studied and the criteria needed to meet that standard is incredibly high so we cannot yet know the real rate of reinfection."
4239,It's about money.
4240,"Without support from the Federal government, states are running out of money to pay unemployment benefits."
4241,People need to work to eat and pay rent.
4242,&gt; Because if you get a false positive you and your family and contacts have to quarantine for 2 weeks.
4243,Not worth the risk.
4244,"In Victoria the false positive rate has been given as around 1 in 10,000 tests, we've had it happen a few times lately so they've been running multiple tests to confirm a positive result."
4245,Sadly that only really works when the rate of infection is low and you can afford the extra testing to confirm cases.
4246,Really hard to believe these stats.
4247,Must be another one of the countries trying to reopen for Christmas.
4248,"I think you can, if both caught it and tested and showing symptoms around the same time, isolate together for the recommended 10 days from showing symptoms or testing positive, but to be safe lot of people just go the full 14 to be safe."
4249,I am in a similar position where me and my partner tested negative but a roommates came back positive.
4250,All we share is a bathroom but that‚Äôs a pretty intimate/small space to share whilst one of 3 has an airborne virus (also my partner is asthmatic) but there is no other bathroom so we just have hella Lysol and antibacterial wipes.

4258,Texas is very much a hands-off type of government.
4259,People don't like being told what to do and they elected officials that will comply with that.
4260,Combine that with half the population thinking Covid is a hoax or at most a slightly worse flu (thanks to our glorious leader /s) and you have our situation.

4272,who can manage to make a 40 oz slurpee cup not fall off their bellies as they play Xbox
4273,This is dumb as fuck lol
4274,Certain conditions increase the rate of transmission and as a result some gatherings increase spread more than others.
4275,"For outdoor events:

People outside without masks = less safe

People outside with masks = more safe

People outside with masks and 6 feet apart = safest option"
4276,Trump has been too busy downplaying a hoax and it‚Äôs going to be that much difficult to fix it
4277,Probably by withholding funding to states that do not comply.
4278,Wrong.
4279,France and Belgium both have mask mandates.
4280,Social distancing is more important than wearing masks.
4281,You're right (and I don't consider myself 'liberal').
4282,I think we've been primed with a ton of stereotypes to react to each other in ways that perpetuate the schism.
4283,We *all* need to wake up and hold the puppetmasters to account.
4284,The death rate is artificially low right now because our hospitals aren't over capacity
4285,Australia has in my opinion a good model.
4286,I dont want to have a chines model.
4287,Except their different culture they are also forced to obey.
4288,While i wish more people would follow the rules and the punishments would be harsher im still happy not to live in an authoritarian system.
4289,They track all of their citizens and there is literally 0 privacy and data protection.
4290,Hence they can effectivly track covid patients and control the spread but i like my government not to know where i am at every single moment.
4291,I dont want to be a vitreous person.
4292,Not our best and brightest.
4293,Hopefully they recover before going to prison so as not to infect the other inmates.

4295,"If the reports of reinfection are true we might never reach herd immunity, but we would still have an obscene and tragic death toll."
4296,Only real hope is practicing good social distancing and a vaccine.
4297,"Holy crap, OP clearly did not."
4298,Multiple of the studies he posted actually claim a measure of protection from masks.
4299,Other studies are actually only determining the protective value of N95 vs medical masks.
4300,"In other words, the whole study starts with the assumption that they both provide protection."
4301,One study specifically said that N95 masks prevented SARS1 infection (this study was obviously before covid-19).

4310,In my Houston area suburbs area I am seeing less and less masks.
4311,I was in the grocery store for 5 minutes the other day and saw two seperate grown men not wearing them.

4324,"Please, deities?"
4325,The spice must flow.
4326,"Unless they invent a new type of arithmetic, they're come to the same conclusion as everyone else."
4327,There have always been requirements for how to do EOs or how administrative rulemaking works - the Trump admin just often failed to do the paperwork corrently or filed things out of order.

4720,"Yeah, last night, the district was filled to the brim with people not practicing social distancing, only a few wore their masks, restaurants were filled on the inside and out."
4721,There‚Äôs a football field open to the public that was filled with families.
4722,Not surprised.
4723,&gt; To what order of magnitude do you think the Chinese under-reported deaths and cases?
4724,"New York had 526,767 cases of which 33.287
deaths."
4725,Wuhan has worse medical services and has more inhabitants.
4726,For the whole province Hubei there were supposedly 4.500 deaths.
4727,"Based on the numbers of other large cities, in particular the number of cases should have been at least 10 times higher."
4728,"According to The Lancet, it was 4 times higher, but scientists need to be conservative in their estimates: https://fortune.com/2020/04/24/china-coronavirus-data-real-lancet-study/."
4729,"I can believe that government measures have worked in China, but not after the virus went through at least one city."
4730,It just doesn't add up.
4731,"Perhaps the senior officials aren't lying, but the mid-level ones might have been under reporting."
4732,I can imagine that a cover-up of this magnitude is going to cost China a *lot* in future business (who would ever want to trade with such sinister business partners?).
4733,"The idea in the West is that you are basically horrible people, considering that you have sold contaminated baby milk (I mean, how much more awful do you want to have it?)."
4734,"All your ""innovations"" have come from copying others, and you are still conning all your farmers in going to fake education programs."
4735,"Lie, steal, and cheat your way through life."
4736,That's what your reputation has become.
4737,Good luck with that.
4738,&gt; In Beijing?
4739,I'd expect some restrictions to remain in place and government health monitoring programs to be on high alert.
4740,"I think people can do work and travel, but I don't know the restrictions."
4741,The country is locked for foreign travelers from countries with high infection rates.
4742,Dude.
4743,My stepdad came home sick.
4744,"My throat is itchy, my chest feels odd."
4745,Snd my throat dry.
4746,I feel tired.
4747,I have an appointment Monday but like fuck man this is why I was trying to stay inside.
4748,I feel miserable.
4749,My brothers got it too.
4750,It only takes on person in the household.
4751,"Thirdly, multiple people can be blamed at once."
4752,People can definitely blame Trump even if they blame people who are partying in the street.
4753,"Yeah, once everyone's caught it and ~5% of the population is dead(I know it's higher than the current death rate of covid, the death rate goes up when hospitals fill)"
4754,Texas likes to do big and be big in everything.
4755,"Firstly, whatever the liberals do after Election Day does not change the fact the Trump contributed to the state of the pandemic."
4756,Trump needs to be held accountable no matter what other people do.
4757,"Secondly, it‚Äôs very unlikely the leftists celebrating today are causing the reported covid 19 numbers."
4758,The impact will be seen in future covid reports.
4759,Remember that 70 million Americans voted for a man who hosted maskless rallies across the US.
4760,We‚Äôre not a very bright bunch are we
4761,We have to be careful.
4762,All (even legit) demos that aren't with the actual rulings are imaged as radical right-wing conspiracy theorist.
4763,"The words ""Storm the reichstag"" also sound much stronger than pictures of what really hapenned."
4764,"Espacially the public channels (ARD, ZDF, WRD) seem like they got directive from above:

\- ""Every demo shoul be displayed as bad."
4765,"Make them right wing""

\- ""no bad news about school openings, or closings""

&amp;#x200B;

|  with way too many people not wearing masks and being too close together -  thousands upon thousands of them."
4766,"The police, when asked why they  didn't use a water cannon

Yeah, and the police decided that our, the human right of freedom, speech and so on, is more important than the use water cannons."
4767,Isn't this a good thing?
4768,Almost like states with predominately blue populations actually have their shit together
4769,"I think this might have been true at the beginning of the pandemic, when testing was seriously limited."
4770,"Given that we're doing a lot more testing now, and catching a more of the asymptomatic cases, it's somewhat closer to the real number."
4771,Wouldn't just happen through fucking around with animals.
4772,Cats can catch covid as can dogs..
4773,You good?
4774,"Compared to last week when the testing was happening all over the country, this weekend it's only taking place in 45 counties (all in norther part of Slovakia just with one exception of a county on Hungarian borders) which had a % of 0.7 or more tested last week."
4775,"However if you live in a green county which didn't have to get tested this week and need to travel to a red second round county next week you need to have a negative test result from the 2nd round, so a lot of green counties have a testing place or two."
4776,Starting tomorrow there will be controls on borders with the Ukraine where people entering will either have to show a negative PCR test or will need to get tested at the border.
4777,Same situation will happen at all borders starting Nov 19th.
4778,The plan is also to test health personnel and people in retirement homes every two weeks moving forward.
4779,Each county town will also have a testing place where people will be able to get tested with Ag tests when they want/need it.
4780,Ikr
4781,Don‚Äôt count on mushrooms for vitamin D. They have to be specifically exposed to produce it.
4782,Premature given the circumstances.
4783,They are trying to force acceptance of a disputed election.
4784,"Yes, but they also opened a bunch of schools recently."
4785,"We hit the marks set by the CDC in order to do so, but everyone in leadership was pretty sure it wouldn't work out if we did anyways."
4786,"However, you can't convince everyone of that fact, so it had to be done just so we could close up again."
4787,The automod says I'm not allowed to say why though.
4788,Once reacting doesn't impact multibillion dollar businesses.
4789,"Corporations control politics, politicians protect corporations."
4790,Two totally different issues.
4791,I agree that they should be out in large groups celebrating.
4792,But you thinking The prez has no responsibility in these rising numbers is delusional.
4793,His first priority as a president should be to protect his people.
4794,He has not taken this seriously since day 1.
4795,"All he had to do was wear a damn mask, tell others to do it."
4796,Instead he tells people it is going away and mocks his medical experts.
4797,The guy is a moron.
4798,That implies everyone has been wearing a mask... what world are you living in?
4799,Everything‚Äôs bigger in Texas.

4809,Yep.

4811,Oh man that's a difficult one.
4812,We are approaching the moment when is time to tell flat earthers who are actually putting your health in danger that free speech is actually not ok always.
4813,And that's a difficult thing to do specially for a government
4814,Don‚Äôt wait until you think you have obvious signs of breathing problems.
4815,"I only went because my cough was so bad my boss insisted, and it was only then I found out I had a lung infection."
4816,It crept up slowly but consistently and I never realized how much it had actually affected my breathing.
4817,The UK have always been about 2 weeks behind France.
4818,Hopefully the fact that the acted about the same time as the French means their peak will be a little smaller.
4819,US is it's own problem covid and all.
4820,Blaming russia et al is weakling fakery.
4821,Get to work fixing things here
4822,&gt;  knowingly exposing others to a deadly virus needs to result in jail time.
4823,Even more reason not to get tested.
4824,"Maybe, but the main reason is that the government lowered social distancing to the lowest level, which allowed all kinds of businesses to run, including gym, karaoke, club, sauna, and etc."

4856,And then they'll blame biden for the new cases
4857,That's why it called waves.
4858,We had a bad first wave in Europe in March/April and the lockdown got it under control and we had a fairly light summer.
4859,"But with winter, we've now got a second wave."
4860,"I'm Irish and we were getting 1,000 cases per day 3 weeks ago when we started the second lockdown."
4861,Now we getting around 300 cases per day.
4862,Bribery became instantly ok the second a Democrat got elected.
4863,You're that gaslighted.
4864,Look in the mirror and think about it.
4865,Hong Kong never did that.
4866,You're thinking of Mainland China.
4867,I honestly don‚Äôt see that in the article.
4868,The mutation is only present in Denmark; the regular strain was found in mink in the countries you mention.
4869,Or am I misreading it very badly?
4870,Yeah and vitamin D legit helps with a ton of shit and soooo many people are deficient in it
4871,The guy says out loud what whites think so yeah he'll get the votes.
4872,Nonwhites are never surprised about any of this
4873,Only 4 active cases in the entire state.
4874,That is a major accomplishment.

4877,well... i guess you never have read the Bible xD.

4882,"Like whether it was just traceable vs being active and being transmissible, ect."
4883,[removed]
4884,It won't be Easter.
4885,That's too far away.
4886,"At the rate daily cases are rising (which is exponential), America is going to have this disease so widespread they may well achieve herd immunity."
4887,But at what cost?
4888,"&gt; IRL: we are likely past the tipping point, where reality ranges from 'oh hell naw' to 'dear god'."
4889,"Looking at the plot on worldometer, the curve really looks like europe a months ago when the 2nd wave started to get going."
4890,98% of the people out in the streets are wearing masks.
4891,"Sorry your daddy lost, go cry at home alone"
4892,"Unfortunately, ""**we don't know for sure if it works**"" is all the anti-maskers would hear."
4893,The rightward shift of many countries politics back into the dark 2016-onward has been really disheartening.
4894,"The world should be moving forward, but it only feels like it‚Äôs moving back into reactionary, bigoted, and corrupt darkness worldwide."
4895,You missread the title.
4896,"Its not the mutation that has been found in different countries, its covid infecting mink in general."
4897,No it spreads way more easily indoors
4898,Is the colder weather making things worse?
4899,Are people wearing masks in your city?
4900,"He can work with the state governors to take action sooner, though."
4901,"Not every governor will participate, but if a coordinated plan emerged I think many would on both sides of the political spectrum."
4902,Yay!
4903,Glad I potentially helped one person!
4904,You need to quarantine for two weeks
4905,And then it will take months and months and months until it's widely available.
4906,"If we follow the article, the same mutation was found in 5 different european countries, as well as in a mink farm in the US."
4907,"That means that several thousand miles away from one another, the same mutation has emerged, and it has jumped to minx."
4908,"In Denmark, it has also infected select humans back."
4909,I'd assume it's people in direct contact of minx affected with it.
4910,All that needs to happen is for this new mutation to crack human to human transmission to spread widely in the human population.
4911,"Now, it could be a rather benign mutation in terms of illness severity, or it could not."
4912,"Either way, scientists would have to figure out whether potential vaccines would also be effective in preventing severe illness if this strain is contacted."
4913,"That takes *time*, which we can all agree that anti-lockdown folks are unlikely to agree to."
4914,It will be a pain even if the mutation doesn't affect virulence or mortality rates.
4915,Unless we can guarantee this strain is extinguished before it starts spreading from human to human.
4916,"And I'm sorry, given the current track record my country and others have with Covid, it's hard to believe most countries affected will get their shit totally together, there."
4917,Really worried about the coming months in the northern hemisphere.
4918,"Sweden tried herd immunity, stop using Sweden as a model of how to do anything unless it‚Äôs kill seniors"
4919,"Meanwhile in Melbourne where i‚Äôm from we have had 0 cases in our state for 9 days straight yet social distancing is in place, 50 people outside, 20 inside max and masks are manditory.. hearing this seems wild to me!"
4920,DeWine needs to grow a backbone and take a stand instead of asking us to ‚Äúdo what‚Äôs right‚Äù constantly.
4921,Obviously people aren‚Äôt.
4922,"We need actual consequences for the ones not wearing masks, not social distancing, large group gatherings, etc."
4923,"*Everything* is bigger in Texas, including pandemics."
4924,"Police even protect them when they have parades and demonstrations, so even if saluting in public is illegal they are allowed to still have demonstrations and such."
4925,https://apnews.com/article/4dc0818a28c2435c9058ce734707e05f Edit to add: I think it's disgusting that they're protected when spewing hate.
4926,Most recently there was an alt-right protest against coronavirus restrictions in Berlin which got out of hand with way too many people not wearing masks and being too close together - thousands upon thousands of them.
4927,"The police, when asked why they didn't use a water cannon to disperse them when things got out of control and they STORMED THE REICHSTAG: ""We didn't think it would look good for us to do that."""
4928,How many parents or grandparents will die directly from this event?
4929,The answer is likely more then 0.
4930,"Was this worth a human life, or possibly 2, or more??"
4931,Do any of them care?

4962,O western societies have a literally endless raft of excuses to surrender without a fight.
4963,Actual work is a violation of their human rights
4964,I think you could make an argument for BLM even given COVID because of the nature of the protest/the literal slaying of individuals.
4965,"In short, you could acknowledge the risk of COVID while still thinking the protests themselves were justifiable."
4966,Partying over a presidential win is NOT justifiable in any sense.
4967,"I'm not American-- I am liberal by Canadian standards so don't misunderstand me, this is not some conservative whataboutism."
4968,"But this shit is spiking bad, this will only make it worse, and there's 0 real argument to be made that it's OK in my point of view."

5043,People need to understand that they need to take MULTIPLE actions to control the spread of covid.
5044,Masks.
5045,Social distancing.
5046,Washing hands and disinfecting.
5047,Flattening the curve is still relevant.
5048,Fourth day straight?
5049,"Well, we should have a party to celebrate!"
5050,Another fantastic thing is that the directly opposing party *actually* work as a check-and-balance for the controlling party without being able to block meaningful legislation just for the sake of it.

5059,"Even if you put it that way, the virus can continue to maintain its lethality because we haven't properly identified its secondary host/animal reservoir where it jump off."
5060,Or a layman term the hard drive of the virus where it didn't mutate to be less lethal overtime for the virus.
5061,"Since we know for some viruses, like Nipah, MERS, it doesn't kill or negatively impact the animal host enough to stop its spread or force it to be less lethal."
5062,"Lastly, I'm not sure whether this logic will work for COVID19, because unlike SARS and MERS when are infected are the contagious during symptomatic stafe."
5063,"COVID 19 can still effectively during both presymptomatic and asymptomatic stages, and also has a longer and varied incubation period than those two."
5064,"So by the time the index paitent (paitent zero) notice the first sign of COVID19, they will probably already spread the virus to numerous people."
5065,This doesn't account for the chance the index paitent might not even have an infection serious enough for them to notice and report to a doctor.
5066,Stop replying to me unless you‚Äôre going to stop sending bullshit or something didn‚Äôt you say the covid death rate is almost 2.5 percent
5067,"Sweden have had open elementary schools and kindergarten through the whole pandemic, and their numbers suggest that children are an almost non-existant vector of transmission."
5068,"Of course I can't be certain, but most evidence seems to indicate risks are low in the youngest children."

5105,We had dozens of mass BLM outdoor protests in NYC this summer.

5163,"IRL: we are likely past the tipping point, where reality ranges from 'oh hell naw' to 'dear god'."
5164,Once there's enough community transmission you can't stop it without a real quarantine.
5165,Only Asian countries have done those.
5166,"In the future: when corona is still a disaster, many people will blame Biden for not averting a disaster more than is feasible."

5182,&gt; This will soon be killing a hundred thousand a month.
5183,Mere conjecture.
5184,does covid pose a real threat of mutating?
5185,Everything‚Äôs bigger in Texas
5186,Yeah but imagine if you didn't have a monarch.
5187,In the US the President is the highest elected official.
5188,Only outranked by 75 cooperating senators or 5 cooperating Supreme court justices.
5189,"I think India will have like 200m doses prepared by the time vaccine is approved, with a significant portion going for other countries"
5190,They tried to isolate the vulnerable parts of the population and let it spread.
5191,"Suffice to say, they massively underestimated the challenge, and most of their deaths came from nursing homes with no contingency plans."
5192,They also discovered that the economy is equally screwed if you don't lock down - shockingly people don't go out if they fear for their life.
5193,"Outside in passing, yeah a mask will be near 100% 

Outside surrounded by people for long periods of time, it's not going to be anywhere near as effective."
5194, Someone caught a second case and died from it with negative cases in between.
5195,"Immunity may or may not be temporary, but there are now a lot of different strains that seem to be different enough to catch them again."
5196,Immune response also seems to be highly variable so..... ?
5197,"Upper class, over-privileged women with shitty taste in fashion apparently"
5198,"If you do, specifically take D3 - the D that comes from animals."
5199,"You could also hang out in the sun, and you're own body will make it."
5200,If you are dark skinned it will take longer.
5201,I don‚Äòt think it‚Äòs understandable even for  today.
5202,"Quite the contrary actually, use the momentum of people checking the news to show them the numbers."
5203,Maybe then some of them will stop hugging each other in the streets.

5211,Happy my doctor put me on them for my seasonal depression!
5212,Trump didn‚Äôt call it at all.
5213,He said it‚Äôll disappear like magic in a few weeks.
5214,The scientists he ignored called it though.
5215,Very much so.
5216,Most people who take it have almost no issues or symptoms and are rarely hospitalized.
5217,There have been countless studies.
5218,Everyone should be taking atleast the daily recommended amount if not a little more.
5219,"I agree with you, I do."
5220,My lack of faith comes from my interactions with the public.
5221,I wear an N-95 mask every day for 9 hours.
5222,"Even with the most well meaning clients I serve, half of them can't even wear a fitted cloth mask or a procedure mask correctly."
5223,Working by appointment only due to COVID 19 I can help maybe 15 people a day.
5224,Half of them can't keep their noses covered or don't realize that a procedure mask is worthless if you don't bend the wire to seal around the bridge of the nose and eyes.
5225,"Extra N-95 masks will be great for personnel in hospitals, but without aggressive education and media to the public, any masks will be slightly helpful at best."
5226,Even figuring out a way to teach people that wearing masks isn't just cosplay is an enormous challenge.
5227,And Italy and others
5228,Isnt it illegal in Germany to do anything with nazi?
5229,Saluting and stuff lands you in jail no?
5230,I've never heard that story but I would bet it was Carter.
5231,His staff actually [gifted him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgWph6qnS4) a wood shop when he left office.
5232,96 years and he still seems sharp active.
5233,Thank god all my exes live in Texas
5234,Texan here.
5235,My inlaws are convinced my husband and I are being dramatic.
5236,That is is just a cold and we should go to Thanksgiving.
5237,"They go out to eat, shop, with friends, family, get togethers."
5238,They have no issue visiting my husbands 93 year old grandmother (they did not even visit before covid).
5239,They have attempted to plan a vacation.
5240,It's insane.
5241,They think it is a cold.
5242,"In their minds the worst that can happen in pneumonia, but I nearly died from the flu in 2018 and we are not taking chances."
5243,"The effects of herd immunity start at about 50%, but increase rapidly once you meet 70% population."
5244,"There is also a lot of accumulating evidence that people can be infected again as the strains of nCoV change, so what might have been a 1/3rd immunity starts to fall again over time, and on that front we just don't know enough."
5245,&gt;  I dared to dream that the days of sarcasm without /s already returned.
5246,Soon tho.
5247,It will happen soon.
5248,No.
5249,It will never happen.
5250,People have been making that same complaint since I first got on the internet in the early 90s.
5251,Sarcasm over text is not as straight forward as sarcasm in speech.
5252,"Even the best comedy writers can have difficulty, and everyday people writing a random population over the internet will struggle to do it."
5253,Trump cannot fire Fauci as he is not a political appointee.
5254,Excalty this
5255,"While the president can't pass laws, having jurisdiction over the federal government is huge."
5256,A least one article has come out... Maybe in vox?
5257,LETS GOOOOOO
5258,"ah, so you truly are a reliable course."
5259,So the difference between Sweden and the rest of the Scandinavian countries was only the use of masks and/or some lockdowns?
5260,"Um.. can you eli5, please?"
5261,What are the implications?
5262,It lives in the the cold?
5263,Its always existed in glaciers but now they‚Äôre melting?
5264,It can still infect ppl even when frozen?
5265,"I have so many questions, but don‚Äôt know enough about virology to make sense."
5266,"This is a relief , not only to US, also good news to the world."
5267,God bless all...
5268,It wasn't a hard lockdown but they were very real restrictions which have had very little statistical impact.
5269,"Before Halloween we had 200-300 cases a day, after Halloween we had nearly 700 with a constant amount of 500."
5270,I have friends who are ill and a few in the hospital.
5271,I don't want to see my fiances family but they want to have a big christmas celebration.
5272,I really hope we go into lockdown soon before we become El Paso.
5273,now there apparently is a new strain cluster 5 or something that has been confirmed to spread from minks to humans and humans to minks and  WHO says it has moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies.
5274,Not necessarily.
5275,Poorly regulated Wet markets (in Asia in particular) are known to hold animal carcasses and live animals (often held in cramped cages) in close proximity.
5276,"Some even serve often illegally hunted exotic wildlife (pangolins, rodents, reptiles, bats etc) in close proximity with more conventionally consumed meats (chicken, fish etc)."
5277,"The wild animals body parts (horns, scales, nails etc) are also used in traditional local medicines."
5278,Holding animals that are unlikely to interact in the wild in close cramped spaces creates a perfect breeding ground for viruses and pathogen zoonotic events.
5279,The 2002-2004 SARS outbreak was also traced to such markets.
5280,It‚Äôs believed to have jumped from bats to civets and then humans.
5281,And a 2014 avian influenza (H7N9) was traced to a market from hangzhou.
5282,The problem with this is that people often aren't showing enough antibodies to constitute immunity within months after recovering and many cases of reinfection have already been documented.
5283,Nothing in the numbers suggest this.
5284,"Not advocating Sweden's overall approach, but we have adopted their kindergarten/elementary school approach here in Norway as well, based on their numbers."
5285,"From what I've seen, the people celebrating Biden's victory are wearing masks."
5286,The trumpsters whining about emergency public health laws weren't wearing masks.
5287,There's the difference.
5288,"It's not ideal, but one group of people aren't directly breathing and coughing on their fellow citizens."
5289,"Trumpites lose, as per usual."
5290,Many of those schools have 'multiple cases' only have 2-5 though and sometimes they're unrelated cases.
5291,Compare that to wedding receptions where 50 people at one event test positive afterwards.
5292,"I hate long articles, this one was worth reading."
5293,"&gt; ‚ÄúI would test banked human blood samples for antibodies to find out how long SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in the human community and where it has been circulating,‚Äù says Ian Lipkin, the director of Columbia University‚Äôs Center for Infection and Immunity, whose **team used this tactic to trace the MERS coronavirus to camels in the Middle East."

5295,It is a cousin of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the original SARS).

5311,I start taking them for the winter months because of less sunlight.
5312,Good to know.
5313,Seems to.
5314,Data suggests decrease in symptoms and possible decrease in rate of either expressing symptoms or acquiring infection.
5315,"Rates of vit D deficiency are higher in those admitted to the hospital with Covid than in general population, though it is still high in general population."
5316,"With the onset of winter and shorter days, that will also get worse."

5336,"Having better healthcare will not save you from covid, either you‚Äôre body fights it off or you die."
5337,That‚Äôs why you only go to the hospital when you‚Äôre symptoms are bad enough.
5338,Hospitals cant turn you away if you‚Äôre dying and they can do something about it.
5339,Everyone dying of covid got a ventilator.

5344,&gt; although Africa's young population means that the IFR would still be lower than most Western countries.

5346,:( be safe y'all.

5353,"Also, since Biden has had what, 40+ years of experience, he already has a lot of relationships and he already has people that know what to do."
5354,Honestly I felt a lot better after hearing a reporter who follows this bit of information explain things.
5355,Based on what?
5356,I mailed them a cake!
5357,Not always.
5358,They also see it as a sign of weakness and still think covid is no big deal
5359,Oye gonna have a tough time when reality hits
5360,The most selfish you mean
5361,Do they do enough testing at their schools to know this though?
5362,"Maybe all those people who died in Sweden (much higher numbers than in other Scandinavian countries, where the health care system is similar) contracted the virus from their asymptomatic kids/grandkids"
5363,"So when two vaccines are projected to be done this month...

Tbh you‚Äôre actually just a good ass troll"
5364,I think this is key to avoiding future pandemics.
5365,Only by understanding the virus' origin can we do things like plan our day 1 to 7 responses.
5366,just one day and he did a lot better than Trump since the beginning of the year
5367,Well many people voted Biden because he isn‚Äôt Trump and not his opinions on Covid so maybe they just don‚Äôt care about safety.
5368,"I mean this pretty much sums up the difference between the parties

conservatives tend to focus on self-reliance, while liberals ‚Äútake more of a community-minded view.‚Äù In other words, they found that liberals believe in community-minded actions, while conservatives do not."
5369,first.
5370,"Parts of what you wrote I saw others saying almost word for word, this is so sad to see people suddenly have their lives (hopefully temporary only) messed up."

5384,"So...""actual black people"" are of a certain darkness?"
5385,"I mean, there are some Indians that have more melanin in their skin than some black Americans I know."

5394,If thats acurate were at 100 million cases then and theres no avoiding it anymore.
5395,Thanksgiving won't happen without a major spread.

5417,This could last 6 months.
5418,A year.
5419,It‚Äôs uncertain.
5420,I got sick at the start of March.
5421,My symptoms were heavily neurological/CNS.
5422,I had a major breakthrough and I can now pronounce 99% of the words I read out loud without having to sound them out.

5425,My memory is still awful and I get really confused/foggy.
5426,I feel like I‚Äôll be able to get back to the person I was but it‚Äôll take time and a lot of being proactive to get to who I was.
5427,The one thing I worry about are my eyes.
5428,My vision has changed and it gets to the point to where I can‚Äôt see or make out what is in front of me.
5429,I have to peel my contacts off.
5430,If I take a Benadryl I‚Äôve found that it helps.
5431,If I take steroids (I‚Äôm officially on round 5 since Covid) my vision gets so much... back to where I was and I don‚Äôt have to peel my contacts off.
5432,"I was given a cortisone shot, Meloxicam (for inflammation) and prednisone yesterday as well."
5433,When I get stressed or overwhelmed my vision and especially my brain seem to go to absolute crap.
5434,Anyway... there‚Äôs so much I want to do but I lost all forms of insurance due to not being able to work and now I‚Äôm paying $500 a month for awful insurance..
5435,I went from being a workaholic to this.
5436,Edit: wording
5437,"At this pace, we might be at 1,000,000/day before Christmas."
5438,Does that help?
5439,Every virus has a non zero amount of reinfections.

5443,"Lol the difference is I‚Äôm actually probably right, or (listen here this part is important little bro) my estimate is CLOSE to the reality"
5444,Definitely not
5445,I see your point but there is a thing I still don't get.

5452,"i heard covid is a rollercoaster with 2 major waves, the first one is milder, lasting about 5-10 days - mild fever, cough, loss of smell, fatique, etc., just moderate cold, then you seem to be getting better for 2-3 days, fever goes down, smell returns, and the second wave can be anything from  major fatique, breathing difficulties, high fever, all the way to hospital for some."
5453,But some people only experience the first wave.
5454,"Covid is very unpredictable, not only in huge variety of symptoms starting with cold like symptoms to a total lung and/or organ shutdown, it can also last from a few hours to a few weeks, increasing in severity."
5455,"Usually people with severe case of covid start experiencing shortness of breath around day 7-13, usually day 10 is critical by anecdotal evidence, where you either get better for good, or you decline rapidly to the point where one moment you are just mildly ill, to needing oxygen an hour after that."

5649,False.
5650,To neglect community spread within public areas is a weird narrative.
5651,"It spreads at the work place, bars, churches, colleges, etc...there are super spreader events that happen elsewhere outside of households, and that's where a lock-down (or in the US case...stay at home order) has an impact."
5652,Household spread will happen regardless of a lock-down.
5653,Public spread will be mitigated due to a lock-down.
5654,It isnt fool proof.
5655,"Gatherings in private are still an issue, but when the healthcare system is completely overwhelmed in an area, then we need to use every *tool* at our disposal to mitigate the spread, and lock-downs mitigate the spread in public."
5656,This isn't to say the entire US needs to issue a stay at home order.
5657,It should be used on an area by area basis.
5658,El Paso is a good example of an area that needed to issue a stay at home order.

5690,The question posed was how well it would do against the dollar if we experience large inflation over the next few years (which i guess your answer is it crashes).
5691,"When we have hit our 4th (most likely our 5th) straight day of +100k cases and our country has done nothing to fix it...we are opening up more and more, allowing more and more fans to large events, no speak of locking down....yeah we have given up as a country."
5692,Most other countries have taken the steps to limit the spread.
5693,Australia and New Zealand went on lock down for single digit cases.
5694,We are opening up with 100k cases a day.
5695,Our country still considers it too be overblown and the data falsified to make it seem worse than it is.
5696,Oh dear...
5697,"Yeah, sounds like your family is unusual."
5698,I don‚Äôt know anyone who is capable of what you‚Äôve done.

5704,Don't want to look bad.
5705,Which they do.
5706,I wonder how much of the jobs gain recently is because of a surge in Holiday hiring.
5707,"Of course they count as jobs despite being part-time and temporary, they can count a tennager raking leaves as a job."
5708,They're the type of jobs that won't be here in two months.
5709,They don't pay as much as the former jobs that people had.
5710,States that are taking a sensible approach to opening back up don't have as many job gains as states that have no restrictions at all.
5711,"One out of 28 people in Texas has covid-19, and it's getting worse."

5714,Thanks for explaining that South Dakota is heavily Republican.
5715,I thought it was a super liberal area.
5716,I believe it‚Äôs just tradition.
5717,It‚Äôs not even law the president has to live in the White House.
5718,We are in this bad spot because of trump‚Äôs do nothing approach.
5719,He lost the election because of how poorly he handled the virus.
5720,It is his fault.
5721,Biden already has a plan which he has shared to help control the virus and good news: his plan is based on science - actual science not demon semen doctor science.
5722,Man this really breaks my heart.
5723,Feel like some of the comments i see on reddit its like you guys live in another world.
5724,"On the east coast, in liberal cities everyones always wearing a mask and social distancing"
5725,[deleted]
5726,Exactly.
5727,What kind of half-assed excuse was that?
5728,!
5729,I‚Äôm a college student and I think your observation here is correct.
5730,"It hardly affects us, we hardly get sick if it does, why care?"
5731,Halloween saw my college town poppin as usual.
5732,"At the very least Biden can provide funding, assistance to governors, and leadership."
5733,"He can‚Äôt undo the damage Trump has done by having no strategy, so we are definitely in a hole compared to other countries, but he can start to slow this thing down."
5734,So 8 hours after my post?
5735,"Until, of course, they get sick and get the Long Covid."
5736,.... Can we really trust someone with Corona in their name to talk truth about Coronavirus?
5737,"Just kidding  ;)

So it's the this won't happen to me mentality .. this makes sense .."
5738,Funny how it doesn't matter until it does.
5739,Thank you for your feedback.
5740,Yeah ive heard about this too.
5741,We will eventually find out more.
5742,It‚Äôs really getting hard to keep going when everyone around me doesn‚Äôt seem to give a damn about the virus.
5743,I‚Äôve been doing what I can since things stated kicking off and most of my family won‚Äôt take any precautions and ague that masks limit your oxygen.
5744,I ran a mile in a mask to prove it had little effect other than getting soaked in sweat.
5745,They just made up some other bs excuse not to wear it anyway.
5746,3 day isolation is pretty useless with or without vaccine seeing as though it takes 5 days for most people to show symptoms
5747,"&gt;The Blood-brain barrier refers to an actual barrier

Thanks for that."
5748,I know.
5749,I reiterate.
5750,"""The Blood-brain barrier refers to a **soon to be considered outdated theory** .... "" etc etc."
5751,FTFY!
5752,That's how the history books will have it written.
5753,"Just like they do about Freuds outdated notions of Ego, Id and Superego."

5755,Just like they do about man never learning how to fly.
5756,Enjoy the last word.
5757,Its all yours.
5758,I know it's better in Europe than in America but here in Europe we have contradicting policies.
5759,For example you may only meet with one person at a time which isn't your household.
5760,But at the same time school is open with minimal precautions.
5761,"15 Students is no problem, just wear a useless non medical mask and open windows once in a while."
5762,They won't give you disinfectant nor will you have 6 feet distance from other students.
5763,If some has Covid19 the teachers won't tell you and play it down.
5764,I found out my school has Covid from the newspaper rather than my school.
5765,Now teachers will only answer yes or no if you ask directly if there is a new covid19 case or something.
5766,"No details

It's similar at work"
5767,"I know right, I can't wait to get my spindle of cd's for $2 or the 1  gig USB sticks for $1 without having to fight people for it"
5768,All we can hope for is that this wave burns out.
5769,There‚Äôs simply too much time between now and a new administration doing a better job.
5770,"By January this wave will probably have subsided on its own, or be so out of control that nothing could be done."

5812,I haven‚Äôt even driven past any of the areas where bars are.
5813,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they are all mask-less.
5814,I‚Äôd also say 5/10 people wearing masks aren‚Äôt wearing them correctly.
5815,You also have masks being sold all over the place and most of them probably don‚Äôt filter well at all or are missing the metal piece around the nose.
5816,Air takes the path of least resistance right around the gaps around the missing nose piece.
5817,I just don‚Äôt see a nation wide mask mandate being the cure.
5818,Even lockdowns have holes.
5819,People still have to buy food.
5820,You also have essential services that can‚Äôt shutdown.
5821,The company I work for was classified as essential.
5822,I will not say who I work for but I can assure you it is not essential.
5823,I‚Äôm fortunate that I was able to keep working but I‚Äôm not going to sit here and wish lockdowns on people that will not be able to keep working.
5824,It‚Äôs easy to wish lockdowns when you‚Äôre on mom and dad‚Äôs payroll or work a job the pays less than a stimulus check.
5825,Shows how pathetic we are can't even stay home for a month.
5826,"It‚Äôs almost like, we were put on notice 100 years ago when a pandemic killed millions yet the medical community is still unprepared when they re-emerge."

5836,I think Bitcoin will follow its usual cycles of fomo followed by huge crashes and it will never be able to replace fiat since its adoption is shit.
5837,Good luck explaining to your 50 year old neighbour how to use a hard wallet!
5838,"I mean politicians are not wizards, its not up to them to ""fix"" a pandemic... that responsibility falls on all of us."
5839,I think between trumps campaign rally attendance and the people who were out celebrating a biden win/trump getting voted out (and the people at the notre dame game who rushed the field... correction i meant the fact that there were even spectators at that game) it has become clear to me that it isn't going to matter one bit who is in office.
5840,America is going to continue to engage in risky behaviors (on all sides of the political spectrum)... when ever it is convenient for them.
5841,This mini me Trump needs to go next.
5842,"Yeah, no thanks."
5843,I agree i dont know why wearing a mask has become such an issue.
5844,"Its such an easy thing to do that works and shows respect to others, yet ive met many people who strongly object."
5845,And the bars and partying goes back to people my age not taking this seriously because of it not being as serious to us.
5846,"Covid wont go away until theres a vaccine and that could take years, college kids arent going to stop partying and going to bars for something that isnt an issue for them."
5847,I feel it's far from over.

5852,Completely the same.
5853,Hmm maybe the military budget.
5854,Or the billionaires.
5855,Or the taxes I pay for.
5856,Plenty of options.
5857,The only alternative to overloaded hospitals is telling people who show symptoms of the virus to stay at home until they either get over it.
5858,or they die.

6030,"That and when Masayoshi Son (founder of Softbank) offered to fund mass testing, he was heavily critized on Japaness Twitter for wanting to make Japan look bad, so he called it off."
6031,"That part of their culture might also have played a role, just maybe."
6032,They are politicians.
6033,Just because you don‚Äôt campaign doesn‚Äôt mean your not a politician.
6034,They are mostly strong party supporters and hired to accomplish the parties agenda.
6035,Trump fired lots of environmental scientists and focused on hiring people to work on his trade policy... do you really think Biden wants or is even capable of accomplishing his agenda with that in place?
6036,You ever get the idea in your head to play GTA by following all the traffic lights and not breaking the rules?
6037,How long does that last?
6038,Now imagine that you had enough money and power to do the same thing in the real world (minus the respawning after getting shot a million times lost).
6039,That's what the top 1% see the world... Or so I'd imagine because being in that tax bracket is the dream I dream when dreaming.
6040,I think there are a lot of Americans that don't see covid as a legitimate threat.
6041,"They simply look at it like its a bit worse flu and ignore it, even some that have already been sick."
6042,We shall find out
6043,"That's absolutely pathetic by the way, in France we do around 2 million tests a week IIRC."
6044,"To match France, the US would have to test roughly 10 million people a week if we compare both country's population."

6046,Now he's putting together a task force to come up with a plan?
6047,This seems fairly obvious
6048,Everyone in Asia Pacific has effectively stopped COVID-19.
6049,It‚Äôs a population compliance problem.
6050,Absolutely this.
6051,I think I have PTSD from having severe covid.
6052,"If most people would know how bad it could get, or how scary it is, being in the hospital all by yourself with everyone in PPE, they wouldn't want to leave the house."
6053,"I won't be sick of this news even if you guys keep up to the headline ""Pandemic officially over in the rest of the world"""
6054,Opening schools during a pandemic of a respiratory virus is insane.
6055,"
&gt;It‚Äôs thousands of jobs that need to be interviewed, background checked, etc between now and January

that's just it.... why the hell are they thousands of job turnover?"
6056,The only people that need to switch are the politicians.
6057,"Definitely not arguing with you on this, Trump rallies and Biden celebrations are both not responsible."
6058,"at least the majority of celebrators are wearing masks, unlike Trump rallies."

6085,What about wash your hands and keep your distance?
6086,I guess those are not necessary.
6087,They clearly wont.
6088,Both of who?
6089,Cases always drop for the weekend while many of the labs and public health offices aren't working.
6090,"Yeah, but my original point is to refute the original line:

""Never""?!?"
6091,Herd immunity hits all the time.
6092,I used Spanish Flu as one arbitrary example.
6093,The above assertion is false.
6094,To deny that is to deny science.
6095,"At current US case fatality of 2.3%, this translate into is almost 3,000 dead.... And that 2.3% is mostly from when hospitals aren't overwhelmed."
6096,It's insane to think just how little some people cares about human life.
6097,Texan here.
6098,Most of my family members and many friends think I'm being completely extra for only doing outdoor get togethers and refusing to travel for the holidays.
6099,God this is fucking sad and stressful.
6100,People won‚Äôt save themselves.
6101,I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs so sad (here in America) to see our cases skyrocket and people are more careless than they‚Äôve been this whole time.

6120,I don't like anyone dieing or suffering unnecessarily.
6121,I wish we could cure the flu and the common cold too.
6122,We‚Äôre into the stonks phase of global cases now.
6123,There are so many infections in america right now that by February you might have 40% of Americans having survived covid-19 at least once.
6124,This means that the Rt will likelydrop below 1 until September.
6125,But this will have cost the lives of more than 500K people.
6126,All this even without a vaccine.
6127,With a vaccine it's game over for the virus as long as the antivaxers are dealt with.
6128,Most here in Paris have been wearing masks for months.
6129,"Hell, I haven't stopped since the first lockdown in March..."

6142,Other countries have been able to restrict the spread much more successfully using these techniques.
6143,I just watched the same thing happen in DC and other cities when Joe Biden was called as the winner.
6144,Super spreader celebrations.
6145,There's 2 main reasons people voted for Joe.
6146,"1) because he's not trump ( i don't like trump either)
2) because liberal snowflakes like living with their parents and letting mommy and daddy (or whatever combo you have) make all the hard decisions and ruling over the household."
6147,Thats what joe brings.... big government to rule us all.
6148,"And when he starts getting intrusive with his policies, what then?"

6160,He can't do anything.
6161,Thankfully the president doesn't have the power to mandate lockdowns or mask wearing.
6162,No need to be defensive.
6163,You asked a simple question.
6164,You got a simple answer.
6165,I‚Äôm done worrying about other peoples behavior.
6166,Stuff is open and people are doing what they will.
6167,I can‚Äôt control that.
6168,I can only control my own behavior.

6176,"Most of the times, it goes below 150 and it's even lower when you only include in-country infections."
6177,The US is out of the race before it began.
6178,The two US vaccines require storage at -20C (-4F) and -70C(-94F) which is impractical for all but the largest African cities.
6179,The Chinese were the only country to pursue inactivated virus vaccines which can be stored at normal fridge temperatures and are much more suited to a standard supply chain.
6180,A serious inquiry needs to be made into why none of the Western vaccine makers tried to pursue an inactivated virus vaccine because there's a real geopolitical cost to human lives if China has the only inactivated virus vaccines.
6181,Okay....let's say I'm Jeff bezos.
6182,After I get a billion you're going to take anything else I make.
6183,I'll close up amazon.
6184,People may say that's what they want but they don't.
6185,I'm not going to just magically pay people more to prolong how long it takes me to make a billion dollars.
6186,I'm not arguing that a billion dollars isn't a lot for one person to have.
6187,But how do you implement it.
6188,Half ass numbers with no thought of execution will certainly not be an answer that will improve things.
6189,I'd rather see a tax code that encourages the ultra rich to continue operating but also requires them to pay their fair share.....not arbitrarily setting an amount of money that the government will take anything above.
6190,We will see.

6203,"In some way, subsidize this behavior."
6204,You'll need to guarantee small business loans for them to stay open.
6205,"&gt; Masks mandatory, with hefty OSHA fines for ANY company found breaking them."
6206,I've quit 2 jobs since I lost my OG one in March bc none of my coworkers wore masks.

6210,OSHA doesn't apply to weddings and parties.
6211,&gt; Start an education campaign.
6212,Paint some propaganda posters like keep calm and mask on.
6213,Where is the good propaganda these days?
6214,Only in adverts?

6216,Propaganda can be used to mobilize nations if done correctly.
6217,"There's dozens of adverts, flyers, and banner ads."

6219,"That one *should* be doable

6222,I will hear no excuses as to why this can't be done.
6223,Get it the fuck done.
6224,"They don't make excuses when they save our lives, do they?"
6225,Move mountains for em.
6226,This need will be more evident to everyone as our hospitals fill up and staff burns out.

6243,The guys been on the defensive since day 1.
6244,Its been a shitshow not because of one person I can guarantee you that.
6245,I pretty much don't disagree with you.
6246,"It seems like there are two rational choices available to any given country:

1) Wuhan style lockdown followed by rigorous contact tracing, and rapid clampdown in case of further breakout."
6247,"2) Let people be people, adding perhaps mask mandates and limits on large gatherings."
6248,(1) Only works with strong central authority and lots of buy-in.

6255,Guess their shares needed a boost...
6256,It's okay they're celebrating the fact that Biden won.
6257,Cases are rising 6.0% per day for the last two weeks.
6258,"In that time we've closed some school systems and moved some counties up one bracket on the severity system (to ""orange"" aka ""safer at home"")."
6259,We'll find out in two weeks if that worked.
6260,We need to get the spread rate down to at most 2% daily (and probably less) to avoid reaching a catastrophic point before the end of January.
6261,"With exponential growth, I like to think in terms of time rather than number of cases."

6295,"Of course this coronavirus tends to reproduce under epidemic levels until it finds a superspreading event, so this may not indicate any difference in fitness."
6296,"By same, you mean complete opposite?"

6309,Masks plus being outdoors is really effective for preventing super spreader events.
6310,Also the BLM protests lasted for many weeks and were much larger in size at their peaks.
6311,The Biden victory celebrations lasted for one day.
6312,The outdoor Trump rallies probably would have been mostly OK if they enforced mask wearing (though it is somewhat different since people were generally staying in one place more than in a protest/celebration).

6666,"True, some people will naturally be resistant and they will become dominant when the rest of us dies of repeated covid infections with 20 different strains."
6667,"That's how nature overcomes diseases; we just don't like to hear it because unlike nature, we care about the individual, not just the species."
6668,"Yep, wearing a mask is one thing but people tightly packed in like that doesn't help the situation at all."
6669,"I'm one of those people so misinformed they cite Oxford studies: 

[Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20205054v1)
&gt;At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue."
6670,"On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients."
6671,"COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls."
6672,So that is more than half of everyone hospitalized showing long covid.
6673,"Here's [WHO](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/risk-comms-updates/update-36-long-term-symptoms.pdf?sfvrsn=5d3789a6_2): 

&gt;**For some people, some symptoms may linger or recur for weeks or months** following initial recovery."
6674,** This can also happen in people with mild disease.
6675,** People are not infectious to others during this time.‚Ä¢Some patients develop medical complications that may have lasting health effects.
6676,"&gt;‚Ä¢COVID-19 can sometimes result in prolonged illness, even in young adults and children withoutunderlying chronic medical conditions."
6677,"‚Ä¢There are many case reports from people who do not regain their previous health following COVID-19.‚Ä¢Little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19 following milder illness.‚Ä¢In a telephone survey of symptomatic adults who had a positive outpatient test result for SARS-CoV-2, 35% had not returned to their usual state of health when interviewed 2‚Äì3 weeks after testing.1**‚Ä¢Among those 18 to 34 years in good health, 20% (1 in 5) reported that some symptoms were prolonged."
6678,"**

Now that I've cited Oxford and the World Health Organization I can provide many more sources if you require to stray from your misinformed believe long covid is ""rare""."
6679,Can I see your sources?
6680,Are they from February?
6681,He‚Äôs trolling
6682,No one can.
6683,That's why lockdowns don't work in free counties.
6684,I don't follow why you say geography is so essential.
6685,"Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand locked down their borders and imposed relatively (as compared to NA and Europe) strict lockdowns and all but wiped the virus out."
6686,Every other country could have done the same.
6687,"It's not like Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand were more successful by virtue of being more isolated seeing as most countries on Earth are capable of preventing any foreigners from entering their borders."
6688,As bildeberger people?
6689,Well you're part of the problem and why we won't ever get this under control but OK. For someone so angsty over not getting to party with people you seem determined to ensure we can't do so until 2022 at the earliest.
6690,I'm in Ohio so I guess our covid guidelines are less severe
6691,Why don't we call it what it is ... its a cumulative of it all.
6692,Not any of these are good.
6693,"Some worse than others, but 1 death is too many."
6694, I'm hopefully assuming most of those celebrating are mask wearing Democrats.
6695,Ehh that's not entirely true.

6707,Literally nothing is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù right now except for sitting alone inside your home.
6708,But that‚Äôs not a feasible solution for most people.
6709,So the restrictions now are designed to allow the most important things for society to continue while banning some of the less critical and/or higher risk activities.
6710,"As far as the current celebrations go, there‚Äôs not much anyone can do to stop them."
6711,Even at the height of restrictions people were allowed to go outside in their own neighborhoods if they wanted to.
6712,You can‚Äôt really do much about an event that makes hundreds of people simultaneously want to go outside beyond asking them to be careful.
6713,This just isn‚Äôt true.

6727,Not happening.
6728,Sorry my fault that was a poorly written article.
6729,You can do your own googling but CNN drew the wrong conclusion.

6734,You could say the same about many small business owners.
6735,"Whenever people talk about evil corporations and virtuous small businesses, I am reminded of the lousy, tight fisted owners of small businesses I worked at who were always on golf and ski trips while we toiled for peanuts."
6736,Part of the reason we need UHC is because a large  number of under or uninsured workers work for small businesses who provide little or no benefits.

6755,Gotta love the neoliberal love for having your rights chipped away and your pockets pilfered except instead of getting taxed on more income that you could be making it is instead just money you will never see.
6756,"I'm just saying that if POTUS advocated all along to follow CDC guidelines, wore a mask himself wherever he went, supported the science and testing, then yeah, it'd be on the citizens for fucking it up."
6757,Having the choice is definitely better than not.
6758,I feel optimistic for next year in regards to the pandemic.
6759,"First, Biden will be President and will have a much more competently-run Covid response."

6763,They discussed this on Twiv.
6764,(This week in virology podcast.)
6765,They did a study based on testing and isolating staff and encouraging staff to stay home when they had symptoms.
6766,I‚Äôm guessing that included sick pay - but I‚Äôm not sure .
6767,When the paper comes out I‚Äôll post it.

6773,"Indiana hit 5000 cases yesterday, we're ""right on track"" to be like Florida.."
6774,The strategy is... wait for the adults to finally assume office in January.
6775,You mean all the super-spreader events Biden is holding isn't helping?
6776,"One cute bit of trivia about the rebuild of the White House is that in order to dig out new sub-levels and clear things they needed to get a bulldozer in, but there were no doors large enough."
6777,"The took the bulldozer apart, brought the pieces in, and then rebuilt it inside the building."
6778,When they were done they had to disassemble it and carry it out in pieces again.
6779,Biden needs money and that‚Äôs going to only come through Congress
6780,What about California?
6781,"Honest question, arguing with a friend: He says the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic (i.e."
6782,"doing very little and trying to keep the economy open) is on par with most of Europe's handling (strict lockdowns), because the US's death rate is very similar to Europe's (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), but they are at least keeping the economy going, are we interpreting the information incorrectly?"
6783,"It‚Äôs clear in cases like this, just how much both sides of the political spectrum have politicized the pandemic."
6784,This is exactly the play.
6785,Republicans will re-take the House in 2022 and expand their lead in the Senate.
6786,Biden will lose in a landslide in '24 to Nikki Haley.
6787,The US strategy is to give in to Papa Nurgle.
6788,"Nurgle loves you, you know."
6789,"Well, it‚Äôs not that, so let‚Äôs not."
6790,"""help others"" triggers sociopaths."

6795,Yeah.
6796,My point was never anti-mask.
6797,"Large Land Mass Countries who haven‚Äôt done so well to curb COVID: United States, Russia, Brazil, India, France 

Large Land Mass Countries who have done well to curb COVID: Canada, Australia, China, Germany 

I don‚Äôt think a large land-mass necessarily means worse virus outbreaks, but it speaks volumes about the government‚Äôs handling of the virus."
6798,Isn‚Äôt it just gonna go away though ?
6799,"And everything is much bigger in California, and guess which states has more cases?"
6800,How was it a lie?
6801,"He says they may block *a* droplet, not droplets plural."
6802,"Otherwise, he would‚Äôve specified."
6803,"So no, it wasn‚Äôt a lie."
6804,"In fact, it was the truth."
6805,"I've also said if protests never led to outbreaks, gatherings shouldn't be restricted."
6806,Of course leaders or scientists are still pushing outside gatherings of 50 or less and are unlikely to say anything larger is safe.
6807,"Seems even the ""pro-science"" people would ignore them and still get together."
6808,[Nobody cares](https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx/status/1325163792955633670)
6809,I can see that but their tune might change if they had kept up on the research going on around the virus.
6810,Research suggests that even those with very mild symptoms might have long term consequences down the road.
6811,"We don't know much about what this virus will do at all, it could even remain dormant in the body similar to chicken pox and come back worse later."
6812,It could be link dengue fever and get progressively worse each time you get it.
6813,It could be both.
6814,"We don't actually know that people who get it mildly or even asymptomatically are safe, they just appear to be based on our current limited information."
6815,They could potentially all be in for a world of trouble within months or years.
6816,"But even if it is as fine as it seems, that seems like a very selfish reasoning to spread a virus that has killing so many people and is at best playing a bit of Russian roulette."
6817,"A significant number of people still get very sever symptoms and when the hospitals are full the death rate goes way up (it was at 10% and climbing where I live, until they locked everything down, it is reasonable to assume it could have climbed as high as 20%)."
6818,"Death rate isn't the only important stat, a significant portion of the population is crippled by this virus, and we don't know when or even if they will ever fully recover."
6819,It is all just ignorance.
6820,The only reason somebody could be fine with the virus spreading is out of pure ignorance.
6821,"&gt;switch from murderers

6822,"During a pandemic, how much of a difference is there between these two groups?"
6823,Right.
6824,"When POTUS mocks people for wearing masks, says COVID is not a big deal, and has no plan on how to manage it, what do people expect?"
6825,"If he advocated all along to follow CDC guidelines, wore a mask himself wherever he went, then yeah, it'd be on the citizens for fucking it up."
6826,It‚Äôs very interesting.
6827,I haven‚Äôt seen any other mainstream articles addressing this idea of cytokine storms.
6828,I find that Gina Kolata is an excellent science writer.
6829,We will maybe start to see more articles like this one in other papers.
6830,"Things there are crazy, many small shops closed, the mafia is losing a ton of money as the protection rackets bring in less and less money, the mafia is getting desperate, they are running from hospital to hospital offering to help get rid of the bodies."

6832,Seems to me you all depend way to much on rich white leaders of this nation no matter who to stop Corona.. you have already lost.
6833,Do you really think there‚Äôs 1 million active cases in Texas?
6834,"How fucking dumb are you man, if there were 1 million active cases the death toll would be skyrocketing even more than it is now."
6835,Thank you so so much.
6836,This is insanely valuable.
6837,Oh yes there is a strategy!
6838,They created the Covid task force!
6839,That's funny (may not feel so nice in Carter's shoes in the moment though) but it's honestly a good policy from an Opsec standpoint.
6840,Especially with #45 and his known history of leaks.
6841,We have transitioned from pondering whether action or inaction is more profitable to which flavor of inaction is most profitable.
6842,"Look guys, just accept the fact that the virus was created by nature as backed by many scientifical studies that it is impossible that a lab is involved (dont ask me for the articles i have never seen them but few hardcore folks here insisting on it and will flame you up if you mention the word ""lab"" üòÅüòÅüòÅ."
6843,No way the virus came from a lab.
6844,Humans do not possess such technology that nature holds.
6845,The virus doesn't care about politics.
6846,Also many of the events I saw had people wearing masks.
6847,OK I see.
6848,It sounds like your discomfort is more psychological then the actual fit of the mask.
6849,I guess the only thing I can say is thank you for wearing it and following the rules despite your discomfort.
6850,You're bringing us one day closer to stopping this pandemic.
6851,Literally the only reference to droplets in the entire video is when he states that masks have some capability to block them.
6852,Can you see how your initial assertion about his claim was in fact a blatant lie?
6853,Yep which is all a hold over from when the travel and information were slow and the fact that the US is massive.

6855,"Biden HAS the authority for shut downs, but with how divisive the country is at the moment, if a state tells him they aren‚Äôt shutting down, there‚Äôs not a lot he can do."
6856,"It‚Äôs also not in his personality to withhold federal funds, or be extremely authoritarian, to force states to shut down."
6857,He at most can make recommendations.
6858,"All this withstanding, he‚Äôs made it very clear he isn‚Äôt for shut downs"
6859,"From what I understand, this sort of complexity was a big stumbling block for Trump's administration from before he was even inaugurated."
6860,They hadn't done any of the ground work and left all of these decisions unmade.
6861,"Each of the subsequent outbreaks has been linked to the isolation centres, and found early because they perform regular testing on their quarantine workers."
6862,"The reason the cold storage outbreak got so big was because the first case, the cold storage worker, had no links to quarantine and those workers weren‚Äôt regularly tested."
6863,There is still no testing of cold storage workers.
6864,It was a blind spot then and continues to be a wilful blind spot now.
6865,If that cold storage hadn‚Äôt gotten sick and gotten tested it could easily have spread a lot further than it did.
6866,"There actually have been a fair few in China, and one in New Zealand."
6867,"The chances of spread from a cold storage delivery are low, but given enough shipments it becomes a near certainty."
6868,And you only need one undetected case to fuck everything up.
6869,Sure...
6870,"After the celebrations this weekend some will not be celebrating the Rona, for sure that help spread it like wildfire in every major city."

6873,Do you actually have separation of state and religion in america?
6874,"Asking because I was surprised to learn that there is no concept in english for the french word ""la√Øcit√©"", which is the basis of our democracy."
6875,"In short, laicit√© stands on 3 principles:

- separation of state institutions and religious orders

- equality of everyone in front of the law, no matter what are their beliefs 

- freedom of opinions and to manifest them in the public space, peacefully."
6876,eta : thinking of all those police shows where people swear to say the truth on the *bible*.
6877,"Trump is too busy licking his wounds, golfing, and filing frivolous lawsuits."

6971,The first wave of pandemic relief unemployment money (not the one time $1200) has barely gotten me through.
6972,It was not a pandemic in January 22nd it wasn‚Äôt even declared a public health emergency of international concern until January 30th and was not declared a pandemic until March.
6973,The WHO didn‚Äôt even recommend mask wearing until JUNE.
6974,"Trump isn't competent enough to successfully pull off something like that, don't worry."

7014,I think that Mother Nature and Mother Earth made a Corona Virus to balance out all the wrongdoings of the people towards the planeth Earth.
7015,"Destroying ecosystems, and animal habitats, global warming, destroying of coral reefs, huge melting of ice, all of those things put planet earth outf of balance, and our mother nature is one huge living organism that, my opinion is, marked humans as a threat number one, and started acting accordingly."

7110,it's hybrid solution trying to please everybody at the same time but it doesn't work.
7111,if everybody is forced to stay home the lockdown would last 1.5 month then you can work on eliminating the pockets that are left (if you have mandatory contact tracing going on all the population).
7112,and well vaccine on hand would help too.
7113,right now it's just spreading en masse and having such a spread mutating is very likely so people will catch multiple strains of a virus that can have serious permanent effect on organs and cause death.

7328,I've seen a few jurisdictions switch from person positivity to test positivity.
7329,You can see both on Wisconsin's data summary page.
7330,"Currently, person positivity is 34.4%, while test positivity is 17.4%."
7331,"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm

7-day percent positive by person, tests by person
&gt; Percent positive is calculated as the number of positive tests (confirmed cases) divided by total people tested."
7332,People are included as testing positive (dark blue bars) on the date of their positive test result.
7333,"If they tested positive more than once, they are only included once on the date of their first positive test result."
7334,People who tested negative and never positive (gray bars) are counted once on the date of their first negative test result.
7335,"However, if someone tests negative, then positive at a later date, they are removed from the negative count and are now counted as a positive."
7336,"7-day percent positive by test, total tests by day
&gt; In this graph, people are included each time they are tested."
7337,"If people tested positive or negative more than once, they are included and counted each time, on the date the testing lab reports their test result."
7338,Tracking by test provides a daily view of test positivity and is a more recent method used by other groups.
7339,This is a really silly take.
7340,He criticized Trump because Trump ORGANIZED the rallies and was the HEADLINE PERFORMER.
7341,"When Joe Biden gives a speech at the Times Square celebrations, then we can call him a hypocrite."

7343,"Yes, 7 day average is 54k as of yesterday, the week before it was 40k, the week before that 31k."
7344,The last 7 days had a higher growth rate week on week (35%) than the previous 7 days (29%).
7345,We'll see if that drops in the next 7 days.
7346,Remind me in 1 week.
7347,Trump's lawyers are also idiots
7348,"On the payroll of hypocrisy so he/she/LGBT/whatever can feel so good about self, then all the sins they done can be forgiven by their all mighty lord/shiva/Odin/etc."

7350,"I don't know the details, but I think on Monday Biden will announce his plans."

That was clear in spring."
7352,No need to start getting hysterical because of old news.
7353,"Yep, unless you work at the Pentagon or some other sensitive position there's zero reason to be in the office."
7354,I still haven‚Äôt figured out the propaganda that China aims towards America.
7355,It doesn‚Äôt have a cohesive and partially-believable theme the way that Russia manages to so effectively achieve for their alt-right messaging.
7356,Maybe they will figure something out now that a sane person is leading America.

7488,No none of that was shady.
7489,China is the moral authority and benchmark we should all follow right?
7490,I do believe China had a stronger reaction than the US.
7491,It‚Äôs a lot easier for a communist county to lock people in their apartments to die.

7588,"Biden may end up somewhere in between, if the GOP controls the Senate."
7589,Lol
7590,I don‚Äôt have legal authority.
7591,"But, how does he convince more people to do the most important thing, wear a mask and social distance?"
7592,Everyone has been saying this since the beginning.
7593,USA just chose to ignore it
7594,"Let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs Republicans that don‚Äôt want to do anything, let‚Äôs stop grouping all them together."
7595,"We have a party that refuses to govern, the Republicans have US covid relief bills on their desk since May."
7596,Let‚Äôs stop with the both sides bullshit narrative.
7597,We have won this battle but we must continue to be engaged at this level if we really want the progressive reform we want and need in this country.
7598,"A ‚Äútask force‚Äù is an age old tool used by politicians to create a body that they can distance themselves from if things go pear shaped

Biden isn‚Äôt even in office and he‚Äôs already using standard DC tricks"
7599,Arguably one of the greatest opening theme songs of all time
7600,"Thanks, I'll try that."
7601,If I can find an affordable solution that would be wonderful.
7602,"Just cutting out most of the animal products have left me scrawny and hungry, I seem to burn even complex carbs right off and am unfortunately lactose intolerant."
7603,There's just so much peanut butter a person can gag down.
7604,"Also today‚Äôs update from BNO:

- New cases: 128,396
- Positivity rate: 9.5% (+1.3)
- In hospital: 55,817 (+993)
- In ICU: 11,078 (-7)
- New deaths: 1,097

Hospitalizations are very close to reaching the all-time high of 60k."
7605,Good.
7606,I don't support businesses who don't protect workers and customers either.
7607,I had to refuse to buy from someone at the farmers' market because he didn't wear a mask and had the audacity to argue with me when I requested that he wear one while speaking to me.
7608,"No thank you, I don't want the vegetables you just spoke moistly on."
7609,Slovenia has curfew 9pm-6am.
7610,Everything but grocery stores is closed.
7611,All non-emergency doctor's appointments have been cancelled.
7612,School above 5th grade is online.
7613,Kindergartens are closed.
7614,"Can't leave your own municipality (unless for work or another necessary travel, only with written permission) and to give you some perspective, a lot of municipalities don't even have a store."
7615,Masks necessary everywhere where a safety distance of 3m cannot be established.
7616,It's worse than 1991.
7617,Yeah they do a ton of shit.
7618,It‚Äôs hard to even find mention of transition responsibilities on their Wikipedia article (maybe a good task for someone)
7619,So another 100k or so will die needlessly before a proper leader comes in
7620,The Corona virus just got voted out!
7621,Wouldn't the Democratic turnout also be a factor?
7622,"Keep in mind, it's only a few weeks until the next vote, and turnout will very likely be much, much lower (as it is for all atypical election days.)"
7623,Get rid of ajit pai asap.
7624,Fuck.
7625,Denmark needs to be isolated from the world.
7626,"The fact they allowed this situation to develop without accurate reporting 
Is shades of Wuhan."
7627,Same with the other countries not culling minks by this point.
7628,"It's obvious they're trying to thread a needle between mink farmers, and a force of nature."
7629,"If Denmark won't do the right thing, other countries need to close their borders to Denmark."
7630,"Until Denmark takes this seriously, the world needs to isolate them."
7631,Taking seriously = closing your borders and sending in biowarfare military units to contain this virus.
7632,"If this sounds overboard to you, its because we have been effectively lied to by public health doctors that these things can't be done, and if they were they would be more harmful than the virus."
7633,"No, they are the only way to contain a pandemic."
7634,Period.
7635,Remember when the WHO said anti-Chinese racism was more of a threat than covid?
7636,"Sorry Danes, you're Wuhan now."
7637,Pressure your government to declare an emergency quarantine of the region.
7638,Quarantines are not a suggestion.
7639,I don't know where public health doctors decided quarantines are too mean for people.
7640,It's literally the one tool we have.
7641,Omg I miss the kids staying over at their grandparents‚Äô house.
7642,"That hasn‚Äôt happened since February and I don‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs like to be alone with my husband except in the evening after the kids go to bed, and we‚Äôre both exhausted anyway."
7643,We also used to meet up for lunch once a week on our lunch breaks when the kids were in school and I miss that too.
7644,Those were the days.
7645,What in the actual fuck?
7646,McConnell blocked it because he thought it should be a $500 billion package and no more.
7647,McConnell has always been the roadblock.
7648,üòÇ
7649,As disgusting the amount of money that is getting spent on political campaigns is.
7650,This one time im willing to look the other way.
7651,It could be a blessing that we had the run off.
7652,These 2 elections will be the only elections going on in the entire country.
7653,With democrats seeing that they actually can win.
7654,Combined with the DNC and americas checkbooks.
7655,There is a real chance we take those last two seats or even 1 of them.
7656,Needing only a single republican to defect is a hell of a lot easier than 2.
7657,"What about people with a BMI that shows them as ""obese"", but in reality, they're just ""overweight"" due to muscle mass, and frame size?"
7658,"In other words, think of the ""American Football Linemen"" look."
7659,I ask because this describes me.
7660,"I'm 6'2, 274lbs, which qualifies me as ""obese"", but in reality, I just have a ""dad bod""."
7661,"I have a huge frame, huge shoulders, I lift, and have a lot of muscle, and I do cardio about 30-40 minutes every day."
7662,"I realize I still need to lose weight(and I have been), but even my doctor looked at me, and said I'm not ""obese""."
7663,Also Danish and I agree.
7664,"Although I do think we are a bit quick on the full blown mink holocaust, as it is one of our biggest exports, it's nice to finally see some decisive action being taken."
7665,/s?
7666,Well not like Trump can fire him now
7667,"Our hospitalizations are very close to reaching the all time high of 60k, with no end in sight :(

Also for anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen these yet, here are some helpful resources which clearly show the surging hospitalizations nationwide but especially in the Midwest:

[Total currently hospitalized for the US](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized)

And here is a [great resource for tracking the test-positivity trends](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states)."

7669,Lmao you entitled little person.
7670,My mom is American.
7671,You really need to spend time outside of your country and realize how good you really have it.
7672,how many people are going to die for your party?
7673,"Sorry,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You do realize the second highest vote-getter in American history is Donald Trump in 2020, right?"
7674,This statement is completely nonsensical and irrelevant because he lost.
7675,"That's wierd, I follow them to protect others not my self."

7682,Important factor.
7683,Maybe more infectious but less deadly.
7684,Trump will get the praised for the stimulus and Biden will get blamed for the deficit
7685,Yep.
7686,Big spikes coming.
7687,There is definitely a good chance... endemic is fairly certain.
7688,"Mutations are 'funny', in that nature has a dark sense of humor."
7689,Time will tell.
7690,Might get some temporary herd immunity after Thanksgiving with millions gathering indoors.
7691,Fauci is more of a boots on the ground kind of guy.
7692,"You want him analyzing the data and working with models, then giving recommendations."
7693,"Biden is picking a former Surgeon General, former FDA Commisioner, and a doctor from Yale who specializes in public health."
7694,It's going to be a good team with Fauci backing them up with data.
7695,Where did you read that something was two months away?
7696,Never heard of that.
7697,"It was always ""end of year to early 2021 for the first doses""."
7698,"Yeah, idk what people are thinking."
7699,"Like we get it, you‚Äôre happy."
7700,Cant you party on your own at home?
7701,"Get a cheap bottle of wine, plop on a couch and relax."
7702,Oh and what‚Äôs also bad is that Cuomo said that he‚Äôs be lifting restrictions from Brooklyn‚Äôs red zones.
7703,"They‚Äôre laughing and cheering today, but they‚Äôll be crying in few days or weeks if, god forbid we‚Äôll get 200,000 new cases per day."
7704,"We‚Äôre already at like 130k/daily, arent we?"
7705,No restrictions.
7706,We are at the mercy of the Senate keeping him in check and they have thus far proven themselves to be unwilling to do this.
7707,...
7708,I still can't believe it's called Regeneron.
7709,Cases are going up up up in Illinois

7711,Richard Dawkins was asked what kind of behaviors commonly accepted today would eventually be considered as heinous as we currently consider slavery.
7712,"He said, without a second's thought, the treatment of non-human animals."
7713,Absolutely right on.
7714,It's a boundless evil.
7715,The hope is that they push so hard they just annoy people.
7716,I just want to say thank you for your hard work and for continuing to work despite the risks.
7717,"If it makes you feel any better, there ARE a lot of people who take it seriously and do everything possible to avoid getting sick and transmitting to others."
7718,"It's easy to forget this when the irresponsible, selfish individuals drown out the good ones."
7719,Wishing you to continue to stay safe!
7720,"In less than a day since being named President Elect, Biden has arguably taken COVID more seriously than Trump has in nearly a year."
7721,"except that was in china, a country that did a much better job at beating covid than any western country."
7722,Why?
7723,"Now that the election is over, fake COVID-19 is just going to *poof* disappear."
7724,/s for the unknowing
7725,Clean energy is cheaper and doesn't actively fuck humanity.
7726,Renegotiating the Accord and straight up pulling out and extending s middle finger are completely different things and I only approve of one of them.
7727,"Also I know you probably just overlooked it but if you're addressing my whole post don't skip the white nationalists part, it looks bad"
7728,"Yeah, I bet proximity to a military base/family members working on base is a HUGE spreader."
7729,Military quarters are typically poorly ventilated... somewhat crowded... and infamous for breeding pneumonia.
7730,"it's socially acceptable, that's why I don't care about measures and shit."
7731,"Anything outdoors is low risk, outdoors without masks and distancing is still safer than indoors with both masks and distancing according to estimates using https://www.microcovid.org/calculator but shouting definitely increase the risk by a lot."
7732,They are a worry for me since they are in my yard often.
7733,Unfortunately they don't use the gate they just make a new one anywhere they like.
7734,"I don't think Chicagoans have been ignoring the protocols, the way south Florida has."
7735,USMF if I know my American
7736,I was so broken hearted when I saw the celebrations happening in American cities.
7737,"Yes, people were mostly masked."
7738,Yes the sunshine was out.
7739,Yes it was outdoor.
7740,"But that doesn't magically mean there won't be infection when people are packed shoulder to shoulder, people were hugging each other, and people yelled and sang - many times with their masks on the chin."
7741,I couldn't imagine how doctors and nurses feel when they see the scene.
7742,"I really hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid another outbreak might just happen in two weeks."
7743,"I understand the feeling of happiness for Americans of a certain political leaning is probably hard to contain, but it's as if they all forgot that the pandemic is still there."
7744,Let this comment age like milk.
7745,Yeah.
7746,Fuck.
7747,Nothing comes easy in this life.
7748,"I know, but I‚Äôm hoping that after turning Georgia blue voters will see that their vote does matter, and that staying home only helps to perpetuate the myth that nothing ever changes."
7749,Just ask Alexa or Siri or Google assistant.
7750,"They'll tell you, no pictures necessary."
7751,"Technically, Cuomo did stop the spread."
7752,‚ò†Ô∏è üßìüëµüë¥
7753,Oh wtf I didn‚Äôt even reply to you the first time around you probably got me confused with someone else
7754,"I don't know why this was downvoted, but anyone can check on Worldometer, there are practically zero new covid infections per day in China, since 15th of March."
7755,China is Covid free since about 8 months.
7756,"(There are 10-20 cases, probably by people arriving from outside of china and quarantining / testing.)"
7757,Alot of that in my opinion is in large part due to turnout from Trump.
7758,Remember this runoff now is going to be based on policy and an indictment of voting records of the incumbents.
7759,Very different dynamics to the race.
7760,A ton.
7761,Our government is full of shit bag incompetent fucks that Trump appointed.
7762,Its like being on a ship where a group of zoo animals have had control of the bridge.
7763,Getting back in and kicking them out so trained professionals can pilot the ship is going to make a big difference.
7764,"We encroach on and pollute their habitats, and I wonder if that will affect the safety of wild game consumption."

7775,"Counterpoint: anyone that views Fauci as ""too political"" would likely not listen more-so to someone else appointed by Biden."
7776,"I'm not well versed in top epidemiologists, but I believe that Fauci's credentials are impeccable and that given the circumstances of the Trump administration he has been less political than many others might have been able to be."
7777,Yeah and we will unbury all the hundreds of thousands dead in the U.S. and they can collect their Covid actor checks.
7778,"The rest of the world will all yell ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on COVID Camera!‚Äù

And Joe Biden will still be President."
7779,To an extent.
7780,I think it would cost them the midterms if they continue the obstructionism when people are still hurting and it's getting worse.
7781,The GOP knows what the people are capable of.
7782,On the ballot or in the streets.
7783,They don't dare risk it too long.
7784,How is it suspect for them to take it seriously?
7785,The world is abuzz right now about who to blame next for Covid.
7786,I'm sure Denmark doesn't want that weight and hopes that we can get over this just the same as everyone else.
7787,"The difference is that they were willing to do something about it, and we are expecting everyone to be lazy about Covid because others have been."
7788,I think we should commend Denmark for taking our health seriously.
7789,I get called a ‚Äúbad parent‚Äù for choosing to keep my kids home and do the distance learning option offered by the school system.
7790,I realize this impacts their education and social/emotional health.
7791,"However, the risk to children isn‚Äôt 0."
7792,The risk to me isn‚Äôt 0 as a middle-aged person.
7793,"I don‚Äôt know what would happen for sure if we caught this virus, and what the long-term effects would be after recovery."
7794,I‚Äôve known about two dozen people who have caught it and it was very rough.
7795,"I know children are resilient and we can make up missed education, and social/emotional development (luckily I have two kids so they get some of that from interacting with each other)."
7796,"We can‚Äôt ever reverse death, of any of our family members, or long-term chronic health problems."
7797,I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt get that.
7798,I‚Äôd rather cautious.
7799,"But I also realize there‚Äôs a lot of parents out there that don‚Äôt have the ability to keep kids home from school because they have to work full time, so I get that."
7800,"Also, the schools in my county just shut down for at least two weeks because we have 200 kids and staff in quarantine and about 15 Covid positive students and teachers."
7801,"My kids aren‚Äôt facing the back-and-forth of schools opening and closing repeatedly by doing distance learning full-time, so there‚Äôs that."
7802,And this coming week is already baked in.
7803,We just don‚Äôt know how high it‚Äôs going to go.
7804,50% increase from what were record highs a week ago...  that is just down right frightening.

7809,That's positive.
7810,"Actually, it is a little surprising that number is as low as it is."
7811,"There's been a million new cases in less than two weeks, and hospitalizations are going up right with it."
7812,"ICU patients, though, still intuitively seems low-ish (all things considered)."

7814,I feel so bad for you guys.
7815,In Canada the divide between left and right is very real but our elected officials out it all aside to deal with Covid-19.
7816,It's just nice to know your country actually cares a out it's people.

7828,Still a good sign though
7829,And?
7830,He and the task force don't have power to do anything.
7831,No one cares.
7832,The minimum is zero.
7833,"If you have more than zero cases and an R-effective above 1, you will eventually get tens of thousands of cases a day."
7834,There are very few exceptional countries that have suppressed covid to the point that the number cases went down and stayed down without a lockdown or series of lockdowns.
7835,Taiwan and South Korea and maybe China come to mind.
7836,Almost every western country including supposed successes like Germany that are well organized societies now have increasing case numbers and are going to have to lock down again to stop the disease taking its normal course.
7837,Respiratory diseases with lots of asymptomatic carriers are generally very difficult or impossible to keep from spreading if people live live that are at all normal.
7838,The pandemic is going to kill some people now that it is upon us.
7839,Lockdowns kill a different set of people depending on how they are applied.
7840,We need to make intelligent and fact based decisions on what paths we are choosing keeping in mind that Covid is now a permanent part of life like the Flu.
7841,A really good vaccine is the only get out of jail free card and there is no guarantee on will ever come and if it does it seems unlikely to happen in the next 4-8 months.
7842,I really wonder where you get your information from.
7843,"The U.S. census bureau uses median income, which they report yearly (no statistics for 2020 yet as well)."
7844,An average of an income statistics is not useful.
7845,"Also, if it's over 100 grand on average, doesn't that means that rich people dies more than poor people?"
7846,Seems your statistics is even contradicting your own claims.
7847,And have you not heard of certain people getting access to better healthcare for Covid?
7848,And have you never heard of people being unable to afford any healthcare?
7849,"A ventilator is a ventilator, but some people gets them and some don't."
7850,My town has a positivity rate of thirteen percent
7851,I live in a country where horns are used for social reasons almost as much as traffic ones so I love it lol
7852,Exactly!

7886,I refuse to believe all conservatives are that bad.
7887,Pretty sure there's a good amount of nice ones too.
7888,This right here is why 300k are dead and we have 130k new cases everyday.
7889,People need to understand choices still exist even if they don't like those choices and this is a choice that is literally life and death.
7890,This is NOT going to get better unless people wake the fuck up and realize their actions are perpetuating this pandemic.
7891,Avoiding short term discomfort is NOT worth the lives of 300k people.

7919,I live in Oklahoma and I literally just heard of this on the news.
7920,Yet no one I know has covid
7921,"Congrats to Texas, it‚Äôs only gonna end up killing 20 thousand people"
7922,"As an American, I agree 100% with everything you said."
7923,"I think the writer was just having a little fun putting ""World Record"" in the title - as you point out, it doesn't really mean anything."
7924,Maybe he is a sports writer temporarily on load to cover Covid - they love to put jokes in headlines.
7925,"When we were having 700 a day, so was the UK... now we're on 0 and today the UK reports 24,957... lockdowns, masks and effective test&amp;trace work."
7926,"Probably, but we have over 10mil more people, and our rate was only 12.9/100k last week, compared with Texas' 28.5."
7927,"Could be Florida with a surprise run for it, maybe."
7928,I think they're basing it off of most cases a country has put out in a day.
7929,Why would that be your answer?
7930,has the virus jumped to american minks yet?
7931,Texas has 70 million people?

7944,I have a bunch of friends who dance ballroom and salsa in Texas.

7948,"Believe it or not, this article has a pretty optimistic outlook on vaccines."
7949,"For those of us who are eager for a vaccine to release as part of a pathway to return to our normal, boring lives, this is pleasing to read."
7950,&gt;What does that mean for the development of vaccines?
7951,What effects does the mutation in mink have on the formation of antibodies against COVID-19?
7952,&gt;The protective effect of the antibodies in the vaccine is to prevent the virus from multiplying in the human cell.
7953,"To do this, the antibodies must bind to a specific virus protein, called the spike protein, to prevent the virus from entering human cells."
7954,"**The mink mutation now apparently affects the binding site of the spike protein, causing some antibodies to lose their neutralizing function."
7955,"On the other hand, the vaccination creates dozens of different antibodies that bind to different sites on the spike protein."
7956,** ***Many of them should still have a neutralizing effect even with the mink mutation.
7957,"***

&gt;Some vaccines are on the verge of breaking through."
7958,"Should manufacturers like Biontech, Curevac or Moderna now need to revise their tests again?"
7959,"&gt;No, I don‚Äôt see it gloomy."
7960,**The mutation does not mean that the vaccinations are ineffective.
7961,"** Compared to infection with Sars-Cov-2, ***much higher antibody levels can be achieved with vaccinations, which also have a broader spectrum of action."
7962,*** And so far it has not been shown that the new mink variant is already widely distributed.
7963,These answers are from German doctor Martin Kr√∂nke.
7964,"The argument, to me, comes across as saying that the vaccines are designed to cover a wider range of spike proteins that our antibodies can bind to."
7965,"This could mean that the vaccines already factor in the mink originated mutation, even though we didn't know about this mutation in particular."
7966,"Obviously we still have to hope the Danish government succeeds in driving this strain to extinction, and we have to hope that it doesn't actually dampen antibody responses to any significant effect, but this news made me more optimistic about the vaccine bringing us a return to normalcy despite a constantly mutating virus."
7967,"Those ‚Äòfans‚Äô absolutely disrespected the players, the team and everyone who‚Äôs been following strict protocol"
7968,damn.
7969,and this is the weekend.
7970,usually cases are much lower than during the week.
7971,Even if Biden does everything right... it's gonna take a whole lot of convincing 70 million Americans this is not a hoax.
7972,"For what it's worth, I saw a lot of mask wearing at Biden's victory speech."
7973,It is to mink.
7974,100% fatal.
7975,There is no such thing as ‚Äúevil‚Äù you hillbilly.
7976,Mother is looking for her lil Mikey.
7977,For most Of the west 700 cases a day for a population of that size sounds non that bad in this day and age
7978,I hoep they succeed but jesus fucking christ we have a lot of climbing to get out of just the covid hole.
7979,Were gonna need international help.
7980,"Trump's taskforce was not effective, and was disbanded in the middle of the first wave."
7981,"He argued that the virus would go away by April, disbanded the taskforce around then, then watched thousands of Americans die and laughed about it."
7982,and then like a miracle disappear
7983,Your average American is stupid so imagine the other half of the country is even more stupid and I'm talking about all the people in America.
7984,Hahahha you have got to be fucking kidding me
7985,"There is no ""finding"" the money."
7986,The money is there it just needs to be allocated.
7987,Please
7988,"The actual answer is that with Trump having set the precedent of doing whatever he wanted at the beginning of his term with executive orders, quite a bit actually."
7989,"&gt;if stuffs like abestos can cause lung cancer decades late, there's always a risk
&gt;

Again, this is not how vaccines work."
7990,There is no equivalency between an inactivated vaccine and baby powder with asbestos in it.
7991,Stop spreading misinformation because you clearly don't understand what a vaccine fundamentally is.
7992,"&gt;there is a reason why countries have to approve it under emergency use, because their policies will not accept vaccines tested in such short periods."
7993,"&gt;

Yes, that's the point, that's why most people will only get it after a Phase III."
7994,"&gt;and yea like cervical cancer vaccine, we will not know whether it has long term effects, since even the manufacturers didn't test it for so long, maybe they have test subjects that they would pay close study for over the decades but with so many variables it'd be hard to trace the cause of illness over the decades, so in short, even if there's long term delayed side effects we will never know, and what we don't know won't hurt us, we will always blame it on something else."
7995,"So in short i have changed my views on this vaccine, it should be safe, don't think too much about it."
7996,"Again, this is just debunked anti-vaxx stuff you're perpetuating and I can't even begin to address it - no, you don't get effects after 'decades'."
7997,"You can dodge vaccines if you like, the point is you aren't even going to be offered one until March or so, when there will be loads of Phase III trial data out (9 months' worth)."
7998,"Most ignorant countries in the top of cases, I'm shocked I tell you!"
7999,no time!
8000,gotta prepare for thanksgiving!!!
8001,and xmas!!

8003,But then the fire nation attacked
8004,Just get them the fuck out already.
8005,"The statistics are everywhere, and so easy to find that it would have been quicker for you to read them than it was to type up your post."
8006,Get better insurance?
8007,This is an asinine reason to not get tested.
8008,I'm pretty sure healthcare workers are also pissed to see how over 70 million supported a guy that actually gave them a hard time rn too.
8009,Honestly it's really sad to see for them to realize a huge amount of people really don't give a fuck about them.
8010,We‚Äôre no longer measuring deaths as individuals and have switched to the 9/11 units.
8011,So we‚Äôre at about two 9/11‚Äôs per week now.

8013,Yeah I‚Äôve been trying
8014,Never apologise for spreading good news here.
8015,I was expecting an answer like professional sumo wrestling but omg
8016,A bill is worse than getting tested so you don't end up infecting others?
8017,This country is so completely fucked.
8018,There is a fucking pandemic going on.
8019,Money should not be the primary concern.
8020,Does anyone know how Joe will enact a lockdown?
8021,I believe he said he didn't think he could enact a face mask requirement.
8022,"Not sure about lockdown, but its unclear how that would work."
8023,"Perhaps he just puts out recommendations, but it still comes down to the states and/or the people."
8024,How about losing those points?
8025,"It'll save you the reminders, but it definitely has other benefits too."
8026,I‚Äôve seen celebrations in liberal cities with people packed together without anyone complaining at all.
8027,I think this is what they mean by ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù
8028,"if stuffs like abestos can cause lung cancer decades late, there's always a risk, but of course Corona virus (even the original one) is considered a weak virus as it needs a high dose of the virus to have severe effects on a healthy person so i a weaker inactivated version would have 0% chance of side effects, on a healthy person."
8029,"but still a 6 months trial, or even 12 months, is still very short."
8030,"there is a reason why countries have to approve it under emergency use, because their policies will not accept vaccines tested in such short periods."
8031,"and yea like cervical cancer vaccine, we will not know whether it has long term effects, since even the manufacturers didn't test it for so long, maybe they have test subjects that they would pay close study for over the decades but with so many variables it'd be hard to trace the cause of illness over the decades, so in short, even if there's long term delayed side effects we will never know, and what we don't know won't hurt us, we will always blame it on something else."

8081,A  popular biden presidency means even better chances for democrats to grab the senate in 2022.

8129,Over by Easter
8130,What you're stating was prior to trump and mostly based on decorum/tradition.
8131,Biden/Harris will use the same tactics except in ways to wrong a right as McConnell has already stated he'll do nothing if he becomes majority leader again.
8132,"Biden can accomplish a lot with the expanded precedence involving presidential orders established by trump, don't let anyone tell you otherwise just because they lost."
8133,He can even put us back into the Paris Agreement without the need for Congress.
8134,He also gets included on national security issue briefings now and controls who stays and goes in the white house.
8135,We've already had Esper retire when Biden announced he'd never be used during transition.
8136,"Basically, Trump is just a lame duck renter forced to watch the new tenants come and go until January."

8562,"You could consider asymptomatic and unreported cases, though that doesn't happen on the daily US figures since.. they aren't detected/reported."
8563,But I do believe they aren't far off.
8564,Maaaaaaaaaybe double?
8565,But even that is still small potatoes in the big picture.
8566,That's from first outbreak to now.
8567,US from time of that first outbreak to now is... let's find a good source here... google?
8568,"sure... yeah, google: 9.89 million."
8569,Woops - 330 million pop.
8570,"Other countries that have handled the pandemic well: Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan."
8571,They all acted quickly and most of them did so because they've been there before and knew what needed to do... act quickly.
8572,Remember SARS?
8573,"Lastly, your link is waaaay back from April 1."
8574,"Sure they may have cremated more bodies, but not by an order of magnitude..."
8575,"Australian  here, can the federal government mandate masks or is that a state issue"
8576,Right.
8577,Because Trump did not have the COVID-19 task force.
8578,"Yeah but the country is practically closed to visitors from certain countries and just difficult for others, they need a vaccine to be able to open things up again."
8579,"You mean like Sturgis and trumpnrallies spread the virus around, But the protests that happened right around the same time had little to no affect?"
8580,I lean conservative and I hope to hell the SC does not get involved with this.
8581,"I Do think this is a perfect election to investigate our crappy election system (for example, a popular voter-tally software mis-assigning votes to Biden is fucking nuts)."
8582,But the SC has bigger fish to fry than sullying its reputation by picking a president.
8583,"That being said, Biden is a horrible, horrible candidate, so I urge people to wait and see what comes out of the legal challenges, if for no other reason, to learn about holes in our election system that might get used against democrats one day"
8584,Manufacturing capability?
8585,"Where would you get the containers, the packaging or the needles and syringes (let alone the vaccine itself) that are needed to deliver the vaccine to a large number of population, who can produce those things faster and better than china?"
8586,&gt;He may not even need that much after the runoff elections in Georgia later this winter.
8587,"I certainly  hope so, Georgia may have voted blue this election but that Perdue v ossoff race will be hotly contested."
8588,"I could see one seat flipping, both would legitamitely be even more surprising than Georgia turning blue this year."
8589,Disdain for trump seemed to cross party lines this year down here but may not be the case for the runoffs
8590,Remember just 9 months ago when we had 18 positive cases in the entire country and they were quarantined at Air Force bases?
8591,"Doesn't ""do no harm"" cover that?"
8592,Lets GOTV in Georgia this January and not have to wait.
8593,So I have to have a scientific background to comment on the matter?
8594,Thank you.
8595,"I have voted for Republicans and Democrats in the past, but this was an election I didn‚Äôt have a second thought voting blue for."
8596,"&gt;In Texas, the surge in new cases in the past week came mainly from Harris, Dallas and El Paso counties, based on a Reuters tally."
8597,"The surge is straining medical facilities, with the city of El Paso converting a convention center into a field hospital."
8598,"&gt;If Texas were a country, it would be the tenth most affected in the world for total COVID-19 cases."
8599,"The state added about 6,800 new cases a day in the past week on average, based on a Reuters tally."
8600,"&gt;Texas, which accounts for over 10% of total U.S. cases, reported the largest number of new cases in the United States last week and was followed by the state of Illinois, which has half as many people."

8665,"There are parts of that argument that resonate but at the same time when a government takes an action like they did while being advised by scientists, it does suggest that there is at least some risk here that they are attempting to mitigate."
8666,It could be that this mutation is still new and we caught it early.

8769,"Figure 5% of confirmed cases need hospitalization, and basically will die without."

8794,I understand and share your outrage at the American farming and esp the cattle practices as well.
8795,But pointing out one does not belittle the other.
8796,The fact is that they do torture these animals in sadistic ways.
8797,"One might argue that the cattle industry is somewhat sadistic in its ways and I would agree, but the degree to which beating dogs in front of each other to maximize anxiety and fear is not any degree that they actually go to in MOST livestock farming facilities."
8798,I understand that there will always be those outside the frame just as I understand that the beating of dogs infrint of one another may be something outside the frame.
8799,"I again reiterate I never said any specific country, I gave you the link to the documentary and hope you will for your own opinion as I think that is vital in this fight against animal cruelty."
8800,I will always share every view that is against the unnecessary pain of all animals and I want to spread that message and anything that can advocate for it.

8855,"But despite major efforts, no one to date has identified the first case of human transmission, or ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù in the COVID-19 pandemic."

8878,"Jesus

Did Cuomo admit to the mistake of shipping COVID-infected patients to nursing homes?"
8879,What a stroke of genius that was.
8880,"It‚Äôs also funny how New York‚Äôs death toll hasn‚Äôt budged for months, while every single other state continues to record fatalities."
8881,"A little strange, isn‚Äôt that?"
8882,The adults are in charge again.
8883,Not having obscene level of health insurance lobbying will do that.
8884,The fact that we not just have private Healthcare but also that the insurance lobby is one of the strongest fundraisers to politicians kind of makes it impossible to broker a deal in the legislature.
8885,Go on Victoria!!
8886,Makes me proud to be an aussie.

8891,"In Singapore, there‚Äôs mandatory masks else be fined."
8892,Social distancing is widely enforced by places too (the place will be fined if legal authorities observe non social distancing in their establishment).
8893,"Honestly, the best way of enforcement is through the public."
8894,"Slap on some decent sized fines on bars, schools etc for not observing standard protocol."
8895,See how fast they turn towards enforcing it on their own accord.

Ok but you just did?"
8966,It has.
8967,the bigger they are the harder they fall
8968,Outdoors wearing masks
8969,If they knew the primary purpose was to protect others there would be much less mask wearing among these idiots... Good thing they are too ignorant to get the facts.
8970,Just drove by downtown Dallas tonight.
8971,"Bars are packed (50/50 on mask wearing), indoor restaurants are packed."
8972,"One place had NOBODY  wearing masks indoors, not even the servers."

8975,You mention in the first year.
8976,"Biden can't claim Trump's success in his first year, as Trump left him a decimated economy."
8977,If things turn around it will be the Biden govt that does it (I don't think they will tbf).
8978,Trump's followers will claim he is claiming achievements that aren't his even if reality says otherwise.

‚ÄûThe virus simply has some really good PR‚Äû

8989,Imagine justifying what we saw today in cities across the country when these same people were 'afraid' to vote in person this past Tuesday.
8990,So disrespectful to those that have died of this virus.
8991,"I‚Äôm literally in a phase 3 trial, I know what it means."
8992,Phase 3 is for safety and efficacy.

8994,No vaccine has.
8995,They weren't wild before?
8996,I agree with what others have said..but would add that some things can be accomplished with executive orders without congressional approval.
8997,I'm sorry but no.
8998,This is all stuff that can be fixed when the pandemic is over.
8999,This is NOT the time to worry about money or how you are going to pay for medical treatment.
9000,None of this matters if you are dead and it certainly won't bring back your loved ones that you likely killed yourself not to mention the hundreds of other people you end up infecting simply because you don't want to get a bill in the mail a few months later.
9001,I'm done.
9002,I have given up on this country.
9003,There is no coming back from this constant incessant need to never ever have the slightest inconvenience or the smallest discomfort even if means the death and suffering of others.
9004,"Free daycare, paychecks, the ability to gather in large groups and all of this other bullshit is somehow more important than actual fucking human lives."
9005,At this point I have to wonder if maybe the US is getting exactly what it deserves for decades of sociopathic behavior and self absorption.
9006,Maybe it has to take the deaths of millions in order for you people to understand not everything is about you.

9025,"This, I find the street parties across the country right now to be deeply irresponsible and quite a bit ironic."
9026,We've got tens of thousands of people out in the streets yelling into each others' faces about how amazing it will be to have a president who takes coronavirus seriously instead if ignoring it and downplaying it like a moron.
9027,"I realize there are some other reasons for the celebrations as well, but coronavirus was definitely the defining issue of this election."
9028,That is just DRIPPING with irony.
9029,And virus particles.
9030,"The only saving grace I'm hoping for here is at least this will hopefully just be one night, or just this weekend at the most, and then everyone will settle the fuck down and stop being part of the problem they just fucking voted to solve."

9037,You do you.
9038,Maybe it's time we close the schools now.
9039,Not necessarily.
9040,If spread is hitting one person in every X households and then you go in to a lock down setting... suddenly you end up with high transmission rates within households and full households that get sick around the same time.
9041,"Another option is if you live in an apartment building with inadequate circulation, air filtration, etc."
9042,Then it could spread more effectively amongst tenant.
9043,"Also, colder weather means more time spent inside getting a coffee and a Big Mac."

9056,"As far as I understand it it's the RNA spikes that are different, which could make a vaccine developed for the normal strain less effective or even useless against Cluster-5"
9057,Thanks!
9058,This kind of information needs to be made clear!
9059,I've noticed when trying to discuss things with people they usually have the impression it's a all or nothing thing.
9060,As if one virus and  your done so why even try to avoid it.
9061,If masks aren't 100% then they are useless.
9062,But once I explain it's about how much we get exposed to and how it can correlate to how severe our symptoms might be if any at all then it seems to click and they see a reason to start wearing a masks.
9063,I believe this is a critical point that needs more messaging!
9064,"Yes I know, but what i meant is that 700 cases in the UK was the minimum when Victoria was at his peak."
9065,Even adjusting for population it would not be classified as a bad outbreak right now.
9066,"Oh, of course you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot sure‚Äù."
9067,"""Hey, Siri."
9068,Is fuckface...
9069,"I mean McConnell dead?"""
9070,There's also a possibility that masks are making it worse.
9071,There is equal evidence for both hypotheses - none.
9072,The Don's gonna be smuggled out of the country in a casket!
9073,What about New York?
9074,Why did they stop counting?
9075,If your people refuse to be cooperative then really there is only one thing left that your government can do to realistically halt this virus.
9076,But they won't ever do it lol.
9077,Freedumb apparently isnt just a disease unique to the US.
9078,"Sigh.... South Korea and co can do it, but not you."
9079,mlive isn't exactly impartial.
9080,Can you link peer reviewed articles?
9081,It is a metaphor.
9082,It means that there's hope for a better near future
9083,There is a lot we don't know about this virus and stuff like the mink farms is fucking scary but I do feel a little better knowing the adults are coming back into the room and they can help us actually deal with this shit.
9084,Trump's people couldn't even book the right Four Seasons.
9085,No wonder why we're such a mess right now.
9086,Totally agree.
9087,"But also, how fucked is it that the safety of others isn't a motivation for them?"
9088,The family members pay the price i guess.
9089,"It did, 12 people is infected with the new strain"
9090,Too strategic a game for them.
9091,I‚Äôm not saying for one minute that he did an exemplary job of handling the virus....he didn‚Äôt.
9092,"But you must recall that in the beginning Fauci himself said that we shouldn‚Äôt be too worried about this virus, and the WHO recommended NOT to wear masks....so there‚Äôs that"
9093,"I know plenty of conservatives who are nice and willing to lend a helping hand or buy you a drink, but so many of them uniformly believe it's a hoax because that's the party line :/"
9094,Are republicans that naive that they dont see the gop trying to do that?
9095,Not sure about the nursing home thing.
9096,But it‚Äôs funny how he became the scapegoat for everyone to blame for how he dealt with a worldwide pandemic in a city that has one of the highest population density in the world.
9097,"Not even the WHO was prepared for this, how do you expect a politician to be?"
9098,"Also, the fact that NY doesn‚Äôt have that many deaths may be because of the fact that they don‚Äôt have a lot of daily cases compared to the rest of the states."
9099,"They weren't celebrating, they were protesting the fact that Notre Dame didn't lose."
9100,Totally safe!
9101,"Well, if it is triple ply...  That stuff is so nice, it had to substitute for a vacation this year."
9102,That would be AMAZING!!!

9104,Haven't they already done a bunch of dumb things since they went back in the fall.
9105,"They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play anymore games after that, but they‚Äôll keep risking lives for that college football money"
9106,He can reverse all of Trumps executive orders and do plenty of the things the executive branch has been allowed to do over the years but without the senate it‚Äôs hard to get the big items done.
9107,The Senate is still in the air though with the Georgia runoff‚Äôs of two Senate races.
9108,Congrats on the win ND.
9109,Too bad you gave your team COVID and now they have to forfeit a bunch of games.
9110,Good luck with that!
9111,"I would be shocked if Biden can actually make almost any difference at this point, for a number of reasons:

1."
9112,Trump has already totally poisoned this whole situation.
9113,This just IS politicized now.
9114,"I'm not sure it's even possible to put that genie back in the bottle, but if it is, it would take a very long time and a lot of work."
9115,2.
9116,Biden isn't going to try any kind of iron-fisted policy on this.
9117,"Any guidance he attempts to implement is going to require buy-in from the people, and it is distinctly possible that conservatives will be even more resistant to it now that they are all buttmad about the election result."
9118,3.
9119,I would wager that things actually won't be getting any worse by the time January 20 rolls around.
9120,I don't think our healthcare system can sustain through anywhere even close to another 2.5 months of this level of increase.
9121,"I believe that overwhelmed, collapsing hospitals will once again force our hand with regard to local restrictions and shutdowns across the country, long before Jan 20."
9122,"This will work, just like it has every other time it's been done, and metrics will have probably already been improving for some amount of time by the time Biden takes office."
9123,4.
9124,The vaccine will really will be imminent by that time.
9125,"If/when we bring this winter surge under control within the next few months, it should be at least a few months after that before another ""wave"" might start to kick off."
9126,"At that point, we'll have something much better than policy; we'll have multiple vaccines starting to flow out into the population."
9127,This should significantly curb the ability of the virus to actually get into any further periods of exponential spread.
9128,"Hopefully, they left a little space between the $ and the 5 to put in a 1 or a 2."
9129,There's a couple history Channel docs on it
9130,Not to toss a wrench in - the UK is 4 countries which would skew the data further ( I tease! )

9138,Not sure why you'd be downvoted for this.
9139,I agree with you 100% I'd rather them home but am happy with the mask usage.
9140,I think most experts would say it's quite likely we're well over 200k/day.
9141,"It varies a lot depending on how much testing is going on and how badly the spread is going, but in general most people seem to believe that ""true infections"" are somewhere around 5-8x what we catch with testing."
9142,So we could EASILY be a half a million a day right now in reality.
9143,Yeah...

9170,"I don't like Biden for various reasons, but when Trump touted not listening to scientists as  a plus for his re-election, and bragged about getting Dr. Fauci fired, it sealed the deal that I could not vote 3rd party this year."
9171,These are all reasoned arguments.

9176,Rude
9177,It depends on what kind of testing you're talking about.
9178,"If you have an ongoing illness, testing may be appropriate."
9179,"But, if you think you might have had coronavirus in the past, and you're curious, with the insurance situation, an antibody test would be imprudent."
9180,My doctor offered me an antibody test (without recommendation) and I declined.
9181,"In this case, curiosity won't kill the cat, but it might kill your insurability."
9182,But people need to be guided by their experiences.
9183,"I remember my father, serving his monthly health insurance premium by constable, because the insurance company was refusing to cash his checks sent by certified mail to pay his insurance, because with small cell lung cancer, he was a total loss."
9184,He was a real total loss because he didn't die.
9185,They gave up after about 6 months of serving the insurance premium checks.
9186,"No, you haven't walked in my shoes."
9187,"My sentiment on this is, insurability is a concurrent concern, to be taken into account when deciding whether to get a test or not."
9188,Family history is a factor.
9189,Some people have to be concurrently worried about things beside coronavirus.
9190,"I specifically disagree that ""This is all stuff that can be fixed when the pandemic is over""."
9191,"Maybe, maybe not."
9192,I really wish people would get this straight.
9193,"Several months ago some NY politicians/officials started this trend of incorrectly referring to the test positivity metric as ""infection rate""."
9194,And now some news websites do it too.
9195,I don't know why they started doing that.
9196,*Surely* the public health officials know better.
9197,They aren't closing their borders though.
9198,So basically this will get out into the rest of the world just like it got out of China.
9199,2
9200,By numbers about 1 in 30 Oklahomans have tested positive.
9201,"Due to the nature of the disease cases are likely to cluster, there will be a lot in one area and less in others."

9248,I said the first year is something that a president takes credit for that doesn‚Äôt really belong to them.
9249,Any economic upturn in trumps first year wasn‚Äôt a result of anything he actually did.
9250,"The economy kind of flows on its own, doesn‚Äôt really matter who is president, but the office can change the peaks and valleys to a certain extent."
9251,"But let‚Äôs be fair, trump did not leave Biden a decimated economy, coronavirus did."
9252,"Now we can argue about where the economy would be if someone else was in power, but it‚Äôs beside the point."
9253,There would have been very little difference in the economy either way.
9254,"If the economy really recovers in the next six months to a year, and it‚Äôs on its way, it‚Äôs not necessarily Biden‚Äôs doing."
9255,"He can make some things better, some things we worse, but in the end, the economy (barring a shutdown) is recovering."
9256,"Biden isn‚Äôt responsible for it, and really neither is trump."
9257,"The economy is on a cycle, and was poised to boom, trumps policies helped speed up the cycle, but it would have happened anyway."

9276,"We're at \~90% mask compliance since March, and though everyone knows the numbers here are a lie (there is no effort at widespread testing, and if people have mild or no symptoms, then they don't bother taking time off work to go get tested) it's possible that the mask compliance has lead to lower viral loads, so people are mostly just getting mild cases and ignoring it and going about business as usual."

9326,"Also regarding anti vaxx, its like saying high powered telecommunication discs or high tension power cables at close human proximity for prolonged period of time does not have any adverse effects on human health."
9327,"This is backed by scientifical studies that there is simply ""No evidence"" showing it is true thus highly ""Unlikely""."
9328,I wont say vaccines are a health hazard to general public long term but i cant deny that theres a chance they actually do simply because there is no evidence.
9329,"The world ""No evidence"" and ""unlikely"" has been used way too often by professionals during the early stage of covid19 and guess what things are starting to show the ""likely hood"", we used to say transmission of covid from humans to animals and animals back to human is "" unlikely"", but guess what?"
9330,"Folks need to know the word ""unlikely"" doesn't mean impossible and is usually used in hope people will actually think it is impossible."

9334,"Sometimes it takes 10 years to approve vaccines, it is to try their best to ensure there is really no long term side effects."
9335,"But as for Sinopharm, i would say it is more reliable and doesnt require such long period of testing due to the emergency and also the fact the vaccine was created at ground zero by their Wuhan biological lab branch so they have the perfect test environment for the vaccine."

9345,I remember my jaw dropping when he said that lol.
9346,The funny thing is the US still venerates him like an infallible saint.
9347,So yesterday we had the highest number of new infections in my country.
9348,"There basically is a lockdown except for kindergartens and elementary schools, which not only do children attend regularly, they DON'T WEAR MASKS."
9349,"Isn't this ridiculous, and the reason there's a spike in new infections?"
9350,The official explanation is that 'WHO says children under 12 should not be required to wear masks'.
9351,Yesterday there even was a press conference in which they presented data from other countries saying that children this age don't transmit the virus easily.
9352,But this seems bullshit.
9353,"They inhale and exhale, how can they not transmit the virus?"
9354,"And what is it with Western countries insisting to follow WHO's suggestions, when WHO used to insist that the virus isn't airborne, that we shouldn't be wearing masks etc?"
9355,"How come the children in East Asia wear masks from a young age, but in the West they won't?"
9356,"I don't know if I'm overacting on this, but it's the only explanation for the huge increase in numbers."
9357,"When the schools closed down last March, the numbers went to zero."
9358,"After they opened this school year, the numbers just go up."
9359,And yet they insist 'children do not have to wear masks'.
9360,And they don't.
9361,"Come on, baby, let's hope this thing is works successfully!"
9362,Like trump had a plan.
9363,He‚Äôs had 11 months to contain this and he hasn‚Äôt done a thing.
9364,The worst thing that could happen to a kid in poverty is for one of their (or only) guardians to die from something they bring back home.
9365,Even if they don't die and it just causes hospitalization...is their financial outlook going to look better with tens of thousands of medical debt?
9366,There are other ways we can address these things.
9367,Keeping schools open does more harm than good.
9368,It's a driver for this pandemic.
9369,That's just the way it is.
9370,I believe it's called a cluster fuck
9371,Weird that this gets posted but not the countless videos about the celebrations around the country breaking social distancing or CNN reporters crowd surfing in Atlanta
9372,1/28 that we know of.
9373,Shit tons of folks will be fully asymptomatic or so mildly symptomatic that they wont get tested.
9374,Nah man.
9375,Don't justify it because of partisan bullshit.
9376,These people need to stop celebrating in huge groups.
9377,I'm in El Paso.
9378,"The real numbers here arent reported because the military (Ft. Bliss) one of the largest bases in the country, is ordered to keep their numbers secret."
9379,And we're seamless...lots of people in El Paso work on post.
9380,Man America is fucked no matter how you look at it.
9381,Texas is not doing well.
9382,Nobody seems to care that we‚Äôre in a pandemic anymore.
9383,I was watching commercials during that game too and most of them were about people having other people over to watch TV together.
9384,If the commercials themselves are pushing the narrative of pre-pandemic life then we‚Äôre screwed.
9385,"And today was a a Saturday, when cases tend to be under-reported."
9386,They also got totally slammed early in the pandemic so they have higher seroprevalence thus leading to more mild surges later on compared to say the US Midwest which never really got hit hard until now.
9387,Trump called it 6 months ago.
9388,We'll have a vaccine before the end of the year.

9528,Things are getting worse there and many other places that were largely previously spared (god help North Dakota).
9529,"I worry that that's the reality we face this winter, and that the death rate will climb."
9530,That lower death rate didn't happen by magic - it happened by Herculean efforts of healthcare providers everywhere.
9531,Their efforts and manpower are not an unlimited resource.
9532,I hope he has Dr. Fauci included in the task force.
9533,"guy from 2021 here, remember those good old days when we only had 100k cases"
9534,Most people will not as long as they can get away with it.
9535,Fear of COVID is gone entirely by now.
9536,"I sure hope that you are vegan, otherwise thats quite an hypocrite thing to say."
9537,"Well, it's probably better economically here, I have to say that."
9538,"And schools are open in a lot of places, in-person, so parents can work."
9539,But the no masks and no restrictions whatsoever sucks.
9540,"Like, schools don't require masks."
9541,Not even changing classes in the hallways.
9542,That's dumb.
9543,1 in 28 of us have had it.
9544,I don't think I have and my family hasn't either.
9545,So either we're being diligent or asymptomatic.
9546,You are under no obligation to talk to contact tracers.
9547,"If a friend of mine found out he was infectious and told a contact tracer instead of just telling me direct, I'd be pissed."
9548,Yes lol
9549,Someone forgot to tell the anti facists to turn off the coronavirus.
9550,"Trump lost, so we don't need it anymore."

9559,"Because in the US, we‚Äôre probably racking up 1M/ day at this point."
9560,The WHO and CDC have consistently used the 10x formula to try and estimate total cases compared to total lab confirmed cases.
9561,"Well it was working but then people started partying... Canadian Thanksgiving, Halloween.. and there were massive Indian Weddings."
9562,They were allowing gatherings of up to 6 people.
9563,"But because they weren't fining people, there was no incentive to follow the rules."
9564,"Is this in all regions, or just in the north like last time?"
9565,"Do you honestly  believe that the blm protest  would have no effect while any other (Sturgis, Trump rally) type of gathering would have an effect?"

9572,"Biden doesn't have the authority to lockdown anyone, so it's a moot point."
9573,"&gt; Grocery stores can surely do the same, given time and incentive."
9574,Exactly.
9575,We (Americans) aren't willing to completely change our way of lives to potentially save some.
9576,Tried it and it's helped damn near none.
9577,Most of California has been locked down for quite some time and it hasn't helped a ton relative to states that have not.
9578,Locking down further won't be tolerated.
9579,Mask mandates are the best bet.
9580,"We've already been at it for so long, it's time to move past - especially since the death rate is so ridiculously low directly from COVID."
9581,"The excess death figures for the US are slightly inflated, around a couple thousand a month."
9582,That is not a reason to shut anything down.
9583,Data if you don't believe me for some crazy reason - https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid
9584,And yet other countries are on their 2nd and 3rd waves whereas the US never ended its first wave.
9585,There are plenty of talented people who don‚Äôt get accepted based on the weird admission system.
9586,The limit set by the AMA is well known.
9587,They lobby hard to keep it in place.

9591,"Actually, Brazil is now doing great."
9592,Have you seen how sharp their deaths are falling?
9593,And that's happening despite zero lockdowns in place.
9594,?
9595,"Texas is currently at nearly 19,000 deaths."
9596,"New York is at 33,000."
9597,Texas already has 60% of New York‚Äôs deaths.
9598,"The problem is, Texas has had a steady rate of deaths ever since the first wave of around 150 a day."
9599,"New York started at pretty much the highest rate of any state, but is now seeing less than 50 a day."
9600,With only 7 recorded yesterday.
9601,This makes it obvious that Texas clearly has the potential to outpace New York in deaths as long as NY‚Äôs plan continues to pay off.
9602,"If things get worse this winter, and each governor continues their way of responses Texas I guarantee will have more deaths than NY by 2021."

9644,"We should NOT accept just a $1200 stimulus at this point either, do not hold that to be the only standard"
9645,Re: epidemic?
9646,A lot.
9647,There is already legislation that gives large emergency power to the president for such situations.
9648,Someone's never been to Texas nor met anyone from Texas.
9649,"We certainly helped spread some of the insanity, although Europe‚Äôs second wave is entirely of their own stupidity as they cake so close to victory this summer."
9650,The bar is set so low by Trump that by acknowledging doctors and scientists we are making a huge leap forward
9651,Saw the most toilet paper I'd ever seen in Target the other week.
9652,I'm good till summer.
9653,"You could see it that way, or you could see it as he didnt want to put the US more into debt just in case biden won."
9654,Democrats and first term presidents in general have a history of spending rather than saving.
9655,"Also he never said he would give us any stimulus after the election either, the economy has rebounded better than expected and hes pretty much shown that he has no care for the individual so its wierd to think he‚Äôd give individuals anymore money imo."
9656,"Businesses got 3 stimulus loans vs the 1 $1200 stimulus, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd just do the same thing he was doing if he did anything."

And that's exactly what will keep holding us back

Stores have had way longer than overnight to think about this."
9665,Look at what HEB did at the beginning of the pandemic.
9666,Great example of thinking ahead to the future instead of being stuck in the past.
9667,Schools have been forced to make major changes in literally days.
9668,"Grocery stores can surely do the same, given time and incentive."
9669,I went and researched a bit and this is the [study ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408) usually linked to say there‚Äôs no correlation between protests and an uptick of coronavirus cases.
9670,I haven‚Äôt found any to state otherwise.
9671,I was just curious to know if anyone had found opposing literature.
9672,"Funny, literally every video I see of celebrations include half the crowd with masks off."
9673,The president should have certain powers in emergencies.
9674,"I think he can issue it through the CDC (assuming the CDC have some autonomy and agrees), but hard to enforce at the state level."
9675,"However, that the issuance of masks should make certain companies also requiring masks that don't do so today."
9676,Since potentially someone that got sick because the companies don't follow the order can be sued.
9677,It‚Äôs obvious this mutation is obviously somewhat into circulation by now.
9678,The best chance atm is just to try to identify who has it and see if the strain caused similar/different effects to the host... hopefully no difference at all unless it causes lighter symptoms

9830,Jesus.. seems like all Americans are getting covid in 2021 at this rate.
9831,And yet this sub is filled with news articles proving conservatives refuse to wear masks or social distance whereas this issue does not exist with liberals.
9832,Once you get it you will get treatment and become 20 years younger - that‚Äôs huge !
9833,Nothing material to do with the spread... it was out of control with no way of managing it because testing was completely fucked.

9879,This is quite literally how a sociopath thinks.

9900,"Rallies or protests that are outdoors, with masks use and adequate sanitary measures have little to no effect on rates of coronavirus transmission."

9902,That‚Äôs my belief.
9903,"From a post elsewhere:

&gt; I don't think so."
9904,I think they'll continue the pandemic as an excuse to expand government powers and assert dominance over non-compliers which will be right leaning people.
9905,"Apparently, the whole world is in on promoting the pandemic by, er, doing something I guess, in order to install leftist governments and own the conservatives."

9907,I live in Iowa and it is an utter shit show here.

9909,Obama set alot of precedent that expanded the use of executive orders.

9912,How is this divisive?
9913,This is how marketing works.
9914,I think it would be funny if the right started taking COVID more seriously so they could start finger pointing that Biden needs to fix it as soon as he gets in office and use it as a strike against him.
9915,But I doubt that will happen because at this point they have really staked their claims about COVID
9916,"Okay, just a thought."
9917,"First, I‚Äôm in the South and we had a lot of record days a few months back when it got hot/humid and everyone retreated indoors."
9918,"The North, not so much at that time."
9919,"Now, it‚Äôs getting colder in the North and people are now retreating indoors up there, and record cases are occurring there now too (like 12K in Illinois - wow!)."
9920,"Second, as time goes on, it seems like the virus ‚Äúmutates‚Äù a little bit as we go along and gets less and less deadly but more and more infectious (like 1918 virus that, over time, eventually became the seasonal flu I think)."
9921,"So, is this not just inevitable until the vaccine comes and we can reach heard immunity more artificially than naturally?"
9922,"I know we can do all we can - wear masks, social distance, contract trace, etc."
9923,And maybe I‚Äôm just getting numb to it all now as I am sure others are too.
9924,"But, I‚Äôm just not as surprised as I guess I should be anymore."
9925,And I‚Äôm also not trying to find a group to blame anymore either.
9926,The virus it to blame.
9927,"And given where our country is at this time (in reality we cannot go back and become more like the Asian countries that managed the virus so much better than we did) and as our daily habits change due to changing harsher weather patterns, infections will increase this winter until the vaccine comes - it just feels inevitable at this point."
9928,Or maybe I am just missing something!
9929,Same!
9930,I had an issue with my taxes and filed them too late to get it.

9937,I did noting wrong to be punished and I do not doubt majority of people here in europe or out there over the Pond didnt either.
9938,"And yeah, I want to have absolute and complete control over my life."
9939,Thats normal and OK.
9940,"If you desire others to tell you what to do, thats ok and normal as well, but do you know whats absolutely not OK?"
9941,To demand others to comply with your point of view.
9942,I did not build my life up just to have it torn down and then to hand the control over to some smartass who thinks he knows better than me what I actually want to do.

9951,"I'd like to add, even this example ends up being an overreaction, containing Covid to prevent further interspecies jumps and mutations is incredibly important."

9975,It's right there on their website.
9976,&gt; Throwing in the towel on other mitigation efforts and just telling people to mask up isn't going to fix it.
9977,This is not throwing in the towel.
9978,It's being realistic about the impact of the disease and realizing you can't take the choice of working away from people just because it's a slightly bigger impact than the flu globally.

Review of the Medical Literature
Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., ‚ÄúN95‚Äù) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:

Jacobs, J. L. et al."
10024,"(2009) ‚ÄúUse of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,‚Äù American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 ‚Äì 419. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002

N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches."
10025,Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.
10026,"Cowling, B. et al."
10027,"(2010) ‚ÄúFace masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review,‚Äù Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic- review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05

None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)."

10496,"Why would a ‚Äúnews story‚Äù that you have to doom scroll through a conspiracy subreddit, such as r/coronavirus, not be ‚Äúbigger news‚Äù if what commenters on the conspiracy subreddit say is ‚Äútrue‚Äù?"

10498,"I mean, the totally uneducated and uninformed conspiracy theorists have told you this is a huge news story and it‚Äôs dangerous!!!"

10516,PCR tests may have a much lower threshold but they're also just showing a small window of time.
10517,False negative antigen tests mainly occur for smaller viral loads and scientists believe that these individuals aren't really infectious anymore.
10518,"Here is a larger study, Slovakia was using the test by SD Biosensor:

7 out of 191 false negatives below a CT value of 26,7 is fine considering how much faster AND cheaper these tests are."

10522,Hello Europeans and Americans!
10523,Aussie here...we've had average of less than 10 daily new cases nationwide this week.
10524,We've implemented some tactics to combat the spread of COVID-19.
10525,Hopefully the rest of the world listens because it's been quite successful in Australia (with the exception of our initial and Melbourne 2nd wave outbreaks).
10526,"Here are some ways we've handled COVID-19:

1."
10527,Nationwide implementation of a COVID sign-in system.
10528,"Restaurant patrons here are required to sign in on a piece of paper or through a QR code scanner, which will take them to an online form where they put their details."
10529,2.

10536,"As of right now, Melbourne's had no locally-transmitted new cases in 10 days!!!"
10537,5.
10538,Limiting the amount of visitors anyone can have.

10541,6.
10542,Implementation of mandatory hotel quarantine for plane travellers from overseas.
10543,14 days confined to a room.
10544,Rule breakers will be fined on the spot.
10545,"I understand that Contact Tracers will be quite useless as the virus has already gone rampant in half of Europe and the USA, but our teams of Contact Tracers have done an excellent job."
10546,"So yeah....if Europe and the USA could please follow suit, that would be super helpful!"
10547,And they called me a D

10600,He publicly pleads with the state to follow these regulations and stresses how important it is to take Covid seriously.

10696,"And guess what, when the vaccine starts being issued the number of cases will drop and people we everywhere will be like, ‚Äúsee it wasn‚Äôt that bad we got a vaccine and now everything‚Äôs fine‚Äù after +300k people died..."

10931,Most of our population lives in cities on the coast.
10932,But population density isn‚Äôt a great argument when places like Japan and S. Korea are doing better than the US too.
10933,But the only point I was trying to make is that you don‚Äôt need to test all the time when you implement contact tracing and the community spread is low.
10934,"Our numbers aren‚Äôt low because we‚Äôre not testing, we‚Äôre not testing because our numbers are low."

10945,That foments deep racism and attaches connotations of sociopathy and dirtiness with Chinese people and culture.
10946,That‚Äôs not true and your misguided attempts to prove that are not tricking me.
10947,"As well, I feel like this discussion really ignores animal cruelty that is done on the largest and most systemized way possible: US cattle industry."

10957,"&gt;the protests this summer, largely outside and with masks on, didn't really spike infections, several studies showed this."
10958,You're misconstruing what the data showed.
10959,"Large protests generally didn't lead to overall increases in Covid cases, but the general scientific consensus has been that increased cases among protestors was offset by other people being more likely to stay home."
10960,"They worked out to roughly a net zero effect on spread, but protestors were at a higher risk of contracting Covid than non protestors."
10961,"That's not to say protestors were in the wrong, or that what they were protesting was not worth the risk to them of contracting Covid."
10962,"The reality is being in a large group, even if you are outside and wear a mask, puts you at a higher risk of getting COVID than if you stay at home by yourself."

11309,Protests are going to happen.
11310,That's part of human behavior we need to accept.
11311,As is celebrsting historic events.
11312,"I dont like it, but at the very least- strong mask usage should always be encouraged."
11313,The alternative wouldve been a Trump victory with way less mask usage.
11314,Be grateful the side that encourages mask usage won.
11315,This plus colleges/schools opening up again in almost every state is a recipe for disaster(unless of course they fudge the numbers).
11316,"There is a higher cost to human life than ""getting dead""?"
11317,There is a fundamental moral underpinning that is different.
11318,"I watch out for me, and you for you vs we take care of each other."
11319,"You‚Äôre probably in the ‚Äútake care of each other‚Äù, camp, so the ‚ÄúI for me and you for you‚Äù seems morally abhorrent."
11320,But neither is inherently ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.
11321,"For every good thing that comes from expecting that we watching out for each other, there are bad things too."
11322,"If you‚Äôve ever dumped time/effort/money into someone who just would not help themselves, you‚Äôd get that."
11323,"And even more interesting, is trying to desperately ‚Äúhelp‚Äù someone, only to realise that not only did they not want to be ‚Äúhelped‚Äù, but actually, it was no help at all, and they were perfectly fine on their own."
11324,Maybe an a good example is various religions trying to force beliefs on other people.
11325,"Think of it - if you truly believed in heaven and hell, and that following your religious practices was the only way to get int heaven and to avoid hell- then it would be insanely immoral not to convert people."
11326,"Like, if you knew my sandwich was poisonous, you‚Äôd not allow me to eat it."
11327,"And if I was eating a sandwich that was poisonous and telling other people that it‚Äôs great and it‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôd stop me right?"
11328,You‚Äôd want government rules to literally say it‚Äôs illegal.
11329,But that‚Äôs where things like gay conversion therapy come from.
11330,Or forced religious conversions and lots of things.
11331,"If we don‚Äôt agree on whether a sandwich is poisonous or not, then that doesn‚Äôt work at all."
11332,"Instead if we say, ‚Äúyou do you, I‚Äôll do me‚Äù, we can all get along."
11333,"Yeah some people will die from poison sandwiches, but that‚Äôs better than dying from conflict over whether or not you should eat sandwiches."
11334,"And for the vast majority of times, people make better decisions for themselves knowing their own circumstances than external parties make for them."
11335,"Even if you think that your way of life is better than other people‚Äôs way if life, forcing it upon them is a bad idea."
11336,"So underpinning all of that is a strong wisdom - you live your life, I‚Äôll live mine."
11337,"I won‚Äôt force my values on you and you don‚Äôt force anything on me, and we‚Äôll all get along."
11338,I personally am in the help each other out camp.
11339,"I believe no man is an island, and that if a person allows bad things to happen to them, that it naturally effects those around them (e.g."
11340,"if I get sick, I become contagious, so I have a responsibility to others to not get sick)."
11341,But there is definitely a balance.
11342,Sometimes you gotta let people destroy themselves.
11343,And on some level we have to take care of ourselves and not others sometimes too.
11344,"Knowing that, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inherently bad that framing mask wearing as a personal protection thing is bad."
11345,You all can say no to whatever holiday plans the extended family makes.
11346,"The others may get together, but you have control over what you do."
11347,"Everything I'm reading seems to base it on three things:

1 - How effective will the vaccines be - right now they only need to pass with 50% efficacy, we don't know what the actual numbers are."
11348,"If it's in the 90% efficacy, that's way more effective than barely passing so we get back to life quicker."
11349,"2 - How long will it take to distribute to a majority of the population - The longer it takes, the longer we'll see restrictions."
11350,The goal is to achieve herd immunity via vaccine so we need to get it to a majority.
11351,"The intial vaccines are meant to keep medical workers and high risk people safer, not necessarily reopen the world."
11352,3 - How many people will actually take it?
11353,The US population seems a bit torn at the moment.
11354,I believe more people will come around to it at some point but I think it'll be based on how the first group reacts to the vaccine.
11355,"I'm hoping come the March / April timeframe, we're seeing large downturns in the virus, more vaccines being deployed and restrictions being eased to where most US roadmaps put at the final stage or so to pre-pandemic."
11356,That gives it a chance by Summer to actually hit potential herd immunity if the tope 3 questions are answered positively.
11357,I do think we end up seeing masks being highly encouraged for a long time though.
11358,Congrats Texas
11359,Hilarious.
11360,"Great news, everybody!"
11361,The USA is #1 at something other than prisoners per capita again.
11362,are there countries where the ppl take the virus seriously?
11363,"i mean if a mask is suggested, no one will wear one."
11364,That is a German trait.
11365,"GPs will also tell you that there is nothing that can be done about a wide range of infections, and you should just get some rest."
11366,Attitudes in other countries are noticeably different.
11367,"(Not that you can do much substantial about many diseases, but you can at least treat the symptoms.)"
11368,"""I hate that orange moron""

Classy."
11369,I have a newborn too.
11370,"Thankfully people in my family are mostly staying at home or work, but I‚Äôm not taking any chances with such a young baby."
11371,We‚Äôll celebrate at home.
11372,They would have a field day at many VA facilities
11373,That stadium became a human Petri dish of infections.
11374,Nah.
11375,We just saw your stupid comments about how no one on the planet has controlled Mother Nature and made judgments based on that.
11376,Because we have a ton of idiots here.
11377,The Lt.
11378,Governor is just as shitty too.
11379,He went on Fox News back in March and said the elderly were willing to die of COVID to save the economy.
11380,Further proof that the ‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù crowd are full of fuckin shit.
11381,guy from 2024 remember when we thought snorting basil pesto would help against covid?
11382,Just more political pandering that will cost millions of dollars and have zero impact.
11383,"Well, that‚Äôs wrong actually, the economy will shut down for round three and you will see 25% unemployment."

11391,Texas coming in strong for the first wave...
11392,Is this /r/politics or what
11393,Even more so since he has pretty much lost the election...
11394,He doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.
11395,"Absent a lockdown COVID is going to crush the UK's health system flat, causing very large numbers of unnecessary deaths."
11396,Like six figures worth.
11397,Would that really be enough?
11398,There are some countries where mask compliance is high and the virus still spreads quite effectively.
11399,We dismiss that theory without evidence around here.
11400,"If you don't let foreign investigators in and conceal the circumstances, enough westerners come to your defense anyway it seems."

11402,"Please do, I live in south Florida and tested positive the day Biden won."
11403,These testing spots need to be open longer and have supply‚Äôs available.
11404,I had to go crack of dawn in order to get a rapid test.
11405,Most of these testing spots are 9-5 and closed on weekends.
11406,Wtf.
11407,We need extended hours 7 days a week and a boat load of rapid tests.
11408,It would be weird if it wouldn't help eh?
11409,We're talking surgical masks here and cloth bulshit masks that general population wears.
11410,I live in EU.
11411,They are mandatory now in my state even for outside use.
11412,Most of the countries around here that took this measure back in the summer experienced no benefit from it.
11413,Graphs clearly show this.
11414,"The population just don‚Äôt care, and the government isn‚Äôt policing anything

Source: in France"
11415,You know exactly what it is.
11416,"We must be doing something wrong in Austria compared to Germany, Netherlands and even Spain (!)."
11417,"Two weeks ago we were well under all of them (except Germany), and then we shot through the roof."
11418,"Yet, I don't see big differences in the official measures applied."

Of course I must be one of the few that do not step out of home unless running out of food, so I cannot tell what in practice is going on in the cities."
11420,I'd like to piggy back on this - the Transition was required \*by law\* before the election was even over.
11421,"There's a book, ""The Fifth Risk"" by Michael Lewis all about the Obama-Trump transition -- or very specifically, *the lack of a Trump transition."
11422,"*

Before the election when he was required by law to set up the transition team, Trump didn't want to do it - even going so far as to say that Chris Christie (heading up the team) was ""stealing money from him."""
11423,"(This is likely a combination of ""he didn't know why he had to"" and ""he didn't expect to win anyway."")"
11424,"He was only convinced when Steve Bannon sat him down and said that if he didn't have a transition team, ""Morning Joe"" would say it's because Trump doesn't believe he can win."
11425,"During the transition, Trump sent... nobody."
11426,Nobody at all.
11427,Other cases were people wholly unqualified.
11428,"In short, Donald Trump started sabotaging the gears of government from day one."
11429,Oh sorry I am not gonna happily surrender my freedom and joyfully let others to punish me with homejail for committing no crime at all.
11430,I guess I am just not the submissive type.
11431,yea i didn't read it sorry
11432,This.
11433,"Of course, masks immensely help but given how contagious this virus is, social distancing is also necessary as masks are not 100% effective"
11434,I‚Äôm in Austin &amp; it doesn‚Äôt help that my hospital &amp; it‚Äôs facilities aren‚Äôt having their healthcare workers isolate when they either become exposed to COVID via their family or to a patient without proper PPE.

11440,"Proof of vaccination will almost certainly be required by many countries for international travelers, it will be especially interesting and controversial to see if any countries make it a strong domestic requirement."
11441,I also wonder if those who had a positive Covid test will be granted whatever form of certificate is established.
11442,I don‚Äôt think you read the article.

11470,"So for the US to have an equivalent amount of cases it would be 136,006, which they will probably have any day now (6 November it was 132,541)."
11471,Regardless I don't think comparing a continent to a country (even a very large one) is fair.
11472,No.
11473,"Holy crap, does your mom even care about you?"
11474,"That‚Äôs so selfish, I‚Äôm so sorry you have to live with that."

Killing 17million animals surely contradicts these CDC claims."

11497,Im hoping for international travel to ve possible.
11498,Heck even reducing isolation time to 3 days with proof of vaccination and a negative PCR test would at least allow my kids to see their grandparents.
11499,2 weeks of mandatory isolation on both ends of an international visit is impossible to schedule for 99.9% of people
11500,True.
11501,"Which is why, and for many other reasons-I can‚Äôt wait to get outta here."
11502,"In Germany, we had R &lt; 1.5 this autumn with minimal to no restrictions."
11503,We don't need much to get below 1.
11504,Contact quarantine can be combined with mass testing.
11505,"Also, yesterday's results are the steepest reduction in prevalence I have seen in this pandemic."
11506,"I remember right before the Iraq War started, when the weapons inspectors had said that there definitely weren't weapons of mass destruction, when it was clear that there simply wasn't any coherent plan for the war at all, when Saddam was attempting to negotiate a surrender and Bush wouldn't even discuss it."
11507,Some 70% of Americans thought that this was a jolly good idea.

11510,I don't think he ever started to merritt saying he gave up.
11511,It seems he was encouraging the spread of the pandemic and still is.
11512,For starters the experts said nothing of the sort.
11513,They said they don't know what effect the mutation might have on vaccine development.
11514,Yeah one journalist was criticizing this and celebrating the Biden celebrations at the same time.
11515,This is why people have stopped taking it seriously.
11516,Probably bat -&gt; intermediate animal -&gt; human
11517,The other thing that annoys me- as a person who has went to several football games that have mandated social distancing this year- is that none of the fans seem to  even be social distancing and a few are without masks
11518,Thankful he won for the simple reason that at least our cities aren‚Äôt burning this week.
11519,"The people of Mexico, Bulgaria and the Ukraine haven't interfered and manipulated in dozens of foreign conflicts and grandstanded for decades about how they are the greatest country on earth, so that's definitely part of it."
11520,"Also, a lot of what has happened in the United States in the last decade is pretty fuckin stupid and indicates that a lot of Americans are pretty fuckin stupid."
11521,A fat orange baby rises
11522,There's no way to release the information to Americans without releasing it to America's enemies.
11523,It‚Äôs called sarcasm.

Just pointing out that if your tired of the election topic then you shouldn‚Äôt bring it up."
11526,What ‚Äúwinning‚Äù looks like to the guy who just lost the presidency.
11527,Yea that‚Äôs why you see mass/ny/nj with the highest Covid death rates!
11528,"Oh wait we only care about cases here, death rates aren‚Äôt important unless we talk about a country"
11529,"Not a great idea, but as long as they were typically wearing masks outside of this environment, it shouldn‚Äôt be too big of a deal."
11530,"Masked up, outside, short duration."
11531,I‚Äôd be more concerned about their drinking beer while grabbing concessions than I am about this.

11552,"So even if Faucci had free reign at a federal level, it still wouldn‚Äôt really help."
11553,"There isn‚Äôt a single cohesive response to the pandemic, there‚Äôs 50+ responses."
11554,"Each state has their own, sometimes contradictory, response."
11555,What could help is a single unified response.
11556,"Then, beyond face masks and social distancing, the US could do things like circuit breaker lockdowns."

11568,"Release

Don't tell"
11569,Yea we are fucked.
11570,And everyone of us here knew back in March this would happen.
11571,It's higher than that.
11572,It's about 4% according to worldometers.
11573,"243,290 deaths / 6,442,276 closed cases = 4%."
11574,"If instead, you use excess deaths, it's even worse:

299,028  excess deaths by October 2nd / 6,442,276 closed cases = 4.6%"

12193,They are not the ones super spreading at the moment.
12194,But what's going to happen between now and inauguration?
12195,If we keep averaging 100k a day that's 9-10 million new cases by the time Trump is replaced.
12196,the senate still has to count the electoral college votes.
12197,"Herd immunity actually works quite well even at lower percentages, depends how high the reproductive number R is normally, to squeze it under 1 using vaccines."
12198,"If R was 2, 50% herd immunity stops the spread (edit: not spread per say but increase in current cases)."
12199,"But since covid has R anywhere between 2 and 4, depending how dense the population is and how many social contacts everyone has per day (super dense cities like New York or some big asian cities may go well beyond, even 8 was estimated in some mass spread areas and prisons)."
12200,That means anywhere from 50-80% herd immunity will stop the spread.
12201,"This however means that if we want to return to normal prepandemic life, majority of people have to get vaccinated, and that could be a problem."
12202,"I think we would be lucky if majority of seniors and vulnerable people accepted the vaccine, so that at least we free hospitalization pressure."
12203,"But covid is going to be here for years, if not forever..."

12252,Apparently the BLM protests have not led to Covid spikes.
12253,"If that‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt see why those celebrating in the streets with masks on would."
12254,I'm  having trouble buying into this.

You are telling me that people who did not support wearing masks, support getting tested?"
12256,"These people likely do not believe that coronavirus even exists, but if they get sick, they are going to want to know whether it is Coronavirus or not?"
12257,C'mon.

12279,High risk groups in this context is the elderly and citizens with health issues that can lead to further health complications if they got infected.
12280,I get what you mean.

12282,"Even when the trial vaccine has been successfully being clear for safety, there will only be a small number in the beginning, the vaccine needs to be rationed, so there will be some groups who will exclude even if they are essential workers."

12323,"Who are ""you people""?"

12325,In any case mask wearing has worked in a few Asian countries with very different values then Europe and NA.
12326,You may have noted a rise in cases almost everywhere since fall aside from countries like Brazil that didn't have a national lockdown in the spring.
12327,I you think ranting about mask wearing on the internet is going to make the risk of covid go to zero you may be ranting for a while.
12328,It is a respiratory illness and is now part of life.
12329,We need to make data based decisions that take into account people's actual behaviors instead of reading anecdotes about tragic but extremely rare deaths.

12349,It depends.

‚ÄúThe reason NY has such a large number of deaths has very little to do with NY policy.‚Äù

Ummmm what?!"
12408,So the reason NY has the most amount of deaths out of any state is because of... oh Trump of course.
12409,"So when Cuomo made a policy to send infected people to nursing homes, that was Trumps fault?"
12410,Did Trump tell him to do that?
12411,No.
12412,Did people think (even at the time) that it was obviously a bad idea?
12413,Yes.
12414,There is no comfort in anything with Covid.
12415,And the reason the deaths were so bad in March/April was because there were 0 treatments.
12416,But I guess Cuomo had something against nursing homes.

12418,Please elaborate.

12463,Even people who were so diligent for months are starting to be lackadaisical with precautions.
12464,My Pov.
12465,First : this last summer was a total failure.
12466,Our nice president ask us to go in vaccation for the economy to restart.
12467,I usually spend summer hollidays in th√© Pyr√©n√©es mountain.
12468,"What happened... Thousands if people in th√© mountain, no social distancing, mass tourism everywhere."
12469,Second: on the 28th of August our nice technocrats elite decided to review how to classify the most fragile people if out society.
12470,"From that date only people +65 year old with comorbidity aspects where considered ""people to protect""."
12471,I've a cardiologic pathology and they ask me to go back to work at that Time...
12472,The goal of our president is no  collapse of economy.
12473,( Like maybe Trump).
12474,That's why France is (like Usa) in deep trouble.
12475,That 100 grand was from your statistics about young people.
12476,Make up your mind what your statistics is about.
12477,"I wonder where it's from, to be so malleable?"
12478,Very suspicious.
12479,100 grand is more than the median (around 62.5k).
12480,"If the average dying has more than that, I wonder if it supports your position that the poor and the rich dies at equal rate?"
12481,Or is it that the 100 grand is a number taken from your ass?
12482,Yes.
12483,"Our numbers are the worst per capita, but Europe is still out of control in most nations."
12484,"It will plateau at some point, because in many places people are still being responsible."
12485,"That said, it‚Äôs still going to be bad."
12486,"""At least Trump got things done."
12487,"Maybe we need another Republican president."""
12488,Is that the guy that got called off-field and got a positive test and then immediately went back out and removed his mask and hugged his teammates?

12493,Also you just rewrote it lol
12494,He can still appoint heads of departments.
12495,So for example.
12496,Instead of having a Bog Pharma Exec running the Health Dept.
12497,We can get an actual scientist or healthcare expert.
12498,And instead of getting a billionaire private school baby heading our Education Dept.
12499,We can get an actual educator.
12500,Small things like that will make a huge difference.
12501,I went out with the family for the first time in months and had a sunday session.
12502,The pay-off has arrived for the hard-work that everyone (well almost everyone) put in over the past few months.
12503,But Democratic demonstrations don't spread covid.
12504,That's science.
12505,Arlington just HAD to host the world series and show off their new stadium.
12506,Probably will have ended up killing more people than in the Colosseum.
12507,"Thats going to be positive all over the place, doesnt even have to be related to trump."
12508,You can do the same in toilets of every seat of government nearly worldwide and most wipes would come back positive.
12509,I know for a fact they did that in germany and found cocaine literally everywhere.
12510,"How is the process of contact tracing, testing, and isolation in Australia?"

12520,"How are you gonna vote for the candidate who said he‚Äôd tackle covid, yet you‚Äôre doing the very thing that spread covid"
12521,In this case the posts in question are talking about the H1N1 strain of the Influenza virus.
12522,We were also specifically discussing the impacts of medicine circa 1918 and 2009 comparatively.

12527,How the hell could he control people celebrating across the nation in large groups?
12528,That makes no sense.
12529,All these people KNOW social distancing is necessary and him saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate in large groups once I win‚Äù literally wouldn‚Äôt have changed a thing.
12530,"If you look at things that he CAN control, like his rallies, then you will see that YES he did lead by example."
12531,Did president-elect mentioned in his speech?
12532,"Getting rid of trump is the only way we are going to get rid of the virus, smh"
12533,Hah!
12534,Yeah.
12535,For the most part.
12536,"People do care about society as a whole, if not people on an individual level."
12537,I'm kind of surprised we didn't all come together as a nation and lock down hard.
12538,"Then again, I'm also not surprised at all; the gov't here basically said, ""Well, you should maybe possibly stay home if it's not too much trouble, so sorry to ask, but we can't make you anyway, sooooo..."" \*shrugs\*  Funny how they can make us do other stuff, like pay taxes, though."
12539,"lol

Basically, they want to keep the appearance that we don't have COVID, or that we have it at ""manageable levels"" (which we don't, and any hospital worker could tell you that) so that we can preserve the Olympics for next summer, and tourism in general."
12540,"They did the same thing with SARS about 10 years ago; massive cover-ups and lies from ""official"" sources."
12541,Everyone else just smiled and nodded and went along with it.
12542,"Excited for what, is what I dont get."
12543,We still have to get to jan 20 then we get a little better chance at survival.
12544,People are still selfish no matter the political side.

12580,I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm not a scientist but I think that would show each state/county in a better light.
12581,Someone please tell me why I could be wrong?
12582,The thing about a novel virus is that the many ways it can mutate are less predictable.
12583,"Flu vaccines are made partly on predicting what strains are likely to become the yearly variant, but Coronavirus might have many unpredictable aspects that make such an approach a lot harder."
12584,America first!
12585,So how can he say ‚Äúon Monday‚Äù?
12586,But he‚Äôs not in office until Jan
12587,Exactly!
12588,It's so bizarre.
12589,By seeing what they did is easy to believe that they did it in purpose.
12590,Either that or they genuinely believe that herd immunity will miraculously work.
12591,"Honestly, as much as I may hate seeing these celebrations, a part of me sees the need for them in an entirely illogical way."
12592,I live with my parents who are pro-Trump.
12593,They think rainbows shine out of his ass and that Democrats will burn the country to the ground because of the D next to their name.
12594,I've spent the past few days during dinner listening to them raging about how Democrats stole the election and how there was no way that Biden could have won the election.
12595,Their reasoning?
12596,"""Look at the size of the Trump rallies!"
12597,Look how many people there are.
12598,Biden's rallies are empty.
12599,Even the democrats don't go to his rallies.
12600,"There's no one who likes Biden so there's no way he could have won the election!"""
12601,So maybe this will finally open their eyes to the fact that democrats do support Biden.
12602,Or maybe they'll continue to scream about GOP conspiracy theories around the dinner table.
12603,I remember when there were like 2000 total

12607,they found this is Australia with casual workers working at 2 or 3 places .when Melbourne had there big breakout they end saying staff could only work at one places and the government cover the rest of the normal wage
12608,Yeah man I hope the government officials get a judgment for this.
12609,"I have a hard time to believe that France was this incomp√©tent by ignorance, if not then the next logical conclusion could be that they did it in purpose."
12610,Which is why I'm trying as hard as I can to cancel those holiday's in my family.
12611,For the sake of health wouldnt want to expose my older relatives.
12612,&gt; Did it really take people this long to figure that out?
12613,I've known it since 1964 when Goldwater ran for president.
12614,He ran on a policy of hurt.
12615,So you're saying Minks in the US don't get this virus?
12616,You have access to the internet.

12618,Surprised they didn't push them across the border
12619,"Well, now we can all say that ""Everything is bigger in Texas""."
12620,.
12621,And it seems like he is making statements every other day.
12622,"I don't trust the case numbers anywhere, but it's difficult to hide deaths."
12623,I hope you don‚Äôt have it and you‚Äôll be ok
12624,So did you get one ?

12855,It'll be very interesting to see what Biden's task force comes up with.
12856,The approach to this thing could change drastically come Jan.
12857,yeah but according to most redditors only conservative don't socially distance and refuse to wear masks...
12858,You are disputing and your data is dumb.
12859,People went to places close to them to celebrate.
12860,Or to the closest known place where people gather like Times Square or the Barclay Center.
12861,It‚Äôs not going to be representative of the population.
12862,"thing is, the crowds in the cities didn't make the front page of r/all."
12863,"for some reason, reddit decided to shit on the students at ND rather than the people who were celebrating in the streets."
12864,"I agree, the article hasn't taken into account the secondary effects of letting COVID run rampant."
12865,It's made the assumption that all things else are equal.
12866,People aren‚Äôt going to read past the headline.
12867,"Whereas my school is opening up student spectators to allow 150 total students, less than 1% of the student body."
12868,"They have not done this yet, this game was postponed due to the other team being quarantined."
12869,"And here I am in Texas, near one of the most effected cities in the world, still staying inside, still getting my groceries delivered, still washing my hands obsessively, wearing a mask when I do have to go out."
12870,What an idiot I am!
12871,"/s 
So proud of my state..."
12872,Twitler
12873,Re-reading my comment I think the issue is I wasn‚Äôt clear about ‚Äúin gatherings‚Äù.
12874,"My bad, they must have read it as me disagreeing with celebrating a change in government, which was NOT my point‚Äî celebration in groups during a pandemic was my issue,  but on reflection I can see how that got misinterpreted as it‚Äôs not acceptable to celebrate Trump being replaced."
12875,But this isn't about attitude.
12876,"People who ""take it seriously"" get it, people who don't care about covid don't, it doesn't care what the person thinks"
12877,This is fucking insanity.....
12878,You‚Äôre accusing this sub of not being concerned for public health?
12879,You think this is a political facade?
12880,What planet are you on?
12881,What kind of delusional paranoia takes you down a hole that tells you 250K dead was faked just to get Trump out of office?
12882,They definitely happened spontaneously in NYC.
12883,"All of a sudden people were clapping, yelling, honking horns, etc."

12887,"I'm curious, have you tried to get on a Chinese forum and interact with Chinese people?"
12888,Is Taiwan the real China?
12889,"The Taiwanese themselves don't even want to be Chinese anymore (one of the reasons why Taiwan's ""China Airlines"" tried to change their name is because they are often thought of as a mainland Chinese airline)

12901,Pretty much.
12902,I think you are going to see most people ignore the pandemic in the US between Thanksgiving and New Years.
12903,Then people may go back to properly social distancing until Easter.
12904,"By the time Memorial Day hits, forget a out it."
12905,"Hopefully there will be an efficient vaccine out and widely available,  or people are just gonna ignore the Cov unless it hits them"

12910,one thing to consider: the university mandated every student get tested during the week prior to the football game.
12911,"if you declined the test or tested negative, your football ticket was deactivated."
12912,Surely there is some maximum of possible daily infections in the US?
12913,A lot of their staff have gotten sick.
12914,They have mostly covered it up.
12915,Also how much contact tracing is done on people that have visited and then caught the virus?
12916,"Years of propaganda, poor education, and being spoon fed the idea that you can be the bestest in the world while being willfully ignorant"
12917,"I could feel earlier in the week that I was getting sick, mainly sinus crud."
12918,"The problem with outbreaks in mink is that the virus has to adapt to a new species, so you‚Äôre getting a higher rate of mutations and the mutations are more likely to be significantly different from the parent strain than what you would see in normal human to human transmission."
12919,There‚Äôs way too much potential for these mink farms to churn out a virus that‚Äôs different enough to qualify as a different strain (which none of the other circulating variants are).
12920,This needs to be shut the fuck down now because it could easily set us back to day 1 with a brand new novel coronavirus.
12921,Hospitals will be over ran.
12922,People will be dying in the parking lot.
12923,"Voted for Biden, doesn't mean I was trying to be in a crowd like that."
12924,That was backwards to me.
12925,u/Whiteliesmatter1 chanting over and over again that nothing can exist without capitalism doesn't make it any more real.
12926,Your article is a metadrama about the survival of humans being impossible without the existence of capitalism.

12933,"Taiwan is Taiwan and China is China, the fact that you wrote that just shows how ignorant you are."
12934,Good job voting in person.
12935,It hasn't even been 2 weeks yet
12936,"Thanks, Abbott"
12937,jesus dude
12938,Why is Europe in the same mess?
12939,"I know despite being myself happy of the election results when I saw all the major cities gathering in the streets I had to say it, like guys you know covid19 hasn't disappeared?"
12940,"I don't want to be a hypocrite and will judge these gatherings as harshly as I did for Trumps rallies, I know the no masks were also a big deal but masks even outdoor alone with little to no social distancing reduce greatly their effectiveness."
12941,I live nearby Chicago in the burbs and rn in most of the area restaurants have had to close indoor dining or schools for about a week and now they see the crowds (large gatherings being even riskier than most other stuff) I can see while they are getting angrier and angrier because it is starting to seem like we have double standards.
12942,Classic example of ignorance is bliss.
12943,Really with 20/20 hindsight it makes it crazy to think that this was likely already spreading like crazy by then(I'm from northern NJ right by NYC) and just oblivious that either I put myself and family at risk of getting it and unknowingly spreading it too.
12944,"Also it's not because something was ""studied"" that it's the truth or even applies to all conservatives or that it wasn't manipulated at all."
12945,Many conservatives also live in very rural settings.
12946,I can clearly see how someone living in a small town where you can physically distance with ease doesn't want a public mask mandate.
12947,Inb4 this is used to create a warped study.
12948,"Many psychology publications or social science publications are incorrect, inaccurate or just plain lies."
12949,I quit working at my job in March since no one there was taking Covid seriously.
12950,I was convinced someone there was going to get Covid and I live with a very high risk person.
12951,I started to get fatigue in October and met some of my coworkers for an outside dining experience.
12952,I felt relatively safe and took proper precautions.
12953,After that day a coworker decided to travel out of state for the weekend to NYC.
12954,She posted a pic on her social media showing where she was then traveled back and immediately went back to work instead of a 14 day quarantine.
12955,Well lo and behold she has Covid.
12956,One of the other coworkers shared a cupcake with her when she was contagious who is also now showing symptoms amongst others as well.
12957,Some workers there have the option to quarantine which is just crazy to me.
12958,The ones in direct contact are quarantined.
12959,It‚Äôs just so stupid that I could‚Äôve been exposed because of complacency on everyone‚Äôs part.
12960,We‚Äôre talking about an 8 day difference of when I saw everyone versus her trip out of state.
12961,I sat next to her at the restaurant.
12962,Phew!
12963,I feel horrible because it seems she has a severe case as well.
12964,"Anyways, idk why I‚Äôm posting this here but maybe just as a reminder to stay steadfast and stick to what I was doing."
12965,"It was nice getting to see everyone, but not worth getting Covid and spreading it to someone high risk."
12966,Lesson learned.
12967,There have been some good studies and research about which masks protect you and others.
12968,"Quick little google... yes, cloth masks are better then nothing, but it‚Äôs not possible to get a tight seal on almost all of them... so you‚Äôre either spreading the virus or risking breathing it in."
12969,Will they in other places though?
12970,US has seen some suspicious stuff happening at mink farms and if a virus emerges I‚Äôm not so sure they would lock down or even cull them.
12971,Everything's bigger in Texas.
12972,"If this were last year and we were talking about the flu, you would not have used that argument."
12973,I had friends in Florida get sick and then go to tattoo parlors cause now they have time to heal at home.
12974,He told the tattoo artist and the tattoo artist didn‚Äôt give a shit and thought Covid was a ploy to hurt Trump.
12975,The tattoo shops were allowed to open by Desantis to lower unemployment payments and support the trump agenda.
12976,So fucking stupid.
12977,"Yeah with 500k per day it would still take a year, I mean you'll reach herd immunity before then but it'll take time for the lower R to have it's effect."
12978,You realize who was in charge of this dont you?
12979,An incompetent conspiracy theory driven idiot administration.
12980,"Yes, that‚Äôs called a celebration"
12981,[removed]
12982,Yeah.
12983,"My university, Iowa State, caused numbers to spike us to the number one hot town in America."
12984,Cases were than only like 20 over 30k people.
12985,We have mask mandates &amp; people usually followed them.
12986,"Then came Halloween &amp; partying, but before that we were real low."
12987,It's never to late to drop the numbers way down &amp; it isn't technically hard.
12988,It's just the fact most people can't think critically &amp; follow emotions before logic.
12989,Do you?
12990,"Odds are, given your political affiliation, you were not watching it go down at all and are assuming this based on someone's desperate criticism of democrats."
12991,"Also, what difference does it make if it was planned or unplanned?"
12992,"People were outdoors and wearing masks, two things we know help stop the spread."
12993,Will there be more cases from this?
12994,Probably.
12995,But the Biden campaign certainly didn't tell people to gather and celebrate.
12996,"Doesn't mean people didn't ""plan"" it on their own, but it certainly wasn't organized by the campaign, which is what you seem to be assuming?"
12997,"prior to the game, the coach did tell the team to expect a field-storming (if they won) and to evacuate the field."
12998,check out the footage of the end of the game: much of the gold helmets were already at the exit tunnel when the storming began.

13018,"Oil and gas is gonna have to face up to reality and no strawmen you make up, is going to change that fact."
13019,Partying in the streets shows those that weren't voted out that there is support by the masses for the ideals that Biden and Harris stand for.

13473,"&gt; FFS, Faucci said to not wear masks in April

Incorrect."
13474,"He said the following March 8th, when there were 500 total cases in the US: 
&gt;""Dr Fauci says ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason to be walking around with a mask."
13475,"When you‚Äôre in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it‚Äôs not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."
13476,"And, often, there are unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.‚Äù

By Apr 3rd, the CDC guidance was to wear a mask, and cases had exploded to 280,000."
13477,They had learned a lot about droplet and asymptomatic spreading in the meantime.
13478,"I still think Fauci was wrong to say what he did when he did, but he didn't say **not** to wear masks, and he definitely didn't say it in April."
13479,"Also I never know what the point of bringing this up is - if an expert gets it wrong once, do we just ignore them forever?"

13488,"(I know i‚Äôve seen that they‚Äôre overwhelmed and they‚Äôd obviously rather not be but from what i‚Äôve personally read from healthcare workers recently isn‚Äôt the desperate calls they had originally) or have we handled treatment better, are more prepared?"

13513,"In its 1987 decision in South Dakota v. Dole, which arguably remains the leading case regarding the use of the federal government‚Äôs conditional spending power, the Court held that legislation enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause must be in pursuit of the ‚Äúgeneral welfare.‚Äù In addition, the Dole Court held that any conditions attached to the receipt of federal funds must: (1) be unambiguously established so that recipients can knowingly accept or reject them; (2) be germane to the federal interest in the particular national projects or programs to which the money is directed; (3) not violate other provisions of the Constitution, such as the First Amendment or the Due Process or Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment; and (4) not cross the line from enticement to impermissible coercion, such that states have no real choice but to accept the funding and enact or administer a federal regulatory program."
13514,"The fourth of these criteria, in particular, is intended to ensure that any conditions on federal grant funds do not run afoul of the Tenth Amendment‚Äôs prohibition on the federal government‚Äôs ‚Äúcommandeering‚Äù of state or local governments or officials by requiring them to carry out federal programs."

13533,I provided an anecdote.
13534,There's lots of people saying the same thing.
13535,There's lots of current research going into it.
13536,Seasonal depression in particular is a slightly different beast than regular depression.
13537,"The fact is that my seasonal depression wasn't as bad when I took vitamin D over the winter, despite it getting worse every year leading up to that."
13538,"That doesn't necessarily establish a causal link, but it's a pretty solid anecdote."
13539,"Once I threw exercise into the mix, I started being fully functional in the winters."
13540,"I've spent almost my entire life struggling to get through each winter, up until two winters ago."
13541,"We don't understand a lot about our bodies, so saying that vitamin D only helps protect bones is pretty narrow minded (and wrong)."
13542,Saying that current research has not established a causal relationship between vitamin D and depression would be correct though.
13543,"Fun fact: calcium enhances cellular respiration, which is as important as it sounds."
13544,Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption.
13545,"But I'm just going to copy what the NIH says for you after their paragraph on calcium absorption (and hope it formats correctly since I'm on mobile): 

&gt;Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as well as modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [[1-3](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#en1)]."
13546,"Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many tissues have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D."
13547,"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#en1

So it actually affects a lot of things in the body."
13548,"Last I checked, depression and inflammation were actually suspected to be related, though I doubt that's in any way been confirmed."
13549,"Are you referring to the bleach injection comment or the actual steps - stay home, wash hands, get tested, wear masks, keep distance,  as provided by the CDC and the Task Force?"
13550,&gt;Doesn‚Äôt America have the most cases out of any other country in the world?
13551,"The US does, but that doesn't matter because you said...

13564,And they had been shipping sick covid patients back to nursing homes before the 25th.
13565,The 25th was the day they explicitly made it policy to try to prevent nursing homes from keeping them out.
13566,it needs to be at least 50% to get approval

13780,And now you‚Äôre saying I am calling your links fake news?

13786,The mutated strain?
13787,If so then we could be fucked.
13788,You're absolutely right.
13789,I still think the timing has something to do with it as NY was hit hard early and medical professionals learned how to treat it but of course don't know for sure.
13790,"Because there couldn‚Äôt possibly be any other way to indicate sarcasm, such as through literary devices like hyperbole."

13794,I feel like this is all talk.
13795,What is he going to do?
13796,Is there a link to his plan?
13797,Is he mandating masks?
13798,Sure but isn‚Äôt part of the role of federal government to be a uniting factor between the states?

13803,Now that Biden‚Äôs so call win is in question the virus will automatically get worse to assure the corrupt mail in ballot system.
13804,"So, basically the same?"
13805,The same thing?
13806,You mean he'll make fun of people who wear masks and continually say the pandemic is almost gone and that it barely affects anyone?
13807,He'll hold huge super-spreader rallies that bring new levels of infections into cities?
13808,"It wasn't that Trump wasn't doing anything, he was  *actively harming the country* with his rhetoric and actions."
13809,I mean saying he pretty much lost is more accurate right now.
13810,I'm not holding my breath until the real votes are counted on Jan 6

13828,Anything he releases now will just prompt Trump to do the opposite.
13829,I expect a huge increase in cases as Trump will actively fight measures for no other reason now than spite.
13830,"Since this was put up 8 hours ago, I would argue against the 'no apparent strategy' in the title."
13831,The first step of the strategy was literally for Biden to take the Whitehouse.
13832,"Now, through cabinet positions and executive orders he can set a strategy."
13833,The majority are recovering fine and continuing on with their lives.
13834,Biden had a party with thousands of people yesterday.
13835,"I feel like it's similar to a bad bout of pneumonia, but with no antibiotics."
13836,Itll stick to you for a while.
13837,currently past it 2 months since recovery and I have asthma attacks nightly.
13838,Nothing a little coffee won't clear up but a lot of 3 am starts to the day.
13839,Also its hard to tell if my inability to motivate is depression or exhaustion.
13840,"But I used to be real cool, I swear."
13841,I had a friend that used to be the guy that if you were 20 bucks short for something he would give it to you even if that meant he was not getting what he went for.
13842,He got a really great job because of a relative  that had him making more then 5x the lot of us combined ( 18 close friends ) and with in 2 years he had ditched us all.
13843,They were in quarantine for 2 weeks.

13845,What a weird number of days to write
13846,"Thank you Republicans and all their supporters,  nothing like spending the holidays cooped up in the house."
13847,Science denying should never be a political stance.
13848,"Ok, well thinking hundreds of thousands of deaths are deserved and should happen, not because the victims deserve it but to stick it to the government, is also a deeply sick position."
13849,&gt;They deserve hundreds of thousands of deaths until they will finally understand schools must be shut down.
13850,All of them.
13851,&gt;Italy can go to hell.
13852,Italy can bankrupt tomorrow.
13853,They don't deserve even a single bit of compassion.
13854,Your concept of empathy is deeply perverse.
13855,I‚Äôd really love to see legit studies proving this statement.
13856,Not just blind trust the science sloganeering
13857,Highway to the danger zone
13858,Its responsible to qurantine and get tested.
13859,"But if you all are washing hands, wearing masks, not beeing too close together for long time, especially  in closed spaces, there is good probability you are ok. Well its on you what you do."
13860,"Aparently you kick the 90 year olds out (there is no solution, just people who care about not being homeless more than having a hospital bed available in case of emergency)"
13861,Short term gains is all the rage these days.
13862,"If they really cared about long term gains they would have mobilized the army and doctors across the country, built new hospitals, heavily punished quarantine breakers, put tracker on every phone, mandate weekly tests for at risk industry workers, and opened school last like China did, all the while making it very clear to the population they have the choice of their freedom or their lives."
13863,"And if they don't comply but are at low risk from COVID, it is still the choice between their freedom or their lives."
13864,Don't forget the motorcycle accidents!
13865,/s
13866,Yes but it becomes particularly ridiculous for people to think Covid was a hoax hinging on the American election when it‚Äôs killing people the world over every day.
13867,It's not so much of a plan as it is an expression of his true nature to want to damage the country as much as possible
13868,Only if the author has made a significant effort to highlight that they are being sarcastic.
13869,"That includes all sorts of symbolic statements such as /s, ;p, ;), :) and ect."
13870,Fortunately deaths still low.
13871,For now!
13872,&gt; But there were definitely people who got sick and died from blm protests.
13873,Not everything makes the news.
13874,Got a source on this one?
13875,"I mean, yes, it is inevitable *someone* contracted COVID while protesting."
13876,But did we see evidence the protests accelerated spread?
13877,"No, we did not."
13878,"Uhhh if that were the case, wouldnt it not end until January?"
13879,Not sure you're thinking this one through.
13880,can the Guardian wait until president elect Joe Biden is sworn in before publishing the article?
13881,"When Trump announced the CDC was recommending masks, he then went out of his way to specify that it was voluntary and that he wouldn't do it, and indeed refused to wear one in public for months."
13882,Pence refused to wear one in a hospital.
13883,Trump also once said that he believed people were wearing masks as a political statement against him.
13884,He has repeatedly said he thinks we're testing too many people.
13885,The administration ended federal funding for test sites and opposed adding more funding for it in a relief bill.
13886,You're acting like the things Trump says have no impact when it's incredibly obvious that there is a large number of Americans who will listen to him but not the CDC.
13887,Leading by example is extremely important.
13888,"I couldn't help but notice that when Biden and Harris were on stage together at their speech last night, they wore masks."
13889,"They probably get tested every day, so they didn't have to do that."
13890,"But it shows some solidarity with what everyone else is going through, in contrast to things like Trump's family refusing to wear masks at the first debate."
13891,And there are other things too.
13892,"HHS is collecting detailed data on hospitalizations, but not sharing it with state and local officials, or even most members of the task force."
13893,Just just a total lack of competency throughout the leadership.
13894,Get some therapy.
13895,"If someone is unable to live alone for any period of time, there's gotta be deeper problems."
13896,Biden is also a lawyer.
13897,Have you ever thought about anyone but yourself?
13898,They're a remote island in the pacific with the population of Alabama.
13899,You simply can't compare them with the USA or Europe; it's infinitely easier to contain a virus with their circumstances.
13900,Thank you.
13901,No worries.
13902,I'm not against masking btw.
13903,I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm the manager at my warehouse.
13904,I‚Äôve enforced 100% mask while on company property.
13905,If you feel uncomfortable or need a break to ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù employees are welcome to head to the parking lot and take off mask.
13906,"In my state, when they release the deaths there‚Äôs two ways they say it: ‚Äúa male resident of x county‚Äù or ‚Äúa male resident 60 or over‚Äù and I‚Äôm like... People will use that ‚Äú60‚Äù and automatically your death isn‚Äôt as big of a deal?"
13907,"Yeah, we learned the hard way early."
13908,A few assholes but the majority wear masks and all business pretty much require them to shop.
13909,You think they'll be over it when people are dying of non-covid medical emergencies because they can't get treatment?
13910,The bar is so low that the new administration could do anything and it would be better than what we have now

13943,What do you mean?!
13944,Trump clearly was a fan of Futurama.

13965,"Sure it's infinitely better than having a moron that actively sabotages COVID response, but you have to be psychologically prepared for the reality that there's only so much Biden can do without the cooperation of 70 million people who A) evidently signed up to the death cult, and B) probably want Biden to fail

Good thing is we know what can work, it has been done, bad news is it requires Biden to sacrifice himself."
13966,"Nature is cruel, and nothing comes for free."
13967,"China got it under control, but at the cost of, for a long time, being attacked globally for violating human rights, and when they tested early, they had to pay the cost of being falsely blamed as the origin (because of course first test = first cases)

For Biden to really solve this, he'll need to do things that will be viciously attacked by everyone, even including some other democrats."
13968,"In the end, if he succeeds, he'll become a hero, but greatness never comes for free, and most will die in their attempt."

13998,These things aren't as easy to calculate as they might seem.
13999,"What happens if you admit 8,000 patients and then a staff outbreak means you only have staff to treat 6,000 people all of a sudden?"

14051,Sadly a phrase I imagine of which some iteration has already been uttered more than once this year...
14052,There's several layers of protections at work here.
14053,"This gets long, sorry, but the federal civil service system is really complicated; this is barely a Cliff Notes version."
14054,"**Civil Service Protections:**

This isn't the first time Presidents or political appointees have tried to fire career civil service employees for political reasons."
14055,It's been a big enough problem in the past that we have a legal system in place to prevent that.
14056,"That system is governed by the [Civil Service Reform Act of 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service_Reform_Act_of_1978), and some later amendments to that Act."
14057,There are limits to what a Presidential Executive Order can do.
14058,One of the limits is that executive orders can't override legislation passed by Congress.
14059,"[The Schedule F Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/) appears to do just that-- it hasn't been tested yet, but would probably be vulnerable to a court challenge on those grounds."
14060,"**Seniority:**

Under the Civil Service system, the more seniority a federal employee has, the harder it is to fire them-- they get more appeals, a review board has to approve the firing, etc."

14064,NIH is structured a little differently than a typical federal agency.
14065,"Under their rules, a lot of leadership posts have to be held by qualified medical doctors or research scientists."
14066,You can't just bring in a political appointee or a manager from the [Senior Executive Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Executive_Service_\(United_States\)) with no experience at NIH to fill those jobs-- it has to be someone who's qualified in that scientific or medical discipline.
14067,"Those leadership protections are weaker now than they were in the 1980s, but Fauci is grandfathered in because he's been there so long."
14068,"**Popularity within the Civil Service:**

If Facui was fired, he'd get several appeals &amp; reviews."
14069,Those appeal boards are primarily staffed with very senior career civil servants.
14070,They all have a vested interest in stopping an executive order that strips away civil service protections.
14071,"**Conclusion:**

If President Trump was determined to fire Fauci and actually got dedicated lawyers who know the ins and outs of the civil service system to push the firing, he would eventually succeed."
14072,"But it's common for it to take more than 90 days to fire a senior civil servant, even if there's clear evidence of wrongdoing."
14073,Today we're at 73 days until the inauguration.

14087,"Guess we'll schedule another recess 'til mid January or so."""
14088,Ok well now I know your plan of how you are going to protect Biden when millions of people die after he becomes president.
14089,You will just say ahh it's trump's faults he did nothing ahhh.
14090,"Everything Trump did, good or bad you didn't like or you denied he did it, with Biden it will be the opposite, anything bad and you deny it anything good you will praise him for."
14091,Whataboutism is definitely a helpful comment
14092,"Ah, a republican judge appointed by Bush."

14095,It's a shit hole country through and through.

14103,(Troll) you have to be one to not understand that people in stadiums will absolutely not distance and it's gonna spread hard.
14104,"Cuomo sent 6,000 sick Covid patients into nursing homes, where there was then mass spread and death."
14105,"And your defense is, there is no indication that it was the 6,000 sick people that caused mass spread?"
14106,Do you think it caused zero spread and zero deaths?
14107,"If it had no impact, why did they change the order after all the people died in nursing homes?"
14108,All because their governors are stupid and one of them is basically the class cheerleader that should be manning a bikini barista hut.
14109,The way
14110,Hopefully not!
14111,People will definitely be out in the streets protesting.

14113,The first one was bad enough.
14114,"If Joe does, he better start sending checks, not just one like the previous administration."

14147,"Don‚Äôt hesitate, folks."
14148,It has been revealed his early reluctance to publicly encourage mask wearing was because Trump didn‚Äôt ramp up domestic mask production enough to even support healthcare workers.
14149,He did an admirable job balancing his messages.
14150,I definitely wore a mask before it was popular.
14151,Yeah.

14177,Yeah people still need to go to work and socialize.
14178,I never said they shouldn‚Äôt.
14179,Just wear a fucking mask and quit having parties.
14180,You can get your necessary dose of socialization without going out to bars and parties especially maskless.
14181,People aren‚Äôt ‚Äújust going back to work‚Äù or Australia and New Zealand would be just as fucked as we are.
14182,But they aren‚Äôt.

14184,Right.
14185,This whole administration has been about creating self-fulfilling prophecies.
14186,This will be another one.
14187,"Trump hit Biden hard on another shutdown, and by doing nothing for these last 75 days, it will get so bad that he will force Biden‚Äôs hand, and then tweet ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù after it happens."
14188,"Unrelated, but same thing will happen when Biden has to raise taxes to pay for the ~3 trillion+ deficit run up during COVID."
14189,To be fair he has no incentive to do anything about it now.
14190,"At least since Joe won we can look forward to a Jan strategy, if trump won it wouod just be more of the same ignorance."
14191,The first 6 months there will be so much demand and so little supply we won‚Äôt need cash payments.
14192,After 6 months or a year then it may make sense to give cash to those remaining.
14193,People that got it early with no payment will complain but oh well.
14194,"They did get the benefit of not dying or getting sick hopefully, so there‚Äôs that."

14209,Same with all the people celebrating biden's win
14210,Congress needs to extend healthcare protections to allow more contact tracing disclosures to businesses (HIPAA literally prevents contact tracing from being more effective).
14211,Everything else falls on the local government.
14212,Hope you voted for smart people this November.
14213,&gt; And you know you're immune....how?
14214,People have been infected more than once.
14215,That was dismissed months ago

14353,"I guess in some sense, they have ""a right"" to do that."

14372,Basically.
14373,There will be a different tone from atop but the response will largely be the same.
14374,There isn‚Äôt going to be a shutdown.
14375,Biden isn‚Äôt going to close his economy.
14376,If there‚Äôs a mask mandate it wont be enforced.
14377,The vaccine is nearly here.
14378,That‚Äôs what will end this.
14379,Not someone waving their blue wand.
14380,The spread of COVID is ultimately the responsibility of the American people.
14381,"Trump and Biden are just one person, they cannot patrol every single party, protest, and gathering."
14382,"The American people have major responsibilities here, and they are the ones partying and protesting."
14383,"I really think things are just going to get worse and worse this winter because of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Hanukah, and Christmas."
14384,"The liberals will find out very quickly that just because Biden is in office, it means nothing if the people don't want to play along."
14385,Cases in my state are climbing.
14386,"We still have the lowest case count, but according to worldometers we have 38 new cases today and one new death (first since July)."
14387,"My daughter was exposed at physical therapy, so we all have to get tested tomorrow."

14391,What?
14392,This is blatantly incorrect.
14393,"There aren't even credible reports that it had infected anyone by October yet, how could anyone know it was a coronavirus?"
14394,Thanks for posting the translation.
14395,"After they killed all the minks, could they stop ""farming"" minks?"
14396,"If they go back to the business, wouldn't it repeat the process and just more minks will get killed?"
14397,Me.
14398,A billion is too much.
14399,Anything over a billion goes back into the pot.
14400,I'm not asking you anything.
14401,"Stay at home until 2022 if you want, I don't mind in the slightest."
14402,"Are BBQ pits, bonfires, or heat lamps a viable option in any Ohio cities/towns?"
14403,The strategy is Biden.
14404,It‚Äôs gonna be a rough few months.

14410,If someone is worried about COVID they are free to go on a personal lockdown.
14411,"Dude, you are 100 percent correct but  yowza it is going to suck."
14412,&gt; Where in Sicily do you live?
14413,"Catania

&gt; How bad is the virus there right now?"
14414,How are the hospitals?
14415,Are they overrun with COVID patients?
14416,"We're in near-lockdown, while the situation is not at all great we're still not into ""catastrophe"" mode."
14417,But I hope we can prevent going there :/
14418,"Well, as an European... enjoy your freedom while it lasts."
14419,"Once they get to the power, they will do everything they can to control people and they are not really eager to let it go."
14420,So mandatory muzzling and indefinite homejails can be expected.
14421,"We were told that they state of emergency and lockdown is for two weeks, Now we are running over the month and they are telling us we should already forget the Christmas, because no way they are gonna let us roam loose this year."
14422,"Eh, I do the same with brands, athletes, and Hollywood when they tell me how to think."
14423,You might be correct after all.
14424,We can thank the liberal masses gathering in celebration.
14425,I guess Covid is cured because we elected Biden?
14426,"We are going to set a even bigger record in two weeks, mark my words."
14427,Aren‚Äôt seatbelts a mandatory thing we all have to wear?
14428,Or get pulled over and pay a fine.
14429,Why is it so hard to mandate wearing masks?
14430,It‚Äôs ridiculous

14444,How are the hospitals?
14445,Are they overrun with COVID patients?
14446,Glad you have online school
14447,People have been delusional about the state of this pandemic for months now.
14448,No reason to expect it to change now.
14449,We are in deep shit now and no switch is going to be flipped that gets us back on track.
14450,Buckle in

14457,"I‚Äôm not saying it will be easy, but that‚Äôs kinda the point of a president no?"
14458,And I have a lot more faith in Biden being able to work with states than Trump who basically used mocking and empty threats to try and achieve his goals.
14459,Europe has not recently taken aggressive measures against the virus.
14460,In spring the virus was taken seriously in Europe.
14461,Not anymore now in autumn.
14462,Im comparing per capita.
14463,Its basically me saying that you shouldnt speak too quickly about how bad the US has had it with covid when France is getting absolutely crushed currently
14464,If thats the case why did Mark Meadows say [‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not going to control the pandemic‚Äô](https://globalnews.ca/news/7420914/coronavirus-trump-chief-of-staff/amp/)
14465,How so?
14466,It's exactly because half the country thinks it's all an overblown cold and their state leaders listen.
14467,All Presidents actively harm this country in one way or another.
14468,"And science is fluid itself, as things can change, just like his decalarations."

14488,"Not because I believe it will destroy government and banks, well i dont believe it will, they will probably coexist."
14489,"But the technology is rather genius, I am into it..."
14490,The CDC isn't telling people that masks are a political statement.
14491,I highly doubt the CDC recommended cutting funding for testing or believes we are testing too many people.
14492,"And Trump is not ""deferring"" to the CDC, he and his appointees are in fact [actively interfering with them](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32002-X/fulltext#%20)."
14493,"It frankly doesn't matter whether the Task Force or Trump personally is making bad decisions, because the Task Force is made up almost entirely of people he appointed and who report directly to him."
14494,"Except Biden can't do that until his term begins in January 20, 2021."
14495,Time is of the essence.
14496,ah...

14504,ü§£.
14505,Stop spreading unscientific politically driven disinformation and Ill stop reporting.
14506,Biden isn't necessarily guaranteed to be in office in January.
14507,"But ultimately, the responsibility of stopping COVID belongs to the people."
14508,"Neither Trump, nor Biden can stop COVID spread if the people don't want to play ball and do things like get tested, socially distance, and wear masks."
14509,The spike now is because of fall weather as well as Halloween celebrations.
14510,"Things are just going to get worse from Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, and Christmas."
14511,I personally know MANY healthcare professionals in New York City who worked through the peak of the pandemic.
14512,"I also know people who have died, and I know people who have gotten sick and tested positive."
14513,"This doesn't even refer to a vaccine, it's a group of molecular biologists tracking the genome of the virus."

14533,The US new cases number is 0.0386% of the population.
14534,What is the United States doing that France isn't?
14535,I've been under the impression we've been doing a pretty piss poor job handling this from top to bottom.
14536,Congress can regulate interstate commerece.
14537,Because the virus has crossed state lines they can regulate how the virus is transmitted.

14539,More true than US.
14540,What are midterms?
14541,Another election of some kind?
14542,Can they start a new war without Senate?
14543,Biden will start one as soon as he can.
14544,Yes because he has the Legendary Sword of Virus Killing
14545,You talk like it's a good thing.
14546,Weird.
14547,9/11 bad.
14548,Covid-19.... *not bad...?
14549,"*

Apparently, to some people, some innocent lives lost are worse than others, when the reality is they're both awful."
14550,The difference is that we can control Covid if people weren't retarded.
14551,Everyone projected wrong... the virus won the popular vote.
14552,"Yeah his entire plan just seems like an attack on Trump, but Trump has been doing almost everything in his plan except 7."
14553,"If Biden can actually do that, it would make a huge difference."

14558,you‚Äôre seriously a hero.
14559,i‚Äôm constantly at odds with my management about setting a standard for our workplace and enforcing it.
14560,i‚Äôm sick of their excuses for the lack of consistency and they are sick of me for overstepping my role and holding them accountable.
14561,it‚Äôs exhausting.

14563,"Weird many seem to joke and call them Gravy Seals or Meal Time Six, while still trying to make them seem dangerous."
14564,And yet every other Western country has managed it.
14565,Same with Fauci.

14570,Well the rest of your employees better be living like kings.
14571,"With the election lost, I am already expecting Trump and Republicans to not only do nothing about the pandemic, but to also pour gasoline on it and try to make it as bad as possible before Biden takes over"
14572,"Shame that some states dont do this, for a state the same population or less as the UK, at most random testing of a few 10s of thousand a week would be sufficient to get a good idea."
14573,"The federal government required that cars have seat belts, not that they are compulsory to wear."
14574,"So an equivalent scenario is if they sent masks to everyone, but did not require them to be worn."
14575,"New Hampshire actually doesn't have a seat belt law for adults, only children."
14576,Some states are primary seat belt states and others are secondary.
14577,Primary means that they can give a ticket with the lack of self belt being the only offense.
14578,But secondary states only allow tickets when the lack of seat belt is in addition to another infraction.
14579,Or banning businesses that can handle remote work from mandating in office on the basis of just wanting butts in chairs.
14580,You realize there are over 50 million cases right?
14581,"Yes long-term effects *are* rare, even if only from a purely statistical perspective."
14582,belgiums R value is below 1.
14583,So maybe other countries soon start to drop as well if they are in a lockdown (light)
14584,Biden said last night he‚Äôs announcing his COVID task force tomorrow so we should get a good idea about his plans then
14585,Yall get a load of this guy trying to tell me long haul effects are common
14586,"Thanks dude, I'm feeling fine now"
14587,It‚Äôs a pandemic.

14589,"but that's exactly the reason that governors pushed back this spring, why would that change next spring?"

14592,I'm no statistician but my take is that we want to look at where the dots are on the light blue lines... Further right being likelier to have caught it there...
14593,"So in order of most dangerous to least... ""Bar/coffee shop"" (ludicrous that they couldn't separate those!"
14594,"), ""restaurant"", ""church"", ""gym""."
14595,Masks will have to stay for a time after rollout.
14596,"For starters, vaccines will not give instant immunity."
14597,"It will take at least a couple weeks after vaccination, possibly not until the booster in some cases."
14598,A very small part of the population will be initially vaccinated.
14599,Level of spread is what will determine the return to normal.
14600,Until we get enough immunity in the population this will not decrease without keeping up social distancing.
14601,How effective a vaccine is will make a huge difference.
14602,"If it is only 60% effective, 40% who take it may still be vulnerable."
14603,"We would need to actively keep protecting them until spread decreases, but vaccines would still be an important tool in decreasing spread and potentially getting  covid under control."
14604,"We won't know that until we see the data, however."
14605,"So, yes, it will need to stay for a time."
14606,"This isn't an instant ""it's over"" scenario."
14607,It's the dragon sickness.

14610,i'd like to see him try to push one through since then the republican supreme court would have to admit they were the ones bending precedent to their own will instead of using it as a guide.
14611,1918/1919 supreme court case gave the government wide leeway during a pandemic for stuff like that.
14612,Have they factored in resistance from the public?
14613,"The small amount of condemnation over recent celebrations will make people think large gatherings, even with masks and no social distancing, are okay again."
14614,"If he didn't preface with that, someone will just say ""Pfft 4000 a day is nothing!""."

14624,"Run is cumulative, not daily for evaluation."
14625,"If masks work, why are European countries with mask orders seeing increased cases?"
14626,There is *zero* evidence of a causal relationship between mask use and case count.
14627,Norway didn't require masks at all until this month and they have the 5th lowest per capita case count in Europe.
14628,"No, lockdowns clearly do not work."
14629,You have no basis for that position.
14630,This.
14631,"No matter how good a strategy is, if people don‚Äôt follow it, it is going to fail."
14632,Some Americans just won‚Äôt wear masks and social distance.

14641,We have a poison leaderpship caste.
14642,No one man should have all that power.
14643,Just by winning* Biden now has a voice.
14644,Every action he and his team take steers the country‚Äôs direction.
14645,Instead of us vs them attacks he will be spreading unity and a solution-focused attitude.
14646,Instead of mocking science they will be pro science.
14647,Instead of insulting masks they will be wearing masks.
14648,"He probably won‚Äôt be flat out preaching but every action he and his team take will be focused on creating a patriotic unified mission to attack the virus, not each other."
14649,I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if his team starts to end their interviews with ‚Äúremember to wear your mask.‚Äù Have everyone say the same thing every time.
14650,May be annoying but it is an easy free way to drive the point home.
14651,The rest of us need to make billionaires illegal
14652,Another aspect that I don't think gets talks about is to just slow the turnover in your social circle.
14653,"For example, say I form a bubble of 6 people for a month, and we all exclusively interact with each other during that time, then switch to another bubble of 6."
14654,That scenario is FAR better than just having a larger group of 12 interacting with each other.
14655,"That's despite the fact that if you average across two months, I've interacted with 12 people in both scenarios."
14656,"Basically, what I'm saying is there's a time dimension involved too."
14657,Long haul effects are not rare and your statement is not objectively true.
14658,HAHA OH GOD whoosh.
14659,What a great visual üòÇ
14660,Where is the comment saying that he wants to see the Chinese to suffer ?
14661,"Man you jump from ""China gov is well known for hiding the truth and spreading lies"" to ""Let every single chinese suffer and die""."
14662,"You play the card of racism so wrong, I don't even know what to tell you..."
14663,"one point that is worth noting, even long after people started talking shit about cuomo re: nursing homes, other governors were doing exactly the same thing yet receive no shit talking in the same regard."
14664,"hell, my state is still sending nursing home patients back while positive even six months later."
14665,"The protests and celebrations likely matter less in  the long run than the always open bars and schools, but I firmly agree."
14666,Far too few Americans take this seriously.
14667,Much remains the fault of our leaderpship but not all.
14668,Our overall attitude is the main reason we're doing worst in the world.
14669,Our paradigm is clearly warped

14681,"I got sick with symptoms that were on the Covid list (fever/chills, headache, body aches) and some people I know advised me not to get tested unless I ended up in the ER, because it would be in my medical records and potentially cause problems with insurance coverage some day."
14682,"I did get tested, because I'm high risk (I take immunosuppressant medication) and my doctor said it was important to know what I was potentially facing."
14683,"Turns out it wasn't Covid (negative test, and my symptoms only lasted about 12 hours, never got worse, I never had any respiratory symptoms, and it never came back)."

14691,"Seeing so many
People not care and do what they want, potentially leading to another shutdown in a couple months, which would probably be a kill shot for me and my family, is infuriating."
14692,[removed]
14693,"comparing EU to USA is not ideal to begin with unless you think the population density and demographics are exactly the same (they aren't), so you'd want to look at smaller areas, say compare chicago to whatever city in EU is similar size and population or miami, cleveland, louisville, whatever."
14694,you should be able to get a correlation to draw some conclusions.
14695,"the second problem here is an assumption that european and american medical care exactly the same, as well as having all the same preexisting conditions, same volume and treatment in nursing homes, etc."
14696,We could also just kill everybody preemptively.
14697,That should slow down the spread.
14698,"I wish they wouldn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs person not people."
14699,It‚Äôs a meaningless thing I know but still it‚Äôs more fun when it‚Äôs one person so you can debate it and stuff.
14700,"Yes, Trump and Governors should force everyone to be tested and quarantined if they're pozzed."
14701,I agree with one point you make.
14702,"&gt;  I do not believe much else can be done in this free country 

Because Trump and his followers have politicized basic public health measures like masks and even the seriousness of the virus itself."
14703,So it's too late now.
14704,"Even when Trump is gone, there's still going to be tons of people spreading misinformation about masks and telling people not to get tested."
14705,That's not going away in January.
14706,But we shouldn't need a nationwide mask mandate enforced by federal law.
14707,All we needed was a president who cared more about the safety of the American people than his own reelection chances (or at least one capable of thinking more than a couple weeks ahead who would realize that an effective response would have ensured his reelection).
14708,"Even if the federal government has little direct authority, they have a lot of resources - we spend more on the CDC than some states do on their entire budget - and they can effectively coordinate efforts between states."
14709,There was almost none of that type of coordination happening (like the lack of data sharing I already mentioned).
14710,"And when it came to sourcing and distributing things like PPE and ventilators, did Trump use the logistics experts at FEMA or the DLA?"
14711,"No, he used Jared Kushner and a bunch of [volunteers from business consultants](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/how-inexperienced-volunteers-tapped-by-kushner-added-to-confusion-chaos-of-federal-response/)."
14712,"Instead of going on TV and saying ""Masks are voluntary"" and ""I won't be wearing one"", he should have gone on TV wearing a mask and said ""Wear a mask to protect yourself and others""."
14713,"Even better would have been a joint statement with someone like Obama or Biden where they're both on stage, wearing masks, 6 feet apart."
14714,To reach as many people as possible and make it absolutely clear that it's important and not political.
14715,That probably would have been much more effective than a mandate in January that many local cops wouldn't enforce anyway.
14716,That's the kind of influence a president has beyond the actual legal/policy authority.
14717,"But instead of using that influence to aid the public health response, Trump used it to undermine it."
14718,Lol nope.
14719,"Federalism, state autonomy, a lot more land to cover than the UK, and a culture that rejects any hint of increased authoritarianism means we're left to the whims of our states' governors."
14720,It is too late just for mask.
14721,If you look on the 1th wave in US it came 4-6 weeks after EU.
14722,In EU the 2nd wave is much stronger.
14723,"In EU we had mask mandate in many countries, limited social gathering etc."
14724,Italy had ~2000 cases by end of September.
14725,Now it is ~38k.
14726,All with masks.
14727,The same patter is repeating everywhere.
14728,"Day 1: closing restaurants, schools etc."
14729,That‚Äôs the republican strategy.
14730,I will be interested to see how frequently a person will have to be vaccinated.
14731,I personally know a 19 year old healthy female who was reinfected.
14732,"First infection June, 2nd was October."
14733,It will require mass production on an even larger scale.
14734,This states current reputation totally makes smart people want to move here.

14758,"And second, nowhere has been hit hard."
14759,These places have all been told they've been hit hard and seen nothing really dramatic around them.
14760,It's proof that the pandemic isn't really a big deal.
14761,Those places have all had ~10% of their population infected over a slow period in summer.

14824,"&gt; Because unless you track the contacts of those having tested positive, it‚Äôs utterly useless."
14825,The ones most at risk to be infected by them are the people who live with them and those are required to quarantine with them even if they tested negative (though obviously it's recommended to have the positive person in a different room of the home than the negative ones).

15063,"&gt; As the only flying mammal, bats elevate their metabolic rates in flight to a level that doubles that achieved by similarly sized rodents when running."
15064,"&gt; Generally, vigorous physical activity and high metabolic rates lead to higher tissue damage due to an accumulation of reactive molecules, primarily free radicals."
15065,"But to enable flight, bats seem to have developed physiological mechanisms to efficiently mop up these destructive molecules."
15066,"&gt; This has the side benefit of efficiently mopping up damaging molecules produced by inflammation of any cause, which may explain bats‚Äô uniquely long lifespans."
15067,"Smaller animals with faster heart rates and metabolism typically have shorter lifespans than larger animals with slower heartbeats and slower metabolism, presumably because high metabolism leads to more destructive free radicals."
15068,"But bats are unique in having far longer lifespans than other mammals of the same size: Some bats can live 40 years, whereas a rodent of the same size may live two years."
15069,&gt; This rapid tamping down of inflammation may also have another perk: tamping down inflammation related to antiviral immune response.
15070,"One key trick of many bats‚Äô immune systems is the hair-trigger release of a signaling molecule called interferon-alpha, which tells other cells to ‚Äúman the battle stations‚Äù before a virus invades."
15071,"&gt; ....‚ÄúThis suggests that having a really robust interferon system would help these viruses persist within the host,‚Äù Brook said."
15072,"‚ÄúWhen you have a higher immune response, you get these cells that are protected from infection, so the virus can actually ramp up its replication rate without causing damage to its host."
15073,"But when it spills over into something like a human, we don‚Äôt have those same sorts of antiviral mechanism, [and we could experience a lot of pathology](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/02/10/coronavirus-outbreak-raises-question-why-are-bat-viruses-so-deadly/).‚Äù 
  
You think I'm just going to talk about metabolism from thin air?"
15074,"When we talk about our susceptibility to a new pandemic we're talking about animals in nature that have unique circumstances to be harbors of novel viruses, like bats."
15075,"Or we're talking about farm animals which we pump full of antibodies, just to plump them up, which creates an environment ripe for a superbug that would be resistant to our drugs."
15076,We don't talk about cats or dogs because they live very similar lives to us.
15077,Their biology doesn't preclude them to viral reservoirs like bats.
15078,And their behavior doesn't lend them to tight crowding where a virus would easily spread among thousands of them like so many other animals.
15079,"And of course all the domestic cats and dogs basically live a life as sheltered as their owners, so they're no more prone to a novel virus than we are to produce one ourselves."
15080,"We're not talking about ""catching"" the virus."
15081,We're talking about animals mutating them and manufacturing them.
15082,Cats and dogs are simply not a part of that discussion.
15083,South tyrol is closing schools.
15084,"Considering the last administration did NOT do that, this is, albeit correctly unspecific, a welcomed change."
15085,"Ramping up testing to better monitor developing hot spots and working with local authorities on preemptively increasing restrictions, for example, could do a lot of good."
15086,"Also, standing behind the words of our doctors and scientists might help add much needed weight to them."
15087,I wonder if that has to do with runoff effects of the guidelines.
15088,"Mask use, social distancing and limited gathers has probably cut down on other disease spread."
15089,"With everyone at home, less people on the roads, less traffic deaths."
15090,"With bars being closed, less drunk driving deaths."

15092,Canada really needs to get those sinopharm vaccines ready before winter comes or brace for the even worse.
15093,They've done some recent studies that demonstrate this.
15094,"Basically if you're wealthy, powerful or popular people kiss your ass and it warps your thinking and even your brain to an extent."
15095,The most grounded people in any of those categories make an effort to maintain equal human relationships with someone or a group of someone that won't kiss their ass and it ends up being a counterbalance so they remain more normal.

15313,That‚Äôs Nothing compared to Illinois‚Äô 12K cases yesterday and already over 10K cases today per Worldometers!
15314,But for some reason FL just keeps making the news...
15315,That's similar to what we are doing in NY.
15316,"Aggressive testing and tracing to identify the ""clusters"" and responding to those accordingly so that you don't have to worry about one place seeing a big spike and having it affect areas with low community spread."
15317,I think most doctors are up front about it when they prescribe stuff like vitamin D though.
15318,"""It might help with this, and your vitamin D levels are low, so it's worth a shot."""
15319,"An ethical doctor will still prescribe some sort of antidepressant, or whatever it is you need, if they believe that you need medication."
15320,"And the placebo effect is definitely a thing, so maybe that's what I was experiencing before adding exercise to the equation, but improvement is still improvement."
15321,"Research has even shown that, depending on what's being treated, placebos can still help even if the patient is aware that it's a placebo, so I definitely wouldn't rule it out."
15322,I would never recommend vitamin D over actual medication though.
15323,"If you have severe depression, definitely see a doctor and stay on whatever meds you find work."
15324,"But there's nothing wrong with also taking vitamin D, particularly if you already have low vitamin D levels."
15325,"There is at least *some* evidence that indicates a *potential* causal relationship between depression and vitamin D.

I also took low dose aspirin during my last pregnancy under the direction of my OB/GYN, despite the research being pretty new about it reducing the risk of preeclampsia (I was considered high risk)."
15326,Sometimes you do things before there is substantial research.
15327,"There's at least one clinical trial still in progress for that one (set to conclude 2024), and there is definitely confusion over what week to start/stop taking the aspirin, or a lot of other stuff, actually, but doctors are still recommending it."
15328,"&gt;I was in Boston Commons yesterday and saw tons of ppl not wearing masks

15348,They could have just said nothing and put everyone in a better place.
15349,"Of course what they should have actually said is ""as a precautionary measure we suggest people wear masks to protect themselves and others"" and it wouldn't have been dishonest"
15350,It is a typical Western/Christian response to sit and wait for a miracle to save us.
15351,China knew it was their problem to solve and solved it.

15361,The half lock down the government is doing is a joke.
15362,"For the school, a class will only be closed until 3 kids test positive but at the same time they are no longer priority to be tested because the government keeps using the argument that kids are not very contagious."

15439,You are correct that it's 'strange' that most people don't know they have it.
15440,But you know how scientists know that asymptomatic people actually have it?
15441,They give it to other people who actually do end up developing symptoms.
15442,People shouldn't be losing their homes or starving.
15443,That's a failing of our state and federal governments.
15444,[removed]
15445,"Ok, show me the data."
15446,&gt; The robust vaccination programs in place for people are due to the fact that for many diseases herd immunity will never be achieved.
15447,Vaccinations are to avoid everyone having to catch the disease to achieve herd immunity.
15448,"Occasionally, we can even eradicate a disease (smallpox) with it."
15449,You can never do that with herd immunity because someone's always contagious to make progress.
15450,"&gt; Plague doesn't reach herd immunity, it just kills everyone."
15451,"Bubonic plague, which spreads very quickly and gives lifelong immunity, reaches herd immunity very quickly."
15452,Or maybe it doesn't even spread from human to human and the term is meaningless; plague is a weird one and probably not a good example to use.
15453,"The issue you're pointing out is that newly born people do not have that immunity, so you have to redo it every generation or two."
15454,"Bubonic plague would die out in one city, but still be alive and well in another one."
15455,Then 50 years later it would get re-introduced and be just as bad as the first time.
15456,"We do have plague ""vaccines"", but they are not believed to actually do anything."
15457,We destroyed plague by introducing sanitation so that its method of spread (fleas) was removed.
15458,We have never used vaccinations to successfully prevent plague; that statement is false.
15459,&gt; Swine Flu didn't infect NEARLY enough people to reach herd immunity.
15460,20% of the US caught Swine Flu.
15461,"Then it stopped (or, perhaps, summer came)."
15462,&gt; Many scientists have already stated that herd immunity is likely not a viable strategy against COVID 19.
15463,"Many scientists have stated we don't know how long immunity lasts, because we don't (we recently semi-proved it lasts at least 6 months)."
15464,"Propaganda is trying to redefine ""herd immunity"" to mean naturally achieved herd immunity."
15465,Every scientist knows that's dumb as fuck as it will result in millions of dead people in the US and Europe.
15466,But that's not the meaning of herd immunity.
15467,&gt; You are so misinformed it's insane.
15468,"(Almost) everything I have said is correct, and most of your statements have been false."
15469,Forget about your fight with me and go look it up at a source you trust.
15470,"Wikipedia can tell you about herd immunity, swine flu, and plague."
15471,Look up smallpox (my Antonine plague reference) while you're at it.
15472,Look up SARS-2003 immunity duration.
15473,Look up our current science on SARS-COV-2 immunity duration.
15474,"At least the day after Biden's inauguration Fox News will start calling it the ""Biden-Harris Flu""."
15475,They'll have daily trackers for every state with fancy graphics and the ones with Dem Governors they'll interview some nut in a diner every day to talk about how much they've been failed.

15487,no thanks!
15488,"Numbers are decreasing, what?"

15511,He said he had experts.
15512,Maybe Corn pop is his expert.
15513,At this point I think the only hope for avoiding total disaster is if a vaccine is out before the end of winter.
15514,"Government is probably going to leave everyone to fend for themselves at least until January, so I wouldn't expect anything else to be able to slow this down now."
15515,If the vaccine isn't being deployed within the winter I could easily see this reaching Spanish flu level deaths in the US.

15518,Yes you‚Äôre racist.

15520,You have zero clue what Chinese people went through in order to drive the virus into near eradication.
15521,You‚Äôre stuck in your little western bubble and you couldn‚Äôt fathom sacrificing for the greater good.
15522,That is also due to baseline immunity from exposure to similar strains.
15523,You can't compare an outbreak of a brand new virus and the resurgence of an old one.
15524,Winter?

15572,I‚Äôve been tested many times and never had that kind.
15573,From what I understand the lates PCR tests can get very accurate results with only a 1‚Äù nasal swab or spit.
15574,The medical expertise of the entire world has been pushing that tech forward so it‚Äôs changing quickly and getting much better.
15575,I do as well.

15615,"People in the BLM protests were a bit more spread out, constantly moving, and masked."
15616,"Moreover, there's some evidence that they actually reduced the spread of COVI on balance (because the protests and curfews kept the vast majority of people home instead of going to restaurants, etc)."
15617,That's very different than the rallies or even the celebrations yesterday.

15725,COVID kills people with weak immune systems.
15726,People with weak immune systems tend not to generate robust immune responses to vaccines.
15727,Therefore the people COVID is most likely to hospitalize or kill are the people least likely to benefit directly from the vaccine.
15728,"This would all be well and good if it were shown that the vaccine could create immunity, and thus indirectly protect the vulnerable via herd immunity, but the trials aren't even going to show if this is possible."

15745,"&gt; I note also, you didn't answer about health insurance when travelling during a pandemic, nor acknowledge that being able to attend festivals and life in a covid negative society are freedoms of their own

15746,"For example: https://www.worldnomads.com/usa/help/insurance/recent-events/coronavirus-faqs

As for festivals - no reason they can't be hosted in a COVID society either and in fact they're slowly starting up in the US: https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-baseball-health-tim-mahoney-music-a5714cad6f397a9ec698f6bcee2a9d3b."

15808,It means people will stop giving a fuck and we'll move back to the original goal of not overwhelming hospitals instead of freaking out about cases and pretending we can eradicate the virus.

15910,And I just see my local area where everyone has given up.
15911,"In the spring when Pennsylvania had 2000 cases, the playground was essentially barricaded by police tape when now with 4000 cases, I just passed by it and it was full of kids

Next to it a soccer game was being played by 10-year-olds with no limits of parents on the sidelines

Last night I went to a pizza place that in the spring would literally have you open your front door and they would put the pizza on your front seat since you had to pay by credit over the phone."
15912,Now?

15947,You are correct.
15948,"Trump is the president until January 20, 2021."
15949,"But the Speculation is that because Trump has completely given up on doing anything about coronavirus and now not even having briefings or news conferences about it, Biden could start to hold news conferences about it with medical professionals leading the way."
15950,"He could also begin talking with governors of individual states, companies that could be used to supply more Personal protective equipment, and even start planning with companies that will distribute the vaccine."

15967,"By the March timeframe many people who had given up on behavioral restrictions will learn the hard way this winter through a personal or close family/friend that experiences death, a severe case or long hauler syndrome."
15968,These type of events will likely increase drastically as transmission is increasing exponentially in  many places around the world.
15969,"As a physician in NY, I have been in the front line, managing covid ICU, intubating covid patients."
15970,I‚Äôve worn garbage bags as my PPE in March.

15972,I have not heard Biden has any effective plan to get covid under control.

16021,"The actions are considered authoritarian in france, because our law doesn't allow the police to step inside our homes to rule out how many people can be there at a time."
16022,So starting to take measures similar to the ones set in england would be unlawful and definitely authoritarian.

16027,I was asking an honest question.

16029,Power of the purse lies solely on the lower house of congress.

16126,"It just says what we know and what we're trying to find out, and what that could mean."
16127,One addendum I would have liked for it to have is that German doctor Matin Kr√∂nke pointed out the vaccines will likely give subjects the ability to form a wider range in antibodies and a larger volume of those antibodies.
16128,"What this could mean is that the vaccine will already be giving us antibodies that can detect the new variation in Spike Protein, which is something we're trying to figure out right now."
16129,As one bit of my own personal speculation: The spike Protein on this new strand evolved to function in *Minks.
16130,* Eight of the twelve people who have been reported as having this mutation work in incredibly close proximity with minks.
16131,"Only four other people have reportedly gotten it, but again we're working off current information."
16132,"It's possible this strand evolved to function wonderfully in mink to mink transition, but it has a hard time jumping from mink to human."
16133,"That would be fantastic news, if that's the case, because it would mean this strand would be much less contagious among humans."
16134,"Again, we don't know that, it's a bit of optimistic speculation based on how I've been led to believe this protein evolved, and it's one of the thing people with much better educations and resources are trying to find out."

16211,"No, it's not."
16212,"Only about half of Europe is in the EU, and it's just a political union."
16213,"The difference between, say Sweden and Ukraine or Portugal and Russia is much larger than the differences between any U.S state."
16214,"Then if they act out, they can go to prison too."
16215,The price of being in a democracy is to follow the laws.
16216,As long as they're wearing masks it's fine.
16217,"If a grandma has to die so we can celebrate getting Fruit Man out of office, so be it."
16218,"There will be a strategy in place, just not til January 20th."
16219,No one?
16220,"I know I've seen comments about it today, and last night."
16221,I also know that the mask compliance is high in the streets.
16222,I can't vouch for the house parties.
16223,Agreed.
16224,"Especially with unknown long term effects, assuming that it‚Äôs no big deal to get the virus is very dangerous."
16225,Bats catching viruses have fuck all to do with their metabolism.
16226,"Bats harbour viruses as viruses tend to be incapable of killing bats, whilst the immune system of bats tend to be incapable of killing the virus."
16227,Thus a natural larder for viruses.
16228,Even if the planet went vegan we would always be vulnerable to viruses originating from bats specifically.
16229,"Also I'm not saying a future pandemic would come from a cat, although yknow the original SARS jumped from civet cats.. Im saying the virus is able to spread to dogs and cats, thus not fucking around with animals wouldnt eliminate the ability of COVID from jumping and mutating in those animals and spreading back to us."
16230,"So miss me with your misplaced arrogance on a subject you clearly know nothing about, especially if you genuinely believe that absolute nonsense about a bats metabolism."
16231,"I mean, I get that, and I agree, but there's a lot of baggage with simply sending him to prison."

16241,"Wake up, its all about money."
16242,Countries would rather sacrifice a portion of their citizens than go into a financial slump.
16243,It has been this way for 11 months or have you been in isolation all these while?
16244,The BLM protests are STILL HAPPENING and it is going up now!
16245,You clearly are not understanding the situation.
16246,They deserve that.
16247,They deserve hundreds of thousands of deaths until they will finally understand schools must be shut down.
16248,All of them.
16249,And other countries should not give us a single cent.
16250,I agree with the frugal countries.
16251,Italy can go to hell.
16252,Italy can bankrupt tomorrow.
16253,They don't deserve even a single bit of compassion.
16254,What an unbelievably privileged comment
16255,Box fans can overheat like that.
16256,They aren‚Äôt designed for that load
16257,I‚Äôm sure you make exceptions of your own that you justify.
16258,I‚Äôm not telling you this is a good idea.
16259,I‚Äôve been quarantining pretty seriously.
16260,But I‚Äôm just trying to reassure you a bit that masked outdoor events are safer.
16261,The masks do wonders and being outside is great.
16262,It‚Äôs like using birth control and also pulling out.
16263,"Sure it‚Äôs not as safe as just not fucking, but it‚Äôs still safer than if you didn‚Äôt use any form of protection at all."
16264,At least it's not dysentery.
16265,It's because everybody is absolutely sick of restrictions.
16266,The only reason it doesn't make sense to you is because this subreddit has convinced you that's purely a republican thing.
16267,Party responsibly but also rethink Christmas!
16268,Or he could have just been a smoker
16269,So Biden has no strategy!
16270,It's been admitted!
16271,What do you think can be done
16272,Username checks out.
16273,[deleted]
16274,"Judging by all the maskless and non-socially distanced ~~celebrations~~ super spreader events in the street that have happened since Biden was declared the victor...no, people don‚Äôt care anymore."
16275,Will be until they close schools.
16276,But they don't want to.
16277,So i guess someone is ok with hundreds of daily deaths.
16278,And at this point i am not going to stop my life until a single damn school is opened.
16279,You close the schools then you limit my freedoms.
16280,"At this point, any strategy isn‚Äôt going to work unless the people commit to it fully, and until a vaccine is produced."
16281,America‚Äôs done everything it needed to do.
16282,"Lockdown, masks and
Social distancing, mass testing it should‚Äôve ended there."
16283,"People are still going out, attending rallies, throwing get togethers and weddings, rushing football fields and having champagne parties in the streets."
16284,"That has nothing to do with the government, it‚Äôs a conscious choice by the people, and Americans need to realize that their choices are getting people killed."
16285,It‚Äôs a joke.
16286,"There's a joke about how Western Kentucky failed to secede during the American Civil War, but finding it is a lost cause."
16287,Only on the fringes.
16288,Now that he's out you can bet Twitter will be dropping him Jan 21st and somehow I don't think any of the major networks will be too interested in what he has to say anymore.
16289,He can rant all he likes but without a real platform most of us will never hear it.

I'm confident that there is no reason to fear

Go purchase a rifle by the end of this year 

If you would like to enjoy some turkey or deer

Just sit back, relax, and have yourself a beer

Before all the new taxes and regulations appear


I would say perhaps, go and roll up a joint

But the only anti-pot liberal was the one to annoint

He can't remember his name, but that's besides the point

His plan is to make the left and right one, as conjoint


Going forward, there will be one united people with a task

From now on wherever you go, you will always wear a mask

16338,"[Timestamped link to the mink information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq4k8HoRbMA&amp;t=55m36s)

- they mentioned that it didn't sound like they had proof that the virus was transmitting back to humans (""directionality"") although they sort of conceded this point as being safer to assume
- the mink being a reservoir and virus going backwards and forwards is concerning enough to do all the culling
- the presumed mink variant hasn't been seen in humans in a month
- the variation may come at a fitness cost, since it doesn't seem to be spreading widely in humans

Unfortunately they don't discuss ""pandemic 2.0"" concerns very directly in language that is accessible, and they didn't make many comments about the decreased neutralizing activity seen in the lab."
16339,They're happy that the rest of the information is sufficient to cull the minks and test everyone and that'll contain whatever risk is here.
16340,To read between the lines you'll have to note they're nowhere near as alarmed by the lab results as everyone on reddit is.
16341,And that attitude is why money exists in the first place.
16342,You need time to pass to monitor for symptoms.
16343,An RNA or DNA vaccine could present symptoms a year later.

16454,This is so concerning for the USA.
16455,"You‚Äôve got a reckless shamefully sulking lame duck president who won‚Äôt even except defeat, appears likely to spend the rest of his days in office trying to subvert/challenge the election, a looming COVID disaster quite literally created by him, an apparent president elect who can‚Äôt do anything till next year, and options for dealing with COVID on the table for Biden that probably won‚Äôt do much anyway."
16456,You guys are past the point of being able to contract trace.
16457,"You are not even in winter yet, you are still just riding the ripples of your first wave."
16458,"It is likely that only very harsh dull instruments of long total lockdowns, and eventual easing into universal mask use and strict distancing, etc, would get the wave controlled to the point of being able to contact trace your way out of it- and you are in a society where all this has been intentionally deeply politicised, will not be widely supported, and you lack the proper social welfare nets and generous stimulus required to get a populace through such anyway."
16459,I‚Äôm in Melbourne Australia.
16460,"Through months of lockdown and strict adherence to masks and other distancing stuff, and against an endless onslaught of Murdoch controlled right wing media and   politicians which wanted us to fail and rabble roused, we have actually crushed our second autumn/winter wave and it seems possibly eradicated the virus (10 days in a row of zero cases detected)."
16461,We‚Äôve done this with generous welfare payments and free healthcare and testing and a divided but majority support within the populace for the strict measures.

16463,I fear your wave that is just now building up its strength probably won‚Äôt peak for some time.
16464,"I can only wonder if the failure and disaster of naturally acquired herd immunity is going to gradually become a limiting factor, and I truly do hope you don‚Äôt have the mink ‚Äòcluster 5‚Äô strain in your country already, or some similar novel mutation either now or later (from your own mink farms or another crossover event which becomes ever more possible as the pandemic grows), because of ‚Äòcluster 5‚Äô (or a similar mutation) turns out bad then it could essentially be a whole mother seperate parallel pandemic."

16474,"Things cannot be done in the US without a law, except those explicitly granted by the constitution or other founding documents."
16475,"For a president to be able to mandate masks would require a legal framework in place for emergency management laws that would lay out exactly what steps a president or other authorized office could take, under what circumstances, for how long, etc."
16476,"In other words, it would require an act of congress."
16477,This could have been done previously but it's very hard to move a federal law through this quickly.
16478,I do believe federal laws allowing mandated mask wearing would be constitutional in an emergency but there is an argument that they are not as the federal government has limited control over the states.
16479,"Many of the states have no laws allowing a governor to institute a lockdown or mandate masks, meaning that they actually did implement illegal orders and people are technically correct saying they had no authority and could not enforce the laws."
16480,Other states have emergency management laws in place which would have allowed a governor or health department to do so.
16481,I appreciate a healthy cynicism for government control and overstepping authority.
16482,"I just wish people would have that same energy for things like wasting taxpayer dollars, mass incarceration, the war on drugs etc."
16483,and realize that masks are one of those things we should all do whether or not it's mandated.
16484,"First of all, I never insulted you so get off your high horse and respect others if you want some respect."

16489,"Then we will wait until there are better ways to treat it, there could be a better, fast test that would detect who has the virus, if there is a reliable test, then that could be another way to go."
16490,"Also, there are several countries that managed to control the infection numbers, they would be welcome to Australia, we are already receiving New Zealand travellers, many countries in Asia have the virus under control, we could open a travel bubble."
16491,"For the rest of the world, if they want to come here, then a 2 week quarantine will be the option."
16492,"It is already happening, several production companies are filming movies in Australia currently, they followed strict quarantine rules upon arrival and once cleared, are free to work here."
16493,Did everyone at the Biden victory celebrations quarantine for 14 days before and will do so after?
16494,And it was the left saying those people are killing people and then they go and do shit like that.

16500,"Also, the UK is an island, and it undeniably failed badly, but London's contacts with continental Europe are far more intense than those of Australia with any other landmass."

16536,"Transcript if you get a paywall:

&gt;Victoria's achievement in bringing down daily coronavirus numbers from 700 new cases a day in August to none in the past 10 days has led Ireland and other European countries to seek our experts' advice on how the state did it."
16537,"&gt;  
&gt;Introducing measures including a five-kilometre travel limit, an 8pm to 5am curfew, and school and business shutdowns, are now being eyed by northern hemisphere countries as their case numbers climb rapidly."
16538,"&gt;  
&gt;On Sunday, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said he had been asked by authorities in Ireland to host a ""virtual town hall"" next week, which other European countries would join, to learn how Victoria had stemmed its second-wave outbreak."
16539,"&gt;  
&gt;So what will he tell them?"
16540,How did we manage to achieve such a steep drop in cases?
16541,"&gt;  
&gt;""If there are lessons for anyone, it is that it's achievable, and the real benefit is getting to those sustainable low numbers, and using the lessons you've learnt over that period of time to keep them there,"" Professor Sutton said."
16542,"&gt;  
&gt;Minimising the huge risk factors in sectors such as aged care ‚Äì the setting in which almost all of Victoria's 819 COVID-19 deaths have occurred ‚Äì was another major lesson, he said."
16543,"&gt;  
&gt;""We've obviously learnt a lot about what the challenging settings were,'' he said."
16544,"''Aged care \[is\] enormously vulnerable, and those amplifying environments of abattoirs and food distribution centres and other warehouse centres with a large working population who are very mobile."""
16545,"&gt;  
&gt;Professor Sutton said Melbourne's lockdown was only one of a range of measures that had helped drive down our tally."
16546,"&gt;  
&gt;""Stage four restrictions are not the science ‚Äì that was the tool that was used,"" he said."
16547,"&gt;  
&gt;""But the lesson from Melbourne is everything that we did in that time as we drove numbers down."
16548,"The way that we worked on the turnaround time for pathology testing, the way that we worked on reducing the time for case and contact management and outbreak management, the agent-based modelling that has informed where we get to and how we get there ‚Äì all of those things were shared with the Health Minister and other public health experts in Ireland."""
16549,"&gt;  
&gt;Despite all those efforts, some experts said Victoria would never get to zero new COVID-19 daily cases."
16550,"However, the recent record run of ""doughnut days"" has proved that wrong."
16551,"&gt;  
&gt;The transition to successive days of no new cases has been so dramatic that there are signs the state might be on the path to eliminating the virus, some epidemiologists believe."
16552,"However, the government has been at pains to state that its policy is not one of elimination, and that even talking about it is dangerous."
16553,"&gt;  
&gt;Instead, testing chief Jeroen Weimar has characterised the policy as one of ""aggressive suppression"", and warned that Victoria was ""not heading for elimination and no one should think we are on top of this‚Äù."
16554,"&gt;  
&gt;Victoria's tenth consecutive day of zero new cases on Monday marks the state‚Äôs longest COVID-free run since February."
16555,"&gt;  
&gt;There were just four active cases in Victoria as of Monday, down from a peak of 6767 on August 8."
16556,But that does not mean Victorians should start thinking it's all over.
16557,"&gt;  
&gt;As he announced the further easing of restrictions on Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews said that while it was a day to celebrate, it was also a reminder to remain cautious."
16558,"""The most important thing of all that all of us has to do is to stay the course on this, to be as stubborn as the virus,"" he said."
16559,"&gt;  
&gt;""But no one can assume that because ... we have had nine days of zero (on Sunday), it is gone and somehow those numbers are the same as a vaccine against this deadly virus."
16560,They are not.
16561,"&gt;  
&gt;""I am really confident that all of the work that has been done to get us here will be maintained and it will keep us in a place where we can continue to open up, have rules that drive more economic activity, more social freedom, a greater connectedness with the people we have missed the most."""
16562,"&gt;  
&gt;Despite the caution, there is the sense that Victoria has witnessed a massive turnaround from just two weeks ago, when many were dismissive of the state‚Äôs chances of reaching zero."
16563,"&gt;  
&gt;Professor Sutton said at the time that Victoria‚Äôs last remaining cases had been among ‚Äúthe trickiest in the world‚Äù to beat."
16564,"&gt;  
&gt;But rather than having a ""stubborn tail"", as Professor Sutton repeatedly described it, Victoria‚Äôs epidemic curve shows our highest peak was followed by an equally sharp drop."
16565,"&gt;  
&gt;The daily number of Victorians who tested positive peaked at 725 on August 5."
16566,"Two weeks later, the number was down to 208; two weeks after that it was 87."
16567,"&gt;  
&gt;In the first two weeks of October, the state averaged fewer than 10 cases a day."
16568,The first zero day since the second wave was on October 26.
16569,"&gt;  
&gt;That was driven by dramatic improvements in contact tracing, not just by months of lockdown and mandatory mask wearing, according to Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the University of South Australia."
16570,"&gt;  
&gt;""Victoria has only done what all the other states and territories have been able to do apart from NSW ‚Äì which is get to zero and keep it there,"" he said."
16571,"&gt;  
&gt;Elimination ‚Äì no circulating virus in Victoria ‚Äì was a real possibility, he said."
16572,"But to know it was gone for sure, Professor Esterman wanted to see at least 28 days of zero cases."
16573,"&gt;  
&gt;Professor Tony Blakely, one of the authors of the modelling that underpinned the Victorian government's virus response, said much of the credit should go to the decision not to reopen from lockdown until cases were averaging five a day or fewer, as well as ""top notch contact tracing ... and, of course, a good dose of luck""."
16574,"&gt;  
&gt;Dr Jason Thompson, a computational social scientist who built the modelling used by the Victorian government, said his scenarios had showed a sharp drop to elimination, rather than a stubborn tail, was always possible."
16575,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe common wisdom is that it‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù he said."
16576,‚ÄúThe government was saying this was something that was not possible.
16577,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBut every time I built a model, we were able to get it down to zero."
16578,"If you have the controls in place, it will go to zero.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;So long as you can identify, trace and isolate the contacts of an infected person, you can eliminate the virus, Dr Thompson said."
16579,"&gt;  
&gt;The threat, however, is far from over."
16580,"The virus continues to circulate in NSW, while leaks from quarantine are a constant threat."
16581,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe will see a resurgence if we have incursions,"" Dr Thompson said."
16582,"""You look around the world and the successful countries are island nations or those with tight border controls."
16583,"We‚Äôre not going to have absolutely-impervious borders.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;A high testing rate is another tool that can help show how many cases there are in the community."
16584,"&gt;  
&gt;Victoria has tested more than 13,500 people a day on average for the past two weeks ‚Äì more than twice the number in early June, when the seeds of the second wave were planted."
16585,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt means these continuing zero days are giving us a strong signal that we have little undetected virus out there,‚Äù said Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University."
16586,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúTime to switch our focus to prevention strategies to protect this, and step up the sentinel surveillance to catch any last cases that may be out there, and detect new cases as borders open up.‚Äù"
16587,"Yes, I can tell you first hand it happens."
16588,Shitty air makes you more likely to die of lung failure?
16589,Shocking.

16604,"It's not a fix all, but it helps quite a bit."
16605,The feds withhold federal highway funds from the states if they haven't enacted mandatory seatbelt laws.
16606,Same with the DUI threshold of 0.08% BAC.
16607,Most states changed their laws to avoid losing the funds.
16608,They could provide the same incentives/disincentives to states to try to reduce COVID cases.
16609,"It really is alarming that we have people continually saying ""They're idiots, incompetent, they don't believe in science,"" when it is clear the reality is ""No, they understand the science and are actively choosing to let it be this bad because they lack basic empathy to care who dies and also believe they can benefit from a crumbling economy."""
16610,We can't fix this if we aren't blunt about the need for urgency.
16611,At least he‚Äôll try instead of ignoring a pandemic üôÑ
16612,Well.
16613,At least now there will be a strategy.
16614,The strategy of doing SOMETHING.
16615,Which will be leaps and bounds ahead of whatever was done before.
16616,Which was nothing.
16617,when did the president elect say he wasn't going to allow normalcy until then?
16618,How about he start by condemning large gatherings for him on the streets and in private residences?
16619,I wish everyone there health and safety!
16620,It does not matter.
16621,It's still unconstitutional.
16622,Any attempt to do so would be nullified by the states that don't want to do it.
16623,"And even in states where there is a mask mandate, police are effectively nullifying it."
16624,Federalism is the only thing holding the union together at all.
16625,"If you want to toss the rest of it out, for the sake of nationalism and probable violence have at it."
16626,What do you mean?
16627,If the coronavirus doesn't spread at democrat approved riots it won't at democrat approved celebrations right?
16628,We should be safe until the celebrations end at the very least
16629,"Our strategy was to elect Joe Biden so we have an administration that listens to scientists and comes up with a plan, finally."
16630,Yes.
16631,A business could refuse service but never attempt to enforce it (including security guards).
16632,"Nothing is going to stop this virus, not in the near future."
16633,Anyone that says otherwise is a liar or lacks intellect.
16634,That doesn't mean we shouldn't do what we can.
16635,This leads one to believe that other people with cancer or other exceptional circumstances may be reservoirs for the virus for weeks.
16636,The magical 4 week stay at home order that would kill the spread would actually just delay it.
16637,It‚Äôd be interesting the biology of the people on HIV treatment.

16642,A lot of people tend to forget severe disease can put you on your back for months.
16643,&gt; Each of these countries had 2nd breakouts in certain areas and they lockdown those states or City.
16644,"So did Germany, to name one among the many."
16645,"Problem is, once again, that Germany borders eight different countries and can't control every single arrival, so the moment you lockdown one area you get potential cases from another country which infect another area and then another area and another area...until everything goes out of control again."
16646,"It's very interesting actually, you can literally see the virus propagating from borders to the center of Germany just by looking at the daily RKI reports from September onwards."
16647,"Case in point Saxony, previously among the best performing German states, now one of the most affected as it borders both Poland and Czech Republic where the spread is completely out of control right now."
16648,So much for covid safe sets ...
16649,This is such a bad comparison.
16650,"Mink innate, primary and secondary immune response is completely different than humans and the evolutionary pressures on the virus are entirely different in a mink population vs a human population regardless of if the populations size."

16661,At what point do I consider ER?
16662,Everyone is praising Biden and how his supporters are so responsible about COVID.
16663,I just thought it was funny how people are praising him yet he hasn‚Äôt condemned that shit.
16664,Rules for thee but not for me.
16665,Yep - hence why I like to ask for specificity.
16666,Usually the burden of searching for proof to support nonsense arguments/viewpoints proves too great...
16667,Yea well they're .0001% and .00001 quintillionth chance of death mumble mumble etc
16668,Looks like coronavirus disappeared since Joe Biden got in i see people by the thousands throwing party‚Äôs.
16669,"Not really, they wear masks for the most part unlike the mini Nuremberg rallies that Trump held for trailer trash."
16670,My family is planning an outdoors thanksgiving come hell or high water.
16671,"We‚Äôre trying to follow guidelines as much as possible, and in addition to our numbers being much smaller this year, we‚Äôre making a lot of adjustments:

- Big tarp that covers the big patio
- Couple of fancy rented propane heaters
- Basic ground rules about wearing a mask whenever you aren‚Äôt actively eating or drinking (my mom is even making fun matching ones), and using hand sanitizer before handing serving utensils 
- Instead of one big table, we‚Äôre sitting at smaller tables only with our immediate family members, and using all disposable dinnerware (and using biodegradable wherever possible)
- We‚Äôre also all going to do our best to get tested ahead of time and isolate before the holiday

It‚Äôs gonna looks different, but this is pretty much our super bowl of holidays, so anything we‚Äôre able to do is going to be better than missing out completely."

16691,"I must say, the fact they're *outside*, and *wearing masks* helps, but it's still not good."
16692,I don't understand the relevance of that statement.
16693,"I have seen ""2 time the confirmed cases, 3-5 in some regions"" from someone who have a history of knowing what they are talking about on the scientific sister subreddit."
16694,&gt;White noted that this does not mean conservatives only care about themselves.
16695,"Rather, they simply ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see their behaviors as impacting others.‚Äù

""I'm not selfish because my selfishness doesn't affect you."""
16696,"The mink strain may have some resistance to antibodies, not T cells."
16697,It does allow it if there were have not been travel between regions/ areas.
16698,"In March, they should have lockdown urban areas and isolate the rural areas as they didn‚Äôt have many cases and masks/ social distancing/ tracing would have work."
16699,But there was no strategy and none wanting to even try.
16700,"Also there are a bunch of people who were appointed who were Trump ""loyalists"" including current cabinet members on down but they just did what they did to get a high profile position, they aren't going to actively cause a huge mess sabotaging their departments just for Trump now that he's out in 2 months, they are looking for their next job now."
16701,"It's possible, but neither currently favors the Democrat, unfortunately."
16702,"I can finally get my license on January 20th, and that won‚Äôt even be what I‚Äôm excited for!"

16706,I consider that to be voter suppression.
16707,I'm sorry that your rights were taken away because of mistakes you made in the past.

16712,El Paso is bad because we never got as bad as the other major cities in Texas.
16713,Texas started reopening when we hadn‚Äôt even peaked yet.
16714,Then school started and that‚Äôs what started really hurting us.
16715,"Also, I know of five households that got infected because one person in each was working on base"
16716,I definitely have left-wing friends who take the pandemic very seriously in a public manner (i.e.
16717,"wearing masks in public, posting photos wearing masks), but then when they get together privately with their own friends or non-household family, the masks come off, whether indoors or outdoors."
16718,"These are well-meaning people, but somehow think their own close friends and family are immune from spreading the virus."
16719,When you're going to argue your point using math.

16725,And now this state is doing pretty well.
16726,Much better than Mississippi or Alabama or Texas.
16727,And certainly a *helluva* lot better than Florida.
16728,The main reason Tampa is facing big problems now is that the state is run by right-wing pandemic-denying idiots who refuse to take the obvious and necessary steps.
16729,So I repeat: No sympathy.
16730,I remember that at the time.
16731,"It was no rumor, it happened."
16732,I literally misread the title as saying exactly that lmao.
16733,It works that well.
16734,Honestly fauci needs a vacation
16735,He is.
16736,But there is work to do for the incoming president which would be to develop a plan that will hit the ground running on day one.
16737,"They have to develop relationships with all of the relevant agencies and outside groups, including those developing the vaccines."
16738,They don't want a moment where theres no national strategy in play.
16739,This is just the unfortunate circumstances of impromptu jubilant celebration of the election win.
16740,Too much on the mind this past week with election anxiety to even think about the anxiety of coronavirus.
16741,"Unfortunately, we will be dealing with the fallout of this soon."
16742,Just getting media attention from a leader that is actively leading will be big.
16743,Even without policy he can make an impact.
16744,"Stfu wagie, think of the children!"
16745,/s
16746,This is denial of the highest order.
16747,‚ÄúThat had nothing to do with the spread.‚Äù  Dude.
16748,Really?
16749,Cuomo actively killed the elderly in his state via policy.
16750,It‚Äôs common knowledge.
16751,Holy fuck Imagine having a competent task force that is listened to by the administration
16752,They don‚Äôt actually care about making the world better.
16753,They only care about the aesthetics of politics.
16754,It‚Äôs a sport to them.
16755,And I thought we were the side of science.
16756,America is fucking doomed ü§£ü§£ü§£
16757,Nah.
16758,"Well, I should be tough and stringy then."
16759,I've been a tense mess since this pandemic started.
16760,He doesn‚Äôt have that power.
16761,Yeah - I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago.
16762,"The weather is super nice right now, which isn‚Äôt helping."
16763,I walked my girls to a nearby park and there were about 60+ people playing and acting like nothing was going on.
16764,Not a single parent or kid had a mask.
16765,A full 5 on 5 full contact basketball game going on with no masks.
16766,"I turned the kids around and headed back home, Illinois is fucked."
16767,And this is a very progressive area so can‚Äôt blame Trump anti-maskers.
16768,Seems odd doesn‚Äôt it.
16769,Social gatherings seem to be the culprit right now and you have victory parades all over the country with many not wearing masks.
16770,We have been told we are killing grandma if we gather for Thanksgiving but thousands together at these events not a word.
16771,Where is the outrage?
16772,The double standard is really hard to deal with.
16773,First executive order
16774,"Keep him in an advisory role but keep him out of the spotlight, the man and his family have suffered enough."
16775,You don‚Äôt know this mutation is gone.
16776,What if it actually is a superior variant with respect to transmission?
16777,Clearly if Denmark is willing to cull its entire mink farm operation they see it as a potentially serious issue.
16778,"And, yes, there are a lot of mutations and thankfully thousands of variants are already catalogued because of the great work of people who do that for a living."
16779,"So when something like this pops up, we are ready to take action."
16780,"Bobs probably the better bet overall, honestly"
16781,"Trump did not remove the bust of MLK, it was a mistaken tweet."
16782,"It also seems there has been two Churchill busts, one original, one that was made as a temporary replacement, and Obama did remove one of them and replaced it with MLK (citing not enough room rather than any anti-churchill sentiment) and still had one of the busts ""outside the door of the treaty room""."
16783,"Trump may have moved some or all of those busts, but they were not replaced by each other."

16785,School is a priority and shouldn‚Äôt not close if possible.
16786,Anyway the 2nd wave started during August when there was no school.
16787,It started spreading fast just before school reopening in September.
16788,Not to forget the incidence rate for kids aged 0-9 is still low in France so the impact of schools on the spread of the virus seems low.
16789,This isn‚Äôt one of the biggest problem.
16790,"there is a remote chance the senate ties

if that happens, VP Harris can make appearance after appearance to break the vote which I am not sure will be great for her career or bad

the only good thing about a tie is that MoscowMitch can no longer ram federal judges though anymore"
16791,Absolutely not.
16792,We deserve to celebrate our freedom.
16793,Mongolia is the least dense population in the world.
16794,"I‚Äôll give you Vietnam, they were just good"
16795,"While I am neither american nor black, I believe the BBM protests to happen when they did was important, even if that meant doing it during a pandemic."
16796,Perfect timing?
16797,"Certainly not, but I totally understand why, after all that happened this past spring, they did not want to wait out the pandemic to do something about the injustice."
16798,That's my outside view anyway
16799,Live Virus opened for them late last year
16800,VP breaks ties.
16801,"It would be tenuous, and Biden would be beholden to the most conservative Democrat, but they would get stuff done."
16802,"Uh...COVID-19 was considered one of the top issues to voters, and Joe Biden has mentioned plans for COVID-19 as well."
16803,[removed]
16804,Forget your meds this morning buddy?
16805,As it should be.
16806,At last.
16807,"Masks aren't enough:

- Covid spreads through aerosols, which quickly saturate rooms with poor ventilation

- Surgical masks reduce the speed at which we breath in aerosols, but don't stop them

- Properly fitted and functioning N95 masks effectively stop aerosols, but most people who even have an N95 aren't wearing it properly (beards, poor fitment, reusing multiple times) (basically everyone outside the medical profession isn't wearing their N95s properly, if they even have them)

To beat Covid, you need:

- social distancing: people simply must avoid being in the same room breathing the same air

- ventilation: if social distancing can't be had, then rooms must be well ventilated to diffuse aerosols as much as possible, and meeting times should be reduced to as short as possible to both reduce the saturation of aerosols and the quantity breathed in

- prompt and proper contact tracing and quarantine: right now we're overwhelmed and can't do this, but ideally each case would be thoroughly tracked down and each potential contact isolated until they can be checked"

16822,The massive crowds of people in the streets must not have gotten the memo.
16823,"&gt; That had nothing to do with the spread, because it was put into place bc the strain on the hospital system and the reality that the virus was already in nursing homes."
16824,"It had nothing to do with it, but it we did it because we had to?"
16825,"If people are young, healthy, and don't mind taking the risk, then no, I don't think people should be stopped from going."
16826,"I would go, but that is my choice."

16828,A government controlling us is generally not a good thing.
16829,Fauci has deserved a rest.
16830,He should just go back to NIAID.
16831,There are two senate seats up for grabs in Georgia in a run off election in January.
16832,If they can get people to turn out and vote the Democrats can win the senate.
16833,"I'm just saying there's no need to downplay this, these people are almost as dumb as the Trumpists except they wear masks."
16834,"Didn't say these would be super spreader events, just that people are definitely going to catch the virus by going to these things and that is a terrible look when you just had a record week of cases."
16835,Super good idea.
16836,Unfortunately a growing number of fatalists feel like they have to destroy Earth since they are gonna die anyway.
16837,Just don't make the same mistake Trump did and start making US Foreign Policy before you're sworn in.
16838,"The indications from other parts of the Western world are that highly infectious diseases like this cannot really be 'controlled' without the potentially larger economic calamity of severe lockdowns, the end of which just bring more waves of the virus."
16839,The US is essentially not able to deal with something like Covid.
16840,"It needs to face something with apocalyptic death rates like Ebola to make things simple in justifying a national lockdown, otherwise it can never justify shutting down people in Colorado or Oklahoma when something like Covid breaks out in New York."
16841,"Fortunately for small countries out here in Europe, a breakout in Amsterdam does justify a national lockdown in the Netherlands."
16842,The gigantic size and regional diversity of the US just doesn't allow for this.
16843,I am thinking more about the poor animals having to be constantly slaughtered on a mass scale for fur.
16844,Are you talking about the same mitch that has been holding up said stimulus for the past 6 months?
16845,"Hard to believe 

Genuine question though, where are you getting your information?"

16860,I‚Äôd forgotten.
16861,Giving out a stimulus is a lot more of a positive than the deficit which barely anyone understands.
16862,Mitch will now make sure it happens on Trumps watch.
16863,Guess we are all getting Christmas presents!
16864,And that's why Ebola's endemic globally!!
16865,!1 oh wait no I'm wrong we eliminate it each and every time it pops up

16873,"Go to a restaurant, wear a mask when you're away from your table."
16874,Spend 99% of your time at the table with no mask.
16875,Is that a bearable sacrifice?
16876,Every case counts.
16877,"Biden  already failing as future president look at all those democrats gather together in washington DC,New York City."
16878,This is what literally any of our past Presidents would have done immediately.

16881,Interesting the.... oh look a butterfly
16882,"We need a national mask mandate, indoors and outdoors."
16883,Only a few species are vulnerable enough to COVID that it spreads quickly through the population *and* can be transmitted back to humans.
16884,They're basically all closely related to mink and ferrets.

16897,No seat belt!
16898,?
16899,"But they‚Äôre not social distancing, based on pics and videos I‚Äôve seen."
16900,Wearing a mask alone won‚Äôt stop Covid.
16901,Good luck though it‚Äôs insane to me that people would willingly go out and celebrate in large crowds when you‚Äôre seeing new records everyday.
16902,&gt; Stay strong dude!
16903,FTFY fellow Chielan
16904,I don‚Äôt understand the point you‚Äôre trying to make in response to mine.
16905,[deleted]
16906,You are direct generally.
16907,Biden is but sworn in until January 20th.
16908,The radon for the large amount of time between the election and swearing in (and it used to be longer than now)is for a transition to take place.
16909,Biden will have to assemble a calmer and advisors and get everyone purists so they can fully function on day 1 prepared to start the job.
16910,"They also often begin preliminary work on initiatives they want to diminish early,such as finally having a coordinated national response to a pandemic."
16911,France said a few days ago they assume they have 100k daily cases so this is a common issue.
16912,And yet there are legal consequences for not wearing a seat belt.
16913,"It‚Äôs pretty relevant, you referenced workers, I gave you a stat about them, if you want we can go off of anyone who died that didnt rely on the government for 80%+ of their income over the age of 65, it‚Äôd be even higher."
16914,I was being generous tbh because even including people under the age of 65 that died it was still over 100 grand on average.
16915,"And to answer you question, rich people do not have access to a cure, they may have access to more comfortable treatment but it‚Äôs the same treatment overall, a ventilator is a ventilator."
16916,"Its not ""dehumanizing"" when applied to pigs, bro."
16917,Shut the front door!!
16918,Lmfao!!!
16919,Kick starting the Biden apology tour.
16920,Paging u/yaolilylu
16921,"Yep and it‚Äôs not just celebrations regarding Joe Biden if that‚Äôs what you mean, an entire crowd just stormed the field after Notre Dame defeated Clemson and my golly did it look like COVID-19‚Äôs wet dream."
16922,The coverage I see in Europe usually makes the effort to translate absolute numbers into incidence rates for comparison.
16923,But not when it comes to the USA; we just announce 'world record' levels.
16924,"Since the second week of October, Europe even has more absolute cases than the USA,  but that is not publicised much either."
16925,"Perhaps now that the media has done their hatchet job on Mr. Trump, we might expect some more balanced reporting."
16926,"We have been jeering at Trump and pointing the finger for months now, as though we were something better."
16927,As we like to say in Germany - if you point a finger at someone else there are three pointing back at yourself!

16929,"Nazi Germany implemented the ""Final Solution"" to protect the Jews?"
16930,From what?
16931,Jesus fucking christ...what the actual fuck are they teaching in schools?
16932,It certainly isn't history.
16933,The entire fucking motive behind the formation of the Nazi party was to eliminate the Jews who Germany blamed for all their problems.
16934,Genocide may not have been the first option but it certainly was the final one.
16935,&gt;So you are saying that liberals who typically advocate for social justice and equality even at personal risk to themselves don't care about others?
16936,"Social justice is mostly for justice boners, feeling superior and satisfaction from lynching someone no matter the facts or logic."
16937,"&gt;some transgenered stuff about only being 2 genders


it was regarding compelled speech laws in Canada, the first of their kind in English common law."
16938,it had little to nothing to do with trans people and everything to do with the precedent that law would set for future compelled speech laws.
16939,"of course just as I will be denounced by the radical left with a billion downvotes, he was as well with the banshees screaming about right wing dog whistles, transphobia and bigotry as if the idea of a nuanced conversation about any topic is a thing of the past."
16940,"for the record, JP went on record to state that if someone asked to be called by certain pronouns he would respect their wishes with the caveat that so long as he deemed them to be legitimate and not a childish power grab by the blue haired non binary attention seeking folks."

16974,6 months after a Phase II is more than enough for an inactivated vaccine that is this basic - you seem to be perpetuating the anti-vaxx theory that vaccines lie latent in your system for a year and then present adverse effects like GBS when that's simply not how it works.

17055,But this article/video clip is a great example.
17056,"The title suggests that Trump is flat out calling the virus a hoax, which I have heard claimed a million times now."
17057,"But when you watch the clip Trump says the democrats are saying his COVID response is ‚Äúnot good‚Äù, this is what he refers to as the hoax, comparing it their attempted impeachment."

17074,"The House passed a $2.2T bill, the WH suggested they'd support a $1.8T bill."
17075,(The different costs are due to a sticking point on State and Local funding.)
17076,Trump himself talked about big spending bills (probably because it would help his popularity).
17077,"Hmm, what's going on in the Senate?"
17078,"Their biggest proposals, which struggle to find unified Republican support, are less than half of what the other two houses are fighting over."

17099,"&gt;they should have lockdown urban areas and isolate the rural areas 

Are you really considering what you are saying here?"
17100,How could you isolate and lockdown the US (or play whack-a-mole with breakouts in different states) for any length of time and expect this to kill the virus?
17101,"The US has a gigantic array of urban areas with unusually dysfunctional and non-compliant citizens in both urban and rural settings, and they could not be locked down for the length of time to even approach a Covid 0 reality."
17102,"Minus that reality, try 'track and trace' with hundreds of millions of people."
17103,"The US cannot properly control this virus, and I think people will be surprised how little difference a man who 'listens to science' and sets up task forces will make to this disease before a vaccine."

17350,I guess pain or they just can't.
17351,I was supposed to do 3 cycles but started getting very dizzy after the 2nd one.
17352,I guess I didn't drink enough water.

17355,He's a billionare anyways its not even worth the time for filing even if he was garunteed it would go through
17356,Can we stop coming for these college kids specifically when there were nation wide celebrations of Biden winning?
17357,It‚Äôs just too blatantly biased
17358,Winter is coming.
17359,And many will get infected.
17360,That‚Äôs the dumbest thing you can do.
17361,It‚Äôll be an economic catastrophe.
17362,And it‚Äôll make the democrats look really bad.

17368,"Also, looks like quite a few have them under the nose."
17369,&gt;on Facebook were posting about how they were going to throw their masks away the second he wins.
17370,"So, honestly it would've just sped up the spread."

17379,There is some  stuff he can do before January.
17380,He doesn't have any power but he can still get ready for when he does.
17381,Its pretty standard for presidents to work on the plans during the trasition period instead of sitting on their hands for 2 months.

17406,Why?
17407,Just so he can tell us not to wear masks again?
17408,They are now killing them all.
17409,Is it possible that the media's obsession with health has gotten a lot of people to take their vitamins and wash their hands?
17410,I'm sure there are many other things that reduce the severity of the virus that a health conscious population might be into.
17411,I would like to know if there's any way we could measure that.

17423,Is there any way of validating what the electoral college votes are as of now?

17425,"Are the electoral college votes been cast, collected and counted as of yet?"
17426,"He has no official power until January, so he can't do anything with federal funding yet."
17427,"New strain is gonna make its way into the us, if it's resistant to vaccine, i think we are doomed."
17428,Wrong.
17429,How could I spread it if we are both wearing a mask?
17430,Pull your head out of your ass.
17431,It‚Äôs sad that sometimes wild populations of animals have to be culled in order to stop a disease spreading.
17432,Around 10-20 years ago the Hong Kong government basically culled all stray dogs to eradicate rabies.
17433,"It was effective of course, and rabies is a deadly disease, but still sucks :/"
17434,"Living life may be trivial to you, it's not to others."
17435,I imagine a big part of the Biden virus response plan relies on a vaccine being approved before the inauguration.
17436,I fully expect cases to be at their all time high by the time he's in office.
17437,"Considering the limited powers of the executive branch, I think the big test of his response will be how fast his administration can distribute a hypothetical vaccine that's highly effective and isn't resisted by any mutated strands."
17438,We'll have to see.
17439,"I'm hoping to God he can pull it off, I want to go back to what we had in 2019 at much as anyone, but the uncertainty is scary to me."
17440,As far as I know Biden hasn't spoken much about a hypothetical reopening of the country or getting back to normal after a vaccine comes out.
17441,"I can appreciate that his messaging is focused on harm reduction, but as a leader he needs to keep us optimistic."
17442,"When most of his messaging is about new restrictions and slowing the spread, it does make people lose hope and that makes people stop caring."
17443,That's the situation whether we like it or not.
17444,"Years of having to listen to this ""don't believe the words they say"" magical thinking crap."
17445,"I'm sorry, stop being psychotic, leave the cult."
17446,Words mean what words mean.

17457,"&gt; all jobs are essential

17465,"What's essential is the housing, food, education, etc."
17466,that the paychecks from those jobs provide for.
17467,But a competent society would be quite able to use taxes to continue to distribute the resources we provide for those jobs to those people even though they cannot do those jobs right now.
17468,And I have a tough time believing all these people without work and not getting these paychecks are hanging out at a store they can't afford things at.

17538,What other shady animal business i don't know that's happening right now elsewhere in the world?
17539,I didn't know the governments in the west would be so incompetent at fighting the pandemic.
17540,"To be honest, if the virus actually originated from some place other than china, be it Europe or usa, let alone Africa or south east asia, i have absolutely no confidence that it would have been detected and reported by those governments given how broken their pandemic response mechanism is and how miserably they have performed at controlling the virus."
17541,"All those circumstancial evidence that i dismissed vehemently before suddenly made more sense, things like, 

Europe finding covid dna in sewage water collected in early 2019, 

the strain of virus found in Europe is the genetic precursor of the virus found in china,  

How usa had much worse flu season the year before with much higher death rate

How statistically Europe and USA seemed to have abnormally high positivity rate comparing to the rest of the world even at the very beginning of the outbreak (as if the virus had been circulating in those places for much longer), (remember the more test you do your positivity rate should go down)."
17542,"I know most above is just bullshit, but still, my skeptism is growing."
17543,"&gt;It was because hospital capacity was constrained...

That's a lot different than saying, to quote you two posts back:

&gt;That had nothing to do with the spread"
17544,Doing nothing has a higher economic impact.
17545,It is not a coincidence that economists have agreed among them and with health officials about covid: control it as soon as possible and take extraordinary measures to achieve that.
17546,China economy is growing this year at the end because they control the virus and got a huge boost in the last 4 months of the year.
17547,Sure they will only grow 2% or so compared to their usual rates (almost double digits consistently).
17548,But 7 percentage points is a lower damage than what the US will have in 2020.
17549,Yeah we should only abuse and mistreat animals for good reasons like being able to eat burgers

17572,Getting the young infected takes them out of the pool of spreaders when they recover.

17574,"Regardless, even if that were not true, locking down a population has huge economic and personal costs."
17575,"If the only objective is stopping COVID, then sure, ignore those costs and lockdown."
17576,"Because we don't live in a world where we can ignore that, we have to consider where we are taking from the economy to help the public health."
17577,I think that letting people balance the risks themselves is the best way to find that out.

17642,It was because hospital capacity was constrained... the spread had already happened such that no nursing home could do anything but presume they were exposed regardless.
17643,"Media does not care now, as predicted."
17644,Hi from Australia.
17645,We have had 8 days in a row of 0 COVID cases after having almost 700 a day.
17646,It is actually possible to reduce the spread of the virus!
17647,Hope this gives some hope to you all.
17648,Okay but what if doing that thing was good for everyone?
17649,My organic intelligence back of the envelope analysis shows the same.
17650,You moved a couple of decimal points.
17651,"23,399/83 million is .0002819 of the population."
17652,That's a decimal.
17653,Change it over to a percentage and it's .02819%.
17654,Times that by 60 and you get...~1.7%.
17655,You're underestimating it by a couple orders of magnitude because you forgot to convert your decimal into a percentage.

17661,Nope.
17662,Now that Biden is President it‚Äôs just not going to be talked about.
17663,"And when it is mentioned, the goto line will be ‚Äúwell he‚Äôs doing the best he can‚Äù blah blah blah."
17664,It was all political and Biden built his campaign solely on the dead.
17665,Pretty fucked up.
17666,Scienticians have already proved that outdoor protests and celebrations don‚Äôt cause covid if they are for a cause they agree with.
17667,Rejoice!
17668,Is that like a quesadilla?
17669,"Being near others outdoors is supposed to be safer than indoors, something they were using to make voting safer."

17729,"But the thing is we often get articles like that, things pop up in Asia all the time and usually, they do fizzle out before it spreads too far."
17730,I'm not saying governments didn't have more information and possibly should have acted nor am I saying that China didn't possibly deliberately keep a lid on it hoping that they could contain it and play it down.
17731,What I am saying is that for your everyday Joe it wasn't really popping up in MSM as possibly concerning until late January.
17732,I know I began making decisions not to go to a large yearly gathering in early February but that's with the caveat I had surgery coming up in late February and couldn't risk getting sick.

17877,Here is an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/trump-coronavirus-statements/) that highlights some choice Trump quotes after the travel ban that give the exact wrong message to the public and likely contributed to a lacking effort in slowing the spread.

18008,"The President has a lot of power to set policy, but many policies are executed through cabinet members' departments, like the Secretary of the Interior."
18009,"Well guess what, each cabinet member must be approved by the Senate... so must the Attorney General, head of the FBI, etc etc."
18010,If the Senate wanted to play hardball they could prevent every such appointment from being the kind of person that would work in opposition to GOP wishes.
18011,"With the crooked GOP Senate approving the attorney general, for example, no criminals from the past administration would be investigated."
18012,"(Buuut, there is a way for the President to put in an ""acting"" cabinet member, but only for a temporary period."
18013,"Trump abused this power repeatedly, there is at least one illegal cabinet member right now.)"
18014,"They could even keep appointees from being placed at all, which would be unprecedented outside SCOTUS."
18015,"Considering how nasty our politics have been, I expect to see some really nasty fights and unprecedented Senatorial roadblocks and full exploration of ""acting"" appointments."
18016,"Biden can create Executive Orders, though."
18017,"EOs are not laws, but they change how laws are interpreted or enforced."
18018,For example Trump can write an EO that stops the EPA from prosecuting companies that dump toxic waste into rivers.
18019,(I think he did literally that.)
18020,Biden can reverse that EO and start enforcing that law again.
18021,This is an enormous power that cannot be challenged outside the courts.
18022,So much can get back to normal with masks.
18023,The good ones too.
18024,I hope he has an executive order lined up to order some companies to make N95 masks immediately or the materials and set a goal to bring the cost down to $1/mask with subsidies if nessary.

18128,"Mask compliance seems pretty good at today's gatherings, social distancing - varies from event to event based on what I've seen."
18129,People are a little more outraged at one side for all the maskless people seen at 45's rallies.
18130,Obviously though a virus doesn't care about any of our political preferences.
18131,But the steps anyone takes (or doesn't take) to avoid infection will make some difference in how it spreads.

18185,You can also see the menu list of animals they had.
18186,Interesting how the article stresses that raising salaries and trying to limit workers to one nursing home are *probably not* a viable solution.
18187,I'm curious what the (financial) challenges are to pay personnel enough or generally making this kind of job attractive enough to work at only one nursing home.
18188,"Anyway, as the article states I agree that by now we know that at least improving precautions regarding testing and hygiene help a lot in any workplace like this, and probably ensuring supply of PPE."
18189,"There are other data sources that contradict this and I don't see that there are members of their team who specialize in infectious diseases or public health, so I'm not sure about this source having the authority necessary to make a claim that excess deaths are ""slightly inflated""

The death rate is at least ten times that of the flu."
18190,That's not even mentioning long term impacts on health.
18191,Throwing in the towel on other mitigation efforts and just telling people to mask up isn't going to fix it.
18192,"Edit: CDC source on excess deaths

18193,you can't really get exposed just by walking by people.
18194,I mean maybe if neither of you were wearing masks and one of them sneezed directly on you but in generally it would take around 10 - 15 in an indoor space without masks for someone infected to pass it onto you.
18195,So as long as you and the crowd were masked and you were passing by people quickly I wouldn't be too worried.

18886,"Everybody knows that diversity is the only way we can prevent wildfire spread of disease like what happened in 2020, and each industrial scale farm is a direct invitation to the development of animal disease and plant rust diseases."
18887,"Each time a farm triggers a spread of plant rust, the plant rust leaves the ground inhospitable for that species of plant in a considerable amount of time."
18888,"Nature has a ton of ""built-in"" population control mechanisms and epidemics, is one of natures own way of dealing with overpopulated species."
18889,But you want to return to overconsumption because you feel no responsibility for how you leave this earth after you die?
18890,"&gt; we need to understand we can‚Äôt control all human behavior 

You can take this stupid sentiment and apply it to anything."
18891,Also way to politicize something that didn‚Äôt need to be.
18892,"We won, give it a rest."
18893,Denmark : No
18894,Social distancing is still important.
18895,And I‚Äôm going to add if everyone wore a mask *correctly*.
18896,"I‚Äôm looking at you, everyone who sticks their nose out."
18897,I think the problem is the polarization of the country and the wrong info passed around.
18898,I think these people are more gullible than narcissistic.
18899,This title just helps increase the divide and make democrats feel good about themselves.
18900,[deleted]
18901,Looks like most were wearing masks.
18902,"Since the students are all easily trackable at the school, it'll be a really interesting case study in a couple of weeks to see whether there's a spike when a population is outdoors wearing masks, but not social distancing."
18903,...and that‚Äôs terrifying
18904,Environmental issues are urgent and critical.
18905,They don‚Äôt have anything to do with coronavirus though.
18906,"It will be a lot easier to deal with the critical environmental issues, some of which will be expensive to deal with, without having to worry about things like food insecurity."
18907,"Countries tend to roll back environmental protections when faced with economic disruption, not increase them."
18908,Antisocialism is not the answer to the environmental issues we face.
18909,"On the contrary, robust community can help preserve resources."
18910,Biden‚Äôs plan has nothing to do with the election.
18911,If he‚Äôs got such a great damn plan and can save thousands of lives why the hell doesn‚Äôt he reveal it right now?
18912,U thought california did that first ?
18913,You have no idea how bad that would be for this country.
18914,We'd all be locked down for 2 months until cases are so low.
18915,People would suffer.
18916,"Going by the parties and protests, neither side really cares."
18917,Yeah right.
18918,I would argue  with you that it is scientific to start with the origin place and analize all the possibility into consideration.
18919,"Like you said ""foreign Investigators"", I agree with that."
18920,"Also, don't forget that they've found that the coronavorus vaccines could be significantly less effective or not effective at all on those who are obese, which is more than 40% of the U.S population."
18921,Everyone said things?
18922,CNN said it was irresponsible.
18923,One does not equal the other.
18924,The fact is Americans are very bad with self control.
18925,"Like, just awful."
18926,Yes it is!
18927,At first I discovered plant based meals because I wanted to save money as a broke student.
18928,You didn't eat plant based meals for ethical reasons otherwise you would have eaten completely vegan so I understand it's harder to stick to it if you have no strong reason to do so.
18929,For me it's actually easy because I don't eat plant based for myself but for the animals.
18930,And even if I'm not doing so well I don't use it as an excuse to hurt others.
18931,This responsibility makes me stick to veganism without having to think about it.
18932,You talked about spaghetti and ramen.
18933,Spaghetti is typically vegan and with a lentil bolognese it's a dirt cheap and filling meal.
18934,I don't know if you have vegan ramen flavors available but I generally don't recommend it because even though ramen is seen as this cheap food for students it's actually not that great of a deal ESPECIALLY when you factor in the nutritional value you are getting from it (basically none).
18935,Dried legumes are great for a back stock.
18936,"Lastly, if we are being technical the definition of veganism tells us ""to avoid exploitation as far as is possible and practicable""."
18937,So if you are on the brink of starvation and you need to survive it's vegan to consume animal products.
18938,But we have to be honest with ourselves.
18939,Wasn‚Äôt supposed to be funny but glad you think so.
18940,Can you imagine if Trump gets infected AGAIN?!
18941,Aye yi yi....
18942,I‚Äôm a huge proponent of masks(I can‚Äôt wait until the ‚ÄúMask Force‚Äù mandates them for the entire USA!)
18943,"with that said, Europe should be a cautionary tale for us in the US that indeed masks alone won‚Äôt stop the spread without social distancing."
18944,Protesting is one thing but yea these celebrations are ridiculous.
18945,Celebrate at home
18946,Any spike variant needs to be flat out eradicated.
18947,The theory is that infected Seagulls have been in contact with minks.
18948,In minks the virus mutated and gave it back to people at the mink farms
18949,We are number one!
18950,/s (Let‚Äôs hope Biden can turn this around)
18951,The most important thing to remember is that we have not yet lost the Senate.
18952,It all hinges on the final runoff races in GA.
18953,I read somewhere that [vitamin D](https://www.darkdaily.com/boston-university-school-of-medicine-study-finds-vitamin-d-may-help-patients-fight-covid-19-infections-but-some-question-these-conclusions/) helps to combat COVID...I like cooking mushrooms with my food...and did not realize that mushrooms contain vitamin D.
18954,CNN is just Fox-Left.
18955,Covid coverage is less important now that Biden has won.
18956,"They'll get back to inciting panic soon, gotta fill the airwaves until January."
18957,Welcome to Biden‚Äôs America!
18958,/s
18959,He can't issue any executive orders until Jan. 20.
18960,"All he can really do until then is give speeches along the lines of ""There is a pandemic and we all have to make sacrifices."
18961,"I've canceled the holidays with my family and I advise you to do the same."""
18962,These celebrations weren't pre-arranged.
18963,"They sprang up organically and by and large, people followed mask protocols."
18964,"Trump rallies were coordinated, planned efforts that crammed in large numbers of people and then openly mocked mask wearing and following health safety protocols."
18965,"Yea, at around 165 million"
18966,So what are the benefits?
18967,Care to share some research papers please?
18968,Studies on wearing masks in general population?
18969,Borders closed to Danes != banned travel from.
18970,A US citizen who lives in Denmark can still travel home.

18993,Well first the west said the virus in China is bad because it's undeveloped China and it wouldn't happen like that in our countries.
18994,"Then when China stopped the virus, the west said they must be hiding the truth because we can't control it."
18995,Now China has the first vaccine and it is looking like it works...
18996,"Given the track record, I agree with you completely."

18999,&gt; in the late 40s/early 50s under president Truman when it was literally about to fall apart.
19000,"A long-time housekeeping staffer to presidents (I think he was the one the Butler movie was based on)  stated that Truman wouldn't talk directly to the household help, even when nearby."
19001,Everything was echoed via an assistant.
19002,He probably wasn't the only president who treated household staff that way.
19003,As awful as our leadership has been during all of this.
19004,The American people have had the power to make this pandemic a lot less deadly than it has been but we have chosen not to.
19005,"Between this, masks somehow becoming a political debate, protests, celebrations, parties, motorcycle rallies etc etc we should probably start looking in the mirror and realizing that we are just as much to blame, if not more, than our terrible president."
19006,Cases are the highest they have ever been and people seem to have just stopped caring.
19007,People do realize that Biden winning the election doesn't just magically make all of our problems disappear right?

19016,"They seem to have it isolated though, no further cases of the mutated strain beyond the initial 12 cases, all of who had some direct connection with a mink farm."
19017,Just in time for the mink covid-20 to come in with an iron fist.
19018,same dickheads who won't wear masks are the ones who probably make up &gt;75% of the meat/fur industry demands.

19213,Thats 90mil in 3 months and begins to lower the R0 as there are fewer infectible targets to propagate to.
19214,Logarithmic math instead of exponential is at play.

19217,Also that $200 is with insurance.

19232,We're on track to deprive a majority of the western world of 1+ year of their lives so we can slow the spread (not even remotely close to eliminate) of a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.
19233,"Thanks for this link, If I may I do have argument for this one:
The paralysis side effect was obvious within days to 30 days, polio is much more lethal, and the coronavirus vaccine not only has passed the first 30 days safety mark, but it has passed 4 months of phase 3 in terms of both efficacy and safety, but until now, everyone is patiently waiting for the FDA to review it, my only problem is with part of the process that is taking too long, I am quite happy that phase 3 took it's time, but right now, especially that masks offer only partial protection, I am for releasing the vaccine as the cost of delaying it 6 further months would be catastrophic both health and economic wise."

## Highlights

* **‚Ä¢**Obesity(BMI&gt;30kg/m2) was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality."
19509,* **‚Ä¢**Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both severe COVID-19 and mortality.
19510,* **‚Ä¢**Patients with obesity and age&gt;60 years had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.
19511,"## Abstract

### Background and Purpose

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health crisis to the entire world."
19512,"As reported, the body mass index (BMI) may play an important role in COVID-19; however, this still remains unclear."
19513,The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and COVID-19 severity and mortality.
19514,"### Methods

The Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of science were systematically searched until August 2020."
19515,Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results.
19516,"Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect of covariates were analyzed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses."
19517,"### Results

A total of 16 observational studies involving 109,881 patients with COVID-19 were included in the meta-analysis."
19518,"The pooled results showed that patients with a BMI‚â•30kg/m2 had a 2.35-fold risk(OR = 2.35, 95%CI = 1.64 ‚àí 3.38, P &lt; 0.001) for critical COVID-19 and a 2.68-fold risk for COVID-19 mortality (OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.65 ‚àí4.37, P &lt; 0.001 ) compared with patients with a BMI &lt;30kg/m2."
19519,"Subgroup analysis results showed that patients with obesity and age &gt; 60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19(OR = 3.11, 95%CI = 1.73 ‚àí 5.61, P &lt; 0.001) and COVID-19 mortality(OR = 3.93, 95%CI = 2.18 ‚àí 7.09, P &lt; 0.001)."
19520,"Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age had a significant influence on the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality(Coef.=0.036, p=0.048)."
19521,Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both critical COVID-19(Pnon-linearity = 0.242) and mortality (Pnon-linearity = 0.116).
19522,"The risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality increased by 9%(OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04 ‚àí1.14, P &lt; 0.001) and 6%(OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02 ‚àí1.10, P = 0.002) for each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, respectively."
19523,"### Conclusions

Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that a linear dose-response association between BMI and both COVID-19 severity and mortality."
19524,"Further, obesity(BMI‚â•30kg/m2) was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19."

19526,Yeah.
19527,This isn‚Äôt happening.
19528,My parents resisted testing as well after a probable exposure at a small outdoor family gathering.
19529,No idea why they have hang ups about it.
19530,You can get the in-home PCR test from Vault or even Costco.
19531,The vault one all you have to do is spit in a damn cup and put it in the prepaid shipping envelope back to them.

19540,There isn't a magic pill or an easy solution.
19541,The first answer is masks and distancing in general.
19542,"I'm places with the highest spread in my state, there is often low mask usage and low opportunity to distance."
19543,"But my state, NC, doesn't release contact tracing data, at least that I can find."
19544,I would love to see a top 5 sources of spread.
19545,I imagine number 1 is family member to family member.
19546,But what is number 2?
19547,Factory work?
19548,Indoor dining?
19549,Small dinner parties?
19550,I don't know!
19551,What if indoor dining is actually really safe?
19552,Or the gym?
19553,Then people could do things with less concern.
19554,If we had that information we could discourage those activities and encourage safer activities!
19555,I'd also love to see financial support for businesses that need to be shut down.
19556,What if 80% of cases were indoor dining?
19557,We could shut that down for a while without hurting those workers and businesses.
19558,"Also, we need to work on faster testing."
19559,And I remember a tweet about a guy needing a facial scan with temperature check to enter a convenient store.
19560,"Another country, but they had only had 3 cases in the last 100 days."
19561,So it's possible to slow it down.
19562,In the end it's going to take lots of small sacrifices from all of us to get this under control.

19576,Covidworld
19577,But positive rate is higher in France than India had at his peak (might change because now in India is dry weather and bad air pollution).
19578,More testing means lower positive rate.
19579,US has much lower positive rate now.
19580,Guy from 2025 here.
19581,Tesla shares have replaced the US dollar and I've both 5 mansions with 1 share
19582, Not yet.

19584,It's the best counter measure we have when hospitals are strained and cases are surging.
19585,"Stay at home orders, lockdowns,  etc...should only be used in dire situations, but to claim they dont work is disingenuous at best."
19586,"Outside is already open, dimwit."
19587,I want to know though how the percentage of persons affected in Texas varies from other parts of the country.
19588,Texas is a big state.

19590,Not all heroes wear capes

19603,"Yup, Trump's final chore for Daddy-Putin would probably be to bug the heck out of the place."
19604,I only find it funny because of how avoidable it should be.
19605,There''s no good reason these powerful people who live in gated communities and mostly commune amongst each other are spreading it like they are.
19606,If they JUST WORE THE MASKS and respected social distancing  .. .this probably never happens.
19607,Can you imagine being rich and having mostly everything you want but then endangering your life over a piece of cloth on your mouth ?
19608,What a waste..... all wealth no brains

19627,"It seems to be the administrations policy to not worry about it, not to let it rule your life."
19628,They probably intentionally let it spread.
19629,It seems to be causing a K-shaped economic recovery curve where some people make money and others are driven into poverty.
19630,They probably see opportunity in making an underclass who is willing to take low paid jobs.
19631,The poor and uneducated maybe more willing to vote for future Republican religious leaders.
19632,"Considering how the Republicans still are influenced by the religious right, they probably see the pandemic as a thing to bring people closer to god."
19633,"The super rich get richer, and the poor get poorer and maybe the Republicans intend to turn the US into a religious aristocracy."
19634,Proud to be in america!

19636,Unless the virus mutates like coronavirus does

19651,"&gt; We are so fucking stupid

That is my main takeaway from this virus."
19652,"I always remembered half my class in high school were unbelievably dumb, but I never fully projected this onto the adults around me."
19653,Now we're seeing the result of all these dumb people - a pandemic which won't get under control.
19654,And this stupidity continues with the governance - they refuse to implement laws requiring masks are worn.
19655,How do you think Hong Kong managed to get its cases to almost nothing every day?
19656,By making it illegal to not wear a mask.

19659,"Biden's already been in the WH anyway, he won't need to waste his time meeting with them now."
19660,And like you said too much of a covid risk for people who are actually being safe about this.
19661,New admin will need *looooots* of lysol
19662,"I'm not worried about shortages, and I'll still get stuff from Amazon."
19663,Although that's good advice in general.
19664,Bidets are **luxurious**.
19665,"No, it wasn't."
19666,Not in an age with so much fake news deceiving people into hurting themselves by sucking covid.
19667,&gt; have you never seen animals hunting/eating smaller animals?
19668,They probably wouldn't do that if they had grocery stores.
19669,Yes we do.
19670,You may not which means you're not part of we.
19671,Not really.
19672,Mask mandates from the top down and tracing like South Korea did.
19673,There‚Äôs never too late to flatten the curve again.
19674,Such measures also don‚Äôt damage the economy in the same way as a lockdown does.
19675,So at the very least there are these options.

19691,Also not having circulating antibodies doesn't mean that we can't produce them very quickly if needed.
19692,Yes!
19693,I've been worried about this and I haven't seen much on it except from my deep reddit scrolling and personal research.

19697,"You shouldn't have to, it was obvious."

19708,"Masks definitely help, but only to slow the spread a bit."
19709,Most of the spread happens when people are in each other's homes or at work.

19725,The what?
19726,The US border isn‚Äôt completely closed.
19727,There are still flights coming into Newark from Denmark.
19728,"Sure, there are restrictions as to who can come in on them, but it‚Äôs false to say that the border is entirely closed."

19735,"It's idealistic and unreasonable to put responsibility for your health onto the rest of society, to their detriment, like it or not."

19739,"Doesn't matter, President Elect Biden has already named the people on his COVID Task Force and I wouldn't doubt they will announce a national strategy soon."
19740,The executive branch creates and submits a budget to congress for them to approve or not.
19741,So this is incorrect.
19742,The final say comes from Congress but the actual budget itself is made up by the Executive Branch.
19743,Trump's transition team (which is all fired at this point) fell asleep in the practice run of what to do if there was a pandemic.
19744,You see how that went.
19745,That honestly is kind of the prevailing sentiment in every aspect of society I have to interact with.
19746,Drives me nuts when I think about it.
19747,"Let's just fix the process and then follow the process instead of having a stupid, useless (almost always time consuming) process that will inevitably lead nowhere and require an end around anyway."
19748,"If it was ever how the country worked, it's not anymore."
19749,Sadly I think at this point it is up to the people.
19750,But how do you try to help the people when a huge part of the population still thinks it is a joke.
19751,I know in the area where I live you won't find a mask.
19752,If I wear one people stare at me with anger.
19753,I'm still not able to comprehend this ignorance.
19754,&gt;Fewer people would have a far greater impact on those things than switching from capitalism to some other economic means of production.

19763,That is the first thing I thought of when I saw this article.
19764,At this rate we'll only have enough people for one Dakota before years end.
19765,I think so too.
19766,"Localized outbreaks might still be a thing and a vaccine would be nice in managing those, but I don't think you'll see multiple states having an outbreak at the same time (or at the very least on the same level as now) as they are now after the winter."
19767,"And socially, people are already gathering en masse despite where we're at in the fight against Covid."
19768,No chance it continues beyond this when it should start to become more endemic.
19769,"I live in GA - there is no mask mandate, very few rules and regulations (that are enforced at least), the only reason we have people wearing masks in stores is due to business policy, not state policy."
19770,Even that is broken all the time.
19771,It‚Äôs absurd.
19772,Do cases mean people are sick or positive cases using a test were even NYT stated up to 90% of false positives.
19773,People need to start using what they see in their day to day to judge this.
19774,For such a world ending virus it‚Äôs strange most people wouldn‚Äôt know they had it.
19775,But it‚Äôs something people can feel good about themselves preaching wear a mask and other buzz phrases.
19776,When people lose their homes and can‚Äôt find a meal let‚Äôs hear these sentiments then
19777,Thank you for the advice.
19778,I can and definitely will lose more!
19779,I‚Äôve managed to avoid the virus so far so fingers crossed.
19780,Prevalent definition: widespread in an area or in a time period.

19782,You're consistently wrong.
19783,I have that exact lamp too!
19784,I am hella prepared
19785,Yes pretty much universal mask wearing.
19786,If say 99.9% out in public.
19787,"Mixture of masks, but people usually look for the 95% pfe, bfe etc or astm lvl 1 at least."
19788,"No idea if these ratings actually make any difference, don't think any of the studies differentiate."
19789,Some are wearing the reusable ones like Uniqlo.
19790,He didn't specify WHICH Easter.
19791,Good luck with that being effective when staff have two or three nursing home jobs so they can feed themselves.
19792,Not true.

19794,Barely time for twitter
19795,"I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt get you were joking, I‚Äôm super dumb lol"
19796,"If you‚Äôre asking me, i can tell you I‚Äôve been as careful as I can be."
19797,I think some risks are more acceptable than others.
19798,"But sure, in theory, everything should be cancelled."
19799,The people who said Halloween should have been are probably right.

19814,The idea of a blood brain barrier was as much an illusion as the sound barrier.
19815,Exactly the same false concept.
19816,Why don't Doctors and scientists realize that?
19817,"Not exactly *deliberate* vandalism, but Andrew Jackson got a 1000+ pound cheese wheel given to him as a gift near the start of his second term."

19823,I can‚Äôt believe California is so low on the list seeing as we have 40 million people in this state.
19824,Makes me kinda proud.
19825,All the hoax-ers have been saying it.

The first study phase, which could begin in January, 2020, aims to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause the infection in up to 90 healthy young people, aged between 18 and 30 years, who are at the lowest risk of harm from COVID-19."
19846,"The study will take place in the high-level isolation unit of the Royal Free Hospital, London, UK."
19847,Like Biden has an better clue what to do ...
19848,"I think a lot of brick and mortar stores are doing their ""doorbuster"" BF deals online."
19849,"Thanks, Biden."
19850,....how do you feel about the mass gatherings in cities across the country yesterday?
19851,He will try to pardon himself.
19852,At least in Colorado I've heard that we don't have the funds.
19853,The state sent a few hundred dollars stimulus to people that qualified and thats all we could afford.
19854,"So it means most people have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.. Good to know, thanks!"
19855,There‚Äôs a strategy.

19861,What did I say that was uncivil?
19862,Everything I said we're directly from the media and various speeches.
19863,"Biden did call this the trump virus, and did say that he's responsible for 230,000 deaths."
19864,"They've repeatedly said that a Biden presidency would mean the end of the virus, he's said it himself... 

What did I say that was inappropriate or uncivil"
19865,"I hope not, simply because while helpful, supplements are NOT a panacea and anyone who tells you they are should be immediately dismissed."
19866,"Personally, I don't place as much stock in BMI as I do in overall body composition."
19867,Most people who lift weight at the gym would be considered overweight or obese because muscle weighs more than fat.
19868,"If you know you've lost a good deal of fat, and you look and feel a  healthier than before that is a great accomplishment in and of itself."
19869,No matter what be proud of the weight you lost.
19870,"If you think there is a little further you can go then go for it - but I wouldn't use BMI as a sole indicator of whether or not to lose more weight - I'd look at body fat %, height, your overall build (some people are naturally more stocky, etc) to determine if you actually need to lose more weight."
19871,We haven‚Äôt even seen the numbers from Halloween

19884,"I was being facetious, but since we're on the subject: partial effectiveness also scares me."
19885,"Right now they're not 100%; the studies do confirm an effectiveness between 50 and 80%, and that includes the AstraZeneca trials."
19886,Which means some people will get the shot and there's still a chance for reinfection.
19887,"And this first round may be necessary to create a second round of vaccines, assuming Covid doesn't mutate further."
19888,Oregon does not like the Trail we are on.

19897,There‚Äôs so much fatigue and mistrust and misinformation I wonder what he can do...
19898,"Because unless you track the contacts of those having tested positive, it‚Äôs utterly useless."
19899,Those contacts won‚Äôt test positive and will continue to infect others.
19900,This is a pointless discussion.

19907,I think it was called... Olympus has Fallen?
19908,In some ways the damage is done.
19909,People who voted for Trump aren't going to listen to Biden's pleas to take the virus seriously and people who voted for Biden already did take it seriously.
19910,And at this point we'd need much more than people taking it seriously to turn things around.
19911,Two nurses live across the street from me and threw an ENORMOUS Halloween party last week.
19912,"Folks all out in the street, zero masks."
19913,Fuck them too.
19914,In one where people refuse to wear masks ergo it's not working.

19933,East Asia + Vietnam to be more precise.
19934,"Also Austrilia, NZ and maybe Canada also did a good job."

19942,"they didn't lockdown, there's no opening up to do."
19943,they just trace well enough to find every case
19944,It‚Äôs because of the half-attempts at lockdowns in the US that is dragging this out.
19945,Capacity restrictions alone is not enough.
19946,Other countries have managed strict lockdowns for a few weeks til the virus is more under control and then everyone gets out and about again until another surge comes.
19947,Cooperation and community-minded people makes a whole lot of difference.
19948,"When half the population doesn‚Äôt take it seriously, even the half that does take it seriously is going to run out of patience eventually."
19949,"The guilt from getting a loved one infected or being infected and living with long-term health issues is enough to keep certain people changing their lifestyle, whether it‚Äôs a few weeks or months longer."

19965,What's happening in Europe right now is complacency after controlling the virus over the summer.
19966,They'll experience a period of mass deaths until their lockdown curbs the virus.
19967,That's different from having never even tried -- which is what we did.

19975,Seems kinda dumb if there's even a small chance it would help people.
19976,He could conceivably sign an executive order day one that mandates masks nationwide.
19977,Whether the states would comply is a different argument altogether.
19978,If masks were the panacea that‚Äôs claimed then the widespread usage we are already seeing would be doing much more.
19979,It‚Äôs private gatherings and people living with each other that are driving this.

20129,It hits your immune system so hard that herd immunity might not...happen.
20130,Reinfections are possible and becoming more and more likely.
20131,That's not immunity.

Executive orders aren't just decrees; there's a legal process they have to follow, and they can't overrule legislation passed by Congress."
20137,"Normally, when a President announces a big executive order, it's after all that legal work is done."
20138,"But Trump sometimes makes up shit on the spot to get applause at rallies, and then the White House staff have to scramble to put together a legal vehicle that kinda-sorta accomplishes what Trump ad-libbed."
20139,The Schedule F executive order is one of those cases.
20140,It overrules the[ Civil Service Reform Act of 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service_Reform_Act_of_1978) and several subsequent legislative tweaks to that act.
20141,"Trump could still do some temporary damage with that executive order, but it would be overturned in court."
20142,UwU
20143,I want one where Melania has to decorate for Christmas but just drilops the F bomb constantly.
20144,Usually there actually are TV specials about the WH decor and events.
20145,The thing is the current occupants completely sucked all life out of the WH.
20146,All of the them are insufferable people.
20147,Mel has horrible taste in decor and destroyed several longstanding features in the WH such as the Rose Garden.
20148,She hates Christmas and minimized celebration of it.
20149,"He also didn't want to spend much time in the WH anyway, he wanted to be at his club instead."
20150,They rarely spent time together as a family because they probably hate each other just as much as we hate them so there's no real family bond to feature in a special.
20151,"He seemingly barely knows his only son with his current, third wife who he has cheated on multiple times very publicly."
20152,"And most importantly, they don't have a dog."
20153,That's just crazy...
20154,and they waaanted Trump HAHAHAHA go back to school kids.
20155,Its a jab at his spray on tan skin.
20156,"Then don't argue, but discuss and debate on the topic."
20157,There is no need for [ad hominem](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem) attacks.
20158,"I don't find them persuasive, and I am not trying to attack you."
20159,I assume you're a good person and that we share many similar values.
20160,Even if we disagree on a topic I don't know think we need to write each other off.
20161,I have found the lack of leadership on COVID disappointing.
20162,As a nation we have not treated this seriously enough and that is in part attributable to the lack of leadership.
20163,"I'd like to see more encouragement of masks, social distancing, funding for mitigation, building confidence in an eventual vaccine."
20164,"Instead, I've seen Trump ridiculing Biden's mask use, super spreader events at the White House, belittling of plexiglass shields, attempts to use promises of a vaccine ""soon"" for election benefit at the expense of public confidence, and just a general dismissiveness of the seriousness of COVID."
20165,We know what is needed.
20166,We just don‚Äôt do it.
20167,You can‚Äôt totally isolate nursing homes but you can take measures that limit the risk.
20168,"We‚Äôre not nearly in as bad shape as the US or Europe, but the country as a whole is now past the 4,000 new cases per day mark."
20169,"(Per capita that would be around 40,000 cases in the United States.)"
20170,Hi there.
20171,This info has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jq4bdw/us_reports_128000_new_coronavirus_cases_setting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jqbw0k/global_coronavirus_cases_exceed_50_million_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
20172,Does this now apply to every single pathogen from here on out?
20173,Flu is asymptomatic in some percentage of people.
20174,And it kills tens of thousands in the US every year.
20175,"If a 99.99% survival rate isn't high enough to throw caution to the wind, then what is?"
20176,"The risk of infecting someone more susceptible will always exist, not just for covid."
20177,Avoid reposting information.
20178,They should give a facebook/reddit/twitter badge to those who vacinated.
20179,Way more efficient than paying cash
20180,Are they going to go back to virtual schools?
20181,[deleted]
20182,Shoot the virus!
20183,Maybe I'm too cynical but I predict that once Biden takes over the right will be extremely vocal about the number of cases and how it makes us weak.
20184,The rant about partying is an exaggeration used for leisure social gatherings of all kinds.
20185,Callcenters which could easily work from home are a problem as well.
20186,It has been shown again and again that gathering size and frequency are the major driver of the pandemic.
20187,"With noisy data:

20188,Yes.
20189,There are 330 million Americans.
20190,So if we all act like people in North Dakota we probably won‚Äôt exceed five million cases a day.
20191,"To be less pessimistic, if the whole US was catching it at the rate of people in North Dakota yesterday we would be at about 750,000 cases a day."
20192,The rate is still going up there though.

20194,I got the covid.
20195,"I kept up on my raw zinc, vitamin d and c. I‚Äôm a fat ass ex smoker, I made it this time around."

20197,"Anything under 92 you should seek help, I read."
20198,"Mine never got there, thankfully."
20199,Agreed.
20200,Just another of the many fails in the US approach to the pandemic.
20201,What did he do?
20202,"Hi there, this has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jqbw0k/global_coronavirus_cases_exceed_50_million_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)"
20203,Unfortunately it's far too late to stop the spread.
20204,"Whatever Biden does, if the majority of the population doesn't comply then it makes no difference."
20205,The damage has already been done.
20206,Those who were against Trump will most likely already be wearing masks were appropriate and Social distancing where they can.
20207,"Those who supported Trump are not going suddenly going to start to listen to Biden, if anything they will just fight against his requests."
20208,Biden coming into power isn't going to change much.
20209,When people refuse to wear masks and stop gathering then it doesn't matter what strategy you have in place it will fail
20210,I have a question.
20211,Tens of thousands of people gathered in very close groups to celebrate the Biden victory.
20212,Why is this not being addressed?
20213,"Why have people been not allowed to go to church, not allowed to go to school, not allowed to play/attend outdoor sports, but this is fine?"
20214,Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthey were wearing masks!‚Äù That‚Äôs a bullshit argument and you know it.
20215,"If you want people to stop thinking this was all about the election, you have to condemn the celebrations, sorry."
20216,I want Fauci and every Governor and state health officer to be asked point blank about the celebrations.
20217,"You attack people for saying this is political and about the election, and after yesterday it sure looks like what this has been about."
20218,Then it will be the only picture in the WH after Chumps ransack the place.
20219,"Indeed, need to capitalise on their stock market firesale."
20220,Then why were so many people complaining about trick or treat on here?
20221,Have you analyzed data or something?
20222,Hope is not a replacement for science.
20223,"Anyone remember the ""invisible dog"" craze?"
20224,We just had thousands of people run into the streets celebrating....not cool.
20225,Virus thanks us for the celebrations.
20226,And here in the US of course (at least in the south were I live) I feel like the odd one out for WEARING a mask.
20227,It‚Äôs awful.
20228,"Illinois sitting at 0.52% this week, more than twice as many cases as last week."
20229,And Trump didn't prepare at all when he came in.
20230,And he's very likely to refuse to leave.
20231,Gimme a livestream of him being dragged out
20232,I could only trust Chip and Joanna to do this.
20233,I mean both the cdc and the WHO have released information saying they believe at least 10 percent of the world has been infected.
20234,And this was a month ago before the current surge.
20235,"That‚Äôs awful, for once I guess you don‚Äôt want everything to be bigger in Texas"
20236,"Didn‚Äôt you hear, the FBI‚Äôs mission will switch from murderers and human trafficking to walking around handing out 50.00 tickets for no masks."

Over 'W' keys?"
20242,Was this the same time period someone should have given at least maybe a month to investigate the 'Bin laden determined to attack America' memo?
20243,Are they prepared for Trump to leave an upper deck poop in the oval office bathroom on his way out?
20244,We will see what happens.
20245,They are averaging 27 positive cases a day right now but they have a pretty decent testing system.
20246,About 1200 tests a day for a school of 12k students.
20247,Administrators said not to do this and there would be punishments for those who did.
20248,Idk what that means.
20249,"Not every student rushed the field either, some stayed in the stands."
20250,Masks are required in the stadium and so we can only hope outdoors and masks plus decent testing levels and contact tracing will help mitigate any spread and or have kept out anyone infected in the first place.
20251,"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/white-house-mostly-reconstruction-original-180955229/

Some good pics in there, one of the interior being completely gutted down to the dirt underneath."
20252,But the importance of having a facial covering wasn‚Äôt emphasized.
20253,"Preventing contact transmission was the priority, not aerosol."
20254,"Yes, there was a mask shortage but the importance of having any form of facial covering wasn‚Äôt emphasized."
20255,Well in texas you go big or go home.
20256,"And the terrifying thing is that our improvements in treatment only matter if we have enough to treat the millions who will soon be ill.

As soon as hospitals start triage, we go back to the *old* mortality rates or something closer to it."
20257,Not to mention the actualines at polling places..
20258,I can actually visualize the discussions back when they were debating fans in the stands vs no fans.
20259,"""Let's have fans in the stands, we'll limit the number of people and spread them out...it'll be fine."""
20260,"Then good ole' Bob is sitting in the corner of the conference room and goes ""But what if we are ranked in the top 5 and we play the biggest game of the season, at night, against the number 1 team in the country and we go to 2 overtimes and then pull off the upset?"
20261,"How do we stop the kids from charging the field and embarrassing us on national TV while having a super-duper spreader event?"""
20262,Then everyone tells Bob he is being ridiculous.
20263,"Osha document on Covid:

20264,ü§£ü§£ü§£ that is all I have to say about that.
20265,"It says, when you mouse over the tail of the red line, recent weeks are artificially low."
20266,Only 60% are recorded within 10 days.
20267,So those age graphs where it dips below the average only right at the tail will be jumping up aprox.
20268,40% as reports come in.
20269,I bet it winds up higher across every age group when the data is in.
20270,Probably a horrible thing.
20271,"What‚Äôs easier to manage, a population with people who won‚Äôt get the vaccine or a population that won‚Äôt get a vaccine AND take to the streets for never-ending mass demonstrations for the next year because you attempted to force them to do something with their bodies they do not accept?"
20272,But it was *mostly ok* back then.
20273,"I felt safe casting my vote ‚Äî social distancing, ventilated rooms, masks, short exposure time, disinfectants... And the time was right, too."
20274,What really boggles my mind is the government encouraging people to travel for summer holidays... And the damned schools.
20275,Opening schools was criminal hypocrisy.
20276,"I think they were doing the nuanced art of sarcasm, my dude."
20277,So we‚Äôre just running with the herd immunity thing then.
20278,Got it.
20279,Thanks for the clarification.
20280,Vitamin D and Zinc supplements.
20281,Both help your immune system.
20282,I dunno.
20283,Plenty of European countries are seeing cases through the roof despite a notional mask mandate.
20284,When people are together it will spread.
20285,I'm not an expert on biology or virus studies so bear me out.
20286,"I've heard people say that if the virus becomes really widespread, it will die out because it just won't have a reason to spread out more."
20287,"Like everything else, viruses want to spread out and replicate."
20288,"When they are enough of them, they sort of laze out and don't spread anymore

I don't see how that makes any sense."
20289,A virus is just supposed to be a strand of DNA.
20290,"Its doesn't have a brain nor can two virus particles communicate with each other, as far as I know."
20291,"Moreover, how does a virus in my body know how much has it spread."
20292,It doesn't read the daily news.
20293,Is there really some logic to this?
20294,&gt;	no one said a thing.
20295,"You didn‚Äôt see anyone say a thing, that doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt say it."
20296,Sure but they're the biggest contributor to prevention.
20297,Covid19 will mutate because of the USA alone at this point.
20298,Here's hoping it doesn't encounter a human that causes it to mutate and become more deadly and more easily spread üòî
20299,"We can't leave,  we have to stay here!"
20300,For the common good!
20301,We have the virus.
20302,Go away.
20303,Leave us alone.
20304,We must stay..right...here.
20305,You can speculate all you want.
20306,"So far, there's been no proof (at least in new york) that protests increased the infection rate."
20307,"On top of official studies, there's been no noticeable increase in the infection rate during the protests that you can see for yourself."
20308,"Google (""covid infection rates new york"") and it'll give you the infection rate chart."
20309,"In just the last week my sister, her husband, and my wife's cousins have all caught covid."
20310,Prior to that is was just a coworker and a family friend.
20311,Im getting scared.
20312,Hopefully joe locks down as much as he can until we get a vaccine.
20313,OSHA didn‚Äôt have anything to get neutered.
20314,"Yes, it's the same staff, but people can only work for so long."
20315,Eventually knew people will come and some old will go.
20316,"So ya, I'm sure they compare habits of present and past presidential families."
20317,How many of you commenting on this were perfectly fine with the Biden celebrations yesterday?
20318,"The president of the U. S. can't declare ""war mode"" and lock everyone down."
20319,"Independence and democracy have their faults, just like any other style of government."
20320,"There are no in depth or extensive studies on outdoor transmission, but the few very lightly touched on reviews of outdoor transmission show that both masks and following 6ft rule were needed to see the benefits of being outside."
20321,Otherwise they found it was likely to be similar to that of indoor transmission.
20322,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/09/10/2020.09.04.20188417.1.full.pdf

There is so little data out there on outdoor transmission but people have really worked themselves up into think everything is completely safe outside..."
20323,[removed]
20324,"The worst symptom of being brainwashed is when you believe you are not, but the other is brainwashed."
20325,&gt;Fortunately Biden's already been there and basically knows how everything works.
20326,That's pretty insightful and comforting.
20327,Thanks.
20328,&gt; Lockdowns don't harm the economy.
20329,That is a pretty insane thing to suggest.
20330,[deleted]
20331,In Florida they closed down a bunch of testing sites in Fort Lauderdale leaving only one site open.
20332,"Then they reorganized the whole testing site making the process less efficient, causing longer wait times and therefore less overall tests."
20333,"I can't really speak for the rest of the state but this site is run by the state Health Department with the assistance of the Florida National Guard, so I'd assume similar constraints are being placed elsewhere."
20334,"I could have told you that, people are inherently selfish in the usa, it's about protecting you, that's the messaging."
20335,I wish those outlets would stop spreading fake news; Rudy Giuliani said this election isn't over yet.
20336,"It's the same reason that we call it ""the Spanish Flu"" in the first place."
20337,"Due to wartime information restrictions, the governments involved in the war suppressed both how deadly and widespread it was, ""to maintain morale on the homefront""."
20338,"Spain was neutral during WWI, so their press was free to report what was actually going on in their country."
20339,"Because it wasn't war related, the newspapers in the rest of the world were able to print those stories."
20340,"It thus became known as the Spanish Flu, because they didn't fudge their numbers."
20341,"It's believed to have actually started in the US, and soldiers brought it with them to the front."
20342,[removed]
20343,So is it the Democratic states that are doing bad and being hit hard or the Democratic lie that the virus exists in the first place?
20344,You guys gotta get your talking point right.
20345,"Also Norte dame, famous conservative college,  lol"
20346,No.
20347,"The real problem is that at first, *before doing any research*, the authorities said - based on what amounts to a hunch or in the even worse case lying - that masks were actually harmful."
20348,So many months in and we still don't have it figured out
20349,"The wife and I love going out on BF but yeah this year is a no go, we'll just stay home and chill."
20350,I imagine people really enjoying getting Melania's awful stuff out of there.
20351,"&amp;#x200B;

Also, how long do you think it will be before the Rose Garden is restored?"
20352,Thanks for the math.
20353,I'll keep it at the back of my mind.
20354,Biden can't take office fast enough
20355,"Yeah, well, you better ask some Uyghurs in some camps."
20356,:)
20357,False.
20358,I'm not just saying it.
20359,I linked to a published study that substantiates the statement with evidence and youve provided no evidence of the contrary.
20360,You really can't come up with a better argument here than claiming something that's clearly untrue to anyone that can read?
20361,This.
20362,"He suggested we find a way to inject disinfectant, not drink bleach...at least quote the moron correctly."
20363,I think you are thinking of NZ
20364,NY has the second highest per capita death rate from COVID-19 in the world after New Jersey.
20365,They aren't doing better.
20366,The infection ran through their population unnoticed until late March.
20367,NY's response of proactive ventilation no doubt led to their increased death rate.
20368,"As soon as that mistake was discovered, other states stopped ventilating and deaths practically decoupled from cases nationally."
20369,We have nearly a year of data.
20370,The NPIs you swear by have had no discernable impact.
20371,It's difficult to make assumptions about covid Rt because antibodies don't seem to be giving us long term immunity and the virus could mutate.
20372,Unfocused protection
20373,My sister's kids (7 and 9) are going pretty stir-crazy.
20374,They're up in metro Boston.
20375,In the spring they did playing in their yard by themselves.
20376,"Then in the summer, they formed a pod with two other families, with 5 kids and 6 adults total."
20377,"They also started doing a lot of outdoor weekend activities, hikes and kayaking and beaches and stuff, ignoring crowds."
20378,"Now after 8 months of this, their kids are playing with small groups of other kids outside on the playground or riding bikes, but masks are required."
20379,"My 7-year-old nephew celebrated his birthday at the playground with a few friends, while masked, but there was no cake or drinks because that would've required removing masks."
20380,They had party toys instead.

20382,"Let's be brutally honest, we are most likely going to have work out a way to live with this virus don't you think."
20383,We need to stop mink farming worldwide immediately.
20384,Not good.
20385,It‚Äôs going to be a long winter
20386,Seems pretty reasonable.
20387,"There is no strategy to take except wear a mask, clean a lot, and work on a vaccine."
20388,It's not going anywhere.

20390,I don't know how I'm gonna be able to hold myself to such a high standard.
20391,"I have a plan to use the new LED grow light strips on the ceiling of a tall room with lots of windows... that should help mood as well, I think."
20392,Going to work in that all day.
20393,soo... when was the narrative different?
20394,We have never turned a corner... we have never done anything to meaningfully change the trajectory.
20395,Pretending its not a problem (half of the US) or pretending that we can somehow control it (the other half of the US).
20396,From the strictest lockdowns like Italy to the counties that never did.... their trajectories are the same.
20397,"You can (and should) wear a mask, social distance and use good hygiene, not to prevent it... but to receive a lower viral load and hopefully survive."
20398,"In the US specifically, the states are independent... but I assume you'll remember that in January."
20399,There had already been tons of studies on the effectiveness of mask wearing against virus though.
20400,I know because I was reading academic studies back in March on the effectiveness of different types of masks.
20401,The CDC ignored that because they were scared of healthcare workers running out.
20402,It was stupid though and torpedo'd their credibility.
20403,"Just to put this to rest, we k ew masks prevented spread of virus all the way back in 1918, there's simply no excuse."
20404,&gt;You‚Äôre flat wrong on both accounts.
20405,Says the person flat out wrong on all accounts.
20406,"&gt;Where are you getting the 230,000 people killed by the US ‚Äúsystem‚Äù?"
20407,Is that covid deaths?
20408,He is in fact referring to covid deaths.
20409,"The US system has killed way more than 230,000 people."
20410,"The US system has killed and displaced millions in Asia, Middle East, Latin America."
20411,&gt;Apparently there are 114 known deaths caused by ICE in the past 10 years.
20412,And zero known deaths caused by China's vocational training programs.
20413,&gt;I do know what Gitmo is.
20414,"I don‚Äôt agree with it but again I don‚Äôt think  it‚Äôs fair to compare 780 suspected terrorists with literally 1,000,000  Muslims in Chinese concentration camps."
20415,And I don't think it's fair to compare ~~suspected terrorists~~ civilians in known concentration camps with civilians in vocational training program.
20416,"&gt;I‚Äôm not saying China should be soft on terrorism, but all one million detainees are not radical islamists."
20417,I have good news for you.
20418,There isn't 1 million detainees.
20419,"That number was pulled out of thin air by a fundamentalist extremist, Adrian Zenz."
20420,"He works for the Victims of Communism foundation (US funded) and he is a far right extremist who wrote a book called ""Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation"" where he said he was commanded by god to bring down China."
20421,The fundie's methodology for determining 1 million in concentration camps is by interviewing 8 anonymous people.
20422,&gt;Many of them were detained for moderate violations like wearing a veil or growing a beard.
20423,Sure they were.
20424,Did the anonymous source with the leaked government data also say their organs were being harvested and China was purposely letting covid-19 run rampant so they could all die out?
20425,Any other fantasies?
20426,Yes it's play book Obama left for Trump.
20427,But let's be cautiously optimistic here.
20428,He can only get stuff done of Trump and goons cooperate for the last 74 days.
20429,Im quarantining and getting tested.

20454,Those people are young.
20455,"If 2/3 of America is going to catch COVID in the next 3 months, we want everyone young to do so ASAP to minimize total deaths."

20461,"Introductions of the experts, explaining the steps he'll take after the inaugurations, but perhaps most importantly, explaining the rationale and evidence for public health measures everyone can take voluntarily now."
20462,"When was the last time you saw an expert have time to explain aerosol transmission, how masks work, how physical distancing works, how handwashing &amp; sanitizers works, how ventilation works, what to do for individuals who suspect contact etc?"
20463,"When was the last time you've seen an expert assess progress on vaccine candidates, and offer a timetable for when certain groups (health care workers, immunocompromised, elderly, children and others) will have access?"
20464,So much basic public health messaging was simply bypassed in Trump's self-aggrandizing press conferences.
20465,Make them weekly.
20466,Welcome questions from the public to be answered at the following week's press conference.
20467,"Tell the truth, and offer hope that we'll get over this."
20468,"Let Biden remain in the background, or even let the task force run these on their own."
20469,Show how public health messaging could have been done from the beginning.
20470,Can't wait for Biden to take off and suddenly Fox News and co. will start making it a big deal.

20479,I see your point on the the death per capita.

20481,"Ny is doing better than florida, and illinois in deaths per capita."
20482,Personally I wonder if these summer months matter that much.
20483,Better to re argue this in 3 months time after the deaths stats change.

20492,"You are quite right, sorry mate, misunderstood you."
20493,"Except they did studies that the BLM cases didn't cause a rise in cases, while rallies did."

20506,Cases was going down till November.
20507,Its stopped going down now.
20508,Second wave already begun i think.
20509,I think there's a middle ground.
20510,"I've met friends outside and in gardens, that's pretty much safe."
20511,And where I live two households can bubble i.e.
20512,not have to socially distance.
20513,That's just me and my sister so it's not like some tenuous definition of bubble I've seen which if you map it out includes about 200 people.
20514,I've also been on motorbike rides to about 50 miles away for a change of scenery and had food in beer gardens there.
20515,Honest question....who gets to decide how much money is too much?
20516,mutagens
20517,I‚Äôm sure Biden‚Äôs task force will solve this problem.
20518,If I was the BCE I would not give a single euro to italy until they shut down all schools.
20519,It is not a matter of empathy.
20520,It is the predictable outcome of an irresponsible management of the pandemic.
20521,If you put politics ahead of public health then you have to take into account the chance people will die.
20522,That is what they have been doing.
20523,Opening schools risking the lives of thousands of italians.

20529,Are you sure your figures are correct?
20530,"If your BMI was 32 at 120kg weight, then by my calculations that makes you 1.94m tall."
20531,"At 107kg, your BMI would now be 28.5."
20532,"Risk is a sliding scale rather than a yes/no answer, but I would indeed try to get under 30, if you are not already."
20533,(Not just for Covid.)
20534,"And if you can get somewhere in the vicinity of 25, so much the better."
20535,One other thing to consider is the mechanism by which obesity becomes a mortality risk factor for Covid.
20536,"That is still not well understood, but a number of researchers are pointing at Vitamin-D shortage as being an important candidate."
20537,"If you live north of about 40 degrees, you might like to consider getting your Vitamin-D level checked, especially as we get further into the winter."
20538,Sounds like another covid surge coming
20539,Fair enough.
20540,"And yeah, it could have sounded a bit more dramatic than I had it in my head..."
20541,"I am normally talking rather calmly to let peolpe know I dont mean it so harsh like it would sound with different tone, but on the internet, it's hard to emulate, so I will try to be more aware next time and choose words differently..."
20542,"Saw a meme that said if COVID caused men's dicks to fall off, this shit would've been sorted out in a month."
20543,"I was in Boston Commons yesterday and saw tons of ppl not wearing masks



anecdote =//= data"
20544,Agreed-I'd heard tidbits but I didn't see the full story anywhere.
20545,It all makes a lot more sense now though.
20546,it's funny because at this point I think most of us personally know at least 15 people who got covid

20556,So?
20557,"A lot of people thought they had it last December also, and it even mentions he tested negative."
20558,Really wish Biden would do something to stop this already.
20559,"Considering he‚Äôs the ‚Äútop health expert‚Äù in the nation, he should think about being as precise as possible."
20560,He shouldn‚Äôt speak so vaguely.
20561,But go ahead and defend him when he said masks don‚Äôt work and they ‚Äúmay block a droplet.‚Äù
20562,I dont understand why fur farms are still a thing.
20563,"Im not a vegan or anything, i buy real leather (from good sources and not often) I eat meat and dairy (small amounts) and eggs."
20564,I know how bad those industries are obviously.
20565,But they seem to have more utility than fur.
20566,"Barely anybody wears fur anymore, unless youre some ancient old lady, i cant imagine people wearing fur?"
20567,Kinda feel bad for him.
20568,Back in 2008 when he and Obama came into office they had to sort out the biggest financial crisis the country had seen in decades.
20569,Twelve years later he's coming back to the White House and has an even bigger mess to sort out.
20570,I understand what you‚Äôre saying.
20571,I‚Äôve been in those posts saying ya need to social distance AND wear masks.
20572,"But, it has been largely outside."
20573,"There‚Äôs too many not wearing masks, as anything above 0 is too many- but the vast majority are."
20574,And hopefully it‚Äôs short lived.
20575,"I haven‚Äôt seen anything today, so it seems like it was just the initial reaction without much more coming."
20576,"""Just go to therapy!"""
20577,As if paying hundreds of dollars to talk to a stranger over Zoom is a cure-all for someone who's out of work and torn away from their entire support system.
20578,Most of the countries that have done well can be found in the [Asia Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific) area.
20579,"In the US, they should at least make it free even for those without insurance."
20580,Not anymore.
20581,Canada did not do a good job.
20582,"We are now having 4000 daily new cases, which about 1/3 on a per-capita basis that the USA was having."

20584,I don't know what happened to make cases balloon like this...
20585,"I suppose school, church, and family gatherings are to blame."
20586,That's a contradictory sentence.
20587,"Maybe change your definition of power, and definitely expand your historical scope."
20588,Never going to happen.
20589,"I‚Äôd love to hit the pause button and get some government paid time off, it‚Äôs just not going to happen."
20590,"WV, just not out in the middle of nowhere haha."
20591,"My work has designated one person is allowed in per day per set of cubicles (less regulation on people who have their own offices but pushed to work from home), and made every room ""one person at a time"" including restrooms."
20592,"I've honestly only been in 1-2 times in the past 6 months but it seems to be working pretty well-there's a few tasks that cannot be done remotely and usually &lt;5 people in the building, and like 30+ ft apart."
20593,"Jab is used in the UK, I would understand getting confused if it was used in the US, though."
20594,"Hopefully with what they have learned in the past 8 months in regards to treatment options, it will stay low."
20595,I just can‚Äôt believe the massive increase.
20596,"Everyone keeps calling on the government to put things into place, but Ohio already has a mask mandate that no one follows."
20597,"It isn‚Äôt political, it is just people doing what they think they want to do."
20598,"I know there is talk about the science and all that and how the government is not utlizing it, but I will say that I have friends who are nurses and it seems they are split down the middle as far as what is true and what isn‚Äôt, and they know the science."

20600,"The US is doing terribly, but so are lots of countries."
20601,"France for example had the equivalent of 450,000 new case (compared to the US)."
20602,That's almost 4 times the case numbers.
20603,Italy and Spain aren't far behind.
20604,How well do you think countries like North Korea are doing?

20609,"There is a congressional report out on this, published in August."
20610,"Even if a mask mandate survived a legal review which there is no guarantee it would, the federal government lacks the enforcement mechanism to enforce it."

20631,&gt;he has no more power than he did a week ago.
20632,I would say he has considerable more power.
20633,"If Trump starts throwing a real fit, Biden will be able to rally the world to his aid."
20634,But that was the strategy to win the election.
20635,There‚Äôs no strategy for fighting the pandemic.
20636,How many minds have you changed with speaking so aggressively like that?
20637,"OP isn‚Äôt your enemy, calm down."
20638,"Considering wearing a mask is for the safety of others, it seems that giving a shit about anyone else is what makes them angry."
20639,In order for a coup to happen you NEED the military and they have already said they have no loyalty to anything except the constitution.
20640,The constitution says that unless Trump won the election (which he didn‚Äôt regardless of his Twitter rants) he‚Äôs out January 20th.
20641,They will enforce that.
20642,Amen to this
20643,Bigly.
20644,"Ah, you mean the bowling Green Massacre really is going to be a thing?"
20645,"I don't think they're someone who doesn't care, I think they're confused why there is so little national outrage and deaths causes by cancer or heart disease or other common causes"

20647,There's probably a potion for that.
20648,"I don‚Äôt give a shit about my leader being ‚ÄúPresidential,‚Äù like the fuck?"

20650,I care about peace in the world.
20651,"I don‚Äôt give a shit if my President yells or is bullish‚Äîin fact, that‚Äôs what we need in our leader."

20658,"It‚Äôs over, while the rest of the world will be dealing with it well into 2022."
20659,Day 1: National mask mandate.
20660,Why?
20661,"The fact is, US is divisive and it is one of the reasons biden is unable to do it nationwide, so wheres the problem?"
20662,"US is not alone, we in EU have similar problem, its not so binary, because we are not defining ourselves so much by what we voted nor have only two main parties, but the problem of population beeing divided to two groups on different end of spectrum on some topics is very real anyway..."
20663,"&gt; rednecks will commit violence against you

20695,"Successful mitigation would involve ""everyone"" young catching it and ""nobody"" old doing so, and would result in minimal deaths (perhaps just 100,000 deaths under the age of 50 with an attack rate of 100% in the US population)."
20696,"But poor mitigation (essentially what we saw in the high-mortality outbreaks in spring) results in the opposite (super-spreading among group homes), and then gives a feedback effect because it also overwhelms hospitals."

20795,The instruction once you receive a certificate with a positive result at the end of the testing is to go straight home to quarantine and you are only allowed to do a few things (like walk your dog outside your apartment building - though you have to maintain a distance of 5m from other people and are not allowed to use the elevator etc.
20796,"- in case that there's nobody else who could help you with it), but going for a PCR test to confirm the result is not allowed."
20797,In fact just last weekend there were around 25 people who tested positive with the Ag test at one testing site and then went to a different Ag testing site to get re-tested and were then discovered and they will now face charges of spreading a dangerous infectious disease because they were supposed to go straight home after the initial positive test.

20980,Because you have to wait for enough of either group to contract the disease to get the data.
20981,You can't force a timeline on this.

21001,"England didn‚Äôt do any of that, and are now in a month-long lockdown instead of 2 weeks."
21002,This a really unclear to me too because I‚Äôve heard vaccines will be about as effective as masks.
21003,And fewer people will get the vaccine then wear a mask.
21004,So we should get MORE spread post vaccine unless we keep mask mandates in place (and I get down voted to hell on Reddit when I suggest continuing to wear masks post vaccine - until community spread is gone at least).

21011,A lot more (as we have seen) won't.
21012,"Agreed, I guess 4 would be definitely a basis of how the populace acts upon receiving the vaccination and it's why we likely have to keep an amount of restrictions in place for a while."
21013,I had read that about some of the vaccines being more in line with reducing severity while others are trying to provide the antibodies to prevent infection.
21014,That's going to make messaging really important.
21015,Misleading messaging and marketing can lead to a load of problems.

21028,I stand corrected.
21029,Thank you fellow redditor!
21030,Antibody treatments including vaccines for corona viruses have always had heightened risk of antibody enhancement.
21031,Which means the antibodies can make infections worse rather than better.
21032,This has been shown in other coronaviruses.
21033,Luckily we have not seen that with COVID-19 so far.
21034,But all these mutations especially ones involving the spike protein open the door that this happens.

21047,Only the latter of which is measured here.
21048,Thank you for the detailed info.
21049,Now I'm very happy for my Slovak friend.
21050,It feels like Slovakia is the only sensible European country at the moment.
21051,I hope others will follow this approach as well.
21052,&gt;Yea we are fucked.
21053,And everyone of us here knew back in March this would happen.

21057,now.
21058,Interestingly (and frustratingly) the administration was warned that there would be a mask shortage and that the government needed to make a large order from the industry to ramp up production.
21059,However the administration decided they'd rather tell the public that masks do not work to save them for Healthcare workers.

21176,I wear it whenever I'm around people.
21177,This tone right here though is not going to convince anyone to wear a mask.
21178,How is 40k tests per day bad
21179,bidens strategy will work very well /s

21185,"The magical pill is to bite the bullet and do a hard 2 week shut down nationwide, then mask mandates after that."
21186,Look at european countries that did it early in the spring.
21187,They brought cases down to near nothing.
21188,"Now it's roaring again and they'll have to do the same thing, absolutely."
21189,But a couple weeks of hard shutdown is better than the year long quasi thing we've done with people still dying all around us.

21205,Did the government provide free food and essentials?
21206,&gt; control it as soon as possible and take extraordinary measures to achieve that.
21207,"Exactly, and it would be nice if that were a relevant dynamic in front of the US."
21208,But that is not the context most of the world is in.
21209,"We are in a context where it has a widespread presence, in which it doesn't matter how many cool sounding taskforces a government establishes, unless you lock down literally for months, the disease cannot be eliminated."

21211,I'm just glad that Biden won.
21212,Hopefully he'll lock the entire country down and make everyone stay in their homes for at least 30 days so this damn virus will finally die off!
21213,!
21214,Bad bot
21215,The question is how much immunity there is after infection.
21216,To my knowledge every virus has has people that can get infected twice.
21217,"People have billions of cells and shit is crazy in there, we all have pretty similar genetic codes but a lot of the minute differences affect this sort of thing."
21218,"If, let's say, one percent of people can get reinfected, I hate to be so heartless but that really isn't a huge deal."

21228,At least we know it can't get any worse after somehow.
21229,So what did Canada do to the indigenous people again?
21230,A country founded on genocide is hardly one to speak about human rights.

21247,That has nothing to do with a mental issue.
21248,&gt;He‚Äôs capable of conversing about complex policy in front of cameras and under pressure.
21249,Please tell me you‚Äôre joking.
21250,&gt;Our current president shows many more signs of dementia.
21251,Do you actually believe that???
21252,Are you delusional?
21253,Coronaviruses are very genetically stable and mutations aren't likely to affect vaccine efficacy.
21254,Realistically we'll just need yearly booster shots like with the flu vaccine.
21255,I was clear on what the first vaccines are likely to achieve so again nothing in table one is a surprise.
21256,And it may be conjecture to say that hospitalisation in at risk groups might be reduced but it‚Äôs a reasonable assumption to make and will probably become clear in stage IV studies.
21257,It‚Äôs been shown to reduce viral load which certainly could have an effect on transmission to vulnerable people at least in the sense that it may reduce severity.
21258,But again it‚Äôs all conjecture because the stage III results are yet to be released - we will soon know what the vaccine can and cannot do.
21259,If it reduces symptom severity across the board that will be a very positive first step.
21260,"Also, not specifically searching for certain outcomes does not mean those outcomes won‚Äôt be found."
21261,And elderly people have a weaker immune system and the Oxford vaccine has already shown to provoke a strong immune response in them.
21262,It seems like you think that a vaccine should provide 100% immunity otherwise it‚Äôs not worth bothering with and I don‚Äôt agree.
21263,And again I do not agree with lockdown at this point but I don‚Äôt link lockdown measures with the vaccine.

21278,That says LTC deaths were only 15% of the covid deaths.
21279,"Wow, that is waay lower than elsewhere."
21280,"The policy was put in place on March 25th, so yeah that was a the peak of hospitalizations which lag actual infections, so yeah I'd say its fair to cite the jnitial antibody testing results as relevant to how far it had spread."
21281,Is one in six better?
21282,"Sure, but even if say one in ten the point holds... these facilities had the virus in them."
21283,"They had to be able to manage covid+ people, and if they couldn't the NYDoH said they would relocate people (but they couldn't stay in hospital for obvious reasons)."
21284,"If it was so wrong to return covid+ residents from hospital, why is it not wrong to require relocation of covid+ from LTC as general matter (which no where did)."

21321,"So not a complete lockdown but it‚Äôs still a lot for a poor, sanctioned country."
21322,[removed]
21323,I'd like to think countries can see that they have a huge interest in ensuring the rest of the world gets the best vaccine at cost of their own profits due to the long term economic impacts.
21324,But I also remain cynical about self interest led humans.
21325,"One of them knowingly and deliberately downplayed the virus, initially called it fake news, lied to the American people, disparaged his pandemic response team in public, screwed up resource distribution to the point states were bidding against each other ebay-style and smuggling PPE in on private planes, asked if the virus could be cured by putting lights or bleach inside the body, downplayed the virus some more, refused to wear a mask regularly, and oversaw the majority of his own staff, family and even himself contract the virus."
21326,Those are the cliff notes.
21327,If Joe Biden sat on his ass and did nothing for the next 6 months it would have a more positive effect on Covid rates than anything Donald Trump actually did during the entire pandemic.
21328,"His response was abysmal, dangerous and ultimately cost people lives."
21329,So what is it specifically about Joe Biden's future pandemic response that concerns you?
21330,"I mean be really specific, ""I don't see him changing much"" is beyond vague."

21363,"And, a mutation that is less contagious but requires a different immune response isn't going to replace the existing strains until after everyone's caught it."
21364,It wouldn't even have an evolutionary advantage in the US/EU yet since almost nobody has an immune response to existing strains yet.
21365,Things are proceeding a little slower than he thought they'd be when he testified before Congress in September.

21397,Seems to me like people just potentially get sick for a couple days and then recover.
21398,Am I missing something here?
21399,I think you're selfish to expect billions of health low-risk people to put their lives on hold because you're too selfish to stay home for six months until a vaccine arrives.
21400,100$ says hes a WFH techie with no friends who never left home for social events anyways.
21401,This sounds awesome!
21402,I have a toddler i wish could socialize more.
21403,but unfortunately my job requires an occasional trip to the office and not all of my colleagues take the virus seriously.
21404,We've had several cases at work already.

21424,"If the rain was deadly and you getting hit by the rain actively caused more rain, I would say wear a raincoat if you have to be outside, but overall could you please not go outside unless you actually had to"
21425,Sounds quite like how minorities are treated in US.
21426,Yet another reason we need to scrap insurance companies and have universal healthcare.
21427,What do you expect to change?
21428,Nothing will because masks and lockdowns are up to the states.

21464,"And the primary antibody defense is tailored to the spike protein, which is also what makes it so contagious, so a change there that makes existing vaccines fail would be very likely to reduce contagiousness significantly."

21476,If you get pulled over for speeding and not wearing o e of course the officer might as well cite you for it while they're  at it but it would be impossible to completely enforce.
21477,"Same goes for masks, its just not possible to enforce even in mandate states."
21478,"The only thing that can happen is whats already pretty much being done, individually businesses must refuse service."
21479,However most businesses cant do much besides tell them their mask policy.
21480,I know Walmart tells employees they can request a customer to wear one but if they still refuse they have to leave them alone because its not worth going any further
21481,Doesn't matter anyways.
21482,"He is going to come in around peak if not at the peak, implement his ideas and regardless of the work it will naturally go down as it gets warmer plus vaccines start to roll out."

21517,Aren't those mink all dead by now?
21518,"(They would have been killed soon for their furs anyway, and so would their children, so this is less inhumane than the farming.)"
21519,But a new dangerous new strain will absolutely arise in mink if we keep farming.
21520,COVID can just jump back and forth between minks and humans constantly.
21521,"It's like a wet market, only with hundreds of thousands of vulnerable animals instead of just a few."
21522,We need to stop mink farming worldwide immediately.
21523,Doesn‚Äôt help that thousands are in the streets celebrating Trumps loss.
21524,They are dooming us to more and more shutdowns.

21527,Be realistic.
21528,"If there were 130k new cases yesterday on top of the million or so new cases over the past couple weeks or so, then there's no turning this thing around."
21529,The U.S. passed the inflection point on that exponential curve probably a couple weeks ago.
21530,"1 new case probably equals 10 new infections, so 500k per week in new cases is probably 5MM new infections."
21531,By December people will be talking about natural herd immunity in the US.
21532,100% agree
21533,Masked it

21945,"Western nations are, to the extent that they're contact tracing, primarily focused on ""forward contact tracing"" which is notifying people a positive case might have infected and asking them to quarantine."
21946,"If the dispersion hypothesis is correct, we should be doing something more similar to the Japanese approach of ""backward contact tracing"" to figure out who gave it to a positive case and identifying superspreading clusters and clamping those down hard."

21976,He‚Äôs been hiding somewhere the past few days.
21977,Citizens were out in between lockdowns as they have to get a bit of normality and feed into the economy or it will crash?
21978,"Lockdowns did help, less people on the streets?"
21979,Less spread.
21980,Masks are mandatory in Europe and UK or you're not allowed in stores or access to services.
21981,US has not made it mandatory.

21996,Great link.
21997,The thing is there‚Äôs a difference between what your described and then doctors prescribing vitamin D for all sorts of other things and giving people hope on something which just doesn‚Äôt have the evidence to back it up.
21998,"It may come out in 10 years time vitamin D can improve x, y, z but until then I‚Äôm dubious about doctors recommending specifically vitamin D for anything other than fracture risk reduction."

That is updated twice a week."
22008,This only covers current breakouts.
22009,Older breakouts are aged off.
22010,"Recently heard a doctor on the podcast This Week in Virology say that he has found that people are now refusing to get tested in a lot of cases because they know if they are positive, they will be told to stay home from work and they can‚Äôt afford to."
22011,"Until the US ponies up to help people financially, this thing isn‚Äôt going away soon."
22012,"Ironically, we would have spent a lot less if it was done back in the spring."
22013,Based on the weird change in your death curve \[1\] from roughly the time HHS were said to take over the death stats I hope you're not in for a nasty surprise.
22014,"\[1\] I only track a 7 countries regularly but the US is the only one where there has been a huge sustained growth in cases over more than the 4 week ""time to die and reporting"" lag which was not followed by a similar growth in deaths 3 or 4 weeks late."
22015,US death per day has been basically flat since August.
22016,"New cases, not so much, growth started seriously about 9 weeks back."
22017,I started wondering why and either your hospitals got way better at treating it than the rest of the world and kept getting better during the growth.
22018,Possible I guess.
22019,Or maybe because the death rate was all the media talked about that was the only number that got fudged a little.
22020,Possible I guess.
22021,If the latter then their is gonna be some 'splaining to do I guess.
22022,"Combined with those things people are ""bored"" and itching to have social interactions despite the risks."
22023,Y'all need to stay home.
22024,One does not simply call the insurance company....
22025,"It never became ""legal"" to see your friends again."
22026,All of the guidelines are still in place that you're risking contracting and spreading the virus by having social gatherings.
22027,Nothing ever changed.
22028,"For that matter it wasn't ""illegal"" to see your friends in the first place it was not recommended if you cared for their health and safety."
22029,You can visit a friend whenever you want if you sit 6 feet apart and wear masks.
22030,You don't even have to do that if you're both taking proper precautions and it isn't a gathering of 10 people or more.
22031,"If you have both tested negative and it is a small gathering you can hang out like ""normal""."
22032,Police aren't going to arrest you for hanging out with your friends.
22033,This is fear mongering and if you believe that a lockdown of all businesses except grocery stores and hospitals means it's illegal to socialize you should talk to a professional about it.

22036,&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson's Aug. 5 contract for the government's purchase of 100 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine doesn't include the march-in rights that are typical planks in contracts for federally funded inventions.
22037,"Instead, the contract allows a much narrower window for the government to step in, excluding when COVID-19 stops being a public health emergency and becomes endemic, as is expected."
22038,LOL.

22055,Cocaine everywhere
22056,So you support Trump rallies now?
22057,lmao
22058,Unfortunately although a decent survival rate many people require hospital care.
22059,This takes huge resources inside hospitals and the ambulance system.
22060,Even in Australia Victoria where our wave peaked around 700 cases a day my friend as a paramedic felt the pinch.
22061,Full PPE required and long waits at the hospital to correctly reset and clean the ambulance for another patient.
22062,If 99.7 of people could recover at home I‚Äôd say this virus would be treated far far far different but it puts massive strains on health care.
22063,Their was estimates of 20% hospitalisation rate?
22064,Not sure if this is still true.
22065,"Unfortunately lockdown in the UK seems to be the only way to slow the virus, maybe in Asian countries people will sensibly follow guidelines like NK or Japan but it won‚Äôt necessarily work in the UK."
22066,You obviously didn't get my point.
22067,Hating China is fair.
22068,Bringing up that hate as a reason to dismiss completely unrelated things is not.
22069,"The simple fact about the Chinese government is that they care about their Han Chinese citizens,  and don't care about anyone else in the world."
22070,Do you think experts would still be calling for shutdowns though?
22071,At first I didn't expect it to last for this long üòÉ.
22072,"That doesn't work though, you don't become immune."
22073,"You can catch any virus multiple times even with a vaccine, your body might learn to defend itself better the second time but that's also not a guarantee."
22074,Not getting sick is far superior than purposely getting sick.
22075,The longer you can avoid getting sick the better treatments become and the faster they can detect it and the better they can deal with it.
22076,"Especially with long covid being a thing, I'd rather get covid in a years time when I can get better medical treatment than get it today and have my body deteriate for a year."
22077,Herd immunity is the dumbest idea ever.
22078,"Yes, I am serious."
22079,Your response shows that you aren't serious about covid after all.
22080,"Unfortunately, there are still ways Trump can get sworn in if he‚Äôs successful in refusing to concede."
22081,&gt; we ain't coming back when its all over!
22082,Yes you will.
22083,"I'm not sure why that would be the case, considering he didn't make any new proposals during his campaign regarding Covid19 except by saying ""I'll listen to the science"", which is an unspecific and frankly unhelpful platitude."
22084,Went to the park to take my daughter to use the playground.
22085,Only me and my wife had a mask (daughter is 1 and she kept it for like 10 mins and took it off) so we left.
22086,Seeing so many people congregating yet again on TV with no social distancing is so disappointing to see.
22087,"When rates are increasing all over the country, we need to do everything possible to fight it."
22088,Just because you're outdoors doesn't mean you eliminate the spread.
22089,I really hope Biden releases a statement telling everyone to stop them now.
22090,Burying your head in the sand takes time and planning.
22091,"Gotta get a shovel, maybe a snorkel..."
22092,I doubt Biden would carry through with his campaign promise of a national mask mandate.
22093,"Either he'll try one, but have it challenged in a Republican-controlled Supreme Court, or he'll just avoid imposing one entirely."
22094,"Nor is there much motivation to impose one anyway, considering that the vaccine is right around the corner."
22095,"People are getting tired of altering their lives, and are anticipating a return to normal."
22096,"So probably not to a mask mandate, and as for a national lockdown, *definitely* not."

22100,My bet first case was asymptomatic and might not have been in Wuhan.
22101,It's look like the majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild so wouldn't recognize what they had in October/November.
22102,Tracking a disease like polio also would suffer similarly.
22103,"For polio it is over 70% asymptomatic, over 20% mild fail to register they got polio, and about 4% get it bad with 0.5% dead or paralyzed"

22109,"Some people truly think they are above the ""people's"" reality and laws."
22110,"They are called narcissists ( and/or sociopaths, and psychopaths)."
22111,They will likely be hit hard by covid.
22112,"Unless he proposes mandatory lockdowns from the federal level and mandatory masking under penalty of law (which he's already said are unconstitutional), I fail to see what he could propose that hasn't already been enacted."
22113,You obviously didn‚Äôt read the article.
22114,The costs it refers to are in human life.
22115,Everything isn‚Äôt dollars and cents.
22116,The dichotomy between lives and the economy is a false one.
22117,No it‚Äôs not.
22118,"Neither is having bars open, or restaurants."
22119,At least this is outside and largely masked.
22120,It likely did less damage than everyone who went out to eat that day.
22121,My concern is that the rabid trump fans are going to push back that much harder against any kind of covid safety precautions BECAUSE they come from Biden.
22122,Impossible to say.
22123,The depth of his depravity and criminality is so great that at any given moment there is an equal chance that someone is about to discover a new grift in which he is engaging.
22124,"But, as a corrupt temper to that, our government is currently so inept and jaundiced that even if these schemes had been discovered in this anti-COVID timeline, he may have not faced any legal scrutiny."
22125,"He was plenty unpopular before COVID, and I imagine he would have found another way to foul it up."
22126,Who knows...
22127,I think it's somewhat conclusive that new clusters are surrounding frozen seafood but has there been conclusive studies that patient zero in each case was specifically infected by viable viruses resurfaced from the packaging?
22128,The vast majority of people do not.
22129,Even kids don't need to.
22130,"Eating three meals a day is actually doing damage to your body, not to mention your wallet."
22131,Just completely unnecessary.

22133,"To the topic of this thread, which is that Biden will have a better plan, he is not for more lockdowns."
22134,I‚Äôm not doing another lockdown like we did in April/may
22135,Down here in Tennessee I get dirty looks for wearing a mask in public and the school board of my county was actively pushing for full time in person classes without a mask mandate.
22136,Then why I am forced to wear masks and pay attention to mandates and restrictions?
22137,I‚Äôm not sick.
22138,"For many people, however, masks are uncomfortable."
22139,"So while they *should* be worn until around Spring, and maybe afterwards, I doubt that realistically people *will* continue to wear them for much longer than the vaccine is released to the elderly and the essential."
22140,Why did I think they were talking about Boston College lmao
22141,"We were locked down for a few weeks here, only Victoria had to lock down again (and it was long)."
22142,"Mostly, this has been managed through hotel quarantine, like with NZ."
22143,"Australians also generally love to travel, it's considered a rite of passage for young adults."
22144,"We are well travelled, it does suck that it's on hold, but at the moment we're getting a chance to check out our own massive country."
22145,"It's a good time, happy to travel next year."
22146,"I note also, you didn't answer about health insurance when travelling during a pandemic, nor acknowledge that being able to attend festivals and life in a covid negative society are freedoms of their own."
22147,"It's always bothersome that with Americans, ""I like my freedoms too much for X"", whilst at the same time making them sound like both a burden that keeps you from living in a sane society, *and* that they're somehow enviable, something others can not know - allwhilst rarely acknowledging what others have that you do not."
22148,"It's always a frustrating one to talk about, because so many shut down as if it's an indoctrination point, yknow?"
22149,Topic goes straight off limits.
22150,"To be fair, the Danish government (and people in general) have been wanting to get rid of mink farming for years - this just gave them a good reason to do it ASAP."
22151,I don‚Äôt even care anymore...I tried quarantine all summer but nothing was improving so I went back to my life

So sick of the virtue signaling."
22154,"Thousands of people die every day from other medical conditions and illnesses, too, and I hate how we‚Äôre acting like covid deaths are 10 times worse than anything else."

22167,"Our only hope right now is that as a first order of business, Biden brings back what he and Obama put in place before Trump fired them all."
22168,It did not have to be this way for America and now that we're ridding ourselves of the gross incompetence at the top we can have a plan to get better.
22169,Our CDC is the best in the world and they need to be freed from today's political malfeasance and brought back to the forefront of response where they belong.

22174,"As someone who's been quarantined for my mother's sake since this all began, once she's got a vaccine in her then I'll feel comfortable seeing friends again, which will pretty much bring the most taxing part of this ordeal to an end for me and everyone like me."
22175,"I'll still take preventative measures for the sake of myself and my fellow man, but I think delivering my mom to safety will warrant some loosening."

22183,I've been there 14 years and boss is about to turn 70.
22184,If I quit he's done and I need one more year before I have certain qualifications I need to do that more effectively.
22185,"Biden has talked about a mask mandate on a national level, but it will most likely be varying levels of state by state shutdowns/restrictions well into next year."
22186,"No individualist solutions will work unless people are given the right to defend themselves against anti-maskers, as in shoot on sight."
22187,Ireland went into 6-week lockdown a few weeks ago and number of cases already dropped almost 3x by now.
22188,"Lockdown sucks, but if everything else goes well we might have single-digit daily case numbers by December."
22189,Other countries were a bit late but also locked or locking down.
22190,They should also see drop in numbers soon.
22191,Repeated lockdowns is a crappy strategy bit it seems to work.
22192,Very few countries were able to do something better.
22193,"I mean yeah, maybe."
22194,At least it was outside though.
22195,That goes a long way in decreasing infection rate - most likely why we haven't seen huge increases following protests across the country.

22286,"With luck, we hold the deaths under a million."

22292,"It‚Äôs not just F15s it‚Äôs most military vehicles, we don‚Äôt need to keep producing war machines we are already #1 in the world and can stay there for a long time if we just stop production."
22293,The military budget is way to big and we should really move a lot of it‚Äôs budget to society issues.

22323,"Like i said, test kits are cheap in china, that is why they can afford it."
22324,The kits sold to overseas probably more than enough to cover the cost to test everyone in china.

22339,Lol well of course we‚Äôre doing nothing.
22340,Look at our president and the cult following he has.
22341,It is statistically related to political opinions.
22342,Just because everyone has a choice doesn't mean that one group doesn't have more compliance than the other.
22343,You are aware that the reason for the differences is not the size of the country but the voting system?
22344,"In the US the President is elected separately from the house or senate, in Europe the government is generally elected by parliament, that means that there may be changes to the MP or chancellor within days."
22345,"- If you lose the vote of no confidence, you're out of office."
22346,Nobody aside from complete idiots thinks the virus doesn't exist.

22356,"And I completely agree that people who are glued to the swivel-chairs because they love the paychecks, aren't Jesus Christ or something, they can keep all their personal opinions, prophesies about the future and attempts at clairvoyance to their private lives."
22357,"Although it is essential that disenfranchised people get food, I would argue that we should use a revolving corps of young healthy staff to bring food to everybody's door, the staff needing to take 14 days off so and so often to make sure their body has time to fight down any infection that they may be exposed to, in which time they should ofc also still receive wages."
22358,"Alcohol addiction is too strong a mechanism in human beings for us to be able to prevent people from getting alcohol, so that part of the decision I cannot have a grievance with, except as I said, the store in itself is an non essential meeting place for people to spread pathogens."
22359,"As far as I understand, huge parts of the spread in Australia was actually caused because a group of people was forced into quarantine in a non smoking hotel and some who was addicted to nicotine ended up sneaking out to buy cigarettes."
22360,"If the store you mentioned supplied drugs for people who needs it as pain regulators or similar, then I can ofc understand that it would be on the list of essential, like a pharmacy, but from the sound of how you described it, the store was only selling colourful, decorative items for use with drugs, and that sounds like a big mistake to not close."
22361,"Again all stores being generally huge health hazards for immunocompromised people, we should remember that although the so-called united states has a different set of ""human rights"" centralised around owning property, the governments in the rest of the west are obliged to make sure that people with poor health are included in society."
22362,"From what I have seen in Denmark, all patient groups who are at risk of more likely dying from the sars2 virus, have been more or less in isolation throughout the entirety of this year, while stronger youths are insisting on assisting the virus with being in circulation, because they just don't feel good about ""having to do nothing""."
22363,"As long as people refuse to be a society but just want to live ""free"" *in* society, the governments have to keep making laws about what people do not do voluntarily."
22364,"All people had to do to avoid the laws being made, was behave with solidarity out of their own accord."
22365,"And if you have possible side effects, go bankrupt trying to navigate the US healthcare system."
22366,Sounds like a fair insentive to me.

22369,Most preppers will tell you to stock what you regularly use and eat.
22370,"You should enjoy the food you stock up on, because you are going to be eating it for a while and you want to keep your mental health and moral up."
22371,"Beans are a great option if you like beans, if you hate beans, then they are a terrible option for emergency prepping."
22372,"That being said most people have trouble with beans when they first start eating them, but then their gut adjusts to it overtime."
22373,This might be the case for you or might not be.
22374,"If you are looking for the top quality stuff to stock that has best taste and good  nutrition (many prepper stockpile food companies have crap nutrition that will starve you if you follow their rationing guides, remember this if you find any deals that seem too good to be true), Mountain House brand freeze dried foods are the way to go, though they are likely still out of stock as they have been getting bought out constantly since the pandemic started."

22385,All Biden has to do is to grab a chart showing everything that happened in the year 2020 concerning Covid when he wasn't in office.
22386,Cant blame him for any of it.
22387,This is Trump's legacy.
22388,Trump wont have much to say about it after NY prosecutors get a hold of him and lock him up for state crimes.
22389,"There are on the order of dozens of F-15s built per year, not hundreds."
22390,"There have been barely more than 1,100 built since the 1970s."

22401,"If they say it's good, I'm in as soon as possible (surely, after frontline workers and other first level vaccinations)."
22402,You forgot about the port worker and the fact that none of the quarantine workers were picked up by their regular testng.
22403,The bigger reason for the size of the warehouse was the church group that kept meeting instead of following recommendations because the leaders of their church in America said the virus was a hoax.

22429,"well for starters, ""social distancing"" means 1 meter distance between people, whereas in UK and the US are at 2 meters distance."
22430,"And they've come up with the ""septaine"" which is a half fortnight quarantine, so a week of isolation instead of two, when in doubt of infection (contact cases, positively tested, and people who where around a possible cluster such as big family event)."
22431,You're to isolate for another week if you show any symptoms.
22432,"The rest is pretty typical, sneeze in your elbow, use single-use paper tissues, wear a mask, avoid large crowds and shared indoor spaces, and wash your hands."

22436,"No, ‚Äòit‚Äôs going away‚Äô is referring to the conspiracy theorists who believe that the numbers were manipulated to influence the outcome of the US election."

22438,"Yeah, I hope so also."
22439,"Hopefully in a year, this has died off, and it will not be an issue."
22440,I dont think the strains matter much.
22441,Everyone is using sinopharm vaccine irregarless whether its wuhan strain ir european strain.
22442,Sinopharm only had 2 vaccines and test subjects in china get to choose which one in earlier phase.

22739,NOPE!!
22740,"Look, I definitely don't mean to carry-on."
22741,I know that part of what makes the human dynamic interesting is that we all have our different ways of doing things and living our lives.
22742,But right now we are all supposed to be socially distancing and keeping mainly to our own households with exceptions here and there (e.g.we see my parents who live nextdoor).

22749,"Anyway, I just wanted to share a glimpse of what is going-on in Indy."
22750,And I guess that included a little of Missouri too since the in-laws argument has been that their numbers weren't high.
22751,Idk why people feel the need to wait for numbers to be high before being more pro-active about this current pandemic.
22752,It's only getting worse for everyone and at this point I have been feeling like the kid in school that does what they are supposed to but still gets punished with the class.
22753,"When I Google it, I'm overwhelmed with the twice as likely study."
22754,"I mean obviously, if you're dining indoors, you're not worried about the pandemic very much at all."
22755,That probably means you are taking lots of risks.
22756,But I'd rather know the percentage of cases that can be traced back to dining.
22757,"Louisiana is the only state I've seen to release their data, and they didn't split indoor and outdoor dining the last time I looked it over."
22758,"And I'm not saying it's not risky, just that I'm slowly going insane, and it's clear that I'm in the minority in wanting to address the issue rather than ignore it."
22759,"To be honest, what I really want is to go back to the climbing gym."
22760,It seems safish and I've heard of no case spread there.
22761,But I don't have the numbers!
22762,This.
22763,"I saw an article the other day that was like ""Disney isn't a source of Covid spread""."
22764,"But the article showed that people are not rapid tested or required quarantine verification before entering the parks, and people are not required to test after leaving the parks."
22765,"Which means they're literally saying ""we test neither before or after a Disney trip, therefore we don't see it affecting spread""."
22766,"Stat is ""fuck it"" whose ready for mad max leather?"
22767,I remeber seeing a video of someone walking through an Italian ICU when this all started and it was the first thing I noticed.

22784,That was *after* they already said they don't work.
22785,"The question is whether if they did not say they don't work but rather went straight to that, would things still have turned out that way?"
22786,Is that just cultural convention or is it actually written into your constitution?
22787,There are plenty of people not following the rules in the UK but I don't believe compliance here is as bad as some make out.

22895,Literally.
22896,"My recollection from the news at the time is that the Trump team basically shrugged off this work, and came into the White House cold."
22897,"Do we have the expectation that they'll do it on the way out, when the personal stakes are basically zero?"
22898,[deleted]
22899,"I‚Äôve read that they might vaccinate young people pretty early on, because we spread the disease most and vaccines tend to be most effective in healthy young people."
22900,"Obviously healthcare workers should get it before anyone else, though."
22901,They‚Äôll be Covid states and then the rest of us.
22902,I think they were demonstrating some hand-wavy made-up math.
22903,"I meant when it socially ends and everyone stops caring, even more than what‚Äôs happening right now."
22904,Don't worry he's just trolling.
22905,"I blame Obama, Thanks Obama."
22906,Never forget he left the cupboards bare.
22907,Exactly right.
22908,"There are masks, vaccines, lockdowns."
22909,That is all the tools we got.
22910,"People are going to be disappointed in this, because he's framing this as something new."
22911,"Also, many governors don't want federal oversight when it comes to covid."
22912,New York daily briefings are very helpful and this would be great on a nationwide scale
22913,They were doing way better than expected for so long.
22914,Mark my words - covid ‚Äúgoes away‚Äù shortly after Biden takes office.
22915,It‚Äôs 99% political at this point given how effective masks are at curbing the spread.
22916,"Well Biden needs time to fly in the Chinese operatives that will fill his administration, and that will take a few weeks, minimum."
22917,I‚Äôm ready to blame every death on this fucker.
22918,If my grandpa dies under Biden?
22919,Well fuck you Joe.
22920,The average Redditor isn‚Äôt smart enough to realise it wasn‚Äôt serious.
22921,But is he even president elect?
22922,"MSM called it but they arent the authority on it tvough, right?"
22923,"Arent there litigations, recounts in many states taking place?"
22924,I saw Rudy had 50 witnesses of voter fraud lined up.
22925,Biden is setting himself and the entire US left up for disappointment.
22926,There will probably be even more riots in the near future..

22935,"""Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem"""
22936,they'll find a new narrative to latch onto
22937,Sure if people wore n95 masks or a surgical mask and assuming people wear them correctly.
22938,I live in one of the most liberal states in American and majority of the people I see in public wear masks and we have one of the highest counts.
22939,Part of the problem is the majority of people are not wearing a n95 or a surgical mask.
22940,I have also seen Biden carry this black mask and it sends a message that they are just as good as surgical and n95 masks.
22941,Until we educate the public that the type of mask matters than I don‚Äôt think there will be progress.
22942,100% right.
22943,Given we‚Äôve had shit closed for so long the appetite for doing any more of it is less than zero.
22944,If any quarantine mandate happens anywhere I‚Äôd expect widespread violence.
22945,"Most people would have zero problem with a mask mandate, and that is extremely effective."
22946,Likely the best route at this point.
22947,"Edit : it‚Äôs not really about fortitude, it‚Äôs about Americans not having appetite for not being able to choose the risk profile they‚Äôre comfortable with."
22948,"If people want to work, do things, let them (with a mask)."
22949,I'm teaching in Houston and my students told me all about the Halloween parties and the restaurants they go to.

22970,Yessssss keep it coming baby!

22976,At least in Mink.
22977,Wisconsin has been ‚Äúdepopulating‚Äù infected mink by the thousands.
22978,The testing in humans just isn‚Äôt there to differentiate it from regular covid so we won‚Äôt know if/when it jumps.
22979,People have covid fatigue.
22980,They're sick and tired of the restrictions.
22981,They're sick and tired of hearing about it on a daily basis.
22982,To a lot of people hearing about covid is the same as hearing someone beat a dead horse.

22994,"So many people are anti-mask as a political/""value"" position now that getting the compliance needed will be near-impossible."
22995,More shutdowns are tough as people are already pushed to the brink financially.
22996,"The lockdown in the spring was the time to do this right, and the country failed."
22997,He can make sure the vaccine gets out as efficiently as possible.
22998,That‚Äôs really about it.
22999,"A national mask mandate potentially, though at least half of the country probably wouldn‚Äôt follow it so enforcement could be pretty useless."

23026,You're right.
23027,I was trolling.
23028,Clearly different.
23029,Everyone knows the virus spreads amongst football fans celebrating victories but not Democrats celebrating victories.
23030,Michigan's top doc Dr. Khaldun reported 100 people a day will die from COVID in December in Michigan.
23031,Yet we do nothing to stop the spread in Michigan.
23032,"No shutdowns, no enforcement, no laws."
23033,It's like Michigan's government has just given up or wants people to die.
23034,Solid leadership plays a big role.
23035,Imagine a football team where your coach doesn't take precautions to prevent easily preventable injuries.
23036,He's supposed to do what's right to protect his players.
23037,"Sure some players may take their own extra precautions but when it's shunned or shamed by the coach or a majority of other players, what are you going to do?"
23038,"A leader needs to lead by example, support that with proper words and actions."
23039,"As a player, you can't enforce what you know is the right thing to do if you don't have solid leadership to support it."
23040,I blame religion.

23043,"If you wait until there‚Äôs certainty, than it will be too late to react."
23044,"I know that there‚Äôs an awful lot of news on this virus to sift through, but I‚Äôm a virologist and I can assure you that the prospect of a new strain emerging from outbreaks in mink farms is very alarming and Denmark is right to come down on it like a hammer."

Case in point, just got a text from one of my friends yesterday who had the virus (pretty severely) in June."
23050,"Has not been feeling well, symptoms began, now positive again."
23051,"But not an outliner, it‚Äôs happening all over - do a quick google."
23052,"How on earth is herd immunity possible when people can get reinfected after a period of time... the virus is clearly showing it can mutate from person to animal to person (which changes the game completely with immunity, even short-lived, and vaccines)."
23053,This is my own opinion based on spending way too much time reading every study and talking to others directly involved since January...
23054,I think the herd immunity mentality is extremely dangerous.
23055,Playing with fire.
23056,I have no problem being wrong.
23057,"Hell, I want to enjoy things that I used to do again, too."
23058,"But so far, I have seen nothing besides locking down that gives us an upper-hand."
23059,Thankfully they are now talking about doing 6-week lockdown (Ireland style) in the US.
23060,The data is there to support us doing it now.
23061,"Sadly, we have someone running the show still who doesn‚Äôt believe in science."
23062,"We wait until January and things will be so out of control by then, that window of opportunity would have been long gone."
23063,Then we can show the world exactly what this ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù mentality does.
23064,True
23065,True.
23066,Stop spreading fear dude
23067,I'll probably get downvoted for this but I feel like Disney is fairly safe.
23068,It's mainly outdoors.
23069,It's limited attendance.
23070,People are distanced.
23071,They're requiring masks.
23072,They won't even allow people to walk around with exposed noses.
23073,They're kicking out anyone who doesn't comply and keeping their money.
23074,The surrounding state and area is a cesspool I wouldn't want anything to do with.

23079,Come on man.
23080,I am sorry but there‚Äôs no way people won‚Äôt want to return to how it was before Covid.
23081,Let alone people keeping social distance for the next few years and government closing everything.
23082,People will not accept this to dominate their lives as it will be staying and we‚Äôll just have to learn to live with it.

23086,I still need to read and make sure I feel safe doing it(I'm sure it's fine but just haven't looked into) and also see how much money can be made by doing this.
23087,"If it's perfectly safe, and brings in a little extra spending cash, I'm wondering why more people don't do it."
23088,It can make it an official recommendation and incentivise local policy.
23089,It‚Äôs because they stopped testing anyone who showed up.
23090,It‚Äôs appointment only again and only with symptoms.
23091,The changes happened around the time schools opened which leads me to believe it was planned to try and keep numbers stable.
23092,"But it‚Äôs been over close to 1000/day now and our premier opened everything up and our new parameters for entering restricted phases are way too high to be met without very, very high numbers."
23093,Back on the testing we were getting close to 50k/day done and most days are now half that.
23094,Oddly enough we have spikes where we‚Äôre close to 40k completed but our new positives stays the same so our positivity rate jumps around a lot.

23101,Up until a week ago I thought we were one vaccine away from going back to how things were.
23102,"I think the whole world needs a wake up call, I certainly do."
23103,There is no going back to the way things were.
23104,"There maybe a chance of getting close to that but some things have changed permanently, maybe for the better."
23105,But I think the more important point is there is  a chance this is going to mutate faster then we can come up with a vaccine.
23106,People are getting reinfected in under a year.
23107,There‚Äôs a chance this is the new way of the world.
23108,God that‚Äôs so depressing I don‚Äôt even want to think about it.
23109,None of us want to confront that possibility even as it becomes closer to reality.
23110,"For better or worse, not shoving a federal mandate resonates with a bunch of people, including those in the middle."
23111,I don't remember him ever saying not to wear a mask either.
23112,South Dakota doesn't need NYC rules.
23113,"Him choosing not to in his speeches was really just for the photos, messaging that ""we have this under control"", even if it was hilariously misplaced."

23115,Haha this is hilarious.
23116,"We've gone from one dumbass president to another...we're screwed, just in a different way."
23117,"Biden's followers constantly hit the streets and can't stop protesting, stopping at every store and bathroom in the process."
23118,While Trump's base is too stupid to wear a mask (not that it'd matter with their grizzly ass beards anyway) and don't believe covid is real anyway.
23119,I have no idea what you're talking about
23120,"Do they need another reason, or will they always be non-believers?"
23121,"The death toll should never break 1 million in the US, at least not for the next year or so."
23122,"However I think we will have a few more hundred thousand deaths if we keep basically doing fuck all, which is still very bad."
23123,Remind me!
23124,in two months
23125,"To be fair, in a number of cities (NYC to name one), testers were told not to ask if people who tested positive had been to a protest."
23126,"Also, people staying home in large numbers to avoid the violence may have offset some local spikes, according to one study."
23127,"That said, the second wave hit a couple weeks after the first wave of protests."
23128,"Regardless of how you feel about the protests/riots, it's ridiculous to suggest that people gathering in the millions in close proximity and yelling somehow didn't meaningfully spread Covid19."

23142,Ah fair.
23143,I still would be negatively impacted though from having savings and looking to purchase a home.
23144,These I guess outweigh the help I‚Äôm getting due to debt ?
23145,We don't even need to do that.
23146,We need to curb infections to a traceable number.
23147,That's at least two orders of magnitude in reduction.
23148,THEN we can start testing and tracing and move forward.
23149,The rate is far too high right now for testing to be of much use beyond getting a doctor's note and any lenience that might come with a confirmed positive.
23150,"However, we cannot lock down without economic support."
23151,The damage would be far worse than COVID as our nation is woefully unprepared for this kind of event.
23152,"The initial relief might have worked if we controlled things, but it's ended and we need to regain control."
23153,We could also do nothing and say it's the will of God and what will be will be.
23154,Perhaps the church will save us.

23163,That's a great take you got there bud.
23164,No time for that when they're fighting over who gets to plunder space.
23165,Surely one could not generalise the US response like this.
23166,New York and NJ is handling the epidemic almost impeccably and almost as well as poster boys east asia.
23167,"As for comparisons to Europe, well Europe is probably doing alot more testing,and not only that but any virus spread in Europe will not go unnoticed as  deaths will always be far higher than the US due to Europe having the odlest average age of any region in the world bar Japan."
23168,"He (or his staff on his behalf) has already stated that he will push for state governors to make masks mandatory, that he'll use whatever powers he has as president if the governors refuse, and that he won't hesitate to use an executive order making masks mandatory if needed."
23169,And his legal team has already stated that they believe he has the legal power/authority to accomplish this.

23176,Yeah.

23178,The whole government did.
23179,"They didn‚Äôt want a panic, was it wrong?"
23180,Yes.
23181,But hindsight being 20/20 and all no one in the government was doing anything different.

23183,"Yeah, when he didn‚Äôt agree, he argued."
23184,He‚Äôs a dick.
23185,We get that.
23186,"Screwed up resource distribution 

  Yeah, when all the resources get bought up by China at 25% over regular price in the first few weeks of the pandemic, and we make zero of these products here, it‚Äôs almost like we should bring back manufacturing to the us."
23187,Wonder who‚Äôs been talking about that.
23188,"Yeah, I sell gloves and Ppe."
23189,Our stock orders were cancelled and then the price tripled.
23190,Thanks China.
23191,"The bleach thing was a joke, it‚Äôs pretty clear."

23200,"DAMN...that‚Äôs like 10 per capita, we must stop the virus NOW!"
23201,It is  not within the rights of the CDC to do so under the constitution.
23202,That's why we have an amending process that largely hasn't been used.
23203,And it certainly is within the power of the states to ignore and nullify unconstitutional legislation.

23212,Criticizing Trump for his rallies and talking about the importance of masks.
23213,"But now that so many people are getting together to celebrate him, many not wearing masks or social distancing, he has nothing to say about it."
23214,I'm not disagreeing on Europe.
23215,Unless EU did a lockdown at the same time and closed off travel from non EU countries it will be hard for individual countries.
23216,"But UK, US, Canada and other similar countries can do it."

23227,Thank you for dealing in facts.
23228,We need that more than ever.

23238,"Yes, the US isn't doing good (and your stat shows that), but other places are doing FAR worse."
23239,France has like 2.5 the amount of cases per capita and I believe substantially higher deaths.
23240,I'm by no means arguing America is doing great.
23241,But we are absolutely not doing worse.
23242,"Mexico is making us look amazing by comparison, for example."
23243,Just googled it.
23244,We're currently 13th in deaths per capita.
23245,And 11th in cases per capita.

23247,"No worries, snow birds are heading to Florida now and in huge herds just after turkey day."

23250,All this ensures we all get our vote in the election.
23251,True patriots üá∫üá∏.
23252,I 100% agree.
23253,My grandfather was a radioman in WWII in the Pacific theater.
23254,My grandmother was at home helping her family run a small grocery store.
23255,Because they were Asians and their main customers were blacks and Hispanics she said that they were always short on goods due to rationing.
23256,The store just never got the things they needed.
23257,Apparently they prioritized stores and the big stores (run by white people) got the good stuff and everything else went to the smaller stores.
23258,According to her their customers often complained because they thought that they (the store owners) were keeping the best stuff for themselves when the reality was they never got it in the first place.
23259,To this day she complains that they never had enough food and were always hungry even though they ran a grocery store because of rationing.
23260,"If they had taken more than they were supposed to, the feds would've just stopped sending them anything at all."
23261,"Meanwhile, here are being asked to a) stay home if at all possible and b) wear a mask if you can't."
23262,Not only can our generation not do either of these things we whine and moan and groan about just being asked.
23263,Why do I feel that travel to and from Denmark should be closed off.
23264,"Like right now and instead of doing that, in a few months we gonna get a south park meme saying we didn't listen?"
23265,"&gt;If you read the article

[X] doubt"
23266,Yeah would agree with that.
23267,Maybe being a West Ham fan means that I‚Äôm fearful of optimism and it coming back to bite me.
23268,Ha.
23269,But no fair to say the response does seem to have had some positive impact.
23270,But yes a long way to go.
23271,How does this fix change the meaning of the title at all?
23272,"&gt; without the cooperation of 70 million people who A) evidently signed up to the death cult, and B) probably want Biden to fail

There is a non-insignificant number of people who fit that description but I'd be careful about being too broad."
23273,"There are plenty in there that are Republican voters that don't follow the elections and just vote, that don't like Trump but voted for him because he still had some good policies in their eyes, that were scared of what Biden reprensented or would do (just think of how much we heard of Cuban voters in Florida scared Biden was a die-hard socialist), people that are scared Biden would be be too harsh on his covid response with Australia like lockdowns, etc."
23274,I dont know what the number of actual die-hard Trump fans is.
23275,But I think I can safely say it is nowhere near 70M.
23276,European countries also have tourism.
23277,I left that out on purpose.
23278,"Australia and NZ can at least run their factories and physically control each arrival - even if it's 100000, they still come from one or two airports and they can all get traced and quarantined."
23279,"European countries basically don't have borders with each other, that's the point - you could even say that they already don't control their borders under normal times."
23280,"Yea I figured, I wouldn't think they'd kill so many without good reason."
23281,It makes me nervous Wisconsin isn't doing the same and seems to be brushing it under the rug.
23282,Here in Utah we just almost hit 3000 new cases today.
23283,But people here are so tired of the pandemic they just think they can be through with it.
23284,Even though it's not through with us.
23285,"College campuses packed with students, churches still full of people."
23286,It's rediculous.
23287,But it's not exactly small or remote.
23288,It means a fuckton of people live in proximity to each other...
23289,Very worst of the pandemic *so far* ahead?
23290,Your governer is r/FloridaMan
23291,It should be obvious to everyone by now that trump is a symptom of the problem and not the cause.
23292,Humanity is simply way more dumb than most people guesstimated.
23293,Youre 100% right that it isnt going away just because Biden won.
23294,It's not?
23295,"no, states are given more power than the federal govt when the nation is founded."
23296,federal poweres are only later given for things like regulating treasury (don't want 13 different colonies with different currency which would make interstate exchange difficult).
23297,You can't work for two people or two opposite administrations at the same time.
23298,I can't explain this.
23299,Ok but our other strategy was to slam our nuts into the wall and see if it magically disappears soon.
23300,"Actually, the police enforce the law, and many of them have bought into anti-mask garbage aswell."
23301,"At that point, there's nothing we can do"
23302,It really helps.
23303,"Had a friend ask me all astonished ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt go out to eat, really?‚Äù I lughed and said ‚Äúoh hell no."
23304,I like my life.‚Äù He scoffed about a ‚Äúcold‚Äù but it seemed to make him think.
23305,"If that wasn‚Äôt what did it, maybe it was the 4 restaurants in town getting shit down the following day because people with covid went out &amp; infected people."
23306,Numbers are on par with late June and early July.
23307,Falls right in line with the 18 week cycle mentioned in this sub several months ago.
23308,"Biden can act as a president, show leadership and come up with a plan and recommend steps to states and congress and whatever other institutions are in the US."
23309,"The states can decide to follow his recommendations or not, but since he will be an official president in a couple of months it's probably a good idea follow his advice."
23310,"It's pretty volatile, but anybody who bought Bitcoin when it was priced at $16,000 or less is either profitable or only down about 5%."
23311,"https://news.bitcoin.com/price-increase-drives-98-of-bitcoin-holders-in-a-state-of-profit/

Buying some stocks is still a good idea but I fancy the returns of Bitcoin more."
23312,Kentucky wants everywhere to be as shit as Kentucky apparently.
23313,Did you debunk it by saying that most people with long term symptoms would have posted about it in this subreddit like the other guy did?
23314,I'd certainly like to see the followup MRI's you're running to evaluate cardiac damage.
23315,We should protest against the pandemic.
23316,"Get everyone together outside, close together!"
23317,United we stand!
23318,Music to my ears
23319,No.
23320,It gives the nonbelievers another reason to not trust the news.
23321,No country really has figured it out.
23322,"If one country figured it out, same strategy can copy paste the solution.right?"
23323,"federal govt cannot mandate masks/shutdown, etc."
23324,"those are down at the state/local levels, so with 50 different states, they can all do things differently."
23325,"If you wanted a national mask mandate, we can change USA to China then this shit will get under control fast."
23326,I love how your comments were so wrong they got removed and yet people up vote you and downvote me.
23327,This subreddit in a thread.
23328,You should stop trying because I'm scared of your conclusions if you did try.
23329,If you fully control your borders it is your choice what level of restriction you want to have.
23330,If you only get 100 or 100 million visitors you decide how many of them you want to let in.
23331,"Australia and New Zealand travel is one the highest employment  area and % of gdp and they decided to fully close off international arrivals until  a vaccine arrives or just  successful countries (numbers under control, tracing network and restricted international travel)"
23332,Its hard to understand how people are unable to take the simplest precautions for their health.
23333,Is this an inability to delay gratification?
23334,The necessary outcome of pursuing happiness as the penultimate aim of life?
23335,The result of oversaturation of denier culture?
23336,the melding of preachers with far right conspiracy proponents.

23597,Originally their mode was (new covid cases)/(all individual people tested in a single day).
23598,"The new model is (all positive tests for the day)/(all individuals tested for the day), which is what most places use."
23599,There are still a lot of problems with the Florida government and how they‚Äôre handling covid.
23600,I‚Äôm not a DeSatan apologist.
23601,The ban on mask ordinances is directly responsible for the current rise in cases.
23602,It is a mistake to bring night clubs and bars to full capacity.
23603,"I would say the same about indoor dining, but they‚Äôve had almost no change since May."
23604,"Schools are adding to cases, but nowhere near the rates of mass gatherings that are indoors and unmasked."

23607,"The problem is not so much with the numbers in Florida, it‚Äôs with the ridiculous policies designed to spread the virus."

23609,"Meanwhile in NYC, HHC hospitals run at 100% capacity most of the time and have made the news in the past for people dying in waiting rooms (before covid)."

* national mask mandate
* complimentary PPE mailed to every American household 
* national stockpile resupplies and state stockpile reviews continuing well beyond the crisis
* renewing cooperation with WHO and our other world health partners
* aggressive national awareness campaign: tv, print, web
* doubling of testing and contact tracing
* realistic timelines for vaccine availability and plans for its rollout; setting realistic goals in general
* tax advantages for companies with work from home policies; don't just recommend WFH, incentivize it
* essential worker compensation; something Republicans rejected in May and twice again in October
* paid sick leave
* healthcare cost protections"

24152,In case of china maybe 10-10000 pool samples are positive (low positivity rate).
24153,And these possitive samples pools are tested individually without pooling.
24154,Maybe better look would be how china get to the low positivity rate.
24155,3 months complete lockdown and closing borders&amp;travels.
24156,Can say the same about Middleeast people to the US.
24157,"Vitamin D3 , zinc, vitamin C"
24158,Same.
24159,But maybe a little good news - our kids have been back in school for 3-months now and haven‚Äôt missed a single day due to any infections.
24160,It‚Äôs a whole new level of normalcy - so much better than over the Summer.
24161,That was so batshit crazy.
24162,The United States at the beginning of this was still shipping out masks and meltblown fabric to the highest bidder for some fucking insane reason.
24163,That lead to states having to take things into their own hands.
24164,But now we have Joe.
24165,"Who‚Äôs punting the decision making to a commission 

We voted for Joe because he said he would have made all of the right decisions, and we would have ended up like NZ if he were in charge 

Apparently he‚Äôs not so sure of himself now"
24166,Yeah not going to count my chickens yet.
24167,Sunday is typically a low day and there are some displays of a total disregard for the rules that are in place at the moment too.
24168,To be honest I think there are a lot of people pissed off and fatigued by the situation.
24169,"Not sure what the answer really is, but for sure it‚Äôs not to completely give up trying."
24170,No its not.
24171,"""‚ÄúThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined."
24172,Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.
24173,"The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation and foreign commerce."
24174,...
24175,"The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives and liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the State.‚Äù -James Madison"
24176,It's not.
24177,"If you're that fragile, it's potentially 6 months til a vaccine arrives."
24178,Stop being selfish and demanding billions put their lives on hold for you.
24179,"That being said, I believe they will vaccinate the high-risk groups first (as they should)."
24180,"When those groups are protected people will say ""The vulnerable are protected, we want 100% back to normal right now."""
24181,I don't think neither the people nor the economy is going to wait for vaccine-induced herd immunity.
24182,[deleted]
24183,"That's an interesting way to look at it actually, I'll give you that."
24184,[deleted]
24185,"Yes, let's see how covid patients are treated in China and compare it to the US."
24186,We need so many more watchdog groups overseeing this crap
24187,States mandate you wear seatbelts.
24188,The Federal government does not.
24189,"I'm not arguing against masks, I've been wearing one since March."
24190,I'm saying the US government cannot.
24191,Thanks Biden!
24192,I get confused when people just downvote objective statements
24193,"&gt;‚ÄúThe strategy, if you can summarize in one word, is hope,‚Äù said Dr Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Georgia."
24194,"‚ÄúAnd hope is not a strategy.‚Äù

This."
24195,Hope is not a reasonable course of action.
24196,Never has been.
24197,"Yes, however as someone who works in healthcare, those in this business definitely had an eye on this election and how it would effect 'how we do business in 2021'."
24198,"This victory is a signal that help is coming, maybe not today, maybe not in December, but it's coming."
24199,Before this week every hospital and lab kinda felt like they were going at this alone.
24200,50-100 million Americans suffering from long-term side effects?
24201,The hell?
24202,"Have you done ANY actual research into this, besides a reading few fearmongering articles and hearing anecdotal stories from Reddit comments?"
24203,"There have been long-term issues for some, no doubt."
24204,Some people will never be the same.
24205,"But this has only been confirmed in a very small subset of the population of infected, and it's the same population (read: elderly and immunocompromised) that are most at-risk for the virus as a whole."
24206,What do you hope to gain by insinuating that somehow 25% of the US population having severe long-term complications is close to a conceivable outcome?
24207,Lots of people get severe anxiety after coming to this sub and comments like these are part of the reason why.
24208,So many people here complain about misinformation and yet I've seen so much of it be spread here that it's just disheartening.
24209,I for one approve of fear mongering.
24210,It sells newspapers and far more importantly saves lives.
24211,The first two points you made are open to interpretation.
24212,"Vaccines were absolutely mentioned, maybe you should read it again."
24213,You are right about the mask mandate.
24214,"Not in the article, but the first thing pop pop said he was going to do."
24215,My thoughts are it‚Äôs probably all he does.
24216,We are in for more of the same.
24217,I believe my grandma may have coronavirus and I fear for her.
24218,Do you all recommend any home remedies other than vitamins to help combat it and mitigate some of the risk??
24219,Thank you.
24220,Why would I want to make another 100 million if I can rather be mountain biking.
24221,Sounds really stupid to me.
24222,I'm glad each one of us can use life as we see fit.
24223,"You don't need bootstraps if you can just issue another $20 million in stocks, short the market, and then get control back by waiting on the federal government to give you a fat bailout for stock buybacks in 8 months."
24224,This is fantastic news!
24225,Finally things are returning to normal and people aren't buying into the fear anymore.
24226,"&gt; Then COVID will, of course, be extremely serious to Republicans again

&gt; *again*

... covid hasn't ever been serious to Republicans as a group, at all; in fact, *Republicans are the reason we are still dealing with it."
24227,*
24228,[deleted]
24229,"These crowds seem pretty small compared to the Biden Celebrations which have somehow gone somewhat unnoticed on this sub:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-celebration-biden/2020/11/07/d8069040-211a-11eb-b532-05c751cd5dc2_story.html?outputType=amp"
24230,Out of how many tests taken was this?
24231,Worked out pretty well in Victoria Australia and Wuhan China.
24232,Congratulations you guys rockü§ô
24233,China does extreme measures to prevent covid life loss while US doesn't.
24234,"Yes, China values human lives more than US."
24235,"Sure the Chinese government values human life, thats why they ran unarmed students over with tanks in 1989 and why millions were killed by Maos incompetence, and why they are now constantly threatening to invade Taiwan."
24236,&gt; You are flat out stupid.
24237,Thanks for the entertainment.
24238,&gt;&gt;Yes.
24239,And I very clearly I explained why.
24240,And btw my IQ is rough 140.
24241,GOT IT!
24242,WHOA
24243,"yeah, definitely this season is a bag full of shit buried under a pile of shit."
24244,i can definitely relate to the happier when exercising but getting up to do it.
24245,is there anything else that makes you happy that doesn't require getting out?
24246,maybe a little of that kind of happiness will make it easier to get up and exercise.
24247,"True, but that was a protest and this is a party."
24248,"In NY yesterday, people were muuuuch closer for long periods of time eating/drinking than they were during the protests."
24249,"I hate to say this, but we completely lost containment on this a long time ago."
24250,"Positive cases yesterday were the highest it has ever been, and it was on a WEEKEND, when cases typically go down."
24251,There are still over two months of Trump and those are going to be the two worst months of the year.
24252,"Not only is the weather more favorable for COVID, but we have the trifecta of holidays that has COVID salivating, Thanksgiving, Christmas (Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and whatever else there is in December), and of course New Years."
24253,I just dont see people not traveling or going home to celebrate with their families while spreading the virus during the next two months.
24254,And i dont see us cancelling it like china did for their CNY earlier this year.
24255,"This sounds all doom and gloom, but i just dont see this turning around here anytime soon..."
24256,Typical fear-mongering article.
24257,"It's more dangerous because of exponential growth, not because the virus has become ""far more dangerous""."
24258,"Wait, you don't have test kits in US?"
24259,But POTUS says you have the most testing in the world.
24260,But 2 million possible deaths.
24261,Something about how the best option for fighting this virus is rounding up all the Republicans and putting them in prison.
24262,This nasty election and this nasty virus has turned a lot of people nasty too.
24263,I‚Äôm not by any stretch of the imagination saying that covid was handled well.
24264,It wasn‚Äôt.
24265,"But, it‚Äôs a severe revision of history to say that h1n1 was."
24266,"It ended up spreading across the whole world, and became endemic and one of the most common forms of the flu in circulation every year from 2009-2019."
24267,"If it turned out to be as deadly as they originally thought, it would have been a massive disaster."
24268,It was only pure luck that it turned out to not be particularly deadly.
24269,"Or just to cynically get it running *completely* out of control so that the numbers will continue to skyrocket after Biden takes office, and then the 6 week lag time for deaths will put the worst period of mayhem during the beginning of Biden‚Äôs tenure."
24270,"Then COVID will, of course, be extremely serious to Republicans again, and people will be dumb enough to believe that it is Biden‚Äôs fault."
24271,USA NUMBER ONE BABY!!
24272,!
24273,Depending on the runoffs as far as the Senate goes.
24274,"Unfortunately strict authoritarian governments can enforce stricter lockdowns, but like someone said, there are plenty of ways to come up with money for our citizens."
24275,Federally legal Marijuana is another.
24276,Your takeaway is why the US is the surrender monkey poster
24277,I don‚Äôt think anyone thought the virus itself would disappear.
24278,That‚Äôs just foolish.
24279,I think the idea was that the mainstream media would stop cramming virus news down everyone‚Äôs throat.
24280,We‚Äôll see if that actually happens or not
24281,"Open streets vs stadiums where there are choke points (scanning tickets, bathrooms, lines for food, taking masks off to eat/drink)."
24282,"So, I guess my question is, who pays them?"
24283,They aren't officially part of the government yet.
24284,Does the DNC cover these costs until they are in their semi permanent home in washington?
24285,Just like you get used to NOT wearing a mask.
24286,The day is coming.
24287,"Again, I have no qualms with Warp Speed."
24288,But I don't think him allowing government healthcare workers to work on an obvious healthcare need is proof his serious commitment to combating COVID.
24289,"I guess give him credit for not opposing the project,  but that is not my hurdle for being serious."
24290,"Just as I don't give any president personal credit for every single thing the federal government does because they are the one that signs the budget, I don't see allowing this project to move ahead as him personally making any contribution or commitment to that project beyond what we'd expect any reasonable person to do in such a circumstance."
24291,I'm not trying to hold him to some standard where it would be impossible to get credit for anything and in my prior post I highlighted some areas where I believe he could have demonstrated a serious commitment through his own personal actions and words.
24292,"I respect if you do find this project shows that Trump seriously committed to combating COVID, but I don't find it convincing enough to alter my opinion on his shown commitment to stopping the virus."
24293,"You're right, my article does come across as too suspicious as I can't point to solid evidence of misuse of funds."
24294,"I was trying suggest that his focus might have been pure, but I don't think that allegation is necessary to the thrust of my argument and is a distraction."
24295,"In Canada,  I believe they started limiting movement of workers between facilities."
24296,"Not sure exactly how it was implemented but in general,  it sounds like there is better control in nursing homes now."
24297,"Government was slowly allowing in person visiting but as we ramp up infection in the general population, I  would be surprised if they don't limit in person visiting."
24298,It‚Äôs going to change the amount of respect other countries have for us and hopefully the amount of respect we can have for each other.
24299,Trump turned this country against itself and hopefully with Biden we can at least start the unity this nation needs.
24300,Both sides (Red and Blue) matter.
24301,"Dems voted out Trump, not the tenets of Republicans and Conservatives."
24302,That man was a mockery of what the title of POTUS should stand for.
24303,"We can find a middle and safe ground for this nation and everyone in it, it just wasn‚Äôt happening with a selfish human like Trump."
24304,"It‚Äôs not gonna be fixed over night and not even after Biden‚Äôs term, but it gives the nation a better chance to better itself than we did with Trump in control."
24305, they are actually spot on and there might be a new Coronavirus task force being formed by Biden on Monday.
24306,Let's wait and see how would that coronavirus task force deal with this virus I'm guessing they're going to copy what do new zealanders and the South Koreans did against the virus.
24307,in-depth discussion on that one goes to r/politics
24308,There will be a strategy in January.
24309,Adults will be in the white house again soon.
24310,And yet New Zealand isn't doing any testing to prevent another cold storage outbreak.
24311,They still don't take the possibility seriously.
24312,"Too complacent, if it pops up through cold storage again the government there will only have themselves to blame."
24313,Most people are followers.
24314,I think you will start to see a shift in public opinion on masks when you stop having this constant anti mask rhetoric being spewed day after day.
24315,Also I think you just argued an important point.
24316,Biden‚Äôs job will be to try and change people‚Äôs attitudes around COVID.
24317,Being a president isn‚Äôt just policy it‚Äôs leadership.
24318,I remember that was talk that Chelsea Clinton would take over most of the ceremonial aspects of the First Lady/First Gentleman/Spouse if her mother was elected in 2016.
24319,Because Bill was in the unique position of being a previous President as well.
24320,"Health department, not police."
24321,"At least here in KY the police dont enforce it, the local health departments issues fines to businesses who dont enforce mask mandates and can force them to shut down their lobbies or temporarily close their doors."
24322,The police dont and wont enforce any mask mandates here.
24323,The reason that our area doesn't enforce any of beshear's mandates is because they're understaffed and dont have the funding/manpower to do it.
24324,You mean like US drone killing arabs and muslims
24325,That happened in April.
24326,"If there are more deaths now, did they change the rules?"
24327,Let's say they listed 90% of all covid deaths as pneumonia in April.
24328,"Let's say there are more deaths in October, and they still under report by 90% of the cases."
24329,"Then they would still report an increase, would they not?"
24330,Yet the reported numbers are going down.
24331,"Last weekend antigen tests were carried out on 3.625 million people ‚Äì of whom 38,359, or 1.06%, were found to be positive."
24332,This weekend it's looking like 0.6%
24333,They‚Äôre not.
24334,Not even close.
24335,Source: someone who isn‚Äôt just watching on tv
24336,The virus doesn't infect according to the importance of what you are doing.
24337,I would keep schools opened over bars forever... but unfortunately if you want to stop it you need to close all schools.
24338,"Once per season after this year, ""At least they aren't the Trumps!"""
24339,lockdowns are horrible
24340,Doesn't mean a great deal in terms of how long it will take to eradicate though.
24341,"More chances for an extra generation of spread, so a couple of weeks at most, but nowhere near what some will take from comparing numbers."
24342,That‚Äôs not normal at all
24343,I agree absolutely.
24344,It is hard to imagine how confidentiality rules preclude *any* kind of explanation of what happened.
24345,This is far left political rhetoric not based in reality though.
24346,You guys keep repeating this but it doesn't make sense.
24347,That‚Äôll do what?
24348,"It does spread in crowds, but people who protest masks are also the people who don't get tested and think Dr's are going inject computers into their bodies."
24349,"It did spread at the blm protests, but a lot of people also wore masks so they couldn't be identified, which helped out a lot."
24350,"And the ones who do test positive won't want to admit they were around thousands of other people, because they'll feel responsible."
24351,But there were definitely people who got sick and died from blm protests.
24352,Not everything makes the news.
24353,It‚Äôll be interesting to see if the Biden transition starts influencing strategy even before he‚Äôs sworn in.
24354,Sometimes people are just waiting for true leadership to do the right thing.
24355,Months ago he already criticized Biden for not implementing a mask policy.
24356,Just like he criticized Obama for not dealing with COVID well.
24357,Reality is fluid in his mind.
24358,What do you mean?
24359,Do you disagree with this?
24360,"Also, if 10% of global population was infected, it means the survival rate is 99.85%"
24361,[removed]
24362,"That kinda makes sense, but if your in the running to be president, would it be that hard to be near Washington?"
24363,What are you doing in wherever that is more important?
24364,When did I say anything about capitalism?
24365,I certainly wasn‚Äôt making any points about capitalism or socialism.
24366,Or any other economic model.
24367,"my Aunt was the first official Covid Death of Nova Scotia, April 6th, seems like years ago now,"
24368,Be clear.
24369,You want condemnation.
24370,Fauci stated he didn‚Äôt agree with large gatherings when asked about BLM protests so I assume he‚Äôd say the same now.
24371,"Great read, thank you for sharing!"
24372,2021 I guess?
24373,I've noticed some hand sanitizers feel like they leave residue on your skin.
24374,"Like when I go to wash my hands, it feels like something is washing off."
24375,But then some hand sanitizers dry up pretty well after you use them.
24376,Why is it?
24377,Is one better than the other?
24378,Will they both get rid of the virus?
24379,Probably winning by spring gone by summer.
24380,[deleted]
24381,"&gt;t didn't seem like the BLM marches and protests caused much spread 

Absolutely true."
24382,Yet the media kept pretending that anything Trump or church related causes outbreaks
24383,You mean like the USA
24384,"I don‚Äôt find them comfortable, at all, and tbh i miss seeing faces."
24385,"If anything they‚Äôre a constant reminder of the pandemic, and I cannot wait until they‚Äôre not needed."
24386,Mammon must feed!
24387,"I don't know about you guys, but they could not pay me enough to take over the reigns at the WH."
24388,"January 20: body count will reach 350,000 and the economy will be in bad shape."
24389,There won‚Äôt be a stimulus package in this divided senate and political climate anyways.
24390,"Hopefully everybody is so fed up by January 20, that real measures and strategies can be implemented to turn it around."
24391,"With decisive action, a vaccine and spring on the horizon, there might be light at the end of the tunnel in April/May 2021."
24392,But a lot of suffering first
24393,True especially that Alex Jones video with all the people screaming without mask
24394,"Black Death Friday, ftfy..."
24395,I'm sure they'll try and turn it around come January.
24396,Thank fuck Biden has won.
24397,Yup.
24398,I saw maskless Biden parties here in NYC.
24399,The hypocrisy is outstanding.
24400,"I would like to remind everyone, that all you are asked to do, is wait until vaccines are available without killing anybody."
24401,"Any futher crying about not being willing to do that, is just overly disgusting."
24402,Nothing weird about racism.
24403,China the only g20 nation with positive economy also.
24404,Fuck your shitty strategies.
24405,This is a village to village.
24406,Province to province issue.
24407,Make the area as inhospitable to the virus as possible.
24408,"Then make it tolerable to humans to do their ""necessary"" interpersonal commerce."
24409,This isn't that difficult.
24410,"Inanimate object, sanitize and protect 

Live humans, quarantine and isolate."
24411,What is wrong is that we are depending on bureaucracy to solve something which is a personal issue.
24412,"Wear your masks, Gate everything you come in contact with, don't congregate with unknown people."
24413,Religion and (as mentioned above) libertarianism.
24414,They are strict on letting people in bars because alcohol is the devil.
24415,"They do not tell people what to do in a pandemic because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot the government‚Äôs business‚Äù to tell people what to do with their own bodies even if their safety and lives are at risk...*oh, wait*..."
24416,"&gt;  There actually is a strategy, which is a multifaceted approach involving both doing nothing, **as well as spreading misinformation** and normalizing mass death."
24417,And no better place for this than the recommended place for corona information on Reddit.
24418,"This ""gotcha"" attitude is the reason we have additional million+ deaths and counting."
24419,The rules of this sub prevents me to say what exactly you deserve for having an attitude like this.
24420,&gt; pandemic fatigue.
24421,This will be the biggest factor.
24422,People aren't going to keep isolating for another year.
24423,"We're now looking at ""ruining"" christmas for millions of families, which is going to push a lot of them over the edge of not giving a shit anymore."
24424,Then tell them they need to continue like this until late summer or autumn?
24425,I don't see that going well.
24426,There somewhat is logic to it.
24427,"While viruses themselves aren't a living organism, they exhibit many growth attributes similar to living organisms through their ability to hijack living cells."
24428,"Our ability to survive, and other animals etc, is based on availability of resources; food, water and shelter."
24429,Now consider that humans are the resources for viruses.
24430,"So a virus will spread to it's maximum the resources within you body will allow, and through however it spreads, to other humans."
24431,So it's just a resource thing.
24432,"As less become available it slows down, e.g."
24433,"previously infected that might be immune, sparsely populated area


A virus also doesn't know if a particular mutation will be more successful or not."
24434,What we see is essentially trial and error.
24435,"Some mutations will spread too slow, and be killed off by our immune system before it can spread."
24436,Some will do too much damage and incapacitate the host too quickly to be effectively spread.
24437,The ones that are left are in that sweet spot where we don't kill it too quickly and it doesn't kill us too quickly.
24438,"For example, we may regularly get a variation of the same strain of flu virus."
24439,"By this manner, the flu virus is able to get past our immune system and reuse the available resources."
24440,Which is why we have regular flu seasons.
24441,"Fauci would say a lot of things, but his primary policy would be lockdowns."
24442,That's the only solution offered by public health experts these days.
24443,"Keep the country on lockdown until a vaccine arrives, regardless of how much this costs."
24444,"If I start a fire in the kitchen, and do nothing to contain it and leave the room, do I blame my roommate for not putting it out fast enough?"
24445,"With all due respect, I don't understand how any part of you thought you were making a good point when you typed that."
24446,Never said it was a good strategy.
24447,"How dare you ask that question here in the temple of objectivity, science and freedom of speech."
24448,Watch yourself getting down-voted to crap.
24449,It depends on the gathering and its message.
24450,"The May and following months of protests were deemed justified and necessary, while political rallies and anti-lockdown protests were irresponsible and excessive."
24451,"Anyways, we'll see what happens in these cities in two weeks."
24452,Being outdoors with masks &gt; social distancing
24453,This is an opinion from watching too much left leaning news that is trying to find things to attack Trump on.
24454,"We have mass PPE and testing, emergency hospitals set up, a vaccine on the way, mask ordinances, but somehow we're ""doing nothing."""
24455,"Sorry, the disease doesn't care if you think Trump doesn't take it seriously."
24456,What goes on in Trump's head has absolutely zero to do with contradicting all that is being done.
24457,Germany does this
24458,Is it a comfort thing?
24459,Some masks are definitely more comfortable than others
24460,Because memory T-cell immunity isn't a thing?
24461,"Did the media comment on the massive celebrations in major cities at all, like when they condemned the POTUS' rallies?"

&gt;While public health experts quibbled with the report‚Äôs self-serving claim that the governor‚Äôs policy wasn‚Äôt a factor in COVID-19 nursing home deaths, they nevertheless agreed with the report‚Äôs broader conclusion that nursing home staffers as well as visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes."

24716,If 2% of the placebo group had symptoms so bad they‚Äôre hospitalised but 0.1% of the vaccine group have the same outcome then you have proven effectiveness.
24717,"Regardless all this is speculation - we will know more when the results are announced and, if approved, stage IV monitoring can begin."
24718,I don‚Äôt think we are putting our lives on hold while we wait for a vaccine - I don‚Äôt believe the decisions to lockdown should be linked to a potential vaccine yet to be proven effective.
24719,"Pretty sure that if the vaccine isn‚Äôt approved we will have more lockdown periods, rightly or wrongly."
24720,Looks like another great and promising drug to never hear of again.. just like every other one.
24721,"Gets tiring , hope this one actually goes forward :-)"

24728,30 years since he passed and I still miss him terribly.
24729,The fact that so many kids today could miss out on that special bond and love is beyond awful.
24730,Yeah.
24731,My mom often refers to Trump‚Äôs lack of empathy as a disqualifier when she‚Äôs conversing or casually debating with someone.
24732,"I have to remind her that these people think we pretend to give a shit about people, so you can‚Äôt appeal to that."
24733,"If liberals would focus on the economic strength of their arguments, it at least has some potential."
24734,"I imagine though, the Trump crowd will lose interest 2 sec into the explanation and instead hitch their wagon to the red faced buffoon yammering about trade wars and stock market booms"
24735,Better to them is wildly different than better to the rest of us.
24736,"Better for them could be getting rid of all the ""inferior"" people and leaving a more ""pure"" world."
24737,It could also mean more min wage slaves to keep the profit train going and keep spending stupid amounts of money in increasingly stupid manners.
24738,"For example, a brand new &gt;$10000 garbage bin for their company to show off against other companies and look like you have a big dick (real story a boss told me about)."

24743,if those two data points hold a trend that would be good news indeed
24744,Yah just sucks the best humans will never be the powerful ones
24745,Yeah sure.
24746,Are you assuming I live in the US and only hate China because of that?
24747,"Because you're dead wrong, I do not live in the US."
24748,"Keep your stupid fucking irrelevant whataboutism in your head where it belongs, right next to your foolish assumptions that only US citizens hate the disgusting things China does to the world."
24749,I hope your grandkids don't like seafood!

24769,"Yes, I saw that article and in that case the test did falsely identify dead virus fragments but there are also plenty of cases where someone goes from positive with symptoms to negative testing with no symptoms and back to positive."
24770,Which if that article were the case for everyone there would be no negative period in the middle.
24771,That article is also not very recent and the virus usually takes a few months before it can reinfect someone according the majority of articles I browsed.
24772,This study was done in may which is too early for reinfections to appear.
24773,On top of all that if there was definitive evidence against reinfection the news would be everywhere because it would be huge.

24801,Not much longer tho
24802,We've got two months before Biden takes office who will undoubtedly give much more of a shit.
24803,"No individualist solution will be sufficient unless people are given the right to defend themselves against the virus, i.e."
24804,shoot people who aren‚Äôt wearing masks on sight.
24805,Did I say you've mentioned capitalism?
24806,"As far as I recall you only mentioned marxism by a brief comment about that being your ideology but solely as a personal information, at no point did you use that as an argument about anything."
24807,You do seem pretty hung up on stuff like sports associations not wanting to sit down and wait for a vaccine.
24808,"As I said, if you have other issues that you want to solve, than people dying from this novel pathogen, then solve them."
24809,"If people have difficulties making their businesses survive, demand that there is a collaborative effort to help them pay their bills until lockdowns are over."
24810,"If people are getting fired, demand that their pay be substituted, but don't expect that proposals about allowing a virus to apply a little racial hygiene, is in anyway acceptable in 2020."
24811,"""It just spreads when it has the opportunity."""
24812,Exactly.
24813,And Biden or anyone else wont  be able to do anything about it.
24814,It spreads and the way you slow it down is by distancing and hygiene.
24815,Masks unfortunately don't do much.
24816,Quite the opposite.
24817,They provide false sense of security.
24818,From what I read and what I saw in the data so far I predict .15-.30% mortality rate at worse when all countries go trough it by the end of winter.
24819,Than it's  business as usual.
24820,It becomes endemic.
24821,"Hopefully we get a safe vaccine for people that want to get vaccinated (older, susceptible and all others) and we will be on our way to better days."
24822,Pepperidge farm remembers
24823,I genuinely don‚Äôt get it.
24824,I will acknowledge the flaws of the US.
24825,I can condemn the cages at the border but still say the literal concentration camps targeting a religious minority in China are worse.
24826,"I can acknowledge that the US covid response has been bad but still admit I‚Äôd prefer it to being welded in my own house by the government, or taken away by soldiers in a van to a quarantine camp because I was exposed to covid."
24827,I mean come on people- the fact that we can complain about the US publicly shows how much better off we are than China.
24828,You can‚Äôt even use google over there because you might see information the government doesn‚Äôt approve of.
24829,The tier system in CA seems to work ok.
24830,The level of lockdown scales with the tiers.

24840,That matches this timeline.
24841,I'm guessing your issue is you just read headlines instead of actually reading the articles so you have no idea what's going on and then say shit like thisb
24842,Yes I will trust Waldo_Pepper62 on an internet forum more than I will almost every scientist in the world

24865,"Does it make sense to limit in-person visits, while at the same time putting infected people next to our seniors?"
24866,Because poor crowd aversion doesn't care about party lines.
24867,"Yes, that‚Äôs what I said"
24868,"Nursing home deaths are usually added every Tuesday, and I think now that things are getting worse, there is also a count every Friday."
24869,What it would take to get rid of the virus is throwing all the mask non-compliant into quarantine camps and letting the virus rip all the way through them.
24870,Of course democrats are not going to do this because they have no balls.
24871,Sports are supposed to be political according to BLM...so which is it.
24872,Are they a stage for politics and messages.

24890,Doesn't sound like any dialect I know lol.
24891,Definitely not pinyin.
24892,"With all due respect though, I'm not sure I agree with you."
24893,Your explanation about the mandate of heaven seems a bit idealistic.
24894,Also you can't quantify the fact that China values human life more than any country.
24895,China is a collectivist culture and they value society and order above all else.
24896,The sacrifice of the individual for the greater good of all and future generations.
24897,Valuing lives for lives sake isn't the reality.
24898,"I don't think they actually care about the people so much as the product of the people (society, order, economy, etc)."
24899,"This is not a good or bad thing, just a cultural perspective, I think, and not unique to just China."
24900,The biggest difference is that majority of people yesterday and the blm protests were wearing masks.
24901,There wasn't any huge statistical evidence that blm protests were increasing covid spread significantly.
24902,"Meanwhile trumps rallies have been linked to increased spread, most likely because of the fact that people refuse to wear masks."
24903,But I agree I don't want to see these big crowds when we have 100k covid a day
24904,"&gt;They won't be sick of hearing about it when they have it, they'll want to know everything they can do to survive."
24905,I don't believe even that.
24906,Not after what I have seen in the last months.
24907,I truly believe that the majority of the population does not have enough intelligence (anymore) to be afraid of getting severely sick and ending disabled for the rest of their lives or even dead.
24908,And they care even less for other people.
24909,"And because of that, the pandemic will not end when the vaccines are available."
24910,"I think most will refuse to get it, for a lot of reasons."
24911,"I think we haven't seen anything yet, it will get *far* worse in the next decades."
24912,"The number of new cases is not decreasing (yet), but the steepness of the curve in fact is."
24913,"So essentially just like under Trump, under Biden the shutdowns will be still up to state discretion??"
24914,?
24915,&gt;Good luck with that being effective when staff have two or three nursing home jobs so they can feed themselves.
24916,Why not subsidize these people?

24928,That is excess deaths for the year by week.
24929,"You see early in the year the red line aligns with the gray lines, then spikes in March as NYC and the northeast is hit hard."
24930,Those total excess death numbers represented by the red line gradually drop and now for most age groups are below the gray line that represents the average number death in the past 5 years.
24931,"Some have pointed to the lag in reporting, but when the reporting lags were worse they never dropped below the past 5 year average."
24932,They do so now for all age groups below 74.
24933,"I did not participate, kept the celebrations to at home, Champagne and a quadruple dose of edibles"

24963,The increase in massive crowd gatherings since the beginning of the summer has me thinking most people already don't care.
24964,Massive crowds are the *single most obvious* thing that can spread the virus.
24965,"People seem pretty comfortable doing it anyway, and it doesn't seem to be narrowed down by political leaning, race, age, or location."
24966,The fatigue grows stronger every day and politicians are feeling more and more powerless against it.
24967,"If a governor is willing to say thousands of people gathering at a political rally is fine, people are a lot less trusting of them when they say everyone needs to wear a mask and stand six feet apart at all times."
24968,"Maybe by the time governors are up for reelection most people will have forgotten all about the mixed messaging, but there's no doubt that a lot of them have their own perception in that context on their mind whenever they issue a public advisory or statement about restrictions."
24969,There are lots of federal agencies for specific things that are clearly within the fed government's purview.

25092,They found that those who had protested had a similar incidence of Covid relative to those who hadn‚Äôt.
25093,"The state concluded that a combination of 1) Being outside 2) masks (the department of health were at protests handing out masks so compliance was virtually 100%) and 3) movement,  meant that the protests were not likely to trigger super spreading events, despite the lack of social distancing."

25095,Is masking virtually 100%?
25096,Are people sharing drinks?

25111,"I'm certainly a little more optimistic than i was 2-3 weeks ago, considering our full lockdown has only just come into place, it indicates that the stricter regional lockdowns we had were starting to have an affect at slowing the rate at which cases were spreading, it just took a little while to see the impact."

-Immediately imposed travel bans to infected regions."
25122,Trump banned a few flights from China to a few airports.
25123,- Immediately instituted testing at adequate levels (recall the CDC's delays because they _had_ to develop their own test and then they shipped defective kits while preventing private labs and hospitals from administering tests).
25124,- Instituted mandatory masks in public.
25125,Took random temperatures in public areas.
25126,- Initiated contact tracing and instituted mandatory quarantining if positive or exposed to those testing positive.
25127,- These countries provided supplementary income to those hospitalized or quarantined.
25128,They spent less by not sending checks to everyone and to Trump's favorite businesses spending and borrowing trillions the U.S. doesnt have (as the U.S. did).
25129,"Using these tactics, other countries didn't have to shut down their economies."
