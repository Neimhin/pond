14,I'm Canadian and this bothers me too since our borders and economies are intertwined.
15,We have family members living in the opposite sides of the border.
16,We're joined at the hip.
17,Two months ago Canada was at 8% while US was at 25% first doses.
18,"If trends kept up, US should be at 70+% first doses now."
19,Canada is now at 45.7%.
20,With our pace we will overtake before end of this week.
21,I'm afraid that a vaccine resistant variant could emerge and we will all be back to square one.
22,"Yea right.. in Maryland, security guards would post at the front door specifically to stop anyone who didn't have a mask."
23,Months later they started supplying people with masks before entering the store.
24,The vaccine works against every variant where they've tested it.
25,"Scientists tend to be very cautious about making definite statements, so they'll say there might be some variant in the future where it won't work."
26,"Sure, we can't prove there won't be."
27,But there's no specific reason to expect it.

37,Thank you for this.
38,I was not aware of the truth that's been right in front of me all along.
39,A significant amount of the 11-15 age group should be vaccinated in that time.
40,The cleaning did nothing.
41,Surface contamination is minimal and there are very few cases where people got sick that way.
42,"Social distancing obviously works, but so do masks, so as a compromise, wearing masks doesn't seem like much of a cost."
43,"So we all meeting up at Kings Island and going maskless this year, or what?"
44,I gotta free The Beast.
45,What are the actual symptoms?
46,Even cold like symptoms count as being symptomatic but are obviously mild.
47,[University of Hawaii's post/statement](https://www.hawaii.edu/covid19/vaccinate/requirement-students-faqs/) about the vaccine requirement as [reported by KHON2](https://www.khon2.com/coronavirus/university-of-hawaii-to-require-covid-19-vaccinations-for-on-campus-students-this-fall/)
48,Don’t be ridiculous.
49,Dental pain is worse than any problems coronavirus can causes
50,I feel like it’s ripping parts of society to shreds.
51,:/
52,But you are indeed picking a fight.
53,It’s how the internet works…
54,The latter is clearly someone who is discussing that in the context of the fact that they will not be wearing a mask.
55,We know Republicans have lower vaccination rates and a knee-jerk opposition to masks that will lead many to lie and unmask.
56,Where do you see the airport enforcement continuing?
57,It also makes a lot of things so convenient.
58,I went without social media for the better part of the last year and I missed a lot.
59,"Like my family kept me in the loop for important events, but I missed so much little stuff."
60,Is that a real threat though?
61,People always talk about it but I’ve never seen any evidence that it’s a thing that could actually happen.
62,"Let's face it, with climate change they weren't having much of a future anyways."
63,"As someone who had Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis when I was young, more attention needs to be given to this."

69,"This entire thread was about the US, I don’t know why you feel the need to comment here then."

71,I had no idea they'd turned it into stripmalls.
72,TIL
73,Forever if she's a keeper.
74,Trust what she tells you for now.
75,Get vaccinated if you don't wanna die then.
76,It's my problem if these fucks get my kids sick.
77,"Oh well, I just booked a flight to Miami tomorrow."
78,I’ll be back on 6/15 folks!
79,"But more seriously, this is the right move."
80,"By 6/15, cases and deaths nationwide will be so low that lifting mask mandates altogether will be a relatively uncontroversial decision, except among a few cranks on r/coronavirus."
81,"And it’s only a month away, ffs!"
82,(P.S.
83,"In case the Covid police decides to come after me, I received my 2nd dose more than two weeks ago, got lucky with some leftovers)"
84,"Instead of downvoting you, I ask, what’s a case rise without a rise in hospitalizations or deaths?"
85,"Yes, variants, and we shouldn’t tempt fate until we get a variant we can’t control with a vaccine, but we ran off that road of not tempting fate around the time it was suggested we drink bleach and shove a light up our ass."
86,"Apparently they're very unlucky by the odds, or they were simply lying about getting the vaccine."
87,"Neat info, thanks."
88,All I am gonna say is one of the Mainstreets in CO
89,&gt;Their most important advice is that unvaccinated need to continue to wear masks.
90,How do you propose that is followed if everyone ditches masks?
91,I'd love an answer to this too.
92,"As someone with a high risk kid living in a plague rat den, wtf?"
93,I will never understand why people are such babies about masks.
94,"Also, if this does backfire, is everyone going to be willing to lock down again?"
95,From what I keep seeing on these covid subs the majority opinion seems to be: vaccinated = pandemic over.
96,So my guess is no.
97,"So not only will we have the stubborn deniers that we've already had, now we'll have stubborn vaccinated deniers too."
98,"I'm convinced that a lot of the people cheering this on and saying that it'll, somehow, convince enough people to get vaccinated are underestimating the sheer amount of stubborn willful ignorance we're dealing with."
99,"It seems to me like the CDC is acknowledging that we can’t end COVID in the US, since we’re not even projected to reach herd immunity at this point."
100,So now they’re issuing guidance intended to keep people from being hospitalized and dying.
101,"People at most risk from COVID should have been fully vaccinated for months now, middle aged people and young adults should have one shot by now which gives them partial immunity and greatly reduces their chances of a bad COVID infection, and children have always had a low chance of a bad case and an abysmally low chance of death from COVID."
102,"They’re basically saying that they know COVID will continue to spread in the US, but people will no longer be dying and going to the hospital at nearly the same rates we saw before the vaccines."
103,"And that’s OK. Life isn’t risk free, it’s unreasonable for the CDC and governments to completely eliminate all risk from COVID before life goes back to normal."
104,We were very intentional about this from the start.
105,There was/is a difference between telling your kids that they need to give other people distance so that there was less chance that people would spread germs vs. teaching your child to fear other people.
106,"Also, some kids were like that before the pandemic, so it's hard to know where that behavior comes from."
107,At this point we're just soldiering on with our masking/ general social distancing until nursery school starts up in the fall.
108,We've endured so much in the past year; to get this dumb disease now would be insult on top of injury.
109,Just another example of American globalism.

126,…But that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
127,The beauty of the free market.
128,You get to decide where to shop 😊
129,I think the CDC saying masks are no longer required for vaccinated people was the best decision they could have made.
130,"I've talked with some acquaintances who were on the fence about getting vaccinated before, and who didn't want to go and get the vaccine."
131,But now they're going to get it.
132,They're reasoning?
133,"Everyone was using masks so they didn't feel the need to get the shot, but now with everyone about to not wear masks anymore, they feel the need to be more protected now."
134,They don't trust the unvaccinated to wear masks and want to be protected against them.
135,I appreciate your perspective.
136,Maybe I am more aware of how long I delayed to get the vaccine than others are.
137,They don’t ask for proof of vaccination either so none of the employees are wearing masks except for the ones with small children at home where I am at.
138,Half the store isn’t actually vaccinated.
139,Wash over - like the hundreds of thousands of cases per day this past winter?
140,They are both dumb.
141,You simply don't enforce.
142,"At some point no one will wear a mask, and that will be it."
143,"If businesses think Americans will honestly self enforce no mask if you are vaccinated, they are just as dumb as 50% of the US."
144,i’m gen z but got my second dose a week ago
145,&gt; The anti-maskers already weren't wearing masks.
146,Not in my state they weren't.
147,They weren't allowed in any stores without a mask and were kicked out immediately.
148,This change means they'll soon be able to enter without a mask.
149,Why?
150,‘To protect others’.
151,They have their vaccine so why does it matter if I don’t?
152,‘Because the vaccine doesn’t stop you spreading it’.
153,so why would I take it?
154,‘It lessens the side effects’.
155,"If it being asymptomatic isn’t made up, then I’ve had coronavirus many times and there’s been no side effects."
156,"Please, give me a reason to get the vaccine, and I’ll counteract it."
157,If I can’t think of something then I’ll consider getting it
158,Yes... non vaccinated people will totally comply...
159,"Hmm, I get it."
160,Kids can't get the vaccinated for the most part.
161,"That lady will soon find that she probably can't be taking her kids with her everywhere for a little while, or she will have to accept the risks."
162,"I would probably worry, too, and I reckon I'll pop my mask on if I find myself getting near kids, just for the parents peace of mind."

164,Good!

171,Just because I didn't want to lie to the pharmacy about my eligibility doesn't mean I 'stalled'.
172,I got the earliest appointment I could get.
173,I don't care whether you want to wear the mask or not at this point.
174,Just as I don't care whether the mandate ends tomorrow or next month.
175,"It means that even with masks required, unvaccinated people infect each other."
176,I’m answering the question of what about all the places where cases didn’t go up when mask mandates are removed.
177,I’m tired of the changing goalposts here as I’ve patiently explained my reasoning and even given a source or two.
178,I’m not predicting the apocalypse but I’m expecting cases to increase as a result of these changes due to unvaccinated people infecting each other.
179,"No shit if I lived in a country like the US where thousands were dying every day, I would take a mask over death."
180,But luckily I live in Vietnam where we don’t have to worry about it anymore.
181,A pediatrician wouldn't be considered an expert on COVID in children?

188,"Also, I had heard the shedding theory a few weeks ago."
189,Then I was thinking about it again a few days ago and realizing only the priorities themselves could actually be shed.
190,mRNA programming cells to produce mRNA lives currently in the realm of fantasy.
191,I think a lot of people that are holdouts are waiting for final authorization and / or to see how it might interact with other common vaccines or life events.
192,"Not saying I'm agreeing with that, or that that's all of them, just that I think there's at least a measurable amount of people that think that way."
193,"The CDC's science, if you read their website, actually suggests for the continued use of masks and social distancing."
194,Most epidemiologists believe masking would be necessary into the next year.
195,This declaration runs counter to that.
196,"You’re making a pretty broad, sweeping statement there."
197,"In actuality, it depends on where you live."
198,"Here in the PNW, mask mandates have been heavily enforced at most businesses."
199,This goes for Walmart and Target.
200,I have seen it several times at both stores.
201,This is what I am worried about.
202,"I don’t want to carry it to my niece or nephew while working there because Target doesn’t require proof of vaccination so nobody has a mask, and the ones that did have a mask today have children at home or interact in someway with kids."
203,I know at least half of the store I work at isn’t vaccinated and they say it’s “injecting you with poison...” including much of management where I am at.
204,My understanding is that they can ask for proof without being against HIPAA and are already having people show the vaccination cards for a couple hours of pay anyways.
205,I don’t know why it wouldn’t be able to be enforced more.
206,"Im watching ""the good place""... Wow how they rib on Arizona but nothing compares to how they just roast Florida at every turn"

234,Biden did?
235,Wasn’t much of this infrastructure in place well before he was in office?
236,"Oh yeah, ideally everyone would have made plans from as soon as they were eligible."
237,I checked for updates damn near every day for months on the vaccine front.
238,Unfortunately not everyone was as tuned in or looking out for it.
239,"With more public access to the vaccine than say a month ago, I think it's only a matter of time before it crosses over in social circles to those who aren't necessarily against it but uninformed of availability."
240,I'm willing to give them a little leeway for the next month as most people get squared away.
241,"Not everyone can just drop everything and get it done as a priority, it's only fair to give them some time."
242,"After mid-June, however, it's on them if they didn't get it done."
243,A month is more than long enough to find a time that works for them.
244,&gt; People who claim this move is “following the science” need to sit down.
245,Masks are almost as effective at preventing disease as the vaccines and require little investment / inconvenience.
246,No they absolutely are not.
247,"The science shows that you are almost certain to contract COVID if you sit in a room with someone who has COVID, even if you are both wearing masks."
248,The vaccine is far more effective than masks.

283,"currently there’s a 1 in 10 chance that each maskless person I come in could spread it to me, at minimum."

285,hanging Outside distanced with friends is still much safer then indoor dinners.
286,Is it pronounced Target or Target?
287,"Okay, but under what conditions and over what timeframe?"
288,If I only left the house a few times a month and be indoors for maybe a few hours at most that would be great.
289,"But I have to go into work every day, for a full +8 hour shift, with a bunch of people who don't want to take Covid seriously."

329,"as you pointed out, “safe“ is a relative term."
330,but I think there’s a a lot of room between the mythical %100 and the 35% fully vaccinated we’re at now.
331,I don't blame him.
332,Not until we know for sure if the vaccine stops long-haul effects.

338,&gt;‘We’ve reached two important conclusions.
339,"Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases the risk of CVT, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes."
340,"Secondly, the COVID-19 risk is higher than we see with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination.’

341,Fucking.
342,Morons.
343,Thanks for the links
344,People made it political.
345,Judgmental people found low hanging fruit to make fun of those not on their chosen side.
346,"People dug in, you are seeing that in the fact that some people are hanging on to the masks as virulently as some refused them."
347,"Best Buy also said the same thing, just depending on state laws"
348,"This isn't fact, but I've asked a similar question and heard ""September at the earliest"" as an answer."
349,So how do you know that a vaccinated person can’t pass COVID along to an unvaccinated person?
350,Only 142 days until all of China is vaccinated at that rate.
351,"DAMN, China has too many people."
352,[removed]
353,Less dangerous by what metric?
354,were still learning about new and “fun” ways covid-19 and it’s variants can wreck different bodily systems.
355,Death is just one of many problems this virus can cause Long term effects are still a huge question mark.
356,honestly this attitude concerns me.
357,People should switch up theyre day to day when they get sick.
358,proper hygiene and distancing could help us lower or eradicate the flu.
359,id argue this should be a great example of how small little changes when you’re sick  can help the community at large.
360,"next time you start getting sniffles, mask up at the store, opt to order in instead of sneezing around a restaurant."
361,"by all means, live your life, but remember that just because your cold doesn’t seem that bad to you, the guy in front of you at the deli may have a newborn at home or a beloved grandma that you could help prevent from dying."
362,I feel this anti mask push may have pushed the finish line further away
363,"To be fair, ""compliance"" no longer means wearing a mask at Target."
364,So people not wearing masks are not breaking any rules.
365,"Welp, that's dumb."
366,"Also, kids aren't good at wearing masks, or hygiene."
367,I will... it helps prevent my asthma and allergies.
368,"36 year old here, I have a near phobia of needles."
369,I have not once voluntarily gotten a flu shot.
370,I told the nurse for both covid shots I'mjust gonna stare off into space because if I see the needle I will instinctively pull away.
371,"Neither shot was actually a big deal, an ant bite literally hurts more."
372,"Functional, normal societies in other parts of the world have been using masks for a very long time."
373,"Hell, We’re we’re going to the Southern US a couple years back and our Doctor recommended getting the Hep B shot, so I did."
374,And I get the flu shot every year.
375,This Virus (or the next) will take care of the antiVaxxers.
376,I agree but this is simply not happening as the conservatives are choosing to make this a personal freedoms issue.
377,Employeers can require anything they want
378,What a bunch of pricks.
379,"At least for me in healthcare, I have to provide proof of a whole bunch of vaccines."
380,I would not be surprised if covid is added to this list.
381,"Nope, just living in the real world, not one where everything is distorted by anti-America propaganda."

388,"If she's a reasonable person that believes in science, then ask her specifically what she's concerned about, and honestly answer her questions one by one."
389,That means acknowledging some risks but doing the math to prove why the benefits outweigh the risks.
390,If you just tell her there's absolutely nothing to worry about (i.e.
391,"0% risk), it's disingenuous and she'll feel like you're just pushing an agenda rather than having a meaningful, scientific discussion."

395,Then if you have kids you should continue to wear a mask.
396,He’s been my moms go to source for information this entire time.
397,"She always says “my good friend, Scott” when she’s sharing his insight because she listens to him so much."
398,Have you thought about emancipation?
399,Surely you have legal grounds on child endangerment and neglect.
400,I work with six young people.
401,All of them got vaxxed as soon as they were eligible.
402,I only hope they can convince their peers and parents to do the same.

405,If you think we should only relax a restriction if it's good for public health then you should think they should be closed.
406,"There's a point where the benefits outweigh the risks, and at this point only the unvaccinated are at risks from other unvaccinated who don't care."
407,are they AZ or JnJ
408,"It's not surprising they are positive, but if they are sick enough to go to the ER that is surprising."
409,Just plain sociopathy on the part of executives.
410,"I'm sure they've had it explained to them that *not* letting people stay home when sick means everyone else in the office gets sick, too, but they mostly just don't care."
411,"In my experience, those types care a lot more about looking strong than about anyone's health."
412,I actually had a worse reaction to the first dose than the second.
413,I hear for most people it's the opposite.
414,Anybody else?
415,Someone commented in another thread that “the average American adult doesn’t come in contact with kids that often.
416,"I went out frequently last month and didn’t really interact with any children.”

I guess kids just uh, raise themselves in his mind?"
417,"Nope, still healing."

451,"For example, I don't think he's the only one who accurately called that the March/April ""fourth wave"" wouldn't really happen (I recall Sanjay Gupta saying that too), but he was definitely the only prominent voice who thought that avoiding another wave would put us in a position to largely move back to normalcy by the late spring/early summer due to surplus vaccine availability."

457,Ask them to consider the source of any anti-vax skepticism
458,"There are millions of kids who can’t be vaccinated yet, though."
459,It is going to be weird to see children still forced to wear masks all day in school and daycare while the rest of the adult population moves on.

471,"I haven't seen my son in Victoria since November, so I'm really hoping this is the case."
472,"Like I said before, science, you know people who are educated, trained and spend all day doing this as their job are telling us that young children, even asymptomatic are not transferring the virus to other children."
473,Schools need to open as science is telling us it is safe.
474,"I will follow what educated, trained people say."
475,I will not follow those that only live in fear.

486,A year plus into this pandemic and I’ll just be glad when it’s over.
487,The constant fear coming from the press about this virus specifically just gets old and it’s so negative for the most part.
488,"It’s not a challenge for me to wear a mask, but you don’t have the same interactions with people obviously when wearing it."
489,I feel like more of a robot than a human when wearing it and I only say that because you almost lose a part of your individuality or what makes you unique and who you are.
490,You don’t get to see people smile or anything - you just see a mask and everyone is afraid of other people.

498,Talk about really confusing the message and with very speculative data.
499,canada is like america but without the stupid
500,People who don’t get vaccinated are still stealing from the rest and we should be looking at ways to penalize them accordingly.
501,Risk is exponentially lower when more people around you are vaccinated.
502,"Most drunk drivers make it home without incident, and even those that crash rarely hurt others… statistically speaking."
503,Much more likely to drive off the road or into a tree/barrier than another vehicle.
504,But we still fine the crap out of anyone who drives drunk.
505,And for good reason.
506,"Yeah, basically Cali."
507,The spread makes it more difficult though.
508,Why?
509,They are no more threat than a vaccinated person.
510,The vaccine does not stop contraction or transmitting of the virus.
511,It is astounding how many people.seem to think their vaccine will not work if some one else is not vaccinated.
512,That's not how vaccine work
513,This was so wholesome.
514,Why?
515,"I was fully vaccinated back in early February so I’m all for vaccinations, but you are no longer at risk."
516,Why do you care if they are vaccinated as well?
517,"Yea, there's no way Canada doesn't pass this week."
518,"We've booked up dates for first shot vaccinations solid for the next 3-4 weeks at least, with more vaccine expected to arrive than has already been arriving."
519,The US doesn't even have any waiting lists anymore.
520,"I really wish this myth of, ""China kept it under wraps"" would die."
521,"A group of local politicians in Wuhan thought it would hurt their political fortunes (they were worried about being fired, as they were in a non-Xi CCP faction) if it came out that there was a novel disease spreading."
522,There was also some major event going on in Wuhan too.
523,"It was covered up for a few days by these people, the truth came out, and the central government did try to keep it under control (and fired the people who hid it)."
524,"Then you have people trying to pretend that China lied about the severity, even though that wasn't at all the case."

550,"""works"" and ""have the same effectiveness"" are not the same thing, I really hope you realize that."
551,"The new variants have been shown to be at least somewhat resistant to the vaccine antibodies, and that may just mean a small change in infection rates, but it could just as easily be another full wave (including vaccinated people)

560,Friend was finally able to track down a pharmacy that had it in stock and available slots.

562,"Another friend just got her second shot, hers was through a workplace."
563,"No, it just means your not a virtue signalling jack ass who wants to pretend they are an ""hero""."
564,Or alternatively someone at low risk who sees no reason to take it when it doesnt prevent contracting or transmitting the virus.
565,The big thing for me is that we don’t know how bad Covid impacts people long term.
566,We know a lot of people get “long Covid” and it sounds pretty awful.
567,What we do know is that every other vaccine out there is symptom-free after two months.
568,"Millions of people have gotten vaccine shots and there have been no reported long term symptoms other than the J&amp;J blood clot issue, which is extremely rare."
569,Too many people have gotten shots for a big cover up.
570,Covid is almost certainly worse than a vaccine shot long term.

588,There’s no excuse to be uninformed about it
589,I visited many states for past year.
590,"(CA, NV, NM, FL,NJ, NY, MA, NC, SC, PA, GA, VA, WV) California was most compliant."
591,I'd be out hiking in middle of woods and come across person in a mask.
592,Florida was by far the least.
593,Like very noticably non compliant.
594,"People would pull the ""walk in with mask and rip it off once you're past the front door.'"
595,It's similar to people who hold seat belt over their chest when passing a cop.
596,I saw lots of mask rear view mirror ornament types.
597,Some people will be scared forever.
598,It’s bizarre to me.
599,It’s like someone getting their yellow fever shot and traveling to South America and then being afraid to leave the house without being covered head to toe in a hermetically sealed mosquito proof suit.
600,The vaccine works.
601,It does its job.
602,Whether anyone else has had it isn’t really an issue to you anymore.
603,At least one person being honest around here.
604,Let’s not pretend Canadians don’t do that shit.
605,Annoying as hell as it just slows down our own progression.
606,The dumb ass as the one insulting someone for choosing not to take a vaccine that is still in trials that doesn't stop contracting or transmitting the target virus.
607,Especially when the target virus is not particularly dangerous to non high risk people.
608,Time to work on your forgery skills.
609,Or do bold non-cursive signature and if they mention something say he was really proud of being able to do that after his stroke with a smile on your face.
610,"Also, pick a relative you remember your parents having a fight with about their bullshit and have them pretend to be your parent for the day (a woman would be easier if there's a last name mismatch)"
611,It depends on the state and specific rules.
612,My workplace does not require proof of vaccinations.
613,But they reserve the right to ask for proof if there’s an outbreak and you can be fired if it turns out you were not vaccinated
614,Check out niniandthebrain on Instagram.
615,Lots of great posts on all these topics I believe.
616,The kids are under less risk today than they have been at any point so far.
617,Their parents are vaccinated.
618,Their older siblings are getting vaccinated.
619,The potential vectors into their lives are actually shrinking rapidly.
620,This isn't conjecture.
621,This is my life.
622,This is my family and my friends.
623,We are in good shape and generally fucking elated.
624,Yeah my kids are still wearing masks.
625,But they are fine.
626,Shit it's summer they don't even have school for a few months.
627,"Trust me when I say I have not forgotten the kids, they are my kids and my top priority."

633,"And if enough people are vaccinated, the odds reduce dramatically."
634,That threshold is herd immunity.
635,"Every vaccination program has herd immunity as a goal, not as a suggestion."
636,"Fantastic read, thank you"
637,Some of them follow a stereotype.
638,Others that actually look a little nervous like newborn lambs I think are vaxxed and thinking that other people think they aren't vaxed.
639,"Vaxed or no, I'll keep my mask on cause I don't have to smile anymore."
640,"Back in the days when it was cool to engage in atheism debates, I heard a lot of people say that when people don't believe in religion, they take something else and turn it into religion."
641,I always thought that was a pile of BS.
642,I'm increasingly coming to believe that they were right.
643,This fucking sucks.
644,What the CDC said is that *vaccinated people* don’t need masks.
645,They recommend that unvaccinated people continue to mask and socially distance.
646,"The problem is that if all us vaccinated people can ditch the masks, then it becomes impossible to police who’s vaccinated or not at Target or Walmart, so it’s going to turn into a personal responsibility free for all pretty much overnight."
647,Oof the real burn
648,I won’t to travel to any place that requires a test on arrival even though I’m vaccinated.
649,What if I test positive when I land?
650,"As we’ve seen with the Yankees, it’s possible to be fully vaxxed and test positive and be asymptomatic."
651,"I just spent countless hours on a plane, and hundreds or thousands of dollars, to be stuck in a hotel for 14 days?"
652,No thank you.
653,Places need to let up on testing requirements for fully vaxxed people if they want tourists to return.
654,&gt; NZ has done well.
655,"Sure, I'm not saying massive testing is wrong."
656,It's just very costly and isn't fool-proof against community spread.
657,"What TW is going through today is no different from NZ in August, October, early this year, etc."
658,etc.
659,That's all I'm saying.
660,"No, this is very different to all those small outbreaks in NZ."
661,The peak daily case load in the August cluster was 13 and very quickly fell off to 2 to 4 cases a day.
662,The only other outbreak of a community cluster in NZ was the February one and that never had more than 4 cases in a single day and was limited to 3 families in the end.
663,Taiwan has just had more cases in a single day than the entire August and February outbreaks combined in NZ.
664,"That means it has been spreading silently within Taiwan for a lengthy period of time, probably several weeks."
665,Regular surveillance testing as we do in NZ would have caught it earlier.
666,They will really struggle to shut this down now.
667,Melbourne took months of severe lockdown to get hundreds of cases a day down to zero.
668,"Yup, if you are vaccinated, you have effectively done more work in the hour it took to get both shot than you did all year at reducing spread."
669,Wyoming could sure use this.
670,Only 25 ish % of the state is vaccinated and barely anyone shows up to clinics now.
671,Know a lot of people who would suddenly feel a lot less skeptical if there was a chance to win some money...
672,As much as we all criticize the CDC - some for being too cautious and some for being confusing and contradictory - they are really in a hard place.
673,Their guidance has continually lagged behind the science.
674,"Also, look at their guidance for cruise ship passengers that drew widespread outrage 

I don’t envy being them right now."
675,Half of the country wants to go back to normal right now and the other half thinks it’s too soon.
676,They literally can’t win no matter what
677,I always tired of people saying it's not a big deal.
678,"I'm glad it isn't for them, but I would walk away from every shopping trip with my facial hair just drenched from my breath and Florida humidity."
679,I'd run to my car afterward because I was desperate to wipe my face down with a paper towel.
680,"Like you, I didn't complain much when it was required because we *had* to and there's no point in whining."
681,But now?
682,"Hell no, wearing one has been miserable."
683,[removed]
684,Do you shoot guns in the air from your backyard?
685,"Sure, but vaccines are most effective when  enough of the population is vaccinated."
686,"Being vaccinated in of itself does help an individual, but when several people are vaccinated it reduces the likelihood of exposure."
687,The goal of any vaccination program is to maximize the total vaccinated population so that the virus has a much more difficult time spreading.
688,This is called Herd Immunity.

769,:)
770,"Mutations become more transmisible, don’t they also get less deadly?"
771,I doubt we will ever find out the details of how this started.
772,"This is important: as it's summer it will circulate slower for a few months, which means more natural immunity (and more vaccine-induced immunity as well: some people will get their shots during the summer) when autumn will come."
773,Exams are practically finished so they may as well wait until Autumn semester
774,"It's all about mortality rates, over 40's have a 10 times higher mortality rate than a 20 year old based on UK data so far."
775,So it makes more sense to vaccinate the 40 year olds over those in their twenties.

796,One day...
797,This is awesome.
798,"They should adopt this elsewhere too, especially in states with low vaccination rates."
799,That doesn't add up with released numbers of hitting 200 million with first doses at the end of april out of a population of 330 million.
800,Would not trust that site to have accurate data.
801,"The key answer to that question is right here: 

&gt;She said Taiwan had been “stupid” in focusing testing on people who presented with symptoms and also had a travel history or connection to a confirmed case, rather than one or the other."
802,"As of Monday, rapid testing was only established in Wanhua, meaning there were potentially many more cases undetected."
803,It's also shocking they have refused to call a snap lockdown.
804,Snap lockdowns and rapid mass testing has proven extremely effective at stopping outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand many times now.
805,Taiwan is going to quickly lose that gold standard reputation if they don't act quickly.
806,I'm pretty sure the CDC did factor in stuff like dishonesty and projected trends before making the announcement.

809,"Next you'll say Gossip Girl has a trademark on ""I love you"" 😆"
810,I am okay with loose vaccination requirements..  ‘not checked’ and just open.
811,People will be incentivized by the fact that they are not vaccinated around all the other people not vaccinated and unmasked ‘lying’ about being vaccinated.
812,Sort of solves itself.
813,My sis didn't want it but told me a few days ago she has an appointment scheduled.
814,"NJ's vaccinations are on par with NY's, I'm pretty sure, and NY did relax their guidelines."
815,That is literally 100% false.
816,It's clear you have no idea how extremely contagious diseases work.
817,"Which is whatever, but then keep that it's-not-that-bad bs in your head."
818,I’m always amazed by the power of the placebo effect.
819,I wish we could use that in all disease.
820,"Not sure that’s what is happening here , but it’s great that so many people are feeling better."
821,I’ve heard theories of the vaccine “resetting” an overactive immune system in these cases of long covid.
822,"Exactly my line of thinking too, and it could lead to some pretty dark places."
823,"I gotta buddy who blames the older generations for what happened in ‘08, and he’s now fuming because his school wouldn’t let him back onto campus."
824,"His resentment has really grown during this, becoming borderline agism."
825,"I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more fringe people with that mentality, too."
826,That's the plan.
827,Same in most EU countries.
828,It seems like natural immunity works well: don't want the vaccine?
829,"You're free to choose natural immunity, enjoy the ride!"
830,"That way it'll be possible to get back to ""normal"" quickly, and as long as hospital saturation isn't a problem immunity will slowly progress among the whole population, even though there will be some death that could have been avoided."
831,You are correct.
832,It's very likely that people had asymptomatic infections where the peak viral loads never reached levels enough for transmission.
833,On the other hand if you have sterilizing immunity you are not supposed to have any viral replication and you have no antibody bump.
834,It opened to over 35's (by July 1st 2021) this morning in fact.
835,It's good you pushed to get a number but I agree that the number is insanely high.
836,Does he have trypanophobia or something?
837,Honestly they should do that in all countries
838,I think it is better to have half the 40 year olds and half the 20 year olds vaccinated instead of all 40 year olds and not a single 20 year old.
839,Many people have their most contacts with similarly aged people.
840,"After the highest risk group (&gt;60yo) is done to prevent deaths, a widespread distribution will be most effective in keeping cases down."
841,Sounds like a placebo effect to me
842,[removed]
843,"In my area, the downward trends in COVId numbers right now are nearly identical to the same time last year."
844,I have a concern about the numbers tracking back up again in another wave in September too.
845,That’s cruel to your children.
846,Might as well not let them ever ride in a car too because they’re more likely to die in a wreck than actually from COVID.
847,"Same, almost my entire social circle here is already vaccinated."
848,"Maybe if you're 80+ years old, are unvaccinated, have multiple comorbidities, and also have other risk factors like obesity."
849,[removed]
850,We already know it didn't come from the wet market.
851,That was just the first superspreader event.
852,But I agree that further investigations are needed (and are ongoing) to prevent the next pandemic.
853,[removed]
854,"My loved ones are vaccinated the people who I know that are refusing are adult age, they get what they get."
855,Only victims in this are hospital staff and people who can’t get the shot for some reason.
856,I’m over trying to live in a society of insufferable dickheads.
857,"The UK has a limited vaccine supply, so I'm okay with the age approach for healthy individuals, currently over 38s can get vaccinated."
858,Should be open to 35s later this week.
859,I had a mild case of agoraphobia due to the extended quarantine.
860,Too me a couple of days around people but that phase is over.
861,&gt; The events that are about to unfold are going to be a deeper level of hell than humanity has ever experienced.
862,"Yeah, I'm sure the plague wiping out a 1/3 of the human population was nothing in comparison...."
863,"

&gt;The Al Remal clinic and the administrative building of the ministry were also partially destroyed, Gaza Health Ministry said."
864,&gt;Al Remal clinic was Gaza's only Covid-19 laboratory.
865,Which is about 20# of adults in the US.
866,Why is that no matter the poll or survey there seems to always be that 20% that has to pick the contrarian answer.
867,That’s the key part to this equation.
868,There’s an election sometime between now and may and the current government is narrowly behind (51-49 in the latest 2PP polling.)
869,They’re on record for formally mucking up the vaccine rollout so they are desperate to keep cases so and not miss anymore targets.
870,"So much so, they refuse to actually set any targets."
871,Can’t miss a vaccine target or reopening deadline if you don’t set one.
872,I feel like after a certain someone got voted out the amount of anti-maskers has dropped significantly in OC.
873,Now I only have to deal with maybe 1 or 2 of them a week and they aren't particularly problematic.
874,What about all of the unvaccinated kids out there?
875,Bad air quality is the cause of so many issues.
876,I am surprised that building codes don't enforce both HEPA and activated carbon filtration as well as humidity control.

882,Simply following your logic.
883,"Correct me if I am wrong but you seem concerned about people not getting the vaccine and placing a burden on health insurance and tax payers 

People should be free to make their own decisions regarding their health and safety in my opinion."
884,Have you previously worried about the financial burden of those who refuse the flu vaccine each year?
885,Who cares?

927,"&gt;two-thirds of new cases are in people who are not yet fully vaccinated and around 80% of people requiring hospital treatment for COVID-19 have not been vaccinated and or had co-morbidities

That's ""fully vaccinated"" and not just those who've had their first dose; and it seems to be more effective against hospitalizations, although I don't like the idea of including co-morbidities as a criterion when we're talking about vaccine effectiveness; co-morbidities come with age, and age is the major driver of severe symptoms and hospitalization."
928,"That said, I agree that the vaccine is effective and a year ago we'd have praised this outcome."

968,Yeah that’s the same for France except that I am legally speaking a German resident.
969,My work went fully remote so I decided to move in with my family to support them and be at home during all the lockdowns instead of alone in my tiny flat in Germany.
970,So I’ve been here 9 months but still legally registered in Germany.
971,I could go back to Germany to get vaccinated when it opens but I’d also like to stay here for another few months.
972,Maybe I’ll just have to travel to Germany to get the vaccine then come back.

989,"Literally the first sentence was 

&gt;Three-quarters of people between 18-29 say vaccination should be required to return to campus or work, according to new Generation Lab/Axios polling, and 37% would refuse to come back unless those conditions are in place."

994,"Something minor - new way to describe something that if unchecked kills 0,5% of the population."
995,"For 9/11, sure."
996,Then they get sick and remove themselves from the equation.
997,"Sooooo, you get  the vaccine and stop trying to police other peoples stupidity."
998,"That very well may be the case, but, I'd be curious to see if the data would be skewed, because a certain percentage of people who had already been ill with Covid likely would take it much more seriously than before and so would mask up, social distance more than ever, where they previously may have thought the disease a liberal hoax or nothing more than a cold or flu."
999,"Ohio actually did this a couple months back, once J&amp;J became more widely available - sent it into the colleges here to allow the students the chance to get quickly vaccinated with the one-and-done without having to search for it."
1000,"Ohio’s hardly perfect, but (most of) its COVID response and vaccine rollout has made me feel lucky to live here during global pandemic."
1001,I hope nobody wins

1012,Vaccination rates are plateauing everywhere and it's all about chipping away at the unvaccinated numbers.
1013,It's all about carrots at this point.
1014,Same reason private businesses can’t fire when discrimination.

1037,This Ohioan likes her odds...
1038,&gt; Against my religion to get vaccinated.

1048,Full text: The European Union's drugs regulator has said the Pfizer Covid vaccine can now be stored at fridge temperature for much longer than it previously recommended.
1049,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that once the vaccines thawed, unopened vials could be kept in the fridge for up to a month."
1050,The current limit is just five days.
1051,The increased flexibility is expected to have a significant impact on the vaccine roll-out across the EU.
1052,The need for transport and storage at very low temperatures has been one of the major disadvantages of the Pfizer jab.
1053,The previous storage requirements for Pfizer vaccines have made them harder to use in some parts of the world.
1054,"In February, the United States approved storage and transport of the Pfizer vaccine at standard freezer temperatures of -15 to -25C for up to two weeks, as opposed to between -80 to -60C that it usually requires."
1055,"Earlier this month Canada authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children between the ages of 12 and 15, becoming the first country to do so for that age group."
1056,name a better news broadcast.
1057,Goeorgia have been opened for a month and a half and does not have any spikes in COVID.
1058,I have been vaccine hesitant back before the internet was even a thing.
1059,"I have had some severe reactions to pharmaceuticals myself, and then, one year I went to work at a large hospital where my mom &amp; brother worked, as well."
1060,"In my employee intake, we had to do titer tests to ensure we had MMR immunity."
1061,"Turned out that all 3 of us, my mom, my brother &amp; I, had no antibodies."
1062,We all had to be re-vaccinated.
1063,"Again, the antibodies didn’t develop."
1064,"So, when it came time to vaccinate my own children, I decided to wait until they started 1st grade."
1065,"I just figured that it could be something genetic, and so why rush to inject them before school."
1066,I will probably be down voted for this.
1067,It’s just my own experience.
1068,I just worry.
1069,I understand that vaccines and modern medicine is a miracle.
1070,"My hesitation has nothing to do with crazy youtube videos, essential oils, or anything like that."
1071,It’s 100% my past experiences with side effects that worry me.
1072,"That being said, I am about 70% convinced about getting the covid shot."
1073,It just shows how a lot of people in our country don’t care about others.
1074,"Hell, people hoarded gas from each other because they thought the pipeline would never come back online."
1075,"All and all, Americans are some really selfish assholes."
1076,&gt; Currently studying kids 12-15.
1077,"Nothing on under 12 yet in testing, nothing under 15 for open vaccines."
1078,This is not true if you're in the U.S.
1079,Kids 12+ can get Pfizer.
1080,"They're currently running clinical trials for I believe 2-11 years of age, and Moderna is right behind them."
1081,"Pfizer expects to seek approval for the 2-11 ages in September, but I hope they can move that forward to July so they can cover all the kids starting school in August."
1082,"&gt;When California stripper Brittney, 26, walked into San Francisco’s reopened Gold Club stripping venue again in April after a year, she was confronted with masked-up dancers and just a clutch of patrons."
1083,"Brittney, who drives to San Francisco to work from her home in Sacramento, some two hours away, is not sure it even makes financial sense for her to strip in California anymore."
1084,"Savannah Rain, a 23-year-old stripper, went on paid dates with “sugar daddy” clients and stripped online through Only Fans over the past year, but still ended up draining her savings."
1085,Maybe the second dose activates the hotspot
1086,&gt; They just don’t like the idea of taking a vaccine that hasn’t had years of data to show all possible side effects.
1087,"&gt; 
&gt; It’s not that they are refusing because they’ve been misinformed

Pretty sure it's both, at least with everyone i know in this group."
1088,So do adults
1089,There is no overblowing Covid and you do not know what is going on with people - you can determine your own life but not others.
1090,AndI was trying to stay on topic to what this guy was saying about masks.
1091,It is a problem to have no masks when employees have not all been or cannot get vaccinated yet.
1092,I will continue to wear mine.
1093,"Be well, thanks."
1094,So you a pick and choose science guy.
1095,To be honest I used the CDC for you as it is in English.
1096,I go by the The Robert Koch Institute https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html which is in German.
1097,But even the CDC numbers shows that of all cases only 10% have been children in the USA.
1098,In Germany our schools have been open all year and we have had very little spread in schools.
1099,"But screw those numeric facts as you were an engineer, your observation hold more water."
1100,I have not interpreted the data myself.
1101,These are the straight numbers that are out there.
1102,The numbers of children spreading this virus is low.
1103,These a straight up facts.
1104,But you don't believe in facts which is clear.
1105,But your mind has been made up as you only want to believe what you feel is right.
1106,"Sorry, when I see people choose data to believe in with no factual bases, as you have provided none."
1107,You're no better than an anti-vaxer to me.
1108,How about we leave science to scientist.
1109,No the fuck they don’t.
1110,"Fuck lying should be illegal
In media"
1111,The science didn't change.
1112,"The Biden administration had an historically bad week and they needed to put one in the W column so they trotted the CDC out to relax their recommendations that they probably could have relaxed around the time TX, FL and other states ended their mask mandates."
1113,Yeah I'm sick of all that bullshit fear mongering.
1114,"That's why I never wear a seatbelt, and will never buy into the smoke-detector propaganda."
1115,That shits for pussies.
1116,Same thing with life jackets on my boat.
1117,"It's all nothing but nickel and diming me to death, selling things to the fearful."
1118,"The only thing to fear is fear itself, nobody actually dies in fires, drowning, car accidents, etc."
1119,And it’ll for sure catch the slackasses.
1120,"Dropping the mask mandate seems to have gotten their attention, but money will probably work even better."

1232,This is the equivalent of what you're asking.
1233,They can weaken the side effects.
1234,You’ve never ever heard of them tweaking the formula of a vaccine?
1235,They can reduce the number of spike proteins in the vaccine.
1236,They can change the required shots from 2 to 3 to make each vaccine dose more watered down and have less side effects while the overall dose is the same.
1237,Moderna has only tested the 2 dose version with the same concentration they’ve had since day 1.
1238,Same with Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson.

1250,"⁠Considering what we know about COVID, it makes no sense that this was around for months  which no death."

1252,⁠They used a home made “proprietary” antibody test.
1253,"These are tricky at the best of times, but they provide no evidence or validation for their test besides another article that they wrote that is also pending publication and not peer reviewed..."
1254,The chance that this is a false positive is huge.
1255,They should have at MINIMUM done a negative control with some serum from 2018 to be sure.
1256,They did not.
1257,4.
1258,⁠The proportion of IgG and IgM is wrong.
1259,We would expect that the total amount of positives would be balanced between IgG and IgM or have more IgG (it stays around longer).
1260,That is not the case.
1261,Something like 85% of their positives are IgM.
1262,"IgM tests are finicky at the best of times and are notorious for giving false positives, especially at low levels."
1263,"Since they didn’t note the antibody titer, I can’t check."
1264,5.

1267,of their “positive” tests came back positive.
1268,This is a joke.

&gt; A study published by researchers at the University of Chile on 6 April,  
 in which Cortés was not involved, found that the CoronaVac vaccine was   
**56.5% effective in preventing infections two weeks after a second dose**   
but only 3% effective after a single dose."

1286,Germany is doing almost that daily—with obviously a bigger population.

1288,Well because that's a stupid response.
1289,"There is no microchip in the vaccine so coming back with ""hurr Durr your phone is the same thing"" is just telling stupid people that there is a chip in the vaccine."
1290,"Then, besides that, surely you understand the difference between a cell phone not attached to your body and a physically implanted object."
1291,That's such a stupid response.

1336,This is the only place I have seen with NH being 85% of adults getting first shot (i live in NH).
1337,I could have sworn that the US was over 50% of adults with first shot as well.
1338,Just ask your neighbors how they feel about the mask ending.
1339,You might be surprised which neighbors are ready to de-mask.
1340,"I have a neighbor who has special needs and walks a lot of the neighborhood dogs for free, and was diligent about wearing a mask and staying away from people while out for walks."
1341,She thought the dogs could get covid.

1361,"I personally believe it's a defence mechanism for the monopoly on information the West has on the internet, that's why China creates alternative platforms and are slowly integrating foreign netizens into its sphere to create rival platforms to YouTube or Facebook (just my speculation)."
1362,"You can do a quick Google search to see that protests happen a lot in China and they aren't (usually) violently quashed like in the past, Chinese authorities have gotten a lot of experience and know the consequence of harsh actions."

1390,We will potentially see minor spikes but the death rate will remain flat.
1391,"Locally (Memphis, TN) we have nearly 70% vaccination rates for ages 65+, which represent 75% of deaths."
1392,25% of our county population is under 18 and there have been 0 deaths.

1."

2."
1439,"Consistently low burden of disease: Hospitalizations are stable and low, and specifically, hospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals are low.”

1."

1442,If you want to make an appointment I’m sure you can find one a few miles away within the next week.
1443,2.
1444,Not clear.
1445,For “hospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals are low.” I believe this is true.
1446,“Hospitalizations are stable and low” - this one doesn’t specify a threshold so it’s not clear if we are there.
1447,When Newson announced June 15th and several times since then (even last Thursday) he mentioned it was “by June 15th” keeping the door open to shift it sooner.
1448,However now they attached the mask mandate to the date.
1449,I imagine it will be really hard to move the date in now.
1450,The seat belt is a great analogy - you’re required to wear one because if you don’t in a major crash your shitty unsecured body becomes a projectile that can harm others as well as greatly increasing your own risk of death.

1452,"Now that the CDC guidelines have changed, I figured i’d still wear it."

1502,"So I went digging to try and find the article I had read and associated scientific papers, but was unsuccessful."
1503,"However, Overall it seems that many kids that had symptoms have long term effects lasting up to 8 months."
1504,"Edit: So yes it seems evidence points to ""I was talking out of my ass"" so good on you for asking for sources."
1505,But I did find some interesting tidbits in the process that are worrying nonetheless.
1506,Infants and fetuses seemed to be at a higher risk of developing issues as their cardiovascular system is still developing and can be vulnerable to covid.
1507,I found that 2-6% of kids had multisystem inflammatory syndrome requiring intensive care.
1508,"It apparently doesn't kill them, but it's bad news."
1509,"The worst outcomes seemed to be reserved for kids that have existing cardiovascular issues, known or unknown."

1511,"Even my son, who seems perfectly healthy at the moment, had a cardiac anomaly when he was very young."
1512,"As for long term effects of exposure to the virus, I couldn't find much, probably because it's still too early."
1513,"It does have me worried though, not knowing if there are long term risks from exposure to the virus."
1514,I think it's best to play it as safe as possible and not assume that just because it generally doesn't kill children that it's completely safe for them to come in contact with the virus.
1515,"There is a small but noticeable percentage of kids that have existing conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus, and some of these kids might now know they have these conditions if they are mild enough or undiagnosed."
1516,"Since asymptomatic kids can absolutely spread the disease like crazy, it puts those other kids at great risk."
1517,"But that takes some empathy and understanding that ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" which seems to be sorely lacking in the US today."
1518,"People seem to assume that it's similar to other diseases like the flu, BUT IT ISN'T."
1519,It's a novel thing and we don't know what to expect long term.
1520,"People jump from ""It doesn't kill children"" to ""It's totally safe for kids to get it"" rather easily."
1521,"The safest thing to do is to make sure as *few people contract it as possible*, but large chunks of the US population are too fucking stupid and short sighted to understand that."

1570,"Yeah, you right."
1571,I remember hearing all of that.
1572,Probably going to be a hell of a lot harder to convince people to get another vaccine.
1573,But they're fine putting gasoline in plastic bags.
1574,Did you get your antibodies tested?
1575,I could dive into the study behind what you linked.
1576,"I can talk about how it relies on people using an ""app"" which necessarily skews towards people with symptoms

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1.full/
&gt; Here we report a prospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 symptoms in a subset of 4182 users of the COVID Symptom Study app

That the raw numbers suggest much lower counts

&gt; Almost 500,000 UK children have tested positive for covid-19 since March 2020."
1577,&gt; UK advocacy group Long Covid Kids says that it currently has details of 1200 children with long covid from 890 families in England.
1578,"And point out that a mild symptom persisting for a few weeks isn't unusual or significant

&gt; Most medical bodies say it normally takes a few days or weeks to recover from covid-19, and that most will make a full recovery within 12 weeks."
1579,But I won't.
1580,Because I'm not a scientist and neither are you.
1581,We are not experts.
1582,The CDC is full of them.
1583,"Go be Superman, you Americans are truly the reflection of your own government, just the need of policing and taking care of everything, to the point of self harm"

1587,Yup.

1605,We won’t know the reality for a little while.
1606,I agree.
1607,There are so many experts who over inflate risks to get clicks and air time or scare people into compliance.
1608,Scott has told us bad news when there's bad news and good news when there's good news.
1609,"If I see his name in the headlines, I click every time because he seems to be able to sort through the static."
1610,"That's already happening in some parts of the US, ones with high vaccination rates."
1611,Treating COVID like a zero-sum issue is partly why the CDC guidance is inefficient.
1612,A few weeks ago?
1613,Wow you read the story before it was even published
1614,"Our ""fully vaccinated"" population will skyrocket in two months, people under 30 have only been eligible in some states for a month or so, people under 16 just got eligibility."
1615,"Plus, we will likely get full authorization for Pfizer at least (instead of just Emergency Use) so we can start requiring it for public schools or health care workplaces etc."
1616,"But 85% of Americans is impossible without expanding the eligibility...~15% of Americans are ineligible by being under 12 years old, and plenty of people just refuse to get it."
1617,"To add to this, herd immunity does not necessarily mean any given percentage, it means “high enough that the virus cannot spread easily”."
1618,Nobody really knows when herd immunity will happen because it all depends on the distribution of the immune and non-immune.
1619,Just remember it's all because Trump placed an amazon order and named a group of politicians who were scared of masks.
1620,"Some of the antivaxxers are now terrified of the vaccinated people ""shedding viral particles"" on them so they're going to be wearing masks."
1621,Which...... reverse psychology works I guess?
1622,"Not that the mRNA vaccines have any viral particles in them, and the created RNA strands are made and dissolved in 24-36 hours which is why we felt like crap after the 2nd shot, but if it gets unvaccinated people to wear masks, I won't complain."
1623,no no .
1624,hold it.
1625,"that's a BS

1636,You need to find the correct one that tests for the specific antibodies in the vaccine.
1637,"Going to ask my specialist for a recommendation,"
1638,Now can we just reopen
1639,"Rather, with all capacity limits being removed soon, why are you anxious to stay masked another few weeks, until we can get our numbers down to last summer levels or so?"
1640,Is the mask itself a huge burden for a little while longer?
1641,The idea that you have to be blackmailed into doing the right thing.
1642,Not alot because we just started getting vaccines from the US very recently
1643,"There likely won't be spikes, but possibly clusters of unvaccinated people."
1644,"Spiking numbers would require the virus to still be spreading exponentially, when it in fact appears to be *decaying* exponentially."
1645,"https://www.reddit.com//r/bipolar 


?"
1646,"&gt;  I get the CDC wants the announcements to be as scientifically accurate as possible,

Oh, like at the beginning of all of this when the [CDC](https://twitter.com/cdcgov/status/1233134710638825473) told us *not* to wear masks even though in other countries wearing [masks](https://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/) has been normal for decades through flu seasons, allergy seasons, and even SARS."
1647,The CDC told us not to wear masks because they were worried about shortages.
1648,"Now, they are suddenly telling people that the fully vaccinated don't need to wear masks as a last ditch effort to motivate those that are still hesitant to get the shots."
1649,The CDC no longer seems to be impartial to me; they seem like an agency with an agenda.
1650,"In this age of misinformation and disinformation, mangled messaging can do untold amounts of harm."
1651,"mask made my life miserable, much more than any of the curfews or closures or other restrictions."
1652,Yes im allergic to masks and cant wait for them to go.
1653,"Weirdly, I think people don't weight rare negative and positive outcomes the same."
1654,"It is true that if you're unvaccinated that your chances of getting covid and having a really bad reaction, and possibly dying from it, are much higher than your chances of winning any lottery, but the latter is much more motivating for some reason."
1655,"Another point, this kind of random prize incentive is being used to entice people to answer surveys, or to donate to local public radio, etc."
1656,"It's a really powerful tool, more states should use this lottery system to encourage vaccinations."
1657,"Typically yes, but each variant themselves are random and can buck the trend."
1658,"The reason why variants that are more transmissible thrive is fairly obvious, but while lethality less so."
1659,"More deadly variants could kill the hosts too quickly, but the more likely reason why they don't become too common is due to the community responding by trying to stop the virus."
1660,It's not 70% everywhere... it's 30% in my state.
1661,"And yes I think it would be pretty reasonable to keep masks in schools/essential stores but still allow vaccinated adults to get back to normal socializing in other businesses, where kids and parents of young children can easily avoid."
1662,A lot of the unvaccinated still want to mask.
1663,"It's a venn diagram, not a perfect circle."
1664,Plenty of people are scared of both the vaccine and covid.
1665,Those people have now been told to choose one.
1666,"Also, great cop out to not answer the question."
1667,"My only point is that for a year we have been told that we need to “follow the science” (follow the CDC), no questions asked."
1668,Now the “science” says some people can take masks off and some states still want to keep mask mandates.
1669,My only point is that its hypocritical.
1670,"You cant say follow the science, no questions asked, then all of a sudden do a 180 when the science says something you dont like."
1671,It doesnt work like that.
1672,Bye Felicia
1673,"No, just being stupid."
1674,A Long term side effect of life is 100% probability of death.
1675,Because people are fatigued from dragging scientifically illiterate populations into the 21st century.
1676,They've spent the last 15 months trying to convince people to wear a mask and they still refuse.
1677,"Welp, the people who want the vaccine got the vaccine."
1678,"I feel bad for the 10% who got got the vaccine but will still feel covid, but if someone gets covid at this point and havent taken the vaccine thats on them."
1679,Only if you think you are going to win 😉
1680,Excellent!
1681,On the path to normalcy.
1682,60% of the U.S. has received at least one dose.
1683,Add in those who have already had COVID and we are very close.
1684,"Better get off r/Coronavirus, this sub that pretended to care about you for a year doesn’t anymore."
1685,This article makes me think of stories from Planned Parenthood where some woman comes in for an abortion but still sits there and complains to the doctor the whole time about how evil the doctor and PP are.
1686,"I imagine these 'late entries' are probably doing the same thing, getting their jab while talking about how they're taking poison for a chance at money."
1687,What’s the point of our President and CDC telling us it’s okay to drop the masks if private businesses are just going to do the opposite?
1688,"&gt; So your solution is to exclude people from society

If you are not on the path to vaccination as an adult at this stage you are acting antisocially and should be excluded."
1689,&gt; unlike people who cannot be vaccinated for legitimate medical concerns.
1690,Who are those people?
1691,So I want to start off with saying: i love Ohio.
1692,"Whenever someone makes a low-hanging-fruit joke about how no-one wants to be in/visit/live in Ohio, I am the first to defend it."
1693,I also don't want this to be an overtly-political comment.
1694,"It may have those tones, but that's the reality of the situation."
1695,My experience with Ohio is likely relatable to the target audience of this vaccine initiative.
1696,"While I've certainly been to Cleveland more than a once (the change in Cleveland from the 90s to now is great), I was born/raised/and continue to have strong family ties to middle-of-nowhere, cobblestone main street, rural Ohio."
1697,"I love those towns, I love how quiet and peaceful they are, I love how ""slow"" it is, how friendly you can be with just about everyone in town."
1698,"These aren't backhanded compliments, either."
1699,"As someone who lived a good chunk of life before the internet became a thing, I have a real appreciation for the ""disconnected"" life (even if all of those rural towns have some form of high speed internet now)."
1700,But the quaintness and nostalgia of those towns doesn't end at the construction or the population density.
1701,The people in these areas were once in amazing economic situations and some of the smaller cities/bigger towns were actually pretty well-off at the time.
1702,"But then the industries that built them up abandoned them, and a lot of ..... policies and .... decisions were made that pushed these people down and kept them there."
1703,"Unfortunately, these people were convinced that the cause of the downturn was... well, anyone and anything but the actual cause."
1704,"So, there's a deep-seated hatred and anger and fear, and yeah, it sucks."
1705,"Because you know these people on a personal level, and you know, in a one-on-one situation, they aren't bad people."
1706,They need help...
1707,"Needed it, a long time ago, and it's never coming."
1708,"So yeah, they'll all jump at getting a vaccine for a small hope of economic recovery, because being angry about masks and vaccines was never about masks and vaccines."
1709,"(and yeah, I know that you could sort of make this same kind of comment for so many other places in America, and it's true, there are these kinds of situations throughout the country, and each of them are as sad as the others, but this is specifically about Ohio, or, at least, my experiences in Ohio)"
1710,The problem is journalists ask these kinds of questions.
1711,"If a journalist asks a scientist or public policy worker “can vaccinated people still spread the virus”, which is a yes/no question, or even “can you rule out transmission from a vaccinated person”, the person answering will probably answer in yes/no format and add “those things are possible since we don’t know enough yet”."
1712,But if they rejected the question and took control by saying “if you’re looking for a yes/no you need to rethink; we are still acquiring data but based on the success of the trials we encourage everyone to get vaccinated”.
1713,"Don’t let journalists frame a tricky issue like that, the messaging gets screwed up."
1714,"I’m not sure if I trust their vaccines, to clarify I’m fully vaccinated not a anti vaccinator, so I don’t get downvoted to hell"
1715,&gt;I don’t understand why everyone forgets kids.
1716,"Because with 70% of adults vaccinated, kids would still be an issue."
1717,"Outside of keeping mask mandates in schools, public transit, and hospitals, what can be done about kids and the unvaccinated?"
1718,Because enforcing mandates on the vaccinated in every public situation is not a solution.
1719,[deleted]
1720,It's almost like people have different bodies
1721,"So did Korea and Taiwan and Vietnam and India and  etc

Peak will probably be lower than previous waves since even in the low vaccination states, there's still close to half vaccinated who weren't previously"
1722,"For people who don't want to read the whole thing, don't have enough time, watch this video: https://youtu.be/OlO8sKRynBY


Ps: I have no incentive here, just saw a very well researched video."
1723,Rocket Surgery is a joke that's been around for a while.

1831,I don’t think masks are necessarily a bad idea from a public health perspective for flus and other seasonal illness (so not just covid) but do we have a strategy for combating waste generation here?
1832,Should be encourage strictly cloth masks despite their less effectiveness  compared to medical?
1833,Florida has been notoriously open and tolerant throughout this whole pandemic.
1834,They've also had some of the most worrisome metric increases recently.
1835,[removed]
1836,Lol sorry should have tailored my comment better for reddit people...
1837,I mean china uses fear to control their population.
1838,Not neccesarily related to the virus just in general.
1839,The U.S. sensational response to this virus is an example of using fear to control the population.
1840,"It is not you job, it is the CDC's but they have abdicated their responsibilities in order to be part of the popular."
1841,It's easy to detect; the opposite sex has it.
1842,"The 37% number is referring to those who have received both doses, not those that have received both doses and waited 2 weeks."
1843,I like KF-94 quite a lot.
1844,It's a similar Korean standard.
1845,I tried KN95 but one of the 2 brands I tried was uncomfortable (earloops way too tight).
1846,"The issue is each bottle contains multiple doses and giving one dose to OP's aunt without a backlog of appointments or a wait list for the rest would mean some vaccine doses could go to waste, which the pharmacist would likely get in trouble for (they probably have some standing orders not to waste more than a certain amount from back when the supply was the constraint rather than the demand)"
1847,"People aren't used to risk management for transmissible diseases, especially respiratory ones."
1848,"There's going to be a lot of unrealistic expectations, especially among those who were able to effectively bottle themselves off from humanity."
1849,"When I'm walking in my fairly crowded, middle-to-low income NYC neighborhood people walk past eachother without issue."
1850,"When I'm cutting through the nice development to get to the store, people still cross the street to avoid eachother like April 2020."
1851,Nope.
1852,I’m vaccinated.
1853,I’m done.
1854,Wait I think your math is wrong.
1855,18 weeks from today is September 21st.
1856,"Yes obviously, never contested that."
1857,But it's been almost 18 months since covid has been here in the US.
1858,"It's already hit everywhere, every state."
1859,Not sure what point you are trying to make.
1860,"Respectfully, no, there’s no truth to this."
1861,The same conspiracy theory was floating around the United States when we were in the “bodies piling up in the streets” phase of the pandemic.
1862,As soon as a business opens up i am going over there and coughing on everyone.
1863,Great news.
1864,"The 7 day average is still in the 40s, though."
1865,Illinois is at 30.
1866,New York at 37.
1867,Im more so disturbed by everyones true colors that were exposed by this pandemic and cant look at some people the same anymore and/or can’t trust them.
1868,"I physically want to go out, and im vaccinated so im not fearful of the virus."
1869,"Its just the disturbing self centeredness, apathy, and amorality of the populous that really scares me."
1870,Everyone in the USA should get a vaccine; I view that as a responsibility.
1871,The government is paying for those vaccines so the people are already getting a gift.
1872,I don't believe that they should also get a shot at life altering money in addition to the free shot.
1873,I believe that the $5M could be better spent.
1874,The example I used was with Covid vaccines in India: $5M would purchase about 1M doses of the AstraZenecs vaccine that potentially could save thousands of lives.
1875,"I'd rather see that than five people in Ohio ""win mini lotteries""."
1876,"Never had that problem, pretty much everyone has had masks in my area."
1877,I have seen plenty without masks since the CDC guidance changed though
1878,You can sign up for the lotto if you've already been vaccinated.
1879,He's the most happiest kid I know.
1880,His friends love to come over and always ask for me to adopt them.
1881,Most are happiest when they are visiting then they are in their own homes.
1882,Teaching our kids values is a parent's job.
1883,I'm sorry that you haven't had a great experience working for a company.
1884,I guess I've been blessed to have left companies that made me feel great about myself and who have had my back when wanting to continue my education.
1885,I have 2 companies and I still have a friendship with my ex bosses and ex Co workers.
1886,"In fact, I am close to their families and get invited to BBQs."
1887,This obviously only applies in states that revoked their mask mandate.
1888,NJ still has a mask mandate for the time being.
1889,Exactly!
1890,And I bet the savings on the healthcare system would more than make up for it
1891,[deleted]
1892,I don’t know.
1893,Until infection rates lower significantly?
1894,Until children are able to be vaccinated?
1895,I’m not a doctor.
1896,"But is it that big an inconvenience to wear a mask to a supermarket to protect people from dying, even if it took a year?"
1897,I think lives are far more valuable than comfort.
1898,"If they want to make that argument, they need to actually make it and define what that looks like."
1899,"Just ""more people"" doesn't work."

Yup, if you really want a better, ""how to stop covid"" type of sub, this is not the one for you."
1920,"This is still seemingly a place for debate as to ""is this is really a problem?"
1921,""", or people who want to talk about how they are ""not getting vaccinated"", and ""not wearing a mask anymore after [insert arbitrary reason]""."
1922,There is much much less of that going on in places like /r/CoronavirusUS  and especially /r/COVID19.
1923,"No, the CDC and the WHO may give similar recommendations, but they aren't the same."
1924,This is an extremely ignorant (and american) view.
1925,"I'm not from the US, the CDC aren't a worldwide organisation."
1926,The WHO is.
1927,"When pressure was put on the WHO to investigate the origins, they pandered to china and trusted the word of the CCP."
1928,"In the past, pandemics have been recognised by the WHO when a few countries have infections."
1929,"This time, they waited until the whole world were infected to call it."
1930,This influences countries decision making on travel and kills people by proxy.
1931,Why did they do this?
1932,Because China are a bully and use their influence (and bribes) to force the WHO's hand in protecting their reputation.
1933,"The WHO is much more involved in worldwide geopolitics than medicine, and is a worldwide organisation unlike the CDC."
1934,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wouldn't a more plausible reason be that that's what the consensus medical advice globally was at the time?"
1935,No.
1936,"As a person with a biomedical science degree, and somebody who literally worked with PCR machines (Which diagnose COVID-19 by identifying SARS-COV-2 DNA), we ALWAYS had to wear a mask and gloves even prior to the pandemic."
1937,"It was well known that contaminants can aerosolize and cause infection, we knew this 10+ years ago during the swine flu epidemic."
1938,"Perhaps the CDC copied the WHO, but the guidance they set was pandering to China."
1939,"I can't comment on any bad advice given by the CDC, but I know the whole deal with ""Don't wear a mask, they don't work"" that the CDC and WHO set was to avoid a shortage in masks."
1940,This is TERRIBLE and caused a lot of people to lose faith in masks.
1941,The WHO also set recommendations early on pandering to China.
1942,"I am talking before it was a worldwide pandemic, while it was quietly spreading."
1943,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying the CDC is pro China (though they may well be)."
1944,I'm explicitly talking about the WHO.
1945,"If you really care, and are willing to have your mind changed, I will happily reference a timeline of all the shitty decisions the WHO made early on."
1946,"But truthfully I think that even if I provided hard evidence, you'd argue it."
1947,"Helping a critical thinker understand is worth my time, but if your views are set in stone, like many others online, then what's the point."
1948,"I don't know if SARS-CoV-2 is worse than HIV, though."
1949,@ GovHawaii
1950,How much longer?
1951,Reminds me of the reinfection craze last summer/fall.
1952,Couple of my acquaintances knew 5-10 people who had gotten it multiple times.
1953,"You dig a little deeper and the story is usually, “well, she had a fever and cough in October 2019 but didn’t get tested, and she thought she was immune!"
1954,"Then she tested positive last week!”

I have a feeling the same thing happened here."
1955,"Either those people lied about being vaccinated, or they caught it in between doses (much more likely than after the second dose)."
1956,No they said people who are vaccinated don’t need to wear masks because the science supports this.
1957,"Then it’s up to states, cities and businesses to make policies based on this information."
1958,"Some are more conservative about it like California, and some are more liberal with the rules like Texas."
1959,I doubt you know better than a bunch of public health experts

1989,I went and got my first jab at the Mercedes Benz Stadium in ATL yesterday and I was literally the only white person getting jabbed.

1999,&gt; We can look to China for one example of how easy it is to maintain power and do whatever you want when your citizens are terrified and made social pariahs if they go against what the govt says is true.

2030,Time to take off the FAKE masks now!
2031,"This isn't even accurate though, if you look into the states they list (like Texas) there was 31 deaths on the lowest day so far... so idk where they are getting their data, but its wrong."

2085,"You can try to pay more, but in many cities you just cannot keep up with the increasing traffic and increasd price of housing (and therefore...your employers have to move farther away from your in-person location)."
2086,Sure there are some benefits of in-person collaboration but many employers are going to find 100% in-office work to be a hard sell in the long run.

2096,"Indoor dining, travel, movies, seeing people, no mask unless required; all checked off."
2097,Few countries dragged their feet on vaccines.
2098,"Procurement has been a giant competitive global clusterfuck where wealthy countries used export restrictions to hoard doses, and aggressively bought more supply than they needed to guard against the risk of failed vaccines or production delays."
2099,Manufacturers like AstraZeneca have also reneged on contracts.

2118,I was hoping that with most at-risk and elderly people vaccinated it would be much lower than it is.
2119,But I guess the case counts are just too high right now.
2120,I don't think there's going to be another surge like we saw in the winter.
2121,It'll be like you said.

2123,There will be outbreaks here and there in places with low vaccination rates.

2129,Everyone is hyper aware of Covid right now and it’s 100% natural to take some precaution and such like that.
2130,But children are at risk for lots of things probably in that same risk level.

2149,Masks are not a safety measure for vaccinated people.
2150,Checking people for drunk driving isn’t the same as punishing people for driving sober.
2151,Forcing vaccinated people to wear masks when they pose insignificant risk is like arresting people for driving sober.

2164,I’ve never seen a vaccine in my life that causes such severe effects that bedriddens people for days.
2165,You wanna know why?
2166,"Because those vaccines were tested for decades, with different varied formulas, to provide good immunity with low side effects."
2167,Moderna formulated the formula for their vaccine in just 2 days and you can look it up for yourself if you don’t believe me.
2168,"No reformulations happened, and no other formulas were tested."
2169,It’s an unrefined vaccine and that’s why side effects are so common and harsh.

2195,"Smart people use critical thinking skills and change their minds and change positions based on new information, right?"

2217,AZ had *terrible* results in a study against the South Africa variant.
2218,"It only showed 10% protection, and the error bars were big enough that it might have had no effect at all."
2219,This was extremely well-publicised at the time.

2232,New Hampshire and Vermont can do whatever they fuck they want if they feel it's safe to do so.

2234,Why didn’t they just make it that you need to have 60-70 percent to drop the mask mandate?
2235,Wouldn’t that have made more sense
2236,They already are providing financial incentive in some states where if you get the vaccine you are entered into a lottery.
2237,I can’t believe places aren’t even at 50 percent and still dropping masks.
2238,Wasn’t the number like 70 for it to be happen.

2269,"We teens are going to need to take it one way or the other, as time goes by 

Regardless of parents liking it or not, I’m doing my part for getting my friends vaccinated."
2270,Most people I know who don’t get it just don’t have a ride or have parents against it.
2271,I’ve seen maybe 5 people against getting it.
2272,Some absolute dumb fuck was telling me I’m gonna turn into a zombie… guess where that information came from… their mom

2450,I don’t know why we feel the need to ban that as well.
2451,Why is Texas Governor and his party intentionally endangering children?
2452,Trump didn't develop the vaccine.
2453,Seems fair to say that its unlikely we'd see it within a year when this thing started especially given the relatively unproven nature of the rna vaccine type.
2454,Lockdown do not work in the long term.
2455,Works perfectly for reducing hospital getting overran.
2456,should i believe in nurses or the top level scientists/doctors at the cdc?
2457,hmmmm
2458,Go ahead.
2459,Just remember to wear a mask though.
2460,Nope official guidance is once symptoms are cleared and a few days or something like that.
2461,It’s been like that for many months now.
2462,The 90 days that everyone remembers is if you have had any form of monoclonal antibodies in your Covid protocol (passive vaccination).
2463,Well I'm glad Biden's sending millions of doses to other countries that may need them.
2464,I think that’s mostly due to lack of testing abilities/facilities early on during the pandemic?
2465,So because of all those what if’s you really think it’s necessary to ban people from social media for saying “I trust my immune system to fight covid” ?
2466,"Maybe this It's time to use some illogical reverse psychology s***, I like saying that eating small amounts of Indian food will build immunity against potential Indian variants"
2467,"This seems like it was written by a middle schooler, just based on the tone and the language choices."
2468,I'm vaccinated and unmasked.
2469,I do not mind whatsoever if others continue wearing their masks.
2470,Why would I ask someone else to take their mask off?
2471,Just weird all around.

&gt;Some 53 million people in the U.S. likely had had Covid-19 by the end of September, according to a modeling estimate from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

2510,Meh I see nothing wrong with Hawaii wanting a vaccine passport.
2511,Hawaii is so remote that they can't risk a COVID-19 outbreak by being relaxed with their border.
2512,It's perfectly justifiable in their case.
2513,I really doubt high schools will require vaccination.
2514,I can't find any schools that said they would.
2515,A buddy of mine experienced an elevated heart rate due to stress the day after his shot.
2516,"The stress combined with the vaccine symptoms caused him to pass out twice, which never happened to him before."
2517,I'd say to take it easy if I were you.

2526,Is reporting things a crime now?
2527,I thought that 90 days after Covid was the guidance for when to get the vaccine if you've had Covid?
2528,"If so, then a few months is a good length to wait."
2529,I noted it was debated and disputed (the lab theory) when I linked it.

2537,Sorry you had to go through any of that.
2538,The woman in the article was on steroids and other immunosuppressants.
2539,She wasn’t just immunocompromised.
2540,Only way we hit 85% vaxxed is if a super variant comes out and kills 80% of the unvaxxed population.
2541,"Alright, i'll tell my gf some random guy on the internet said she def hasn't flown to Belgium twice in the past 6 months."
2542,Isn’t the increase in efficiency proportional to the first dose?
2543,I’m not sure that’s coming out right.
2544,"Basically, if dose 1 creates X each additional dose adds Y and Y is always less than X."
2545,Law of diminishing returns or whatever.
2546,One of my coworkers in India just lost his father to covid.
2547,Best wishes to all of you.
2548,People on immunosuppressants (like the first woman) and people with cancer/weakened immune systems will likely not have appropriate immune responses to the vaccine.
2549,That’s just how vaccines work.

2553,I assure you the professionals who have been studying epidemiology for likely longer than you have been alive have a much firmer grasp on the science than you do.

2558,Deaths and hospitalizations are plummeting faster than cases are now 85% of those over the age of 65 are vaccinated with at least one shot.
2559,We have single digit deaths and the number of new hospitalizations is very very low.
2560,"Furthermore anyone who wanted the vaccine has had over a month to get it with very good appointment availability, so if they don't have one shot by now then they only have themselves to blame"

2604,You can keep not wearing masks in rural areas but cities should be different.
2605,"Well that's the whole point, right?"
2606,That's why CDC recommendations include continuing to mask for things like mass transit or in-person schools.
2607,Those are the 'construction sites' in the metaphor.
2608,Scientists and billions of dollars in funding made these - and every other - vaccines; no gods involved.

I highly doubt that"
2630,"I'm ok with that, it won't get out of hand since hospitals know how to treat now and the exposed population is much more scarce, not including the u vaconnated folks who wear makes and/or social distance."
2631,While that would be preferable to what is happening to India that would still be far far from ideal.
2632,If the US and EU are back to life as normal while China is welding apartment doors shut and can't supply enough vaccines that would still be a very bad look for the Chinese government.

2686,If it isn’t clear to you than there is nothing more to add.
2687,You still wouldn’t get it anyway.
2688,And that’s fine!
2689,Some people like to be spoon fed and some can think for themselves.
2690,If you are good with the numbers until reality strikes and you are directly affected so be it.
2691,Is there any reason to assume its random?
2692,Seems like its a few weeks after anyone who grabbed an appointment in the first week would be fully protected.
2693,"I booked my appointment the first day it was available in Long Beach, and I am fully protected on Saturday."
2694,This gives a few weeks buffer before everyone can go out without masks.

2708,Just the two of us.
2709,Fully vaccinated.
2710,I don’t get it...like she believed in the vaccine enough to get it but doesn’t believe in it enough for it to protect her?
2711,Especially when BOTH of us are vaccinated??
2712,"And that limits what we can do together, have to be masked the whole time."
2713,God forbid I get hungry.

2715,"I don’t know man, I’m just tired of this."
2716,"So, so tired."
2717,Yeah that makes sense.
2718,For some reason the CDC has decided that it's worth the risk to allow people to go unmasked once vaccinated.
2719,If a newly mutated strain that was vaccine resistant was confirmed to be spreading in the US I would be happy to put the mask back on but so far that mutation has not been confirmed.

2960,They kind of did in Florida.
2961,They wanted to see them when you were walking in but I usually took mine off after.
2962,They can't really enforce it though.
2963,If they don't want people to spend money there I guess that's their choice but they'd have to be nuts to deny a sale.
2964,Exactly.
2965,Plenty of locations to get the vaccine.
2966,Go right now to vaccines.gov and tell me where vaccines are impossible to find within 2 days.
2967,I’ll wait.
2968,Hence why I said relatively rare.
2969,9.2K (of people that got tested) before we eased restrictions and you said you couldn’t bring the virus home.
2970,You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
2971,You can absolutely bring the virus home which is shown in the very studies you just posted.
2972,"You even said they only tracked serious cases so you literally have no real data anymore that reflects accurate risk to bringing the virus home, especially after lifting mask mandates."
2973,Sometimes I think it will take just one more catastrophic event and the whole company will implode.
2974,"I believe in the various COVID relief acts that congress passed, there is a provision that every employer has to provide minimum 14 days paid sick time related to COVID."
2975,COVID vaccine counts for that.
2976,So your employer is legally required to give you a paid time off if you feel sick the day after the vaccine.
2977,"Also, if you are working from home, you probably will not have symptoms so severe that you can’t work."
2978,"Unless you have some all hands on deck deadline that requires you to work long days, you will probably be okay."

3094,etc.
3095,That's all I'm saying.

3097,It worked quite well but it's not 100% perfect.

3102,Mistake by the Trump admin IMO to not have kept him/not have moved him over.
3103,Young people apparently don’t understand the effectiveness of the vaccines.
3104,they kinda have to ... it will take 3 months for all to get vaccinated.
3105,Meanwhile... take a look at Luxembourg ... already done with vaccination!
3106,That's efficiency!

3110,That still doesn't change anything though.
3111,How do you let the vaccinated return to complete normality but also don't let anti-vaxxers overwhelm the NHS?
3112,"If that happens, everyone is affected."
3113,How come everybody forgets that kids with underlying conditions exist too?
3114,"Considering \~0.2% of the US population has died from Covid-19, I seriously doubt 0.5% more people would die, especially since the most vulnerable (older and fatter) are more likely to have already received the vaccine."
3115,Mate you need to look at a mirror for how gullible you’ve been with media
3116,Cant trust the government.
3117,Now here zuck have all my personal info and plans.

3131,"As of a week ago, my entire family (parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles) are all vaccinated with our first shot."
3132,Finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.
3133,Can’t wait until we get our second shot!
3134,My mom was confused by this news because they said that you need to still wear masks after being vaccinated.
3135,"(Her and I are both fully vaccinated)

I explained to her that telling people who are vaccinated to wear masks isn’t to protect themselves, it’s to protect the unvaccinated people."
3136,"Vaccinated people can still get it and spread it, they are just very likely to only have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, meaning unvaccinated people will now be at even higher risk if vaccinated people all stop wearing masks and socially distancing."
3137,Now I just hate myself

3147,The American private sector can force you to do pretty much anything as long as it’s not a crime or discriminatory
3148,"Not alarmist at all, I feel the same way"
3149,Vaccinating kids wasn’t the priority.
3150,The priority was the elderly and rightly so.
3151,The priority now is vaccinating enough people in this country and around the world.
3152,Children though are not at near the same risk overall as older adults with underlying conditions
3153,"Oh, we're certainly on the right track."
3154,But we're not *quite* there yet.
3155,A lot of people seem extremely allergic to erring on the side of caution as we come out of the worst pandemic in a century.
3156,It's weird to me.
3157,This will be downvoted to oblivion.
3158,Guess who is doing the downvoting?
3159,What does a mask mandate close?
3160,A subset of conservatives are fairly loud and obnoxious but the vaccine hesitancy is far more evenly split than reddit comment sections represent.
3161,"Black and brown inner city communities have low uptake, for a variety of reasons, and traditionally don’t vote republican."
3162,"I still need to mask up because my state's mask mandate is still in place, and probably will be until vaccination % gets up into the 70s and 80s."
3163,Same.
3164,"To me it is like wearing big sunglasses, it makes me feel less noticeable."
3165,I hate showing my face in public but love going out so this is a great way to accomplish both goals.

3168,Anything is possible.
3169,The chances of you getting the virus are extremely low.
3170,Even Fauci said the chances a vaccinated person spread the virus are really low.
3171,The chances they die or go to the hospital are also low
3172,I'm picturing a bunch liberals in double masks and hard hats this summer from trusting the science too hard.
3173,Yep and Israel has a vaccine passport which the UK will also be using.
3174,The US is going to be the only country with zero measures whatsoever in place.
3175,They aren't washing their hands either.
3176,🤢
3177,You people cried for over a year about conservatives not wanting to follow the advice of the CDC in regards to the pandemic.
3178,"Now that the CDC is saying something that you don't like, you want to cry about it too."
3179,"I don't know shit about the subject, so I followed all the recommendations, I wore a mask whenever I was out in public, I limited my exposure by rarely going out, I didn't see my parents for a full year, along with many friends."
3180,"Now the CDC is supporting loosening restrictions, including masks indoors, and while they stated it applies to vaccinated individuals, it's quite obvious that they'd be fully aware of unvaccinated people who are just waiting for their chance to take their masks off."
3181,"Despite that, the CDC decided that is the correct recommendation to make."
3182,"They have people a lot more educated on the situation than you or me, so I have absolutely no issue with following their advice, and not wearing my mask any longer since I've been vaccinated for months now."
3183,There are 100+ year old legal decisions that say the state can send cops to your house and force you to be vaccinated.
3184,Thay pretty much happens all over reddit.
3185,Also they wait until a post is older so it's not quite as visible and downvote everything they don't like.
3186,USA!
3187,USA!
3188,USA!
3189,A few weeks ago this sub couldn't wait to get to UK/Israel levels.

3192,So you’re saying kids should be at greater risk so you can pick up someone at a bar?

3196,"Oh wow, don't break the bank."
3197,"Good News, and great for Canada."

3315,NZ is not and never has been committed to eradication.
3316,"Elimination was always going to be temporary, until we had a vaccine to achieve herd immunity."
3317,Now it is simply a matter of waiting for the vaccination campaign to be fully rolled out in NZ.
3318,NZ is getting its doses well before Australia with the mass campaign starting in July with peak numbers expected from September to November.
3319,We may be able to open the borders to vaccinated people from low-risk countries (which would likely include the US) by late 2021 or early 2022.
3320,"Ardern and Bloomfield have said we will have to live with low levels of Covid in the community once the borders are opened, so that is being planned for."

3331,"This means that the vaccination center is fully booked through this week, maybe even through the end of the month."
3332,"They haven’t even opened it up to 60-70 year olds yet, so they’re probably going to get the first week in June."
3333,"Basically, there are going to be a ton of leftover people from these groups left to duke it out with the general public to somehow get an appointment before the vaccination center closes."

3398,And all the people who genuinely can’t be vaccinated for health reasons.
3399,It's because our society put children last during COVID-19.
3400,We robbed them a year and a half of education and crucial social development.

Should consult a doctor about whether to take off your mask off if any of these apply to you:

- Immunocompromised
- Common conditions that weaken immunity: diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart disease, pregnancy

3482,I have bad lower body swelling/inflammation and a bloated abdominal area for a week now.

3488,Likewise my friend.
3489,It has been a rough year.
3490,You have a literal 99.999% chance of living if you catch corona virus and are under 18.
3491,The vaccine does zero for you.
3492,"Shots shots shots shots shots

Shots shots shots shots shots

Shots shots shots shots shots

Shots, everybody"
3493,We would love to get out our nexus card to use again and visit BC again from WA.
3494,oh wait it’s the other way around.
3495,the vaccinated get the option to wear a mask or not.
3496,depending on their mood at the moment.
3497,that's the beauty of being vaccinated
3498,I brought up the community spread because it plays in to how some people calculate risk around the vaccines.
3499,Because (I’m assuming  my stance is like hers) from our point of view It’s still not as safe as you can be.
3500,90-95% is  still a 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 chance.
3501,Multiplied by every maskless or nose-peekin person the both of you run into at the at the grocery those statistics can still be concerning for someone.
3502,we believe in the vaccine but we know it’s not an auto cure.
3503,"(as a note, I’m honestly not trying to put you on blast."
3504,Figured it would help to explain the thought process some of more hesitant people have to help further understanding between people weighing Risks differently.
3505,"having very recently been on the other side of this situation, having a friend back up my masking up actually helped me become more comfortable with smaller groups.)"
3506,fully vaccinated.
3507,i sometimes feel hated for going outside without a mask.
3508,now i know how you antimask people feel.
3509,I think you might be misunderstanding what vaccine efficacy means.
3510,I found [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ndimqk/daily_discussion_thread_may_16_2021/gyedbtx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) explaining it extremely helpful because there’s a lot of misinformation around what it means
3511,I think you’re confusing anti maskers and people who don’t want to wear a mask any longer.
3512,Why would I be anti what you want to wear?
3513,You wanna wear a mask go ahead.
3514,"You wanna wear a suit jacket with sweat pants, why would I care?"
3515,"You do you, I don’t see why there would be any problems."
3516,From what I’ve come across people are against being forced to do something.
3517,They’re not against masks per say or your right to wear one.
3518,How do you know they are not vaccinated?
3519,Is that info official?
3520,What is stopping them from saying they are vaccinated to just stop wearing a mask?
3521,I'm just curious about how this is playing out at different workplaces.
3522,I'm being told the office's lawyers say you can't ask if someone is vaccinated.
3523,You are totally right.
3524,I just want to fill in to give more context.
3525,The reason Taiwan is in the mess right not is large part due to the government's failure to put tighter restriction on airline workers.
3526,"Unlike other internationals travelers, airline workers only need to do a 3 day quarantine, and they are asked to avoid crowded place once the quarantine is over."
3527,Taiwan has already had an incident when a pilot got sick and he was caught going on a date with his mistress in a mall even though he was supposed to go to such places.
3528,The recent outbreak happened because some of the airline workers decided not to follow the rules and decided to go visit the red light district right after their 3 day quarantine.
3529,All this could have been avoided if the government made it their priority to vaccinate the airline workers and put tighter restrictions on their quarantine rules.
3530,The failure has nothing to do with the effectiveness of masks.
3531,It's all about some people being stupid enough to break the rules and the government's failure to address a glaring problem with their system.
3532,We have plans to come to BC at the end of June and again at the end of July.
3533,My wife and I have our 1st doses.
3534,Hoping interprovincial travel is allowed by then so we can come.
3535,"The immunocompromised are in a tough spot, covid or not."
3536,"When I talk about the return to normal, I'm not referring to you."
3537,I wish the vaccine worked for you.
3538,"However, there's a contingent of people who have no immune condition who apparently need to be reminded that our vaccines are exceptionally effective."
3539,"Their stubbornness impedes a well-functioning society because they are not quietly keeping to themselves, but making unreasonable demands of the rest of us and making a mockery out of science."
3540,"So your argument is: If it were wrong it would be illegal, therefore it is right."
3541,I’m sure that sounded more devastating in your head.
3542,Lots of potentially harmful things aren’t illegal.
3543,Does this really matter?
3544,From what I have been told the California mask mandate is ignored by basically everyone at this point.
3545,I’m in the same boat as you.
3546,My husband has been so amazing about this.
3547,But being immunocompromised fucking sucks.
3548,I had to quit my job because they denied my ADA request three times to continue to work from home for a few more months.
3549,You don't understand why someone might want something that doesn't benefit them personally?
3550,Kind of outing yourself there...

3561,There is more than enough for every single American citizen.
3562,The US is stockpiling vaccines by the tens of millions that it cannot ever use.
3563,That’s a lot of assumptions that you’re making.
3564,"Sure, some people are obviously lying about getting vaccinated."
3565,But to just assume that’s all people are doing and some people can’t just be genuinely happy that they’re vaccinated and can safely shop in Target without a mask on is ludicrous at best.
3566,maybe because I am scared that the variants can still infect us.
3567,Its a choice.
3568,After all in one study Astra Zaneca vaccine was 10% effective after double dose.
3569,We haven't see a pfizer study (outside the lab) against the various variants in India and stuff.
3570,"Till a peer reviewed study comes and says that this moderna vaccine protects against the variant in India, mask stays on."

3583,Ugh
3584,"Huh, tell that to the person on Twitter who blocked me for suggesting we don't need to wear masks anymore if vaccinated."
3585,Some people are really wrapped up in wearing facemasks as their identity.

3587,We're going to probably be seeing them at least on some people for another year at least.
3588,Same
3589,But your arm is fine now?
3590,Congrats.
3591,Then I would ask you to peruse the catacombs of your memory and you may recall what a smug smile looks like from a customer getting away with something.
3592,It’s like the cat who caught the canary.
3593,These customers are all too happy to lie about being vaxxed just to not have the extreme inconvenience of having fabric cover part of their face for a brief period of time.
3594,Well she said she is worried that it could affect her fertility in the future and also possible side effects years from now that could occur
3595,Reminder that a Canadian team hasn’t won the Stanley Cup since 1993 :)
3596,Menards.
3597,They didn’t even allow kids for awhile when the pandemic started.
3598,Some antivax people have learned to wear masks to protect themselves from the 5G radiation emitted by vaccinated people.
3599,"If someone starts to harass you, just wave your fingers in the air and say ""FIIIVE GEEE"" in a really creepy voice."

3603,"Military, embassy employees basically chose to leave leave the US but are being vaccinated."
3604,Why can’t all citizens who would like to get vaccinated?
3605,We are all still US citizens and many of us still pay taxes in the US.
3606,"Dude the outbreak you're talking about infected 200 people and caused one death in the US (Swine flu, 1976)."
3607,"The vaccine they developed caused a side effect that did kill (although 25 died, not 50 people."
3608,"but whatever ) The vaccine hurt more than it helped, and they pulled it."
3609,"This was also 40+ years ago, medicine (like all other tech) has evolved since then, and that includes vaccines."
3610,"We have more information than ever, including the fact that in the US alone over 586,000 people have died from covid...

Also, the side effect that caused this appeared in patients within 10 weeks of injection... most side effects from vaccines take place in a close time frame like this so trials are able to catch them."

3650,Yeah he just kept it hidden.
3651,I also discredit Li Chen Hyuyang or whatever his name was.
3652,He was a Chinese doctor that died of covid at the beginning of the pandemic.
3653,"""Clinical recommendation"" is a high bar to hit and I doubt that this gentleman, with all his information publicly available on this AMA is going to be willing to give such an advisory opinion."
3654,Usually multiple studies with systematic reviews are published and reviewed by committees of clinicians before clinical recommendations are made.
3655,"A lot of studies on aspirin and covid have come out, and a lot of organizations have mentioned the possibility of using aspirin early on in the disease to improve prognosis, but you'll be hard pressed to find a hard and fast answer as many of these recommendations are in specific subpopulations - patients on ventilators, patients who took aspirin prior to testing positive, etc."
3656,"That being said, baby aspirin is pretty common and low risk and I haven't seen studies showing adverse effects on covid positive patients sooooo..."
3657,My husband and 2/3 of my brothers all had very minimal side effects from both doses.
3658,Sore arm was the most annoying side effect they got
3659,"A spike in cases where 95% of them voluntarily chose to not get vaccinated is not really relevant, that's why the CDC made this guidance."
3660,"If you're vaccinated, you're fine, if you're not, get the vaccine and you'll be fine, otherwise the CDC doesn't really care about you."
3661,"As for the small percentage of Americans who can't the vaccine for medical reasons, they were always going to need to take their own precautions anyway because Covid will be around for years, if not decades."
3662,That's a very rational question and a distinct possibility.
3663,Check with your work?
3664,"Well, me and mine are vaccinated."
3665,"If people don't trust science and catch it, it's not my problem anymore."

3746,First I don't trust the cdc.
3747,Both fauci and the cdc have either outright lied or misled us to get what they want.
3748,But in this case it looks like you are interpreting data yourself.
3749,You are not a statistician.
3750,You do not know if the data being collected is comprehensive enough or if you are reading it correctly though you yourself are so certain you are.
3751,"As I said before asymptomatics often get a negative result,  you do not know if that affected the numbers."
3752,You do not know barely anything about the data collected.
3753,I'm not a science denier.
3754,I've always supported global warming.
3755,When the vast majority of experts believe in global warning I believe it's likely and would play it safe and follow their advice.
3756,"On the virus, the people that are supposed to share science with us outright lie and change their minds every second of the day."
3757,And the way you are interpreting data may not be accurate.
3758,I find it to be ego to assume you yourself are 100% right.
3759,The risk versus reward is not there.
3760,You are risking permanent damage to the kids or even death.
3761,"Even if the risk is low, the price is too high."
3762,I'm actually a retired civil engineer and this type of catastrophic risk would not be taken (unless sadly people in power force it) in a situation like this.
3763,The probability of catastrophe may be low but not even close to nonexistent.
3764,In this case it's better to play it safe just in case.
3765,Meaning just have kids miss 3 more months of school.
3766,Only 3 months.
3767,&gt; The unvaccinated only pose a threat to the unvaccinated.
3768,And unvaccinated children....yea CDC has lost all credibility.

3770,Belgium being 11mil people (for comparison)
3771,That will work EVERYWHERE!
3772,It’s catching up at last.
3773,no need for this fatalistic thinking.
3774,"Lots of vaccines are coming, you will be vaccinated in the next couple of months at the latest, if your over 16 and willing to get a shot."
3775,"Take your phone, call 5 different GPs and you will find a solution for your mom, too."
3776,good luck!
3777,"&gt; I'm not sure how much longer he can hold out

Not much longer."
3778,I fully expect that next week he will announce the immediate lifting of all remaining restrictions (there aren't that many after tomorrow) except for the indoor mask mandate.
3779,"He's also said that he will allow the emergency order to expire on June 13 so long as the legislature acts (which is really about funding, not restrictions)."
3780,So probably around June 7 he will announce the indoor mask mandate will expire along with the EO on June 13.
3781,"And you expect us to take CDC more seriously when they literally said that face masks don't work for healthy people based on the science, then flip-flop on it two months later?"
3782,"About 1.5 million AZ, and..."
3783,I think now it's been 4 million doses of Pfizer?
3784,"Don't think all of that 4 million has been injected yet, we only just started getting Pfizer from across the border"
3785,Belgium alone is doing 800.000 shots this week.
3786,We really starting to get near full speed now.

3788,I’ll keep wearing my masks.

4053,It's so weird.

4055,:)
4056,Yet there 's a very simple logic to it.
4057,The vaccines are approved only by EUA.
4058,"Even if they look effective and are promising, that doesn't change the fact they are still only approved as per EUA."
4059,This emergency use is meant for those directly at risk.
4060,"But young people, especially minors, seem not very much directly affected by covid."
4061,There's nothing more to it.
4062,There are no antivax conspiracies.
4063,"There are only people waiting for these vaccines to get fully approved, not in the least because current vaccine technology is high tech that was never used on such a large scale."
4064,"For sure once the covid vaccines are fully approved, as in not only for emergency use as per EUA (but with peer reviewed 4th phase trial stats), vaccination rollout won't even be questioned anymore, even with minors."
4065,The covid vaccine will then become just one of the general vaccinations.
4066,"And next to that, once the fully tested use of mRNA technology has been shown, it will be the next step for a lot of vaccinations."
4067,"Except that the virus can spread  and mutate more freely (you can still infect others when vaccinated, just to a lesser degree), and it just takes the right mutation to render the vaccine almost useless."
4068,"As long as a considerable part of the population isn´t vaccinated, this pandemic won´t be over."

4137,And that's before we get into what the process of actually working and interacting with customers all day looks like.
4138,I’d say the way the states and CDC are treating this is most consistent with how our country and government typically acts.
4139,USA has never been the place for rules just because “it’s not hurting anyone”.
4140,Also remember what you’re asking for.
4141,You asking for a mask mandate or requiring masks.
4142,You always will and always have had the right to wear one yourself but you’re asking to force others to do it.

4208,"They only test about 7,000 to 8,000 people a day in Tokyo."
4209,So that's a 10% Positivity rate.
4210,"&gt;Auckland population density: 2,400/km2

Taipei population density: 9,700/km2

​Yes Taipei is far denser, but density alone doesn't cause massive spread."
4211,Here is a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-does-not-doom-cities-to-pandemic-dangers/) article about the question of density in Covid spread.
4212,The basic point is that density isn't the issue it is crowding.
4213,Crowding may or may not be more common in dense urban areas.
4214,"A key data point: 

&gt;Even in hard-hit New York City, Manhattan has maintained the lowest COVID-19 rates among the city’s five boroughs, despite having the highest population density."
4215,Meanwhile some lower-density neighborhoods in Queens and the Bronx have seen higher rates of infection and death.
4216,"​Having higher density in Taipei didn't guarantee faster spread, but it may have increased the risk level."
4217,Which simply means there was even greater need to have regular surveillance and community testing to catch any clusters before they could get out of control.
4218,Density can't explain number jumping from 20-30 to 300 in a couple days unless the virus was already spreading.
4219,"Contact tracing alone isn't enough because people lie, such as the case you mentioned."
4220,"In NZ the August and February clusters saw multiple people mislead the contact tracers, conceal meetings, act totally against the advice and visit churches and gyms and uni lectures while infectious."
4221,That's why we have all the extra testing in NZ as a constant baseline.
4222,&gt;Context.
4223,"In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan."
4224,"6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined."
4225,"Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling."
4226,I don't understand what this has to do with testing.
4227,Why would high levels of movement before the borders closed in 2019 relate to testing within the community today?
4228,I'm talking about having doctors regularly test anyone who presents with cold and flu symptoms and testing wastewater regularly for signs of Covid.
4229,Not even the state's budget.
4230,They're using federal Covid relief money for it.
4231,"I'm in the UK looking at the US reopening with 500 deaths a day like 👁👄👁

4259,And how could this be not even more significant when these undetected cases are priviliged with personal contacts through political consolidation by digital passport obtained from the vaccination?

4304,"You were saying it was just going to be some redneck shops that wouldn’t allow you to enter without a mask, but it’s going to be every single bank that requires you to not wear one"
4305,Yeah but because so many young people jumped the queue.
4306,Once it opens for everyone there will be much less demand too because so many are already vaccinated.
4307,So by mid to end of June it should be extremely easy to get a vaccine
4308,The difference is HGTV gets paid for people watching their programming.
4309,How does the government make money by doing this?
4310,That is like saying a tax write-off is an advertisement and not an incentive.
4311,Keep it coming.
4312,I think we’re all ready for this to be over!
4313,Decreasing 20% weekly.
4314,States with restrictions and without restrictions performing comparably.
4315,The vaccine has taken hold of the situation as of now.
4316,The future has and will always be unknown but the data currently is extremely positive.
4317,Bugchasers would like a word with you.
4318,100% this.
4319,I’d say at least 50% of my workplace in Canada are rather vocal about not getting vaccinated
4320,"The whole ""if you're young you have nothing to worry about"" line is so selfish and small-minded."
4321,"A young person can carry the disease, suffer no symptoms, and spend weeks spreading it to everyone they encounter, and there's no guarantee that either they or the people THEY spread it to are going to have that same youthful fortitude."
4322,"In a pandemic, we can't afford to think solely of ourselves."
4323,We have to all be in this together.
4324,Whatever makes people happy.
4325,Similar for me.
4326,"I'm sitting here watching my cousins become rabid antivaxxers and it's putting the rest of my family off as well, so while my parents, grandparents etc are eligible none of them have got it where I'd kill to have it but will be waiting at least a couple more months..."
4327,I assume this is going to be needed every time they need to give out jabs - like next year?
4328,?
4329,70 million doses unaccounted for.
4330,That's a lot.
4331,And yet these anti-vaxxers do so with impunity.
4332,I agree; it's insane.
4333,"Yes, it will go away in Summer when the weather gets warmer..."
4334,There should have been guidance because wearing glasses does protect from catching covid.
4335,"Double-masking is supposed to fit an ill-fiting, good mask to the face by using a good-fitting bad mask."
4336,"If you breath in the aerosols through the gaps, they don't really work that well."
4337,"If you're one of the few who are able to bend the little wire in the mask, you can do that as well."
4338,"Exactly the same in Argentina but with 80+ ppl and doctors, and this dorks have to be tricked into getting the vaccine."
4339,My mind just can’t understand how can they be so against being inmune to the worst virus in the last 100 years.

4341,Testing herd-immunity with real lives.
4342,Anti-Vaxxers will be the first to realise... all too late.
4343,[removed]
4344,Yep.
4345,I experienced a similar situation.
4346,I am genuinely curious to see what the anti-vaxxers who claim that the vaccine is some deadly poison will say when the vast majority of the population is vaccinated and suffering no ill effects.
4347,"Like, how many of them will admit that they were wrong about this, even if only privately, and how many of them will try to find some rationalization as to how despite the evidence we're all secretly poisoned or something."
4348,[removed]
4349,"Also, if they are not willed enough from the start, it's better them to get it now, because later they would be the ones that say they that they don't need it."
4350,This way we can vax more people in the end.
4351,I like realizing more and more about how this is working out.
4352,"I wonder if some people actually planned and anticipated it this way, or it's just clueless decisions coming together"
4353,what is that photo lmao
4354,-	The CDC is not telling people to stop wearing masks.
4355,It it telling vaccinated people that under most conditions they don’t have to wear them.
4356,It’s their choice.
4357,-	Of course there is no 100% guarantee of safety.
4358,Neither is there a 100% guarantee you won’t get die from any other cause.
4359,Oh wow Canada got their doses way earlier than I thought.
4360,I remember a Canadian redditor (supposedly) saying that the country wouldn’t get supply until September.
4361,Ohio sees selfish people with no real convictions climbing out of the woodworks***
4362,"Interesting idea, hadn’t thought of this."
4363,"We’re in the Battle Royale phase of everyone fighting for vaccines in Germany right now since there’s no system of being given appointments here, so it’s like trying to buy a stadium concert ticket online now with trying to snag an appointment."
4364,It’d be a freaking relief if those of us desperate for a vaccine could get one soon!
4365,Got mine yesterday (BC)!
4366,"Plenty of friends who are nurses and teachers and have had them for a while, but the last of my friend group are finishing up this week and we’re all so stoked to breathe a little easier"
4367,That's what always seemed weird to be when americans were concern trolling about our low vaccine numbers.
4368,"Jake Tapper was insufferable about this on twitter, crying crocodile tears over how Canada ""deserves better"".."
4369,"I pointed out that we were still one of the top countries in the world, and it was weird how the gap between the US and Canada was so tragic, but not the gap between UK and US... why did we ""deserve better"" and France etc who were lower than us didn't?"
4370,"Anyway, it was obvious all along.. it doesn't matter how quickly you roll out doses to the 45% of your population who will take them.. what's going to matter is what % are willing to take them."
4371,So here we are.
4372,"No, this is Merica."
4373,Don’t give up hope.
4374,In the USA vaccination demand dropped sharply after 40% of total population got their first dose.
4375,Let’s say that’s 50% in Germany which would be at 40 million people.
4376,We’re currently at 32 million in Germany increasing by 700k every day.
4377,So in  10 days demand should start dropping imo so you have a few days before it open for everyone for your mother to get vaccinated.
4378,"I think that point of view was probably considered, but quickly discarded as it would 100% have backfired."
4379,"People would have revolted, and there would have been anarchy."
4380,"I think hesitancy back in the early days was close to 50%, the only reason it has gone down is people seeing their peers willingly go get the shot, not the fear of going to jail."
4381,"You can only downplay it for so long … last year the number of cases spiked shortly after the announcement of postponing the game to 2021 , guess the history is repeating itself this year"

4383,Have you heard that a lot of states haven’t really had that much mask participation or at least some pockets?
4384,And the rates aren’t that far off from other states that have had a mask participation?
4385,Don’t get me wrong I believe masks do work but I believe the advocacy is also lower than what is being touted.
4386,I have a much higher chance of dying on a normal work day than dying from the virus.
4387,I'd rather carry my vaccine card everywhere than a mask!
4388,No difference than carrying an ID.
4389,I haven't had any such issue with my asthma/allergies.
4390,"Are you using disposable masks (and actually disposing them after reasonable amount of wearing time), or using a cloth or reused mask?"
4391,Kids need to be allowed to get vaccinated asap.
4392,These are not normal times.
4393,The vaccine is safe.
4394,Waiting until September (AFTER school starts) is ridiculous.
4395,Even waiting another month is ridiculous.
4396,I wish parents would demand it.
4397,I agree.
4398,This post made me sad.
4399,The inequality is so real.
4400,Yes a little .
4401,Just keep in mind it will probably be a good month before mask usage goes under 20% for a decent amount or still going to be doing it.
4402,But it’s over and the efficacy of masks it’s just going to diminish even more not to mention most people are wearing cloth ones that I already have a little one but the only benefit to that was was that a good portion was wearing them without that cloth masks are even more useless than they were.
4403,"so why aren't you doing it either way then, clearly you don't think it will kill you"
4404,&gt;They had good guidance before and they generally do but now in this instance they don't.
4405,In your uneducated opinion.
4406,"&gt;Smart people use critical thinking skills and change their minds and change positions based on new information, right?"
4407,"Yes, thanks for the quick summary of how the CDC works."
4408,I hope you don't mean yourself.
4409,"What exactly is your education in that makes your opinion more reliable than the entire CDC, with all of the people with educations in fields related to the virus and the pandemic?"
4410,I work in retail or have in the last year because of Covid.
4411,Retail sucks but I would hope everybody shows everyone respect.
4412,I also feel like a lot of retail people just like to complain.
4413,I’m guilty of it myself.
4414,This year has been a time where retail has been given a little bit more of a voice.
4415,I’m sure some have more of a right to complain than others depending on what’s going on in their own life and just where they are located geographically.
4416,I’m sure that contributes to how much more danger they are in but I just feel like a lot of people I have overblown Covid and a lot of people have equally under blown it if that’s even a phrase.
4417,They are perfectly healthy people who claim they haven’t even been outside in the last year which is blows my mind.
4418,I could kind of understand it if they had certain ailments that would make them a higher risk group.
4419,I think some just have a little idea on how to put things in perspective.
4420,Similar to the guy above who said I’m fucking done without thinking of children and those who physically can’t get the vaccine
4421,I have myleofibrosis.
4422,"I got the moderna vaccine, how worried should I be about COVID compared to someone without mf?"
4423,The big difference there is that we already have flu vaccines that are safe and recommended for children as young as 6 months old.
4424,Found the anti-masker.
4425,Take your pills.
4426,Wow!
4427,That makes zero sense.
4428,Isn’t not using it the waste?
4429,Like thought it needed to be kept cold &amp; used ASAP?
4430,That &amp; seems like people can pretty much go and get it anywhere now.
4431,Don't YOU get it?
4432,Just because it might or might not reach the vulnerable one day there is no need to JUST RIGHT NOW endanger these people intentionally.
4433,"If you're pregnant, too young etc., you can't vaccinate."
4434,do YOU get that it's NOT PERMANENT?
4435,They have an incessant need to be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian.
4436,There is no other reason for it.
4437,"Mainstream consensus suggests it, so they instinctively oppose it."
4438,That’s not to say that there isn’t some personal and societal benefit to going against the grain every once in a while.
4439,Take a look at the miraculous research taking place with psychedelics right now.
4440,"If not for people on the fringes of society trying to normalize its use for years and years, it never would have creeped into the mainstream consciousness like it currently is."
4441,In that case the contrarians saw a benefit (whether that be personal or societal) and kept at it until the rest of society started to see the benefit too.
4442,"Unfortunately, these people are not that."
4443,These people don’t give a shit about doing things that help them grow personally or help other people.
4444,They care about opposing everything suggested to them at all costs.
4445,They don't do the lottery to advertise the vaccines.
4446,"They do it so that people who otherwise would not have gotten the vaccine will get the vaccine, because they see the chance of getting rich."
4447,It's like promising your child a loli if it eats his vegetables.
4448,It's an incentive to make them do something
4449,Are they not advertising the lottery?
4450,Pretty sure that would make it cost of lottery+advertising
4451,I'm on the same boat like you guys.
4452,"For once in few years, I admitted that I'm a bit petrified of having shots despite I managed."
4453,"Even during pandemic, I'm going down with two choices with tough decisions: taking a vaccine for the sake of it or wearing a mask till the virus ease off as months ahead."
4454,[deleted]
4455,[removed]
4456,"That's not skeptical, that's just their avarice overpowering their ignorance."
4457,No.
4458,Would long COVID still be a worry if I’m unlucky enough to get sick?
4459,Genuinely concerned; this is one of the reasons why I still plan on taking full precautions even after I’m fully vaccinated.

4466,I've done my grocery shopping at night for the past year because there are so few people around.
4467,It's not like the virus is some nocturnal predator that only spreads in the dark.
4468,I don't think that's correct though.
4469,"Anecdotal of course, but I know people who've been vaccinated and still died."
4470,"Granted, my country is in shambles right now cause of the sheer number of people who've got it but I'm not sure why the CDC is so quick to ask people to drop masks."
4471,The odds are really low but I think its a little misleading of bodies like the CDC to tell people that its completely safe.
4472,"I don't understand, don't medical professionals talk to each other across countries?"
4473,"For us, it has always been told that the vaccine isn't a complete safeguard and we do need to take precautions."

4475,They know that their efficacy will not hold up so what’s the point.
4476,They were already very low considering most people are wearing cloth masks

4489,I’m sorry but the masks don’t do as much as people make them out to you.
4490,Cloth masks have what a 5% efficacy?
4491,The nation just hit 10% Total cases.
4492,I wore a mask the entire time I believe that they do some good.
4493,But they’re just not going to stick around when millions of people are being vaccinated each month.
4494,Those people are going to start wearing them as well.
4495,The three or 4% protection that everyone wearing a mask had was probably nice and add it up but it means nothing now.
4496,It probably didn’t mean as much back then either.

4511,"The outbreaks in August and February were both in South Auckland, the most densely populated urban area in the country."

4532,It's just the courteous thing to do.
4533,It drives me nuts when people come in to work sick.
4534,At least if they throw their mask on it seems like they kind of give a shit if they get me sick.
4535,The vaccination rate in Canada has been very rapid but very recent.
4536,"A few weeks after the majority are vaccinated cases will fall dramatically, so that is happening over the next 2-3 weeks."
4537,"Canada is about 1 month behind the US in terms of when most of this vaccine was distributed, but in the last few weeks has been getting first doses out at a much higher rate."
4538,The US is still WAY ahead in second doses / fully vaccinated %.
4539,You miss the fact that people weren’t being vaccinated last summer with general availability of a vaccine now.
4540,Why are you offended that I pointed out a fact?
4541,We have fewer Evangelicals.
4542,"Trust me, they are just as unwilling to be vaccinated as American Evangelicals, there is just fewer of them."
4543,The US has about 48% at one dose and 37% at two doses https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
4544,"Every 60 seconds, a minute passes."

4566,"""We had to move away from the normal level of scientific certainty and say well, on balance of evidence, we know this has worked in China."
4567,"""In late March, to prepare the public for a rapidly changing situation, New Zealand introduced a new four-stage alert system."

4600,Unless you would rather they just ignore any problems going forward?

4631,"The 16 days of ""ICU Deliriums"" (non-stop nightmares caused by the heavy-sedatives).. was an awesomely nightmarish thing I hope I never have to experience again."

4633,Do you have more evidence of China delaying to prioritize themselves?
4634,Oh my gosh but I want one so bad ironically
4635,"""Died"" should not be your only metric."
4636,There have been cases of lung damage and other organ damage that may be permanent.
4637,There is also a kids variant sweeping though the midwest that is much easier for kids to spread.

4657,With no masks flu would dominate Covid in children... that’s the point.
4658,Covid is more contagious than flu but flu is more deadly for kids.
4659,We will not be wearing masks and distancing until the end of time.
4660,In fact I’d bet by fall it’s all but back to normal.

4665,Proper use of power.
4666,"Safe schools, means mandatory vaccines."
4667,I see it this way: it's a feeling.
4668,I have zero expertise in the matter so I really shouldn't make my stance based off a feeling.
4669,I've trusted the CDC and others who have spent countless hours becoming experts in their field.
4670,"They said wear a mask, so I did."
4671,"They said get vaccinated, so I did."
4672,"Now they're saying I don't have to wear a mask, so I won't (unless the establishment requires me to)."
4673,The difference is people who are expected to know about this stuff are saying one thing while the public/nurses are saying the opposite.
4674,I’ll trust the experts
4675,And they were going to be safe in a month-6weeks when everything is normal anyway?

4713,This doesn't even make sense.
4714,Did you learn what novel means in this context and think that makes you sound smart?
4715,"Nothing will completely stop it at this point, that's not what I'm arguing for."
4716,"But, studies show that it does, in fact, reduce the chance of infection quite a bit."
4717,"&gt;Results showed that following the second dose of vaccine (the recommended number of doses), risk of infection was reduced by 90 percent two or more weeks after vaccination."
4718,"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html

We still have uncontrolled community spread in many areas."
4719,"Our new cases per day, and new deaths per day, are basically where they were last fall before the big surge that started in October."
4720,My opinion/argument is that we should wait for lower spread and more vaccinations before the CDC releases guidance that renders it impossible for businesses and local governments to impose restrictions as they see fit.
4721,[removed]
4722,That is correct.
4723,[removed]
4724,They can require it.
4725,There is nothing in the law against it.
4726,I wouldn’t worry about a vaccine resistant variant at this point.
4727,"That’s speculation, kind of like worrying about getting struck by lightening."
4728,The vaccines work on all variants and there is no scientific reason to believe otherwise.

4734,Pretty cool to see all this.
4735,Still feels too weird to not wear a mask in public but cannot wait to go back to normal
4736,A small percentage go to the ICU in the first place with covid....few to no vaccinated people go to the ICU.
4737,Currently almost 40% of the country is fully vaccinated including 70% of seniors who take up most of those beds....so yeah I don't think that's going to happen...
4738,You don’t have to stop wearing your mask.
4739,It’s just for the people that have already been vaccinated.
4740,The cdc has stated that masks aren’t needed anymore.
4741,Thanks for correction.
4742,I honestly thought it was a month.
4743,Felt like longer since the restrictions opened up.

4753,Yep this is Animal Farm Corporate Level.
4754,"NJ, CA, and MA looking mad weird lately"
4755,"Yeah for the under 18 crowd, COVID is actually “just the flu.” The IFR of the flu and COVID for them is about the same."
4756,The opportunity costs of keeping restrictions until kids are eligible to get vaccinated are far too high.
4757,That's great that you support wearing masks annually during the flu season.
4758,&gt;But the thread under which you are responding wasn't about everything wrong with how we handle flu.
4759,It was about how lifting mask mandates now because adults are safe is bullshit.
4760,We have so much immunity within the population from vaccines and natural immunity.
4761,"Cases seem to be trending downward, I don't see why we need to continue to make people wear masks."
4762,It's time to just let people decide what they want to do.
4763,You'll get there eventually too.
4764,"At some point, you'll decide that wearing a mask isn't really worth it, even if you may potentially expose people to some deadly disease."
4765,Yea I don't belive it for a second.
4766,"Been all over there many times, mask wearing is probably between 60-70% at most."
4767,"I wore the best fitting KN95 mask I could find to work all day, and still got COVID from a coworker who was hacking up a storm."
4768,"Masks can only do so much to protect the wearer, and most people don’t have the opportunity to get a property fit-tested KN95/N95 mask."
4769,I was like that before years of shots.
4770,Then was manageable.
4771,Then last year wow allergies so much more under control than I can ever remember them being.
4772,I can breath through my nose and everything.
4773,"&gt; I'm annoyed that the people, who said that they will never get vaccinated, the same people, that didn't care about restrictions and met with other people in summer, now all run to the docs for vaccines, because they want them only to meet as many people as possible asap."
4774,I'm convinced it's the same people who were hoarding the toilet paper.

4781,"If you feel the need to clarify this after making a guideline, you probably made a bad guideline."
4782,And it probably was because of something other than science.
4783,"But this is why the ""I LiSTEn tO SciEnCe"" meme has always made me cringe."
4784,"Science without proper social context and appropriate, benifical application is useless."
4785,"One could easily look around at the disolving of trust the last four years have engendered, or the hostile, literally *militant* reaction anti-vaxxers and Covid Denialists - did we forget white supremacists tried to kidnap the Governor of Michgan over restrictions - and say ""Even if the data says those who are vaccinated will be safe removing their masks indoors, given the number of unvaccinated people and the pressure of anti-vaxxers,  it might be safer to keep mandates in place."""
4786,"Science isn't some magical, apolitical monolith."
4787,You can not remove science from subjective circumstances or the political sphere we are in.
4788,"And, assuming we take the CDC in good faith and trust that this is a 'strictly scientific' decision, then it is a foolish, dangerous decision."
4789,"'Objectivity' is ultimately an excuse and 'out' for people to avoid grappling with messy realities, and leaves those who don't have the luxury or comfort to be 'above it all' in peril."
4790,"The CDC and the Federal Government is choosing to wash their hands of all of this, leaving individuals at the mercy of their circumstances, and makes the distater that has been our messy, ununified COVID efforts even more shattered."
4791,New Jersey would like a word with you.

4798,I’d love to see the border opened by summer.
4799,"Vaccines will likely protect against the Indian variant, but the Indian variant is far more transmissible than the UK variant."
4800,Thus it will become the new dominant variant.
4801,"It could cause a lot of damage in unvaccinated communities, and vaccinated communities, since a huge spike in cases (especially if vaccine uptake is low and all restrictions are dropped, meaning high circulation of COVID) will still mean a lot of double vaccinated people in hospital."
4802,Still doesn't escape vaccines.
4803,The story title says Kroger’s in MI.
4804,Exactly.
4805,"Maybe it won't convince many, but even if only a few percentage of people who are doubting can be convinced, we might actually hit herd immunity..."
4806,If you didn’t get your shot until 5/15 (1 month after CA opened it to everyone) then even if you got the J&amp;J you still won’t be considered fully vaxxed until 5/29.
4807,If you got an mRNA shot it will be closer to June 15th (as long as you get your 2nd shot on time).
4808,What does science say about the risks for Covid for small children?
4809,N95’s protect the wearer.

4813,I'm curious if the slow start to vaccinations in Canada worked in our favour?
4814,"Making the vaccine seem more coveted back in like Feb/March than it did in the US, making more peopl want to get it."
4815,The vaccine actually does seem to stop you from spreading it.
4816,"The CDC was overly cautious until studies had been complete, but that is in fact why they said those who are vaccinated don't need to mask, the odds that they will spread COVID-19 are minimal."
4817,"Also, some people, through no fault of their own, legitimately can't get the vaccine."
4818,"Lastly, unless you tested positive when asymptomatic, you didn't have COVID."
4819,"I know someone who was asymptomatic who tested positive, and I know some who had the disease and were nastily sick for a week."
4820,"It isn't fun, even if you avoid a hospital stay."
4821,"So it works for vaccine, and not just for ppl that had recovered from COVID?"
4822,I am so sorry to hear that you are immunocompromised.
4823,My advice would be to get some N95 masks.
4824,My local Home Depot has supply of them now in various types.
4825,They are not as scarce as they used to be.
4826,"And unless we hard Lockdown, they never will be completely safe from covid, we didn't and never were going to do that so they have another risk they must consider."
4827,We aren't masking forever to protect the immune compromised.

4835,I used to get a cold once every few years.
4836,Wearing a mask any time I go into public to avoid a one every few years illness is not a good trade off in my opinion.
4837,I’d rather just live my life.
4838,Masks have to come off for people to start behaving normally.

4919,That's interesting.
4920,I follow your logic.
4921,"In practice, any level of immunity (even 10%) begins to break the chain of transmission."
4922,"Of course, it's not linear."
4923,10% immunity confers little herd immunity and 50% confers a lot more than 5 times that.
4924,Herd immunity really kicks in once you get past 50% of the population and rises sharply thereafter.
4925,The flu vaccine has 50% efficacy and does a good job in depressing transmission.
4926,I appreciate that SARS-Cov2 is more infectious than flu but in countries like the UK the immunity rate is above 50%.
4927,Thanks!
4928,"Also just Google ""covid vaccine overdose"" and saw some articles."
4929,Good to see that it seems to be harmless when it happens
4930,Really?
4931,I don't live in the US and here mask mandates where taken quite seriously by the government so I havn't seen any tantrums but every time I go to a bigger store or god forbid the mall I see so many peopke refusing to wear the mask properly.
4932,"A teenager who was offered a mask said he would pull his tshirt up which he, of course, only did for a couple minutes."
4933,"A middle-aged woman blatently wearing her mask as an elbow pad (we don't really have medical exemptions here, only kids and pregnant people are allowed to wear cloth masks instead of n95 ones, toddlers are fully exempt)."
4934,"A muslim girl loosely holding a mask in front of her veiled face (remember n95 mandate, I don't think those work an inch off of your face)."
4935,"An older man had folded his mask so that it basically looked like an umbrella for his nose (on first glance it looked normal though since it actually extended past the lips, it just wasn't flush with his face)."
4936,I'm really surprised you havn't experienced anythink like that.

4969,"To me, it seems a simple marketing and trial cost saving move, where the other three targeted efficacy and longer lasting immunity, but could have stopped at the first shot with similar results."
4970,So you’re getting the vaccine then?
4971,Wow...my Kroger was one of the few places that didn’t do much to encourage mask use from the start.
4972,China basically prevented it if you look at their case counts..
4973,The Airline Pilot who brought it in asked the Government if they could give him a reduced quarantine period of 10 days instead of 14.
4974,They agreed.
4975,"The Pilot then visited several places (including a brothel or similar), and tested positive only after his 10 day quarantine, but by then it was too late."
4976,It really is that simple.

4983,Still waiting for our 1st doses outside of Toronto.
4984,&gt;Unfortunately as I am not a permanent resident here I can’t get them though.
4985,That really sucks.
4986,"In Germany, you just need to have an actual address and then you're good to go (i.e."
4987,all residents can get vaccinated).
4988,"To be fair, social distancing likely had a huge effect on you not getting sick."
4989,You probably aren't going to get the flu from going to a grocery store with or without a mask.
4990,"Keep in mind, you aren't likely to get COVID from a  grocery store, and COVID is many times more infectious than the flu."
4991,"You are more likely to get a cold or the flu from your child (daycare), from extended contact at work, or from social gatherings."
4992,"People didn't get sick this year because they worked from home, didn't go to social gatherings, and many didn't send their children to school or daycare."
4993,And the last year’s shitshow hasn’t already?
4994,&gt;Remember in the beginning when they said the average joe didn't need a mask?
4995,The science didn't support that.
4996,They made that call because they were worried about supply.
4997,"Yes, they were worried about supply, considering it's pretty damn important for medical professionals to have steady access to masks, do you disagree?"
4998,They also were not immediately aware of how likely asymptomatic transmission was.
4999,"As the evidence accumulated, their recommendations changed."
5000,This seems completely reasonable to me.
5001,"The science today might not have support their recommendations at the beginning, but science evolves as we learn more."
5002,"Yes, there's public policy on top of science, again, like the idea that if the medical professionals who are taking care of COVID patients don't have access to masks, than we're all fucked."
5003,I was working in a COVID unit for a year.
5004,"Well, except for the couple weeks that I was out sick, from COVID, probably in part because I didn't have a proper mask because the states supply ran out and they couldn't get us any more."
5005,"Like I said, I'm sure the CDC is fully aware of the flaws of the ""honor system,"" and despite that, felt comfortable enough to make this recommendation."
5006,"So all the people who have criticized conservatives who refuse to accept to recommendations of experts this whole time, who are now refusing to agree with the CDC are just hypocrites in my eyes."
5007,"If you want to continue wearing a mask because you enjoy strangers not seeing your face, you find that it helps with allergies, or whatever other reason you might have, than great, keep wearing it."
5008,"I'm going to continue listening to the experts, and follow their recommendations, which at the moment is that I no longer need to wear a mask in most situations."

5196,We know the group most likely to have flu-like symptoms from the vaccine are young people who are among the least likely to have severe covid cases.
5197,"Personally my vaccine side effects were pretty similar or milder compared to the discomfort from covid, although both were fortunately very mild."
5198,There is some anecdotal chatter that those who had covid before the vaccine have stronger reactions on the first vaccine dose and then milder reactions on the second.
5199,I wouldn't be surprised if any boosters are needed the side-effects are not as common on future doses.
5200,"Makes no sense, the rate of vaccination has no correlation with case counts."
5201,"There is many reasons affecting rate of vaccination, including supply of vaccines, needles, refrigerators, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, hesitancy of population, etc... You want your population to be vaccinate against future variants, regardless of current case count."
5202,"You have many nations with near flat/negligible vaccination rates with rising case count, like Taiwan or Japan, and you have high vaccination rates and relatively high case counts liked United States."
5203,Make sure you do the same thing for every single contagious disease.
5204,"Make people carry around a flu passport, a herpes passport, an AIDS passport, ECT."
5205,"&gt;Maybe you won’t spread it but it’s creating an environment that opens the door to unvaccinated people spreading it to them

But again, it's not vaccinated people's responsibility to make sure unvaccinated people follow the rules."
5206,It's not their fault and not their responsibility if a bunch of shitty people want to be shitty.
5207,"Vaccinated people did their jobs by getting the vaccine and following the other COVID guidelines for the last year, it's not their job to be role models to shitty people who likely won't follow their lead anyway."
5208,It's akin to punishing an entire classroom because there are 3 trouble makers who won't follow the rules in the class.
5209,What exactly is this gold standard?
5210,There are about 7 other provinces that did better than Taiwan.
5211,I feel bad for them too.
5212,I understand worry for your children - I have two young ones myself.
5213,"But I know and understand enough about this that for one, they're not at any significant risk and for two, most adults they're around are already vaccinated, so they're not going to infect anyone else."
5214,That and they've both been going to daycare for almost this entire time.
5215,The more time passes the more likely it is that COVID just skips them.
5216,They may have even been exposed already and none of us know it considering that it seems kids don't really spread it around either.
5217,"Being really worried and really concerned and outraged doesn't make you right, you know?"
5218,"You might not feel like your kids are safe, but they are."
5219,"And by keeping them isolated, you're the only one doing them any harm, not society for lifting mask mandates."
5220,"Do what IS right for you kids, not what you feel is best."
5221,Those two things might be at odds with each other.

5484,"""But what about the lying anti-vaxxers thing that the CDC obviously didn't think about!!"""
5485,as if the CDC hasn't been running focus groups and polling to support their cost/benefit analyses for months and isn't armed with significantly more data and information than Reddit is.
5486,"&gt; you cannot afford to take 
&gt; we are confident that it's safe
&gt;   as a valid answer, you want solid proof."
5487,"not only safe, but also *effective*."
5488,I’m pretty sure this sounds great to say on a survey…as young person heads out for the night.
5489,"The ones that say that are right, I wish they would stay in lockdown forever away from us and if I could take their internet away even better."
5490,Can you show the study that unmasked fully vaccinated people do not spread the virus?
5491,I believe that CDC also used this data to drop the mask requirement.
5492,But I cannot find it.
5493,You've just now figured out that the US military is a bullshit organization that sucks up your tax dollars and gives nothing back?
5494,"Happy birthday yesterday, I guess."
5495,"But then, why are you blaming ""Asian countries"" for their slow vaccinations when it's your own military that made the decision."
5496,"Tone down the entitlement and racism, it just makes you sound ridiculously butthurt."
5497,We're at 48% of the population (60% of adults) with at least one dose.
5498,"And despite what seemingly everyone on this sub would have you believe, having only one dose is still incredibly effective at preventing infection."
5499,"Add to that some unknown number of unvaccinated people who have previously had infection, and we're a lot closer to 70% with some level of immunity than it seems."
5500,No thanks.
5501,Threshold for everything
5502,Same.
5503,No... it's a check mark.
5504,"I mean, it's a vaccine as a check mark."
5505,Not hard to understand.
5506,What a surprise that your morals are AGAIN compromised for a chance at some money.
5507,Vaccines cause autism!...
5508,Unless you'll give me money to take it...
5509,Stimulus checks are socialism!...
5510,"Unless you're giving one to me...

People are so ignorant it makes me disappointed in this country."
5511,Where they healthy to begin with?
5512,I know I’m being disingenuous.
5513,"It’s just the people that I see worrying about supposedly long term side effects cuz “health” , weren’t healthy at all to begin with."
5514,&gt; I will never understand why people are such babies about masks.
5515,"Misinformation campaigns designed to get people to take as few precautions as possible, with the goal of killing Americans."
5516,It's not hard to guess which countries might be interested in this tactic.
5517,"Yes, we are!"
5518,US gov picks up the tab.
5519,I would be totally fine with that.
5520,The places that do this would be at their cleanest for you and others who want that safety.
5521,And it worked well before!
5522,I'm an Ohioan.
5523,I was vaccinated in December.
5524,I still have a chance to win.
5525,"But that doesn't really matter to me, I love being vaccinated for many reasons beyond money."
5526,I like this idea to give incentive to hesitant or procrastinating people so my unborn child has a better chance of not getting covid.
5527,(Here's hoping he'll have antibodies from my vaccine!)
5528,"Either way, it's win win."
5529,(But a million bucks wouldn't hurt!)

5533,Well this country (usa) is a shit hole with a bunch of idiots in it.
5534,There is for sure going to be some delay between stuff being lifted and people removing masks.
5535,"My state is removing things tomorrow but when I go shopping Ill have a mask with me because I dont know whos going to require it and who wont, so for now might just be easier to throw it on to not upset employees."
5536,Masks have been so hard with traveling and speaking to people with accents.
5537,It just muffles everyone voice so much that communication can be really difficult and I feel terrible when I don’t understand someone who speaks perfectly fine English.
5538,dunno about you but I only trust the vaccine heroes at this point.
5539,"the ""experts"" get zero relevance."
5540,And make no mistake : if it was for them we'd still be at the window waiting for herd immunity and watching it (from the window) for years to come or never come.
5541,ONLY because of the vaccines heroes we have hopes.

5568,I’m telling you that I have always felt we should keep masks until herd immunity drives cases down to negligible or when kids can get vaccinated.

5597,We engage in risky behavior like driving cars all the time.
5598,We eat Big Macs even though it puts lots of us in early graves.
5599,"It's unfortunate that Covid precautions and masking became such a politically divisive issue, because it stopped some people from taking appropriate precautions at the beginning and now at the end it's stopping other people from realizing it's almost over."

5793,Exactly this is why I say the CDC rushed this because we still need to be wearing masks to protect people like you which is why I will continue masking for a while.
5794,you do realize that since 2 days ago I couldn't care less if you wear a mask or not?
5795,"Seriously it makes no difference to me because I am fully vaccinated with the Pfizer miracle and I don't get it and I don't give it

deal with it and if you don't then it's up to you."
5796,no difference to me .
5797,none whatsoever

5799,"So if we extrapolate your thoughts out on being a burden on the public, we should outlaw alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, etc."
5800,"Again, that's too slippery of a slope and I can't go there."
5801,Liberty dies not with a grand feature but a small nibble here and there.
5802,Much like a frog if you slowly turn up the heat in a pan they don't realize they are being cooked.
5803,Why?
5804,"Weekend numbers or not, they hadn't reported 0 deaths over the weekend in months."
5805,Nice try.

5818,And I’d love to be on flights with zero kids.
5819,Let’s get this rolling.
5820,"It's not just like a fear of death, it's about spreading the virus."
5821,We'd like to see relatives this summer and we have neighbors that we see at the playground and there are young babies in their families.
5822,"We have felt safe enough to socialize outdoors on and off but once masks come off, we will have to find new ways to navigate the risks."
5823,Which will probably just mean isolation which is just so sad.
5824,the big problem is how much of a hazard those people are creating for others who genuinely can't get the vaccine because of their underlying conditions.
5825,"people who *can* be vaccinated, safely, *should* be vaccinated."
5826,It’s in the 20-25% range in most surveys.
5827,"Not much, but also not insignificant right now when it should speed up the effect of the vaccine rollout."
5828,[deleted]
5829,[removed]
5830,"Were you simply meaning to be pedantic or were you refuting my main point, which was:

&gt; This is not going to be the disaster people are predicting."

5832,Happily.
5833,"""This is so confusing!"
5834,I don't understand this policy.
5835,"Culturally it makes no sense!"""
5836,"--people on this subreddit, probably."
5837,Then they should’ve done it in June once 12-15 can get their second dose.
5838,"People who are unvaccinated, according to the cdc, shouldn’t go unmasked because they are at risk of catching Covid...what if those people do not care about the risk?"
5839,It’s not the businesses or even the governments job job to decide whether or not someone is okay with the risk of getting the virus.
5840,We are reaching the point where basically most people who want the vaccine have the opportunity to get it and it’s their decision.
5841,Still averaging 600/deaths a day.
5842,Since early April it’s been hovering around 6-700 a day after what had been a rapid decline.
5843,I suspect the decline will continue to be slow as the re-opening continues and people ditch precautions and vaccinations slow.
5844,[removed]
5845,I'm delusional and just have health anxiety?
5846,Did you even read my comment or are you just here to be a judgemental abusive asshole?
5847,"No, but we did have quite a dip."
5848,"I think the summer will be fine too, but I half expect the no vax crowd to get decently smacked up come winter when even masks had a hard time containing it."
5849,"Hopefully enough people get their shit together and get vaccinated this summer so that doesn't happen, but I won't be holding my breath."
5850,I’m fully vaccinated so yes definitely 😐
5851,Rednecks love them some lottery.
5852,These vaccines have been exceptionally more effective than I even imagined.
5853,"Seems like a year ago we were hoping to have vaccines that were 50-60% effective and Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, and AZ just blew by those numbers and left them in the dust."

5863,It can take a minute.
5864,The two lines on the graph are the different groups in the trial.
5865,The upper line is the placebo group.
5866,They didn't get the vaccine during the trial.
5867,The line that stays flat is the group of people who got the vaccine.
5868,The lines are the same for the first 10-12 days.
5869,"After that, they are really different, as the people who got the vaccine stopped getting sick, but the people who didn't kept getting sick."
5870,Its mutant level is over 9000!
5871,[removed]
5872,"In my opinion, I think going back to (mostly) normal in \~1 month is reasonable."
5873,"I say mostly as I still think it would be reasonable to require a mask in locations where risk would be especially high, such as where you're more likely to run into someone immunocompromised (i.e."
5874,"a hospital), people who cannot be vaccinated (i.e."
5875,"a daycare with children &lt;12 years old), or crowded locations that easily allow disease to spread (i.e."
5876,an airport).
5877,"But, for the vast majority of day-to-day interactions once people have had a meaningful chance to be fully immunized I think it's fair to say it's now their problem\*."
5878,"&amp;#x200B;

\*as long as we don't see any warning signs that them getting sick will burden healthcare facilities"
5879,If every state did this I feel like the whole country would be vaccinated by Friday
5880,They are using a non-exact method of tracking deaths that is certainly delayed and undercounting.
5881,"However if you use the same exact flawed method on different days and see a downward trend, the numbers aren’t exact deaths but you can safely say that deaths are going down."
5882,"If using this flawed method gives you zero deaths for the first time in a long time, it is newsworthy."

5884,He's starting to show cracks.

5886,&gt;I hated the smoking laws (I don't even smoke and I don't like smoking and I complain about it all the time) I believe it infringes on personal rights.
5887,Smoking laws meaning inside restaurants and whatnot?
5888,Your rights end once they affect others.
5889,Smoking can cause cancer for the non-smokers nearby.
5890,"Your increased chances of cancer (or injury from a lack of seatbelt or helmet) can also be a burden on public services, also affecting others."
5891,"I understand your thoughts on this, but you're looking at it the wrong way."
5892,You are affecting others by potentially spreading the virus more being unvaccinated and by potentially being an increased burden for public services.
5893,It's also not a new concept.

5895,Parts of OC are great.
5896,"Little Saigon, for example."
5897,"You were at 90% when you got the second shot and when you were around those people, you were almost fully vaccinated."
5898,"In addition, the precautions you took would have given you considerable protection even without any vaccination."
5899,That’s all the reassurance you need.
5900,The rest is your anxiety.
5901,"When the intrusive thoughts hit you about having Covid-19 from that apartment viewing, relabel them as OCD and focus on something else."
5902,"&gt;Pretty sure the fed govt didnt lift any mandates

Did I say the Federal goverment lift mandates?"
5903,Where did I say that?
5904,How do you know which government I was talking about?
5905,I can't speak for other places.
5906,"Well, I can speak for where I live now and yes indeed, there are differences."
5907,"There's a lot of good &amp; bad wherever you go, but the the flavor &amp; specifics of those tend to be local."
5908,Mad isn’t it?
5909,"They’re not spreading misinformation about a vaccine, just expressing their choice not to get one."
5910,If medical procedures are not a matter of personal choice then what is?
5911,People are a lot less different between places than you would believe.
5912,Selfishness and greed are core human traits you’ll find just about everywhere.

5914,"I have no idea what you're trying to say, what's bullshit our overall numbers should be higher, or zero on a Sunday is bullshit since a lot of cities don't report on Sundays?"
5915,"Either way, the case numbers and deaths are going down and trending down"
5916,Plenty of states had done that.
5917,Didn't really seem to have meaningful impacts on vaccination rates.
5918,99% of those hospitalized will be unvaccinated.
5919,"If they're ""rising as much as they're falling"" that means they're flat, which is exactly what I said."
5920,"Also, there's no ""huge spike"" in March."
5921,as you know the fully vaccinated don't care about you idiots.
5922,Seriously you idiots make no difference to the fully vaccinated (like me).
5923,But if you get sick then I'd feel bad for you.
5924,that said I personally don't care of what you do because I am fully vaccinated with the Pfizer miracle
5925,Objective and pessimistic aren't the same thing.

5927,"As of this morning, Austin has officially adopted the CDC guidance, ending the mask mandate for the vaccinated."
5928,you're feeling the chills.
5929,sounds very normal.

5931,"no hajib, no service."

5934,Summer is basically here.
5935,"If you're concerned about your children, self isolate."
5936,That's going to protect them better than masks on other people.
5937,Deaths due to COVID in children is less than due to car accidents and we don't disrupt our lives over those deaths.
5938,"When the school year starts back up, maybe we can have a different discussion if vaccines are still unavilable, but I anticipate that we will be in a much better place with much lower case numbers and higher vaccination rates."
5939,So you're saying she was wrong :)
5940,I guess I'm just bad at reading graphs :P I found that and didn't understand it.
5941,But thank you for clarifying
5942,"Yes, sorry, was talking about WV."
5943,But Ohio's lottery is sweet!
5944,Doubt they'll do anything in California beyond the free snacks we get from private businesses.
5945,"That said, I donated blood once for a free hat."
5946,My grocery store is already dead the first hour.
5947,Yeah that’s what I thought from what I read it seems that after day 7 the increase in antibodies is still there but it is minimal
5948,It is a possibility if vaccination rates are still low and people get reckless.
5949,I live to serve.
5950,Not putting a mask can cause health problem to others.
5951,But keep wearing a mask as a precaution won’t cause anyone heath problem.
5952,"policy takes time to write

as a matter of fact when you've decided on a policy you've only done 10% of the work"

5968,So looking at the UK's figures on Worldometers and what really hammers home how freaking amazing the vaccines are is the death totals.
5969,"They've done an excellent job at getting shots for the older folks, and the numbers show what happens when you do:

1.9k cases 2 days ago, 4 deaths

1.9k cases yesterday, 5 deaths"
5970,"Better to have more with one dose than few with two doses

I would expect alot of those timelines to shift and be moved up since we now have tons of vaccines coming in"
5971,My stepdad has GB and got vaccinated by his doctors urging.
5972,The CDC website recommends it so it’s frustrating when people’s doctors give conflicting answers
5973,"Okay then, get vaccinated because other people's lives depend on it."
5974,"15% of the entire population is still a lot of people, about 45 million."
5975,"IMO that sounds about right for the number of people that will refuse a vaccine for themselves and their dependents no matter what, let's not forget that anti-vax attitudes are still on the fringe of society thankfully."
5976,"The decline indeath rate has dropped much slower than I expected when we started vaccinating the elderly in Jan-Feb. That said, the decline has really started accelerating in May."
5977,The 7 day average has dropped from 707 on 5/4 to 545 today.
5978,Since we're also seeing a significant decline in cases I don't see much reason to expect it won't keep on declining down to 3-400 per day in June.
5979,"Not just another covid pandemic, but *any* pandemic."

5981,"

5982,Seems like you've already got a solution!
5983,"What I'm suggesting is an easing up of distancing/masking, for it to still happen only during special hours in essential businesses."
5984,"That's a minimal change to other people's lives if at all, while ensuring a safer environment for the people who are still waiting for to get vaccinated, to be autonomous and not have to ask other people for favors."

6004,Wellllll the masks don’t work thing was really early in the pandemic when we pretty much knew jack shit about the virus.
6005,Thanks I wasn’t aware of this.
6006,"If you just gave everyone something like $500-$1,000 to get it, everyone would be getting it."

6022,They'd also start seeing a boost in shots if they gave everyone $500 after getting fully vaccinated.
6023,Did this seriously just say that we would hit *85%?!
6024,"*

They need to factor in social science with these models."
6025,Because at least then they’d be accounting for the antivaxxer.
6026,The 'Texas lifting mask mandate' surge was practically reported as an impending apocalypse.
6027,I never said that there aren't covid deaths.
6028,But at the end of the day the reporting of deaths per category is totally inaccurate based off of their own admission that they are labeling deaths in ways they never have before that's all.
6029,"Even though I think COVID can be serious for some people, vaccine passports are not the way to go."
6030,"That's not beign a conspiracy theorist, that's someone who values freedom over fear-mongering for a virus that's mostly a risk to the elderly and obese."
6031,Depends on where in TX.
6032,Most people wore masks in corporate owned stores that had posted mask required signs.
6033,But in lots of more rural areas locally owned businesses never required masks and few people wore them in those businesses at any point in the pandemic.
6034,Kids hardly ever wore them in my part of TX.
6035,"Not in the city, suburbs, or small towns."
6036,And they were hardly ever worn outdoors by anybody in crowd situations.
6037,Restaurants were mostly at their normal capacity and people didn't wear masks into them.
6038,Every time we got curbside pickup we watched steady streams of unmasked customers going in and out of the buildings.
6039,"Employees had masks, but customers didn't."
6040,"And when there were windows to see in through, nobody was sitting at tables in masks."
6041,So restaurants were mainly mask free zones.
6042,In the small towns churches held in-person mask optional services and events like bazaars and holiday performances.
6043,"We had parades, town fairs, holiday attractions like walk through light displays."
6044,Large festivals and fundraising concerts.
6045,"Outdoors is safer, but plenty of mask optional events with people in close proximity happened on a regular basis."
6046,"Over this past winter indoor performances at restaurants, coffee shops, and bars happened."
6047,"The state mandates may have been lifted in March, but many counties never enforced them."
6048,It just gave corporate owned stores a chance to start phasing from masks required to masks recommended signs.
6049,"&gt;Again, I understand the logic of it all."
6050,It is defying my personal logic that masking doesn’t seem to matter right now (in terms of overall populations/numbers).
6051,It's all just so exhausting.
6052,People had to fight so much to get mandates they just can't even accept that any mask effectiveness has been negligible.
6053,"Texas lifts mandate and everyone says ""you'll be sorry"" then when you aren't sorry they say ""Oh well businesses kept the mandates"" and just refuse to even entertain the idea that masks are pretty ineffective against covid."
6054,The person you're replying to claims 99% adoption yet I doubt at any point they have wondered why they didn't just beat covid pre-vaccine with such a high compliance.
6055,In 3-6 weeks these people won't be willing to admit they were wrong if cases continue to plummet.
6056,"It'll either be silence or ""people kept wearing masks and that's why cases didn't explode""

I'll gladly admit I was wrong if the sky really does fall but after seeing what vaccines actually do to the pandemic it's pretty obvious to me that masks were barely doing anything."
6057,I say all that as someone who bought a mask back when you literally couldn't find one online and has worn one consistently for over a year.
6058,We have actually caught up to the US in terms of percentage with first dose.
6059,I imagine alot of people's second doses in Canada will be moved up soon as well.
6060,Border should reopen within the next three months or so I'd say

6078,The CDC told me over the phone I can get the vaccine if I had Guillian-Barre but to avoid tetanus and flu shots and talk to my doctor.
6079,My doctor calls me back and says he wouldn’t get it if he were me lmao I’m so confused
6080,About time the government got something right
6081,It's all related... offices opening back up means kids MUST go back to school/daycare unless people can afford otherwise.
6082,"The concern is that we've already seen 1 variant that seemed to target and spread worse among children, so it would not surprise me at all to see more."
6083,And we know COVID is spreading rapidly in high population density countries right now.
6084,"So to me, keeping masks required in essential locations until kids can be vaccinated would have been a happy medium."
6085,"I do think adults who have been vaccinated deserve to get closer to ""normal"" life again, especially in terms of socializing/social locations that those who are more risk averse can easily avoid."
6086,"I also started going back to the gym, mask off while working out, two weeks post-Pfizer, which was early March for me."

6093,A lot of doctors practices have actually already had to start dropping the priority lists because of uncertainty with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

6100,"These products have been accelerated in development in the last year, studied for many years to an extent, AND it has been very clear from the onset that prompt development, distribution, storage, and administration of these vaccines is paramount to overcoming this worldwide pandemic."
6101,I made my original comment to provide skepticism and clear disappointed in the execution of the entire vaccine rollout.
6102,It’s things like this that add up and cumulatively cause massive harm and inability to save more lives.
6103,I should have assumed that my original comment would have automatically been downvoted to oblivion by redditors unable to properly critically appraise the processes currently in place.
6104,Lol I literally said the fed didnt lift mandates.
6105,they never had any federal mandates because we would have stood up to them.
6106,So we are pretty close in opinions just a month apart on a time-line.
6107,I don't think that's what the above meant by 50% or over 35s.

6126,Not to mention the gas/transportation costs.

6128,"It’s just not worth it, and enough companies are realizing that, so I don’t think I’ll have to."

6148,"Kids and the immunocompromised need that protection; even if we had waited for 70% for the adult population to be vaccinated to drop mask mandates, the problems with kids and the immunocompromised are still there, so what helps them?"
6149,Having high vaccination rates because the vaccines have a major effect on stopping the spread!
6150,When the much more likely scenario even for a “lab leak” theory is somebody just got oopsy infected by an actual bat specimen.
6151,I’d have no trouble believing that.
6152,And I am asking you where those excess deaths came from.

6173,You should not be in fear if you’re fully vaccinated.
6174,I am fortunate to be a patient at one of the best universities in the country for treating and researching UC and Chrons and my doctors have assured me my risk is as low as others.
6175,There has not been any significant data on UC/Chrons patients having worse outcomes getting covid nor getting infected post-vaccination.
6176,"And I almost died from my flare three years ago, so I know how serious UC can be."
6177,I highly recommend talking to your doctor and getting assurance here.

6184,I am pretty sure that they were all masked during the study.
6185,"In fact, the latest CDC recommendation requires everyone to be masked in a healthcare setting even for fully vaccinated people."
6186,I am trying to find a study that shows the transmission and spread significantly reduce for fully vaccinated people *without masks*.

6205,There is a strict protocol to taking the masks on and off and using sanitizer when doing so that the masses don’t follow.
6206,I've been completing the v-safe questionnaires post-vaccine.
6207,"On my last questionnaire, the survey asked if I got a positive pregnancy test since the vaccine, and I responded yes - I found out I'm pregnant 2 weeks after my 2nd dose of Moderna."

6253,The CDC said their advice was for the individual.
6254,It’s more like a scientifically factual statement that does not take into account human behavior.
6255,And they said the mandates are up to businesses and local leaders.
6256,Most importantly they are still saying that the unvaccinated need to mask.
6257,If you follow the logical conclusion then that means businesses will need to require masks for everyone in order to ensure the unvaccinated wear masks.
6258,Otherwise we are failing at meeting their recommendation.

6279,A lot has changed since March so I have no problem with how cautious they were at the time.
6280,"I'd rather them err on the side of caution than have to come back later and say ""oops we underestimated this virus""."
6281,Now we're in a different place with the virus since so many are vaccinated.
6282,This has always been an ever revolving situation.
6283,Your interpretation is 100% and has been confirmed in various clarifying interviews from Fauci and Wollensky.
6284,"I also think you can imply that there is indeed a higher risk to children and some immune compromised individuals, but that higher risk is an acceptable one."
6285,"Obviously the CDC would never actually say that, but that appears to be their stance."
6286,I personally see the logic and agree but also 100% sympathize with people who are or care for someone who is in that group that is now at higher (albeit still probably very small) risk.
6287,All because people don’t want to wear a mask which on an individual level isn’t a big deal.
6288,"But at a macro level, lifting mask mandates will have a huge positive effect on the economy."
6289,"It means more jobs, healthier lifestyle, better mental health and lot of other benefits that outweigh that negatives."
6290,But again!!!
6291,I know it must suck ass to be in the group that’s eating all the negative!
6292,Seems we disagree on weather it is ok for the individual to be asked to suffer temporarily for the benefit of the many.
6293,"I can not say what goes on in other countries on this topic, but for me its completely bonkers not to restrict movement during an epidemic."
6294,"&gt;If this is the worst of their symptoms, having a positive test would almost be a relief since they can build up their antibodies."
6295,I'm not sure I understand this.
6296,"If they had a fever, they have already started to make antibodies."
6297,"If the fever is over, you are through the worst of it."
6298,"Ahh yes, the Nurses, the ones that have been denying to get vaccinated in large amounts, yea, I will listen to the CDC, and Fauci, who are actual doctors, and who have degrees in Epidemiology, over nurses who wont even get vaccinated."

6303,"Keep thanking fauci though, even though you can’t articulate one thing he did except for play politics and give us contradicting, dangerous, and meaningless commands."
6304,His commentary on post-vaccination activities definitely lead to decreased vaccination adoption as well.
6305,It's very clear by now that the countries with the strictest mask mandates didn't fare better than others.

6320,So we paid taxes all through the pandemic for them to give it back to an asshole that wouldn't get the vaccine... what a world
6321,Your literally talking out of your ass god you righties are dumb.
6322,Not saying it went away but warm weather pushes people outside where the rate of infection is incredibly low.
6323,Take in to account there was an actual substantial dip in cases last summer and your statement is not as absurd as you think it is.

6370,Really terrible.
6371,This should be a top priority to all world governments to help these poor areas into basic needed goods and services.
6372,I think the CDC's viewpoint is that unvaccinated children are at very low risk of being hospitalized.
6373,"Sure we hear of severe inflammatory cases, but they're even more rare than childhood cancers."
6374,"Children are just as apt to catch covid from going back to school, mixing &amp; socializing with other unvaccinated kids."
6375,It's not like children in markets &amp; retailers are being coughed on or hugged by random strangers.
6376,"If you test negative on a rapid test, you are *much less likely* to spread the virus."
6377,The thing is we don't know for sure how many of those people got covid and if they did when did they get it?

6390,You're assuming that they can get off work during the first two hours.
6391,I'd wager that most of them will be working and most jobs won't give them paid time off to go shopping.
6392,This wasn't an issue with retired people.
6393,"And there's the immunocompromised people for who, even though they can get the vaccine, its effectiveness is likely much less and thus leave them vulnerable to any unmasked person carrying it, I guess they're also supposed to forfeit their stake in society."
6394,"Right, and I’m sure the CDC has taken this risk into account."
6395,The people who don’t care about this virus are unmasking.
6396,Target and Walmart are already dropping their mask requirements.
6397,A vaccinated person continuing to mask doesn’t change anything.
6398,Dude that's incredible.
6399,And they got Regen on there too for mild and moderate cases.
6400,I was still under the impression all they can do for you is out you on a ventilator if it's a severe case!
6401,Why the hell are ppl downvoting this?
6402,"I am expecting a rise in the number of cases, but continuing decline in hospitalization and death rates."
6403,"Even with just one shot, you’re still at much lower risk of severe disease or death."
6404,"The way I see it, all the people at highest risk from COVID should have been fully vaccinated for months now."
6405,"Middle aged people and young adults, who are at medium risk of severe disease and death, should have one shot by this point or will within the next two weeks."
6406,Children who are not eligible for the vaccine have always had naturally low risk of severe disease and death.
6407,"So basically, the US as a whole should have a flattened out level of risk from COVID."
6408,"That means that even if COVID continues to spread via children and antivaxxers who lie and take off their masks, those who are infected shouldn’t be going to the hospital, and shouldn’t be dying."
6409,"They’ll have mild cases, and have to stay home for a few days."

6415,The rolling avg is going down everywhere too.
6416,"Yeah, sorry, you get the idea."
6417,Honestly I think just further investing in medical science is the best long-term course of action after this
6418,Your are literally advocating locking people up for not masking/vaccinating.
6419,I can't even with this.
6420,"No, that’s the actual mortality rate across all infected people."
6421,"No, the mods listen to the CDC which says that transmission after vaccination is very rare, so masking is no longer necessary for vaccinated individuals."
6422,"As for variants, the more contagious ones are an issue for the unvaccinated world, but so far we haven’t found any evidence that they will render vaccines ineffective, so it’s more people are aligned with reality, not downplaying things."
6423,Absolutely.
6424,I love this idea.
6425,I really could care less about wearing masks for transportation or commerce.
6426,That doesn’t bother me at all.
6427,Masks do inhibit social outings though.

6430,"Oh how the tables have turned, remember when Canadians were keying american cars that were in Canada."

6432,Oh I have been a big critic of the CDC under both Trump and Biden.
6433,I don’t think this is only a health-based decision.
6434,"However, they do know that this decision will open the floodgates for unvaxxed people to unmask, too."
6435,That risk was probably taken into account.
6436,"I remember reading a lot of ""articles"" on this sub saying the vaccine may not be ready for another 2 years (in 2020) or we may not be able to go outside for another several years."
6437,Lots on here were saying we would never see outside again.
6438,"I definitely would say, despite the benefits these corporations got from this pandemic, they worked hard day and night to get this vaccine up and running and effectively."
6439,Medical/Science has come a long way and I'm hoping now we'll be more prepared for the future.
6440,I don’t see why not.
6441,"The issue with PPE distribution wasn’t corruption, it was a lack of supply."
6442,"Trump’s plan was to give it to the states to distribute, I know Biden tweaked some things but I don’t really see how a significant difference in distribution could have happened between the two mostly similar strategies."
6443,"Masks have developmental issues too, they don't come with no harm."

6453,"I’m fine with 1-2 days of meetings the office, but WFH needs to remain."
6454,Check into rehab immediately
6455,Cause the studies for under 12 was started later and isn't done yet... Don't know what else you think the answer could be?
6456,This rate should speed up as more and more will get in once they see their peers getting vaccinated.
6457,"Even without a pandemic, that's a stupid and rude thing to ask."
6458,Of course you're not actively performing a surgery on the plane at that very moment
6459,"At least in the English translation it does not say a variant ""from Singapore"", it's says  a variant ""in Singapore""."
6460,I originally took it to mean the Indian B.1.617.2 variant that is currently spreading around India and Singapore.
6461,That's because it's actually a guitar pedal.
6462,At least you should be able to make awesome wowowowow noises more
6463,Ditto.

6477,There was one chick with a funky brown napkin fake mask that gave me a chuckle.
6478,"Not to defend this move, but it basically does wait until September."

6495,It would be really nice if everyone could just keep their masks on a little while longer to protect vulnerable people.
6496,America!
6497,Sigh.
6498,Haha if only.
6499,"Dentist appointments are like gold dust, good luck getting an appointment, let alone changing dentist at the moment"
6500,The CDC can’t get their story straight
6501,No shit.
6502,My friend went to Disney unvaccinated with Covid and no one even knew.
6503,God bless America
6504,Why are we waiting until September for approval though?
6505,Is it because we need data for 12-16 year olds?
6506,I've heard the reason we're delaying approval is because of unknown long term efficiency.
6507,"But it seems that Pfizer's vaccine has 80-90% efficiency, and we seem to already have data for people who've had the vaccine for 6-12 months already."
6508,In drivers Ed they told us about a case where two cheerleaders were bucked into the front seat of a car and their linebacker boyfriends were unbuckled in the back seat.
6509,Guess what happened in the crash:  the linebackers crushed the cheerleaders to death.
6510,Letting people just pick and choose what rules they feel like following does affect those around them.

6515,I work with the public and people feel safer seeing us with masks on.
6516,3.
6517,I actually kinda like wearing a mask now that I'm used to it.
6518,"It's great for those of us who have to interact with customers; I can frown, smirk, stick my tongue out, etc."
6519,without freaking out the Karens.
6520,"Not that I do that often, but it's nice to have the option."

6549,"Neither are any of the other rights we enjoy, so by that logic we should all be individual islands in the concrete jungle fighting each other for survival on a daily basis, stealing objects from each other, stealing mates from each other, fucking in the streets, mauling the people we don’t like."

6554,"As an aside, companies do NOT reward the hardest worker."
6555,That's not the criteria they use at all.
6556,"Companies tend to reward workers based on some combination of perceived impact, corporate politics, and most importantly the likelyhood a needed/valued employee will leave if their compensation isn't raised."
6557,The weighting of those factors will vary drastically from one firm or manager to another.
6558,"That said, there are still some managers out there who put a premium on the outdated metric of visible time working, but there are fewer and fewer of those around every year."
6559,Perceived output/impact matters far more as far as comp goes than does the number of hours worked.
6560,As does your relationnship with the people who actually make the decisions.
6561,But people who don’t want to take it could just take a year off or take remote classes.
6562,I think the states and federal government could get together to shield themselves from those kinds of lawsuits.

6564,See if you can find someone from their religious group who is pro-vaccine.

6598,"Fair enough, seems like there are few clear-cut examples of purely outdoor transmission / outbreaks."
6599,"I would caution against assuming that being outdoors = safe, though, which is the takeaway some people are going with."
6600,"Reading through other examples, I saw a case study of two friends who (allegedly) met outdoors without masks and had a lengthy conversation in close proximity."
6601,"To me, situational awareness is key - that long close proximity conversation is more exposure than two people walking down the street in opposite directions that pass briefly."
6602,"Or a sporting event where you get up close and personal with a player from another team for significant periods, breathing heavily - that would be a greater exposure risk than hanging out in a park social distancing."

6613,It's just not backed up by science at this point.

6615,Again.
6616,I'll follow the CDC on this one.
6617,"I never said ""blood clots from birth control have no effects on the patient""

I said ""In most cases it won't have any effect on the patient"" 

And yes of course more people have died using brith control because it has existed for so much longer and because people use it way more than once or twice."
6618,Don't misquote me.
6619,The reason why the Danish government chose to stop using that specific vaccine is because Denmark has such a low amount of cases that it would statistically kill more people to use the vaccine.

6635,We have burgers with fried chicken as the bun
6636,This is true but less than half the population or nearing half are vaccinated which is not enough yet.
6637,The risk will never be zero at this point thanks to anti maskers and anti vaxxers but at least we can wear the masks a little longer while people get vaccinated.

6694,Millions contract it every year globally and hundreds of thousands die.
6695,Maybe it would be marginally worse by the numbers if their wasn't a flu vaccine every year.
6696,The question is with covid for whom that risk is applied.
6697,"Young healthy 20 something's that are sufficient in vitamin D3, C, and Zinc have almost no risk from covid."
6698,They would be assuming more risk of an adverse reaction from the vaccine if they received it.
6699,"That being said, if you are over 60 the opposite is true."

6897,Here’s my explanation for the autoimmune diseases and how the vaccine can contribute to some cases in some people.
6898,"Autoimmune diseases start from an event, usually trauma, stress, or an infection, so basically any kind of stressor, and that leads to a chain reaction of inflammation."
6899,Stress stresses out the immune system and that can make it falsely recognize the bodies own cells as an invader.
6900,"So when a vaccine bedriddens you for 2 days, bruises up your arm, and gives you a 102 fever, it’s like the exact stressor needed to set off an autoimmune disease."
6901,This is why people like me and others want to wait a couple years to see the effects because autoimmune diseases will take a long time to manifest after the stressor event.
6902,"The only people I would tell not to get the vaccine would be the ones who have already had the virus, are immune, and had no major symptoms during the course of the virus."
6903,"So for someone like me who’s already got an extensive family history of autoimmune diseases, it’s in my best interest to skip the vaccine."

Because 1) we arent even near 50% of the population fully vaccinated a 2) theres no easy way for places to check who is vaccinated and they shouldn't have to be the vaccine police and 3) there are people who will lie about it so they wont have to wear a mask which puts others at risk.

Cases have been rapidly decreasing for weeks now, and that's as we ease mask mandates."

6980,"&gt; further mutations into vaccine-resistant strains

It is incredibly rare for pathogens to mutate in ways that fundamentally alter themselves in such a way and to the extent necessary to shield them from the effects of vaccines."
6981,"With SARS-COV-2, the mutation rate is slightly slower than most viruses, lowering the chances further."
6982,"And again, since the vaccine drive and natural heat of the spring and summer will force cases even further down, making the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain even less likely."

7024,That’s great!
7025,Shouldn’t end them until a given county reaches herd immunity once we actually know what level of coverage gets to herd immunity.
7026,You do realize that some people have no choice to wear one?
7027,"You literally don't know their medical condition (they could be immunocompromised or married to someone who is) and literally for them wearing one, it hurts no one."
7028,… and feel the needle
7029,"Yeah, I'm kinda of the mind that whatever works, I'm good with."
7030,I still have family in Ohio.
7031,Some of them are even not stupid lol.
7032,"My brother in healthcare is fine, of that I'm sure, but his wife's family is chock full of co-morbidities and I'm surprised no one has yet had problems."
7033,[removed]
7034,More like “special.”
7035,WALDENBURG IS GERMAN
7036,What are you even trying to argue here?
7037,"Somehow Taiwan didn't test people to ""look better than China"" when they went hundreds of days without community spread?"
7038,"Are you claiming there was covid doing rounds among Taiwanese population this whole time, but they hid it by not testing people?"
7039,But somehow there were no people with acute respiratory failure showing up in hospitals?
7040,Which in your last message admit they cannot potentially hide.
7041,"I was a cave dweller before covid, and I'll be a cave dweller after covid."
7042,My understanding is that phase 4 clinical trials are when long term effects are monitored and studied.
7043,It’s the phase we are in with the Covid vaccines.
7044,"Funding efforts were able to speed up trials 1-3, and some manufacturers even chose to make the unprecedented choice to combine trial phases."
7045,"But Phase 4 can’t be sped up because it requires time, and time can’t be sped up by funding."
7046,"There are a great deal of people, like me, who are fully up to date on vaccines, and hold high hopes for the Covid Vaccines being distributed, but my past experiences with unintended medical harm make me extra cautious with newly tested products."
7047,What kind of investigation could even help here?
7048,China's government doesn't want its failings examined under a microscope so I can't imagine them exposing the necessary data to study Covid's origins.
7049,"Even if, as the article suggested, an international effort examined 2019's less biased data, what would even be available that was relevant to the 2020 pandemic?"
7050,Maybe pneumonia cases from December 2019?
7051,"I'm not saying that it's impossible, but as a layman, I feel like this call for investigation is in pipe dream territory and wonder if I'm missing something."
7052,Winnie the Pooh will prevent this investigation from getting started
7053,In Canada if you have an outstanding ticket/warrant/penalty you cannot renew any licenses or registrations at the registries.
7054,"It is NOT mandatory to be vaccinated here BUT if they wanted to they would not allow you to renew drivers license and registration which needs to be done yearly, also you would not be able to apply for business registration and other things done at the registry."
7055,CDC did not recommend removing mask mandates.
7056,Who the fuck cares if people wear one?
7057,The fact that some people are shaming people for this is so ridiculous when they are considered normal in many other countries and when literally wearing one harms no one?
7058,"As long as people aren't shaming people for not wearing one, I don't really give a fuck what they choose to do."
7059,I keep telling my husband when I am 30 and then pause and realize I am already 30.
7060,Crazy how fast the 20's went by.
7061,&gt;there's no excuse not to get vaccinated.
7062,unless you are a child or one of the people that can't get vaccinated.
7063,Or one of the ones that gets vaccinated but then the vaccine doesn't work.
7064,[removed]
7065,Facts
7066,"You're right, I should watch more main stream media."
7067,"Free corporate real estate en me cabeza, sounds like a good deal, no?"
7068,Many mask mandates have already ended; there will be very few states (possibly none) with mandates by July 1.
7069,That's because they're only giving everybody the first dose...
7070,"If I were told that by management, I would be so tempted to get a bunch of friends to eat a whole head of garlic each, exercise for 4 hours, come in to shop, find that manager, and practically grind their bodies on him while asking for help with something."
7071,Any manager that wants to enforce some bullshit rule should themselves have to be subject to the consequences of it.
7072,"UK has so many people already vaccinated, including a large proportion fully vaccinate, while Taiwan does not."
7073,So Taiwan is much more susceptible to a new wave of infection compared with the UK.
7074,The thing is though... screw them.
7075,"Like seriously, what are we supposed to do about it?"
7076,You’re not gonna close a 30-40% gap from herd immunity no matter how much “outreach” or incentives you give.
7077,"The only way would be to require it by law, and that’s not gonna happen in this country."
7078,And you shouldn’t even have to anyway.
7079,We’re all adults.
7080,We all make choices every day and live with the consequences.
7081,The vaccine exists.
7082,Everyone knows this.
7083,"It’s safe, it’s insanely effective, and you can find this out with even a modicum of effort on your part, as well as go get one (using general “you” here, not you yourself who posted)."
7084,So if you do none of that... then go “love” yourself.
7085,The rest of us are moving on.
7086,Enjoy your virus.
7087,"I feel bad for my aunt, she works at Walmart and they are lifting mask mandate tomorrow, she asked the Walmart pharmacist if she could get the vaccine the last couple of days but he told her that he wouldn’t give it to her because he doesn’t want to waste a vile as not many are getting vaccinated."
7088,I told her that’s fucking illegal for him to keep denying her the vaccine.
7089,"She said oh well, I’ll still wear my mask while working, but I sadly had to tell her that if people aren’t wearing the mask and they are COVID positive, that surgical mask isn’t going to 100 percent protect you if they cough or sneeze or yell to her face."
7090,I hope she tries CVS tomorrow
7091,Reinfection is rare.
7092,Vaccines are free
7093,I'm immunocompromised due to an organ transplant.
7094,"I just saw my medical team @ UCLA, and was given clearance to essentially do everything but be in crowded areas without masking."
7095,"if I got the clearance from my doc, who is very cautious, then 99% of us have little to nothing to worry about with the anti-maskers at this point."
7096,"I can be around people who I know have been vaccinated and are at least 2 weeks out from second dose, and I'm even going back to the gym tomorrow after a 15 month hiatus."
7097,I have been given clearance to fly again after around the same time period of zero travel other than by car... my wife and I haven't seen any family in almost 2 years since we live 2000 miles away from our hometowns.
7098,"I have no sympathy, empathy, or any patience for these willfully ignorant fools."
7099,"They will either get COVID and get super sick while developing antibodies, or they will die."
7100,"It's highly contagious as we all know, and the anti mask buffoons will be more cavalier than ever now... 

History is not on their side in this."
7101,"From looking at any pandemic in the past, the people who openly refuse meds and treatment never come out well in the end."
7102,Jesus.
7103,I have 2 coworkers who have refused to get vaccinated and now everyone at work threw their masks away.
7104,I'm like... hoo boy.
7105,Can't wait tll our engineering team all dies one day.
7106,"and a difference in china is there isn't widespread refusal to wear masks because ""muh freedom"" like you see here."
7107,"In the East, people wear masks before covid, no big deal."
7108,Usually because of air pollution.
7109,"So when it was clear there was a epidemic starting, people saw the sense in wearing masks."

7119,Some ppl genuinely don't want normal life again
7120,"Unless there's new studies I may have missed, the chances of spreading covid are much lower when you're vaccinated but still a possibility so they probably just want to make sure they don't get their friends sick."
7121,"Though I read it as them saying ""until both of us are fully vaccinated"" as in their partner or whoever who may not be vaccinated."
7122,"That's completely your opinion and a KN95 ear strap style, not the same."
7123,You obviously haven't studied the physics of vapor trails and how wind is completely a factor in how an airborne virus spreads outside.
7124,The CDC or any other body doesn't magically make things safe because they say so.

7138,Well it’s just propaganda being pushed to target young people and make them believe other young people demand vaccines.
7139,Young people are the highest population that doesn’t get vaccinated.
7140,They’re trying to change that.
7141,"As a fully vaccinated californian, I have no problem with this."
7142,"People will immediately start lying about getting the vaccine, and then our COVID deaths are going to go back up again."
7143,I have no problem playing it safe for the safety of those who can't get the vaccine for medical reasons.

7285,Unfortunately this probably has less to do with the visitors and more to do with people in the US being so against getting vaccinated that even setting the precedent of requirements for vaccines is offensive to many.

7362,Wow 70% on July 4th exactly at this rate?
7363,I wonder if the administration is expecting an influx after it gets full approval since more places are likely to start mandating it.
7364,"When Texas announced they were basically opening everything back up a month or two ago I thought they were making a huge mistake, but I guess I was wrong."
7365,There is still currently a 9/11 number of dead people every 6 days.
7366,I'm not sure why they relaxed the mask mandate at this point.
7367,We had lower numbers last August.
7368,"My state will most certainly never go above 50% vaccinated, and it still takes months to develop a vaccine for variants."
7369,This is far from over.
7370,I don't have a narrative.
7371,The fact of the matter is that we have studies like this and studies that go back decades into the 1940's that show there's statistically almost no difference in all the randomised control tests that they've done of groups of people wearing masks versus not wearing masks and how that might affect them from contracting things like the flu or covid.
7372,That is what the data and science says.
7373,And yet most of the health officials in charge of things and the media would have you believe that wearing a mask will keep you protected and have some huge effect on whether or not you get covid or not and it's simply a lie.
7374,Sure if you are in a high risk area you should be wearing one regardless like a hospital or a nursing home just in case but otherwise there is zero data to show that it would actually make a difference elsewhere.
7375,Yes percentages do matter you are correct.
7376,Which is why it's been a crime against humanity that we have been lied to and the average person has been brainwashed into thinking that they actually have a huge chance of getting covid if they don't have a mask on and they actually have some sort of legitimate chance of dying from it if they get it when the reality is the mortality rate is only like 0.001% according to the WHO.
7377,People have 0 perspective because  They have not been told any sort of objective truth and so they are living in fear of something that they shouldn't be  And are therefore incapable of making any sort of informed decision about any of it.
7378,If you had a 0.001% chance of getting in a car accident every day when you got in your car to go somewhere would you just never drive again?
7379,I'm sorry but it's sheer lunacy.
7380,Nobody knows yet.
7381,It lasts at least 6 months - that's how long the longest people have been vaccinated for.
7382,We might know by the end of this year whether we will need a booster next year.

7399,So are the ppl saying it’ll last a year.
7400,I don’t trust Pfizer’s own studies any more than I trust a police depth investigating their own officers.
7401,"This is actually really good, with a population of around 1.9million and they have just recently started offering the vaccines to those over the age of 30, they are getting ready to lifted alot of the restrictions in place in N.I this weekend, so hopefully they wont see numbers going up."
7402,"One big complaint i hear from there is where the vaccination centers are, some people are having to travel half way across the country to get to one, so they are staying putt until their local GP offers it to them."
7403,I had a cold a month ago... it’s still going around.
7404,Get tested if you feel like you want some piece of mind but rest assured there are still a million other viruses/bacteria that can give you the sniffles other than COVID.
7405,"Would it be fair to say that the CDC directly affects American health advice, but also indirectly affects global health advice with their influence on the WHO?"
7406,"As mentioned before, China did block access and they're guilty of obscuring origins of the coronavirus."

7408,"They make their recommendations and one day it's pro-one country and the next, it's anti-the same country."
7409,"So I'll agree that some specific advice they gave benefits China, but that's about it."
7410,The Illinois daily update said this.
7411,"""A total of 10,433,777 vaccines have been administered in Illinois as of last midnight."

7415,The issue looks to be resolved and those doses are expected to be included with tomorrow’s data.
7416,"**"""
7417,Because natural immunity matters.
7418,"Ever since it became apparent that the virus was spreading outside of Wuhan and Hubei, it became apparent that eventually infections would happen *everywhere* with such a contagious virus."
7419,The lockdowns were meant to delay that until vaccines were widely available.
7420,"If a country doesn't have a successful vaccination effort, eventually the virus will spread throughout the population."
7421,It's pretty simple stuff.
7422,The whole entire article is nothing more than a lie to push for mandatory vaccines.
7423,Young people are not demanding this outside of a very small percentage.
7424,"Yes, the wording on the NHS website is that AZ is ""recommended"" for under 40s so I assumed it can still be administered if others are not available and the recipient agrees."

7427,So I got a spike protein antibody test done today because I'm on some immunosuppressive drugs.
7428,"It came back positive for IgG (RBD) and negative for IgA, which isn't terribly surprising because I've been vaccinated (Moderna, fully vaccinated) but never had COVID."
7429,"The question is, how do I interpret my results?"
7430,Positive was a value of &gt; 0.7 AU.
7431,I had 1.7.
7432,I'm not sure what units they're testing given the use of 'arbitrary units'.
7433,"There's no normal range or reference to compare to either, but having only 2.5x the negative result doesn't have me dancing in the streets and my hunch is its a pretty low level."
7434,Any ideas?
7435,My doctor has no idea because there's not any published guidance.

7447,"It wasn't stated as such... usually the default is ""absolute numbers""."
7448,Some guy on Reddit has a script to run to game the online booking system.
7449,I guess it just keeps inputting your info and codes and auto books an appointment.
7450,What I did was make a list of all the zip codes of the testing centers.
7451,Once I got a code I could go down the list of like 30 zip codes (PLZ Nummern) and copy and paste them into the search box for a testing site fairly quickly and go through the whole list in about a half-hour.
7452,"The ironic thing is, I got up to use the bathroom at three in the morning and thought I'd try once before I went back to bed and just picked a random site."

7455,its like a blur to me.
7456,Just turned 31 and yeah my 20s feel like they just flew by
7457,How can anyone on the planet make the claim that COVID or the vaccine had worse long term effects.
7458,There is absolutely nothing that can be said by any scientist or doctor (or anyone schmuck on the internet) that can prove this stance.
7459,"I’ve seen this argument a few times and as much as I would love to know the answer, we won’t for awhile."
7460,Where I'm from its liberals that think they've got it figured out.
7461,Not to mention they think if they speak the loudest and get the last word in they somehow win the argument.
7462,"You can't force someone to get vaccinated, and especially experimental ones that have only been authorized for emergency use."
7463,There are dangers every time you step out your front door.
7464,That's just a part life.
7465,Grow up and get over it.
7466,No
7467,It gets harder and harder everyday that daily cases drop.
7468,Sort of weird no one talks about daily cases anymore.
7469,If the cases get low enough it could be nearly impossible for you to even encounter the virus.
7470,How financially privileged you sound..
7471,I can relate to this!
7472,"When I was a young kid, I absolutely hated having to get a vaccine."
7473,"As a teenager, it still was a bit terrifying, thinking about that needle etc."
7474,"Now I'm 31 years old and suddenly I look forward to getting shots thanks to Covid, lol."
7475,I've heard many people say that they didn't feel the Covid shot at all.
7476,And this is also true for the flu shot I got earlier this year – it didn't hurt at all.
7477,I thought she was still preparing something (I looked away from my arm) but she was already done.
7478,"Since I'm German, I was eligible for my Covid shot only last week."
7479,"To be quite honest, it hurt a little bit, so I did feel this one, but really just a little bit."
7480,Not bad at all.
7481,"I believe it depends on how relaxed your arm muscles are (you should try to relax that arm as much as you can), but it also depends on the vaccination skills of the person administering the shot."
7482,"In my case, it was a doctor (like 60+ years old) who probably used some old-school vaccination skills."
7483,"My flu shot was administered by a younger ""medizinische Fachangestellte"" (basically an employee at the doctor's office with practical medical education, but not University-level theoretical education – responsible for carrying out treatments like injections, among other things) and it looks like the ""MFA"" education includes better injection training compared to what they teach to future doctors at universities in Germany."
7484,The needle for speedle!
7485,"Because of people who did vaccinate, these people won't die due to hospitals being overcrowded, but they still might end up with huge hospital bills."
7486,Too bad these are also the people who don't want universal health care.
7487,absolutely agreed.
7488,What pisses me off most about this is the same crowd that said that masks were a plot by the government to cover us up and control us are now pissed that mask mandates are heavily easing up around the country because of the vaccinations.

7507,"2020.02.06: My friend's mother who is Chinese, had a transfer flight that originated from Bangkok that goes through Taiwan, who won't even set foot on Taiwan soil, was blocked from transferring flight and had to be stuck at the airport and rebook flights."
7508,This doesn't make fucking sense how that can help the situation in anyway.
7509,"This was only directed at Chinese, and one who happened not to be in China for the previous two weeks."
7510,Other nationalities went on their merry way.
7511,Let me remind you that US officials who already brought the virus to Canada and Japan before were allowed to enter Taiwan without quarantine in August.
7512,That's the kind of measures in place.
7513,Can't comment on personal anecdotes.
7514,You're talking about the transit ban in place after the first detections from Wuhan?
7515,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What you don't know is that I'm actually really a health expert."
7516,I said in 2020 April that social distancing and flatten the curve are shams.
7517,"Wearing masks and stamping out the virus like China, Australia and NZ is the correct way and look where we are."
7518,Oh wait the contact tracing you mentioned always gave back 0 results.

&gt;The rest of the world didn't invite Taiwan only because of China lol, other than the anti-China group of countries everyone knows what's up."
7526,I guess you're less interested in talking public health policies and testing than politics you do not half understand.
7527,I'd guess a vast majority of the (eligible) people in the US who want the vaccine has already gotten their first shot.
7528,"We're not going to get much higher, and we're never going to hit the threshold for herd immunity."
7529,Can't chill out when so many people I know died or nearly died and I don't want another year of this bullshit
7530,Fair point.
7531,Would you consider giving out $100 for getting vaccinated an incentive or an advertisement?
7532,Or are the two not exclusive ideas?
7533,Thanks for arguing my side.
7534,There is still a ton of unknowns.
7535,Obviously vaccines are a game changer and I hope everyone gets one.
7536,But there just isn't good data on infection rates yet because it's all so new.
7537,"And to your point, it's been during the heaviest level of restrictions."
7538,I think people just want to believe the vaccines have fixed everything and we can all go back to normal.

7554,"Biggest issue is as long as some cases are ongoing you give covid 19 chances to mutate and this could be to a worse more fatal version, or a version that vaccines are less protective against."
7555,Its a bit like wearing a mask you are doing it as much for people around you are you are yourself.
7556,"Interesting to note is whilst young people are less likely to die or get seriously ill, there seem to be at least as likely if not more to develop long term issues."
7557,This is referred to as long covid here in the UK.
7558,There is defiantly more of a feeling in the UK of pulling together and doing stuff for us all and high take up rates for vaccines.
7559,Got az in Feb and moderna in April.

7564,Kids still can't get vaccinated.
7565,So they are endangered (even if the risk of lingering damage is lower but still possible) and they can carry it on to others who can't get vaccinated.

7623,It is undeniable that getting a vaccine is the right way to end a pandemic.
7624,There is no other answer.
7625,"Its not an opinion thing, its fact."
7626,For now.
7627,Temporarily.
7628,"We don't know when, but at some point, the virus could have the capacity to swirl around among unvaccinated people long enough to mutate into variants that render the vaccine far less effective for everyone."
7629,Would you particularly enjoy rehashing this every year or two?
7630,Maybe we could...ya know...NOT breed fun new variants of this thing?
7631,"Also, what of children and immunocompeomised and anyone who can't currently get the vaccine?"
7632,Do we care about them or?
7633,"I mean, not really."
7634,Nothing wrong with suggesting that maybe commercial buildings should have better ventilation because it decreases the spread of airborne pathogens without being noticeable or intrusive
7635,"This is an incentive, not an advertisement."
7636,I mentioned I was immunocompromised and was going to wear a mask indoors because I don’t trust people and within an hour the downvotes came in

7645,"Yeah, but ending the pandemic doesn't mean eliminating the virus entirely."
7646,"I mean, yeah."
7647,Even though a forth got started it couldn't really overcome increasing vaccination so it quickly peaked and fell before becoming a problem

7649,"I believe the second “drank the koolaid” comes into play, they’ve tipped their hand and there is no winning."
7650,And that was over suggesting the university of alberta’s free science literacy course to interpret the science rather than relying on a third party to do it for them.
7651,They’re nutty.
7652,&gt;One dose is 80%-90% effective after two weeks.
7653,Now add some natural immunity on top of that 60% figure.
7654,Natural immunity is baked into that number.
7655,You can't do a clinical trial that ignores natural immunity.

7660,It's a checkbox tick but with a syringe (vaccine)
7661,"No, it’s a 95% reduction in risk."
7662,For unvaccinated individuals the attack rate among close household contacts stands around 17% [[source]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102) and a vaccinated person would have a 95% less chance of getting infected.
7663,You mean people lie?

7668,It's like a graph i think;  rates were plunging but this'll make em go up.
7669,You realize people have been hospitalized and died after being fully vaccinated right?
7670,"As of May 10, among 115 million Americans fully immunized, the CDC reported 1,136 such hospitalizations and 223 such deaths."
7671,"This is especially concerning because those vaccinated people have been still required to follow masking and distance protocols up until now, with a return to no masks and essentially no restrictions those numbers will do nothing but climb."
7672,"Since it obviously doesn't even need to mutate at all to still kill some vaccinated people, that does in fact worry me about what a mutation could achieve."

7681,"However I'm not sure if this is actually possible to implement, for a variety of reasons."
7682,There's a lot of questions around that.

7724,All good dude.
7725,Tone is hard to read over text.
7726,Thank you
7727,Yeah most of the US is about there.
7728,It will be interesting to see what happens in the Fall though.
7729,Kids aren’t dying (statistically) and the immune compromised shouldn’t be going out anyways
7730,"""Follow the science"""
7731,"Right, which is what they are really governing Ithis respect."
7732,"If NJ suddenly owned Greenland, it wouldn't change the fact that the majority live in a dense area."
7733,LA county has twice the density of NJ and nearly as many people.
7734,They don't really need to be concerned with what's going on in the deserts or the Sierra Nevada.
7735,I live in western NY and have friends just across the border in Ontario.
7736,I’d gladly buy some vaccines if it meant I could get it into their arms
7737,Such a stark contrast from just down the road where Minnesota plans to be fully open for July
7738,The worst part is how the people who politicized a public health measure for their personal gain will never be held to account.
7739,Yeah I live near Carlsbad.
7740,I swear they’re still absolutely enforcing it.
7741,Haven’t seen a person in a store without a mask in a very long time.
7742,It’s worse in Oceanside.
7743,So the US is producing 80m MRNA vaccines a month and exporting 20m of them.
7744,The US already has a surplus of 80m MRNA vaccines sitting around unused.
7745,That surplus will only increase and demand really isn't.
7746,Not to mention many of these countries also purchased doses from those companies and can't receive purchased doses from the US because they're blocked.
7747,I think they're trying to incentivize getting the vaccine for those that haven't yet gotten it.
7748,They believe that goal is more important than the slight uptick in cases this decision might cause.
7749,"It's the honor system, should work just fine in the USA..... /s"
7750,It exists but not the way it does in your minds.
7751,It isn't mowing healthy people down in the streets like this sub or the media portray.
7752,In most of the stores I’ve been at in socal they’re handling it right.
7753,They just have a guy at the door and a box of masks and just say hey do you need a mask?
7754,Most people are cool with it here.

7793,You are aware that in many areas masking and social distancing mandates are tied together right?
7794,And what that kind of socialization isn't OK now?
7795,Fuck that thought process.
7796,"Sometimes people want to be able to socialize with strangers, people outside of their group around them."
7797,When was the last time you went to a random group of people outside of your group at a park and talked to them?
7798,On a hike?
7799,Beach?
7800,"Yeah that isn't the same as talking to people outside of your group at a bar, restaurant, sporting event, etc."
7801,What you're talking about is socializing with friends....most of us did that during covid anyway either outside or vertically...maybe what this person was talking about was socializing in crowds...you are aware that most extroverts thrive off that kind of interaction right?
7802,It is depressing not being able to do that for extroverts because it's depriving people of major source of socialization.
7803,what does that have to do with what i said?
7804,what are you talking about?
7805,This entire discussion is about the change in mask policy and its affect on children who can't be vaccinated.

7811,What's the difference between letting nasty anti-vaxxers coughing their covid germs into my shared public air?
7812,There’s recent studies showing that some people who had Covid suffer from long term erectile difficulties.
7813,"Forward him a few of those studies, if he’s anything like I was when I was 19 that might convince him."
7814,Guess I'm not going to target
7815,Well then from here on out I guess we better mask up and shut down indoor dining/bars/theaters/large gatherings/international travel over flu season.
7816,You can never be too safe!
7817,The question was about vaccines but you're talking about masks.
7818,Was that intentional?
7819,The mRNA platform is easy enough for them to modify and they're monitoring the situation.
7820,"At this time, there's no value in creating a booster for any of the mutations, because the original vaccine is effective against them."
7821,Parents put their children into deadly cars all the time.
7822,They won't and they won't try.
7823,Most stores are simply saying it is not their problem anymore.
7824,Hopefully Lowe’s follow soon
7825,[removed]
7826,&gt; People who think it’s too soon to lift mask mandates indoors are still following science.
7827,The science says that’s less risky for everyone.
7828,"Whether or not it’s a good policy move is outside the purview of “following the science”

Wearing a hard hat almost every waking moment of your life is going to almost always be safer than not wearing one."
7829,"And we can think of millions of actions we could take that would mitigate risk, each sillier than the last."
7830,That doesn't mean that taking those actions is 'following the science' you're just a weirdo in a hard hat.

7842,They can quit.
7843,32% vax rate is pretty low especially if demand is dropping too...?
7844,Am I wrong here?
7845,"It would go through a full phase I trial with a relatively small group of study participants to verify that it is safe, achieves similar levels of antibody response, and that those antibodies can bind to the variants."
7846,But it won't go through a full large-scale study to find out their real-world effectiveness; we'll find that out at large scale.
7847,Phase I testing is actually already underway for Pfizer.
7848,We just don't know whether we'll end up actually needing it before we don't have enough cases circulating in the US to make it worth doing.
7849,I don't understand why this recent uptick of discussion about covid-19 danger to kids in the U.S. exists.
7850,It is at most as risky as it was last year which was quite low already.
7851,Now even more so with most adults vaccinated or masked if the numbers are correct.
7852,"If you want to be extra safe, then be safe by all means but you really don't need to stress over it too much."
7853,I'm probably biased because my son already had covid with close to zero effect but I was worried up until that happened.
7854,Please take care of yourself
7855,"Probably, yeah."
7856,But that doesn’t happen over night.
7857,I assume a lot of people would have to start dying before they would decide to create a booster.
7858,"It's impossible to have zero deaths, thats something you need to accept no matter how sad it may be."
7859,Because until you are a parent you dont know what it's like to be protecting your own child.

7877,It's fast turning into some sort of logic puzzle to try to figure out if any given public place has lifted masks or not.
7878,I'm very close to getting my second vaccine dose and am figuring I'm just going to stay inside until I get it at this point.
7879,"I don't want to risk dealing with the people who are going to throw caution to the wind and start coughing everywhere, or shouting at store employees because they think restrictions have been lifted for a particular store when they haven't."

7898,If you eat chicken and it tastes gross it’s likely that it’s spoiled.
7899,You don’t know that if you can’t taste or smell it.
7900,Losing your sense of taste definitely isn’t trivial.
7901,Only alarmist if you are over the top.
7902,Asking unvaccinated people to mask up is reasonable.
7903,Asking people to get vaccinated is reasonable.
7904,But asking vaccinated people to mask up is kind of pointless.
7905,[removed]
7906,Yet we can't stop them.
7907,"If you pat yourself on the back for getting some of them to put a mask on beneath their nose in public, I doubt you've realized that in their private lives they weren't socially distancing or masking whatsoever."
7908,So the rest of us should just get vaccinated and call it a day.
7909,[removed]
7910,Just the *slight* difference of 70% being vaccinated now.
7911,I find it hard to believe it's lower than 90%.
7912,*Money*
7913,That's true.
7914,It's hard for me to imagine not knowing anyone who hasn't been affected by someone in their life dying of covid.
7915,"Although I have heard some pretty strong denial going on- someone tests positive for covid and dies, but no, it must have been something else."
7916,I think there's also stigma associated with it in some contexts.
7917,I wasn’t proposing that we restrict their access at all.
7918,"It just made me feel a lot better for a second thinking I’m vaccinated and that the unvaccinated are largely only posing a risk to themselves, so it’s their own fault if they die."
7919,But I was just pointing out their stupidity may lead to those that are vaccinated getting Covid because of what it could mutate in to.
7920,"Or maybe, just maybe, not everyone is like AZ?"
7921,"Also, the EU is so terrible right?"
7922,"Like, demanding that companies fulfill their contractual commitments?"

7950,"In Apple Photos I can even search for things like 'bed', 'balloon', 'car', 'swim', etc and have it return pictures with that content."
7951,"I don't think it's that far fetched that they could take a still photo when it notices the face looking at the camera (tech in any point and shoot), and make an attempt at matching it to others using similar tech as Apple, Facebook, etc."

7960,The question is are you going to use one with an exhalation valve
7961,"No, you just ignore them because they're dumb"
7962,I have a 1 year old who can't wear a mask per CDC guidelines and can't get a vaccine.
7963,"My child depends on herd immunity or sane masking and social  distancing controls, neither of which exist anymore."

7972,Some vaccinated people don’t like watching some selfish unvaccinated people infect other unvaccinated people.

7975,"Plus the ""lockdown forever"" ideology, disproportionately from secular sources, which would be far more destructive long-term if followed-through is ignored."
7976,Throwing shade on all Christians for those amongst us who blew a mental gasket over COVID is just bigotry.
7977,No groups come off looking good in this crisis.
7978,The problem our civilization has is that truth is being warped around ideology by motivated political minorities on all sides at an industrial scale.
7979,"Over the past year the conversation should have been what was reasonable to combat the biological/social/economic reality but it wasn't, those loud political minorities went to opposite extremes and fired flaming arrows of condemnation at each other."
7980,The media magnified this beyond all proportion and people felt like they had to pick sides.
7981,We're lucky that our political-industrial-medical complex was functional enough to get us these amazing vaccines miraculously quickly.
7982,There's no guarantee that this will be true next time if the insanity keeps escalating.
7983,Reasonable people need to stand up to the ideologues on all sides.
7984,"Yeah, but claiming that children are naturally better protected than vaccinated adults is a spectacular enough claim that it needs some sourcing."
7985,I have two kids that are too young for the vaccine.

8013,The big thing you’re missing in your comment is how every new infection is a chance for mutations that can lead to variants that the current vaccines are even less effective against.
8014,That certainly does affect those who are vaccinated.

8028,That's not what illegal means
8029,Means that it isn’t clear?
8030,What point am I missing?
8031,I live in a small rural town and if you had asked anyone here the real plague was having to wear the mask in the first place.
8032,"I really am glad that’s some people’s worst experience through all of this, but that just goes to show how little of a shit they give about anyone but themselves."
8033,Exactly.
8034,Which is why lifting mask mandates is premature right now because of the kids.
8035,"We haven't reached herd immunity anywhere, we haven't figured out a way to prove vaccination status, and millions of nitwits still haven't gotten a vaccine even though they are eligible."

8037,"Flu vaccines are great, and a higher vaccination rate would reduce cases."

8107,"Jokes on you, Ohio literally amended the health order today to align with CDC guidelines."
8108,No masks required if you are vaccinated.
8109,Though businesses are still permitted to implement their own rules to shop there.
8110,From the summary email I got like an hour ago: https://imgur.com/VtFLVUZ.jpg
8111,If you're fully vaccinated your chance of getting COVID is incredibly low and your chance of getting significantly sick from an infection is near zero.
8112,Masking when vaccinated is simply not supported by science.
8113,"mRNA-based vaccines were developed and tested (but not licensed) for use in humans previously - for rabies, Zika, cytomegalovirus, and influenza."
8114,"They weren't licensed for production for a number of reasons, but it wasn't because they didn't get through the trials."
8115,"The Spike proteins are the same proteins the body would encounter in the non-mRNA vaccines, or in an actual case of covid."
8116,It is not standard in vaccine trials to test each component separately - one of the reasons vaccines are designed the way they are is to make sure the part that stimulates immune response is around long enough to actually stimulate the response (this has been a big challenge in mRNA-based cancer treatment research - getting it to stick around long enough without just being destroyed by the body almost immediately).
8117,"It is physically impossible for mRNA vaccines to alter your DNA or cause you to ""shed"" mRNA; that's simply not how it works."
8118,The mRNA-based covid vaccines went through the full clinical trial process.
8119,The only reason they have emergency FDA authorization is because of a temporal lack of data due to the newness of both disease and vaccine.
8120,"Now that these data are coming in because enough time has passed, the companies are applying for full approval and all signs point to that being extremely likely (nearly certain)."
8121,"I think there are ethical arguments for and against mandatory vaccination in general, and I'm honestly not sure where I stand on that myself."
8122,"(I am often very glad not to be a bioethicist, or making public health decisions.)"
8123,"But getting a covid vaccine, even an mRNA vaccine, outside of an actual clinical trial is not ""being in an experimental medical trial."""
8124,The vaccines have been fully trialled already.
8125,"Very soon, they'll have full approval, and it will be interesting to see if that leads to an uptick in vaccinations or whether people pivot to a different reason to be reluctant."
8126,So your local fire marshal has shut down every business you've ever been to.
8127,Your definition of shutdown is inaccurate.
8128,Does he live with you?
8129,If so just make him.
8130,"&gt; I think the CDC believes that there’s enough immunity to drop masks

the CDC’s position is you can drop masks *if you’re totally vaccinated."
8131,* which is totally reasonable.
8132,"if everyone wants to react to that in an intentionally unreasonable way, not the CDC’s bad, especially since everyone was being intentionally idiotic before the CDC even said anything."
8133,Modi isn't  under fire.
8134,He's in his new villa.
8135,Prolly not even checking  the news tbh.
8136,LOL K
8137,The german health systems is very decentralized.
8138,All the federal states are brewing their own little soup and every gp does their own odering and scheduling as far as vaccines are concerned.
8139,"Currently ~half of the doses go through gps, and thats supposed to increase again soon."
8140,This does not play nice with ~80% of the population wanting to be vaccinated as fast as possible and leads to frustation as seen above.
8141,"Even so, coming July everyone should have had their first dose (maybe august)."
8142,Facial expressions is not very important for in person learning and it's not like they see everyone with a mask 24/7.
8143,They don't need to see other children without a mask to learn about human facial expression.
8144,"You sound just like these people in this video:
https://youtu.be/LgiWhB2bak8"
8145,"Excuse me, sir, your mask is under your nose."
8146,"What the fuck did you say, nerd?"
8147,"Uhm, your ass looks good in that pose!"
8148,"Good, I thought I wasn't jutting my hips enough!"
8149,Can I go now?
8150,The argument for masking was partially based upon the idea that it's not ok for one person to endanger another by breathing openly in enclosed spaces.
8151,"Now that the vaccine is available, I have a way to protect myself from the virus."
8152,Therefore it is of little consequence to me what other people do.
8153,If they want to risk COVID that is there choice and it does not affect me in any way.
8154,The only problem is there are some people who are not eligible to be vaccinated yet or have a weakened immune system.
8155,They will be protected by herd immunity once vaccination reaches a certain level.
8156,I think a lot of people have gotten used to masks as security blankets and it's understandable why they would hesitate to remove them but the reasoning for the mandates is quickly imploding with every newly vaccinated person.
8157,This post appears to be about vaccines.

That's bad."
8170,"As somebody who lives a very isolated life by choice and who rarely gets colds, I'm pretty sure people are giving masks way more credit than they deserve and not interacting with other people is the primary reason they're not getting sick."

8172,On the other hand?
8173,I still have allergies or something so it hasn't helped me there.
8174,"My eyes are watering, my nose is stuffed."
8175,IDK why all of these other people are suddenly cleared of those.
8176,I mean if you are THAT worried about it just schedule around days off and go J&amp;J if you really are that obsessed.

8182,and didn't regain my voice for  a couple months.
8183,Even breathing function didn't feel 100% for a couple months after.
8184,If you are young and don't have any high risk complications I personally would not be concerned at all having gotten the J&amp;J.
8185,If you are say a 70 year old diabetic with heart problems I might think twice but either way you are very well protected against any severe problems.

8197,I know it’s different elsewhere but man I can’t imagine waking into a Target months ago without a mask.
8198,They never said as much.
8199,"They said that people would likely use masks incorrectly, or expect masks to afford protection that they don't offer, both of which are negative outcomes."
8200,They also implied it would strain manufacturing and impact healthcare mask accessibility.
8201,"They were hesitant to suggest non-mask alternatives, such as cloth based coverings, which further reinforces this misunderstanding."
8202,"Yeah, don’t get me wrong I’m all for destigmatizing masks in the US, and I do believe that will happen in many parts post pandemic."
8203,"(And I think SARS might have been the forcing function to destigmatize this in East Asia, but I might be mistaken.)"
8204,"But from a public health and economic standpoint, better sick leave policies and a culture of declining all social obligations when sick might be more effective."

Seeing how the blood clot formed due to the vaccine has low blood platelet levels, is someone who has lower blood platelets at an increased risk?"

8319,"&gt;Anyway, it's basically impossible that compulsory vaccination will become a thing in Poland."
8320,It would definitely cause nationwide protests.
8321,A more workable scheme would be to allow businesses to card you at the door.
8322,"No shirt, no shoes, no shot, no service."
8323,Keep people out of enough fun/convenient spots and they'll get the vaccination.
8324,&gt;Eliminate capacity controls and other high-impact measures but the mask recommendation was low cost and low impact.
8325,Every expert always said that masks would be the last thing to go because of this.
8326,Aren't capacity controls and other high-impact measures already lifted in most places?
8327,So masks are the last thing to go.
8328,[removed]
8329,"I get that, but specifically regarding my situation, it would involved two fully vaccinated people, alone."
8330,And we both got mRNA vaccines.
8331,Covid will never be gone 100%.
8332,But our chances of getting and transmitting it are decreased by 90-95% - both of us.
8333,"Us meeting without masks is as safe as things can possibly be, and she’s still not open to it."
8334,That’s the problem.
8335,"Yeah, everyone should get the vaccine and I believe that."
8336,I’m not sure how that relates to my comment.
8337,Turns out my dentist is a hesitant.
8338,"I like the hygienist but I told her if the Dr is still unvax'd the next time I need one, I'm gone."

8347,"At one point during the summer, we actually had an armed security guard managing our line that went all the way through the parking lot to get in the store."
8348,He actually slept half the time and didn't give it two shits
8349,Contact a lawyer
8350,They were not sure they would help because they didn't have the data because it iwas a new disease.
8351,"Now they are sure because they have much more data about how the virus acts, where it gets spread and how it gets spread."
8352,Yea.
8353,I can't tell from the link has this been peer reviewed?
8354,I expect a reviewer (if the editor even passed it on to review) would ask exactly that from the authors.
8355,I don't think that's a very reliable way of knowing
8356,Texas actually seems to be ahead of everyone buddy.
8357,0 COVID deaths as seen above
8358,"But on the flip side, there will also be people on the fence who think the announcement means herd immunity has been reached so they don't need to vaccinate anymore."
8359,"I'm not sure if this is going to result in more or less vaccination, never mind more or less transmission."
8360,The increase of anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers is puzzling.
8361,You would think that most of them would have been killed off last year by COVID leaving the pro-science folks to continue the conversation.
8362,"Or, at the very least, the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers would have witnessed a loved one dying from COVID and then changed their tune."
8363,It’s a legit question.
8364,You’re claiming to have been singled out for protection.
8365,Why didn’t others rate?
8366,Beautiful analogy.
8367,[removed]
8368,good
8369,Going forward I will work off the assumption that mask = not vaccinated and no mask = vaccinated
8370,The CDC under Trump tried to get schools to open up with the intention of infecting kids to get it over with.
8371,Haha be quiet.
8372,Nobody has been killed by the Pfizer or moderna vaccines.
8373,None of that conspiracy nonsense.
8374,The US has been very transparent about the blood clots with the J&amp;J vaccine.
8375,What in the heck are you talking about?
8376,"Considering how many workers seem to get violently attacked for mentioning it, probably the only good alternative would be to have armed security."
8377,You’re the one who brought in the political identity part dude.
8378,"You do care what others are doing, if you didn’t it wouldnt be “extremely frustrating” for you as you said above"
8379,The machinations you went through to get to your argument and make your point makes me laugh because it is the same type of dancing a conservative goes through to make their point.
8380,The Policy is following the science.
8381,They would not change the policy without support from the science.
8382,Hes been just 4 months at the helm.
8383,Factories take longer.
8384,I'm unsure on any laws on this but I would urge you to try and get it on your own.
8385,Or enlist an Aunt/Uncle to help.
8386,"I hope I’m not too late— 

I had a patient Friday- 18yo young man, admitted with pneumonia, Covid tested in the ER- negative."
8387,Came down to our floor on night shift.
8388,"I come in and find his O2 sats have dropped to 86% from 97% on room air overnight, he is febrile, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, loss of smell that was not communicated to me in report."
8389,I place 3L on him and get him up to 94%.
8390,"His fingers begin to turn progressively more purple, and while drawing blood from his foot (veins seemed flat regardless of IV hydration), his toes were too."
8391,"I got a D-dimer and Covid swab, CBC w/D, CMP."
8392,"D-dimer came back at 1.56, however platelets were 54."
8393,We gave Enoxaparin 70 mg SQ and sent to CT w/ w/o contrast.
8394,"Negative for PE, positive for Covid."
8395,My question is- did we do the right thing by giving the lovenox?
8396,"We shipped him to a bigger hospital, so i dont know the outcome, however I’m worried he may have been experiencing Thrombolytic Thrombocytopenia."
8397,"Do you typically see elevated D-dimer, low platelets, purple fingers and toes with this type of complication?"
8398,Thank you.
8399,"ETA: his cousin, same age, died of “pneumonia” just two weeks prior."
8400,He presented with symptoms 1 week in duration.
8401,"Hgb/Hct WNL, no white count."
8402,a year later and still with this... bruh
8403,Agreed.
8404,"I'm in California and I'd prefer goals for 7-day average new cases &amp; deaths, hospital capacity &amp; 1st dose vaccinations."
8405,Once we've hit all 4 then you can unmask inside.
8406,Something like that.
8407,That might put on a little peer pressure for more people to get their shots.
8408,Then again everyone's still wearing masks in stores where I've been the last few days.
8409,"I've seen a bit less outdoor masking, but that's it."
8410,That’s a weird way to spell “head”?
8411,?
8412,[deleted]
8413,"Well, nothing in general other than the stinkeye."
8414,"I did watch this dude who was a walking stereotype walk into the store wearing all Murica (sleeveless shirt too, in addition to the goatee and wrap around mirrored sunglasses) and walk in with a mask."
8415,"I happened to be sitting in my car when he walked back out of the store, carrying nothing."
8416,Who goes to the grocery store without buying anything?
8417,The dude was just looking to pick a fight.
8418,I wanna say that was last September.
8419,"Government action is highly unlikely, not in an effective way, the CDC has been giving employers cover to endanger us from day one, and that hasn't changed as much as many hoped when Biden got in there, this disavowel of the mask suggestion a prime example."
8420,"When this thing started, an employer (like mine) could refuse to let you wear a mask, because the CDC didn't admit a respiratory virus is spread through the air, they were forced to admit it spreads in the air, but then still held it's only water droplets and not aerosols, only admitting it after they were forced by that open letter from scientists in the fall."
8421,"Those that can't get vaccinated, and those that trust the wrong people for their information and choose not to, are all just collateral damage to what these politically minded governmental health officials at the CDC see as political expediency, except the ones crying about the masks won't appreciate them for it, it will breed contempt for them bowing to their demands."
8422,[removed]
8423,I did ask.
8424,She doesn’t have allergies.
8425,It’s because she “just wants to be extra safe”.
8426,So she doesn’t trust the science.
8427,"She is paranoid, and that’s the issue."
8428,We have to work to return back to how we were.
8429,"The masks are supposed to be a temporary thing, or for when you’re feeling sick and want to protect others."
8430,"They’re not meant to be forever, to the point where it becomes a handicap since we can’t even break bread together - a very basic form of human connection that you can belittle all you want but does not negate its importance."
8431,"Actually, you don't understand but you did further my point."
8432,Thank you for that.
8433,I could see there being talks with NJ Transit.
8434,"Although CDC still recommends masks on public transit, I could see Memorial Day weekend trains/buses to the airport/beaches crowded enough conductors can’t get through/enforce masks."
8435,But then of course NY is moving forward and they won’t be able to enforce on the subways.
8436,The CDC estimates that the overlap is around or slightly under 50% overlap.
8437,"So if 60% are vaccinated and 30% got it, about 72-75% of the population should have pretty strong immunity."
8438,Only if those students allow themselves to be held back.
8439,I'm a teacher and can confidently say my seniors will be fine.
8440,"They applied themselves this year more than I ever thought they would, and they showed a lot of perseverance and tenacity."
8441,"As long as they bring that into their adulthood, they'll be fine."
8442,It's the middle schoolers whose near entire middle school experience was during a pandemic that I'm more worried about personally.
8443,"And please explain why indoor businesses should not be included in the metaphorical “construction sites”, if mass transit and in-person schools are included?"
8444,&gt;But aren't vaccines a prerequisite for children to be admitted to preschools and elementary schools?
8445,No.
8446,"In fact, kids aren't allowed to get the vaccine, but they are being sent back to school as of today (in my town, anyway)."
8447,[removed]
8448,Franklin Graham came out today and said the vaccine is a good thing and people should get it.
8449,They need to amplify that.
8450,[removed]
8451,Then we start over.
8452,"Even if it weren't for the anti-vaxxers, there are billions of people on the planet that won't get vaccine any time soon."
8453,"Even if you have the money and intent, you just can't vax 8 billion people quickly."
8454,So the virus will find places to spread and mutate.
8455,"And with global air travel, anything popping up someplace will eventually find it's way to everyplace."
8456,We learned a lot about new vaccination development this go around.
8457,It will no doubt get done even faster next time.
8458,It would cut the job in half if they can perfect the single dose method.
8459,And they even have nasal spray vaccines in current trials which they say are doing well.
8460,"I’m in Orange County and I haven’t seen anyone throw a fit about mask wearing in any of the stores I frequent (Walmart, Target, Ralph’s)."
8461,[deleted]
8462,For a lot of us 90 =/= 100.
8463,Or for the JnJ crowd 75=/= 100. the Vaccine works it’s best when everyone gets it.
8464,"it protection is for the community not necessarily for the individual, and we’re only at 56% in the US with the first shot."
8465,were all tired.
8466,I’m tired of getting so close to 0 only for everyone to relax early and cases to go back up and extending it longer.
8467,Motherfockaaa
8468,Lie?
8469,"At what point did you somehow read that, considering I never even implied it?"
8470,"I said ""give us some lead time."
8471,"Coordinate with authorities better."""
8472,"At no point did I even go close to ""lie to people""."
8473,I went through the paper you sent then read its work cited page.
8474,I read the first half of the cited works.
8475,All but one said masks decreases rate of infection from respiratory disease.
8476,"The one that said there was no difference between wearing a mask and not wearing one had a sample size of 36 and only 2 infections the whole time, one in each group."
8477,"So there were like 7 papers showing masks do help and one with a terrible sample size (like shamefully low, if I had tried to turn that into a professor I'd have gotten laughed at low) that said they break even over 8 papers."
8478,Your own sources says they work if you read it.
8479,"Also, yesterday I read a cdc announcement from March 6th 2020 saying non N95 masks help as well."
8480,I noticed you dropped off trying to explain that a virus is smaller than gaseous particles.
8481,Dr fauci's paper on spanish flu doesnt even mention masks once
8482,"This weekend, my dad told me he went to a hardware store without a mask (fully vaccinated), and went into an aisle with a mom and two kids, all wearing masks."
8483,"When she saw him, he said she grabbed her kids and put them behind her and said her kids aren't vaccinated yet so he should leave."
8484,"Nothing wrong with being cautious if that's how you want to be, but don't drag others into it like that."
8485,"Yeah, it puts me in a tough spot."
8486,"He's great at his job and I've been seeing him for multiple years now (minus the past year because I'm not comfortable with video sessions), but I might end up wanting to consider searching for another in this case."
8487,Thank you for the reassurance
8488,The best way to prevent more variants is to get as many vaccines to at risk countries as possible
8489,"Sure maybe they can, but I don’t think anyone would actually WANT to teach with a mask on."
8490,The thought of doing that for a year is pretty insane.
8491,Why?
8492,Cries in Chicago
8493,You are absolutely correct and in New York state they do have the idea is that you need vaccine passport it is called The Excelsior pass.
8494,Perhaps that's what states like New Jersey New York state has a vaccine passport and that way you can do the and Human Services Centers for Disease Control guideline of if you are vaccinated you don't need masks indoors.
8495,How hard is it to wear a mask?
8496,You’re not being punished.
8497,It’s just a mask.
8498,[removed]
8499,[deleted]
8500,This is how both my mom and I have felt recently.
8501,"We both have shitty immune systems [hers is just more shitty because of a condition she has], so we *can't* get vaccinated."
8502,The risk is too great.
8503,"The only consolation I have is that we've only had about 43k cases and around 350 deaths in my entire county at this point, so I can at least pretend I'm at less risk than I would be if I lived in a bigger/denser area."
8504,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My pediatrician said my kids have literally nothing to worry about with respect to COVID."
8505,My divorce attorney told me to get tax advice from a tax attorney.
8506,"Your pediatrician is NOT an expert on this, sorry."
8507,A pediatrician is not an expert in public health.
8508,Discussion on serious adverse events as per FDA briefing document had nothing about clots for the Pfizer vaccine but you can tell they would have reported it if it happened.
8509,"To quote:

In the all-enrolled population of (total N=43,448), the proportions of participants who reported at least 1 SAE during the time period from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (November 14, 2020) were 0.6% in the BNT162b2 vaccine group and 0.5% in the placebo group."
8510,"The most common SAEs in the vaccine group which were numerically higher than in the placebo group were appendicitis (0.04%), acute myocardial infarction (0.02%), and cerebrovascular accident (0.02%), and in the placebo arm numerically higher than in the vaccine arm were pneumonia (0.03%), atrial fibrillation (0.02%), and syncope (0.02%)."
8511,"Occurrence of SAEs involving system organ classes and specific preferred terms were otherwise balanced between treatment groups, including no imbalance overall in cardiovascular serious adverse events."
8512,"Appendicitis was reported as a SAE for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group: 8 vaccine participants ([appendicitis [n=7], appendicitis perforated [n=1]) and 4 placebo participants (appendicitis [n=2], appendicitis perforated [n=1], complicated appendicitis [n=1])."
8513,All of the vaccine participants (n=8) and 2 placebo participants were younger than 65 years of age.
8514,The cases were considered unrelated to vaccination by the study investigators and occurred no more frequently than expected in the given age groups.
8515,FDA agrees that there is no clear basis upon which to suspect that this imbalance represents a vaccine-related risk.
8516,"Three SAEs reported in the BNT162 group were considered by the investigator as related to vaccine or vaccine administration: shoulder injury, ventricular arrhythmia, and lymphadenopathy."
8517,The investigator and the sponsor thought that the shoulder injury was related to vaccine administration.
8518,"Two SAEs in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group were considered by the investigator, but not the Sponsor, as related to study vaccination: shoulder injury (n=1), ventricular arrhythmia in a participant with known cardiac conditions (n=1), and lymphadenopathy temporally following vaccination (n=1)."
8519,"In FDA’s opinion following review of the adverse event narratives, two of these events were considered as possibly related to vaccine: shoulder injury possibly related to vaccine administration or to the vaccine itself, and lymphadenopathy involving the axilla contralateral to the vaccine injection site."
8520,"For lymphadenopathy, the event was temporally associated and biologically plausible."
8521,Good point there but scheduling fucks it over.
8522,One dose on campus but you’ll be home 8 hours away for second dose.
8523,"Doses might be a few days before finals and side effects worries, etc."
8524,You’ll see a lot more uptake during the summer.
8525,Especially because vaccines will likely be required for in person at most colleges.
8526,"I've been through that, but for other things."
8527,They're not worth it.
8528,What countries are they giving them to?
8529,"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html 

115 million people vaccinated, 1136 hospitalized, 223 died."
8530,So maybe a little more than 1 in 1 million but still nearly statistically insignificant.
8531,My uncle contracted it fully vaxxed a few weeks ago.
8532,He immediately had the treatment and felt so much better the next day.
8533,His wife is the president of a hospital network (as well as a former Dr) and thought it was the best course of action for him.
8534,Edit: I will say no one else in that house (all fully vaxxed) contracted it.
8535,Yay!
8536,[deleted]
8537,But unvaccinated sex and drugs is going to lead to a bad time.
8538,You should be fine :) it’s irresponsible of your therapist though but this is the exact situation that the vaccine is made to protect you from
8539,I'm uninterested in your moral preaching when it's couched in your excuses for pandemic profiteering.
8540,"You want a round of applause for letting Israel, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom buy vaccines before your own countries?"
8541,Give me a fucking break.
8542,Real heroes of the pandemic you are.
8543,[deleted]
8544,you can keep on wearing yours.
8545,"But i'll do without mine, thank you."
8546,"If you trust the science behind the vaccines, you'll know that there is a very small chance of me ever infecting someone else with covid."
8547,Most stores will keep on enforcing masks anyway.
8548,"But i'm not wearing it outdoors ""because millions aren't yet vaccinated""."
8549,"They have their guidelines, like i have mine."
8550,Simple as day.
8551,Besides.
8552,None of my friends have kids or are undergoing chemo.
8553,So me wearing a mask outdoors would only be an act of solidarity.
8554,"But since i could care less of anti vaxxers, i'm not going to wear mine anymore"
8555,Correct
8556,"Hahah, you're obviously not from Washington."
8557,"""Vaccinated people do not need masks, but unvaccinated people do, but enforcement is up to the states and local governments"" is far from a mandate to drop mask mandates."
8558,"Heck, keeping a universal mask mandate when you can't prove vaccination status could easily be argued as being pro-science in this situation, due to one of the key parts of the guidance being unvaccinated people absolutely should still wear masks."
8559,I think I recall quite a few reps giving statements to the media they were waiting for OSHA to be okay with the guidance so this is a huge step forward
8560,I work in food service and I agree - It makes it easier and safer to be around food.
8561,I'm planning on wearing a mask all the time still - it's so easy to do.
8562,"Keeps people safer, I'm all for it."
8563,Yea there is a test.
8564,I got one for free by donating blood
8565,"Less likely, but not entirely unlikely."
8566,It really depends on the number of unvaccinated hosts without antibodies.
8567,[deleted]
8568,Hello Dr. Spyropoulos!
8569,You’re doing amazing work!
8570,I am getting my second dose tomorrow and I have heard conflicting reports about risks involving blood clots and women of childbearing age.
8571,I don’t expect it to happen but could you clarify where that perception comes from and if there is any correlation between vaccine thrombosis and the female reproductive system?
8572,(EDIT: I have the Moderna vaccine).
8573,I barely felt this one (though my shoulder sure felt it afterward).
8574,It’s mostly a mental thing for me.
8575,I would prepare for every major chain to drop their mask policy by end of week.
8576,Especially with the new OSHA guidelines matching the CDC recommendations
8577,LA.
8578,Under 50 category opened up April 15th.
8579,"If you were able to get an appointment on day 1, you'd have about 5 weeks until immunity (3 weeks between shots and 2 weeks post)."
8580,So you'd barely be immune now if you were lucky to get an early appointment.
8581,"I just had a Panda Express employee give me a mask, despite their sign saying “in accordance with CDC guidelines” and me informing them that I was fully vaccinated."
8582,"Also, the county health official lifted the “mandate” the day before the CDC announcement"
8583,Tennessee is like 50% compliance
8584,Exactly.
8585,"To reduce the potential for increasing numbers of variants through continuous spread, widespread vaccine adoption is required."
8586,[removed]
8587,I got my J&amp;J vaccine the day that I looked into it within 1 mile of house in CA.
8588,It shouldn’t take that long

8597,What?
8598,Why would you think the estimate is higher?
8599,If anything COVID deaths are inflated by any death not caused by COVID where a person tested positive from it.
8600,it’s an honor system.... must is a strong word
8601,So you want the CDC to lie?

8615,"By being alarmist, you're pushing the latter message and giving rise to naysayers and their rhetoric."
8616,"But by allowing vaccinated individuals more freedom based on the science, the CDC is demonstrating that vaccines are safe and effective, and not just through words."

8624,No difference in company standards/values.
8625,Living life is about mitigating risks while enjoying yourself.
8626,I get that.
8627,Except the premature removal of these safety measures make it harder for strike that balance to reduce risk.
8628,There is no mitigation for unvaccinated kids now.
8629,They took the last options away.
8630,As for herd immunity not protecting my kids...I disagree with you entirely there.
8631,Herd immunity protects unvaccinated people all the time from infectious diseases.
8632,We haven't reached that level yet.
8633,It’s doable but it’s nothing like wearing a cloth mask.
8634,These things are tight.
8635,My sister is a surgeon (I got the masks from her hospital) and even she complains about them all the time.
8636,Easiest to just move it up exactly a year.
8637,"To be fair, Target has pharmacies in many of their stores and can easily arrange for their associates to get a vaccine there."
8638,But Lowes and everybody else should be bending over backwards with accommodations for their staff to get vaccinated.
8639,"Not only is it the right thing to do, but it makes economic sense as well."
8640,A vaccinated employee is less likely to need two weeks off for a Covid scare.

8664,Most people I know couldn’t wait to get the shot and most of them have gotten both by now.
8665,I’m basically going to be surrounded by inoculated people.
8666,Why?
8667,Your kids aren't at risk.
8668,My arm hurt a lot less than the first time.
8669,I did have other symptoms though the second time (fever).
8670,Everyone on my family (Pfizer and Moderna) all said that it hurt more the first time 🤷‍♀️

8677,It's just going to take people some time.
8678,It felt weird the first time I went over to a relative's house to go have dinner once 3/4 of the adults were vaccinated.
8679,It's weird for like 2 minutes and then it's like 2019 again.
8680,"My advice would be to just hang out with them however they feel comfortable and make it clear that you're fine hanging out without masks whenever the feel comfortable, but will wear one if that's how they feel most comfortable."
8681,I suspect they'll relax about it pretty quickly.
8682,Not knowing if you're going to be able to eat does suck though.

8690,You live in one of the hyper speed counties.
8691,I'm not familiar with every area in every state - are cases increasing there as a result of a mask mandate being lifted?
8692,My experience with rural areas is that many of them didn't have a mandate in reality to start with.
8693,The CDC gave health safety information about vaccinated people.
8694,"As near as I can tell, they gave no useful **policy guidance** about what rules should apply in a store or restaurant where there is a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people and no good way to tell them apart."

8702,Newsom overlooks the science to keep needlessly onerous restrictions.
8703,The fact that not everyone has been vaccinated is not relevant.
8704,Im not saying no masks as if you haven't been vaccinated you should keep wearing one.
8705,I'm saying the guidelines should be updated to reflect the data on this who have been vaccinated.
8706,"There will never be zero Covid, or 100% vaccine efficacy, or 100% vaccination rate."
8707,We can’t redefine safe to mean risk-free.
8708,"If you’ve been fully vaccinated, you’re safe, period, regardless of what anyone else does."
8709,"Again, not risk-free, but safe."
8710,What you ultimately do with that info is up to you.
8711,"I sincerely hope you’ll find your ways to live a fulfilling life, but you can’t expect the eradication of risk."
8712,personally i have severe allergies in the spring and summer and the masks dont make it any better.
8713,i guess its a case by case thing.
8714,I waited and am still in the clear now.
8715,Lowest age bracket as well.
8716,i hate the cdc for doing this.
8717,thanks for making customer service workers' lives hell again
8718,Honestly OSHA should skip to the chase and encourage employers to require proof of vaccination to enter the workplace.

8720,Is there an antibody test after receiving the Pfizer  vaccine you can take to see if your immune system had an immune response?
8721,This is for a cancer survivor that has had chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the past.
8722,I get it!
8723,"I’m fully vaccinated, but my mask ain’t going anywhere."
8724,I usually have really bad seasonal allergies.
8725,"Usually, I’ve taken daily Zyrtec or Zyrtec D, depending on the pollen count."
8726,"This year, I’ve taken maybe 3 doses of Zyrtec as a precaution on days with high pollen counts."
8727,All these people who said the masks made it hard to breathe clearly haven’t suffered severe seasonal allergies!
8728,"Mission accomplished in 2 years, but let's stay another 18 years just to be sure."
8729,Diabetes shouldn’t have any effect on vaccine efficacy.
8730,Diabetic people have normal immune systems unless they have another immune condition.
8731,We’re you looking at first doses instead of second doses?
8732,"It’s better to go off of first doses for future predictions, though, because most people with one dose will get their second dose when the time comes."
8733,That’s not what that means.
8734,I feel like we will all be receiving mini booster shots so to speak every time we are exposed.
8735,What's that have to do with it though?
8736,You could walk into a covid filled room without a mask on and still not get covid...you're fully vaccinated it doesn't matter what idiots around you do.
8737,Some would say exceptional
8738,"Yeah, they have as many people as one popular state in the country."
8739,"95% effective means 5% chance of catching covid if exposed, take highly exposed areas and that 5% is very meaningful."
8740,This is going to make a huge difference in vaccine waste.

8743,"Based on today's CDC's numbers, 47.5% of the US is vaccinated, which if we assume your estimate is 50% of overlap, that brings us to 62.5%."
8744,"[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)  


Ultimately the question we should be asking is, if we have truly reached herd immunity, why haven't we seen daily new cases sharply decline like it has in the UK and Israel?"
8745,"Why are we still seeing daily new cases 3X larger than the UK, after normalizing for population size."
8746,"Against Israel, our daily new cases is 25X larger than Israel's, after normalizing for population."
8747,"This tells us we haven't got there yet, else we'd have seen cases plummet just like the UK and Israel."

8749,Last April I shared a meme when the first lockdowns were extended into May that was a picture of Justin Timberlake and it said the next time I see your face ITS GONNA BE MAE and I can't believe that meme ended up being right (albeit a year later than expected)
8750,I honestly don't think the CDC gives a shit.
8751,They washed their hands of the issue and kicked the bucket to someone else for the honor system.
8752,If cases arise it's the responsibility of the last person holding the potato.
8753,Why?
8754,"Unless she has some underlying health issue, assuming she’s 20 years old and healthy the chances of COVID taking her life are incredibly slim."
8755,"Oh I meant in masks aren’t going away for her for quite some time, just a way of life at work now."
8756,Crazy enough she’s spent probably a 1/4 of the past year in an N95 and is still smarter than any four NNN blokes combined.
8757,[removed]
8758,Kinda ruins your hope for man kind a little though
8759,"Yeah, just needs some kind of normal context to it."
8760,"""You wear a mask where you might risk spreading nasty germs""."
8761,Same reason you wash your hands after shitting.
8762,Or wear pants on mass transit.
8763,Yeah sorry your friend didn’t think to call and ask.
8764,Seems like younger folks forget you can phone up a place if you have a question.
8765,"Its a good thing kids are about to be out for the summer, so none of this rambling incoherent stream of consciousness is even relevant."
8766,Everything I’ve been told up until now is that a mask doesn’t protect the wearer nearly as much as it protects people *from* the wearer.
8767,So kids wearing masks doesn’t necessarily solve the issue unless we really trust anti vaxxers to abide by the honor system and wear their masks.
8768,I’ve said in other comments: I think there was a happy medium here where we could keep indoor masking in some essential locations while allowing freedom to vaccinated adults who want to resume a more normal lifestyle in non-essential locations like bars and restaurants and concert venues.
8769,"In the US, children 15 and under have a car accident death rate of 1.5/100000 **for an entire year**."
8770,287 deaths due to covid have been recorded for so far for ages 17 and under.
8771,"With a population of 74 million, that's a death rate of 0.39/100000 for covid so far."
8772,"The odds of dying from a 10 minute car ride are way lower, and you're wrong if you think they're anywhere close."

8808,They just don’t like the idea of taking a vaccine that hasn’t had years of data to show all possible side effects.

8870,Your comment is a straight up lie.
8871,No problem :)
8872,This is somewhat true - but much of the EU has had schools significantly more open than the US and does not have kids &lt;12 mask (generally speaking).
8873,"In addition, even just looking at published case counts, it seems fairly clear to me that the odds of hospitalization given diagnosis are much higher for flu."

8876,It's working having a rise in shots.

8958,"It could still backfire if variants spread here and the vaccine isn't effective enough against them, but it should do more good than harm if vaccinations increase enough to counteract and reverse the rise in potential transmission."
8959,The real danger is if spread increases from reopening/variants and those who don't/can't take the vaccine start catching and spreading it at a high rate- then the only defensible choice will be new restrictions.

9006,I think numbers will steeply drop off.
9007,"But it’s still encouraging to see that whatever our maximum total amount will be, we will reach it soon."
9008,Chicago had fines for not quarantining as well .. it really was culture dependent.
9009,Yep!
9010,We don’t give a crap about the vaccine and you shouldn’t give a crap either because you’re immune right?
9011,Happy cake day!
9012,In Vegas it was definitely enforced 😂😂
9013,Exactly.
9014,Their comment is not practical at all in any public space that will see somewhere between a 40/60 or 60/40 split of people with/ without the vaccination.
9015,We could do passports but people want to equate that with some level of atrocity being carried out by our government.
9016,So until numbers get a little higher I think it's prudent to wait a bit more.
9017,Unlike my state that just went full open and we had a playoff hockey game tonight with a 12k crowd indoors.
9018,They seem to have required masks still (not a state requirement) but that still seems like a petry dish considering we only have like 41% with one dose.
9019,I'm in the southwestern suburbs and I wish I could say the same.
9020,Our state has been struggling to keep up with vaccination rates compared to the rest of the country.
9021,"At one point in time, a single county in our state had become the fastest growing COVID hot bed in the world."
9022,As soon as our city govt said we don't need to wear masks upon being vaccinated people stopped really fucking fast.
9023,It's crazy.
9024,Suddenly everyone stopped wearing their masks.
9025,"Once again, I feel like the odd one out wearing my mask."
9026,I'd be inclined to say that a 50/50 ratio would be a fair assumption.
9027,We have not handed out that many vaccines.
9028,This.
9029,I work in a very crowded public venue.
9030,I am So Tired of management and office staff working from home Zooming in for meetings explaining that they’ve removed or watered down yet another safety protocol that only increases risk to me and my staff.
9031,“We have to” pfft.
9032,They’d be a heckuva lot more concerned if they were expected back in the building.
9033,"But no, they just decided to extend their work-from-home until September..."
9034,"Unless you have evidence that says the mRNA vaccines have killed someone, I’m going to believe that they haven’t."
9035,I actually don't blame California for waiting until they can drop all masks at once.
9036,"While I'm glad that my state changed their mandate, it has caused a lot of confusion where some businesses still require them, some don't, and in my work's case they only require them for employees at the moment (although now that OSHA has weighed in hopefully they'll change that)."
9037,"It's more a practical decision than a scientific one, but that's a valid choice for a state to make."
9038,That’s because we never test for RSV because it usually just looks like a mild cold.
9039,We test more for COVID than any other disease.
9040,"Even more so, RSV isn’t a “reportable” disease, so most aren’t recorded at a national level."
9041,"From the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html#f1
&gt; Each year in the United States, RSV leads, on average, to approximately—
2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old

9085,"I obviously see what you're saying, but I think one of the problems ""vax hesitant"" people might have is *that* the discussion is so one sided, it can feel like an agenda."
9086,When people are disparaged for having another opinion or questioning something it only makes things worse.
9087,"While the fear of getting the vaccine might not be medically sound, it's at least understandable, and addressing people's fears is often more effective than just saying ""we should not even explore the other side of the coin""."
9088,"Obligitory: I've received my first shot, awaiting my second, not anti vax etc."
9089,I would argue the flu is actually worse for children.

9182,"By golly, Ima gets 50 doses - those tendies are mine."
9183,I need some more Doge
9184,Well depending on your age you could go behind their backs
9185,[removed]
9186,Thanks...
9187,I agree with you brother.
9188,Then you have more to worry about than covid
9189,"I'd be leery of the study ""outside of work"" when there are so many Healthcare organizations reliant on their nurses not having contracted covid on site for legal reasons..."
9190,Especially considering just how unprepared they were to provide adequate PPE.
9191,"Uh, most new deaths is a clear and obvious reflection of who is dying there NOW."
9192,"You can spin things by trying to average in the first half of 2020 (which is what overall death stats do), but that doesn’t tell us shit about what’s happening right now."
9193,The state that leads the nation in the most deaths weekly is either more populous than any other state or is in a very bad place indeed.
9194,Only a dozen of dimentia-ridden people in an asylum called National Diet Building.
9195,I feel so sorry for everyone who lives in Japan now.
9196,"both good ideas, i messaged them for you"
9197,"It didn't take long for the ""America Bad"" articles to start to resurface."
9198,"That's great news for Canada, I'm just not sure why the US needed to be mentioned in the headline."
9199,[deleted]
9200,The politician is pointing out that the majority of the state is not fully vaccinated and this guidance doesn't even apply to them right now....
9201,[removed]
9202,The narrative of being behind was based on numbers.
9203,They had one job...
9204,the idiots are you that think these new variants are actually going to amount to anything.
9205,no one is getting sick from this anymore man.
9206,the economy cant wait for this shit to play out any longer than it has.
9207,god you are such a fucking dweeb lol
9208,All I can hope is that 100% of the people who get sick are anti-vaxxers.
9209,"Natural selection will get rid of empathy-lacking cretins, for once."
9210,Good luck to them.
9211,You take masks away there's no fucking way I'm getting on a plane.
9212,I'd rather they go the other way and then I'd feel comfortable flying.
9213,Require vaccines!
9214,"I saw a poll a month ago that claimed 80% of Canadians want to get vaccinated, which is pretty great considering the misinformation being spewed these days."
9215,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9216,Because we’ve created a culture of fear and safetyism.
9217,"Look, I’ve been in team safety since day one."
9218,"I was glad they closed schools, I was ok with the lock downs, and I’ve masked since the beginning of the pandemic."
9219,Mainly because I “followed the science”.
9220,"And mainly because we did not know how bad kids would get infected or how badly it would spread through schools, etc."
9221,But now we DO know a lot about the virus.
9222,It doesn’t affect kids like it does adults.
9223,"The vaccinated are at very, very low risk to contract and spread COVID."
9224,We know surface spreading is unlikely.
9225,"We know outdoor transmission is extremely rare, etc."
9226,“follow the science” means adjusting your views based on the new evidence and some people just don’t want to change their position based on that.
9227,"We are getting a steady supply of vaccines now, not using the az shots isn’t the problem he’s making it out to be, earlier on he would have been correct however."
9228,As if they can punish them all...
9229,[removed]
9230,The idea has been floating around epidemiologist Twitter
9231,I'm not really sure what sort of prep would be needed for this change.
9232,its sad we have to bribe people to get a vaccine
9233,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9234,lol its over buddy.
9235,"if you’re still this scared of catching covid at this point, you probably shouldnt leave your house ever again."
9236,What exactly leads people to have such a ridiculously poor understanding of how responsibility works?
9237,If I get sick it's on me?
9238,"Except it's not, it's on whoever had the sickness and didn't take precautions."
9239,"I know society has normalized being sick and not doing anything about it, but if you just look at it from an emotionless CAUSAL perspective, I only get sick because of someone else, it isn't just magic."
9240,It's...it's a fucking mask.
9241,Just...who cares.
9242,Who gives a shit.
9243,Just wear the fucking mask for a couple more months.
9244,It's a fucking...it's a goddamn mask.
9245,Jfc wtf
9246,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9247,"A couple of takeaways:

* Hispanic and Black adults are more likely than their White counterparts to report concerns about missing work to get or recover from the COVID-19 vaccine."
9248,* Nearly three in ten (28%) employed adults who [are] not yet ready to get the vaccine say that they would be more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine if their employer gave them paid time off to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects
9249,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9250,"For those not reading: he said the majority of New Jerseyans are not fully vaccinated and since businesses are unable to check for vaccinations, it's not fair to put the burden on them."
9251,"He's just taking at least two weeks to reassess that they are going in the right direction and when he does lift it, it'll be for a range if reasons."
9252,It's not a hard no to opening up.
9253,"Honestly, he's being super reasonable and rational, but people are acting like he shot a puppy"
9254,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9255,In other words… conservative states with representatives who downplayed the Virus?
9256,"Nobody:

Redditor: I am gonna mask until 2029."
9257,It’s soooooooooo fun!
9258,I don’t even have to wash my face anymore!
9259,"Yes, yes you are"
9260,"Yeah, this is what people don't understand."
9261,"After the fact, the lockdown looks like the only course of action, but at the time of implementation it was highly controversial."
9262,"Ironically, if the pandemic didn't get out of control in many other countries, it'd be still condemned to this day."
9263,And likewise if they locked on Jan 5th before they got significant number of cases.
9264,Honestly masks (and vaccines) should be required for airplanes and always should have been.
9265,Some have.
9266,I'm assuming there are some studies looking at children and that a pediatrician would try to stay up to date with the more important ones.
9267,And expertise means that you understand and are knowledgeable on a topic.
9268,You can still be an expert on a newly established field
9269,"Shopping alone is a pretty asocial activity that also has strangers all around you, so I can see that being one of the places where masks remain for decent amount of time, along with transit."
9270,[removed]
9271,&gt; it would have been fairly inexpensive to make sure everyone finishing quarantine (instead of just migrant workers) got tested.
9272,"Wow, I had no idea they weren't even testing everyone in quarantine!"
9273,"In NZ everyone in quarantine has to have 4 tests, one before they arrive at the airport for their flight, one on arrival, one at day 3 in MIQ and a final one on day 12."
9274,"They may have been catching most cases before, but this outbreak shows exactly the danger of not testing the community widely."
9275,The idea in NZ is that constant community surveilance testing and wastewater testing will let us know there is community transmission well before it reaches hundreds of cases a day.
9276,Hot vax summer
9277,I’d just like to expand on this dudes comment and say if this sub is really being “brigaded” please let me in on how you get paid to do that all day online.
9278,Sounds like either a conspiracy theory or a sweet side gig.
9279,[removed]
9280,I can't hold it against him but unfortunately he was doing something high risk or incorrectly if he caught it at some point so his method is flawed.
9281,Which I can't necessarily fault him for as infection controls protocols are difficult to follow.
9282,One mistake doffing and now you're at risk.
9283,All that HIPPA may mean in this context is that your doctor or health insurance can’t give your vaccination status to your employer without your consent.
9284,this year of wfh has been amazing for the fact that i didn't have to attend office potlucks
9285,"We were ""behind"" though."
9286,"Or... Had a slow start at the very least, compared to some other countries."
9287,Shipments didn't really start to ramp up until beginning of April and now we're rolling full steam.
9288,"I honestly think they'll start moving the second doses up, because the shipments are set to increase even more in the coming weeks."
9289,I was thinking about this in a sense here &amp; there last year in connection with the 2008/9 recession putting a damper on 2 cohorts' entire financial trajectory due to less opportunities &amp; lower wages vs people who graduated a few years earlier or later.
9290,Missing out on compound interest from the beginning can really hurt later on.
9291,"This time around, it's both missing financial and social connections."
9292,I don't think there really is a way to make up for that lost time either.
9293,"2020 graduates will be competing with 2022/2023 graduates for jobs, etc."
9294,I might be wrong but I think it's like businesses saying you're trespassing.
9295,It's their right to say you can't enroll or live in the dorms.
9296,State schools can't tell people not to walk on campus though.
9297,Please correct me if I'm wrong.
9298,"We don’t have enough data to truly say it’s seasonal and from what I’ve researched, there seem to be a lot of factors involving seasonal changes with COVID."
9299,"You say more people are indoors in the winter time, but people here spend a ton of time indoors in the summer when it’s hot...so that doesn’t seem like a strong argument :/"
9300,"Somehow we, the mask wearers now make everyone angry."
9301,It’s an interesting sociological phenomena.
9302,CDC didn’t cite any new studies when they changed guidance last week.
9303,I feel the masks actually made my allergies worse.
9304,"Please seek mental help, you are brainwashed and living in needless fear"
9305,We don’t have RSV or Flu around because of Covid.
9306,"If there was no covid then yea indeed, there would be millions of active RSV and other respiratory illnesses, especially during the winter."
9307,This post appears to be about vaccines.

9322,"To be fair, if you compare Taiwan’s number to Chinese provinces, it is pretty mediocre."
9323,&gt;... if you think you’re part of some small group here you’ve missed a lot of news.
9324,"I was actually thinking of a post I saw here by someone who had the observation that the view that Americans were all being irresponsible is incorrect &amp; kinda smacks those who cancelled their last year in order to be responsible (in contrast to, for example, the biker rally in the Dakotas IIRC)."
9325,"However, they did a better job and mine just comes off as whiny."
9326,Sorry about that.
9327,"Besides, I'm kinda anti-social anyhow so most of the year wasn't a big deal."
9328,"Sure I want to get out, but there are people far more deserving of sympathy - I don't think I deserve any if I had to be honest - and far more affected."
9329,I'm thinking of people like the parents of some friends who are in their 80s.
9330,They literally don't have much time left and their health has measurably deteriorated in the last year.
9331,They probably still have a few good years - probably - but they can count them on their hands.
9332,"Or hand, perhaps."
9333,For them and others like them the loss is immense.
9334,"Plus the rates are higher than they were this time last summer, even if they are lower than they were last week."
9335,Somehow that doesn't seem to matter...
9336,[deleted]
9337,"Again, this isn't about vaccinated individuals."
9338,"It's about enforcing masks for the unvaccinated, which isn't possible, and indoor spread continues to be a problem."
9339,I'm pretty sure you're incapable of rationalizing that simple fact.
9340,"So yeah, maybe talk less, stop making unverified claims and go get vaccinated."
9341,good luck.
9342,"Through the door, sure."
9343,My experience has been once inside no one said/did shit about masks.
9344,"&gt;You got a few with their noses sticking out but otherwise masked

So not masked."
9345,The mask protects others not yourself
9346,"Vaccines don't offer complete protection, though in this specific case it reduces the severity of the infection."
9347,It is still possible for your household to get infected and spread it on to others.
9348,It is also a big problem for those that can't receive the vaccination.
9349,"All around, it sucks that we have such a self centered and ignorant population."
9350,You don't know this with any certainty.
9351,Don't be a tool or part of the problem.
9352,[removed]
9353,"I'm from Nevada and we don't need conflate the 'risk taking behaviors"" of Las Vegas with the complete idiocy of those who choose not to vaccinate."
9354,Take my upvote in good spirit.
9355,:)
9356,This is a bit of a double edged sword.
9357,Outdoor masking (along with generally staying indoors) has lead to my being more sensitive to seasonal allergens.
9358,I’m in the process of slowly reintroducing myself to the raw outdoors.
9359,As they should
9360,"Nah, my local Target definitely did."
9361,Mask-patrol at the front of the store would hand masks to any mask less people or ask them to leave
9362,"Online Grocery Pickup, we are the people shopping all day with the big blue carts full of totes."
9363,I hope he's right.
9364,Really hoping cases are so low kids don't need them soon.
9365,I'm in NZ and we have the same elimination strategy as Taiwan.
9366,But from day one we have been told it is vital to have thousands of tests every day.
9367,That's a vital part of maintaining elimination.
9368,Anyone with even slight cold or flu symptoms is urged to have a test.
9369,We have never had a problem with false positives.
9370,It's the new argument.
9371,"""We must open up!"
9372,"But, also, I don't want anyone to be able to prove I'm vaccinated!"""
9373,[removed]
9374,This seems like the type of thing that would be periodic training since people eventually forget.
9375,Seems wasteful use of an employees time when you can cram it in last minute once it gets announced.
9376,Get vaccinated because your life depends on it.
9377,"I go to 3 different targets here in the Twin Cities (one in Saint Paul, two out in the suburbs where I work)."
9378,All three have had a “greeter” inside the door since last summer saying hello and checking for masks.
9379,Target has been enforcing mask mandates more than pretty much anywhere else I’ve seen
9380,I’ll give you 2-1 that they are open.
9381,I wish more states would do something like Ohio is doing.
9382,"Even something like the state I’m in (Washington) where we can open up everything no restrictions before the set date (6/30) if we get 70% of the population with a first dose doesn’t seem like it’s going to be enough of a carrot 

i think more states doing *SOMETHING* like Ohio is doing would go a long way"
9383,I think of it this way.
9384,Masks have a huge positive impact during the pandemic.
9385,They'll have a smaller positive impact after the pandemic.
9386,"Still positive, though."
9387,I'd be an idiot to criticize someone for taking advantage of that.
9388,"Like, do I criticize people for wearing mittens just because I usually don't?"
9389,The anti-mask league and the anti-vax people *killed* thousands of Americans.
9390,They suck.
9391,Their impact was extremely negative.
9392,Small positive impact versus huge negative impact.
9393,Why even compare the two?
9394,"Yep, or if you mention kids."
9395,"Every time I mention that kids under 12 exist and can’t get vaccinated yet, it’s downvotes and “kids don’t get that sick” and “keep your kid home then!” Some kids do get very sick and I don’t think that’s a chance worth taking when we have something as simple and easy as masks to prevent it."
9396,And I don’t even have young kids.
9397,I’m just an elementary teacher that doesn’t want to see my students get sick.
9398,People legit forget NJ just opened up eligibility on April 19th- the largest group yet is still in the process of getting vaccinated
9399,[removed]
9400,"Like I get it, but work stop requiring the masks and I can’t go back to wearing it 8 hours a day."
9401,"I got the shot, my friends did, and there isn’t anyone at home at risk."
9402,"So the only places left in town requiring masks, are Kroger and the doctors office, and that’s the only places I’m wearing one."
9403,[removed]
9404,And what if they refuse?
9405,Tie them down and force them to get it?
9406,Throw them in jail?
9407,Wahhhhh
9408,As we should
9409,This is not correct whatsoever.
9410,The risk of death from coronavirus is massively higher than from vaccination in all arge groups.
9411,It's not even remotely close.
9412,The stats you cited are wrong.
9413,"As I said below, I am very lax and super open and understanding of my staff coming to me for a mental day off."
9414,I have no problems breaking the rules to help out my people.
9415,This guy has had many complaints about coming to work sick
9416,What would enforcement look like though?
9417,Staff arguing with them?
9418,Security escorting them out?
9419,Anti maskers yelling in staff’s faces?
9420,Assaulting them?
9421,The police being called?
9422,It’d just escalate the situation and put people who work there at more personal risk for physical harm and honestly infection from COVID.
9423,That’s why the policy is to not enforce strictly
9424,"Just look at half the sources you post, pathetic examples of journalism or you just don’t read them."
9425,"Feel sorry for you, hope your lack of critical thinking skills is like, working out for you."
9426,Try to find happiness yo
9427,Exactly this.
9428,"I can choose to work for a few hours in the morning, then go grab some breakfast, do a few more hours, do some laundry, exercise, chill or whatever and work a bit later in the day."
9429,My start time is about 7.30am and my finish time is about 7pm now but I have multiple large breaks throughout the day to rejuvenate and enjoy some sunlight.
9430,"When I worked in the office, I’d do 7.30am until 4pm straight, get home and be too exhausted to do anything except lay on the sofa and browse Reddit for hours on end."
9431,"Those healthcare workers practically wear full hazmat suits too, plus gloves and eyewear."
9432,MUCH more than just masks.
9433,[removed]
9434,Plus some percentage who have already had COVID and have some kind of resistance to it now.
9435,I’m doing that even though I’m fully vaxxed because that seems the polite thing to do.
9436,But in another month I plan on going maskless in the stores that allow it.
9437,"I respect their property rights and if they still require a mask mid June, I will comply."
9438,"But at the same time, I know I’m good."
9439,Would’ve been good to know for my 18yo friend who drove 3 hours each way to get his second dose back in April.
9440,I feel for you.
9441,That vaccine was a huge relief for me as I don't feel like I am risking my own life anymore at work.
9442,If the vaccine is significantly compromised enough I don't know it would be worth working anymore.
9443,"I have health insurance at my work, but it's not worth it if I still end up dying anyways from work."
9444,Scott Gottlieb (whose been pretty good with predictions) said he foresees the threat Covid poses in the US being small enough that basically nobody is masking by some point in June
9445,It’s the CDC...they are the science.
9446,K bit cancer survivors and other high risk people are boned indefinitely.
9447,We are only 37% vaccinated in my state
9448,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm#danger

The cdc notes that the flu deaths is a likely undercount and estimates the number to be 600."
9449,Edit: also 25% of youth do get vaccinated for flu.
9450,So that’s a quarter who have at least some protection
9451,I’m 90% sure at this point that if you name any negative thing that happens to the human body they’ll say the vaccine causes it
9452,[removed]
9453,"I don't know, sounds like you're a bit if a narc."
9454,Let him be and under those days could be for a mental health or other more personal reason.
9455,I always do every time.
9456,Maybe I’m a bit pessimistic but it’s kept me alive this far being more careful rather than less careful.
9457,Make an appointment with a pharmacy anywhere convenient.
9458,It is very easy.
9459,"I am against masks and against taking the vaccine, and I completely agree with this statement."
9460,I never wanted your protection
9461,"Who has virtually no health risks from Covid, unless they have a pre-existing condition."
9462,In which case they will need to take precautions normal people don’t.
9463,Also likely based on availability of treatment facility space as well.
9464,"Remember, masking and social distancing were to MINIMIZE INFECTION RATES in order to ensure enough treatment availability, not necessarily to stop the spread of the virus."
9465,Not the guy you responded to but if you're talking about chili joints [this is a pretty good list](https://wandercincinnati.com/2020/06/25/best-chili-cincinnati/).
9466,I haven't been to all of them but I've heard of them all from various people they all have something different to offer as far as atmosphere.
9467,Just depends where you're staying and what vibe you're looking for.
9468,"And it would be great if we could convince morons to get vaxxed, but we both know the chances of that are slim."
9469,"Most variants are likely to arise from communities around the globe with poor access to vaccines, anyhow."
9470,"If we continue to wait for antivaxxers, we'll never get out of the purgatory we're in."
9471,"Instead, sane Americans are protected today, and we can expect booster shots to help against variants in the future"
9472,Society didn’t decide that...the CDC and science decided that workers lives *arent* at risk if fully vaccinated customers decide to go maskless in your store.
9473,"And even if unvaccinated people also go maskless in your store, as long as you yourself are vaccinated, and wear a mask if you so choose, you have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning twice in a row than you do of  contracting covid."
9474,If that’s not low enough risk for you I’m not sure what else you want us to do.
9475,You perform more dangerous tasks on your way to and from work than your chance of contracting and/or getting seriously ill from covid if you are fully vaccinated.
9476,They say they don’t want it... but they’ll get it.
9477,"Not saying you’re wrong, just an observation."
9478,"Its funny that whenever someone points out pro China content upvoted or anti-china content downvotes  and the first response is that China, and TenCent, have invested in Reddit and heavily curate what ends up on the front page, and manipulate votes, but then when people ask why pro China content is downvoted or anti-China content is upvoted, the response is that there’s an anti-china bias in the west."
9479,"I see it both ways, it’s like nothing China related can exist without it being someone’s ulterior motive"
9480,Anyone know how I can convince my friend to get the shot?
9481,She’s been on the fence for the longest time now
9482,"You missed my point,  There were no zero deaths."
9483,Published data for Texas today (Monday) is 28 deaths.
9484,Yesterday closer -- 3 deaths.
9485,And that on a day the reporting people aren't working.
9486,"If people are going to yell ZERO DEATHS in the headlines, don't you think there should actually have been zero deaths?"
9487,It's common practice in other parts of the world to wear masks during allergy and influenza seasons.
9488,It's not that weird to wear masks.
9489,It really is stunning how politicized masks are in the US.
9490,"My first trip into a big store maskless you could tell who else was also having their first maskless trip since the mandates kicked in 

Like a deer in headlights trying to decide how to navigate without a mask and physical-distancing optimized movement patterns"
9491,You should worry less about how other people protect themselves.
9492,"You can easily just cancel the second dose appointment if they make you make them both at the same time, and then schedule a new one at a different location."
9493,It’s not elegant but also not hard.
9494,&gt;Vaccinated people are nearly entirely immunized at this point.
9495,Until all the unvaccinated create another mutation that we're not immunized against 😕

9497,So people are smug for smiling because for the first time in over a year they don’t have to wear masks in Target?

9507,Good news and if you are wondering what date this was done it was actually Friday May 14th when Phil Murphy announced this on his  stop at East Orange Shoprite for a vaccination Drive campaign.
9508,On his tweets indoor Mask mandate cannot be lifted due to the fact and New Jersey hasn't reached a critical point in the vaccinations to when it can be lifted.

9533,"I'll just keep wearing mine, thanks"
9534,I think the key part is at this point.
9535,For those of us who have to go into work every day getting the vaccine was a huge relief.
9536,But if something were to break through the vaccine or if the vaccine's protection wore off before boosters could be produced all of us would be back to risking our lives while working.

9562,"That's weird to me that you've never seen a Safeway or whole foods, but then again I didn't even know what Kroger's was so Shrug."
9563,"Well, I suppose they have the right to not get the vaccine but (unless they can't get the vaccine for medical reasons) I have no sympathy for them if they get COVID and it makes them sick."
9564,This is why it’s insane the cdc came out like that
9565,Oh ffs there is essentially no risk to children.

9587,"If you want the ad hominem attacks to stop, maybe consider cutting out the bad faith bullshit arguments that ignore causality and basic scientific principles that most of us learned in junior high.)"

9618,"Here's what you seem to be saying:  ""Flu is more dangerous to kids when we take no precautions against either it or Covid""

That's not true either, by the way:  COVID has killed more kids in its 1 year run than Flu did in any of the previous 3 years (during which, I will remind you, mask use was not common)

Can I schedule a Johnson and Johnson vaccine instead of the other 2?"
9635,I’m in New York I’d rather a one shot then wait a full month to be fully vax
9636,You know everything else is ending on the 15th too right?
9637,Like pre-covid in one month with no real spread anymore...Seems pretty reasonable to me.
9638,"They should have given the vaccines to poor countries first, then done the rich ones last or everyone at the same time."
9639,People need to share.
9640,Hogging is selfish.

9643,Nobody forced anyone to go into the store.
9644,Don't have anything helpful to add but I am in exactly the same boat and sympathize with you.
9645,I have major vaccine envy and I'm pissed that I got the first vaccine available instead of waiting a week or two for an mRNA vaccine.

9649,Wow.
9650,Sooo..
9651,I just had my full blown re-introduction to maskless life.
9652,Went to a high school graduation.
9653,"Large, well ventilated auditorium at local college."
9654,"Signs on door, text on program ""masks required!"""
9655,I'm fully vaxed.
9656,Have been for a couple of months.
9657,"So is husband, MIL &amp; Dad."
9658,I trust this vaccine.
9659,I've been waiting for a fully vaxed change in guidance.
9660,I still have to wear one at work (&amp; require customers to do so) but no local mandate.
9661,I've been ready.
9662,"In fact, I'm traveling to Mexico in 1 week because...it's time &amp; I'm vaxed."
9663,I was fully unprepared to walk into an auditorium of 300+ppl and see maybe 25 masks.
9664,"I *know* all those people are not even partially, much less fully vaxed."
9665,I think we show just under 27% in our parish (county equivalent for non-Louisiana ppl.)
9666,"I'm not gonna lie, there were a couple of moments of anxiety."
9667,"My Dad masked up, but the rest of us did not."
9668,I thought about so much of the info that has been given &amp; shared here.
9669,I was able to easily relax and enjoy the moment.
9670,It was much like jumping into a freezing pool vs wading in..or ripping off a bandaid vs peeling it slowly.

9691,"Unless you're actually implying that businesses are going to have ""bouncers"" at their front doors checking everyone's vaccination record."
9692,Pretty much everyone (within eligible groups) who hasn't been vaccinated at this point isn't planning on getting vaccinated and was probably anti-mask from the beginning.
9693,They've either gone maskless this whole time or have only worn one for the sake of compliance and now we're just giving them an excuse to stop wearing one.

9698,I'm on the west coast so most everyone I know is vaxxed and still masking - although there are a few groups in more rural areas that tend to be anti-vaxx.

9708,Pretty much.

9722,My gym never had a mask mandate.
9723,People underuse all the blocking features in every social media app.
9724,I wonder if people doing that is skewing with the data around people returning for a second shot.
9725,Like mega site is reporting person A never came for shot 2 but person A got shot 2 at CVS.
9726,Im curious how much these sites are talking and sharing info.
9727,Or maybe that the US has reopened up a bit (actually a lot) too quickly compared to countries that have even higher rates of vaccination like the UK or Israel.
9728,"But no, you need 100% capacity, maskless, indoor events because the pandemic's over now."
9729,People under 18 in general have virtually zero risk without the vaccine.
9730,"With it they can still contract and transmit, not a major deal unless they have an underlying condition that pits them at risk."

9736,Thank u this is perfect
9737,Meijer lifted their mandate today.
9738,It's not going to be available til 2023 though...wonder why that is
9739,In my area not a single cop wore a mask during lockdowns and after.
9740,I would hate to be the cop who shows up not wearing a mask and has to kick out someone who doesn't want to wear a mask.
9741,I guess that's why the police eventually stated they won't be enforcing it.
9742,At home?

9748,We were at about 90% for a bit.
9749,Then it went to like 75%.
9750,For a few months it’s been around 50/50 except sometimes it was definitely like 30% masking sometimes.

9763,With how contagious covid is Id guess a few months until we get there.
9764,The only thing that will slow it down is it being summer and most people being outside.
9765,Yeah.
9766,[39 - 56 million people](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) got the flu in 2019-2020 in the US so there was always lots of virus activity that the immunocompromised had to take into account.
9767,Whatever they did before should still work now.
9768,I assume you're laughing with happiness because we now have a tool (vaccines) that is so effective that the CDC and practically every state health department is confident we don't even need to continue masking in order to prevent ICUs from being overrun with covid patients again!

9791,Also unmasked unvaccinated people walking around makes people who can’t get vaccinated at greater risk.

9815,"It also usually takes a long time for enough people to get infected and prove efficacy, but that stage goes much quicker in a pandemic."
9816,We got the vaccines as quick as we did because many governments turned on the money shower and guaranteed to cover companies costs even if their product failed.
9817,I don’t think there’s ever been so many people and companies all working on the same goal of getting a vaccine to stop the pandemic.
9818,"There‘s well over a hundred Covid vaccines being developed, only a few have been approved for use so far."
9819,Congrats my partner still has to wait til the end of the week after searching endlessly for vaccine availability.
9820,2 more fucking weeks would have saved thousands of lives.
9821,So stupid honestly.
9822,You don’t catch a car accident by merely being and breathing in the same room as somebody else.
9823,Avoiding car accidents is something that is well mitigated by your own behavior.
9824,Can’t say the same about COVID.
9825,"Also, driving can be a touchy topic when you have kids."
9826,"I will absolutely not let my dad drive my kids, for instance."
9827,Imagine if Ohio used that money to buy vaccines for countries who can't afford the vaccine.
9828,Situations like what is happening right now in India could be minimized; instead the money can be blown by some Buckeye who should have gotten the vaccine without being bribed.
9829,[deleted]
9830,OK I am not shopping there.
9831,Anyone else hoping masks become normal now?
9832,I know a lot of people have the vaccine by now but I’d love for it to become the norm to where a mask when your sick or during flu season.
9833,Not getting sick for the past year has been very nice
9834,Here in Ontario Canada  we have plenty of morons doing dumb shit to make covid worse.
9835,But in public places anywhere in the greater Toronto area they would 100% call the cops every time.
9836,I won’t see one person in a store maskless anywhere I go for groceries or anything else.
9837,At the beginning there were some anti maskers going nuts to avoid it but after it consistently got people pulled out of stores by police long enough you never see it anymore except for the occasional jackass who pulls it down under his nose.
9838,I think you're being alarmist but a lot of people I respect would agree with you so who knows really?
9839,We'll have to wait and see how it all plays out.
9840,It's kind of exciting to watch all unfold while also excruciatingly slow and boring to wait for it to unfold.
9841,They need to make a Forest Gump type movie about this part of history.
9842,Just summarize and capture the zeitgeist  of the covid years while telling an unrelated story.
9843,I was hopeful we would start to see updates on this!
9844,It was the incentive I was most interested in tracking
9845,"I understand your point…and I have this convo a lot with friends and family when trying to convince them to get vaccinated, especially those that are high risk."
9846,"The biggest rebuttals include:
1."
9847,"Lack of FDA-approval
2."
9848,"Extensive push and bribes for ppl to be vaccinated 
3."
9849,"Big Pharma corruption like phizer, moderna
4."
9850,"Lack of long term vaccine study
My mindset is to not push anything on them and maintain a clear and science based debate."
9851,"Automatically pinning them as anti vax doesn’t help, they take offense and the discussion is over."
9852,Any advise or tips are welcome!
9853,meijers just dropped it
9854,We know more about side affects from these vaccines than most others simply because of the speed and scale of initial deployment.
9855,"Multi year studies are not about long term side affects, study sizes are too small to recognize or maybe even experience incredibly rare things, its about how long protection lasts, that doesn't really matter if you're getting another shot at a year."
9856,So their concern comes from a place of lack of understanding.
9857,Youre not crazy.
9858,Youre just being a safe parent.
9859,Its hard to know what thw right thing to do is.
9860,I won’t lose any sleep over the deaths of anti-vaxxers.
9861,"If that makes me a bad person
So be it"
9862,I think a huge part in the big thirst for vaccines has been the very long lockdowns in places like Ontario.
9863,"We are still in a stay at home order with virtually nothing open/happening, and it’s been like for the majority of the past year."
9864,People just want this to end as soon as possible and go for a beer on a patio.
9865,I feel like so much of America has been so flippant with restrictions for so long that people on the fence about vaccines see no real change being manifested from them and therefore just don’t care to get it.
9866,No we don’t.
9867,Idk where the fuck they get these numbers from
9868,"In the US at least, in early Feb 2020 it wasn't in the public consciousness really yet."
9869,"The last time I flew was for my birthday at the *end* of February last year and out of the hundreds (hell maybe thousands) of people I saw at the airports, there were only like two that were wearing a mask."
9870,"*Early* February most people might not have even known there was anything even going around at all, and you certainly would have stood out like a sore thumb wearing a mask."
9871,"I see, it makes me the ""other""

Keep up the group think and we'll find out who the dumbass really is."
9872,[removed]
9873,"Pennsyltucky, I'm really not that surprised tbh there was intense pushback from the start about masks."
9874,"My family and I all got the vaccine though, that is the only thing that is under my control and thus all I should worry about."
9875,"It sucks because I know a some of the anti-vaxxers are good people who have just been misled, but there isn't much I can do."
9876,Karma just called and said she's on her way.
9877,And she was PISSED.
9878,"I’m still wearing a mask in most places even though I’m vaccinated, besides most people are wearing them anyway so I don’t want dirty looks"
9879,The kind of kid that makes you afraid to have kids because they're destined to be a loser *shudder*
9880,We're monkeys.
9881,[removed]
9882,The anti-vaxxers are fucked
9883,I had that mentality from the beginning.
9884,"If I get sick, it's on me, if you get sick, it's on you."
9885,"I can't do anything to stop you getting sick, I can only stop myself from getting sick, and I get to choose the measures I take to insure my own health."
9886,&gt;That's not really how it works.
9887,"People see the 94% and think 'each person has a 94% chance to not get sick', but it's really 'in a population, 94% of people won't get sick'."
9888,"More precisely, it means that your odds of getting COVID are reduced by 94% from your baseline odds of getting it before you got the vaccine."
9889,"100% of the population hasn't gotten COVID, not even close."
9890,"If, for the sake of argument, you assume that your baseline chance of catching COVID was 1% just living your life during the pandemic without being vaccinated, that means that you have a 0.006% chance of getting COVID after being vaccinated."
9891,Yes!
9892,Same!
9893,I have lung scarring and reduced capacity already though so I think that plays into it.
9894,I was never any to wear one while exercising outside for long no matter how hard I tried (and I was always alone anyway).
9895,The problem with the people lying is that there is many things that this can effect.
9896,The most cited one is immunocomprimised or people who can't get the vaccine are at risk.
9897,This is true but honestly one of the least worrying concerns.
9898,"Every time this virus infects a new person there is a chance of mutation, if this virus were to mutate into another strain because of these people lying about being vaccinated then catching it, it is possible to get a strain that is vaccine resistant."
9899,"Actually the scary part is that if this virus is being spread, the ones that will make it are the same ones that will be able to infect vaccinated people at a higher rate while the other variants slowly die off."
9900,It would only be evolution and will happen given enough time and people if this virus continues to thrive in places like the US or India.
9901,"The last part is that while being vaccinated gives you something like 96% immunity, the problem is we don't yet know how long exactly this immunity lasts."
9902,If the virus in its current form is able to spread among the unvaccinated non mask wearing population for the foreseeable future there is a real threat that it will then begin infecting the vaccinated population later down the line once immunization begins to wear off.
9903,&gt;You'd be crazy if you're trying to suggest there was no animosity towards China.
9904,I didn't.
9905,I said extra precautions are not the same as animosity.
9906,"&gt;The plan for SARS was to install temperature scanning for all passengers, and it had not been removed from airports ever since."
9907,That's what everyone is doing everywhere now.
9908,What's your problem?
9909,"&gt;The security at airports was tightened but everything else ran as usual for the past year, despite countries such as Malaysia Vietnam picking up positive cases from Taiwan multiple times."
9910,I don't know what you're trying to say or prove.
9911,"So for each case, investigations and reports are made public."
9912,Possible infections at airports.
9913,"Either way, every port of entry is doing it's best."
9914,Taiwan gets infected passengers from Vietnam and Malaysia and elsewhere too but I don't see you complaining about that?
9915,"FFS..

&gt;It's always 'we made screening test for those in close contact, but found not other infections', and everyone knows that's bullshit given the nature of the disease."
9916,"Yo, public health expert... show me where that's the narrative?"
9917,The point has always been containment without jeopardizing the health system and the economy.
9918,That is why contact tracing is given high priority.
9919,"&gt;Taiwan tried to keep up the successful facade to get a seat at the WHA, and when they didn't, they said stuff it and finally started testing."
9920,That's what you're seeing now.
9921,Your faulty reasoning results in faulty conclusions.
9922,You trying to justify China's block of a health contributors in the name of politics is simply middle-school grade.
9923,As a parent and someone that moved out at 17 it's wierd to hear that a 19 year old still has to have parents tell him what to do.
9924,"I have a pre-existing condition which would qualify me for group 3, but no luck."
9925,"Recently AZ shots opened up in Romania for everyone, and my wife's family lives there."
9926,So we made 1650km drive in one go to get the shots.
9927,At least we were able to.
9928,Few more days and we go back for the second.
9929,"It's not about being able to go out, but having some surety that we stand a good chance against it."
9930,I wish it was easier to get a shot here right now.
9931,"&gt; My arm was sore for the next day or so

You mean like after someone hits you in the arm with a hammer?"
9932,This is wild lmao
9933,Connecticut and Massachusetts are lifting thiers as well.
9934,"I have listened that interview, they didn't say that exactly."
9935,They said n95 wasn't necessary for normal mask usage which was technically correct since goal of masks was to prevent spread from a person who didn't know they were sick.
9936,Again they were technically correct but really bad statement.
9937,I was quoting from the wiki article.
9938,Note how similar ACLJ looks to ACLU.
9939,It is deliberate misdirection.
9940,It’s all downhill after that.
9941,Hit in the arm with a hammer?
9942,"It’s a momentary pinch, then 3 seconds later you’re done, what are you talking about?"
9943,My arm was sore for the next day or so but the shot itself was trivial.
9944,"Yeah, the grocery store I worked at kinda stopped after one of our employees was assaulted for telling a customer to mask up."
9945,We had to tell our store director after that incident if we saw someone without a mask.
9946,He can’t be everywhere at once.
9947,Also the amount of people who threatened to wait outside for the employees who told them to mask up was insane as well.
9948,So when can I stop wearing mask at work ?
9949,"I don’t want a medal, maybe just a slight decrease in the elitist, whiny, holier than though condescension."
9950,"Congratulations, you let your own people die so you could send vaccines to countries that needed them less."
9951,You should get a medal for stupidity.
9952,Uh like  6 people.
9953,Out of millions.
9954,You people with your terrible long term effects memes.
9955,Know what actually has terrible long term effects?
9956,Covid.
9957,Um..  check the profile and you'll get your answer

9981,"There's not, that's why it is always an option for anyone who wants to."

9983,Because the science doesn't support that being a meaningful improvement at this time.
9984,That’s why it takes a decade or longer to study.

10009,The last guy knew as early as december that this virus was much worse than anyone had expected and he kept it to himself while screeching about it being the other side demonizing him....
10010,I've seen plenty of under 18 year olds get sick with covid-19.
10011,"They all had mild yo moderate symptoms, but it did give them a good reality check."
10012,they no longer think they are invincible and it much more seriously.
10013,&gt;	you are absolutely an enabler.
10014,"Oh no they’re enabling people to get vaccines they want, someone call the FBI!"
10015,Tell her you'll cut your ties if she doesn't get it.
10016,"Just as a heads up, children under 2 cannot wear masks due to possible suffocation."
10017,"It’s not that they aren’t “recommended”, they are considered to be absolutely a no-go from a medical standpoint."
10018,You must have gotten your law degree from Bing
10019,Did you read the comments you’re replying to?
10020,"They’re talking about people wanting it still not being able to get it, not the people who don’t believe in vaccines."
10021,👍 k
10022,"Hey, at least a few of us have a healthy paranoia."
10023,"I'm out in California, and pre-vaccine, I wore a respirator when I had to be indoors."
10024,I'll be very tempted to wear one next time I fly.
10025,But that doesn't mean they can't contract the virus and spread it anymore.
10026,"So it would still be helpful, though not necessary I guess."
10027,That is absolutely a factor.
10028,"The low numbers we're seeing now are due to antibodies, however they were obtained."
10029,A reminder about the cost of those antibodies: fifty thousands Texans are dead.
10030,"Even if Texas had performed as well as Canada, who weren't exactly great at locking down and following guidelines, you'd have 25,000 of those dead loved ones still alive."
10031,Fuck anyone who pushes an anti-lockdown message as a result of these numbers.

10036,"It's pretty compliant on the IL side(~80%) in the metro area, but the more rural areas are ~60%."
10037,The Iowa side is probably ~75% in the metro and ~40% in the rural areas.
10038,The CDC bowed to your pressure.
10039,So stop bitching.
10040,I know I sound eager to open things up and it's partly selfishness even though I'm more of an introvert.
10041,"But with summer coming I have a lot of friends and family that work in entertainment, and food service."
10042,They've been absolutely fucking devastated by these restrictions and they're just so damn happy to be booking events and getting job offers again.
10043,Again I'm sorry about your situation but I hope you can understand it's not just full selfishness by people wanting to pretend this is all over.
10044,Even though that probably is the majority.

10046,"This is a global effort and we're historical bros being side by side on most issues in the world, and this is a virus that knows no borders."

10048,[removed]
10049,The point is to open everything for vaccinated peopel first.
10050,THEN everyone else will run out and get the vaccine.
10051,"It's very simple, if you have your vaccine you go back to normal."
10052,"If you do not, you quarantine and wear masks forever."
10053,Let people choose but the first step has to be the government opening everything back up to normal for vaccinated people with proof of vaccination.
10054,Isnt it amazing how absolutely nothing has changed and now suddenly we dont need masks anymore?
10055,Its like magic!
10056,🙄
10057,duh
10058,"&gt; 80% at Menards

Weird, the Menards closest to me would refuse to let people in if they weren't wearing a mask."
10059,"I suppose people could've taken them off once they were in the store, but I don't remember seeing anyone do that."
10060,Fuck yeah!
10061,Same here just two weeks ago.
10062,One day we'll be able to give each other real high fives.
10063,And what I'm happy is we're starting to have some data showing that a delayed second/booster shot can increase the immune system response yielding to a greater immunization.
10064,Our strategy is paying off as the first shot already does a lot to help ease the stress that our doctors and nurses face.
10065,&gt;Uhh remember when DeSantis put a whistleblower in jail because she was trying to report accurate Covid numbers?
10066,"You're not up to date on the state of this ""whistleblower"" are you?"
10067,"The case of, or belief in a deliberate, criminal conspiracy doesn't need to be addressed or pursued at the same time as, or before a virological inquiry and investigation is done."

10070,"Wear a mask forever, that’s the accepted solution."

10072,Ditto here in the Northwest Suburbs.
10073,I would dare say above 98%.
10074,"Even at Ikea (though I never went in, just picked up from there outside, once."
10075,).
10076,That's why I'll continue to shop there instead of Walmart or Target now.
10077,No way of knowing who's legit vaccinated and people lie.
10078,"Yes, I think a better alternative would be for the CDC to have added grocery stores and any other essential shopping to the exceptions to this rule, like public transit."
10079,People can't really avoid grocery shopping (esp.
10080,if they can't afford delivery) or public transit.
10081,"People CAN avoid things like indoor dining, bars, sporting events, etc."
10082,so open all those back up instead and that would already be a significant re-opening and incentive to get vaccinated.
10083,"My friend, I’m playing red dead redemption 2."

10088,"For immunocompromised people, your doctor(s) have to recommend the vaccine."
10089,"Basically, if they don’t (none of the 4-5 on my team have), then you just can’t get it because it has not been proven to not wreak havoc on your already jacked up system."

10093,"Since masks are primarily about protecting others, then choosing an airline that requires them means being safe from the other passengers' coughing, sneezing little brats."
10094,"Come to think of it, an adults-only airline might be pleasant, too."
10095,Not fully vaccinated can also just mean you received one shot of a two-shot vaccine or haven’t waited the two weeks after your final shot yet

10104,SE suburban-rural WI here - about 40% of people at my local Walmart have been wearing masks.

10129,For 100k People today number: Ontario 14.71.
10130,Québec : 6.43.
10131,Number are always lower on monday.
10132,At least cases are dropping in both case.
10133,My local target enforced it with a person literally sitting by the entrance with free masks making sure everyone who came in had one.
10134,"Walmart, at least my local one, did not ever enforce it."
10135,My local Walmart is pretty bad though.
10136,That's why your admin should have handled the mask mandate question better but hey what do we know....
10137,It feels like a mix of both
10138,"I don't know if the problem is the airplane or the airport (my main airport is LAX, so it's probably the airport for me), but I often get sick after a long flight."
10139,"It's easy to blame airplanes themselves because the air feels so awful onboard, but hey, I'll just play it safe in both places."
10140,"Plus, I'm Asian, so people don't even think it looks weird if I wear a mask."
10141,"One of the other problems I have on long flights is getting too cold, and masks help keep my face warm anyway."
10142,"I'm vaccinated and not at all worried about the virus when I'm exercising outside these days (I'm outdoors and nowhere near anyone but my husband), but I wear a mask both for allergies and for warmth."
10143,Worth it.
10144,Did I say it was?
10145,I’m just saying it out competes the B117 variant.
10146,Where did I mention vaccines?
10147,Even if you catch while vaccinated the chances of it being a symptomatic case that can be transmitted are almost nil

10149,They have a committee to decide.
10150,"They said it would be based on case counts and need so probably Central America, Southest Asia, etc"

10152,They are better educated and less conspiracy laden than the US is currently.
10153,Necessary evil or heavy-handed policy?
10154,Bet ya dreamt that one up
10155,Actually the research shows that combining different vaccines tends to result in more side effects for patients.
10156,"I was at a Costco in Minnesota on Sunday, and there were signs saying that masks weren't required for fully-vaccinated individuals, but I'd say 9 out of 10 people still wore a mask (even though this area has 55%+ of adults with two shots)."
10157,"IMO the social pressure is going to remain a bit longer in certain areas (a few more weeks, I'd say), and many people have just gotten used to it so will keep it up until the requirement is more ubiquitously dropped."
10158,Not even exclusively China's fault.
10159,"If the US government was funding the gain in function experiments...

And on a positive note: this could help us set up viral study in the future."
10160,By that I mean:  where these labs can be located (ideally not downtown of 10+ million people cities) and the quarantine protocols for those working in them.
10161,For comparison this was my experience in the UK.
10162,Saw on the news that my age range had opened up and got a text message from my GP with a link to a website that allowed me to select a time and date.
10163,"Turned up, got jabbed in 5 mins and waited 15 to make sure I didnt fall over or anything."
10164,Few weeks later got another text message with the link to book my second jab.
10165,Same experience as the first time getting the jab.
10166,"I can go on the NHS app on my phone and it tells me my vaccination dates, what vaccine I got and the batch numbers."
10167,Under 40 btw.
10168,Sadly your right on that point.
10169,"I’ve essentially given up hope that America will last, and now I’m just wishing things could’ve been different."

10437,How much?
10438,"Enough so that the pool is never too dark, despite the fact that the spout with coloring does not stop."
10439,The criteria have to be clearly defined.
10440,"Even the WHO has published recommendations on ventilation , although they do not yet explain clearly how infections occur."
10441,4.
10442,It is to measure the CO₂ indoors to check if ventilation is adequate.
10443,"CO₂ is emitted together with aerosols when we breathe, so it is a very good indicator of how much used air is in a place."
10444,It is the best solution currently available to indicate the risk of contagion.
10445,5.
10446,Report on the effectiveness and potential risks of various air cleaning technologies .
10447,Filtering (known HEPA filters) is the preferred technology to effectively remove respiratory aerosols .
10448,6.
10449,Special attention must be paid to educational centers .
10450,"They are spaces with the characteristics that propitiate super contagion events: many people, many hours a day and sometimes poor ventilation."
10451,7.
10452,"Clear and effective criteria, procedures and regulations must be developed and applied to reduce the risk of contagion."
10453,The first can be a limit of 700-800 ppm CO₂ in shared interiors ( up to 1000 ppm if there is sufficient filtration ).
10454,8.
10455,The quality information is the best defense.
10456,Clear messages are needed about how the virus is transmitted and how to protect ourselves.

10478,"What’s gonna happen is with more people not wearing masks and returning to normal life, the vaxxed folks will be fine and dandy, but the antivax folks are gonna get rocked hard in the coming months."
10479,I do wonder how many of them already had the virus but it wasn’t reported.
10480,"What’s sad is there’s somebody out there, refusing the vaccine or doing the right things to protect themselves and they’ll die from this."
10481,That’s what blows my mind.
10482,They’ll still find a way to blame everybody else but themselves though.
10483,It’s them stupid liberals shedding that make believe vaccine virus.
10484,"Don't know about Germany, but if it's like in Spain, I'd expect demand to drop much later - maybe at 70% or 80%."
10485,Here vaccine takeup is insanely high.
10486,"In the 80+ group, there are literally less than 0.1% unvaccinated in the country (around 1600 people out of close to 3 million)."
10487,"In the 70-79 group, there are around 4.8% but I personally know some cases and it's because they haven't been called due to administrative errors and they are trying to get the vaccine."
10488,"Granted, in younger population groups I'm sure takeup will be lower because COVID will be seen as less of a threat, but anyway I think demand will peter out much later than in the US."
10489,Because we wanted vaccines for the last five months.

10491,You are spitting a spray of droplets into your surroundings while speaking / heavy breathing.
10492,(Some people do that visibly).
10493,You only need to hit the eyes (they have tear ducts; wearing glasses does reduce the chance to be infected)) or the general vicinity of the mouth/nose a minute before someone scratches their nose.
10494,"Off cause if you can keep a distance it's just as good, but people do complain about not being allowed **to jog on crowded paths** without a mask."
10495,&gt;You are comparing the density of a city and urban area to the whole of NZ.
10496,"The outbreaks in August and February were both in South Auckland, the most densely populated urban area in the country."
10497,Overall density in NZ means nothing when the outbreak is so local.
10498,The same is true of overall population.
10499,"That would mean something in a huge outbreak, but not in a local one."
10500,My bad.
10501,Apples with apples then.
10502,"Auckland population density: 2,400/km2 

Taipei population density: 9,700/km2

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You make sound like Taiwan has fewer resources than NZ, so it can't do the same level of testing."
10503,But the two countries have a very similar level of wealth.
10504,There's no reason Taiwan should be limiting testing generally and only using it in large numbers after there is a possible outbreak.
10505,Context.
10506,"In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan."
10507,"6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined."
10508,"Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling."
10509,"I say again, it's not an issue of numerical wealth."
10510,This breaks my hart and my mind.
10511,"As someone from a country who is heavily in need of vaccines, where ppl will do ANYTHING to get vaccinated, and not having enough to even cover the ppl with 80+ years and doctors, seeing this is ridiculous."

10527,Are you free to deny them information?
10528,"60% of adults, 48% of the total population"
10529,They should receive funding proportional to their vaccination rates and insurance companies should raise rates on policyholders that don't get the vaccination for anything other than medical reasons.

10534,60% of ADULTS.

10536,I would actually go get vaccinated if this was available to me.
10537,relying on the honor system of those not wearing masks is bound to fail.
10538,I love it
10539, There is a middle ground you know.
10540,They can mitigate risk by limiting exposure and Proper precautions.
10541,Not by completely shutting them off.
10542,But they also don’t need to run willy-nilly as I am sort of getting from your comments.
10543,My big thing is how many other dangerous things are they not thinking about that or even medically related not even socially.
10544,Probably tons of things that are likely to kill children that no one really thinks about.
10545,"The problem, as neatly explained by FoldedTwice in the UK sub, is that levels of the old variant are still going down."
10546,This disguises how far the levels of the new variant are going up.
10547,"Which means the new variant has an R above 1, and is going to continue to rise once it's outcompeted the prior variant."
10548,In two weeks we may find ourselves absolutely fine.
10549,Or we may find ourselves in another period of uncontrolled rise.
10550,"Modeling shows that we're not *quite* there with vaccination yet enough to support a massive surge of cases (the majority of deaths are in older people, but hospital admissions are a little more spread out)."
10551,It's smart for the people in charge to at least consider both options.
10552,Unless you would rather they just ignore any problems going forward?
10553,"In other words, water is wet."
10554,Would be nice if we all didn't have to indirectly pay for the stupidity of people who will certainly take up health resources even they get sick even if they don't want a vaccine
10555,"People vaccinating three, four or five times in 1, 2, 3..."
10556,How?
10557,The masks that I have used never restricted my airflow at all.
10558,"Plus, your asthma can be caused by several things, some get it with exercise, some with stress, but for a lot of people it's allergies to something."
10559,The mask helps to keep the allergies out of your airway and lungs.
10560,More states should do this

10574,"Swimmers are most at risk of getting wet, C.D.C Director Says."
10575,Yes but I’ve never heard of someone refusing to take their child in a car to avoid car accident.
10576,They live with the risk and mitigate it by using safety precautions like car seats.
10577,With Covid I can definitely see you leaving the children at home more but not taking them out ever?
10578,Seems like they are probably setting them up for other risky diseases later on.
10579,Keeping your children 6 feet away from other people is a pretty easy one depending on where you go.
10580,That would be a precaution that’s doable in your average grocery store.
10581,You can be mitigated on your own.
10582,Are children  likely to be around a stranger for 15 minutes in close proximity if you let them?
10583,Awesome.
10584,I'll get mine tomorrow then
10585,If china wants to cock-block the investigation let them do it publicly.
10586,I wish they didn’t have the right to be hesitant.
10587,I’d have declared a state of emergency and forced vaccines into arms.
10588,If someone wants to conscientiously object they could put their money where their mouth is and cool their heels in jail for contempt.
10589,"My immunosuppressive therapy that saved me from going blind and/or paralysed due to multiple sclerosis stopped my body from producing any antibodies, even though I did it as far apart from my treatment as possible 🤷🏻‍♀️"

10591,Where are they getting these numbers from?
10592,"The US reached 200 million with their first shot at the end of april, and its population is only about 330 million by the latest census."
10593,"That's 60%, and we've haven't stopped giving first shots, though it has slowed down."
10594,But this article says we are only just above 40%.
10595,Seems like either fake clickbait or propaganda.

10612,"We just opened it up to under 50 on April 15th, which was only 4 weeks ago."
10613,"So even if you were one of the first ones to get a first dose that day, you’re still not full vaccinated for both the Pfizer and the Moderna shot."
10614,Quebec has about half the population and a quarter of the daily cases so it is around half the rate per 100k as Ontario.

10627,Honestly does anyone else just want to let people keep these up.
10628,Let them wear their badge of stupidity.
10629,Then extra measures may have to be taken to keep kids safe until there's a vaccine for them.
10630,"And we aren't, and never were going to fully eradicate COVID...why are we still talking about that?"
10631,That opportunity was gone as soon as this shit got out of Wuhan.
10632,I appreciate your post and your info on masks.
10633,"Still, it seems like a lot more work and a lot more money."
10634,But what choice do I have?
10635,I think you and I agree on a lot and maybe we're miscommunicating.
10636,I do not think vaccinated individuals need to continue to mask outdoors or in any sort of private setting indoors or outdoors.
10637,As for my health before all of this?
10638,I'm a solid organ transplant patient but before March 2020 I only got the flu shot once a year and never got sick outside the rare cold that would last a week longer than normal.
10639,Thank you for listening anyway and understanding.
10640,Good luck to you.
10641,We don't *know* that.
10642,We didn't have a report yesterday.
10643,Monday numbers don't mean much *because there was no reporting over the weekend this weekend*--the state isn't accepting reports over the weekend anymore.
10644,"Therefore, the Monday numbers don't really *count* anything."
10645,"The *Tuesday* numbers will be higher, because they will include Saturday, Sunday, and Monday."
10646,"We got to 0 COVID deaths not because we didn't have any, but because of a stupid accounting trick to count them all as having died *today*."
10647,Yeah I'd wait as well no problem in waiting another week or two
10648,Which vaccine was it ?
10649,You don’t have to schedule your first and second dose at the same place.
10650,So students can get their first dose at college and the second one at home.
10651,"For the extra Covid sick leave, I guess it was mandated as a voluntary federal tax incentive and through various state laws."

10661,The plan never was to keep this up until every single person is  protected in some way.
10662,"The immune compromised have always had to live more carefully than the rest of us, that's not new, and they aren't huge part of the adult population."
10663,"yes it sucks for kids that they have to still mask but vaccines are coming, and there's no way we're masking for another year when spread is down to near nothing for a vaccine for kids."
10664,I saw someone today on here saying that because their infant can't get a vaccine we all need to mask....an infant isn't likely to ever be protected from this.
10665,"This was a pretty pro-science decision by the CDC because it in fact isn't taking all of the social stuff into account...if you're looking at the science, with nothing else, the CDC is right: vaccinated people don't need masks."
10666,I'm happy about the high demand we have seen so far in Canada.
10667,Hoping demand stays high for the next month and we can get to a high % of adults and high school kids.
10668,Just when you are ready to take a dump on the floor and throw a tantrum they just let you in.
10669,"I wish we had seen more interim steps for people like you who are able and willing to go out and socialize, without making people like me worry about getting groceries and prescriptions."
10670,Don’t disagree at all that you as a vaccinated adult with no risk to loved ones should be able to do more!
10671,Just wish we could have kept essential locations masked a little longer.
10672,The EU has repeatedly called the US out on their export ban.
10673,Last time was in response to Biden's bullshit plan to waive patents.
10674,"You don’t see that you’re making my point for me, do you?"
10675,The same precautions that work against influenza work against COVID-19.
10676,"In those same conditions, Covid killed nearly 300 times the kids."
10677,How can you claim that flu is more dangerous to kids with a straight face?
10678,Why is the vaccination level so low there?
10679,That seems remarkably behind the pace one would expect.
10680,3rd wave coming soon… this honor system is not going to work.
10681,I think the results of this poll tell us why we *don't* need to coerce people into having a vaccine.

10683,That is the first time I reported a mod or.. it worked.
10684,"Yeah I went to Ikea yesterday, they were enforcing masks at the door but after being inside maybe 1/20 people weren't masked up."
10685,As usual there were a bunch of people in Ikea.
10686,"The good news is that you still largely see people *complying* with those orders, even after the CDC's announcements."
10687,"I was physically at a superspreader event two weeks ago, and while I'm vaccinated, I know none of the children there were, and I know that there were definitely cranks there because at least one family of them showed up *symptomatic*, causing the superspreader event."

10697,That Marburg plant just keeps chugging out doses like it's nothing.
10698,The vaccines aren't designed to give you 100% immunity.
10699,That's not possible.
10700,However they've shown to be highly effective in protecting most who get vaxxed.
10701,What they do is all but eliminate hospitalizations and death if you happen to catch it.
10702,If you get covid after vaccination the viral load is so low that you essentially have a low grade version of the virus.
10703,Each area is different.
10704,"My lifestyle is still majorly constrained and the proof is pretty obvious to me, but it may not be the same experience for you."
10705,"The mask mandate being lifted is going to have a profoundly positive impact for people like me, without a doubt."
10706,"I'm so happy about it, it's really a tremendous relief."
10707,I've done my part and the CDC has made the calculation that it's worthwhile.
10708,And you just know the unmasked were also unvaxxed…
10709,Long term effects.
10710,"Ironic considering out of all of the vaccines I recall getting in my life, I barely even felt anything with this one."
10711,"Only felt like a tiny bit of pressure for me, no pain or jab here."
10712,"I think it's a case of healthcare capacity, rather than the raw figures for mortality, that determines the threshold for imposing restrictions on people."
10713,"If your healthcare system can't cope, that creates a nonlinear effect which would lead to far more dying of other things that might have been treatable, had the capacity not been taken up by sick patients - and of course sick patients unable to secure medical care, as we've seen in India."
10714,"However, one concern some have raised here in the UK is the prospect of restrictions being reimposed every winter because of seasonal pressures, which in some years can be very severe."
10715,"Previous to March 2020, the idea of imposing restrictions on individuals and businesses to prevent this from happening would have even occurred to anyone."
10716,"Now, it is standard practice, and indeed NHS officials are incentivised to demand such action rather than increase the capacity themselves, or for the government to sort out the longstanding structural problems with the health service."
10717,"With status quo bias, the burden of proof has shifted onto those trying to justify having no restrictions, as opposed to those speaking out in favour of such measures."
10718,"Therefore, you might just as easily flip the script with your question and ask those in favour of restrictions their criteria of risk tolerance before lifting them."
10719,"State hotline here, go ahead and make out with the doctor, they're vaccinated."
10720,"Stay away from the nurses though, unless you can confirm they are vaccinated."

10727,So the rowboat went on.
10728,Then a motorboat came by.
10729,"""The fellow in the motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, I can save you."""
10730,"To this the stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me."
10731,"I have faith."""
10732,So the motorboat went on.
10733,"Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, ""Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety."""
10734,"To this the stranded man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me."
10735,"I have faith."""
10736,So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
10737,Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned.
10738,He went to Heaven.
10739,"He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown."
10740,"I don't understand why!"""
10741,"To this God replied, ""I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?"""
10742,Because he's a politician not a scientist.
10743,"He doesn't want people to start panicking about still potentially being at risk of COVID, even if technically they are."
10744,"Whether Biden accepts the Indian variant exists or not is irrelevant, it will spread to American and become dominant, like it is currently doing to Europe."
10745,"His job isn't to explain the science to people, it's to maintain popularity and make people feel safe by simplifying complicated concepts."
10746,America's biggest issue is vaccine hesitancy.
10747,It's not a good idea to convince people to take the vaccine by saying that the vaccines aren't perfect.

10756,Clever.
10757,Bet you’ve been thinking of that one your whole life.

10775,I think you're too pessimistic given the data.
10776,"With 115 million people vaccinated, CDC says there have only been about 1100 hospitalizations and  200 deaths."
10777,"That means fewer than one in 100,000 vaccinated people have been hospitalized and fewer than 2 per million died."
10778,Compare this to your example of 1 in 500 hospitalizations for vaccinated people.
10779,Certainly there's no written guarantee that things won't change for the worse.
10780,But until that day just be sure you and yours are vaccinated and move on.
10781,"As of now, vaccines work."

10800,I think that’s a lot of why the guidance didn’t make sense to me.
10801,My area never actually had a mask mandate but all local stores required.
10802,Bars and restaurants have been open for months so people like you who WANT to socialize could.
10803,And people like me who don’t want to risk it just stay clear.
10804,You’d have only needed to wear a mask at basic stores which shouldn’t really impede your social life and doesn’t seem (to me) like that much to ask until local vaccination rates were higher.

10934,Moderna is close behind.
10935,"I'm not sure where J&amp;J is in that timeline, or where any of the vaccines in other countries are with their regulatory bodies, or how much regulatory bodies will accelerate the review process under the circumstances, but at least at this point there is enough data to file for most of the vaccines."
10936,It's pretty interesting reading up on vaccine development history - there are a lot more vaccine mechanisms in use already than I had realized (including ones that don't target organisms - the tetanus vaccine provokes immune response to a pseudotoxin similar to a real toxin produced by bacterial infection).

10944,It makes sense to lift their restrictions first.
10945,The only reason they were there is because of the risk of transmission.
10946,"At this point, everyone at high risk that wants the vaccine has probably gotten it, and therefore that risk of transmission is mitigated."

10960,My now 4 year old got RSV at 7 weeks.
10961,"She was a winter baby and we tried our best to avoid visitors and make sure everyone was washing their hands, but somehow she got it anyway."
10962,"Luckily it was a very mild case, she only went to the ER for a night of observation after spiking a fever and then after that she turned the corner and kept improving."
10963,"No long term damage, we got off easy."
10964,"All that said, it was BRUTAL watching my newborn being so miserable, unable to eat, struggling to breathe, coughing like an old man."
10965,I was so worried her case WASN'T going to be one of the better outcomes.
10966,"Having been through THE MILDEST VERSION of watching my baby suffer, I never want to do that again if I can avoid it."
10967,There's no vaccine for RSV (there are some preventative treatments but they are usually reserved for NICU babies and babies with higher risk factors.)
10968,But there is a vaccine for Covid.
10969,So we will keep doing our best to reduce risks until our 4 and 6 year olds have been vaccinated because I'll be goddamned if I have to helplessly watch my kid struggle to breathe in the ER again if it's something that we could have easily avoided with a little extra caution.
10970,Some people have never been terrified for their children's health and it shows.

10997,"I have been fully vaccinated since January, but have kept to all the usual precautions even though I knew this day was coming."
10998,I will probably still mask for a little while longer just until the vaccination rate gets up more in our area and school is fully over.
10999,"But I admit I don't get the people saying they are masking all the time, every flu season, so they and their kids don't get sick."
11000,I don't know how it works elsewhere but I do not see younger kids wearing masks in school voluntarily.
11001,"It's been a struggle as it is, and the only reason it's worked so well at our school is every single kid is doing it, no exceptions."

11015,You mean the group that said we don't need mask now because children aren't at a significant risk from covid 19?
11016,[removed]
11017,Read my other comments.
11018,My kid was just in the hospital for 10 days with a covid variant.
11019,He now has lung damage.
11020,What is it with people thinking the only way a kid can be harmed by covid... is to die?
11021,It's so weird.
11022,We don’t 100% know.
11023,All information seems positive with vaccines but early days.
11024,"Infections from mid November led to high death rates in January, so could be just at early stages, with new wave."
11025,As said seems not.
11026,"The other issue is a significant proportion of the population are not yet vaccinated (under 40s) and we still don’t know much about long Covid, also ending up in hospital isn’t fun."
11027,For me transmission is the worrying bit as it increases the vaccination level for herd immunity increases.
11028,"So original Covid may of had an R number as low as R2.5, this is vaccination level of 60%."
11029,"Then UK variant may be 70% more transmittable, r4.25 means levels of 74%."
11030,"Another 50% on top, r6.4 (ish) = 85% required."
11031,These figures are all approximate.
11032,"I hear you, I myself did something similar."
11033,"When I went back, I just filtered out the bad, insane and the negative."
11034,"Now I DO get to enjoy cats, family and silly memes!"
11035,Bu-bu-bu-but I wanna keep screaming at people for not wearing masks.
11036,Can we pump the brakes on this ending the pandemic thing?
11037,It is wierd how different places can be.
11038,I live in KC and havent seen an unmasked person in a store for probably a year including today when orders have been lifted.
11039,How so?
11040,Under 300 kids have died from covid out of 30 million confirmed cases.
11041,"You're right, sorry."
11042,I thought they were using the Chinese one because I remembered an article that they'd received a bunch.
11043,"Apparently,  their health ministry hasn't approved it."
11044,We may need to watch why singapore is having a different result than the USA.
11045,[removed]
11046,Banks are pretty anti “cover your face with anything”
11047,They aren't at a significant risk from covid.
11048,Good.
11049,Hopefully later.
11050,"Yep, I live in KC and havent seen an unmasked person in a store for months, maybe even a year."
11051,"There’s lower efficacy against contracting COVID, but is there any evidence that the vaccines are less effective at preventing severe death and disease from COVID variants?"
11052,"That’s what the CDC is interested in, since they’re creating guidance on a macro level."
11053,[removed]
11054,I’ll just leave this here.
11055,"https://amp.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3133695/coronavirus-singapore-close-schools-wednesday-amid

Good luck america."
11056,You’re gonna need it.
11057,Adults can get the vaccine
11058,I cannot even recall last time I saw someone in a store not masked.
11059,I live in Kansas City.
11060,Pretty much every place was enforcing the rules with someone near the door.
11061,Even today everyone was masked where I went.
11062,"Vaccines don't eliminate hospitalisations, they simply alter the probabilities."
11063,Hypothetically (these are random made up numbers) let's say that pre vaccination there was 1 hospitalisation per 100 cases.
11064,The post vaccination there was 1 hospitalisation per 500 cases.
11065,"However, if the number of cases spikes because everything goes back to normal, then you will have a surge in hospitalisations that could potentially match past spikes."
11066,"Given the Indian variant will likely become dominant over the next weeks and months across the world, as we're seeing in the UK, a more transmissible variant is added to the mix, that will cut through unvaccinated communities far quicker than the UK variant."
11067,"Since the vaccines aren't perfect, about 95% protection against hospitalisation according to Public Health England's surveillance data, a huge spread of cases in the vaccinated will cause significant hospitalisations."
11068,"Even if more cases are required to reach a certain number of hospitalisations (due to the vaccines increasing people's probability of safety), a big enough spike, due to a new highly transmissible variant, could cause similar spikes in hospitalisations in the future."
11069,"Nothings' certain, but there's still significant risk as long as there's a lot of global transmission and, as a society, we don't have enough collective immunity, through infection or vaccination."
11070,"1) not all of the covid vaccines we're using are mrna vaccines, and
2) while mrna vaccines are less likely to be rendered ineffective from mutation, it is not outside the realm of possibility."
11071,"Our best bet to avoid trouble with mutations is to limit the number of times the virus is permitted mutate, and that means as many vaccinations as possible while also stopping the spread among groups that cannot or will not be vaccinated."
11072,"The mechanism is different, but the way it builds immunity once it's in the body is basically the same."
11073,"The mRNA vaccine trains our body to defend against the spike protein just like a more traditional vaccine would, just in a more direct and more effective way."
11074,"If/when there's a significant enough mutation of that spike protein, the vaccine will be less effective."
11075,Getting my second shot next week!
11076,!
11077,"Masks in crowded places go a long way, learned thst the hardway."

11079,"Adult with athsma, allergic to all of the pollens and dandruff, cancer survivor, and epileptic my entire life but only diagnosed in the past few years (it comes with a slightly fucked up immune system and the meds I have learned do not do me any favors in that department)."
11080,I too have not been sick (outside of illnesses caused by my diagnosed disorder) all year.
11081,That has never happened to me before.
11082,"I personally loved that and I will continue myself to wear masks until I cant and distance myself more now that its seems the american cultural ""thing"" where we get right behind people in lines seems to been broken a little bit."
11083,Side note.
11084,I absolutley love having some personal space in the world at large.
11085,It made being in public a much more enjoyable experience.
11086,Why not?
11087,Well said!
11088,"Icky, but a good analogy."
11089,I saw it enforced at both.
11090,They always had someone at the entrance enforcing it and I saw people kicked out of both or offered a mask.
11091,This’ll get more ppl to take it knowing that the govt hasn’t made it mandatory it but places they value made it mandatory
11092,Can’t wear a mask?
11093,Have what you need delivered.
11094,You can do that now.
11095,I dont see why browsing and walking throughout the store is worth getting others sick over
11096,You’ll see a lot more uptake now that colleges are done.
11097,Getting your first dose and then driving back to college for your second or scheduling a second dose appointment across state lines is stupid.
11098,And the side effects are pretty big for the second dose.
11099,Nobody in their right mind was getting it upon launch because second dose could be during finals.
11100,In my area for a while Walmart not only enforced masks but limited the amount of people in the store.
11101,They had guys at the entrance and exits counting people.
11102,[removed]
11103,Ah yes the honor system where anti-Vaxers definitely won’t just not wear a mask.
11104,Fucking idiocy.
11105,I have no idea why I'm getting downvotes.
11106,I don't think that I am being obtuse or illogical about this.
11107,It looks like we are going to be stuck with a very sizeable chunk of the population that will refuse to get vaccinated.
11108,Those people are surely not going to continue wearing masks if they don't have to.
11109,"The more people passing the virus around to each other, the more likelihood that a new variant could emerge."
11110,"While we obviously continue to hope that any new variants will be covered by the vaccine, there's always a chance that they won't."
11111,Why take that chance?
11112,"I think that America has just collectively decided that the pandemic is over, and that's that."
11113,"The studies I've seen show that the the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have lower efficacy against contracting the South African variant, but are still good at preventing hospitalization and death."
11114,"I don't believe they've had enough time to study it, but the recent variant out of India is the next troubling prospect."
11115,"I was just at Meijer in Bowling Green, KY. Aside from staff, hardly anyone had a mask on."
11116,"Yeah too bad you can't really do that with a younger kid, they WILL get their germs all up on you and they require more close daily contact than tweens and older kids do."
11117,"Even if you mask in your own home, I can't imagine having an infant to say, 6ish year old get it and NOT have them pass it on (prior to wide vaccine accessibility, at least.)"
11118,At those ages parenting is a contact sport.
11119,"Can't just lock a toddler in a bedroom and say ""here's your meals, good luck!"""
11120,"They need you for literally everything: dressing, bathing, help with feeding and toileting, brushing teeth, etc."
11121,My 4 year old still thinks it's hilarious to try and lick my face at any given opportunity.
11122,I'm fully vaxxed now but if she had gotten prior to that I'd have just been counting down the days until I caught it from her because I've gotten literally every illness she's picked up since infancy.
11123,"My 6 year old is slightly better, but not by a wide enough margin to feel like I could avoid getting sick from him if he caught it."
11124,"Hooray for my husband and I being fully vaccinated now, I'm just hoping the kids can get theirs sooner rather than later."
11125,That makes some sense.
11126,I'm curious about how everything plays out.
11127,I've seen reports that there are new strains that are immune to vaccines.
11128,"This is one of those things that just doesn't equate until it does, though."
11129,I hope you're right.
11130,I didn't say that.
11131,I said it's very unlikely they'll have severe symptoms.
11132,Tell that to all the kids who died from it
11133,I thought Singapore was using the same Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines that we’re using in the US.
11134,Is that not the case?
11135,Sadly I would wait.
11136,For one you could potentially spread mono to other people at the vaccine site.
11137,"Two your immune system is gonna do everything to get rid of that mono in your body, idk if it’s wise to get a vaccine dose with your immune system already at war."
11138,He for sure thinks he's invincible.
11139,I used to think the same thing when I was 19.
11140,"I got a reality check a couple years later, so there's hope for him."
11141,"Not trying to be a dickhole, but what did you do to prior to covid?"
11142,You’re in a tough spot no matter what it seems.
11143,"Wow, so many people nitpicking the context of your comment."
11144,It’s not like you said “only me”.
11145,Iyeesh.
11146,Everyone’s a damn keyboard warrior.
11147,[removed]
11148,The CDC is using game theory.
11149,"Under the old mask guidelines, the people who refuse to get vaccinated are the winners, because they are able to avoid the vaccine, while waiting for everyone around them to get the vaccine as society slowly gets to herd immunity."
11150,"Once herd immunity is reached, they are able to reap all the benefits without being vaccinated."
11151,"Since everyone is masked up, the chances of them getting seriously infected is low."
11152,Removing the mask mandate changes the risk calculus for these folks.
11153,My kids aren't vaccinated.
11154,Too young.
11155,Guess I'm just fucked then.
11156,Is that a yes?
11157,"Considering how often my state has to bail out the local Amish communities whenever they have an ""unexpected"" outbreak of some easily avoidable disease, we're all going be footing the bill for those pockets of morons."
11158,[removed]
11159,"there is also a logistical side to this, tackling by age group is the simplest way to decide who gets jab and disseminate the info."
11160,The government can now go: if you're over 35 book your vaccine online and loads will.
11161,"If they went if you're over 35 50% of you will be able to and we will be in touch, the extra admin would slow the whole process down."
11162,He's sort of centered.
11163,Not too hyperbolic but not too optimistic.
11164,"The amount of energy I save in a day from not having to do small talk, or other forms of emotional labor like keeping my facial expression schooled, is worth continued masking."
11165,I have energy for hobbies after work now!
11166,Not getting sick is a huge bonus.
11167,So 27 people in decimal then?
11168,IMO it'll be on June 15th when CA lifts its mask mandate

11175,Everyone should have seen it first hand in Michigan.
11176,"If Britain wraps up their vaccines program and gets decent uptake in younger people as well, I just see this prediction as totally unrealistic."
11177,How is it going to spread when you start pushing 80% of the population with immunity.
11178,Blast me if I’m wrong.
11179,Don’t under 12s have a higher risk of getting seriously ill and dying with influenza virus than covid?
11180,"Again, the chances of that happening from a jogger passing by are so low that it’s almost negligible."
11181,"If you are outside (unvaccinated of course) speaking to someone who is infectious in close contact for an extended period of time, there is a chance that transmission could occur."
11182,A jogger running by poses a negligible threat.
11183,This is a good interview with Muge Cevik who studies transmission.

11215,"In conclusion, the point I'm trying to make:

1."
11216,"Taipei sits very close to the epicenter in Wuhan, with lots of flights connecting it to other populous countries with frequent travel to China."
11217,2.
11218,"Taipei also has a large population, dense cities."
11219,3.
11220,\*Ideally\* Taiwan could test every single person.
11221,That's not possible because of the need to ensure that the system is not overwhelmed due to limited hospitals and medical professionals.
11222,4.
11223,So the strategy was to shut early and quickly.
11224,Test the existing cases that have already entered.
11225,Minimize risk of spread through aggressive quarantine and contact tracing.
11226,5.
11227,"Because all cases were accounted for early on, it didn't make any sense to test the entire population."
11228,"If there were individuals unaccounted for during this time, community transmission and widespread deaths would've happened last year."
11229,6.
11230,"The goal is to preserve all capacities, readiness, and resources for when leaks happen, like what Taiwan is experiencing right now."
11231,7.
11232,A lot of Taiwan CDC's emphasis is on self-care and responsibility.
11233,Transparency and clear protocols allow the population to be relatively ready in the event of an outbreak.
11234,"In the few days after the first announcement of local transmission, many companies immediately resorted to various measures like working from home, schools were shut down, all public buildings closed, etc."
11235,Streets of Taipei empty.
11236,8.
11237,Yesterday's cases peaked at 333 domestics.
11238,Today at 240.
11239,"&amp;#x200B;

Specific points you raised:

&gt;density alone doesn't cause massive spread."
11240,Here is a Scientific American article about the question of density in Covid spread.
11241,"The basic point is that density isn't the issue it is crowding

Thanks for the exposition."
11242,The context was on the size of Taiwan's cluster vis-à-vis resources.
11243,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Density can't explain number jumping from 20-30 to 300 in a couple days unless the virus was already spreading."
11244,That's called community transmission.
11245,Density is simply one factor of many.
11246,"Depending on the factors, speed of transmission varies."
11247,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Contact tracing alone isn't enough because people lie, such as the case you mentioned."
11248,"That's right, people are selfish and they lie."
11249,"So they resort to several other contact tracing tools like tracing apps, phone records, gps locations, transportation cards, name and number registrations at public buildings etc."
11250,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Context."
11251,"In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan."
11252,"6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined."
11253,"Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling."
11254,"&gt;  
&gt;I don't understand what this has to do with testing."
11255,Why would high levels of movement before the borders closed in 2019 relate to testing within the community today?
11256,A lot of travel = proximity to the epicenter and affected areas = the gravity of the situation that the CDC faces.
11257,"If they were to test everyone including the domestic population, then they would've been severely overwhelmed."
11258,So the decision was made to be aggressive at the border instead.
11259,"Since the early patients have all recovered, there was no need to aggressively test the entire population and instead save the ammunition for the next wave."
11260,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm talking about having doctors regularly test anyone who presents with cold and flu symptoms and testing wastewater regularly for signs of Covid."
11261,Oh that's already being done for those with symptoms.
11262,I will say that the second shot had be down for the count the next day.

11317,"Lots of people here are refusing to get vaccinated, it’s actually shocking"
11318,It’s become a game where hospitals try and extract as much from the insurance companies as possible.
11319,"This actually is the federal govt doing it - it’s their money, it’s just under the management of states, since vaccine distribution is specifically under their proviso."
11320,We tweak the vaccines?
11321,Exactly.
11322,Surely the goal is to decrease hospitalisations and deaths.

From what we currently know it means some people will be sick but not too much."
11330,It'll reinforce their immunity for future variants.
11331,Once vaccinated catching covid ain't too bad as - for most people - it makes your immune response wider and stronger.
11332,That’s what I said though that there are a lot of unknowns even with vaccines.
11333,Honest answer: you never want to disincentivize the good behaviour/first movers.
11334,"From a behavioural economics AND public health standpoint, this actually hits almost all the marks."
11335,So the entire state needs to delay their removal of a mask mandate because of these select few businesses??

11341,Mmm pretty sure seeing the US hosting fans at hockey games because of their vaccine rollout was enough.
11342,I know a lot of us have been looking south of the border seeing their numbers go down while being fully open in many states has created some jealously.

11354,"No money being bet/risked, so not gambling."
11355,I used to attend a church that was strictly against gambling (and a host of other stuff).
11356,"Technically, this would have been acceptable."
11357,Yeah that could be a possibility.
11358,I also read something about mink traders unknowingly bringing the virus to Wuhan from Yunnan province (where the original SARS came from)
11359,I am not quite that pessimistic; I think there will be a very long tail of shots delivered by primary care physicians and access initiatives in vulnerable areas.
11360,But it will take a very long time to reach it and just north of 70% will be around the cap of what we hit.
11361,Because authentic hope doesn’t get upvotes.
11362,I'm not talking about them.
11363,"Though true, the concerning part for the USA is that they are currently not supply constrained."
11364,"So their first dose uptake isn't because they don't have enough and are focusing on second doses, it's because people aren't taking them."
11365,If Canada can pass the USA in first doses administered (which is should soon) that speaks volumes for our ability to reach a high level of immunity.

11378,"The July timeframe is definitely still possible, I just can't quite seem to bring myself to be that optimistic just yet."
11379,I know the Globe and Mail did a projection where they think we can actually have second doses done by mid-July; which would be absolutely *fantastic*.
11380,It would be quite something if we got to 75% of people double-dosed before the US does.
11381,So...
11382,"The mod removed my post because I referenced an article published in March 2020 that discussed how when the pandemic started the CDC encouraged people not to wear masks, because the CDC stated they were not effective... And then a few months later the CDC changed their stance to be pro masks, and started providing instructions to properly use them."
11383,"This change in the CDCs stance on masks for vaccinated people, IMO, is a drive to increase vaccination rates by putting the carrot (not having to wear a mask) on a stick."
11384,"I just feel like once vaccination rates are higher there is going to be another statement saying masks are needed again, regardless of vax status because we are still in the middle of a raging pandemic, and we just witnessed the worse week of cases since it's onset."
11385,I heard something about mink farms.
11386,"And the point of this article was to demonstrate that, even before opening eligibility to everyone 18+, Canada was on its way to pass the US in % of population willing to get a first dose."

11469,There is no danger of long term effects for vaccines.
11470,Typically if you have an adverse reaction to a vaccine it'll happen within a couple months.
11471,That hasn't happened with any of the vaccines as far as we know.

11572,"Despite all the negativity you may have seen back in February, we're likely to be one of the first countries done with vaccinations after Israel/UK/US; and herd immunity is very much still on the table."
11573,The US is probably going to be the developed country with the highest case count in the coming months.
11574,"It's comparable to several European countries with lower vaccination rates, so when they catch up they should be more on the level of the UK and Israel."

11630,"A start from the common ones I've seen:

* mRNA vaccines changes your DNA (lol)
* Micro-chip stuff
* Vaccines do not prevent spread
* The vaccines have not been sufficiently tested

Other than that, many seems to either exaggerate or understate the risks from covid."
11631,"It is much deadlier than the flu, but at the same time it is not very deadly for young adults or children (although you should still follow recommandations and get the vaccine when possible, if notthing else to prevent spreading the virus to more at-risk groups)."
11632,"That changed yesterday, but they didn't indicate why."
11633,You MUST opt-in now.
11634,&gt;I can’t imagine a young child being able to keep a mask properly in place so that it seals.
11635,Exactly!
11636,The idea that the CDC didn't take into account people who refuse to get vaccinated is laughable.
11637,children and unvaccinated must wear a mask.
11638,did you miss that part?
11639,only the fully vaccinated have the option but for the others nothing changed.
11640,They have to wear a mask just like we all did for 1 year and 2 months

11655,"If you aren't sure whether or not the vaccine has produced an immune response for you, there are tests you can take to check your level of COVID antibodies and t-cells."
11656,It should tell you if the vaccine produced enough of an immune response for you to be considered safe.
11657,"There aren't currently millions of active COVID cases, either"
11658,[deleted]
11659,Based on the vaccination rates and the fact that the vaccine isn't 100% effective.
11660,"If I go to the grocery store, and I spend about an hour wandering around shopping with unvaccinated people, chances are good that I'll be exposed to the virus."
11661,I don't like the idea of that.
11662,"Also, sitting at work in a large office 8hrs a day."
11663,No thanks.
11664,It's all premature imo.
11665,"I mean, bicameral legislative branch."
11666,One chamber equally represents the states and the other is a reflection of population density.
11667,"If your small town is like my small town (and they're all the same despite what they tell themselves), people like to gossip."

11670,The town gossips will soon get the word out.
11671,I'm not sure what you mean.
11672,How dangerous do you think COVID is to healthy children?
11673,Why wouldn't I take advice from a pediatrician about a child's health?
11674,"Yes, but “you don’t have to wear masks outside” wasn’t exactly good incentive to people who understood being outside was the best ventilation and that (unless you were shoulder to shoulder with other people) COVID transmission outside was incredibly rare."
11675,It’s like if the Department of Public Transportation told you if you get your driver’s license you don’t have to wear your seatbelt in a parked car anymore.
11676,They're constantly doing tests to determine limits.
11677,Hence the updated information.
11678,not to mention some years when the flu shots are like 10% effective.

11706,"When it comes to the abysmal rates in the Bronx, we need to focus on outreach and understanding."
11707,"Yeah, I think it's stupid and just needlessly prolongs stuff."
11708,The Public Health Agency takes the risky approach to controlling spread and the ultra-low risk approach to vaccinations.
11709,"We should do it like in Germany and have a separate queue for the Vector Vaccines with a brief of the risks, permitting those that want it to get it earlier."

11725,All good things in moderation.
11726,They are still figuring the science out.
11727,Apparently some more specialized antibody tests are better than others.
11728,There is a study going on right now at the UPMC.
11729,"&gt;	Most drunk drivers make it home without incident, and even those that crash rarely hurt others

Poor analogy since I can’t take a vaccine to protect myself from drunk drivers."
11730,"I can, however, to protect myself from COVID-19."
11731,"And with every vaccine given, their group efficacy rises, too."
11732,"So not only am I superbly protected individually, but I’m getting more benefits from the group protection, too!"
11733,"You guys keep leaving out the vaccine angle so that you can imply it’s bad that I can unmask now, and then you hitch your wagon either to insignificant populations risk-wise (children) or to marginal cases that were going to always be at risk (immunocompromised, e.g.)."
11734,Then it’s “just a few more weeks” when challenged.
11735,It’s all in service of finding a reason to not move on.
11736,I get it.
11737,Some are scared of change here.
11738,Kids born in the 90s are reaching 30 years old.

11743,"All im saying is that the data clearly showed a downtrend in positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths since the rollout of the vaccine."
11744,Yet the cdc kept recommending masks.
11745,"And now, even though the data hasnt changed in any way at all, apparently its the right time to take the masks off?"
11746,Get out of here with your conspiracy bullcrap.
11747,Nah.
11748,I'll probably still be wearing it.
11749,My kid will be going to summer camp mask free and I’m perfectly fine with that!
11750,I’ve seen plenty of articles about how well immunity from previous infection works.
11751,"The problem is when it’s brought up you get downvoted to hell because, for some reason, the “we don’t know how long it lasts” complaint only works for that type of immunity and is forgotten that the same applies to the vaccines."
11752,"People are either not reading current data (when I had covid back in Nov ‘20 it was still thought to only last 3 months, whereas most recently I’ve seen AT LEAST 9 months) or they don’t care enough and just want to be mad at people who dare bring it up."
11753,"Please respond with the college you received a degree from, It’ll go on the block list my child will never go to."
11754,It s probably harder till it’s out of the EUA phase.
11755,Though no mask unless you have a vaccine should be easier to enforce as that’s the current OSHA guideline.
11756,at this stage it's multi mutant
11757,Much more sensible than limiting it to 65 ffs.
11758,We would have so much more supply if we would just let everyone above 41 take it.
11759,"I am scared of needles, but I am more scared of hospitalization and lots of other needles, IV's, etc."
11760,"The big scientific breakthrough with Covid is learning that it’s airborne, and cold and flu probably are, too."
11761,We used to accept waterborne illnesses from drinking water 100 years ago.

11763,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/covid-is-airborne-scientists-say-now-authorities-think-so-too

Wearing a cloth mask is only effective when used in combination with the 11+ other mitigation methods in schools: Cohorts, distancing, ventilation, staying home when kids have any symptoms, etc."

11773,It is better for each state if they do small prizes just within that state.
11774,10 - $1 million prizes in each state is still only a half-billion total and the odds of winning in your state go up drastically.
11775,"The worst part right now is the mask holdout places because as you go to more and more places without a mask, running into that 1 or 2 places with a requirement really gets ya because you’ll have no clue where your mask is as you’ll have forgotten it."
11776,I expected it to be higher than 50%
11777,I've seen that study but several others have far worse results like this one (linked below) where 46% had no antibody response while on antimetabolite immunosuppression medications.

11794,It's not always worse.
11795,Canada has a full vaccination rate of 3.8%.
11796,How does it eclipse Texas?
11797,The states with the lowest vaccination rates have all been opened up for at least a month and they are yet to devolve to a mad max hellscape.
11798,A spike is only a problem when it threatens to overwhelm the healthcare system.
11799,We see a spike in flu cases every winter.
11800,If enough high risk people are vaccinated then a spike wont overwhelm the healthcare system
11801,So reward the ones who didn't want to get vaccinated with money so they GET their vaccine.

11923,"In a fully open and unmasked/undistanced world, if those strains become dominant, you will have millions of breakthrough illnesses and tens or hundreds of thousands of death (over time)."
11924,The breakthrough numbers look good now because it’s been a fairly small period of time and a limited environment.

11946,Normal times are *almost* here again!
11947,I'm not sure what else there is left for public health to accomplish if ultimately people don't want to get vaccinated in those states.
11948,The only real endpoints of COVID restrictions would be to preserve health care capacity by flattening the curve or provide a stopgap until vaccines are available.
11949,"If there are people who refuse vaccination, I don't know what imposing restrictions on them is supposed to accomplish."

11962,I'm not trying to be a negative Nancy but this article is completely bogus.
11963,They're touting a 6% increase in vaccine appointments two days after the policy was announced.
11964,Anyone with even a 101-level understanding of policy will say you absolutely cannot determine meaningful impact with those numbers at that time interval.
11965,You also can't imply causation until you know there are no external variables affecting this.
11966,DeWine announced he would be lifting the mask mandate June 2nd when he announced the vaccine lottery.
11967,"It's (at the very least) equally plausible that, if the boost is something other than statistical noise, people are doing it because of the mask mandate or some combination of factors."
11968,"And to do the math a little more clearly, this ""boost"" they're talking about equals roughly 1,500 appointments."
11969,"It's kind of laughable but not surprising that DeWine's administration would jump at the chance to take any and all appointment boosts on a Friday afternoon and plant the flag of ""look what a great job we did!"""

12321,Seems like they’re doing just fine?
12322,Point is we have examples of states that have had no mask mandates for months.
12323,Is there a reason why we should expect a different outcome now with other states not requiring masks now?
12324,Two months ago if you asked me what will happen in Texas I would have definitely said their case numbers are going to rise and they’ll see that going unmasked was a mistake.
12325,But it didn’t happen and I’m as surprised as anyone.
12326,I agree that all logic says that lifting mask mandates will put unvaccinated people at risk but at this point I can’t ignore the evidence that it just doesn’t seem to have a huge effect on overall case numbers.
12327,Maybe the number of people with immunity (vaxxed + previously infected) is actually high enough to keep numbers down?

""Data from the world’s first reported trial to examine the level of immune protection after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in cancer patients, shows that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses at week three, following the first dose of the vaccine, were only 39% and 13% in the solid and blood cancers respectively, compared to 97% in those without cancer."
12476,"The study, called SOAP, also reports that when the second dose of the vaccine was given three weeks after the first dose, the immune response improved significantly for solid cancer patients with 95% of them showing detectable antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus within just two weeks."
12477,"By contrast, those who did not get a vaccine boost at three weeks did not see any real improvement, with only 43% of solid cancer patients and 8% of blood cancer patients developing antibodies to the Pfizer vaccine at five weeks compared to 100% of healthy controls."""

12678,Let’s say you have asthma.
12679,It’s the clinical care provider who listens to you describe your symptoms.
12680,"He or she does the necessary tests, makes the diagnosis, and prescribes the right medicines."
12681,You go home breathing better.
12682,&gt;The public health approach is different.
12683,"Public health takes a look at the whole neighborhood (or city, county, state, etc.)"
12684,and figures out how many people have asthma and what’s putting them at risk.
12685,"Then, public health professionals get to work figuring out how to reduce those exposures and cut down on the number of new asthma cases."
12686,Public health is also concerned with whether the people with asthma have access to doctors and are getting good care.

12717,"However, unfortunately the vaccines don't give 100% immunity to infection, particularly after a single dose (although they are incredibly effective at preventing serious cases, hospitilizations, and death)."
12718,"Data from the UK suggests Pfizer reduces chances of infection by about 61% after the first dose (89% after second dose), but the risk of death is down 85% after only one dose."
12719,"With an R0 of 3, you wouldn't reach true herd immunity after first doses alone in the absence of social distancing, although spread would be substantially reduced and hospitilizations/deaths would be dramatically reduced."
12720,"After the second dose, you would expect to need 75% of the population vaccinated to achieve ""herd immunity"" with an R0 of 3."
12721,"However, one other thing likely working in our favor is that it is probable that people who do get infected with covid after having a vaccine (first or second dose, are less likely to pass it on."
12722,"This hasn't been well studied, but the fact that serious cases are so strongly mitigated suggests that viral loads are likely lower, meaning people would be less transmissible."

12745,600 per day is flu season territory.
12746,Its lower out of season but that's with a flu vaccine that's widely available.
12747,It was a 10 fold reduction in that study.
12748,"Yes, the n was small."
12749,"Yes, the group was entirely composed of people who were around 30-40 years old, and neither group had been hospitalized."
12750,"But they experienced mild illness equally in both groups, which is hard to overlook, even with a small n. You should have seen some signficant effect even if the CI was a bit large."
12751,I would like neutralizing coverage against that variant if possible.
12752,"I am well aware at some point that the virus will mutate and everyone will likely be subject to mild illness as the virus will be endemic like any other cold-causing coronavirus, but if they come up with some sort of selective travel restrictions and say ""nope you can't go to Vegas because you had AZ only"" or something I'm gonna be really unhappy by making the 'wrong' choice."
12753,Here in Jersey they're all furious because our governor won't listen to the CDC... the same CDC that they believe is on this whole conspiracy.

12757,Nope.
12758,You must follow the science (CDC) at all times.
12759,Thats what we have been told for  a year+.
12760,California and other dont get to make their own decisions.
12761,"The problem is that most people don't understand how complicated it is to make vaccines, let alone ones using a brand new technology."
12762,"Prior to all this, nobody had any idea *which* vaccine they were getting, who made it, or where it was made."
12763,"People weren't freaking out during H1N1 that all our vaccines were coming from India, but now all of a sudden it's a total failure of the current government that we don't have any mRNA production capacity within the country."
12764,"To hell with all the variants, especially the SA variant."
12765,The UK is real world proof that the AstraZeneca vaccine works.
12766,Otherwise we would still have half of the UK getting reinfected.
12767,Which isn't happening.

12782,Did you read it?
12783,I agree with this.
12784,I believe we were restricting first doses to 30+ or 40+ before most provinces stopped using it.
12785,"Looking at the quantities, we should get about enough in the next couple of months to offer 2nd doses to those who got AZ for their first dose, so it all sort of works out."

12788,Wow!!
12789,I can volunteer to take that if it means 96% of the Britons can get antibodies
12790,People know about the vaccine.
12791,I doubt there is any perseon who doesn't know that vaccinations have started.
12792,"They aren't advertising the vaccine, they are trying to bribe people who didn't want to get vaccinated into getting a shot."
12793,It's an incentive to take it.
12794,Are you a scientist?
12795,Yeah it really is vastly improved from the previous Gus.
12796,They also updated the Twelve Days of Christmas lottery commercial from its original standard def a few years ago.
12797,They must have increased their advertising budget.
12798,Goes to show you these anti vaccine people are greedy selfish fucks.
12799,The sinovac is on par with Moderna.
12800,There's no reason to wait

12809,Why didn't you include the rest of what you said?
12810,"&gt;My state lifted the mask mandate in March and since then our Rt has only gone down, along with every other metric."
12811,This is not going to be the disaster people are predicting.
12812,"I thought it would, and I was wrong."
12813,Happily.
12814,The only thing you're right about in that first sentence is the mask mandate being lifted in March.
12815,"**Rt went up statewide, and particularly in urban areas."
12816,"** Then, you moved the goalposts to and Rt of 1, and you were *barely* right about that by 0.01, and completely wrong about it in urban areas."
12817,Every other metric has not gone down either.
12818,We've had increase in younger demographics and upticks in hospitalizations at regional levels.
12819,"To which I summed up with ""Removing the mask mandate had measurable negative impacts on our Covid recovery,...""."
12820,You've since provided data that literally showed that.
12821,Looks like the coronavirus can affect IQ.
12822,There are probably quite a few people with natural immunity because Texas has been open since last summer.
12823,We also have a really large population of people who don't think the virus is serious.
12824,"So even if they had symptoms, they likely didn't get tested unless they ended up in the hospital."
12825,Epidemiologists have been saying all along that cases are severely underestimated in this state (and in this country).
12826,How long that natural immunity will last is anyone's guess.
12827,We know that some people (the elderly in particular) who aren't vaccinated are already getting reinfected with some of the variants circulating now.
12828,Younger people will be fine for awhile.
12829,The vaccinated population will get boosters.
12830,Those who refuse to vaccinate will likely get reinfected at some point.
12831,So we're going to see numbers go up and down among those who aren't vaccinated.
12832,That's why it's so important to get vaccinated even if you've had Covid.
12833,I looked it up and it's a conspiracy theory wrapped in flawed logic.
12834,Last time this was posted I had a pretty negative reaction.
12835,"&gt;If you can seriously make the argument that someone figured out a *TOTALLY NEW* way of getting a virus into cells, *ADDED IT INTO A VIRUS WE'VE NEVER SEEN,* **FUCKING AND** *MADE THAT VIRUS DO NEW SHIT WE DIDN'T KNOW WAS POSSIBLE* without getting *huge* new funding sources for their research, and instead ""released it"", or it ""somehow leaked"", *WHILE KEEPING THE WHOLE THING A SECRET FROM THE ENTIRE F WORLD*, **AND IT SOMEHOW WORKED**,  I'd have no idea what to do with you other than call you a conspiracy theorist."
12836,everything was fine.

“They really don’t care in Washington state or in most of the U.S. what the person’s status is."
12839,"As long as you’re in the U.S., you can just pop by any pharmacy if they have extra doses and get vaccinated,” Saunders said."

12841,"Just because it's some non-discretionary covid vaccine spending allotted to the states doesn't meant it's the ""federal government doing it"" though."
12842,It's definitely just the state of Ohio doing it with the federal money.

12845,In China they give lottery tickets in receipts that prevent customers from companies from taking cash to avoid taxes.
12846,Genius to me.
12847,"Ive been considering this a lot since the CDC big announcement

I am fully vaccinated with the Pfizer miracle but my job is mainly on-location inside offices

I have to think about my mask etiquette and make my clients comfortable as well

I'll be wearing a light mask (KF94 earloops or 3M9502+ headbands) by default and only if agreed I'll take it off."
12848,at least for now.
12849,I won't be wearing the 3M8210 anymore
12850,I love watching how people blame the wrong people for this too.
12851,"6 months ago there would be one person to blame but now, it's someone else's fault."
12852,Very interesting.
12853,"You want the most protection, the soonest you can get it."
12854,That pretty much means: take any approved vaccine available to you.
12855,Take the Sinovac vaccine.
12856,Very strange that you're focusing on the office environment as opposed to the schooling environment.
12857,The office environment isn't very important since that vector will be mostly protected by their vaccinated parents.
12858,"If vaccinated parents are concerned about spreading to their children, they can wear an N95 at work and/or wear a mask at home."
12859,There should be little risk to them spreading it at home.
12860,"As for their kids having to go to daycare or something to that effect,  I'd recommend them finding daycares that are still masking, that are putting requirements for vaccination on their caregivers, look into outdoor  settingslike sports camps or the like."
12861,They can also look into hybrid work environments.
12862,"For white collar workers who have been home most of the time, there's truckloads of them still working from home and working hybrid."
12863,"Those going back into the office full time seem to be the exception, not the rule."
12864,"And again, the risk to children is about the same or lower than  many already accepted risks such as car accidents or influenza."
12865,Expecting large changes in life just because of that small risk is not really feasible.
12866,Is it just me or is Gus animated at a much higher quality than one would expect for a state lottery ad campaign?
12867,"Oh, I thought it started today?"
12868,"Either way it is available now, my point was that most people 18+ were not getting vaccinated up until this point so we still have a lot of people who WANT the shot and haven't got it yet."
12869,As some other people mentioned there were opportunities to get it in hotspots for 18+.
12870,"I live in one myself and have got my first shot (I'm 30), but that doesn't represent most people and even still I only just got my shot at the end of last week."
12871,The numbers are rising rapidly which is great.
12872,"Ah, yes - a lottery."
12873,What a fantastic idea to get stupid people involved.
12874,They should have thought of this sooner!
12875,You don't know what you are talking about - look at Sweden \*SK and Japan - they have all imposed restrictions at various times.
12876,The only thing that have prevented any of them from imposing measures harsher than the UK is a combination of extremely effective disease control methods that I postulate - someone who is displeased with post 9/11 emergency powers - would not be happy with seeing.
12877,"Look up South Koreas attitude to citizen surveillance as a result of this pandemic and the MERS outbreak, which enabled them to have these systems in place."
12878,The extremely sensitive early warning systems Taiwan implemented after SARS is also a reason they were able to avoid lockdowns and other extreme measures.
12879,"It's also interesting that you don't mention Australia and New Zealand, because they are actually following the Taiwan doctrine only they have instances whereby *it didn't work, and to get back to Taiwans zero-covid level they had to lockdown!"
12880,*
12881,I’ve seen similar things as well.
12882,Though the AZ guy seemed to think the anti-bodies produced from a single does wouldn’t be enough to handle the Indian variant.
12883,Dude was likely just fear mongering.
12884,"Thanks, I'm specifically looking at downtime the day after the vaccine."
12885,Looking for science if possible.
12886,So your solution is to exclude people from society rather than to wear a piece of fabric?
12887,You're antisocial as fuck.
12888,"We'd be better off excluding antivaxxers if we're going to do that because they're the ones who are actually dangerous to other people, unlike people who cannot be vaccinated for legitimate medical concerns."
12889,"I really don't see where I've said ""no prevention at all""."
12890,"I'm saying that some actions, especially nationwide curfews but also things like outlawing demonstrations are dictatorship level measures."
12891,"Western democracies shouldn't be able to introduce them, full stop."
12892,"So far there seems to have been no limits at all to the powers states can get to fight covid, that's not reasonable."
12893,Lol vaccines required for stimulus.
12894,Doesn't sound like a boring dystopia at all.
12895,Why don't we just enslave anti vaxxers.
12896,Be easier than just stealing their tax dollars for redistribution
12897,That's broad statement but when it comes to living yes.
12898,"Attending, as said it varies state to state."
12899,"The reality of it is, the vaccine is not FDA approved therefore side affects can result in a lawsuit for being forced to take something that's essential questionable and unauthorized."
12900,Thats...
12901,I...
12902,I agree with you.

12907,Why on earth is the story banned on this sub?
12908,That’s outrageous.
12909,"the Oregon governor got on TV this past Thursday and told everybody that the state would be following the new CDC guidelines, meaning vaccinated people don’t have to wear masks anymore."
12910,But the actual laws themselves have still yet to change.
12911,"She took to Twitter the next day to tell people they still need to wear their mask until Oregon properly updates its guidance, and to “follow mask and distancing requirements this weekend”."
12912,It’s now Tuesday and there’s no sign of any updated guidance/laws.
12913,What a mess.
12914,"The prospect of life changing money, even the hope of it, outweighs the $100 they could have right now for them."

12929,"Sounds like a fun world there, not."
12930,"We invented rights and believe in rights together for a reason, and that reason is not that rights are part of “reality.”"
12931,I wrote such a script last year when we needed to register our car and due to lockdowns there was very little capacity at the Stadtamt.
12932,It worked well.
12933,"But, sadly, we live in a city-state so there's only two possible centers and we're not able to make appointments."

12946,"They feel the risks associated with the  new, rushed, unknown long term affects of the Covid vaccine is higher than if they get Covid ."

13319,"* Look what happened when they said “vaccinated people could still spread Covid,” in January instead of honestly saying “we don’t know for sure yet that you can or can’t.” People still believe they could be carriers and they’re freaking out about naked faces."
13320,I have taken the flu vaccine every year since I have been able to.
13321,I don't mind wearing a mask while sick but some of us have been trying to fight community spread of the flu for years now..
13322,This reminds me of not being able to buy or sell anything without the mark.
13323,"Just saying, where will this end up going?"
13324,Was it a prophecy?
13325,"Hmm, something to chew on."
13326,What's that?
13327,Is that the non-approved super antibiotics treatment only available to Presidents?
13328,lol
13329,Username checks out
13330,Excess death has NOTHING to do with Covid or “categorization”.
13331,"If in a given year, 100 people are expected to die, and 110 people die, then there’s “10” excess deaths."
13332,It has nothing to do in any way shape or form with cause.
13333,"These death expectations are very accurate on an annual basis, except 2020."
13334,Which saw a significant increase death over expected.
13335,"The “expected” death takes a normal flu season (usually kills around 70,000 per year) into account."
13336,"Along with other things like car accidents, heart attacks, cancer, etc."
13337,"And yet, from February 2020 to March 2021 we had 540k EXCESS deaths."
13338,Deaths over expected rate.
13339,Zero to do with what they write down for a cause of death or what they tested for.
13340,"By that logic, do the unvaccinated care if you wear a mask?"
13341,Have you asked them?
13342,"The vaccines work really well but to make a statement like ""no one that is fully vaccinated will die from covid"" is a hopeful but irresponsible statement to make."
13343,Vaccines reduce your morbidity and mortality not make you invulnerable
13344,"Hah, jokes on you, over here J&amp;J and AZ are not limited, they just don't deliver..."
13345,And now two or three months is too much for you now that your vaccinated?
13346,Sure
13347,My co worker and his idiot wife refuse to get the vaccine because they want to have babies.
13348,"No relevant follow up info, just soul crushing stupidity."
13349,Did you click the link I posted?
13350,"You can see daily deaths go from about 60 in December to about 240 in early March and then back down to 60-ish, which is the bottom of their oscillation now."
13351,"And yeah, I guess you could say the rate is “flat,” although that seems an awkward term for a rising and falling wave that keeps going up to 100 and down to 60."
13352,"Still, at least we agree that it isn’t doing what it ought to be doing, which is continuing its fall to zero."
13353,Me so funy
13354,"More like 11 days or so, they only increase by 60%, not double."
13355,"And the latest forecast i have seen has total J&amp;J deliveries for Q2 for germany at 1M doses, which is pathetic."
13356,"&gt; “we shouldn’t be celebrating like we’re rounding third base""

Yah because we should be celebrating like we already scored."
13357,"If you are vaccinated, its game over."
13358,"Ask questions to the nurse if you need about things you’re worried about, hum or sing through it or tell a story, look away from the arm."
13359,"Yeah, if people refused to wear masks during a pandemic, harming others, I can’t see how we can forbid people to continue wearing masks if they want to, for their own comfort or convenience."
13360,*glares in Doug Ford*
13361,What conspiracy claims?
13362,The article I posted is real.
13363,"There are many more like it out there, go look for yourself."
13364,False; it's much much safer than at any time in history.
13365,We have precautions that they can take to prevent themselves from getting sick.
13366,In history diseases ravished communities.
13367,"In the past it was like: ""Welp you are sick, but there's nothing we can do.""."
13368,Diseases have more treatment than ever.
13369,There is more medicine than ever.
13370,What about the physical symptoms like rashes and hair loss?
13371,I've noticed that agreeing with the CDC's policy typically makes my posts wildly oscillate between -5 to 5 for about a whole day.
13372,"Governor DeWine wanted to do that in Ohio but ended up getting bullied into changing his mind by the follow the ""science"" crowd and the CDC."
13373,"Lol same thing happened to me at Weis, which was weird because that particular Weis was bad at enforcing the mask mandate."
13374,[deleted]
13375,Yes the CDC recommendations shape policy.
13376,"But if it's true that vaccinated people don't need to worry about masking or distancing, the CDC should say that (as they now have) rather than lie about it because of potential policy changes that will occur from it."
13377,It's annoying to me how many people think the CDC should lie because they don't like the policy changes happening now.
13378,"So, there is no expectation that lockdowns have benefits that can justify the extreme health, social and economic costs, it that it?"
13379,Well.
13380,That escalated quickly.
13381,You missed his point entirely.
13382,Those who are 'demanding vaccine requirements' appear to be doing so out of fear of contracting COVID  yet these people are presumably vaccinated themselves which means they're effectively immune from the disease.
13383,"The headline might as well be ""young people who demand vaccination requirements don't understand science."""
13384,"I wonder what is more risky, the percent of assholes who refuse to wear a mask and when confronted, shout, cause a scene, and potentially spread more contagions, or the numerically higher percent of people, unvaccinated, now free to use public spaces without confrontation, so lessening some potential contagion in those cases"
13385,Good call.
13386,It’s more important to vaccinate fast than in the right order.
13387,We just sacrificed a year of our lives for people like your kids
13388,Mention that you don't like needles and look away.
13389,The person giving you the shot will probably chat with you and then suddenly they'll tell you you're done.
13390,"Then do what you did before covid, during flu and cold season?"
13391,Really?
13392,"Huh, good on us, I figured we would remain behind the USA, just due to when vaccines became more widely available."
13393,"I've had my first dose, Pfizer, real pleased to see so many other people doing the same!"
13394,Certain people have made them (or lack of them) political.
13395,We don't have to follow suit
13396,I’d bet the house that you didn’t even read the article.
13397,Teach people HOW to apply and wear a mask properly as well.
13398,A work colleague was sick and claimed she had tested negative but came into work anyway while still sick - wearing her face mask under her chin...
13399,"Yep, this is perfect for the crowd that doesn’t understand science and math."
13400,"To appeal to any remaining anti-vaxxers, just tell them that if they don’t get their doses they’ll be given to poor children in Mexico."
13401,They won’t want to let that happen!
13402,I agree.
13403,Especially since a very large number got vaccinated because the vaccine was reward enough.
13404,The remainder are low information citizens or not at great risk from covid so not motivated to do something inconvenient and painful.
13405,Honest question.
13406,Do some people on reddit and twitter really think masks are more effective than the vaccines?
13407,Sure seems like that.
13408,"I'm sure masks reduced transmission a little, but they aren't some magical totem that keeps you from getting covid."
13409,"The phrase ""Nirvana is classic rock"" is tragic lol"
13410,A month ago the 7 day average was 750 and now it's 610.
13411,Down 20% in a month isn't too bad.
13412,Lots more room for improvement though.
13413,[deleted]
13414,Failing to inoculate your own population first is risky in a democracy.
13415,We have not run out of things to try as far as encouraging people to get vaccinated.
13416,We really haven't.
13417,So let's not jump to conclusions.
13418,"What does the choice of 2 adrenovirus vaccines, both with blood clot fears achieve?"
13419,Not for all of us!
13420,The vaccine put me into a severe UC flareup!
13421,"Plus, we dont even know if it works for us."
13422,So sick of people coming in here acting like they're so smart and they have no clue what they're even talking about.
13423,I agree.
13424,I really don’t know what some people are expecting.
13425,"At it’s core, it seems those people are at their max capacity for caring, but are painting a more agreeable “we have to go back to normal at some point” stance over it."
13426,"Like you said, essential business should not be allowed to unmask for the time being."
13427,"Grocery stores, pharmacies, even banks."
13428,I don’t care about someone feeling slightly uncomfortable for the half hour it takes for them to grab their bananas and bread.
13429,"If it means more people will stay safe while we continue to vaccinate the world, I’m always on that side."
13430,This post appears to be about vaccines.

13455,I agree that’s way too high.
13456,We are at just below 85% of the 65+ age group with a dose and younger age groups are obviously going to be far more hesitant.
13457,We also don’t know if there will even be an approved vaccine in the under 12s by then.
13458,I don’t buy this narrative that given enough time almost everyone will come to understand that the vaccines are extremely safe or they already know that and they’ll find a convenient time to get it someday.
13459,Israel crossed 60% before the start of April and has yet to cross 63% of the population with a dose because there just aren’t many eligible people who want it left.
13460,I mean my girlfriend works in an ER and told me about it yesterday.
13461,You’re hearing it straight from the source.
13462,I’m not suggesting the vaccine isn’t effective but people need to realize it’s not a cure.

13470,"I get that perspective to an extent and I'll be continuing to wear a mask in stores despite being vaccinated, but in reality, vaccinated folks pose very little risk to others."
13471,But perhaps wearing a mask still will help pressure the non-vaccinated to continue to do so as well.

13480,had a whole lot of population and got a whole lot of representatives anyway.
13481,"You might've been thinking of the ""three-fifths compromise"" which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for apportioning the House of Representatives."
13482,The slavers wanted them to count as whole people to maximize their representation (since slaves couldn't vote); delegates from free states wanted them to not count at all (so the slavers would have less power); they eventually settled on three-fifths as a compromise.

13508,Vaccines teach your immune system to fight Covid without having contracted it.
13509,If you don't have a functioning immune system they aren't going to work as well.
13510,Still they have been very effective at reducing deaths among the high risks groups.
13511,Without them our elderly would have literally been decimated.
13512,We have many millions of undocumented residents.
13513,Caring about a persons origin isn't something we can really do when combating covid.
13514,?

13540,Ok so the link I posted before has a great Q&amp;A video with the head of neurology at Vanderbilt.
13541,At the 7 minute mark they start discussing if people who have had GBS should get the vaccine.
13542,He actually talks about the frustration that some states didn’t have  prior GBS as a reason to be in the first group of vaccines which tells me he feels they are more than safe for the GBS community.
13543,If I was in your medical situation and didn’t have an active neurologist to discuss with  I would watch that video and take in some of the information and use it in my decision making.
13544,It’s clear not being vaccinated is causing you anxiety so all you can do is arm yourself with as much info as possible.

13551,"But now it's looking like for some people, it was never really about the expert opinion, or the science, it seems more like just a way to oppose conservatives."
13552,"Now that the experts are recommending something that makes it harder to make a distinction between whose a liberally following their guidelines, and whose a conservative who thought the restrictions were excessive, there's a group of people who are throwing a fit."
13553,It's ridiculous and childish.

13574,Vaccinated people are not the ones who need guidance because we're not the ones causing the problems.
13575,Kinda of like how all of sudden people on this sub are posting that they know people who have been fully vaccinated for a while and caught covid and are in the hospital.

13582,Very true!
13583,What you mean is there isn't enough data for anyone to be justified in their fear.
13584,My doctors have specifically said they haven't seen anything to make them concerned.
13585,"Just because there ""isn't enough data"" for you to accept it doesn't mean there's cause to alarm people."
13586,"But again, that's why I specifically suggested they talk with their doctor instead of assuming they're at risk."
13587,Mine said I'm not so I am comfortable following the CDC guidelines.
13588,"If theirs has reservations about their own situation, then that's for them to determine."
13589,What it doesn't mean is that we assume every person with UC/Chrons or any other autoimmune disease is on the verge of death when they walk out of their home.
13590,We've been at this for 14 months and vaccines have been given to 100+ million people in the US and we have yet to hear specifically that there's increased risk to us.
13591,Why should I assume there will be?
13592,That's not a small sample size and included in that group are certainly thousands of immunosuppressed individuals.

13596,Well tbh even though I’m fully Vaccinated I’m still thinking for some reason that meeting a fully vaccinated friend outdoors or indoors is still unsafe due to breakthrough cases and mixed messaging.
13597,I’m also concerned the vaccines will lose effectiveness and we have to start over.
13598,The CDC says you can hang out with fully vaccinated individuals outdoors or indoors but I don’t know if that’s safe anymore with variants.
13599,Can someone clarify this?
13600,"Fair point, but in that case you end up with 35 infected instead of 100."
13601,There's no getting around the fact that the majority of Americans now have immunity to Covid and activities that were very risk a year ago are significantly less risky today.
13602,Those were the estimates used to justify the lockdowns because that’s what would happen if there weren’t lockdowns.
13603,This isn’t hard to comprehend if you put down the fox news sippy-cup.
13604,"""don't let your guard down"" and ""impending doom"" convey two very different scenarios IMO."
13605,"Then what’ll happen next is they’ll recover and still downplay it because they didn’t die, and now they’ll say they have antibodies so they don’t need to vaccine (even though vaccine antibodies are stronger and last longer)."
13606,Not to mention how many people they spread it to in the meantime and all of the people those people spread it to etc.

13618,I expect the fear of missing out on the $1m will be even stronger than if it was only pulled from the immunized roles.

Government: “What a dumb idea that has zero data behind it that proves it works”

Person at meeting: “Well, there’s actually a lot of data, such as—“

Government: “NEXT IDEA!"
13626,I know!
13627,"We’ll go on TV and ask people to get vaccines!”

Does the federal government not want herd immunity?"
13628,Ohio has literally given them the answer and there STILL hasn’t been a National response.
13629,How hard is it to ask Powerball to do something similar?
13630,"Oklahoma is not testing, we have an uneducated ""christian nationalist"" governor that has followed dj's hate rhetoric."

13632,"It's all hate and racism here in Oklahoma, nothing changes."
13633,Thank you.
13634,I don't think it will cause spikes.
13635,There's 2 types of people in this pandemic: those that follow mandates and those that don't.
13636,Those that followed the mask mandates will continue using masks if they're not vaccinated.
13637,Those that don't follow mandates already weren't following it.
13638,So it'll be roughly the same amount of people not wearing masks that should be.
13639,"If by bullshit you mean actually underreported, then yeah, you're right."

13643,"First of all, no one has flip flopped on masks since the beginning of the pandemic when we didn't know how it was spread and we didn't want people to hoard (like we always do) masks when hospitals needed it the most."
13644,"Once we knew how it was spread, and hospitals were covered, it's been masks masks masks and always masks."
13645,"When new science has come out, like on outdoor transmission, surface transmission, we've updated guidelines and recommendations accordingly."
13646,These are just facts.

13651,"And no matter what the *real* mortality rate is, we have millions and millions of people dead from a disease that's overall pretty easily preventable if we stop being selfish assholes for a minute."
13652,"Wear a piece of cloth, keep some distance, stay home for a bit."
13653,That's all we had to do and somehow that was too much for this country.
13654,"It's pretty goddamn sad the same country that mobilized for World War II is the same country, within a single generation, that tore each other apart over an airborne particle and three ply pieces of cloth."
13655,Think about that for a second.
13656,"I mean, truly, think about it."
13657,"And if you don't feel absolutely ridiculous yourself and as a country, then I don't know what to tell you."
13658,"If we'd come together and done that as a country in the beginning, when we could barely hold it together for two weeks, for a few months, we'd have been out of this by Thanksgiving."
13659,"But here we are, more than a year later, finally making some progress."

13680,"&gt;So if we extrapolate your thoughts out on being a burden on the public, we should outlaw alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, etc."
13681,"We shouldn't ""extrapolate"" anything because different things need different solutions."
13682,Alcohol isn't the same as a cigarette.
13683,Your drinking won't give someone else second-hand liver damage.
13684,"You driving while drunk can negatively affect other people, but this is already outlawed."
13685,Helping prevent people from drinking themselves to death is something I feel we could do better on.
13686,"&gt;Again, that's too slippery of a slope and I can't go there."
13687,Liberty dies not with a grand feature but a small nibble here and there.
13688,Much like a frog if you slowly turn up the heat in a pan they don't realize they are being cooked.

13690,You're assuming a lot will happen while painting a scary picture with no real support on that actually being the case.
13691,"Going from protecting people during a pandemic to people having no personal liberties (or being ""cooked"" as you say) is quite the tall order."
13692,"Is it possible for someone to make it so that kids can get vaccinated for covid without a parents approval, like how minors in some states can get birth control without parents consent?"

13970,"That’s fair in most instances (exceptions for children or the immunocrompromised, etc.)."
13971,It’s very likely that we’ll see spikes but it’ll be in communities and regions where people don’t take it seriously and don’t get vaccinated.
13972,"My point is just that the CDC didn’t say masks aren’t necessary, they explicitly said that they are necessary for unvaccinated people."
13973,Yes but statistics aren’t always reliable.

14065,4% of adults in the US are immunosuppressed.
14066,That does not account for those who can’t get the vaccine for other reasons.
14067,"Last week, before 12 year olds were eligible, first vaccines went up."
14068,"Hard to explain why they waited, but people still want it."
14069,"NPR is pretty close but I think NPR doesnt reach as many people as cbc especially for news

There's way too much money in cable news echo chambers in the states and people watch those instead be it fox news or CNN or w/e"
14070,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076v1

&gt;The modest neutralization resistance of the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618 variants."
14071,i’m one of them!
14072,second shot june 3rd 😎
14073,I think that is a big reason for the free Uber and Lift rides to and from vaccination locations starting next week.
14074,They're slowly releasing solutions for those hard to reach groups and those unable to get to vaccination sites.
14075,"Crumbs make bread, every little bit helps."
14076,1/300k kids have died from COVID.
14077,Nobody's going to keep adjusting their life to accommodate that risk.
14078,"That's how it was before COVID with other diseases, and that's how it will soon be in the aftermath."
14079,Thanks!
14080,I'll take a look.
14081,"Side note, with methotrexate, I was offered that as part of my treatment but when they told me about some of the side effects, like possible birth defects for any kids I have in the future, I noped out of it."
14082,"Other than the Covid risk, how has methotrexate been for you?"
14083,No they didn't.
14084,[removed]
14085,Yes but the difference is that now they don’t have to worry about being infected by their friends and bringing it back home and infecting their family... hopefully.
14086,[removed]
14087,Because they want widespread death and illness to continue.
14088,"WHY they want varies by person, but I think a lot of people were miserable and alone before, and kind of liked that so many people were forced into that world involuntarily."
14089,This just proves that “long covid” isn’t actually a thing
14090,"59% of adults, 47% of total population."
14091,Wearing masks is the single easiest thing you could do to protect others.
14092,There is hardly any downside to telling others to wear masks indoors.
14093,Closing businesses is an option if there are high caseloads that threaten the medical system.
14094,I think it’s pretty obvious by now business can stay open with masks because there is very little spread in high masked areas.
14095,Most spread is happening in gatherings when people are unmasked.
14096,If you had the option to keep businesses open with masked customers or force to close down altogether wouldn’t you agree that it’s better to just wear a mask?
14097,It's a tax on hope.
14098,That wasn't my experience.
14099,"The first one I found was yesterday and I was looking, hard."
14100,"Lots of Moderna, hardly any Pfizer to be found."
14101,"The pharmacies around me were only doing Moderna,  or appointments got snapped up fast."
14102,They're not wearing a mask to keep from shedding virus.
14103,"They're wearing a mask because they have kids who can't get the vaccine and still have to wear masks themselves, and they're little enough that it would seem unfair if they had to wear a mask and their parent didn't."
14104,So the parents wear them too.
14105,"Found this aaaallllll the way at the bottom, lol

“Update: A coronavirus vaccine was administered to the first U.S. citizen on Dec. 14."

14192,"Just for some context, an R of .99 would technically be herd immunity, since widespread outbreaks would be impossible, but if you were starting at 100k cases per day, it would take 3 months just to get down to 35k cases per day."
14193,Herd immunity doesn't mean everyone is immune.
14194,It just means widespread outbreaks won't occur because there are too many immune people blocking the path to exponential growth.

14221,"[An abstract](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00983/full) I’ve also heard some chatter that the same tech might lead to a much more effective flu shot, and possibly the elusive HIV vaccine."
14222,Only the headline mentions first doses increasing.
14223,The article doesn't talk about them at all.
14224,"The onyl chart that discusses first doses is just a total of first doses given, no trends or anything."
14225,"Given that their source is the CDC and the CDC shows us that first doses didn't go up, are you fine with saying this was botched reporting?"
14226,"I mean, I'm not really even sure where they got that chart with the green bars."
14227,"I guess back-fill eliminated that increase (see the note about data being revised) because if you look at the CDC chart for total doses, there's no increase between ~May 5th and May 11th."
14228,"Probably not, most of the rural hospitals in my area send all of their Covid ICU patients to the nearest medium or large city."
14229,"As someone who is making the “kids and immune compromised folks” argument, here’s my reasoning."
14230,1.
14231,Not every parent can easily leave their kids at home and go get groceries.
14232,Some parents are single and can’t leave their child with a spouse.
14233,"Some places don’t offer delivery or curbside, or charge an unreasonably high fee."
14234,This is especially true in rural areas.
14235,This would also be a concern for the immune compromised.
14236,2.
14237,Children have sacrificed a LOT the last year.
14238,It doesn’t seem reasonable to tell them now that they basically have to return to lockdown or get exposed.
14239,It seems far more reasonable IMO to require adults to mask so that kids can safely go places.
14240,3.
14241,Many states are dropping mandates at schools.
14242,"Others have kept mandates at schools but are finding that once the mandates are gone everywhere else, the anti mask crowd starts pushing back hard on having them at schools."
14243,"Once you drop mandates at schools, you are forcing kids with high risk conditions to choose between their education and their health."
14244,"Once those high risk kids can access a vaccine, that isn’t as big a concern, but we aren’t quite there yet."
14245,For me it really boils down to feeling that asking healthy adults to wear a mask is a much smaller burden than asking children to risk exposure every day.
14246,"If we truly had a way to enforce that only vaccinated adults were going mask-free, I would be onboard with that, but we don’t."
14247,And the idea of someone getting really sick when we are this close is frustrating.
14248,It’s like tripping right before the finish line.
14249,But how does that make someone a degenerate?
14250,Playing the lotto does not make one immoral or corrupt.
14251,You'll be alright.
14252,Just do your best to relax your arm when they put it in.
14253,I once got a shot when my arm was super tense because I went to the doctor for something else and was very distressed.
14254,That time it hurt a lot and I was scared to go again.
14255,"The next time the nurse told me to relax my arm, almost like your arm's a puppet arm."
14256,I didn't even feel it.
14257,"Your milage will vary ofc, but the advice helped me."
14258,After you get it the more you move your arm the less sore it'll be later.
14259,So having karate later is probably a good thing.
14260,And then there's my county sitting at a pitiful 33% and barely budging.
14261,This guy is begging for more COVID
14262,"Like I said, kudos to those who did go on their own to get vaccinated without bribes."
14263,[deleted]
14264,The testing infrastructure just isn’t there.
14265,Lol.
14266,I was always taught only gamble with money you want to lose.
14267,"In my state, we use the lotto to help raise education funds."
14268,I'm going to guess you don't have kids
14269,Why should they waste hospital resources?
14270,I think 85% is unrealistic ...
14271,I've always said that 70-75% is the more attainable figure and even that is going to be an uphill struggle.
14272,"Thanks to the previous administration's contracts, there are severe constraints on how the US can export its vaccines."
14273,"That's why the first shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines (4 million to Mexico and Canada) was officially classified as a loan, not as a donation."
14274,"They want to help, but it's not as easy as just loading a truck from Pfizer's Michigan facility and driving it all the way north haha."
14275,"Meanwhile, if some Canadians can and want to travel for vaccines, they should be allowed to."
14276,"AZ has not.. although it seems like it's almost identical to J&amp;J, they just caught the potential blood clots earlier.."
14277,"I went with Moderna, I was concerned about Pfizer since it seemed to have more allergic reactions in the beginning and I get weird reactions to some meds."
14278,Moderna still kicked my butt but was worth it (I hope!)
14279,"Technically, herd immunity should mean new infections slow down a *bit* further than they have."
14280,We should only see small localized outbreaks once we’re there.
14281,But I think we are close.
14282,The government bad blah blah conspiracy true blah blah
14283,My kid has gone through 75% of her braces during covid.
14284,"Going to 2 days of school a week only for the past month, masked."
14285,Hardly seems fair to get to skip brace face.
14286,Wow.
14287,Thanks for the info
14288,[removed]
14289,People in Texas wore masks.
14290,"If you went to the rural shitholes then yeah, they didn’t, but cities and suburbs did and had amazing compliance since like June of last year."
14291,When restrictions were lifted nothing changed.
14292,The places that were masking still kept masking and the places that never did didn’t change.
14293,"I think we’ll be good with the vaccines now that things are actually being lifted, but literally nothing changed after we lifted restrictions in March, everyone kept wearing them cause businesses all kept the same restrictions."
14294,Every person is a win.
14295,Nice!
14296,Put em in a jar and shake it up.
14297,Young people have a 99.99995% survival rate…..
14298,"&gt; any truth to this

No."
14299,Eg: https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/05/14/123-lakh-death-certificates-issued-in-71-days-gujarat-daily-has-an-eye-opening-front-page-story/
14300,Does he not realize that these local mandates are what kept the COVID case counts in Texas relatively low over the past several months?
14301,"An unvaccinated health care worker set off a Covid-19 outbreak at a nursing home in Kentucky where the vast majority of residents had been vaccinated, leading to dozens of infections, including 22 cases among residents and employees who were already fully vaccinated, a new study reported Wednesday."
14302,"Most of those who were infected with the coronavirus despite being vaccinated did not develop symptoms or require hospitalization, but one vaccinated individual, who was a resident of the nursing home, died, according to the study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
-NY Times"
14303,I was agreeing with you.
14304,"I know a lot of people who said a lot of things, then got vaccinated when it was their turn."
14305,The most antivax friend I have whose own kids have no vaccines got one last month.
14306,I can see this playing out before me in my own town and surrounding areas.
14307,"Anti-mask/anti-lockdown movements seem to be tied to the right side of the political spectrum, but ontario is currently being run by a conservative government and people are still protesting."
14308,People are ready to protest when they don't like what the government is doing even if they would typically align with them on the political spectrum.
14309,"So functionally it went 

1."
14310,Vaccines normally take a long time to develop so under 1 year is highly unlikely even though Trump is promising this.
14311,2.
14312,"Trump says ""go faster"" 
3."
14313,Actual scientists work day and night and find the breakthroughs required to create a vaccine in under a year.
14314,4.
14315,"Somehow Trump gets credit for saying ""go faster"" while denying every other anti-covid measure?"
14316,"Funny how most anti-maskers would say ""well it's that business's right to refuse to serve someone"" when a gay couple wants a wedding cake and a bigoted bakery refuses, and can't see the irony that they're getting violently angry when a business shows them the door for not wearing a mask."
14317,My teens are going today!
14318,"They’re both irritated that they might feel like crud, but I’m so happy to add another layer of protection for my family."
14319,it makes no difference to the children.
14320,what harms the children are the unvaccinated not the vaccinated
14321,NPR is very soft hitting attempts at not upsetting anyone.
14322,It’s hardly in the same league.
14323,There’s a reason they aren’t known for breaking much news.
14324,When was the last time you were out and about?
14325,I'm honestly asking.
14326,I live in Dallas and I've been out and about this weekend and mask usage is like 10% of the people I'm seeing inside of places.
14327,"It was good before, but after the recent CDC guidance, I've seen many businesses stop requiring masks and immediately mask wearing plummeted."
14328,Where are you that's actually closed?
14329,The only restrictions have been masks for months now.
14330,Fair.
14331,"I was like ""sputnik v?"
14332,"no thanks, I'll wait for moderna/pfizer.""."
14333,"It took me 2-3 months to change my mind (and a lot of googling, talking to friends etc) and I'm hally that I got this yesterday."
14334,(But overcoming my fear was...Realllly hard)
14335,"""So there's actually zero deaths?!?"""
14336,"""No, we're just reporting it"""
14337,"Frankly, this is another failure of public health policy."
14338,The cooties have been stigmatized on playgrounds across the country for decades.
14339,"This only encourages children who become infected to hide their infections from their peers, including members of the opposite sex, and greatly increasing the risk they're putting other children at."
14340,"Additionally, false accusations from other children cause possible cases to be missed because adults assume the children are simply ""crying wolf."""
14341,"I hope that after all that we've seen in the last year, we can finally get the relevant agencies to make some progress in eradicating this hidden plague."
14342,[removed]
14343,[removed]
14344,"The California Building Code (CBC) requires signs at all public pools as follows:  
A sign in letters at least 1 inch (25 mm) high and in a language or diagram that is clearly stated shall be posted at the entrance area of a public pool **which states that persons having currently active diarrhea or who have had active diarrhea within the previous 14 days shall not be allowed to enter the pool water."
14345,"** 

How do you propose businesses and local govt leaders ensure that people follow that advice?"
14346,I hope by end of this year you guys are done with Covid.
14347,I hope this spike ends in days or weeks.
14348,I lived in New York during NY’s awful spike and then the entire US’ spike.
14349,I have friends in Brazil and talked with them daily during their spike.
14350,It’s awful and depressing that it could be even worse in India.
14351,"I am so sorry to see you guys going through it, and I hope you beat it back as quickly as possible cause we need your help in vaccinating the world."
14352,"Be safe, friend."
14353,Ahem.
14354,"Masks, social distancing, lockdowns and isolation was done centuries ago."
14355,It was the main way we controlled early diseases.
14356,Although the science behind it was never understood back then.
14357,"My state (Oregon) had 8 deaths over the weekend, but our 3 largest counties had zero."
14358,The few deaths we do get tend to be in the counties with lower vaccination rates.
14359,Vaccines work.
14360,This needs to happen
14361,Biden originally said 70 percent by July 4th.
14362,He should have stuck to that instead of caving in
14363,[removed]
14364,"I dunno about any US voters, I'm in Canada so just referring to the Canadians I know."
14365,"&gt; being incredibly unlikely that they'll be eligible in time to be fully vaccinated by October 1st

Why?"
14366,Vaccines son
14367,"lol, oh, I told her."
14368,She was like... “so do you even think this virus is a big deal anyways!
14369,"?”  

I blinked twice then replied:
- my friend from high school was one of the first 100 people in this country to die from COVID."
14370,He was 34.
14371,I found out about it on the news.
14372,"- my mother (is critical care nurse, and) got COVID from the first positive patient she interacted with."
14373,Then gave it to my father.
14374,They were both ill for 2+ months.
14375,- my sister lives and works in NYC.
14376,She also got COVID.
14377,The hospital on the block where she lives in Queens had bodies stacked up outside.
14378,My parents were really upset and worried they couldn’t go to her.
14379,"Thankfully, everyone has since recovered."
14380,Yeah but it's sort of their job to know the difference!
14381,I used to be able to.
14382,It's not that I lack the skills or desire.
14383,"&gt;Wear masks in public places for the first few weeks of every January and carry some hand sanitizer

I like where you're going, but I wonder if Januari is when it spikes everywhere simultaniously?"
14384,Probably not right?
14385,Someone probably knows
14386,Well put.
14387,"Anyone reasonable who actually reads the [Vegan Society's definition of veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) understands that taking any of the vaccines falls under the ""as far is possible and practicable"" exception."
14388,Massachusetts here.
14389,"A friend of mine freaked out on Facebook about how wrong it is to lift restrictions until EVERYONE (yes, everyone she clarified) has the vaccine AND all those with Covid are FULLY recovered."
14390,"Like, holy shit."
14391,I understand the hesitancy a bit.
14392,"But those requirements are completely impossible and never going to happen, and you are saying you’ll accept nothing less."
14393,Some people really are delusional about the risks and a return to normalcy.
14394,The India variants aren't too different from other variants we've seen.
14395,It's just a unique combination of mutations found in other variants.
14396,I haven't seen real life studies yet but lab studies with antibodies indicate it shouldn't respond any worse than other variants to vaccines.
14397,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076v1
14398,"Wow, the states with no restrictions have no deaths, makes you think 🤔"

14400,Where are you?
14401,Because things for sure seems different where I am.

14406,This 100%.
14407,its never gonna be a big thing in the US because of our individualist culture but I’m hoping to see a reduction in cold season.
14408,Then again we still need to remind people to wash their hands so I’m probably just setting myself up to be disappointed lol
14409,I have no problem with anyone choosing to remain masked.
14410,That's oversimplified.
14411,Abbott dropped the mask mandate before I could even get a vaccine (36yo male).
14412,My wife is high risk and she was still waiting to get her turn too.
14413,A few weeks after the mandate everyone finally got a chance to get vaccinated.
14414,April 22nd was when I got my second shot and I was contacted immediately when they opened it up to everyone.
14415,So for over a month we had no mask mandate and many people not vaccinated.
14416,"At this very moment, anyone that wanted a vaccine could have gotten one by now."
14417,A lot of people do have vaccines.
14418,It's silly to continue the mask mandate.
14419,"When the CDC announced it, it seemed a bit premature, but I trust their guidence on it."
14420,"Part of it is, if you get a vaccine, and are still told to wear a mask, why get the vaccine with all the horror stories."
14421,"But lifting the mask requirements and recommendations for vaccinated people encourages people to get vaccines, which is more important than masks right now."
14422,"I don't know what ""those people"" are but I'm sure some people want to mask forever and that's fine, but there's definitely reasons why it was a bad idea back in March and we're in a much different spot now."
14423,"Yeah, we handled it so well that despite having almost beat it we still lead the world in cases and deaths."
14424,Really well handled.
14425,"If handling it well is letting it run across the country while idiots conspire, and then getting a lot of vaccines because the country is wealthy sure we did amazing."
14426,Successfully made fun of a lazy friend until they set up a vaccine appointment.
14427,Sometimes roasting works lol.
14428,Where are you seeing that last week they went up?
14429,7 day rolling average has done nothing but go down since early April.
14430,"(This can be seen in the CDC links/charts I posted)

Unless you're talking about the daily posts in the comments of the Rueters article which involves reporting delays and the number of shots reported so it can have all sorts of weird artifacts."
14431,That’s completely reasonable by me.
14432,Or require some sort of special hour for at risk people or priority/free curbside pickups.
14433,[removed]
14434,Then we'll just migrate to /r/rhinovirus and complain until the rest of the common cold is cured?
14435,"(for those that don't know, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza make up the majority of ""common cold"" cases with adenovirus making up less than 5% of known cases)"
14436,"It’s America, baby!"
14437,We’d rather contribute to people dying than wear a piece of paper over our faces in essential businesses!
14438,"
What’s the source of the virus ?"
14439,did you read the article before posting it?
14440,including the official and detailed CDC review?
14441,"from the CDC review ""association of vaccination with hospitalization in this SNF population might have limited generalizability."""
14442,now I am well aware that you could die from a single thunder in a thunderstorm and if I tell you to move to an underground bunker for the rest of your life will only be for your own good.
14443,"but if I tell ""everybody"" to move to an underground bunker because thunders do happen and stop life on the planet as we know it then I'd be called ""irresponsible"""
14444,There's actually more then your anecdote that have died.

14446,The current tracker would be current total.
14447,"Insightful comment, thanks"
14448,I was going to wait until summer break (like 2 weeks) to take my teens but they wanted to get it done so we went Saturday.
14449,Many may be waiting for that.
14450,"even one dose provides quite a bit of protection from the virus, Covid is running out of new places to go."
14451,good.
14452,What's your proof?
14453,The issue is that the little people may need a lower dose.
14454,If they do and if so to what extent is something that has to be established in trials.
14455,For flu shots kids up to age 3 get a half dose.
14456,YEP.

14504,How about being reasonable and keeping masking rules at essential places that vulnerable people have to shop like grocery stores and pharmacies?

14589,"And about 35,000 deaths where covid was a contributing cause."
14590,"So by their own admittance there's about 130,000 excess deaths from other reasons."
14591,Delta gets to avoid all of that.
14592,"Their current staff are merely ""encouraged"" to get the shot."
14593,New staff must have chosen to get the shot before they'll even hire them.
14594,Neither group will be protected by the OSHA policy if they have adverse reactions.
14595,The COVID vaccines haven’t passed phase 3 &amp; 4 clinical trials and aren’t approved for human use would be two great reasons that make them different.
14596,One case does not make a surge.
14597,"Florida, Texas, Arizona and (Southern) California (and probably elsewhere) all had a dramatic rises in cases starting in mid-June of 2020."
14598,It was speculated at the time that this had to do with more people spending time indoors in the A/C due to the weather (no idea if this has been backed up).
14599,"*Edit just noticed my first post had ""sure in cases"" not ""surge in cases"" which may have been the cause for confusion."
14600,Man it’s gonna feel weird when this is all over.
14601,"For better or worse, I think this pandemic is gonna be in our collective conscience for years to come"
14602,Down in SW Florida and it's all trumpers and conspiracy nuts.

14608,"I really haven't seen the CDC basing their recommendations on ""popularity""."
14609,Maybe you missed everyone complaining about them telling us to wear a mask?
14610,"The first time I put on the mask, I was transported back to when I was 25 and I was strangled to death (my heart stopped for over a minute) by a guy with a towel, and has lead to pretty pervasive PTSD flashbacks that make me sob on the floor at least once a day at work."
14611,"The flashbacks start when I put it on and dont abate till I take it off, and no, it hasnt gotten any better over the past year."
14612,"The last year and change has been Hell for me, and its not like you can get a dr's note, I cant give the virus a dr's note not to infect me, and Im high risk for three different issues."

14634,I'm curious to know if there are precedent cases where under 12s had a significant reaction (or unreaction) to vaccination absent to the rest of the population.
14635,"I personally call the lottery ""stupid tax."""
14636,"But yeah, tax on hope is probably a nicer way to put it."
14637,The best way to evaluate these claims is to look at excess deaths.
14638,You can typically find graphs of how many people die in a normal year and compare that against how many are dying in 2020 and 2021 to get a (reasonably) good idea of the true death toll from Corona.

14642,"You can find more recent ones if you want, but my goal here is to give you some idea of what's going on in India so I wasn't concerned about getting updated US numbers."
14643,But the main take away point is that you can see that previous years were generally *very* consistent and 2020 total deaths (and therefore also excess deaths) were *way* up.
14644,The nice thing about using excess deaths is that you can't really hide behind claims that doctors or hospitals are lying.
14645,"It's very hard to hide anything when using excess deaths and in fact, almost and data manipulation will *undercount* excess deaths."
14646,Meaning that using excess deaths will give us a conservative number of deaths and in reality there are actually almost certainly at least a little bit more Corona deaths than what excess deaths shows us.
14647,2020 and 2021 have been SO far away from normal that it just isn't reasonable to assume that the extra deaths came from anything except for Corona.
14648,And you would actually expect deaths to be *lower* in 2020 and 2021 because people are sitting in their home a lot more instead of going out and doing things.
14649,"Less going to bars and drinking, less drinking and driving, less sports, less travel, less driving to work, less deaths from other contagious diseases like the flu, etc."
14650,So we can actually be highly certain that the excess deaths is *still* undercounting the true deaths from Corona.
14651,"Ok, so all of that was to explain the concept of excess deaths and why it's a good measure."
14652,"Next question, what does India's excess deaths situation look like?"
14653,Here is an article that talks about excess deaths in India (and in other countries).

Use Ctrl f ""India"" to skip to the relevant parts."

14656,"India has recorded about 248,000 deaths from Corona, but based on excess deaths they are definitely closer to 737,000."
14657,"Apparently to the point that just being near someone who recently got vaccinated can cause infertility, which is the biggest load of shit I've ever heard."
14658,Most people don’t even know or care where it’s coming from tbh
14659,Why is it ridiculous?
14660,Gotta think stupid to know how to get the stupid people to buy in.
14661,Or they believe that antivaxxers getting infected is a good thing because it will accelerate herd immunity.
14662,It's one of those cases of privilege levels being off the charts.
14663,Not only was the US one of the absolute first nations to vaccinate but people aren't even taking advantage of that immense opportunity and need to be bribed with money.

14668,I was one of the 60% who did get symptoms but they were very mild.
14669,The shot was far worse.
14670,I had to call in sick the next day and spent the entire day in bed with flu-like symptoms which has never happened with any other shot I've ever had.
14671,All for something that I didn't need because I had antibodies already but felt pressured into getting because I didn't want to be limited with things like travel and events.
14672,This is why it shouldn't be mandatory.
14673,If you want to chance it then it should be your right.
14674,Yep!

14680,65+ will hit 90% this summer if they can keep this rate up.

14686,&gt; My indian employee (in the states) says it’s all just for show/propaganda because hospitals and doctors get more money for covid cases over other regular hospital business.

14695,3rd highest cases and deaths YESTERDAY.
14696,Third highest population in the country.
14697,Why would you expect FL to not be in third place?
14698,Also the **rates** of all these metrics has been falling for weeks.
14699,Raw numbers are irrelevant at this point.
14700,FL is currently 20th for case rate and 27th for death rate nationwide.
14701,But please don’t let these facts get in the way of your agenda.
14702,"I am

14703,Worst case next Friday.
14704,So the government is controlling their population by giving their citizens free money?
14705,The pandemic is over soon so those lost jobs are coming back.
14706,Those sentiments about not going outside seem absurd.
14707,Outside was actually one of the few places that felt safe as long as you were masked up and socially distanced.
14708,Remember when J&amp;J getting approved was gonna be the gamechanger 😐
14709,did you read the article before posting it?
14710,Genius?
14711,including the official and detailed CDC review?
14712,"from the CDC review ""association of vaccination with hospitalization in this SNF population might have limited generalizability."""
14713,now I am well aware that you could die from a single thunder in a thunderstorm and if I tell you to move to an underground bunker for the rest of your life will only be for your own good.
14714,"but if I tell ""everybody"" to move to an underground bunker because thunders do happen and stop life on the planet as we know it then I'd be called ""irresponsible"""
14715,"It seems like cases have nowhere to go but down, and that's why this decision was made."
14716,"If cases continue on this downward trajectory, we will be under 100 deaths a day nationally in a few months."
14717,We get through every flu season with deaths like that.
14718,"The CDC has got to feel that collateral damage from no masks will be low, and it could convince some part of the hesitant to get with the program."
14719,"It also put an abrupt end to the, ""If vaccines work, why the masks?"""
14720,trolls overnight.
14721,(Which were immediately replaced by parents of kids under 12 and immunocompromised people screaming that vaccinated people must wear masks because the unvaccinated are untrustworthy.)
14722,Unfortunately nothing moved much today.
14723,WoW comparison is especially bad because last Tuesday's numbers were abnormally good compared to typical Tuesdays (which are always a bad day).
14724,7 day moving average is now back down to where we were in February.
14725,Expected but still disappointing as I was hoping we would at least see a slight flattening of the downtrend as the 12-15 data came in (even though it's a very tiny group).

14748,I feel like from a pure laziness standpoint (let alone many other reasons) it’s far easier to just get a vaccine then go through the effort of finding and buying a fake vaccine card.
14749,Well clearly this conversation isn’t helpful to anyone.
14750,Have a nice day and take care.
14751,Your article is from over a month ago.
14752,They have continued to monitor the data and have come to the conclusion that risk of spread from a vaccinated individual is extremely low.
14753,So low that Fauci said Sunday you don't need to wear a mask if you are fully vaccinated but have asymptomatic covid.

14767,Yup.
14768,This came from the California Nurses Association union.
14769,They are claiming it’s a “big blow to the safety of nurses and frontline workers”.
14770,If they feel that strongly about safety surely they have all been vaccinated?
14771,Am I missing something here?
14772,If they are vaccinated they are protected.

14778,This will be interesting.
14779,It will come down to finance.

14796,"https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/02/dengue-second-infection/

&gt; ...found that when antibody levels fell to a certain point in children who had been previously infected, they were at greater risk of having severe dengue disease if they were again infected."
14797,"In fact, for children whose antibodies fell to within this low range — a sort of anti-sweet spot — the risk was nearly eight times higher than for other children."
14798,"In contrast, higher antibody levels were protective against severe illness."
14799,&gt; The belief is that low levels of antibodies cannot neutralize or kill the invading viruses.
14800,"But they do bind to them and effectively usher them into susceptible cells, where the viruses then replicate."
14801,I thought Andrew Wakefield was the person who really got the vaccine conspiracy theories going?

14803,Yeah you're fine.

14805,Indeed.
14806,"And for me personally, the pandemic has been very humbling in many ways."
14807,Which is a good thing.
14808,there's so many people here who think they know better than one of the worlds top government health organizations.

14819,My risk tolerance is higher and I'm fine with the 95%.
14820,My self defense is the vaccine not the mask.
14821,"No, literally all of the evidence so far we have is that the vaccines are effective against mutations and people with the vaccine do not spread COVID."
14822,"Being ""thoughtful to others"" only counts if there is some actual tangible benefit."
14823,You want vaccinated people to wear masks for the same selfish reason that vaccinated people don't want to wear masks: because it satisfies your concerns/desires.
14824,"With vaccinated people, they feel they did their job already, so they feel like they deserve not having to wear masks."
14825,"In your case, you're paranoid and want to feel secure, so you think others should have to accommodate for that."
14826,"That's entirely what it is, don't try to paint this as being ""thoughtful to others""."
14827,It's a no tangible benefit move that makes you feel more comfortable.
14828,population density does help..
14829,I think our weather helps a lot too.. even in Winter it's warm enough to gather outside.
14830,Summer weather has settled in here now so people are outside as much as possible.
14831,"This guy is not the Federal government, he's in fact in the opposition and runs the local government in Delhi."
14832,But it was still a dumb thing to say.
14833,"Lol... you Americans are fucking insane, no regard for the lives of others."
14834,"800 cases is still a lot of people being hospitalized and going broke, or maybe slightly less tragically dying."
14835,"But no reason to care, right?"
14836,"600 cases per day is 220k deaths per year, well outside of flu season territory."
14837,We'd need about 150 deaths per day to be in flu season range.
14838,Yeah.

14858,thanks for that.
14859,well said
14860,Really because what I’ve seen is the reverse.
14861,A lot of “if you don’t want to force vaccinated people to wear masks then you don’t care if children/immunocompromised die”.
14862,and then after a couple years they are fervently into a new thing
14863,Take a look at the nytimes article.
14864,The scientific evidence is unclear.
14865,And this is not about punishing.
14866,It’s about being thoughtful to others in their time of need when the opportunity cost is quite low.
14867,Very few people followed mask mandates at any point where I live.
14868,"Now I see maybe 30% masked, probably those who realize that the county has only vaccinated 21% of the population and is unlikely to get many more."

14871,Bruce Lee is not an expert on immunology.

14877,I think it’s a hard metric to look at.
14878,280 died during mask mandates and lockdowns.
14879,"With over 30% of the US adult population not taking the vaccine and mask mandates dropping, kids are definitely going to be exposed in a way they were not previously."

14883,"Really poorly written article that presents no data, just kinda asserts weird general things about peer pressure some people might be experiencing."
14884,Not a single specific anecdote referenced.
14885,"If you're vaccinated, you should feel safe to remove your mask."
14886,Or don't!
14887,Everyone is free to make their own choice as they feel necessary for their own risk tolerance.
14888,Just looked at y'all's numbers and those are much better.
14889,Only \~250 new cases per day there.
14890,Though your vaccination numbers are worse than around me and your cases are far better.
14891,I'm guessing the population density is making a major difference.
14892,in all likelyhood the astrazeneca vaccine is still quite effective at preventing severe disease and death.
14893,it may underperform in regards to preventing mild to moderate illness but more studies must be done.
14894,"the chinese vaccne siphoram has already been shown to be lackluster against even the wild variant in Chile and Seyelles, however their death rate continues to be very low compared to the infection rate."
14895,Can't report deaths if there's no one left alive.
14896,[removed]
14897,It’s a good question.
14898,I don’t know.
14899,"But with the variants changing and being significantly more contagious, I don’t think it’s worth taking a chance."
14900,Well for one we are a lot closer to having the entire country rely on the govt for income.
14901,Tons of jobs available but no one wants to work because the govt is providing good unemployment.
14902,Look man long story short I am afraid that this country is someday going to look exactly like china and the CCP and that scares the shit out of me.
14903,Rome was not built in a day and each step we take toward dependence on the govt is another peice of the puzzle.
14904,but we must protect our children : all the anti-mask and anti-vax idiots MUST wear a mask
14905,Do eet!

14910,[removed]
14911,No it's not.
14912,There are no such things as miracles.
14913,The only reason why it takes so long to get a vaccine approved is because it typically has to go through a lengthy and exhausting approval process.
14914,All of that was waived here which was understood at the time that 'fact check' was made.
14915,If it was so hard as to invoke a 'miracle' to get done then there is no way that half a dozen companies would have simultaneously developed their own version.
14916,Lol yeah wasnt the supposed covid vaccine microchip diagram a boss metal zone or something?
14917,I'm about to plug my guitar into my belly button after work.
14918,This is ridiculous.
14919,We can easily eliminate quarantine for vaccinated people with a proper testing protocol.
14920,"A couple of airlines tried this sort of thing and got attacked for being ""anti mother"" or family or something"
14921,The partial immunity combined with SA variants slower spread may keep it at bay.
14922,Hopefully keep it at bay
14923,"With international travel, I honestly don't see why countries can't just make a vaccine passport and make it a mandate to be vaccinated to come into the country."
14924,I think it would be better to do that and encourage Canadian businesses with getting income via tourism over setting a very high bar before you open up.
14925,"I think Hawaii is planning on implementing something like that within the next month or two, so I'm not sure that Trudeau's policy here is necessarily the right one."
14926,Actually that’s not what I’m saying.
14927,"There are a number of people in the US who are unvaccinated and because there is no enforcement mechanism for proving who has a shot and who doesn’t, some portion will take advantage and continue to spread the virus."
14928,That’s encouraged by the mask mandate being lifted.
14929,It’s an idiotic policy that people will take advantage of.
14930,"And also— kids cannot yet get vaccinated and don’t seem to get as sick, on the whole, but DO spread the virus."
14931,"And, if you read up, we actually don’t know whether vaccinated people may be able to spread the virus, although the likelihood seems low."
14932,This could change as variants develop.
14933,"My point is that it takes very little to protect vulnerable people, so why not just require them in essential businesses?"
14934,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-walensky.amp.html
14935,There is of course no study.
14936,Very early data shows that it looks like vaccines protect well but it will be a few weeks before it is confirmed.
14937,"The official line has been, we don’t have evidence that it will be an issue to stop opening up (another step happened Monday) but things may change by time final restrictions are lifted (June)."
14938,One example of evidence are infections (in one area) with this variant for under 60s are higher than those 60+ (more likely to be vaccinated).
14939,This is a good idea but costs money (not using store hours efficiently) So... good luck.
14940,How to get fired 101.

14942,"Honestly I'm not usually a fan of profile stalking, but when it uncovers that you think the vaccine itself is going to cause auto immune disorders, it's well worth the effort."
14943,"You probably shouldn't get the vaccine, honestly."
14944,Just do me a favor and don't convince people you actually know in real life to not get it because you trust your stupid monkey brain more than scientists.
14945,Pretty close to as good as you’re going to get.
14946,"Don’t lick any strangers, but you’re basically good to go."
14947,"Maybe, im not expert."

14952,"I think you’re misunderstanding which comparison you should be making Yes, there are factors that change the impact of the virus, and they do vary by state."
14953,But this doesn’t mean you should make direct comparisons between states to determine which states need higher rates of vaccination.
14954,"Instead, the correct comparison is the outcomes of higher rates vs lower rates within the same state."
14955,"And, yes, those states with higher vaccination rates will have better outcomes than that same state would if the vaccination.rate we’re lower."
14956,"No matter how you slice it, the higher the percentage of unvaccinated and COVID-naive people there are, the more potential hosts there are available to continue the spread."

14970,"If they start quarantining people without saying anything, they look 1000x worse."
14971,"They understand, but they consider themselves to be low enough risk that they don't bother to go."
14972,"It's not even about being antivax, it's just not feeling the need."
14973,"Make the vaccine compulsory to go back to school or enroll in college, and most of them will suddenly feel the need."
14974,"I mean, you that is cool we know the long term effects and all!"
14975,"For such a new development it is insane to see we have data to tell us +5, +10, +20... 

:)."
14976,"and now that the genie has been let out of the bottle, good luck getting it back in for the next several months."
14977,it's going to take multiple deaths and packed ICUs for several months to overcome the intertia to put any measure in place again.
14978,And of course half the states will still refuse to do anything even after the inevitable high profile deaths that are going to happen.
14979,Your post is astonishingly ironic given the vaccine neither stops contracting nor transmitting the virus.
14980,Additionally the efficacy of your vaccine is not dependent on another persons status.
14981,Oh okay so the usual shit hole states I never visit anyways.
14982,"Sorry New Orleans, no vacation there this year..."

15024,"If you look at the current speed and rate of vaccination, end of July is really a realistic date for ending vaccination."
15025,A lot of people are frustrated by the older age groups taking so long time - but that’s because of the smaller supply when they started the vaccination.
15026,"Also, so not forget that many younger people are vaccinated because of high risk and due to their healthcare profession, so the younger groups will go much, much faster than the older groups."

15043,"&gt;No, this is very different to all those small outbreaks in NZ."
15044,The peak daily case load in the August cluster was 13 and very quickly fell off to 2 to 4 cases a day.
15045,The only other outbreak of a community cluster in NZ was the February one and that never had more than 4 cases in a single day and was limited to 3 families in the end.
15046,"&gt;  
&gt;Taiwan has just had more cases in a single day than the entire August and February outbreaks combined in NZ."
15047,"NZ population: 5,128,650  
Greater Taipei (only) population: 7,047,559 people

NZ population density: 19.0/km2  
Greater Taipei (only) population density: 2,862.7/km2  
Taipei (only) population density: 9,700/km2

&gt;That means it has been spreading silently within Taiwan for a lengthy period of time, probably several weeks."
15048,Regular surveillance testing as we do in NZ would have caught it earlier.
15049,And so some escaped the system.

15062,That’s not what OP claimed though.
15063,OP claimed that being a child‘s immune system is more resistant to COVID than a vaccinated adult.
15064,I love how you’re getting downvoted for this.
15065,The amount of people who are now vaccinated on this sub and could careless about those who can’t get vaccinated is amazing to me.
15066,Just as selfish as anti- vaxxers.
15067,Now that they’re “safe” no one else matters
15068,Sprouts
15069,Yeah I’ve seen some people that are (somehow) afraid of both COVID and the Vaccine so they’re kinda being forced to pick the lesser of two evils (obviously the vaccine lmao)

15076,Ah.
15077,"Well the first comment looks like it was in the wrong chain, too."
15078,"Wait, why were they whining about wanting American vaccines for the last five months?"
15079,I really don’t agree with this interpretation.
15080,"Most hesitant people (not anti-vaxxers, they’re a lost cause) are genuinely considering the benefits and drawbacks on a personal level, not just trying to evade government mask rules."
15081,"The CDC changing their guidance from “you have to wear a mask to be protected no matter whether you’re vaccinated or not” to “you’re safe and no longer a threat to others, mask or not” is meaningful to anyone in that category, and gives them a real incentive to get vaxxed that they might not have perceived previously."
15082,Bullshit.
15083,"If they were concerned for looking better than China, they wouldn't have announced this many cases today."
15084,"This exponential growth is similar to how it happened in my country in March 2020, nothing unusual in it."
15085,It will.
15086,Around June 10th Canada will either hit 70% of it's population with at least one dose (the imaginary 'herd immunity' number people often quote) or us m if demand drops off then we'll be onto second doses
15087,That's still months out though.
15088,[removed]
15089,"Yeah, I’m aware of that."
15090,That doesn’t necessarily mean that my kids are protected from catching it and spreading it.
15091,"I know there’s lots of data that suggests that kids are poor carriers and don’t seem to infect others the same way adults do, but I haven’t seen anything that says it’s equivalent to a vaccinated adult."

15094,I thought you were answering to someone else.

15096,Money talks.
15097,The federal government can find the extra cash to fund all these absurd programs.
15098,Why not offer more as an incentive to those who are unvaccinated?
15099,Ahhh I'm glad I don't live in the sticks.
15100,"It’s also the fact that no other viruses have been circulating due to everyone staying home, refraining from normal activities, and schools being closed."
15101,"The mask isn’t that magic, unless it’s a well fitted N95."
15102,This isn’t a good thing to be reinforcing your OCD.
15103,There’s a reason it’s a diagnosed illness.
15104,Do you have a therapist you can talk to?
15105,If you can’t afford it I’ll buy you a year free on something like better help.
15106,Honest offer.
15107,Just don’t want you suffering
15108,Time for jobs to make vaccination a requirement.
15109,Make it mandatory for schools and travel via boat or plane.
15110,"Your statement is possible, even probable (depending on what vaccine you took), but not factual."
15111,"They aren’t being forgotten, they just don’t make up a significant percentage of those who experience severe illness and death due to this particular virus."
15112,"There is guidance available for children with these underlying conditions, as well as guidance for residential care facilities for children (many of whom having underlying conditions)."
15113,"However, the focus is still the elderly and the general adult population."
15114,And a major issue with approving the vaccine for kids too soon has to do more with perception than with safety.
15115,"If parents perceive the risk of the virus to their children to be extremely low (which is statistically validated), and they perceive the risk from the vaccine to be higher (which has not been shown, but pushing it at an earlier time makes many in the general public think there hasn’t been enough time to discover the true risk to kids), then they simply won’t get their kids vaccinated anyways and the rates will remain low."
15116,"Also, (and this is just me throwing it out there with nothing to really back it up, so take it with a huge grain of salt) I think if kids could have gotten it earlier, then those parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids would be more resistant to changing their minds later when more time had passed and safety were assured (almost like not wanting to admit to being wrong—I know it sounds petty, but a lot people do kinda work like that even if they aren’t thinking it consciously)."
15117,"So—again, totally talking out of my ass—maybe the long-term rates of acceptance would be lower if approval for younger and school-aged children came too quickly."
15118,the last couple years have shown that mankind is perhaps not all we'd hoped it was.

15127,It sounds like you’re saying kids are just collateral damage so you can get laid.
15128,Kids aren’t in bars or other adult places but they are in grocery stores.
15129,Maskfree bars are fine but a grocery store?
15130,Covid has just brought out the amazing selfishness of people
15131,"Well, I fact you need to wait 3.5 weeks till fully vaccinated anyway, so it's really only half a week extra."

15141,[removed]
15142,Yes
15143,You keep making this same point every minute or so but you're wrong every single time you try.
15144,"It's absolutely not that people think that their vaccine doesn't work if someone else isn't vaccinated, it's that each time the virus spreads it has a chance to mutate, which it is already doing, and eventually it may mutate in a way that makes the vaccines ineffective, but I suspect you already know that and are choosing to feign ignorance."
15145,"While there is still some slight chance that you can spread covid while fully vaccinated we both know that it is a ""significantly* lower chance that if you're unvaccinated."
15146,"I'm also gonna guess that your ""paper out of Sweden"" is bullshit too just like the rest of your comment."
15147,At least you didn't say strawman.
15148,Also no go ahead and get the vaccine that's cool.
15149,It's the ppl who constantly up what must be done to go back to normal life.

15156,"Yeah, I totally get it."
15157,I don't even follow news that closely anymore because the headlines just get out of hand sometimes.
15158,"For my own mental health, I try not to jump on every headline or breaking news story I see and just wait for more time to pass."
15159,A lot of news we see never pans out to something serious and just fades into the background.
15160,I've lived in Asia for many years so seeing people in masks just isn't that weird for me anymore.
15161,But I completely understand why some people don't like it.
15162,Even I don't want to wear them all the time forever.
15163,Even people in Asia don't wear them 24/7.
15164,They still have flu outbreaks in Japan every winter even with mask culture.
15165,I've been wearing masks on planes for a few years now because I was getting tired of getting sick all the time.
15166,It's definitely helped me not get sick.
15167,I'll be fine if in the future I have the choice to mask up sometimes if I want to.
15168,"If I don't want to, I won't."
15169,The pandemic has really messed with me psychologically as well.
15170,"It feels weird to think of taking off my mask indoors but I know I'll eventually get over it, just need that push."
15171,I think the best part about this is that it gives people who are reluctant about the vaccine time to get it in time for re opening.
15172,"If its a month away, it gives people the chance to schedule their vaccines now and be okay by opening day."
15173,"Yes, but no today."

It’s been over a year now since the very 1st volunteers got their shots, and over 150 million people in the US have gotten at least one shot."
15178,That’s a lot of chances for side effects to show up.
15179,"On the other hand, the long term risks for complications from Covid are much greater, even in those under 30."
15180,And that’s just what we know right now.
15181,&gt;‘We’ve reached two important conclusions.
15182,"Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases the risk of CVT, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes."
15183,"Secondly, the COVID-19 risk is higher than we see with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination.’

15197,"In the past, pandemics have been recognised by the WHO when a few countries have infections."
15198,"This time, they waited until the whole world were infected to call it."
15199,This influences countries decision making on travel and kills people by proxy.
15200,Why did they do this?
15201,Because China are a bully and use their influence (and bribes) to force the WHO's hand in protecting their reputation.
15202,"&gt;  
&gt;The WHO is much more involved in worldwide geopolitics than medicine, and is a worldwide organisation unlike the CDC."
15203,Are you suggesting that the CDC has no influence with the WHO?
15204,"That the WHO does not consider what the CDC does, even though the CDC is probably the most influential of all of the national health agencies on the world stage?"
15205,"My point is, you can't analyze the WHO in a global vacuum, especially in the world of geopolitics."
15206,National health agencies most definitely play a part in what advice the WHO gives.
15207,"At the very least, they form a baseline or a comparison."
15208,Dialogue goes both ways.
15209,"You can argue that the WHO was pandering to China, but masks would be a poor example of such."
15210,"China was probably one of the highest rates of mask adherence; the WHO's advice of not needing a mask is least likely to be heeded by the East Asian countries, since mask wearing is part of their culture."
15211,"Western countries on the other hand, bought into that advice before the advice changed."
15212,"Once again, not sure how you can use that as an example as pandering to China."
15213,"I'm not defending China's actions here, to be clear, they most definitely blocked access for the world to conduct proper investigations into the coronavirus."

15270,They found that they could statistically attribute masks with a 1% difference in cases and deaths which in any study is completely within the margin of error.
15271,"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm


And this is published directly on the CDC website so if you're going to try to argue with it then I don't know what to tell you."

15273,Why spend money on a hoax?
15274,"If all you have is a sore throat and a runny nose for a whole week, that just sounds like a common cold to me."
15275,Wouldn't worry too much about it if the symptoms don't change.
15276,That’s literally unrelated to the question
15277,I think your auto mod is a bit over zealous.
15278,"Yep I agree there unfortunately, the Deep South + Fl and TX will be the last stronghold of Covid in the US EDIT: oh and Utah isn't doing great with vaccinations but hopefully they will be protected by their more responsible neighbors"
15279,Why do you need to bring your kids inside of a store?
15280,There are plenty of options for people who don't want to go into a store now.
15281,That's great news!
15282,Today's numbers were pretty bad.
15283,I was expecting (hoping?)
15284,that 12-15s would start to flatten the overall curve a tiny bit.
15285,"Although if the issue was today, it won't affect the numbers until tomorrow at the earliest?"
15286,The CDC data is always a couple days behind from when pharmacies submit data to state departments of health.
15287,[removed]
15288,It's not a gamble.
15289,The UK did the same thing.
15290,"From a mathematical standpoint, if your vaccine efficacy is greater than 50 percent on the first shot, the societal effects of getting 48 percent of the population single dose is better than getting 24 percent of your population double dosed

UK studies have already shown that a 12 week gap improves antibody response on Astra and Pfizer vs a 3 week gap"
15291,Anyone vaccinated can also cross the border for an essential medical reason and not quarantine.
15292,"It’s not about vaccination proof, it’s about proof of essential medical travel."

15296,2.)
15297,I'm actually surprised at this.
15298,"I follow PA because that's where I came from (in NY now), and I have a lot of family there still."
15299,"The anti-vax sentiment runs strong, not only in my own family, but when reading the comments on the local news stations."
15300,I hope that it's just a matter of a very vocal minority and a hush hush majority is getting vaxed but not talking about it because they don't want to deal with the crap.
15301,This is especially the case in presidential-type governments like what we have in the US where the head of government has limited say in what the government does.
15302,"With parliamentary systems, however, it is very fair to say the head of government (the Prime Minister) is more responsible for governmental success/failure."
15303,Prime Ministers have direct control over the legislative and policy agenda; presidents do not.
15304,Yea it’s totally fine.
15305,You might feel extra tried and sore tomorrow though!

15310,"November 27, 2036 ""Mind yous thought that vaccine was gonna kill everybody, ya fuckin wallopers??"""
15311,Ask them how many people the vaccine has killed vs how many people covid has killed.
15312,Quite possibly the worst argument in a long history of terrible arguments lol
15313,"At least in developed countries, rules are going to change quickly over the next 1-2 months as more and more countries see the virus under more or less complete control from vaccines."
15314,"There will be a greater willingness to allow travel because even if someone comes back with COVID it won't matter if the population is effectively immune (although some countries may continue to worry about the SA variant, especially those that have relied on AZ and/or less effective vaccines like Sinovac)."
15315,I’ve got a couple friends who I was also surprised to hear weren’t getting vaccinated.
15316,I could care less as they already had covid and I’ve had my vaccine.
15317,I do hope they get it once the FDA fully approves it but it’s none of my business.
15318,Kind of.
15319,I'm expecting the NE and West coast to basically be virus free by the end of the summer.
15320,But here in the southeast there's just not enough uptake.
15321,It'll be around 5-10 per 100k for a long time tbh.
15322,"The assumption, whether correct or not, is that the people who want the vaccine will be fully safe by June 15, based on when everyone can get it."
15323,"I do think it should have been moved to 6 weeks after 12-15 could get it, but that would be too unpopular because asking someone to wear pants or shoes or a shirt to go into a store is awesome, but a mask is a step too far."
15324,I was able to exercise and do a 4.5 mile run the same day as my first dose.
15325,"One thing I did notice is that my strength stayed the same but I did gas out quicker, so maybe you shouldn't bike as far as you usually do."
15326,"&gt;I personally think the CDC should have waited and just lifted the mask mandate entirely in June, but the goalpost moving that I see for people defending maintaining the mask mandate is ridiculous."
15327,Pretty much.
15328,"Problem is, if they would have lifted it in June, you'd have people saying they should have waited until July."
15329,"If they'd have waited until July, people would have said end of summer."
15330,"""End of summer"" would be met with ""wait until 2022."""
15331,So on and so forth.

15343,Astra Zaneca is the vaccine common in rest of the world.

15345,"I am just saying I want to see a peer reviewed study showing that they don't

In lab tests they are shown to be 6.8 times less effective, but effective enough in preventing serious disease."
15346,So variants can get more dangerous.
15347,"If viruses could not evolve against vaccine we would have had dengue, HIV etc., vaccines."
15348,Indeed.
15349,We have (for the most part) affixed our own mask; now we can help everyone else with theirs.
15350,WHAAAAAAT!
15351,"Indian here, I've lost multiple friends and relatives in their 30s and even 20s personally."
15352,People are lying on the road in front of hospitals with oxygen cylinders.
15353,The entire Indian twitter is full of SOS requests with people literally begging.
15354,My city has seen an explosion of Black Fungus cases after COVID.
15355,"The stock of injections used to treat them which was sufficient for a year worth of cases earlier has been used up in less than a week, people are rotting from within and we have NO medications for them."
15356,Every news paper's obituary has a separate page for COVID deaths.
15357,I'm personally stuck in a lockdown far worse than last year.
15358,Even grocery shopping is allowed 3 days a week for 2 hours only.
15359,Many of the poor people are on verge of starving because of no work since last month.
15360,"Its not a propaganda, its a sad reality."
15361,What's worse is that this has ruined the mental health of almost everyone I know.
15362,"Depression is so rampant because of economic hardships, personal hardships that people are facing."
15363,"I had to leave social media for a week because of the depression caused by seeing the entire feed of well-off people begging for oxygen, hospital beds and medicines."
15364,TLDR - Your Indian employee is either lying or doesn't have a accurate picture.
15365,What if I push an anti-lockdown message as a result of the numbers in California?

15370,"In the end, it comes down to money."
15371,Its already pretty evident that stores and businesses requiring masks are losing customers to those who don't require it.
15372,"It sounds silly, but alas, that is the reality we live in."
15373,"If given a choice, people will go to the businesses that don't require them."
15374,"Now some businesses may not care and continue to enforce masks, but after a year of shutdowns and uncertainty, I see most businesses changing their tune to try and recover quicker by transitioning to a 'mask recommended' stance."

15389,"To be fair, the UK has the NHS which is about as centralised as a Healthcare system can get, putting aside the fact that there is an NHS England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and NHS Northern Ireland."
15390,The NHS have the contact details for practically everyone in the country when working alongside the local GPs.
15391,"Combine that with the information on how old people are, what medical conditions people have, where they live, etc, and the NHS can plan who, when and where people will be able to get the vaccine."
15392,"The strength of the NHS is when there is a national medical emergency, like coronavirus."
15393,"The NHS can be slow to get going, down to a lack of funding, but once they're moving it becomes hard to slow them down."
15394,a smart gov would have saved $3 million and offered everyone who gets a VAX a $150 RESTAUNT VOUCHER.

15396,GREAT FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY!
15397,!
15398,I know he’s not and that’s why getting rid of mask mandates when so many people can’t get the vaccine is pretty callous in my opinion
15399,"That is one of the many failed vaccines from last year, we are talking about the current and accepted vaccines."
15400,Are you trying to be this dense?
15401,They are not a threat to you.
15402,Just to themselves and other unvaccinated people
15403,Because the CDC never said the unvaccinated could go maskless.
15404,Very few antimaskers will get the vaccine.
15405,"Since stores are enclosed places, unless you have some way to weed out the unvaccinated from the vaccinated, there is no way to allow the vaccinated to go maskless without endangering those who are in the process of being vaccinated."
15406,Wearing a mask is more effective if the other person is wearing one too.
15407,Waiting until those who want the vaccine can be fully vaccinated means the bad actors amongst the antimaskers have to wait until the majority of those who want the vaccine are at the safe mark.
15408,The science doesn't say let people run amouk.

15411,Kids will be vaccinated in sept. We really should wait until then.
15412,Why are people upvoting this silly comment?
15413,"By the same logic, local governments shouldn’t be able to tell individuals what to do!"
15414,This is just the rule of law.
15415,The American rule of law divides decision making power between the federal government and the states.
15416,That’s it.
15417,No further subdivisions are in the US constitution.
15418,So there’s no mental gymnastics required.
15419,"Error in that article: ""Even though the United States has never had vaccine supply issues...""

We had serious supply issues until April."
15420,"Back in February they canceled 100,000 appointments in my area because of canceled deliveries."
15421,I worried for the 2nd shot appointments my parents had in March.
15422,The lid really didn't come off until mid-April.
15423,Just over a month from that now and people assume it was always the way it is now.
15424,It was not.
15425,And then subsequently being wrong because the risk in reality turned out to be much less than the perceived risk.
15426,I took the AZ vaccine as I'm not a moron with a poor sense of personal risk assessment.
15427,You think he will be the only one now.
15428,It’ll be happening daily with this new rule
15429,Fair points.
15430,"&gt;Meanwhile, the President would probably get chosen by Congress."

15432,There are actually many regulations that exist to protect children from accidentally drowining in pools/hot tubs.
15433,"In the city i live in, any pool/hot tub has to be completely fenced in, and if it's not and your neighbors kid drowns in your pool you are criminally liable."

15444,If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
15445,Or if you're really that upset about what I said you can simply block me.
15446,Thanks
15447,I'm a literal teenager.
15448,One thing to remember and take into account.
15449,"For every TX county that enacted local Covid prevention mandates, there was at least one (probably more than one TBH) TX counties that decreed that all Covid prevention measures were to be considered strictly voluntary within the county last spring and which also refused to enforce Abbott's statewide mandates while they were active."
15450,The pandemic situation in TX has been complex.
15451,So far two of my friends have told me they are not getting vaccinated.
15452,To me that is quite shocking as I considered them relatively educated.
15453,To refuse the vaccine because 'it kills people' and 'it's a chemical' is absurd compared to taking your chances with the virus....anyway...my question : I won't be able to convince them otherwise.
15454,"If I get fully vaccinated, do they pose any kind of threat to my health?"
15455,"Are they having a negative effect on others, because they are not vaccinated?"
15456,Or is it really *shrug* well I guess you do you and hopefully don't end up in the ICU?
15457,"There's also the entirely apolitical reality that rural areas are not as dangerous as urban areas in terms of spread, so personal risk assessment is different among rural people."
15458,You should probably wait.
15459,"The side effects come on rather suddenly, and you don’t want to be halfway through your ride when you suddenly need to lie down."
15460,"Speaking of the UK... we've now got 2,323 cases of the Indian variant (a 77% increase in less than a week.)"
15461,It could become the dominant strain within a matter of days and poses a very real risk of putting the country back into lockdown.
15462,"All because Boris didn't shut the borders, which is absolutely the first thing you should be doing when enacting a *national lockdown*"
15463,"Texas has had vaccines available to every adult since the end of March, and it is nearing the end of May."
15464,These rules will not go into effect until when the new school semester starts in August/September.
15465,Every adult capable or willing to get their shot will have gotten their shot by then.
15466,Anyone immunocompromised or unable to get the vaccine will take the same precautions that they have always had to take precautions before the pandemic.
15467,Those willingly choosing to not get the vaccine will deal with their own personal responsibilities of making that choice.
15468,&gt; It’s one of the most vaccinated states so far.
15469,Right now it’s dead easy to get a vaccine (I’m in the LA area).
15470,"Man, you're right."
15471,"We should drop this ridiculous mask mandate today, like the rest of the country."
15472,A twelve to fifteen year old determined to do a thing can most certainly put unrelenting pressure on parents to get it done until they give up and do it just for some peace.
15473,"I know some who are that determined, mostly because they had a family member with severe covid or dead from it."
15474,There’s also nine states where minors can get vaccinated without parental consent.
15475,My state is one of them :) But it is often hard to find a doc to do it.
15476,I’m just glad most of my coworkers are vaccinating their kids ASAP.
15477,We had a flurry of last minute time off requests to accommodate since most took any available time slot they could get in the past few days.
15478,I encountered a nurse on Reddit that thought SARS-CoV-2 mutated more rapidly than *HIV.

15480,"That is a large chunk of India,  extreme poverty,  no education and religious dogma."
15481,"It’s also really helpful for reaching groups who have inconsistent access to medical care, like homeless people."
15482,"I remember my first real office job out of college when I would drive 15 miles each way from the suburbs to downtown, and that drive would take me 45mins-1hour each way."
15483,I would be sitting in my car FUMING with anger over the idiot drivers I'd be sharing the road with.
15484,Every new route I tried had the same problem.
15485,"I would sit there and think ""this is so unhealthy, how can I possibly do this every single day for the rest of my miserable life""."
15486,I would have never guessed that out of this pandemic I would be relieved of that awful burden.
15487,pretty sure banning a country that has high COVID rates is racist... at least that's that was claimed when Trump did it
15488,Send 'em to Mexico***
15489,And being a good example.
15490,Am I the only one who is just gonna keep wearing masks when I go to stores and the like?
15491,Naturally...
15492,"Saw a comment about California not lifting mask mandates until June that said...

""It's so refreshing to live somewhere sane and see 90% of people still masking and the other 10% are white guys in their 60s."
15493,"White privilege at its finest!"""
15494,"The blatant elitism, delusion, and hypocrisy is so so so painful to read..."
15495,It’s still pretty high.
15496,I'll just keep doing curbside pickup from Target like I have been throughout the pandemic.
15497,"Not going in the store keeps me from making any impulse purchases, so it's a win all around."
15498,Why does it mean nothing.
15499,Other people are free to do what they want.
15500,"I just think there is such a low chance of a child dying from COVID, that it's not something I need to worry about."
15501,I wouldn’t doubt it honestly.
15502,We’re doing horribly with reopening.
15503,I was hoping having a recall would light a fire under Newsom’s ass
15504,EXACTLY!
15505,Why take the risk?
15506,"It's better to be cautious and take the precaution instead of subject either of them, even my non-predisposed child, to what could potentially make them very ill!"
15507,&gt;but I feel like I want keep my 11 year-old home and masked even though she already has &gt;97% resistance.
15508,This is exactly where I am.
15509,I have a 3 year old and an 8 month old.
15510,The 8 month old has met 4 adults in his entire life.
15511,The 3 year old hasn't seen another kid his age (except from a distance at the park) since his birthday in Feb 2020.
15512,"Neither of them have ever been any kind of sick, do they still have this resistance?"
15513,I hate all of this.

15515,Everyone ought to watch it once.
15516,"In many ways, this pandemic was a best-case scenario."
15517,"Relatively low death rate, responsive to treatment, vaccines quickly developed."
15518,Health care system never overwhelmed (in the US).
15519,The only riots and looting we had were for other reasons.
15520,This was the dress rehearsal that we ought to get use to get ready for the big game that we know is coming one of these days.
15521,And how do you propose to restrict the private lives of the unvaccinated?
15522,Saying mission accomplished if you get them to wear a mask beneath their nose at the supermarket doesn't mean they're following anything else.
15523,It's not like anti-maskers or anti-vaxxers followed any social distancing throughout the pandemic.

15581,I'm a Cvicu RN who has taken care of people on the front lines since this started.
15582,But yeah.
15583,Thanks for the compassion of others.
15584,Exactly what I thought.
15585,Don't leave mad bro.
15586,Just try a little harder next time.
15587,This is awesome for vaccinated workers.
15588,"It's one place where children dont go (workshops,  offices, warehouses etc) so I see zero need to keep masks on at work."
15589,"/s

You dropped this."
15590,It is great news.
15591,It is also not generous.
15592,Vaccinating Canadian truck drivers who drive through North Dakota regularly does more to protect people living in North Dakota from Covid19 than vaccinating farmers who live in North Dakota.
15593,"Ditto everything you said, and I'm in the Midwest, too."
15594,"Not everyone in the flyover states is a dumbass, thankfully."
15595,"Man, the CDC really fucked up by removing the mask mandate."
15596,"So saddening for people who can't get the vaccine, be it immunocompromised, children, etc."
15597,They are beyond fucked.

15624,If you’re vaccinated it’s not saving any lives.
15625,Half of the customers at my local grocery store weren’t wearing masks after things got lifted.
15626,I know cases are dropping in the US but I think it’s definitely best to keep masks on for a little longer.
15627,Especially with the new strain from India spreading...it looks pretty bad tbh
15628,There’s a lot worse problems from long covid than losing some sense of taste.

15633,There is also a COVID vaccine

15635,I appreciate you taking the time to discuss it.
15636,It’s not “fear-mongering” it’s a simple concern.
15637,"I guess I come from it as a Doctor put it, the vaccines are a fire suit."
15638,It protects you from getting burned.
15639,But you don’t intentionally walk into a building on fire.
15640,I feel the situation caused by this knee jerk CDC guidance is that it puts me into building fires in these indoor places of business.
15641,That’s all.
15642,"It’s just a concern, but I sincerely hope you are correct."
15643,Not wearing a mask when vaccinated doesn't impact anyone.
15644,Muh two weeks!
15645,Lol what a nut
15646,But how else can we ensure that the virus will keep mutating and eventually become resistant to vaccine?
15647,What did those people do before COVID?
15648,Can't they just do whatever that was?
15649,[removed]
15650,"We have an uv lamp, thanks for the confidence in us 👍"
15651,"Well the spike protein is how the virus is able to enter cells, the protein that makes up the spike is a specific shape that matches up to human cells to enter them."
15652,It would have to mutate to a protein that the antibodies cannot bind to yet still be able to bind and enter humans cells.
15653,"It’s Not all that likely, you might need boosters to keep efficacy up over the years though"
15654,Sorry.

15665,With the AstraZeneca vaccine the decline begins from 14 to 20 days after vaccination and reaches and odds ratio of 0.44 (95%CI 0.35 to 0.57) from 28 to 35 and 0.42 (95%CI 0.28 to 0.62) from 35 days after vaccination equivalent to a vaccine effectiveness of 58%.

15831,There are risks involved in every decision.
15832,"One part of the scientific discussion is absent any preexisting health problems, covid most likely posses very little risk to her, as does the vaccine."

15834,"Not all of them are hypocritical, at least."
15835,I have contamination OCD and this has set me back years of progress.
15836,It was really unhealthy to have to give my intrusive thoughts life and action.
15837,Everything I had fought against doing for so long was now a good behavior for protecting oneself in a developing pandemic (I refer to is as developing because advice and best practices were morphing and changing quickly in the beginning).

15839,I will recover and be okay.
15840,"Plus, OCD is never truly gone."

15848,You're extremely defensive which is weird.
15849,Animosity became directed shit measures that weren't even precautions.
15850,"2020.02.06: My friend's mother who is Chinese, had a transfer flight that originated from Bangkok that goes through Taiwan, who won't even set foot on Taiwan soil, was blocked from transferring flight and had to be stuck at the airport and rebook flights."

15852,"This was only directed at Chinese, and one who happened not to be in China for the previous two weeks."
15853,Other nationalities went on their merry way.
15854,Let me remind you that US officials who already brought the virus to Canada and Japan before were allowed to enter Taiwan without quarantine in August.
15855,That's the kind of measures in place.

&gt;\&gt;That's what everyone is doing everywhere now."
15857,What's your problem?
15858,No problem lol.
15859,"But you're pointing to a well made plan and suggesting Taiwan made sweeping effective changes, when they've been just doing what they used to do."
15860,&gt;I don't know what you're trying to say or prove.
15861,"If you believe an infectious disease that get caught multiple times by other countries, only manifests after the plane leaves Taiwan just so Taiwan can boast about 1xx days of no new infections, then obviously you wouldn't know all sorts of things."
15862,"&gt;Yo, public health expert... show me where that's the narrative?"
15863,The point has always been containment without jeopardizing the health system and the economy.
15864,That is why contact tracing is given high priority.
15865,What you don't know is that I'm actually really a health expert.
15866,I said in 2020 April that social distancing and flatten the curve are shams.
15867,"Wearing masks and stamping out the virus like China, Australia and NZ is the correct way and look where we are."
15868,Oh wait the contact tracing you mentioned always gave back 0 results.
15869,So much for contact tracing.
15870,&gt;Your faulty reasoning results in faulty conclusions.
15871,You trying to justify China's block of a health contributors in the name of politics is simply middle-school grade.
15872,"Really not sure how Taiwan who has problems with water, electricity, testing, and vaccines can claim to be the model for the world, but if you're so supportive maybe your country can copy Taiwan's method."
15873,"The rest of the world didn't invite Taiwan only because of China lol, other than the anti-China group of countries everyone knows what's up."

15888,Stop talking out of your ass and look at all the data that literally proves the vaccine stops transmission.
15889,The reason for young people needing to be vaccinated (despite low risk) is that variants could mutate and appear if they don't.
15890,"Until now variants have only been more infectious, but if we don't do something about them they could change completely and not only be more deadly but also be completely immune to the vaccines, so all these months of getting all the at risk people vaccinated would be in vain and a whole new vaccine would be needed to be developed + tested + distributed which would take another year and cause a whole bunch of unnecessary deaths."

16070,"&gt;Jenny McGee said she was ""taking a step back"" from the NHS after her ""toughest year"" in the job, but hoped to return."

16072,The government has recommended a 1% pay rise for NHS staff this year.
16073,"&gt;Ms McGee also told the programme, The Year Britain Stopped, that ""a lot of nurses"" felt the government ""hadn't led very effectively"" and that there had been ""indecisiveness"" and ""so many mixed messages""."
16074,"&gt;She said it had been ""very upsetting""."
16075,The nurses should strike.
16076,A 1% pay rise after all they went through and are still doing?
16077,Meanwhile trillionaires and billionaires are raking in the cash.
16078,It’s doesn’t take a crystal ball to see a large nursing shortage happening in the UK.
16079,Even the nurses who come to the UK for an Immigration benefit will see that it’s not worth it.
16080,I literally said in the first sentence that they influence each other.
16081,"I think you're just arguing for the sake of arguing, and you don't know the full picture of the situation."
16082,The WHO made many terrible decisions that benefitted China.
16083,"The CDC did not make these decisions, as they do not control the WHO."
16084,"In some specific cases, they both made recommendations in parallel based on outdated studies (such as social distancing), but this is not what I'm talking about."
16085,I'm talking about geopolitics.
16086,"The fact that the WHOs job is to let people know about new diseases, investigate said diseases, and call a pandemic in order to give advice."
16087,The CDC is not involved in this.
16088,They just relay some information that the WHO say and let people in the USA know.
16089,"I don't know why you have this focus on the CDC, it is not their job to put pressure on countries when new diseases emerge."
16090,"It's the WHOs job to try get information out of countries, to prevent spread, and to give the world advice."
16091,"I don't care about the CDC, I am talking about the WHO."
16092,Forget the CDC.
16093,Then years from now there will be COVID deniers that deny this ever existed
16094,[deleted]
16095,And that's fine.
16096,Everyone should decide their own risk level and not guilt others for moving at a different pace.
16097,Thats for when you get a shot in the ass.
16098,We about to beat this sucker
16099,Yeah they have ramped up a bit though lagging behind NY and CA (the other Big 4 population states) hopefully they hit their goals by the end of the summer (Fl probably sooner due to their high percentage of senior citizens)
16100,"Deaths were still around 700 three weeks out from the april case peak, and cases have fallen by more than half."
16101,We should be looking at mid 300s by mid June.
16102,You should get the vaccine said anything like that stop spreading lies get vaccine we will never herd immunity with that negativity.
16103,I am vaccinated and have RA there is no reason you should either get vaccinated!
16104,But you are a raging hardline fanatic.
16105,"Covid is not a problem for kids, this is science and at this point there is not much to debate, unless you have some new data."
16106,"If you feel you need to be a white knight about it you need to be concerned about old people, obese people and males - these are the risk groups."
16107,Leave the kids alone.
16108,Keep the mask mandate in place for unvaccinated people and get rid of it for vaccinated people.
16109,Which is exactly what the CDC said
16110,So sorry for these patients.
16111,This is why so much cancer treatment and operations were stopped at the height of the pandemic and even longer.
16112,The patients just don’t have the immune response.
16113,"It's in the range of the peak of a bad flu season, not of flu deaths averaged out over a year."
16114,But the collapse in case numbers (down over 50% since mid April) forecasts a continued decline in death numbers.
16115,"Looking at where case numbers are now, and what that means for deaths a few weeks from now (when people who catch it now might die), we're down to a typical flu season level of risk."
16116,How do you propose we ensure the unvaccinated wear masks?
16117,If we care about cdc advice we shouldn’t just let ourselves break it.
16118,To be fair the Indian variant does seem to have some level of escape according to many reports.
16119,"It's not much more than the SA variant, but it does mean more vaccinated people in the UK are getting mild and moderate illness than they were with the vaccine even 3 months ago."
16120,and im proud to be one of them!
16121,I fly a dozen times a year and I can't remember the last time a kid or baby bothered me.
16122,Wear some headphones.
16123,&gt;So basically a Prime Minister.
16124,Sort of.
16125,"They were already planning for the President to have a fixed four- or six-year term, instead of how Prime Ministers can get turned out of office whenever Parliament votes no confidence."
16126,"But then, the vote of no confidence wasn't really a thing yet in 1788 - the very first vote of no confidence happened in Great Britain right after the Battle of Yorktown in 1782, and it wasn't till the mid-1800's that it became an established practice."
16127,"So, the President really would've been more like a 1700's-era British Prime Minister."
16128,Texas and Florida have done a reasonable job in getting people vaccinated at least.
16129,They had Covaxin.

16152,President Biden flat out said it.
16153,The advice of CDC game is at vaccinated people do not need to wear masks and unvaccinated people need to continue wearing masks.
16154,Those are the exact policies that should be implemented to follow the CDC's guidelines.
16155,You tried to argue this crap with me yesterday too.
16156,"The CDC said 2 things, just because you don't want to hear 1 of them doesn't mean that the CDC didn't say it."
16157,"You are lying by omission by acting like the CDC only said ""unvaccinated people need to continue wearing masks""."
16158,I think you are wrong downvote me I have RA and got the vaccine you should get the vaccine I would rather be safe than sorry there is no reason to get vaccine none and your doctor is wrong.

16237,I'd love to have a remote job but hard to find in IT.
16238,"Canadians are weird, but not dumb."
16239,Until there are enough people vaccinated for herd immunity.
16240,I feel like this has been said a million times.
16241,CDC says at least 70% vaccination rate for herd immunity.
16242,jfc...what is wrong with you people.
16243,Do you know how unlikely it is that you’d catch Covid after being vaccinated?
16244,"And that even if you did, the symptoms are significantly less severe?"
16245,Perks of living in a college town.
16246,There are about 10 of the same kids I see from a distance once a week here.
16247,"Other than that, hardly ever see anyone under 17."
16248,That doesn't mean much in the way of making laws.
16249,The CDC just okayed not wearing masks if you're vaccinated.
16250,This was always the plan.
16251,The US has placed the ball in the court of people who don’t believe in vaccines now.
16252,Vaccinated people are largely protected from death so the economy can reopen.
16253,There’s very little chance that all 50% of the remaining population will get covid.
16254,Probably like 50% of that 50% until we reach herd immunity.
16255,"So like, max, .5% of the population would die from covid in the next year assuming most of the unvaccinated people got it and the vaccine held strong against death."
16256,Is the pandemic over?
16257,Yes or no answers only!🤪
16258,Same here - being able to take the mask off (I’m fully vaccinated) has done my respiratory system a world of good.

16267,For how long
16268,He understands what behavioral experts have been saying for a long time that the pandemic will be socially over long before the point a health expert purely looking at the science would say it's over because the majority of us decide the risk is no longer high enough to build our lives around COVID restrictions
16269,Ya...that’s just a mental health issue at this point tbh

16327,I now know a coworker that I won't be associating with.
16328,Maybe we should've kept the masks.
16329,So these anti.mask liars don't get our kids sick.
16330,"Not MAY, WILL."
16331,No we wouldn't that's a fucking stupid argument.
16332,Children have not been vaccinated yet.
16333,"Once they are their risks will be drastically lower…

Riiighhhhtttt, and you’re a Mensa candidate aren’t ya?"
16334,Children are already at far lower risk of negative outcomes due to their immune systems being younger and better equipped to fight off any immunio-attack vector.
16335,That’s why why public health officials screamed open the schools and close the bars at the height of the pandemic?
16336,You’re a blithering idiot if you think “what about the children” is a cogent argument in an America where 48% of voters only give a fuck about “kids” until they exit the womb.
16337,Do you make the same argument against Marijuana legalization?

16367,"Then you head on home and step on your floors with your shoes, take them off and put them away or whatever, then you step in the same spot with your bare feet."

16369,That's what I'm wondering as well.
16370,"I'm sympathetic, but we can't pretend that ""COVID changed everything"" because it *didn't*."

16372,"During my trip in early 2020, I was sitting next to a mother holding her baby."
16373,"The baby was chewing on a toy or something and threw it on my lap twice, so I had to pick it up."
16374,"So a mask might not have necessarily saved me from this one, but it was also a pretty packed flight, and I was in the middle of a 3-seater."
16375,So the sickness that followed the flight could have come from several interactions on the flight.

16404,"Old mask, unwashed masks, inappropriate material, chin strap, etc...   Cheaters gonna cheat."
16405,I would guess that vaccine are already not wearing a mask in a way that would accomplish anything.
16406,"Most people are law abiding, though."
16407,"Well said

Also with almost half of the population vaccinated (with at least 1 dose) we may not reach herd immunity yet but the burden on the healthcare system will be much alleviated which was a big reason for the shutdown"
16408,Do you have a link for that data?

16418,"*checks front page and upvote ratio*

Most of the sub is fine with this."
16419,You shouldn't generalize using confirmation bias.
16420,It's roughly in the same ballpark as the Astrazeneca in terms of efficacy.
16421,"There's real world data from both Chile and Indonesia - against infection, 67% and 65% respectively; against hospitalization/severe cases, 85% and 96%."
16422,"The SinoVac vaccine seems to be less effective against the Brazilian variant (color me *very* skeptical of the '50.4%' efficacy number from Brazilian healthcare workers), so if that becomes the dominant strain worldwide, I imagine that there'd likely have to be a booster."
16423,"It's not as jaw droppingly effective as those badass mRNA vaccines in the West, but it's definitely a handy tool in the toolbox in the global fight against COVID."
16424,"Eh, we have 60% of adult population with at least one shot, and they estimate about 12-15% without vaccine that had covid, so 72-75% immunity for most at risk populations."
16425,The really risk populations (65+) are running estimate 85-90% with some level of immunity.
16426,That's basically herd immunity for populations of concern.
16427,Brazil and Italian village titer levels showed about 67% penetration into a community that wasn't taking precautions.
16428,"Been fully vaccinated for about a week now, and just saw my therapist for the first time in person, face to face without masks."
16429,"I neglected to ask until a little bit too late, but my therapist is unvaccinated."
16430,"I just want to confirm, there's really nothing I should be worried about, correct?"
16431,It’s about being angry and full of hatred.
16432,Surely all the non-vaccinated people will respect the rules and voluntarily refrain from entering the premises or continue wearing masks out of respect for the health and safety of others.
16433,Honor system.

16458,Because people aren't actually interpreting what the CDC is saying correctly.
16459,The CDC has flat out said VACCINATED people don't need masks.
16460,"If the policies being put in place by these states / businesses had a system in place that actively made sure that every single person who wasn't vaccinated wore a mask, then this would be following the science."
16461,Putting a policy in place that basically allows everyone to take their mask off is not following the science.

16464,"Most countries could afford doses, and most countries purchased enough for themselves."
16465,If the US didn't block exports they would have been able to import doses and inoculate people in a timely manner.
16466,"But no, you're correct."
16467,The part where the EU allowed for over 100 countries to have any vaccination plan by allowing exports of over 200m doses was horrific.
16468,The way over 200m elderly and health care professionals were able to receive a vaccine all over the world from as early as January.

16508,"No, the question is how long can you sustain and deepen the economic damage to livelihoods caused by lockdowns while waiting for Vax skeptics to get vaccinated."
16509,Would you wait 6 months?
16510,The new jobs report was much worse than expected.
16511,Also breaking news... water is wet!
16512,[removed]
16513,Same here in Alabama.
16514,No one in their masks up.
16515,"My employers is requiring vaccines, and just announced vaccinated employees don't need to wear masks anymore."
16516,Guess what?
16517,I'm not going to wear masks anymore.
16518,It's insane to need to mask in an environment where everyone is vaccinated.
16519,The risk is about 4 digits to the right of the decimal.
16520,[removed]
16521,"&gt;Face coverings will continue to be strongly recommended for guests and team members who are not fully vaccinated

Apparently not!"
16522,"The problem is that the CDC said ""VACCINATED people don't need masks"" and all of these places are basically saying ""No masks!"""
16523,which is not what the CDC said.
16524,"If the CDC had said ""no masks so long as you all have a system in place to prove who is vaccinated"" then the messaging would be clearer and easier to understand."
16525,"Some back of napkin math: 

We've given 48% of Americans their first shot."
16526,The CDC estimates that about 34% of Americans have had covid.
16527,"So of the remaining 52% Americans who are unvaccinated, you can guess that about 17% of them have immunity through a prior covid infection, assuming equal distribution of infections."
16528,"That brings us to 65% of Americans with some amount of immunity to covid, which is riiiiiiiiiggggghhht at the herd immunity threshold"
16529,Do we have a list of countries yet?
16530,"""I'm vaccinated"""
16531,"Oh I'm sure they will comply, reasonable people that they are."
16532,Like that even fucking matters
16533,"Tell that to my young healthy friend who got kicked out of the airforce because it fucked him up so bad, no longer healthy enough to serve🇺🇸."
16534,They said that because there was a global mask shortage and they wanted to keep demand down to mask healthcare workers.
16535,"It was a sound decision on their part and you should stop misrepresenting their policies because you don’t like what the decided this time

Also they never said that it would hurt, just that it was unnecessary at the moment GIVEN THAT there are people who need it more"
16536,Yup.
16537,Is this true for the mRNA vaccines?
16538,That’s all we have where I live
16539,"Should offer espresso after, a shot for a shot"
16540,Yup.
16541,"I had to go fuck-far to get both my shots (not as bad as it sounds to some, still, sheeeit) and I got my second on the 7th."
16542,I'm sort of high risk and it was not just a matter of strolling down the street.
16543,"So yeah, June 15."
16544,I just hope it happens.
16545,That's only a month out and there's a lot of pent-up demand for normal amongst those of us who've put our lives on hold this last year plus.
16546,"Still being patient and will do the right thing, erring on the side of caution cuz not &amp; having shit go sideways means even more waiting."
16547,nah

16549,"Same with Wal-Mart

A lot of them haven't taken down the big cloth banners yet but have indeed modified policy and the periodic COVID PSA on the intercom now specifically asks only unvaccinated shoppers to mask"
16550,I made $11/hr.
16551,With covid they gave everyone a $0.50 raise and said no more raises until 2023.
16552,For ANYONE.
16553,The mcdonalds across the street is hiring STARTING at $16/hr.

16566,Look at their comment.
16567,They are scared of taking their kid to the store because of the CDC says ok for vaccinated people not to wear a mask.
16568,They are the ones who are scared.
16569,Not the OP but replying in case he doesn’t see.
16570,It was assessed and they found no significant signal.
16571,The challenge as you may imagine is sifting out signal from background events; I think they found a statistically significant increase in appendicitis but judged that this was random (make a lot of comparisons and one of them will be p below 0.05).
16572,"For J and J a CVST was observed and this led to a safety pause, making national headlines."
16573,The fact that it was a CVST was not disclosed until FDA submission.
16574,Only one event in the vaccine arm.
16575,A lot of ppl have PTSD from this past year.
16576,It's gonna take time to heal the mental toll.
16577,That's just a ridiculous statement.
16578,What about the anti-vaxx towns and counties in Oregon?
16579,what an effective use of money.......
16580,"Nothing in health is 100, so if you want to keep living your life, eventually you'll be rolling the dice on all sorts of diseases."
16581,"The vaccines give us great protection, including from serious illness, and at that point we need to stop treading SARS-CoV-2 like the boogeyman and treat it like anything else that might make us ill."
16582,"Even in years where influenza was widespread because of poor vaccines, most people probably didn't change their day to day at all."
16583,"Now that SARS-CoV-2 is less dangerous than influenza, we need to accept that it's safe to act that way, at least within smaller groups of completely vaccinated people."
16584,Science communication is seriously undervalued.
16585,"Which makes sense, I guess, because communications as a science tends to be undervalued as well."
16586,There's an update at the bottom that Meijer lifted compulsory masking for vaccinated shoppers today
16587,News just said only California &amp; New Jersey still have mask mandates.
16588,Nobody has ever given me more than an odd passing glance.
16589,I'm in a small town and one of the few that wears them.
16590,I greet others kindly and go about my day.
16591,Why would I care so much about someone else's individual choices to bother interrupting my day over it?
16592,Let alone give someone who does that my time?
16593,My pediatrician said my kids have literally nothing to worry about with respect to COVID.
16594,"No asthma, they aren’t over weight, and no underlying conditions."
16595,Where in CA are you that there 'hasn't been enough time to get two shots'?
16596,"In the Bay Area (at least, santa clara county) there's been more than enough availability for anyone who wants it..."
16597,"I was in the lowest risk group and got my shots the day I became eligible, as did everyone else I know... some even sooner."
16598,"The Walmart around us did, they used to have someone standing outside and if you didn’t have a mask, you were not allowed in."
16599,Yeah I’m sure the US pharmaceutical companies would totally allow that 🙄🙄🙄

16601,"Don’t forgot, people who have recovered from Covid (27M+) are part of that equation as well."
16602,"There’s bound to be some overlap, but it boosts that number."
16603,This comment made me realize that I appreciate large font.
16604,Must be getting old.
16605,I know I haven't heard anything about Menards (basically mid-western Home Depot) officially dropping or modifying theirs yet
16606,I'm sure we will see an upshot of them getting the vaccine when fall approaches and they need to get it as a requirement for their college.
16607,Well it's been six weeks!
16608,Seems like US cases continue to drop.
16609,"Unfortunately, we'll have to accept that eventually, to open back up some people will be dishonest, but that the benefits of rewarding the compliant will outweigh the costs of the disease spread amongst those who are truly anti-vaxxers, because without compulsion we have no other option except to forge ahead."
16610,They had the least time.
16611,And many of us waited so our does would be scheduled after final exams and during the summer due to the possibility of side effects.
16612,What article did I get 70 from?
16613,Still bullshit that they can’t be done June 21
16614,Oh and by the way.
16615,No context and nuance needed to be removed.
16616,The CDC in March of 2020 said only N95 masks were effective against covid-19 so there is no reason to wear a mask unless you are a medical professional.
16617,Fauci wrote a paper describing the reason so many people died during the Spanish flu outbreak is because they were dying from bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks.
16618,"I figured the same thing but yesterday when I went every person I saw was masked and masked correctly, even the employees."
16619,Can't upvote this enough.

16629,You'll be ok son
16630,Wish Facebook would just remove itself.
16631,Uhh remember when DeSantis put a whistleblower in jail because she was trying to report accurate Covid numbers?
16632,And are you forgetting how fucking horrendously Trump handled the pandemic?
16633,Because it's not necessary.
16634,Putting a mask on a person who is already Vaccinated is not accomplishing anything.
16635,Imposing arbitrary restrictions not grounded in science is not good because it erodes public trust.
16636,"I mean, kids don’t really have a choice in many things."
16637,"If kids could choose, many would choose to not go to school at all."
16638,Uninsured can negotiate it down to $1500 ish pretty easily.
16639,But it’s still way too expensive for no reason whatsoever.
16640,"It's low considering the efficacy of the vaccine, which is around 40-50%."
16641,"If you actually wanted to get ""50% of population immunized"", you would need to vaccinate 100%."
16642,This is how hard it is.
16643,What does it matter.
16644,He isn't the one delivering and interpreting the data.
16645,The CDC is.
16646,"If the virus in circulation is low, variants are less likely to arise."
16647,What idiots
16648,"I volunteered there yesterday, and lemme tell ya, Sunday was wild because a lot of people brought kids in for walk-in appointments."
16649,"It was kinda quiet the week before though since we have been slowing down, and we'll be offering out last first dose appointments on 5/27."
16650,Crazy to see it finally wind down.
16651,"Yes, we actually do know what will really happen."
16652,Just like we knew when we enforced masks what would really happen if we didn't.
16653,Either trust the science or don't.
16654,Once you start questioning the science then what makes you different than someone else questioning the science on the other side?
16655,"And don't say ""I'm protecting others!"""
16656,because those on the other side don't believe that for a minute.
16657,My napkin math tells me that around 20% of the US population may have recovered from COVID but not been vaccinated- and maybe a lot more.
16658,So add that to the 47% who have at least one dose and we might be over 70% of the total pop with some immunity already.
16659,Last call is a catch-all.
16660,"Not just against drunk driving, but noise complaints (which absolutely stem from responsible people as well as irresponsible people), disorderly conduct, and crimes against innocent people who just happen to be drunk."
16661,It’d also probably happen at some point at the onus of the business anyways.
16662,"Unless you’re in a touristy area, people eventually go home, and your business peters out around 2-3 anyways."
16663,"As an additional point, some states do it as a matter of revenue."
16664,"In my state, it’s a hard time unless your business buys the liquor license that extends it."
16665,And it’s religiously influenced as well - some locales have different last call laws regarding saturday nights and sundays that were implemented to increase church attendance.
16666,[removed]
16667,What’s clear to me is you seem unable to rate covid alongside other everyday risks.
16668,You have issues with statistics and think emotionally
16669,lol they’re 11.
16670,I think they’ve signed up for social media before and know how to lie about their age.
16671,"I’m 15 and they asked for DL so I had to wait :(

Got my first dose Thursday."
16672,People are acting like it's suddenly illegal to wear masks.
16673,You can keep wearing them forever if you want.
16674,The CDC does not make laws.
16675,Nice.
16676,Gonna avoid both even more than before
16677,nice
16678,Do you think they’ll give you trouble if you got your first moderna dose May 1st and sign up for a second one May 28th?
16679,(I think that’s technically only 27 days - they never gave me a second date on my first dose date bc of Memorial Day weekend)
16680,"Not everybody can get vaccinated yet, or ever, or has had a chance to get fully vaccinated."
16681,Why is the (extremely mild) inconvenience of a mask indoors for another 3-5 months so horrible?
16682,Serious question...
16683,Does that mean it is better for them to catch it now?
16684,God gives people sense and understanding and compassion toward others.
16685,This can translate to a desire to behave in ways that protects oneself and others.
16686,I see that as God's protection.
16687,Many in millions you mentioned operated outside of the truth and outside of care and compassion toward others.
16688,"Yes, many did the ""right"" thing and still got infected, but most simply wanted to shout YOLO (or whatever equivalent) and expose themselves and their loved ones by denying the reality of the pandemic and the need for infection control measures."
16689,"&gt;the CDC just gave a bunch of anti-vaxxers the ability to easily go out without masks

Anti-vaxxers have been out without masks the whole time anyway."
16690,"Last summer my entire state was flooded with tourists that drove down from all over the country completely filling all the bars, restaurants and beaches."
16691,Masks were never even enforced in my state.
16692,When this all started the sheriff's said publicly on the news that they would refuse to enforce any mask guidelines.
16693,In NYC they don't give a shit either.
16694,"Most people are doing it just because, but if you walked in with no mask nobody would ever say shit to you."
16695,"Its a ""place where they get snow"" thing, I think."
16696,We usually wear them during the fall and winter months.
16697,They're warm and come in tons of colors so you can match it with shoes or different colored pants.
16698,They're great tbh
16699,BJP IT Cell worker spotted
16700,I think we'll be fine till winter then we'll it might change but only time will tell
16701,Unless you ask them you don’t know their reasoning as to why they want to keep their mask on.
16702,Could they be paranoid?
16703,Sure.
16704,Could they be trying to avoid allergy season bc they discovered how useful masks are for keeping an asthma related allergy trigger?
16705,Sure.
16706,Shit maybe they just wanna hide that nasty pimple idk and unless you ask you don’t know either.
16707,If someone chooses to wear a mask I don’t assume political motivation i assume they have their own reason and leave it at that.
16708,[deleted]
16709,"Nope, they don’t get to wear a mask."
16710,"Everyone wore a mask for your safety, now take off yours for our safety."
16711,"Between people acting immaturely because their identity is hidden, and people who are protected from law enforcement because of it, they’re too much."
16712,Sorry you get a little tummy bug ever few years.
16713,Yup.

16718,I am talking about the people who are judging others who are not wearing masks.

16720,You need to substantiate this claim with some actual science or else you're knowingly peddling false information.
16721,"Doing good now, bud?"
16722,I think it only has to do with how trashy the people are in the local area.
16723,"There was massive economic and political(believe it or not, the CCP’s power isn’t absolute) costs for that."
16724,They won all those brownie points back with the premise something like that will never need to happen again and the massive head start they had to produce PPE and other supplies for the world.
16725,CCP can’t afford to do it again.
16726,Vaccines are needed
16727,How would you even know if someone is vaccinated?!
16728,Couldn't I just walk into target and lie and say I'm vaccinated if I wanted to?
16729,"(not vaccinated yet bc of anti-vax parents and not 18 yet, soon tho)"
16730,After the 2nd shot I was wiped out for 24 hours and then kind of low energy for an additional 12 hours after that.
16731,"If you had no side effects after the second dose, be grateful haha"
16732,Same got sick often when traveling back and fourth from working on mass transit prior to the pandemic.
16733,Other crowded areas especially indoors I might still wear them.
16734,Outdoors I won’t unless it’s crowded area.
16735,I’m vaccinated but I still think it’s best to wear a mask to reduce catching other viruses not just covid.
16736,I haven't seen too many antivax comments here.
16737,"Just more of the ""I'm vaxxed and bulletproof, pandemic is over for me"""

16749,"It will only make him feel like he is being spied on by his superior, and that's not good for your working relation with him."
16750,Isn’t that what you just said tho?
16751,Social pressure people into giving up their masks is this not a type of shaming??
16752,I don’t care nor do i attach politics to people who choose or choose not to wear masks at this point.
16753,I assume if someone has a mask on then they have a reason unique to them and leave it at that simple.
16754,Some people will never go back.
16755,There will be some kind of post-covid hypochondria diagnosis.
16756,Pandemic means world wide.
16757,Some wealthy countries may get the virus to a manageable level but much of the world will struggle for years.
16758,And no mention that the variants ARE hitting the kids harder than previously in Brazil and India.
16759,"But the 20 somethings on Reddit will continue to gaslight concerned parents because KiDs ArE lOw RiSk as to not be inconvenienced to do something even lower risk, that is to wear a mask when in public indoor spaces."
16760,"So weird- the experience of living in the suburbs on NYC made my experience so different from the rest of
the country."
16761,The thought of going to any store unmasked is bizarre- I think people are a little over the top with masking up outside on a hike (when it’s easy to stay 6 feet apart) but it took me a long time to realize that there were states where people just don’t wear masks in the grocery store.
16762,I don’t know.
16763,If the government came out and said don’t get the vaccine I’m convinced there are people who would then go and get it.
16764,I had Moderna and arm soreness lasted less time and hurt less the 2nd shot but I had way more side effects with it
16765,Just stop.
16766,Driving twice to/from another state is statistically more dangerous for a teenager than contracting COVID.
16767,835 hospitalizations/132deaths.

16769,Less than 0.01%.
16770,"Also this is generalized information, not just J&amp;J, which is what we were discussing in context."
16771,You are technically correct but I'm not sure what you're goal is here other than to be right.
16772,The vaccines are 99.999993% against hospitalization and death.
16773,"I live in Texas, outskirts of San Antonio, for almost a year I hadn't seen a single person indoors without a mask."
16774,Once the gov rescinded the mask order in March I would maybe seen one or two every 2nd or 3rd trip to HEB.
16775,"After the CDC said vaxxed peeps could ditch the mask, it was an almost immediate half and half."
16776,"To catch you up on a year of science, kids are rarely impacted from the virus."

16785,Unfortunately this will not be cheap or easy due and will likely require extensive governmental aide or new employee safety regulations that actually have teeth.
16786,As the U.S. grapples with supply shortage in the construction industry and an already massive shortage of HVAC contractors -- one has to wonder how many decades this will take to be implemented with any scale.

16944,This is completely twisting what people are saying here.

17118,kroger never was requiring masks.
17119,they'd ask but thats it.
17120,"now they have a sign that says please wear a mask while shopping, along with some masks."
17121,I honestly feel like *more* people at kroger are wearing masks now than before.
17122,which really tells you something about how fucking childish these people really are.
17123,"it was about someone ""bossing"" them."
17124,"they were literally willing to die on that hill, along with killing others."

17134,My first Pfizer shot left my arm sore for a few days after and I had a nasty bruise for like two weeks.
17135,But the second shot my arm was sore the next day but nothing after that and so far no bruise.
17136,"Tomorrow, it will have been 14 days since my second vaccine."
17137,"Is there anything (other than stuff that's illegal), that I still shouldn't do because of the pandemic?"

17140,"My sisters got their second doses at a different location than their first, because the mass vaccination site is operating at reduced hours now and didn't work for them."

17152,"By the time I went back for my 2nd dose, there were tons of people walking around mask-less."
17153,What a bizarre change of pace.
17154,"This chart on the right contains the number of active cases detected weekly by PCR and Antigen: [https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html)

Weekly the highest number is 300 cases."
17155,Compare that to the number of covid cases weekly in your area.
17156,In mine we are at about 1000 a week right now and we are at least 50% vaccinated.
17157,I'm still waiting for my eyes to be feast-ed.
17158,I don’t think it’s sociopathic.
17159,"I won’t hang out with antivaxxers, especially during a measles outbreak, why would I make an exception for covid?"
17160,I don’t hang out with openly racist or cultily religious people either.
17161,"“On the fence” is almost never “I have a legitimate reason to believe the vaccine will cause more damage to me than covid because of my rare health issue/previous immune reaction to vaccines.”  “On the fence” is “I believe that my (usually entirely unfounded and false) concerns about a shockingly effective safe vaccine are more important than the chance I will catch coronavirus and spread it, potentially killing/severely damaging myself and others in the process."
17162,Tons of people are getting vaccinated around me anyway so I’ll let them take the risk I’m worried about to make me safer.
17163,"I don’t need a vaccine since they’re doing it.”

Exaggeration, right?"
17164,"No, that’s a summary of what a coworker said while chatting on the phone."

17167,I hate people too much 🤣
17168,What about the store workers?
17169,And others who cannot be vaccinated yet?
17170,I feel like it puts others at risk.
17171,I will keep my mask on.
17172,I am a vaccinated adult and even I don’t want to go back to work with unvaccinated folks.
17173,Vaccine should be made a requirement unless you have some disease/allergy that doesn’t allow you to get it.
17174,I’m going to give this a week or two and see what happens with the infection rate.
17175,If what I was told was true the vaccine just keeps you out of the hospital.
17176,Not sure if I want to risk giving my grandma or mom covid
17177,So be honest with yourself.
17178,You feel superior.
17179,You are superior.
17180,"Yeah, and if they got their way, you'd be wearing a mask through fall."
17181,So it helps to ensure there's vocal pushback against this crowd.
17182,Most likely lol
17183,Thanks for all the effort you put in to this.
17184,I look for your post every day to see how we are doing.
17185,"The sick people are the ones who need to wear them, anyway."
17186,"At least with the flu, the pre-symptomatic contagious period is really short, so there's less of a need for everyone to act as though we're all infected all the time."
17187,That's been the problem with COVID all along.
17188,You can be sick and not know it.
17189,That's precisely how the virus spreads.
17190,"Even pre-vaccine, if I was not sick, I didn't really need a mask."
17191,The problem was that it was *always* impossible to prove I wasn't sick.
17192,"With ordinary flu and colds, it's easier."
17193,"&gt; My guess is that they think that it will convince more people to get vaccinated

Not judging your guess, but if that's what they are thinking it's a terrible assumption."
17194,I personally think all this is absolutely premature and will continue wearing a mask.

17197,*YES*.
17198,The idea that masks are “just a piece of cloth” is ludicrous and insulting to me.
17199,"They’ve caused me unspeakable amounts of depression, anxiety, and TMJ over the past year, and the fact they’re very quickly going away makes me want to cry with relief."
17200,"(If and when the university I work at announces a maskless fall semester, I probably will cry — I feel like I’ve been holding my breath for fourteen months.)"
17201,And I got my vaccine a whopping *two days* after my phase became eligible.
17202,"Yeah, but do you apply that kind of risk assessment across your life generally?"
17203,I find it hard to believe.
17204,I don't care what other people do and frankly I don't care what other people think I'm doing.
17205,I'm just waiting for the mandate in my county to drop so I don't need to wear it in the gym

17257,"Even if only 1 in 10 breakthrough cases are reported to the CDC, efficacy would still be 99.9 percent."
17258,"Bottom line, your chances of getting Covid after getting fully vaccinated are minuscule."
17259,"I haven't gotten so much as a mild cold for the past year, like many people are saying."

17268,That's true here in NZ too.
17269,We go months without any community cases.
17270,But we are still urged to have a test if we have any cold or flu symptoms at all.
17271,We are told it is vital to have several thousand tests being performed every day around the country to be sure.
17272,The same is true in Australia.
17273,"That's because the ""open up"" crowd doesn't want to hear it."
17274,"Prior to COVID-19, did you ever wear a mask (ie, outside of an inpatient facility)?"
17275,Why or why not?
17276,"Not just WILL, but HAVE, in places like LA, and all across the nation as ""fear"" (legitimate) of going to the hospital is directly responsible for an otherwise preventable death."
17277,"This is why ""excess deaths"" is going to be so important to understand the full impact of the pandemic, not just those directly attributable to the disease as in the viral load exceeded some detection threshold."
17278,"e.g., including suicides too."
17279,"I should mention that I respect the Amish: if you choose to live life without electricity, like alarm clocks, and even without medicine, I don't have to agree but I can respect the personal choice, so long as it isn't forced upon anyone else (unlike the Unibomber who had similar ideals, but took the aspect of choice away from people)."
17280,"(Full disclosure, I've heard that even many Amish actually make an exception and go ahead and accept many medicines and even vaccines - though that's somewhat beside the point)."
17281,"What gets me is the two-faced nature of someone who makes one decision - like to turn their back on what modern medicine offers - but then when things get so bad that it's all of a sudden obvious to them to the point where they can't just comfortably ignore it anymore, then they all of a sudden change their minds."
17282,"Then too people who understand psychology and KNOW that that is what is going to happen, just...let it."
17283,Though what else are they supposed to do?
17284,Give people the vaccine by force?
17285,"Tell them to stop coming to hospitals, if they didn't first make an effort by taking the vaccine?"
17286,"It's *almost* like we are all in this together, like it or not, and one person's actions affects another person's outcome."
17287,"I am no longer ""free"" to do as I please, bc there are so many nutjobs running around taking my own choices away from me."
17288,"Like kids who go to school and get shot there - in the ""land of the free"", they are remarkably not free to not die (and worse, suffer horribly prior to that - even the survivors are utterly changed for life)."
17289,"I feel for your situation about your family, but more than that, it's not just a one-off situation, but instead is playing out across the entire nation."
17290,"Nurses can't afford to stay home, bc their pay is so low, and rent prices across the country have gone up so much, outstripping wages."
17291,"It's merely one more example of how the disappearing middle class is going to turn around and affect us ALL, regardless of our own personal incomes (well, okay, if you can own an entire hospital wing then you might be less affected than most) - e.g., how so many mothers can't afford daycare and have to stay home to watch their kids doing school at home, that there is a rash of businesses across the country (Chipotle, McDonald's, etc.)"
17292,that can't get enough workers to even stay open (though part of that is a choice: e.g.
17293,"Chipotle somehow manages to keep their online app ordering going, where you pay more money for less food, and it requires the same if not a greater number of workers, like delivery drivers - so it's primarily people who pay more that remain unaffected, and once again those who can least afford it who bear the brunt of the disruption)."
17294,I'm saying: we are all vulnerable.
17295,"Our nation's systems were not ""robust"", and instead were just waiting for any slight stress to throw things into major chaos."
17296,"It's like owning a car that is 30 years old and has never once been taken to be checked out by a mechanic: you might not want to *depend* on it to get you to your job, or any important event (your own wedding?"
17297,imagine standing someone up at the alter bc your car wouldn't start!).
17298,"Or a real life example: more than half the gas stations in North Carolina are completely out of fuel, not because of the pipeline hack - directly - but bc of panic buying."
17299,"We NEED to WAKE UP, and realize the systemic problems around us."
17300,Like any zombie movie ever.
17301,And also like those movies: we aren't all going to make it.

17303,"Like someone who got bit saying ""it's nothing - I'm fine"", and then proceeds to kill everyone around them when it turns out that they are not, in fact, fine after all."

17305,"Someone tweeting ""hey this virus is like the flu - give it to me on purpose and I'll show you"", then their next tweet is from their deathbed."
17306,"Which, you know some people are crazy - a couple people in Kansas literally drank bleach when told to by the man on TV - but when it happens SO OFTEN, affecting SO MANY people, and they turn around and kill off or at least endanger their entire family - it becomes not just a one time thing, but an actual PATTERN."
17307,"I don't have much faith in democracy these days, bc people are so stupid, and therefore the worst bosses imaginable."
17308,"It also doesn't help that just about every student I've ever talked to from universities in rural states, are there for the expressly stated intention of leaving that state."
17309,"I've argued back - traffic is less, and with computers you can work anywhere, etc... - but this kind of brain drain effect has been going on for DECADES, and is leaving rural areas quite ah...""vulnerable"" to deception, when anyone who knows anything is run out of town, sometimes literally."
17310,"And sometimes with outright death threats, like the story of the man who started a medical college in Missouri, bringing in grants even to fund it, but then people didn't like his talking to the community that you should wear masks, so his daughter said that their whole family was going to leave - even though they STARTED the college, and it was SUCCESSFUL, and bringing in MONEY to the area."
17311,"And there are SO MANY stories like that - another was a mayor or such in iirc Dodge in Kansas (some famous cowboy town anyway), who actually stepped down bc she was receiving death threats for similarly saying that people should wear masks."
17312,And that's not even getting into worse things like the governor that was nearly kidnapped.

17409,I hadn't been aware of how [common that was](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/92113) until now.
17410,"I'm glad you are alive, lad."
17411,No way he keeps it longer than California
17412,"“Those of us who’ve put our lives on hold”

So, pretty much everyone."
17413,You’re not a lone soldier here.
17414,"We all appreciate your efforts, sure, but if you think you’re part of some small group here you’ve missed a lot of news."
17415,[removed]
17416,"Yes, at this rate."
17417,But of course as you pointed out we won't get there (at least not by July 4th; we may get there eventually).
17418,I've said since it was announced that I was shocked that Biden set the 70% by 7/4 goal because it was never (in my opinion) realistic.
17419,The only way it would be realistic is if the Federal government held states with their feet to the fire (via restricted Medicaid / etc funding) to force states to aggressively push vaccination access or used FEMA and other government agencies to do mass-access and door-to-door vaccine campaigns.
17420,"On April 15th, the projection for 70%+ of adults was for yesterday (May 16th)."
17421,By the end of this week I expect we'll have slipped past 7/4.
17422,"Always the one's that spam ""fOlLoW tHe ScIeNcE"" along with ""i GoT mY vAxX, sO sCrEw EvErYbOdY eLsE"" that seem to downvote any rational thought on this board"
17423,Oh boy.
17424,I really thought it was obvious satire and pretty funny.
17425,It’s hard to relax when you live somewhere where the fully vaxxed rate is under 40% and not likely to change soon.
17426,check out videos of people harassing those who wear masks
17427,You don’t know more than the CDC
17428,How does covid cause blood clots?
17429,"And now that you've had fun looking for something to justify your argument, what is it now?"
17430,:)
17431,I had to go because I broke a tooth right in the middle of the pandemic.
17432,I waited about 4 months first and I did some research.
17433,I would only accept an appointment as the first patient on a Monday morning as my dentist is closed Friday through Sunday.
17434,It took two months but I got the spot.
17435,I was first in to the hygienist and then to the dentist.
17436,I figured this was the best way to avoid things being aerosolized in there prior to my coming and it's a very small office as many of them are.
17437,:D
17438,Perhaps the parents of one of your friends would be willing to take you?
17439,"There was folks at a Wal Mart I serviced in the Belmont-Craigin neighborhood in Chicago, and 3 out of 4 people straight up did not wear masks."
17440,"Fucking pissed me off, I hated going there."
17441,Congratulations on making it.
17442,Feels good to be here now.
17443,We just felt bad for winning it so much over the years that we decided to donate our best players to the needy down south.
17444,Our way of saying sorry :)
17445,Urban areas should all have 60% vaccination by then with some reaching 70-80%
17446,"I see, thanks for the resources."
17447,Great!
17448,"Looking forward to being able to shop without a mask, it’ll feel weird at first I’m sure!"

17450,"No but the conditions for it to spread are better in the colder months when more people are indoors, plus with seasonal flu it's less resources for covid patients"
17451,"&gt; As an OGP employee

What does that mean?"
17452,What is OGP?
17453,"Thanks, I'll look into it!"
17454,So true.
17455,Obviously the USA has done a crap job with containment but it feels great is because we don’t have to pretend Covid is going to be eradicated.
17456,Low levels are fine
17457,"I did specifically mean physically within China, the CCP might cover something up rather than let news get out."
17458,Ditto.
17459,Allergic to the outdoors and I couldn’t really breathe with the masks.
17460,Allergy pills take the edge off but just a bit.
17461,That’s when you reply “actually I got vaccinated”.

17470,Vaccine passports are a violation of the constitution and the freedom of movement/assembly.
17471,Definitely not the case in Oregon.
17472,"I waited one week after eligibility but it's still a few more weeks before my 2nd, then two more before I reach full immunity."
17473,Hang in there.
17474,"It will suck for people who work in the stores having to deal with amplified Karens =(
I feel like this doesn't change all that much for those who are vaccinated."
17475,People who take this pandemic serious are well-aware of the anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers.
17476,I think we will continue to wear masks because we don't want to be associated with the crazies.
17477,I have seen quite a few redditors who expressed the same sentiment
17478,Is it unethical though if anti-vaxxers will keep being anti-vaxxers and never get vaccinated?
17479,And anti-maskers have been doing everything they can to defy mask wearing throughout the pandemic.
17480,Not sure what exactly CDC announcement changes for this group that puts their lives in danger.
17481,They're doing that themselves based on their own continued behavior.
17482,CDC announcement hopefully pushes some of the fence sitters to get moving and get vaccinated.
17483,But the true anti-vaxxer/masker crowd has been unsafe this whole time and that isn't changing.
17484,Two weeks from now we'll have a huge spike of covid cases.
17485,For customers?
17486,"If target started doing that, I would stop going to Target."
17487,But why
17488,Lmao same
17489,Thank goodness.

17494,Counterpoint: household spread was a huge way Covid has been spreading... People in their own houses don't wear masks.
17495,Doubt there are many studies that have teased out exactly where vaccinated people have gotten it specifically.
17496,Then those people can continue masking and avoiding crowds until a later date.
17497,"The vast, vast majority of people have access and capability to get the vaccine."
17498,Life doesn't stop for a small fringe group.
17499,Wow.
17500,I live near DC and virtually everyone had a mask inside stores all the time.
17501,"Ok, and if I get the low-grade version, let's say it's so low-grade I don't even get symptoms, and then I unknowingly pass it to the kids I work with who are too young to get the vaccine?"
17502,"Or to my roommate who is vaccinated, but on immunosuppressant drugs so the vaccine may not be as effective for her?"
17503,"Or maybe this ""low-grade"" version is still dangerous to me because I'm overweight and have diabetes and an inflammatory auto-immune disease?"
17504,"I mean, I also tend to get overheated easily, and I would LOVE to not wear masks anymore as summer is starting to heat up, but I won't feel safe doing that since my state is still under 30% fully vaccinated, and now there's going to be all these potentially infected and contagious people walking around with no masks because they can just lie and pretend they're vaccinated."
17505,Not yet - I’m not eligible in my country for the vaccine yet.
17506,"Treatment plan is only salt, water, beta blockers..."
17507,Especially since everything else is ending on the 15th anyway...it just makes sense to lump this in with it.
17508,Cdc is garbage now.
17509,They have been manipulated to say what they said.
17510,Economy is now first in America again
17511,It does matter.
17512,CDC’s most important advice with this new statement is that the unvaccinated still need to be masked.
17513,And what if down the road there's a terrible side-effect linked to the vaccines?
17514,There's already been young people who've gotten blood clots from the vaccines when they likely would have been a-OK from COVID.
17515,Some people just like to have something to stress about for some reason.
17516,It’s like therapeutic for them to be constantly fearing death
17517,"Even though we found that covid rarely spreads through surfaces, I'm really happy with the improvements of hygiene and disinfecting."
17518,"I'm usually good for two nasty colds a year, but I haven't had one since the fall of 2019."
17519,"This is highly, highly dependent on the practice/hospital/organization they work in."
17520,Doctors in the US are kept overly busy with patient visit time and charting.
17521,Most MD/DO programs have little if any emphasis on public health training or how to review medical research.
17522,"Some organizations consider research literacy to be part of the job, but that isn’t something I would call terribly common."
17523,"Many physicians do follow the guidance from professional associations (in this case, American Academy of Pediatrics is the big one) but it’s not like those recommendations are a trade secret only available to physicians."
17524,Often AAP and other big groups reference each other (so the tldr will be “yeah what CDC said”).
17525,These big groups are also walking the same tightrope of cautious public messaging as CDC.
17526,"So all of that to say... your doctor can be expected to be an expert in lots of things adjacent to public health, but typically it isn’t their job to be an expert in the most cutting edge research."
17527,Whether they choose to stay current will depend entirely on the individual and to what degree their place of work encourages and supports this.
17528,"I mean, I don't like garbage studies, but you said ""mandate to protect religious and constitutional freedoms"" like it was a bad thing."
17529,The point of asking would be to see the vax cards.
17530,"And I’m vaccinated, however it’s still not 100% effective."
17531,So I’m continuing to wear a mask for the time being.
17532,I just hope this is all over by the time I get married at the end of the year
17533,"Seeing as the death statistics you're sourcing was misleading, that statement probably is too."
17534,It's also entirely irrelevant.
17535,We're talking about coronavirus vaccines here and the risk/benefit of vaccination for that disease.
17536,They were fine before.
17537,They’ll be fine now
17538,What are your credentials and relevant experience?
17539,"No, I'm hearing that vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask."
17540,I'm vaccinated so...
17541,"Dude the garbage titles.....they are adopting the CDC latest guidelines.....when people actually meet them....  
We don't meet them yet....in new york only about 50% of new yorkers have just ONE dose...we're not even close to a majority of people having BOTH AND having been 2 weeks after the second shot."
17542,These sensationalist headlines are making it sound like we already have like 70% of people with both doses and 2 weeks have passed and they still don't lift it.
17543,That is not the case.
17544,"chill out, the past few months have been nothing but negative hate."
17545,How about some positive news?
17546,"&gt;Meanwhile, British Columbia cited a supply shortage in announcing Wednesday that it would stop using AstraZeneca as a first dose."
17547,Saskatchewan has also said it has stopped use of AstraZeneca because of a lack of supply.
17548,"How surprising, AstraZeneca can't fulfill orders."
17549,Good
17550,What happens when the unvaccinated people make a mutated covid and we all start this back up because people are impatient and weak to just hold up for correct percentage to it?
17551,Enjoy yourself lol that's Americans for you.
17552,Trust the science.
17553,That’s what you all have been saying until suddenly the CDC does something you don’t like
17554,"Also, the latest [Angus Reid poll](https://angusreid.org/canada-astrazeneca-herd-immunity/) shows that 82% of Canadian adults have already received their first dose or intend to get it as soon as they possibly can."
17555,"Only 9% say they don't want it, and that's been decreasing."
17556,You seem to be under the impression that the vaccines we have available aren’t effective when evidence shows that’s not even close to the case.
17557,"Case rates are dropping in the US, and are very low in the UK and extremely low in Israel, mainly due to vaccines."
17558,Why do you think it’s nearly impossible for humans to develop an effective vaccine in a hasty manner?
17559,Science has only advanced as the years have gone by.
17560,And idk why you are comparing AIDS to Covid in terms of “changing how we live.” Practice safe sex or abstinence and you will never get AIDS.
17561,Not exactly a major lifestyle change for a lot of people.
17562,What’s the mortality rate for children?
17563,I am positively certain that this will change this summer and basically all colleges will reconsider their decision to not reopen in fall.
17564,No the other guy so right.
17565,"You're employer does not need to say ""I'm firing you for being black"" to successfully win a lawsuit for discrimination."
17566,Specifically you can still use circumstantial or statistical evidence.
17567,"While the standard for circumstantial evidence are high, they are not impossible."
17568,"For example, in Griggs vs Duke Power the employees successfully won a suit because a certain test discriminated against black employees from promoting but there was no correlation between passing the test and being a good manager."
17569,"https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/t6manual6

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co."
17570,"And to your point if the reason is ""work culture"" and the reason you don't fit is ""you're too old"" that counts as age discrimination."
17571,What particular concern do you have about the vaccine (and list the particular vaccine) and I’ll respond with the requested information
17572,It'll probably happen Wednesday night or Thursday latest
17573,The word you’re looking for is “altruistic”.
17574,It’s certainly generous.
17575,But there is justification for speaking about children as though they are still people.
17576,"A child is a person and is ""someone."""
17577,A true movie classic.
17578,I agree with that
17579,At least Mass and Cali have dates.
17580,Jersey doesn’t even have that
17581,It's about money 💰🤑.
17582,Usa overlords want that cash flow back.
17583,Many more will die but at least they will post good profits again!!
17584,Welcome to the usa 2021 where cdc is a pos lol.
17585,Let's see what their story changes in the next few weeks.
17586,This whole shit show has been unbelievable and we got a lot more.
17587,I'm so fucking tired of privileged work from home-rs
17588,India is suffering the worse of Covid-19.
17589,Yet here we are in the states ready to lift the mask mandate and putting many people in danger.
17590,A CVS employee already got arrested for selling fake Covid-19 vaccine cards .
17591,What is to say some  people will get ahold of  some fake cards.
17592,Just so they don't have to wear mask.
17593,We will definitely see spike in number of cases.
17594,[removed]
17595,Are you always wearing ski masks in Wisconsin?
17596,Some people can’t get the vaccine
17597,What is the point in asking?
17598,People would probably just lie anyway?
17599,"The important thing is, are you vaccinated?"
17600,"If so, then I don't really see the concern."
17601,You are protected.
17602,"If one anti vax person gives it to another, then that isn't your problem."
17603,"Not a comment against you, just a comment on the mathematical illiteracy of the U.S."
17604,I'm willing to bet that the average vaccine-denier is also one who would choose one million dollars over doubling a beginning penny every day for a month.
17605,People really just don't understand how exponential growth works and we're finally meeting an existential threat that doesn't follow the too-familiar linear trends we're so intuitively used to.
17606,"Also, the fun thought experiment: At the beginning of the pandemic (let's say this was unhindered death rate increase and would have remained this way if everyone just went on with life), we jumped from 10k deaths/week (4/4/2020) to 16k deaths/week (4/11/2020)."
17607,"With a 160% increase, we would be sitting at an equation that has a growth rate of 1.6."
17608,"I wrote up a simple little script take this and extrapolate how many weeks it would have taken for 15 million people to die:

`week 1:  16001`  
`week 2:  16003`  
`week 3:  16005`  
`week 4:  16009`  
`week 5:  16016`  
`week 6:  16026`  
`week 7:  16043`  
`week 8:  16070`  
`week 9:  16113`  
`week 10:  16182`  
`...`  
`week 26:  354038`  
`week 27:  556863`  
`week 28:  881381`  
`week 29:  1400611`  
`week 30:  2231378`  
`week 31:  3560606`  
`week 32:  5687371`  
`week 33:  9090195`  
`week 34:  14534713`  
`week 35:  23245941`  
`It would take 35 weeks of unhindered exponential growth for  23245941 dead US citizens.`  


Granted, this is entirely unhindered and should probably assume a logistic growth instead to account for herd immunity, the frequency of novel contact between individuals, etc.. but all those combined wouldn't have been enough to drop this to simple linear growth."
17609,The fact that we were able to *reverse* this trend is 100% because of the economic shut down and getting people to stay indoors.
17610,The northeast is also doing very well.
17611,"I expect that most of the midwest and states like Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Colorado will come around too."
17612,"Now, the South, Great Plains and several of the crimson red flyover states in the west are going to be trickier."
17613,Especially the deep south is not looking good.
17614,Yeah thats because rural America hs descended into a cess pool of ignorance and bigotry.
17615,Being stupid and being a racist are literally the entire cultural identity of most conservatives now.
17616,"sonic adventure 2 is the best sonic game in the series

17661,How are people still so unsure of the actual facts around Covid?
17662,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
17663,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
17664,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

17688,Don’t get Covid then.
17689,Wear a mask or take a vax.
17690,It’s literally up to you.
17691,That's horrifying.
17692,The numbers being quoted are reported deaths after the vaccine was given.
17693,Not deaths caused by the vaccines.
17694,You're conflating the two.
17695,People die all the time for unrelated reasons and this statistic is not useful for determining vaccine safety.
17696,The CDC explicitly states that this statistic is not a relationship between vaccines and the risk of death.

17703,"Its not a unintended consequence, its a feature."
17704,Herd immunity one way or the other.
17705,Get vaccinated or get covid.
17706,"We’ve interacted with 5 or 6 daycares in LA over the past year, all of them require masks for 2 years and above."
17707,I am 37 and cant get a vaccine until maybe in 2-3 months in EU.
17708,I’m not from Germany but my friend is.
17709,He received his shot by keeping in close Whatsapp contact with his GP.
17710,"Apparently this one fine day, the GP messaged him in the morning that there is a cancellation for 17:00hrs slot and asking if he’d like to come in."
17711,"As he lives in Frankfurt with good public transport, he was able to make himself available for the 17:00hrs jab."
17712,"Otherwise, he said that waiting from “official” state method (complicated details), would probably mean he’d auto-selected much, much later."
17713,Good.
17714,So tired of the hysteria and misplaced priorities around risk.
17715,"I have OCD (without germaphobia), and have actually been doing okay."
17716,"Although I will mention that, when those stories went viral last year about people licking things/food in grocery stores, I almost had a breakdown."
17717,"Well if she tested for covid a week later, chances are she already had covid on her birthday and the vaccine wouldnt have done anything anyways"
17718,"Whether we like it or not, everything except for J&amp;J is a 2-dose regimen."
17719,"1-dose results were not studied in trials for Pfizer or Moderna, so we don't have data from a randomized setting to make conclusions."
17720,It's not that hard to wait until you're fully vaccinated.
17721,"Oh yes, I see that strawman *constantly*."

17726,Of course people are going to lie.
17727,This title is silly...
17728,"I want to know who these experts are, and what exactly their qualifications are to make such a bold claim."
17729,People are hesitant to get AZ and can't get Pfizer due to Biontech contract with Fosun.
17730,That leaves Moderna as the only option as JJ has the same clot issue.
17731,"Sadly, there’s people like my girlfriend whose on immunosuppressants for whom the vaccine won’t have very much efficacy."
17732,And her rheumatologist says she can’t take it until she’s tapered off the steroids and chemo.
17733,People like us feel kind of forgotten.
17734,I can only hope enough people get vaccinated to the point where it slows down in our city for us to relax a little.
17735,"The problem is everyone will just say they are vaccinated even if they are not, and that’s considering if they are asked which they probably won’t be."
17736,"Also the vaccine doesn’t make you immune, I’ll still be wearing my mask in stores."
17737,"And even if it doesn't trigger an autoimmune disease, haven't cytokine storms played a large role in bad covid cases?"
17738,It's actual brigading.
17739,"The mods of a related covid sub literally confirmed that lockdown ""skeptics"" were running organized brigading campaigns."
17740,You can see the signs everywhere.
17741,"The clearest pattern I've seen is that they try to hit the smaller posts, but get drowned out by more reasonable voices once a post gets popular enough."
17742,Tucker Carlson literally told his viewers to harrass people wearing masks.
17743,They'll do anything he says
17744,that's good right?
17745,That means it's not an echo chamber.
17746,Or maybe there are multiple nodes of resonance.
17747,Well they've had to change their shit.
17748,And they may need to keep it changed.
17749,Did they already have covid?
17750,Or they just dont want the vaccine?
17751,One issue is people that have had covid dont think the vaccine isnt needed since they got covid and were fine.

17758,"Personally I’m still going to be wearing one, honestly I don’t even mind covering my face anymore, I’ve gotten so used to it."
17759,I want to hear more about it
17760,"The shot was fine, I got it ASAP when I was eligible, but the day after shot #2 kicked my ass sideways."
17761,Woke up at 3am in cold sweats with a headache from my eyeballs to the back of my head that felt like I’d drank all the beer at Oktoberfest.

17774,Long covid isn't a thing when you're fully vaccinated.
17775,If you do get sick it'll either be asymptomatic or at the most you'll have something close to a headache.
17776,That's it.
17777,Long covid is severe illness which you're protected against completely.
17778,Also you basically can't spread the virus either so yeah you're safe to take your mask off.
17779,Enjoy your life.
17780,It’s also perfectly reasonable to hold government officials and agencies to account.
17781,"Just because I agreed with their rationale and sensibility about instituting mask mandates, that doesn’t lock me in to agreeing with every single subsequent action they take."

17785,Im vaccinated but I understand why people dont want to get one.
17786,What’s with the people in the comments to the other posts vs the people in this thread?

17796,Does this mean that TV studios will bring back studio audiences soon along with talk shows ending the 6 feet apart rule for their hosts?
17797,"I know NBC's ""Today"" was the first to do so."
17798,"I'd just like to say do your own research, please don't rely on one report/study."
17799,"If you still feel unsafe, please wear mask and practice safe distance  practice - I personally think outside is safer than the inside and I keep 6 feet when inside and less than that when I am outside."
17800,You do what you think is best for your own health and your loved ones.
17801,"And anti-masks, please leave those who wear mask."
17802,It's their own decision to keep it on.
17803,Good news.
17804,But this is the type of race that is only truly won when both teams cross the finish line.
17805,"All the teams around the world, actually."
17806,Personal safety isn’t the issue.
17807,I may be a bit selfish but I’d rather not see a 4th close person die from COVID just so I can join others in not wearing a mask.
17808,If we as a country would just enforce the rules this whole thing could’ve been 2-3 months of hard quarantine and the rest of it could’ve been lax.
17809,We have enough supply in the Netherlands at the moment.
17810,Only Janssen and AstraZeneca are failing to deliver but the difference is made up by an extra order of Pfizer/BioNTech doses.
17811,"As a Texan, this is wonderful news, but it doesn't take away the heartbreak of knowing my dear friend lost her 18 year old sister to Covid on Friday."
17812,Not sure what day her death would actually show up in the data.

17817,Rip everyone who works in tourism
17818,True.
17819,It may have been that way since it’s inception tbh.
17820,Sucks that we couldn't make wearing a mask when you have a cough/cold a normal social expectation.
17821,I've really enjoyed not having multiple horrible colds every year.
17822,Already vaccinated.
17823,But even if you are vaccinated there is still a chance of getting Covid.
17824,"Well I wasn't even alive during the first half of that pandemic and was a kid before the treatments had been developed, so it hadn't affected me in any way."
17825,But yes this is new.
17826,Israel never had had (as far as I know) any Indian variants.
17827,"If they do, we will see how well the vaccines fare, and that would dictate what the rest of the world will deal with."
17828,Also we have never had a vaccine for MERS or SARS 1.
17829,I wonder why this is.
17830,No coronavirus has ever had a vaccine developed for it before.
17831,This is all new.
17832,I am happy with the spot we are in now.
17833,But stranger things have happened.
17834,You must not work in retail.
17835,"&gt;Their statements have always been technically correct 

They don't even have that going for them."
17836,At the start of the pandemic they advised against wearing masks.

17883,"I live in AZ, and I’m vaccinated."
17884,As I go into Target I realize that wearing my mask makes me look like I’m NOT vaccinated.
17885,But then I remember it’s Arizona.
17886,I just look like I don’t fit in.
17887,Of course people will lie about being vaccinated.
17888,"But as long as *you* are fully vaccinated, it’s irrelevant whether other people lie or not as far as your own personal safety goes."
17889,"The odds of you getting covid are minimal, the odds of you getting covid and having symptoms any worse than a cold are infinitely small, and the odds of you being hospitalized or dying are practically nonexistent."

17891,"You have a 1 in 15,300 chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime, for reference, and a 1 in 103 chance of dying in a car accident."
17892,"Especially if you choose to still wear a mask, people lying about their vaccination status is irrelevant to your personal safety."
17893,"I also hate needles, but I practically skipped into my vaccination site."
17894,It's the weakest shot I've ever felt too.
17895,"Yeah, we know."
17896,"I was hoping he would change his mind today, especially now that Cuomo changed his, but I guess not."

I'm 100% pro-science, but if the CDC says that we can return to normal if we're vaccinated, we should have every right to do so."

17899,"It's not a problem for me, it's a problem with saying being vaccinated means you can go back to normal."
17900,Covid deniers and anti-vaxxefs are just going to lie.
17901,CDC bungled this communication just as it has done with masks from the very beginning.

17908,"For me there is something comforting about it, not sure."
17909,"They aren’t the most comfortable to wear for hours though, so I wouldn’t go that far."
17910,What did you do differently in public during the AIDS epidemic/Pandemic when compared to the measures people have gone to for Covid?
17911,"And come on now, comparing a vaccine for the Spanish Flu in the 1920s compared to vaccines being developed now??"
17912,"Vaccines were still relatively ""new"" medicine at that time, this comparison you are trying to make is quite silly."
17913,"Also, SARS-Cov-2 may be ""novel"" but it is a subtype of coronavirus which has been around for centuries."
17914,Scientists have had knowledge on this virus for a long time now which is partially why vaccine development was so fast.

17925,Woooo!!
17926,!
17927,Countries that have herd immunity by vaccination or infection can tolerate small amounts of community spread because it can’t grow exponentially anymore.
17928,So they can tolerate importing some COVID-19.
17929,"Here in Australia, very few were infected, and vaccination is slow, thanks to our corrupt/do-nothing federal government’s approach to vaccine acquisition through the past year."
17930,"We don’t have anything resembling herd immunity, so if community transmission isn’t held back by contact tracing (which can’t handle large amounts of cases), it will rapidly grow out of control, as most countries saw through 2020."
17931,We can’t open our borders until there’s a high level of vaccination.
17932,Hell yeah!
17933,Vaccinated and mask free!!

17945,There are thousands of things that are far more likely to kill or negatively effect your children than Covid-19.
17946,Keeping mandates in place to keep the population that is *barely* effected by the virus makes zero sense.
17947,"Kids’ immune systems are incredibly robust, especially when it comes to Covid 19."

17982,That would imply a new pandemic though!
17983,&gt;A lot of travel = proximity to the epicenter and affected areas = the gravity of the situation that the CDC faces.
17984,"If they were to test everyone including the domestic population, then they would've been severely overwhelmed."
17985,So the decision was made to be aggressive at the border instead.
17986,"Since the early patients have all recovered, there was no need to aggressively test the entire population and instead save the ammunition for the next wave."

18042,"I’m not a specialist so that may be true, but my kid gets a yearly flu shot and I was very cautious about where we went during flu season before they were old enough for a flu shot."
18043,Plus we know a lot more about the flu in terms of treatment and potential after effects.
18044,So there’s things we can do to protect/treat from the flu.
18045,"With Covid, sure, my kid could get it and be fine."
18046,But there’s also a chance they could get it and have lifelong problems because of it.
18047,My kid’s life is literally just beginning and I don’t feel like taking risks that could affect them forever and I know a lot of parents with kid under 12 that feel the same way.
18048,At least when everyone was masked indoors there was some level of protection and now that’s gone.
18049,I don’t feel like the convenience of being able to take my kid to the store to grab milk is worth the risk of permanent cardiovascular issues because everyone in my neighborhood’s orange god king told them not to get the vaccine because this is a hoax.
18050,"Anecdotally, I know someone whose 7 year old had a relatively mild case of Covid at the beginning of this year and she still is not 100%."

18083,"I'm not saying that other people should wear masks, I'm just saying that it should be normalized."

18123,Because the pandemic has been a blast.
18124,There is certainly a disconnect for some between taking the pandemic seriously and getting the vaccine.
18125,I live in a city and work in a rural area in the midwest.

18136,I'm not sure of our official policy before this.
18137,"I know at my store we had a cart cleaner up front who would tell people to put on masks and hand them out if they didn't have one, a giant sign that says to wear masks, and also our AP (security) were the only ones to ever tell people to put a mask on once inside the store."
18138,"However, they're constantly busy and sometimes in the security office so I didn't really see them enforcing very much."
18139,"Google ""CDC provisional covid deaths""

You will see 287 children (0-17) have died of covid in this entire pandemic."
18140,"Weekly state level data can be found at the AAP's website, I was just looking today."
18141,Kids have been responsible for a pretty low % of cases (topped out at 24% when adult cases plummeted).
18142,"Evidence suggests high levels of resistance and/or immunity for children, although the CDC does recognize the danger to very young infants (same as flu)"
18143,You want a fucking medal for hoarding vaccines while the rest of the world was facing shortages (in no small part due to US export restrictions on vaccines and raw material) and gifting your surplus of unapproved AstraZeneca vaccines *months* after?
18144,"Kentucky also, last time I saw 10+ people without masks and would normally see 1 at the most."
18145,People are definitely taking advantage of some stores policies in other stores already
18146,Understood.
18147,"But unvaccinated adults do, and we’ve not been given tools or methods to determine who is or isn’t vaccinated."
18148,"I would have liked to see indoor masking in public places until we had vaccine availability to more people, or at least higher vaccination rates."

18152,The spread is stopped with herd immunity but that level changes based on r number.
18153,Formula is 1-(1/r).
18154,Original Covid May have been r2.5.
18155,1-(1/2.5) = 1-0.4 = 0.6 (60%).
18156,"UK variant was say 70% more transmittable, 2.5 x 1.7 = r4.25 or 76%."
18157,"Indian variant is 50% more transmittable, 4.25 x 1.5 = r6.375 or 85%."
18158,"There are about 54 million adults out of 67million people, so if all vaccinated, 80% herd immunity."
18159,Infections add to this.
18160,"R number is changed depending on situation, so just going for a walk reduces it, going to a full stadium for football increases it."
18161,OSHA can't require that.
18162,Children under 12 are not at risk of adverse reaction in general.
18163,"Additionally, if you are concerned about their well being, be selective in where you send them."
18164,There is no justification for forcing vaccinated adults to wear masks.
18165,Not even the super-cautious CDC agrees with that.
18166,Voluntary masking is still an option - anyone who's unvaccinated and following CDC guidance is still wearing a mask.
18167,If they aren't following it now I don't think we have any reason to believe they did then with no mandate.
18168,"I will give you that the major chains removing the requirement is a change, but local stores, restaurants, etc already could."
18169,"Given that there was *no* uptick when TX removed mandates, I don't see why Target removing the requirement now will make a difference."
18170,"Ultimately, we'll know in a couple of weeks, but nothing you've presented here is any reason that this will increase cases."
18171,They've continued to drop through all loosening of restrictions over the past couple of months.

18173,Why were they even a thing to begin with?
18174,I was out and about yesterday and heard someone say that they're going to get the shot so they don't have to wear their mask at work.
18175,Incentives work.
18176,"Yeah, but I consider it a pediatrician's job to stay up to date on research in this area."
18177,A pediatrician should be able to read studies and determine a reasonable and science based response to tell parents who ask.
18178,So get a different dentist.
18179,"""Some people are catching it despite being vaccinated"" =/= ""full immunity doesn't exist""

We know the vaccines aren't 100% effective."
18180,Vaccinated adults pose no threat to your children.
18181,I'm not going to pretend I'm unvaccinated because it would placate your fears.
18182,I want to understand why some state schools say they can’t require the vaccine because it’s not fully FDA approved (just have emergency authorization) while other states just go ahead and do it.
18183,I’m guessing the states that are claiming they can’t require vaccines for their state universities are just lying?
18184,90% of those not getting vaccines are also not going to wear masks.
18185,That’s just the reality.
18186,Hopefully too many don’t get sick or create a mutant virus.
18187,[removed]
18188,Since the unvaccinated currently includes everyone under the age of 12 and nearly everyone under age 16 (not enough time has passed since it was approved) it seems like a rushed effort.
18189,I was “lucky” because I am in a higher risk group and could sign up in March in my state.
18190,This was only because we didn’t have enough takers.
18191,Many states just started opening up for younger adults and not enough time has passed for them to be fully vaccinated yet either.
18192,movies releases have slowed to a crawl though
18193,"It’s more than a horrible look, it’s an abdication of their duty to their people."
18194,Happens more than you think…
18195,So be selective in where you send your children?
18196,They are not at high risk in general.
18197,That’s what I was gonna say!
18198,I was like- heard of a neck gaiter?
18199,They help with sunburns too.

18204,No place in the country is going to legally mandate vaccination.

18238,"We'd be right smack dab in the middle of flu season, so it makes sense to just keep wearing it for 6 months after that."
18239,We could really reduce the number of flu deaths if more people masked up full-time during the flu.

18290,I'd have preferred for us to wait until July to lift mask mandates and 100% capacity but with how well protection seems after a single shot I understand lowering restrictions over the next month.

18298,"And with no one verifying who actually got vaccinated at the door at any given public place (it'd be absurd to try), only people who got enough of a hall monitor conscience going on will bother if they didn't want to get it before."
18299,The people who never believed in this are now going to use this as an excuse to go out unmasked and potentially cause an upswing in the virus yet again.
18300,"Meantime, there are people who are inbetween doses or waiting on an appointment time, and people who are immunocompromised."
18301,But I guess those people don't matter because of a vague guess that more people will willingly go get a vaccine.
18302,The mRNA vaccines don’t function the same way the flu vaccine does.
18303,It’s a completely different mechanism.

18310,Vaccines are incredibly accessible right now though in the USA though.
18311,"So while young people have had less time, they also didn't have the long waits for appointments."
18312,"We're at the point where if you have not started, then it's a question of wanting to, not it being not accessible."
18313,"I know reddit likes to dunk on boomers, but the available data suggests that it's going to be younger people which keep percentages down."
18314,Great time for the third wave!
18315,Well that's a silly reason to wear a mask.
18316,"I will continue to wear one in many contexts, but not for that reason."
18317,“Listen to the experts!
18318,"The vaccine works, get it!”

The experts: “Okay if you’re vaccinated no need for a mask, since the vaccine works just as well.”

“The experts have no clue what they’re talking about."
18319,Way too politicized!
18320,Can’t be trusted!”
18321,People have a hard time looking inward.
18322,Just look at the video.
18323,It's absurd how some of the people are reacting.
18324,We can all take a step back and laugh even if its about our hobby.
18325,[removed]
18326,You know how there isn't a cure for the common cold?
18327,Or how the flu vaccine changes from year to year and isn't always fully effective?
18328,This is evidence that it’s a thing (i.e.
18329,": virus mutation) that could actually happen, because we observe the exact same phenomenon all the time in the real world"
18330,That's cool.
18331,People are free to mask up as needed and decide for themselves.
18332,[removed]
18333,Keep in mind that the CDC isn’t necessarily trying to reduce cases.
18334,They’re trying to keep hospitalization and death rates low; that’s what they’ve always been trying to do.
18335,"Before the vaccines, reducing spread was the only way to keep hospitalization and death rates down."
18336,Now that vaccines can do that job.
18337,Somebody with even just one shot is going to have a much milder case if they do catch COVID.
18338,"The CDC is switching to the stance that infection rates aren’t a huge deal anymore, as long as the vaccines do their job of keeping people out of hospitals and not dying."
18339,This kind of thinking is what is going to allow the government to control our lives forever.
18340,We can’t fear ever little thing that might threaten our safety.
18341,"Wearing masks was a reasonable response to the pandemic, but it’s time we go back to normal."
18342,It’s pretty damn safe now.
18343,We cannot let a virus defeat us.
18344,"The numbers ramped up last fall because vaccinations hadn't begun yet, and only a very small percentage of the population had acquired a natural immunity through previous infection."
18345,"Now, between vaccination and immunity from previous infection, we're much closer to the numbers needed for herd immunity."
18346,Don’t forget that there are also many doctors out there in the wild who cater to these flocks.
18347,Not all doctors have a solid grasp or appreciation for the field of immunology
18348,If I have mono should I get my second covid vaccine tomorrow?
18349,that really is the most annoying thing.
18350,i'm at walmart (canada) and we quickly realized we would never have the right to remove the unmasked from our stores.
18351,we've had greeters get spat on and the most we can do is call a manager.
18352,Yeah there are a surprising amount of people that feel this way
18353,Also all those new articles regarding cleanliness and air quality of different areas.
18354,"Reading how toxic the air quality of the NYC subways actually are, masks will now always be on me as a daily routine like putting on my pants."
18355,Thanks for the link!
18356,"Bummer, I was hoping to stop wearing one at the Airport I work at."
18357,[removed]
18358,"Newsom *is* following the science probably more closely than a lot of States, though, because the CDC guidance was pretty specific--*vaccinated* people can mostly operate unmasked."
18359,"California is simply allowing the number of vaccinated individuals to rise a bit more, especially vaccinated kids, before opening the floodgates, so to speak."
18360,"Plus, the State had already announced it would be reopening June 15, and schools, businesses, etc have been using that as a target, so it doesn't seem unreasonable to just keep that date and drop the mask mandate then as well."
18361,Plenty of institutions are being far more conservative on their reopening plans in the State.
18362,"Both of the colleges where I teach will still be on almost entirely remote instruction for Fall 2021, with full reopening only happening next Spring."
18363,"Suits me fine, as I love working from home, but I know not everyone is happy with this arrangement."
18364,I'm also an employee.
18365,Have you also noticed a lot of people walking around with shit-eating grins?
18366,"No you were bitching about how you can’t wear a mask for hours and how teachers can’t do that, when millions do."
18367,Perhaps quit acting like a child and people won’t treat you like one
18368,&gt;Yup.
18369,"I had to go fuck-far to get both my shots (not as bad as it sounds to some, still, sheeeit) and I got my second on the 7th."
18370,I'm sort of high risk and it was not just a matter of strolling down the street.
18371,Also not every one has the ability get vaccinated on a weekday.
18372,So they would need to wait for an appointment on the weekend.
18373,And I would assume weekend slots are in high demand so you might need to wait a couple of weeks.
18374,So is the CDC just not going to post vaccine data today?
18375,Go read the r/politics thread about the CDCs new guidance and people literally say that they don't want to take their mask off so people don't think they're Republicans.
18376,In a downtrend I would say yes.
18377,"Because the downtrend involves a few things:

first dose then second dose: this means that the trend stays flatter longer, since people are getting their second doses a few weeks after their first (still contributes to number of Shots given/appointments)

The downtrend will naturally occur as more become vaccinated, and more get their second doses."
18378,"As anti-Vaxers continue to not want the dose, the pool of unvaccinated people decreases, so downtrend continues."
18379,"Then the lottery announcement comes then a spike, considering this is the only thing that changed compared to the natural downtrend, it Can be assumed this is the cause of the spike."
18380,And it’s a ‘spike’ since it bucked the downtrend.
18381,Is Parker a place?
18382,I see I mistyped car instead of card lol
18383,"No, this is Patrick"
18384,This is great news!
18385,"My family back home has been through so many shutdowns, and I have tons of family that are high risk."
18386,They’ve finally gotten their first shots which makes me happy.
18387,I think their wait time for the second is four months.
18388,I doubt that.
18389,It's just the started people over 18 can finally get their shot.
18390,Booking mine now

18398,Thank you for your reply.
18399,I appreciate it
18400,The Cartmanland approach.
18401,"While we will likely never definitively know where the virus originated from due to China's unwillingness to openly investigate, it will likely be fairly easy the reverse engineer the COVID19 virus to find the two original source coronaviruses (if they exist) to create a genomic matching hybrid."
18402,"If so, the virus was likely man-made."
18403,"If not, the virus likely came from the wild."
18404,"Right now, it sure looks like there's a coverup."
18405,OMG it even looks like it was designed by the Ohio Lottery!
18406,That's brilliant!
18407,I don’t think you understand the constitutional rights
18408,"Vaccines work, especially in lowering risk of hospitalization/death."
18409,Looks like the CDC knows what they're doing!
18410,[removed]
18411,"After 12+ months of masks, I'm not surprised there's some momentum behind it."
18412,Most people don't follow this sub or watch CDC updates all that closely.
18413,"You know, I think anyone would take free guns."
18414,Guns are cool.
18415,"Instead of money they could make the prize one big ass Cummins turbo diesel coal roller 

Hell yeah brother!"
18416,This might be the most absurd thing I've heard this week.
18417,"The craziest part is that there has never been a vaccine that doesn’t severely reduce spread, to even suggest it without evidence of being a concern is absolutely bonkers to me."
18418,[removed]
18419,"Thanks for this comment, I hadn't seen these articles discussed elsewhere, which was part of my point."
18420,"The resources are out there, but weren't promoted as much as some people would have liked."
18421,"[Compare this to the number of articles about masks/social distancing]

(Not implying these are equally effective, just not proportionally reported)"
18422,[removed]
18423,"Maybe I'm biased because I live in a border city but they should open the border for fully vaccinated people, there really is no reason not to."
18424,Your assumption makes you wrong.
18425,It’s always been about reaching herd immunity and not letting kids get mass infected for me.
18426,"I seriously don't understand the ""what about the children and immunocompromised"" argument."
18427,Parents have the agency to choose where their &lt;=age 11 children can/can't go and the immunocompromised are perfectly free to wear N95 masks or socially distance until they/their doctors feel it is safe.
18428,We have gone from 0% of the vulnerable having the ability to protect themselves in December 2020 to &gt;99% now.
18429,It is lunacy to pretend that a step change of that magnitude warrants the same precautions by all of society that we have take for the past 15 months.
18430,Do you live in the USA?
18431,It's OK now that your quarantine period is over.
18432,"If so, yes, you can get vaccinated as long as you are either 

18 years or older

12-17 years old with parental permission (most places won't vaccinate kids without parental permission, such as a parent present)"
18433,"Or alternatively, why waist your only time with youth on working for other people?"
18434,One life to live and partying when older is not the same experience.
18435,"I say fuck that, get out and live your life while your are young and full of energy."
18436,See the world before it hurts too much to do it right.
18437,"Have sex with a ton of different people, climb mountains, surf all the oceans, make music with whatever you have on the beach somewhere...

Then settle down for a quiet life when you're body aches."
18438,Your don't need much to survive if you aren't obsessed with the material.
18439,"“No medical evidence nor authority was cited in the claim.”
Meanwhile the Indian variant is the biggest concern here in the UK and India became a red zone 17 days after neighbouring countries did for the UK."
18440,Funny that.
18441,"Thats government, always been that way."
18442,Damned if you do damned if you don’t.
18443,I think they are limiting the age group.
18444,"18-30, I think?"
18445,To try and motivate the group with the lowest vax rate.
18446,Experiencing the same thing where I'm at.
18447,We never had a state mandate but in my area many people masked up without protest.
18448,You would hardly notice that most stores in my area have dropped mask requirements.
18449,"I think masks have become a security blanket, even for many who protested early on."
18450,"It makes people feel like they're doing something, anything."
18451,Yes that was the prediction at the time.
18452,There is already plenty of evidence showing COVID is not man made.
18453,If it leaked from a lab due to bad protocol there is still no reason to punish China.
18454,"Lab/industrial accidents happen all the time, it’s unfortunate and we should strive to improve protocol so it doesn’t happen again."
18455,I don’t hear anyone wanting to punish USSR for Chernobyl or USA for three mile.
18456,Japan is currently dumping contaminated water in the ocean and you barely hear it in the news.
18457,"This whole narrative of wanting to punish China for COVID is just propaganda to divert anger, really people should be asking why their own government isn’t prepared for/properly handling a pandemic."
18458,The mask announcement is all everybody I know in real life is talking about.
18459,Of course.
18460,I was in a Costco this past Saturday where 90% of the people had already ditched their mask (I was one of them).
18461,"I live in a state where we've had roughly 50% of people with one dose and while it's possible that vaccinated people were just over represented among Costco shoppers, I doubt it."
18462,Live?
18463,Sure.
18464,Continue to follow guidelines while the rest of the country isn’t?
18465,Doubtful.
18466,This is where I am at.
18467,My oldest will be 12 in a month and he’ll get his vaccine.
18468,All the adults we interact with regularly have been vaccinated.
18469,I feel like the risk of my younger 2 getting a severe case is so minimal that I am not going to stress over it any more.
18470,We’ll continue to stay away from crowded indoor places until they can be vaccinated but otherwise I am going to let them live their lives.
18471,My daughter is in kindergarten and has been in school all year full time without masks (required for the higher grades but not the younger ones) and there hasn’t been a single issue.
18472,Good news is it is much easier to find n95s now.
18473,"If I were immunocompromised in your position I'd mask up with best mask I could find until cases drop to a low risk level, but that's just me."
18474,This will probably be reduced to under 10 days as BioNTech/Pfizer deliveries double from the week of 31 May onwards (as noted by someone else below).

18547,I'm not.

18551,Anyone that's willfully unvaxxed can kiss my ass.
18552,This is the main reasoning see being used for why vaccinated people should still mask up.
18553,"I don't feel like I should have to wear a mask everywhere I go to serve as some moral example to those who were most likely not following any rules to begin with, or only did because they were heavily shamed into it."
18554,I've already stopped wearing my mask places that aren't requiring it and I feel zero guilt about it.
18555,I did my part and wore a mask when no vaccine was available and then got vaccinated when one was.
18556,I even still wore a mask until vaccines became available to every adult in my state.
18557,Now it's available everywhere in my state.

18617,"I've also seen this said, but I don't have a source for that claim so I tend to just stick with what the CDC said."
18618,It's just annoying how the goalposts have shifted for the last year on what is necessary.
18619,"The goalposts are arbitrarily shifting from ""we need to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed"" to ""any sort of loss of life from COVID is unacceptable"", with various stops in between."
18620,"I've been all for the lockdowns and mandates for the last year, but I just hate how the goalposts are shifting at this point to justify continuing these measures when they're not needed for what your initial goals were."

18653,"No matter what, this vaccine is definitely a slow burn, and I could absolutely see it giving people a false sense of confidence."
18654,Who is going to have the patience to wait almost two months for it to reach a mediocre level of efficacy that you could have reached after a week or so of Pfizer?
18655,Discuss your concerns with your doctors and take the same precautions you did during every flu season before this current pandemic.
18656,"The only way out is vaccinations, no matter how much you lock down to stop cases they will always pop back up and then you start the process all over again."
18657,It's honestly absolutely insane that Australia's government thinks having everyone vaccinated by the middle of 2022 so the borders can re open is reasonable.
18658,"I wish countries would realize some of us have a reason to travel besides tourism, my fiancé lives in another 0 covid country (Vietnam) and I haven't been able to see her in over a year and half, and I honestly doubt I'll get over there any time in 2021 either because of the border closures."
18659,"I'd pay anything I could, quarantine for a month, and I'm fully vaccinated just to see her again."
18660,"UK data does suggest that the AZ blood clot issue is dramatically less likely to occur after the second dose, if it didn't show up after the first."
18661,"So from my standpoint, the data supports gvimg everybody who had a first dose of AZ their second dose."
18662,"But being cautious about first doses of AZ, particularly in younger age groups where the risk vs. benefit is a bit more murky."
18663,Should you catch covid (hope you dont!

18701,Get the first one you can.
18702,"But those other unvaccinated people, presumably, are ok with the risk because they have chosen not to be vaccinated despite it being as available as possible to adults."
18703,How do you not know this after months of vaccine distribution?
18704,"Obviously this excludes people who want the vaccine but can’t get it due to being immune compromised, but maybe those people can get n-95s and or stay home."
18705,"Also excludes children under 12, but statistically they very low risk with this virus anyway, and if you as a parent are scared, keep your kid at home."

18719,"But in reality, I haven't been worrying about my mask this last week, except where required."
18720,"so annoying, and when my country its slow its fault of the EU even tho America refused to export vaccines while EU exported a lot."
18721,Underpromise and overdeliver
18722,I just skimmed through a study from the UK where we have a 12 week gap between first and second doses.
18723,"Key takeaway was this:

&gt; Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19."
18724,"(BNT162b2is Pfizer)

A first dose of Pfizer is 85% efective at preventing death from COVID."
18725,Astra zeneca was similar.
18726,"That is very good effectiveness with just the single dose, so I think Canada can be happy in its current strategy of getting as many people first doses as possible."
18727,"If you had 20 people who would be getting COVID and dieing, and gave 10 of them first and second doses, and 10 nothing, you'd expect 10 deaths."

18730,Yes it's basically a case of faulty PPE at that point.

18732,"Health services have continued to function in Sweden, Korea, Japan and Taiwan too."
18733,And they got to keep their rights.
18734,This is a false equivalence.
18735,"This isn’t just because of masks - it’s from people working from home, businesses having reduced capacity, school closures, people socializing less in general, people cancelling anything when they have a sniffle."
18736,Wear a mask if you want but I miss interacting with people and actually seeing their faces.
18737,I think there was a middle ground here that the CDC completely missed.
18738,"See top comment here, stores offering masked hours or keeping essential stores masked while still allowing vaccinated adults to go about their social lives more normally would have been a great recommendation in my opinion."
18739,And then say when state/local population reaches X% vaccination you can even do away with those protocols.

18751,"&gt; That second dose of CoronaVac is vital

Either the second dose is vital, or the first dose just takes several weeks to become effective."

18866,If it encourages a lot of hesitant people to get a shot then we will win.
18867,We don't know.
18868,We may never know.
18869,You too!

18874,There are enough kids with higher risk conditions that we can mask for A FEW MONTHS until they can get vaccinated.
18875,It is completely factual.
18876,At most you'll get a headache and then your antibodies will get rid of it and you won't spread it either.
18877,This is the reason we are getting vaccines otherwise what's the point?
18878,I think PA might reach their goal of 70% of adults fully vaccinated before June ends.
18879,"We're currently at 67.7% with one dose, and it's been increasing by .2 to .4 percentage points a day (most commonly .3)."
18880,"Unless there's a very sudden wall, we should get 70% with the first dose before Memorial Day and then it's four weeks, give or take, before they're fully vaccinated."
18881,I think your view is sane and totally reasonable for a parent - I encourage everyone to do what they believe is best for them in according with the recommendations.
18882,"If that means masking for the sake of your kids, thats fine, if it means dumping the mask due to being vaccinated, thats fine too."
18883,Personal choice and freedoms is the name of the game.
18884,"If your mask is causing air flow restriction or breathing issues, then you have a bad mask."
18885,Right there with you.
18886,I don't trust this change.
18887,Again… who cares?
18888,"If fully vaxxed your risk from the disease, being around non vaxxed or not, is so damn minuscule it’s not even worth thinking about."
18889,Incidentally this is a great way for Delta to get in trouble with the EEOC.
18890,The EEOC has published pretty positive guidance on employers mandating vaccines (with some caveats) but the big no no remains differential treatment of employees.
18891,Either it's a bonafide occupational requirement to be vaccinated or it's not; by only applying this to new hires they are creating a differential requirement.
18892,"Delta can still get away with it, but they will have to be very generous with religious exemptions (which will be abused) and other exceptions if they want to maintain a different standard between new hires and existing employees."
18893,Most likely you would never even know they were infected.
18894,"For that matter, there’s a decent chance they’ve already had it and you never knew."
18895,This probably has been mentioned... but i can't find it with a quick scroll.
18896,I have several co-workers located in Canada.
18897,ALL of them have their first dose.
18898,None of them have the second dose.
18899,"ALL of them have 2+ months, some 3 months, scheduled between doses."
18900,"One of them just got hit first dose, second dose is tentatively scheduled for mid August."
18901,Canada is rolling the dice by opting to vaccinate everyone with one dose ASAP while pushing second doses out months past 'recommended' gap periods to achieve their goal.
18902,"Do more people, as a percentage, seem to want the vaccine in Canada compared to the US?"
18903,Yes.
18904,This is fantastic news.
18905,But they also aren't going to be fully vaccinated for quite some time.
18906,"Depending on how the gamble pays off, they may not technically be fully vaccinated with this first push period if the booster proves to be less effective due to the time gap."
18907,IMO - this is a 'win' only on the public perception side.
18908,But this is where it stops (for now).
18909,Whether or not it's a win in terms of vaccination effectiveness is TBD.
18910,Big gamble which we'll have to wait in see for whether it pays off.
18911,"I feel like lifting the mask mandate is an attempt by the CDC to up vax rates, and when rates are up the CDCs stance will change again to mandate masks..."
18912,Does anyone remember when the CDC said not to wear masks they did not know if they were effective (they are) and they didn't think the us population was smart enough to use them effectively (this is still up for debate for some of the population).
18913,Jesus....this whole thing has really broken a lot of ppl.
18914,It's sad...
18915,I expect EU to use 5M vaccines doses on daily average in June.
18916,From May 31st weekly Pfizer delveries are increasing by 60% and its main vaccine EU is using
18917,They've already said that there's 100% chance of no severe problems... Long covid is severe.
18918,Why is everyone so scared of this virus after they are fully vaccinated?
18919,The penalizing they’ll get is catching COVID.
18920,"I’m glad it’s working but it is really sad that people are like “it’s not safe” etc etc until they can win money, then it’s all good."
18921,It makes it feel like it was never really about safety
18922,"I think that's part of the problem why everybody hates masks, or had such an issue with masks."
18923,It's the fact that they were all using shitty masks.

18940,Why do you believe it’s social pressure and not just people are used to wearing masks and it’s not a big deal to wear it while in a store?
18941,"Oh, I got the mechanism backwards!"
18942,"Children actually have increased numbers of ACE2 compared to adults, including free-floating enzyme in blood serum."
18943,"The theory goes that the free ACE2 in the blood can act as a binding site for virus particles, so it binds there instead of on your cells."
18944,"I think I had read that the Brazil variant binds more stably or preferably to ACE2 on cells, but can't find that at the moment."

18948,"Almost every single way you would compare 2 countries, especially with wildly different populations, you would use per capita."
18949,That's just the way numbers work.
18950,So why do absolute numbers matter at all here?
18951,"It’s mostly because many of them probably already had it, and they had lots of deaths there already."
18952,And the people that caught it without noticing raised the immunity.

18960,"According to american redditors here, EU putting any restrictions whatsoever on their vaccine exports would cause vaccine manufacturers to flee the EU."
18961,So according to that logic we can expect the US to become whatever is the opposite of a vaccine powerhouse?
18962,&gt; Our study focuses on the Swedish case to quantify the effect of a lockdown on COVID-19 infections and deaths.
18963,"We may summarize our results in four findings: First, we find the effect to be sizable and robust across specifications: it ranges from -27% to -77% for infections and from -26% to -82% for deaths."
18964,"Second, the lockdown effect starts to materialize with a delay of 3–4 weeks only."
18965,"Third, the actual adjustment of mobility patterns in Sweden suggests there has been substantial voluntary social restraint, although the adjustment was less strong than under the lockdown scenario."
18966,"Lastly, we find that a lockdown would not have caused much additional output loss."
18967,Also reduces Medicaid and Medicare costs significantly.
18968,Total win-win.

18980,Or you can twist that same statistic around and say 'over 3/4ths of young people said they would return to work or school even if the vaccine wasn't mandatory'... which doesn't sound like much of a demand.
18981,The default when comparing countries (especially countries with an 10x difference in populations) is pretty much ALWAYS per capita.
18982,"We would never use absolute numbers for that, because they are effectively meaningless..."

18986,"India went many months with very low activity, then it randomly took off and they have been on fire ever since."

18988,"It is anyone's guess right now, but Michigan has shown us that even 35-40% vaccinated isn't high enough to prevent a good size spike."
18989,"No, this should be a wake up call to any nation that decided to go for a covid zero strategy."

19000,"The way they talk about the disease itself, they're constantly minimizing its effects."
19001,"""Why would you take any steps to prevent yourself from getting a disease with a mortality rate of 0.000000000000001%,"" they'll ask, adding a few more zeroes since the last time they posed the question?"
19002,And yet the purported reactions are experienced by a minuscule fraction of the amount of the population who have actually died from it?
19003,Those may as well be 50/50 odds in their eyes.
19004,Forcing people to wear them and limiting indoor capacity is.
19005,"If you want to wear them, go ahead."

19014,Get out of here with your conspiracy bull.
19015,How much longer do you really believe your entire small town will have a majority of people wearing masks?

19027,Canada is much closer culturally etc to the USA than it is to any country in Europe or the rest of the world.
19028,"The only other good comparison point Canadians can use is our brothers in Australia (which we also compare ourselves to sometimes, just not as much because they're not as close)."

19038,"Down here in Florida, it's been that way for months."
19039,It never sat right with me that people who were left-leaning went on moral tirades about people who didn't follow lockdown rules to a T. They even went so far as to say those people should be required to sign a waiver denying treatment for COVID if they got it.
19040,I thought healthcare was a right?

19051,After CDCs announcement I've seen several.
19052,Who knows if they're vaxxed or not.
19053,The thing about feeling sick from the vaccine is you know it will end soon and it’s not dangerous.
19054,People with covid can feel sick for weeks and you never really know if you will be the one that takes a turn for the worse.
19055,"Our initial target was September, based on all the scheduled deliveries."

19138,There are various possible scenario's that I can think of.
19139,1 the village where the minks were bred was quite small and the virus ran out of hosts before it spread due to dumb luck.
19140,"(or it spread slowly from village to village undetected and the lock down stopped that spread)

2 The virus was less infectious in early stages and got the critical mutation that enabled or accelerated human to human transmission in or near Wuhan."
19141,3 The virus only made the first jump from mink to human in Wuhan.
19142,4 The mink from Yunnan theory is wrong.
19143,I don’t mean in a private setting I mean in public spaces
19144,That really has no bearing.
19145,Legal doctrine says unless they were forced into that state without their consent they’re responsible for all actions under it.
19146,That's somewhat odd to me I would imagine that Pakistan would jump at the chance to blame covid woes on India
19147,I'll probably wear masks somewhat regularly for 2-3 months a year because we get bad wildfire smoke
19148,The CDC always plays it extra-cautious.
19149,"Unless you are particularly vulnerable or worried, you can follow Pfizer's schedule without issue."

Here's a clip (the original link is really long and idk where it starts so this is easier for me) https://youtu.be/JZDC_9JcDjs"
19164,"It's sad that in a lot of the world you can't get the vaccine even if you were willing to pay for it, and in fuckin Ohio you have to bribe people with a lottery to get it."
19165,[deleted]
19166,i didn't say anything about her being an idiot or not lol
19167,I'm anxious as hell to not have to wear a mask but I agree.
19168,Shouldn't be rushed.
19169,We aren't even at a majority vaccinated yet.
19170,"This is a weird question, but in the Pfizer vaccine trials it seems that they defined full immunity as only 7 days after the 2nd dose."
19171,"If that is true, why does the CDC make us wait 14?"
19172,And am I actually technically fully vaxxed 7 days after the 2nd dose?
19173,"Buddy, you are barely in the midst of your second wave."
19174,Not to mention drunk people actually don't have full control of their person like someone choosing to not get vaccinated does.
19175,I think you are correct about over 50% of the adult US population having one dose.
19176,However when you throw in the children (a lot who are not eligible) it’s less than 50% on a total population basis.
19177,[removed]
19178,Since we all split the hospital bills vaccinating as many as possible and reducing the amount of total hospital visits just makes financial sense for everyone.
19179,I find it hilarious that you are getting downvoted.
19180,You are right.
19181,The average persons understanding of probability/risk is batshit insane.
19182,You should take solace in the likelihood that the people who buy lottery tickets (aka [stupid tax](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/stupid_tax)) because “there’s a chance” are the same people downvoting you.
19183,Idk what happened in Taiwan but that cost is just fucked up.
19184,And all the excuses you gave are nonsense to me.
19185,"Test don’t need to be done by medical professional, and if you worry about test center to become a spread event, you probably should worry more that you have positive cases wandering around that are you cannot test out."
19186,I messaged my PCP doctor and she couldn't order it due to them not being recommended for some reason.
19187,I am going to ask my GI doctor too perhaps.
19188,"And yet the House pretty much doesn’t matter at all without fair representation in the Senate, as we’ve seen for a decade now."
19189,Thank you :)
19190,Pretty absurd hyperbolic comparison you’ve got there.. It’s more like when you walk into the grocery store and forgot your mask and they offer you a free one.
19191,"Either way though, both your absurd scenario and mine involve generosity, it’s a semantic issue but generous means showing a readiness to give more of something than is strictly necessary or expected."
19192,"Again—sharing vaccines is not altruistic, but it is generous."
19193,"No one is obligated to share them with other communities, nor are they expected to, so doing so fits the literal description of “generosity”."
19194,Is the Indian Government really trying to alter reality and claim this “Singapore” variant is to blame?
19195,Lol
19196,"The really scary part is in lieu of the new CDC guidelines, I fear WEARING a mask makes me look Republican and anti-vaxx."
19197,"I'm in the same boat as you and still wearing, generally."
19198,I think kids that are at least 12 years old of age do deserve some autonomy when it comes to vaccinations.
19199,Chipotle has lifted their mask mandate for vaccinated guests.
19200,"&gt; [We will continue to require our employees to wear masks; however, fully-vaccinated guests do not need to wear a mask inside of Chipotle restaurants, except where required by local regulations."

19203,Good distinction
19204,Sinovac is less effective than the vaccines we have available in USA.
19205,Lmao uhh no.
19206,"There is likely zero chance it was a ""lab leak"" you watch too much Netflix."
19207,Why do people ignore Occam's Razor?
19208,If Ebola didn't come from a lab leak why would some regular joe schmoe coronavirus need to?
19209,The problem is deforestation.
19210,"Encroach more wildlife, get exposed to more viruses."
19211,One mutation or so and they jump to humans.
19212,Always good to keep mask on.
19213,Vaccinated people can still get covid and infect others.
19214,One *potential* reason is that much of the population is vaccinated with Sinovac which has shown significantly reduced efficacy relative to many other vaccines in [at least one study](https://www.uchile.cl/noticias/174186/resultados-primer-estudio-de-efectividad-de-las-vacunas-en-chile) (as low as 3% after the first shot and 57% two weeks after the second).
19215,"What do you expect, this the CDC we are talking about."
19216,"They bungled masks from the very beginning, based on ""Science"", and totally not conserving supply or preventing panic."
19217,it is not right to punish ppl who HAVE been doing the right thing.
19218,What is the science on how long until you are at full potential protection (95% or so IIRC) after 2nd Pfizer?
19219,I had 5 weeks in-between 1st and 2nd dose if that's relevant.
19220,I ask because I have been dealing with some pretty rough OCD that has made life in this pandemic kinda hellish.
19221,"Like, not even going outside to take out the trash, haven't been out in months."
19222,"I got the second Pfizer dose last Wednesday and today I went to an individual apartment viewing, stayed double masked with FFP2 and OP mask the whole time."
19223,But the whole thing got me nervous especially because I saw people in the building not wearing masks.
19224,I'm not in a country where most people are vaccinated yet.
19225,I have been reading that after 1 week after 2nd Pfizer it is usually at 95% and even then it was already pretty high 21 days after the 1st dose.
19226,But it's hard for me to parse the many different studies and find out which information is correct since there seem to be different answers floating around.
19227,"That's good, I hope that remains the perception."
19228,I just saw a post recently of some Republicans doing a total flip-flop saying maybe they should start wearing masks now—!?
19229,"Still, realistically, if wearing a mask was too hard for them before, it will be too hard now."
19230,[removed]
19231,"Calling bullshit, especially on TX numbers."
19232,"Yeah, I also would like to know more about this from someone that knows whats going on, dont wanna say it's because Sinovac but it suprises me how 40% of Chile is fully vaccinated and there are still a high number of cases and deaths"
19233,Literally every state needs to do this.
19234,The fact that more aren't stealing the idea is baffling to me.
19235,agreed.
19236,"i got my vaccination, i wore my masks, and i stayed home."
19237,it's not fair to the ones doing the right thing.
19238,You can't win if you don't play.
19239,"Not more side effects, more people had side effects."
19240,"The side effects remain the same, they just occur more often."
19241,NJ is the most densely populated state in the country.
19242,One of the first hit areas and hardest hit areas in the country.
19243,Of course hes going to be more cautious.
19244,Its a smart move.
19245,Lets be done with this once and for all and do it right to the end instead of prematurely celebrating.
19246,Throwing on/taking off a mask takes seconds.
19247,The only people upset are mostly the people who baby raged over masks for a year straight.
19248,A lot of them will pretend they got vaccinated even if they didnt and thats whats slowing things down.
19249,The CDC used their statements thinking itd be dangling a carrot to give people an incentive to get vaccinated.
19250,Its pretty gullible of them to not know theres a chunk of the population who will pretend to be vaccinated when they arent.
19251,A lot of medical experts were puzzled by the CDC announcing this.
19252,The timing was poor.
19253,A lot of states just opened vaccines for everyone a month ago.
19254,You could have been there week 1 and you'd still be waiting on your second shot.
19255,"Plus teens, childret, pregnant women, people with certain health conditions cant get vaccinated yet."
19256,Theres still a large number of people who arent vaxxed.
19257,"Some of these people will get vaxxed soon, but could be at risk while antivax weirdos are breathing their pandemic everywhere."
19258,"Yes at risk people can wear a mask, but their mask by itself isnt 100% protection."
19259,Others around them being wearing masks or veing vaxxed will mitigate the risk more.
19260,"Dont tell me ""kids dont die from covid so who cares"" because long term health issues are a thing with covid."
19261,Since theres no easy way to tell who is vaccinated or not and the fact that theres a percentage of people who will lie about it means lets protect the vulnerable or give them a bit more time to get vaccinated.
19262,Lets get closer to herd immunity.
19263,You want to be mad at someone?
19264,Go get mad at the anti vaxxer weirdos.
19265,You want things normal?
19266,Start getting on the case of people on the fence and convince them to go get vaccinated.
19267,Not even half our country is fully vaxxed... Its like people are trying to fuck this up and it blows my mind.
19268,"Oh, and the CDC has been way off on things this entire pandemic."
19269,This pandemic really showed me how selfish and uncaring people are.
19270,Truly digusting.
19271,A very minor inconvenience that takes literally seconds can save lives.
19272,"Hopefully history remembers those of us who wore masks and got vaccinated, not just to protect ourselves, but to protect the more vulnerable."
19273,I hope you're right.
19274,Ohio is only at 42% first doses right now and I know a lot of the south is worse than that.
19275,Technically their quarantine period per CDC is two weeks after the last day of dad's isolation.
19276,"If you live with the person it's considered a new close contact every day until the infected person is done isolating, and so you have to start from the last exposure."
19277,It's some of both.
19278,Many countries' governments were vaccine hesitant because they were new vaccines and covid wasn't a problem among their population.
19279,"From what I've witnessed during the pandemic, every country gets their turn."
19280,Even those that started off ad darlings.
19281,It's a virus.
19282,No way to end it without vaccination.
19283,"&gt; I think a bunch of smaller ones would be better, focusing on areas with low vaccination rates."
19284,"Also give away cash, sports tickets- whatever it takes."
19285,I think they should do a free concert series.
19286,Get in with your card or get a shot.
19287,I bet it would get a lot of younger people.
19288,they had a shot setup at red rocks for a concert last Saturday and I think they vaccinated a 100 or so.
19289,"And there it is, because I think it's not the responsibility of vaccinated people to police unvaccinated people, kids must not matter to me."
19290,Thanks for proving the point I made in my initial post.
19291,[deleted]
19292,"This wasn't at all what I expected, but I guess it's the American Way."
19293,"I truly thought it would be a slow trickle, and masks would linger way beyond their broad spectrum usefulness."
19294,Just goes to show you can't predict anything.
19295,Good news overall.
19296,States need to implement incentives to get vaccinated like Ohio is doing.
19297,The higher the vaccination rate the faster Covid infections will plummet.
19298,"At least in my area, the people wearing masks are the ones being extra cautious."
19299,The ones that won’t get vaccinated weren’t wearing a mask to begin with
19300,Nature’s way of removing them from the gene 🧬 pool.
19301,"Don’t mask up, possibly die young."
19302,Yeah that segment has been pushed aside.
19303,"As a parent with an immunocompromised kid it's tough to see everyone going back to""normal"""
19304,"&gt;Masks are not political statements, don't turn them into one."
19305,Where have you been?
19306,Republicans already did that.
19307,That's not my problem.
19308,And as I said: I still wear mine.
19309,"I could definitely see a certain social stigma if you're wearing a mask and people believe you're unvaccinated, however."
19310,"They studied it extensively,  I wouldn't worry about it."
19311,There's nothing that would make it less safe by storing it like that.
19312,The worry is effectiveness because the mrna is so delicate and that's what they studied.
19313,This is the stupidest thing I've ever read.
19314,Not the mention it's a complete waste of taxpayer money.
19315,This country is just getting more corrupt as we speak.
19316,We must not be looking at the same thing.
19317,"https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/florida?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend

I see a huge spike in March (like every other state) and then a decline afterward."
19318,"What’s different is that for the past month, Florida’s daily death rates have been rising as much as they’ve been falling."
19319,That isn’t happening in the other states with high numbers; they’re all dropping pretty steadily.
19320,"At this rate, within a week we’re going to see days where fewer people die in California than in Florida."
19321,That’s really hard to explain.
19322,The last poll I saw indicated over 90% of adult Quebecers want to get vaccinated
19323,Except Anti Vaxxers and Covid-deniers are free to go maskless now.
19324,Not that I really care anymore since I’m fully vaccinated.
19325,They can risk getting sick between them.
19326,[deleted]
19327,"Can we just do this with flights, regardless of covid?"
19328,To not feel self conscious if my kid cries on a plane would be amazing!
19329,Ah yes I think you're right esp with that box.
19330,&gt; but I wouldn't be surprised if we see surges in some states that stay below 50% vaccinated.
19331,No state will stay below that level
19332,"Yep, did the same thing last Friday after Costco and Trader Joe’s lifted their mask mandate."
19333,I went to both stores and was one of only a couple that didn’t have mask.
19334,My gym on other hand has been maskless for probably over a month when our state lifted the mandate.
19335,I stopped wearing mine a few weeks ago when I hit my 2 weeks post vax
19336,"Before the new CDC Guidelines, I agree."
19337,"Now, however, if the CDC is saying if you're vaccinated you don't need to wear a mask—then the perception is that if you're wearing a mask, you must not have been vaccinated."
19338,I'm exaggerating my concern a bit for conversation; I still wear my mask.
19339,says the ambassador of idiocy.....
19340,TIL Canada actually has a lot fewer stupid people.
19341,Cities aren't the issue.

19350,We're never getting to 70%.
19351,Not with 45% of republican morons refusing to get vaccinated.
19352,It's time to let them get their immunity the old fashioned way.
19353,This works for the vaccinated and realistically accelerates the timeline to make things safer for the immunocompromised and others who legitimately can't get vaccinated.

19452,"Sure there are benefits, but I would trade my health once or twice a year for packed bars, concerts, sporting events any day"
19453,It depends.
19454,"In some states (for example Virginia), the state attorney general has come out and said that in his opinion, the law allows universities to legally require vaccination, even though it is still not fully FDA approved."
19455,"Different states have different laws, and it can be open to interpretation."
19456,&gt; They don't do the lottery to advertise the vaccines.
19457,They do.
19458,"They even have quotes saying so in the article:

&gt;**""Not only have we achieved our goal of increasing public awareness and interest,** but we have slowed what was a consistent decline, and in certain age groups we're seeing an increase again,"" state Health Director Stephanie McCloud said."
19459,"They also do it to convince fence sitters, but to say they don't do it as a form of advertising is just flat wrong."
19460,"Being aware of the signs of thrombosis is important for the 1 in a 1 million, but not much in the way of a likely occurrence."
19461,The confirmation bias is so slanted with antivaxxers that they see anything and everything as being caused by vaccines and not the *two packs of smokes and a bottle of Johnnie Walker*.
19462,This could and should be done federally!

19465,It's because people like that are more interested in insulting Southerners instead of actually tackling COVID.

19484,"Imo part of it is that we’re the youngest state in the nation, so it’s been available to younger people for a shorter time."

19489,I hope dropping mask mandates doesn't cause spikes.
19490,After over a year of following every guideline I'm fucking ready for this shit to be over!
19491,The head of the CDC specifically addressed this.
19492,"Everyone is talking about this ""honor system"" but the CDC made no mention of it."
19493,"The CDC's official statement on this is that if you are vaccinated then you are safe, and with the amount of people that are vaccinated or have some natural immunity to covid, uncontrollable community spread is unlikely."

19495,This Pfizer joint is a total Mary Sue
19496,Cowards!

19498,"&gt; I agree, that would be dramatic, I just don't think that is likely."
19499,"Okay, but the actual results of the survey of reality disagree with your opinion about reality."
19500,The end of the pandemic is a really great opportunity to change what you're doing.
19501,That's why so many fast food places can't hire anyone for such low wages anymore.
19502,I know several people who changed jobs due to their previous employer's lax stance on covid.
19503,Just because you aren't able to imagine someone doing that doesn't mean that it's not true.
19504,The survey results also back that up.
19505,Well I'm glad to hear there was no shitshow.

19520,It’s usually hard to say this but I’m happy to see Ohio succeed.
19521,Another option could be giving away scratch off cards with vaccines.
19522,That would bring so many people in.
19523,It's anyone who turns 36 before 1 June now.
19524,"If the pattern from a few weeks backs happens this time around too, it'll go down in two- or three- year jumps every couple of days."
19525,"Not the CDC, the WHO

I never mentioned the CDC."
19526,"Throughout the pandemic, the rise and fall of deaths has mirrored the rise and fall of cases, with a lag of about 3 weeks (though with mass vaccination of the elderly, we have seen the lagged CFR fall)."
19527,"Cases are down over 50% from their spring peak in mid April, so we should see deaths drop similarly."
19528,And we are already seeing the drop!
19529,By 2nd week of June we should be in the neighborhood of 350 deaths/day.
19530,All you have to do is sit in a chair for a second.
19531,People don't seem to understand this.
19532,These people MOST LIKELY ALREADY HAD COVID.
19533,"They weren't practicing proper mask wearing (if wearing at all), not social distancing and being apart of large gatherings for almost this entire pandemic."
19534,What we're seeing here is that the vaccines work AND the stupidity of these people in getting covid are basically pushing us toward herd immunity.
19535,Why people on reddit assume that there are millions of unmasked and unvaccinated people who haven't caught covid already is beyond me.
19536,"I agree in theory but have frankly no confidence in the vampires, literal pedos, and doofuses that would be appointed and empowered by this in practice."
19537,"The countries that have all done the best are more or less those that have been marginalized by the power players in the global community (Cuba, several African nations, and though Vietnam is large and has a big economy I doubt the west would follow their lead unfo)."
19538,"All of the most hegemonic countries have fucked up a key part or parts of stopping this, whether it was Chinas early secrecy, foot dragging in the west at the beginning, and repeated mismanagement and putting profits over public health at almost every step of the way"
19539,"I had similar, took temp and realized I had a fever (only 101 degrees, but I am a big baby lol so it felt worse)."
19540,"I also had a headache and threw up, after a day spent bundled up in bed I was fine though."
19541,The federal government never had any mandates.

19544,"Methodology hasn't changed for about a year, and that was only to introduce the same 28 day cut off that is the wider norm."
19545,I see the same comments in thread after thread demanding that grocery stores remove their masking rules.
19546,Do they not think that vulnerable people shop there?
19547,Are we supposed to pay more for delivered food options?
19548,Are we supposed to quit our jobs and become hermits with no income or healthcare as many folks on here seem to suggest?
19549,Not the first few anyhow...
19550,Can you imagine some poor retail wage slave being put in the position of demanding to see your vaccination document?
19551,"Also, the Feds never had any mandates."
19552,It’s always been state and local decisions.
19553,The guy you’re responding to is lost in a sea of misinformation he doesn’t even understand.
19554,There is a difference between a fragile ego and a fragile immune system.
19555,If you want to just live your life mask free fine.
19556,Enjoy that privilege others in society don’t have.
19557,"As a parent, this last year has made it very apparent how much my fellow citizens value my kids"
19558,Mine felt like shit too but you know what doesn't?
19559,Being 80% more protected against coronavirus so I'll be getting that shot the minute it's offered.
19560,"Yeah, other countries would be grateful just for the opportunity to not die."
19561,Not even a little bit.
19562,Actually no.
19563,There’s a reason sidewalks are now built with curb cuts and bathrooms have grab bars.
19564,Maybe it’s time you work on your empathy
19565,"I used to do drug testing for payment, so the second you add financial incentive people are willing to take risks."
19566,"Maybe not forever, but Mississippi and Alabama seem to have plateaued around 35% for now."
19567,The IT industry will be the biggest hypocrites OR the best adapter of the new normal.

Or we can see more employees getting better higher quality jobs from far away remote areas"
19569,No they fucking dont
19570,"Now, that’s the news I’ve been looking for."
19571,I never expected the honor system to work anyway.
19572,"Ohio's lottery seems to be a good idea at this point, appeal to people's greed."
19573,"I agree, that would be dramatic, I just don't think that is likely."
19574,"We posture our stances one way, but when it comes to making that final decision, I believe that a lot of people would rather receive a pay check and take whatever perceived risk, rather than face the unknown."
19575,The effect of the cap isn’t anywhere near as severe though.
19576,I think Texas Cali and New York all lose out on like 10.
19577,Just from experience I didn’t feel the shot either time.
19578,I just turned my head and it was over in the blink of an eye.
19579,You’ve got this!!
19580,Just think a moment or two of uncomfort leads to being vaccinated and getting to do all the fun stuff you’ve been missing out on.
19581,"Nah you're the only one having been played, having bought into the COVID conspiracy claims."
19582,I’d prefer if people were raising from the dead before lifting restrictions.
19583,&gt;What Nicholas Wade wrote is nonsense posted by someone who doesn’t know anything about research on coronaviruses.

19593,As a single working parent that has lived through an absolute year of hell because of this it’s just another reminder how little our society values us
19594,"One thing additional about the study- even if it was underpowered, I note that no additional studies have been done on B.1.351 and the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine."
19595,Well I did say 100k.
19596,That is still life changing money for a lot of people.
19597,It bumps up against private property rights too though
19598,Dude get some sunlight.
19599,Lol
19600,If you're immunocompromised or otherwise especially vulnerable you've had to live defensively before covid anyway.
19601,The lady had diabetes and high blood pressure.
19602,The guy had Leukemia.
19603,Both of those people are extreme Covid risks and were immunocompromised.
19604,"Those are outliers, and respectfully (RIP) those people should not have been engaging in risky behaviors even post vaccine."
19605,"If they were under the impression that they were protected by the vaccine, their doctors failed them."
19606,Canada's population is less than California iirc.
19607,"So it's really good news, but it's not logistically on the same scale as the US vaccination effort."
19608,"The sooner Canada is vaccinated, the sooner we can start sending more vaccines to other countries."
19609,So it's great news no matter what your perspective is.
19610,[removed]
19611,I mean high risk kids should have safe places to be kids without worrying about sick people strolling around with no mask.
19612,They should have little things to enjoy in life without risking their health.
19613,Before I was vaccinated I was literally surrounded by non masked people just trying to get my kid some Mac n cheese bites.
19614,But I guess we should just be happy without that too.
19615,I have no problem staying home I’m fortunate to be able to do so.
19616,But to act like keeping a kid at home for two years is NBD is crazy.
19617,"All of the actual studies I have seen suggested that the vaccines are similarly effective against the Indian variant, so I dont see why that would be true."
19618,"Actually, the science is that children are about as resistant to COVID as a vaccinated adult."
19619,Maybe don’t assume you understand this all better than people who have dedicated their lives to studying it.
19620,I feel like we should start keeping track of “number of vaccinated infections” and “number of vaccinated hospitalizations” in order to show just how effective the shots are to people who are skeptical about returning to normalcy.
19621,"For example, If we see that there are 35,000 cases and 5,000 hospitalizations on a given day, and that only 100 of those cases and 10 of those hospitalizations are in vaccinated folks, that will go a long way in telling people that once they’re fully vaccinated they can get back to their normal routines."
19622,"I don’t think that info is specified and published yet, but I can’t imagine it’s hard to do."
19623,Sounds like a plan bud
19624,Please - show me these comparisons.
19625,You're making things up.
19626,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536

Here's a study that looks at locations from Missouri to China to the US in general - all show that mask wearing is effective."
19627,"&gt; A study that examined changes in growth rates for infections in 15 states and the District of Columbia before and after mask mandates showed that rates were growing before the mandates were enacted and slowed significantly after, with greater benefit the longer the mandates had been in place."
19628,I'll wait for your facebook stats though - I'm really excited.
19629,Please educate me.
19630,Slightly fewer people in the Johnson &amp; Johnson pivotal clinical trial had reactogenicity (AKA short-term side effects) then the pivotal trials for Pfizer and moderna.
19631,Yes I meant people are adhering appropriately here and without much grumbling.
19632,"Hey guys, so i have the opportunity to get vaccinated tomorrow here in canada at a friends company that opened vaccination for family and friends."
19633,Rationally i want to get vaccinated as someone in STEM i know that i know nothing about vaccines and that i have to trust the scientist behind it.
19634,"However i am legit scared of needles and also other friends of mine have been posting conspiracies about the vaccine that i have been reading and a side of me is actually scared of the vaccine, i keep asking myself what are the long term side effects how can i be sure its safe."
19635,"I need some pep talk to go ahead and book my appointment for tomorrow

Thanks"
19636,"It's a bit cruel to experiment with the entire population, when many don't have a choice."
19637,How convenient that your individual stance on the topic happens to be the gold standard for morality and patriotism.
19638,I'll check back in a few months and LMK how those killer mutants are doing.
19639,Hamas puts military sites in the same building as civilian sites because otherwise they'd be blown up instantly.
19640,Israel might be using that as cover to blow up actual non-military facilities so take that as you will.
19641,"Or, many of us got the vaccine, don’t have kids, and don’t spend time with kids."
19642,What else can I do?
19643,I know many people who have gotten vaccinated for people like you.
19644,The vaccine is not just about me.
19645,It's about everyone.
19646,Whoever says I have an immune system I don't need a vaccine.
19647,"Great, your immune system cures you, but does it mean you don't spread the virus?"
19648,"No, then get the vaccine."
19649,Those numbers are promising.
19650,It shows 49% acceptance rate overall and much higher for older AAs.
19651,"But according to my in-laws in Texas, the AA acceptance rate is 20% and the MAIN reason why we have a huge resistance to vacs."
19652,Did Fox print these same numbers?
19653,"If so, I can share that because they'll never look at that liberal CNN stuff."
19654,"Only 2, I've been wearing 4 masks."
19655,3 over nose+mouth and 1 over the eyes
19656,I dont know if you are being serious.
19657,"People die daily, just like we take on risk daily."
19658,"Either you like it or not, you take a risk of dying soon as you get behind the wheel."
19659,We cant eliminate all risk.
19660,Their US shipments kicked in.
19661,They were also more than willing to use AstraZeneca even when EU paused it...with about a million AZ doses coming from US.
19662,Also keep in mind population differences.
19663,Canada is about 37m people in all.
19664,"There is nothing wrong with being scared of needles, but it’s just a thought."
19665,You can have another thought about it.
19666,"Acknowledge ‘I’m scared’ and then tell yourself something like, “but I am strong enough to protect myself and my community by getting vaccinated.”"
19667,"Agreed, I should have said the CDC wants to *appear* to be as scientifically accurate as possible."
19668,"Like when masks were not recommended because they didn't yet know for sure that covid was spreading in droplets, but they really just wanted to mitigate a worse PPE shortage."
19669,"You may have seen there was a [survey](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/epidemiologists-coronavirus-masks.html) of when epidemiologists thought we'd be able to go without masks indoors, and all thought that was at least several months away."
19670,"The vast majority said it would be another year, so the experts were suprised by the new CDC guidance."
19671,[deleted]
19672,&gt; If you're immunocompromised you're in a minority that the rest of the world shouldn't be forced to halt/restructure their lives for.

19681,Seriously.
19682,"There needs to be a national, mandatory PSA on how mRNA works."
19683,"Everyone keeps saying, ""I'll wait and see how it affects others,"" or, ""I'll wait for full approval, there could be side effects down the road that we don't know about,"" but the nature of mRNA doesn't allow for that to be possible."
19684,It's done and out of us within a day or two.
19685,"The fact that it's in hundreds of millions of people and shown to be remarkably effective and safe means, well, that it's safe."
19686,"People aren't going to be growing a third head in a year, it's just not possible with this technology."
19687,Maybe because it could have been engineered in a lab from dengue fever.
19688,Just a hypothesis.
19689,This is what I'm keeping an eye on.
19690,Just one dose of Moderna and Pfizer is still pretty damn good protection.
19691,Plus about 15% of the population has not been vaccinated but have antibodies.
19692,So 75% have some kind of protection.
19693,Also it's becoming increasingly evident that young children will mostly be fine even though they can't get vaccinated yet
19694,Paywall.
19695,Might be just a coincidence or the correlation might be caused by geographical/economic/social reasons.

19708,"Some of the points are legitimate (children and immunocomprimsed people are much safer in places with high vaccination rates), but the way people argue those points, there seems to be little to no mention of how we can actually get more people vaccinated to protect those demographics."
19709,"There's way too much focus on masks and not enough on using vaccinations to protect these demographics, as if people have forgotten how vaccine-induced herd immunity is achieved."
19710,Depends on how the HVAC system is set up.
19711,One sick person can still infect the entire room depending on air flow patterns and how often the air is recycled and not brought in fresh or extensively filtered.
19712,"It really depends on WHERE in Texas, though."
19713,"I live in Dallas, and mask compliance has been pretty amazing."
19714,"Head farther out into the burbs or the rural areas, not so much."
19715,"Even with the recent CDC announcement, I’m still seeing people mostly masked up in Dallas."
19716,The pandemic restrictions are all going to end in the next few months.
19717,"After that, unvaccinated people are on their own, but cases are so low now that they’re relatively safe anyway."
19718,"It’s incredibly unlikely at this point that we’ll see a vaccine-resistant variant, and that would be the only reason for reimposing restrictions."
19719,The data shows that it's both safe and fairly effective.
19720,And even that doesn't really matter.
19721,"When China says, ""Here's a metric butt-ton of vaccines."""
19722,"and the US says, ""Our vaccines are better but you can't have them."""
19723,It doesn't really give anyone the warm and fuzzies.
19724,How is 500 dying a day from this shit back to normal?
19725,If you truely believed that then you would lock your daughter up in your house and not let her leave.
19726,If you actually thought your daughter could die and you took her out anyway because people were wearing a thin piece of cotton over their mouths then I don't know what to say.
19727,Masks help but they're not the miracle solution that anyone who 'fears death' should think will protect them.
19728,"&gt; I’ve recently developed GAD in the past year, and anxiety is really weird in that a lot of the time, you don’t even realize you have it."
19729,I think this is the big thing that most people misunderstand about anxiety disorders.
19730,"You're not sitting there actively thinking ""omg I'm so worried about _________."""
19731,It's a much deeper and all-encompassing phenomenon that's driven primarily by your subconscious mind.
19732,It was a lie so people wouldnt rush out and buy all the masks.
19733,Excellent point
19734,"Oh for sure, the side effects can seriously suck for a few days, still, way better than getting covid and the damage that comes with it."
19735,"I live in rural TX, well the exurban end of my mostly rural county, but I'm definitely not in a city or suburb."
19736,And in my 7 county region (mostly rural and small towns) things were completely different than in the big cities and their adjoining suburbs.
19737,"Which would have been our problem alone, had people here not traveled into more populated areas, and people from more populated areas not traveled here."
19738,Some people simply won’t get vaccinated until months after they recover from catching Covid if ever and they aren’t necessarily antivaxx they just think they paid their dues and don’t see the need.
19739,Me personally I would get it even if I had Covid.
19740,You won't have to wear them for much longer depending on where you live.
19741,I just don't want people to hate on those who choose to continue wearing a mask.

19762,I doubt that.
19763,It's just that they don't yet know when exactly deliveries are coming but EU and J&amp;J recently said they are still planning to deliver the ordered 55M doses to EU in Q2.

19765,Yes of course but there are also ppl that can't get vaccinated.
19766,So we should still care about the general public getting vaccinated.
19767,Herd immunity is the only thing some ppl have
19768,"&gt;The easiest way to explain public health is that it deals with health from the perspective of populations, not individuals."

19770,"Right so if your pediatrician says that your child is healthy and young and therefore has an extremely low risk of a serious COVID infection, you can take that advice because it's within their expertise."
19771,"Whether we call it clusters or spikes, I’ll be straight up shocked if we don’t see a significant jump in numbers over the next month."
19772,(Hope to be shocked.)
19773,I went to Publix the day the mask requirement was dropped for vaccinated people (in Florida ugh) and there were way more people without a mask than the percentage of people vaccinated in our state.
19774,"(Until now the naked face was pretty rare, maybe 2-3 per outing.)"
19775,Its all honor system based and there are guaranteed to be a lot of liars who were begrudgingly complying with mask rules who will take this opportunity to lie about being vaccinated and toss the mask.
19776,It will be interesting to see how many employees of these chains who claim to be vaccinated catch COVID-19 in the coming weeks.
19777,"He’s actually correct, we specifically ask patients who are getting the vaccine if they have had antibody treatments in the last 90 days."
19778,You would only receive it if you’ve had a severe case of covid and are admitted into a hospital.

19780,Look at the whole picture is Seychelles.
19781,They are using mostly the Chinese made vaccine and although their cases are high they did open their borders to all international travelers AND yes case counts are high but deaths and serious illness are not.
19782,wipe that brown stain off your nose.
19783,Several other countries have total numbers that are close to as bad as the US.
19784,There are also a few countries that have worse per capita infection rates.
19785,"Easy there killer, I didn't downvote you."
19786,"I was legitimately asking, I've never heard of something like this for the non-vaxxed"
19787,There is not enough data yet to make that determination.
19788,Early data suggest some medications are worse than others for vaccine effectiveness.
19789,I have Crohn's Disease and also go to top research institution for IBD.
19790,You may be right.
19791,In that case I fully understand.
19792,Otherwise my point stands.
19793,Nahhhh
19794,That’s reassuring.
19795,The CDC did tell me the Johnson and Johnson has had a case of GBS.
19796,MRNA seems the way to go if I do get it.
19797,"This is pretty smart because the same people that don't want the vaccine, are also probably the same people super into the Lottery."

19800,One month ago I (in United States) was talking to my brother in Canada how their government didn't negotiate enough vaccines so their vaccination is lagging.
19801,"Now Canada has same %age of population vaccinated as the US, with no sign of a slump like we have."
19802,Its amazing what a country with low vaccine hesitancy can do in a short period of time when they finally get into it.
19803,the current gov try to alter every reality
19804,What if you *can't* be vaccinated but still don't wanna *die* just because some jackass lied about being vaccinated and isn't wearing a mask whilst spreading the disease everywhere around them?
19805,"What if you *want* to vaccinate, but weren't able to yet?"
19806,"Just you wearing the mask isn't all that effective (as has been established earlier in the pandemic), *all* people should be forced to wear a mask until they can *prove* that they have been vaccinated."
19807,"If you don't want to ""disclose medical information at target"" then fucking wear a mask."
19808,"Well, you aren’t wrong."
19809,"So either this summer is when this pandemic is done for at least in first world countries, or anti vaxxers and anti maskers win and we are fucked for longer?"
19810,"Minute Maid park, I went there for the Royal Rumble in January 2020 and caught COVID."
19811,The concourse area where you travel through to get to seats is so tight and with thousands of people you are literally like sardines.
19812,"I haven't been to the new Rangers stadium, but if its anything like the old one, it has wide open conncourses which are open to air."
19813,"You definitely feel more like you're outdoors the entire time, I would be hesitant to go to Minute Maid even with the roof open because of the concourse right now, but I would not be as worried to be at the old rangers stadium for that reason."
19814,Was it your pcp or neurologist who said no?
19815,Do you have other doctors you could discuss it with?
19816,[deleted]
19817,I think you're misunderstanding them.
19818,They're saying students wanted to wait until after finals so side effects don't cause them to miss their exams.
19819,"For example, my side effects included: nausea, vomiting, fever, horrible back pain, fatigue, chills, and other aches/pains."
19820,I literally couldn't get out of bed for 24 hours and didn't feel great even after that.
19821,If I was still a student I absolutely wouldn't want to get my dose if I have exams to be at.
19822,"The first covid idiot would not put on a mask because they didn't care about the risk to others, as long as they were likely to be safe."
19823,"The new covid ""idiot"" won't take off a mask because, even though they're likely to be safe personally, they want to take an extra step to both protect others (it's not 100% that you can't infect others) and to continue to foster an environment where protecting others is supported, until vaccines are more widespread."
19824,"Remember, about 50 million people still aren't eligible, and another 17 million just became eligible last week, and while neither of those groups are likely to get very sick, they certainly can pass it to those who are legitimately unable to take the vaccine for various reasons."
19825,Wearing the mask a while longer is a small price to pay until we've minimized the risk for those most at risk.
19826,"But yeah, that was a really nice equivalence on your part."
19827,It’s almost like people use different masks too.
19828,The blame game wheel just keeps spinning lol.
19829,Interesting BBC are saying actually it’s 36.
19830,30 in garden and 6 six indoors at the same time is possible as long as they don’t mix.

19832,Also they have been choosing to believe the dumbest sh!t.
19833,All year echochambering themselves with any source downplaying the seriousness of Covid now they are echochambering themselves with any source amplifying anything negative about the vaccine.
19834,In a network my family belongs to just this week 3 separate families all rural in different parts of the state of PA all got Covid.
19835,2 of the couples are feeling quite sick.
19836,With the availability they all could have been vaccinated by now.
19837,Yeah that’s what the CDC told me.
19838,I wish there was more data on autoimmune patients and how they handled it.
19839,"Almost surprising the mentioned sub hasn't got in trouble, because it appears to be all about name-calling."
19840,I’ve heard a lot stories also but haven’t been able to verify most of them.
19841,"Breakthrough cases are to be expected though; remember, the testing had been how effective it is against severe symptoms and death."
19842,Those numbers are still amazingly good.
19843,"I’ve recently developed GAD in the past year, and anxiety is really weird in that a lot of the time, you don’t even realize you have it."
19844,"Your brain is really good at rationalizing things, so when you’re feeling overly anxious you blame it on some upcoming deadline rather than a chemical imbalance in your brain."
19845,"Additionally, medical anxiety is extremely common, and I know someone who is quite liberal but due to debilitating medical anxiety refuses to get the vaccine."
19846,Sounds kind of similar to your family members
19847,Allergies to vaccine components is one reason why.
19848,Having received a vaccine to a different disease in the last couple weeks is a short-term reason to delay vaccination (at least it was as of April when I received my second dose).
19849,Another is being under 12 years old.
19850,"There are not many reasons, but they do exist and I do not begrudge anyone who is unvaccinated at the advice of their doctor."
19851,"Because you post this same story all the time and your anecdote, while unfortunate, is still an extreme outlier."
19852,"Everyone knows breakthrough cases occur, and they’re also extremely rare, so stop acting like they aren’t."
19853,Have another downvote.

19855,We pretty much have.
19856,I appreciate people like you
19857,The SA variant is irrelevant.
19858,"It's hasn't managed to grow significantly in the UK against the UK variant, and given the more transmissible Indian variant will be the new global dominant variant, it will have even less chance to grow."
19859,Same with PPE stockpiles.
19860,How about we work on that gradually right now instead of using trash bags as haz mat suits on week 2 of the next pandemic.
19861,"Only the biggest brains were allowed to work on this ""study""."
19862,Is their next project to figure out if the sun rises in the east?
19863,Yep and Sheetz too.
19864,It also really depends on the area and if they even care to enforce it.
19865,[removed]
19866,&gt; Are we really getting to the point where we are banning photos that say I trust my immune system to fight covid?
19867,Can we agree that Covid is bad?
19868,"Lets start there, because if we can't than this post is moot, but lets say we agree."
19869,Covid is bad.
19870,"So lets also say for arguments sake your immune system is stellar, lets say you don't want the vaccine, lets imagine you got Covid, and it barely effected you."
19871,Lets say you're a Covid survivor.
19872,Now do you think there is a slight chance you may have exposed someone else to Covid while you were sick?
19873,A loved one?
19874,A stranger?
19875,What if that person's immune system is terrible?
19876,What if that person died?
19877,"Or what if they didn't die, but they went to a party and spread Covid to tens of other people?"
19878,"Now I know, this is a lot of assumptions, but what I'm getting at is Covid can be spread incredibly easily, and it effects everyone differently."
19879,"If you don't want to get the shot, its your choice, personally I think its a selfish choice, but its your choice."
19880,But getting the vaccine is harmless for most and helps everyone equally not.
19881,get.
19882,covid.
19883,which I'm hoping we can agree is a good thing.
19884,"So what I'm getting at is people who go online and spread the word that not only are they not going to get vaccinated, but they are proud of not getting vaccinated, it inspires others to not get vaccinated, which means Covid is going to stick around and kill more people, which again, I'm making a wild assumption, but I assuming helping people live is a good thing."
19885,"So yes, I think we are getting to the point where we are banning photos that say I trust my immune system, because its not about that....... Its about protecting OTHERS who may have weak immune systems, its about protecting others who can't get the vaccine its about not being selfish and doing what's best for humanity."
19886,"The 60% came from NPR, who used vaccine eligibility to calculate it."

19940,I don't think so.
19941,Most of the recent polling floating around has the vaccine refusal rate at like 20-25%.
19942,"I do think we will almost certainly hit Biden's 70% of adults goal at some point this summer, but it's hard to see how we can enter the fall at much higher than 75ish% of the eligible population or ~65% of the total with so many people dead set on not getting a vaccine."
19943,"That said, it may not matter since total protection including natural immunity would probably be 75-80% with 65% vaccinated."
19944,It's not a felony to have a fake ID buying alcohol.
19945,Surely you understand if something is a federal charge it would require much more than a store clerk checking it briefly right?

19947,Why are you acting like I said masks are better than vaccines?
19948,I said nothing of the sort.
19949,Of course vaccines are way better than masks.
19950,I don't even understand why you think I said something differently.
19951,I said your daughter is at low risk if she's wearing a mask in public if she's not there for an extended period of time (which is why I specifically said you shouldn't go to a restaurant.)
19952,"So yeah, go ahead and show me the data you're following that says short periods of time masked up in public is still risky."
19953,Because that is what I was saying.
19954,We inconvenience ourselves for a minority of people all the time.
19955,Handicapped spaces?
19956,It’s called being in a decent society.
19957,So not 60% of the US.
19958,60% of eligible Americans right?
19959,This is fantastic news and I imagine the 7 day average will continue to fall over the next couple days as well given that the cases are at the lowest they’ve been since the early days of the pandemic and we just started vaccinating the 12-15 year olds.
19960,Unfortunately the number of vaccines given in the US has continued to drop so it looks like vaccine hesitancy really is going to be a big issue but that shouldn’t stop us from reopening and dropping most mask mandates.

19980,I think your concerns are beyond rationality at this point.
19981,If you and someone else are both vaccinated the risk to the two of you is virtually zero.

20048,Store workers do the same thing with alcohol every day.
20049,It's not hard.
20050,It's not unfair.
20051,No one complains.
20052,"What data would you like, I'll gladly show you studied showing vaccines are better protection than masks."
20053,"I hope that as vaccination efforts in the US are needed less and less over the coming months we can shift that to the most needed areas overseas like India, Brazil, etc."
20054,"If the USA had adopted this strategy, cases would already be so much lower and a lot of lives would have been saved."
20055,Now we know for the next pandemic
20056,"&gt; Our ""fully vaccinated"" population will skyrocket in two months

Doubt it."
20057,"First doses have been going down for weeks, no reason to think they will skyrocket a month from now (which would be in time for fully vaccinated two months from now)."
20058,"We got a small bounce up among the 12-15 year olds rushing out to get it, but that's not likely to last two long and then they'll start trickling in."
20059,"&gt;people under 30 have only been eligible in some states for a month or so

And after the first wave, they've been trickling in."
20060,No reason to expect rates to increase substantially.
20061,The expectation of required vaccines is already affecting many people's decisions.
20062,"Full authorization and then vaccine requirements won't cause a skyrocket, workplaces and schools are likely to implement those restrictions slowly."
20063,"So Hospital A a day after full approval, Hospital B, a week later, etc."
20064,"Charts: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends  Sort by ""People receiving Dose 1""

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends  Switch to sorting by age and you can see the under 30s are just trickling in at this point."
20065,[removed]
20066,"It really depending on who is providing the data’s, when you have a vaccine that range from 20-90% efficient reported by different governing body of the each countries, their study or data is not really valid in my book."
20067,"3-6% different in efficient is norm, but when you have that wide of a range ew."
20068,"I was curious so I looked and far northern states like Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin didn’t really have the summer spike that Arizona and Florida had."
20069,Those spikes peaked in mid-late July which roughly corresponds with the hottest point of summer.
20070,(The coverage of that “2nd wave” spike may have caused people to be more careful which is why it dips down pretty quickly even though September and July are almost the same temperature on average.)
20071,So there may be some validity to that theory.
20072,"Winter I think will still see an increase in cases since even in warm climates, people spend the holidays inside sharing meals, opening gifts, etc."
20073,[removed]
20074,who cares how small the % of winning would be.
20075,getting a vaccination shot is free.
20076,there is no downside from the player perspective and all profit if they somehow miraculously win.
20077,"I haven’t called anyone to task, including the US,  I’m pointing out that your statement is at best partially correct and somewhat misleading."
20078,There’s also a difference between keeping your own supply and buying out the global supply.
20079,Brazil hasn’t even done the former.
20080,And there’s the matter of refusing to make patent exceptions even in the face of a global pandemic.
20081,"And here, we see a commenter who still doesn't understand exponential growth after a year of a pandemic."
20082,"Except for the 1000 fully vaccinated people who've been hospitalized, and the 200+ people who've died."
20083,"Given that it's only been a couple months since we even had enough fully vaccinated people to start counting, that number is going to rise."
20084,A wild strawman appeared!
20085,"You do know why we don't require passports for other vaccine-preventable diseases, right?"
20086,It's because we do.
20087,In a different way.
20088,Kids are required to be vaccinated for many diseases to go to school.
20089,"Obviously, that doesn't work when you have to introduce a new vaccine into the adult population, so you have to go about it differently."
20090,MA has totally surpassed my expectations.
20091,[removed]
20092,They will have their evidence.
20093,"Every vaccinated person who gets cancer, suffers infertility, gets hit by a bus will be their evidence and no amount of explaining statistics will convince them otherwise."
20094,A neighbor was posting on social media about her friend who got diagnosed with stage 4 breadt cancer the week after vaccination.
20095,Because stage 4 beeast cancer grows in a week.
20096,Look up Uttar Pradesh's population density and GDP per capita
20097,So is very public place supposed to have a bouncer that checks everyone’s vaccine card before they come in?
20098,[removed]
20099,"So your solution is to have store workers, many of whom are teens and elderly, be the ones who check vaccine cards and determine the validity of a vaccination card?"
20100,Just think about how unfair that is to those people.
20101,I agree people with forgeries should be prosecuted but who will be making that call?
20102,Go ahead and lay out your plan.
20103,"Lastly, go ahead and show me the data that you have seen to indicate your daughter is in danger while wearing a mask."
20104,"Seriously, you want to say I'm wrong, prove it."
20105,You literally know nothing about me and what I know so go ahead and prove me wrong here.
20106,But remember: Feelings don't equal facts and the plural of anecdote is not data.
20107,I'll wait.
20108,Honestly: unvaccinated people and people who weren't wearing masks shouldn't count in the death totals anymore.
20109,Just call them suicides and put an asterisk next to their names.
20110,This will be an important distinction in the future as we look to the long term economic costs and compensation funds for survivors benefits.
20111,The CDC said unvaccinated people should continue to wear masks.
20112,You’re making it seem like they don’t consider them at risk.
20113,"They even go so far as to require EVERYONE to mask up in mass transit, hospitals, schools, and prisons."
20114,And how’s this sub full of such people when really at best 0.1% of the population falls into this bucket?
20115,The US won’t see another wave.
20116,The chances of hospitals being overwhelmed is close to 0 even if we opened up 100% today.
20117,"I’ve made tremendous sacrifices over the last year, including having to lose my service industry job, not seeing my family or friends, and living alone unable to date for over 16 months now."
20118,"Cases are 1/10th of what they were during the peak, and might even get to a 1/100th in a month."
20119,"And remember, most of the vulnerable are already protected."
20120,It’s now up to individuals to make their own individual risk assessments like responsible adults.
20121,"If you’re immunocompromised, find solace in the fact that cases will be &lt; 3k/day in a month."
20122,"Meanwhile, stock up on N-95s (they are cheap these days) or just stay at home and get your groceries delivered."
20123,"I’ve been doing that for 16 months ffs, you can do it for a month if your life depends on it."
20124,[removed]
20125,I'm not sure why you're reading my reply as a negative or snarky comment?
20126,I was just asking why you were checking on the weather on facebook since there are actual weather sites you can check.
20127,Then you don't need facebook at all.
20128,There was no snarky or rude or mean comment implied by my reply.
20129,"Sorry if it came across that way, but that's not how it is at all."
20130,I am actually curious as to why.
20131,not Florida.
20132,lol
20133,[removed]
20134,I presume you got all your shots as a kid and boosters as an adult?
20135,Ever had any long term side effects?
20136,"Probably not, cause that’s not really a thing with vaccines."
20137,Hundreds of millions have gotten the various COVID vaccines starting with folks in trials middle of last year.
20138,They’re doing ok!
20139,You were flat out wrong.
20140,You were completely incorrect about the Rt as well as incorrect about the other metrics.
20141,Nothing pedantic about it.
20142,"You're happy with where we are and where we're going and that's fine, but you're glossing over how that happened and spreading misinformation in the process and dismissing the risks that were involved in the decisions that got us to this point."
20143,"I know, but still it doesn’t inconvenience me and it removes any doubts"
20144,"Every other pandemic has come from animals, you have a huge hurdle to overcome, a huge burden of proof, if you want to say that ""this time is different""."
20145,"Nah, give it a year or two and however is in opposition will scream about money being wasted on that stuff and demand it being canceled."
20146,Over here in germany they now try to stick it on merkel that last year an order for a few million worth on PPE went out that was bad quality and had to be junked.
20147,As if that drop in the bucket made any difference and there had been lots of choice in suppliers back then...

20157,I'm guessing that will be my 2nd dose in that shipment.
20158,It's been a long wait since March.
20159,We have some co-workers in india that are able to do WFH.
20160,"Lots of good people there, hopefully some vaccines and supplies are coming."
20161,Lots of countries have a vested interest in what happens in india that should light some fires under world leaders/corporations.
20162,This blew me away too.
20163,Hand soap shortages?
20164,What the hell were all these people doing before?
20165,"My usage of hand soap has increased a tad perhaps, but not a supply-chain-damaging amount."
20166,"I \*hope\* it was just hoarders ruining it for everyone, like the toilet paper mess."
20167,Makes me feel better.
20168,"They’ve got balls, unlike Singaporean ministers that’s for sure."
20169,Many things can lead to an increase in excess deaths.
20170,The reduction in cancer screenings and regular health checkups likely had a rather significant impact.
20171,Some are estimating 10% or so increase in cancer deaths.
20172,"He personally had little, if not nothing, to do with the vaccine development, and everything to do with the current hesitancy to take it."
20173,"People in my own family are, like, ""India's *per capita* covid deaths aren't in the top 100 in the world"" and me tryna convince them that the official count is probably a (**small**) fraction of the real numbers..."
20174,I've heard this before and it nicely fits the vaccine-avoidance pattern.
20175,Too many people use religion as an excuse to keep doing whatever they want and try to ignore responsibility.
20176,Clearwater/Tampa and masks aren't popular.
20177,So it's not just a rural problem.
20178,Vaccine passports and federal charges for forging government documents would be an excellent solution then.
20179,It seems like lots of people are downvoting you.
20180,And you don't seem to know much about science.
20181,"Well, there are a lot of limitations here."
20182,The small number of patients (25) in the study is one.
20183,"The other, more serious in my opinion, is that the effectiveness of the vaccine *was* reduced if not eliminated."
20184,"As the article says, 

&gt;The team’s data show that antibodies generated by vaccination are seven times less effective at blocking B.1.617.1 than at neutralizing the coronavirus strain that circulated early in the pandemic."
20185,But antibodies from all 25 vaccinated people were able to neutralize B.1.617.1 to some extent.
20186,"One can only hope that the ""some extent"" is still enough or that the present vaccines can be 'tweaked' as spokespeople keep saying."
20187,"It looks like the link shared is behind a paywall, but this study  in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal (CID) found that while symptoms for COVID were worse for those who had had dengue fever, mortality was actually lower for them."
20188,This leads to the theory that possibly dengue fever antibodies provide some protection against Covid19.

20190,"&gt; Some of the antivaxxers are now terrified of the vaccinated people ""shedding viral particles"" on them so they're going to be wearing masks."
20191,"If any anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers want to stay the hell away from my family and me so they don't catch our particles, I'm all for it."
20192,"That includes my aunt and uncle and their asshole kids with their ""I have a medical condition so I don't have to wear a mask"" cards."
20193,I don't care if I ever see them again.
20194,[removed]
20195,fair enough!

20198,"It's not 70% in my state either, I was just using that number as an example."
20199,"It just dropped because of adding in the 12-15 year olds to the ""eligible"" category here in our county."
20200,We were at around 60 before that.
20201,Except they were.
20202,The pediatrician was using population-level stats on efficacy vs. Covid.
20203,"Incorrectly, btw."
20204,And the reason for the incirrect interpretation was because a pediatrician is not an expert in such things.
20205,I definitely think a 15 year old should be able to choose these things.
20206,It's weird that they cant.
20207,Are those cards even being accepted as proof of vaccination anywhere?
20208,&gt;  remember when Canadians were keying american cars that were in Canada.
20209,Quite the strawman.
20210,Awesome!
20211,"I could not find an open appointment until yesterday, so expect more good news."
20212,A lot of parents couldn't get it the first few days.
20213,I'm really hoping enough vaccimate that masks outdoors at summer camp aren't required.
20214,"My argument is that it won't be temporary, there's just no way we'll get our rights back as things look now."
20215,Or when do you think free travel in the EU will be a thing again?
20216,"Two weeks lockdown was temporary, one year is not and it's not like restrictions look like they are dropping this year either."
20217,"Perhaps your definition of ""temporary"" is ten years."
20218,Because it’s ridiculous.
20219,The CDC said fully vaccinated don’t have to wear masks in most settings.
20220,Let’s not pick and choose when we decide to follow CDC guidance.
20221,Why do you bother?
20222,"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA210330

They're a little vague and just say to report it to the appropriate state agency."
20223,I assume that would be police or maybe county health agency.
20224,Thanks!
20225,"I’ve actually seen two friends and had a barbecue with all my neighbors, I’m seeing my best friend again Thursday and my support worker and I are going to an outdoor flea market next month."
20226,I was just concerned I was doing the wrong thing hanging out with people.
20227,"My mom is still very very paranoid of covid despite being fully vaccinated, she still wears gloves when touching objects like mail and wears gloves in establishments."
20228,She also tells me there’s still a high chance of getting the virus even at this point.
20229,She even prevented me from going to a job interview for that reason.
20230,I have been trying to work on having less contact with her.
20231,It’s not easy.
20232,Over time she may loosen her fear.
20233,I don't have access to my entire source list at the moment but the below study echoes several other studies I've read.
20234,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852

It basically depends on what medication you were prescribed and in which amount."
20235,I am on Remicade and Methotrexate at fairly high dose for severe disease comparable to those transplant patients.
20236,Steroids like Prednisone have been shown to have the worst impact on vaccine effectiveness but antimetabolites like Methotrexate are bad too.
20237,Anti-TNF biologics like Remicade or Humira can have some impact too apparently but my GI told me it was fine.
20238,My GI didn't disclose the impacts of the Methotrexate to me until it was too late and I am rather upset with him.
20239,YUP.
20240,I’m just saying Trump supported vaccines and what he did to get jabs in people’s arms in absurdly fast time shouldn’t be disregarded.
20241,I see the satire now.
20242,All good.
20243,Huh?
20244,"This would allow you to *drive* into the US, something you could not do before."
20245,Because the CDC is issuing guidelines and it's left up to businesses to decide if they want to follow those or not.
20246,The White House only has a mask mandate for public transportation and that ends in September.
20247,"Are 45% of Americans also over the age of 75 with, and I quote, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, high blood pressure and mild dementia?"
20248,Outlier.
20249,I think the mask mandate doesn't matter on the honor system.
20250,The fact is enough people have been vaccinated that spread has become exponentially harder.
20251,"It's not about the fact that everyone needs to be vaccinated, it's the fact that we need enough people vaccinated so that the virus can't spread nearly as easily."
20252,It will eventually die out.
20253,So I have a question for all those who think long-COVID is just anxiety.
20254,"Does anxiety cause chronic ear infections, chronic pink eye, tinnitus, foot numbness and a sun burnt feeling on your skin even when you are hardly anxious?"
20255,I am genuinely curious because anxiety has never caused those things before and yet I suffered them for a long time after having COVID in March 2020.
20256,"Going to a restaurant, wearing one to your table, then taking it off to eat, and putting it back on to leave your table."
20257,"Yeah, that's why I'd get it."
20258,"Oh yeah I heard about a 96 year old who died to covid after being vaccinated, poor guy"
20259,"The argument with smoking is you affect the health of those around you, especially the staff that gets exposed all the time."
20260,Doesn't happen with alcohol.
20261,[deleted]
20262,Pick up orders have been options for people even before the pandemic.
20263,This thread is talking about having a safe option inside stores for those who are not vaccinated or immune compromised.
20264,"You don’t need a mask after getting vaccinated since you can’t spread it, you’re getting crazy looks from vaccinated people because your cautious behavior is not making things more safe or dangerous..it’s completely pointless, but to each their own"
20265,"As a resident of NJ, I wish my governor would Follow the Science and Trust the Experts."
20266,Yes.
20267,Because we were giving over 1M doses a day in the very beginning of distribution.
20268,Every vaccine dose that was being manufactured was being quickly injected into someone’s arm.
20269,Biden barely tweaked the distribution system.
20270,It’s operating as designed and intended from the start.
20271,The only issue is that the Biden admin is causing great vaccine hesitancy through ridiculous policies like telling fully vaccinated people they still have to mask and can’t congregate for holidays.
20272,They’ve only recently changed their stance after seeing how much impact they are causing.
20273,They're not banning photos.
20274,They are just not hosting the frames as an option offered by Facebook.
20275,You can still edit your photos in your photo editing software to include a frame that says something dumb.
20276,Hospitals aren’t always the issue - county or state offices may not update
20277,"This was more of a concern of a false positive on the rapid test, since that's the only one that has shown up positive."
20278,I'm just trying to figure out the window that you could still show positive after symptoms have cleared.
20279,"I see info on still testing positive months later, but not finding anything so far about testing negative that quickly (meaning before the 10 day quarantine window has passed)."
20280,"No, the 3/5 Compromise got decided on for the House of Representatives before anyone even raised the idea of an electoral college."
20281,"Exactly, there are states in the US who haven't worn them the entire time."
20282,Spoke to some people on the plane from Nebraska and they said it was the first time they had to deal with masks aside from going to a clinic there.
20283,"Meanwhile my state had strict mask mandates, everyone followed them, and nothing changed."
20284,I don't understand why some people are so hard up over people still wanting to wear masks or businesses taking a cautious approach for the time being.
20285,"Personally I'm don't think fully vaccinated people should have to wear one anymore, but if we still have to in certain situations big deal, I'll slap on a mask when required and that's that."
20286,"And if someone fully vaccinated feels safer and more comfortable masking up it doesn't affect anyone else's life in any way, shape, or form."
20287,Some people have way too much time on their hands.

20290,&gt;people who are fully vaccinated are getting Covid “all the time”.

20311,Except the CDC and the WHO are always on the same page when it comes to recommendations.
20312,Why would the CDC stick with those recommendations if they are there to help China?
20313,Wouldn't a more plausible reason be that that's what the consensus medical advice globally was at the time?
20314,"It's hard to say an organization is pro-China, and then ignore the evidence of the world's most powerful national health organization which is being run by an Anti-Chinese gov't (at the time), being ok following said pro-China organization's lead."
20315,Probably even $100.
20316,"Sure some well-off people wouldn't, but you'd wipe away a TON of people."
20317,"Even $25, honestly."
20318,I'd say for the government to just put out a public health memo saying masks are strongly recommended for the first few weeks of January.
20319,"Some people will wear them, and the flu season will hopefully be a little less severe."
20320,"From there, it might be more widely adopted each flu season if there's noticeable change in the severity."
20321,It's all connected.
20322,The 3/5ths compromise doesn't exist without the electoral college.
20323,The cdc did not call for universal unmasking.
20324,They punted it to local leaders.
20325,But they did explicitly say unvaccinated need to be masked.
20326,How do you propose we ensure their recommendation is followed?

20340,"And the simple fact is that we're gonna reach something past herd immunity soon, via all the people to take it seriously."
20341,"That's what many would say about lockdowns, which had never been attempted before 2020."
20342,My man is not looking healthy
20343,Nothing wrong with changing your opinion after more data comes out.
20344,Hell I was all for masks for a few months when this all started last year.
20345,Then I started noticing things that didn't seem scientific at all.
20346,"Wearing them outside seemed like a waste of time from the start for example, science has proven that to be the case."
20347,Realized it was more about theater and making people feel safe than anything.
20348,Here's the thing about being patient with one another.
20349,I've been patient for over a year now.
20350,"I waited for the vaccine, got it, and even fully vaccinated for a month now."
20351,I'm simply done with the mask theater.
20352,It’s also a good reminder that this pandemic has cost us a LOT more than $1M.
20353,If $1M gets us even a small step towards herd immunity that is an incredible return on investment.

20358,Trump has been massively supportive of vaccines form the get-go.
20359,When they paused administration of J&amp;J he (rightfully) called them stupid for creating vaccine hesitancy.
20360,"Operation warp speed was massively important, even though Democrats try and belittle it."
20361,Trump’s full fledged support of vaccines when experts were unsure had this nation administering millions of vaccines a day before his term was even up.
20362,Him leaving it to the states (the correct method that Biden continues) allowed us to get by far the most vaccinations a day amongst nations.
20363,Covid denier here.
20364,You’re busted!
20365,By claiming “People aren't going to be growing a third head in a year” you just admitted that a second head WILL grow within a year!!
20366,"And that a third head WILL grow, in a few years."
20367,I knew it!!
20368,/sarcasm
20369,I for one welcome our Canadian friends back!
20370,And don't worry there's plenty of vaccine to go around.

20375,"It already has been here, transitioning from one medical job to another and I have to provide proof of COVID vaccination or be willing to get it from my new employer."
20376,They will definitely get nature’s vaccine then.
20377,CDC said mask requirements wasn’t up to them.
20378,But they did say the unvaccinated needed to mask up.
20379,How do you propose businesses and local govt leaders ensure they follow that advice?
20380,"I also can't be considered an expert or even accurate in my view of things from the outside, but I probably talk to 10 to 20 people located in India each day of my job, and have direct reports there."
20381,Their assessment is about half the people they know are sick at any given point in time.
20382,My assessment is that I am sending out way too many condolences for loss of family lately.

20390,"or the news story that people here could be able to go stateside to get the second vaccine, it is essential on medical grounds, but I am cashing my chips it might be tricky getting a doctors note for it."

20501,I see that the hospitalizations and deaths have moved into younger and younger age brackets because the older folks have had the opportunity to get vaccinated.

vaccines are NOT a bio-energy shield."

20548,1) Researches have been working and studyingn mRNA vaccines have been around for decades.
20549,2)The vaccine doesnt enter tge nucleus of a cell or change DNA.
20550,It merely triggers ab immune response so our body is prepared for Covid.
20551,3) A billion people worldwide have been vaccinated and over 100 mil in the US.

20566,"In addition, the same day DeWine announced the lottery he also announced an impending lift of the mask mandate, so it’s impossible to know if the people getting the vaccine on Friday did so because of the lottery, because they know the mask mandate is leaving soon, or it was just a random statistical anomaly that happens all the time."
20567,"The fact that the DeWine administration is spinning it as some victory is lazy and dishonest, but unsurprising coming from politicians."

20584,I’d suggest reading more about the difference between the Covid Vaccine EUAs and full FDA approval.
20585,"Note, it’s pretty much paperwork for this particular case."
20586,“An EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine requires a two-month waiting period and data “from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.
20587,Vaccine side-effects almost never emerge after two months.
20588,"The core difference between an EUA and full FDA-approval is four additional months of observation after already-completed trials.”

20618,"If the curbside people won't even wear masks now, I'm just going to have to have everything delivered 100%."
20619,This is a terrible decision by the stores because cases are just going to get worse now.
20620,Only 1/3rd of the US is vaccinated (and not much further) and they pull this shit.

20640,"I'm also worried (and much more empathetic towards) younger high school kids/middle schoolers - they may have missed out on their fundamental classes which all the future classes will build on, but since most of them will be in the same boat hopefully next year they will be caught up."

20651,*
20652,It's never going to end.
20653,Enough people will not get the vaccine for it to truly ever end.
20654,"Corona will now be as normal as the Flu is every year, just not as devastating as it was in 2020 because of that amount that has been vaccinated."
20655,By next year it'll be just another disease we deal with.
20656,Policy makers being afraid to tie measure with goals and metrics has been a really big mistake I think.
20657,Seriously give people goals to meet.
20658,"Yeah, the restrictions seem to be dropping really fast now."
20659,Summer months and increased vaccinations are helping
20660,"&gt;I'm annoyed that the people, who said that they will never get vaccinated, the same people, that didn't care about restrictions and met with other people in summer, now all run to the docs for vaccines

At least long term, that will be way better than them being anti-vaxxers."
20661,"Mississippi is a warm state with a larger than average rural population and a low population density, yet it has one of the highest death rates per capita out of any state (5th) and also one of the lowest vaccination rates (it's the #1 worst state)

Don't try to spin this as a variables situation."
20662,"The states that were hit the hardest ibitially and gave the most densely populated areas in the country/world are being more cautious than Cow County Arkansas, and rightfully so."
20663,"&gt;I can't do anything to stop you getting sick, I can only stop myself from getting sick,

Bruh that was the entire point of wearing a mask"
20664,"Young people routinely make poor decisions, so…par for the course?"
20665,Are you 4 years old?
20666,"Because that's the only type of person I know who just blindly asks ""why?"""
20667,Stupid ass
20668,Dude I was reading this like yeah us young people then remembered I just turned 30 and it says 18-29...
20669,Damn just hit me
20670,Please quote an article where you're getting this.
20671,Media has a tendency to slant things so that things we aren't sure if sound certain.
20672,That things that aren't absolute sound it.
20673,I think you've misread or some source is outright lying to you.
20674,There's been too many schools with covid spread for me to believe that.
20675,"I'm not saying there are a lot of schools, just some."
20676,Absolutely.
20677,Took me more than a week to fully recover fully.
20678,Can you provide some insight into #3 please?
20679,Some businesses have more children and immune compromised people that frequent their establishment.
20680,If they choose to keep a mask rule in place then they need protocols for dealing with people that won’t comply.
20681,They may even have to consider security and things of that nature.
20682,It can be complex and have a lot of logistics that need to be weighed.
20683,"As a parent with small kids, thank you!"
20684,!
20685,I still remember 15 Days to slow the spread.
20686,Everyone could agree on that back then.
20687,Everyone was in shock and afraid - everything made sense and happened really quickly with the shutdowns.
20688,"It was only supposed to be temporary and here we are a year later

I think some people for awhile will wear masks but over time, I want to high five and talk with people again."
20689,Their is risk every day in life - we just have to choose how much we want to accept

20698,"As someone living in California, we're not all Covidiots down here."
20699,:( Some of us actually want this to be over.
20700,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
20701,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
20702,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

20706,I'm not looking at VAERS only.
20707,"I keep trying to give non-linked examples, but my posts keep getting deleted by the mods here."
20708,"There were mainstream news reports (rhymes with ""few pork dimes"")in the beginning about people dying or getting blood clots after Pzfier/Moderna, but people downplayed them as rare cases and continue to do so for the illusion of safety."
20709,The exact same thing they were doing with the AstraZeneca at the start.
20710,"They kept repeating  ""there were no links between blood clots and the vaccine"" and people dismissed the initial concerns as paranoia."
20711,But look what they're saying now.
20712,"Look up Everest Romney (17), Gregory Micheal (56), and  Luz Legaspi (72)."
20713,"Blood clots and low platelets, just like AZ."
20714,"There are plenty of more stories than just those 3, but it's a good start."
20715,Wish that was an option for kids
20716,"Oh boy, SIX percent!"
20717,Way better than giving the money to BIPOC communities that have been disproportionately harmed by this pandemic!

20720,This statement is per capita.
20721,It was a digital and phone call stalking.
20722,I was checking several vaccination sign updates daily.
20723,"Friend is a braver soul than, when nothing was available online, he called pharmacies."
20724,Still took him a while.
20725,"HHonestly the mask  in bushes, if it was outside a pharmacy that had people cancel slots would be more effective."
20726,It's this kind of shit that makes me NOT want to get it.
20727,I already got mine but if they start making everyone carry a stupid vaccine card to go places I'm not cooperating.
20728,"I don't know..between his head of the CDC statements and the headline here...

Did Captain Obvious get hired by them to write their speeches?"
20729,Some people just don't get sick a lot.
20730,I spent the three years immediately prior to covid traveling all over North America to attend swing dance workshops.
20731,I literally touched thousands of hands and got less than one cold per year.
20732,I think it's because I have kids.
20733,"You kind of build up an immunity over the first few years, and in my case it stuck around."
20734,Usually it would be posted by your county's health department.
20735,"Sometimes these will fall under a state health department, other times it could be separate."
20736,"For example, my area (Memphis,TN) is underneath the Shelby county health department, not the state health department."
20737,But there are only about 6 counties in my state that have their own health department making the rules.
20738,"I mean you have to recognize that it's still an overreaction, not to the same degree but an overreaction none the less."
20739,"Thr US isn't supply limited anymore, now its about convincing people that its safe/effective."
20740,This is what foreign aid should look like
20741,Meijer changed it today and is not requiring them now.
20742,I mean this is a generic statement about every country trying to put themselves in good social standing in the world
20743,"I confronted my manager here at Frys (Krogers) about customers not wearing masks (this was weeks ago) and he pretty much told me ""so?""."
20744,"I told him and showed him his own signs that say ""masks mandatory"" and he just shrugged his shoulders."
20745,"I came home and called corporate office and told them what happen and they have a store manager that refuses to enforce company policy, have not heard anything back."
20746,"I'm in Arizona and whats crazy to me is that even if you don't want to wear a mask, Fry's offers their curbside pickup and delivery services for free right now."
20747,You’re saying I go on Reddit and lie about having children?
20748,So you’re so screen damaged you don’t even believe real people with real lives are real.
20749,Believe what you want bud.
20750,"There isn't really a clear line between ""interpreting science"" and ""making policy."""
20751,"I mean sure, some."
20752,I work for a restaurant group but I am not in there day to day and all I know is they are severely understaffed.
20753,No changes are lightswitch for any business.
20754,"Yeah, because you're weak"

20756,The same as any other disease.
20757,COVID isn't going anywhere.
20758,It will be here forever.
20759,"If you can keep community spread around flu levels, things won't get out of hand."
20760,"Either them, NJ, or HI"
20761,Did you call to set up your appointment?
20762,Problem with “your kind” is that you are so scared of covid that in your absolute focus on avoiding it you miss all the other harm you’re doing to yourself but more importantly your children.
20763,Children need to socialize and play and be outside and around other people.
20764,Kids are missing out on a big part of their development.

20773,That is weak.
20774,They were going to come off sometime.
20775,When that time is right is debatable.

20814,"Actually, since Pfizer needs 5 weeks for full immunity and Moderna needs 6, even if someone got their first dose on the very first day (4/15), they wouldn't be fully immune until later this week or next week."

20818,Of course the least vulnerable and most brainwashed demographic is pushing this nonsense.

20838,And we're now seeing an increase of young people hospitalized with variants.
20839,"We are also coming up on the ""grey tsunami"" , The increased number of senior citizens in our community."
20840,"In every country, including the USA, a huge amount of care of senior citizens is unpaid and performed by family members."
20841,I predict this will also decrease the number of people who wish to commute.
20842,"You will have increasing number of working age people who are caring for kids, pets, and senior citizens all at the same time."

20851,"It's been a week since my second Pfizer covid shot, how much protection should I have about now?"
20852,"That’s a very low number, tbh."
20853,The US produces that in a week.
20854,We need to start stepping up our game here.
20855,"Yes, but isn't that more because it's hard to predict which strain of flu will be dominant in a given year?"
20856,"So if the prediction is correct the effectiveness goes way up, but if the predicted strain is different, the vaccine is only partially effective?"

20862,"While the US did a horrible job at preventing the spread, we are now at the forefront of vaccinations compared to others and can show how it will be when others get there."

20896,Right now it’s dead easy to get a vaccine (I’m in the LA area).
20897,"On top of that, California is being more cautious than other states."
20898,It’s not the government’s fault if people choose not to vaccinate — but that’s hardly even happening anyway so I’m not sure where you’re going with this
20899,Interesting!

20901,"If 2020 has taught me anything, it's that hubris knows no bounds."

20908,Read your own source.

20910,N95S being the exception.
20911,We don't yet have any studies specifically on AZ and B.1.617.
20912,We know it has a modest ability to evade the mRNA vaccines.

20918,Got mine back in March.
20919,"I was cautious for a year, but now I'm all for normalcy now that I'm vaccinated."
20920,I'm just here because my governor is being slow to lift the mask mandate.
20921,You keep spewing this garbage on every comment in this thread.
20922,ITS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
20923,It limits transmission and potential mutation if the immune system can attack it before the person has a chance to transmit.
20924,really?
20925,Taiwan can’t afford constant testing?
20926,I mean even India has no problem with the cost of testing
20927,"At what rate would we need to vaccine ourselves, at a national and global scale, to prevent the virus from mutating?"
20928,Let's say everyone in the US unanimously decides to take the jab.
20929,"But what about the spread between individuals in the UK, India, Brazil or South Africa?"

20936,I’m not “afraid” of the vaccine.

20945,like 7 out of 8 were asymptomatic and one had very mild symptoms.
20946,We already KNOW we will get infected.
20947,Do you see how you aren't thinking about it correctly?
20948,You're under the impression that there will be this mutant coronavirus that's going to kill vaccinated people and that's just not the case.
20949,The antibody resistance means that we'll get an infection but that's okay because we won't die or go to a hospital
20950,Most unvaccinated anti-maskers have been going maskless the entire time anyway.
20951,A lot of companies quit enforcing mask rules for employee safety.
20952,They just don’t care.
20953,I’ve come to the conclusion that natural selection can take its course with them at this point

20967,He's right...
20968,"If there was any chance that this vaccine was going to have horrible side effects we wouldn't have vaccinated nearly every medical worker on the planet first, and it wouldn't have gone to the rich/famous/politicians first either."

21027,Your statement that children catch and spread between children so that a class gets covid isn't happening.

21088,We do not get paid time off for anything unless we specifically need it to get to the appointment.
21089,(makes sense as we are WFH) I have held off on getting my vaccine (was planning to get it on 4 June based on being totally off from work for a week the 1st week of July which end of June would make sense for the 2nd shot) &amp; still intend to get it but am now mainly wondering about the days immediately following.
21090,The 2nd thing: I heard even here in Philly masks have quickly come off &amp; I have not left home since the 11th.
21091,"I am NOT an anti-vax person at all &amp; have been masking up since 18 March 2020 even outside, minimising shopping time to under 30 minutes in a store every 7 to 14 days."
21092,I feel like next time I go on an errand my KF94 may not be enough anymore when combined with everyone not masking up and the low (38%) vaccination rate in my city so far.
21093,"I sometimes feel like I should've cheated back in Feb/March or something &amp; said I have condition x or y just to get the vaccine earlier than I was really eligible for, but I really wanted to give the seniors/EWs/medical workers time to get theirs 1st."
21094,I really was not technically eligible till 19 April.
21095,I have noticed the attitude around here switched right around the 1-year anniversary of the 1st shutdowns to 'BAU at all costs'.
21096,"If I still decide to continue to just wait to get my 1st dose on the 4th &amp; live my near-but-not-totally-hermit lifestyle through that time &amp; beyond, am I at big risk that those few days will be the difference between catching vs avoiding the virus?"
21097,"A KF94 is not total protection of course, hence my question."

21102,"The pandemic surely isn’t over yet, because vaccination rates are still quite low in lots of places."
21103,"However, recent research has indicated that the two most prevalent variants seem to be covered by the current vaccines."
21104,"Obligatory source: I am a medical researcher, my in laws are biochemists who just attended a symposium where Fauci and other key researchers from Ohio State and Yale presented findings indicating the variants appear to be covered when examining them through both genetic and clinical viewpoints."
21105,Ohio's mask mandate wont end for another 2 weeks.
21106,People are still wearing it but the Wal Mart lady who sits at the door handing out surgical mask no longer sits at the front entrance.

21114,"Put them in a reinforced carseat, seat belt them in (masks), with every airbag possible."
21115,Masks are the seatbelt saftey precaution for the car that just ran the red light.
21116,Minus inconvience masks affect no one in day to day life.
21117,People are just lazy and dont want to do it.
21118,Driving is a necessity for 95% of Americans.

21120,So we take every precaution we can to ensure everyone makes it to point b safe.
21121,"As a parent if I contracted covid and gave it to my kid because I didnt wear a mask, or that moron behind me coughed on me, even if the chance was .000001% of them getting it, if they got it and died, knowing it could have been easily avoided I wouldn't be able to live with myself."
21122,That is what it's like being a parent.
21123,"Not ""well I'm vaccinated so YOLO""."
21124,"If we waited another month to release mask mandates, like a lot of states had planned before this CDC guidance, immunocompromised people would still exist and so would a portion of anti-vaxers."
21125,"Neither of those groups are going anywhere, so the best solution would have been to advise only states with high vaccination rates to lift their mandates."
21126,Other states would have had to wait until higher vaccination rates were reached.
21127,"Unfortunately, even with higher vaccination rates a month or 2 from now, the immunocomprimised would still have to take certain precautions, just like they were doing before COVID."

21271,It acted as if we didn't have these wonderful vaccines and looked (and looks) tone deaf.
21272,"Eh, it’s not likely."
21273,Vaccines are not miracle workers.
21274,They only increase your probability of not being hospitalised.

21280,"Nah they didn’t, very true."
21281,I’m not suggesting we stay locked down but I do wish businesses weren’t so quick to cancel mask mandates based on the honor system.
21282,Really stressful for people like me.
21283,I’ve considered getting the vaccine but my doctor advised me not to.
21284,"For anyone curious, that's around 3.5% of the 12-15 year old population."
21285,"I don’t mean to psychoanalyze or sound glib, but I find people who loudly exclaim to not care about something are actually obsessing about it."
21286,Cognitive dissonance itself is a stressor.
21287,The vaccine is safe but it may not be effective in some autoimmune patients.
21288,You really need to research the particular medication and how it impacts the function of the vaccine.
21289,"Steroids' like Prednisone apparently are the worst, anti-metabolites like Methotrexate are bad too, anti-TNF medications reduce effectiveness but aren't quite as bad."

21296,That masks aren’t needed anymore because Covid is over?
21297,Because that’s exactly what they said.
21298,And restricted a bunch of us from getting vaccinated even though Pfizer submitted results for 12-15 somewhere in March.

21303,I get what she was saying -- don't let your guard down yet -- but when so many people were about to be vaccinated it seemed so tone deaf.
21304,"I think health experts can bank on the fact that if they're THAT wrong, they can say, ""Well, better than being not serious enough!"
21305,"And if I DIDN'T say anything it could have been worse."""
21306,The US is a struggling nation in need....
21307,Only j&amp;j had an incident of GBS during trials and none in the MRNA vaccines if that helps you with your decision making
21308,"Yeah, more authoritarian countries focused on gaining international clout by sending vaccines, elected officials in the US knew they would be voted out if a drop of vaccine was sent elsewhere before every adult in the US had the opportunity to get one first."
21309,I guarantee the US will be a top vaccine provider going forward.

21311,It’s a bummer that as humans we don’t work this way.
21312,So you're not vaccinated.
21313,And you don't care.

21315,"Well sure, but it’d help if they at least led with that."
21316,"“We saw the CDC announcement, we are working on updated guidelines that are more closely aligned with them, we’ll let you know when that is finalized” is a lot more accurate than “everyone take your masks off!"

21325,"Summary  
Background  
Several aquatic organisms such as loaches have evolved unique intestinal breathing mechanisms to survive under extensive hypoxia."
21326,"To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange."
21327,"Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus)."
21328,"Methods  
Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon."
21329,"After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat."
21330,"Findings  
Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level."
21331,A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications.
21332,"Conclusions  
EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure."
21333,"Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions."
21334,"Funding  
This work is funded by the Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, Research Projects on COVID-19 (JP20fk0108278, 20fk0108506h0001), from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), to T.T."

21339,It really doesn’t much matter.
21340,"It clearly wasn’t created as a bio-weapon, so whether it was an accidental infection from a lab sample or if it jumped species naturally somehow, it’s really all the same in terms of response."
21341,"These timelines are soon to be moved up, the government errored on the side of caution because early in the year when shipments were delayed by Pfizer and Moderna there was a bit of an uproar

When they last announced timelines they said they wouldn't even get to 70 years and up until like June for first dose being very cautious."
21342,Today our biggest province opened it up for all adults in mid May.
21343,"The second dose timelines will be move up as well, and studies out of the UK are suggesting that the longer interval may actually be more beneficial as well."
21344,"I said ""If"" as in, in the future."
21345,"The time is not now, but it could be in a month."
21346,We likely don't have to wait for children to be vaccinated at great amounts for masks to not be necessary.

21351,I ran into a similar problem in another sub when I noticed comments were flipping from like +20 to like -20 in a matter of like an hour.
21352,The mods there basically told me their hands were tied unless they could find the source of it.
21353,Yeah for sure.
21354,And to be honest I'm kind of mixed.
21355,"Like, I'm vaccinated so I feel like I need to start getting used to going out and accepting larger exposure risk given I should be safe."
21356,"And I was glad to at least see the arena still forcing masks (but obviously that many people getting amped up watching a playoff game is going to have tons of shouting, booing, screaming, cheering and otherwise masks getting pulled down - the air in there is tainted for sure)."
21357,I am starting to feel like the unfortunate thing is for those that want to be vaccinated but either can't due to allergies or other blocking factors.
21358,For the likely \~15% that are just COVID deniers and won't get it no matter what - I feel they've made their choice and it's time to not keep holding everyone back for them.
21359,"That's how personal responsibility works I guess, so long as hospitals don't get bogged down."
21360,NYT had a really good article actually on the 4 major groups of people they see as being vaccine hesitant.
21361,"And it was actually interesting to see the flat out COVID skeptics are lower (I think nationwide it's like 13%, worst state is 23%)."
21362,48.1 % as of May 17.
21363,Are you referring to 60% of eligible adults?
21364,"I find hilarious how mods deleted your well thought, long and well grounded on reality post for being ""low quality information"" and this incoherent one liner referring to a thread from one year ago that you are replying to stays up."
21365,Think of all the money other states are spending on advertising and staff.
21366,May as well just give the money to a person.
21367,[removed]
21368,Vaccinated people do present very little risk but it’s greater than zero for both the vaccinated person and everyone they encounter so for now until the numbers are better we shouldn’t change anything.
21369,Because most of us who got or are getting vaccines believe they work and that things should be normal for people who are vaccinated including travel.. and the US has done a great job at their vaccine rollout and we're slowwwly catching up here in Canada.
21370,So yeah I don't see any reason now why travel can't happen if you are vaccinated
21371,Depends.
21372,Does getting the Indian variant COVID provide immunity against it?
21373,"If so, then it will be irrelevant because most of the poorer countries will hit herd immunity thresholds from infections (sadly)."
21374,This will neutralize the SA variant.
21375,"If not, getting vaccinated effectively against all strains but B.1.351 will mean that B.1.351 will be the one that is left infecting people."

21402,That is how viruses work.
21403,That's why we research and update the vaccine each year.
21404,This way we can help prevent the spread and severity of cases.
21405,Are you trying to claim that the vaccines don't work because people still get sick?
21406,Are you gonna also claim seatbelts don't work because people still die in car crashes?
21407,The number they are using for that 85% is for fully vaccinated individuals and the denominator is the whole population.
21408,"With about 45M children currently ineligible and it being incredibly unlikely that they'll be eligible in time to be fully vaccinated by October 1st, it's basically impossible for us to hit that number by that date."
