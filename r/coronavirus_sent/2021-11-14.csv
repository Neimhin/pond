11,"My chance of catching flu right now, &amp; thus posing a risk to other people, is therefore also very, very, very low."
12,"If I get vaccinated now I will make myself 50% less likely to catch the flu, so my chance of catching the flu will go down from tiny to extra-tiny."
13,"Meanwhile, as time passes, my immunity will decline by 10% a month."
14,"If the flu peaks around here in, say, January, my level of protection will be down to around 10%."
15,"That means that by the time there's a real risk of me catching the flu and passing it on, I will be almost as vulnerable to the flu as an unvaccinated person."
16,"If there's a lot of flu around, my chance of catching and becoming contagious is pretty high, even with the old, worn-out vaccination on board."
17,"Which is better: Being 50% protected against catching and passing on the flu when there's almost no flu around, or being 10% protected when there's a lot of it around?"

99,Yeah i know that law enforcement are not arbiters of justice.
100,They are simply just individuals who are just following orders (thank you for using the straw-man argument).
101,"Now don’t get me wrong, everything that you have mentioned previously to another redditor does have merit, however the problem that i have against your argument regarding having cops getting vaccinated by law is that that law in particular is gonna have unintended consequences, and it’s not a good one."
102,Why?
103,Well let me ask you these questions: do you know how long it takes to train competent cops?
104,Do you know how long it takes to recruit new officers to work at a particular station?
105,"Ooo and here’s the one million dollar question: if all those cops were to be fired for not complying to the mandate how long do you think it’s gonna take for the LAPD to start fully staffing competent cops who are one vaccinated, and two are willing deal with incredibly shitty people throughout the scope of their employment?"
106,"Now once you find the answers to the following questions, ask yourself this: how long do you think is gonna take for LA county to realize that they have shot themselves in the foot for legislating a silly mandate that is gonna eventually lead to high crime rates?"
107,"As a Californian who lives in LA county myself, that is deeply concerning for me."
108,Yes it is important that we should get as many people vaccinated as possible but i personally think it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do with their bodies through a mandate.
109,It gonna make people become more reluctant to get the vaccine and can make the people starting questioning their authority figure(s)’ motives for issuing the mandate in the first place.
110,"Also another flaw that i found with your argument is that i have been hearing from a lot of sources (word of mouth, news stations(yahoo new, msnbc, etc.)"
111,that there has been reports of people fabricating fake vaccine cards to get around the vaccine mandate.
112,Im kind of curious if you are aware of that piece of information.
113,P.S.
114,"i had to call you out stating that you like following orders because it gave me the impression that you must be the type who would follow any law, no matter how silly or unconscionable it can be to a right minded person."
115,"As a Californian myself who is fully vaccinated with moderna, i don’t like the mandate cause this can potentially lead to high crime rates throughout LA county, and law enforcement will be unable to quell the chaos all because of a dumb vaccine mandate telling you that you cannot work, dine out, or go to public places unless you are vaccinated."
116,It’s sounds incredibly classist and discriminatory toward the people who are unvaccinated and/or towards people who choose to not get the vaccine for whatever the reason may be.

319,Everything I could find was about the chance of the animal even being rabid in the first place and the odds of that being the case.
320,Also the vaccine works so its not clear if you would or wouldn't once you've been vaccinated in time.
321,If you know of anything specific on the subject or your googlefu is better I'd love to know of there's also a chance to not catch it if bitten with it.

324,Why are the vaccination rates in the East lower?
325,Does it have something to do with them historically being part of East Germany?
326,"A vaccine requirement for venues is not “hygiene theatre.” 

It significantly reduces the odds that you will catch Covid at one of these events."

328,"**

It also encourages vaccinations for the hesitant."

531,"Variants can only become more contagious, so the reasons efficacy went down a tiny bit with Delta is due to us being exposed to a higher viral load thus upping the chances of it slipping by the cracks but it wasn't significant enough to be a huge impact for those double vaxxed."
532,"We don't need a delta specific vaccine, our current ones were designed extremely well."

597,"While I personally wouldn't have a problem with unvaccinated people getting pushed to the back of the line, it is still an ethical dilemma."
598,"The whole point of medicine is to treat you, no matter what."
599,Doctors should not differentiate and should not have the burden to decide who gets treatment.
600,"If it's a kidnapper getting shot, a dumb teenager recklessly injuring himself and someone not being vaccinated (which can mean corona, but also other things: what if you forget to renew your tetanus shot and contract tetanus?)."
601,"Of course, this situation is different because of the scale of the problem, but imo anyone saying it's a simple decision is making it out to be too easy."
602,I could add to the examples above a vaccinated 70 year old who needs to be put on a vent because he met up with 10 friends without a mask?
603,"I know this behavior  hard to prove compared to your vaccination status, but that person definitely is less ""deserving"" of treatment than someone who is vaccinated and has been wearing a mask and distanced themself from others."
604,"You can go on and on (vaccinated, but ignoring masks vs unvaccinated, but observing social distancing and masks), but treating unvaccinated last is not a magical and fair solution - maybe it's more fair, but it depends on your point of view."
605,"In any case, in medicine this kind of decision should be avoided at all costs, plus it's unfair to force doctors to make calls like this."
606,So I think there will be mandatory vaccinations before they start prioritizing vaccinated over unvaccinated.

644,You shut up.
645,Vaccination is not mandatory.
646,So either make it mandatory or stop thinking it's mandatory.
647,I made my choice to get vaccinated but I respect people who made their choice not to get vaccinated.
648,You should too.
649,It's human to do so.
650,But given the fact that health care gets overwhelmed and hardly anybody really wants to deal with the fallout of that (e.g.
651,"people dying from various treatable conditions and injuries because there are simply no resources available to actually treat them) government has to say to someone ""you must do this or else""."
652,"Either to the whole society for example in the form of ""you must once again stop visiting restaurants, sport facilities...."" or only to a certain minority which did not get the vaccine by their own choice."
653,In other words doing nothing it not really an option.
654,So it comes down to deciding who to target with the now necessary measures.
655,Limiting them to a group of people who are comparatively high risk by choice sounds like a good idea.
656,Although I fear it might be too late and will not be enough at this point.
657,&gt; Other families have expressed fear their loved one who is dying from COVID-19 in hospital is being used as a part of a global experiment.
658,"The funny thing is that, we're basically already part of a global experiment."
659,"Researchers are already tracking the spread and the effects of the virus in biological, financial e.t.c."
660,fields.
661,"Whether it's deliberate or not, these people should ask themselves, do they want to spread the virus and put themselves or others in danger?"

663,US in Europe though
664,[removed]
665,"At this point, I doubt the pandemic will be ended through vaccinations and/or infection."
666,The reservoir of unvaccinated in Germany is huge and breakthrough infections are a thing.
667,"Vaccinations are super important, but I doubt they will stop the pandemic."
668,The only thing that will (maybe) safe our ass medium to long term are better drugs.
669,"If we don't get more of them, the future looks bleak for older people."
670,"i dont think its complicated even there, assuming the 20something doesnt have a medical condition that prevents vaccination one person did their duty to society and the other didn't, put the old guy in the ICU"
671,Whenever she did something fast (didn't exactly happen often.
672,Immigration crises and nuclear power plants come to mind like you said) she should have thought about the repercussions longer.
673,Whenever she should have decided something she sat it out.
674,Anti-Vaxxers plus stupid media effectively still second-guessing vaccines by focussing on reports about breakthrough infections instead of reporting about prevented hospitalizations or deaths.
675,I've been double jabbed but I'm curious have you seen the accusations from B.M.J against Pfizer??
676,BMJ is no joke
677,I agree with that but this is a different topic.

683,The lymph nodes around my jugular veins are quite upset.
684,Still better than covid and the flu!
685,"Front line war against death  front line war against COVID, front line war against bullshit."
686,That’s why there are booster shots.
687,"True, but the significance and implications are not widely understood"
688,[removed]
689,Well said!!
690,!
691,Yes.
692,Here in Austria in certain regions Hospitals are overflowing.
693,Germany just classified us ‘high risk’ meaning if you live near the border and like many people have friends or family in germany it’s a lot harder to visit them.
694,People (and like our official data shows mainly unvaccinated people) are dying and spreading covid like wild-fire and yet a third of the country still doesn’t want to get vaccinated and pretty much is responsible for this whole mess.
695,"Now that they announced consequences and restrictions mainly (but not exclusively) for the unvaccinated, many have decided to get vaccinated and places where you can get vaccinated are overflowing."
696,"This won’t end until close to 90% of the population is vaccinated, meaning we have to reach 90% one way or another."
697,[removed]
698,"Unfortunately, it seems a large population of the human race prefer to let this virus mutate, just so they can go out for coffee."
699,It doesn't help that governments suck at helping people with other issues that aren't COVID related (e.g.
700,"income), and some organisations exploit this, I think some forest got cut down more because of the lack of protesters."
701,"You seem to be considering recovery from the virus to somehow be vastly superior to vaccination, which it isn't."

707,"I'm afraid this trend will continue, and winter 22-23 ill be worse again."
708,And to what magnitude.
709,"Greece is a small country with countless small towns and villages where people's mentality is ""naahh.. we'll be just fine without a stupid vaccine"" while they keep gathering without a care in the world because that's what they have been doing, well ,since forever."
710,The majority of young / middle aged people are vaccinated and careful.
711,Older generations are stubbornly still unvaccinated .
712,I have had unvaccinated relatives ( over the age of 70 ) shame me for not hugging/ kissing them .
713,Stood my ground and told them I really don't care if you they are offended  but it only goes to show much  people are not in touch with reality.

719,All of that has been said.
720,There's so many different people saying different things.
721,Our government consists of two partys that can't be any more different and rules are changing literally from day to day.
722,So well ...
723,I don't know and I don't expect that to change soon.
724,I just try to get my family's third shot asap and care only for the rules that we have to follow.
725,"I don't care where I need a common mask, where a FFP2 mask or no mask."
726,I just wear FFP2 wherever I go.
727,"But hey, everything's gonna be good again some day :)"
728,Not only politicians.
729,"Where I work, I've been hearing from high management for almost two years how the pandemic is almost at the end and how in a few months everything will be back to ""normal""."
730,It's almost like they didn't read what happened 100 years ago and didn't translate it to our times.
731,"Maybe being contrarian appeals to some people, even if they do go and get vaccinated."
732,[deleted]
733,I dispair at this question.
734,"You don't need to answer, but I happily just assume you are an American who watches Fox as their main news channel."
735,I don’t think masks make much of a distance at a store.
736,There’s just not enough spread there for it to matter.
737,You mix the time intervals.
738,"You mix different, compare different things."
739,E.g.
740,"&gt;You have 76% 2-dose vaccination rate, better than a lot of places, but nowhere near Mumbai's 87% seropositivity at which point the Delta pandemic ended there."
741,Comparing vaccinated in NL with 87% seropositivity in Mumbai.
742,Why not add for those in NL who got Covid already?
743,Starting to get to the level of Mumbai.
744,You are comparing different things.
745,Didn't the Mumbai sero test include adults over 18?
746,The 76% vaccinated in NL is for all people.
747,Adult vaccinated people in NL is higher.
748,87%?
749,Also Mumbay is not NL.
750,You mix 7 days averages with single days averages.
751,"You more or less throw in random values, e.g."
752,the single day 20% positive test share.
753,"You base your 42% growth on new cases, without taking into account other factors like testing."
754,"Number of cases is not the best indicator, e.g."
755,it does depend on number of tests.
756,"You could have been looking at hospitalizations, or deaths, e.g."
757,"[hospitalizations](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/ziekenhuis-opnames) Yes, hospitalizations is lagging the cases with about a week, but since you compare since beginning of October why not use it?"
758,If you used hospitalization you would get less than 42%.
759,Last complete week in November is ***far*** less than 42%.
760,I do not deny there are more cases now than in the beginning of October.
761,I'm saying your own calculation is sketchy.
762,"You then base your sketchy 42% to draw your own conclusion and analyze, e.g R, 8000 deaths, 70000 hospitalizations."
763,[deleted]
764,"Austria has 67% population vaccinated, thats not low in my opinion."
765,I don't think the vaccines are as effective as we were hoping for.
766,"&gt;  Despite Mauritania being the most vaccinated, only 12% of the population is fully vaccinated."
767,Mauritania isn't the most vaccinated country in Africa or even particularly close.
768,Morocco has 61% of its population fully vaccinated.
769,It isn't even the most vaccinated in sub-Saharan Africa.
770,That is South Africa with 23% fully vaccinated.
771,"I don't think anyone thinks it's over, but masks vaccines and health passes are effective."
772,The countries implementing these measures effectively are having far smaller spikes.
773,That's not true about supermarkets in Lithuania.
774,"Ireland has no rules about masks, the covid pass is only for bars and restaurants and their numbers are still much lower than Britains."
775,MUCH lower
776,"Same, works great in Switzerland."
777,"And at least compared to France, they also check our identity card to be sure it's the same name as on the COVID pass app."
778,[removed]
779,did you read the article?
780,"the unvaccinated are still allowed to work, go to grocery stores and pharmacies and a few other essential things."
781,"they are just not allowed to go to hotels, restaurants non-essential shopping, cinemas, etc."
782,and by now BILLIONS of people have been injected and I have yet to hear of anything going majorly wrong.
783,"if that’s not enough to convince you take it, then you deserve to be ostracized from the upstanding and unselfish members of society, who actually give a shit about protecting people other than themselves."
784,"The word ""controversy"" does imply serious debate and lends an air of legitimacy to the antivax voices they haven't earned."
785,Freeing the dumbest people from their money isn't going to work out well in the long run.
786,"""I baptise thee in invermectin, in Bejeebus name!"""
787,"To clarify a bit …

Delta is the result of a mutation to the spike protein, one that makes this variant bond more efficiently to ACE2 receptors and be able to replace much faster

However, is the *effect* of the mutation, the faster replication - particularly in the nose &amp; throat region where antibody levels are usually lower - that is causing a higher incidence of breakthrough infections, *not that the mutation itself is escaping the antibodies produced by current mRNA vaccines."
788,"* Hence, no Delta specific adjustment"
789,"Not sure it was tolerated so much as treated as rubbish no reasonable adult would believe, as it should be."
790,But by treating it as rubbish that no reasonable people would believe it is a pattern which emerges over and over again when examining the histories leading to modern US societal movements.
791,It seems to me that current vaccines are effective against delta.
792,"Delta spreads faster mostly because of its higher viral load, which has nothing to do with defeating the vaccine."
793,"Breakthrough cases increase because of reduced effectiveness over time, which is solved by a booster, not my reformulating the vaccine."
794,So I don't understand why you think a delta specific vaccine is needed.
795,That will not directly change the viral load of infected people or address the waning effectiveness over time.
796,It seems to me that what we need is an improved way to deliver the vaccines we already have so that immunity lasts longer.
797,"But as usual, I defer all my opinions to experts, so if tomorrow the WHO or CDC announces that a delta specific vaccine is needed, then my mind is changed."

844,"While cases are the first metric measured along the timeline, there is wide variability in potential severe outcomes based on *who* is infected."
845,"An outbreak on a college campus or 100% vaccinated workplace may generate a lot of positive tests and few hospitalizations 

IMO, esp post-vaccinations, focus should be on hospital admissions as the primary signal, while keeping in mind those will lag ~10 days behind new infections, and so setting thresholds for action required lower to account for the catch-up period"
846,I wish they’d come out with a proper vaccine involving a dead or weakened Covid-19 virus so we can get near life-long immunity like the other traditional vaccines.
847,It’s hard achieve herd immunity with an mRNA vax that significantly wanes after a few months and constantly needs to be re-dosed.
848,"If I was previously infected with covid and got the Moderna vaccine, should I get the booster, or is it a waste of time?"
849,"I'm not opposed, I'm just wondering if I really *need* it before I sign up for an appointment."
850,But thats not what we were told with Covid vaccine.
851,The 3rd injection may not necessarily be long term solution so your comparison to Hep vaccine is irrelevant.
852,Also infections and deaths are going up in western countries with high vaccination rates.
853,Its only matter of time before more restrictions will be applied.
854,Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the vaccine is not very effective.

856,Well vaxx is vaxx right?
857,They don't take medical advice from doctors.. the very idea!
858,"There’s a seasonality to COVID spread, due to both how society’s behavior shifts over the course of the year, and also how the outdoor weather impacts the quality of indoor air, which can dampen or facilitate spread 

The danger zone is often when weather turns cooler, high temps start dropping below ~65 deg F and windows stay closed, trapping more aerosols, even if behavior hasn’t changed at all"

1025,I've honestly been curious if the TB vaccine scar is a factor in different countries.
1026,Almost every Brazilian I've ever met has the BCG scar on their shoulder.
1027,"My dad had one, but most younger Americans don't."
1028,I've been curious to know if places where that scar is common has made any difference on people's feelings about vaccines in general.
1029,"I guess if you just become a ruthless ruler where you don't care about the welfare of your people or the planet, means the people have to look out for themselves and they're not so stupid that they can't see the vaccine as worse than getting the virus."
1030,"&gt;Effectiveness against transmission As described above, several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection."
1031,"Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."
1032,"There may be additional benefit, beyond that due to prevention of infection, if some of those individuals who become infected despite vaccination are also at a reduced risk of transmitting (for example, because of reduced duration or level of viral shedding)."
1033,A household transmission study in England found that household contacts of cases vaccinated with a single dose had approximately 35 to 50% reduced risk of becoming a confirmed case of COVID-19.
1034,This study used routine testing data so would only include household contacts that developed symptoms and went on to request a test via pillar 2.
1035,It cannot exclude asymptomatic secondary cases or mildly symptomatic cases who chose not to request a COVID-19 test (16).
1036,"Data from Scotland has also shown that household contacts of vaccinated healthcare workers are at reduced risk of becoming a case, which is in line with the studies on infection (17)."
1037,Both of these studies relate to a period when the Alpha variant dominated.
1038,An analysis from the ONS Community Infection Survey found that contacts of vaccinated index cases had around 65-80% reduced odds of testing positive with the Alpha variant and 35-65% reduced odds of testing positive with the Delta variant compare to contacts of unvaccinated index cases (18).
1039,This is quoted from the link you provided.
1040,So it's blackmail then.
1041,"Something tells me this isn't going to rub people the right way, both vaccinated and unvaccinated."
1042,How is this going to affect families/people living together.
1043,Unvaccinated are allowed to leave their house for work.. so you're still expected to contribute to the economy and society to some degree.
1044,"This is just my 2 cents, and no, I am not anti vaxx."
1045,"Okay, cool I guess."
1046,"&gt; In a report published in Applied Physics Letters, Australian and UK scientists claim that enhancing cold plasma ionised gas with peracetic acid eliminates germs in wounds and significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 virus loads."
1047,"Sounds a lot like those cancer ""treatments"" that just kills everything it touches..."
1048,Can you educate me on the probabilities here?
1049,What's the probability of an unvaccinated individual to spread covid to another unvaccinated?
1050,What's the probability of an vaccinated individual to speard it to another vaccinated?

1054,mRNA vaccines need a completely different production chain.
1055,And right now all existing production capacity for mRNA vaccines is used for Covid-19 vaccines.
1056,"In addition, no other mRNA vaccines have been approved for use yet."
1057,"Once the C19 situation calms down, you'll see new mRNA vaccines popping up and that's when we might see flu shots that are developed closer to the start of flu season."

1061,Austrian here: Why do you think this is terrifying?
1062,The truely terrifying thing here is: We are one of the richest countries in the world.
1063,We have one of the best health care systems of the world.
1064,We have one of the highest ratios of ICU-beds to population of all countries.
1065,"In most areas, we do not have a single ICU bed left and they have to triage since about 1-2 weeks and let people die, reschedule cancer surgeries etc."
1066,Chose your priorities.
1067,"For the time being, all countries go through cycles of rising and falling cases (also known as ""waves"")."
1068,"Vaccine passes, lockdowns, mask rules etc."
1069,"are all helpful as long as the rules are actually enforced (which they aren't in many places, so that the rules largely exist on paper, and are only followed by those who choose to adhere)."
1070,But no country is safe or doing great as long as there are so many active hot spots around the world.
1071,France is not an island unto itself.
1072,"And cases in France are going up again, just like they have gone up, are going up, and will be going up in various other countries at various times."
1073,"The vaccines aren't as effective against Delta as they were against the earlier variants, and it will remain to be seen what happens with new variants that develop."
1074,Don't assume that France is fine just because your numbers have been low for a while.

The point of getting vaccinated is to reduce the risk of catching the virus, spreading it or end up in the hospital."

1098,Lol.
1099,In Europe I've never seen it to be particularly common; most people I knew in school and work don't get flu shots - it was usually the American expats that did.
1100,Personally I never get it because I never get the flu.
1101,You can still be infected with the virus and transmit it to others when you are fully vaccinated sadly.
1102,The vaccines are excellent at preventing serious illness in most people - but they are not as good as we hoped at stamping out transmission.
1103,"We have that app and it is approved EU wide, it is called the green pass."
1104,"&gt;ey make it le

thanks for answer"
1105,Not OP but the UK Health Security Agency publishes weekly COVID surveillance reports and [their week 41 report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1025358/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-41.pdf) shows that the double vaccinated had higher COVID infection rates than the unvaccinated.
1106,This is also true in their more recent reports.
1107,"There’s a much lower risk of hospitalisation or death among the vaccinated - which is fantastic - but being vaccinated seems to not be as effective at preventing transmission as we hoped, according to this data."
1108,Obviously people should still be vaccinated for their own protection despite this.
1109,It’s just perhaps not going to drop infection rates as much as everyone hoped…
1110,You got that right !

1140,Yeah since at least April 2020 😳
1141,&gt;How do you determine if someone who is having a medical emergency is vaccinated or not?
1142,Dunno about Germany specifically but everyone in the UK medical information including if they have been vaccinated is stored on computers they only need your name and approximate age and can usually find it - which if you have any ID on you or someone gives your name then its avaliable.
1143,Very few people end up in hospital here without them knowing some information so its a small number of cases and just treat those.
1144,Also I think what they are referring to is those unvaccinated that go to the hospital for treatment of covid.
1145,They will give the info to get the medical records then.
1146,Neither.

1160,"""Our"" who?"
1161,"In a country like Ireland, where 98+% of the elderly are fully vaccinated, hospitalisations are much higher and growing much faster than last year - which is only obvious given there's 10x more cases - and now more than two thirds of all hospitalised are elderly."
1162,Same goes in Singapore afaik.
1163,"So by this logic they should quarantine the vaccinated because they're the ones throwing gasoline into hospitals, right?"
1164,Sounds like you also didn't read the article thoroughly though.
1165,"He said that focusing on the unvaccinated as if it's only about them at this point is quite nonsensical, because it's not a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated""; he also added that even a 2g system is unlikely to stop the wave."
1166,"In other interviews he said the most likely outcome is that Germany and pretty much the rest of Europe will just need lockdown-type measures over the winter, but countries with high vaccination % such as Spain or Portugal might actually be out of the pandemic for good in spring."

1936,There were already differences about rate of infection between contries/regions before vaccination starts.
1937,"Also, it has been confirmed by legit crinical trials that vaccines have certain effect."

1987,"If there is better filtration, indoor air quality will improve as there will be less mold and pollen allergens, diesel exhaust, and smoke from wildfires."
1988,There's also a lot of plastic garbage particulates in the air that aren't healthy but aren't studied.
1989,"We also now know that many other diseases that were thought to be spread through fomites are likely often spread through the air like MRSA, etc...

2052,"Incidence in the vaccinated is 73, in the unvaccinate it is 1389."
2053,"An highly unvaccinated area therefore will automatically create high incidence (if testing is high), where npis have to be used again."
2054,Furthermore very few areas in US show high enough vaccination rates.
2055,Your numbers of 90% and 40% seem too extreme to prove your point.
2056,"Natural immunity due to infection and deaths are higher there and might play the greater role, still it is unreasonable to assume US will get through the winter without npis due to terrible vaccination uptake."
2057,"Mother-in-law is still dealing with long Covid symptoms, like body pains, dizzy spells and fatigue that comes and goes"
2058,"So not sure where to post this, but I finally convinced my friend to get vaccinated (between her being scared of needles and a mutual friend who got Guillain Barre from it [she still advocates the vaccine], it was tough), but she's going to be getting the J&amp;J while I get my Pfizer booster, anything I should know to help her before and after?"
2059,"I know some of my friends got their asses kicked for the rest of the day, so I'm trying to help her minimize that."

2086,"&gt; the ""test and trace"" (which has never worked if you can't keep your borders shut)

Contact tracing is a technique for keeping low cases low and getting early warning for when they are no longer low."
2087,It can be combined with testing at borders and requiring foreigners to participate in the contact tracing system.

2102,I have a lot of nurses in my family.

2110,"Its not necessarily that nurses didn't trust the vaccine, it was that nurses didn't trust the hospital, and with damn reason."
2111,Hospitals just wanted vaccines in arms so they could drop all other safety and PTO protocols and get them back to getting abused at work as quickly as possible.
2112,And nurses wanted contractual guarantees to protect their health and safety before that happened.

2134,"In one county, you might have a 90% vaccination rate and in another a 40% rate."
2135,"In the higher rate county, the hospitals will be empty."
2136,With the same case rate and the exact same NPIs.
2137,Dr. Monica Gandi wrote about this.

&gt;There is a lot to blame for rampant obesity, but if we consider the holistic circumstances of most people living in poverty in the US, obesity is generally not their own choosing."
2167,I am willing to give way more latitude to those living in actual food deserts and those living below or at the poverty line.
2168,"But only 13% of people are at or below the poverty line and we have a 37% rate of *obesity*, and I highly doubt all poor people are obese so some of that percentage absolutely comes from solidly middle class people who indulge in too many gluttonous habits."

2177,"In other words, are we going to need boosters every 6 months?"
2178,"Personally I don't mind getting a booster, but I know many people won't want to."
2179,This has the potential to drag out the pandemic even longer if it turns out twice-a-year boosters are required.

2189,"The needle's tip probably got damaged as it was going through the bandaid, so it was no longer surgically sharp when it reached your skin."
2190,"So rather than cutting through cleanly, it wrecked things on the way in."
2191,If I were you I'd talk to the manager of the facility where you got vaccinated as he is putting people at risk of infection and the vaccine not working correctly.
2192,"&gt;The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140 196 (56%) were male, **and 197 777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19**."

2213,Just less likely?
2214,...yes.
2215,That's how vaccines work.
2216,That's how they've ALWAYS worked.
2217,Not even a condom is 100% effective; you can still get into a fatal car accident even if you wear a seatbelt.
2218,Good job figuring it out.
2219,"&gt;that would bode much much worse for an actual COVID infection where the virus is actively replicating millions if not billions of copies of itself, including many times that in spike proteins, relative to a vaccine that generates spike proteins."
2220,"Vaccines that use the spike protein as a target are a finite dose and do not replicate, and get cleared by the body within hours."
2221,If anything this just underscores how critical it is to get vaccinated.
2222,I was just asking based on this part of the previous post.
2223,"I like how they went out of their way to call 65% vaccinated ""embarrassing""."
2224,"Lookin' good, America."
2225,"Yeah unless you live here, because everyone thinks everyone else is an idiot."

3141,The Berlin virologist Christian Drosten criticises the claim that the poor Corona situation is due to the unvaccinated.
3142,He puts forward a different thesis.
3143,"Berlin - Time and again, politicians speak of a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated""."
3144,World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery recently even warned .
3145,Behind this is the accusation that mainly vaccination refusers contribute to the bad Corona situation - and are also responsible for tightened measures.
3146,"Berlin virologist Christian Drosten disagrees: ""We don't have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, we have a pandemic,"" he stresses."
3147,"There is a pandemic ""to which everyone contributes - including the vaccinated, albeit somewhat less""."
3148,Drosten sees a core problem in the fact that the existing vaccinations can only withstand the delta variant of the coronavirus to a limited extent.
3149,"""After two or three months, the spread protection of the vaccination begins to decline,"" he says."
3150,"Older people in particular had already been vaccinated in the spring, he adds."
3151,"""They are now gradually losing their spread protection, and they are becoming more and more so,"" Drosten says."
3152,"A second problem, however, actually has to do with the fact that there are a larger number of unvaccinated people."
3153,"Among those over 60, the rate of fully vaccinated people is 86 per cent, he said."
3154,"""That is insane, that is really dangerous,"" Drosten continues."
3155,"Drosten: Booster campaign could prevent worse things from happening

A possible way out of the worsening pandemic situation
."
3156,"""What we could do now would be to carry out a booster campaign with great vigour, a campaign for third-party vaccinations among all those who have already been vaccinated, starting with the elderly,"" says Drosten."
3157,"In this way, it might be possible to guarantee herd protection for the duration of the winter."
3158,"Ideally, both would succeed: boosting and closing existing vaccination gaps."
3159,But the question remains how many people will go along with it.
3160,"Drosten: Demands for more tests are unrealistic

There are not many other options:
Drosten considers this unrealistic."
3161,"And for a noticeable testing effect, ten million tests per week would be needed, as in the spring."
3162,"For lack of alternatives, Drosten says, we will have to resort to contact-restricting measures again."
3163,He does not know whether this is legally tenable.
3164,What would then remain would ultimately be a lockdown for the unvaccinated.
3165,"""Whether this will reduce the incidence in November - I have my doubts,"" says Drosten."

3197,"Precisely because it's obvious and ubiquitous, it gets censored out already in the mind of the speaker the second somebody comments in public."
3198,"It's a sort of deference to a failing system, just as much as it is too frightening a prospect to contemplate."
3199,"The ending of an age, I said."
3200,"The ending of the age when democracy, capitalism and science were so closely linked, that it was easy to delude yourself into thinking that it can't be any other way."
3201,"It's death throes we're watching, the question is which organs can be donated to the future and it's becoming more and more obvious how that's boiling down to a 'choose two out of three at best' situation."
3202,"The QOPers have chosen just one, corporate democrats have opted for electric shocks to keep the corpse wiggling."

3373,"That’s why I thought it was important to give my own perspective because you have people who think differently to you, this shouldn’t be punished and basic human rights should not be void because of it."

3381,Who knows the numbers but this is why it mostly acceptable to be without the vaccine for some.
3382,"Let’s say 40/50 million people die if we continued as normal, no lockdowns and no public restrictions."
3383,Herd immunity is strong and we come out the other side.

3402,There’s only been hate and politics from one side about Covid.
3403,"Lmao, this is outrageous, sorry."
3404,We have arrived to the point where people are losing their rights because they dont want to consent to a certian form of a medical procedure.
3405,The only harsher measure that exists is a state mandated vaccination without the consent of individuals.
3406,Getting vaccinated is a personal choice!
3407,Or at least it should have been.
3408,Why take away the most basic rights?
3409,"Like people are some children that understand only ""do this, or else the punishment will come""."

3411,"Repression, repression and more and more repression."
3412,The average age of people who die because of coronavirus is higher than the average life expectancy in several EU countries!
3413,"And saying that young people die too is entirely correct but young people also die from all kinds of other diseases or accidents that are preventable, but for example, state will not mandate a obligatory alcohol test before driving a car or outright ban the sale of alcohol."

3418,Last possible measure!
3419,"I realise that getting vaccinated is the best solution to keep people from dying, having the worst symptoms, infecting others, keeping hospitals from collapsing and so on but do we really need to force people into doing it by taking away their most basic rights?"
3420,"Why does the state has the urge to be opressive so directly, if they could just mandate, that in case of maximum capacity in the hospitals, vaccinated people will take priority or unvaccinated will have to foot the whole bill of the hospital visit or some shit like that?"
3421,Everyone should have a choice how to live and what to do.
3422,Vulnerable groups are just that- vulnerable.
3423,"It pains me to say it but that is, to an extent, their problem."
3424,And de facto locking people up for the sake of protecting the vulnerable group is nonsensical.
3425,"People should discover in themselves and trough others the obligation towards those, not being forced to it or they will never learn."
3426,"Before you tag me as an antivaxxer, I am vaccinated but only because I chose to do it."
3427,"I hate being ill, I love my (elder) relatives and friends, I miss hanging out with people, travelling, going to sports matches and I believe that getting vaccinated is the best way to do it."
3428,"But not in this kind of manner when a state, the very entity that is the guardian of all of its people is forcing something upon them, threatening with dire consequences if they dont do something just because they said so."
3429,I believe that kind of mentality is ill fated and can be catastrophic in certian cases.

3440,"You know it’s a global economy and the flu circulates the world every single year on planes, cargo ships, general migration intercontinentally etcetera correct?"
3441,"Honestly, the boosters are somewhat muddy waters."
3442,It appears that the vaccines are holding up pretty well at preventing hospitalizations and deaths without a booster - especially in certain age groups.
3443,"At preventing cases though, not-so-much."
3444,"I got my booster because I have a 3-year-old daughter with a high-risk condition, so more protection against getting a case for me, means I'm less likely to pass something to her, so more protection for her."
3445,I feel like the boosters are 100% up to the individual to look at their personal situation and make a risk assessment.
3446,"I do however think if you have previously had Covid, then you should get at least one dose of a vaccine."
3447,Multiple studies have shown that you have better protection after infection if you add vaccination.

3476,Right now the mainstream conservative position is that the COVID-19 vaccines are somehow radically different than others.
3477,However most of the arguments against it are standard anti-vax canards that could be used for any vaccine.

3479,"Base told me I could go to immunizations and have them combined, but kept forgetting."

3482,Here's the issue.
3483,"I've got my vaccines, got my flu shot."
3484,My kids are all up to date on inoculations and they too have the flu shot.
3485,"I'm pro vax, no issues with it."
3486,Let's go!
3487,"However, if I show some hesitation in having my kids take the covid vaccine, or tap the brakes when it comes to getting a booster for myself I'm called out as a science denier, luddite and genocidal maniac."
3488,Take it easy folks.
3489,It's not always black and white.
3490,I also think that if someone already had Covid there's no reason to get vaccinated.
3491,I'm not running out to get a chick pox vaccine so fast either.
3492,And I certainly don't think the Federal Government should use strong arm tactics for this specific virus.
3493,But if I dare express these opinions I'm a danger to society.

3632,"Fuck, I hate this fucking country!"
3633,Nope
3634,Not entirely true.
3635,"I’m a nurse, I’ve worked in 4 different hospitals in 2 different states and the flu shot was mandatory for employees in every hospital that I’ve worked."
3636,Severity of disease is also a lot lower with vaccines.
3637,"If 90% of people (as approximately my province is for vaccination) make up 50% of hospitalized people, then if 100% of people were vaccinated we'd have, at least, 40% less disease burden proportionally (tired brain no math perfect)."
3638,Vaccines reduce disease burden on individuals and society.
3639,"With delta, the only circulating variant (Covid 1.0 being eradicated by vaccines), it doesn't reduce transmission as much, but it reduces hospitalization enough that if 100% were vaccinated we could pretty much go back to normal."

3701,"The lies about insufficient efficiency of the vaccines or them being not enough to live with the virus, shared by both Querdenkers and the NoCovid fans, should definitely be prosecuted, and the opinion leaders and activists of both should be observed by the Verfassungsschutz."
3702,"To add some context, which the article doesnt give: 

Drosten said in his podcast that boosters are a medium term plan, vaccination of the non-vaccinated are most important but a long term plan."

3723,\- No longer treat the not vaccinated?
3724,Questionable from a moral point of view.
3725,\- No longer treat people with COVID-19 at all.
3726,Even worse than the first option.
3727,"\- A ""normal"" triage?"
3728,People maybe even with conditions completely unrelated to COVID-19 will no longer get the appropriate treatment and die.
3729,"Injuries and illnesses, which normally would be treatable become a death sentence."
3730,Likely for months before the health care system is able to keep up again.
3731,Dozens of health care workers will burn out by the situation or will require psychological treatment afterwards (it is not easy to just let people die who you normally would be able to help).

3740,"Translated from german:

The corona numbers continue to rise - where are the hotspots?"
3741,New data from the Luca app provide clues.
3742,A part of the gastronomy should not be happy about that.
3743,Almost three quarters of all corona warnings from the health authorities in Germany that were generated from the Luca app system went to visitors to bars and clubs.
3744,"This emerges from an anonymous evaluation for October, in which over 181,000 warning messages were analyzed."
3745,Warning notices via app and calls to users of the app by the health department were recorded.
3746,"Almost half of the warnings concerned clubs: 49.1 percent,
almost a quarter of bars: 23.2 percent."
3747,"Restaurants, culture and sports are not likely to be corona hotspots

In contrast, comparatively few warning messages were sent to restaurant guests."
3748,They received 10.9 percent of all warning messages.
3749,Almost 9 percent of the warnings went to the visitors of events and festivals.
3750,"Retailers (1.0 percent), cinemas (1.7 percent) and theaters, museums and cultural institutions (together 0.9 percent) hardly played a role."
3751,The areas of sport (0.8 percent) and fun / swimming pools (0.6 percent) also did not turn out to be hotspots.
3752,The Luca app is intended to replace the mess of paper that would result from an analogue recording of visitor contact details.
3753,This contact recording is required by law in most federal states.
3754,"It cannot be done by the federal corona warning app, which anonymously records dangerous risk encounters."
3755,"In addition to Luca, apps such as eGuest or Vida also offer contact recording."
3756,"Luca app continues to be criticized by data protection experts

With the help of the Luca system, the health authorities can choose between two different levels when making contact."
3757,"On the one hand, users can be informed digitally about a general risk of infection."
3758,"If there were several people at a location recorded with the Luca app who later tested positive for the coronavirus, the health authorities can also issue a targeted infection warning and point the people at risk to test centers in the area."
3759,The Luca app has been criticized by data protectionists primarily because of a concept of central data storage.
3760,"In addition, the use in the health authorities is very different, since some responsible people doubt the effectiveness of the Luca system."
3761,Hamburg is the pioneer in use.

3821,We have one of the best health care systems and beds per population but any system gets overwhelmed by covid waves.
3822,We absolutely canceled surgeries which resulted in peoples deaths.
3823,"The above video hinted on that and there were reports from past waves where many cancer patients did not get treatment, even though critical treatments shouldnt have been affected by it they did."
3824,If people have to wait 4 months or more for their tumor surgery doctors can only say its too late now.

3840,We only “don’t need it” now that the powers that be have decided breakthrough infections are an acceptable thing.
3841,"They’re allowing logistics, vaccine fairness, and cost to impact health decision making."
3842,&gt; Don't know why your comment is being downvoted.
3843,Idk either.
3844,"Everything around covid is highly emotionalized, many hard fronts."
3845,"Even when i list official health committees advice and give the source, if its unpopular i get downvotes."
3846,But its more important to be accurate than popular.
3847,For example WHOs advice to rather give first shots to poor countries than to booster 30yo in rich countries is very unpopular here (in some groups) or to still mask up even if vaccinated if incidence is high.
3848,The bureaucratic difficulties are very high even for native speakers.
3849,"It is my strong opinion that without vaccination sites, in a scenario where only GPs vaccinate, i wouldnt have gotten my shot anywhere close to the time i got it."
3850,My mum even had to go to the GP 3 times to get her flu shot because the lady at the front desk was ill informed.
3851,"People like to believe that everyone vaccinated is awesome and can do whatever they want and everyone not yet vaccinated is antivaxx ""Querdenker""."
3852,Opinions like that are dangerous because they exclude reality.
3853,And without knowing and acknowledging systematic discrimination it cant be solved and this plays straight into the hands of the right.
3854,"You almost had it, but it will never end."
3855,Fauci was correct in early 2020 when he said coronaviruses don’t confer lasting immunity and that fact remains now.
3856,How 2 years on we still have this pipe dream of it “ending” has prevented us from taking real measures to learn to live with this.
3857,In wild infection only provides adequate protection against *the same strain* of virus.
3858,"And yes, it lasts only about 6 months, same as vaccination."
3859,"If you were previously infected and a new strain comes along, you are pretty much guaranteed to get infected."
3860,In wild infection along with vaccination provides an immune response that is much stronger than just in wild infection.
3861,I don't get the flu vacc.
3862,I IMMEDIATELY got the Covid shot.
3863,"Following COVID protocols, I haven't gotten sick since I first had COVID February of last year."
3864,It's kinda nice not getting mild illnesses now XD
3865,So what?
3866,The exact same happened to me.
3867,My Uncle didn't get the vaccine and he died.
3868,"He was a nice guy, but I can't fathom his decision to be left unvaccinated, when his entire family did get them."
3869,He paid the ultimate price for it.
3870,"It looked grim from the start, shouldn't even be on the ICE, other people have non preventable life threatening concerns."
3871,Nobody should go into lockdown based on a personal choice of getting vaccinated or not.
3872,"Exactly, punishment is bad."
3873,So why punish the ones who are already not educated enough to see that the vaccine is the best solution out of the crisis?
3874,Why devide the people even more?
3875,"It's because it's one of the first vaccines children get, right after birth."
3876,Have you ever seen anyone with some disability caused by Polio?
3877,Even 20 years ago was rare to see those patients.

3881,This was always my thing when the original fringe antivaxxers would talk about autism.

3883,That just doesn’t make any sense to me.
3884,"I wrote a more detailed comment about this, but the auto-mod decided it was too p o l i t i c a l. Trying to avoid that trap:

As you suggest, the decline in childhood vaccinations has multiple causes."
3885,"In 2020 and early 2021, we had a drop in childhood vaccinations primarily due to lack of access to care."
3886,People who lost their jobs also lost their health insurance; many also moved or became homeless.
3887,"At the same time, the number of patients pediatric practices could see dropped because of the need to keep everyone distanced and isolated."
3888,Many free clinics that provided services for at-risk populations closed because of budget cuts or pandemic restrictions.
3889,"About needles: Every conceivable medical supply has been out of stock somewhere at some point in the pandemic, but thankfully, standard hypodermic needles have not been a big problem."
3890,"[There is a special ""low dead space syringe"" that's very helpful in squeezing a sixth dose out of the nominally five-dose Pfizer vaccine vials."
3891,](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/11/966712940/short-on-syringes-japan-may-waste-millions-of-pfizer-vaccine-doses) Those special syringes have been in short supply everywhere since the start of 2021.
3892,There have also been supply chain issues with certain types of the sterile glass vials used to store vaccines; thankfully that hasn't been a big problem for childhood vaccines in the USA because they don't need the cryo-vials used for extremely low temperature storage.
3893,"The childhood vaccines are also enormous production runs with multi-year supply contracts, which helped."
3894,"This may be grim, but I would rather them focus on being anti-vaccine, instead of being anti-climate change, which is what they used to be."
3895,"Okay, ""surpasses"" and ""U.S"" in the same sentence re: Covid19."
3896,What a surprise!
3897,Is this title a joke?
3898,But congrats to Brazil and now aim to surpass a country who's doing better than the US.
3899,There are... a few.
3900,/s
3901,We’re always precisely 2 weeks away from this coming to an end in the US.
3902,All it takes is everyone to just roll up their sleeves and get a shot.
3903,It’ll take 2 weeks for shot 1 to provide some measure of protection and for those who caught it before the vaccine took effect to get sick.
3904,Once that happens ICUs no longer will be over run.
3905,No more disingenuous arguments.
3906,No more BS.
3907,If you want this to end everyone has to be American and do their part to protect their fellow Americans from harm.
3908,Oh no whatever will we do without Slam Dunk Pizza in Willits
3909,Or lots of comorbidities.
3910,"Lots of people that would have gotten ""just sick"" with influenza."
3911,"But when you add influenza + COVID, that turns into a death sentence."
3912,I did it and was fine.
3913,I had Pfizer
3914,Have they waived their vaccine patents to allow other countries to produce their own though?
3915,"Aside from exporting, this seems like the far more humanitarian move, for both the EU and the US."
3916,“As a fully vaccinated person…” and then they say the most blatantly socially irresponsible antivax nonsense
3917,I wasn't referring to the population.
3918,It wasn't up for vote for us.
3919,I am sure half my country disagrees with it seeing as not all provinces are using it.
3920,But it still exists.
3921,It's there.
3922,"So, I was just saying, it doesn't need to be via CDC."
3923,"If the government wants an app, they'll get one."
3924,Well aren’t you special
3925,UK is handling covid the way everyone should.
3926,Their only issue was not pushing for kids to get vaccinated IMO.
3927,Think that changed tho
3928,Nothing in US.
3929,"Biden national mandate been blocked by the court, unlike many countries, US does have protection for civil liberty"
3930,20 year old unvaccinated vs 80’year old vaccinated is more complicated.
3931,"Or, I suspect, there is no reasoning at all."
3932,"For the most part, any ""reasoning"" they provide is just whatever they want to explain it away at the time."
3933,"The root cause is non-reasonable, based on other factors that do not involve logic and thought."
3934,He doesn't have a 100% chance of dying only after being exposed.
3935,"He could only have a 30% chance of contracting rabies after being exposed, but then once contracting and symptomatic, yes he will have a 100% chance of dying."
3936,We tolerated it then and let it grow.

3938,"If you don’t want to be there, then don’t go.. you’d probably have an unhappy time anyway."
3939,"If needs be, develop a stomach issue the day before."
3940,(Which might not be an untruth if you’re stressed.
3941,Stress can affect the stomach.)
3942,I think there is.
3943,Unvaccinated are threats to public health.
3944,You know what society does with threats to public health?
3945,Take a guess.
3946,Yeah that's probably it!
3947,Very glad to be one of them!
3948,Half our country want to do it.
3949,(Sigh.)
3950,There is absolutely no way this pass constitutional test unless martial law is declared.

3963,Even better if it's broken down by age group and state.
3964,"I'm trying to not judge here, but....having to have your cumulative COVID vaccine doses notated on separate cards suggests that you have lost the previous ones/forgotten to bring them to your appointments."
3965,You should have only \*one\* CDC vaccine card.
3966,"Also, I have a relatively small tri-fold wallet and my card fits in mine."

3970,Nope.
3971,Two times (separate) were due to in laws visiting briefly at the door with masks that they pulled down when talking.
3972,One time was when holding my nephew for the first time since he was born.
3973,He had just turned one and I really wanted to see him before they moved to Florida.
3974,I guess I just threw caution to the wind.
3975,Good point!
3976,You can now.
3977,iOS 15.1 just rolled it out.
3978,Export from your health provider app to your (apple) health app and it will ask if you want to add it to your wallet.
3979,I find this very odd as well.
3980,"I know you can easily go out and get one, but official guidance ""Everyone 12 and old can get a booster 6 months after their second dose"" would really help."
3981,Latest iOS 15.1 allows your healthcare app to export to the digital wallet.
3982,MyChart is the app from my provider and I was able to do it.
3983,You “share” it to your health app and then the health app asks if you also want it in your wallet.
3984,Has a giant QR code too.
3985,Wasn’t intuitive but it works and now it’s easy to pop out if asked.
3986,should we not try to save lives anyway?
3987,even if it meant no change in covid policies?
3988,A family I know had covid for 2 weeks immediately follow by stomach virus for 2 weeks.
3989,One kid was in the hospital and they still won't get flu shot or God forbid a covid vaccine.
3990,They say they have the antibodies now so they're fine...
3991,I have no words.
3992,I'm stunned by this country and I feel like i need to do something about it.
3993,I'm pretty sure we have the same issue here.
3994,"There's a complete divide with my friends and family because, as it turns out, a good portion of them are anti-vax (Covid19 specifically) because, you know, conspiracy."
3995,That card is only a short term record.
3996,It’s updated on mygov within a day or two then you can have the certificate on your phone in multiple way.
3997,Fuck around with Mother Nature.

4018,"But if they do get caught, let me know so i can laugh at them."
4019,Tell your SO respectfully that he should stop worrying about what’s right when it comes to protecting himself because the people running around unvaccinated don’t give a fuck about him and will give him Covid and never think twice about it.
4020,"Just starting to recover from a case of Covid with the JJ vax 6 months ago, I was trying to get a booster and couldn’t get one in time."

4035,My proof of vaccinations is being reviewed at these places but they are not using the provided app to scan the provided QR code.
4036,Italy did the same when every thing sounded much worse.
4037,They made it out without collapse (although even a lot of staff died iirc)
4038,This is exactly what I've been afraid of.
4039,"I knew that once Antivaxxers convinced people to be afraid of COVID vaccinations, they would start denying all modern medicine."
4040,I hate being right.
4041,"Yes but the shot doesn’t give you the flu, which is what some people seem to think happens."
4042,The shot side effects are not because it’s infected you with the flu.
4043,How does this happen?
4044,You a doctor?
4045,&gt; Could the politicization of COVID-19 vaccines lead to the politicization of all vaccines?

4074,What were the symptoms of myocarditis that you experienced?
4075,"First off, not every unvaccinated person has covid and spreads it."
4076,"Second off, the vaccine doesn't stop you from spreading it, it just makes you somewhat less likely to, and the science isn't at all settled on to what extent it does."
4077,"But if that alone is enough for you to want to mandate it, then by that logic, we should also mandate mask wearing for literally the rest of time because it makes you less likely to spread common colds, flus, etc."
4078,"and you don't have a right to infect people with those illnesses either.Finally, the original argument had nothing to do with whether covid was contagious, it had to do with the fact that the person didn't want to pay medical costs for other peoples' decisions, which would also apply to smoking, obesity, etc."
4079,"I brought my initial card when I got my second dose, got a new card for my second dose."
4080,Brought both when I got my booster.

4114,COVID doesn’t have the same statistical outcome when comparing the chance of death.

4130,Not how it works sadly.
4131,People tend to get confused between proportional likelihood to get sick (which is much lower among the vaccinated) and absolute values.
4132,"When you have thousands of cases among the vaccinated, a lot of them are still gonna end up in hospitals, potentially straining the healthcare system."
4133,Essentially the pandemic will end when pretty much everyone will have been infected.
4134,Fair point.
4135,"But they said (at least according to you, I wasn't following that) that it is not their job, not that they don't have the resources, which would be a reasonable criticism."
4136,I’m surprised this isn’t the norm everywhere.
4137,"True, but at least there's a much slimmer chance for us to die"
4138,I think how he puts it (or how the newspaper reported it) is not 100% clear and some people will twist his words.
4139,"Of course even vaccinated people are getting sick and contribute to the problem and should still be careful, but he also says vaccination and booster shots are the best bet to get out of this situation."
4140,"&gt; It's shit like this that's feeding antivaxers

 the antivaxers feed themselves their own shit, there's nothing any of us can do and it isn't really on us to be trying to protect them from every drop of news they can use for their own benefit."
4141,"I understand the frustration as I share it, I just don't give a solitary shit about them anymore."
4142,"If it isn't this news, it's something else they make up to latch onto."
4143,This isn't our or the pharmacists  fault who fucked up administering the vaccine to these kids that is causing the antivaxers to do anything
4144,Oh for these airheads it is
4145,"Me neither, I have a close familiy member (fully vaccinated) with stage 4 cancer and I would hate if a life saving surgery is posponed because of unvaccinated CoViD cases"
4146,"Limited resources, I guess."
4147,Imho the whole thing with lockdown for unvaxxed people is just a political stunt.
4148,"Government wants to demonstrate, that it is easier for vaxxed people."
4149,"But experts say, it's already too late for that, we need a full lockdown to get out of this situation."
4150,There's loads of idiots who just got vaxxed cause they didn't wanna get locked up again.
4151,"What u gonna tell them next, when they're in a lockdown now even tho they got vaxxed?"

4157,I have someone I'm very close with in my familiy (fully vaccinated) with a stage 4 cancer.
4158,I'm getting almost to the point of supporting to leave unvaccinated people in the ICU to die in order to make room for vaccinated people needing the ICU care.
4159,The average IQ on the planet is about to grow.
4160,I see this as an absolute win.
4161,Do you have numbers for that?
4162,Wasn't wakefield trying to sell his own mmr vaccine too?
4163,"I ""love"" the implication that they'd rather their kid die of a preventable illness than be autistic."
4164,CDC recommends vaccination by the end of October.
4165,I don’t think the number work the way you think.
4166,I don’t think you start at 50% and then go to 40% the next month.
4167,Do you have a source for that?
4168,CDC page: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/summary/summary-recommendations.htm#timing
4169,A huge chunk of the ones I see say that you can still get the flu even if you get the flu shot so it's not really a vaccine and that's just like COVID
4170,"Actually that is wrong, if every healthy adults are vaccinated, the virus will be severely weaken and hard to transmit, it's called ""herd immunity""."
4171,Sadly this is jeopardize by those healthy adults who refuse to vaccinated.
4172,The reason why vaccinated ppl keep getting covid19 is due to new variants that is produce by unvaccinated people.
4173,"The more people refuse to get vaccine, the more new vatiants of virus will produce."
4174,"So trust me, vaccination is a scientifically proven method to protect people around you."
4175,I remember back in the 2000s when I was in middle school and it was a bad flu that year.
4176,The school police officer came into our Health class to encourage people to get flu shots and how the whole police department gets them every year and how we should get them too.
4177,Clearly the times have changed.

4179,Man.
4180,"You people really struggle with context, don't you?"
4181,The pandemic continues until everyone has acquired a humoral memory B and T cell response to the virus.
4182,Vaccinated people definitely have that response.
4183,"That is what ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" is about."
4184,If everyone got vaccinated we'd be done.

4205,"Seems like people had to get testet, and thst it took place in the summer (the virus seems to spread more in the cold)."
4206,According to worldometer there were also hardly any new covid cases in general in the state where it took place at the time.
4207,Germany has more covid cases right now than at ANY time before during the pandemic (and pretty low vaccination rate compared to western europe) .
4208,There are many restrictions in place now and they plan even stricter ones to tr  to get it under control.

4216,"But now, 95% of people they treat in ICUs are unvaxxed."
4217,"They still need to work overtime, even so most of those people could have prevented their hospital stay."

4223,How do you explain the county of Waterford in Ireland then?

4227,"Ah yes, the “my feet still get wet so why bother with an umbrella” argument."
4228,"Well, people should not read just keywords and jump to conclusions."
4229,"First, the findings are in vitro (e.g."
4230,in a test tube).
4231,"Second, if spike proteins have a significant effect on DNA repair and adaptive immunity, that would bode much much worse for an actual COVID infection where the virus is actively replicating millions if not billions of copies of itself, including many times that in spike proteins, relative to a vaccine that generates spike proteins."
4232,"Vaccines that use the spike protein as a target are a finite dose and do not replicate, and get cleared by the body within hours."
4233,If anything this just underscores how critical it is to get vaccinated.
4234,You do not seem to understand how German government actually works.
4235,Many if not most of the pandemic related decisions are by design not made in federal government but in the governments of the various federal states.
4236,Some of them actually did quite well others extremely bad.

4242,He hasn't explicitly said that he's going to leave but he's telling people he's scheduling all of this time before the mandate goes into place because the company won't pay it out once you're gone.

4272,Can you imagine the outrage if one of these people got kiboshed by editorial fiat...rather than getting put six feet under by COVID (which of course does not move the needle at all)?
4273,"For one or two shots it probably would perform somewhat better, but at the third dose level, you have so much protection it's not going to make a difference."
4274,Making a delta-specific vaccine might be useful for places where people are still having a hard time getting their first dose.
4275,"But the places that Pfizer and Moderna make the most money from, most people who want a vaccine have it, so boosters are the only relevant part."
4276,Another thing they might be able to do a Delta specific shot with slightly lower the dosage to improve safety while maintaining effectiveness against Delta.
4277,"So I wouldn't rule out a Delta variant  specific as being useless, but getting as much safety data on it as we have with the other mRNA vaccines is impossible."
4278,"There might also the concern that if you get vaccinated with a Delta-specifc vaccine and a super Delta comes out, you might not be able to get booster for that so easily if the Delta antibodies are effectiveish (similar to how people who get the flu vaccine every year may have weaker protection in a given year where the flu only changes a little compared to someone who only got a flu shot that year specific for that stain)."
4279,"This only can happen if the antibodies are still effective against super Delta though, so it's a bad reason not to do a Delta vaccine."
4280,That's actually a pretty good analogy for what we are seeing here.
4281,Without confidence intervals this comparison is worthless.
4282,"Nope, but he should probably see his pediatrician"
4283,We're doing great here in Sweden though - the vaccines work.
4284,I only and repeat only got vaccinated because I knew my travel rights were going to be infringed on if I didn't.
4285,"I'm young, I eat healthy and take care of myself."
4286,"Some people have really bad reactions to the jab, yes i know its such a small percent but it still exists and too deny it does and say 'oh just get the jab' is so dumb."
4287,I know people who died of cancer and that's such a small percent too.
4288,And i know the likely hood of long term affects are so low but again they still potentially exist.
4289,"This is forcing people to take a shot in the arm if they want to live a normal life, its a dangerous prescient to set."
4290,When everyone's vaccine effectiveness wanes after 8 months are we going to also force everyone to get it every year?
4291,Just so we can give farma companies billions every year?
4292,If you are vaccinated why do you care if someone isn't?
4293,that is their choice and risk to take.
4294,We wont ever get rid of covid if that's your argument.
4295,I wish i didn't feel pressure to get this jab because i would have been perfectly fine without it.
4296,Also measles wipes out your immune memory.
4297,We are in for a shit show.

4305,The contradicting information is the frustrating part.
4306,"Depending on what article you happen to read, the vaccines are either extremely effective at preventing infections or they're practically worthless, only protect against severe illness and death, breakthrough infections happen all the time, and on top of that, immunity wanes after just a couple of months."

4334,Giving them what they wanted and accepted the whole time or deviding society and pressuring people to something they don't want?
4335,Most people who die from Covid are unvaccinated.
4336,So where is the problem?
4337,The numbers are clear.
4338,If they don't want to die they have to get vaccinated.
4339,If they accept that risk that is their choice.

4382,"When masks mandates and social distancing started, they were following it religiously."
4383,"Even when visiting their parents they would keep their masks on, don't hug anyone and stay outdoors."
4384,Vaccines started and they were ecstatic to get a shot..
4385,"Most people I know that were afraid of the vaccine, were afraid of getting the side effects such as pain in the body, headaches, nausea.."
4386,They weren't afraid they would be controlled by some evil government or any BS of this kind..
4387,"So these people that were afraid of the vaccine started seeing people taking it and feeling alright after it, so they started feeling confident in taking it as well and took it indeed.."

4394,Sorry for giving the wrong impression.
4395,"The absolute best thing we can do now (and we can, which is miraculous in itself) is to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible."
4396,"Not the only thing, but by far the best thing."
4397,That's quite an extreme approach that could strengthen their cause and drive violence.
4398,It also raises questions about bodily autonomy.
4399,And this accomplishes what exactly?
4400,Covid has animal reservoirs and exists in other countries.
4401,The second this lockdown is over COVID is back.
4402,Holy shit.
4403,I already feared these morons BEFORE I knew about this story.
4404,"There are nutcases on all sides of the political spectrum, and I WANT to believe this guy was just the typical aberration...your usual one-in-a-million psychopath that we've heard about for decades."

4406,The misinformation campaigns would have gone on regardless.
4407,The fact of the matter is Donald was a symptom of a much greater threat to modern civilization.
4408,"There are those out there, be it governments or other organized groups, who are actively relentlessly shitposting on the internet with the single goal of fucking over modern civilization."
4409,"Everyone's at risk, but the US is at significantly greater risk thanks to decades of people insisting on not properly teaching people."
4410,"&gt;At least in the US, lockdowns are never ever coming back."
4411,They’re destabilizing to society far more-so than outright covid deaths are.
4412,A lockdown will be done for the *first time* in USA eventually.
4413,Taking a vacation for 2 weeks is healthy.
4414,If we plan ahead for it there is no reason people cannot have supplies stockpiled.
4415,"We could, for example, plan on starting July 4th 2023."
4416,Could be over for 99% of counties by Monday July 17th 2023.
4417,With a thorough mass testing campaign small towns and counties could quarantine as a group.
4418,We can pick up and drop off trailers without the driver making contact with anyone.
4419,So we can barricade the roads but open them briefly for caravans of tractor trailers.
4420,At state lines drivers can switch trailers right on the interstate.
4421,Emergency services will need to train a double redundant team.
4422,The lockdown crew quarantines the 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after.
4423,For most people it takes 2 weeks of relaxation (or telecommuting).
4424,Compare that to getting vaccinated every year from 2025 to 2045.
4425,That adds up to 20 days of feeling sick and sore.
4426,In addition to the vaccine damage breakthrough infections continue to get some of us ill. 95% reduction of hospitalization still means going to the hospital 5% of the time.
4427,Over the course of 20 years those odds look really bad.
4428,"There are a myriad of diseases and virus' that permeate and kill humanity, COVID is just another one of many."
4429,Pre vaccination it posed a major problem because its combination of high R value and higher than acceptable death rate were a systemic risk as well as a spreader of major pain/suffering.

4433,Once again what really kills me is all the resources these morons are taking up.
4434,All the risk and stress they are putting our health care system over - for nothing.

4437,"Boom, you’ve smoked."
4438,Go get your booster.

4459,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

4462,*
4463,Add to this that the antivaxx “specialists” keep saying the number of adverse effects is much higher than it really is because they either don’t know how VAERS works or don’t care.
4464,With covid they are saying everyone dying isn’t actually dying from covid but from the vaccine.
4465,And they fully believe that.
4466,Germany's case rate per population right now is about as high as America's was in August.
4467,Charles Darwin has entered the chat
4468,Agreed.
4469,I didn't worry too much about the flu vaccine either until I actually got the flu a few years back.
4470,It developed into pneumonia followed by back to back to back bouts of bronchitis.
4471,It kept me out of work for about two months altogether.
4472,I've gotten a shot ever since.
4473,This shit just makes me so angry.
4474,Innocent kids who have no recourse to protect themselves will be suffering and dying because of a bunch of fucking mold-level intelligence morons who don't understand science and who don't want to.
4475,"Just, goddamn does it make me angry and I'm on the verge of feeling that vaccines should just be mandatory, no stupid belief exemptions either, because having a ridiculous ""belief"" that vaccines are harmful should not excuse *anyone* from following the laws that everyone else has to follow."
4476,"Documented health reasons that are upheld by a doctor (a real one, not some woowoo fucker) demonstrating a contraindication could exempt, but that's it."
4477,I'm struggling really damn hard between feeling that it *should* be law in order to protect the health of all of society and not wanting to excessively regulate it.
4478,Protecting innocent children from their idiot parents' choices should hold more weight than allowing parents to massively risk the health and well-being of children.

4484,Exactly.
4485,"The one track fixation on case levels as the only thing that matters, and treating every COVID case as equally dangerous is so frustrating to deal with."
4486,A breakthrough COVID case is far less of a worry than a case among the unvaccinated.
4487,"So many talk up ""COVID will always be with us, it's going to be endemic"" but then in the next breath lament the existence of it and fret over case counts as if there's some magic bullet to get to that Zero COVID utopia."

4593,"He argues that pharma companies are, first and foremost, capitalistic ventures which are publicly traded and therefore rely on investors."
4594,The monetary benefit from pushing the booster vaccination with the old vaccine is much more profitable than releasing the newer vaccine which would have to be studied and tested again.

4601,It's a different discussion than the reason why people have historically foregone routine flu vaccines.
4602,"With a username like that, you've got to be legit!"
4603,"What exactly do you mean with ""endemic""?"
4604,"To me, the word seems to mean merely that the virus would be around permanently."
4605,"The word as I know it does not imply that it is cheap or pleasant to have it around, or that having it around cannot be reduced."
4606,This contradicting information is the result of people either not understanding or intentionally misrepresenting conditional probabilities.
4607,The vaccine makes you less likely to get infected.
4608,"If you are infected, it makes it less likely for you to develop symptoms."
4609,"If you develop symptoms, it makes those symptoms less harmful."
4610,"Because you are less likely to a) get infected, b) stay ill for long, and c) cough around a lot in the meantime, you are also less likely to infect others."
4611,"However, if you *are* infected, you *can* infect others."
4612,"Also, a classic example of Bayes’ theorem in action: if more people are vaccinated, the ratio of vaccinated people in hospitals will increase."
4613,That doesn’t mean the vaccine doesn’t work.
4614,"It’s like saying: most people getting injured in car accidents were wearing their seatbelts, so clearly seatbelts don’t help."
4615,"The more people are vaccinated, the less the virus can reproduce, and the fewer opportunities it has to find new hosts."

4617,"I work at a fairly conservative church (I'm not religious or conservative but money), and yesterday the preacher did a sermon about getting the flu shot and how sometimes God will heal you, but sometimes he wants you to learn how to heal yourself and had a sad anecdote about his sick kids."

4630,I am not an expert but that number does seem to be incredibly high.
4631,High as in more than 10% of the people who aren't vaccinated missed out because they are allergic.
4632,You contradict yourself.
4633,"You say that the vaccines are good enough and that it is not true that they have their limits, even if generally effective, and at the same time that they cannot stop the spread and that stopping it is not, and was not, even a goal."
4634,My experience about what was communicated is different.
4635,This definitely works.

Is two weeks of feeling like crap (COVID when vaccinated) 100 times worse (counting probabilities) than a day of feeling with a cold?"

4744,probably because most people can't get a booster yet- so they aren't affecting data yet- and Delta/Delta plus are really good at breaking through.

4764,"Furthermore, the companies had to be completely onboard to modify contracts, so they are unlikely to challenge."

4865,It's pointless to spend most of our effort on attempting to reach the 18% that NOPE out of vaccination.
4866,You have MORE vaccinated people now than unvaccinated.
4867,The most effective thing we can do is to make sure those that are vaccinated are completely out of the equation in terms of getting sick or transmitting.
4868,That's easy AF to achieve because those people have no problem getting boosted.
4869,You're going to have far better results taking 70% of people out of the equation completely by brining their VE against infection up to 95% (from 50-70) than reaching maybe 1-2% of those 18% who will not get vaccinated under any circumstances.
4870,This entire conversation is dumb AF.
4871,All blame should be on Tedros who started the crusade on boosters right after Biden's administration put forth a boosting plan.
4872,Subsequently boosters were torpedoed by the FDA and CDC.
4873,"They can bullshit us all they want about lack of data, but the data was clearly there."
4874,Israel were the only ones that gave 0 fucks and did the right thing.

4934,It has been documented but is very rare so others might not commonly see it.
4935,It apparently goes away on its own but it would be good to report to your doctor so it is documented as an official side effect.
4936,"From the Pfizer study:

&gt;Four rashes in BNT162b2 recipients (observed on the arm, torso, face, or body, with no consistent pattern) were considered to be related to vaccination; the rashes were mild and self-limiting, and onset was typically 7 days or more after vaccination."

4939,Anyone know what dose was administered as booster?

5023,I wasn't talking about them.
5024,I was talking about vaccinated people.
5025,You'll have humoral immunity from vaccination/recovery.
5026,If immunity wanes you'll be exposed to it many times by the time you're old.
5027,The virus will also likely to forced to mutate eventually to better completely escape immunity which will likely come at a cost to fitness of the virus.
5028,It is very unlikely that there's any kind of reset of the virus where it goes back to being just as lethal.
5029,"It will never cause zero deaths, but with immunity from a lifetime of being exposed to it, then all it'll become is just another viral pneumonia."
5030,"Those are known as ""the old mans friend"" and they tend to get everyone in the end, and they often eliminate suffering in the chronically ill elderly."
5031,"And there's a precedent for a respiratory virus doing this, since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic just came back every season after that as seasonal influenza."
5032,It didn't come back as pandemic waves that killed 2.5% of the population every few years.
5033,"And when H1N1 jumped back into humans in 2009, everyone who was born before 1957 who had T-cell and B-cells to H1N1 had partial immunity which took the edge off of the 2009 pandemic since those older people were partially inoculated and it didn't ravage nursing homes."

5045,This study makes very weird choices.
5046,"To my eye, choices that are bad enough that I find it difficult to understand how it made it through review."
5047,"(1)  In their country study, they're looking at confirmed case rates in a particular week and comparing that to vaccination rates."
5048,"But this would mostly be measuring whether a country was before, during, or after its delta-related surge."
5049,(2)  Their analysis of US counties is just a boxplot and bar chart.
5050,Why aren't they including some manner of actual analysis that can generate an estimate of statistical discernibility?
5051,"(3)  Even if we treat using figures instead of analysis as acceptable, the figures of the US counties show what appears to my eye to be an obvious downward slope -- relatively highly-vaccinated counties are doing better."
5052,"Frankly, I think this is why they're not showing any estimates of statistical discernibility here."
5053,"(4)  Their analyses of countries and counties don't weight by population size, which means low-population countries/counties are over-represented in the data."
5054,Low-population countries/counties are inevitably going to have noisier levels of both vaccination rates and covid.
5055,(5)  They're reporting percent of counties that had an increase.
5056,Why?
5057,This is dumb.

5085,The New Zealand government’s vaccination advisory panel estimates that fewer than 100 New Zealanders will not be able to get the vaccine for medical reasons.
5086,That’s in a country of 5 million.
5087,"And many of those people will be eligible for another vaccine in the future, because NZ is only using Pfizer at the moment."
5088,"The number of people who legitimately cannot get some kind of vaccine is a tiny, inconsequential number."

5097,"The government, as a function of the constitution is required to (to the best of its abilities) ""promote the general welfare"" of its population."
5098,"&gt; We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
5099,"One thing all of you ridiculous individualists seem to gloss over is that the government was specifically setup to ""promote the general welfare"" of the population."
5100,"That means some public works, aid, and even \*gasp* welfare/healthcare is wrapped up in that."
5101,It's also one of the core principals that constitutionally gives the federal government the right to institute public health and safety measures.
5102,"I mean...Washington required vaccination for his troops, and he was one of the guys that wrote the damn thing, I don't think you're arguing on very solid ground trying to challenge the constitutionality of vaccine mandates."
5103,I didn’t say it wouldn’t weaken transmission if everyone was fully vaccinated and boostered on time (clearly the vaccine effectiveness wanes) - but how realistic is that?
5104,You will always have people who refuse and also people who cannot take it.
5105,"You will have people coming from other countries potentially bringing new variants with them…People who had bad side effects for days or even a true vaccine injury after their shots are not going to want a booster with the same risks every 6 months indefinitely…

In many countries the traditional 70% has been reached for herd immunity - but it’s not enough."
5106,"Also, in the UK health security report, they are showing that seropositivity for COVID antibodies (whether post-infection or post vaccine - though they can distinguish between the two) is over 96% of the adult population."
5107,Yet case numbers are high.
5108,I’m beginning to think herd immunity is simply not possible with this virus (like it isn’t with the common cold) unless we manage to vaccinate everybody - from babies to those medically exempted.
5109,"If anyone is left uncovered, variants can and will form and continue to infect people."
5110,"And variants can surely form amongst the vaccinated who do get infected and sick, right?"
5111,"We should still be getting vaccinated, of course - especially for our own health."
5112,But we need other treatments and perhaps better vaccines down the line if we really want to make this pandemic a thing of the past.
5113,"Well, he tried."
5114,But it's more probable a subnotification than hidden numbers.
5115,Yes
5116,The app is only used in clubs and bars.
5117,The data shows clubs and bars have most cases.
5118,"The conclusion is just wrong: that is like only checking yellow flowers of they are yellow, ignoring all the others."
5119,Weird.
5120,"Well, gotta trust the science.i suppose."
5121,Exact same for me.
5122,"I had chills, fever, etc for 36 hours after the second Moderna dose, but I didn't have anything for the Pfizer booster."
5123,Also got my flu shot at the same time as the booster.
5124,So the research was based off of a b/s premise that you seem to agree with so you cling to it?
5125,SHAME ON THEM
5126,**The authors support vaccination**.
5127,"They say other measures like maintaining a safe distance, handwashing, and promoting better frequent and cheaper forms of testing are needed as well:


“The sole reliance on vaccination as a primary strategy to mitigate COVID-19 and its adverse consequences needs to be re-examined… Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may need to be put in place alongside increasing vaccination rates.”"

5194,I'm tired of getting the hairy-eyeball from anti-maskers at the grocery.
5195,"Like, dude... see the cashiers?"
5196,See how they still have to wear masks?
5197,"As long as they have to wear a mask indoors, I will too."
5198,It's only fair.
5199,I heard that ivermectin will blow everything out of your system.
5200,Because the vaccines do not give that type of protection against the infection.
5201,"To simplify a lot: If a vaccine, say, halves the chance of becoming infected, but things like opening up of the society makes one 10 times more exposed to the virus, the end result is that one is 5 times more likely to get infected."
5202,"The reason we don't see such fivefold numbers is cos the vaccines are more likely to result in asymptomatic infections, which means less testing."
5203,"Also while vaccines may halve the probability of infection, it doesn't mean the probability in any given exposure drops from 65% to 15%, but something like from 2% to 1%, or in long time exposure something like from 21% to 11% (the Dutch study of spread within households)."
5204,Many other factors make a bigger difference.
5205,The seasonal variation alone was huge already before the vaccinations.
5206,Edit: the Dutch souce https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.14.21264959v1

5211,"Source: [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---booster-doses](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---booster-doses)

*The booster dosage of the Moderna vaccine is less than the 100 mcg used for the first two doses."
5212,This is because data has shown that a 50 mcg dose effectively boosts the immune protection against COVID-19.

5216,"It’s extremely calming, and I both had a better sense of him as a more well-rounded human and still liked him as a person."
5217,I felt awful after Moderna #2.
5218,The Moderna booster caused nothing more than a sore arm.
5219,"My mom had no reaction to Pfizer 1&amp;2, but felt awful after the Pfizer booster."
5220,Seems so random!
5221,"Variants and irresponsible people(using masks, social distancing etc."
5222,less).
5223,"I’m totally guessing here, but likely due to poor vaccination rates and the people have a sense of returning to normal."

5237,&gt; Subsequently boosters were torpedoed by the FDA and CDC.
5238,I think including the CDC in here is inaccurate.
5239,Pretty sure you should just be saying the FDA who ultimately are powerless because they handed the CDC a blank check and then the CDC proceeded to write the most generous possible guidance so that a very high percentage of people can get boosters.
5240,"I mean, shoot, they even opened the door for states like Colorado to say ""Due to high spread, everyone lives in a high risk environment"""
5241,Just curious but are osteopathic doctors more likely to recommend things like this?
5242,It could be coincidence but it seems like I see D.O.

5252,That’s exactly What the Big Apple desperately needs in order to avoid another disastrous pandemic like they had last year 😷 🍏 🍎
5253,Sounds like one of the big reasons for increased infections everywhere is waning immunity - if it has been more than 6 months boosters are needed.
5254,"Combine waning immunity with no covid restrictions, anti vaxxers and more time spent indoors in winter and this is what we get."
5255,Rodgers is a moron.

5276,But must people don't do that.
5277,"They just read the headline that says, ""FDA and CDC reject Pfizer's request to approve boosters for all adults"" and think, ""well shit, I guess I can't get a booster."""
5278,AND THEN THEY NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN.
5279,"The FDA and CDC have fumbled the messaging time and time again during this pandemic, and at this point it's inexcusable that they're still getting it so wrong so consistently."
5280,So why are covid numbers so high?

5379,This is a Win-Win.
5380,Also the number of deaths last weak was higher than in the same week a year ago and we have less ICU beds available because we have less people to care for the patients.
5381,I can't shake the feeling it will be worse than last year even though we have vaccines.
5382,I am vaccinated and don't want another 'lockdown' (honestly those we had were not real lockdowns like in other countrys).
5383,But when the cases go on like this I fear even 2G won't do it.
5384,I went in to get my booster today and the guy who administered it put the bandaid on *first* and then injected me through the bandage.

Other authorities like german RKI even recommend boostering after j&amp;j as soon as 4 weeks after the shot."

5690,*
5691,I am concerned then.
5692,Well the US is the least vaccinated of the wealthy countries in the world.
5693,This is terrible information.
5694,"The largest benefit of vaccination is to prevent transmission,  and this is especially true of people who are at so low risk they don't care about being infected and may not even notice if they are contagious."
5695,There's no actual research supporting more than one vaccine dose after infection though.
5696,"We know the second dose at up to three months is useless, but it's likely another dose later is helpful."
5697,"It's safe to wait for now,  though."
5698,Maybe it’s because I’ve extensively studied cult leaders and his personality kind of moves along similar lines.
5699,He’s intelligent enough to the point where it’s not for his own good because it’s reached a point of misapplication of its use.
5700,He a huge self inflated ego coupled with it.
5701,"He fancies himself in this weird introspective way and thinks it makes him more special, one who thinks outside the norm."
5702,Football was a good place for him in the fact it ties up tons of his time and he will encounter enough other players with huge egos to balance him out a bit.
5703,The one problem is since he’s good at football it further inflates his ego because he gets the treatment and attention he thinks he deserves and that he’s better than everyone.
5704,"Watch his interviews, if you try not to conflict with him he will try and come off as a down to earth kind of nice friendly guy and as long as he isn’t challenged he can walk that line well."
5705,This post appears to be about vaccines.

5709,"Yes, FFP2/N95 and usually, surgical masks are still allowed."
5710,I never said anything about anti-vaxxers in my last comment.
5711,Also the ACLU is a not-for-profit lobbying organization.
5712,They are controlled by their biggest donators to pass an agenda.
5713,That's literally all it is meant to do.
5714,They don't make money by winning court cases.
5715,"Also, obviously all the pipedreams about how endemic COVID will change the society is just bullshit, similar to what people posted early on in the pandemic."
5716,"Those fairytales about how people would stop eating in the restaurants, voluntarily restrict contacts, voluntarily wear masks when the restrictions expire and so on."
5717,"In reality, England - and slightly earlier, Netherlands and Denmark - show that once mask mandates are lifted, barely anyone wears masks anymore."
5718,"And full airplanes of tourists, full restaurants etc."
5719,testify that the vast majority of vaccinated people don't have the fears that could drive a change in behavior.
5720,"In reality, we will accept that everyone will at some point get infected, accept a higher death count, and move on."
5721,"Responding to your claims here since I am a Coronavirusdach reader, but they basically decided to be a NoCovid echo chamber."
5722,[deleted]
5723,"&gt; Vaccinations are super important, but I doubt they will stop the pandemic."
5724,The only thing that will (maybe) safe our ass medium to long term are better drugs.
5725,"We may not really understand why, but every other respiratory pandemic in recorded history ended after ~2-5 years without vaccines."
5726,"Our hope with vaccines was to end it faster and with less illness and death, but it's not like it's going to go on forever without them."
5727,"For whatever reason (probably prior immunity from repeated exposure/getting sick/those who can't handle it dying off), eventually new infections level out."
5728,"Drugs show promise to make illness from the disease much less dangerous, but they only get used after someone is already known to be infected, so it's unlikely they'll have any significant impact on the spread and therefore on the course of the pandemic."
5729,If nothing else this will be a good experiment to see what happens when only vaccinated people are out and about.
5730,My take is that it likely won’t change anything and the rates will stay just about the same.
5731,"Hey, we're currently at low-teens deaths per day instead of low thousands."
5732,We're doing insanely well for how large we are and how much time we spend trapped in sealed tubes.
5733,I wish the pro-virus crowd would boycott a grocery chain in the USA.
5734,That would make it a great place to shop!
5735,"Guys, shut up!"
5736,"All I want is for complete idiots to finally get vaccinated, too."
5737,"If this is what it takes, I'll run em a bath personally."
5738,That's what Friday shots are for.
5739,If Pfizer kicks your ass try Moderna.
5740,"Actually catching COVID is probably more PTO than shot side effects, no?"
5741,[removed]
5742,Kinda yes.
5743,Influenza=Flu and Covid19 are different respiratory infections.
5744,A covid19 shot protects against the sars-cov-2 virus and flu shots protect against 4 different influenza viruses.
5745,"Each year influenza viruses mutate, therefore you have to renew your flu shots every year."
5746,The strains of coronaviruses and influenzaviruses are not related though.
5747,Its rather a cats and dogs kinda analogy.
5748,Candy cigarettes are cigarettes.
5749,It's literally a breeding ground for whatever bullshit they want to push today.
5750,"They find 3 people who said something ""Outrageous!"
5751,""", and act like thousands of people are doing it."
5752,This is literally textbook manufacturing consent.
5753,Nonsense.
5754,"If you *stay out of the way* and *know what to fucking order before you get in line*, you're a certified genius like me."
5755,Why did vaccines have such a short 3 week delay in the first place.
5756,It sounds like the booster dose is more like a proper 2nd dose like for those who took J&amp;J.

5766,Both places I went to did this to me.
5767,They were not CVS or Walgreens though.
5768,Local places.

5770,"i'm not kyrie, but i am kyrie"
5771,"yes, and?"
5772,this isnt really a discord to stiko statements.
5773,he starts with saying he doesnt want to create discord.
5774,"he further said boostering is a medium term strategy, long term but more important is to get people to take their firsts."
5775,"vaccination sites closed, half of GPs stopped to vaccinate."
5776,thats an issue.
5777,this cant be resolved in a few weeks.
5778,"have you seen this:
https://twitter.com/OlafGersemann/status/1457812558929285123
stiko is renewing their statements again and again once new evidence drops in."
5779,"we can discuss 4/5/6 month regimens all day but this doesnt change the reality, we are way behind shedule even for the 6 month vaccinated, this is the reality now."
5780,Pretty sure his handicap would be of the mental variety.
5781,I have to admit it has been disheartening to hear about people who have had three shots and still ended up really sick with COVID recently.
5782,Anyone else have people in their lives who got really sick with COVID after having three shots?

5846,"Ah, that’s what I assumed, that all production was being consumed with Covid vaccines at the moment."
5847,"Something for down the road, I suppose."
5848,"That's bullshit, which mod?"
5849,until integer overflow occurs.
5850,It's not really like that at all.
5851,Plenty of work places have had weekly testing throughout the pandemic and it has worked effectively.
5852,Daily testing is overkill.
5853,Let me make one think clear.
5854,Theirs a lot of great osteopathic physicians.
5855,Some are better than a lot of md’s.
5856,But that has nothing to do with md vs do it’s just cause of who the person is.
5857,Since DO schools are easier to get into.
5858,Which is a fact.
5859,You do from time to time see some people such as this person who make a complete mockery of the profession.
5860,However there has been plenty of MD’s who have done that as well.
5861,It’s just I think we tend to remember DO’s that fuck up more because there isn’t as many of them.
5862,We may see more do’s spreading misinformation than actually treating people.
5863,I’ve never actually been to a DO physican for my care but I’ve gone to plenty of MD’s.
5864,So when we see do’s spreading misinformation we just blame the degree or something.
5865,However when we see mds doing that we just say that the doctor is crazy.
5866,I wonder if the person behind the tiktok video did this with that outcome in mind.
5867,"Either way, I’m kind of in the mood for a bath now."

5877,"Denn wir sehen ja, dass 
der Impfschutz nicht mehr so belastbar ist, schon nach 
drei, vier, fünf Monaten, und nicht erst plötzlich nach 
sechs Monaten verschwunden ist."

5894,One woman is encouraging people to consume large quantities of borax (a cleaning product banned in many countries).
5895,I have a suspicion that some of these people aren't even normal con artists.
5896,They're actively trying to kill people for fun.
5897,Could be a difference between signing up online for an appointment vs a walk-in too.
5898,"If you already have an appointment, they likely care less who you are or about your eligibility because the system should have figured that out already."
5899,"I ended up getting mine a couple weeks ago in NY (not NYC) at a CVS in Target after making an appointment online, no questions asked - and I'm not really in any specific demographic."
5900,And I was oddly just 2 days short of my 6 month mark too.
5901,They don't have to work that hard to have that look.
5902,Doctors  and pr vax people don't want you to know this trick!
5903,"80 million Germans, 30% unvaxxed."
5904,Makes 20 Million to burn through.
5905,And since vaxxed people only protect themselves from hospital they dont really count on herd immunity.
5906,"I understand what I learned in my poli-sci classes about how the government works and is set up but if there are any hidden things that even the media aren't picking up on, or if somehow this is a language barrier (because I speak multiple languages) and I'm missing a piece of information, care to share?"

5921,Germany should just made the Covid vaccination mandatory.
5922,In the past the smallpox vaccination was mandatory and nowadays every school child has to be vaccinated against measles.
5923,"So it should be legal to make a Covid vaccination mandatory, too."
5924,The politicians are just too idiotic and cowardly to do what is best.
5925,All because they fear that antivaxxers might not vote for them when the next elections come around.
5926,"So many lives could be saved, if they would be more concerned about saving lives than losing votes."

5937,The problem is that the FDA and CDC should be relied on to make *medical* decisions but not *policy* decisions.
5938,"For boosters, the first question should be, ""Are they safe and do they noticeably increase immunity?"""
5939,"If the answer is ""Yes"" then everything from there should be focused on how to distribute the boosters."

6043,CDC can't really release the app.
6044,"At some point some people got paranoid that federally tracked vaccinations would lead to some sort of national ID / vaccine passports / excuse for expanding Big Brother / mark of the beast or some other similar concern, and the people who were in charge when the vaccination strategy was initially created were receptive to these complaints."
6045,So the federal government ceded vaccine tracking to the states.
6046,"Different states have different ideas as to their vaccination strategy and different ideas as to reporting and record keeping, so it is up to the individual states to release their own apps."
6047,"Alternatively Congress could pass national standards on the record keeping and make the states report their information to the CDC so the CDC can keep track and make a national app, but I would not hold my breath waiting for that to happen anytime soon."

6093,Can you elaborate?
6094,&gt; We're already struggling with administering booster shots atm because due to medical lobbyism vaccination centres closed.
6095,Yeah such a shame.
6096,That was about the payment for the vaccination where doctors saw the centers as competition.
6097,However I can tell that many people do a great job.
6098,The people at my GP are literally working their ass off to cover everyone.
6099,The medical system needs to stop calling it 'ethical' to let this happen.
6100,They use ethics to avoid making actual decisions.
6101,That isn't such an issue when there is sufficient resources.
6102,But when people are going to die based on the share of the scarce medical attention they receive its time for society to defend itself from idiocy.
6103,"Based on the percentages of people who get the vaccine when they are about to get fired, I suspect vaccinations would go way up if those who were unvaccinated were only offered palliative treatment for covid when icu capacity is stretched."

6136,HOWEVER...with the risk of covid a lot of people feel the normal flu is anything to are about much these days.
6137,Like I am finding a lot of people not care about flu anymore.
6138,Authoritarian doesn’t necessarily equal bad.
6139,"In this case, these idiots have had months to get vaccinated."
6140,They did not.
6141,They are a risk to others and ALSO the most at risk group for the disease.
6142,So?
6143,Isolate the dumb dumbs.
6144,"They’re still free to do a lot, they just can’t do everything unless they get vaccinated."
6145,It’s no different than being unable to drive drunk or having to drive on a certain side of the road in a particular direction dude.
6146,“Insanely” authoritarian would be forcing them to remain quarantined indoors while not allowing them to leave the house at all.

6155,"They have different origins but are largely similar in what they suggest, the downplay of the vaccines' efficiency - extremely high against any relevant outcomes - and the fondness of restrictions."
6156,I don't think it makes sense to talk of them as different entities at this point.
6157,"Fortunately the NoCovid scientists have no political influence in Germany, and neither do the red-dots, ""not-just-a-number""s, ""we-are-not-doing-enough""s on Twitter."
6158,Maybe let's solve our current problems first and then think about the future?
6159,The restrictions are there because there is no other way to gain control of the situation
6160,And the police union is always so easy to work with.
6161,"They can still participate in the essentials of life, like going to the grocery store and work."
6162,"They just can't go to restaurants, movies, etc."
6163,Does that sound reasonable to you?
6164,"I think they could legally do it, but I suppose it would probably require a contract renegotiation, so probably logistically quite difficult."
6165,This virus is wired and I think anyone who says can predict future waves is lying.
6166,"In Hungary we had zero restrictions since June and no checks whatsoever at the borders, no registration required."
6167,Remember those full stadium Euro 2020 games.
6168,Masking is still not required.
6169,We had COVID free summer and cases started to rise like a month ago.
6170,Now it's skyrocketing.
6171,"I have no idea why we had so low cases all summer, it's definitely not because of government measures, or high vaccination rates (around 60% now)."
6172,Old and seriously ill people die in thousands every flu wave.
6173,Nobody introduces society-wide restrictions because of this.
6174,Restricting 83 millions because some people don't want to vaccinate or won't use the booster opportunity in the coming time is impossible.
6175,The old people are now able to get boosters.
6176,The only thing the government should do in regards to the vaccinated is to deliver boosters to as many people over 60 as possible in the coming months.

6195,This is design feature of federalism in the US.
6196,The individual state departments of health issue the vaccine requirements and tracking features.
6197,There isn’t a national healthcare network but 50+ different healthcare networks.
6198,So the CDC would have to grab the data from the individual state department.
6199,If you test 25% more you will find more cases.
6200,Those 42% increase could partly explained by the 25% more testing.
6201,Your calculation is sketchy.
6202,Edit: 200%?
6203,"Yeah, here in Canada, our antivaxxers didn't even know what the restrictions were."

6341,India has like 1.4 billion people so naturally it will have a ton of covid deaths.
6342,Per capita though European countries still appear to have a higher death toll when taking population differences into account which is likely due to the ageing population of Europe.
6343,Although at the same time Indias death count is also likely to be an under count.

6364,Has anyone seen data on Pfizer after 2x Moderna?
6365,I was previously infected and went and got the booster.
6366,I got infected in March 2020 way back at the start of all this madness.
6367,I got J&amp;J in March 2021 and got Moderna booster a few weeks ago.
6368,I will admit the only reason I got the booster is because I'll be traveling over the holidays otherwise I probably would've skipped it.
6369,Good point!
6370,Trump showed the Republican Party that spite was a more powerful motivator for Republican voters than any plank in the Republican platform.
6371,"Unlike Democrats, Republicans actually care about winning elections and are willing to give their voters exactly what they want, no matter how harmful or toxic it is."
6372,Because right now the current vaccines appear to still be highly effective against Delta.
6373,Our main issue right now is waning immunity after around 6 months which is why Delta is taking a hold across many countries now.
6374,So the final wave is coming?..........
6375,Yeah lol that’s the point.

6390,"Its a known fact that under high incidence even vaccinated people should mask up, e.g."
6391,guidance of the CDC.
6392,Some people are under the impression once vaccinated they dont have to care anymore.
6393,For them everyone unvaccinated is stupid or an antivaxxer.
6394,"They exclude people whos immune system doesnt work properly, heavy burden on hospitals once the incidence is high, which will cause even vaccinated, who need ICU for other reasons to suffer."
6395,The matter is more complicated than black n white.
6396,Europe is an current example of what unfortunately happens with low vaccination rate and indoor activities under delta.
6397,"Obviously some measures like using masks for everyone seems reasonable while putting ""lockdown"" on unvaccinated while vaccinated have more freedoms, as currently on plan in germany, it depends on incidence, hospitalisations etc."
6398,The vaccinated can not be excluded from infection chains albeit they play a smaller role.
6399,"I recommend reading the comments here: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/py05pd/no_significant_difference_in_viral_load_between/

Your post is known and heavily discussed."
6400,"While viral load is similar it has to be said that vaccinated people less often get infected, are infected for a shorter time and less often show symptoms."
6401,If you cough you obviously transmit more viruses.
6402,This study can be interpreted that vaccinated can be a risk for the unvaccinated in a mixxed setting where only the unvaccinated are tested but both have access.
6403,"They then may be infected, less likely, but still, from the vaccinated."
6404,"However the vaccinated are less likely to infect, to get infected and to get severily ill.
EDIT: Forgot to add that testing is still useful."
6405,Are there mask mandates there?
6406,Just trying to compare to where I am.
6407,OP says we should not ‘focus’ on case data and I took that to mean that we should not consider it.
6408,For the reasons listed in my post I think that would be a mistake.
6409,My point that case data matters and it should be collected and made transparent.
6410,The best policy choices to make based on that data is another matter.
6411,"WRT that, you’re right that most cases in vaccinated people are mild but if we had stopped tracking we wouldn’t now appreciate the value of boosters."
6412,“Absolutely tiny’ is opinion not data and only feels true from a great height.
6413,"About 2% of people are blond, ~.2% are Jewish, small children can’t yet be vaccinated."
6414,A small percent of a large number is a large number.
6415,"Again, policy is based on data but separate from it."
6416,I strongly believe that we need the data.
6417,What’s effective and practical to do with that data is as you say open to debate.
6418,Then the pharmacy isn't following the guidelines.
6419,"Plus, they are not entitled to ask for proof of your medical history."
6420,Pick any reason.

6425,"- Seasonal effects, the cases in Germany skyrocketed last year around the same time."
6426,"- Also, we recently had a federal election and now a caretaker government that cannot make any fundamental decisions."
6427,- Parents are very reluctant to get their kids vaccinated.
6428,"Corona is ripping through schools

- The East is still reeling from communisms and a big minority will not listen to anything the state says."
6429,- Country is a major transportation and traffic hub for continental Europe and is bordering CEE states like Poland and Czechia who have even higher numbers.
6430,Or Austria.
6431,- And the lockdowns during last winter worked which means a smaller percentage infected than say in the UK.
6432,More fuel to the fire for this season.

6455,Google said he had a 3.8 GPA.
6456,Unless you can produce his high school transcripts you are being equally as ignorant as A-A-Ron right now.
6457,That's months old.
6458,"We know that breakthrough infections with Delta - but not with any previous variant - have similar presymptomatic levels of contagiousness to unvaccinated infection,  but resolve much faster."
6459,Get your third dose.
6460,Definitely safe.
6461,"Pfizer booster after j&amp;j is best,  especially for older people."
6462,But sinopharm is great if it's what's available.
6463,"This, however, also means that non-life saving operations will be postponed to keep a last reserve of ICU beds."
6464,Which in turn means people e.g.
6465,"suffering from cancer, will die because the needed operation comes too late."
6466,Not according to his Wikipedia bio.
6467,"&gt; Not from the US, but my understanding was that in the US, pretty much everyone could get a booster?"
6468,Am I wrong?

6470,It's 65 and over.
6471,"And 18-65 if you have a condition from a long list (which includes hypertension and BMI over 25, those two are like three quarters of adults)."

6473,"And I think 12-18 is also not approved, but we have a lot of them 6 months out now."
6474,No one checks any of this and you can just lie.
6475,But that was true in August.

6483,It was sobering to see sets of records where a dozen or more people (including infants) in the same parish all died in the span of a few days bcause scarlet fever or something ripped through the local villages.
6484,Don’t tell them.
6485,"In fact, tell them that if they where a mask for two weeks after their second dose, it will starve the vaccine of oxygen and kill it."
6486,"German head of state similarly stated ""What else has to happen for you to take the jab?"""
6487,"It's not yet dire, but the pandemic is ripping through the country like a wildfire."
6488,"Mostly because a big minority feel too entitled to get vaccinated, but also because the country had a federal election a couple of weeks ago and no government has yet been formed."
6489,Merkel is now heading a caretaker government that is expected to not institute any big changes.

6497,Numbers are already going up in my area and we’re not even to Thanksgiving yet.
6498,"A lot of folks won’t even get their first shot, let alone a booster so just take care of what you can take care of."
6499,Shhhh!!
6500,Don't tell them.
6501,It's getting them vaccinated.
6502,CDC is quite clear about masks even for vaccinated if incidence is higher than 50 or positive rate over 8%.
6503,"&gt; If you’ve been fully vaccinated:

&gt; You can resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic."
6504,"To reduce the risk of being infected with the Delta variant and possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission."
6505,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

6506,Well yeah!
6507,"In the last year my grocery bill has gone from around $400ish a month (for a family of 3), to easily $600+ per month."
6508,Every time I need 5 things at the store I swear it’s $100.
6509,If I fed my family processed crap I’m sure it would be cheaper.
6510,What about families who don’t have the financial access to fresh vegetables and meat?
6511,And certainly cannot afford a $200+ per month grocery bill increase.
6512,"There is a lot to blame for rampant obesity, but if we consider the holistic circumstances of most people living in poverty in the US, obesity is generally not their own choosing."
6513,Depends on the pharmacy.
6514,I’ve seen pharmacists reject boosters for people &lt;65 years old.
6515,"A lot of this type of post is what I like to call ""the end of the bell curve""."
6516,Most people are much more nuanced
6517,Anyone paying attention is reaching that point.
6518,I've already decided that my life should've ended in my car accident 5 years ago.

6522,Antivaxxers can read to start?
6523,No it's likely to be ruled that emergency regulations is outside its authority
6524,The majority of people are vaccinated.
6525,It is good economic sense to pander to the largest group.
6526,Once all the anti vax side are dead it will make even more sense.
6527,I know more people who had breakthrough infections than natural infections.
6528,It’s bigger than most people realize.
6529,I wish it wasn't so effective but here we are with some giant percentage of the population either going by headlines only or not being able to comprehend what they read and how it applies to real life.

6537,"/s  They will be too sick to stand in those lines, without food or water, to vote."
6538,Fine!
6539,What if you got Moderna for your first 2 shots?
6540,Should you get the Moderna or Pfizer booster?
6541,Really interesting to see the lack of long Covid from vaccinated individuals.
6542,I hope more data comes out on that aspect as it's a significant issue.
6543,[removed]
6544,The existing vaccines are pretty effective against delta.
6545,"But it replicates so fast that sometimes it kicks you down before your immune system can react, especially if your antibody levels have dropped."
6546,That would bump them down.
6547,When triaging you prioritize the most emergent first.
6548,"If I did, can you explain why it would be bad for me?"
6549,Specifically?
6550,Or does it just somehow seem obvious to you that it’s “not good”?
6551,Shop at Tesco then.
6552,Got it.
6553,&gt; So wouldn't someone previously infected with covid have a better immunity then?
6554,"I just read the paper, as well as the comment of the person you were talking to."

6628,Go for it!

6688,"I'm taking care of a family member with health problems, so I'm being really vigilant."
6689,One thing the pandemic taught me is that I wasn't careful enough before.
6690,"I thought I was careful, but when you have a school age kiddo, germs are part and parcel of in person school."
6691,"My kid actually loves remote learning ( not the way the school set it up, but she's in an awesome charter school now ) so in that alone we have minimized germy contact."
6692,The way schools are set up in the US kids have to go to school sick pretty often.
6693,"They tell you not to send your kids to school sick, but you can also get in legal trouble if they miss too many days."
6694,Even with a doctor's note.
6695,"I literally had a police officer show up at my house because my daughter was out for too long, even though I was sending the school a doctor's note every 3 days."
6696,I invited him to come on in and catch the flu!
6697,It's ridiculous!
6698,"I thought I had a crap immune system, but I've been out when necessary for the last several months ( vaccinated, masked, and using vivid precautions like wiping things down before bringing them in, hand washing etc.)"
6699,Not a single cold!
6700,"I'm pretty excited about it, lol."
6701,The grounds they made the 10% distinction on were so fucking absurd too.
6702,The primary consideration really seemed to be sticking it to Biden and Fauci for going ahead and saying they wanted boosters for all because the evidence had been mounting for over a month and the VRBPAC/FDA were dragging their feet.
6703,"Then the monumentally grotesque decision to say people should be denied boosters for ""mild"" infections, even though getting knocked on your ass for a week plus long covid plus transmission was a damn good reason to allow that for a vaccine as safe as these."
6704,"And what ""message"" it sent to delusional antivaxxers claiming boosters would make them not get first shots..."
6705,There was a single internet poll and they took that as gospel.
6706,That was completely nonmedical and shouldn't have been part of the decision *at all*.
6707,"Same for global vaccine equity, which very much drove the decisions of some of them."
6708,It was very hard to watch that disgrace and be confident in their judgement about anything.
6709,"Some were so fucking blatant too... ""This should prove our independence from the administration."""
6710,"Unethical asshole, making decisions out of spite."
6711,Do you think the people that believe this stuff would play Russian Roulette with a semi-automatic pistol?

6718,"If you don't feel like you were hit by a truck, it's not the flu."
6719,Got mine in IL (Chicago) on Friday.
6720,No questions asked
6721,I know nobody who's had a breakthrough infection and only a couple of people who've had natural infections.
6722,Our anecdotes should climb in the Octogon together.
6723,"Between a scientist who knows how vaccines work and some inbred on Facebook who believes conspiracy theories, I think I know who is more qualified to talk about vaccines, and it's not the tin foil hat wearing asshat who kicks a ball for a living"
6724,Some people will never understand this logic.
6725,&gt;Less than ten percent of the available beds are still free [in Hesse].
6726,That's so misleading.
6727,It's not like 90% of the beds are taken by covid patients.
6728,It's just that most hospital beds are usually taken even in normal.
6729,The actual covid occupancy rate in Hesse atm is around 15%.
6730,Your arguments are not bad.
6731,They are moronic from my point of view.
6732,I have absolutely no hope I would be able to reason with you.
6733,"There is nothing I could say or write that you would not refute, using one of the many idiotic arguments you spewed out in your previous comments."

6758,Where's Ja Rule?
6759,And it also happens in other countries - e.g.
6760,Korea and Japan have a high baseline occupancy rate and repeatedly experienced quite a lot of strain on the healthcare system over the pandemic for this very reason despite having relatively few cases.
6761,It would be a shame if someone started the claim that drinking your own urine can devaxx you...

Yeah, but those 3 people were a lot more likely to be contagious."

6780,"Well yes, but also now."
6781,No time like the present
6782,If you search for this data you'll find it.
6783,I believe Israel started raising alarms regarding Pfizer's VE against infection late summer.
6784,There were some other bits of data from other place since then as well.
6785,One you think can do is to hit up Scott G's twitter.
6786,A few days ago he had a link that showed a breakdown of Israel's cases/hospitalizations as of November 9th.
6787,The conclusion was that the 2 dose group was showing VE against infection at around 50-70%.
6788,While the boosted group was 95+.
6789,"So it's difficult to say for sure month by moth, but rom what I remember Moderna was showing similar linear regression, just from a higher starting point so to speak."
6790,In other words Moderna bought you more durability/time.
6791,The only time I've ever gone to the emergency room was for the flu in my mid-20s.
6792,"I went to an urgent care first and was so dehydrated from vomiting that even with two bags of saline, they couldn't get my heart rate down."
6793,Ended up spending the rest of the day in the hospital with several more bags of saline and a bunch of really expensive tests.

6801,Agree.
6802,I am fine if everyone gets the vaccine then has their detox bath.
6803,"what a diabolical plan

i love it"
6804,"Also, there is risk compensation."
6805,"As vaccines give protection, people do things they wouldn't before because they are safer to do after vaccination."

6807,You can think better.
6808,Think logically and mathematically...
6809,"For those who have had a booster, I got moderna for my first two shots."
6810,And then got a Pfizer for #3.
6811,"My spouse and I didn't experience ANY next-day symptoms like we did with #2 moderna (chills, muscle aches)."
6812,Just a little shoulder soreness at the injection site.
6813,Anyone have a similar experience?
6814,All I'm saying is this: it's impossible for the healthcare facilities to be as overwhelmed or more overwhelmed than any other time in the pandemic because nearly 60% of the population is vaccinated.
6815,Either that or people who are vaccinated are being hospitalized as well.
6816,We should totally support this.
6817,I want everyone to get vaccinated and then take a magic bath.
6818,I did this!
6819,They go to Croatia because Johnson &amp; Johnson is available there.
6820,"It's a 1-component vaccine, so you don't have to make 2 trips to get fully vaccinated and be eligible for the EU Green pass"
6821,"Gotta wonder what malicious, narcissistic deity they worship if they think it demands that they don't protect themselves and others from a deadly virus."
6822,"I think the leaders of most organized religions have said the vaccine is fine, haven't they?"
6823,How loose are the rules regarding fringe religious groups?
6824,"I agree with you, kind of."
6825,"The reason this whole thing has gone political is because it is an ""us vs them"" in regards to the vaccine."
6826,Things like this just reinforce it.
6827,"Aaron Rodgers doesnt take vaccine, media and everyone else scream and yell, folks who hate media run further away from taking the vaccine."
6828,"If we stopped planting these instances all over the place, it might actually help people make the decision to get the vaccine instead of ""owning the media/libs""."
6829,"&gt;	Why can’t WE ALL agree that every type of vaccine is safe &amp; effective

Because that wouldn’t be accurate?"
6830,"The vaccines you *hear about* are safe &amp; effective, because they have been found so and approved for the general population."
6831,There are vaccines which are less effective and/or have more side effects.
6832,"These are for rarer diseases and only given to people who would actually encounter them: rabies, plague, anthrax, etc."
6833,There are plenty of Free Rogerses out there.
6834,Our failing is that we are not giving them the platform they need to show other people how to live with one another.
6835,"FYI, ""almost"" is a vague term, deliberately used."
6836,Literally no point in getting a booster.
6837,According to every statistic you are at essentially zero risk.
6838,"Isnt needing an icu bed the highest level of emergency, and at that point its who is most likely to survive gets priority?"
6839,"Normal regulation takes 2 years, if you look at history of OSHA Emergency regulations, they mostly lost in court"
6840,Really?
6841,Almost 100%?
6842,Sure about that?
6843,Have any proof?
6844,It's a completely different ball game here.
6845,The US is many times the size of these EU countries.
6846,You could have a complete nightmare outbreak in NYC but things are just fine in North Dakota.
6847,"Are you about to tell people ""sorry you have to stay inside because we have a serious outbreak thousands of miles away"""
6848,I wish anti-vaxxers would publish a definitive list of places they won't go.
6849,"&gt; It’s time to stop focusing on case rates

It was time for that 9 months ago."
6850,"Most definitely; everyone knows that, when it comes to studying any type of pandemic, SCIENCE &amp; FACTS always prevail 🧪🧫 🧬 😷 📑 📖 📚"
6851,Not pretty.
6852,"I teach ninth graders in the US and behaviorally, they are stuck in 7th grade."

6860,Emergency order just circumvents the 60 day public comment process.
6861,The rule goes in effect at the start of the comment process not the end.
6862,It just pushes order out 60 days if the scotus finds that it is out of scope of an emergency order.
6863,Hardly surprising to anyone who follows the science.
6864,"Bars and clubs are indoors, people spend a long time there, often poorly ventilated, usually crowded, and loud music that makes people shout and sing."

6870,&gt;It's not an individual issue.
6871,So what issue is it then?
6872,Interesting - I’m really surprised Germany has anti vaxxers (well a critical mass of them) Maybe a lockdown like Austria for the unvaccinated will help.
6873,"I thought it may be due to a resistance to using astra Zeneca and the blood clot issue, and then a lag on Pfizer/Moderna supplies."

6875,Yea I used to work for a D1 University's Basketball team and we were required to get our flu shots.
6876,They came to the gym at a practice one day and we were told if you want to come back tomorrow you have to go get your shot before you leave today.
6877,I wonder what the efficacy of the original regimen is if you had the shots in let’s say March of this year.
6878,Are we going to see a possible winter surge of the unvaccinated AND the non-boosted?
6879,I think countries are also weighing compliance and how many shocks to the system the economy can take.
6880,You can't just keep flipping the lockdown switch up and down.
6881,People won't tolerate it.
6882,"Vaccines were seen as the way out and for those who are fully vaccinated, the risk of COVID-19 is equvilent of the flu (its why the median age of vaccinated in the hospital is around 75)."
6883,It tells you the unvaccinated are almost 100% likely to need hospitalization...
6884,What an ad campaign that would be.
6885,"""Antivaxxers have announced they are boycotting us for vaccinating Santa."
6886,"Jim, how's that going?"
6887,"[cut to celebration; joyous masked employees and shoppers dancing together with Santa to the tune of 'what a wonderful world', confetti falls as screen fades to list of items on sale this week]"""
