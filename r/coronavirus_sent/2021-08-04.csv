335,[removed]
336,[removed]
337,[removed]
338,Situations like this do help bring up the valid question of what‚Äôs decent messaging to convince people to still do asymptomatic testing post-vaccine?
339,"While testing definitely does save lives, I‚Äôm not denying that,  it feels like any push for testing now will do two things: 

a) convince a good amount of vaccinated people that the shot changes nothing and you still basically have to behave like it‚Äôs the second half of 2020."
340,This will piss off a good amount of vaccinated people.
341,"and 

b) just undermine further vaccination efforts."
342,"If unvaccinated people see vaccinated people getting tested, it‚Äôll just reinforce their stance of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù and they won‚Äôt get in line for the shot."
343,"This sub:

346,&gt;ON rare occasions people get it twice.

350,"I know, but it's not like they're battling a tobacco, drug, or food addiction."

370,Too much chance of the virus continuing to spread that way with people masks off in a confined space for an extended period.
371,Did your daughter that tested positive show symptoms?

389,Yup... we can really apply this rule to all of the USA.

391,We're not even close to it yet... NYC and LA County are still only 55%\~ fully vaccinated.

471,"And delta is so contagious that if we had kept wearing masks for the last 2 months, I think we'd still be in a similar place."
472,Why?
473,"The massive case rise last winter was primarily fueled by indoor maskless gatherings, when even many of the rule followers got fatigued."
474,So the vax people would wear masks in stores and then not wear them elsewhere because they could rightfully return to normal activities.
475,And the non vaxed would reluctantly still wear them in stores and continue normal activities like they've been doing since May 2020.
476,Delta would still come do its thing.

697,You are correct that the number of contraindications is incredibly small... A lot of the people who say they have a contraindication to getting a first dose actually don't have one.
698,"""Contraindications

CDC considers a history of the following to be a contraindication to vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines:

Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine
Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or known (diagnosed) allergy to a component of the vaccine
See Appendix C for a list of ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines."
699,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in Janssen COVID-19 vaccine."
700,"PEG and polysorbate are structurally related, and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur."
701,People with a contraindication to one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should not receive doses of either of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna).
702,"However, people with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may be able to receive Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and vice versa, provided certain measures are taken (see ‚Äúprecautions‚Äù below)."
703,"Known polysorbate allergy is no longer a contraindication to mRNA vaccination; however, known polysorbate allergy is a contraindication to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and thus, a precaution to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination."""
704,But it‚Äôs not a law it‚Äôs a private business establishing their own rules for who they let in if they find you with a fake one the most trouble that you could even legally be in is being told you to leave
705,Maybe they could quickly train the COVID patients who are just on oxygen and not yet on ventilators to care for the COVID patients in the ICUs.
706,"I mean, they're short staff but have plenty of COVID patients."
707,This seems completely reasonable to me!
708,(I should be a hospital director.)
709,Best would be to consider the whole vaccinated population of the state as cases and whole unvaccinated population as controls and see how many deaths occur in each group.
710,This would give a better picture.
711,If you read down.
712,My comment was a joke
713,To quarantine the state right?
714,They should pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
715,Because most of the rates you‚Äôre seeing with &lt;1% use total covid deaths from the start or since the beginning of the year when pretty much no one was vaccinated.
716,The more relevant data for delta would look at just the last month or last couple weeks.
717,Massachusetts having a higher rate of vaccinated would shift the numbers a bit but doesn‚Äôt explain going from 1% to 25%.
718,"Vaccines work and we‚Äôd all be better off if everyone got vaccinated, but it‚Äôs becoming clear they‚Äôre not nearly as effective against delta like everyone hoped."

885,"Vietnam had done an admirable job containing the virus for going on a year, just like China."
886,Difference is China also running the single most massive vaccination drive in parallel.
887,"Even if their vaccines are only 50% effective, and most trials show better results than that, quantity has a quality all of its own."
888,China will have an easier time trying to stamp out its outbreaks than Vietnam because almost 60% of its population has been vaccinated.
889,"China pursued a two pronged approach, but Vietnam dropped the ball in not trying to secure a supply of vaccines early."
890,Maybe they wanted to wait until prices came down.
891,Maybe due to politics it is not acceptable for them to get vaccines from China.
892,Maybe they were over confident and thought they could maintain zero covid for another few months before the bulk of the vaccines they ordered arrived.
893,"But the upshot is that delta emerged, and is so infectious that it broke through Vietnam's infection control measures."
894,"Obviously delta is also stressing China's own COVID measures, but they will nonetheless have a much better shot at it due to having so many people vaccinated and just more medical/testing resources than Vietnam could muster."

1036,No.
1037,"Some states and countries have real lockdowns - only one person can leave the house for food, medical or heavily restricted exercise."
1038,Then there's NSW.
1039,"You can still go to work, up until a few weeks ago all retail was still open (people got infected from going to IKEA during 'lockdown'), you can still buy takeaway coffee."
1040,They're practically begging for months and months of lockdown and sadly people are paying the price with their lives.
1041,"&gt;The study was conducted using patient records from a number of countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Italy, Israel and Singapore."
1042,"The team screened de-identified electronic health records on the TriNetX research database for more than 70 million patients to identify two groups of 37,377 patients."
1043,"The two patient groups were then matched for factors that could influence their risk of susceptibility to severe COVID-19, including but not limited to age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, and health problems such as diabetes, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
1044,&gt;Members of the first study group had received the flu vaccine two weeks and six months prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19.
1045,Those in the second group also had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis but were not vaccinated against the flu.
1046,"The incidence of 15 adverse outcomes (sepsis; strokes; deep vein thrombosis or DVT; pulmonary embolism; acute respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome; arthralgia or joint pain; renal failure; anorexia; heart attack; pneumonia; emergency department visits; hospital admission; ICU admission; and death) within 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of testing positive for COVID-19 were then compared between the two groups."
1047,&gt;The analysis revealed that those who had not had the flu shot were significantly more likely (up to 20% more likely) to have been admitted to the ICU.
1048,"They were also significantly more likely to visit the emergency department (up to 58% more likely), to develop sepsis (up to 45% more likely), to have a stroke (up to 58% more likely) and a DVT (up to 40% more likely)."
1049,The risk of death was not reduced.
1050,There is research database.
1051,I don‚Äôt think they have identifiable recorded.
1052,Back?
1053,Did they ever stop?
1054,Like did they ever skip one?
1055,I don't think they did.
1056,"I‚Äôve been seeing ads on TV for the San Diego zoo, and was just wondering about this‚Ä¶ I wonder if ‚Äúsave the felines/primates‚Äù will be the next platform to promote vaccinations."
1057,Studies have shown it‚Äôs best to have 8 weeks between doses of Pfizer.

1063,At least your not at the point where you are kicking out the people most likely to die yet.
1064,"&gt; If there were room to change it enough to invalidate the vaccine but still be infectious (which there really isn't) 

lambda has evaded vaccinated immune response (""invalidated the vaccine) and displaced delta as the mot common variant, displacing delta (""still being infectious"")."
1065,&gt;And when's that going to be?
1066,"Late 2021 or early 2022

&gt;As long as hospitals are not overwhelmed, and people are doing their part by following the guidelines, there should be no reason to constantly lockdown when a few cases pop up here and there."
1067,"Without lockdowns, those few cases quickly become hundreds of thousands or even millions of cases, and thousands or tens of thousands of deaths."
1068,That is the reason Australia is taking this approach; to avoid a great many deaths.
1069,"People will still die even with a highly vaccinated population, but it won't be tens of thousands."
1070,"They‚Äôve handled it well thus far but delta is no joke, and their vaccines are about to be put to the test."
1071,[removed]
1072,"New Mexico is also, not the Navajo Nation."
1073,They lost a LOT of elders at the beginning of the pandemic.
1074,Something they consider to be culturally devastating to their way of life.
1075,Their elders are everything to them.
1076,"At the beginning, they had one of the worst outbreaks in the country."
1077,"So much so, that New Mexico basically quarantined the entire Navajo Nation, brought in the national guard, and literally staged supplies in and out in order to contain the spread."
1078,"So when vaccines became available, They were all over it, including buying their own stock to supplement what the federal government could bring in."
1079,"Then they brought shots to arms, rather than setting up vaccination sites only and waiting for people to show up."
1080,They went mostly door to door.
1081,Even when sometimes those doors were miles apart from each other.
1082,"So in under a year, the Navajo Nation went from one of the most deadly places to be during the pandemic, to one of the safest."
1083,Just by taking it seriously.
1084,"Once again, we have a lot to learn from the people that were here first."

It's not ethical to just let them get infected."
1099,"We need to know, CLEARLY, what is the risk of them getting diabetes or necrological problems or scaring lungs, etc."
1100,Death it's not the only worry.
1101,We are about to see large numbers of deaths due to people being turned away from lack of access due to triaging.
1102,Maybe tell them going to another states hospital is socialism and that will convince them to get vaccinated
1103,It is the right thing to do in your situation.
1104,"Well, I'm looking at it more through the lens of a teacher about to start school in a week and a half... its going to be bad"
1105,I just don't think that's very realistic with delta.
1106,But I also don't know what else they should do given their vaccine rollout
1107,"Funny how everyone, including the comment below, is now trying to paint sources like Reuters as being against Chinese vaccines."
1108,Back in March their numbers were very good compared to places like New York.
1109,"I like to compare the two state because of similar population totals, although Florida has a much older population from what I've gathered."
1110,Cumulative vaccinations in both states are about the same so it'll be interesting to see how New York fares when the Delta stain outbreak finally takes hold in the north.

1123,"The black community needs to get vaccinated, and if this is the only way to get it done, then so be it."
1124,Mmm‚Ä¶beef weiners.
1125,There's needless hypocrisy in keeping US doors closed to Europeans but Europe still open to Americans.
1126,Both have largely the same variants; about the same vaccination rates; about the same infection rates.
1127,We all should aim to live with the virus as an endemic problem.
1128,"If the US requires vaccinations, perhaps Europe will mirror that -- so in the end, it'll be a win-win."
1129,[removed]
1130,"If covid-19 was guaranteed to disappear via everyone masking and getting vaccinated, then some of the un-vaccinated would probably get vaccinated."
1131,"The science, however, shows that this virus won't go away, and people should rather learn to live with it, like their ancestors lived with and through all of the viruses that have contributed throughout the evolution of human beings to the 'on-average' 10% of DNA of the average modern human being that is constituted by that which was picked up from viruses."

1179,Besides back in WW2 there was a lot better leadership
1180,For sure.
1181,It might encourage unvaccinated people to get a vaccine if they find they are not covered by insurance if they catch Covid and get hospitalized.
1182,Not enough people are getting the vaccine to slow the spread...hence masks again.
1183,"Every mandate, step, action, etc has always been with the goal of reducing the spread (which in turn reduces drains on our healthcare system)."
1184,Florida still has over 10 mil unvaccinated people.
1185,"Thank you for doing your part, but the community of Florida has not done enough and it is showing now."
1186,Deaths are gonna skyrocket in the southeast in the next 7-10 days
1187,"The thing with Covid-19 is that in 2020, around 350,000 Americans died, out of a total population of around 330,000,000."
1188,That means only 0.1% of Americans died of the Coronavirus in 2020 in a population with essentially no vaccines.
1189,So why should we even care about Covid-19?
1190,It's clearly harmless.

That's a small subset of people with breakthrough infections (which we dont know since asymptomatic or very mild breakthrough infections probably arent tested), which is a small set of those who were exposed who also had the vaccine (which is an unknowable/untrackable number realistically), which is a small subset of those who actually have the vaccine (4.3 million)."

1651,They need to be back in the classroom with their peers but I just don‚Äôt see how the schools can possibly manage with delta.
1652,It‚Äôs a terrible situation and I‚Äôm hoping the school will offer a remote option but I doubt they will.
1653,Nope never said that.
1654,Also please don't assume my gender.
1655,Have a nice day
1656,"But not because they're understaffed, because the nr."
1657,of cases just kept going up and nobody did anything to stop it.
1658,You‚Äôre not alone and always relieved to hear someone else who thinks in exactly the same way.
1659,I got my second shot like 10 months ago and was on a flight a few weeks ago.
1660,You will be fine
1661,This absolutely makes sense.
1662,"Just like if you ""smoke"" or have other unhealthy lifestyle choices (being Obese and diabetes, for example) cause your rates to go up."
1663,"Same should be for unvaccinated, no matter what."
1664,"Sure, if you have a valid religious reason (that has to be vetted) you can get some exclusions, but those would be case-by-case."
1665,"But to be fair, the immunocompromised people I know already have crazy insurance rates, so maybe no exceptions."
1666,Hit the anti-vaxxers where it hurts.
1667,"That's where they make their money, the bikes are a

1668,&gt;The issue isn't kids getting COVID.
1669,The issue is my not being able to force my personal opinions onto my children and your children in school.
1670,"If you're going to make my kid wear masks, like the CDC recommends, how am I going to continue exerting influence over them?"
1671,"I will appear weak and without any control, and this tiny toddler is my ticket to feeling strong in charge."

1679,I think you have a good point.
1680,TBH I've never even thought of getting an annual flu shot because I didn't realize they're free.
1681,It was only some comments around the covid vaccine that let me know otherwise.
1682,And yes I will be doing that going forward.
1683,This came up last summer.
1684,"The term is ""rationing care""."
1685,But‚Ä¶why do that though?
1686,I can‚Äôt control the unvaccinated.
1687,I am vaccinated and am truly done avoiding indoor gatherings and not wearing a mask.
1688,"It will never end - not everyone will get vaccinated, and there‚Äôs a high chance in the next few years we all get a mild illness from this."
1689,May as well start loving your life now.
1690,I got J&amp;J in March and it fucked me up for three days
1691,tl didn't understand: the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines do not use those cell lines at all.
1692,Here's an article I found that might provide some consolation.
1693,"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/false-negative-how-long-does-it-take-coronavirus-become-detectable-pcr

It seems the maximum number of days to test positive is up to 28 depending on whether you're symptomatic or asymptomatic."
1694,I would suggest to evaluate your symptoms and get the test maybe a week before your trip.
1695,"If you test negative, you're good."
1696,"If not, the worst case is to reschedule your flight or cancel it."
1697,Some airlines might allow you a full refund or rebate if you can provide sufficient documentation you have Covid-19 and don't want to risk others on the flight.
1698,Nothing you said is completely wrong but there exists many safe guards that prevent refrigeration errors on vaccine shipments that you might not be aware of.
1699,I can't comment on Moderna but when you receive a Pfizer shipment there is a temperature sensor that has a button.
1700,Once you push the button the temperature sensor sends the person on the receiving end of the shipment an email that shows the temperature logs for the entire duration of the shipment.
1701,"It also changes the color of a light on the device, if it turns green you can start using the vaccine immediately."
1702,If it doesn't turn green you must await further direction and the temperature log to determine that the vaccine is safe to administer.
1703,If it turns red you assume the vaccine is bad but you don't throw it away until you hear from administration and review the logs.
1704,"No, this last wave broke a lot of hospital staff emotionally."
1705,"It's been too much, especially because a lot of this was preventable with vaccines."
1706,The article is trying to make it sound like pay is the only issue
1707,No.
1708,I have lots of arguments.
1709,"But the fact that you just stated what you've stated and actuallybelieve that, shows that no amount of argument or proof or anything will get through."
1710,"Therefore, you're nothing more than a huge waste of anyone's time."
1711,The spite and vitriol are coming from all sides to every other side.
1712,We have to stop or we will destroy what's left of civilization.
1713,I had just about come to the same decision for my vaccine hesitant teen daughter.
1714,I'd picked last weekend to sit her down and drop the bad news on her that I was going to make her get vaccinated.
1715,She tested positive last Saturday.
1716,Second case.
1717,Wrong.
1718,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-viral-claim-gets-bidens-covid-19-travel-and-immigration-policies-wrong/
1719,I'd really like to see a vaccine for the younger kids.
1720,Really soon would be nice.
1721,"That‚Äôs a fair point, and I don‚Äôt mean to conflate the 99% number with efficacy."
1722,"But it‚Äôs a useful indicator to judge how, and among which populations Delta is spreading right now, when society is pretty much operating normally."
1723,"You‚Äôre absolutely right that not everyone has the same risk or exposure, but things are opened up and at full capacity, and the fact that states are breaking hospitalization records and there are no reported breakthrough cases in 99.9% of the fully vaccinated population still provides some very real insight - and puts it into perspective for a lot of people that may be worried - even if it‚Äôs not the same as efficacy, which is a much more nuanced and shifting."
1724,It‚Äôs almost like flying a ton of people from all over the world and cramming them into a condensed space for weeks during a pandemic was a bad idea.
1725,*Almost*
1726,I'm fine with this
1727,Hard to believe we are talking about opening schools in a few weeks in states where g0v∆ê n0rs have signed orders prohibiting mask and vaccine mandates.
1728,Schools should be phucking closed.
1729,Any symptoms?
1730,I don't believe we're truly catching all cases in the vaccinated population.
1731,We aren't doing contact tracing and many asymptomatic vaccinated people aren't getting tested.
1732,Which is not necessarily a contradiction to Israel findings.
1733,"Israel didn't use Moderna and started vaccination in January, so 7+ months 

Moderna says they are 93% against delta and like 90% 6 months later overall, but is that same at 7months since vaccinated?"
1734,Where was their effectiveness claims based on with regards to location and variants?
1735,"I‚Äôm aware of all that, it should happen anyway."
1736,"But the stupid in America always win, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not shocked."
1737,"In other words, you have no argument because you know you're wrong"
1738,It is easy and free to get vaccinated.
1739,Not getting vaccinated makes you far more likely to not only spread the disease but also take up medical resources that everyone depends on should you get seriously ill. We all suffer consequences for the willfully unvaccinated.
1740,"It is incredibly selfish and stupid not to get vaccinated if you are able to, it is no wonder people are spiteful."
1741,This article is fantastic and explains how the secretory IgA molecules create a shield to protect the antibodies from being degraded by the digestive system while also providing a protective coating for the digestive system and other mucosa.
1742,It also delves into several other components of breast milk that provide a protective barrier or disrupt disease processes.

1750,Wow.
1751,You're just full of incredible knowledge.
1752,What a waste of time you are.
1753,Truly.
1754,You‚Äôre still not stating facts lol
1755,"Walmart near me to mandate for the mask on friday, so here comes all guy and women Karens, and hoarding of toilet paper."
1756,"The breakthrough cases I keep reading about seem to be mild, or less."
1757,I am glad you guys did good with infection as far as severity.
1758,This is a tricky beast we can not seem to get ahead of.
1759,"&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for sharing your experiences."
1760,This is a discussion better suited between you and a medical professional who knows your health history.
1761,Leopards ate her face
1762,"I have heard about a possible booster but would that be for all the vaccines used here; J&amp;J, Pfizer and Moderna?"
1763,"&gt;vaccinated folks are wayyy less likely to catch it in the first place

I think there are far more asymptomatic cases amongst the vaccinated than we are currently counting."
1764,I've seen it ravage through a group of vaccinated people and not all got tested.
1765,The only ones that did had pretty bad symptoms.
1766,I take that as 3 different boosters that they're now testing out.
1767,Not the same shot.
1768,"Uk also had much longer gaps between jabs which would normally be expected to boost effectiveness, so data may also not be comparable because of that"
1769,"4,331 today in NC."
1770,Sadness.
1771,Yes.
1772,Same with smokers.
1773,But who is manufacturing it?
1774,Could they instead be manufacturing more of the human doses?
1775,My brother in law (with help from my sister basically telling him his options were to get it or he can sleep on the couch) and two of his three brothers have also gotten it.

1777,Class action lawsuit and Texans love there class action attorneys
1778,"Maybe I missed something, but I don't think this is implying that effectiveness suddenly drops after 6 months, just that current data shows that you're still good after 6 months and beyond 6 months there isn't enough data yet."
1779,[removed]
1780,"Thanks, it has a 99% survival rating so I should be good, if it gets me, oh well, world will keep turning."
1781,"I couldn't tell you where from, but it was always my understanding that the vaccine gave 6 months coverage."
1782,I'm not saying that's right.
1783,Just is my perception for whatever reason.
1784,I'm going to avoid the third rail of dispensing medical advice.
1785,Consult a medical professional.
1786,These studies are preliminary.

1799,There is nothing special about delta in that regard.
1800,"Please stop saying ""delta"" in this context as all SARS-CoV2 infections can cause these problems-- delta isn't some magically worse illness."
1801,"That being said, the Lancet study has some major caveats and issues that need to be addressed."
1802,Have you read the Lancet study directly?
1803,"[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext)

I don't doubt that people who've been intubated exhibit cognitive issues."
1804,Severe inflammation and intubation in general are associated with cognitive declines.
1805,Whether someone who's vaccinated who gets a mild case is going to go full-Flowers for Algernon is really different.
1806,Huge logical leap here.
1807,"And if you look at the lancet study directly, the data on people with mild cases are almost certainly demonstrating no statistically significant or meaningful decline."

1809,Now if only someone through these lines in a song 50 years ago‚Ä¶.
1810,We might be onto something.
1811,"People are freaking out about delta because it tore India a new one, and now it's cranking through the US in numbers we haven't seen since Jan/Feb."
1812,It's not just idle fear or something the media dreamed up.
1813,"That said it will peak and in the meantime, we will keep vaccinating."
1814,This sounds fascinating.
1815,Can you go into a bit more detail?
1816,I understand if you'd rather not.
1817,"Okay yeah that definitely makes more sense, especially in context to what Biden is specifically saying here, I agree that it's a tragedy that many unvaccinated died when it could have been prevented."
1818,Yeah I think that's where my misunderstanding was.
1819,I think what's got my mind spinning is how a lot of people (especially in my circles) are equating the US un-vaccinated population directly to the fact that Covid hasn't been completely eradicated.
1820,Actual comment thread I saw on my state health department socials about the insane number of hospitalizations.
1821,Person A:  We need to know how many of these people have comorbidities.
1822,(Common tactic to minimize covid.)
1823,"Person B:  Our state has the highest rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and unhealthy lifestyles so uh most of them."
1824,Person A:  I know healthy people can get covid but we need to know about comorbidities.
1825,What baffles me is there are people working the front line [who do not want to get vaccinated](https://old.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/ovuld6/healthcare_workers_protesting_the_vaccine/)
1826,That's why they've apparently hired marketing professionals.
1827,"You haven't heard of the ""Delta plus"" variant?"
1828,"Soon to be called ""Delta gold"", then ""Delta black"" and finally (before transitioning to Echo) ""Delta prime""..."
1829,There was another Bratwurst-vaccination last week in the Thuringian town Sonnenberg already.
1830,More vaccinations on that day than on the other days.
1831,I think we should make this Bratwurst-tour through all of Germany.
1832,"It seems, that we can fetch some more vaccinations with that tactic."
1833,how did they get around FDA/approval issues?
1834,Well honestly we really don't need a delta booster.
1835,The fear for vaccinated people is WAY overblown when it comes to delta.
1836,"Yes, you're more likely to actually get sick but you're not  in any real danger of dying if you've had your shots."
1837,"I have very little worry over something breaking through vaccination entirely, or at significant numbers (of deaths, I don't care about infections much)."
1838,"But, getting a booster of the current variants will just make your immune response even more varied and robust."
1839,So it's certainly something worth pursuing.
1840,"I see so many people on this sub slam the CDC for removing the mask mandate guidance, but..."
1841,I don't really get it?
1842,There were roughly 2 months between the updated guidance and the current surge where 1) there were incredibly low (and declining) case rates and 2) vaccines were freely available for anyone age 12+.
1843,"Even if the CDC would have continued insisting everyone wear masks, would people have listened?"
1844,Particularly in low-vax areas?
1845,Count me extremely skeptical
1846,"&gt;do your own research

No, don't."
1847,"That's the sort of shit that leads people to watching crazy conspiracy theorists on YouTube and calling it ""research""

Listen to what your health authorities and the vaccine manufacturers are telling you."
1848,They understand this stuff far better than you will after scrolling through a few hours of brain-meltingly stupid shit on the internet.

1854,The UK fiasco was a fiasco.
1855,The delays have been a fiasco.
1856,The inability to know anything about NV and Delta has been a fiasco etc.
1857,"It started to become clear, I thought, that they were positioning themselves to become the ""universal booster"" as a marketing strategy earlier this year and this bit of news sees to confirm that tack."

1874,"yes it did pass the trials, but just wait a few weeks and it will be fda approved, then ask what her next excuse will be"
1875,You say they are an expert in their field.

1910,They aren't saying there's any evidence the effectiveness fades after seven months.
1911,They just have enough data to make conclusions about the 6-month efficacy now.
1912,"In another month, they'll be able to report on the 7-month efficacy."
1913,Of course it is.
1914,How anti-vax people don't even think or recognize this obvious outcome is so beyond me.

1927,And that's where hospitals make money.

1930,Testing volume is 100k-150k a day.
1931,Even in Florida they wouldn‚Äôt get to a 50% positivity rate.
1932,Now how many unreported cases could they have?
1933,Who knows.
1934,Absolutely.
1935,Some of the headlines were a complete misinterpretation of the data.
1936,Yes a vaccinated person who is infected may have the same amount of virus at the start of an infection than an unvaccinated person-- but the key here is WHO IS INFECTED.
1937,"Vaccinated people are much less likely to be infected, so overall still much less likely to transmit."
1938,The info only concerns those vaccinated people who are infected.
1939,"Also the level is the same at the start of infection, but drops off much quicker in a vaccinated person than in an unvaccinated person, so would transmit for less time."
1940,"Finally, having the same amount of viral RNA on the PCR test isn't even certain to mean there is the same amount of infectious virus present in the vaccinated person-- some of it may be remnants of virus that was destroyed."
1941,&gt; The percentage of people who need immunity to achieve herd immunity varies for each disease.
1942,"For polio, about 80% of the population must be vaccinated."
1943,"The number is closer to 95% for the measles, according to the World Health Organization."
1944,This is a key point.
1945,"Since Delta is near the infectiousness of measles, you may need 95% immunity to stop widespread transmission."

1954,When are insurers going to step in and substantially increase health care premiums on the unvaxxed or possibly deny payment for a hospital stay with Covid?
1955,Smokers pay more in premiums.
1956,My company is supposed to be reopening officially on Sept 7.
1957,"However, whoever's wanted to be back in has already gone back in and we all have the ability to choose how we want our future work arrangement to be (remote, hybrid, in-office)."
1958,I wonder if they're going to change that date now.

1960,"Well science denial, anti-intellectualism, and conspiracy theories are the real root causes underlying anti-vax..."
1961,"Not delta variant specifically, but unless I've completely misunderstood something the studies are measuring the total effectiveness against any form of covid-19."
1962,"whatever variants are out there, and how common they are, are baked into the testing results."
1963,"I didn't read the article, just the headline, so maybe this was addressed somewhere in there, but..."
1964,Isn't the headline factually incorrect at this point?!
1965,"The CDC claims that vaccinated individuals can still spread the virus, but that they just have much milder symptoms...but they are still infected."
1966,So isn't the incidence rate of mutation going to remain the same in this situation regardless of if the virus is infecting the vaccinated or un-vaccinated?
1967,Or is there a paper somewhere that shows that being vaccinated prevents mutation of the virus in an individual?
1968,Hmm.
1969,"Is that ""the profit incentive is toxic to human wellbeing as a whole for every individual but good for corporations as an entity and a subset of people unwilling to share"" I hear?"

1974,"So it's really difficult to fight delta with lockdowns only, apparently."
1975,They need more vaccine doses in Australia.
1976,"Also, mandatory mass testing like in China might work to shorten lockdowns until they manage to get enough doses."
1977,What the?
1978,What?
1979,We aren't protecting just them.
1980,We are protecting children and others not strong enough to carry antibodies.
1981,"Also, we are trying to prevent this from mutating further."
1982,"I'm frustrated af, believe me."
1983,Are the insane conspiracy believers getting vaccinated at a higher rate than the science people?
1984,I think accidental still qualifies as a tax deduction.
1985,That is very American.
1986,Bet they are in the group that says masks are child abuse......

But not too sure they are factoring a lot of variables: school starting next week and cannot mandate masks even for those ages that cannot get the vaccine (Florida), many adults are flippantly against vaccines/masks in public shared spaces, etc"
1995,I wonder if they even sat down with their kids and asked them what they want?
1996,[deleted]
1997,"You‚Äôre right, I wasn‚Äôt very clear at all."
1998,"Generally, saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt ask that‚Äù is a verbal shortcut."
1999,You can ask absolutely any questions you want when hiring.
2000,You just open yourself up to a hell of a lawsuit if you ask questions that could lead the candidate to believe you are discriminating based on a protected class.
2001,So most hiring managers keep the medical questions limited to specific things that have been clearly listed as job requirements.
2002,And jobs requiring vaccines is A-OK legally.
2003,"Not quite either of those, but closer to your second guess."
2004,"That‚Äôs an efficacy number, and it describes the results of the randomized clinical experiment."
2005,"There are two groups in the experiment, those who got the vaccine and those who got a placebo."
2006,"Let‚Äôs say there are 20,000 people in both groups of the the trial."
2007,"In the placebo group 1,000 people get severe covid."
2008,"In the vaccine group, 18 people get severe covid."
2009,"So without the vaccine, we would expect 1,000 people to get severe covid."
2010,But that number shrank by 982.
2011,So our efficacy for preventing severe covid with this vaccine is 982/1000 = 0.982 = 98.2%
2012,She should consult with her doctor.
2013,"But unless she‚Äôs on immune suppressing drugs, the answer is likely going to be ‚Äúno booster‚Äù until they are approved."
2014,Moderna will be filing both their final data for full FDA approval and an EUA for boosters fairly shortly according to this morning‚Äôs press release.
2015,"In general, it appears any boosters approved for use this soon in mRNA vaxxed people will be for specific age groups and specific risk categories."
2016,"Eventually, everyone will need them, but it seems we‚Äôre not to that point just yet."
2017,I‚Äôm jumping in as someone who works on clinical trials.
2018,The COVID-19 vaccines have all gone through the same phases of trials as every other drug out there.
2019,In my opinion the single biggest reason these trials moved so quickly was money and a bolus of willing subjects.
2020,"If pharma companies could get the global buy-in for other drug trials they could move just as fast, but the normal cycle of convince investors&gt;test&gt;convince investors&gt;test&gt;convince investors again&gt;test slows things down enormously."
2021,It was obvious from the get go that there was a a global market for a successful vaccine.
2022,There are other factors for the speed as well.
2023,As I already mentioned huge numbers of willing participants for the trial.
2024,"Vaccine trials in general are also quick in general since the actual dosing is so simple, you dose and then basically just sit and wait."
2025,"Finally, as others have noted long term side effects of vaccines are infinitesimally rare, and would almost certainly show up in the first few months."
2026,"To use a metaphor I saw somewhere else, vaccines are the Snapchat of pharmaceuticals, they show your body what it needs to see and disappears."
2027,"So much for the ""UK has reached herd immunity"" theory so eagerly shared here."
2028,This doesn't sound like shaming... it sounds like sound public health policy to protect their employees.
2029,Same - a good friend and his wife came to stay with me for a few days.
2030,She tested positive two days after flying back home.
2031,She had mild symptoms but didn‚Äôt feel great.
2032,"My friend, myself and my wife all tested negative."
2033,The vaccines are doing exactly what they‚Äôre supposed to; reduce rates of infection and prevent serious illness for those who do become infected.
2034,I‚Äôll be one of the first in line when boosters are made available.
2035,&gt;I honestly don't care.
2036,"Numbers are my facts, not strawman internet arguments."

2039,That was my only point.
2040,"Politics is really the ONLY thing we disagree on, really."
2041,"Everything else, we more or less agree on, thankfully."
2042,That's how things are at my workplace.
2043,"We've worked from home this entire time without issue, no reason to rush back to the office."
2044,One of my employees just had a rough go of it and she was vaccinated.

2051,"Plus at a certain local case prevalence, just be being all vaccinated isn't necessarily enough."
2052,"Lot of sound arguments to stay remote, especially until employees kids are vaccinated and less at risk if  parent brings home a breakthrough."
2053,"At the end if the day, probably a lot of their employees are objecting to going back in soon."
2054,I saw projection last week that showed FL getting to 80k per day before peaking
2055,I've taken the general advice into consideration and seeing as how my kids are excelling in cyber school I'm going to keep them in it long after this pandemic is gone.
2056,I'm in a rather Republican district that seems to prefer to push white washing over facts.
2057,So when is this shit show over again?
2058,"And vaccinated people getting mildly sick will confer that portion of the population with Delta immunity, which drives down R and helps everyone."
2059,Yes.
2060,"It means that should you get COVID, your chances of having severe symptoms drop by 98.2%."
2061,"Lol, no nothing to do at all."
2062,Death lags hospitalization.
2063,"So if all this is on the rise, we will see what happens."
2064,I'm not saying its certain.
2065,I am just saying there is no more uncertainty than before.

2084,"What should be done is charge the unvaccinated 100% of the cost of any covid tests or treatments, whether they have insurance or not."
2085,"Dude, go check yourself at the door."
2086,I am fully vaccinated.
2087,I am not saying people should not get vaccinated.
2088,There is evidence that mRNA vaccines may be persistent for years and may be effective against variants.
2089,I am just saying I will wait and see what independent studies show as to whether or not we need a BOOSTER.
2090,These vaccine manufacturers have been pushing boosters since before there was a delta variant simply because they are seeing dollar signs.
2091,"A booster may be needed, but I am going to wait to see what doctors say, not board members."
2092,"I don't think they're upset about it not being perfect, they're upset that it could have been orders of magnitude less harmful if people had just gotten the vaccine when they had plenty of time to before it started spreading here."
2093,"Are you suggesting Biden meant ""we could have prevented the Delta variant from getting here"" when he says preventable?"
2094,I think he means the effect of it could have been a fraction of what it is.
2095,"Unless she is on mycophenolate or rituximab, it's unlikely her immune response to the vaccines was very different than someone without lupus."

2097,"&gt; If a variant lucks out with a mutation(s) which negates some antibodies, that is a positive selection in favor of an escape."
2098,It is only an advantage if it actually increases how many people a person infects.
2099,"Let's say people just die immediately if the disease a virus causes actually shows symptoms, i.e."
2100,there are no infections after symptoms start.
2101,"If you have a vaccine that prevents the symptoms, but isn't sterilizing, there is obviously no selective pressure for the virus to bypass the protection the vaccine offers."
2102,"The point is, the two effects ""the virus spreads even in vaccinated groups"" and ""the virus evolves to resist the vaccine"" counteract each other in my understanding."
2103,"The less the vaccine prevents spread, the less incentive there is for the virus to resist it."
2104,Only if the vaccine prevents or reduces spread is there selective pressure to resist the vaccine.

This uses data from Chinese studies after the initial outbreak (study from May 2020)."
2114,"But, I like this one in our context as it talks about how COVID and the cardiovascular system are related, specifically how it infects cells using the ACE2 receptors."
2115,"In layman's terms, ACE2 stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2."
2116,"These receptors are present all over the cardiovascular system, from the heart, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder, etc."
2117,"The enzyme works by catalyzing angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin (a vasodilator), and this lowers blood pressure."
2118,You may have heard of a class of medications referred to as ACE-inhibitors.
2119,"If not, that's OK."
2120,"They work in similar ways, by inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, and therefore help relax your veins and arteries."
2121,"People have heart attacks and strokes when their arteries or veins become damaged, inflamed, or otherwise not functioning properly."
2122,"If COVID is targeting the ACE2 receptor as its entry point into cells, then it would make sense that major cardiovascular issues could occur, even in previously healthy people."

2131,He‚Äôs not worth your attention.
2132,"ah, if only ppl would take a vaccine to save themselves from getting sick!"
2133,"Let us assume for a moment that this is true, and it is true that either vaccinated people are shedding ""COVID-19 viral particles"" or ""vaccine particles/by-products"" that illicit an immune response against COVID-19."
2134,80% of the people have been vaccinated now.
2135,"Unless one remained in a bubble during the entire vaccination campaign, then one was exposed to this shedding."
2136,"So, in light of that, what exactly is the argument against getting vaccinated?"
2137,That one has already been vaccinated via shedding of others?
2138,"Or that one doesn't want to shed to other people, the vast majority of whom have already been vaccinated?"
2139,"Since you raised the question, I'd like to hear from you what exactly is the point of this conspiracy?"
2140,I don't see how it can dictate any particular action against getting a vaccine.
2141,I didn‚Äôt feel the shot at all.
2142,A friend likened it to being poked with a dry spaghetti noodle but honestly I didn‚Äôt even feel that lol
2143,i suspect that the people that dont get any (or not a lot of) side effects also had a lesser immune response and thus are more susceptible yo breakthrough infections.

2169,This is coming from someone who is obese and continues to eat junk food everyday because I hate myself that much.
2170,Based off of the transmissibility of the delta variant MIT estimates you need 80-90% vaccination ***and*** NPI's such as masking or daily testing in order to be able to stop the spread.
2171,"Yeah, but they were told by Democrats and they lie anyway."
2172,You would never know if you were mishandled to begin with unless the provider figured it out themselves.
2173,If you got a more concentrated shot it appears to have no detrimental effect.
2174,Worse case scenario is you get a more diluted shot which will likely offer less protection.
2175,IMHO it's like changing your oil..
2176,I don't have the time to confirm the oil is actually good oil.. so I'll just trust the manufacturer/healthcare provider.

2272,The simple fact is the right is ignoring statistics for...for...I don't know what.
2273,I've made a pretty good living being good at math and analytics work (predictive modeling etc) and it blows my mind how hard this evidence is that's being completely ignored.
2274,"You can believe whatever you want, I honestly don't care."
2275,"Numbers are my facts, not strawman internet arguments."
2276,Thank you for this.
2277,That person‚Äôs post is ridiculous.
2278,"The US was blocking imports as well as private companies from sending out supplies to any nation, no matter what."
2279,For him to say it isn‚Äôt our fault is plain ignorance.
2280,im a pfizer boi tho.
2281,i ain't taking shit until mask culture and lockdowns chill out tho.
2282,Aint gonna let them pull the rug out from under me again.
2283,"&gt;vaccinated people shed infective viral particles

lol what?!?!"
2284,In all my 3 degrees in Biology I have never read this in any peer-reviewed literature
2285,It‚Äôs too bad we can‚Äôt just put anti vaxxers to the end of the priority list and care for people who are there for things other than COVID if they‚Äôre unvaccinated
2286,"I'm all for vaccinating everybody, but I don't understand exactly what is happening in Florida."
2287,"I don't think it is just due to low vaccination rates, since Kings County NY (Brooklyn) and the Bronx have a similar vaccination rate to all of Florida and aren't experiencing anything near what they are, despite being way more densely populated."
2288,"Maybe it is behavioral differences too, or population differences like age."
2289,It wouldn‚Äôt be for people in your situation
2290,How are boosters gonna work though?
2291,Are people gonna be expected to stay home for six weeks every six months?
2292,How is that sustainable longterm?
2293,"It‚Äôs fine for the people who can WFH, they can probably manage it, but a good chunk of the population can‚Äôt."
2294,Paralyzed yes.
2295,"Sedated, sort of."
2296,"Unfortunately my body does weird things with most drugs, and one of my late husband‚Äôs favorite stories from that time was how he got the anesthesiologist to semi-seriously consider his suggestion of getting the drugs they use to tranq tigers at the nearby zoo because nothing they were giving me to do the intubation was working."
2297,"So sedation was attempted, but mostly didn‚Äôt work."
2298,"Instead, they opted for amnesia drugs, which worked better, but not 100%."
2299,The memories I do have of those 4 1/2 days are all too clear.
2300,Having the worst migraine of your life and not being able to ask for meds?
2301,Do not recommend.
2302,"The hallucinations were entertaining, though."
2303,"Hard to say about lasting damage or pain, because severe pneumonia will do a good bit of that too, but there was some of each."
2304,"The most interesting thing was that my autoimmune condition went into temporary remission afterwards‚Ä¶as my rheumatologist put it, my immune system was too busy with the cleanup to spend its time chewing on the healthy parts of my body."
2305,"But let me tell you, the PTSD kicked in hard when they started talking about and showing the ‚Äúground glass opacity‚Äù xrays from Covid patients, because mine looked exactly like that."
2306,I wouldn‚Äôt wish the severe form of Covid on my worst enemy.
2307,I know what breathing feels like when your lungs look like that.
2308,I definitely want a better patch this time.
2309,The first one was a plain brown circle.
2310,This one better have a skull with hearts or at least a Care Bear on it.
2311,The vaccine is a headstart.
2312,"The science of this is pretty simple: the vaccine causes some cells to produce spike proteins like that of the coronavirus, the immune system mounts an immune response deploying antibodies and tailoring them to be most effective, and then these antibodies fade with time (body can't keep antibodies around for everything forever)."
2313,"If infected with COVID, the body reacts *but has a head start because it already has a blueprint for producing antibodies more tailored to SARS-CoV2."
2314,"* Antibodies are produced and deployed but their efficacy is less because some changes have occurred (changes to the spike protein), and thus the immune system must tailor its response to increase effectiveness."
2315,"Still, it didn't have to start from scratch- it already had a response that could challenge the coronavirus until it could defeat it with tailored antibodies."
2316,"If these people had breakthrough cases because Delta likes to produce so many times more virus, rest assured they'd be much worse off without the head start."
2317,This is not idiocy- this is science.
2318,You get damn near immunity following 2 weeks of your 2nd shot because antibodies are hanging around just waiting to kick corona's ass.
2319,"As they wane so does immunity, but the body has a rough blueprint to fight it if a later infection occurs."
2320,The real danger is a strain that is infectious enough to outcompete other strains AND that has a spike protein sufficiently different enough that the immune system doesn't recognize it (what is considered vaccine evasion).
2321,&gt;Free.
2322,Market.
2323,Capitalism.
2324,Exactly.
2325,Except for the whole part when the government forced health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.
2326,Who owns most of them?
2327,Is my headache communicable with a higher R rate than Smallpox?
2328,"Because if it is, you probably should take an aspirin."
2329,"If it helps, the needle is so small i litterally didnt even feel it."
2330,"The nurse said ""your done!"""
2331,And i looked over super confused because she was putting the bandaid on but i didnt even realize she had already given it to me!
2332,I have a feeling the news will fudge up the numbers for a couple reasons.
2333,Unemployment benefits are expiring in September.
2334,Evictions are also on the table as well as other protections.
2335,Businesses are tired of waiting out.
2336,"If things start looking grim again, then it wouldn't make sense to end these protections and benefits, but if things look sorta good, then fuck it let's ignore the numbers and cut everything."
2337,This literally happened under Trump multiple times.
2338,"Everytime protections were set to expire, politicians played dead and ignored the calls until they had lapsed briefly and people got pissed."
2339,Same shit will happen with this party.
2340,Headaches aren't contagious.
2341,Seconded.
2342,"Chills, low grade fever, body aches, fatigue - I took the day off thinking I'd be up by mid-day."
2343,3 days later I finally felt 80% of myself.

2352,I'd love to see people like him and Abbott kicked to the curb.
2353,These people are cowards who never belonged in healthcare.
2354,Yes it‚Äôs absolutely what I am saying.
2355,At triage people get tested for COVID.
2356,"If they have it, they are only admitted if there is space in the COVID section."
2357,We can absolutely do it.
2358,Same.
2359,"My girlfriend was really sick, but luckily for me I just had a sore arm and was a bit tired."
2360,"Yes, because those were the ""equal"" seats they gave to POCs."
2361,I also work out in the park and live in a humid tropical country.
2362,We also haven't had any covid cases for 2 months.
2363,I still always wear a mask when I'm exercising.
2364,"Partly to set a good example to everyone else, but also to hide the terrible sweat rash the mask has given me."
2365,We are very strict with masks here.
2366,I only ever take my mask off when I'm home alone.
2367,If friends visit we will all wear masks.
2368,Some fiends I've made since December 2019 I've never seen how they look without a mask.
2369,"I dunno if it‚Äôs the same Oxygen, but SpaceX in Boca Chica has tons of liquid oxygene down near Brownsville."

2371,They might even have a production of LOX going too down there but unsure there.
2372,Get vaccinated.
2373,It‚Äôs literally free.
2374,"I have a ""vaccine hesitant"" family member that ended up with covid."
2375,They were at the hospital the day after testing positive for antibody treatment.
2376,I 100%  believe that family member wouldn't be here today without the treatment.
2377,"Even with it, covid worked them over."
2378,"Thankfully, they did recover and have now been vaccinated."
2379,"They are definitely too careful, no way you can aim for zero cases of this thing."
2380,A rethink maybe needed or Australia might end up behind the rest of the world on this.
2381,First covid shot just gave me a sore shoulder.
2382,"2nd one knocked me out for a whole day with fever, aches, and a headache."
2383,Was completely fine when I woke up the next day thou.
2384,Socialization with parents is vastly different from peers.
2385,Even socialization with close in age siblings is different.
2386,Voodoo math really.
2387,Mississippi has about 10k total staffed beds‚Ä¶.and only a small % would be icu beds.
2388,So while it make be true that only six are available‚Ä¶you need the real data or how many total icu beds are in the state and how many are actually staffed.
2389,Mississippi goddamn...
2390,"I don't work in the ER, but I did work in the ICU for several years."
2391,"I would assume if hypothetically it came down to one bed or one ventilator, and there are two patients with covid, one vaccinated and one willfully unvaccinated."
2392,"If studies are showing that vaccinated people have better odds of survival, and the two patients are in similar levels of distress, triage is going to result in the vaccinated person getting the resources."
2393,This!
2394,There‚Äôs a very happy middle ground.
2395,"We have a bubble with other kids, go outside every day, go to parks, even road trips exploring hiking trails etc."

2403,They‚Äôre still doing trials.
2404,"I just read that the FDA asked for more kids to be included in them, because the sample size wasn‚Äôt big enough to know the affect the vaccine has on children‚Äôs hearts."
2405,I am anxiously awaiting a vaccine for my 9 year old and am scared shitless he‚Äôs going to get covid before then.
2406,But I definitely don‚Äôt see them doing nothing because it‚Äôs taking so long.

2428,"Hmmm, let me fill you in on journalist lingo."
2429,"The reason journalists, lawyers and even doctors state ‚Äúmay‚Äù in evidence of something is purely to do with liability."
2430,"The language structure has to be to that which limits liability or else a statement could be taken as factual, without any leeway for error."
2431,"What you should be looking out for is the research itself, and the research should go through a process of peer review."
2432,The fact that these findings exist is reason enough to warrant fear.
2433,"Of course, you could ignore what I said, and base your opinion purely on the writings of a journalist after they read a scientific journal outlining findings in scientific terms, through the study of patients who have had COVID related mental deterioration, as to the condition of some patients, or you could take my advise and get the same outcome."

2437,The boys death in the van was so horrible.
2438,Pretty sure those vaccinated with Sinovac / Sinopharm / Sputnik V will be treated as if unvaccinnated and thus barred entry.

2446,Nah.
2447,Normal one year olds even with introverted stay at home parents get socialization when they go on walks or grocery shopping or to the park.
2448,Locking your one year old in with literally only yourself is definitely developmentally damaging.
2449,"So in other words, actively seek Covid out, contract Covid, quarantine and allow my immune system to handle it, which is most likely will considering it has a 99% survival rating and has only killed 4.2 million people out of a worldwide population of 7.674 billion, then return to normal society, which should embrace me even if I'm unvaccinated because I've got the antibodies."
2450,Sound good?
2451,"As someone whose work in college centered a lot on the genocide of natives and American policy, I am immensely and undescribed proud of the Navajo persevering and succeeding as America tumbles in the face of Covid yet again."
2452,I was very pro lock down in the past.
2453,Because in my experience it works better than vaccines and face masks combined and only lasts 2 weeks.
2454,But most people are too against it.

2464,Personal responsibility!
2465,You win the pedantic game no matter how many people died!
2466,the question is will insurance cover this or are people stuck with out of pocket costs?
2467,"They tried to frame it as an incentive to get vaccinated, but the unvaccinated took that as a sign that the pandemic was over and they didn‚Äôt need to get vaccinated."

2518,"I wouldn't put it past the for-profit vaccine producers (cough, Pfizer) to be putting out PR hit jobs on their competition to increase their market share."
2519,"There have been some suspicious moments of intense media smearing against first Moderna, then AstraZeneca, then J&amp;J, and of course Sinovax and Sinopharm throughout, that turned out to be vastly overblown and based on very minute risks."
2520,Meanwhile Pfizer has come out of it all smelling like roses.
2521,I‚Äôve seen this sort of thing suggested before - that anti-vaxxers will just create fake vax cards - but I don‚Äôt know if I agree with that.
2522,"I think there is a strong current of stubborn pride AND spite - a dangerous combination - that generally runs in anti-vaxxers, and that means even giving the mere _appearance_ of playing by the rules would rub many of them the wrong way."
2523,"They just love the idea of not conforming too much to give in and carry around a vax card, albeit a fake one."
2524,"Instead, I think they‚Äôd claim they were taking some stupid moral high ground by ‚Äúboycotting‚Äù a business that required vax proof."
2525,"(Never mind the fact that it‚Äôs not boycotting if you weren‚Äôt allowed in in the first place, but I digress)"
2526,"Yeah, the past year and now probably the year coming up are the time when you don‚Äôt want to get cancer or some other illness that will put you into the hospital for extended time."
2527,It‚Äôs not even about being in an immunocompromised state; a lot of places just plain don‚Äôt have the room.
2528,"It needs to be done properly:

- penalties for falsifying the proof

2554,All that can be done is to try and lesson the impact.

2558,There is no guarantee of that.
2559,According to Dr. John Campell (youtube channel) Britain has antibodies in 98% of the blood samples taken.
2560,These came from the vaccines and the Alpha-Kent variant.
2561,"That should be herd immunity, but it did not stop Delta from sweeping through the country."
2562,The death rate was much lower than with Alpha and the British break though rate was much lower than in Israel.

2587,Ok so its not about them getting infected its just about your half brother taking the risk of getting sick from covid and having a serious illenss?
2588,"Or you know, another day of covid."
2589,Did you pop positive on both tests?
2590,Let‚Äôs hope not.
2591,As someone who thinks it's smart to get the covid vaccine..
2592,Here's my concern.
2593,As soon as you let ANY government body start making laws and mandates in the name of health.. you get a strong arm for whatever political or corporate influence that can get their grubby hands on them.
2594,Some obvious examples.
2595,Let's say The Right gets their hands on this ability.
2596,"All the sudden, gay sex is banned in the name of slowing the spread of HIV/Aids."
2597,Pharmaceutical companies see the power and they get their bribe money in the the mix.
2598,And all the sudden every single new vaccine and pill they can produce is getting pushed as mandatory.
2599,"Private prisons see the leverage and decide ""you know what stops the spread of most diseases?"
2600,"Washing your hands!"""
2601,Now all the sudden not washing your hands is a punishable offense in the name of stopping the spread of disease.
2602,It's easy to support a mandate that forces your beliefs on someone else.
2603,But once you give someone that power it's not long til you disagree with the next mandate and there's no going back.
2604,I hope people see the danger with this slippery slope and can avoid making emotional decisions that win a battle and lose a war.
2605,the hard truth is that we're at the point where you need to make health decisions for your own self.
2606,"There's so much uncertainty the government can't give guidance to everyone, except in broad strokes."
2607,"Yes, a 3rd booster shot is experimental, but so are many other medications prescribed ""off-label""."
2608,In the end patients themselves have to do their own research and decide what's best to protect their health &amp; safety.
2609,Everyone's situation is different.

2612,"Me in Florida and in nursing school going into into the hospital next week:


**FUCK."

2614,Headline and actual article are about Florida's lack of beds and lack of oxygen.
2615,I used the Binax now one from CVS then followed up a few days later with a PCR since I still wasn't getting better.
2616,Prednisone and decongestant did the trick.
2617,Okay but hear me out let me tell you the Chinese experience vs the experience I lived in my country (Mexico).
2618,When there's cases in China the vast majority of the population can go anywhere they want in their own city because they aren't at risk to get covid.
2619,Only where there's cases you are going to be in a strict lockdown for weeks.
2620,Yes the experience might be miserable but you can be sure that the cases will drop.
2621,But for the majority of the pandemic there wasn't a single restriction put in places with virtually no cases since May 2020 to June 2020 with a coupe of small outbreaks here and there.
2622,Here in Mexico we are one of the few places where there's no restriction for turists.
2623,We haven't had in-person classes since March 2020 and for the vast majority of the year restaurants are either closed or at 20% capacity.
2624,"As a result millions of small business have closed, more than 400,000 people died."
2625,And we still aren't able to attend in person classes nor be able to do any activity in any sort of normality without worrying about getting infected.
2626,"To be fair, he was elected before covid hit and Trump was more or less doing ""OK"" in terms of policy until then."

2637,It‚Äôs entirely possible that China downplayed the damage initially and also responded in extreme measures to prevent an insane surge.
2638,It doesn‚Äôt have to be one or the other.
2639,Im seeing more and more people that i know getting delta being fully vaccinated
2640,"Wildtype, Alpha, Beta, and Delta have had R values all over the place."

2642,Make it a felony with a year of prison time.

2649,Don't confuse the subject by just looking at donations.
2650,The EU was exporting plenty of vaccines to the world while the US was hoarding all the supply for themselves.
2651,Your points are fair but you're forgetting they literally built mobile incinerators and we running 24/7 for weeks which points to crazy amounts of corpses.
2652,China's containment is not to be commended when bearing that mind and also seeing how places like Taiwan did it without trampling over peoles rights.
2653,we need this for our own citizens lol
2654,Stop letting them see/visit you.
2655,"Make a plea for empathy, since they won't listen to science."

2659,Point out their favorite politicians and celebrities that have gotten the vaccine.
2660,Google whatever questions they have with them.
2661,"no you're not selfish, it's getting ridiculous."

2672,NO.
2673,Same in Florida.
2674,I talked to our principal today and asked why they weren't eating in their rooms in k-5.

I got bad news for you: there will never be a study concluding that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 and its variants are NOT in any way linked to cognitive decline or other neurological problems.‚Äù 

Since the human body is so complex, and every person is different, with different genes, medical conditions, immune responses, etc., and every infection is slightly different, there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll ever be able to conclusively dissociate any given condition from COVID exposure."
2685,"Gonna refer to all ML stuff as ""In-silico bias manufacturing"" from now on"

2787,They are taking up hospital resources which means less resources for non-covid health issues like heart attacks and strokes.
2788,&gt;  There are very rare long term negative side effects from almost all vaccines.
2789,"That is true, but those are known to occur within two months of administration."
2790,I recall last summer (hearing via This Week in Virology and In the Pipeline) that scientists were quite keen on waiting to hear about any cases of GBS or any possibility of ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) while the phase 3 clinical trials were going on for the first handful of vaccines.
2791,See [here](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/15/what-might-go-wrong) for a good writeup from last June.
2792,"However, a bunch of the current fearmongering about ""long term effects"" is people claiming that the vaccines will cause you to get cancer five years from now or to drop dead in fifteen years from now."

2934,100 died of the 8000 who broke through.

2936,I'm not saying the government hasn't done this before.
2937,"But using ""the government did it before"" as a justification isnt a great one to me."
2938,The government has done a lot of stuff before.
2939,I'm not even saying I'm against mandatory vaccines.
2940,I'm saying if we go down this path.. you need to draw VERY specific lines of what's considered the threshold to allow it.
2941,For instance how many people per million would need to die for it to be considered lethal enough.
2942,How contagious does it need to be?
2943,And if someone feels the need to look up the specific covid numbers to copy/paste them as the threshold.
2944,Then it's obvious they aren't wanting to do it for health and safety.
2945,They're wanting to do it to force their beliefs on others and make them do things with their body against their will.
2946,Which is the last people I want making laws and mandates.
2947,So if we are going to mandate vaccines.
2948,I think a good place to start is setting numbers which qualify a vaccine as mandatory now and in the future.
2949,"Otherwise, again, you're opening the door for corrupt bodies to mandate anything that makes them money and profit in the name of health and safety."
2950,"I may be wrong here but, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that hospitals get overwhelmed in covid surges and what in normal times would have been serious enough to hospitalize for observation or treatment were getting sent home essentially raising the bar for hospitalization above what it would be for any other illness like a typical flu."

2992,"The former do exist in very small probabilities for the vaccines we've got, but the latter don't."
2993,"People don't understand what might reasonably go wrong with vaccines, so some of them will assume that anything is possible: they'll make you magnetic, they'll make you drop dead in 15 years, they'll give you cancer, they'll make you grow a third arm."
2994,[Here](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/15/what-might-go-wrong) is a good writeup from last summer (while the clinical trials for the first vaccines were still going on) by the medicinal chemist Derek Lowe about what we might reasonably expect to go wrong.
2995,[This](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-720/) interview from last winter with Paul Offit (who worked on a vaccine for rotavirus) has a good discussion about vaccine developement and safety concerns; 22:20-26:00 in to the video they talk about the six-week rule of thumb for long-term effects appearing.

2999,"So far, the only real reason I can find is an allergy to polyethylene glycol, or one of the other ingredients in the vaccine."
3000,"People who are immunocompromised can probably get it (check with your doctor first), people with asthma, heart disease, kidney &amp; liver disease, even cancer can get the vaccine, from what I can find."
3001,Is there other info on this somewhere that I'm missing?
3002,This plan would seem to favor J&amp;J.

3047,"For example, have you ever heard of South Korea?"
3048,Yeah of course it‚Äôs going to take some time to see it really start dropping but Gottlieb has been pretty dang accurate the whole pandemic and this is a sign in the right direction much like the UK experienced right before Delta tanked there.

3289,Good!
3290,"Lionel, show them the door!!!"
3291,!
3292,Indeed.
3293,That's the logic behind restricting or stopping travel between countries.
3294,And it makes sense.
3295,And that isn't what's happening.
3296,"Americans are able to come to the UK/EU, mingle, and then go back to the US."

3298,UK and EU citizens cannot travel to the US.

3301,"New Zealand is also an island, so it is orders of magnitude easier to do one hard lockdown, then open the country up to locals while keeping the borders closed."

3310,Everything is open if you are vaccinated.
3311,No masks needed and we have had minimal cases recently
3312,Their idea seems to be 0 covid which is bonkers!
3313,Actually this article is originated from Reuters.
3314,Reuters has unusual bias against Chinese vaccines given its Chairman sits on the executive board of Pfizer.
3315,To be fair a higher proportion of the population was also vaccinated (compared to Florida) which reduced the R rate significantly.
3316,But yeah you're right about the UK.
3317,"The CDC fumbled, fucked, and exploded the ball on this whole pandemic."
3318,"From the ""You don't need a mask"" to almost every single communication they've given out since."
3319,"I don't know what kind of hire they need to make, but they need to make a few of them, and they needed to do it yesterday."
3320,They shouldn't be struggling this badly to convey this kind of shit to the population.
3321,It's gotta be up there with FEMA's Katrina response for the most disastrous organizational response in human history - at least on the communications side.
3322,By meeting new people you connect the groups where covid can spread.
3323,"If you'd meet a number of good friends, maybe a few of you'd get it then it ends."
3324,"But if you change the group, you can infect that new group, too."
3325,"It's not 4.4% of positives, why can't people bother to read the study."
3326,"It's 4.4% out of a very specific frame of positive tested children who were simptomatic and who had the onset in a specific timeframe, and used the data sharing app properly."
3327,"It's only 1% of the positives and that of course misses a lot of covid kids who weren't tested, so the real number is probably much, much lower."
3328,Oh it is nowhere close to the most infectious disease known.
3329,"There's a good figure comparing diseases presented here:

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57431420"
3330,&gt;  excess deaths.
3331,"This paper in the Lancet estimates the number of covid deaths in the usa as closer to 766k, prior to the end of May 2021, based on the excess death counts: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00011-9/fulltext

And then on top of that you have excess deaths from lack of cancer care or heart attacks or other problems from the emergency rooms being full."
3332,"With the way Delta is raging, I really wouldn't be surprised if we hit 700,000+ officially, 1 million+ estimated by the end of the year."
3333,That's less than a 25% increase in 25% of the time to date so it seems very reasonable as an estimate.
3334,So that would mean that ICU 68 beds aren‚Äôt available?
3335,"How many of these people could even pay for the medical bills, they are already stupid enough to not take the vaccine so not all of them are that much brighter in making money."

3369,No.

3386,It also started with a few states at the beginning of the pandemic as well.
3387,And then it wasn't.
3388,A month ago delta was considered slowly creeping but not too big of a concern yet.
3389,"Don't get me wrong, I hope it doesn't ramp up, but the signs show that it might happen."
3390,"You don't have to wait to be offered now, you can [book online through the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/), it's open to anyone aged 18+."
3391,Instant lockdown works and provides the best outcome.
3392,NZ has been totally Covid free with zero restrictions since February.
3393,If you let the virus in social distancing and masking becomes necessary long term.
3394,"With Delta there is no living with the virus unless you have very, very high vaccination rates."
3395,Dear God please let me vaccinate my kids before my idiot governor gets them sick.
3396,"I currently have Covid, my doctor has been treating me via telephone while I'm at home."
3397,I got the vaccine in March/April (I have a compromised immune system) so both of us are very glad that I got it because it hasn't progressed to the point of me needing a hospital bed.
3398,"Fever was gone after 3 days, muscle aches after 6."
3399,All I'm waiting for is the slight cough and bit of phlegm to clear up.
3400,"This would have absolutely landed me in the hospital, along with a 30 percent chance of fatality had I not gotten the vaccine."
3401,I can't even imagine how long I would have spent in the hospital.
3402,"Anyone in doubt, trust me and get the vaccine."
3403,It will save you so much misery.
3404,"That's not at all the point I'm making, and not at all what you said."
3405,"You implied that people are avoiding to talk about Covid mutating into a less severe virus because it doesn't sell papers, as if that's ever something that'll happen soon enough for it to ever be an option to wait for."
3406,Honestly the outrage isn't because we want mask mandates or we want locks downs.

Go read r/Calgary on this headline."
3408,"Half the comments are ""yes!"
3409,"someone said it we can't hide forever!"""

3413,Probably.
3414,"Unfortunately for them, every country will require a proof of vaccination moving forward."
3415,Keeping the border locked is not a viable solution anymore; opening them for everyone will cause new lockdowns.

3427,The politicization of the vaccination has done a huge damage.
3428,It creates suspicion about the offered vaccines (why do we only have mRNAs?)
3429,and discourage uptake (if I don't take Pfizer/Moderna I cannot travel!).
3430,The World should really have come up with a more unified approach.
3431,That Novavax or Sputnik are having production problems is bad news for EVERYONE.
3432,"Also, it's not like is all rosy with the Pfizer vaccine as the Israeli studies are showing against Delta."
3433,Sinovac met with Gamma and Lambda.
3434,I am for this.
3435,Although I don't think it shouldn't be a permanent thing.
3436,Perhaps when cases truly start to go down for good they can drop it.
3437,"And what do you propose we do, shove it up our ass?"
3438,And when's that going to be?
3439,There has to be a fine balance.
3440,"As long as hospitals are not overwhelmed, and people are doing their part by following the guidelines, there should be no reason to constantly lockdown when a few cases pop up here and there."
3441,"Vaccines will help lessen the severity of virus, but you can still catch it."
3442,"Aiming for zero cases is impossible, unless you plan to shut down your borders from the world forever."
3443,Not to mention many health care orgs severely mismanaged the pandemic and showed exactly how few precautions they are willing to take for their workers and how (un)important the workers‚Äô safety and concerns have become to them.
3444,"Who could have guessed, a profit driven system that abuses the kindness or (in the case of residents) lack of job flexibility of their workers is eventually exposed

I‚Äôm glad health care workers are breaking out of the simulation and growing disillusioned en masse with the propaganda."
3445,"Our society has shown they‚Äôll spit on the sacrifices HCWs make, and the disconnect between the clinical and administrative sides of medicine has never been wider"

3453,what the fuck did they think would happen?
3454,"Respectfully, it sounds like you‚Äôre not up to date on Delta."

3456,"Kids are unvaccinated, so that chance increases."

3539,Clearly the emergency alert system has been infiltrated and hijacked to spread fear.
3540,/s
3541,Well they sure weren't paying out before or giving discounts for care so at least someone is getting paid.
3542,Sorry for being pedantic because I totally understand your point but I can‚Äôt help myself‚Ä¶Shouldn‚Äôt I already be hoping for those things not to happen?

SAN DIEGO ‚Äî How do you vaccinate a tiger?"
3571,Or a cheetah?
3572,Or a baboon?
3573,Carefully ‚Äî very carefully.
3574,And with lots of training and treats.
3575,"As COVID-19 cases surge throughout the region, the San Diego Zoo and the Safari Park are hustling to immunize an array of animals that could give Noah‚Äôs Ark a run for its money, from tigers to Vervet monkeys to hyenas and other critters staff think could be vulnerable to the virus."
3576,"By the end of this week, they‚Äôll have doled out first doses to roughly 250 animals, many of them endangered species."
3577,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a very similar situation to where us humans were just a few months ago, when vaccines were \[first\] available,‚Äù said Dr. Hendrik Nollens, who leads the veterinary teams for the zoo and Safari Park."
3578,‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs this race against time.
3579,"Who‚Äôs going to get there first: vaccine or virus?‚Äù

Recent events have given these efforts fresh urgency."
3580,"On Monday, the Safari Park learned that five of its six Sumatran tigers have COVID-19 after testing stool samples from the animals."
3581,"Keepers first suspected something was amiss when Rakan ‚Äî a 300-pound, 4-year-old male ‚Äî seemed sluggish and wasn‚Äôt scarfing down meals with his usual gusto."
3582,Staff then noticed that he was coughing slightly.
3583,"Three of the other tigers are also showing symptoms, mainly coughing and low energy, and all of them are being closely monitored."
3584,"The news comes days after the zoo learned that both of its snow leopards, Ramil and Naphisa, had COVID-19."
3585,"Both leopards had mild coughs but have nearly made a full recovery, according to Lisa Peterson, executive director of the Safari Park."
3586,"While the organization says it‚Äôs not sure how the snow leopards or tigers got infected, it‚Äôs probable they caught the virus from an employee who was infected but didn‚Äôt have symptoms."
3587,"That‚Äôs what happened back in mid-January, when the Safari Park‚Äôs gorilla troop contracted the virus."
3588,Both facilities are hoping that a two-pronged strategy of stricter masking and vaccination will limit future transmission.
3589,"Following the snow leopard infections, all staff must now wear masks when working with animals that veterinary staff believe could be susceptible to COVID-19 ‚Äî regardless of whether employees are fully vaccinated, or whether they‚Äôre indoors or outdoors."
3590,"Previously, only staff who weren‚Äôt fully vaccinated had to don masks."
3591,The organization has also continued to vaccinate animals at both parks.
3592,"Those efforts began in late January, when the zoo inoculated some of its orangutans and bonobos, marking the first time apes were immunized against the virus."
3593,"And while trying to poke a wild animal with a needle might sound like a recipe for disaster, it‚Äôs something zoo and Safari Park staff do routinely through a combination of coaxing and conditioning."
3594,"For Amara the cheetah, that means bribing the cat with a yummy morsel of meat or a ‚Äúbloodsicle,‚Äù a frozen chunk of blood for her to lick while she sidles up to the edge of her cage for a quick poke."
3595,"And for Johnny the coati, a distant relative of the racoon, that means enticing him with a spoonful of honey inside a plastic container, prompting him to stick his head inside while a vet administers the vaccine."
3596,"‚ÄúI would say in easily greater than 75% of the animals that I‚Äôve vaccinated, they don‚Äôt even react,‚Äù said Dr. Daniel Fredholm, a veterinarian who‚Äôs given coronavirus vaccines to about 40 animals at the Safari Park."
3597,"Staff generally avoid anesthetizing animals whenever possible, Peterson said, because they want to avoid any side effects from anesthesia and would rather have the wildlife willingly participate in their own healthcare."
3598,"So when an animal gets up and walks away before a veterinarian can deliver the shot, they usually just try again later."
3599,"In other cases, keepers use what they call a medical squeeze, a narrow metal crate that the animals have learned to walk into and where a vet delivers a shot through a hole in the side."
3600,"Oddly enough, the hard part is getting them to walk out at the end, according to Annette Russel, member of the Safari Park‚Äôs wildlife care team."
3601,"‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to leave,‚Äù she said."
3602,‚ÄúThey get so reinforced in there and stay.
3603,"‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm being an A-plus student."
3604,"Where‚Äôs my good stuff?‚Äô It takes more work to have them exit it than to go in.‚Äù

The organization is getting vaccine doses from Zoetis, an animal health company once part of Pfizer."
3605,"The company‚Äôs vaccine, which has been cleared only for use in animals, sparks immunity against the coronavirus by delivering a piece of the surface protein the virus uses to grab onto and infect cells."
3606,"The vaccine requires two doses, spaced two weeks apart, for full immunity."
3607,"Once staff finish administering first doses this week, they‚Äôll begin giving out second doses."
3608,Three of the tigers that recently tested positive for the coronavirus had received their first vaccine dose days before they tested positive but had not gotten their second shot.
3609,Researchers are still learning more about how animals respond to coronavirus vaccines or the virus itself.
3610,"Scientists have on occasion spotted infections in lions, domestic cats, dogs and minks, among other mammals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
3611,Most of these cases have been mild.
3612,Zoo staff plan to take blood samples from vaccinated animals and measure their immune responses.
3613,And keepers are working with Scripps Research to use DNA sequencing to determine which viral variants are infecting wildlife.
3614,"They‚Äôve already learned that the two snow leopards weren‚Äôt infected with the fast-spreading Delta variant, estimated to account for 80% of new human coronavirus cases in the U.S.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any data from other institutions because we‚Äôve been on the forefront of this from the beginning,‚Äù Nollens said."
3615,"‚ÄúWhich is great, but there‚Äôs a downside: There‚Äôs no lessons learned that you can go to.‚Äù"
3616,"I have little sympathy for the anti Vax people dying, I just hope my appendix doesn't decide to explode (or some other emergency) cause hospitals are full of rona."
3617,I feel bad for the people that will die for no reason because covid idiots are filling the beds
3618,"Good, this is how it should be."
3619,"Vaccines make covid-19 endemic, not endless masking."
3620,These giant skeletons are on sale at Home Depot folks.
3621,They are pretty good $200 bucks I think what I paid for it.
3622,91% effective against severe illness according to Israeli data.
3623,"But, 39% efficacy means something like

""41% of the people who test positive, were vaccinated""?"
3624,"The total nun of people represented by that 41% is hopefully much lower than, say,  in July 2020."
3625,Doess getting COVID after being vaccinated function as its own booster?
3626,"I‚Äôm EM, and I feel you wholeheartedly."
3627,Like the doc you‚Äôre responding to I have treated everyone.

3630,"I‚Äôve worked in different countries, under difficult and dangerous conditions, and in mass casualty situations."
3631,"This is different‚Ä¶and we‚Äôre home, but in a way this has been a slow grinding mascal without real reprieve."
3632,"I agree the sacrifice has been immense, I see it in my colleagues, I see it in their children."

3760,We just don't have the resources and even though this is a complete repeat of last year (we know this is what happens) people aren't getting vaccinated.
3761,So society is suffering.
3762,"I am struggling with having empathy for patients coming in with covid knowing most of them created this situation on their own by refusing the vaccine (and yes, I'm only talking about adults, I realize some people who are vaccinated can still get sick..."

3788,Has anyone dealt with the same situation and managed to convinced them?
3789,Would it be really that bad to still see them since they're mainly the ones at risk (I want to assume that even a vaccinated 69 year old is more protected than an unvaccinated 37 years old but I could be wrong)?

3832,"I live in Atlanta, GA, not the middle of nowhere."
3833,Vaccines are only more available now in the US.
3834,What about JJ + two shots of mRNA?
3835,"Do you know what the delay was in Canada, was it to do with not having a local manufacturer, or delay in buying them or something?"
3836,"I‚Äôd expect Canada to be pretty quick, it‚Äôs kinda surprising!"
3837,You mean like nurses?
3838,Lot of private schools are mandating vaccines and masks.
3839,Gotta keep it saturated

Pretty similar, with a truly impressive upward slope in cases."
3842,Deaths are also moving up but are fortunately still lagging behind somewhat.
3843,Seems like vaccinating and wearing masks would be adequate for most people.
3844,"So are you planning to just get one mRNA shot, or are you completing both?"
3845,This isn't just a failure to vaccinate.
3846,"It's a failure of policy, it's a failure of propaganda, it's a failure to properly fund the social programs needed to lock down and prevent this from getting so bad in the first place."
3847,This goes beyond just vaccines.

3867,"I was on a Destroyer at the time, so was constantly bumping that shoulder into people and objects."

3869,"With COVID, I had nothing."
3870,Not even a sore arm.

3889,In Miami it‚Äôs just as easy as it ever was to get a test but I‚Äôm assuming the more rural parts of the state are going to have a tougher time.
3890,"Hmm I knew it was less for Delta, honestly 33-36% is still better than no immunity."
3891,My hospital has already converted two floors to COVID floors on top of the ICU and ED covid pts coming in so we will take any percentage from 1 dose we can get.
3892,"Especially since the two doses are still 88-90% (I believe, don't quote me) effective like you mentioned."
3893,It's a shit show on top of a shit show for the nurses.
3894,"COVID streched emotions, staffing, and bodies to the limit."
3895,"When it was over, people called, went on leave, vacation or just straight up quit."
3896,"Streching staffing and workloads, causing more people to do the same."
3897,"Administration shows they care with a slice of pizza, or a small plant at the nurse's station with a letter about resilience and growth."
3898,Equally burnt-out doctors take out their issues on the nurses.
3899,Patients and their families use the nurses as punching bags to Kill the Messenger over rules or news they don't like.

3921,In Spring of 2019 I took my first trip to Hong Kong and noticed how a good percentage of people there wore masks.
3922,"After SARS and how many other pandemic scares they've had there and in Southern China, they had already become a fact of life."

4080,Sometimes we‚Äôd have bad luck and get a lot of other sick people and there‚Äôs just no ICU beds left other than the code beds and then you have to bump whoever is the least sick out of the ICU so you‚Äôre sort of trying to figure out who‚Äôs most likely to die if we don‚Äôt put them in an ICU.

4106,"Obviously you take the appendicitis patient because the utilitarian bang for your buck will be higher, and they spend much less time in the ICU."
4107,"Vaccinated status is irrelevant, e.g."

4386,"There's been months within that where there were no active cases where someone got COVID locally (so for much of that time, any active cases they did have were people in quarantine while trying to enter the country)

Really, the biggest failing has been the lack of actual quarantine facilities, and so Australia has been able to get to zero local cases for large stretches of time (or situations where 1 or 2 people get it but it's caught quick enough before it spreads) such that most of the population has not had to worry about getting or transmitting COVID for big periods of time."
4387,Duh?

4456,"So yeah, the extent that people are having a 'choice' is still not great."
4457,You mention the UK and EU not being done with second doses.... a lot of people in Australia still are having issues finding any access to it.

4500,Australia will never get there either unless they make it mandatory.
4501,Is there any country anywhere close to 80%?
4502,There's too many people who will never willingly take their shot for that to be a viable goal to hold the rest of the country hostage to

4507,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
4508,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

4552,It's part of the problem with just following the science without thinking of the politics.
4553,"Bruh, Facebook is loving this."

4558,"With delta, vaccines are the only long term solution."
4559,The unfortunate casualties will be those that have chosen to get vaccinated but will be unable to get adequate medical care for life threatening illness and accidents.
4560,It‚Äôs because most of them refused to get vaccines so they‚Äôre infecting other people.
4561,It‚Äôs extremely frustrating that people won‚Äôt believe in science for the betterment of their own species.

4564,"I believe that China is lying about their figures is because knowing how the virus spreads exponentially, and also knowing that the virus had already been around spreading for a month or more before they were able to respond to it, regardless of what extreme measures they later took I simply can't see how it's believable that so few people caught the virus."
4565,"Regarding what they have to gain from lying they ( The CCP) tell lies in order to maintain the reputability of their party, not just among the Chinese people, but also among the world."
4566,"At the same time, they realise that they can't lie all the time and that need to also tell the truth sometimes in order to maintain a sense of credibility ( A falsehood mixed in with truths is harder to disprove than a blatant falsehood)."
4567,"If they came out and told an obvious and ridiculous lie like that they had 0 covid cases,  then the people in China wouldn't tolerate it, neither would the rest of the world, and there would be anarchy."
4568,By telling the truth sometimes when people come to accuse them of being liars they can point to the times where they have been honest and say that it's everyone else who is making things up.
4569,It's no different from any other country where the government will tell enough lies to get themselves elected/remain in power but not so many lies that they anger their people and turn the country against them.

4794,"&gt;Honestly, I think this speculation about Asians being somehow immune to the virus is mostly a way for Americans and Europeans to excuse the serious issues in their own societies, which have prevented them from responding competently to the pandemic."
4795,It's not Americans and Europeans.
4796,"It is every country in Latin America, without exception."
4797,"It is even Polynesian island nations with travel restrictions and lockdowns, like Tahiti."
4798,"Most countries don't track Covid cases by ethnicity, but interestingly, in the US, Asians are the single ethnic group tracked with a negative multiplier (0.7x)."
4799,(The US classification does not breakdown Asian further into more precise categories).
4800,This has nothing to do with problems in anyone's society.
4801,It may well be true that China's government has certain advantages in dealing with a pandemic.
4802,And China did better than most everyone.
4803,But you keep ignoring the other countries in the region.
4804,Japan never had a lockdown.
4805,It is patently obvious and beyond dispute that wild-type original Wuhan coronavirus *does not* spread like wildfire in Japan.
4806,"It just doesn't, and this is essentially indisputable."
4807,"Your entire argument is little more than a hand wave, that China had an effective response, and the entirety of the Asian continent shares some cultural and social traits with China, so despite the fact that Japan did essentially nothing, and never had a major outbreak despite sustained spread, there's probably some unnamed social reason to explain all this."

4920,"I agree with you on the point that every infected person should be able to see a doctor, be it in person or remotely, to determine their risk level."

4922,"I‚Äôm no medical expert, but it seems to be difficult for doctors to predict who will get severe symptoms and who will not."
4923,There was [a report](https://www.google.co.jp/amp/s/www.fnn.jp/articles/amp/219792) in Japanese today that eight men in their thirties to fifties died at home while fighting COVID at home.
4924,"For comparison, eight people died gifting COVID at home in Tokyo from December 2020-July 2021."
4925,"Then again, Japan isn‚Äôt testing people as extensively as other countries, so there must be many people kept in the dark as to whether they are infected, even when experiencing cold-like symptoms or finding out that people around them have tested positive."
4926,"If they aren‚Äôt tested, they obviously can‚Äôt get evaluated by doctors for a safe home quarantine..."
4927,"From the source article: https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial

4950,Let's expand on it.
4951,"Now the question is there are no bed, all are occupied by unvaccinated covid patients and a patient came in that needs ICU but unrelated to covid and their chance of survival is quite high if they get in to ICU."
4952,Now what do you do?

4955,Elderly and immune-compromised people often don't mount a good immune response to any vaccine.
4956,A third dose is very helpful according to one study I saw.
4957,Part of the push for a third dose is probably because it's easier to give everyone over a certain age and with certain conditions a third dose rather than have the cost of the tests necessary to check on immune levels.

One of the most important things to note is that:

&gt;	Under the doctrine of military necessity, also known as the ‚ÄúOrloff Rule‚Äù from Orloff v. Willoughby (1953), the military can implement its regulations largely outside the purview of judicial review, because the Court‚Äôs attitude had historically been ‚Äúhands off.‚Äù

So, it has been established that, if declared a Military Necessity, they can establish their own rules outside of the purview of judicial review."
5707,"&gt;	When the U.S. military is a party to cases centering on First Amendment rights to free speech, free press, and free exercise of religion, the Supreme Court generally defers to the government‚Äôs interest and discretion, permitting the military to restrict the rights of service personnel in ways it does not permit in civilian contexts."
5708,"So, while normally you look at precedents for making judicial decisions, this can be ignored by the US Military if it is in the Governments Interests and Discretion to do so."
5709,&gt;	The U.S. military has always operated as a somewhat distinct society governed by its own criminal code.
5710,"It is currently ruled by a special system of laws, primarily the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),and has its own system for prosecuting violations of the code, including courts-martial."
5711,"In the end, it‚Äôs up to the military."
5712,"It sucks, but when you‚Äôre a service member, you have to follow lawful orders, if you don‚Äôt;

&gt;	The maximum punishment for a violation or failure to obey lawful general order or regulation is dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for two years."
5713,"I hate to say it so bluntly, specifically since I have friends and Family in the military (lots of them), they knew what they singed up for, and this is one of those things that comes with the territory."
5714,"Experimental or not, it is a military liability to have the potential of loosing [~23%](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2021/06/30/the-navy-is-the-service-most-vaccinated-against-covid-19-the-marine-corps-is-the-least/)(Im using Navy numbers fot this example) of your service members if there‚Äôs an outbreak in the military."

5855,"I tried saying ok, that makes sense to be hesitant in January but now with all the evidence 99.99% of people on intubation are unvaccinated, how can you still not get it?"

5857,"I got my second shot at the end of may, so do I gotta back for 1 or 2 more shots by the end of November?"

5934,"&gt; The intent of the phrase isn't to say ""not my problem because I got the vaccine""."
5935,It doesn't really matter the intention because this is absolutely how the vast majority of vaccinated people have interpreted it.
5936,[removed]
5937,"&gt;The one HUGE advantage the mRNA vaccines have over naturally acquired immunity is the mRNA vaccines target the ACE2 protein that COVID-19, AND ALL OTHER KNOWN CORONAVIRUSES, use to enter the cell."
5938,So the mRNA vaccines offer a significant level of efficacy against all known coronaviruses.
5939,Natural immunity against coronaviruses appears to be variant-specific and may not protect you against mutant varieties such as delta.
5940,These statements are not correct.
5941,"First of all the mRNA vaccine does not target ACE2, ACE2 is the human protein the virus uses to enter the cell, the vaccine targets the viral spike protein which is distinct to SARS-Cov2 and not the same as other coronaviruses."
5942,"Secondly, ACE2 is not the entry receptor for all known coronaviruses."
5943,"Yes, it is the entry receptor for SARS and SARS-Cov2 but your other example MERS uses the receptor DPP4 as its entry receptor (and that's not to mention any of the other thousands of species that use other receptors)."
5944,Comparing natural immunity to vaccine immunity is complicated because while the immunity to vaccines appears to be generating a much stronger antibody response it is also only targeting a single protein (again the spike protein) while natural immunity is more polyclonal and potentially could be neutralizing while targeting other proteins besides the spike.
5945,"This could theoretically make natural immunity better for broader protection or protection against escape variants, but that won't really be known until those viruses arise (if they do)."
5946,The vaccines are holding up very well currently because the epitopes of the spike protein have not changed enough to prevent antibody binding just reduce and therefore the high levels elicited from the vaccine are still able to neutralize while the natural antibodies at lower titers may have a harder time at lower levels.
5947,It‚Äôs because if they have to admit they‚Äôre wrong about this then they might be wrong about other stuff too and that just can‚Äôt be.
5948,"it already happened for a friend's grandfather (vaccinated), who needed an ICU bed but couldn't get one since they were full due to covid."
5949,"Eventually one opened up, but they weren't able to help his grandfather, but sounded like at least he was happy to have the chance to say good bye since many of us didn't have that opportunity during lockdown (my grandmother passed, wasn't able to say farewell in person)."
5950,"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21994,420,873.html

this shows more than 6 open ICU beds in MS."
5951,Ya but that is like comparing apples to oranges.
5952,People with these autoimmune diseases don't have the same ability to regulate antibody responses in their bodies as your average vaccinated person.
5953,What situation - Masking and distancing for the next 3 years?
5954,This is true for now.
5955,"But more breeding ground makes breakthrough cases higher, plus the chance of mutation for variants like Lambda that are even more vaccine resistant than Delta."
5956,Where did you get that information?
5957,"As of today, the US has administered 194.7 million Pfizer doses versus 139.5 million Moderna doses."
5958,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations
5959,"Yea sure, it's the vaccinated americans' fault."
5960,"Everyone has been saying the vaccines will work only IF we reach a certain percentage of population that is vaccinated, so you left out that part."

5980,"And some people are choosing, making the deliberate decision to believe incorrect and harmful information despite the mountain of evidence."

5996,"The placebo groups no longer exist (they would have mostly been vaccinated by now), so efficacy reports after 6 months aren't going to happen from the trials."
5997,They're probably just wanted to put whatever the most recent good news they had into their quarterly report.
5998,"We just took my brainwashed, unvaccinated mother-in-law to the hospital for Covid, and now I completely understand your sentiment."
5999,"We are furious at her and blame her for this mess, but at the same time we still want her to get care."
6000,"It has been a hard week for my wife, who works in healthcare and is a public advocate for vaccines."
6001,"In the end, I wish there had been more push for vaccine mandates from the federal government."
6002,"Children are being thrown in harms way, and people are trying to force all of the blame on misguided governors."
6003,I just feel like the federal government can be doing more.
6004,We are furious with you too!
6005,"If it comes a time that we have to start rationing healthcare, I really hope unvaccinated people are put at the bottom on the list."
6006,"People love to hate on cities, despite cities being the economic engines of our country."
6007,"For example, residents of small towns in Illinois regularly complain about how Chicago gets so much money compared to anywhere else in the state, nevermind the fact that Chicago generates proportionately more tax revenue and uses proportionately less per capita."
6008,The problem is that rural and suburban areas tend to hamstring themselves through stupid development patterns which make it difficult to sustain local businesses and generate the tax revenues needed to cover local expenses.
6009,"As a result, those areas are constantly strapped for cash and no one will invest in them."
6010,"As costs go up, these rural and suburban regions need proportionately more subsidy."
6011,"But locals often cannot afford higher taxes due to other expenses (like travel costs) or due to poverty, or simply do not want higher taxes."
6012,"So, at the state level, people vote for lower taxation, even as they develop communities that require substantial subsidies to maintain, and then they get angry at cities for not subsidizing them enough because taxes are too low, which they voted for."
6013,There are no studies that prove this to be true.
6014,We no that people with the virus can still easily pass on the virus.
6015,You are being lied to as we all are from both sides.
6016,"It should mainly be for people that don‚Äôt want to end up in the hospital, not the entire human race"
6017,Well shit
6018,I bet you look really cool on your motorcycle.
6019,Everyone probably thinks you're so awesome when you loudly drive by and they can't have a basic conversation because of the noise.
6020,Things could get really really bad in the next month or so.
6021,The most cases seem to be in Florida and Texas and the deep south.
6022,Its about to be peak hurricane season and these are the states most affected by them.
6023,What happens to all the people on ventilators if a hurricane hits Houston?
6024,What happens if people need to shelter in a place like the super dome?
6025,I doubt they‚Äôre going to turn away people who are symptomatic in the midst of a natural disaster.
6026,It could honestly be a situation like we saw in India last year.
6027,These states are playing with fire.
6028,I could walk across the street right now and get another shot.
6029,"They don‚Äôt care at the local grocery store pharmacy, and my state isn‚Äôt keeping records like they probably should."
6030,"I admit, it‚Äôs tempting, but I don‚Äôt want a new and improved booster to come out and not be able to take that in a couple months."
6031,It‚Äôs getting frustrating that there is so little communication on this.
6032,(Parent of a vaxxed over-12 and an impatient under-12.)
6033,I just have the numbers at hand.
6034,"official Covid deaths in the US up to June 6th 2021: 590,000 --- total excess deaths during that time frame: 640,000."
6035,"So the discrepancy is clear, but not as crass as it could be."
6036,"The excuse that I've heard the most often is ""You can still get covid even if you're vaccinated so why bother""
There's just no reasoning."
6037,I read it as a terrible triage typo but you're right it could be intubate.
6038,Double Greek on the way
6039,Ok now do Pfizer.
6040,This is why we need to send our vaccines where they will be used instead of wasting out time trying to convince people here to get.
6041,"Of course it can be, but will it?"
6042,Not with money hungry people at the top.
6043,So the basis upon which you contradict all these sources is that you some DO's and they've assure you that their additional education in spinal manipulation is purely science based?
6044,Where have I heard similar lines of reasoning before...
6045,Thank you!
6046,You and your son stay safe too.
6047,"Before vaccines were prevalent, I felt terrible for people that ended up in the hospital with covid."
6048,"Now the game has changed, vaccines are readily available in developed countries so when I hear an unvaccinated person in one of these countries is hospitalized, I don't feel any sympathy for them and just think ""you're an i d i o t , enjoy your karma and scarred lungs""."
6049,All my sympathies go toward those suffering in countries that are still struggling to get their hands on enough vaccines.
6050,"Yes I believe there are lots of people who struggle with the basic steps of ""identify problem, prioritize solution, execute""."
6051,These are the people who complain about their house being filthy/unsafe but never get around to cleaning/fixing it.
6052,They are not used to being proactive about something that involves their own health and wellbeing.
6053,"They are always just ""getting by""..."
6054,They've had over 18 months to build additional units.
6055,Agree 100% I think a lot of my friends (in America) are like we wouldnt have vatients if anti vaxxers would get the vaccine.
6056,"While true, we need to look globally."
6057,"Some people ask why people in other countries matter, and this is why."
6058,Variants will continue of we don't help one another.
6059,"Some of these articles I‚Äôm reading get so
confusing and contradict themselves a million times."
6060,"It keeps going along the lines of:

Title: Younger people under 40 are now the demographic getting hit with Delta variant and getting severe illness 

Inside the article: ‚Äúthere is no clear correlation between younger people being more affected by the virus‚Äù 

‚Ä¶.what????"
6061,so which is it?
6062,?
6063,ah.
6064,I wrongfully assumed you were in the US.

6066,stay safe.
6067,Your mom is a selfish and cold person.
6068,"But i understand it, i guess."
6069,My family is the same.
6070,"You realize that if the end game isn't having these highly effective vaccines being available to those at high risk who want them, there's nothing else to fall back on?"
6071,"Society is not going to tolerate never-ending rolling lockdowns, restrictions, and masking for a virus that is relatively low risk for children and most working-age adults."
6072,It just isn't.
6073,"Not to speak to the way he's being treated at all, which is ridiculous and inhumane...but if he's an intern surgical resident he most definitely wouldn't be doing any surgeries this year anyway."
6074,"Now, he might not be spending any time in the OR, which is an issue right now...but if he's only a month into residency and in ICU, well 1) fucking kudos to him, cuz interns being thrown into the ICU their first month out of medschool should be illegal...and 2) he still has a ton of time to get OR hours."
6075,"(This is, of course, assuming he's a US medschool grad in a US residency."
6076,Since the residency calendar began at the beginning of July)
6077,Another unvaccinated person claiming they were just waiting to get it.
6078,"Seriously, vaccinating is everywhere on everyday available!"
6079,They don‚Äôt make it a priority cuz they don‚Äôt want it.
6080,"If you did want it, and care about your health, you would take 15 min of your day and do it."
6081,It‚Äôs been months since it became readily available.
6082,"If you can‚Äôt take a train or drive out if your way for 20 min to get it, you are stupid."
6083,We need to start calling these people out on their bs.
6084,That is not how it works.
6085,Antibodies are not the entire story in the mosaic of your body's immunity response system.
6086,[removed]
6087,"They have to, they know if they can't contain, it will climb into astronomical numbers"
6088,"yeah but if strains progress fast enough it can do serious damage to countries who are behind in vaccination, where as people with 2-3 shots are so ahead in resistance that they may be asymptotic"
6089,"had a neighbor who went to Sturgis last year, shortly after returning he and girlfriend got COVID -- didn't die but they were holed up and miserable for a month, basically didn't get out of bed, and had to force themselves to eat because everything tasted gross."
6090,Healthcare workers were the first to get vaccines in most countries also.
6091,Unfortunately you're correct.
6092,"Abbott only cares about winning reelection next year and he won't, and won't allow local governments, to take steps to save lives because it will just piss off his ignorant base."

6097,I don't know why she thinks she knows more the the global medical community and people like our own top doctor in Canada let alone people like Fouchi or whatever.

6100,It's pure insanity.
6101,There are never and will never be reporting on JJ.
6102,Its truly forgotten in the media lol
6103,There aren't any studies available yet as the research is ongoing.
6104,The Pfizer study released preliminary results about antibody levels being 10-15 times higher in persons receiving a third dose.
6105,No vaccine has ever caused long term effects as a result of boosters or initial doses; most side effects being immediately felt.
6106,I'm getting a third dose at 1pm today as part of the Pfizer study.
6107,"There is a 1/3 chance I get a reduced dose, a 1/3 chance I get a full dose and a 1/3 chance I get a booster for the South African variant."

6120,Average percentage is almost meaningless as COVID mostly affects the elderly.
6121,"Those tests for efficacy were made for a different strain, in an environment where people still socially distanced and wore masks."
6122,Anyone with some logic should have realised this.
6123,Yep phase 3
6124,"Correct, the [Delta variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant) was first recorded [5 Oct 2020](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-cases-of-variant-b-1-617-the-indian-variant-being-investigated-in-the-uk/) in India."
6125,"At that time, the vaccine clinical trials were ongoing."
6126,India began vaccinations on [16 January 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_India).
6127,"Yes, however, this is illustrating delta could be much worse for kids, how much we don't know yet."
6128,"And since the constant refrain from many people is, this is not dangerous for kids, its time to stop saying that."
6129,The answer is right now we don't know.
6130,And its on the rise at least.
6131,"So when people talk about the need to continue to wear masks, and they complain about he unvaccinated, well thats kids."
6132,Data is starting to show that there is more of an impact.
6133,"So rather than just dismiss it as not dangerous to kids, time to act with caution when it comes to kids."
6134,Like you know maybe have them wear masks indoors at school.
6135,[deleted]
6136,"\&gt;Viral infections can make children very ill

Are there people who do not know this?"
6137,Just because most children will not get severely ill from COVID doesn't mean it can't ever happen.
6138,What's important is what are the actual chances of a child becoming very ill.
6139,"When cases weren't surging, there was very little incidence of children catching COVID."
6140,"Therefore, the key is to keep cases moderately low in order to keep children from getting ill."
6141,&gt; Which means that asymptomatic is a subset of confirmed.
6142,"I don't that's a reasonable reading of the document, and since we've both looked at daily reports, we know that asymptomatic infections are not a subset of confirmed cases."
6143,&gt; In any case these criteria are completely different from the ones you linked before.
6144,"I think you're going to drive yourself crazy trying to figure out exactly which symptoms were required at various times early in the pandemic to be considered a ""confirmed case."""
6145,"But I think the general outline of how suspected/confirmed cases and asymptomatic infections should be clear to both of us now, and we can stop flogging this dead horse."
6146,Yeah I agree.
6147,4 days in as of today.

6155,Florida was also a big part of the wave of cases that happened last year around July/August as well as other southern states.
6156,"It's hard to pinpoint why that is with so many changing variables, but the south seems to be more likely to spread Covid in summer than northern states."

6177,"Definitely, and you're raising great points about the reality of kids in school."

6183,The second problem is that we're swayed more easily with personal experiences - and maybe that's where my concern comes from.
6184,A close family member had a pretty bad reaction (not heart-related) and now we're concerned about the odds.
6185,Is it genetic?

6188,AZ and J&amp;J would be great but we're not looking to approve them for kids anytime soon.
6189,I think the better question is if we should give male teens only one dose.
6190,"Many of the myocarditis reports notably came after the second one, and one shot still gives you limited immunity."
6191,No it is not.
6192,"You fucking moron, the spread of the virus and infecting other people is based on the viral load."
6193,"A person in whose body the virus reproduced less, does not spread the virus as much."
6194,"Hence, spread is reduced."
6195,"Its just how, back then, they found covid particles to survive on surfaces, but there were so few of them that the conclusion was made the chance for infection from surfaces is almost 0."
6196,"Sorry to say this but is not ""America"" what is divided is one political party that is going antivax  and their fanatic followers."
6197,If they had decided to support vaccination instead.
6198,We wouldn't be having this problem.

There is an ~11% difference in vaccination percentages for counties Biden won vs Trump."
6203,Are there lefties who don't want a vaccination/are anti vax - hell yeah.
6204,But the data is clearly showing that political affiliation is a strong indicator of vaccine uptake.
6205,Flu shot needs a booster every year.
6206,Rabies needs 7.
6207,Your point is trash
6208,So can we have them now?
6209,With the slow vaccine rollout it gives the virus plenty of time and evolutionary pressure to adapt to the vaccine.
6210,We'll be at this until vaccine IP is lifted and the entire world has the infrastructure to do a giant push to vaccinate at the same time.
6211,Given how pharmaceutical companies own the government and how profitable a bi-yearly vaccine is I suspect we'll be living with Covid for a very long time.
6212,Houston and Harris County are barely at 50% vaxxed with one shot.

Moderna says to swirl, not shake  (or invert like Pfizer)  initially and between drawing doses."
6222,white to off-white in color and may contain white or translucent particles.
6223,Do not use if liquid contains other particulate matter or is discolored.
6224,Not if you consider what information they believe.
6225,"If you truly believe COVID isn't real and that the vaccine is a way of controlling your brain, then refusing the vaccine would make sense."
6226,Much the same way mowing your lawn would be unreasonably dangerous if you believed that all lawns are always on fire.

6286,In most of the country you can pretty much walk into any pharmacy and walk out vaccinated within 15 minutes.
6287,Slippery slope.
6288,Fact is everyone should have equal access to affordable healthcare and if it wasn‚Äôt so ridiculously expensive we wouldn‚Äôt lose our human decency to the extent we finger point to our favorite scapegoats.
6289,"For the record, antivaxxers suck."
6290,"Like I said, it‚Äôll boost antibodies for a few weeks."
6291,But it doesn‚Äôt create a delta specific response.
6292,"This comment will get deleted because it‚Äôs political, but one side already politicized masks and one side already politicized vaccines."
6293,"I don‚Äôt really know why, but it happened and it‚Äôs why we are not already out of this."
6294,It is not misleading to say that 100 out of 4.2 million vaccinated people have died from Covid in Massachusetts.
6295,No matter how much you want it to be.
6296,(I know you‚Äôre not sorry.
6297,People like you never are.
6298,It‚Äôs what makes people dislike your attitude so much)

6300,"To be clear, is this a mostly outdoor festival?"
6301,It would appear so.
6302,Yeah I got my first dose of Pfizer in December 2020.
6303,"With all the breakthrough we're seeing now with Delta, I am eager to get a third dose."
6304,"They would face fines, but those fines are miniscule compared to the number of people who may die from the variant."
6305,"No problem, it‚Äôs hard to tell on here sometimes."
6306,"They really have, a lot of them handled things quite poorly at the start too."
6307,"Covid is obviously potentially dangerous for every age group, and it‚Äôs important that it‚Äôs taken seriously, but for a while all the headlines were like penny dreadfuls."
6308,"There‚Äôs a way of conveying the seriousness of the matter without fearmongering I think, and some of them were way too sensationalist."
6309,But we do have a lot of tabloid papers so I guess it‚Äôs to be expected haha.
6310,"I'm in the same boat - vaccinated 13 year old, unvaxxed 9 year old."
6311,We have decided to cancel a car vacation and vacation by plane we rebooked last year when we had to cancel all our 2020 travel.
6312,We don't start school for another month but I'm not too optimistic.
6313,"I also live in a highly vaxxed state and our school district is requiring everyone (vaxxed or not) to wear masks, but Covid fatigue and disappointment is exhausting."
6314,I feel like I'm on the third wave of depression.
6315,[deleted]
6316,Im down to just focus on universal healthcare for all.
6317,We can all agree on that

6325,"I agree with the OP, it's a poor headline and bad statistics."
6326,In reality we don't know what the risk of catching the disease is in the moment.
6327,That only comes in hindsight.
6328,"However,  masking is optional here and with distancing impossible in classrooms the odds of a student contracting COVID at school are likely high since they don't have the luxury of controlling their environment and those in it."
6329,Also kids will be kids and likely won't be as mindful as an adult.
6330,"I was hesitant when these reports came out, so I consulted my kid's Dr. and my own."
6331,"The consensus was with all the bad stuff that can come from COVID, the shot is the safer bet."
6332,Alabama still holding that number one slot at 34.6% vaccinated .
6333,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/growing-number-of-children-hospitalized-with-coronavirus-117968965842
6334,There are no good suggestions.
6335,I just wish experimenting with the kids wasn't one of them.
6336,Yes I wish we understood this psychology better because it will help us get more people vaccinated.
6337,no he got the premium version we have moderna with ads prolly has 6g too
6338,[deleted]
6339,[removed]
6340,But think of all the extra oxygen these antiVa got not wearing masks for over a year.
6341,They shouldn't need any extra now.
6342,[deleted]
6343,Most people believe politicians who promote the idea of sterilizing immunity of Covid-19 vaccines.
6344,"Know a gal that refuses the vaccine, but smokes like a chimney."
6345,"Before the delta variant was widespread, the reproductive number of the alpha variant was only 4 and required a herd immunity threshold of 75%, so 70% seemed like a reachable goal."
6346,"Now that the delta variant is widespread and has a reproductive number of 9.5, it has a herd immunity threshold of 89%."
6347,"If this virus ever becomes as infectious as measles (R0 of 18), it basically requires a herd immunity of 98% to prevent outbreaks."
6348,Any indication anywhere what the projection is?
6349,Like when are cases expected to peak?
6350,"I know that is difficult to model, but I am looking for some good news."
6351,I am in the same boat as you.
6352,It is so frustrating.
6353,It's like our family has wasted almost 18 months trying to stay safe for nothing.
6354,I live in a state where mask mandates for schools are banned.
6355,"My kids (under 12 years old) started school this week; my 3rd grader was one of 3 wearing a mask, and in my 5th graders class only one other student was masked."
6356,I ordered some kn-95 masks for them to wear at school- hope that may help a little bit.
6357,"/r/technicallythetruth \- you did say ""at least"""
6358,Neither made me sick.
6359,I kind of wish they had.
6360,I wouldn‚Äôt have felt a bit better about it.
6361,I‚Äôm sure the feeling from them towards you is mutual.
6362,You didn‚Äôt even read it lol ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6363,They went through appropriate testing.
6364,Dude just say you don't wanna take it no matter what
6365,How about you start production first?
6366,I read the article.
6367,My point is that in many countries asking employees to fill in a form including any health information such as vaccination status would be illegal due to privacy laws.
6368,"I do think a more flexible approach should apply, especially when people are providing the information voluntary."
6369,[removed]
6370,"You should have stopped yourself at ‚ÄúAlthough they are only anecdotal stories.‚Äù Everything else you said is fear-mongering claptrap, that might make you feel a little better, but serves as more pollution in this tide of fear and hysteria."

6383,"This is not remotely an issue of access, the vaccines are there."
6384,I deleted my comment since I didn't take population differences into account.
6385,"&gt; If you have a bone to pick with the headline, it‚Äôs not OPs fault."
6386,That's exactly it.
6387,"I'm not against OP, just the headline is pure drama."
6388,Is it still true that we should get vaccinated to protect those who can‚Äôt?
6389,Or is recent evidence showing us that covid is still being transmitted at the same rate whether you are vaccinated or not because the viral load is the same?
6390,People really want to get back to brunch.
6391,Little kids are sacrifices they're willing to risk to pretend Covid is over.
6392,Masks are fine.
6393,Closed schools not.
6394,"I cant predict how many, if any."

6399,[removed]
6400,None of that has any relevancy to what I said.
6401,Children getting COVID at a higher rate lately does not mean it is somehow more dangerous to them or that the Delta variant is more dangerous.
6402,"It‚Äôs still just over 1 in 1000 that require hospitalization and around 1 in 10,000 that will die in known (mostly symptomatic) cases."
6403,"If you remove kids with comorbidities and factor in asymptomatic cases that go untested, the odds are much much lower."
6404,Louisiana is really struggling.
6405,"This is not what I thought they meant by ""drain the swamp."""
6406,How bad were your symptoms?
6407,"I suspect this may be part of the discrepancy, though Florida was hit pretty hard too in previous waves."
6408,[removed]
6409,"&gt; I don't get it

It's this one."
6410,"He's doesn't mean the actual variant was preventable, but the current situation in the US was easily preventable."
6411,The vast vast majority of unvaccinated hospitalizations and deaths were preventable.
6412,People need to just take the damn vaccine and as far as the US is concerned this would all be over.
6413,&gt;Are they going into an apocalypse.
6414,No.
6415,Tell that to the folks that are getting surgeries delayed or folks that need to visit the ER and getting subpar care or flat out rejected....
6416,That is good news.
6417,I worry though that it is too late and it isn't young to be enough.
6418,This delta wave started with Arkansas and Missouri.
6419,"In a short span, Florida Louisiana and Mississippi are seeing a crazy surge."
6420,That makes me think SC NC Georgia Tennessee Alabama are next.
6421,The delta variant us going to run through the unvaccinated folks in those states.
6422,I hope the country takes it more seriously now and doesn't see another surge like last winter.
6423,That could be even worse.
6424,ah damn.
6425,ok.
6426,I'd even argue we may possibly see boosters every 6 months which sucks but I'll gladly take it
6427,"Compared to where it was last time it got this high in cases, its way better thanks to vaccines."
6428,[deleted]
6429,"I have to keep telling myself ""this is a bump in the road."
6430,"Just a bump in the road."""
6431,Otherwise I wouldn't be here another day.
6432,[deleted]
6433,Ok?
6434,That's already a thing in every large metro atlanta area county.
6435,"Masks required, school started back yesterday."
6436,My kids don't mind.
6437,Need more residency spots way before more med schools.
6438,Opening med schools without residency programs will only increase the competition and likely the debt and tuition of those who get in.
6439,Not many of the kids will have issues.
6440,Covid affects this age group the least.
6441,"Hopefully all the kids have suficient vit d (lets hope their paranoid parents were not keeping them behind closed door whole summer), with it and their immune system, covid should not put much of a fight..

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is even when facing different mutation than before you already have popuplation with some level of antibodies, also we know the disease better than we did before so once admited to hospital, there were already thousands patients before you, doctor threated with this disease so your chances of survival should be higher."
6442,We should not be looking at covid the same way we were looking at it during spring 2020.
6443,Restriction beside masks are not that important anymore.
6444,We are much stronger now than we were back then.
6445,"True, I should have considered that - and considering pre/post vaccine numbers is not a fair comparison."
6446,I'll delete my comment.
6447,"As I understand it, they first saw a lot of blood clot cases in women because most countries started by vaccinating old people (who don't seem to be particularly vulnerable) and healthcare workers."
6448,"Healthcare workers are more likely to be female, so in the beginning, most of the vulnerable people getting the vector vaccines were women."
6449,"The British studies on the AZ vaccine found that men and women were more-or-less equally likely to have clotting problems when they were vaccinated, and the [risk increased with decreasing age](https://wintoncentre.maths.cam.ac.uk/news/latest-data-mhra-blood-clots-associated-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/)."
6450,That's why the government decided to offer an alternative vaccine to under-30s (this policy was later extended to cover under-40s).
6451,"Yeah, that's not accurate."
6452,"We're furious with you too, shitbag."
6453,That‚Äôs literally impossible considering there are only 330M people in the US
6454,"So you don‚Äôt understand why people think Florida‚Äôs doing worse than California, when Florida has **four times** the number of cases, when adjusted for population?"
6455,"If you have a bone to pick with the headline, it‚Äôs not OPs fault."
6456,That‚Äôs from the Boca news site.
6457,Amen.
6458,Totally agree.
6459,"Believe me, I'm fed up with this shit."
6460,[removed]
6461,"It's illegal in the US as well, except for certain situations."
6462,These CNN employees weren't fired for being unvaccinated.
6463,They were fired because they broke company policy.
6464,"CNN has a policy in place that requires employees to be vaccinated to work in the office, these employees attested that they were vaccinated when they weren't, and went into the office."
6465,An attestation is a legally binding document that verifies something as true.
6466,Their unvaccinated status probably later came out (office gossip?
6467,"), which allowed CNN to legally fire them."
6468,Good on CNN.
6469,I talked to someone who hesitated on getting the vaccine because her doctor told her that he didn't trust the vaccine.
6470,It scares me that these people are in the HEALTH INDUSTRY.
6471,I told her that I loved her and I hope she changes her mind because I'm very worried about her.
6472,"She's my hair dresser as well as a minority, so she's around a lot of people for her job and this damn virus has unfortunately affected minorities due to social inequalities among other things."
6473,How can I change someone's mind when a DOCTOR tells her this?
6474,"It wasn't due to some medical condition she may have, or anything that would at least make some sort of sense.."
6475,LMAO cope harder.
6476,"Also, I hope at the very least that your flawed methodology of discerning what is true hasn't prevented you from getting vaccinated."
6477,The amount of Wave inclines and declines tell us a lot about the epidemic and societies resistance to it
6478,I completely agree.
6479,I never really cared about the masks/distancing and I am relieved that the mask order was put back into place for the upcoming school year in Illinois.
6480,"Getting ppl to go back now will be tough though, even a lot of the fully vaxxed act like babies when it comes to putting the mask back on."
6481,"No, there are no cancers that prevent people from getting the vaccine."
6482,Some people may not mount as good an immune response to it.

6484,"The year is 2027, COVID has became endemic globally across the rest of the world by this point, however one zero COVID outpost still remains."
6485,For the 134th time Dan Andrews has put Victoria back into lockdown.

6497,"So it's not ""Free."

6499,"Capitalism."""
6500,A big problem is that all young kids are unvaxed.
6501,"Among adults, the most vulnerable have mostly gotten the shot, and can take precautions."
6502,Kids can't get the shot and may not have the support or maturity to be careful and stay masked.
6503,They may not even know if they are vulnerable yet.
6504,&gt;...California had 11k yesterday... is that 'CALIFORNIA COVID HORROR'?

So if going by this article's metric I suppose CA would need to hit around 40K to ""earn"" that headline...."
6506,"&gt;Yesterday, 29,312 new cases and 119 deaths were recorded

So, it's not 30k new cases but 29,312 new cases yesterday."
6507,What risks do you think might be present in getting a 3rd dose?
6508,That is.
6509,I hope it works out alright for you and your class
6510,"Their body, their choice."
6511,Get vaccinated or don't work.
6512,\*shrug\*
6513,You absolutely can.
6514,How do you think all these massive corporations are mandating employees get vaccinated and making sure all new hires are vaccinated?
6515,"I'm not sure where you got your information from, but that is entirely false."
6516,"Edit: what's illegal is asking follow up questions like ""why aren't you vaccinated?""."
6517,Employers are absolutely allowed to ask if someone is or isn't.
6518,I‚Äôm kind of tired of hearing these stories.
6519,What exactly are we supposed to do to protect children?
6520,If we‚Äôve already been vaccinated?
6521,We can‚Äôt keep them inside forever.
6522,It‚Äôs just so scary and I feel like everyone who survives is going to have major anxiety at the end of it.
6523,Whereas none of this seems to be affecting the anti vaxxers at all.
6524,Maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
6525,Maybe this messaging is encouraging people to get vaccines?
6526,Okay?
6527,You'll find every opinion imaginable in every response.
6528,I didn't mention school closings.
6529,But you have shown your disregard for ANY precautions being utilized because you think it's not too bad if only SOME kids die.
6530,That's dumb.
6531,I was just at a Columbus area vet today with my dogs for follow-up after surgery.
6532,I assumed the staff would be back in masks again.
6533,"I was the only one wearing a mask, incredibly frustrating."
6534,Did it include a VP?

&gt;‚ÄúIn the ICU, 55 people are fighting for their lives and only one of them is vaccinated.‚Äù

Actually, that might be a good idea."
6553,2
6554,1
6555,What about the natural vaccine?
6556,"Exactly, I feel like either I don't get it, or everyone is just operating on different forms of logic here."
6557,"I get people need someone or something to blame, but the US has nearly 50% vaccination rate, which by my estimation is nothing short of a miracle of modern science and times."
6558,"The delta variant originated in India which has just less that 8% of their population vaccinated, it was never on the table to eradicate this disease completely, at least not with crazy draconian measures like completely closing the US borders to the world."
6559,"This was always going to be an endemic, and the Virus was always going to mutate because globally we as a species haven't progressed enough to fully eradicate a virus like this instantly."
6560,I have trouble understanding why people don't understand or are frustrated that we've not completely eradicated this yet.
6561,"To me it's like asking to do something impossible that's never been done in the history of mankind, and then when against all odds we actually start doing it, and now people are getting pissed it's perfectly efficient."
6562,There are numerous people afraid about opening of the school in this thread.
6563,"If they're only testing positive this week, it's going to take a weeks to figure how many die and months if they have long term effects."
6564,Of course death and long COVID are the risk everyone is taking since the needs of the few seem to now outweigh the needs of the many.
6565,Why have any restrictions for anyone at this point?
6566,The same logic that the virus on affects a few could be applied for the public.
6567,"At almost 630,000 deaths, that's only accounts for 0.18% of Americans."
6568,"With 112K cases a day, that's only 0.03% of Americans, even fewer are hospitalized."
6569,"Before the math is called out, that's how the CDC has calculated breakthrough cases, comparing case to everyone who is fully vaccinated."
6570,God lead them into the light.
6571,I‚Äôve still seen idiots in my part of the world(US-Midwest) as recently as yesterday saying ‚Äúkids have been proven not to be spreaders or get very sick from it‚Äù.
6572,There is still so much that isn‚Äôt known about this virus that I say why take a chance.
6573,"These types are so anti-vaxx because they say we don‚Äôt know what it could do long term, but yet they have no issue with a virus that we also have no idea what it can do long term and especially in young kids."
6574,The disconnect is mind boggling.
6575,"Agreed, but most people aren't interested in nuanced scientific argument or how we may need to change our behavior(s) according to new data or changes in the variant population."
6576,They want to hear that its over and done with.
6577,Should I wear a mask or not?
6578,Inside or out?
6579,Vaccine or not?
6580,"Black and white answers are the only acceptable answer, even devoid of any politicization."
6581,"That said, this fucking pandemic has been dragging on and on and we are all sick and tired of this bullshit."
6582,My sister and also sister-in-law are both trying to send their kids back to school without masks.
6583,Both have gone so far as to be part of actual protests against masks.
6584,They are fucking ridiculous.
6585,Teachers should set the tone in their own classrooms.
6586,"‚ÄúMy class, wear a mask.‚Äù It‚Äôs their room as much as any other taxpayer."
6587,THIS.
6588,mRNA vaccines have been in development for years.
6589,It wasn't some new technology invented because of Covid.
6590,There is nothing to cause a late effect because there is literally nothing that lasts other than your immune memory.
6591,Think of mRNA as a post-it note for a cell.
6592,"When the message is acted on, the note is discarded."
6593,mRNA is fragile and is degraded in a day or two.
6594,"That is why the vaccines have to be handled so carefully with staying frozen, not shaken, etc."
6595,Sydney is bad.
6596,But when lockdown end.
6597,We need to expect these kind of numbers.

6683,I just talked with my doctor about this yesterday.
6684,Basically the vaccines we have right now are only for the OG covid and not the variants.
6685,"However, the vaccines do help to protect you and if you do get a breakthrough case, defang delta a bit."
6686,"So if you're not asymptomatic, you'll be feel bad for a week or two, but more than likely won't require hospitalization and will come out the other side just fine."

6724,So someone relapses for 3 months and is going on shit tons of benders.
6725,We shouldn't be kicking them to the curb if they OD in the middle of all this.
6726,Drug addiction really shouldn't be looked at any differently than any other chronic condition that we as a society have said shouldn't be factors in healthcare costs.
6727,"(Be it asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart conditions, etc.)"
6728,"No worries, I feel like this should be information provided to the public at large and would give the people more confidence in any vaccine they receive."

6757,Why aren't more people questioning the origin of this and if there was a potentially malevolent inception?
6758,We know that the wet market origin that was touted as the absolute truth is highly unlikely.
6759,The msm pushed this HARD.
6760,"We started seeing all these ""Asian hate"" claims going around a few days before the msm debunked the wet market theory and started talking about the Wuhan institute of virology."
6761,It was to soften the blow that this virus didn't just spontaneously evolve.
6762,"If SARS had already been ubiquitous, then maybe I could see a possibility of an evolutionary jump to covid, but there weren't any rising cases of SARS Virus prevalence."
6763,No need to reply with any fallacies or argument please.

6779,Watching their classmates and teachers get sick and some of them dying is far more traumatic.
6780,Children being held up as sacrifices to an education system that barely functions and in other times is shown nothing but contempt is disturbing.
6781,Schools in this country have simply become defacto babysitters because the economy and society demands that parent work as much as they possibly can to bring value to shareholders.
6782,"For someone brought up in a world where they have been indoctrinated to believe that their only value is what productivity they produce for an employer and to dream of the least vile career they can tolerate for 40 years... yes, it must be frightening to see people care about the lives and well-being of others before considering the impact to corporations and the status quo of a very flawed education."
6783,The research we have suggests an increase in lethality but no change in the age distribution as the VOC's become more contagious.
6784,"When Gamma took over in Brazil, CFR doubled in every non-vaccinated age group (while dropping in the 70+'s that they were vaccinating)."
6785,The same thing is seen with Delta in the UK's data (available in their technical briefings).
6786,"The [Ontario study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2) is the only one that looks directly at the numbers, and it shows both age and lineage correlation but those two are independent."
6787,"It is absolutely true that when these articles say ""younger people"" they mostly mean ""middle age""."
6788,The risk to under-30s is still really small.
6789,Even a doubling of lethality won't make up for them having 100x less risk than people in their 70s.
6790,"Even after vaccination it is still the elderly at risk: in the UK data, 1.3% CFR for vaccinated over-50s compared to 0.035% for vaccinated 30-50s."
6791,If you're under 50 (maybe 40 if you wanna be risk-averse or 60 to go the other way) you really shouldn't worry after vaccination.
6792,For those older people we'll probably have regular boosters (same as flu).
6793,For unvaccinated kids the disease seems to be comparable to chickenpox.
6794,"Again, the risk here is to the elderly (their vaccinated grandparents)."
6795,You can also attempt to opt in to trials if you have a younger child.
6796,"i have my vaccine card stored in my google wallet, there isn't a similar ability?"

6812,"Still doesn't explain why the fabled ""natural immunity"" that the anti-vaxx/anti-mask bunch supposedly has doesn't seem to actually be a thing."

7196,One vaccine shot vs two?
7197,Pfizer/Moderna vs AZ/J&amp;J?

7284,You are correct.
7285,"From the point of view of herd immunity, it does not matter where the antibodies come from."
7286,I think my original point on relative risks still applies.
7287,My thought process for myself when deciding to get the vaccine included the following.
7288,Vaccine is free.
7289,Hospital stay is not.
7290,Vaccine may cause severe allergic reaction which would be treated on site with epi pen.

&gt; As of this week, only 0.27% of people fully vaccinated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine had later become infected ‚Äî compared with 0.15% of Pfizer-BioNTech recipients and 0.09% of those who got Moderna."
7715,What I like about these stats it‚Äôs it‚Äôs relative to those who got each vaccine instead of just the percentages of breakthrough per vaccine.
7716,I have a questions regarding the vaccine.
7717,"I always thought the general consensus is, that a vaccine makes you immune to the virus unless something went wrong with the vaccination."
7718,I hear a lot of stories where the Corona vaccine didn't stop people from getting it.
7719,Is this the case with all vaccinations and I've been wrong the whole time or is it just the Corona vaccine because its a new way of making the vaccine with the MRNA stuff?
7720,"I don't know anything about it so it's someone could briefly explain it, that'd be nice."
7721,The end game is avoid a variant that is a Spanish flu reboot.
7722,"Sadly this is an evolutionary and much older war that we are fighting here, ultimately our behavior and strength in the face of the adversity while determine the end game scenario."

7725,But that is not for them to decide.
7726,All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.‚Äù
7727,What are the chances this virus gets a new strain so strong that it closes shit down again in the fall?
7728,"Look, I've also been reading the data from the AAP and my kids mask when out, but let's also have some perspective here: 500 kids die annually from RSV and we kind of ignore that."
7729,200ish die annually from influenza even WITH vaccines and we ignore that.
7730,I have two kids.
7731,One is going to kindergarten in a week.
7732,"She'll mask, my 2 year old will mask at daycare."
7733,"But in the end let's be real here that the risks to our kids from COVID are, all else being equal, pretty low."
7734,"I love my kids as much as possible, but it's impossible to protect them from all harm."
7735,And once they get vaccinated I'll care even less.
7736,The AAP data and a bunch of other data sets paint a pretty low-risk picture of this compared to tons of other endemic viruses and risks that we didn't really worry about on the regular.
7737,"Take heart, if you and your spouse are vaccinated the risks for your family are extraordinarily low now."
7738,"I visit Netflix every day, should I start masking in my house?"
7739,Most states have tuition free virtual public schools.

7754,So if that's true what about the 500k+ extra deaths?
7755,Still just the flu?
7756,The 95% was about symptomatic infection.
7757,"This seems to be about asymptomatic infection, which was estimated between 70 and 80% with the earlier variant."
7758,Studies have shown prevention of symptomatic COVID is somewhere between 70 and 80% with Delta.
7759,The people who aren‚Äôt afraid of getting sick aren‚Äôt afraid of going broke‚Ä¶ because they‚Äôre not afraid of getting sick.
7760,An asymptomatic or mild case of Covid only costs the time off of work to quarantine (and if they aren‚Äôt honest about their infection it shouldn‚Äôt cost them a dime).
7761,"And that‚Äôs what the unvaccinated assume Covid would be like for them, whether it be because they already had a mild case, they believe conspiracy theories about the virus‚Äô severity being exaggerated, or they‚Äôre confident in their chances due to their young age or perceived healthiness."
7762,Especially if a portion of the ward occupied by the other people he infected before becoming sick enough to come in because he couldn't have been bothered to mask.

7779,Feel better!
7780,"Yea honestly I think because of the politicization of COVID, people have gone to insane extremes on both sides."
7781,"Like at first in spring 2020 I was thinking what the hell, just wear a mask it‚Äôs not a big deal."
7782,"After wearing a mask all day every day for a year, getting vaccinated, and seeing the actual data that shows us a young vaccinated healthy person with no pre-existing conditions (which INCLUDES obesity) has absolutely no real risk, I‚Äôm like how long am I going to be forced to protect people who don‚Äôt want my protection?"
7783,I mean people are truly insane at this point with how neurotic they are being and how irrationally cautious they are.
7784,The only thing i can think of now is to bring this to the ballot box unfortunately.

7792,I don't understand and it's frustrating to me.
7793,"A 9mo old in ""daycare""??"
7794,I'm curious why such a young infant isn't being cared for at home?
7795,In Canada we get 1 year paternal leave so most daycares won't accept any infants (&lt;1yo).
7796,"&gt;Three to six months after they were infected, more than half of the patients still struggled with forgetfulness and about a quarter experienced additional cognitive challenges."

7805,This is such a common misunderstanding.
7806,"You're citing overall efficacy, which *includes* stopping contraction."
7807,You need to read this data carefully.
7808,"It says:  
&gt; The data shows that protection against mortality from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì **for confirmed cases who had their second dose** at least 7 days prior to their positive test."
7809,"This means vaccinated people *who do manage to get it*, suffer death at 69% the rate of unvaccinated people."
7810,This is for the Alpha variant.
7811,"They then add in the reduced chance of contracting it in the first place, and that's when you get:  
&gt; **When combined with the estimated protection against becoming a case**, this is equivalent to an estimated 97% protection against mortality in individuals vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine."
7812,"A second study a few weeks later, the second link, shows updated data on the Delta variant which we all know by now makes these vaccines less effective overall."
7813,More data shows that [spreading your second vaccination apart even further than 3 weeks](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oxijyr/increasing_the_time_gap_between_covid19_vaccine/) like they did in Israel and the US causes a much stronger antibody response.
7814,"The UK (and Canada) spread their vaccination doses out from the start, so it's fair to say their trials are going to show a stronger vaccine effectiveness by at least some points than here in the US."
7815,"And, more data shows that over time antibodies from the vaccine do wane, and this study was from over 2 months ago, antibodies have waned at least some since."
7816,And finally let's just throw in the fact that not everyone vaccinated has 2-doses of Pfizer or Moderna.
7817,"About 1/5 of ""vaccinated"" Americans are only 1-dose, which is almost garbage against Delta at 33% effectiveness."
7818,And some are only J&amp;J which is also not as effective against Delta by a mile.
7819,All of these compounding factors means we here in the US are certainly below 69% reduction in severe disease.
7820,Probably around 55-60%.
7821,"I don't think it's a stretch to call that ""~half""."
7822,"This is not misinformation, this is the data."
7823,No one cared about this before because against Alpha the vaccine brought Rt &lt;1 even with pre-pandemic behavior.
7824,But Delta is so infectious that it's showing an ability to spread among even fully vaccinated populations.
7825,"So now that vaccinated people have to worry about *getting* the virus, they need to know how likely it is to cause damage or potentially hospitalize them."
7826,People need to be informed.
7827,I mean there's a reason people are talking about getting a third booster.
7828,It's not because it tastes good.
7829,It's because it appears to be necessary in order to maintain pre-pandemic behavior and stop the spread.
7830,"I bet (hope) a good number of attendees are vaccinated, although they may not say so."

7862,If you are so sure of yourself how come you can't explain anything?
7863,What I said is not controversial from an immunological standpoint.
7864,And people like you wouldn't get their panties in a bunch over it if I was talking about any other disease but the current pandemic.
7865,"The sooner the world is vaccinated, the sooner variants lose their reservoir to mutate."
7866,"It‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interests to ensure not a single vaccine dose expires unused, vaccinated or not."
7867,Oh Alabama!
7868,Not very good at math since 28% is closer to one in four than one in three.
7869,That‚Äôs a help.
7870,"But unless there is some medical reason not to be vaccinated, why chance it?"
7871,In Canada we double vaxxed certain populations at the highest priority first.
7872,"Seniors above a certain age, remote and First Nation communities that lack hospital capacity, long term care homes, THEN we prioritized first doses for the rest of the population given the supply limits."

7882,"My vaccine protects me, your vaccine protects you."
7883,I'm not interested in 'protecting others' if they decline the vaccine themselves.

7885,Stay safe.
7886,There are lots of things you can do like hikes or camping in your backyard that kids will enjoy just the same or more so.
7887,Trust me I have 5 kids and just hanging up hammocks in the backyard and making s‚Äômores thrilled them as much as going to a campsite.
7888,Doing what we did to smallpox
7889,To me - the opportunity to eradicate covid was the first 10 weeks in 2020.
7890,If people were able to and actually shut down and isolate maybe there would have been a chance.
7891,I think that ship sailed back then.
7892,‚Äúfuck the ppl who didn‚Äôt get the shot‚Äù Sure - but for now those people not being on board still puts us in enough danger to warrant other measures.
7893,The vaccines are good but they aren‚Äôt magic.

7909,"Sad that your knee jerk reaction is to blame this on an entire generation, just because reddit conditioned you to do so."
7910,if the variants are not impacted by the vaccine then why is he claiming the only solution is to convince everyone to get vaccinated.
7911,it‚Äôs been 1.5 years of conflicting lies from every angle.
7912,Arguably we should have been doing it during flu and cold season a long time ago.
7913,"Think about it, we could eliminate the flu people kept bringing up flu deaths last year, maybe we should fight that too."

7918,"I appreciate it, but you and Biden told everyone to take the masks off and go party even though you knew half the country was not fully vaccinated and our entire population of children were not vaccinated."
7919,You sent' a clear message it was okay for our kids to be around these idiots who weren't protecting themselves and now spreading this to all our kids.
7920,"The message from the beginning should have been social distancing and masking until we reached a real critical mass of vaccinations, not some fake number you guys put up (and didn't meet) and then ignored and acted like everything was fine."
7921,"Yes, I'm mad at the idiots like the Florida governor too, but I'm pretty tired of Fauci at this point too."

7928,"The methodology for ""active cases"" is (total cases) - (total deaths) - (recovered), and this is the disclaimer on their site for their recovered data:

7929,"So yeah, ""active cases"" is just a stat made up by worldmeter that by their own admission is highly inaccurate."
7930,Can't contribute to the economy when you're in a hospital.
7931,A vaccine is likely better.
7932,If someone arrives who is unvaccinated they could still potentially get it while here and spread it around.

7942,"Got it, thanks for that clarification."
7943,Texas and FL are running neck in neck for stupidity and death anyway
7944,There have been 9 deaths there.
7945,9.
7946,What in the good fuck is the government not telling us?
7947,The virologists that warn about that get ignored.
7948,NY‚Äôs most generously defined metro area has around 21m people so the 100 vs 60 seems to match population nicely.
7949,Most of the world has yet to have their first.
7950,"People who are clamoring for the third, EXCEPT those in trials to see whether a third is beneficial, are the height of afraid and selfish."
7951,"Particularly in a case where there was absolutely no medical impetus to get it- no doctor going ""maybe you should"" or autoimmune condition, just a guy scared off by fearmongering on the internet."
7952,Only in (rich) (North) America.
7953,And he doesn't even know if the third dose will be protective OR effective.
7954,"Hope stories like this get folks here to think twice about sharing articles about the ""waning efficacy"" or ""inevitable"" third dose/boosters, though."
7955,"Many do not even have a scientific entity listed, just news media purporting that due to science never being 100% we should prepare to get vaccinated weekly and other attention grabbing headline conclusions."
7956,That stuff clearly influences people- and it influences them to engage in their anxiety and self-centredness more than anything.
7957,Sort of.
7958,I‚Äôm interested in the endgame of this period.
7959,We now think vaccines will not be effective enough to create herd immunity and have it disappear from the community.
7960,"I was wondering if catching COVID a number of times, instead of - or in addition to - having the vaccine, might give a stronger protection than the vaccine alone."
7961,And hence potentially get us to herd immunity.
7962,"It seems like that‚Äôs unlikely though, and many of us will be watching our immunity and having boosters indefinitely into the future."
7963,I'm a teacher and I think a 7 year old would be fine.
7964,"Before public schooling started in the late 1800s, kids didn't have this mass schooling thing."
7965,Being in groups of 20-30 kids all day long is not an essential facet of human development.
7966,"There are some benefits, but it would be incorrect to state that a child of 7 would necessarily be set back academically simply because they aren't in the classroom."

7975,Yeah sorry buddy that is a ridiculous claim based off of what you linked.
7976,That is a study of 50 hospitalized covid patients with no controls.
7977,You absolutely cannot make the claim that all children (hospitalized or not) who get covid will get permanent vascular damage based off of that.
7978,"Additionally, they describe an elevated biomarker, not clinical evidence of vascular damage."
7979,In the article itself it maintains that many of the children were completely asymptomatic.
7980,"You then also claim that this damage which may or may not have happened is permanent, which also is not supported by that article."
7981,Ugh I feel for ya...

7987,If you are around someone who is more vulnerable to the flu such as the very young or old then it's not asking much to wear a mask when you go out.

7989,Cloth masks offer trivial protection to the wearer.
7990,*If you‚Äôre vaccinated* you are at no more at risk of serious illness or death from covid than you were from the flu during flu seasons.
7991,Actually about 15x less risk if you compare the numbers of covid breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization or death to that of the 2018-2019 flu season.
7992,I certainly do not intend to live the rest of my life intermittently wearing a mask.

8000,Took way too long for this.
8001,Now we just need to get rid of blanket bans (e.g.
8002,for Europe) and swap with a risk-based approach.
8003,The people dying in hospitals right now are overwhelming not vaccinated.
8004,Is it that hard to understand how helpful vaccines are?
8005,The flu variants are also able to be predicted and used to figure the most efficient vaccine.
8006,Hence why we get one flu vaccine per year.
8007,At this pace people will be getting vaccinations every other month.
8008,It‚Äôs not sustainable.
8009,"Once we get a vaccine for the new variants, there will be another newer, dominant variant to which our vaccines will be ineffective against."
8010,Needing trials on top of that to ensure safety?
8011,That takes months.
8012,The variants are coming quicker than vaccines will ever.
8013,At this point the only reasonable approach is a lockdown but Biden and Fauci have both already stated they won‚Äôt do it.

8020,That isn't a particularly concrete point.
8021,"Regardless, a business is within its rights to refuse service on these grounds."
8022,&gt;My concern is that the covid vaccine pass is going to expand to other areas and now you can't enter the business unless you have XYZ checked off.

8028,This is great!
8029,I hope theres a few extra studies to confirm this info but really good news.
8030,Do we know what strains were involved?
8031,It would be good to know how delta specifically turns out since it's turned our understanding of this virus upside down in many ways.
8032,I think it‚Äôs the dumbest thing ever.

8040,Vaccines are widely available to those who want them.

8088,"When I see long haulers on the news talking about similar symptoms and how they mysteriously ebb and flow, I find myself thinking that's the most likely culprit for them as well."
8089,"Not meant to downplay it but just to say that a good study would compare a control population that has not tested positive for COVID with a population that has tested positive and look at how each population self-reports experiencing typical ""long-haul symptoms"" on a regular basis over the last year."
8090,"Being governor is no walk in the park, and I have zero political experience, but I'd like to think I could be counted on to not fuck up my state's COVID response \*\*that\*\* badly."

We likely won't see what comes of this damage for a few years, but it's absolutely occurring."
8092,Because the current variant is impacted by the vaccine.
8093,Why do you think the flu vaccine changes every year?

8161,You link to stuff from multiple states.
8162,All those places say you don‚Äôt need an ID but to have your insurance card.
8163,They then say if you don‚Äôt have insurance the government will pay.

8404,At no point did you make a cogent argument as to *why* it is selfish for a normal person to try and get a third dose in a country that is awash in vaccines but doesn't authorize boosters.
8405,"John Doe getting a third vaccine in Sheyboygan, Wi isn't responsible for the  reprehensible decision of the US government banning most exports."
8406,"Furthermore, the position that a booster wouldn't be beneficial is prima facie intellectually bankrupt on a micro scale."

8711,But out of all the vaccinated Covid cases (i.e.
8712,"the conditional probability you are looking for), only 0.8% needed oxygen or worse, compared to 7.1% in the unvaccinated cases."

8734,You‚Äôre simply not understanding what I‚Äôm saying.
8735,The positivity rate as currently applied is invalidated because it doesn‚Äôt use a random sample as it‚Äôs using a closed set.
8736,For the number to mean anything you it you need to sample across a wider overall group not a closed subset and with a fixed number of samples per day.
8737,If you elect not to do this then you need a control group of the same number of people who are not subjected to the closed demographic of the forced testing/frontline workers to get a comparison sample.
8738,That's horrifying.
8739,Do you know which vaccine they had gotten?
8740,"Part of the advantage of the mRNA vaccines is that they target the spike, the one part that really can't change very much - it mutates, but only a very narrow range of mutations leave it still functional."
8741,In contrast post infection immunity is diluted in targeting a wider variety of aspects many of which aren't functionally definitive.
8742,"So a variant can more easily avoid a lot of the non-strategic post infection response, while it can't do much to more than slightly evade the extremely strategic response to spike that the mRNA vaccines narrowly provoke."
8743,I guess we'll leave out the analogies...
8744,Agreed.

8811,I'm well aware what the differences are.
8812,This study says 50-60% efficacy against all (including asymptomatic) infection.
8813,The numbers used for the clinical trials were for efficacy against symptomatic infection.
8814,Efficacy against severe disease is even higher.

9487,Black vaccine hesitancy due to a long history of systemic medical abuse has lead to a lower rate of vaccination among black adults.

9812,The more free condoms given out means the fewer cases of syphilis that I need to track down everyone for.

9823,The vaccine has been available for months.
9824,Monoclonal antibody treatments are literally sitting on shelves because doctors don‚Äôt even know they exist.
9825,It should basically be a routine if a 70 year old gets covid you take them to get antibody treatment and yet it somehow isn‚Äôt and if you call up your doctor or hospital they‚Äôd probably be confused as to what you are talking about.
9826,Not really.
9827,I'm honestly baffled by this statement of his.
9828,There is no real plausible mechanism for this and basically every immunologist agrees.
9829,There seems to be a trend here.
9830,What bothers me is when these articles come out touting .002% it is very dangerous.
9831,These vaccines are awesome and are saving a ton of lives but they are not bulletproof but when the media and our government tout these states it gives people a false sense of security...the one's i'm worried about are the elderly and vulnerable who may have been vaxxed back in December and January.
9832,"These people need to be careful, they are surrounded by a massive amount of Delta infected non-vaxxed idiots."
9833,Also all over 60.

9867,"&gt;On July 27th, CDC updated its [guidance for fully vaccinated people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html), recommending that everyone wear a mask in indoor public settings in [areas of substantial and high transmission](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view),  regardless of vaccination status."
9868,"This decision was made with the data and science available to CDC at the time, including a valuable public health partnership resulting in rapid receipt and review of unpublished data."
9869,"&gt;Today, some of those [data were published in CDC‚Äôs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w), demonstrating that Delta infection resulted in similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people."
9870,"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus."
9871,This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC‚Äôs updated mask recommendation.
9872,"The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones."
9873,This sudden concern by certain elements for vaccine distribution in third-world countries reeks of a coordinated talking point.
9874,Thank you for the info.
9875,I'm glad to hear there is no lasting damage.
9876,It sounds like shes afraid there might be cases of lasting damage and I dont yet have all the information to answer her concerns.
9877,"Florida does not report this, and does not allow institutional disclosure of that data."
9878,"‚ÄúWhen we allow it to rage uncontrolled in other parts of the world and don't get vaccine to them, the virus will keep mutating,"" she said.‚Äù 

As if the anti- vax covidiots  right here in the uS aren‚Äôt equally to blame ."
9879,"If everyone would have rolled up their sleeves when they had the chance , maybe this delta danger wouldn‚Äôt have happened ."
9880,"Now we can anticipate more covid apocalypse, as science tries to grapple with a newer , better vaccine .. that covidiots will still likely refuse."
9881,We are fucked .
9882,Also NY isnt seeing the massive rise in hospiralizations that the south has.
9883,We look more like the UK (still averging  single digit deaths despite a rise in cases for a month

9887,"They knew it was spreading when new years travel was happening but didn't care, spreading it all over the world."
9888,The first known American case was due to a wuhan flight.
9889,And they never actually eradicated it.
9890,Damn that's messed up.
9891,I think they were well aware.
9892,"When you‚Äôre constantly telling people to follow the science for over year, it‚Äôs somewhat hypocritical for a scientific organization to make non scientific recommendations."
9893,The science said people who were vaccinated didn‚Äôt need to wear masks.
9894,Speculation about people‚Äôs actions isn‚Äôt scientific.
9895,And acting like that isn‚Äôt the case only gives more power to the anti maskers who say they‚Äôre not trustworthy.
9896,That is the hope.
9897,But even that would likely take months.
9898,"Florida has a full online school available that is free for residents:

9910,That might have been largely true back in March 2020 but it's fuckin August 2021.
9911,Too many people have not updated their information regarding this.
9912,It's like fighting in WWII in 1941 but all your intelligence reports are from 1939.

9914,We have had outbreaks of legionaires disease in some of our upscale hotels...all because they didn't sanitize their ductwork.
9915,Crazy stuff.
9916,I read all that before.
9917,This is why I specified the dual vaccine approach - it worked (sterilizing immunity) in people who already possessed antibodies.
9918,Neither stat by itself is particularly useful.
9919,"It holds true that the higher the vaccination rate and the more the vaccinated population skews older, the higher the percentage of overall severe infections will be from the vaccinated."
9920,At 100% vaccination you'd reach 100%.
9921,So saying the vaccinated make up x% of deaths is not by itself a useful stat.
9922,"‚ÄúSo this is like a massive reset button, and we‚Äôre back to Feb 2020‚Äù I don‚Äôt know about that, I mean they could probably (hopefully) easily modify the existing vaccines."

9926,Ffs.. Best of luck and from my family to yours I wish for the best!
9927,You do realize that this post was hours after the initial post asking the question right?
9928,No one has actually answered the question.
9929,"If people are mad because I told them that lambda isn't concerning, because it isn't an escape variant then I don't know what to say."
9930,Nurses should be getting 4x the pay same as travel nurses.
9931,That is something I don't get.
9932,the lambda variant exhibits three mutations on the spike and commensurately higher vaccine resistance.
9933,"The VOCs have only gotten stronger (more virulent/deadly), not weaker."
9934,"COVID started off only partially adapted to infect human cells, and has gotten better at it."
9935,That‚Äôs so frustrating.
9936,"I can‚Äôt even imagine how angry you must be if you‚Äôve lost loved ones to this illness before there was the opportunity to get protected, only for idiots to turn it down for fucking stupid reasons."
9937,I‚Äôd want to shake them!
9938,"This vaccine that could have saved your dad or your best friend or your wife, just being completely rejected by people who think they know better"
9939,That is not true.
9940,60% are fully vaccinated (minus a small number who got their 2nd shot in the last 2 weeks).
9941,70% is for first doses only.
9942,"I don't think full FDA approval will matter, I firmly believe that the vast majority of anti vaxxers will not care."
9943,"When FDA approval comes, if they were using that excuse, they will move on to the next one."
9944,Also importantly these vaccination numbers are lower for the states where shit is going sideways.
9945,It is really kind of pointless to look at the entire US now since each state is handling the pandemic totally differently.
9946,Never take  preclinical data on mice as gospel.

9954,"Oh boy, your optimism is *severely* misplaced."
9955,We are swimming in vaccine.
9956,"Vaccine clinics have had to close because every urgent care center, pharmacy, grocery store, and WalMart have the vaccine - free and ready to go anywhere in the country."
9957,"Even the most backwoods, remote parts of the country can get the vaccine with a half hour's drive."
9958,There are NO barriers.
9959,It's 100% free.
9960,You don't need health insurance.
9961,You don't even need to provide ID to get it.
9962,"You just write your name on a form, and you get it."
9963,"An amazing, life-saving vaccine, for free."
9964,The vast majority of Americans even have the ability to choose which vaccine we want.
9965,"And still, 30% of us refuse to get it because microchips or alien DNA or what-the-fuck-ever."
9966,America is an absolute embarrassment to humanity and I am ashamed to be an American.
9967,I'm sorry.
9968,"Not that I disagree with your general point, but how can *anyone* be a year removed from the vaccine at this time?"
9969,Good
9970,"There‚Äôs no bright line, but a once in a century pandemic appears to be the appropriate time."
9971,"Also, they can‚Äôt bypass checks and balances."
9972,"We still have a constitution, courts, etc."
9973,Go elect representatives who you think will handle this better.
9974,One nurse covers a number of people.
9975,Three nurses can cover that number of people around the clock.
9976,"When those three nurses leave, schedules need to be rearranged and other nurses need to take on more patients to cover the slack."
9977,"There is a limit to how far this can stretch and eventually a ""bed"", the ability to care for a single person gets removed."
9978,"The situation doesn't get better, however, and eventually will repeat itself."
9979,Seems to be a reasonable stab at active cases.
9980,"But sure, no data is perfect."
9981,Imagine being able to say nearly 100% of your employees are fully vaccinated.
9982,Sounds like great recruitment material.
9983,"I'd hope so, too, but it's certainly not assured

Source: Attending university with vaccine mandate that just reinstituted a mask mandate"
9984,How does it feel to get smoked by fucking *Canada*?
9985,"Archie Bunker used ""meathead"" though."
9986,Then why not get a 4th and 5th too in a few months too.
9987,The vaccines were meant to be a 2 shot dose and boosters are stlll being analyzed.
9988,Considering so many people in the world have 0 vaccines the who is saying wealthy countries should not be giving boosters yet.
9989,"Could yes, will...well beta and lambda are resistant yet pfizer still holds up well acording to Chile."

9993,"The big difference is, once the drunk driver is in the hospital they can't kill anyone else."
9994,"The problem isn't Java right now, cases have been dropping fast in Java."
9995,"Because its so cramped, even the most remote village on Java is just 4-5 hours away from hospitals in the big cities."
9996,Java's total land area is smaller than New York state.
9997,The problem right now is outside Java.
9998,It could take 2-3 days to get to a hospital.
9999,"The hospitals don't have enough ventilators, that is why the death rate is high."
10000,"Secondly, this is the first time many places have been hit hard by Covid."
10001,Slipper Slope fallacy but anyways it doesn‚Äôt matter since vaccines have been mandated in the past in the face of a pandemic and were still mandated in non pandemic times.
10002,"Argument doesn‚Äôt really apply, we already did this shit and nothing happened."
10003,It‚Äôs so stupid that you‚Äôve done a much better job of distribution but it seems like you have less uptake.
10004,"It‚Äôs really impressive to get a vaccine out there that quickly, it‚Äôs a real shame people are dragging their feet"
10005,I'm fine with businesses establishing their own rules.
10006,"I'm not cool with government mandates for businesses to discriminate and turn down customers, especially when the emergency is over."
10007,Think about the new rules for NYC and look at the Bronx and their vax rate and who makes up that population.
10008,"No I'm not vaccinated, I had covid."
10009,Why is previous infection so frowned upon?
10010,So just to be straight.
10011,4.2 million kids tested positive with 526 deaths?
10012,"Not down playing even one death, just want to make sure I‚Äôm understanding this right."
10013,So a .0125% death rate for that age?
10014,Not to be confused with a 1.25% rate
10015,&gt; Do you know why a vaccine would be more effective than the **actual** virus going through your body?
10016,Because the actual virus has evolved to evade the immune system.
10017,That's part of why the more effective vaccines target the spike protein instead of using the whole virus.
10018,"When presented with the whole virus, the immune system doesn't necessarily focus on the right thing and may fail to actually generate a useful immune response."
10019,Or may generate an immune response that works against a specific variant but not against other variants.

10042,"All of these Variants will eventually spread around the world and the only thing we can do is vaccinated and try to get the rest of the world to do the same by providing vaccines to the less fortunate countries, I don't expect this to truly be under control until a majority of the world is vaccinated, and hopefully during that time it's doesn't mutate into something really deadly"

10048,But then how would he get to act smugly superior on the Internet?
10049,I work at one of the aforementioned Walmart stores.
10050,We routinely give one Moderna vaccine from a 14-dose vial and end up wasting the rest because noone else wants one before it goes bad.
10051,Same with the Pfizer vaccine.
10052,We'll give two or three Pfizer vaccines throughout a 12-hour shift and waste the other 10 doses out of the 2 vials.
10053,We don't even bat an eye at the waste anymore.
10054,"I‚Äôm free, and have been the entire pandemic."
10055,Your perception of how ‚Äúunfree‚Äù CA is is not accurate.
10056,I also find CA beautiful.
10057,"It‚Äôs got mountains, beaches, deserts(lots of them), rainforests, lakes, rivers, big cities, small towns, and everything in between."
10058,"Not saying Florida is ugly, just that I don‚Äôt need your state to be ugly for mine to be beautiful."
10059,Just like restaurants.

10061,We're throwing away expired vaccine in many cases.
10062,Sad but true.
10063,Sometimes it feels like Canada is the guy quietly sipping tea on the porch whilst watching the circus next door burn down haha
10064,It‚Äôs a felony and people are already getting popped by the feds for it.
10065,It‚Äôs never going away.
10066,It‚Äôs far to contagious.
10067,We will learn to live with it and eventually it will get to a point where it‚Äôs not as dangerous
10068,This is literally insane
10069,"Thanks to being vaccinated, I have free 5G to watch Netflix üëç

10072,The governor isn‚Äôt intentionally setting out to specifically murder an entire group of people.
10073,He just doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ care.
10074,I agree.
10075,They made their choice.
10076,"This is dumb, immunity from infection is just as good if not better against the variants."
10077,Im convalescent and don‚Äôt plan on getting the vaccine!
10078,Sue me
10079,My favorite story is the guy swearing it was just his asthma right up until he died.
10080,Don't get me started on family members I've had to physically remove because they snuck in to the Covid unit or because they got violent with staff when they were denied visitation.
10081,"Then there are the anti-mask folks that refuse to wear a mask in the hospital because "" there ain't no government mandate."""
10082,We have patients refusing to wear a  mask while in the ED even after being told there are Covid patients in the waiting room waiting for a room to open up.
10083,Then the people wanting to be ass holes because they're waiting 10+ hours due to staffing and space constraints.
10084,We could just ship them to a remote island where they can live free
10085,Nikki Fried has been leading the charge.
10086,Releasing data on the daily basis.
10087,Keeping open communication with her fellow Floridians.
10088,Her tweets and daily actions have been giving us a light in the dark.
10089,DeSantis could bark at her to quiet down but that would only help her cause.
10090,"She called his bluff, he flinched."

10092,Meanwhile at my university....
10093,People also keep ignoring that it wasn‚Äôt just masks making it disappear.
10094,"We have no bars, limited indoors dining, no clubs, no sports, limited/no school, work from home, no concerts, no festivals, limited air travel, limited international travel, and were told not to gather with friends and family

How in the world is any of that worth stopping the flu?"
10095,It‚Äôs not
10096,Those comments are recorded and available.
10097,No disinformation or lies.
10098,It‚Äôs what happened today in the House while they debated whether mask mandates should be allowed in schools.
10099,What‚Äôs happening in this state is difficult to believe.
10100,On July 28th Arkansas Children‚Äôs had 24 covid patients.
10101,That‚Äôs 50% more than at any previous point.
10102,7 were in the ICU with 4 on ventilators.
10103,"None were vaccinated, over half were eligible."
10104,"2,838 new cases today
20,559 total active cases
An additional 15 deaths were reported, bringing the total to 6,230."
10105,"Cases 10 &amp; under: 25,532
Cases 11-17: 33,599
Cases 18-24: 50,751
 If you want more data, it‚Äôs on the health department website."
10106,"I am not a doctor, and, as a nominal disclaimer, don't take specific advice from internet strangers."
10107,"If possible, call back the rapid-test providers and ask them if they can provide advice based on your symptoms, or (if one is affordable) check with any other doctor available to you."
10108,"&amp;#x200B;

As a totally non-medical-professional who knows next to nothing about anything in any situation, my response to the breadth of your symptoms is two fold; first, that they include far more symptoms than is expected from CoViD (and would thus seem to point away from CoViD), or, second (and, IMO, much less likely) your symptoms exist as part of some dual infection (CoViD + a flu/cold)."
10109,"&amp;#x200B;

Also, screw your employer."
10110,Maybe check to see if there is any sort of HR-related support offered by your state government for asking questions about your rights... no sense in pissing off your own HR dept if you can get free advice from the source of their legal powers.
10111,That's wild.
10112,Not what you see every day.
10113,"Not an exact percentage but top healthcare leaders have made some general estimates:

&gt;Alonso said the state health department found that less than 1% of newly infected people countywide were vaccinated, the newspaper reported."
10114,"‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt have specific data on this point, in our regular conversations with hospitals around the state, they report to us that more than 95% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are not fully vaccinated,‚Äù Savannah Kelly, director of communications at the Florida Hospital Association, told us in an email."
10115,"[https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-covid-19-surges-among-unvaccinated-in-florida-contrary-to-baseless-claims/](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-covid-19-surges-among-unvaccinated-in-florida-contrary-to-baseless-claims/)

What's important to note is that in Florida and elsewhere, the vaccinated population skews older (close to 90% of 65+ are vaccinated, lower for younger age groups), so these percentages are more remarkable in that context."
10116,"If we do see vaccination numbers creep up, the relative percentages for the vaccinated will climb as well."
10117,This.
10118,"I was raised Pentecostal (not snake-handling, actually quite tame by Pentecostal standards) and, while I‚Äôve liberalized a good bit, I‚Äôm still fairly religious."
10119,"But my church understands that the Bible is not 100% literal (in fact, a lot of it is pretty explicitly allegorical), and that abusing other people because of differing beliefs is wrong."
10120,It‚Äôs amazing how many churches don‚Äôt get those two simple facts.
10121,"No, it's not."
10122,Politicians have a choice of using scientific information to make policy or not.
10123,Antiscientific information is used politically or not used.
10124,Scientific information is used rationally or it is ignored.
10125,Not the way this country is headed.
10126,Remind me 4 weeks!
10127,My wife had a pretty rapid onset with the sinus stuff which is rare for her.
10128,Since we both were sick she thought we should check.
10129,Vaccines are super available in the u.s.
10130,I think biden said 90% of americans are within 5 miles of a vaccine site.
10131,"Most clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, drug stores, grocery stores, many big box stores administer them."
10132,There are county and city vaccine sites set up in parks and parking lots.
10133,And the vaccines are free.
10134,If youre not vaccinated in america right now youre either under 12 years old or actively avoiding vaccination.
10135,Funny.
10136,At the start of this pandemic it was my friends and I who took the footage coming out of Wuhan seriously and tried to convince our boomer parents that this was a problem and that the government should probably shut the borders.
10137,But nope.
10138,"Even in March 2020 when the Canadian government started telling people to stay home, our boomer parents insisted on continuing their life as normal."
10139,And now we're here.
10140,"It's Schrodinger's breakthrough cases on here:

1. when talking about vaccine effectiveness, people on here often claim that breakthrough cases are extremely rare;
2. if you point out that that means the CFR for breakthrough cases is really high then, they claim that breakthrough cases are much more common than we know."
10141,"Now, to your actual point: yes, breakthrough cases in Mass are probably a lot higher than that 8k, AND there's a further complication in that the people more likely to get severe COVID are more likely to be vaccinated in the first place AND they could be more likely to both get a breakthrough case AND do die of COVID (say, if their immune system sucks)."
10142,Thanks for breaking it down.
10143,I love seeing these comments at the top because headlines are so fear mongering.
10144,&gt;colleagues studied more than 200 adults **60 and older f**rom Argentina who were infected with Covid-19.
10145,I think Archie Bunker had some other words he would have preferred to use for certain groups of people...
10146,"Yes, the Post 9/11 and Montgomery GI Bill benefits would be lost."
10147,Post 9/11 is a HUGE benefit.
10148,A fully paid 4 years of tuition with a stipend for living expenses.
10149,And it can be passed to a spouse or child.
10150,I passed mine to my daughter and it paid almost $100K for her BSN.
10151,Pretty much zero out of pocket for me.
10152,Certainly nothing to sneeze at.
10153,It also effects your ability to reenlist or join another service.
10154,"I can't see going below General for refusing the vaccine, but the SECDEF could put out a policy on how to handle refusals."
10155,Everyone I knew who refused the anthrax vaccine received a General.

10157,"Last year's attendance at Sturgis was 462,000 people."
10158,That number was actually down about 7% from normal years.
10159,The event was considered a super spreader.
10160,"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/news-scan-apr-29-2021

This year you can imagine attendees will come in greater numbers, unmasked and unvaxxed."
10161,One can hope that this Rally won't be another super spreader.
10162,One can only hope.
10163,My sister is a nurse practitioner who specializes in cardiac care.
10164,She‚Äôs getting offered 4K per week plus accommodations to go to Texas and Florida right now.
10165,There‚Äôs a massive shortage of qualified staff.
10166,I knew somebody who died 2 days sfter getting vaccinated.
10167,She was older and had just recovered from real covid tho.
10168,"Vaccinations are saving lives, but it'd be a good idea to wait a month or so before getting vaccinated if you just recovered from covid."
10169,Maybe I'm reading it wrong but at the time of the press release (and subsequent reprints) it seemed clear they were aiming for EUA as a standalone vaccine.
10170,"Their (relatively tiny sample) test results didn't meet that goal, so they stopped."
10171,"I believe this took place at a time when just creating a vaccine that offered basic protection to the masses was the focus; now that it's obvious there are breakthrough cases and of course variants continue to emerge, I think it warrants revisiting this and adjusting the goal to intentionally use it in combination with Pfizer, Moderna, etc."
10172,"Their previous influenza intranasal vaccine worked because subjects had ab; reading between the lines, this was modeled in a similar fashion and didn't yield the anticipated results because their subjects *didn't*  have SARS COV2 ab."
10173,"They insinuate that it *would*  work for subjects with ab, and I believe for them to say this there must be data that supports it."
10174,"But again, that wasn't their initial goal; they wanted to be the company with the vaccine that did it all."
10175,Also..devil's advocate against myself...
10176,I'd like to see hard data either way.
10177,Toss some bleach in there too.
10178,Maybe a little hydrochloric acid.
10179,Really scrub the Covid away.
10180,At this point what‚Äôs the alternative?
10181,I think we should start asking how did this happen where did this virus come from and those ppl should be held accountable
10182,"Why does full vax count, in that case?"
10183,Both are measures of partial immunity.
10184,"Damn, if only we could do lockdowns, mass testing, and proper contact tracing...but that would take cooperation and a moderate amount of government funding."
10185,Oh well!
10186,Ok.
10187,So where do you draw the line specifically?
10188,Are you saying you wouldn't base the number on lethality or contagion level.. but rather how many people are going to the hospital for it?
10189,Again.. that's fine if it's your standard.
10190,But where's the line specifically?
10191,"How many people need to be hospitalized for you to consider it ""flooded enough for a mandate""?"

10194,"I‚Äôm gonna preface this as saying I ALWAYS wash my hands after using the bathroom

But I do find it kinda silly as a guy since I don‚Äôt touch anything but my pant‚Äôs waistband if I have to pee."
10195,Pretty much all public restrooms have no touch toilets at this point.
10196,Touching random things throughout my day probably makes my hands dirtier than a trip to the bathroom
10197,"Ah yes, vaccines will surely help millenials with unending wage stagnation and a housing crisis, both exacerbated by lockdowns put in place to save boomers from dying."
10198,You're welcome.

10200,It is no different than those citing pseudo science to avoid getting the vaccine.
10201,"They (medical community) do studies, they have regulatory review, and then they make decisions that ensure consistency across the country."
10202,Allowing people to take boosters on impulse and intuition is asking for chaos.
10203,Why not vaccinate kids too while we are handing out boosters?
10204,They are *probably* safe.
10205,üá∫üá≤ü¶Öüòé
10206,&gt;The sub headline to this article is 100 deaths out of 4.2 million vaccinated people.
10207,That‚Äôs a pretty low death rate.
10208,The death rate for unvaccinated people is really low if you go by that.
10209,The real problem is getting boosters just delays vaccinating Africa and India into 2023 or later.
10210,Next thing you know there's the Psi variant that fully resists antibodies and conceals the spike protein from T-cells sending us back to 2020.
10211,"I mean I do, but... they haven‚Äôt really had my back on anything."
10212,I‚Äôve had all of my points taken away from under me over things I didn‚Äôt even know could be pointed (things that coworkers tell me can‚Äôt be pointed) and they refuse to fix it.
10213,They even took all of my vacation days last season when I was supposed to be taking sick leave for injuries.
10214,"I‚Äôve had a lot of bad things happen to me in the last 1yr+ and even though I‚Äôve been doing everything right, (keeping in check of my points and documents) my job has been doing everything they can to force me to continue working under threat of losing my job."
10215,I feel like you're proving my point but you're not meaning to or realizing it lol.
10216,The law you're referring to was made through a process of checks and balances.
10217,And wasn't brought into effect due to some emergency ruling at their own whim.
10218,Meaning they couldnt pass those ridiculous laws you mentioned.
10219,"However if we said ""banning drunk driving seems smart."
10220,"So you can do it without going through the process of typical law making and we'll just hope you don't keep doing it afterwards"".. that opens the door for them to make whatever ridiculous laws they want that benefit whoever has leverage with the group/body making the law."
10221,"Outside of Denver in the mountains, but not *that* far into the mountains that it should be this difficult."
10222,The fact that there were so few appts available even in Denver was somewhat concerning.
10223,"Thank you OP, this was very clear and easy to follow, and led me straight to a question I had, about what the CDC report did NOT say."
10224,I am very frustrated that every media report I‚Äôve read has conflated the ex ante risk of transmission by a vaccinated person with the ex post (conditional on a breakthrough infection) risk.
10225,This has been bothering me all day.
10226,"Fortunately, once again, [Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/opinion/cdc-covid-guidelines.html?referringSource=articleShare) comes to the rescue."
10227,Yep.
10228,And every time I‚Äôve ever seen it reported it‚Äôs been 99% unvaccinated.
10229,Thats it?
10230,"This is a 5% increase in cases from last Wednesday, which I believe is the lowest increase week over week they have seen since the spike started."
10231,Maybe they are nearing/at the peak?
10232,"I think you meant to write ""selfish""."
10233,Just one L. Agree with you though.
10234,Hospitals are being flooded by the unvaccinated.
10235,How long must an entire society because of a few?
10236,Definitely should require US citizens to be fully vaccinated to leave the country.
10237,"Why would you want someone to leave and come back, or why would travel insurance want to delay with your covid likely ass."
10238,What's the point of the first thing then?
10239,By demanding a 3rd dose when it‚Äôs not advised yet to you are just being selfish.
10240,You have your 2 doses vaccines you are protected
10241,"From my understanding, chicken pox doesn't leave your body."
10242,"It lies dormant in nerve cells, a process that doesn't allow for the virus to be replicated (so no reinfection)."
10243,"However, the dormant virus can be reactivated in your nerve cells, and the result is shingles."
10244,Hospitals in Virginia are still doing outpatient surgery and people are wandering around.
10245,All I saw were masked.
10246,"&gt;If there ever really does come a vaccine resistent variant

Why is everyone burying their head in the sand here."
10247,Delta is absolutely a vaccine resistant variant.
10248,Provincetown MA had an outbreak where 3/4 were vaccinated and 4/5 hospitalizations were vaccinated.
10249,My 3yo caught covid and this week I had a cold and completely lost my smell today.
10250,Like stick your nose in a thing of cinnamon and get nothing gone.
10251,"TO be honest when I ventured up to the library to click and collect books, you still had older teens out doing whatever they wanted."
10252,I adhered to what I was told to do (unhappily) because I am on a visa and a guest here.
10253,"However, if you adhered to what was told, and if you did not have a real support bubble, you were just totally alone."
10254,"Yeah, high demand in the end is what matters big time."
10255,As the US shows you can have all the supply in the world but if 30% of the country refuses to take it it doesn't matter.
10256,"Here in Canada we are more along the lines of the UK, we had less supply for quite a while but once the vaccines got here the demand was huge and vaccinations shot way up."
10257,IIRC we are 10% ahead of the US now for both first and second shots.
10258,What are the raw numbers ?
10259,"Unfortunately, him trying to do the right thing will probably mean he won't get reelected."
10260,üòï
10261,That sounds horrible.
10262,And I assume you‚Äôre relatively young if you‚Äôre still working too.
10263,"It‚Äôs a really scary illness, it is obviously worth getting jabbed to not have to go through that."
10264,"Really can‚Äôt fathom people deliberately turning it down,  and all these stories of people who are dying of it saying ‚ÄúI wish I hadn‚Äôt turned it down now!‚Äù Are just üôÑüôÑüôÑ."
10265,All willing to gamble with lives that aren‚Äôt their own apparently
10266,You dont think there will be an exemption for those who cant get a vaccine?
10267,"Okay, but all returning flights to the EU have to leave from Florida."
10268,And jail time and they should be banned from campuses around the country because covid is bad
10269,Because people from both sides keep saying it‚Äôs political.
10270,It‚Äôs not.
10271,It never was.
10272,But everything is.
10273,Glad you had fun!
10274,"And I agree, treatment deserves research and funding."
10275,Especially if this ends up being a long term battle.
10276,I don‚Äôt think people realize just how fast the vaccines came out.
10277,"For how well they‚Äôve worked, it‚Äôs an amazing feat."
10278,"It‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôre gradually losing efficacy against new strains, but they are saving lives."
10279,What they‚Äôve succeeded in is developing the groundwork we needed to face this pandemic head on.
10280,"For as severely needed as the polio vaccine was, it took decades to develop."
10281,People forget that.
10282,Been to LA a bunch of have literally never gone to downtown lol.
10283,It‚Äôs so weird how it‚Äôs like the opposite of most cities where the outskirts are so much nicer
10284,I mean there is a difference in being outside in a park around people vs being packed shoulder to shoulder with thousands of people.
10285,"I've sort of done this rant on here before , but the CDC is dropping the ball by not running challenge trials ."
10286,"There should be a challenge trial done on every new variant that comes out , how are we letting Lambda spread without knowing what the vax effectiveness is on it ."
10287,"If there ever really does come a vaccine resistent variant , we won't know until its way too late to contain or to ramp up a specific vaccine for it."
10288,Same with all the questions around boosters and how good they are .
10289,All of these questions could be answered in 2 weeks with a very safe challenge trial.
10290,The risk would be very very low at this stage of the pandemic and the patients could be watched by doctors closely and given all of the latest treatments .
10291,And thank god my state in the US did not take any measures to restrict movement.
10292,"Not that they could have, the population would not have tolerated it."
10293,And justifiably so.
10294,You got anthrax in the shoulder?
10295,I thought we all got it in the booty...

10299,saved you a click: ...in infected patients
10300,I mean it was planned several months ago.
10301,The thought was we were on the mend as long as everyone was vaccinated.
10302,Lol our governor is a fucking idiot.
10303,"He‚Äôs not going to reinstate a mask mandate, let alone a lockdown."
10304,We‚Äôre just gonna be fucked
10305,I refuse to believe it.
10306,Just like they refuse to believe in masks or vaccines.
10307,"Honestly, at this point, the gop has successfully destroyed its own base with lies, hate, violence, and now disease."
10308,So many people are traveling to the USA to get vaccinated.
10309,"US vaccines have been a huge help around Latin America, and even Asia."
10310,"I guess this would end that, but hopefully those places would have more of their own vaccines by the time this kicks off."
10311,[removed]
10312,That‚Äôs great.
10313,But I don‚Äôt know what people expect.
10314,New Mexico is not nearly as populated as the north eastern states.
10315,Much harder to get people to get vaccinated that don‚Äôt even give a shit about themselves let alone others

10322,They are not deadlier than Delta.
10323,"They're here, and they can't compete with it."
10324,"I would love to be vaccinated, but as a US citizen abroad I'm unable to do so."
10325,:D
10326,"Typically, the only beds that have advanced life support equipment (like ventilators) are ICU beds."
10327,So those other available beds aren't going to help covid patients much.
10328,Uuum.
10329,"We have far more people vaccinated than the US, we have had that since i think mid July ish."

10395,All of them!
10396,That is terrifying!
10397,That could have resulted poorly if the heart attack was severe enough.
10398,I think a lot of times when people (usually on the right) see that ICU beds are full they are assuming all beds are taken by covid patients and then they don‚Äôt believe the numbers but that‚Äôs not the case it‚Äôs just that they are taking up more beds leaving less for others who have injuries that you know usually aren‚Äôt always preventable

10404,Those of us who are vaccinated can absolutely get and spread delta.
10405,Even the CDC has finally (weeks after WHO) said that vaccinated need to still wear a mask.
10406,We just have less of a chance of dying.
10407,"And delta might be slightly less deadly (and I‚Äôm not sure about that at all, from what I‚Äôve read it seems worse), but it‚Äôs 265x more contagious and the viral load is 1000x worse."

10478,"I commented that where Rich District goes, our not-quite-as-rich school district (who wants to be JUST like them in every single way) usually follows."
10479,"Which if they DO reinstate a mask policy for students and virtual learning, it means that our son's last year of school (he graduates in May) will uncomfortable and without his best friend AGAIN."
10480,"Our son is on the autism spectrum and while he complied with the masking policy last school year, he complained mightily about it because he has sensory issues and no matter what the mask was made from, it made him uncomfortable."

10684,"Of the domestic cases, four were reported in New Taipei and one each in Taipei and Taoyuan, the CECC said."
10685,"Two of the domestic cases had a known source of infection, while the other four were under investigation, it said."
10686,"Meanwhile, the CECC reported five new imported COVID-19 cases and zero deaths from the disease on Thursday."
10687,"The five imported cases involved four men and one woman in their 20s to 60s, who arrived in Taiwan between July 21 and Aug. 3, one each from Nigeria and South Africa and three from the United States, the CECC said."
10688,"The new cases bring the total in Taiwan to 15,753, of which 14,256 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day, according to CECC data."
10689,"Between May 11 and Aug. 3, some 14,522 COVID-19 cases were reported in Taiwan, the CECC said, adding that 89.5 percent of them, or 13,001 people, have been released from isolation."
10690,"To date, 791 people have died of COVID-19 in Taiwan, including 779 since May 15."
10691,"Taiwan has received more than 9.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including 5.8 million AstraZeneca vaccines and 3.7 million Moderna."

10731,"It's a similar level of effort to maintain any count, as it takes stopping exponential spread."
10732,"The difference is 0 has compelling advantages over, say, Covid 250 (as Sydney seems to be doing), as in both cases vaccinations far and away exceed ""natural immunity"" acquired over the wave."
10733,"So may as well aim at zero, as both ways you're locking down until vaccinations are sufficient to prevent healthcare being overwhelmed."
10734,"Remember, Florida is over 3x Australia's vax rate due a rather botched rollout here, and lack of mRNA supply."

10921,"Right now if you have an accident, it better be severe enough to warrant airlife to take you straight to a level 3 trauma center from the scene!"
10922,&gt; There is research database.
10923,I don‚Äôt think they have identifiable recorded.
10924,That there needs to be deidentification implies that identification is possible.
10925,It is possible to know exactly who has what medical history.
10926,There's no need to suddenly worry because it's used in a science.
10927,"There may be a concern that people with a (regressive) albinism gene can be identified for genocide, with this data."
10928,People just trust that data won't be used to harm.
10929,I'm pretty sure ACA (Obamacare) prevents insurance from dropping unvaccinated.
10930,"And that's a good thing, IMO."
10931,The ultimate Reddit headline.
10932,I think people on this subreddit care more than most of the non urban US does.
10933,On Facebook people were just shitting all over nyc during the initial wave (either that or denying it even existed - meanwhile we had refrigerator morgues in the streets and more ambulances than taxis).
10934,It was very disheartening.
10935,Yes negative
10936,I am afraid soon it will be no difference taken you vaccine or not.
10937,"So, have I not caught covid all this time because of my weed smoking?"
10938,Have I maybe gotten it and my powerful weed laden body just took care of it?
10939,"In other words, the next Covid-19 variant is just around the corner."
10940,"&gt; life Form

Interesting description for a virus."
10941,Your comment seems rather random to me.
10942,"If people who get shots now (with the delta variant dominant) are &gt;90% less susceptible to covid next February, it will have aged well."
10943,"The good news is Springfield, MO (our canary in the delta coal mine) has peaked and cases are in decline."
10944,Places currently on fire might not be too far from this peak.
10945,"https://www.covidactnow.org/us/metro/springfield_mo/?s=21391063


The bad news is, Florida shot by Springfield's cases per capita like it was nothing and is still headed up."
10946,"I'm not sure if that reflects better testing in Florida, or that local attitudes are the primary determinant of the peak (probably that)."
10947,All the sane people have to microdose psychedelics and have therapist daily to handle this madness.
10948,That makes you think is our normal just a fucking trip and the drugs just make us sober to the realty of our being.
10949,Finally read those links above and another post you had made elsewhere.
10950,"Honestly, some of that stuff is getting a bit over my head but I am glad people way smarter than me are out there working."
10951,Just saw a post about zoo animals getting the vaccines.
10952,It‚Äôs mind boggling how this virus can spread so far and wide and how quickly it does so.
10953,Really puts the world wide pandemic in perspective.
10954,"Thank you for making me aware of those studies, I don‚Äôt think I ever would have come across them on my own!"
10955,And the Lord sent them a fix.......
10956,Yet they did not heed.
10957,"From personal experience between family and friends those that got Moderna had much more severe side effects (fever, chills, myalgia) vs Pfizer which kinda leads me to believe that Moderna might pack a bigger punch."
10958,We'll find out soon enough as more studies on Moderna get published.
10959,You can always make excuse for why something didn't work.
10960,"According to your thinking any process would have to finish in a minuscule amount of time to be effective, but that is simply unrealistic."
10961,"This is why the ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" line is such disgusting, short-sighted logic."
10962,"Is it really a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" for healthcare workers used as human sandbags for a flood of disease?"
10963,Or for the vaccinated if they end up needing hospital care during a COVID surge?
10964,"And this is facilitated by the *unvaccinated*, not the vaccinated."
10965,"Vaccination confers protection against infection, less now with Delta than before, but still significant protection."
10966,"Imagining a fully protected 100% vaccinated society, the virus never gets off the ground enough in any area to actually mutate."
10967,"The fact, in this society, that every single host it tries to move to is another barrier significantly reduces its ability to spread and it fizzles out."
10968,"Even given a vaccine resistant strain, you're still better off in a totally vaccinated country because whatever resistance the vaccine still confers, and there will be some, will still improve the situation."
10969,If it reduces symptom duration by 10%?
10970,"That's 10% less time infectious, if it protects 10% of people from symptomatic infection?"
10971,"Thats 10% less people to spread to, etc etc"
10972,The actual details between Emergency Use Authorization and FDA Approval aren't really things people care about anyway.
10973,It's just a smokescreen for anti-vaxxers.
10974,The vaccines that have been given Emergency Use Authorization have gone through rigorous testing and have been proven safe.

11045,"Not bullshit, it's math."
11046,"Here's the most basic equation needed, where scientific leaders use as a basis for recommending more protections or not."
11047,"R = 3 *(1-P*v)

R is the reproductive rate of a virus."
11048,"If it is greater than 1.0, that means it will continue to spread its current environment."
11049,"Less than 1.0 means it will diminish eventually to 0

The (3) in the equation above is CoVIDs natural R rate."
11050,"V is the efficiency rate of the vaccine, let's say 95%."
11051,P is the percentage of the population that is vaccinated.
11052,"So currently R in the US is:

3 *(1-.50*.95) = 1.4215 

To be under 1.0, we need at least 65% of the population vaccinated."
11053,HOWEVER...the delta variant has a natural R between 6 and 8.
11054,So the above equation is now much harder to get under 1.0.
11055,Mask wearing can effectively lower the R rating by reducing its ability to spread.
11056,This is why it is being recommended.
11057,"If a higher percentage of the population gets the vaccine, then we would be in the clear."
11058,"If not COVID will continue to GROW

11070,I assume Batman is proposing that Europe allows only vaccinated US tourists in.

11076,Adding more unvaccinated people to your population makes no sense.

11152,"Seriously, they have the exact same variant makeup we do."
11153,"Mandatory would be a good step as well of course, but Australia's biggest challenge in vaccination isn't that it's not mandatory, it's that their rollout for the vaccine has been incredibly poorly handled."
11154,"It's not so much ""people don't want to get vaccinated"" as ""people can't find the vaccine to get because of the hoops involved"" or ""people are fine waiting for their Pfizer appointments rather than getting Astra Zeneca""."
11155,Making it mandatory now would still have the problems people are having accessing the vaccine in Australia.
11156,"For getting to 80%, we expect most countries to, at some point, allow children to be vaccinated."
11157,"The US under-12 population, for example, is about 50 million, or about 14%."
11158,"If the vaccination of children will just be 50%, then for a country to get to 80% vaccinated and with the same demographics as the US, then a country would need to be at 73% of the population vaccinated before the under-12 population can get vaccinated."
11159,So the question is if any countries have reached that point (using 73% as a rule of thumb) where they'd hit at least 80% when kids are vaccinated.
11160,"From OurWorldinData, Malta and Iceland are already past that for the fully vaccinated, and looking at both fully and partially vaccinated people (presuming that the partially vaccinated are still going to complete vaccination), and Uruguay and Chile would be there as well."
11161,"If the presumption is that kids would be vaccinated at the same rate as the rest of the population (so not presuming that something like mandating vaccines for school), then the threshold would be 69%."
11162,"Not digging into precise vaccine qualifications by country, but countries that are already at at least 69% of the population partially or fully vaccinated would include Singapore, Canada, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands."
11163,"None of that allows for additional adults to start getting vaccinated, either."

11194,&gt; The surge is again forcing hospitals to prioritize the treatment of Covid-19 patients over others.
11195,This is one of worst parts of all of this.
11196,Hearing about hospital staff having to mentally prepare for triage is horrifying.
11197,The act of turning people away - not being able to provide the individual care they would be if there wasn't as many patients is so sad.
11198,I wish we gave our hospital staff more care by taking this virus more seriously and preventing people from having to enter into the ER in the first place
11199,This is the way.
11200,We know that it's reasonably safe for vaccinated people to gather indoors.
11201,We should allow them to do so without subjecting them to additional risk from people who refuse to help themselves.

11255,"From the NATGEO article

""Researchers with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analyzed blood samples from more than 600 deer in Michigan, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania over the past decade, and they discovered that 40 percent of the 152 wild deer tested from January through March 2021 had **antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,** the virus that causes COVID-19."
11256,"Another three deer from January 2020 also had antibodies."""
11257,[removed]
11258,The exact number is hard to say.
11259,But the uk data again suggests that that's absolutely not true.
11260,"That number is the amount of vaccinated people, mostly pre delta, in the Usa, who ended up hospitalized, when relatively few people in general did."
11261,It's incredibly effective against hospitalization.
11262,Something like a 15 or 17 fold reduction.
11263,It's not several orders of magnitude though.
11264,That number is silly and isn't supported by data.
11265,"Cases aren‚Äôt dropping they are stable around 20k-30k, not going up or down"

11274,I am not dilusional.
11275,"Honestly, it is mostly just a hand full of states at this point pulling the rest down with them."
11276,"Yes, but the manufacturing capacity and research effort..."
11277,I wish there was a clearer explanation of why they couldn't just use the human vaccine.
11278,Possibly just expired doses of it.
11279,"The quantity is trivial, and driving across town to the zoo actually is possible, unlike the legal and logistical challenge of putting it on a plane."
11280,"We should be working out how to redistribute large quantities, but a tiny bit here and there can't be sent far."
11281,The bigger issue is that we shouldn't toketatr supply issues going forward.
11282,"Chances are were going to need the capacity fir something new and novel, and in the meantime the mRNA tech looks promising as a better solution for familiar diseases where we've had less flexible vaccines, or not yet successfully had one worth using at all."

11289,"&gt; But aren‚Äôt the boosters supposed to be specific to the Delta variant

No."
11290,There's work on such things ongoing but trails take a while.
11291,Right now they are just talking about giving a 3rd dose of an existing vaccine while the WHO is concerned that the pandemic would be helped more by those doses going to countries and people that don't have access to any vaccine.
11292,It's a debate with good points on both sides that's honestly above my pay grade.
11293,Still are‚Ä¶.
11294,If you look at the current numbers it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs heading that way
11295,I think I was misunderstood; I certainly hope you and others in your country get access to the vaccine soon.
11296,"My point was that the ""how could you be so selfish getting a booster when developing countries don't have the vaccine yet"" statement has been turning up a lot recently from anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and pandemic-deniers who never gave half a thought to developing countries before."
11297,It's pure concern-trolling.
11298,"None of this is meant to deny that there are a lot of countries still without the vaccine, and hopefully they will get it soon."
11299,But I can't mail the extra dose to people in developing countries any more than I can mail my surplus food I don't eat.

11727,As much as i hate to admit it we're stuck with the idiots.
11728,I‚Äôm going to the one island where cases aren‚Äôt exploding (Kauai) so I‚Äôm a little paranoid lol
11729,&gt; It‚Äôs honestly really impressive given the size of the US.
11730,I think it's because we've had access to the vaccines for so long.
11731,The federal government threw a bunch of money at vaccine manufacturers even before clinical trials finished so that there would be vaccines ready to ship the minute the FDA gave its emergency approvals.
11732,"There were lots of access problems initially due to the piecemeal, state-by-state rollouts; each state was left to its own devices about how they were going to administer the vaccines and which groups of people would get priority (e.g."
11733,medical workers or people in certain age groups).
11734,"My state (Washington) didn't open up access to all adults until early April, but my friends and relatives in other states got vaccinated between January and March."
11735,I got my vaccine in mid-April from a local medical services chain after being on a waiting list for a couple of weeks.
11736,A couple friends who live in a rural area got vaccinated a couple weeks before the rest of us because the S'Klallam Tribe (which was getting vaccine supplies via the federal Indian Health Service) had gotten so many of their members vaccinated quickly that they opened up their vaccine clinic to their non-tribal neighbors.
11737,The pubic health system in the US isn't really set up to do mass vaccinations of adults.
11738,"For example if you want your annual flu shot, you may get it from your family doctor but many people would go to a chain pharmacy (CVS, Walgreens, etc) or a grocery store phamacy (Wal-Mart, Safeway, etc)."
11739,You can get COVID vaccines at those places now but at least in my state they didn't have them until April or May.
11740,So distribution here is smooth and orderly now because we got the chaos out of the way several months ago.
11741,:)
11742,"Dude, the guy you're talking to never suggested either one."
11743,He was just making a damn joke.
11744,"Vaccinated people skew older and more vulnerable compared to the overall population, and people with symptomatic breakthrough cases likely skew that way even more so."
11745,So 1.25% is good in light of that.
11746,It's important to remember that the overall CFR in any place is dragged down by every kid and young adult who gets infected but who has virtually no mortality risk.
11747,"I‚Äôm all for this, but here‚Äôs the problem; this is on a city level, it needs to be at the county level, and OC needs to get on board as well."
11748,"Further, LA county‚Äôs sheriff won‚Äôt enforce a mask mandate that is currently in place so I doubt he‚Äôll do his job and enforce a vaccine mandate either."
11749,"I mean, people have died after full vaccination with Moderna and Pfizer - it‚Äôs not 100% perfect"

11766,Booster shot clinical trials?
11767,Kids are fine
11768,"It‚Äôs 1 out of 80 for those breakthrough cases that are registered, which is a far smaller sample than the actual number of breakthrough cases."
11769,"If 1 in 4 report, the death rate is 1 in 320, if it‚Äôs 1/10 reporting, the death rate is 1 in 800."
11770,Compare this to what happens to unvaccinated people with Covid.
11771,"Vaccines don‚Äôt necessarily stop you from being infected, but they do stop severe symptoms."

11807,"We‚Äôll never reach the point where we can definitively dissociate any number of conditions from COVID infection, and say ‚Äúperson X‚Äôs case of COVID did NOT in any way cause, aggravate, accelerate, interact or correlate with condition Y,‚Äù so this standard would keep one in an indefinite state of hyper-caution, almost to the point of pathology."

11818,"Something a nurse said on the news, recently, stuck with me."
11819,She was unhappy with everyone calling her/other health care workers heroes.
11820,Because it implied this expectation that nurses and doctors are willing to or should be willing to sacrifice themselves for their patients.
11821,And how she never signed up to die for her patients.
11822,"And she's right, some people have come to expect exactly that."
11823,Why should they risk death for people who wilfully contracted a preventable infection?
11824,"do

11825,i mean reality has a way of asserting itself.
11826,They were out at the 4 pharmacies my husband went to on Monday.

11838,Yeah but the difference in stats doesn‚Äôt really say whether it‚Äôs uptake or availability.

11840,We‚Äôve established in this thread that the issue in the US is more uptake and the issue in the U.K. is more availability

11849,I think what the CDC understood is that the people who were refusing vaccinations were the same people who were refusing to mask.
11850,"And if you spent any time outside of major metropolitan areas in the months prior to CDC dropping the mask recommendations, you would have found almost no mask use at all."
11851,So basically the people who were compliant with mask wearing were the same people who were vaccinated for the most part.

11856,"Also, there are only about 2.8m unvaccinated in the whole state."
11857,Far less than the vaccinated.
11858,They are far sicker and dying in larger numbers despite being generally younger and a much smaller pool of people.
11859,It‚Äôs pretty clear that getting the vaccine keeps you far healthier.
11860,Not even debatable.
11861,Why'd they get tested?
11862,"I just need to rant somewhere so here we go: 

My family is going to Hawaii at the end of the month (all vaccinated) and I said I wanted to get tested as well to make sure I don‚Äôt have breakthrough delta."
11863,"My mom, who is liberal, vaccinated, and has worn her mask this whole time, shocked me by listing all the reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt test because I would ruin the trip if I tested positive before leaving."

""A summer camp saw an outbreak where 13 campers tested positive for COVID-19."
11920,The camp has about 50 campers and 20 staff members.
11921,Officials said all staff members were vaccinated and no cases were identified among them.
11922,"The campers are 11-14 years of age and their vaccination status is unknown."""
11923,The only problem with your calculus is that delta is about 3x more infectious than the ‚Äúbase strain‚Äù
11924,First of all you are correct that covid is essentially an infectious vasculitis and that is why it is so terrible and can affect so many different systems.
11925,There have been studies of Long haul covid and they showed that in pediatrics there was basically no difference in seropositive and seronegative kids in regard to their reported Long haul covid symptoms.
11926,"Meaning when you add in a control you see that the symptoms they are describing do not seem to be caused by the covid infection, but possibly by the pandemic itself."
11927,You cannot take studies with no control groups and make broad assumptions treating them as fact.
11928,Control groups are incredibly important.
11929,The only purpose of studies with no control groups is to Target future research.
11930,That is exactly what the study you linked says by the way.
11931,"Also, the idea that there are actually millions and millions of kids horribly affected by covid but nobody is talking about it and it is not in the news is a little crazy."
11932,If 40% of all children who got covid had severe long-term symptoms then there would be literally millions and millions of children all across the globe debilitated.
11933,That is clearly not the case.
11934,Back in May NPR published an article that said that hospital admissions for children were inflated.
11935,I wonder if that's still the case.

11940,"&gt;MATHEW: So it was a completely unrelated diagnosis, like appendicitis or femur fracture or something else."
11941,"I'm willing to consider that something has changed, but this is what a reputable source said back in May about children in the hospital with COVID."
11942,Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ BUT *You‚Äôre doing what you can.

12054,We were often told at the beginning of all this that the coronavirus does not mutate rapidly; and that still holds true.

12196,"I'm not against the covid vaccine, but if you are healthy and eat healthy and have a good immune system there should be no need to take the vaccine."
12197,The covid vaccine actually doesnt make a person immune and doesn't stop the spread and therefore not really a vaccine.
12198,"I expect it wont be over soon, but covid will continue through vaccinated people which has already started in Europe and VS.
Thats why we see an increase due to vaccined people in large groups without masks acting like they are immune."
12199,Even today in queens thousands of people close without distancing and masks.
12200,They can still get it and spread it.
12201,Current science is not even able to create a vaccine to make you immune to the flu and this covid is a more severe version.
12202,As research shows the current vaccine can send you immune system in overdrive which can be harmful such as heart inflamation.
12203,"Some people, while maybe low percentage, even died and mid and long term effects unknown for each age group and sex."
12204,I already expected additional booster vaccines which indicates it's not really a traditional vaccine that will make you immune.
12205,Also every case now is said to be delta variant while covid tests cannot tell you which variant you have.
12206,So a lot is based on assumptions.

12221,"I'd say it's something to expect as a possibility, but not something to see as support for avoiding the vaccine."
12222,"Fauci does a lot of interviews, and is asked a lot of different questions whose answers can be spun into various narratives."
12223,He's nonetheless been consistent when speaking directly to the odds of break-through infections... about 1% of vaxxed get breakthrough infections... that's way better than the percent of people who get infections without the vaccine.
12224,"As to why it may be possible; it seems that Delta is both more transmissible and more deadly, so, it is possible that future strains will do the same."
12225,"Also, if some future strain is able to avoid vaccine or previous infection based immune responses, it may be more deadly simply by virtue of being new."
12226,Does this mean it's worth it to be a little extra vigilant during a worldwide pandemic; I think so.
12227,Does it mean it's time to panic; not in my opinion.

12342,There is no way of knowing who was exposed and who wasn‚Äôt.
12343,The only relevant statistic there is case and infection fatality rate.
12344,"So 100 deaths out of 8,000 breakthrough cases would be a 1.2% CFR."

12400,Do we need to call it the 'Balrog' strain to get these people on board?
12401,There's evidence now that shows Covid survivors have higher rates of ED.
12402,Spite your nose for your face?
12403,smite your dick smite birthrates.
12404,Why are we rolling dice with this?
12405,This is literally the stupidest I have ever seen humanity.
12406,We KNOW its just a matter of time.
12407,We KNOW viruses mutate.
12408,"Vaccinating the entire planet while Covid is still containable is without question the most difficult thing humanity has ever tried to do, I'm gonna need a better reason than pro-choice slogans thrown out there."
12409,Personally I want society to shut down for a month.
12410,All of it.
12411,Completely.
12412,"Marshal law, guard in the streets if that's what it rakes."
12413,End this shit in 4 weeks.
12414,Just shut it the fuck down.
12415,I used to go at least once a month.
12416,These guys are full of shit.
12417,There is a biological drug called dupixent that blocks signals that trigger certain cytokien inflamations
12418,I have no problem with it.
12419,Always have one in my pocket.
12420,"If there are too many people around, I put it on."
12421,I'm fully vaxxed and have enjoyed nearly two years without even a cold.
12422,40yo male
12423,Yes!
12424,I'd rather have this then a mask mandate
12425,Ooof
12426,I think that‚Äôs 25 straight days Florida has had the most new cases.
12427,"Insane , even had the highest death count , doubling second place."
12428,[removed]
12429,Why not?
12430,25% of the eligible vaccine eligible population hasn‚Äôt received a shot in NYC.
12431,"If they start crowding hospitals, why wouldn‚Äôt NY lock things down?"
12432,Seems like it makes sense to be proactive to prevent hospitals from dealing with the unvaccinated when summer comes to an end.
12433,It seems like they haven't yet.
12434,"It's really bizarre, I feel like I'm in the twilight zone."
12435,"I'm the only one masked most places I go, but lots of people are getting extremely ill. My co workers discussed another coworker that was in the hospital with covid today over lunch together."
12436,"Both unmasked, unvaxxed."
12437,"There is a huge, rabid anti Vax anti mask sentiment here."
12438,It's hard to describe how crazy it's been.
12439,Facebook comments are just wild.
12440,"Conspiracies, MLMs, Bible thumping, rumors, ""expert"" CNAs that have done ""research"" and are spreading antivax ideas."
12441,I'm starting to wonder if reality is ever going to come back.
12442,(I'm in north westish Arkansas for reference)
12443,"Yup, I'm incredibly impressed by every part of the vaccine process."
12444,"Like, seriously, developing a vaccine from scratch and then deploying it at a massive scale in a year and a half is a truly astounding accomplishment."
12445,"And then a chunk of the country is saying ""nah, fuck that shit, I'd rather kill myself and my friends/family/neighbors instead""."
12446,"If I was a medical professional who had to deal with the fallout or someone from a country with worse access to the vaccine, I would be so insanely pissed off at these people right now."
12447,People prev infected are LESS likely to be as protected as someone that got the MRNA vaccines
12448,"Right, same with people in terrible health who have heart attacks and strokes."
12449,"They made the choice, why do we pay for it?"
12450,Dude some viruses tormented humanity for thousands of years...
12451,Possibly.
12452,China is doing restrictions but not yet lockdowns.
12453,"This may work for alpha strain but for delta strain, I don‚Äôt know if it will be enough."
12454,"""Citizens leaving the country must be vaccinated"" could work too lol"
12455,[removed]
12456,What are these shenanigans!
12457,"They're all nincompoops if ya ask me, sunny!"
12458,People at local stores still running about unmasked- majority of staff as well
12459,"Denver‚Äôs literally run scenarios for this‚Ä¶ If no one‚Äôs done it, reach out to Colorado."
12460,Denver ran a whole simulation on getting ill patients from DIA to area hospitals via the flight for life service.
12461,"I think the plan was a mass outbreak from Utah, but the idea‚Äôs there."
12462,I‚Äôve heard Children‚Äôs in Denver is accepting pediatric patients from Arkansas.
12463,I cannot stress enough how much I do not care **at all** about that third anymore.
12464,I've sent articles.
12465,I've held my tongue.
12466,I've had polite conversations with ranting family members.
12467,I've yelled at former friends.
12468,"If they don't want the vaccine, I'm done trying."
12469,And you know what?
12470,Fuck em.
12471,Deny their insurance claims.
12472,Triage them to the bottom of the list in every healthcare setting.
12473,"If they won't get the vaccine, don't make them."
12474,Send their dose to people who need it.
12475,"Their choice, right?"
12476,I have no idea how you guys have so much compassion anymore.
12477,I just want to send every single antivaxxer a waiver for insurance and healthcare and then let them go on their merry way.
12478,Post on Facebook!
12479,Be a hero to your idiot friends!
12480,Do **not** come crying to us when breathing is hard.
12481,I imagine the US would be reasonable allowing other vaccines in this approach.
12482,"Possible, I guess, but unlikely."
12483,"Think of a flood, it still sticks to the low land and takes the easy path."
12484,If you get to high ground (reduce contact) you can avoid it
12485,"Back then, people probably didn‚Äôt imagine that hundreds of millions would get infected because that hasn‚Äôt happened in anyone‚Äôs lifetime."
12486,It‚Äôs the raw numbers of infections that drives new variants with a virus like Covid.
12487,A photocopier is a good analogy.
12488,"If you make a copy of a copy of a copy, eventually the result will look different than the original."
12489,"With a bad photocopier, this will happen faster than with a good photocopier."
12490,"Covid is the good photocopier, but it‚Äôs not perfect so eventually you will get mutations that have an impact."
12491,"Looking at it with a glass half full, it could have been far worse."
12492,[removed]
12493,For anybody looking for the abstract: [link](https://alz.confex.com/alz/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/57897).
12494,Which is exactly why BioNTech went with Pfizer because they knew they needed the resources to get it produced &amp; distributed quickly.
12495,What‚Äôs the percentage death rate of unvaccinated people who get Delta?
12496,Ok this is fair.
12497,There are degrees of bullshit and DO's are not as bad as the others.
12498,"I'm in a similar boat - my state is doing decent (not amazing but we're 12th last time I checked in percentage of our population that's fully vaxxed) and my county/city is ahead of the rest of the state, so the majority of people in my local area over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated."
12499,"My fiancee and I are both fully vaccinated, don't have any kids, and all of our friends who live near us are childless, fully vaccinated, not immunocompromised, and have been playing it safe during the pandemic."
12500,I put on my mask when I go to the store or into any public indoor spaces still (although it is no longer currently mandated in my area) - you never know who might be immunocompromised or have young kids at home - nobody deserves to risk their lives or the lives of their families going the store or working there.
12501,"BUT when we're hanging out with our friends now we'll do outdoor dining at restaurants/bars or hangout at someone's house indoors and mask-less, something we didn't do for a solid 13 or 14 months."
12502,We've even been to a couple of house parties (where we knew everyone and knew they were all vaxxed) which isn't something we would have done last year.
12503,"Basically just trying to minimize exposing any strangers to whatever I might be unknowingly carrying, but otherwise returning to a bit more ""normal"" social and personal life."
12504,[deleted]
12505,Is this part of their BLA?
12506,"Yes, yes, and yes."
12507,Good it‚Äôs about time.
12508,Supposedly we‚Äôre pretty close to an approval for kids.
12509,Some schools will be re-opened for a few weeks before it happens though.
12510,That would be a waste of money.
12511,"Nothing will convince these people short of being at death's door, and even that is questionable"
12512,It's been 7 months since I took my 2nd dose of Pfizer...what would happen if I were to take a 3rd dose of Pfizer as a booster or a first dose of Moderna as a booster?
12513,"Vaccinations are up 250% this week in MS, so hopefully people are finally starting to come around."
12514,I have a feeling a lot of that is people that were waiting on school to start back to get one though.
12515,It‚Äôs about time someone had the guts to do this.
12516,No reason reasonable people should suffer because a bunch of luddites make bad choices.
12517,"It's a great use, but I'm sure whoever sent it will be pressured out of a job."
12518,There is no pandemic in ~~Ba Sing Se~~Abbott's Texas.
12519,"Tyrannical governments need to learn the meaning of the word ‚Äúno,‚Äù and to realize that consent given after coercion is not actually consent."
12520,A vaccine mandate that sequesters unvaccinated people is coercing them to get something they don‚Äôt want.
12521,Fuck yeah bb.
12522,"Gimme that booster, too."
12523,Sewer shit
12524,3255 new cases for a state wth their relatively small population and inadequate testing feels huge.
12525,Far left is Smokin'
12526,"&gt;In his study, the apparent waning effect in immunity was felt across all ages."
12527,"For all age groups, early vaccinators were 1.95 times more likely to be confirmed coronavirus positive."
12528,"Among those aged 60-plus, early vaccinators are twice as likely to get infected."
12529,"For those aged 40-59 early vaccinators are 2.1 times more vulnerable, and among under 39s they are 1.6 more likely to catch the coronavirus."
12530,"I'm not a fan of pure osteopathy as it's not science based, no."
12531,"However, I think you're doing everyone a big injustice by purporting that D.O.s are on the same level of chiropractors, naturopaths and other bologna practitioners."
12532,I assume they'll go for round 2 this year?
12533,Headlines like this don‚Äôt deserve to get clicks.
12534,Fear-mongering and downplaying the vaccines effectiveness doesn‚Äôt provide value to anyone.
12535,"You know what, the people who chose not to get the vaccine (not including those with real medical reasons) should be at the bottom of the priority list."
12536,I used to follow Dr. Mercola.
12537,"Over a decade ago, he advocated for eating a healthy vitamin diet rich in fruits and vegetables, lean meats, etc."
12538,"He would recommend supplements such as fish oil, and suggest which brands were reputable."
12539,"Then something changed, he started selling his own brand of products, and only HIS products were good (and far more expensive that what was available elsewhere)."
12540,"Later he shifted into the keto train without calling it that ‚Ä¶ fat for fuel, where he advocated eating a weird diet of mainly fats."
12541,"Something changed, the balanced advice was gone and Mercola started spewing quackery and his own remedies."
12542,That‚Äôs when I tuned him out.
12543,"I'm personally in favor of a blanket mandate, but does still this apply when the vaccine only has emergency authorization?"
12544,Actually I have evidence to the contrary.
12545,In the initial pfizer trials they showed convincing data that those with low antibody responses were still getting significant protection from infection.
12546,"This is the conundrum, we are seeing waning antibodies leading to a higher likelihood of infection among the vaccinated (isreal ""study"" and general infection curves around the world) but we have evidence that antibodies are not the only game in town when it comes to preventing infection from the pfizer trial."
12547,If I'm being honest I'm quite disappointed we don't have more of the hard science to support one position or the other.
12548,Hell we don't even have comparative growth studies for most of the variants.
12549,And Brazil
12550,If there unvaccinated and in the hospital who fucking cares?
12551,She looks like an anti-vaxer
12552,Absolutely terrifying article.
12553,"Beneath all the praise they've got from the world, it's scary how they do remotely fucked over so many people and have made absolutely no effort to improve the situation."
12554,My findings as well after a nice tour of Google results on the subject.
12555,"What I found interesting is that the drummer has already had COVID, and COVID (as well as the J&amp;J) is a potential GBS cause according to the Mayo Clinic (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793), so to say he refuses to get the vaccine due to childhood GBS is 100% him playing the victim with the ""pre-existing condition"" card and complaining how the vaccine is increasingly an industry standard ."
12556,.
12557,.
12558,which of course it is.
12559,"Concerts are the definition of a super-spreader event, you punk."
12560,"Deep breath, you‚Äôre gonna be fine."
12561,The vaccine protects you even once antibody levels decrease.
12562,"You may not be asymptomatic, but you should still have strong protection against severe cases."
12563,"You may still go through it, but your body should recognize the virus and have a head start."
12564,That‚Äôs the long term point of vaccines!
12565,"If you are otherwise healthy as well, there really isn‚Äôt that much to worry about."
12566,"If you have to travel, you do."
12567,"There are risks, but you‚Äôve already done what you can to minimize them (wear your mask)."
12568,"Odds are in your favor regardless of the outcome, basically, you‚Äôll almost certainly be fine in the end :)"
12569,That's fucking awful.
12570,My wife was in her chief year as an OBGYN resident went COVID hit and that experience definitely sounds familiar.
12571,"For her program at least, it sounds like some of the numbers got relaxed because residents had no way of hitting them while doing everything COVID related, so hopefully he gets a little slack too."
12572,It's not any better but that's 6 *staffed* beds.
12573,"Most hospitals have plenty of beds, but not the staff to take care of them."
12574,"That's the case where I work (in MS), anyway."
12575,The nursing shortage is real.
12576,This post appears to be about vaccines.

12580,[removed]
12581,I don't disagree with you on that.
12582,"If you were interested in doing so, you could find evidence that vaccinated people are dying a far lower rates than unvaccinated people."
12583,The mutation process is the same in vaccinated or unvaccinated.
12584,The one difference is that a mutation in a vaccinated person is more likely to be better at breakthrough.
12585,My point was that vaccinated people get breakthrough infection less than unvaccinated people get infection.
12586,"I could show you evidence of that, but I suspect you don't actually want to see it."
12587,"""Show me evidence"" usually means ""my position is unshakable""."
12588,I don't have a problem with that.
12589,Whatever decision you make about the vaccine for yourself will not have effects beyond you and your family.
12590,You get to do what you believe in and more power to you.
12591,Having zero empathy for those who insist on living in willful ignorance has become socially acceptable.
12592,"So, interestingly, I'm about to start trying for a family and my gyno ordered me a blood test that checks my antibody levels for the childhood vaccines (because if you need a booster, better to get it now instead of risking getting sick with baby)."
12593,"I'm still fully immune to measles, mumps, and rubella!"
12594,Maybe get a blood test if you're concerned?
12595,"FWIW, I'm 30."
12596,"In a world of ""blasts"" and ""destroys"" one headline writer came to change the game."
12597,What you mean to say is that viral load isn't the only metric to track.
12598,"We know the vaccine confers significant overall protection against infection, not just symptomatic infection, so that even if every breakthrough case has the exact same viral load vaccinated vs unvaccinated there will be far fewer vaccinated people who get infected at all and thus will contribute less to the overall mutation rate."
12599,This is the way.
12600,Started a new job a month ago.
12601,"Very nice people i work with, but biggest gripe i have with a few people are anti-vaxxers....

On my lunch break, i heard 2 people pushing the antivax talking points like ""the vaccine was made too fast"", ""microchips"" and ""Covid was a man-made virus""

I'm just going to keep to myself about it."
12602,"They're clearly set in their ways, i cant change anything."
12603,"I dont wanna wish anything bad on them, but its going to suck should anyone i work with get sick."
12604,If you're non-symptomatic chances are you have a very low viral load and your immune system is kicking it's butt.
12605,I dont see how anyone could get heart or brain damage from that.
12606,I hope people start suing DeSantis for gross negligence
12607,That article is wrong.
12608,"It states, "" However, British data indicates the Israeli studies may be overstating the case."""
12609,That is not a fair interpretation of the British data.
12610,The reason why is because the British study compared the effects of vaccines on the alpha vs the delta variant.
12611,"Critically, it made no distinction between which vaccine the person got."
12612,"Israel, however, has been vaccinated almost exclusively with the Pfizer vaccine."
12613,So its possible both studies can be true if the Pfizer vaccine is problematic in some way that the other vaccines are not.

12615,The UK barely closed its borders nor did they lockdown early enough.
12616,"Being an island is just one advantage, but it isn't a fix all by itself."
12617,"I would begrudgingly wear a mask around that coworker so as to not rock the boat, but if he's wearing an N95 he's not going to gain much or any additional protection from having everyone around him wear a mask - a respirator is legit PPE."
12618,My vaccine is far more effective than a piece of cloth from Old Navy that hasn't been washed in a week.
12619,"Frankly, the cloth and surgical masks that most people wear are next to useless in real life use in community settings, and widespread masking with cloth masks may well have led to MORE infections during last winter's surge because they gave a false sense of security."
12620,There's no solid data indicating that masking in the community does anything to reduce transmission rates.
12621,It's a huge failure of public health messaging to hold up masks as our savior - especially with no clearly identified metrics and thresholds at which masks can be discontinued.
12622,I will never understand how the CDC bombed it so badly.

12631,if the New iPhone comes out in october and in march there is a study that the iPhone works for 6 months you wont be scared that its gonna break after 7 Do you?
12632,"From what I can tell just cursory googling it, it seems to be the delay on the second dose."
12633,It‚Äôs been speculated/reported for a while now that delaying the second dose may be beneficial.
12634,"Of course if you want full immunity asap, it‚Äôs best not to delay (basically stick with your vaccines recommended schedule)."
12635,You have protection regardless.
12636,"The higher mRNA load doesn‚Äôt seem to correlate as much as the delay in 2nd dose does (but I can‚Äôt find a lot of sources for that in my 30 seconds of googling, so take with a large Reddit sized grain of salt)."
12637,Oh FFS.
12638,"It's off topic, but the idea that any problem we could just shoot would get off the ground in the US (much less in the *south*) is just ridiculously implausible."
12639,I unfortunately had a breakthrough covid case (was vaccinated with Pfizer).
12640,"My first symptom was on Thursday, July 29th."
12641,Had there been any research on how long people can test positive if they've been vaccinated?
12642,My doctor of course says don't test for 90 days but I have travel on August 21st that requires a negative PCR and wondering the likelihood of that working out (Vs. having to cancel).
12643,Thats painful and tragic.
12644,"Im sorry, but also glad you were able to escape your families lunacy."
12645,So you admit that mystical non-science-based coursework is involved in training a DO.
12646,That's all I'm trying to say.
12647,I totally agree with all the other stuff.
12648,7 months since your second dose?
12649,Wow I just got my second dose 3 days ago.
12650,Assuming you must have veen on the front line?
12651,Bad mod
12652,The spite and vitriol in US healthcare is coming from unvaccinated patients toward health care workers.
12653,[removed]
12654,They need to just approve the damn vaccine for children already.
12655,Safer risk than letting the kids all get Delta.
12656,why?
12657,?
12658,"It would be funny if it turned out that smoking weed curbed COVID-19, a drug which is currently still illegal in many jurisdictions and punished by significant prison time, if not sometimes the death penalty."
12659,and?
12660,"Yeah, well they are poor and unhygienic ""others."""
12661,"We have seen plenty of disease illness from other countries that never reached our shores, and it's so easy to think that it won't happen here."
12662,"I've seen people comment ""I am clean and wash my hands, so I don't need to worry."""
12663,"It also allows them to think ""oh, I'm not like them, I won't get sick"" and to disassociate."
12664,Those first couple months denying airborne training/overemphasizing hand washing really got in people's heads.
12665,&gt; there is a path that this virus mutates enough to bypass any vaccine and be much more severe.
12666,Source on this?
12667,Everything I've read basically says a vaccine for a new variant would be relatively easy to create now.
12668,"It's one thing when you are healthy and believe the people who say the illness isn't so bad or only affects older people with health issues, it's another thing to actually feel the illness ravaging your body and realize you aren't invulnerable."
12669,"Once people get sick, they probably get desperate."

12671,Only the USA exists.
12672,Mercola is an ignorant snake oil salesman.
12673,He makes so much money from peddling bullshit.
12674,Oh of course!
12675,I totally agree that what is necessary in the metro areas (maybe even GI) isn't absolutely necessary out west when there's 4 people per 10 square miles.
12676,"But they don't want to be told what to do, and gov."
12677,Penis-with-ears is just an obstructionist elite.

12685,"You walk in, give your name and get the shot."
12686,"I got my my second dose in may, so I am not even close to six months yet."
12687,"But later this year, I will get a third dose."
12688,I fully expect the USA to be on board with the rest of the world doing boosters already.
12689,Do you understand a vaccinated person probably won't and if they do it won't be severe?
12690,It's generally accepted that this means not withholding care either
12691,[deleted]
12692,Perhaps because they saw promise in their work?
12693,What would you do?
12694,Do all the hard work and just give it to someone else to profit from?
12695,We already know how Pfizer performs.
12696,Hoping Moderna is better means that would be more people protected than if it was the same as Pfizer.
12697,Different bodies react differently.
12698,"Anecdotally, having COVID before makes side effects from the 1st shot worse."
12699,The reason is just statistical.
12700,"Any given individual has the same chance, it just so happens most aren't in the US so the chance of it arising in the US is lower vs the rest of the world."
12701,Not sure how you think this is an effective argument.
12702,Everyone already agrees we need to push hard to get the whole world vaccinated.
12703,Delta+ Max
12704,Because it's not what people were told at the beginning (or very least explained)
12705,"Well Pfizer just reported that their efficacy dropped to 84% from ~95% in the original trial results, and they were looking at only the same timeframe that moderna is here (approximately September 2020 to March 2021)."
12706,"Fwiw I do think that they will prove to be quite similar in the real world as well, but based on a lot of recent data (not just this), I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if moderna has a bit of an edge."
12707,[removed]
12708,"I am, admittedly, doing the same thing with my tetanus booster."
12709,"I‚Äôm going to get it eventually, but I keep procrastinating, and I don‚Äôt make a habit of playing with rusty metal so it doesn‚Äôt feel urgent."
12710,"I can‚Äôt imagine feeling that way about Covid, though, that shit sneaks up on you."
12711,I scheduled my appointment as quickly as possible and dropped everything to get there on time.
12712,I mean yeah that‚Äôs very true.
12713,You can put a lot of very vague stuff in an earnings release which is preferable to getting too specific and getting it wrong.
12714,"From my perspective with my experience auditing and reviewing earnings releases as well as testing controls over earnings release preparation and review, it‚Äôs just possible that given what type of number that is and the level of detail given that 93% might not mean to us what we would think from seeing a 93% efficacy claim."
12715,And I wouldn‚Äôt rush to conclusions until the full study/data is published as that‚Äôs more clarifying than a single operating stat meant to make Moderna look strong in an earnings release slide deck.
12716,"^ Exactly, since it's just the aches/fever associated with a robust immune response and nothing else (for me, at least) it's pretty easy/chill to ride out."
12717,I had probably a 102 fever and still worked for most of the day (remotely).
12718,The Hippocratic* Oath doesn't say they must help morons at the expense of others.
12719,It says they must not do harm.
12720,"And no, doctors are not trained to help the sickest first, because sometimes the sickest are beyond saving in a war zone, which is what idiotic antivaxxers insist on making this situation."
12721,&gt;We could hit zero daily cases in the continental United States and it wouldn‚Äôt change a damn thing in that regard.
12722,"Sure it would, then we'd actually have the ability to contact trace effectively, and that 100 percent vaccinated population would have some protection, though lower, against the spread and you could control outbreaks much easier with local minimal impacts."
12723,"Just a short update on this live blog but worth posting as it‚Äôs great news:

&gt; Yelp now has a feature that will allow businesses to list if they have vaccine requirements."
12724,The feature was mentioned at the White House's COVID-19 briefing Thursday.
12725,Peds cardiac ICU nurse here.
12726,Garden variety COVID decimated quite a few kids that came through our unit over the last year.
12727,Some had comorbidities and others were perfectly healthy.
12728,A few ended up on ECMO.
12729,There is a feeling of impending doom when we talk about the fall and respiratory season this year.
12730,A lot of things are lining up to be a perfect storm.
12731,"You smell that, Randy?"
12732,"Not the correct ""Indians"" here friend"
12733,This is most states right now.
12734,"Hell Minnesota, which has a relatively high vaccination rate has less than a dozen ICU beds statewide last I looked."
12735,This surge is going to overwhelm every states healthcare system regardless of their vaccination rate because NONE of the states actually managed to reach a high enough level to drop the R0 below 1 with Delta being in the 5-8 range.
12736,Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better... yet again.
12737,"It will take being voted out, then driven out of Florida, for DeSatan to realize that his handling of this virus has been one enormous disaster."
12738,"Reading about his press release in the comments, it seems that he's completely divorced from reality and highly delusional."
12739,"He's fit to serve... a prison sentence for reckless endangerment, times Florida's population."
12740,"I really hope the prick suffers for this, preferably in a jail cell with a large fellow with incorrectly spelled words inked on his knuckles and knowledge of where the new fish's teeth belong."
12741,"We're furious with you too, tell your friends."
12742,"Perhaps, idk."
12743,"But since it‚Äôs easy and not at all inconvenient or traumatic to simply *not take a 2 year old out*, it‚Äôs what I would do."
12744,"&gt;The company said its vaccine remains 90% effective against preventing Covid-19 disease for at least six months, but said it sees a decline in antibody levels after six months, especially against newer strains of the coronavirus including the Delta variant."
12745,üëÄ
12746,Not sure why you're getting downvoted.
12747,I guess I'm not calling OP a liar.
12748,But I'm also assuming the JHU data is accurate.
12749,"So likely there's some delay/disconnect between the two (without malicious intent) 

It's weird to me for people to be here to be so critical of data/information that goes against their beliefs but as soon as someone chimes in asking for proof/data/sources for something that supports their beliefs, they are downvoted like they are a bad person for daring to question or ask for any sort of proof aside from a single anecdotal story."
12750,"Heck, if nothing else it could point to change/learning opportunity (ie *improvement*) to identify/rectify any discrepancies between what is *actually* happening in a hospital vs. what is being reported."
12751,"Regardless of what that outcome is, we're all better for getting it straight and should be pushing for consistent, accurate, transparent, and toughough data."
12752,There are not very many alternatives that are also affordable for us :/
12753,"&gt;	Historically, vaccines haven‚Äôt offered sterilizing immunity from disease (HPV may be an acception)."
12754,There are many more vaccines than HPV that provide sterilizing or near-sterilizing immunity.
12755,"Prevention of infection is always the first, ideal goal of a vaccine."
12756,"With the original variants, we had it, or something close to it, on top of protection against hospitalization and death."
12757,"Variants have changed the game, in conjunction with waning antibodies."
12758,"&gt;	The important thing, and the focus of our concern I think, should be protection from severe illness and death."
12759,What about the cases in between?
12760,"There are plenty of ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases that sure as hell don‚Äôt feel mild, and that‚Äôs not including long Covid"
12761,[deleted]
12762,Over something with a 99% survival rating?
12763,Why?

12765,An N95 with 10% inward leakage gives you 150 minutes before an infectious dose.
12766,A surgical mask only gives you 30 minutes protection by comparison.
12767,[removed]
12768,It's a great vaccine for preventing serious disease.
12769,It's even better if you supplement it with an mRNA vaccine dose.
12770,Personally If I only had a single shot of J&amp;J I would get a dose of moderna of pfizer but don't worry too much.
12771,You are still well protected from serious disease.
12772,A dose of an mRNA vaccine will likely decrease your odds of getting symptomatic infection so may be worth considering.
12773,You just need to pop into a wallgreens.

12775,I can't find the study itself but below are two academic articles referring to points from it.
12776,"I was wrong on some of the details, it was over 400 participants and they were 60 yo or over."
12777,Did you miss the study that the UK did a month or so ago showing the same thing?
12778,"Their study if I remember correctly showed that the average person that gets Delta specifically and is hospitalized, loses IQ points or has cognitive decline equal to the average stroke patient."
12779,"If someone that has Delta needs to be intubated, it is double the cognitive decline seen in the average stroke patient."
12780,"I still can't find any information specifically regarding breakthrough cases with vaccinated people, but I disagree that mild cases mean there was a low viral load and therefore no risk of long-term effects."

12812,"&gt;Florida‚Äôs COVID hospitalizations hit new all time high, reaching nearly 13,000 admissions by mid-day Thursday  
&gt;  
&gt;By Cindy Krischer Goodman  
&gt;  
&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel |Aug 05, 2021 at 11:48 AM  
&gt;  
&gt;The COVID surge continues in Florida with hospitals reporting new record-breaking admissions for the virus on Thursday."
12813,"&gt;  
&gt;As of mid-day, 12,888 people in the state had been admitted to a hospital for COVID, even more than the 12,408 admissions that had been an all-time high a day earlier."
12814,"The new COVID admissions record comes even with only 255 or 261 hospitals in the state reporting COVID admissions to US Health and Human Services, which provides the information on its website."
12815,"&gt;  
&gt;Critically ill COVID patients now fill 2,577 intensive care beds in Florida‚Äôs hospitals, occupying about 89% of available beds, with all 261 hospitals reporting.With COVID admissions continuing and patients coming to hospitals for emergency care, Florida Hospital Association expects 60% of hospitals in the state to face a ‚Äúcritical staffing shortage‚Äù in the next seven days."
12816,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúCurrent hospitalizations and the growth rate continue to be extremely troubling,‚Äù Mary C. Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association, said in a statement.As the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in Florida continues to spike, the state‚Äôs hospital systems started making plans to suspend elective procedures."
12817,Nurses and physicians report they are working seven days a week as emergency rooms continue to see patients arrive with COVID symptoms.
12818,"&gt;  
&gt;Breaking News Alerts NewsletterMemorial Healthcare System announced Wednesday its five South Broward hospitals will suspend elective medical procedures starting Aug. 9 ‚Äúto conserve critical resources for the care of COVID-19 patients.‚Äù Memorial‚Äôs hospitals will continue to treat patients who need emergency care for non-COVID reasons, and the rehabilitation and cancer centers remain open."
12819,"&gt;  
&gt;Cleveland Clinic Florida‚Äôs Weston hospital has postponed some elective procedures, as has Broward Health North."
12820,"&gt;  
&gt;In Palm Beach County, Baptist‚Äôs Boca Raton Regional Hospital, Bethesda East and Bethesda West hospitals are postponing elective surgeries on an individual basis.With COVID admissions continuing and patients coming to hospitals for emergency care, Florida Hospital Association expects 60% of hospitals in the state to face a ‚Äúcritical staffing shortage‚Äù in the next seven days."

&gt;Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at [cgoodman@sunsentinel.com](mailto:cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.Cindy)"
12823,There was a study posted on here a week ago.
12824,I can't remember the source
12825,"I didn't mislead you, you just incorrectly assumed."
12826,Taking a calculated risk and getting vaccinated while still having legitimate concerns is possible.
12827,The catch is these articles never give raw numbers.
12828,Let me illustrate with an example.
12829,"If 5 people out of a 100 hospitalized are in that age group it‚Äôs 5%, now if 5 people out of 25 hospitalized are in that age group it‚Äôs 20% and the ‚Äúrate has quadrupled‚Äù, but clearly the situation has not actually gotten worse for that age group."
12830,It‚Äôs gotten better for the other age groups.
12831,So saying ‚Äúa fifth of hospitalizations are 18-34yo‚Äù is kind of meaningless click bait without more context.
12832,This is republican healthcare.
12833,Let em die
12834,That was the case primarily because antibody levels were still very high.
12835,"To the best of my understanding the scientific expectation has always been for protection from infection to wane, considerably, over time."
12836,"Historically, vaccines haven‚Äôt offered sterilizing immunity from disease (HPV may be an acception)."
12837,"The important thing, and the focus of our concern I think, should be protection from severe illness and death."
12838,"Don't worry, we're furious with you, too."
12839,;)
12840,"&gt;I don't mean this to sound snarky at all, but I really just do not have this kind of faith in people anymore."
12841,"Yeah, I'm not sure what to tell you, honestly."
12842,"People are going to be selfish, ignorant, and all that regardless it seems like."
12843,The only difference seems to be what people use as an excuse.
12844,"Looks like .00001 or 1 for every 100,000 infections if I‚Äôm reading [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/30/key-numbers-cdcs-new-assessment-delta-variant/) properly."
12845,No.
12846,There's no real reason for it yet.
12847,"\*perfectly\* balanced, as all things should be."
12848,"&amp;#x200B;

you need the same number of syllables on each side of the comma."
12849,"Talking with people from the other side, it seems they are under the impression that vaccines are meant to be a force field of sorts which blocks out viral infections entirely; as opposed to simply significantly reducing the possibility of hospitalization and death."
12850,[removed]
12851,"They don't have any money, that's why theyre on Medicaid."
12852,We'll all be paying for it
12853,&gt;Antibodies contribute to immunity.
12854,Yes they do.
12855,But not in the way your thinking.
12856,If anything waiting is worse than getting it now.
12857,Especially if they order boosters.
12858,By winter you could have 3-4 shots instead of 1-2 and not have time for your body to react properly and then get covid at the same time when levels get high again.
12859,"He used to be very sensible and seemed like a real doctor that cared about his influence, but he went off the deep end a few years ago with conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine bullshit."
12860,"Too bad, he could have really helped people if he wasn‚Äôt so crazy."
12861,Even meat that is grass fed has less arachidonic acid than traditional meat which is inflammatory.
12862,Omega 3 is key.
12863,Look at your cooking oils (coconut is better than canola for example).
12864,Antinoxidants are good but watch sugar content.
12865,Essentially we eat pro inflammatory diets which is a problem bc we‚Äôre in a heightened level of inflammation.
12866,You want to reduce this.
12867,"If you‚Äôre obese, COVID likes you."
12868,"If you are diabetic, especially type 2, COVID likes you."
12869,You want to achieve normal markers of inflammation and your diet is key.
12870,"I bet, huge money in play."
12871,"But I'll wait to hear from CDC first, at which point I will run to the vaccination site"
12872,Almost all the people in hospital and dying are unvaccinated.
12873,Sounds like its working pretty well to me.
12874,Have you seen the size of his office and home?
12875,The man lives better than some kings.
12876,I assume that's what changed.
12877,There's more profit in snake oil than there is in medical service.
12878,"I think that as long as hospitals are overflowing, it is reasonable to freak out."
12879,"Areas where hospitals are not overflowing, but are near areas where they are, should also be concerned."
12880,I got both my J&amp;J shot here in Vegas at the VA Hospital and the only effects I got was the urge to play video poker
12881,[removed]
12882,That's the quality of response I'm looking for.
12883,Have not clicked.
12884,Still might not.
12885,But it's here for anyone else that might think like me.
12886,You have no good reason to be concerned.
12887,The data is still very good that you'll be fine.
12888,"Ah yes, the classic grifter arc."
12889,they're finding similar viral loads in asymptomatic people but I am guessing that the risk of the autoimmune reaction which is thought to cause most of the covid related damage is low
12890,"Say they come out with a booster soon, that would show on your paperwork."
12891,If I sneak in and get a shot it would go on a new card and I would only know I did it.
12892,"In order to fly to places, example Hawaii has this I know, you have to upload to Safe Travels."
12893,You scan in your vax card for proof of both dosages and they are 14 days past the second.
12894,I do not know if on the ground places will pass things.
12895,I want to say California is????
12896,"Not sure of all the details, but it would get very confusing to show proof if done differently than intended."
12897,Those are autoantibodies aka antibodies that attack yourself and are different from the ones vaccines are supposed to induce.
12898,Source: i have an autoimmune disease
12899,"Or the definition of ""normal"" has changed drastically and you're simply in denial."
12900,In January I moved from Toronto to a small ski town in Quebec.
12901,I am so thankful to hear that the province is doing this because our quiet town gets loads of ski and snowboard tourists in the winter.
12902,This definitely makes me feel a lot safer.
12903,Glad they‚Äôre taking this seriously.
12904,"&gt; Sending volunteers to get their legs blown off in some godforsaken corner of the world for no discernible reason is fine, though."
12905,"""They hate our freedom."""
12906,That 99.9% stat isn‚Äôt how you judge efficacy.
12907,There‚Äôs no evidence to suggest that immunity degrades after six months.
12908,The stylist posted above shows only that immunity is still robust after 6 months.
12909,There‚Äôs no data on post-6 months yet.
12910,"I didn‚Äôt know there were third doses being given in some countries, where?"
12911,I only mean to say that we should prioritise vaccinating those that have not received any vaccines first.
12912,I agree with the other replies that yours is a somewhat privileged position.
12913,"The year is 2021, and I'm still having to lock threads for anti-Native American bullshit."
12914,Except the vaccines weren't dirt cheap.
12915,They were *free*.
12916,I think that's too early to call.
12917,"At least the numbers in Missouri are based on death certificates, and it can take weeks before those are available and classified."
12918,This talk is unrealistic.
12919,"Most of the hospitals can probably flex extra space, and beds into makeshift ICUs."
12920,"However, staff is already basically at their breaking point before they have to stretch them even more thin."
12921,Called one of my nieces who is an icu nurse in Little Rock.
12922,She texted her sister (also a nurse) in Conway and they confirmed this is a lie
12923,A few podcast interviews that I listened to recently.
12924,The experts felt pretty good about a vaccine for 5-11 yos being approved by fall.
12925,"Not in time for school to start, but likely soon after school starts."
12926,"Of course not a guarantee, but educated estimates."
12927,"Can't remember which interviews specifically, but the interviews I've heard recently were with these experts: Ashish Jha, Michael Osterholm, Andy Slavitt, and Eric Topol."
12928,The podcasts were In the Bubble and Conversations with Bill Kristol.
12929,Highly recommend Bill Kristol's interview with Ashish Jha for anyone who wants a really straightforward balanced explanation of what's happening now and how to handle it.
12930,had I know up front that pfizer vaccine depended on an extra step performed by humans who are not being strictly monitored I would have gotten a different vaccine.
12931,ITT: everyone kvetches over media coverage in an attempt to rationalize their own indifference.
12932,"It's a pandemic, yall."
12933,"There are a lot of moving parts, and a lot of data points to sift through."
12934,Your dissatisfaction with the tone of headlines is not an adequate excuse for wallowing in cynicism and self-indulgence.
12935,[removed]
12936,This seems to be a decent [survey of recent information](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/vaccines-remain-largely-effective-against-delta-variant-counter-to-claims-from-fox-news-guest/).
12937,"My takeaway is that protection is a continuum, it is not absolute."
12938,"If you have vaccination, you have good protection against being infected and very good protection against illness."
12939,"However, it is less protective against delta than earlier variants."
12940,"And there have been clusters of people who have been vaccinated that all got infected in the same event, so there seems to be a chance the protection can be overcome if you're in enough of a virus-laden situation."
12941,The shit winds are coming
12942,This post appears to be about vaccines.

12946,What will happen if I get COVID after fully vaccinated?Do I need  2 doses after?
12947,I work in EMS and was able to receive my first dose in January
12948,It still continues?
12949,This doesn't mean it ends at 6 months.
12950,It means you still have 93% chance of not being infected/ non symptomatic.
12951,&gt;~~Hospital~~ execs are greedy scum.
12952,Fixed that for you.
12953,Haha I felt the exact same way.
12954,The side effects hit me like a train 7 hours after getting the shot but after 24 hours it was all gone.
12955,I laugh about it now.
12956,Much rather go through those side effects than experience the suffering that comes with recovering with COVID
12957,"What does ""get back to normal"" even mean?"
12958,A return to what things were like before Oct 2019?
12959,That world disappeared forever and irreversibly the moment this virus transmitted  from one human to another for the very first yime.
12960,[deleted]
12961,"Please link to this study, as that makes very little sense."
12962,I‚Äôm saying hospitals were often struggling to accommodate all of the usual cases before covid.
12963,I agree with you that people who allow themselves to become obese or smoke are also clogging the system.
12964,"My point is that the system was already clogged, and now it‚Äôs being overwhelmed by a preventable pandemic."
12965,I‚Äôm not sure personal experience is helpful here.
12966,We all only know a very small number of people and it doesn‚Äôt add anything to talk about what reactions they had.

12979,"Sunday River I hear is good, Im not a skier though."
12980,The day to day stat doesnt mean anything.
12981,Usually people use the 7-day rolling stat or the stat of the entire wave or the total stat for comparison to eliminate outside factors and random chance that can influence everyday stat.
12982,"Also Vietnam's 393 deaths reported today are aggregated deaths from August 1 to August 5, not today's death count, so averaging 78.6 deaths per day for the those 3 days in comparison to Thailand's 188 deaths of today."
12983,That help if the people I know who don't want the vaccine also are the same people who refuse health insurance.
12984,They say it's too expensive and think Obamacare is a scam.
12985,"Yes they should, but also anyone on the front lines."

12987,"It‚Äôs shitty that many countries are still failing to secure doses for their citizens, but that isn‚Äôt any of our fault."
12988,Information I have found on the topic actually points to India being a major contributor for this after they decided to stop exporting vaccines from on of their manufacturers.
12989,It‚Äôs not black and white ‚Äúthe first world is too greedy‚Äù.
12990,The countries that are failing to vaccinate for covid  due to supply are the same countries that fail to vaccinate for a myriad of viruses.
12991,They are places where access to clean drinking water is limited and cholera still runs rampant.
12992,"Something that could be solved through purification plants, but their countries lack the resources to provide basic human necessities to their citizens."

13049,"That source only mentions delta once, and it's not a scientific study."

13062,Like the vaccine gives them a protective bubble.
13063,We learned Delta doesnt care about the vaccine when it comes to being contagious and community spread.
13064,Correlation is not causation
13065,In the end these vaccines won't protect you from getting it unless we have boosters every year which seems like a bad idea generally for many reasons.
13066,In the end the only thing that matters long term is severe disease.
13067,The Oxford vaccine is actually the best for this as the technology provides the best t-cell response.

13114,"I know so, so many religious people who have not gotten the vaccine and are continuing to go to large gatherings, ignore masks, etc."
13115,"The idea that people will inherently follow everything their religious leaders tell them to do is something that's been disproven to me literally hundreds of times over the past year and a half, even when those people will turn around and use religion to protect themselves from criticism."

13120,This is why the AZ vaccine is the best.

13135,Source?
13136,"Yes, but it is only 1/80 because most breakthrough cases go untracked."
13137,Depends on the vaccine.
13138,Oxford/AZ vaccine is a technology designed to give a better t-cell (long term against severe disease) response.
13139,mRNA vaccines like Moderna are designed to give a better antibody response (make you not get it in the first year or so).

13158,Being vaccinated doesnt give everyone who got a vaccine to do as they please.

13249,Yeah I got my vaccine in March (Pfizer) and got pregnant in May.

13258,"The intent of the phrase isn't to say ""not my problem because I got the vaccine""."
13259,It is meant to call attention to the fact that the data shows that vaccinated people truly are SIGNIFICANTLY safer than unvaccinated people.
13260,"Just use N95 and place a regular surgical mask over it to protect the filter, that way you can use it for longer."
13261,"Based on how effective vaccines are against hospitalization and death from Delta, I'm tempted to say that I'd rather get Delta right now with my vaccine at its peak effectiveness than take the chance on the next mutation... that's assuming that getting Delta would actually help prevent me from getting the next one."
13262,they really don't have that data yet

13275,What‚Äôs wrong with wearing heavy eye makeup?
13276,The same people that get the flu shot yearly probably care about their health.
13277,"I bet on the whole they are healthier, and more active."
13278,I think you are right.
13279,EU has exported more than half of its production and the donations are likely to be from its own surplus.
13280,"Basically the same as every vaccine peoducing country in the world,  aside from exporting a larger svaret of its production."

13286,Nah those aren‚Äôt fun.
13287,The cool part of playing barbies is to play with beautiful fashionistas.
13288,I was born in 86 so grew up in the age of Barbie and I never wanted to look like Barbie.
13289,People who blame Barbie for eating disorders or bad body image would blame anything.
13290,You ever post a comment to Reddit... on weed?
13291,"Yes, but is that data share between the state and a wallgreens."
13292,Most likely no.
13293,We dont have centralized and socialized healthcare so why would different medical entities share data or talk to one another without patient consent.
13294,Well off label prescriptions are actually very common in the US - 1 in 5 according to google
13295,The best case scenario relies on 95% of the people masking up and a continued surge in vaccinations so that's not happening.
13296,Really hope they get that 11 &amp; under vaccine ready soon.
13297,That would be the vaccine surge we need.

13301,*
13302,Based off the EUA discussions pre delta I was 50/50 on it getting approved for under 12.
13303,The advisory board was very divided on the topic
13304,It went from stopping infection to dying so much for pandemic of unvaxxed
13305,"While probably more prone to it, D.O."
13306,generally are regular physicians these days.
13307,A lot of it is just what your medical school was a hundred years ago or so.
13308,"If they're board certified in their field, then you're good to go, whether M.D."
13309,or D.O.
13310,I'm not sure how that applies to my comment above but it is true.
13311,At the same time the odd's of incorrect dilution for a vaccine being distributed so widely is pretty low.
13312,Many drugs require dilution at point of care so this isn't something out of the ordinary.
13313,"1/80 deaths isn‚Äôt actually that reassuring, considering the cfr of unvaxxed covid."
13314,"well we currently use 1.7 earths a year, id say lose the dumbasses and the weaklings and were a lot better off... edit: if i turn out to be either of those id be happy to give my life up btw

please note that im am saying this out off... well, pure frustration."
13315,Humanity can only move forward as fast as its slowest person and right now that means going backwards.
13316,I feel for the healthcare people more than I do for the unvaccinated patients.
13317,"This is probably why, along with an intense dislike of blood and needles, I never considered healthcare as an occupation."
13318,"Yeah... the comment that was deleted just said (to the parent) ""your son will probably get it and be fine, but will probably spread it to you and the family."""
13319,"Which doesn't sound incivil at all to me, just the truth, to help above parent wrap their mind around situation."
13320,Kind of sketch that mods are deleting posts that are just about likelihood of kids getting Covid at school.
13321,"Also for film crews, not paid if unable to verify"
13322,"And because they‚Äôre rationing the heck out of them, plenty of patients who would normally qualify for ICU care are shunted to stepdown units or even med-surg where staff have more patients and cannot monitor them as closely."
13323,Sad thing is that we may never fully know how many people died because of COVID.
13324,"Not actually dying from it, but because they couldn‚Äôt get proper care for their other condition because COVID patients exhausted healthcare resources."
13325,Because the IQ level in Maine is on a whole different level than Texas and Florida.
13326,Vaccination rates by state seem to directly correlate to intelligence levels.
13327,Ha.
13328,No no.
13329,"This is all from white redditors, frankly."
13330,You are 100 percent correct about religiosity.
13331,"It's huge in the black community, and is all about willfully denying science."
13332,"(Source: me, a guy married to a black woman who gets dragged to church)"
13333,Last year was when I realized that I had to buy a big battery and a solar panel because the Texas government will literally let my family freeze to death in downtown Austin.
13334,[removed]
13335,[removed]
13336,Are we really going to fight over which vaccine is better?
13337,AFAIK Pfizer has tiny bit higher efficacy.
13338,"But that is that, not quite of a deal breaking difference."
13339,[removed]
13340,"It‚Äôs very possible and if we wanted todo it, we could."
13341,There just is no interest.
13342,"We managed to distribute vaccines, we could manage not to waste the worlds most precious resource if we wanted to do so."
13343,[removed]
13344,So it‚Äôs not actually a religious belief.

13389,google covid trials children in \[your state\]
13390,Thanks.
13391,We have some; looking for more.
13392,The school doesn't even provide any masks.
13393,Some surgical ones are in vending machines.
13394,I am in a bit of a shock nothing is being done at the school to prepare for the year.
13395,"I want to say we'll be lucky, I'll be ok, but I really have no idea."
13396,Not originally from Texas so this is all mind-blowing.
13397,My second dose is in about a week.
13398,"Thrilled to be covid-19 free until now, but not exactly looking forward to getting my ass kicked by my immune system for a few days."
13399,He said it doesn‚Äôt matter because people aren‚Äôt going home and wearing them in private.
13400,"He can mandate it in public all day long but people go and spread it in private and our local Heath officials say the chances of passing it on in public are minuscule to passing it on at home, but you‚Äôll never even get the staunchest of mask wearers to wear them at home."
13401,"And also said cloth masks and paper surgical masks barely do anything to stop or slow the spread of covid, so everyone would need to wear an N95 or better and that‚Äôs also not happening."
13402,"I think they were just trapped in the conservative culture bubble that downplayed the virus as no big deal, totally fine to do business as usual."
13403,"So maybe they didn‚Äôt feel strongly about anything, but if virus is *clearly* nothing to worry about, then getting vaccinated against it is not something to prioritize (and if you wait a bit longer, more data will come out or a safer gen 2 vaccine will be released)."
13404,[deleted]
13405,[deleted]
13406,"The problem with this line of thinking is that when the virus runs rampant within the unvaccinated population, there's always a chance that the virus will mutate into something that can defeat the vaccine."
13407,"There's a new COVID variant, Lambda, which has shown in a study (although not yet peer-reviewed) to be more vaccine resistant than other variants."
13408,Their fuck-ups are gonna hurt people who are doing everything right.
13409,Those in power in my state are the source of misinformation.
13410,Floriduh is screwed and they are so dumb that they don't even know it!
13411,"Damn I must have gotten lucky with mine, I felt a little groggy after my second but nothing too bad"
13412,Not as many as you think.
13413,The nurses refusing the vax are the same ones who don't care for COVID and find every excuse not to help in the hospital.
13414,Good riddance.
13415,Cleaning up the profession as far as I'm concerned.
13416,"Yep, so less efficient immune systems waning faster is unfortunate but not unexpected."
13417,We are looking at yearly boosters now.
13418,Myocarditis?
13419,Is this because this variant is more contagious snd more kids are getting it or because it is more seriously impacting kids?
13420,Both?
13421,Correct but the risks of being hospitalized are far greater when unvaccinated.
13422,That‚Äôs a big risk for our healthcare industry (a lot of insurance isn‚Äôt cross-borders).
13423,Additionally research indicates your viral load is lower when vaccinated with a breakthrough case making you less likely to infect someone else.
13424,The R value for non vaccinated is 6 (meaning you will spread rona to 6 other people on average).
13425,I haven‚Äôt seen the R for breakthrough cases for vaccinated individuals but it‚Äôs lower.
13426,"Even if that might be a good idea, there'd be a near-instant lawsuit a next-day injunction by some federal court or another."
13427,so CBD gummies?
13428,I‚Äôm vaccinated but worry about my baby
13429,Imagine a hotel being at capacity.
13430,"All the rooms are booked, but more people keep coming."
13431,"Most importantly, this hotel absolutely cannot turn people away."
13432,"They just have to do their best, so they take their temporary cots and start putting people in the hallways and in other people's rooms."
13433,"Furthermore, imagine that they also don't have enough housekeeping staff to clean the rooms and change the sheets every day."
13434,That's what it means for a hospital to be over capacity.
13435,It's not like a gallon jug where you somehow fit two and a half gallons of milk in it.
13436,It's more like a capacity limit set by a fire marshal.
13437,"Yeah, you can physically fit more people in there, but not safely and people will die because of it."
13438,Is there any sort of consensus on how much asymptomatic cases spread the delta variant?
13439,It‚Äôs inconceivable to me that mother‚Äôs would risk leaving their young kids motherless.
13440,Children are even more of a reason to get vaccinated even if you don‚Äôt care about your own risk.
13441,I‚Äôm very sorry this happened.
13442,[deleted]
13443,"""But in vaccinated people, the replication soon alerts the immune system to send blood-borne antibodies that neutralize the virus in the nose and throat, Leal says."
13444,"Another new preprint from scientists in Singapore found that although vaccinated and unvaccinated patients infected with Delta had similar viral loads when diagnosed, those loads declined more rapidly in the vaccinated."
13445,"‚ÄúBased on basic immunology, that‚Äôs exactly what we would expect‚Äîthat vaccinated individuals would clear the infection much faster,‚Äù says Kristian Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at Scripps Research."""
13446,This is note I found most interesting.
13447,It does looks like vaccinated people can transmit virus but the window is much shorter (i.e.
13448,overall transmit less virus).

13455,Both are a form of belief but different in their application.
13456,Agreed.
13457,I hate the damn things and now I‚Äôve got to decide to either not go and forfeit all the money I‚Äôve spent or go and suck it up which is probably what I‚Äôll do because I‚Äôve been looking forward to this for two damn years now.
13458,Aren't the elderly most likely to be early vaccinees?
13459,Wonder about mixed doses.
13460,Politicians voted in by a stupid populace.

13469,My best friend is a resident physician at a large hospital in central Arkansas.
13470,"I stayed with him for a few months in 2020, before moving abroad."
13471,Most of his colleagues--including doctors--did not give two single shits about COVID.
13472,They were having house parties and get-togethers almost nonstop.
13473,"Meanwhile, his program coordinators were sponsoring weekly barbecues, meet-ups, and pub sessions for first-year residents."
13474,I wish they would have used a reptentent anti-vaxer as opposed to an unfortunate soul who probably had dozens of factors working against her to get the shot.
13475,"ETA: Most critically, she was probably surrounded by people who don't really take care of themselves because of the expense and burden."
13476,It's practically cultural to ignore one's health in poorer less educated American communities.
13477,For a state that has let their people freeze to death it seems sadly not a huge surprise.
13478,i got moderna and felt nothing.
13479,no arm sorenss and no sickness.
13480,is this caused by already having had covid and thus minimal immune response?
13481,or just different bodies react differently?

13570,I work for a large financial firm that won't even respond to employees *in Florida* about whether they're rethinking their return to office plan.
13571,"Plus we're getting extremely limited communication about the cases we know have been in the office, so it's hard/impossible to even accurately weigh the risk."

13579,"Still, would do again as you said."
13580,The faces on those dolls aren't any more realistic.
13581,I was expecting acne or wrinkles or maybe some receding hairlines on male dolls.
13582,But it's just as idealized just in a different style.
13583,And every single one of those dolls would be described as thin.
13584,"Objectively, those dolls aren't any more inclusive or realistic than the current lines of Barbie dolls."
13585,Why did they prescribe you antibiotics for a virus?

13592,If it doesn‚Äôt make you unwell beyond being mildly ill that‚Äôs not enough of a reason to worry long-run is it?
13593,Who has to stay home for six weeks?
13594,No one did in the US.
13595,Anyone else lose friends over them not getting vaccinated?
13596,I assume the booster would just be another dose.
13597,"You'd only have to stay home if you had bad side effects, kind of like the normal flu shot."
13598,If you were being super cautious you might have to wait 2 weeks to reach full immunity.
13599,Can Corona mutate to a whole new virus that can kill everyone?

13624,"QUESTION:

I've been fully vaxxed since March and I had COVID early on in the pandemic, and I've been going to the gym regularly for the past 6 weeks to get back into shape, doing tons of cardio and lifting a good amount-- all without wearing a mask."
13625,"I DID wear a mask for a bit before the statewide dropping of indoor masks back on June 15, but happily ditched it the day that happened."
13626,"Fast forward to yesterday: my county has reinstated an indoor mask mandate, but the gym in my apartment complex hasn't said anything about having to wear a mask, and I'm kinda wondering if I should take a bit of a hiatus until they can ensure that only vaccinated people can work out without a mask."
13627,Any thoughts on this?
13628,"Am I being overly paranoid, or should I just try to work out during off peak times when the gym is empty and/or wear a mask when doing a long cardio sash?"

13661,That‚Äôs easy to say but some people have rare disorders and can‚Äôt get vaccinated.
13662,I am üíØ vaccinated so not referring to myself.
13663,I have a friend with a rare blood disorder who can‚Äôt.
13664,There are some are are skeptical for legit reasons given our nation‚Äôs history with everything from Tuskegee to internment camps who have legit trust concerns.
13665,We have to do  a better job with the PR and social media is fanning the flames big time as FB algo literally promotes nonsense.
13666,Too much
13667,Case counts are more or less irrelevant statistic anymore.
13668,Even Scott G. has said that he believes we're now reporting 1 out of 10 infections.
13669,Where with previous waves we might have been reporting 30-40% of cases.
13670,This is because many of those getting sick are either vaccinated and/or younger.
13671,Many simply won't bother to get tested because the infection is at most an inconvenience.
13672,"I am not saying we shouldn't track cases, but using them as some sort of barometer doesn't really make sense anymore."
13673,[deleted]
13674,Is it really all the CDC's fault though?
13675,There was pressure to open things back up again and remove mandates as soon as vaccinations surged.
13676,The first thing some members of my family did after being vaccinated was go to India.
13677,"In April, when the delta variant was just ramping up there."
13678,"People should've held off on non-essential travel until vaccination rates and covid cases went up and down, respectively."
13679,"But no, maskless crowds at Disney, music festivals, people treating life as if everything's back to normal."
13680,"Even with the vaccine, you can still get covid."
13681,"It'll protect you a lot more than being unvaccinated, but vaccinated or not, right now it's still a group effort to get things under control until everyone in the world has had ample opportunity to get the vaccine, not just in America."
13682,"And the people who choose not to get vaccinated, you're holding up others' lives."
13683,I have zero sympathy for them if they get covid.
13684,I agree.
13685,Adults should be sent home.
13686,"It isn't fair to the lady having a stroke, or the guy that was hit by a car."
13687,"I mean come on, we're done begging them to get vaccinated."
13688,"At this point, to hell with them."
13689,Vaccines have EUA.
13690,And was promoted by a big conservative all last year.
13691,In fact many conservatives were upset it wasn't released months earlier in 2020 than it actually was.
13692,"&gt;""We're very close to that vaccine as you know and I think much closer than I think most people want to say,"" Trump said during a White House press briefing Wednesday."
13693,"""We think we can start some time in October."

13698,"Yeah, political."
13699,/$
13700,Check the vaccine and masking rates for those countries.
13701,The UK especially had a sharp drop because they have such high vaccination numbers.
13702,Meanwhile some of these areas are still sitting at 35% vaccinated and hate masking.
13703,"Also, do you remember any stories about the Netherlands hospitals being overrun and struggling to find oxygen?"
13704,What do you suppose happens to every other patient when the hospitals are full?
13705,Oh jeez im so sorry.
13706,Do you mind sharing your medical history/age?
13707,Im just concerned cus i got moderna as well.
13708,[819 total](http://imgur.com/a/ogdGkCe).
13709,And the real worrisome part is that doctors and nurses are reporting that patients are expiring much more quickly than last year.
13710,"Where a patient may have been in the ICU for weeks, with this strain, it's more like days."
13711,So these beds are turning quickly.
13712,The third dose is going to be AstraZeneca for 55+.
13713,People younger than 54 will eventually get a Pfizer dose (In september)
13714,Anybody get a bloody nose after a covid nasal swab?
13715,I've got a friend that is leaning towards being a Covid disbeliever (read a few too many denial and antivax tweets recently) and I'd like to use these articles to show that some people were like her but then had family or friends affected by it.
13716,"Anyone know of a compilation of these ""leopards are my face"" articles?"
13717,"Sorry, what?"
13718,"Does this mean the double dose Covid-,19 vaccinations work for 6 months then you are unvaccinated again?..."
13719,Australia has been in lockdown for 6 weeks and their cases are still skyrocketing.

13722,I get my 2nd Pfizer in a couple days.
13723,The first one didn't do anything to me other then arm soreness for about a day.
13724,Hopefully the 2nd dose goes the same.
13725,Then you have your answer.
13726,You could kill your child.
13727,"You probably won't, but you could."
13728,Could you live with that?
13729,Live with knowing that your decision killed them?
13730,I know I couldn't.
13731,I'd end up taking my own life as well if that happened because the guilt would be too much to bear.
13732,"If a doctor isn't your speed, perhaps a therapist could help you understand why intentionally harming your child is even an option to you right now."
13733,"I say that with all of the care in the world for you, this is hard, but those are some scary thoughts that deserve to be talked out with a professional."
13734,my sympathy is gone too.
13735,don't let ppl who really need care suffer because of these selfish individuals.
13736,"God no, do not do this."
13737,Do not purposely expose your child to Covid.
13738,"Nah, I‚Äôll do the hard work to reclaim it."
13739,Thanks though.
13740,If nothing changes as far as masks and vaccination levels we'll definitely see when it gets cold.
13741,"They are going to learn from this or it's going to kill them, and some of us who are trying to save them."
13742,Should have offered a 25k *retention* bonus to existing staff.
13743,The would have done without a functioning healthcare system.
13744,I would assume the vast majority of those catching covid and dying from it in Florida or the types that don't believe covid is real never wore masks and were never intending on getting vaccinated.
13745,Until maybe it was too late.
13746,Same got my second dose on Tuesday and yesterday I had all the side effects.
13747,At least it shows my immune system got the memo!
13748,üòÅ
13749,Shit is there like an otc test for hookworm?
13750,"Yeah, that's how I remember as well."
13751,The lower dosage means you have less side effects and can also produce more (e.g.
13752,need less lipids which were scarce)/cheaper.
13753,"Of course the trials back then were not against Delta, not even against Alpha."
13754,Im replying in regards to what you said about inflammation.
13755,You can absolutely have inflammation without obvious symptoms.
13756,We have seen a spike in younger people in 30-40s who come in for a heart attack/stroke and were COVID+.
13757,No prior history of cardiovascular issues.
13758,They had been going about their normal lives mere hours or even minutes before coming in.
13759,"While correlation ‚â† causation, it‚Äôs hard to come up with other causes to explain a spike in such cases we‚Äôve seen during covid waves."
13760,"Since vaccines were rolled out to the general public, the amount of cases we‚Äôve seen dropped dramatically."
13761,Which would imply that the vaccine does help address this problem.
13762,You might have said that assuming the person in question is vaccinated but I just wanted to make that distinction.
13763,"The point is, every eligible person needs the shot."
13764,"If your immune system can quickly identify the intruder and eradicate it before it ever takes hold, the less likely any sort of adverse reaction will occur, symptomatic or not."

13768,"If you‚Äôre in a situation where you don‚Äôt need to remove the mask frequently, double stick mask/dress tape around the inside edges will insure a good seal."
13769,"Also, Powecom makes a kn95 with headbands rather than earloops (may be other brands doing the same), or you can use an ‚Äúearsaver‚Äù to mimic having a headband mask."
13770,Either option will seal better than earloops.
13771,"Go to the Bronx and tell a black family they can't sit at a restaurant, and try explaining to them that they aren't being discriminated."
13772,I wasn't aware antibodies were the only component of the immune system.
13773,"I thought we had things like macrophages, the compliment system, [memory B and T cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7), and a wide range of other protections, some last years, some last a lifetime."
13774,I wouldn't feel bad if I gave a neighbor/relative covid because the vaccine is available.
13775,If you don't have it then you are willingly taking the risk.
13776,Could be seasonal factors at play or it could be random like how Michigan got a huge spring wave but next door Wisconsin got nothing.
13777,Luddites?
13778,You misspelled idiots.
13779,Thanks!
13780,You are a hero.
13781,Sorry these morons are causing everyone such pain.
13782,In your fantasy world you think people for now on are going to wear masks 24 weeks out of the year?
13783,You can't possibly believe that.
13784,Canadian cocktails.
13785,Hold the ice.
13786,Yes because you achieved something that means every other person in the US can do it.
13787,Just like everyone can quit smoking and drinking and using drugs.
13788,They are all just lazy.
13789,Let them struggle on their own with no support and penalize them for not improving.
13790,Lol
13791,What?
13792,Florida has logged almost 200k cases over the past couple weeks.
13793,According to the article there are 13k people in the hospital.
13794,"How the fuck is that the ""VAST MAJORITY OF CASES""?"
13795,I agree it's bad but you're just spitting hyperbole and fear.
13796,I'm sure they know about quarantining livestock also.
13797,"Like Texas, South Dakota, etc.."
13798,They have all sorts of laws telling businesses what they can do if the lives at stake are valuable to them.
13799,I got my 2nd Moderna shot on April 1.
13800,"I work in a school in Texas so I sure hope I can get a booster some time in October, alongside the flu shot"
13801,"Not to disparage you, but I've also read that a strong reaction usually denotes a healthier immune system."
13802,My wife didn't have a reaction either and she's sick a lot
13803,Looks like it.
13804,Honest question: are employers (save for essential industry) bound to these restrictions?
13805,"title is misleading because most of those seriously ill vaccinated people are over 60

*Of the 40 patients in serious condition aged under 60, however, only nine were fully inoculated, one was partially vaccinated and 30 had not received any vaccine."
13806,*
13807,The Anti vaxxers are effectively choosing to get covid as a personal choice.
13808,"Insurance can legally charge more or deny coverage for risky voluntary behavior such as smoking, extreme sports etc."
13809,this is fair.
13810,Choosing to be an anti vaxxer isn‚Äôt a preexisting condition or a protected class
13811,That was prior to the delta variant though.
13812,"What's this, news that isn't about Pfizer?"
13813,I'm somebody now!
13814,Weird.
13815,"I get sick often, but neither Moderna shot did much to me except make me slightly tired on the second one."
13816,After my first shot I could barely move my arm where I got it for four days.
13817,I had to take multiple days off from work.
13818,The second shot only kicked my ass for five hours.
13819,"Thank you, it's greatly appreciated, people like you help us feel validated and heard :)"

13885,The consistent theme of certain groups forgoing any empathetic actions until it directly affects them holds up yet again.
13886,"Tired, false talking points that didn‚Äôt work during the election, and they don‚Äôt work now."
13887,Have you a link to an official report?
13888,That‚Äôs the exact opposite of all others I‚Äôve seen.
13889,Thank you for your thoughtful and spot-on comment   : ))
13890,And 200k was roughly where we were at the worst peak last winter.
13891,"Although the site seemed to have an outlier at 300k, but the peak was around 216 rolling average."
13892,That‚Äôs it?
13893,LOL
13894,"People aren't worried about intellectual honesty anymore, they only care about shitting all over people who disagree with them to inflate their own sense of self worth."
13895,"Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburg Medical Center just did a study on vaccine hesitancy and found that the most hesitant group currently are people with PhDs, but that doesn't stop everyone with equating hesitant people with knuckle dragging idiots because it makes people feel better about themselves."
13896,And this isn't just an issue around the vaccine discussion but pretty much every discussion we try to have about anything in this country and God DAMN is it exhausting.
13897,150 is actually pretty high.
13898,"Keep in mind that Israel is basing its Covid policies entirely off of hospitalizations now, so if they lockdown it‚Äôs the shape of things to come."

13904,Should be reported tomorrow.
13905,150/250 = 60%.

13916,There were 20 of us in my cohort ranging from 20-45.

13940,It's *real world proof* of how well the vaccines work!
13941,"Even President Biden just came out and said: *‚ÄúHere are the facts: if you are vaccinated you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19 ‚Äî And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms, and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild."

Yet most of Reddit is tripping over themselves to call for new lockdowns, shutting down schools, more mandates, on and on."

13946,Hey I don't know but this seems to be a Republican thing.
13947,But hey maybe they don't think they need mask as their heads are so far up their asses they couldn't possibly get Covid-19.
13948,Had 2 moderna shots completed in May.
13949,Tested positive few days ago‚Ä¶
13950,You‚Äôre being downvoted but you might be right.
13951,"Southwest MO (initial spike) peaked a week ago, STL area (a little behind them) is peaking now."
13952,Nobody is noticing this.
13953,The national average could easily follow within a week.
13954,(Tho we could also easily double from here by then)
13955,You can‚Äôt be anti-fat on reddit.
13956,Most redditors are fat apologists or just fat themselves.
13957,Before October is a pretty big window.

13959,"Thats the opposite of what I had seen, but even so 150 seriously ill is still not that high I."
13960,The scheme of things with their vaccination rates.
13961,I'm definitely gonna be keeping an eye on this wave though.
13962,Why are American Catholics so out of touch with the rest of the world
13963,That isn‚Äôt true until vaccines are approved for kids.
13964,Nooit can very well happen only vaccinated people get a weaker version of the virus and sonifnit mutates it isn't in full force and not a stronger version most likely.
13965,According to studies on other viruses.
13966,However there is binders still a possibility but it's just not based likely as unvaccinated people.
13967,Afcourse this is in the situation the vaccine is actually good.
13968,Sonar we seem to be protected but as we experience right now some countries already are opting for a third shot or a booster sotto sotto that means the vaccine could be better.
13969,However the reason we need a third vaccine is Forsythe delta variant and as far as I know that is mutated in unvaccinsted people.
13970,"Exactly they're all ""skeptical"" of the science until their ass is in a sling, and then it's ""y'all got any experimental drugs since nothing else is working?"""
13971,"It‚Äôs alarming, and my young (unvaccinated, until it‚Äôs available) kids are going to be in person school with precautions this fall."
13972,"The one thing keeping my mind from formulating the worst case scenarios is, we thought in person schools would be a huge problem last fall."
13973,"Luckily, schools didn‚Äôt seem like the super high risk environments we thought they could be, and weren‚Äôt a main source of spread."
13974,"I realize we didn‚Äôt have delta then, but we had lower immunity overall, and zero vaccines last fall."
13975,"I have a 7 year old daughter, and a 5 year old daughter."
13976,They keep asking us when they can do &lt;whatever they're into this week&gt; like gymnastics or dance.
13977,Our answer has been when you can get vaccinated.
13978,They are practically begging us to get the vaccine.
13979,My wife and I are fully vaccinated and still have been doing everything we can to keep them safe
13980,"It does not matter, even if most of the country got 90% of vaccination, there will be third world countries with low vaccination rate where a mutation will inevitably submerged where current vaccine would be ineffective against."
13981,The goal here is not getting the rest of 10 or 20% of people to vaccinate but to support countries that cannot afford vaccination to do so.
13982,This too shall pass.
13983,We'll look back at this when it's over with a new appreciation for the things we temporarily couldn't do.

14149,Imagine not being at the mercy of GOP politicians making bad medical decisions and putting everyone's lives in danger.
14150,"Yeah, I think this reality is starting to break through."
14151,"There's a lot of whistling in the dark, but what's happening seems to indicate that being vaccinated with the current vaccines is no guarantee of anything when it comes to the Delta variant (it does seem to substantially reduce the severity of symptoms, which is an excellent reason to get vaccinated, I hasten to add before people freak out) ."
14152,"Maybe better vaccines will come along, but maybe worse variants will come along, too."
14153,Is there a difference between the booster and the normal shot?

14156,So many similar convos with the parental units.
14157,Yeah I‚Äôm sure it increases antibodies for a few weeks.
14158,Those will go away.
14159,Fact is that the cell mediated response is not enough to deal with Covid in a way that protects our hospital systems
14160,It‚Äôs a combination of risks of flu complications not being as severe or prominent as covid complications.
14161,"Even with vaccinations covid is more dangerous and disruptive than the flu, thus the lack of need for a mandated flu shot."
14162,Also vaccine hesitancy.
14163,If we only get 50% uptake of the vaccine it needs to do more heavy lifting in preventing severe outcomes than a vaccine that has 90%+ uptake.
14164,At some point we have to get back to normal and can‚Äôt rely on masks and individual vaccinations to do everything.

14169,"She has had a very mild case, vaccines rock!"
14170,"lmao, I ran into a couple folks here the other day who were arguing that the surges were only occuring because blacks and Hispanics were undervaccinated."
14171,"I pointed out that the exact article they were using as ""proof"" showed similar vaccination and population percentages (it was like 12/13 for blacks and 17/18 for hispanic)."
14172,They refused to believe it.
14173,"And in Austin, the stages are based on hospitalizations and ICU bed availability."
14174,"About 17% of those hospitalized are fully vaccinated, they just released."
14175,So once this wave of delta is over will a different variant possibly start another wave of infections?
14176,Does Covid mutate faster than the flu?
14177,Not really sure how this virus stuff works.
14178,I‚Äôm guessing if everyone was vaccinated (by everyone I mean the world) we wouldn‚Äôt have this problem.
14179,How can we slow these mutations down happening in other countries that aren‚Äôt as fortunate as the ones that are able to get mass amounts of vaccine out quickly?
14180,Just looking for some discussion on the subject.
14181,Thanks.
14182,According to NYTimes Aug 3rd was 150k new cases.
14183,"Oh geez, very probably."
14184,So every kid that comes into sustained contact with an unmasked covid positive person in school has to quarantine.
14185,"If you've got one kid in a class of 30 who has covid and is unmasked, then the class has to quarantine, but if that kid was masked and all the other classmates and teachers were masked, just the single covid positive kid would have to quarantine."
14186,"It would be illegal to ask medical information in a hiring process here, so no hospital can be kept liable for this."
14187,"I can understand privacy laws, but there should be a way to do a anonymous health check, just like employers sometimes can ask for clean criminal records."
14188,"The study is fine, but it's preliminary data in cells and a retrospective examination of patients who did or didn't take CBD - not a controlled trial."
14189,Keep in mind that most drugs fail to make it through clinical trials.
14190,"There are hundreds of different drugs currently being tested at this level for covid currently, most won't pan out."
14191,But anything with CBD catches headlines.

14204,&gt;150 patients in hospital with Covid in a country the size of Israel would already be enough to trigger a universal masking order.

14206,"Sweden, for example, has 129 people in hospital with Covid at the moment, during the lowest transmission rates since last summer."
14207,And hospitals here all consider the current state as ‚Äùfunctioning as normal‚Äù.
14208,They prioritized the roll out by age so it makes sense there would be a gap.

14261,Interesting numbers from England.
14262,"&gt;On July 23 more than 90 per cent of people in England aged over 65 had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the official UK government website."
14263,"Yet the same date, 23 per cent of people aged 25-29 year-olds had received both doses of the vaccine, 31 per cent of 30-34 year olds and 44 per cent of 35-39 year olds."
14264,Only 18 per cent of people aged 18-24 years old had been fully vaccinated.
14265,Does anti vaxxer take on a different meaning there?
14266,Or has this been a deliberate policy of the NHS?
14267,I was so glad to see that almost everyone in publix had on a mask.
14268,I only saw 2 people who didn‚Äôt.
14269,"In pretty much every study, universal healthcare would cost people less than the private insurance system we currently have."
14270,The people against it will say they don't want to pay higher taxes but they would be less than current insurance premiums.
14271,It wouldn't be perfect but I can't imagine it would be worse than dealing with an insurance company that tries to deny as many claims as possible.
14272,"While lots of drugs show a dose-response curve, with how the mRNA vaccines work, we don‚Äôt know what effect the initial dose has on strength or duration of immunity."
14273,More initial mRNA doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that much more of an immune response.
14274,"As an example, we can look at the efficacy data: Pfizer and Moderna seem to be equally efficacious, despite the difference in their dosing."
14275,Employers can require a physical after an offer of employment has been extended.
14276,"They can't use it to decide whether or not to hire you, that's the difference."

14318,Just really sad about it
14319,"&gt; If the virus spreads among the vaccinated, there isn't much selective pressure for it to resist it."
14320,"Yes, there is."
14321,"It isn't the vaccine being resisted, it is the antibodies that the vaccine has raised in the vaccinated (by affinity maturation) that are being resisted, which because humans are genetically very similar, will tend to arrive at the same sets of antibodies."
14322,"If a variant lucks out with a mutation(s) which negates some antibodies, that *is* a positive selection in favor of an escape."
14323,"That said, a booster *of the offending variant* is the answer, because that prompts the immune system to fight it off, and if the previously raised antibodies don't cut it (not a good enough binding affinity), it will go back into affinity maturation to generate antibodies which *do* bind well enough to fight it off."

14389,Fauci and the government are walking a thin line between what they can actually do and the fallout that will come from it.
14390,"My facebook feed is full of people shrieking about how Fauci is a shill and plant and works for pharma all due to things he said before that were very reasonable especially in the face of what information we had, but weren't yet 100% proven with massive scale controlled studies."
14391,Shutdowns have major impacts and massive blowback.
14392,So not having one doesn't mean they don't think we should.
14393,Especially if they know they will be ineffective because people will flaunt them anyway.
14394,\&gt;Hmm..
14395,"I guess I'm not really the issue then, unless you know more than Fauci and the government..."
14396,"I don't know more than Fuaci, but I am not as hamstrung as he is with the spotlight full on his every exact word."
14397,The guy got beat down pretty hard and there's millions of folks with figurative crosshairs (and maybe literal ones) waiting for anything they can catch him on.
14398,Science now... well science is a different story.
14399,Science tells us that Delta Variant is infecting vaccinated people with high viral load and they are probably contagious.
14400,The higher the viral load and the more people infected the more chances of a really dangers mutation.
14401,"We are pretty lucky that Delta got more contagious but less lethal (although lethality isn't the only thing to worry about, I have a fried who just got done with a week of breakthrough COVID and lost her sense of smell and taste) but it could easily mutate to be more lethal."
14402,So what Fauci and the Government say to do?
14403,I think it's pretty obvious the treacherous grounds they have to navigate.
14404,"Science isn't telling us to do anything, that's not what science does."
14405,Science is giving us he information and the information points a pretty clear picture that there is at least very good reason (if not necessarily overwhelming reason) to practice an abundance of caution.
14406,The problem is that they really can only pull a shut down once the horse is out of the gate.
14407,Basically if and when COVID mutates to something even more dangerous and has a measurable impact then they can argue the shutdown.
14408,"But no matter how painfully obvious it is that we are taking a big risk of that happening, there's just no way our society is going to accept another shut down until that risk actually goes wrong."
14409,"And so until it gets Ebola levels of bad, we just have this kind of thing going on [https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/67596204\_10156587511398576\_5609327326954258432\_n.jpg?\_nc\_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-3&amp;\_nc\_sid=8bfeb9&amp;\_nc\_ohc=Iojrmx4OiwIAX\_4NbsZ&amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&amp;oh=59941d95282ec726ab0b67979efc6f34&amp;oe=61306CD2](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/67596204_10156587511398576_5609327326954258432_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=Iojrmx4OiwIAX_4NbsZ&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&amp;oh=59941d95282ec726ab0b67979efc6f34&amp;oe=61306CD2)

14414,Why should Israel expect a different outcome in the % hospitalized than the UK?
14415,"They have very similar vaccination rates, only Israel exclusively used a vaccine that is demonstrably more efficient vs Delta."
14416,"Also, their hospitalization rate is high and rising, but the number of people in the ICU isn‚Äôt rising nearly as fast."
14417,Could it be that they are simply hospitalizing more ‚Äùmild‚Äù severe cases than they did before?
14418,Kids are being hospitalized at increased numbers because it started at essentially zero.
14419,Deaths among kids haven‚Äôt increased at all.

14454,"""return to office"" means having everyone come back in."

14456,"**Article** 

SYDNEY ‚Äî Australia's second-most-populous city, Melbourne, entered its sixth coronavirus lockdown on Thursday after Victoria state officials detected ""multiple mystery cases"" of what they suspect to be the highly contagious delta variant."
14457,"The week-long lockdown comes just a day after the state reported its first 24 hours without a new infection in nearly a month, briefly raising hopes that its most recent battle with the delta variant was behind it."
14458,"Officials announced eight new infections Thursday, some of which had not been linked to previous cases."
14459,Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that the mystery cases were still under investigation but that the snap lockdown was the only way to prevent the outbreak from spiraling out of control.
14460,"‚ÄúBecause this thing moves so fast, it‚Äôs either lock it down ."
14461,.
14462,.
14463,"or it runs wild and it gets away from you and there is no pulling it back,‚Äù he said of the delta variant."
14464,"Australia‚Äôs closed international border, rigorous contact tracing and snap lockdowns once made it a covid success story, with about 35,000 cases in total and 932 deaths."
14465,But the country has struggled to suppress outbreaks of the delta variant.
14466,And a sluggish vaccination program has left its population of roughly 25 million vulnerable.
14467,"Andrews said he wanted to avoid a larger outbreak like the one in Sydney, where health officials reported a record 262 new cases and five deaths on Thursday."
14468,"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want that to happen here,‚Äù he said of Sydney‚Äôs outbreak, which began in June and has been averaging more than 200 new cases a day recently."
14469,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been through that already, and worse.‚Äù

Melbourne went through one of the world‚Äôs longest lockdowns last year."
14470,"Cases peaked at more than 700 a day, and the city of 5 million remained shuttered for almost four months."
14471,"Its most recent lockdown, sparked by infectious furniture movers from Sydney, lasted 12 days and ended only last week."
14472,Andrews said it was unclear if the new mystery cases were linked to that outbreak.
14473,The lockdown began statewide on Thursday evening.
14474,"Victorians are able to leave home only for food or essential supplies, care or caregiving, authorized work or education that cannot be done from home, exercise, or to get vaccinated."
14475,"Australia‚Äôs third-largest city, Brisbane, is also in lockdown after suffering its own cluster of delta cases."
14476,"The shutdowns threaten to send Australia into a second pandemic recession, with Sydney‚Äôs lockdown alone costing around $750 million per week."
14477,"But officials say they cannot lift restrictions until cases drop or inoculations increase without unleashing a wave of covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths."
14478,"The country has ramped up its vaccination program in recent weeks as supply issues have improved, but only about 20 percent of eligible adults have received two doses."
14479,Andrews said the country‚Äôs sluggish vaccination rate was partly to blame for the lockdown.

Andrews has criticized his counterpart in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, for waiting more than a week to put her state into lockdown in June."
14481,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison initially praised Berejiklian but has recently reversed course, arguing that snap lockdowns are the only way to deal with delta outbreaks."
14482,"Last week, the prime minister unveiled a road map out of the pandemic in which lockdowns will become much less frequent once the nation fully vaccinates 70 percent of people over 16, a figure he said Australia can reach by year‚Äôs end."
14483,"Andrews, who gained fame for his marathon daily news conferences during last year‚Äôs lockdown, struck a note of weary resolve when announcing its unwelcome sequel on Thursday."
14484,"‚ÄúThey are incredibly painful, incredibly difficult,‚Äù he said of lockdowns."
14485,"‚ÄúThe alternative is not being locked down for seven days, it‚Äôs being locked down for seven weeks or more, locked down until we get to 80 percent vaccination."
14486,And that may not happen until almost Christmastime.‚Äù

14488,How many levels of stupid is this going to evolve to ?
14489,"Are first graders going to need to declare their political party , so they can decide on wearing a mask or not."
14490,Just wear the fucking mask
14491,I don't feel one bit sorry for them.
14492,I had a medical type tell me that they wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate civilians for smallpox now; they have effective treatments for it.
14493,"Personally, I‚Äôd rather the vaccine; I‚Äôm old enough to have had it, but I have no idea of how effective it is now."
14494,I‚Äôd probably need a booster.
14495,Lamda was identified in December 2020.
14496,Pfizer and Moderna are effective against it.
14497,Chinese vaccines less so.
14498,Research suggests it is not as dangerous as Delta.

14500,I'm waiting for holographic Moderna
14501,"&gt; Now that we know Delta can spread among vaccinated people

All variants can spread to vaccinated people bub."
14502,The small N studies were proven to be too selective - and all show that the vaccine is real and working just as effectively as before.
14503,This doesn't change that unvaccinated people (especially children) - are safe.
14504,Moderna literally showed 93% efficacy after 6m today.
14505,Please.
14506,UBI and/or stimulus checks is the solution.
14507,But god forbid we help support the working class in any way.
14508,Financial support is strictly for billionaires only.
14509,Some do yes.
14510,I had titers done for Hep A and B when I got a job at a hospital and even though I had both shots when I was young (and had records) they didn‚Äôt pick up Hep B during the test.
14511,I had to get the shot again.
14512,"Yes, but the more people that get vaccinated, the lower the probability of a variant."
14513,[deleted]
14514,I had a headache iirc.
14515,That's it!
14516,I have an easy solution.
14517,No more COVID patients can enter the hospital that there are unvaccinated people in that state.
14518,40% covidiots?
14519,They get access to 40% of the hospital and not a single extra bed.
14520,They don‚Äôt like this?
14521,They go get a vaccine.
14522,This is fair.
14523,"No reason for 40% of people to occupy 100% of the hospital just because they are idiots and shouldn‚Äôt face consequences for their actions 

Being an adult is hard, yeah‚Ä¶"
14524,Put it inside of me now
14525,"Hi this may be silly, but I'm actually scared of the medical effects of getting vaccinated, I know I'm silly I just am."
14526,"I stay inside during covid to lower my risk of infection and wear mask when necessary but a full submission like this would help me, and many others feel safer."
14527,"I am preparing to book an appointment for moderna now, please don't hate me but some people out there are just genuinely nervous about it and aren't all about the politicization of it"
14528,"&gt;People vaccinated before late February

In case anyone is wondering how they are defining early vs late vaccinees."
14529,"Another example of ""the exception that proves the rule."""
14530,Like saying Bill Gates didn't get a degree and he's super wealthy!
14531,"Yeah, sure, but he had a plan."
14532,"Your plan to drop out of art school and bum around South America isn't going to lead to wealth, son."
14533,If a business is source of a disease spread then it is not really their call but call of the health department.
14534,This is why restaurants (which are private businesses) still have to adhere to regulations and regular inspections.
14535,it really depends on the person.
14536,How could India have prevented it?
14537,Not this old white lady.
14538,I fully get my mortality.
14539,I got pfizer and the second shot put me on my ass for a day.
14540,I thought the long Covid symptoms sounded similar to EBV.
14541,I had mono over 20 years ago and still deal with fatigue and brain fog.

14548,I did my job and got vaccinated

14550,It‚Äôs against all infection
14551,Colleges and universities are a disaster waiting to happen.
14552,People in the 18-24 range are among the least likely to be vaccinated and also huge vectors for spread given they are very social and mobile: https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/
14553,Delta variant currently having a symptomatic effect on  the vaccinated.
14554,Anyways enjoy your bi annually boosters buddy!
14555,"I know this person answered, but since I have lots of relatives in Texas, I can guarantee they personally know tons of people who either deny covid is a big deal and/or who refuse to get vaccinated."
14556,I spent 10 days in the hospital with covid last November.
14557,"At my worst, I was using 55 liters of oxygen."
14558,"My high glow cannula went up to 65 liters, after that I was headed to a ventilator."
14559,"Thankfully, the plasma transfusion, remdesivir, steroids, and blood thinners all worked to pull me back."
14560,I was literally in the hospital and one of my uncles on Texas was trying to question if it was really covid and saying how it isn't that bad.
14561,The delusion runs strong and deep in some texans.
14562,That uncle and his whole family still won't vaccinate.
14563,It hasn't harmed them personally so they don't think they need it.
14564,They kept bringing it up to me when they visited this summer (I knew how they felt and how intransigent they were so I wasn't going to bring it up) and got very upset when I refused to stop pointing out to them how they aren't just making a choice for themselves but also for others and that choice could kill someone else.
14565,Whatever.
14566,That is kind of where I was going with this.
14567,"There are plenty of ""booster"" shots available if you think it's prudent to get one."
14568,"It's easy to see why boosters might not be good for ""public health"" at large but still be beneficial to an individual."
14569,Finally
14570,Nice.
14571,Maybe Florida can boost the pediatric caseload in a few weeks when it shoves kids into classroom sans masks per state law.
14572,Unbelievable.
14573,I hope everyone knows there are people in Florida who are as shocked and horrified as people who live in smarter and kinder places.

14579,My coworker is similar and he‚Äôs bound to catch covid and be in bed for at least a few days.
14580,I‚Äôm tempted to say I won‚Äôt cover his workload in that case.
14581,I didn‚Äôt know laziness was as contagious as covid 19.
14582,"Thanks for the education, I guess."
14583,/s
14584,Not sure how much this helps but in this study I found which uses fitbit / apple tracking data it shows previously infected people who then get vaccinated after recovering show a noticeably stronger response to the 1st dose while the rest of the group had much smaller variance in tracking data with the 1st dose (resting heart rate / steps taken) https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256482v1.full
14585,I can't wait for the Zulu-Zulu variant.
14586,Could be a good time to buy a used Harley in a month or two.
14587,Everything from now on will be a reason to question the FDA.
14588,wasnt the delta variant around before 1st vaccine wave?
14589,Were there delta variant cases in india last year?
14590,"For these people the viral loads are restricted to the nasal and throat areas, but not lungs."
14591,According to some dude on NPR
14592,I read the article.
14593,"I also looked into the risk of GBS, which is at least as great from the virus itself as it is from Pfizer vaccine."
14594,There are also the mRNA vaccines that don't have the same correlations.
14595,In order to *not* dunk on this argument you have to ignore the fact that he's trying to protect himself from GBS by putting himself at considerably greater risk of it.
14596,"The absolute fact is that, like nearly all vaccine hesitancy, it's not a well-informed or rational stance."
14597,White house documents show 40 percent infection rate with 99 percent or above masking.
14598,I assume we are looking at 80 to 90 percent infection rate otherwise.
14599,[removed]
14600,If only there was some tool we had at our disposal that could prevent 98% of this.
14601,What in the North Korean propaganda is this
14602,[deleted]
14603,Surges are temporary and I care about immunocompromised and unvaccinated children.
14604,I can wait a few weeks before going to bars.
14605,Plenty of beer at home.
14606,More surprising is that he isn‚Äôt uneducated.
14607,I literally saw his profile on fb yesterday and on the 28 of July he shared a video from tiktok that said that the chance of getting COVID and dying is super slime and that there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.
14608,"He is in Miami, in the ICU, has refused intubation and has to be lying face down 16hours a day."
14609,"On the other side we are Mexican, I‚Äôm a 30f still waiting for my second jab, but he choose not to get it."
14610,"üôÑ white privilege man, they have gotten away with so much that they even think they can outlive science."
14611,"This has to do with humoral immunity, which also explains why the second shot is worse for some people."
14612,"Basically, the memory cells of your immune response are taking a small part of the antigen that they were presented with, and holding on to them for some time."
14613,"This way, if the body is presented with the antigen again, they can fight back much quicker, and more aggressively."
14614,"So if you were recently exposed to covid, then when you get the first vaccine your immune system will have a rapid and aggressive response to disable the foreign antigens they are presented with."
14615,"However, if your first exposure is the first vaccine, then there won‚Äôt be a build up of memory cells in the immune system, and you will see this aggressive immune response on the next exposure (second dose)"
14616,Raise your hand if you feel no sympathy for this lady?
14617,üñê
14618,Yeah and people who live in polluted areas of cities and people who don't take vitamins every day.
14619,Also anyone who has come into contact with yards treated with Roundup and people who live in sunny climates.
14620,Also any mass shooting victims obviously brought it on themselves because they lived somewhere lunatics had easy access to guns lol /s
14621,I'm assuming there was a good amount of people who were not completely anti-vaxx but had their fair share of hesitancy and gave themselves every excuse not to get it.
14622,These people probably thought that if enough other people got it they could get by without getting it and thus they did not get it.
14623,"Chances are they saw people getting vaxx'd, the infection rates going down in the summer, and got complacent thinking that they did not need to get it as long as enough other people got it."
14624,Now with how rapidly Delta is spreading and with breakthrough cases it probably tipped the scale to those people.
14625,Obviously breakthrough infections are still very rare in the grand scheme of things and especially serious breakthrough infections  but I think these people realized they can't rely on others getting vaxx'd to keep them safe.
14626,They need to do their part to protect themselves and thats why I think the vaxx rates are rising.
14627,Especially if unvaccinated kids aren't wearing masks.
14628,"They need to offer incentive to ""travelers"" they can definitely get some extra staff if the bonus was right"
14629,"That's strange, according de santis and his Joseph Goebbels covid mathematics, everything should be just dandy."
14630,"You may call it shortages, but to him, it sounds like hospital business is booming."
14631,They are adults.
14632,"If you drive 100mph on the highway, you will face consequences."
14633,You will pay a fine and can even end up in jail.
14634,Because you are endangering others!
14635,Guess what.
14636,It‚Äôs exactly what unvaccinated people are doing.
14637,It should be the same here.
14638,Don‚Äôt want the vaccine?
14639,"Well, okay, but if you do get sick, you‚Äôre on your own."
14640,"And before fall into the fallacy of comparing with people who smoke and get lung cancer:
- stopping is hard."
14641,"Getting the vaccine is trivial 
- You cannot prove a link between someone‚Äôs cancer and smoking because non smokers get cancer too."
14642,"Whereas there is a 1:1 direct link between not getting the vaccine and getting covid

Another fallacy is the ‚ÄútHiS iS a SLiPPerY sLoPe‚Äù."
14643,Well everything is a slippery slope including drinking a glass of water.
14644,"If you drink too much you die, yet it is essential to do it a bit."
14645,Same here.
14646,You should check out the CDC‚Äôs stats on who is not getting vaccinated.
14647,makes me glad i have a well.
14648,and neighbors far away.
14649,well 300 feet.
14650,still.
14651,ick.
14652,We don't need to catch all the cases.
14653,"I thought the point was to make it just another cold, not completely eradicate."
14654,"If someone has COVID and is asymptomatic with a low viral load and isn't contagious, for the purposes of this discussion, who cares?"
14655,"They aren't ""sick,""  and more importantly, they aren't spreading the virus."
14656,"Fair, but that's not what I meant, private business, private decision?"
14657,Up to people deciding on whether or not they want to do business with companies that don't enforce vaccine passports.
14658,yeah me too but based on the time it might be at least 6 months
14659,I understand the decision.
14660,"From the leaders' point of view, they have a duty to their citizens."
14661,Big brain.
14662,Still a hundred million times than getting covid.
14663,[removed]
14664,Was it 93% effective against infection or severity?
14665,I‚Äôd be shocked if it was against infection.
14666,"I finished my 2nd dose january 21st of moderna, tested positive with covid yesterday with 102 fever"
14667,"With those numbers, and a .05% death rate?"
14668,"That almost an additional 2 , 0 0 0, 0 0 0 deaths..thats 2 million people who didn't need to die."
14669,"FairPlay

14670,I think I will wait and see what is needed and asked for.
14671,Dosages and vaccines might change.
14672,I prefer not to become a glowworm pin cushion.
14673,Missississippi would like to have a word with you.
14674,Mexico?
14675,Don't you mean southern Alabama?
14676,That's the real problem!
14677,This title is misleading.
14678,Nobody is being charged more for insurance by being unvaccinated and as far as I know it would be illegal to do so.
14679,"People are paying more for their health care because even with insurance, care isn‚Äôt free, and being unvaccinated makes you more likely to need health care."
14680,He asked to get the vaccine after he was already sick enough to be hospitalized?
14681,Maybe some  people are just ignorant that vaccines don‚Äôt work like a medication.
14682,The vaccine isn‚Äôt like  an antibiotic.
14683,I don‚Äôt understand.
14684,Unless the government plans on implementing some form of universal basic income I don't see how schools don't open.
14685,Maybe.
14686,Possibly.
14687,Could be.
14688,What will it change for you given that COVID is likely endemic for decades now?
14689,Influenza can do both.
14690,"[https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/12/3060](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/12/3060)

Did the specter of that change your behavior?"
14691,No?
14692,Then why should COVID?
14693,"Probably, you know, directly the result of the slow passage of time?"
14694,How can you do research on long-term effects in a short-term timeframe lol
14695,Besides the unvaccinated they opened states and removed mask mandates too soon when only 20% of the states were vaccinated.
14696,I read before the vaccine was available states were told to WAIT until states had 60%-70% vaccinated before reopening and removing mask mandates.
14697,"Either children will be fully vaccinated, or in person school is going to be ugly fast"
14698,"Everyone has to make their own decision, and I understand why some only listen to the CDC, but does it bother you that the CDC stopped collecting breakthrough data on people who contract covid but aren‚Äôt hospitalized?"
14699,"Personally, I‚Äôm looking to other countries and (legitimate) organizations for that data so I can make a completely informed decision about a booster."
14700,"I don‚Äôt trust the CDC as much as I used to, so they don‚Äôt get to be the sole source anymore, for me."

14708,"All of us will -- but for those of us who are vaccinated, we're going to encounter it as a vaccinated person and most likely will not get infected."""
14709,Get your shots people
14710,"That‚Äôs 1 per 100,000 unvaccinated people."
14711,"But there‚Äôs only been 200 confirmed infections per 100,000 unvaccinated people."
14712,"So, 1 in 200 die."
14713,"But considering some will contract the illness and have minor enough symptoms to not be confirmed, the number is likely less than 1 in 200."
14714,But it‚Äôs also true those 200 could still be in the early stages of the infection.
14715,"So if you let them go a little longer, you could get another death or two."
14716,So far what we‚Äôre seeing is an increase in hospitalizations among the younger ages.
14717,That makes sense because the old are largely vaccinated.
14718,This one seems to be a bit more transmissible and virulent among kids.
14719,But still nothing like what happened to old people last year.
14720,People outside the US also have access to the Internet.
14721,"Oh really, yes really."
14722,I‚Äôve had to go through this so many times with people similar to you acting like what you‚Äôre saying is concrete and twisting my words around.
14723,It‚Äôs not about whether the virus does anything to stop the spread it‚Äôs about if it‚Äôs substantial enough to make a difference.
14724,Literally the last article you just sent me talks about it being discouraging lol you really got some good stuff there.
14725,"We don‚Äôt know how easily people are still passing on the virus with a vaccine, on top of that they‚Äôre already telling people they should get a third vaccine."
14726,But you‚Äôre so smart and you know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about right?
14727,"I bet you haven‚Äôt once been willing to admit what you don‚Äôt know throughout this whole pandemic once you got the expert knowledge

No shit more cases are popping up with the unvaccinated."
14728,The vaccine has shown to help people not get as sick this is proven true.
14729,It is not however shown to help with herd immunity or what the numbers of actually stopping the spread are if any at all.
14730,"Let me ask you this, if you got the vaccine and picked up the virus and didn‚Äôt notice that you had the virus or didn‚Äôt feel ill or had a very slight cold then why would you go in and get tested?"
14731,Let‚Äôs pretend you‚Äôre one of those people who are a fanatic and you decide to go and get tested.
14732,Do you know how many people are not going to get tested they already have the vaccine?
14733,The reason why so many positive tests are popping up in Southern states versus places like Vermont it‚Äôs because more people are getting sick because they don‚Äôt have the vaccine.
14734,"This has nothing to do with whether  The spread of the virus is being stopped or not, and on top of that the new Delta variant makes things even more complicated."
14735,But you know everything you‚Äôre talking about right?
14736,We will have to wait a little longer for the tides to turn on all these people who are so determined that the vaccine should be handed out to every man woman and child above the age of three
14737,Can confirm.
14738,"My company's CEO, didn't build the company mind you, decides to sell to competitor."
14739,Then retires.
14740,"He could retire, then we get a new CEO and move on."
14741,"Nope, he takes the quick windfall while  a large number  of our company will probably be let go due to redundant systems."
14742,So what even is a vaccine passport?
14743,"My hope is this is implemented in a fair manner and not something like something something iPhone app , Andorid verison expect Q3 2031."
14744,"I have nothing against getting a vaccine, I am not opposed to requiring the vaccine, but how are we going to go about proving it?"
14745,"Schools, jobs, military have a process for submitting medical documentation, but this is something different."
14746,"Zero changes, zero side effects."
14747,I had Pfizer back in the Spring.
14748,"While this is true, I think the explanation for it infecting younger people at a higher rate (keyword there) is that the rate of young people vaccinated vs. older people vaccinated is much lower."
14749,"If the numerator is people infected, the denominator is going to be people who can be infected, and that denominator will be made up disproportionately younger people."
14750,I know you didn't ask but it's a good thing for people to consider.

14758,[removed]
14759,I guess Delta missed that memo since it does not care if you are vaccinated at all.
14760,I‚Äôve had covid and my first shot hit me hard.

14769,March.
14770,5 months.
14771,"&gt;they're finding similar viral loads in asymptomatic people

I've heard they're finding similar viral loads in the nasopharynx of vaccinated and unvaccinated people (which is not unusual with mucosal viruses), but I hadnt heard that about symptomatic vs asymptomatic."
14772,More like superstitious
14773,Don't sneak a booster.
14774,They're planning out how exactly to roll out a booster shot and at what time.
14775,It's most likely going to be an updated version that will better protect against variants.
14776,The media has done a major disservice to people's thinking on this stuff.
14777,It's wild.
14778,The data on vaccinated folks even with Delta rampant is SUPER reassuring unless you're looking for reasons to worry.
14779,"I wouldn't get a third dose yet.....similar to the flu each year, I expect Moderna to provide a booster shot that's calibrated to the delta to attack the worst strain."

14783,"Within the scope of the city of LA, which is the level this is being considered at currently, there‚Äôs likely little issue with enforcement."
14784,LA county already has QR codes set up.
14785,"If a business or patron refuses to follow the rules, then LAPD would be called upon to enforce the rules, and they probably would."
14786,"What I‚Äôm saying is this should be enacted at the county level, and should probably also be enacted at the county level in OC, as it‚Äôs all basically one big ass metropolis anyways."
14787,The problem with enacting it at the county level comes down to enforcement.
14788,"When a business or patron inevitably tries to flaunt the rules, enforcement would be left up to LASD for anyplace outside of LA city and any city that doesn‚Äôt have its own PD."
14789,"LASD covers a significant portion of the county and the sheriff already refuses to enforce the mask mandate currently in place, he‚Äôd likely also refuse to enforce a vaccination mandate."
14790,"In short, while having the city of LA enact this would be nice, that leaves a very large part of the SoCal population out of the mandate."
14791,"They need to be doing this at the county level, but enforcement would likely be a problem."

14841,"&gt;With Covid suppression measures like mask wearing, school closures, and travel restrictions driving flu transmission rates to historically low levels around the world, it appears that one of the H3N2 clades may have disappeared ‚Äî gone extinct."
14842,"The same phenomenon may also have occurred with one of the two lineages of influenza B viruses, known as B/Yamagata."

14901,"What I'm concerned about is the tendency among uneducated people in my country (USA) to believe that because the vaccine is not 100% effective, then it is *harmful* and must be opposed."

14916,It's the very last thing that can happen in the disease other than recovery.
14917,"Also, even when hospitalized vaccinated people have a higher chance of recovery than the unvaccinated."

14950,What evidence exists for this?
14951,I was told not to get a booster yet.
14952,"Yeah but that‚Äôs not the general sentiment- *I* didn‚Äôt leave that part out, it got lost in the messaging somehow."
14953,"The vacccines rolled out and large public gatherings were back on the agenda, the CDC said no masks (‚Äúfor the vaccinated‚Äù, but let‚Äôs be honest- no one was ever going to check and if the CDC didn‚Äôt know that then they‚Äôre not even remotely qualified for the job), and the general messaging was ‚Äúcovid is over once you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù."
14954,"Now that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre trying to bring it back‚Äù (it never left), people are rightfully disregarding a lot of the news in favor of the delusion that we‚Äôre back to normal and que ser√° ser√° with the unvaxed."

14956,I have a hunch that it's related to the synergistic effects that CBD and melatonin have on each other.
14957,"Melatonin is known to have an anticancer effect on ovarian cancer and given that melatonin is associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 infection, it's possible that they are correlated to some degree."
14958,I want everyone to get vaccinated too.
14959,"But if statistics like that make the vaccinated mistakenly think they're practically invincible, then a lot vaccinated people might end up very sick."
14960,"Sorry for not thinking that trying to hold people accountable for spreading misleading statistics counts as ""shitting on"" people that are trying to promote vaccines."

14977,[removed]
14978,[removed]
14979,It depends on the virus/pathogen.
14980,"There was a period after vaccine rollout where things seemed like they were calming down, so maybe that made people feel less urgent."
14981,Along with 20-40 year olds seeing news that the virus isn't very deadly in their age category.
14982,"I think also that all the stories of people feeling sick and feverish after the vaccine also can be a detergent, because instead of planning to spend 30 minutes of your day getting a vaccine people feel like they have to plan to potentially take off work and childcare duties for a day or two after getting it in case they become sick."
14983,"For a family struggling to pay rent, the potential of not being able to work because of the vaccine side effects can make them feel like they don't have the time in the week with their work schedule."
14984,I have read that full vaccination is (depending on the vaccine) between about 60% and 84% effective in reducing symptomatic infection with Delta.
14985,"But are there any good models or studies on how that plays out in real populations over time in reducing the spread, with various percentages of fully vaccinated people?"
14986,Or are there just too many variables to be able to generalize at all?
14987,There seem to be quite contradictory messages floating around about this right now.
14988,[removed]
14989,"I mean - they literally said ""If 6 feet works, why do you need a mask"" as if they didn't just understand multiple ways of reducing risk."
14990,I believe you and I think that is the main reason for people not to believe or to believe in certain aspects of this virus.
14991,I know one person that is at home for over 6 months now and stil can't walk stairs.
14992,He doesn't had any underlying disease.
14993,I also know a few people that died but mostly over 50.
14994,One person though was my neighbour and the hospital said to her sister she had severe astma as underlying disease and that was the reason.
14995,Her sister claims that she didn't had astma at all.
14996,So I found that very sketchy.
14997,But I admit I already don't trust it that every single young person suddenly already was sick if they happen to die so I am based on that.
14998,But I also know people who got covid and didn't notice anything.
14999,My wife was one of them.
15000,Also a strange situation because she works at home and we order groceries.
15001,My daughter went to school and got sick and I went to work.
15002,So we had my daughter tested and it was negative.
15003,My wife did the same and was positive so I tested too and negative.
15004,My wife was the only one that was positive while she didn't even said hello to a neighbour in the passed two weeks.
15005,We asked for a second opinion but they refused.
15006,After 5 days we all needed to be tested again and still everybody was negative.
15007,Weirdly enough my wife didn't need to test again even when we insist they refused.
15008,So now we doubt she actually has it.
15009,The problem  now is that she doesn't get a second vaccine because she was tested positive  once.
15010,She called because according government you can get a second one anyway if you want but they just won't seem to do it and finally she gave up.
15011,But now with countries starting with a third vaccination we still want that second shot for her.
15012,"And yes in my case it's the same as you, anecdotal."
15013,"Vaccine seller: you need vaccines

15027,Thank you J&amp;J for being up to the task in my wife‚Äôs case ( still knocking on wood there because we are still not past the all clear point with my daughter ).
15028,All that said in my daughters case Round Two seems far milder so far.
15029,We are hoping that is cutting down on her infectiousness but we aren‚Äôt relying on it.
15030,She‚Äôs banished to her room for the most part but we have let her outside a few times.

15045,Oh well.
15046,There is no need for boosters yet.
15047,At this point they're basically using children as a giant petri dish to cultivate the virus.
15048,&gt;We already owned a pulse ox so we've been keeping tabs and we're stayed above 97.
15049,"Yeah I believe ""severe"" symptoms is when your oxygen is getting abnormally low, which you are NOT having since you are at 97+."
15050,So the vaccine is working!!

15052,"We've had two shots, yes."
15053,But what about a booster shot?
15054,The dolls still need to be expressive to be appealing to children.
15055,"And since the faces are so small, and they need to be designed for mass production, it's hard to have a lot of subtle details while still keeping them appealing."
15056,"There is variation, but you have to be examining the dolls up close to really tell."
15057,This is never going to end.
15058,"We have articles coming out saying the kids are catching COVID and being hospitalized, then we have these idiots protesting mask mandates."
15059,"They can‚Äôt be parents, they must be paid actors."

15064,I was considering driving 8+ hours round trip to Bakersfield to get it 2 weeks earlier than my age group opened up nearby.

15082,This only works so far.
15083,I live in NY mandates we're decently serious here nothing to crazy but school kids wore masks last year.
15084,I was doing a job in a nicer neighborhood when the homeowners kids came home all 3 in masks.
15085,They get off the bus take their masks off and immediately a group of 20 unmasked kids gather in their front lawn slowly filing into the house to go play in the basement.

15106,"Not even just **some** protection, but a lot of protection."
15107,People apparently have such crazy standards for vaccines to consider around 75% effective at preventing infection and 85-90% effective at preventing symptomatic infection.

15127,Good.
15128,Got to offer those people a real way to actually protect themselves when a huge amount of the population around them refuses both vaccines and masking.

15130,"My girlfriend got COVID like 5 weeks ago and she hasn't recovered her smell and taste, I'm honestly very worried that she won't recover it; I know for some people it takes longer to come back, and she actually has taste than she had a couple of weeks ago, but I'm wondering, is there any evidence of long-term damage to smell and taste?"

15169,It seems like ‚Äútime since getting a vaccine‚Äù is more important than the exact genetic sequence for Delta.
15170,"Delta is scary because it replicates much faster than the original version, not because it evades vaccines."
15171,So strength of antibody protection seems to be the most important variable.
15172,If more cities follow NYC's vaccination policy maybe this will get slowed down.
15173,I am lol.
15174,"I about passed out last night trying to walk to the bathroom, and I get very winded but today I feel a bit better."

15706,Heck.. for the last 7 decades we had laws banning marijuana with commercials that showed smoking it made you murder people and then jump out windows and kill yourself.

15733,"There's no support for changing it from the King Ludd party, so this may be the best way to get the vaccination rate up in health care workers."
15734,"Not reading this whole idiotic screed, but the fact that youre still incorrectly calling this a ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù even when that term has no relevance here shows how completely out of your element you are here lol."
15735,"Yes, but remember even though they are high risk relative to younger kids, their overall risk is VERY low and much much lower than adults."
15736,"I agree I just don't get the anti vaccine sentiment, but on the bright side in the US 90% of people over 65 and 70% of people over 18 have at least one dose."
15737,That's pretty good and will mitigate the majority of deaths.
15738,"The central government will fire the lower level officials in charge of municipalities if they mess up the containment within their jurisdiction, so that's a pretty strong incentive to act as swiftly and scientifically as possible (meaning mass testing, tracking, stopping travel, quarantines, etc.)."

Thank you for the study."

15818,"Importantly, though, *the conclusion of this study itself is that bat coronaviruses are indeed spreading in this area, and more research is warranted*."
15819,"Antibodies persist for only several years, but memory B cells persist perhaps for a lifetime."
15820,"It's not only possible, but expected that decade-old infections would not test positive in an antibody test, but would still confer some immunity."
15821,"Already, substantial numbers of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 no longer test positive in antibody tests."
15822,"Beyond that, acquired immunity is not the only plausible theory."

15827,Brutal.
15828,Absolutely brutal.
15829,I'd rather be dead than go through that again.
15830,This in my books is a failed lockdown.
15831,Because the whole nation had to do a massive lockdown for 4 months and still have a lot of cases.
15832,The equivalent of the situation in China is if west midlands had to to a severe lockdown for 3 weeks to 1 month while the rest of the country wouldn't have any restriction.
15833,&gt; This state is so fucked up that numbers don‚Äôt really matter.
15834,"With respect, yes they do."
15835,"Unsubstantiated anecdotes and sidetracks about ""poop masks"" are not a solid response to the question."
15836,Disinformation and lies have been a major worldwide impediment to this pandemic most often by those downplaying the severity but fighting fire with fire just ensures everyone gets burned.
15837,[removed]
15838,Many many medical professionals are at their breaking point.
15839,They have the right to not destroy themselves over COVID and to put their own health first.

15841,It‚Äôs a mental health disaster for a group of workers that are already teetering on the edge of madness.
15842,Crazy how diffrent it is state to state.

15938,"Everybody who got vaccinated in Quebec received a digitally-signed QR code that contains their name, date of birth and proof-of-vaccination info (date/location/manufacturer/lot #)."
15939,"[[Example QR code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obrassard/shc-extractor/main/sample/sample-qr-code.png)]

Businesses will be able to download a government app to scan and validate the QR codes of customers."
15940,"In the meantime, somebody has already made an unofficial web app that can validate the codes:

15941,Are you in the hospital?
15942,"&gt;Breakthrough cases are on the rise due to Delta

The data on this is currently not convincing, at all."
15943,"Yes, Delta is outcompeting all other variants / wild type, AND breakthrough infections ARE increasingly occurring, however:  
1) Overall # of cases increasing."
15944,"More cases, more vaccinated individuals, and   
 vaccine efficacy being NOT 100% means increases in breakthrough infections is   
expected, even if there were no Delta."
15945,2) Breakthrough infections don't mean the vaccines aren't working.
15946,"Antibody   
 levels naturally wane with time- meaning, as time goes on, you get infected, you just don't get moderate / severe disease."
15947,"The efficacy against Alpha, for example, was tested when everyone's vaccines were much more 'fresh', so on paper, yeah it's going to look like the vaccines don't work 'as well', but the fact is **nobody** has actually done the experiments that would \*prove\* Delta is more likely to breakthrough, or spread from vaccinated individuals as much as unvaccinated."
15948,The Massachusetts Study (which is where this claim comes from) has serious flaws.
15949,"Just for context there were just over 21,000 confirmed cases in children under 19yo there last week."
15950,It's the Electronic Arts of vaccines.
15951,Florida is a shit show because of your governor's choices - nothing to do with the CDC.
15952,Desantis removed the mask requirements in Florida surrounding that time.
15953,"Masking requires a lot of localized information - vaccination rate, travel likelihood, population density."
15954,Florida is failing at all of those.
15955,"""I have this feeling ... if I was vaccinated, I wouldn't be hospitalized,"" Matzen said."
15956,Ya think?
15957,So many people concerned that the vaccine us experimental and rushed and whatever.
15958,At this point someone needs to come out and be like DUDES WEVE BEEN RESEARCHING THESE CORONA VIRUSES FOR DECADES!
15959,The technology the vaccine is based on isn't brand new.
15960,Although if that is established the anti-vaxxers will just find something else to complain about
15961,"Highly recommend reading this twitter thread from Chise, a vaccine researcher, on this release: https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1423306819070480388?s=21"
15962,"I agree, they won't."
15963,"But even that isn't ""don't get it"", it's just a ""talk to your doctor first"" or ""you have to wait 30 minute after instead of 15""."
15964,Back as in it is occurring again.
15965,It isn't a year round event.
15966,"They are testing multiple options:  another dose of the OG vaccine, a dose of an updated vaccine that was designed earlier for the Beta (‚ÄúSouth African‚Äù) variant, and another updated vaccine that is more recent."
15967,"They are also testing multiple doses - the original dose was 100ug, so they are testing that as well as a reduced 50ug dose."
15968,"(For reference, Pfizer is 30ug.)"
15969,"So far, the results have been roughly equivalent, so Moderna‚Äôs current thinking appears to be to offer a 50ug fall boosters of their original, unmodified vaccine, since that would be the simplest to get approval for."

15984,I hope they are 'relaxing' the rules(if any) during pandemics on using animals for treatments/testing/etc.
15985,Do monkeys get covid and have the same issues that humans currently do?
15986,"True, but from what I‚Äôve heard, a strain specific vaccine is only going into trials later this month."
15987,It may be next year before a Delta specific booster is available.
15988,"Me either, but we appear to be the minority."

16005,"I'm not sure why you're bringing them up here, since my point was that the so-called ""natural immunity"" (which is a popular talking point with the Antiva crowd) doesn't seem to be helping Florida very much."

16013,It's not as simple as throwing money at it like we have been already for a year.
16014,I agree.
16015,We need more stimulus checks.
16016,Tax those damn billionaires and help the world get healthy.
16017,I was super worried since Moderna was the majority shot administered in my area and it seemed like almost everyone I know was just knocked down hard for 2 days or so from shot #2.
16018,I got my second shot and it was like nothing happened.
16019,I didn't even really get a sore arm.
16020,If I didn't watch the lady stick it in me I'd almost have thought I didn't even get it.

16027,"So, to use loose numbers, 10% of covid patients go inpatient, and 10% of that group die anyway - leaving approximately 1% fatality overall."
16028,"When the hospitals are full, how much does that number climb?"
16029,Will the full 10% of those who would have gone inpatient be at severe risk of fatality?

16044,Then 2021 in he is diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma.
16045,One of the lesions on his bones was so bad he fractured his hip and had to have emergency surgery.
16046,His melanoma would have been a thing regardless but it sure would have been nice to catch it before he broke his hip.
16047,"Thankfully we are currently hopeful we still caught it in time (it hadn't spread to any organs, just four spots on his bones)."
16048,My FIL died from lung cancer on February (it's been a shit year) and also had delays in treatment because of Covid.
16049,"My husband only got to see him once between diagnosis and him passing away (first flight felt risky, second was scheduled during a spike and we canceled it)."
16050,I'm just so angry.

16078,"But why would people who don't think science is real use science to treat there ""made up"" virus they caught?"
16079,They should just deal with it at home like the strong independent Americans they think they are.
16080,We're fighting that battle in my county now.
16081,Our board decided mandatory masks for k-8 and recommended for high school.
16082,All the surrounding counties are optional for everyone.
16083,I've never seen people here so upset.
16084,Everyone believes it won't be them or their kid till it is.
16085,"At least at my friend's facility,  they abandoned social distancing after less than one week due to the impossibility of maintaining it while caring for all the kids in need"
16086,Because you cannot test that many people for a single drug in a short period of time.
16087,This is totally different with this vaccine.
16088,Millions have been given the injection already.
16089,Much more than any other drug during a 3 years trial.
16090,You can go ahead and take it already.
16091,"Sure, but doing it by age bracket/level of urgency seems fair."
16092,I'm 36 and I've had my second one for a few weeks now.
16093,Taking it out of the tobacco companies would be better.
16094,There got to be a ratio of products sold to healthcare costs and just slap them with it.
16095,That's what I was wondering.
16096,"When these headlines are saying ""we're out of beds"" do they mean physical beds, or staffed beds."
16097,My cynicism says it's the physical beds because they're easier to count.
16098,In their phase 1 trials measurable immunity was pushed much higher and there were no adverse effects beyond what the first doses gave.
16099,"There's certainly no reason to believe this would be unsafe (people get different vaccines or boosters all the time, and the CDC's only guidance is to wait 2 weeks between them)."
16100,"One less first dose would be available for others, but in the US this is probably not a consideration."
16101,&gt;Safer risk than letting the kids all get Delta.
16102,"That is a large assumption and even though I am very pro vaccine, I am glad that they are not taking it."
16103,Honestly the overall risk of Covid on young children is very small when considering a vaccine so any number of safety indications can turn it upside down.

16199,How did they mess that up?
16200,There is a whole industry tweaking food to make it taste good while the normal Don Quixote doing their shopping is programmed by nature that if it tastes good it is good.
16201,Same.
16202,And it really fucking sucks
16203,"""The sharp rise in our numbers is driven by the unvaccinated,"" Cooper said at a news conference."

16217,"You're certainly welcome to treat Covid with hesitancy until we have more data, just keep in mind that the data/reassurance you're looking for might be years/decades in coming, if it ever does, and you still won't be guaranteed a life full of the risk of post viral syndromes."

16437,A further 21% utilize the practice in very rare instances (5% or less of their total patients); this means that around four out of five DOs don‚Äôt utilize the practice in any meaningful way.
16438,"In fact, only around 4% utilize the practice on more than half of their patients."
16439,"Further, for those DOs that do utilize the practice in rare instances, we don‚Äôt know which aspects of OMT they are utilizing‚Äîit could be one of the very few OMT techniques that has shown some minor therapeutic benefits such as lower-back manipulation."

16444,"OMT training for DOs is no different than military aviators undergoing firearms training; they likely will never use it, but they jump through the hoops and know how to do it."

16481,"Well yes and I get the ""intent"" of such headlines but it's not really a valid comparison since intent is  ""everyone"" gets the vaccine and have this very small risk of myocarditis, but that's not comparable to risk of myocarditis from covid19."
16482,You need to include risk of getting covid19 (varies depending on environmental and community spread at the time) which is obviously less likely than getting the vaccine (100%)

16496,So you mean the PRC CDC has a variety of different ways it assesses if cases are suspected or confirmed?
16497,"&gt;According to this document, a ""confirmed case"" only requires a positive PCR test and symptoms like a fever or dry cough."
16498,An epidemiological connection or lung imaging are not required.

16501,"Indeed it says this

""Confirmed cases were diagnosed based on positive viral nucleic acid test results on throat swab samples (some samples were tested retrospectively)."""
16502,which says for a confirmed case a positive test is enough.
16503,Which means that asymptomatic is a subset of confirmed.
16504,In particular it doesn't say you need symptoms to be a confirmed case.

16520,Get vaccinated and accept the risk of a small illness and stop trying to guilt vaccinated people in complying with theatre at this point.
16521,"The mental health component is wildly under-discussed, especially given how lockdown isolation  impacted mental health for many."
16522,The spectrum ranges from poor executive functioning due to depression/mental illness to outright passive suicidal ideation.
16523,This is one of the biggest reasons we all need to keep talking to people we know who aren‚Äôt vaccinated until it‚Äôs firmly established that they are willfully anti-vax and not just struggling.

16525,"To my memory I thought that Pfizer's higher dose test wasn't significantly more effective than their lower dose, and so they chose to go with the lower dose."
16526,I'm so sorry.
16527,"I lost my father to Melanoma when I was 2, in 1987."
16528,The advances in melanoma since them have been incredible.
16529,Hang in there.
16530,"This is like game developers who do their own previews saying

Our game has a 30 hour main story, 50 hours if you do all side content...

You know damn well you're 100%ing that fucker in 15 hours ü§£"
16531,Healthcare staff truly are heroes.
16532,Front line worker.
16533,Wife and I got our first dose Dec 24th.
16534,"So yeah, hopefully a booster soon."
16535,Try telling that to a patient who walks in screaming for help between gasping for air.
16536,It‚Äôs not that easy to refuse or delay treatment.
16537,My post wasn‚Äôt political though?
16538,I was stating the situation of the church regarding covid vaccination.
16539,"Soooo, designing fashion dolls takes more work, thought, and engineering than a lot of people realize."
16540,"You can't just think about what the doll looks like naked, you have to think about what she looks like with clothes on."
16541,The fabric for doll clothing is proportionately very thick to the doll.
16542,"If a doll has realistic body proportions, she might look fine naked but she's going to look shapeless, lumpy, and smothered when the clothes are on her."
16543,You won't get the look that you're going for.
16544,One area where you can REALLY see this is the neck.
16545,Fashion dolls usually have very long necks.
16546,"If they have a proportionate neck, they again look fine naked or with a low neckline, but put them in something with a collar or anything like that and it looks like they have no neck."
16547,"In addition, you also have to design dolls so that they're easy to dress and play with."
16548,Little kids have tiny fingers and developing motor skills.
16549,A fashion doll always has to have a thigh gap if you want to put pants on her!
16550,Shared clothes and accessories are also a concern.
16551,"A bigger range in body types means all of the dolls need separate clothes, that's a hard sell for parents and kids."
16552,"Same goes for accessories, it won't be very fun to play with plus size Barbie if she can't fit into the car."
16553,I don't know as much about face design but I'm sure there are limitations there.
16554,I know you do want the face to be expressive.
16555,"With how small Barbie faces are, it's hard to have subtle details."
16556,"And of course, you ultimately need to appeal to kids!"
16557,"Body positivity is a nice sentiment, but you can't sell a toy (or any product, really) on values alone."
16558,You still need an appealing product.
16559,"And I really don't think most kids actually care about realistic body and face presentation, that's generally an adult concern."
16560,"Hell, most kids aren't polite or PC about this sort of thing, they'll tell you they think the doll is ugly, lol."
16561,"It's all just as well, I don't think dolls are a cause of body insecurities and beauty biases."
16562,"They are at best a symptom, and changing them won't help anything if overall societal attitudes remain the same."
16563,"If kids think that fat girls are ugly, they just won't buy the fat girl doll even if you try to tell them that she's pretty."
16564,I live and work in Georgia and at a certain point EAMC called our HR department and ‚Äòinvited‚Äô our employees over to Auburn/Opelika to get vaccinated since they couldn‚Äôt get enough local residents to take them up on the vaccines.
16565,So don‚Äôt feel bad about getting yours then.
16566,Fortunately Florida has a lot of sand.
16567,Makes it easier to bury your head in it.
16568,[removed]
16569,"Ah, I misread the comment above yours, didn't notice it was about the people that took them and their compliance with mandates."
16570,Never mind.
16571,How soon and how young?
16572,"It's been pretty much known since March 2020 that it will become endemic, so neither of those options."
16573,Covid-19 simply doesn't have the characteristics that make a disease a candidate for eradication.
16574,"It is easily transmissable, spreads asymptomatically, and has animal reservoirs."
16575,"A long shot completely sterilizing immunity maybe could have done it, but the vaccines we have are much better than experts expected (and will end the pandemic), so a perfect vaccine was never really in the cards."
16576,The J&amp;J used the cloned fetal cells as a host to create their intermediate virus.
16577,"J&amp;J uses another virus (I think it's just the common cold) to carry their spike protein code, which has to be bred in living cells."
16578,"They swap the virus' normal payload for the spike protein code instead, but it's just easier to grow viruses in their preferred host cell than to make our own."
16579,So if you're *super* pro-life you might consider avoiding that one.
16580,"But all that means is that you should get the Pfizer or Moderna, which are more effective anyways."
16581,8 months fully vaccinated and seriously considering popping into a Walgreens for a third dose.
16582,&gt;Moderna is not a much smaller company.
16583,They might have been 18 months ago but they are quickly gaining ground on Pfizer.
16584,"Sure but just in terms of employees Moderna is at 1,500ish while Pfizer is 78,500."
16585,Huge difference in people power even if Moderna is expanding rapidly.
16586,(They were at ~830 employees March 2020)
16587,"ok, so mRNA this weekend it is then."
16588,I‚Äôm betting if they tested enough kids throughout the pandemic this figure would be somewhat lost amongst the figures.
16589,"I feel for people working on wards sweating their asses off for 16 hours while their Governor just basically says 'don't worry about it so he can make friends with the tinfoil brigade', must be enfuriating!"
16590,!
16591,"It seems like if variants are different enough, you can get reinfected."
16592,We don't know how effective previous infection is in building up immunity unfortunately.
16593,I've read a lot of people talking about their own experience getting reinfected.
16594,Not sure if we have any thorough studies on it...
16595,I got Pfizer myself and had nothing but a sore arm for a day.
16596,My parents and cousins got Moderna and there was a period of maybe 12hrs post 2nd dose when none of them could barely move they were so incapacitated lol.
16597,[removed]
16598,I agree expectations were high but if Delta variant didn‚Äôt emerge and we just had original variant.. would those original expectations be in line?
16599,What did I say that disagreed with where the spread is coming from?
16600,"My point is, when individual locales are reporting 20-25% of their cases in vaccinated people (Marin County, CA and Lexington, KY in addition to L.A., off the top of my head), it makes me question the 99% stat that's being thrown around as gospel."
16601,Mostly because it's presented as a universal fact when it's not universal at all.
16602,Los Angeles County is 25% of California's population and we have always been the largest source of cases in the state.
16603,"3,734 of the 10,111 cases CA reported yesterday were ours."
16604,I think it's safe to say that 25% of our cases in vaccinated people is not corroborating a 99% unvaccinated case rate here.
16605,I put it off until last Sunday (got my first dose!)
16606,"because scheduling ""sick days"" as a sort of single mom (husband works away) is tough."
16607,Juggling child care and housework.
16608,Then timing it right for the booster as well.
16609,"I also tend to have vaccine reactions, so I wanted to make sure I had someone available 24hrs at least to call on a dime."
16610,"I'm glad I did,  because I ended up having hives, and got very sick for 48hrs."
16611,I know he does; that doesn't mean some Catholics won't still try to get out of it.
16612,"Like I said, it's not perfect."
16613,"To play the devil's advocate a bit though:  Should society pay for someone that has a known heart condition that has a heart attack after refusing to take their meds, change their diet, or improve their condition in any way?"
16614,The social contract is both give and take.
16615,"We must have empathy and show mercy, but the people society cares for must also put effort into becoming healthy."
16616,"Austin is in Texas, which is keeping the city from enforcing mandates."
16617,"Any business getting government finding (like the giant university system) is not allowed to enforce masks, vaccines, or even ask if someone is vaccinated."
16618,"Nothing is closed, events are not cancelled, no one has to wear a mask."
16619,It's a mess.
16620,Our hospitals are full and the spike just continues.
16621,BioNTech has produced a Delta-specific vaccine and will start trials this month.
16622,"But as the other commenter wrote, a third shot with the original vaccine seems to do the trick just fine."
16623,Maybe using Moderna for people vaccinated with BioNTech/Pfizer and vice versa could be slightly more effective.
16624,Thanks for your service
16625,"So far, yes."
16626,"I believe both Moderna and Pfizer are testing variant-specific boosters, but those aren‚Äôt publicly available yet."
16627,"Staff are already being fired for not getting vaccinated, it'll be bad if the rest have to pick up the burden and eventually quit for being overworked."
16628,"There is already high turnover for CNAs and other staff along with a doctor and nurses shortage, all which will only be exacerbated as many colleges and universities canceled classes and clinicals over the last year and a half."
16629,[removed]
16630,Welcome.
16631,I just looked this up.
16632,"I love reddit sometimes

https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qxgxw/self_just_how_big_is_ipv6/"
16633,Not that I know of.
16634,I've been searching to find anything but all the data is for pfizer against delta.
16635,Moderna delta data seems to be under wraps.
16636,Which is kinda concerning.
16637,The possibility of covid becoming a seasonal endemic illness was largely unavoidable the moment the virus got a world-wide foothold.
16638,"You can contain a virus that's localized in a limited number of cases in a specific area, but eradicating a virus that exists worldwide is really really hard."
16639,How much do they cost?
16640,Do you expect them to start handpainting Barbie dolls?
16641,Barbie was never supposed to be ‚Äúreality‚Äù
16642,This.
16643,"Being scared or not scared doesn't change the percent chance that someone will get it or that their symptoms will be mild, moderate or severe."
16644,Masks aren't a symbol of fear; they're a simple preventative measure.
16645,God I hate the fear argument so much.
16646,People with unwise decision get what they want (natural selection)
16647,"As long as you don‚Äôt put your hand in your mouth, your chances of getting Covid in a car are extremely low."
16648,I think he made it so the schools can‚Äôt mandate masks.
16649,"Kids can still wear them, they just can‚Äôt be required to wear one."
16650,I was actually surprised when we went to meet the teacher today that there was about half of the kids wearing them.
16651,I thought we would be the only ones!
16652,"It's the mental exhausted combined with dealing with anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers all while being fed empty lip service of ""Thank you, essential workers!"
16653,"We love you!"""
16654,I've known several people who worked as nurses all whom have walked out.
16655,They couldn't take it anymore and it wasn't worth their life.
16656,"As a vaccinated person I'm only wearing masks in places that actually require me to wear a mask, I still go to work everyday, and j take trips to different places on the weekends."
16657,I've earned some normalcy.
16658,if I worked in a hospital and had access to free childcare because of a WFH spouse I'd be living in the hospital racking up the overtime.
16659,just like a northeastern union employee.

16674,(PS: I say this as a smoker)
16675,&gt;  I agree that that's a possible reading of this document.
16676,Can you suggest any other way of reading it?
16677,"The other thing a lot of these movies stories have is 

1) fast infection."
16678,"I think WWZ was 13 seconds, many are minutes or less  

2) initial disbelief that allows the zombie hordes to grow to an unmanageable size before appropriate intervention 

 and in one case 3) complete worldwide infection, triggered by any death (the walking dead)  This one makes it a much more realistic possibility."
16679,"The asymptomatic infection that is everywhere would mean the horde is coming from every spot on the planet, simultaneously, growing exponentially, making nearly impossible to bomb away, as there would be so many locations, and any collateral damage can either lower net kill count or even increase the size of the horde."
16680,A walking dead style plague would be absolutely insane to try to stop.
16681,"Once it is around the world, it would start making zombies at 120 a minute, increasing exponentially as those zombies create new ones."
16682,"You would have to figure out that every person dying is producing a zombie, bitten or not, and get that information out in the middle of a massive worldwide disaster, and FAST."
16683,"First wave zombies would reach over 100,000 within the first day of the outbreak."

16697,"Florida Virtual school is still an option I believe, but its fully online meaning kids never step into a classroom ever."
16698,I teach at a university and we also can't ask students to mask or vaccinate.
16699,Also big classes with no distancing.
16700,I think it‚Äôs funny when people who were raised with Barbie think it‚Äôs benign like legos or coloring books.

16702,Barbie puts a weird unrealistic filter on reality.

16704,To argue that these things done matter at all is just odd.
16705,"It's so puzzling to me that everyone is debating whether or not to allow children to gather in schools without realizing that this has been happening *the entire time*, only without lessons."
16706,"And the numbers were low, until delta (which wasn't an easy thing to predict)."

16744,AR resident here.

16837,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covid.html

&gt;Overall the news is reassuring when it comes to children and the risks of serious complications from Covid-19, and there‚Äôs no indication that the Delta variant puts children at greater risk of more serious illness."
16838,"The delta variant is said to be more infectious, which makes it objectively more dangerous to kids in that they can more easily get it, even if the overall risk of a serious illness from a single infection hasn't changed."
16839,"In other words, more chances to roll the dice."
16840,It's also possible that there are more infections due to changes in behavior.
16841,"Again, more chances to roll the dice, but it could still have the same risk of a single infection causing a severe illness."

16845,"Speaking as a Texan who follows state/local politics closely:

Abbott was originally whole-hog on doing whatever he could to defeat COVID-19."
16846,He was moving so quickly in the early days--when I was out of state--that I was almost afraid he was going to close the state borders and leave me locked out of home.
16847,"However, that changed a few weeks into the pandemic with the Shelley Luther incident."
16848,"You can look it up if you want, but the tl;dr is that

* There was a ritzy salon owner in the DFW area who had her business closed by state order;

* In spite of this, she protested by opening her business regardless;

* The punishment was jail time and a fine."
16849,"When these punishments were meted out, Luther (and people in state politics orbiting her) launched a GoFundMe and media PR blitz that raised *ungodly* amounts of attention and money."
16850,* This also happened to be at the same time the former prez was starting to deviate from his initial COVID plan into...whatever it was he ended up doing.
16851,And the primary-voting faction of his party *loved* him for it.
16852,"* Combined, these two pressure points forced Abbott to let Luther out of jail and waive her punishments."
16853,"In essence, it was kind of equivalent to when Syria crossed Obama's ""red line""...and he didn't do anything about it, which both made him look very weak *and* made him extremely unpopular from all sides of the issue."
16854,Abbott is nothing if not a man driven by political instinct who knows how to read the tea leaves.
16855,"Between this incident, the epic power failure/snowpocalypse that caused billions in damages and froze scores of Texans to death, and the takeover of the state GOP by Allen West (a real character who just left its leadership position to announce his intent to primary Abbott), Abbott has realized he is in an incredibly unsafe position."
16856,"He does not want to get primaried for being seen as ""too liberal"" by addressing COVID, because that will 100% be the end of his career."
16857,"You lose a Republican primary in Texas, you're done for."
16858,"Until Abbott fears losing a primary more because of inaction than he does for taking action, he's going to do jack squat."
16859,I used to regret not going to medical school and becoming a doctor.
16860,Now I'm glad I didn't.
16861,I've had the vaccine and so have all of my friends.

16867,"You can have a million hospital beds, but those are not ICU beds."
16868,ICU care is highly specialized.
16869,It's a nurse and doctor keeping someone alive artificially until they may recover.
16870,"So for that matter, you could have a million *ICU* beds, but if you don't have the staff to operate them, you effectively have *zero* ICU beds."
16871,*shrug*
16872,Probably costs a fortune though.
16873,"Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in Florida:

16875,They have people in the Emergency Department in recliners.
16876,They are doing ICU level treatments to patients in regular rooms.
16877,Which means they are stretching ICU experienced nurses way thin to cover everyone who needs it.
16878,We don't have enough high level monitoring systems for all of the ICU patients.
16879,The hospital is using up a week's worth of Oxygen every 2 days.
16880,"The O2 pump has to maintain 50 psi to keep enough pressure in the system to provide O2 to every room and it crashed to 35 psi last night, but they were able to get it fixed."""
16881,"https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/08/04/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases-spike-962-hospitalizations-keep-rising/

According to this the hospitalizations have tripled from what they were a month ago, and the daily case count today was the highest it‚Äôs been since March."
16882,It may be a bit premature to be taking victory laps.
16883,"Yes the vaccination rate is higher, and they‚Äôre better off for it but it‚Äôs still not high enough to beat Delta."
16884,"Things are likely to get much worse before they get better, even in Mass."
16885,Let's take this opportunity to remember that severe hospitalization with COVID is associated with an up to ~7 IQ drop.
16886,"And for even mild cases that don't require hospitalization, ~1 IQ point."

16928,My life circumstances are also such that I‚Äôve had to become intimately familiar with COVID and its physiological effects due to a young family member‚Äôs condition that makes them particularly susceptible to it.

16956,I'm numb right now just thinking of the possibilities.
16957,That‚Äôs very frustrating when we‚Äôre being comparatively inefficient about it.
16958,You have to go to a specific vaccine centre or like a GP to have it done here.
16959,"I went to a centre they‚Äôve set up in a church for mine, but had to book a slot and wait in a big line."
16960,It would be way better if we could just get it done at the supermarket but I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone doing that here.
16961,You guys have also approved it (or are going to?)

16976,"She has ""tried"" everything and even quit for about a year but after improving to the point that she didn't need to be on oxygen 24/7 she started smoking again."
16977,At this point the only way she is going to quit is when she is in the ground.

16988,Biology (and by extension medicine) is messy and complicated.
16989,"Nothing will ever be 100%, which is part of why herd immunity is such an important part of any vaccination campaign."
16990,"The COVID-19 vaccines are significantly more effective than the annual flu vaccine but notably less effective than the measles and polio vaccines, partially because the flu mutates quickly and measles and polio don't, and COVID-19 mutates somewhat less quickly and the vaccines are targeted at the spike which can't mutate as much if it's still going to be able to infect humans."
16991,"But I assume in addition to mutation concerns, there's also something about how the virus and immune response to it work that mean a vaccine can't be 100% effective."
16992,"An alternating view could be that precisely because of that behaivior we are allowing society to be more unhealthy, more careless in general because they know that they will get cared for regardless of the cost."
16993,Cost of care for such people usually gets amortized by rest of the society so they don't feel the pain and by the time we all feel the pain due costs increasing across the board it will be too late to do something.

17005,"It is intended to target specific areas of the country where cases are rapidly increasing, which likely would be exacerbated by mass evictions."
17006,That's misleading math?
17007,But telling people that the death rate is .002% by taking 100 deaths by 4.3 million people isn't?
17008,"The problem is we have no idea what the denominator is and can only make guesses, but it sure as hell isn't 4.3 million."
17009,I want to see the percentage for hospitalizations who are vaccinated.

17019,What would be Abbott's counter to this?
17020,Litigation?
17021,I thought so too but a quick calculation shows that the overall mortality rate from confirmed infections in MA is about 2.5%.
17022,"If you multiply breakthrough infections by 2.5%, the total number of deaths would have doubled."
17023,"So the vaccinations are preventing infections in general, reducing hospitalizations, and when there is a breakthrough infection the mortality rate is halved."
17024,"There have been just about 18,000 deaths in MA from Covid in total."
17025,"By this math 9,000 lives would have been saved if we had the vaccines a year and a half ago."
17026,That‚Äôs a lot more than nothing.
17027,"Seems reasonable, exacerbating the healthcare worker shortage won‚Äôt help anybody."
17028,"And most of them have had covid already so they have the antibodies, so while not ideal it‚Äôs better than nothing."

17035,Over 90% of those 65 and older are vaccinated.
17036,So the pool of vaccinated individuals is much bigger and skews more older/vulnerable and therefore not an apples to apples comparison.

17117,I tried to get my family of 5 tested for the last 2 days.
17118,There is no testing within 45 minutes of me except on Mondays and Fridays.
17119,I tried to book at one of the only places with open appointment times an hour away and apparently they don‚Äôt test people under 3 years old.
17120,"The other place I found an hour and 15 minutes away charges $85/pp, so it was going to cost $425, which might get reimbursed by insurance."
17121,"Long story short, we‚Äôre not getting tested unless we are still symptomatic by Friday."
17122,We will just assume we have 3 breakthrough cases and two reinfections in the house and not go anywhere for at least 10 days.
17123,Testing access should not be an issue anymore.
17124,This is ridiculous.
17125,Idk how the CDC saying that it ‚Äúmay‚Äù be more dangerous = ‚Äúthe CDC says it‚Äôs more dangerous‚Äù to you but I suppose this is how bullshit it spread on the Internet.
17126,All data from every country dealing with or already have dealt with delta shows that the case fatality ratio is significantly lower.
17127,The CDC doesn‚Äôt have the information to guarantee the factors for that so they say ‚Äúmay‚Äù because they never make guarantees unless they‚Äôre positive.
17128,I imagine that more people get sick from personal acquaintances than anything else.

17136,"More importantly, every WALMART has them."
17137,"Every hospital has them, hell grocery store pharmacies have them."
17138,We have such a surplus it's rediculous.
17139,"Most of my state is actively fighting against the idea of wearing a mask (and has been since the beginning), much less getting a vaccine."
17140,"At this point, after spending a year masking, distancing and finally getting vaccinated, only to find out that a variant has come up due to so many not getting vaccinated...I don't even know how to feel."
17141,"Well ,i mean people also die in ugly cali while they have CRAZY restrictions‚Ä¶..
You take the covid situation in the whole word ‚Ä¶it s pretty much the same result everywhere, mask mandatory or not etc etc ‚Ä¶."
17142,"So yeah ,Florida handle it better ,we also die ,but at least we are free."
17143,"Not looking for confrontation, i have both my vaccines and i wear a mask everytime i am asked to."
17144,Its not a possible scenario.
17145,Look at Provincetown MA... 3/4 infected were vaccinated.
17146,I caught it from my 3yo despite myself being fully vaccinated.

17198,If there were room to change it e ough to invalidate the vaccine but still be infectious (which there really isn't) they make a new vaccine targeting that.

17374,"It‚Äôs how fast something is growing or decaying, in this case expressed as Rt which is the number of new infections per case."
17375,"So these show that Rt numbers are dropping to and below 1, meaning each new case results in about 1 new case or slightly less than 1 new case."
17376,"It used to be 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc., meaning growth was accelerating as well as increasing."
17377,Getting to 1 means means the growth rate is flattening rather than still growing.
17378,"If you plotted actual cases during accelerating Rt figures you get what appears to be exponential growth w/ very steep and intense increases (1.2, 1,3, 1.4, etc.)."
17379,1 is the flattening stage followed by declining as Rt moves below 1.
17380,"I just looked at our tracker, 164 confirmed cases."

17738,It depends on your goals.
17739,If your goal is to not be infected or if you are infected have a asymptomatic case with low viral load having active antibodies would likely help.
17740,If your goal is just to avoid hospitalization then likely your memory cells are good enough.
17741,"I have seen no evidence that would insinuate having a high level of antibodies during a pandemic would be ""bad""."
17742,There is plenty of uncertainty in the roles of memory cells vs antibodies so further studies are required to make any definitive statement in this regards.
17743,Just to be clear why it matters I would like to give an example.
17744,If I had high level of antibodies I would be much more comfortable visiting elderly parents (75+) in age.
17745,Having memory cells will likely protect me from serious infection but antibodies are what would likely prevent me from ever getting a viral load high enough to infect someone else.
17746,Could my memory cells rush into action and create enough antibodies to make up for my low base level?
17747,Maybe.
17748,"My major goal is to avoid getting infected, and if I am infected not transmit it to anyone I care about especially not my elderly parents."
17749,Having a high level of antibody titers is likely a major player in accomplishing this goal.

17754,"The virus is spreading nearly unimpeded in the United States right now, with almost 100,000 new cases per day, now with selective pressure towards vaccine resistance."

18018,"From ""Discussion"":

""Our results suggest that CBD can block SARS-CoV-2 infection at early stages of infection, and CBD administration is associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans."
18019,"Furthermore, the active compound in patients is likely to be 7-OH-CBD, the same metabolite implicated in CBD treatment of epilepsy."
18020,The substantial reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk of approximately an order of magnitude in patients who took FDA-approved CBD highlights the potential efficacy of this drug in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
18021,"Finally, the ability of CBD to inhibit replication of MHV raises the possibility that CBD may have efficacy against new pathogenic viruses arising in the future."
18022,One mechanism contributing to the antiviral activity of CBD is the induction of the interferon pathway both directly and indirectly following activation of the host immune response to the viral pathogen.
18023,"In fact, interferons have been tested clinically as potential treatments for COVID-19 (21)."
18024,"Importantly, CBD also suppresses cytokine activation in response to viral infection, reducing the likelihood of immune cell recruitment and subsequent cytokine storms within the lungs and other affected tissues."
18025,These results complement previous findings suggesting that CBD suppresses cytokine production in recruited immune cells such as macrophages (22).
18026,"Thus, CBD has to the potential not only to act as an antiviral agent at early stages of infection but also to protect the host against an overactive immune system at later stages."
18027,CBD has a number of advantages as a potential preventative agent against SARS-CoV-2.
18028,CBD is widely available without restricted access if the content of THC is &lt;0.3%.
18029,"There are multiple means of ingestion, including potential for inhalation and nasal delivery."
18030,"CBD blocks viral replication after entry into cells and, thus, is likely to be effective against viral variants with mutant spike proteins."
18031,"Unlike drugs such as remdesivir or antiviral antibodies, CBD administration does not require injection in hospital settings."
18032,"Finally, CBD is associated with only minor side effects (15)."
18033,"However, several issues require close examination before CBD can be considered or even explored as a therapeutic for COVID-19 (11)."
18034,"Although many CBD formulations are available on the market, they vary vastly in quality, the amount of CBD, and their pharmacokinetic properties after oral administration, which are mostly unknown."
18035,"CBD is quite hydrophobic and forms large micellar structures that are trapped and broken down in the liver, thereby limiting the amount of drug available to other tissues after oral administration."
18036,The inactive carriers have a significant impact on clinically obtainable concentrations.
18037,"As CBD is widely sold as a preparation in an edible oil, we analyzed flavored commercial hemp oils and found a CBD content of only 0.30% in a representative sample (fig."
18038,S12).
18039,"The purity of CBD and, in particular, the composition of the materials labelled as CBD are also important, especially in light of our findings suggesting that other cannabinoids such as THC might act to counter CBD antiviral efficacy."
18040,"This essentially eliminates the feasibility of marijuana serving as an effective source of antiviral CBD, in addition to issues related to its legal status."
18041,"Finally, other means of CBD administration such as vaping and smoking raise concerns about potential lung damage."
18042,Future studies to explore the optimal means of CBD delivery to patients along with clinical trials will be needed to fully test the promise of CBD as a therapeutic to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.
18043,"As the clearance rates for CBD in plasma are substantially lower in humans than mice, we would suggest moving to clinical trials rather than doing preclinical studies in animal models (15)."
18044,We advocate carefully designed placebo-controlled clinical trials with known concentrations and highly-characterized formulations in order to define CBD‚Äôs role in preventing and treating early SARS-CoV-2 infection.
18045,The necessary human in vivo concentration and optimal route and formulation remain to be defined.
18046,"We strongly caution against the urge to take CBD in presently available formulations as a preventative or treatment therapy at this time, especially without the knowledge of a rigorous randomized clinical trial with this natural product (23)."""
18047,Now he'll just say he has antibodies and his immune system will get him through.

18067,*
18068,This is the best diet.
18069,"Nurses were understaffed, over worked, and under paid, and that was before COVID-19."
18070,Things are coming to a head now.
18071,If 100% of Americans were vaccinated and the rest of the world is not the virus will still continue to mutate.
18072,[removed]
18073,"How, in a f@cking GLOBAL PANDEMIC, is this not already policy **worldwide* *??"
18074,The willful ignorance/emphasis on $$ over human lives is utterly appalling.
18075,"It was, but a few thousand of those people died and another few thousand quit or found places to work that didn‚Äôt expose them the same way."
18076,Everyone else just realized that the people controlling their work lives (the government and hospital administrators) don‚Äôt give a shit and so now the nurses and doctors are looking out for themselves first.
18077,And that‚Äôs part of the point of this whole thing that I feel many of us are missing.
18078,Our ways of life kind of pivot on a very small number of smart or skilled people and we don‚Äôt pay attention much to how well we‚Äôre taking care of those people or the resources they need to do what they do.
18079,"The rewards all trickle upwards to the managers, and the managers all make sure of that for each other."
18080,But the managers aren‚Äôt the ones with the skill.
18081,I‚Äôm visiting San Antonio now.
18082,"My niece received that text, too."
18083,"When I flew into San Antonio last Friday, they had a vaccination station near baggage pickup."
18084,The station had zero patients.
18085,"They absolute only place in town where I have seen more than 10% of people in masks was the museum of fine art, and 95% of the patrons there had on masks."

18109,Awesome.
18110,"I live in Charlottesville, tiny by comparison."
18111,But two of the city council/mayor team has not been vaccinated.
18112,Just 59% of police have been vaccinated and other city works members are worse.
18113,Mandate this stuff ASAP.

18134,As far as I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs basically nothing contraindicated for taking a vaccine.
18135,You can be allergic to an ingredient in something but Moderna and J&amp;J share almost no active ingredients.

18155,I hope it don‚Äôt last forever xD
18156,"I'm admittedly not an expert, but isn't it disingenuous to compare the 10% of vaccinated that have the same viral load to the unvaccinated?"
18157,"If we pretend half of 300 million people are vaccinated, you're comparing 150 million to 15 million, and saying  ""Both are growing ground for variants."
18158,"Sure, might be less of a chance, but a chance nontheless."""

18167,This surge really is going to be the wurst one yet for many states.
18168,SMDH
18169,There is no data - that‚Äôs the problem.
18170,And there may be random screening in some states and countries but it‚Äôs definitely not widespread.
18171,"Yes it is problematic - but it‚Äôs not realistic for people to go get tested every time they have a runny nose, or in the asymptomatic case - just randomly because maybe they have it."
18172,You‚Äôre a long hauler
18173,The unvaccinated should be sent home and removed from their ICU bed should another person need it.
18174,even 1 out of 10 seems high...
18175,I was thinking it was more like 1 in 20.
18176,"Even so, that 1 is probably high risk or 65+ in most cases."
18177,People are just so unbelievably dumb to not get vaccinated.
18178,"Hah, sorry I should have been clearer."

18182,Lots are quitting.
18183,"And maybe as a trial schedule alcohol, make it prescription only."
18184,Way too complex to coordinate.
18185,"I mean FedEx, USPS, and UPS have issues get packages a few states over on time."
18186,Look at it this way.
18187,"-You have to round up vaccines or make some procedure to ship them back from pharmacies, there are multiple different companies, with different procedures, computers, inventory systems, state databases etc."
18188,-you then have to ship or gather these from all these hundreds of remote locations keeping them within storage parameters and transfer them all to some sort of central locations probably for combined packaging and inventory.
18189,-then you have to processes whatever necessary international shipping requirements are needed and coordinate it with the receiving country so they‚Äôre prepared to store the stuff.
18190,If there was a simple single end distribution it may be possible.
18191,But it‚Äôs just a lot of stuff to try and drive down into timeframes especially when the stuff is close to expiration.
18192,NONE

18196,"And Biden and Harris both at one point made a stink about not taking any trump vaccine if he rushed it, you know to make them available sooner if safe, and although not as consequential, another failure."

18224,*
18225,I keep hear people say this.
18226,Bit the same people said something else before older people were vaccinated.
18227,"And not only those people but also governments said the same which was ""young people are fine and don't need to go to the hospital and it's just a cough for healthy young people""."
18228,And indeed every young person thay died during thay first waves git a stamp om his slate that he or she also had other health problems which caused their deaths and still healthy young people are not at risk.
18229,"Today we get : ""yes old people are vaccinated so sure young people are now in the hospital"".....healthy young people who wouldn't where at risk just a few months ago?"
18230,They shouldn't be in the hospital according to al those statements they made before.
18231,Thi gbis tjay they need those age categories to go to work.
18232,And if they het scared they won't go anymore so they do everything to prevent then from being scared.
18233,And so it baffles me that many people think its normal hospitals are now filled with young healthy people.
18234,Which according to many countries and people was impossible.
18235,"Trump banned people for political reasons, the vaccination requirement is a medical reason."
18236,I do not see how those would be the same thing.
18237,My exact words.
18238,Are you gonna fund bubble suits for the globe?
18239,Or do you expect someone else to do that?
18240,Everyone will have a different approach.
18241,I personally will live life as close to 2019 levels as possible during lulls between major waves.
18242,I‚Äôll hunker down a bit when we are seeing significant community spread.
18243,"Otherwise, I‚Äôll just take whatever vaccine is available as necessary and hope for the best."
18244,"Now if we really want to get proactive, we can push for legislation mandating vaccines @ a government level."
18245,At a personal level we can advocate for our workplaces to mandate vaccines and our schools to follow suit if / when we see the next age group of kids cleared to get the vaccine.
18246,Good luck.
18247,It doesn‚Äôt even really mean much right now since they are being purposely vague on what they mean.
18248,It‚Äôs a very different statement to say the protection from serious disease does not wane vs the protection from symptomatic infection does not wane.
18249,One would put it in line with all the other studies we are seeing but obviously they would like the financial world to read it a little different.
18250,[removed]
18251,Are they talking against severe disease only?
18252,3 of 6 of my relatives who got Moderna just got over symptomatic breakthrough infections.
18253,"I know it‚Äôs an anecdote, but there are many similar stories now (with all of the vaccines)."
18254,You should have empathy for the vaccinated who had unrelated emergencies and couldn't get adequate care because the plague of unvaccinated are clogging the healthcare system.

18263,"&gt;could not match the budget of the developed nations in procuring vaccines last year

even developed nations had some trouble with that."
18264,Belgium had a slow vaccination start partially because of [vaccine delivery troubles].
18265,And Belgium PRODUCES the Pfizer vaccine.
18266,"So yeah, I can only imagine the trouble there."
18267,&gt;we will reach herd immunity before the US.
18268,I doubt the US will reach herd immunity at all.
18269,I think a lot of Americans who could have gotten vaccinated by now didn't.
18270,The [vaccination rate seems to be levelling off at 50%](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/).
18271,I hope antivaxxers aren't a big problem in Malaysia?

18273,Less than 2% of patients experience coronary artery enlargement that carries over into adulthood.
18274,"However, when complications do persist, they can impact patients long after childhood symptoms of the disease have subsided."""
18275,Just for reference although admittedly this is a different disease but seems to be the most similar to severe covid in children.
18276,"98% of Kawasaki disease patients which is a very severe pediatric vasculitis, do not get long-term damage from it as far as we can tell."
18277,Data like that is why it is outrageous to claim that an asymptomatic transient vasculitis in a child will cause 100% of them to have issues later in life.
18278,"In short:

* Vaccinations help tremendously, but are not 100% proof, nothing in life is."
18279,"If you become a breakthrough case, the vaccination helps make your symptoms mild versus being on your deathbed."
18280,"Vaccines train your body to respond to it, not prevent it."
18281,"* It's unvaccinated people's fault because they're basically, for lack of a better term, walking petri dishes as it's giving COVID-19 more time to mutate and find ways around the vaccine."
18282,"If people got the vaccine, it would give the virus way less opportunity to mutate."
18283,would you consider that a win for him?
18284,"You're talking about two fundamentally very different cultures, societies, and values with The West and China."
18285,The West spilt a lot of blood fighting against oppression regimes both within and without; those memories are still remembered and ingrained at a young age.
18286,"If you thought that the West would ever adopt the same strategy as China, I got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you."
18287,Proof of vaccine is more important
18288,People care and still do.
18289,I love NYC and it was so depressing seeing Times Square and the park (video feed) so dead because noone was around.
18290,I haven't seen that since 9/11.
18291,It's *wrong* that the selfsame man so directly involved with the failed US Goverment's admission of pandemic into this country would not be in prison for his abdication of The People's duty.
18292,"&gt; But overall, a lot of my staff has started going to therapy, including me."
18293,"It is not unusual for my staff to say something like, ‚Äúwell, my therapist says,‚Äù which I think is great."
18294,We‚Äôre also reading books together.
18295,"We have a book ‚Äî the title is ‚ÄúThe Four Agreement.‚Äù Reading together has calmed a lot of anxiety, it‚Äôs brought us a lot of peace, like it‚Äôs helped us communicate with each other better, so that‚Äôs been nice."
18296,This part of the interview made me sad.
18297,These healthcare workers give and give and give until the point where they themselves are broken.
18298,Sending as many positive thoughts as I can muster from across the causeway in Singapore.
18299,Please stay safe and I hope things get better for you soon.
18300,I‚Äôd be willing to bet he‚Äôs vaccinated
18301,Such vague statements should be outlawed from research studies.
18302,Without the details it‚Äôs all a bit meaningless
18303,That's one of the things to be worked out.
18304,"Travel from countries that use those being permanently banned just isn't happening - initially maybe, but not permanently."
18305,So some more vaccines get recognized.
18306,"Some already recognized vaccines become available for a price in countries that don't use typically them in quantity (maybe even at the embassy consular affairs when applying for a visa..)

And sometimes travel to an intermediate country that recognizes the original vaccine and can legally offer a US recognized one for a price."
18307,&gt;Some obvious examples.
18308,Let‚Äôs say The Right gets their hands on this ability.
18309,"All the sudden, gay sex is banned in the name of slowing HIV/AIDS."
18310,This sounds more like mask mandates than a vaccine passport.
18311,In your analogy there would have been a vaccine for HIV that needed a passport to be able to have orgies on Fire Island or whatever.
18312,"According to The Washington Post, the number of tests reported in Florida fell 12.8% from the previous week."
18313,So I don't know how much I trust that they only rose 5%
18314,Fuck that bro.

18318,I‚Äôm in Alabama and our school district is holding a meeting tonight about a possible mask mandate.

18320,"Kids should be kids, they‚Äôre taking away our personal freedom, masks don‚Äôt help, the virus is a hoax."

18323,"&gt; They absolute only place in town where I have seen more than 10% of people in masks was the museum of fine art, and 95% of the patrons there had on masks."

18329,Ever tried wearing glasses and a mask at the same time?
18330,Foggy logic.
18331,Goggles on the other hand...
18332,Yep.
18333,We have been told to pretty much not talk about Covid and try to push the normal agenda as much as possible.
18334,We are supposed to have commencement in 2 weeks for spring 2020 to now graduates (of which I'm included).
18335,I'm waiting for them to cancel because as it is right now no masks required unless you're not vaccinated (we saw how well this has been working).
18336,Students move into dorms August 19th.
18337,I report back (I delayed a week) next week.
18338,I'll be masking up.
18339,"I have heard some students complain about it, but honestly I don't care."
18340,I meant for immune compromised peolle.
18341,My bad
18342,On one hand there are humans in the world who need this vaccine and cannot get it.
18343,"On the other, cross species spread seems to just seem like a timebomb for a new virus."
18344,We are not in a very good place in this simulation‚Ä¶
18345,"Damn, is the mosquito bite thing true?"
18346,They seem to love my O+ flavor.
18347,I think they will moreso in your top ten vaccinated states.
18348,But the southeast which is like 35% vaxxed?
18349,Good luck
18350,This happened in NYC last spring.
18351,Paramedics would bring heart attack patients that were younger to the hospital but not those who had low survival chances.
18352,It was dark.
18353,I think one aspect we are missing here is that Americans just regularly don‚Äôt go to the doctor and interact with doctors as little as possible in general.
18354,"I know more people see a chiropractor (not a real doctor, they don‚Äôt train that in medical schools sorry) way more often than any real doc until something is seriously wrong."
18355,You also have low uptake of flu shots even among teachers despite their widespread exposure.
18356,"Though Canada isn‚Äôt perfect, and boy a lot could be improved, I can just go to a walk in clinic and I know I won‚Äôt be paying hundreds."
18357,"In America, I literally would be scrambling to find the $50 for a copay or wait it out until payday to go to the doctor if I was ill."
18358,It breeds a culture of fear of going and delay going to be honest.
18359,"Even though the vaccine is free, the clinic I went to still sent me a bill for $40 for an admin fee (which I had to fight.)"
18360,"It‚Äôs really frustrating and why these clinics shouldn‚Äôt even be asking for insurance or even your address- you should just have your name, get your card, and that‚Äôs it."
18361,"I just...honestly, i see a lot of people outside of Alberta shit on Alberta, I think it's a beautiful province and hate the idea of being so divided."
18362,But that Premier is just awful.
18363,Albertans don't deserve this bullshit.
18364,"Good news, killing off some of his nutty base."
18365,"Bad news, too much stress on the healthcare system and the danger for kids under 12."
18366,A real cleanse will need a more deadly pandemic.
18367,"Except that we keep hearing that, for instance, our area in Austin, Texas has 12 ICU rooms free but we keep seeing pictures on the news of hospitals that have people boarding in emergency rooms for days, that all of the hospitals in Houston are on ""divert"", etc."
18368,"All of this stuff can be determined independently, and I *hate* to be a conspiracy theorist but it's adding up about as well as what the state government kept saying about there being enough energy to do rolling blackouts and how wind power was to blame during the ice storm."

18381,It doesn‚Äôt say in their quarterly earnings report but pretty damn sure they are just talking about serious disease.
18382,Seems the mRNA vaccines antibodies are waiting over time in most studies.
18383,How much antibodies play a role in preventing symptomatic infection vs the memory B and T cells is still not super clear to me.
18384,In one case we see the reports (not scientific) out of Israel pointing to the waiting antibodies leading to more symptomatic cases.
18385,On the other side of the coin the trials for Pfizer showed that people were having preventative responses towards infection even with very low antibody responses pointing to B and T cells offering at least some level of near sterilizing immunity.
18386,I‚Äôm Moderna vaccinated but don‚Äôt have much confidence that their vaccine is going to be any different then Pfizer as far as waining immunity from infection.
18387,Both vaccines still seem awesome for preventing the worst effects of the disease.

18422,Looking at excess mortality figures gets rid of all the noise about what a death is attributed to.
18423,And excess mortality has been very high since COVID started.
18424,I wonder how much dose plays an effect.
18425,Pfizer went for a much smaller dose than Moderna.
18426,Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if it turns out that depending on age or weight the Pfizer dose should have been higher.
18427,People really underestimate the effects of exponential growth.
18428, They just announced the need for a third shot before winter surges too.
18429,[removed]
18430,So essentially this is based on wild strain and Alpha variant; which would explain the really high numbers.

18436,There is only High Risk and Low Risk people.
18437,There is no such thing as non-risk.
18438,"I think one aspect that's throwing a wrench into this is the fact that the AZ vaccine is not approved for EUA in the US, so they are probably thinking through a strategy to require vaccinations in order to forego quarantine in a way that allows for those with AZ to also count."
18439,If only there were some measures that could stop the spread?
18440,"Oh well, back to crowded parties until God sorts this out for us."
18441,Louisiana has been BEGGING people to get a shot for months.
18442,The convention center in New Orleans is a big vax site.
18443,Ain't nobody there.
18444,People not getting vaccinated and not wearing masks is what's making the Delta variant spread like wildfire
18445,around the corner...
18446,It probably already mutated and just hasn't spread yet from the remote location.
18447,"Even at current vax %, there is probably a lot of mutations that have been kept isolated."
18448,That's the whole point of herd immunity is to prevent the spread among the unvaxxed.
18449,Like the wild fires going on right now.
18450,Once it starts to spread its almost impossible to stop it.

18458,I get my flu shot every year too.
18459,The 93% figure is sort of meaningless though; because we don't know if they're referring to any form of infection or just severe disease.
18460,Plus the data is not peer-reviewed and was gathered by the manufacturer.
18461,"Moderna's vaccine also hasn't really seen any long-term use outside of the US, so Delta may be under-represented or largely absent."
18462,"At the end of the day, the good news is that the vaccine mostly holds up but don't expect it to somehow be significantly more effective that Pfizer-BNT."
18463,"1) CDC has a program to screen HCPs

2) Some places do a weekly screening test - and I know of at least one asymptomatic case that got picked up personally."

18525,Usually athe nurses have like 6 or 8 patients to care for.
18526,Which I'm sure adds to the shortage.
18527,Well no - we need to look at the international data.
18528,And this would paint a very different picture.
18529,Vaccine is only 39% effective vs Delta.
18530,I too live in Japan and tour comment sums up my thoughts on the pandemic in Japan.
18531,"I agree that the Olympics isn‚Äôt mainly to blame for the spread of infection, barring the cases among volunteers and drivers that work for the games, and the psychological effect on people‚Äôs carefulness toward anti-infection measures (which is admittedly hard to gauge)."
18532,"However, I feel like the Olympics is a major reason the government has refrained from implementing large-scale policies that contradicts with holding a gigantic international event."
18533,"For example, during the last state of emergency, movie theaters and large bookstores were asked to not open."
18534,"The efficacy of that policy during the last SOE was a bit suspicious, but now with the highly infectious delta variant, such policies would mean something."
18535,"But as you know, none of those policies expect for the ban on alcohol are happening right now."
18536,There is no reason other than the Olympics (I can think of) that‚Äôs stopping the government from implementing such policies.
18537,Ditto on the CDC‚Äôs so-called messaging problem.
18538,"I was listening to an American podcast and agreed with the expert featured on points such as that they tend to leave out children, who are non-vaccinated population, out of the discussion."
18539,"But compared to the Japanese government, who was saying stuff like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve vaccinated the elderly population, we‚Äôll be fine‚Äù just a week or two ago, that level of miscommunication looks almost trivial."
18540,Considering the WHO lied over and over in the first few months of covid I'm not surprised places are ignoring everything they have to say.
18541,Lied about it being transmissive human to human at first then transmissive through aerosols being the biggest that lead to countries being lax in quarantine type measures; ultimately leading to first waves that could've been prevented.

18554,"Every doctor in my family is burnt out, and you can see it in their face."
18555,"Their tempers are shorter, just tired of it all."
18556,"This is good news, but we have to remember that Moderna has been used almost exclusively in the United States, countries such as Canada and nations that received donations only started to use this vaccine in large numbers recently."
18557,So it'll remain to be seen how effective their shot proves to be now that Delta is the dominant strain.
18558,"Overall it's looking like this vaccine is quite good; it'll just remain to be seen how big a gap it has from Pfizer, if any once we get more direct comparisons."
18559,"Cool well there‚Äôs a very large ‚Äúcivilized country‚Äù - the one this article is about - that doesn‚Äôt do that, so the point is kinda moot - there is no reliable data for breakthrough cases in the US."

18561,We live in the bay area as opposed to southern California and have a business based around people coming in having a drink and participating in an instructor-led activity.
18562,Vaccination rate is high in our county but people come from all over the bay area and even the central valley at times and it is already anxiety-inducing to ask that people keep their masks on unless they are taking a drink.
18563,"Most people comply, some don't."
18564,I couldn't imagine the shit show of potentially irate unvaccinated people being told to show their vax status or leave.
18565,"Not to mention that whole the California department of public health has a system to generate/provide your digital vaccination record, what system is going to be provided to merchants for verifying?"

18655,Unvaccinated people roam freely in the country without any fear or guilt and foreigners are mandated to get vaccines to enter.
18656,Anyway this is better than banning whole countries.

18679,"This comes back to the point about society expecting health care workers to always show up to serve them, even offer themselves up as sacrificial lambs, when necessary."

18693,I mean I thought at this point everyone agreed that we can't compare covid with the flu.
18694,"Still people compare it with the flu, alright."
18695,"Sure, but I can't imagine how it feels now knowing there's a thing that would prevent 95% of these patients from showing up and they're electing not to do it."

18745,No shit.

18749,If I have to help take care of my mom who first tested positive around 18 days ago and no longer has a fever but has other symptoms do I need to quarantine for 14 days afterword and miss work?
18750,I really dont think its an option to not help my sister take care of her but I also dont think I can afford missing 2 weeks of work.
18751,Im pretty lost here and have no clue what I can do about this
18752,I think you might need to be firing a gun into the air as well since it is Texas we are talking about.
18753,This is also why the extrapolation in the CDC report that infected vaccinated people ‚Äúmay be just as likely to spread Covid‚Äù as infected unvaccinated people is bad science.

18757,Gottlieb is citing a SIR model that hasn't been updated since 4/14 and does not include impacts of vaccines or reinfections for Delta variant.
18758,Their method is based on a non-peer reviewed approach.
18759,"Their confidence bounds on ""percent ever infected"" which is the ""R/Recovered"" in the SIR model used to estimate Rt are all out of wack, showing 47% +/- 10% for Arkansas, 59.8% +/- 0% for Arizona, and a whopping 94% of Delaware being infected previously with 40% of that happening over the past week."
18760,"A quick glance at the site/data at all shows it has obvious issues, is unmaintained, and shouldn't be trusted from data quality alone (and lack of confidence bounds on FL for example), yet he is citing that."

18776,Yikes!
18777,I have only seen a handful of people wearing masks in the last week.
18778,I would guess I saw over 100 people in that time frame.
18779,I would guess less than 10% are wearing masks from what I have witnesses.
18780,I kind of feel a bond when I see another  mask wearer.
18781,"I try to give the ""nod of approval and thanks"" when I can."
18782,But the social pressure to not wear a mask is strong.
18783,"90+% maskless people,  some giving you the ""evil eye"" for wearing a mask."
18784,"It makes me uncomfortable sometimes,  but not as uncomfortable as the ventilator they will be on!"
18785,VERY little social distancing.
18786,"Less than 50% are vaccinated here,   and most of those are not wearing masks."
18787,None of the unvaccinated people have masks.
18788,This breaks my heart.
18789,"I work with people overseas (Philippines, England, Denmark, etc.)"
18790,They tell me how they are *hopeful* that they will be able to get their first shot in the coming weeks.
18791,"Meanwhile, the US, selfish assholes that we are, have had the vaccine available for anyone that wants it for a long time."
18792,My 16 year old received her second shot 6 weeks ago.
18793,There is literally no reason for anyone in the US not to be vaccinated at this point (extenuating health complications aside).

18813,Icu beds.
18814,Still have other beds.
18815,But yeah.
18816,That's bad
18817,&gt;I honestly don't think mask wearing is going to completely stop the spread of the delta variant in a public school setting unless everyone is wearing a properly fitted N 95.
18818,We put our son in the summer program that is conducted at our elementary school premesis.
18819,We kept him virtual all last year.
18820,"He needed to interact with other kids, zoom meetings weren't enough, and both of us parents have to work."
18821,"3 weeks into the summer program, he had a horribly stuffy sinus, nasal drip, sore throat, horrible headache."
18822,We had him tested for COVID-19 and it was negative.
18823,He got better after about a week.
18824,There was a cold going around the classroom.
18825,"It's disconcerting to experience how the precautions that we say we (they) are taking for COVID-19 in the schools and program that should also work for other things like the common cold, only to realize how poorly they are working in his program."
18826,Kids don't wear their masks properly.
18827,Many kids constantly pull theirs down.
18828,One kid was caught pulling his down and blowing raspberries at other kids.
18829,"They are not cognizant of their fingers, mouths, noses, eyes."
18830,Distancing is not really enforced.
18831,"We have moved to kids kn95 masks for our son, but it's only as effective as how well it's fitted and how responsible he is about keeping it on and not rubbing his hands all over his face."
18832,"Anything to give a little extra protection wherever possible is good, kn95 etc., but I feel like it's a losing battle."
18833,"We live in a fairly high vaccination area, and I think, delta aside, our kids are being saved by the fact that vaccination rates are high and generally, cases are low and community transmission is low."
18834,That's changed with the delta variant recently.
18835,But parents need to work.
18836,The aren't alternatives.
18837,"We're lucky to live in a place that has responded well to the pandemic, I can't imagine being in another area that is anti-precaution."
18838,Are you comparing yourself to Dexter or your son?
18839,"It's just like the flu shot, and shit is trash to."
18840,It does not prevent you from getting it.
18841,Not sure why this is being downvoted.
18842,It's probably spot on.
18843,can you stress the importance of mask wearing at all times?
18844,or are the teachers and admin going to punish them...?
18845,Ugh I understand both sides.
18846,We are flying domestically next week (all vaccinated) and I sort of thought about testing before.
18847,But I don‚Äôt think we will because I know it‚Äôd be devastating if we tested positive.
18848,We‚Äôre just going to go by what the CDC says‚Ä¶if we‚Äôre showing symptoms we would for sure get tested (and cancel if so).
18849,And we‚Äôd test if we were in contact with someone who tested positive.
18850,Otherwise I feel like we just need to live.
18851,hey man thanks for what you do.
18852,"I'm not the healthiest eater so appreciate that doctors are still willing to take care of me...

but something that will remove a couple of years at the end of my life in no way compares to ignoring measures to stop a global pandemic that can kill you now or have life long side effects."
18853,further its something completely overwhelming hospitals across the nation.
18854,when was the last time multiple hospitals across multiple cities across multiple states in multiple countries were overwhelmed by heart attacks?
18855,oh and not to mention that those heart attacks arent contagious amd dont perpetuate a disease into a community and the people caring for them

18857,"This is a great post, very much appreciated."
18858,However I have a unique question.
18859,I myself am fully vaccinated.
18860,However I have a friend that hasn't been vaccinated yet and seems to be on the fence.
18861,"He caught covid some time ago and had mild symptoms, so perhaps that's one reason they're hesitant (although I told him antibodies don't last forever.)"
18862,"They're not totally anti vax, micro chip 5g magnet conspiracy believing but just a bit concerned."
18863,Then I see a story about UFC fighter Michael Chandler who said he won't be vaccinated in time for a Nov fight not because he's anti vax but because he's waiting for FDA approval.
18864,I'm wondering if that's also something that's concerning my friend.
18865,So my question is what official information can I give to say that the vaccines are safe and effective?
18866,"I know that the FDA DID approve for emergency use, and that these vaccines did go through rigorous clinical trials and came back with good results (I remember reading those articles last November with a smile.)"
18867,But what other info can I use?
18868,"Like I said he's not anti vax but did share a ""you are the experiment"" meme so theres a little of that."
18869,I hope I worded this question right.
18870,"Nope, I'm vaccinated but my kids under 12 can't yet."
18871,Not going to back to a mask until it's a law again.
18872,"Already had covid, now I'm vaxxed, time to go back to normal."
18873,Anyone unvaxxed and complaining about people wearing masks can get the heck outta here.
18874,you are trying your best.

18880,"And so you keep moving the goalposts, because you don't have any consistent principles (heck, if you don't think any government agency should be making decisions in the name of health, then you also shouldn't care about FDA approval, since that's a government agency that makes decisions in the name of health."

18883,"The illness my partner and I had was unlike anything else we've had, except for the symptoms of the vaccine we received (J&amp;J)."
18884,"We both had stomach issues for a day or so, and then I had an acute flu-like illness (fever/chills, aches, strong fatigue, headache) that lasted only one evening; she was just tired."
18885,That was the Friday before last.
18886,"We woke up Saturday both feeling fine, but very fatigued."

18906,"Suppose you live in a city with 100,000 people."
18907,"In this city, 400 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19 ‚Äî 200 of whom are vaccinated, 200 of whom are not."
18908,Let‚Äôs also suppose that the nationwide vaccination rate is 60%.
18909,These researchers saw that nationwide vaccination rate and assumed it held true for your city.
18910,"So they estimate that there are 60K vaccinated people and 40K unvaccinated people, meaning that 1/300 of the vaccinated people were hospitalized and 1/200 unvaccinated people were hospitalized."
18911,"Based on that estimation, they said that the vaccine only reduces your chance of hospitalization by 33%."
18912,"(Again, fake numbers here, and I‚Äôm oversimplifying a bit, but honestly not much.)"
18913,"The problem is that their first assumption was wrong ‚Äî these were highly vaccinated regions, so it‚Äôs more like there‚Äôs 95k vaccinated people and 5k unvaccinated people."
18914,"Now, this would suggest a 1/475 and 1/25 hospitalization risk, respectively."
18915,That‚Äôs more like a 95% reduction in the likelihood that a vaccinated person would be hospitalized.
18916,"That‚Äôs essentially the error they made here ‚Äî they assumed that local vaccination rate was roughly equal to national vaccination rate when it was, in fact, much higher."
18917,I appreciate you.
18918,Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done.
18919,But people have attempted to use that (anecdotal) fact as a reason to reject the vaccine.
18920,It isn't 100% effective therefore should not be taken.
18921,"It makes no sense, but there are people who believe this."

18935,Lol.
18936,I don't understand where you're saying the line should be drawn.
18937,Or why it's this difficult to draw a line for you?
18938,Just make sure you draw it somewhere that includes coronavirus and you can totally keep saying covid vaccines should be mandatory without contradicting yourself.
18939,It's not a trick question.
18940,I just want to know if you can draw a line of when they should have the authority to make laws/mandates.
18941,"Is it just ""if MedicineNet refers to it as a pandemic""?"
18942,I'm lost.
18943,"Another way of putting this:

The spike binder protein on COVID is a 'key' that fits into a lock in your body."
18944,It's what lets COVID into your cells.
18945,We have trained our bodies to recognize these keys using the vaccine.
18946,"In this scheme, a mutation might make a variant of the key that your body does not recognize."
18947,"However, *this key still needs to open that same lock*."
18948,"So it can only change a little bit, otherwise, the key wouldn't fit the lock anymore."
18949,"This also means that there is a limit on how much it can change the key, so it can't mutate the spike binder indefinitely and still have it work."
18950,I know.

19254,"We haven‚Äôt had such a widespread vaccine mandate recently but we‚Äôre in the worst pandemic experienced in the last 100 years, and that pandemic had no vaccine available to mandate."
19255,"Oh, and restaurants can get fined or shut down if their employees don‚Äôt wash their hands because handwashing prevents contagious disease outbreaks."

19265,"Natural immunity may be as strong as the vaccine: https://mobile.twitter.com/_stah/status/1407335460213596167


I wouldn't share that with them though and still encourage them to get the vaccine"
19266,Would be nice if our entire citizenry were vaccinated but that is wishful thinking.
19267,The amount of people that are unwilling to get vaccinated because they believe in some bizarre conspiracy theory is fucking insane.
19268,Not... really no.
19269,I just think you have some misunderstandings about how statistics work.
19270,You can have very high confidence of a range of very very small (but precise) small numbers without any issue at all.
19271,A 99% confidence interval saying something is between 48 and 50 is no less firm as a 99% confidence interval saying something is between .00000013 and .00000015.
19272,"If you don't know that Texas, Florida and Missori make up 40% of all covid cases then you've been living under a rock."
19273,"Sooo‚Ä¶.we‚Äôre all just fucked, right?"
19274,"Covid is going to be endemic, we‚Äôre not going to be able to eradicate it, nor should we try at this point."
19275,The social cost would be far too high and the likelihood far too low.
19276,Vaccines were always the endgame.
19277,"Was on a trip 2 weekends ago and 3 of the guys I was with came back positive, all were vaccinated.. their symptoms are not present and are feeling completely fine.. and that was after a heavy binder of a weekend"
19278,I‚Äôve looked at a couple.

19283,"I read an article earlier that even when most kids go to the ER, their cases are so mild that they end up just recovering at home."
19284,I know that in May the numbers regarding the hospitalization of children were naturally inflated.
19285,"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/21/999241558/in-kids-the-risk-of-covid-19-and-the-flu-are-similar-but-the-risk-perception-isn

&gt;To date, out of more than 74 million children in the United States, there have been about 300 COVID deaths and a few thousand serious illnesses."
19286,"Hospitalization numbers look worse, but Dr. Roshni Mathew at Stanford's Children's Hospital says those numbers are inflated."
19287,"&gt;ROSHNI MATHEW: All hospitals, as the child walks into the hospital for admission, get swabbed for COVID."
19288,"&gt;HARRIS: But in her hospital's experience, nearly half of those children with positive COVID tests were not actually sick with COVID."
19289,"And in this article about children fighting for their lives, published today, they still say that the kids coming into the emergency room have mostly mild cases and are sent home to recover."

&gt;She said it‚Äôs too early to tell for certain if the delta variant is making kids more sick."
19291,"While she is seeing more children being admitted, that may be because more kids are getting infected, she said."
19292,Most children coming to the emergency department end up having mild enough symptoms to recover at home.
19293,"Full disclosure, in the next paragraph the doctor predicts it might change in the future, but I wanted to highlight what is happening now."
19294,"It isn‚Äôt, actually."
19295,People are still catching COVID despite vaccinations (not extremely likely but it‚Äôs happening) and we‚Äôre all not fully safe til it‚Äôs all gone.
19296,Because people didn‚Äôt willingly cooperate we now have worse things.
19297,It really requires everyone to go a little above and beyond to get through this.

19310,"Fuck around and find out, y‚Äôall!"
19311,I'm not against vaccines lol.
19312,I'm against mandates without any checks and balances in line.
19313,I'm willing to say there's scenarios when vaccines should be mandatory.
19314,I'm just also saying that we should agree on a specific set of numbers and stipulations about the disease that would qualify a vaccine as mandatory.
19315,Why does that upset you?
19316,Does anyone remember Trump and the CDC (or maybe some other approval body ?)
19317,changing the guidelines to incentivize faster vaccines into the arms of the public ?
19318,Any clarity on that
19319,A large portion of this website are also people in their 20s and 30s too.
19320,And that means we shouldn‚Äôt care about Alzheimer‚Äôs?
19321,I‚Äôve witnessed the disease firsthand.
19322,"I know this is sort of cliche, but I‚Äôd rather die than go through that and put others through that."
19323,By the end you‚Äôre barely even human anymore.
19324,The disease strips everything from you.
19325,It‚Äôs horrible.
19326,I wonder why you're getting downvoted.
19327,I thought they locked people in their homes (locked in from the outside) to stop the spread.
19328,Oh my god.
19329,I am hoping against hope that there will be a slowdown in cases.
19330,"Honestly, it seems unlikely."
19331,Can someone from AR or MS say what its like?
19332,Are folks taking it seriously?
19333,Like mask wearing?
19334,A neighbor said maybe 5 to 10 % are wearing masks in big box stores.
19335,The real world is going to be tough for you if wearing a mask is such a big deal.
19336,Best of luck.
19337,Don't even need that.
19338,Even a Basic level EMT is enough for the vaccine observation (even that might be overkill).
19339,"As far as I know none of the adverse reactions were near-term deadly, so as long as it wasn't an odd allergic reaction you could survive until an ambulance arrives to get you to the hospital."
19340,Kind of a combo of things.
19341,"The gov't was very clear about timelines for when vaccines would get here and they were pretty on the money (actually they predicted they'd come a bit late, but that's just because they were being cautious)."
19342,One problem is that we don't really have domestic manufacturing.
19343,"The US has a lot of course but was not exporting any vaccines for a number of months, even ones that they were not using (including but not limited to AstraZeneca)."
19344,The bigger thing was the purchase agreements.
19345,A bunch of countries bought vaccines from various manufacturers.
19346,Here in Canada most of the vaccines that got here earlier on were Pfizer and AZ.
19347,"However with Pfizer specifically I think, Canada bought a big block of vaccines for delivery in a certain quarter."
19348,"What happened however was that Pfizer was having supply problems and had to delay a lot of shipments, and what ended up happening was that they had OTHER agreements for smaller shipments that they fulfilled first because they had a tighter deadline (instead of say Q1 they were for February)."
19349,"So basically, Canada ended up getting its entire order right at the end of the quarter all at once in that case."
19350,"Then we started getting supply, but it was tight for a bit and like in the UK we had to slowly open to new age groups."
19351,Eventually they opened up to everybody 12-40 here in Ontario and it was kind of a big shitshow because like half the province was trying to book appointments at once.
19352,"Eventually we started getting large deliveries of Pfizer and Moderna, and we stopped using AZ because a) minor issues that were causing more major issues with vaccine hesitancy and b) we just ran out of supply of it I think."
19353,"Canada also made big purchases from other vaccine manufacturers that are still working on trials, not sure what the UK did."
19354,Novavax was a big one -- I think Canada ordered 75 million shots from Novavax alone.
19355,"I think Canada actually purchased more vaccines per capita than any country in the world, but not all of them have been delivered and some of course may never be approved/delivered."
19356,"You didn't answer the question; what do you believe the ""process of typical law making"" is for laws that will apply specifically to the city of Los Angeles?"
19357,"You said things need to go through that process, so what is it?"
19358,Hmm.
19359,I'll have to listen.
19360,The idea that covid will come in waves may be true.
19361,But the size/poor outcomes will absolutely go down and there is no plausible biological mechanism for them to not.
19362,If we're lucky.
19363,That‚Äôs right.
19364,I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs impossible for NYC to see anything remotely close to the upticks in the south.

19373,"We have failed you, my friend."
19374,Today is dark.
19375,It does not do reality justice to deny that.
19376,"But in these black nights the worst is revealed, weaknesses we could not be aware of before."
19377,"If we are aware, we can reflect."
19378,"If we can reflect we can formulate solutions, and from those solutions we must act."
19379,We must not allow our posterity to suffer the same fate.
19380,I wish for no more than to comfort you.
19381,If you are legitimately doing your best with the tools provided to you then we can ask no more.
19382,Thank you for what you are doing.
19383,You have not failed us.
19384,You're the one of the few parts of the system that hasn't.
19385,"Hey, can you explain why every anti-vaxxing Reddit account is also tied to either knives subreddits, guns subreddits, or e-trading/Bitcoin?"
19386,Are you in the U.S.?
19387,"Opioids are addictive, once you are addicted your brain and body are no longer ""under your control"" in a sense."
19388,It is not even *remotely* similar to a person of sound body and mind refusing a vaccine for idiotic and selfish purposes.
19389,Try again.
19390,"Vaccines work well but given the R0 of delta and the current unvaccinated population, it will mutate again and escape vaccine immunity, so the next variant may be alot worse, like how the  variance of flu can lead to a very bad flu season."
19391,We will have a very bad covid variant soon.
19392,Live your life to the fullest.
19393,Did you know back in the early 1900s someone actually went door to door in Boston for the smallpox vaccine?
19394,Don‚Äôt pretend this is new.
19395,"Also, Boston had since had no further outbreaks."
19396,Almost like science works.
19397,"If it‚Äôs any consolation to you, and maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äî you can‚Äôt do what you can‚Äôt do."
19398,Has anyone here experienced breakthrough infection with the delta varian even though you‚Äôre vaccinated?
19399,What‚Äôs your experience like?
19400,How many days were you sick/did you test positive for?
19401,"It's a 1 in 500,000 chance in women:

19402,Funny how the laws we have that are good for society prevent a strong response to Covid.
19403,"My lawyer friend and I were discussing the vaccines the other day, and we realized the US could create a federal vaccine mandate, but it would come at the cost of the right to privacy and abortion."
19404,You‚Äôd find support in quite a few interesting places for that.
19405,"Can anyone finish this sentence with basic, general population statistics (I know there is a lot of variables but looking for basic info):

""People previously infected with covid (og variant) are __?__ times more likely to catch delta than a fully vaccinated individual."""
19406,I have some co-workers finally starting to think about getting the shot.
19407,We work in up close &amp; personal retail.
19408,In Louisiana.
19409,The entire store tested positive in December aside from the 2 of us on vacation that week (best timed vacation ever!)
19410,There are only 2 of us of 11 who have had shots.
19411,They are almost ready...I just want to help push them along.
19412,They think their past infection is protecting them similar to the shot.
19413,It's scary here guys....
19414,You have to do per capita.
19415,You literally just listed high population states.
19416,That won't tell you anything.
19417,I think the standard of ‚Äúuntil we know it doesn‚Äôt lead to a rapid and significant drop below baseline in the short term that fails to resolve‚Äù is different than ‚Äúuntil every conceivable negative is proven.‚Äù
19418,My understanding is that the UK is also a bit better off because of the delay in getting their second shots....turns out that creates a better immune response compared to getting a second shot three or so weeks after the first.
19419,This doesn‚Äôt make sense
19420,A federal mandate in what way?
19421,You can't force your average person to get vaccinated but you can and should make it a condition of employment.
19422,"You aren‚Äôt talking to a Russian, but you did just prove you have a selfish mentality."
19423,I don‚Äôt care about you.
19424,It‚Äôs not about you.
19425,"It‚Äôs about everyone doing their part to protect the community and others, especially those who can‚Äôt currently get vaccinated."
19426,"It‚Äôs not that hard, but apparently it is for people like you"
19427,What you do is you take # vacciNated deaths / vaccinated population and compare that to non vaccinated deaths / nonvaccinated population.
19428,This means that non-vaccinated individuals are 5 times more likely to die from COVID.
19429,They could have just looked at how those counties vote.
19430,In that case I'd imagine the VA has a record and could communicate that information.
19431,"I'm spitballing here, floating a crazy idea that will never be a reality."
19432,We all turn 60 someday.
19433,Are you in the USA?
19434,"If you were in a trial, there is no record of your vaccine - go get a shot at a pharmacy."
19435,Ah.
19436,I wasn't suggesting to ignore medical advice.
19437,"However, there are disagreements in the medical field and if a second expert tells you the same as the first, it's probably best to just trust the experts."
19438,That's all I was trying to imply with my comment but I'm a dumbass for implying instead of explicitly saying.
19439,"I have a nephew, in college now that as an infant spent 8 months in icu because somebody didn‚Äôt want to vaccinate their kids and my nephew caught whooping cough."
19440,His father is extremely anti-COVID vaccine.
19441,"He‚Äôs my brother in law, and him and all of his brothers are all anti-vax."
19442,On top of that his brothers are all successful doctors &amp; one of them writes in conservative medical journals and goes on conservative tv to talk about how you just need to take your vitamins and other BS.
19443,"Meanwhile his son, daughters and my sister are all fed up with him because this same crap almost killed one of his kids."
19444,What test was it?
19445,I googled it and it says the FFA doesn't reccomended testing for antibodies but there are two different tests?
19446,It would be so slow haha.
19447,"I think GP surgeries have been in charge of organising when their patients can get it from the volunteer centres though, because you get a text from them saying you‚Äôre allowed to book a jab at x y or z now."
19448,So I think they‚Äôre probably pre warning people who shouldn‚Äôt have it?
19449,"Haven‚Äôt given it much thought but you are right, it seems like a good idea to at least have a professional have a quick glance at your suitability"
19450,It was more the admission that our mitigation tactics are fairly worthless against COVID waves at this point.
19451,This is especially amusing when you remember that Florida has no southern border.
19452,So people entering in Texas or Arizona or whatever are magically contributing to COVID cases in Florida.
19453,"Here's Florida's daily new cases graph from worldometers:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/florida/#graph-cases-daily

I think it's too early to say we're near the peak."
19454,I hope Florida is ready for some record breaking numbers.

19456,When I say making laws in the name of health.
19457,Im referring to using health as a trump card to bypass current/old laws.
19458,"In other words there was no law before saying ""you're allowed to drive drunk""."
19459,So a drunk driving law didn't infringe on any rights.
19460,However there are laws that say private owned businesses can determine who they serve and other laws that prevent blatant prejudice.
19461,And putting a mandate on vaccine identification affects both of those pre existing constitutional rights.
19462,That to me instantly makes it a primary target for corruption.
19463,Assuming they lean left OR right.
19464,All the sudden you have a body which can bypass a constitution.
19465,And if you're going to let a body decide that.
19466,You better draw some very specific lines.
19467,Again I'm not saying you shouldn't be allowed to enact mandates in the name of health/crises.
19468,"But I am saying if we are going to allow it, there needs to be very specific rules on when it can be done."
19469,And by that I mean specific numbers we agree to.
19470,"Anyone who finds putting regulations like that in place or finds tying numbers to power unnecessary hasn't thought it through, or they're the ones who want the body in charge to have the right to pass laws unchecked."
19471,Which is concerning.
19472,"For the Pfizer vaccine, the hospitalization rate for the base strain approaches zero."
19473,Breakthrough rate is 0.004% after the standard two round vaccination according to the CDC and other sources.
19474,"If you are willing to be slightly less scientific and precise about it and willing to rule out certain confounding variables, you can anecdotally say that the vaccine works and the breakthrough rate for an individual without special risk factors or other complications is pretty much zero."
19475,"I'm sure there will be cases, especially if we take a close look at certain super spreader events in places where delta is prevalent."
19476,"Be vaccinated, wear a mask, avoid putting your face close to an infected otherbody, wash your hands, and don't be in the mosh pit at fucking lollapalooza for crying out loud, and you're *highly* unlikely to end up in the hospital."
19477,"I give myself insulin every day, it's not that hard."
19478,Have one doc around for every 10 or 20 trained techs giving shots.
19479,I don't have a problem with it.
19480,"Neither necessary nor appropriate, and I say that as someone who would support most forms of government intervention to assist with the pandemic, including making vaccines mandatory for everyone."
19481,"&gt;Kids barely even get sick though, if at all."
19482,This is well known at this point.
19483,no?
19484,Don‚Äôt you remember having to get certain vaccines before entering school?
19485,This isn‚Äôt new or unprecedented.
19486,"Are you talking about the annual personnel rotation in Darwin around February/March 2021, before the vaccine was rolled out to anyone that wants it?"
19487,Can‚Äôt vaccinate people if you don‚Äôt have the vaccines to give in that case.
19488,[removed]
19489,Because current measures that keep the numbers low are unsustainable for Singapore's economy in the long term.
19490,"The government is now pivoting it's strategy from keeping the virus out to coexisting with the virus on the basis of testing, tracing and vaccinating the population."
19491,The risk of long term effects are far less than the risk of suffering from covid.
19492,Why don't you have issues with that?
19493,I‚Äôm also going to go on a limb &amp; say the vaccination rate of Sturgis attendees is significantly lower than your average sporting event or music festival...

19501,"It does, but that‚Äôs cuz it‚Äôs a bigger shot"
19502,Nice reading comprehension.
19503,My point was that the logic underlying the statistic in the sub title leads to stupid conclusions such as: the fact that 99.9% of Americans didn't die of Covid-19 means Covid-19 is not a big deal.
19504,That is a stupid conclusion that is drawn based on an actual factual statistic that in and of itself is highly misleading: deaths/population.
19505,I used it as an example to show that deaths/population is an extremely irresponsible statistic to report in either direction without adequate context.
19506,"BTW, I am vaccinated, and I booked my appointments as soon as I was eligible."
19507,"I want to know a lot more about these breakthrough cases so I can better understand what the actual level of risk that my parents and loved ones, and myself might be facing going forward."
19508,"Relying on bullshit, irresponsible figures based on deaths/population is not a credible way to provide facts to people that want to understand their current risks even when vaccinated."
19509,"It is reckless and irresponsible to hide the risks behind a statistic like that, the same way that its reckless and irresponsible to spread anti-vax sentiment by pointing to the fact that 99.9% of Americans did not die of Covid-19 in 2020."
19510,Calling a scientist doing research a quack is name calling and by definition trolling.
19511,The polarization and attacks have to stop‚Ä¶.
19512,"They think for themselves, just as long as it's what everyone else around them thinks."
19513,Nah.
19514,"The misinformation is out there for all of us, it‚Äôs up to you to use your head and avoid it."
19515,"If you‚Äôre anti vaccine in 2021, that‚Äôs fully on you."
19516,Do you deserve to die?
19517,"No, probably not."
19518,"But you deserve the full consequences of your bad decisions, just like everyone else."

19539,"Yeah, but antibodies are supposed to go away to begin with, they exist and then they are meant to disappear, having them stick around is bad, as long as the body can recognize the disease and make new antibodies is what matters."
19540,Which I still does effectively.
19541,"Hey, so sorry about your dad."
19542,I think incubation period is a bit up in the air.
19543,Is your father vaccinated?
19544,"If you‚Äôre both vaccinated, and you both wear masks, I think the risk is somewhat minimized."
19545,Do other people in your workplace wear masks?
19546,Are they mostly vaccinated?
19547,"Those are the two questions I‚Äôd be most interested in, since that would affect your odds of having covid."
19548,"Not a doctor or healthcare worker, just someone who reads the news a lot."
19549,Is this from something they released a while ago?
19550,"It looks familiar so I‚Äôm assuming so, but if there‚Äôs supplementary info from their press release today I‚Äôd love a link."
19551,I think there's just more solid evidence now.
19552,"Before it was expected to last months, now they can definitely day that it does..."
19553,The vaccine just isn't that old and there will be new milestones every few months.
19554,"Also the bigger issue is that if you are too poor to afford to get a free vaccine, you definitely can‚Äôt afford getting COVID and being out of work for a while."
19555,There is increasing talk that long COVID is not directly caused by SARS-COV-2 infection but by the activation of the EBV.
19556,"So, actually long-COVID = mononucleosis

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oxn6xh/investigation\_of\_long\_covid\_prevalence\_and\_its/"
19557,Yearly shots like the flu vaccine is your answer.
19558,Right.
19559,"I mean, almost nobody has a perfect health details, whether it is obvious or not."
19560,Get vaccinated.
19561,This is such a one dimensional view and it‚Äôs honestly appalling.
19562,"It doesn‚Äôt take someone being mentally ill to justify Desantis‚Äôs actions, and the notion of such is so offensive and unproductive it‚Äôs hardly worth responding to."
19563,"If you can‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind Desantis‚Äôs policy choices, and why it makes sense for some to cheer them on, thats on you."
19564,Not hate.
19565,They're basically the same thing.
19566,Yes thats a better worded way to put it than my attempt.
19567,Im no scientist but had read a lot of conflicting articles on the matter and nothing seems conclusive.
19568,These articles are misleading and should be deleted imo
19569,We‚Äôve done everything possible to encourage people to get  vaccinated here.
19570,No amount of convincing is going to do anything for the anti maskers.
19571,So our focus should shift to preventing variants in the first place which means focusing on low income high population areas outside of the US.
19572,&gt;	1.
19573,"Vaccines might not be given in areas where poor people live - e.g., if the regional vaccine center is not accessible by public transport so that you need either a car, or a ridiculously long journey/walk to get there."
19574,You can walk into any CVS or Walgreens and get the vaccine.
19575,&gt;	2.
19576,Immigrant communities might consume media from their home country and not get the messaging that the vaccine is free and safe.
19577,"My parents only watch Tolo Tv which is an Afghan network and they have commercials talking about getting vaccinated or at least wearing a mask

&gt;	3."
19578,Poor people who work may not be able to get paid time off either to take the vaccine (if there is a fixed appointment system - and it may take them longer) or for the side effects.
19579,People who earn more tend to have more flexible employers.
19580,It takes minutes to walk in and get a vaccine.
19581,&gt;	4.
19582,"Some people are poor at least partly because they have issues with poor mental or physical health, meaning they lack the life skills either to get the vaccine or to demonstrate compliance later on."
19583,I doubt that‚Äôs the majority.
19584,&gt;	but you asked how a free vaccine can disproportionately affect the poor - and those are ways in which it can.
19585,It seems like you think a lot of the poor are lazy and/or stupid.
19586,[deleted]
19587,So I wanna give an auditor perspective before people run with some Earnings Release information.
19588,Literally any non-financial number on an earnings release for a quarter is at best unverifiable.
19589,Like the auditors review every financial number to make sure it ties to source data but don‚Äôt necessarily have to do the same for operating statistics or will tie it to very weak/unverifiable data schedules at best.
19590,Add to that this number seems to be picked from the slides of the Earnings Release presentation which in the vast majority of clients the auditors don‚Äôt even look at or if they do it‚Äôs a very cursory checks.
19591,"So this is literally just whatever Moderna says the vaccine performance is, on a nice chart, that some auditors may or may not have looked at and gone ok this doesn‚Äôt seem obviously wrong to us."
19592,There could be some really whacky things going on to get those numbers but the people who give the final approval on the slide deck aren‚Äôt gonna know that and be like hey this number is deceiving.
19593,So I would take this info with a major grain of salt until an actual study gets released backing it up.
19594,This give me hope.
19595,We can start pumping it into the air in Walmart and McDonald‚Äôs.
19596,Should have 100% vaccination within a week.
19597,[removed]
19598,Your statement has entirely nothing to do with what I was saying.
19599,The reddit post is stated as fact.
19600,The article suggests a hypothesis based on early studies.
19601,The title should reflect the content of the article.
19602,Not change it.
19603,[removed]
19604,The trend in cases is actually improving a bit in Louisiana.
19605,"The 7-day average is now 93, compared to 99 a few days ago."
19606,"And they're up only 21% over the past week, below the national average, while previously they were rising much more quickly."
19607,"I don't know how much of this is driven by policy, versus the virus running out of people to infect and people finally starting to take some individual precautions."
19608,"The statewide [indoor mask mandate](https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3301) was reinstated a few days ago, but I would have thought it would take some more time to see the effects of that."
19609,Scrutinizing data does not equal anti vaccine.
19610,Very similar to my experience.
19611,My first dose had no side effects other than mild injection-site soreness.
19612,I got my second dose at \~9am and felt unusually sleepy that evening around bedtime.
19613,"I went to sleep, slept very hard, and woke up the next morning feeling fine."
19614,"(I also had a sore arm with my second shot, but it was pretty much expected.)"
19615,and the disease *actually* damages you organs
19616,Thank you God I got this one.
19617,I don't want to die!

19621,You‚Äôre a god among men.
19622,I don‚Äôt know how you don‚Äôt quit.
19623,Depends on the state / district I‚Äôd imagine.
19624,In my case I am remaining hopeful on both fronts.
19625,"There are loads if you google it, but equal amounts that say it works wonders."
19626,"As with everything Covid, its hard to know whats accurate."
19627,"Thats why posts like this should largely be ignored, as there is no balance to them."
19628,In parts of Canada ICU nurses were leading teams that included doctors seconded from other disciplines.
19629,ICU care is so specialized that the nurses were teaching those doctors what to do.
19630,Those doctors were being paid doctor rates while their nursing leaders were getting nursing rates.
19631,Ugh.
19632,Where are you getting that one will be available for older kids by October?
19633,Last I saw was ‚Äúmaybe winter‚Äù for 5-11 year olds.
19634,I felt awful after my second one for about 2 days.
19635,"Don't know about worse, but it wasn't great."
19636,How is that not true?
19637,99% of the current cases in the US are among unvaccinated people.
19638,They are absolutely the reason these variants spread in the US.
19639,"But I agree, we need to do a LOT more to get people in other countries vaccinated as well."
19640,Kick the nonvaccinated out.
19641,I'm serious.
19642,They need to accept responsibility for their actions.
19643,I also think that we need legislation requiring vaccination if you want admission into a hospital.
19644,How is sitting indoor in Starbucks not indoor dinning?
19645,"Not to be mean but damn, I'm 57 and she looks like my mom."
19646,"Holy shit, she must have had a rough life."
19647,Sometimes we are our own worst enemies.
19648,A fatal mistake.
19649,"I don‚Äôt think anyone is prevented from getting the vaccine, but I have heard of people who may not benefit from it due to circumstances at the moment, but there is a better time for them to get the same vaccine (with no further data needed)."
19650,Even GBS is most often caused by a random virus or variant than the mRNA vaccines (no cases linked).
19651,We aren't sure.
19652,"With such a new virus, changes aren't well understood, though we have some ideas."
19653,"Changes in ORF 1 or ""non structural proteins"" are more likely to lead to a change in how well the virus can replicate in cells."
19654,Changes in E and M might lead to changes in how long the particles can last in the air.
19655,And we have been focusing on the spike protein at the expense of a focus on the others since the beginning.
19656,Delta has many mutations compared to the previous variants.
19657,Antivaxxer convention you say.
19658,How could this end well?
19659,"It's a mess in the SE, despite vaccines being widely available."
19660,"We went out to eat in New Orleans maybe ten days ago, the first time in many months."
19661,"We were still thinking cases were on the decline, there were no restrictions in place...still, the restaurant was at full capacity, and when the waitress showed up with no face covering I knew it was a mistake."
19662,"Previous times we went out were outside only, everyone covered their face...I am so annoyed at myself for going."
19663,"It's been about 9 or 10 days, and every morning I wake up wondering if my fatigue is from my poor sleep and busy schedule earlier this week, or if this is how a vax'd person fights off covid."
19664,"Like, wtf is so important that it couldn't be rescheduled?"
19665,Is this lady a cardiac surgeon?
19666,A key player in middle east peace talks?
19667,A hostage negotiator?
19668,"JFC I've had it with idiots putting this off because their cousins baby shower is that weekend and they ""can't find the time""."
19669,"It literally took me less than 30 minutes to get vaccinated, and that's counting the 15 minute observation period."
19670,I'm also down with the delta RN despite being fully vaccinated so I have no patience for idiots.
19671,"I can only speak for myself, I rarely get sick and the second shot kicked my ass"
19672,&gt;Just wear a mask with the ~~American flag~~ letter Q on it.
19673,FTFY.
19674,The one near me has indoor dining
19675,PURGE
19676,"I remember during the early days, April/May/June 2020 reading research on CBD on r/covid19 and there was discussion it would totally be embraced because of the stigma attached to it in America."
19677,Same with nicotine attaching to ACE2 inhibitors (not sure whatever happened to that one).
19678,Glad to see it resurface.
19679,It hasn‚Äôt been disproven.
19680,The evidence so far is not strong enough to confidently prove or disprove its benefit.
19681,Unvaccinated people should be the lowest priority.
19682,[removed]
19683,"How have I been the preferred supply for mosquitos and bugs of all kinds all my life without knowing this üò±

Googled and found many articles."
19684,Apparently research showed they prefer O blood group over A.
19685,The difference was not as much for other blood groups.
19686,"Just remember all life is precious in Mississippi, as long as the life hasn‚Äôt been born yet and really isn‚Äôt a life yet."
19687,"Wow, that's unreal."
19688,"Honest question: are there people in your life that still deny that COVID is a big deal, or feel it's some kind of hoax?"
19689,"Where I am the hospitals haven't been overwhelmed (yet - knock on wood) and our numbers haven't gone out of control, however there's a chunk of people who think that means COVID is being blown out of proportion."
19690,"I find it extremely frustrating, and I'm not even in healthcare or emergency management, bouncing between hospitals that are perpetually full."
19691,1.

19699,"Some people are poor at least partly because they have issues with poor mental or physical health, meaning they lack the life skills either to get the vaccine or to demonstrate compliance later on."
19700,"I'm not saying that these factors are all accurate in the US, and certainly not saying that they're insurmountable, but you asked how a free vaccine can disproportionately affect the poor - and those are ways in which it can."
19701,"Of course, if vaccine passes help reduce the incidence of COVID and return society to normality sooner, that *helps* poor people in the long run - so I'm not saying they're a bad thing, either."
19702,That's seems accurate lol
19703,"I mean, that‚Äôs just not true."
19704,India has 7.8% vaccinated.

19712,"I seriously sat there and said ""there is no way they mean it like this, I'm just misunderstanding like we are not just going to just..."
19713,"stop."""
19714,"I thought ""no that's fucking insane no way Kenny is going to just slaughter his own base like that haha"" fuck I was neive so I'm going to just prepare for the fucking thunder dome/ hunger game we are about to have."
19715,"Point the finger at everything except for the companies and people who ""donate"" money."
19716,Which really defeats the entire purpose of the statement.
19717,I‚Äôve never supported the variants argument with regard to vaccination because it‚Äôs basically bullshit.
19718,"Even if we vaccinated every single adult in America tomorrow, we would not gain that much protection against the possibility of an escape variant."
19719,"Anti vaxxers have perpetuated the virus in our country for months, that‚Äôs true."
19720,But did delta come from our piddling 20k cases a day this spring/summer?
19721,"No, it came from the 4 bajillion daily cases getting pumped out on the other side of the world."
19722,"The escape variant, if it ever comes, will be the same."
19723,We could hit zero daily cases in the continental United States and it wouldn‚Äôt change a damn thing in that regard.
19724,I just hope people aren't too stubborn to make hard decisions when the time comes.
19725,The lies!
19726,"Florida hospitals have an infinite number of beds, more than grains on a beach or stars in the universe, more than the number of IP addresses available in IPv6."
19727,/s
19728,That.. and also some facilities don‚Äôt want to transfers them to hospitals bc they get ding points or something which could jeopardize something.. at least according to the paramedics that told me
19729,There are a LOT of wait-and-see folk on top of the drongos holding out for Pfizer meant for younger people.
19730,There is ample AZ to vaccinate their entire cohort but they want the best.
19731,I don't blame them given the shitty messaging coming out of the federal gov but at the same time I cannot get behind their inability to see the big picture.
19732,It's a stupid question.
19733,What doesn't make sense about requiring students to be fully Vaccinated when grouping together from different parts of the world?
19734,No one who believes in the republican line of bs will be swayed by any amount of 'facts'.
19735,It would be nice if logic would work.
19736,I remember before we were married and arguing about health care and insurance.
19737,"Both not employer insured, we purchased private insurance at exorbitant rates before obamacare."
19738,"(Those rates sky rocketed after btw... What a mess that is)

But."
19739,My stance has been and will be: health care should not be a *for profit* business.
19740,The only way to make money is to deny people care they need.
19741,Please take care of your mental health!
19742,I really can‚Äôt imagine what you have to deal with every day!
19743,"the hospitals are already doing this, they're prioritizing unvaccinated people that ruined everything over people that did everything right and tried their best to help simply because the antivaxxers got in the door first."
19744,I think the ethics surrounding first-come first-served need to be reconsidered.
19745,There are only so many resources and frankly the antivaxxers should get theirs last.
19746,&gt; For example Starbucks will need to have a Barista standing at the door checking everyone cards.
19747,"My understanding is that this applies to indoor dining, so not really."
19748,No.
19749,Vaccines will continue to be necessary along non-pharmaceutical interventions.
19750,"However, despite of the above, severe covid will continue to exist and affordable, safe and effective treatments will still be necessary."
19751,I find however the dearth of possible home treatments for the early stages of the disease very troubling.
19752,Similarly promotion of the overall personal health should have been emphasized.

19777,It doesn't only affect them.
19778,I think living with COVID should mean something different when there's a surge versus when cases are low.

19795,It's because they couldn't be bothered.
19796,I could understand the early days of roll out when it was hard to schedule an appointment but vaccines are readily available and you could go to your local pharmacy and it takes about less than 30 minutes.
19797,"The same folks that can't be arsed to set up a time have no problem making plans to travel, go to sporting events, restaurants, bars etc etc."
19798,"I'm sure this question is controversial, but I'll ask anyway."
19799,This question is primarily for those working in the healthcare system.
19800,"If there is a scarcity of hospital resources for treating those who have Covid-19 and decided not to get vaccinated, can't they simply not treat those patients and prioritize treatment of patients who are vaccinated given there is a higher chance of success/survival?"
19801,I mean what would be the point of treating these patients if they knowingly made a decision that landed them in the hospital in the first place?
19802,"I heard last that there are only 6 beds left in the entire state of Mississippi and all it'll take is one more catastrophic event (car pile up, crashed building, etc.)"

19807,"MI got fucked in April when noone else was, and we're 60%ish vaccinated, which is good relative to these southern states, so I am staying optimistic things won't be so bad here in the next month, again at least comparitively."
19808,The built up immunity from those who got it in April surge will count for at least something (I know it's not nearly as good as a vaccine but it's still non-zero).
19809,&gt; Getting hospitalized with covid in the United States typically generates huge bills.
19810,"Those submitted by covid patients to the NPR-Kaiser Health News ‚ÄúBill of the Month‚Äù project include a $17,000 bill for a brief hospital stay in Marietta, Georgia (reduced to about $4,000 for an uninsured patient under a ‚Äúcharity care‚Äù policy); a $104,000 bill for a 14-day hospitalization in Miami for an uninsured man; and a bill for possibly hundreds of thousands for a two-week hospital stay ‚Äî some of it on a ventilator ‚Äî for a foreign tourist in Hawaii whose travel health insurance contained a ‚Äúpandemic exclusion.‚Äù

Anti-vaxxers are not thinking of the financial implications of their decisions."
19811,Insurance rates should not increase for everyone.
19812,They should punish those who refuse to care for their own health.
19813,that makes more sense.
19814,"Thank you for the rundown, It feels like they focus too much on the age in the news that they make it sound like just simply being that age is an inherent risk or something."
19815,Does anyone know if non-symptomatic when vaccinated can still damage your brain or heart?
19816,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about.
19817,Awful.
19818,I'm assuming that testing is not super accessible with a number like that.
19819,I think the CFR in Italy early on was over 12%.
19820,Things devolve very fast when the healthcare systems get overwhelmed.
19821,"You realize this isnt just about 'now', as much as it is about ""whats happens next""."
19822,I would argue the main reason we need to get this under control is because there is a path that this virus mutates enough to bypass any vaccine and be much more severe.
19823,I feel like everything I'm doing today is to prevent THAT outcome and not protecting unvaccinated today.
19824,yes and you still have All the cellular factories ready to make antibodies against Covid.
19825,"they just haven't seen covid for a while so they're slowing production (ie resource consumption) until they're are needed again, but they are still there."
19826,"If you actually go out and look, you'll see lots of evidence of vaccinated people either dodging infection, or not spreading infection if they get infected."
19827,Went back to school in my 30‚Äôs.

19851,Good insight on the reverse calculations.
19852,Somewhat meaningful when thinking about the context of US willingness to get a vaccination.

19859,I also know some very kind and nice people who you would never know are anti-vaxers.

19861,Could you please explain that?
19862,"Unless things get really, really bad, like back to our peaks in my state, I will not consider a third shot."

She fixed it."

19912,"It could very well last much longer, but they can't say that until the time actually passes."
19913,if your fully vaccinated you have the highest immunity but can still pass it on to unvaccinated.
19914,"basically you can carry a deadly variant which to you is asmpytotic but to unvaccinated could be bad

so I would say you are safe and a threat to the non vaccinated, rather than the other way around

and if there is any mandates you should oppose them, you did your part why should you allow a power creep in restrictions"
19915,These articles are going to do more damage to the mental health of the vaccinated than most breakthrough infections will.

19922,Second shot literally nothing happened
19923,It's spreading faster among the larger younger population who is also less vaccinated.
19924,"Thus, there's a higher number of cases of severe illness simply because there's a much higher number of cases overall."
19925,"There's no concrete study that it is deadlier or more severe to any specific age group *once you have already caught it*, just that it spreads easier so there are more cases of ALL severities in general."

19933,I had pfizer.
19934,The first shot got me pretty sick but the second shot got me maybe half as sick as the first.
19935,I haven't heard of people getting really sick from the Moderna vaccine.
19936,"Not doubting you, just wondering if you have any evidence to suggest that in viral cases long term memory B and T cells only prevent serious illness and don‚Äôt work to prevent symptomatic cases?"
19937,We get lots of vaccines that we don‚Äôt then experience symptomatic cases of illness - MMR vaccine is probably the best example.
19938,I understand your point that these viruses are not as prevalent in the community so it‚Äôs not an apples to apples comparison.
19939,But surely there is work done on the likelihood of a symptomatic vs serious illness of vaccinated individuals against viruses after the IgG antibodies wane
19940,"The immunity granted by flu vaccine last much longer than the year, It's just that we get different strains each season so the vaccine is revised to better target this year's relevant strains."
19941,Part of why seasonal flu isn't as bad as pandemic flu is because of the library of antibodies against different seasonal flu targets you build up over the years of vaccination.
19942,No it isn‚Äôt.

19947,"The CFR in Mexico is 10%, not helped of course by the lack of healthcare resources"
19948,What about you giving the delta variant to someone who is vaccinated?
19949,"but I guess the question is, is it that Delta is actually more deadly to young people or is it just that it is spreading so much faster that it‚Äôs getting access to more younger people who are unluckily more vulnerable to its effects?"
19950,"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21994,420,873.html

19951,Guessing some are blocked away for non-covid patients.
19952,"Ok, so when the next variant comes in that is more vaccine immune than delta, you'll just spread it to your family."
19953,"Well, you do you."
19954,"You are onto something, here."
19955,What if we tried charging money for the vaccine?
19956,Maybe then they would have a heuristic to valuate the vaccine.
19957,"""Young people now make up the majority of hospitalizations!"""
19958,Then young people are defined by like 0-49 or even 55
19959,I think it‚Äôs more important that we give doses out to ppl who haven‚Äôt had a *single* dose.
19960,"Rather than provide boosters to those that are fully protected, based on flimsy evidence that they‚Äôll be even better protected."
19961,Return on investment my friend.
19962,I think you don‚Äôt know what an osteopathic doctor is.

19964,"She was competent, kind, caring, and knowledgeable."

19974,"&gt;It‚Äôs a personal belief

A succinct summary of all religion."
19975,"Just when I think my heart is already broken, it breaks a little more."
19976,There are a lot of even more preventable ways people end up in the ICU- generally just being a dumbass like wreckless driving.
19977,"Are you saying then that if the majority of people in the ICU were there for a different easily preventable reason (like maybe a bunch of people took bad drugs at festival, for example, or a big crash from Philly's wheelie kids that drive 4 wheelers recklessly around the city, or some kind of gang violence situation), then those people would be the ones to get passed over, and specifically then not the covid vaccine deniers, for the arbitrary reason that their avoidable injury was the one that filled the most beds?"
19978,"I am not sympathetic to vaccine deniers (count me in the crowd that is pissed at them for keeping this problem going and making it worse for the rest of us), but I also think this idea doesn't make any sense."
19979,And one dumbass reason of injuring yourself isn't worse than another just because it's more common.
19980,"And while it is easy to get vaccinated, it's not that easy to stop being a moron if you are one."
19981,Just like it's not easy to stop being a moron who crashes their car repeatedly.
19982,"Desantis doesn't want you to have an abortion in the 1st trimester, but he ok if you want to wait into the 4th grade."
19983,"Not sure how correct this is, but I‚Äôve heard vaccinations are increasing particularly in areas with low vaccination rate/increasing cases."
19984,Maybe letting people feel the consequences of their actions is beneficial?
19985,Since end of March for me!
19986,"You know, the way I like to think about it is just because I have a gas mask on does not mean I want to sit in a room full of mustard gas."
19987,"In the same way, I think the vaccines are made much less effective because vaccinated individuals are subject to significant viral loads from unvaccinated individuals."
19988,"I firmly believe that breakthrough cases would be significantly reduced if more people were vaccinated, and I refuse to pin the blame on the vaccine for this."
19989,"In any regard, it absolutely makes sense that vaccinated individuals would still be able to get infected, especially in areas with 70%, unvaccinated and extremely high transmission rates."
19990,But hopefully this will subside and covid will become something in the background that doesn't really bother people because everyone has prior immunity.
19991,It is good to see an American government that is primarily concerned with issues within its borders.
19992,Previous concerns outside of its borders have tended to have negative consequences for the world.
19993,"It's hard to admit when you're wrong, but there's no reason to be condescending to someone about it."

20121,And some patients think the hotel is a resort and just complain constantly.
20122,Some are great but they are few and far between.
20123,18 months?
20124,We're hundreds of years into vaccines and people are still idiotic about that whole concept.
20125,[removed]
20126,That‚Äôs what they said pre delta.
20127,That the risk of the virus was low enough for the kids that it should wait until full approval and wasn‚Äôt considered an emergency enough for an EUA.
20128,"Similar to the discussion of ‚Äúshould we be vaccinating a 10 year old when there‚Äôs countries without enough vaccines for their at risk population‚Äù

Again all of this was pre delta and here‚Äôs a good summary https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2021/6/fda-panel-split-on-approach-to-covid-19-vaccines-f"
20129,...what?
20130,I hope you didn't pull a muscle cause that's one hell of a stretch.
20131,Fkn weirdo.
20132,Something to the effect of ‚Äúwhat was he like before?‚Äù
20133,100%‚Ä¶ it just means other precautions are needed to avoid infection.
20134,"It's all antecdotal, but my foolishly unvaccinated secretary came down with the delta a couple weeks ago and I also remained in clear as well."
20135,"I'm getting my third dose of Pfizer as part of the clinical trial today, but no one in my office with any vaccine (J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer or Novavax) has had a symptomatic breakthrough infection yet."

20138,"Five of the authors (MRR, GR, LCN, DY and JMM) filed a provisional patent entitled ‚ÄúMethod of use of Cannabidiol as an antiviral agent‚Äù."
20139,"Yes, but what I am saying is that the decrease might be from the seniors."
20140,Why isn't this data broken down by age?
20141,the mRNA vaccines aren't even dependent on those cell lines.
20142,remote cooperation argument isn't necessary here.
20143,"I‚Äôve never heard of this before, is it because the risk of relapse and damaging the new liver is so high it‚Äôs deemed not worth it?"
20144,was stationed in pine bluff Arkansas for 2 years.... let me begin with Arkansas has to be the worse state in the USA.

20154,"Seems unlikely, but I'll be happy to see some data on that."
20155,Ban wasn't due to repeat posting.
20156,"If you have access to the vaccine and you choose to remain unvaccinated, I don't think that you should be allowed to use of any of the hospitals resources when you inevitably get sick with covid."
20157,Save the resources for the people who got sick through no fault of their own.
20158,"There are two problems,  America and Europe depleting the world stock by increasing their demand to use for boosters, while the majority of the world hasn't had one."
20159,"With the vaccine hesitancy in the us, they will wait for people who are currently scared to go get vaccines."

20169,Freedom something something something.
20170,I hear you.
20171,My kids have had 3 hospitalisation because of RSV.
20172,This was the first winter where none of them were hospitalized.
20173,I'm terrified of what this coming winter will bring.
20174,I'm genuinely glad you feel better.
20175,Pain sucks and makes people desperate.
20176,But with respect I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this anecdote.
20177,I *think* that you're trying to imply that your experience of being cured by a spinal manipulation would be something that we can replicate in a study or experiment.
20178,If we could do that then I would have no grounds to say osteopathy is alternative medicine.
20179,Good
20180,"Typically well respected journals like ""Nature"" or more specialty specific journals will publish."
20181,Nature is kind of a gold standard of peer review.
20182,I wonder what portion of the anti-vax population is on Medicaid.
20183,I'd bet it's significant.
20184,Oh my no.
20185,But that half the state is only like 10% of the population.
20186,Why is your husband allowing his parents to tell him what to do?
20187,I‚Äôd tell them to take a hike and you‚Äôll see them when they get vaccinated.
20188,Or how permanently your life can be altered due to lung damage
20189,But you do need to be an expert to make me believe and TRUST you.
20190,"My logic isn't completely unsound and, again, it's not a strategy I'm advocating for others."
20191,I said the expert thing cuz I'm not gonna get flustered at some downvotes and the words of someone by the handle of TomLube.
20192,I mean you wanna correct me about oil issues I'm all ears.
20193,[deleted]

20195,This is why it confuses me why booster shots are necessary at the moment.
20196,If we really want to prevent variants from emerging we need to vaccinate other countries as well.
20197,Deaths are going to sky rocket now.
20198,So sad to see
20199,[removed]
20200,"I know there are a lot of good nurses, even hero nurses."
20201,But the fact that less than 50% of nurses are vaccinated has made me lose a lot of respect for the whole profession.
20202,&gt;the apparent waning effect in immunity was felt across all ages.
20203,"For all age groups, early vaccinators were 1.95 times more likely to be confirmed coronavirus positive."
20204,"Among those aged 60-plus, early vaccinators are twice as likely to get infected."
20205,"For those aged 40-59 early vaccinators are 2.1 times more vulnerable, and among under 39s they are 1.6 more likely to catch the coronavirus."
20206,It's simply an educated guess based on the fact that a vaccine exists.
20207,"If the vaccine offers any sort of protection against the virus at all, it's less likely to be able to mutate in the bodies of vaccinated people."
20208,If this wasn't true then the vaccine would be ultimately pointless as it would just constantly rapidly mutate to avoid every vaccine we create.
20209,"It will do this slowly anyway, but vaccines will at least slow it"
20210,[removed]
20211,[removed]
20212,And then...
20213,"Sadly I think the deniers would still say it was all paid actors to trick you into taking the vaccine, you read more and more stories everyday now of people who thought it was fake or not that serious contracting covid and the last thing they say is, I wish I‚Äôd gotten the vaccine."
20214,Interesting.
20215,Anecdotal.
20216,But interesting.
20217,Supposedly it's supposed to be a bronco-dilator.
20218,I don‚Äôt believe this
20219,&gt; We no that people with the virus can still easily pass on the virus.
20220,Yes.
20221,But we also know that getting vaccinated means you're less likely to get infected.
20222,Then I would feel the way I feel any time I spread a common cold to someone.
20223,This post appears to be about vaccines.

20230,"To the best of our current knowledge, both are equally effective."
20231,"Maybe, but different drugs tend to have different doses just to target an effectiveness rate, it may very well be comparable to Pfizer's vaccine."

20242,This is encouraging.
20243,"But really, people are not used to getting vaccines and still getting sick."
20244,People can't tell whether they've been exposed and can't know if they're healthy because of the vaccine or herd immunity.
20245,"They just know they've never had measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox."

20249,Willfull ignorance is a choice.
20250,Then what happens....
20251,you also are not explaining it the best.
20252,what matters is the development and maintenance of memory immune cells which can jump into action within hours of exposure once vaccinated instead of taking over a week to generate if you have not been exposed before.
20253,"Unfortunately though, measuring those cells is difficult to do in life human patents, so instead antibody levels are used as a rough marker, but honestly is measured more out of convenience than usefulness."
20254,"Im not in MA, but in CT the nursing home residents have something like a 98% vax rate."

20270,I guess it depends on how you define effectiveness.
20271,Effective against severe disease?
20272,Yes.
20273,Effective against infection ?
20274,"Maybe not, especially with the delta."

20326,(You see how binary risk measurements are stupid?)
20327,So far less testing than the vaccines were subjected to?
20328,This is a public health issue.

20333,"But paying vaccinated volunteers $30,000 to be infected with COVID is some Mengelian crime against ethics."

20352,Not to mention I have no idea what ‚Äúit better lasts longer‚Äù means.
20353,There‚Äôs few if any data indicating that Pfizer offers less protection and for less time.
20354,Comparing vaccinated folks to unvaccinated folks only once they catch covid is a bad faith argument.
20355,"Viral load may be the same between both groups but the vaccinated folks are wayyy less likely to catch it in the first place, which is the first step needed to spread it to others."

20364,You can't fix stupid.
20365,Please do not confuse CFR (case-fatality ratio) with IFR (infection-fatality ratio).
20366,"The former strongly depends on your ability to detect infected individuals (testing), as we know that a significant fraction of COVID cases have light or no symptoms."
20367,"If you test only the people that got to the hospital like in the early days of the pandemic, you get a 10% CFR, but the IFR is (still?)"
20368,though to be around 1% in western demographics.
20369,I‚Äôll happily slightly balance that anecdote out by saying I ran 100f after my second Pfizer.
20370,"Not quite as bad as you, but hey."
20371,It‚Äôs all innate immune system response anyway.
20372,There‚Äôs a reason the shot takes 1-2 weeks to build immunity.
20373,"That initial feeling isn‚Äôt you building antibodies and immunities, it‚Äôs literally your innate immune system freaking out going ‚Äúoh my god holy shit there‚Äôs so much stuff deep on here that shouldn‚Äôt be sound all the red alarms go into overdrive‚Äù."

20421,Anecdotal but I know someone who did go on a ventilator and came off fine.
20422,"Sorry for the multiple questions, I just couldn‚Äôt find this data in the study‚Ä¶

So if the study is putting a therapeutic dosage at ~1500mg, was this on a daily basis?"
20423,One-time?
20424,"In other words, how often was this dosage administered?"
20425,Everyone I have seen saying that is basing it on metrics that take weeks to reflect new deaths.

20428,I use CBD for my anxiety.
20429,I had all of those effects With Pfizer too.
20430,Also those effects are your innate immune response and don‚Äôt correlate to vaccine efficacy/uptake.
20431,"3x the ‚Äústuff‚Äù for your innate immune system to respond to, but whether or not it develops more antibodies and stronger/more memory cells is entirely up for debate."

20451,Thanks!

20453,That‚Äôs just not true.

20461,Lots of them.
20462,Time to close boarders!
20463,"If California is in creasing and Texas Biden needs to stop letting people in our country in 100,000 a day."

20467,My coworkers though covid was a joke until I showed them camera footage from the first Italy surge.
20468,Anti-vaxxers aren't thinking about a great many things...
20469,I mean both can theoretically be true.
20470,"Protection can wane and still remain strong, especially depending on how you define protection."
20471,"Protection against any kind of symptoms/infection, or just protection against severe cases/hospitalization?"
20472,I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much.
20473,"If you are vaccinated, you have good protection."
20474,"Booster shots could be necessary, or they could be overkill unless you‚Äôre part of a vulnerable group of people."
20475,"A lot of people panic about this stuff, but it‚Äôs a good idea to take a step back and realize you‚Äôre already protected and that that protection is good, and the studies on boosters are still preliminary at best."
20476,Maybe shut the boarders!
20477,if you keep getting exposed to it in every day life your body will keep making anitbodies.
20478,"With a highly contagious delta variant, chances are vaccinated people are going to run into it and your body will act, and act quickly."
20479,Just hand in your vaccination pass to your doctor and they'll tell you what you need.
20480,I plan to do that in the fall when I'm there anyway for the flu vaccine.
20481,I don't think I need any refreshers but you never know.
20482,I wish all our federally elected politicians would hafta use their local VA as their  healthcare provider.
20483,I think things would get better
20484,"My view is this: if a business asks me to mask up, I'll mask up."
20485,"If I need to mask up to hop on a plane and go somewhere, I'll do it."
20486,"I'm not, however, going to live in fear and constantly mask up if I don't have to."
20487,"I understand the risks, I understand how some may see that as ""selfish"" but if we keep worrying or waiting for cases to go all the way down, then life is gonna pass us vaccinated folks up."
20488,My mom's not getting any younger.
20489,There's a lot of places she hasn't seen.
20490,Is the south the safest place to go right now?
20491,Absolutely not.
20492,But she wants to see some places down south and we're gonna go.
20493,"We'll take the right cautionary measures and, required or mandated or not, if we're in a crowded indoor space we'll mask up if we don't feel comfortable."
20494,"But holy hell, the people who are shaming others for returning to life need to get a grip."
20495,Any reason why Thailand has more reported cases but fewer deaths?
20496,This is SMART!
20497,It‚Äôs just the nature of viruses.
20498,There will always be another variant.
20499,"As many experts have weighed in, any variant that can totally evade the vaccine is also unlikely to be able to infect humans."
20500,"I'm pro-pot but it's good to remember that most people are not altruistic:

20506,Moderna is not a much smaller company.
20507,They might have been 18 months ago but they are quickly gaining ground on Pfizer.
20508,"Market cap for moderna is 165.63 billion, pfizer is 251.42 billion."
20509,Both huge companies and the difference in market cap and free cash flow doesn't really justify how little moderna is supporting the hard science around their vaccine.
20510,As somone that is moderna vaccnated I'm pretty disappointed when I have to rely on pfizer studies to make health decisions and just hope that in the end they are close enough that the studies for one apply to both.

20552,But access for potential tourists is not remotely legitimate to whine about when general population access is still a year off in whole quarter of the world.

20554,"Doctors literally articulated this at the time, why are you pretending like 95% wasn‚Äôt the efficacy at one time?"
20555,Illness and death were not the only aspects of the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness back in December 2020.

20680,Or maybe you can get some sort of autoimmune disorder triggered by your immune response to the real virus even if your immune response was so quick and effective that you never got inflammation?

20837,"This *Post* article mentions that Pfizer's vaccine ""remained 91 percent protective six months after the second dose""."
20838,I don't know what they're talking about.
20839,Pfizer and more reliable news organizations reported it as 84%.
20840,"To quote Pfizer:^(1)

&gt;""From 7 days to &lt;2 months post-dose 2, VE was 96.2% (95% CI \[93.3-98.1\]); from 2 months to &lt;4 months, VE was 90.1% (95% CI \[86.6-92.9\]); and from 4 months to the data cut-off, VE was 83.7% (95% CI \[74.7-89.9\])."""
20841,"*The New York Times* cited the same numbers, although it noted that experts cautioned that the results are fickle and subject to chance, I assume because the clinical trials are so small (I think around 40k for Pfizer, 30k for Moderna)."
20842,"From the Times:^(2)

&gt;Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech released a detailed report of their own mRNA vaccine‚Äôs durability after six months."
20843,The companies estimated that the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy started off at 96.2 percent for the first two months after the second dose.
20844,"It then declined after that, to 83.7 percent by six months."
20845,"&gt;  
&gt;But experts cautioned that the calculated decline in the Pfizer-BioNTech study could have been a statistical artifact."

20904,Most people haven‚Äôt seen people in the hospital with a severe pneumonia to really comprehend how much it sucks.
20905,Excess mortality will paint a complete picture.
20906,His reaction is not so unreasonable.
20907,The scientific evidence we have so far shows that covid is not that dangerous to kids.
20908,A few hundred kids in the US have died from covid.
20909,"A larger number of course have been hospitalized or have symptoms that are taking a long time to go away, but the vast majority of kids shrug it off pretty easily."
20910,The biggest issue with kids is their ability to pass covid on to adults for whom the disease is likely to be far more serious.

20917,"So take a few paracetamol and a couple of days off, and just chill."
20918,It's worth pointing out that it's going to be jurisdiction-specific.
20919,"For example, the [New York Archdiocese has instructed its clergy to not provide those exemptions](https://www.ncregister.com/cna/ny-archdiocese-warns-priests-not-to-grant-religious-vaccine-exemptions)."
20920,"Additionally, the CDF has [noted](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20201221_nota-vaccini-anticovid_en.html) that:

&gt;In this sense, when ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines are not available... it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process."
20921,So Catholics are certainly able to receive the vaccines.
20922,"The fifth point of that document does go on to say that:

&gt;At the same time, practical reason makes evident that vaccination isnot, as a rule, a moral obligation and that, therefore, it must bevoluntary."
20923,"So yes, no one can be forced to get the vaccine."
20924,"But then it ALSO goes on to say that:

&gt;Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines producedwith cell lines from aborted fetuses, **must do their utmost to avoid, byother prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent."
20925,"** In particular, they mustavoid any risk to the health of those who cannot be vaccinated formedical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable."
20926,"In other words, if you're not going to get vaccinated, then you **must** avoid large public gatherings, wear a mask at appropriate times, and avoid proximity to people who are particularly vulnerable to the disease, etc."
20927,"Now how many of those same anti-vaccine people we hear and see daily are like ""I don't want to get vaccinated but I'm doing my best to protect others by staying away and wearing a mask""?"
20928,Basically none.
20929,"The line is always like ""I'm going to live my life."""
20930,This is in direct contradiction to the principles that are laid out in that CDF document.
20931,"In other words, if you're not going to get the vaccine then you have an obligation to impose restrictions on yourself that protect the lives of those around you."
20932,"It's not just ""vaccines aren't mandatory:"" your moral obligation to protect the health and well being of those around you remains and becomes significantly more burdensome in the event you choose not to."
20933,I think that's the bit that people forget or ignore.
20934,"And I'm thinking mostly ignore, because when you hear people talk, it's very prideful and self-centered language: ""**I'm** going to live **my** life."""
20935,They're elevating their own selfish desires above their moral obligations to their neighbors.
20936,"Anyway, TED talk over."

20946,"The article is super vague about what exactly students will have to provide to get a religious exemption, but there are many places where you just have to sign a form saying you have an opposition due to your religious beliefs."
20947,"I don't see anything in this article saying students have to prove their reason for exemption conforms to any particular definition of ""religious belief"" or anything like that, so I don't know what argument you want to have here."
20948,"I'm just pointing out that depending on how strict they are with this exemption, students may have more wiggle room than you think."
20949,"No, I called someone an anti-vaxxer because they are saying that vaccines aren't as effective as ""they"" say."
20950,That is what anti-vaxxers say to discourage vaccinations and undermine the effort.
20951,They are effective.

21156,I suspect it does not.
21157,It is only after 6 months that in the real world  pfizer began to lose efficacy.
21158,Pfizer is the only vaccine with a large pool of real world data (israel) that gives pretty much instant feedback.

21178,My 6 months would be over the course of the winter.
21179,How does that not track?
21180,Yes this is what people don‚Äôt understand.
21181,My cousin who was 29 years old got covid back in Feb/March and was hospitalized.
21182,He recovered after having the antibody infusion but less than 4 months later we found him dead in his apartment.
21183,Just died in his sleep.
21184,At 29.
21185,No doubt Covid weakened his organs.
21186,I firmly believe he would still be alive if he hadn‚Äôt had a severe case of covid.
21187,I know it‚Äôs pure speculation but it makes the most sense to me.
21188,it sucks since my toddler is too little to wear a mask (he won't keep it on) he is under 2 years old and doesn't understand the concept.

21322,This is just what happens when you use a vaccine on so many people with diverse health profiles; eventually you'll come across some side effects.
21323,The fact that no critical ones have been reported to this point speaks volumes about the safety of the shot.

21407,"The boosters will keep bolstering circulating antibodies, which are the first line of defense and keep people from getting infected or symptomatic in the first place, but they also wane first."
21408,"Fwiw In my opinion, it makes sense to boost, at least certain segments of the population, going into this fall winter."
21409,"But at the same time, those antibodies will wane eventually too so then do we need fourth doses?"
21410,Yearly boosters?
21411,Maybe.

21427,You are getting downvoted because you are citing a CDC study that outlines exactly how anti vaccination propaganda is behind the low vaccination rates.
21428,It says - right at the top - that most people are unsure of the vaccine‚Äôs safety and effectiveness.
21429,"Further, we are specifically discussing the 24% of respondents who replied that they never planned to get the vaccine."
21430,"And the survey didn‚Äôt give them an option to answer ‚Äúmicrochips.‚Äù But that group is almost equally split between ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust the vaccine‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe a vaccine is even necessary.‚Äù 

 The good news is that some people can be informed to get the vaccine, but that doesn‚Äôt magically mean that they aren‚Äôt afraid due to antivax rhetoric and propaganda."
21431,"It‚Äôs still antivax, even if they are only applying the position to THIS vaccine."

21575,Some of those childhood vaccines require boosters after many years.
21576,"A better way to look at it is this: the report (which is available [here](https://www.mass.gov/doc/daily-covid-19-vaccine-report-august-3-2021/download)) says that 100 vaccinated people have died of COVID **since January 19, 2021**."
21577,That's over six months.
21578,"If you download the raw data for Massachusetts (available [here](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/archive-of-covid-19-cases-in-massachusetts)), you can count how many total COVID deaths there have been in the state between that day and August 3, the date of the report: 4,082."
21579,"So, in that period of time, 97.5% of COVID deaths have been in unvaccinated individuals."
21580,"That would be impressive by itself, but it becomes even more so when you note that very old people were vaccinated first."
21581,"For quite a while in this six-month period, a ""vaccinated person"" meant exclusively someone over 65."
21582,"If the vaccine offered little to no protection against serious COVID, the death ratio should be just as high but in the opposite direction ‚Äî old people are more likely to get vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn't work, therefore almost everyone who dies is vaccinated."
21583,"The fact that the opposite is true is the real story, and you don't need to fallaciously use the total vaccinated population as a denominator to tell it."
21584,It will come but Sarah Gilbert said no covid-19 variant will entirely evade their vaccine so as far as serious disease goes we will be fine.

21588,I think a very important piece that gets left out of conversations about vaccinated people masking is that masking isn't fun.

21596,This is commonly misunderstood to apply to medical grade respirators also.
21597,N95 and KN95 respirators are effective at protecting both the wearer and others.
21598,In a situation where there may be pathogens in the air it is wise to wear one.
21599,They're available for as little as $0.20 in bulk.

21904,*
21905,You‚Äôre right.
21906,And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm angry with the CDC as well as the selfish idiots who refuse to do their part.
21907,"And people who don‚Äôt live here think we‚Äôre all a bunch of morons when I know big cities has mask mandates and a hell of a lot of people complied, everyone in my family sacrificed, and we also all got vaccinated."
21908,It‚Äôs all ‚Äúwell let Florida die then‚Äù as the hospitals fill.
21909,There are millions of people here just as horrified as them except WE have to live here.
21910,"That's where we got the term ""errybody"" from."

21916,"It would probably be fine, but damn, I'd be asking my child's doctor or other experts with advanced degrees in relevant fields."
21917,"Yeah you can still get covid even if you are fully vaccinated, this is no surprise."
21918,Especially if you wore masks an outdoor picnic blanket spacing event doesn't seem unreasonable.
21919,If it's sparse you could drop the masks.
21920,It's being in a crowd where it's more of a concern.
21921,"Keep incidentals like restrooms and everyone trying to file down a walkway to the parking lot in mind, definitely bring the masks if you might caught up in that."
21922,Also where you are can probably make 5-10x difference in risk
21923,"On the plus side, if hospitals announced they were doing this -- that they were going to refuse unvaccinated patients even before they hit capacity limits -- it would probably motivate a LOT of people to get vaccinated."

21925,How on earth would a vaccinated person ‚Äúshed infective viral particles?‚Äù The vaccines contain no live viruses - there‚Äôs nothing to shed.
21926,"[Viral Shedding and COVID-19 ‚Äî What Can and Can‚Äôt Happen](https://www.chop.edu/news/feature-article-viral-shedding-and-covid-19-what-can-and-can-t-happen)

While I doubt you are being sincere (because ‚Äúshedding‚Äù is 100% a term used by conspiracy theorists, not by people informed about Covid) do you mean an *infected* vaccinated person vs an *infected* non-vaccinated person?"
21927,"If you do, [here‚Äôs some info](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/phm/2021/06/covid-19-transmission-vaccinated-cases.pdf?sc_lang=en) on that that references several published, peer-reviewed studies."
21928,Delta may be a bit different ([info here](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/30/1022867219/cdc-study-provincetown-delta-vaccinated-breakthrough-mask-guidance).)
21929,"Luckily vaccines drastically reduce severe symptoms and hospitalization (and thus the cost to our public health care system, which is why even the nut jobs among us should want as many people as possible to be vaccinated.)"
21930,And of course all evidence suggests that vaccines reduce the chance that someone will be infected in the first place (and thus the chance that they would infect someone else.)
21931,If you are trying to make an argument against vaccines and/or vaccine passports (it‚Äôs not clear what your point is) you should find a different approach as this one is nonsensical.
21932,There's little to no mechanism to return doses back to federal government once distributed.
21933,"If the choice is between throwing out expiring doses and third shot, and donating them is not an option, go with the booster"

21944,"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833

‚ÄúWales and Scotland have vaccinated 91% of those aged 18 and over with at least one dose, while England has reached 89% and Northern Ireland 84%.‚Äù

With Delta on the horizon here in the US I‚Äôd feel much more comfortable with the UK‚Äôs vaccination rates."
21945,"No, the article is just saying they‚Äôll be less effective at preventing infection in time and we‚Äôll need a booster in the winter."
21946,"Still helps preventing infection on top of hospitalization and death, it just doesn‚Äôt prevent infection 100% of the time and effectiveness may wane with time."
21947,[removed]
21948,That's not true.
21949,There is no correlation between severity of side effects and efficacy of the vaccination.
21950,"A different part of the immune system, the adaptive part, reacts to the vaccine."
21951,The side effects people experience come from the part of the immune system you are born with.
21952,Every immune system reacts different.
21953,You'll be OK!
21954,"Yes, they can."
21955,"If you extrapolate from CDC data (their estimate of 5% of infections overall resulting in hospitalization, and the ratio of child hospitalizations per capita to the all ages per capita), this works out to about 1 in 320 infected children hospitalized."
21956,"[There's some UK NHS data](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58025045) showing nearly a quarter of hospitalizations, though, are people who were hospitalized for something else while happening to be covid positive (some amount of this is inevitable when much of the population is being infected), and though this article I linked doesn't state it a previous one I failed to bookmark said that number was even higher (I think I recall 1 in 3) among children."
21957,"Apply those corrections, and 1 out of every 425 to 480 infected children would end up hospitalized."
21958,"Not a negligible amount, but also not a *super* scary amount."
21959,Make of all that what you will.
21960,This is such bs.
21961,"Now, because of people burying their heads in the sand and not getting vaccinated, they are taking beds away from patients that need them."
21962,Not to mention the amount of money that now has to be spent on so many people who get covid and need to be hospitalized because they won‚Äôt get the damn shot!
21963,I'm going back to an assumption from when it was tested.
21964,"Nothing that has been currently put forward, youre coming in late slinging mud to feel superior."
21965,"Again, you suck."
21966,Ours got to capacity and had so many leave that we just got the biggest raise ive ever seen.
21967,"They couldn't keep the people to stay on, and the hiring was a mess due to covid and with staff so short they had to do something drastic."
21968,I was shocked but this only tells me this is going to be the new norm for a while.
21969,"Not enough staff, wayyyyy too much work."
21970,"No one wants to stay on, most of the new hires ive talked to are miserable even at higher pay."
21971,"Its just too much work for us to balance, its not supposed to be that way."
21972,Baloney.
21973,I live here.
21974,All the big cities had mask mandates until recently.
21975,"DeSantis removed local ability to *enforce* the mandates, not make them."
21976,"Despite the local law having no teeth, the vast majority of people kept masking because it was store policy to follow local law and CDC guidelines."
21977,Then the CDC said the vaccinated can throw all caution to the wind despite not having the data and with delta looming on the horizon.
21978,"How could local counties have a mask mandate, even a toothless one, when the CDC said it was fine?"
21979,By what authority could they back a law?
21980,"Listen to the science and all that, right?"
21981,"Oh sure, when you went to the grocery store it said the unvaccinated should still wear masks."
21982,"Oh clever, CDC."
21983,It was amazing.
21984,95% of the people inside were maskless in a place with with than 50% vaccinated.
21985,Fuck the CDC.
21986,It was the last bit of authority standing between us and the virus.
21987,"Now the virus is actually spreading unchecked for the first time in Florida, despite representations to the contrary."
21988,"73.5% fully vaccinated adults in UK vs 60.8%, but we are also vaccinating 12-17 year olds which the UK isn't, but your point still holds true."

22019,I‚Äôm in a rural area so I can simply elect to avoid people altogether if I‚Äôm sick.
22020,Why?
22021,Why are so many young unvaccinated?
22022,Isn't this generation (Z and younger Y) more left leaning?
22023,It's free.
22024,They can get it for themselves without parental permission now.
22025,"I'm an older millennial, but still under 40 and this baffles me how many younger people are just straight up ignoring it."
22026,"I mean, I also get the resistance to restrictions and the damage to mental health this whole thing has left us with."
22027,I want normal back too.
22028,But the vaccine is a huge path towards getting it.
22029,"Even if you don't believe in social distancing, at least a heavily vaccinated young population will likely still significantly reduce transmission and risks."
22030,A fully vaccinated nightclub still has a much better chance of not being a mass outbreak haven than an unvaccinated one.
22031,UK literally went ‚Äúfully open‚Äù two days before cases surprisingly peaked and plummeted back down again
22032,Shocking.
22033,What else did they expect to happen?
22034,!
22035,"And the strange thing is that, locally here so not in Arkansas, a few years ago there was an actual flu going around, and quite a few high school students were out sick for days, and every few days it was getting worse."
22036,Parents were begging for the schools to close a couple weeks.
22037,Just to let the flu burn through whoever had it and give other kids the chance to avoid it.
22038,"With the belief that many would be out most of those days anyway, sick."
22039,After last cold and flu season it's obvious a mask mandate would have helped keep kids in schools.
22040,But now several states won't be able to implement them in the future.
22041,This is the right answer.
22042,&gt; So the vaccine is working!!
22043,":)

Definitely and a far cry better than the flu vaccine worked for us in early 2020."
22044,"My whole family gets the flu shot every year and Feb 2020 we all got the flu (got checked for COVID antibodies in May 2020, nada)."
22045,Knocked us on our asses for a week or so.
22046,"Unlikely to be reinfected, but possible."
22047,"Dude, I was an early proponent of masks and distancing."
22048,I believed very strongly based on the data that we needed strong NPIs and medical measures.
22049,I pushed my local government to ramp up policies early.
22050,Don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm in COVID denial.
22051,But if we‚Äôre going to say ‚Äútrust the science‚Äù or ‚Äúfollow the science‚Äù we need to do just that whether or not it‚Äôs convenient to our own views.
22052,I believe 100% that the number of deaths is accurate.
22053,I believe 100% that it‚Äôs a severe and dangerous illness (mostly in adults.)
22054,But if we‚Äôre going to start doubting literally every journal and health authority reporting that impact on kids is minimal then we‚Äôre just as bad in our thinking as the Trumpists.
22055,"So you think the UK, Canada, and Australia are also lying?"
22056,I‚Äôm not convinced a third shot will do much.
22057,Pfizer trialed a third shot in their phase 2 and found no significant change in immune response beyond the second shot.
22058,It might provide a temporary boost to antibodies which could bring absolute infections down but it‚Äôs not a long term solution.
22059,Nice.
22060,I am not that up to date sorry :D I don't know if those vaccines already reached us here in Europe but I hope this will happen fast because it is important!
22061,"I'll take ""comments that will have aged like milk come Halloween"" for 500!"
22062,Her doctor literally advised her not to get vaccinated and it‚Äôs without a doubt a rare case.
22063,I am also of the mindset that literally anyone who can get vaccinated should.
22064,I am just saying I understand.
22065,Is anything perfect?
22066,No.
22067,Getting a vaccine is üíØ a hell of a lot safer than getting Covid.
22068,"The sooner we can get to herd immunity, which is only possible thru vaccination, the sooner we can move on with our lives."
22069,"I have been vaccinated, worn a mask for the last 20 or so months, and I want everyone to be safe."
22070,With rights come responsibilities that seems to have been forgotten.
22071,We are at the point if we don‚Äôt increase vaccination rates we could see a vaccine resistant variant appear and we have to start this all over again.
22072,Over the next few months we are going to watch tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people die.
22073,"We need people vaccinated, we need to clarify our messaging and we need to reform our healthcare system that is a disaster."
22074,Our healthcare workers are stressed af with no end in sight.
22075,It‚Äôs ridiculous
22076,This is so Our Slime Lord Kenney can outsource rapid testing to his buds so they can make that money.
22077,"So if there were 19,000 cases in that age group and 135 in a hospital, that means 99.992% were not hospitalized."
22078,"To me that's a pretty important number especially as Florida is a fuck show, no masks, etc."
22079,Makes me feel WAY better about my daughter starting kindergarten in our liberal bubble with all mask wearing.
22080,What were their reactions?
22081,Any questions?

22087,"Live in a low pollen, low ozone, non-polluted area and you're going to see much much lower effects from asthma."
22088,I don't see how blaming one not finding a pristine area for their asthma is much different than blaming one for having been over-prescribed opioids.
22089,"&gt;diseases that have zero input and zero patient or doctor control 

I think the diseases that really truly fit in this category are relatively small."

22119,"The fact that it's easily the most concerning vaccine side effect, yet it's still roughly ""die from drinking tapwater""-tier rare should be a big red arrow pointing at the ""GET VACCINATED"" sign though."

22125,"Good thought, but we can probably agree that people who don't stay safe (masks, social distancing) have a higher chance of getting COVID than people who do."
22126,No one in my family had either COVID or antibodies by the time we took the vaccine.
22127,"Regardless, 1% is probably unrealistic, even per year."
22128,"Note that per year is enough (as opposed to lifetime probability) because every year you would be getting a booster, so the odds *should* cancel out over lifetime unless either COVID or vaccines got much worse (or better) at giving people myocarditis."
22129,"The point here is that 1% OP used was just an example, using extreme numbers."
22130,"0.1% (vaccine) vs 10% (COVID) is absolutely unrealistic anyway given the article linked guesses at 6x higher, not 100x higher."
22131,"If the risk of COVID per year is under **16.6%**, based on the articles assumptions, you are better not getting the vaccine."
22132,Gives them some income while they're unable to work if elementary age kids have to stay home.
22133,"I got down voted for mentioning the 16% number:

Data¬†released by the Health Ministry on Thursday¬†suggested that people vaccinated in January were said to have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April the effectiveness was at 75%"
22134,"Right, my two Morderna shots were like 1 mont apart."
22135,Got my first dose back in April 3 and the second one on the first of May.

22137,boom there it is.

22301,90% of people over 60 are vaccinated in Israel.
22302,Use some math to figure it out
22303,Not necessarily.
22304,"It's possible that a subset of people get very strong immunity from the vaccine, meaning that those people would not get infected despite multiple exposures to the virus."

22400,I‚Äôm just so tired of life and the way things are going.
22401,I miss the old days before all this :/
22402,There's an ongoing debate about whether detection of neutralizing antibodies post-vaccine is required to generate immunity.
22403,"It very well could mean that, but it's not entirely clear."
22404,I completely agree that there is some correlation.
22405,But the overall point I was trying to make was that it‚Äôs not the sole scapegoat when it comes to who is and who isn‚Äôt getting vaccinated.
22406,People‚Äôs distrust in the government can stem from many things.
22407,"welp that means I'm good, off to smoke another ""vaccine""!!!!"
22408,/s
22409,"This seems like the only sane thing to do at this point, when no one under 12 years old has been vaccinated and large numbers of of the parents haven't either."
22410,Schools have always been a major transmission route for all diseases; ask any teacher or school employee.
22411,[removed]
22412,Tough crowd.
22413,I would like to see these numbers verified by an independent body with transparent data sharing.
22414,Or with more context over whether this applies to new variants.
22415,"I realize this is anecdotal, but based on my company's Slack channel, fully vaccinated people are getting it at relatively high rates."
22416,This is why religion is so important to them.
22417,"Without the external driver of a punishing god, they lack the internal motivation that moves everyone else to be decent people."
22418,I think the latest argument was that mRNA vaccines are a new technology so they will have latent effects‚Ä¶.or something to that degree
22419,"True, which is why I'm not in favor of providing free lung transplants to smokers that get lung cancer."
22420,"But if they're smokers and they come in for *Covid-19* treatment and they got their shot, then they deserve to be treated for Covid-19."
22421,And then they need to try hard to kick the habit.
22422,Because of [antigenic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_drift).
22423,"SARS-CoV-2 is a different virus from influenza, so the following doesn't apply directly, but with influenza the reason you get reinfected every few years is that the immune system doesn't learn the actually important proteins, it instead latches onto unimportant proteins that can mutate quickly because they don't actually affect the main functions of the virus."
22424,"The COVID-19 vaccines target the spike protein because that is actually important to the functioning of the virus, so it can't mutate as much."
22425,"But natural immunity has no such focus, so, if antigenic drift is a significant factor in SARS-CoV-2 variants, then infection from one variant will likely provide poor protection against future variants."
22426,"Natural immunity certainly provides some protection, but it's generally believed to be worse than immunity from vaccination, which is why the recommendation is to get vaccinated even if you've had COVID-19."
22427,"Although it may act to prime the immune system like a first dose, which is why some recommendations suggest only a single vaccine dose is necessary for people with a prior infection."
22428,[removed]
22429,Didn't Texas and Florida account for more than half of that?
22430,The real issue is going to be what is happening in the minds of the nurses.
22431,"Few people are willing to risk workplace issues that come from discussing a desire to leave a workplace, so relevant data would be hard to come by, but I am guessing that between the workload, the fact that a sizeable chunk of the population is overtly hostile to them, the strain of losing patients, the strain of losing patience, and fact that the state is giving them basically no support whatsoever and seems to be actively working to make things worse, nurses in Florida have to be seriously thinking about a career change by now."

22437,You have two approaches.
22438,First is a proper movie where you have the framing story of the reporter conducting interviews and then the scenes are fully dramatized.
22439,Second approach is to treat this like an in-universe documentary so he's conducting interviews with actual survivors and we get video of their interview spliced together with found footage.
22440,"Given that we have cheap cameras, it would be plausible that the survivor would have actually taken some of his own b-roll."
22441,I don't know which approach I would prefer.
22442,I think the second.
22443,You wouldn't need to 100% ape the book.

22451,The top dose proved too toxic.
22452,The low dose elicited the weakest immune response.
22453,The middle dose seemed to offer the best balance: it triggered strong immunity and had acceptable side effects.
22454,&gt; That 100-microgram dose ultimately became the one authorized for mass use in dozens of countries.
22455,But Moderna scientists later showed that a half-dose seemed to be just as good as the standard dose at stimulating immune protection4.

22468,"It could be beneficial for Israel to lockdown to increase vaccination rates, but locking down just to wait out the surge is pointless if there's no plan to avoid another round of increasing cases."

22470,"Because other methods like quarantining, testing, and contact tracing were used instead and they worked."
22471,"Furthermore, countries that relied mainly on these methods have fared well enough during COVID."
22472,It does make sense though!
22473,The places with high rates of vaccination are not the same areas running out of ICU beds.

22645,So they say they don't want to pay for unhealthy people yet there are likely to be the unhealthy ones in the case of covid.

22729,"Dude, seriously."
22730,PLEASE stop commenting ln and promoting ideas of things you seem to have NO clue on.
22731,Most (almost all) seriously ill people are over the age of 60.
22732,So let‚Äôs do some crude maths.
22733,Over 90% of those over 60 are vaccinated.
22734,"If we use the figures *60% of seriously ill are vaccinated* and *90% are vaccinated overall*, then we have:

‚ÄùRate‚Äù of serious illness:

Vaccinated: 0.6/0.9=0.667

Unvaccinated: 0.4/0.1=4

Vaccine efficiency: 1-0.667/4=0.833=83.3%

So this implies a vaccine efficiency of ~85% against serious illness."
22735,"Now, the number of vaccinated (90%) is probably higher, and if we consider that even older people are more likely to be vaccinated *and* more likely to fall seriously ill, then the vaccine efficiency goes even higher."
22736,"Now I know this math is crude and not entirely correct, but it shows the general idea."
22737,These numbers that they‚Äôre reporting in the headline says *absolutely nothing* without proper context.
22738,"The media chooses how they report these things, and it‚Äôs shameful."
22739,"And I‚Äôm sorry if I come across as harsh, but the people who swallow the fearmongering are idiots."

22744,They go through the motions and learn it just because it's the only way for them to get an MD in this difficult world.
22745,A slim majority don't even use it when they're out of school.
22746,"So you're probably okay seeing a DO, at least 57% of the time."""
22747,I don't dispute any of these facts and yet I think my point stands firmly unassailed by your apology.
22748,"Your fighter pilot analogy notwithstanding: Because someone holding a DO had, at one point in their lives and training, earnestly pursued OMT, calls their judgement into question."
22749,In my view this justifies a bias against them.
22750,Fighter pilots aren't forced to wave crystals over their airplanes to appease the Navigation Gods -- if some of them did I'm sure you would question getting in to their aircrafts.

22768,Follow-up headline: Trump promotes cannabidiol cure
22769,This is a real slippery slope.
22770,How many beers a week increases your premium?
22771,Does eating out count as unhealthy?
22772,What about frozen or highly processed foods at the grocery store?
22773,Did you go for a run/jog/walk today?
22774,How many hours did you work because stress is unhealthy.
22775,"On that note, did you get a good night sleep?"
22776,You should wear a sleep monitor to ensure you are getting to bed at the right time and sleeping through the night appropriately.
22777,"Now lets look at the next page of questions:

How do you commute to work?"
22778,Increased risk due to driving a car.

22781,Do you take sugar in your coffee?
22782,"The list goes on and while I agree it is reasonable to have a few very well defined penalties... such as ""Do you smoke?"""
22783,We literally just got away from preexisting conditions costing people more.
22784,"For example, pregnancy is a preexisting condition."
22785,"Ultimately, certain vaccines should be mandatory for participation in society and healthcare should be universal and contributed to via taxes."
22786,This!
22787,Your country has started rolling out third doses.
22788,"England, Germany, Israel."
22789,It doesn't drop to 0% after 7 months.
22790,"&gt; No one cares about us anymore man

No, no one cares about the vaccinated people who have medical conditions or immunocompromised or those who are immunocompromised and can't get the vaccine."
22791,That's the forgotten group.
22792,There are no statistics for them.
22793,Let's say no child dies from COVID.
22794,"It doesn't negate the fact that they become vectors for the virus which will enable its continued spread and ensure the deaths of thousands of others, breaking the healthcare system even more."
22795,"Your comment is pure idiocy and insanity, shallow and short-sided."
22796,"If only Florida had closed in border with Mexico sooner‚Ä¶

/s"
22797,Not sure if this is a slight but even if this whole country was 100% blue preventing those two things would be damn near impossible.
22798,Vaccines aren't FDA approved for Covid-19.
22799,"The reason why people won't even entertain the idea that this could work is because some conservatives have a favorable opinion on it and we are now in the era of having to do the exact opposite of whatever the ""other side"" does."

22829,*
22830,Lots of detractors in the US are gonna get a wake up call that vaccine mandates have strong case law *for them* at the Supreme Court level in the early 1900s.
22831,"If the cost of the test is covered, I know it's a hassle but getting tested multiple times would be a good approach to make sure"
22832,"Hell, even here in the US it's ridiculously easy to get a vaccine."
22833,I got mine at the local grocery store down the street.
22834,Got the 2nd shot a few weeks later.
22835,Too easy.
22836,[removed]
22837,Accurate.
22838,"My dads cousin, who is 51 is in the ICU, has 10% survival chance at this point and the first thing he asked when admitted was to get the vaccine :/ I don‚Äôt feel terribly sorry."
22839,"He is a proud boy, racist, mysoginistic, piece of crap."
22840,Bet once Lambda and Epsilon dominate they're gonna ask for hundreds of billions to develop an entirely new vaccine
22841,Aren't we getting shafted by Obamacare making it really hard for insurance providers to discriminate based on risk factors?
22842,"I also had the sleeping issue, got the shot on my sleeping side"
22843,"""no evidence"" does not mean disproved"
22844,smoking is actually the only case where that is legal.
22845,"The ACA outlawed denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, and it also made it illegal to charge more based on a person's prior health factors, with tobacco use being the exception."
22846,"It would be more fair to charge people for their shitty health choices, but that pretty directly conflicts with the goal of having universal healthcare."
22847,"A 2016 study found that tobacco users were less likely to have insurance (""-4.3 to -11.6 percentage points"") because of the higher premiums

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5589079/"
22848,"Like someone said below you, it's not forever."
22849,"And yeah, I have no problem with it, it'll take me an extra 3 seconds to get into places."
22850,I'm surprised they're actually hitting expiration date and not being extended by shelf life stability studies.
22851,Unless there's actual degradation of the molecule which is a big bummer.
22852,CNN is reporting that everything we‚Äôve been told is based on data from before delta so now we don‚Äôt know if any of this is still the case.
22853,So they may be just as likely to spread it if they show symptoms.
22854,"But they're less likely to A) catch covid, and B) show symptoms."
22855,Still makes vaccinated people less likely to pass on the virus.
22856,[removed]
22857,yeah my issue is the messaging.
22858,"when you‚Äôre told its 95% effective against infection, that‚Äôs different from it being only 60% effective against infection when exposed to the virus

of course they work at keeping you from getting hospitalized or dying but phrasing it like they did is misinformation and it doesn‚Äôt help with all the shit going around"
22859,"I mean sure, but based on where vaccines are now vs where needs them it becomes a ""finish your food, there's starving kids in africa"" argument doesn't it?"
22860,If these things are going in the trash next week I doubt they're making it across the globe in that time span.
22861,Ur assuming people won‚Äôt eventually get the vaccine.
22862,Most people in America like living in society.
22863,"If u cut them off from their jobs, schools, entertainment and because of the job they, they eventually end up homeless."
22864,People will get vaccinated.
22865,Very few people would rather starve on the side of the road while homeless then get vaccinated.
22866,To me it‚Äôd either that or just don‚Äôt treat them when they get sick if we wanna get back to normal as a society.
22867,I've read Pfizer is in discussion to put out a booster.
22868,"Maybe, but it's not like we don't have inspections for restaurants already."
22869,"Smokers, drinkers, morbidly obese people are at the back of the line for transplants."
22870,&gt; despite CDC guidance that said it was fine to go maskless.
22871,I mean - they specifically say to mask up if you're indoors if vaccinated and specifically call out hotspots - which Florida is the hottest.
22872,"As a rideshare driver, I tell people all the time ""HI, I'm fully vaccinated."
22873,You're welcome to not wear the mask if you choose to but I'll stay wearing mine for your safety.
22874,"But let's be honest, at this point if you aren't vaccinated it's cause you don't wanna be."
22875,Only one person has actually admitted at that point that they weren't vaccinated but should be.
22876,But maybe that's one life I saved through no extra effort of my own by guilting them just a little.
22877,I'd like to think such positive things are possible at least.
22878,"But we have seen vaccinated people are much, much, much less likely to become infected."
22879,"The vaccines work, and telling people they're useless is alarmist at best, downright despicable at worst."
22880,Agree.
22881,"Also, taking 1 or 2 doses of a vaccine is much easier than trying to combat a chronic, multi-year/decade addiction (including food addition)."
22882,"Many of these conditions are also caused by things that are not the person's fault (e.g., being abused as a child), not simple laziness as others on here are implying."
22883,This should be factored in when decided what justifies charging an insurance premium.
22884,That seems like a thorny ethical issue - what if the vaccinated person who needs the bed needs it because they made poor/risky health choices?
22885,[deleted]
22886,Better mandate the removal of  anything that protects Texans then!
22887,&gt;**Florida law does not include minimum nurse staffing requirements.
22888,"** But  
&gt;  
&gt;state rules make clear that facilities must have enough nurses on staff  
&gt;  
&gt;to sufficiently **ensure ‚Äúimmediate availability** of a registered nurse for  
&gt;  
&gt;bedside care of any patient when needed, to assure prompt recognition  
&gt;  
&gt;of an untoward change in a patient‚Äôs condition and to facilitate  
&gt;  
&gt;appropriate intervention by nursing, medical or other hospital staff  
&gt;  
&gt;members.‚Äù

Yep... no minimum and an undefined measurement of ""immediate availability""..."
22889,"If Domino's can say pizza pickup within 2 minutes or less, one would think that in medical care, there would be some aggregate # on time from the nurse call button is depressed to when it was reset...."
22890,That‚Äôs fine.
22891,But I still want a booster.
22892,Thanks!
22893,[removed]
22894,Pretty much.
22895,Usually at that point you only need one because you've already trashed yours.
22896,They basically see it as throwing it away even if you've been clean for a little while.
22897,Plus if you're that hardcore of an alcoholic you've probably got other organ damage as well and probably won't get the longevity out of it that say a younger or otherwise healthy person would.
22898,I'm not sure but I think there are other substances that are abused that will get you a similar treatment for transplants.
22899,[removed]
22900,"In fact, I know someone who caught whooping cough even though they were vaccinated as a child because you need the booster to remain immune."
22901,"This person was only given TD, not TDaP (P is for pertussis i.e."
22902,whooping cough) for their 10 year booster.

22908,Yeah.
22909,That goes without saying.
22910,We all get that.
22911,"But again, we're talking about VACCINATED people who have mild/asymptomatic cases here."
22912,You gotta control your variables and have your Bayesian priors in line.
22913,"There's a massive difference between: 

1."
22914,"Increased spread (which is obvious with Delta)
2."
22915,"Increased virulence (which is still not yet obvious with Delta)
3."

22922,This.
22923,And precisely why I continued to wear a mask indoors here in Florida despite CDC guidance that said it was fine to go maskless.
22924,It gives advice to the whole country and at a population level‚Äîyou still have to understand your situation and act accordingly.
22925,"I know I gave my insurance info at the vaccination drive type thing I went to, but my card just has the dates and batch (on the first date only) and I had to fill in my name/birthday."
22926,I don't even have a patient number.
22927,Emailed the pharmacy today to ask what that's all about.
22928,Then its 92% effective at 7 months
22929,"Iirc, a good chunk of the covid deaths were the result of hospitals getting filled up and leaving the infected without treatment."
22930,Reddit is strange.
22931,I think some people don‚Äôt even read the text but glance over and see negative votes so they assume it‚Äôs bad and downvote too.
22932,Vice versa with upvotes.
22933,That explains a LOT.
22934,"I was super wiped out for months and came up positive for EBV, but it‚Äôs been decades since I had mono."
22935,Bad thing is that the EBV test isn‚Äôt super reliable after a person has been initially infected.
22936,Pretty positive I had an early case - like fall 2018‚Ä¶.
22937,especially after this.
22938,"I have general Covid anxiety, but realistically you have to ask yourself what you're concerned about:

* Dying?"
22939,The number of fully vaccinated people dying is extremely tiny.
22940,* Getting hospitalized?
22941,The number of fully vaccinated people getting hospitalized is extremely small.
22942,* Getting Covid?
22943,"Breakthrough cases are on the rise due to Delta, but all signs point to most cases being pretty mild and by no means deadly."
22944,Ultimately we all deal with that sort of thing all of the time with cold and flu season.
22945,* Long Covid?
22946,"I honestly don't know the data here, and I don't think anyone knows."
22947,"But if cases are mild overall, I would assume most people would be fine?"
22948,That second bullet point is quite problematic when it comes to a privately owned business.
22949,They should be sent home.

22963,My first Moderna shot put me down for the entire next day with a migraine-like headache.
22964,I think dehydration played a role as well.
22965,That and a *really* sore arm (kept me up a few nights as a side sleeper) were the only side effects I had.
22966,My second shot I didn't have anything besides a (much less) sore arm.
22967,[removed]
22968,Yea then probably not a good fit there has to be some self regulation.
22969,My son is sort of the same way and there was growing pains the first month lot of tears and we thought it wasn't going to work.
22970,We really worked with him and  I had to sit in with him on a lot of classes and work but he really took a liking to it and started needing me less and less.
22971,The hard part is clearing all the distractions around him and giving him a place that was school work only.
22972,"From what I've seen with my local Starbucks locations, all indoor spaces are closed anyway for ""dining"" and have been (I live in Manhattan)."

22984,"If they introduce a 3rd booster shot, travel restrictions will most likely have you have 3 shots."
22985,"And if he snuck in a 3rd shot before there was an actual 3rd shot, he wouldn't have 3 shots on his vaccination card."
22986,That would mean he needs a 4th shot to be able to travel.
22987,Not everyone can get the vaccine.
22988,Many are not t#king that group into consideration.
22989,It‚Äôs not black and white.

22993,Kiddo who is too young to get vaxed and gave it to us?
22994,Is 100% after two days.
22995,[removed]
22996,It actually costs society MORE to  turn citizens into a permanent underclass.
22997,And we need more med schools.
22998,"This is an exaggeration/generalization, but we have basically the same number of medical schools and the same number of spots for students as we did 100 years ago; meanwhile, our population has grown significantly."
22999,"Add in the charting requirements, doctors cannot keep up even in a normal situation."

23003,"&gt; It‚Äôs shitty that many countries are still failing to secure doses for their citizens, but that isn‚Äôt any of our fault."
23004,"For many other countries, I'm not sure you can say that."
23005,"For example, the African Union collected over a billion dollars from their member states months ago so that they could buy vaccines, but the US and other rich countries had already locked the vaccine-producing companies into production contracts with themselves."
23006,(They are finally getting some shipments [now](https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2021/08/05/african-union-au-begins-distribution-of-400-million-covid-19-vaccines-to-member-states-and-the-caribbean/) via both the AU and programs like COVAX.)
23007,"As for India's actions, I can't say that I blame them -- vaccines produced there were going to rich countries while their own citizens were getting sick and dying at a horrible rate."
23008,&gt; The countries that are failing to vaccinate for covid due to supply are the same countries that fail to vaccinate for a myriad of viruses.
23009,The hosts and guests at This Week In Virology (some of whom have done work in the developing world for parasitic diseases) have remarked that many low- and middle-income countries actually have fairly good mass-vaccination programs *when* they have the right supplies.
23010,"The people who live in such places have seen the effects of vaccine-preventable diseases up close and personal, and their healthcare workers have plenty of practice with it as well."
23011,Not to mention Long Covid.
23012,Lots of people are needing care for that (I'm one of them).
23013,I got covid before we knew anything about covid and have had 3 hospital stays and 47 Dr appts thanks to covid.
23014,"I've been wearing a mask every day since late Feb 2020, not knowing for awhile that covid fucked me up."
23015,"So, many people are like ""it's just the flu""."
23016,"Sure, maybe for a week, but many are suffering long term symptoms that now need hospital and Dr care"
23017,"Everyone, but depending on where you permanent address was."
23018,International students had to have more vaccinations depending on the region they came from.
23019,Americans just needed the standard required vaxs K -12 schools required.

23021,Then get the J and J and hope that you can get the MRNA later.
23022,Please don‚Äôt travel unvaccinated.

23024,* you believe that October thing doesn't exist
23025,Thanks for this information!
23026,I received a mixture.
23027,Pfizer for first dose and Moderna for second dose.

23030,Better safe than sorry.

23032,Homeschooling isn't 8 hours a day.
23033,It's amazing how much less time you spend on schooling when you're in charge of being able to cut out the bullshit.
23034,"And I don't mean like subjects the parent personally doesn't like (that would be a disservice) I mean no attendance taking, no forced time schedule that demands lessons end no matter where the teacher &amp; student are in the lesson, no walking a half mile to your class with 30 lbs of book on you back, and best of all, no drop off/pick up traffic."
23035,"Variation exists, but since the faces are so small, it's hard to tell unless you're examining them up close."
23036,"I understand that 100% but is longcovid that prevelant, I know a metric ton of people that got covid during the initial wave and I've yet to meet anyone with lingering affects."
23037,Anecdotal for sure but in my life experiance I've yet to meet one.
23038,"No, my giant eagle has all 3 of the vaccines."
23039,I was going to go sunday.
23040,"I just didn't know if I should do the first dose of one or just do the J&amp;J. I did have covid in march, positive with symptoms."

23046,"The EU still has two countries below 40% (Bulgaria and Romania), while the total number is slightly higher than in the US (60.1% vs 57.6%)."
23047,Is it better to have anti-vaxxers concentrated in a few areas or spread out throughout the entire continent?
23048,It is but it will hit a brick wall soon.
23049,The big uptick in vaccinations over the past 2 weeks has largely been from the people who were simply too lazy to go get it before it all became bad again.
23050,"Unfortunately in the US, there is a pretty large population of citizens who will not under really any circumstances get the vaccine."
23051,"You dropped this:

23088,"Speaking for a pandemic, few years ago there was a man in Texas sentenced for 45 years for spreading HIV."

23091,"COVID killed 600,000 in just 2020."
23092,The only reason this is not treated similarly is because there's so many infections and vast majority are spreading it unintentionally.
23093,A business purposefully facilitating the spreading is a bit different and the only reason no one goes after them yet is because we are busy with the pandemic.
23094,[removed]
23095,Yes.
23096,Rewarding the vaccinated by letting us take off our masks didn‚Äôt work.

23100,I'm sure the guy in charge is being completely ethical Redditors told me so.
23101,"**Article**

Throughout the pandemic, I have cared for kids admitted with covid-19 to the children‚Äôs hospital in Houston where I am a pediatrician."
23102,"These children have included newborns with fevers who require a sepsis evaluation, school-age kids whose bodies are ravaged with inflammation associated with covid-19 in children, and tweens and adolescents with covid pneumonia who need oxygen and other respiratory support."
23103,"I‚Äôve cared for children whose entire families have been devastated by covid ‚Äî sometimes the child was sick enough to be admitted but had no parent at their bedside because the parents were critically ill at the adult hospital down the street or, worse, had recently died of covid."
23104,"All the while, as both a doctor and mother, I‚Äôve wrestled with a certain dissonance: There is this popular notion that covid doesn‚Äôt affect children ‚Äî and my public health and epidemiologic training reminds me that on a population level, it‚Äôs true."
23105,The majority of children who contract covid-19 will be asymptomatic or have mild disease.
23106,But I contrast this with the reality of being a clinician at the bedside of children critically ill from covid and covid-related illnesses.
23107,These two perspectives battle in my brain as I make risk assessments for my own school-age child.
23108,"One thing that terrifies me as a parent is that we can‚Äôt predict why some children get so incredibly sick from covid while others have mild disease; we don‚Äôt know why some go on to have lingering debilitation and symptoms for months, and others make quick recoveries."
23109,"What I do know is that in this moment, as the highly contagious delta variant becomes the predominant strain circulating and we enter another covid surge, I am more worried for children than I have ever been."
23110,"First and foremost, this is because the high transmissibility of the delta variant will translate into a greater number of children being exposed than before, which will lead to a greater number of children infected."
23111,"Even if the delta variant is no more virulent in children than the original virus was, the sheer numbers will translate into more children being admitted to the hospital with covid and covid-related illnesses."
23112,"As school reopenings coincide with the growth of the delta variant, I worry we will see large outbreaks in school settings that we didn‚Äôt see with less-contagious versions of the virus."
23113,"I wonder, if more people saw what I see at patients‚Äô bedsides, would they do more to protect children?"
23114,I talked with one mother who wondered whether she could have done something to prevent her child from ending up sick in the hospital with covid.
23115,"I recall providing emotional support ‚Äî in addition to oxygen, steroids and remdesivir ‚Äî to a teenager admitted with covid pneumonia who was grappling with the recent deaths of multiple family members with covid."
23116,His life had turned upside down in a few short weeks.
23117,"Over the course of the pandemic, our hospital system has diagnosed more than 15,000 children and adolescents with covid ‚Äî a number that is trending up."
23118,About 10 percent of them have required hospital admission.
23119,"Up to one-third of children admitted to our hospital have required critical care ‚Äî including oxygen delivered through high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, and intubation with mechanical ventilation."
23120,"When I discharge children from the hospital, I know that many of them have a long road to recovery, and many will require follow-up for cardiac clearance and long-term care in our hospital‚Äôs long-covid clinic."
23121,"More than 300 children across the United States have died of covid since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
23122,"Most children with covid will make a complete recovery, but up to 10 percent, including those with mild illness not requiring hospital admission, go on to develop months-long symptoms of long covid."
23123,"During previous covid surges, children‚Äôs hospitals in the United States experienced very low patient volumes compared with prior years because people were not seeking routine medical care or elective procedures."
23124,"We could easily handle the influx of children with covid because we also were not seeing much of the common viruses of childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza, which typically keep children‚Äôs hospitals busy all winter."
23125,"During previous surges, children‚Äôs hospitals across the country were able to serve as pop-off valves for adult hospitals overwhelmed with covid admissions, in many instances stepping up to admit and provide direct clinical care to adult patients, or lending equipment to adult hospitals."
23126,"What‚Äôs different this time is that children‚Äôs hospitals are also dealing with an unusual summertime surge in respiratory viruses, including RSV, which causes acute illness in infants and toddlers."
23127,"Our hospitals are seeing a huge, sustained influx of patients with RSV ‚Äî who often need oxygen and respiratory support ‚Äî and we are busier at our baseline than at other times during the pandemic."
23128,"I worry how children‚Äôs hospitals will handle a covid surge on top of the RSV surge, which will stress hospital systems and staff."
23129,Adding to my concerns as a pediatrician is that our society is dealing with covid fatigue.
23130,"Children younger than 12 remain ineligible for vaccination, but people are tired of following mitigation measures and eager to get back to normal life."
23131,Too many eligible adults and adolescents over 12 years of age remain unvaccinated.
23132,One important step that families can take to protect their children of all ages is to ensure that all eligible household members over age 12 are vaccinated; it is heartbreaking to care for children hospitalized with covid when I know this could have been prevented.
23133,"I am often approached by friends, family members and neighbors facing the difficult decisions that I also face as a pandemic parent: How do we keep our children safe?"
23134,"I like to remind them that during the past 18 months, we‚Äôve gained both experience and knowledge and developed tools and recommendations to help limit the spread of covid ‚Äî all based on scientific evidence."
23135,"Masking (including universal masking in schools), physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining and vaccinating do help."
23136,"If we abandon these crucial tools now, we are putting our children in harm‚Äôs way."
23137,"Arkansas  and Alabama , what else needs to be said"
23138,"Austin just announced that Travis County, which includes Austin, is at their highest level."
23139,Not as furious as the people you endangered‚Ä¶ the vaxxed are getting pissed.

23154,"Vaccines DO reduce infections, and there has been ample proof of that."
23155,A vaccinated person is less likely to get infected than an unvaccinated person if they are exposed to an infectious person.
23156,"The exact efficacy depends on multiple factors including age and variant, but so far, even the lowest estimates show some protection from infection."
23157,"Bring on a fat tax, it‚Äôs worked well in Japan."

23162,Fu\*k em.
23163,"When we count the non-vaccinated deaths, I don't see any of us differentiating between with or from."
23164,What does make sense for 2020 is how many we would have expected to die (from any cause) and how many did.
23165,"Then, we can say confidently that X (likely in the ballpark of 500k) died in the US from causes related to COVID-19."
23166,"Anyway, in this case, maybe the best we can do is % of hospitalized who are vaccinated vs area population vaccinated and % of fatalities who are vaccinated vs area population vaccinated."
23167,No judgement.
23168,I think that you'll feel great by being one and done prior to your trip.

23179,No.
23180,I was right.
23181,We were just all lied to and half the country did everything possible to make things worse.
23182,"I even got dogpiled a few times in this forum when we were at a few dozen deaths for saying ""even if I'm only half crazy, we're still going to see over 100,000 people die""."
23183,Nobody wanted to hear it.
23184,I didn't want to hear it.
23185,"&gt;all of us have a little voice telling us to fuck over our neighbor, to be selfish, to get ours before someone beats us to it‚Ä¶

I... Really don't though."
23186,"I'm not trying to be all ""oh look at me, I'm such a good person"" because I'm not."
23187,"But to use a very casual version of your ""better get mine before someone beats me to it"", I'm the type to pass out items to everyone else before I get mine and if we run out before I do, I'm happy to be the one to take the hit of not getting whatever it is in order to make sure everyone else does get theirs."
23188,Most people I know are the same.
23189,"Maybe I just hang out with the ""right"" crowd, but I would say among the people I know, my same mindset is the general rule, not the exception."

23200,Source?
23201,There's no fucking playbook for this virus.

23204,"I'm not saying it's 100% going to happen, or even 1%."
23205,But it's possible.
23206,Do the scientist BELIEVE they will be able to create vaccines for the mutations?
23207,Sure.
23208,Do they KNOW?
23209,No.
23210,No one knows.
23211,That's my point.
23212,We don't know.
23213,Which is why it's so important to knock this fucker out.
23214,"After reading the post, my anger against this particular woman is slightly cooled."
23215,"She wasn't anti-vaxx, she just procrastinated."
23216,"I still have no real sympathy - every pharmacy now has walk in vaccinations available, the doctor's office asked if I was vaccinated last time I went in for something unrelated, Google Maps recommends vaccine sites every time I open it for something else, Alexa recommended it last time I used one, I'm getting cards in the mail... freakin everywhere wants to give the vaccine."
23217,But I'm not angry.
23218,But I am tired of this kind of story.
23219,So tired of hearing from the people who got COVID that they wish they had done something different.
23220,**Of course** you wish you had done something different.
23221,I spent the last year living in the fear of being in your position - of laying in a hospital bed or watching a funeral for a loved one who died because I brought COVID into their life.
23222,"But I took that fear and turned it into action - I worked from home, I chased down medical grade masks (KN95's were available), I shopped at off hours, I limited my social activities, built a home gym... anything and everything I could do to protect myself and others."
23223,"And now that we have a miracle protection, a vaccine that's more effective than it has any right to be... now people are turning it down and deciding that it's safe to go back to their old routines without taking precautions."
23224,Sometimes I think the virus is winning.
23225,And I'm pretty sure it has a right to win given how *fucking moronic* we're being.
23226,Of course.
23227,"How are things going to look in 2 weeks, a month after the kids take the virus to others?"
23228,What about the kids who can‚Äôt get vaccinated and this spreads to others who are unvaccinated.
23229,This experiment makes no sense.

23231,You don't get long term side effects from a drugg you take once or twice.
23232,Has never happened and never will.
23233,You get long term side effects If you take a drug over a long time.
23234,Sleeping pills for example.
23235,After a while you cannot sleep without them.
23236,That's not the case with a vaccine.
23237,I'm sure boosters are coming but it won't be enough applications for long term side effects.
23238,Not sure where you are getting breakthrough rate of .004% as even the studies that led to approval had higher rate than that and that's also not considering delta variant.

23250,Well I personally think not.
23251,They will get sicker vs vaccinated and can cause worse mutations though.
23252,And I think it is  not a matter of dying or living anyway.
23253,The problem is people who get sick longer and no longer can work because of it.
23254,We now have thousands of people not working already for months because they probably have longcovid and get tried after two steps.
23255,That will become a bigger problem in the future.

23292,"Again, the idiot CDC gambled, played with fire, and the population is suffering from it."

23306,"‚ÄúIn 2020, before covid vaccines, most major private insurers waived patient payments ‚Äî from coinsurance to deductibles ‚Äî for covid treatment."
23307,But many if not most have allowed that policy to lapse.
23308,"Aetna, for example, ended that policy Feb. 28; UnitedHealthcare began rolling back its waivers late last year and ended them by the end of March."
23309,"For this reason, there‚Äôs logic behind insurers‚Äô waiver rollback: Why should patients be kept financially unharmed from what is now a preventable hospitalization, thanks to a vaccine that the government paid for and made available free of charge?"
23310,"It is now in many drugstores, it‚Äôs popping up at highway rest stops and bus stops, and it can be delivered and administered at home in parts of the country.‚Äù"
23311,"i would argue that it‚Äôs a framing issue to say that the vaccines are 95% effective (90% was claimed for delta iirc) at protecting you from being infected with covid when you‚Äôre taking the total number of people who are vaccinated and 5% get it

23331,"I‚Äôve tried begging the director of schools to mandate masks, but he refuses."
23332,I‚Äôm so stressed and anxious that I‚Äôm about to lose my mind.
23333,"I did send her to school in a mask, but she was the only one wearing one."
23334,I cried after dropping her off.
23335,Our governor has stated he does not want masks in schools.
23336,Our state leaders have threatened to call a special session if any school district tries to mandate masks.
23337,I‚Äôm so angry at them for putting us in this situation.

23346,I believe lockdown and social distancing  measures  to drive down covid numbers also helped to drive down other contagious diseases
23347,In more general terms anyone who has family abroad.
23348,Plenty of green card holders and dual citizens have most of their families abroad.
23349,Over 10% of US population is foreign-born.
23350,Endgame: Get everyone vaccincated.
23351,Crush small businesses.
23352,Make health insurance more expensive.
23353,Create a nation of renters.
23354,Get institutions as many assets as possible.
23355,Burdon the average person with as much debt as you can.
23356,"The list goes on, and none of it is for the benefit of you or me."
23357,I think the endgame is once we have a vaccine available for all ages.
23358,And it will likely require a booster every year.
23359,Then this will become like the flu.
23360,The flu kills tons of people every year but at this point it‚Äôs mostly the ones too stupid to get a yearly vaccine.
23361,I mean that‚Äôs what the 1918 pandemic morphed into.
23362,That‚Äôs our modern endemic yearly flu.
23363,"Honestly though, we should‚Äôve normalized masks during flu season years and years ago."
23364,If something needs to stay it should be that to protect the vulnerable.
23365,"The fact that people for years have known they‚Äôre sick with the flu and walk around spreading it in the office, school or any public place is a huge statement on how poor our hygiene education is/was and how detrimental our social and work attitudes are/were."
23366,The burden of proof is on me to prove your statement true?
23367,Interesting logic.
23368,Apparently we don‚Äôt have enough deaths yet
23369,I've quit two jobs during covid.
23370,One cause family got to my fiance and was able to convice her we needed to move from fort worth.
23371,Got a job back east coast while we lived with her family.
23372,That job paid me 1500 a month working 80 hours a week and was burnt out.
23373,"Left it for my current job, was better mentally, but things went to shit at home and can't make enough money to support 4 adults and a baby so back to super stress."
23374,And was just informed today that they are prepping to scale back hours cause employer expects another lockdown.
23375,So...idk I'm just rambling.
23376,Was he vaccinated ?
23377,"If not, he did harm you, him, and the other people in dire need of oxygen."
23378,I wouldn't lift a finger to help anyone in Florida
23379,I work at a Fortune 50 corporation in the US.
23380,"The vocal people who are upset are one of two groups: vaccinated people who are mad they have to wear masks and blame the unvaccinated, or unvaccinated people who are mad they have to wear masks and blame the company and mainstream media and liberal politicians."
23381,"""Wow I've never seen any videos of people falling down, that must mean it's never happened anywhere else!!!"""
23382,This sounds crazy but apparently [adding baby shampoo to the saline rinse](https://www.google.com/search?q=baby+shampoo+saline+rinse&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari) can really make a difference.
23383,I have a message out to my ENT for added reassurance haha
23384,&gt; Are we just going to have to wear masks forever at this point?
23385,"Seeing us regress to this point despite vaccines, I'm going with ""yes""."
23386,(Though I'd expect it to vary regionally.)
23387,"So long as &lt;100% of the world is vaccinated and so long as evolution is a thing, there will never be zero COVID cases and there will always be another variant."
23388,"We can look forward to 2-3 month mask-free windows on the downslope of every surge, followed by another seasonal uptick in which mask mandates come back in a panic."
23389,Doesn't take much of that before it's 2038 and a whole generation has grown up with this as its normal.
23390,We're already like 8% of the way there.
23391,Kiss the days of seeing faces and hearing un-muffled voices goodbye.
23392,A teenager in Georgia died this week.
23393,His school system almost instantly changed their mask rules and mandated masks just the day before school started back.

23401,Country of origin doesn‚Äôt matter.
23402,The dispersed here was also over crowded and made into garbage dumps by amateur campers.
23403,"If the unvaccinated are to blame, why are vaccinated people being made to wear masks?"
23404,"If the vaccines protect us (they do), why are we responsible if those who decline the vaccine are getting sick?"
23405,It's like asking everyone to give up eating peanuts to protect those who are allergic.
23406,It's nothing but nursery school public health.
23407,"Even if every single person in the world got the vaccine, the virus would still be around."
23408,It'll always be around because it's the same kind of virus as the flu and cold.
23409,"Constantly evolving, never to be destroyed."
23410,"Covid is HIGHLY transmittable, even amongst the vaccinated."

23415,"Yeah, there is."
23416,The only evidence we have is that it's more dangerous on an individual level.
23417,On the other hand there's no evidence it isn't more dangerous on an individual level.
23418,"&gt; Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 59% (49-69%) for hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) for ICU admission; and 61% (40-87%) for death."
23419,Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 120% (93-153%) for hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) for ICU admission; and 137% (50-230%) for death.

23426,...for the original virus in the general population.
23427,"Since the people getting seriously sick now are a selected sub group, different stats may apply."
23428,"On top of that, the big feature of the Delta variant is its high R0 number... more people getting sick faster means more pressure on health care services, which if they reach a breaking point could also increase the number of deaths involved."
23429,"I won't even go into issues with people who don't die but have  ""long covid""."
23430,"Thank you, I'll take a wee look."
23431,"maybe not worth for you, but could've been worth it for the 600k death and their families."

23434,"That's what mine is, it's not that I can't taste anything it's just that what I can taste feels, weird."
23435,What prompted me to even post originally was that i'd just finished a Chinese takeaway and it didn't taste right at all but I had someone else taste it and they said it was lovely.
23436,"Speaking only for the US, 58% of the total population and 70% of the adult population having at least one vaccine dose makes a HUGE difference in the ultimate course of the pandemic compared to a world without vaccines."
23437,"Actually the fatality rate of covid in the US is around 1.7 %

0.1% has never been a touted mortality figure so whoever you get your information from, you should probably check their sources."

23439,Except last year strangely enough.
23440,I'm so sorry to hear this.
23441,There's nothing I can really offer you except my sympathy.
23442,I don't blame your wife for panicking either -- I would do the same thing in her position.
23443,"This is what happens when people politicize public health, and children, the immunocompromised, and the elderly end up paying the price."
23444,:/
23445,I do not think the criteria have changed much.
23446,"There are still three categories, roughly defined by presence/absence of symptoms and presence/absence of a diagnostic test."
23447,I don't know if you're reading the document correctly.
23448,"Is your concern about the epidemiological component of the ""suspected case"" definition, and that that might carry over into the ""confirmed case"" definition?"
23449,"I don't know if that's the correct reading, and now that the epidemic is no longer centered on Wuhan, it's certain that no epidemiological link to Wuhan is required."
23450,"There might still be an epidemiological criterion for ""suspected cases,"" but I am certain that that requirement does not carry over to ""confirmed cases."""
23451,I saw a general guideline of one to two weeks from a spike in positive cases to a spike in hospital admissions.
23452,"Mid-August here is going to be rough, if that happens, as our positive cases are still on the upswing."
23453,Same.
23454,"My sister had a bad reaction to J&amp;J, so she says she wouldn‚Äôt get a booster."
23455,"I know others who have said the same while taking J&amp;J. I had no reaction to either shot of Pfizer, not even a sore arm so I‚Äôd get a booster yesterday if I could."
23456,I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll be able to convince her to take it if boosters become available.
23457,"&gt;and some models suggest ‚Äúas many as 35 million Americans may get infected over the next couple of months, the next few months,‚Äù according to the pandemic expert."
23458,"Some models do suggest this, however, IMO those models are not realistic."
23459,The key issue is how does one estimate how many of the unvaccinated have already caught covid and therefore have natural immunity.
23460,"If one thinks that number is very low, say 5%, then 35 million becomes a reasonable number."
23461,"However, if one assumes that number to be much higher, say 50%, then that 35 million is not realistic at all."
23462,"To be sure, nobody really knows, everybody is just guessing, but my intuition tells me that 18 months into the pandemic the number is likely to be closer to 50% than it is 5%."
23463,Exactly.
23464,Delta is the top dog for the moment.
23465,Nothing else kicking around currently looks like it can outcompete Delta.
23466,"Will see what the next few months holds, and what comes out of the swamps of Florida."

23468,But I wasn‚Äôt talking about the journalistic stylings.
23469,I pulled the excerpt from the quote of the doctor.
23470,As well as the other examples are from his quotes.
23471,"I‚Äôm not mad about the article, the article is fine."
23472,But it took 2 writings removed from the doctors quotes to get people who aren‚Äôt going to read the article all worked up.
23473,"That‚Äôs why I said, Reddit posters need to be better when posting these headlines because they are misleading a large group of people that won‚Äôt open the link."
23474,I think ignoring the long term effects of not being in school is short-sighted.
23475,It's not even just low wage workers.
23476,"My wife and I both have solid middle-incomes in our early 30s, with a 20-month old (who I got tested for covid yesterday because of a nasty cough and a nose running like a fountain) and we still need daycare."
23477,It's impossible for us both to work from home with a toddler around.
23478,"Further to that, I am expected to go back to work full-time on September 13."
23479,This truly affects everyone except the ultra-rich that can block themselves off from us plebs.

23488,"In the most [UK technical briefing](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf), 0.036% for under-50s (but their vaccinations here are skewed in age; it's higher for people in their 40s but there are not many such cases, and much lower in under-30s), and 5-6% for over-50s (which will again be skewed toward the older end of the range)."
23489,"This is CFR, so it remains unknown how many go untested (but in the UK they are testing very efficiently)."
23490,I hope so as well.
23491,Who knows what the next varrient will do.
23492,Yeah for sure that‚Äôs a part of it too.
23493,In other stuff dealing with breakthrough hospitalizations I‚Äôve seen the CDC put the number at around 25% of hospitalized cases are there for another reason and happened to test positive.
23494,But that‚Äôs all ages.
23495,"You feel a little crappy / get a cough, maybe the sniffles for a few days, and get better."
23496,This is the case for the vast majority of 'breakthrough' infections.
23497,As someone who ended up with Covid last year even with social distancing etc (and got vaxxed in April with Pfizer): congrats on getting vaxxed!
23498,"In some ways it might feel ‚Äúsafer‚Äù to do nothing/not get vaxxed, but with Delta running around you do not want to end up with Covid."
23499,As someone that had Covid- I wish I had been able to access the vaccine back in 2020.
23500,"""Four small studies cited by the CDC last month showed that 16% to 80% of people with weakened immune systems didn‚Äôt have detectable antibodies to fight Covid after two shots."
23501,"Among immunosuppressed patients who had no detectable antibody response, 33% to 50% developed an antibody response after receiving an additional dose, according to the CDC."""
23502,"WOW, just wow that's terrible news."
23503,Came for this.
23504,Great comment!
23505,!
23506,Black dolls as medical professionals with realistic hair?!
23507,Who‚Äôs running Mattel?
23508,Send that women flowers immediately!
23509,"Thanks for posting this, all my nieces are getting these for Christmas."
23510,I totally agree with you about the CDC.
23511,It's a love hate relationship.
23512,The CDC's goals are primarily aligned with public health interests and that doesn't always lead to great advise in preserving your personal health.
23513,"IMHO get vaccinated, wear a mask, and keep an eye on booster shot efficacy."
23514,Don't wait for the CDC to say it's a good idea.
23515,Look at the data yourself and see if it makes sense for your circumstance.
23516,Talk to your doctor and hold him to account for his answer.
23517,"TBF, on the other side of the argument, the immunocompromised are the most likely hosts to generate new variants."
23518,"Thank you for your reply, because of it I was able to find this article I hadn't previously seen https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/International/satellite-data-suggests-coronavirus-hit-china-earlier-researchers/story%3fid=71123270
which shows to me that there was an unnatural amount of traffic at the Wuhan hospital in October, something that would and later did cause alot of concern in many American city."
23519,"I see now that the virus came first and the genome sequence came 2nd, thank you for your help"
23520,I did not read anything.
23521,"I klistened to my government and many other governments whittled to downplay the virus to make sure people kept going to work, for the economy."
23522,I don't get how people say they want to scare us because they are doing the opposite.
23523,I didn't agree with them either because I personally know healthy people who ended up in the hospital.
23524,However you ate right that most in the hospital now are antivaxxers.
23525,But I do blame the motivation for antivaxxers slightly on some governments who indeed stated young people are not at risk.
23526,So their attitude for not vaccinating is fed by that a little atleast.
23527,Because it's obvious now that people don't give a shit about other people..
23528,This is her talking in retrospect and not wanting to sound dumb imo.
23529,"My guess is before she got sick, she was not saying the same thing to her friends."
23530,My family too.
23531,My mom thought she had just a cold until she lost her taste and smell.
23532,"She tested positive, and my wife also tested positive a week later."
23533,A few days later our baby (he's fine now) and then me.
23534,"My dad probably had it, he thought he had a cold a week before, but he didn't get tested until my mom did."
23535,"We all had congested sinuses for a few days, not too bad."
23536,"All of us are vaccinated (I think we all have Moderna, my parents might have Pfizer) except the baby."
23537,"""imagine how bad..."" No , because it's scary to think about

It's a game over situation"
23538,My wife is in China &amp; I was there in January/February 2020.
23539,(Perfect timing to get married eh?)
23540,She's been doing a lot of traveling and as of several months ago had almost 0 restrictions.
23541,There were known areas mostly along the border that she avoided that were struggling with some cases.
23542,This past week 1 person tested positive in her city coming back from a trip and they locked down the city of a few million people.
23543,"Everyone is getting tested, no new cases currently, expecting things to calm down in a few more days."
23544,I don't think they have an antidote.
23545,Aside from a small handful of people everyone is of a like mindedness of willing to make personal sacrifice of their time so that it doesn't spread.
23546,Are their numbers dishonest?
23547,I don't know.
23548,"Are they handling it different, yes."
23549,The cultural differences between Eastern and Western countries is making a difference in the outcome so far.
23550,How the USA is handling things wouldn't work in China and vice versa.
23551,They've had a few outbreaks but their reaction is always lock down and track everyone.
23552,It stays relatively contained to smaller areas instead of spreading outside.
23553,Last year apartment inroads were shut down to one entrance.
23554,You had to sign in/out.
23555,If you wanted to go farther away then local you had to inform the community at large so that they would know when you came back that you were supposed to quarantine and not have contact with the neighborhood.
23556,Small things like that probably wouldn't fly in Western Countries.
23557,I would like to get the Novavax vaccine as a third dose but I don't think it will be made available anytime soon.
23558,[removed]
23559,Many vaccines do eventually lose their efficacy and require boosters.
23560,But not all!
23561,And it can also depend on the person.
23562,You can have your blood tested for antibodies to see if you still have immunity to any of the stuff you got vaccines for as a kid.
23563,A vaccine could last a lifetime for one person and for someone else it wears off after 10 years.
23564,Ironically people like you are what makes people like me into people like you.
23565,I would literally stay in my house for a solid month if everyone else would and we could just kick this thing.
23566,But not everyone will.
23567,So there's no point for me to.
23568,And now I'm part of the not everyone will crowd
23569,We are hoping for them as well.
23570,"Some people try to dehumanize the unvaccinated, but these are good people paying giant consequences for not making a good choice."
23571,Please urge any of your loved ones (or strangers) to protect themselves.

23576,Can she get a third shot **right now**?
23577,We lose what?
23578,"Please develop

Hospitals are currently favoring COVID patients over other patients."
23579,It is unfair and this needs to stop.
23580,It made sense when getting COVID was a fatality.
23581,Now it‚Äôs people getting it because if their own decisions.
23582,Major difference.
23583,Everyone I've talked to who has gotten the vaccine in the past week got it now because of Delta.
23584,"Or, well, in the case of my 15-year-old step-nephew because his dad made him, but that was because of Delta."
23585,Everyone else in their family was already vaccinated.
23586,"The only reason this isn't a repeat of the massive hospital surges from last summer, fall or winter, is because of the vaccines."
23587,Imagine how bad this would be without them.
23588,The At Least It‚Äôs Not 2020 is also referring to the panic buying.
23589,At least we now have toilet paper.
23590,[removed]
23591,Time to mask up
23592,"Exactly, this explanation should be pinned at every article about children or young people."
23593,I have tried to explain this to people when you see children hospitalizations are up 450%!
23594,Well yeah it went from 2 to 11.
23595,On top of that we have no idea of the difference of FOR vs WITH.
23596,"As community spread increases and folks go to the hospital for other things and they test positive, they get counted as covid hospitalized."
23597,North Dakota is one of the few places that make this distinction and the number of people with covid has been about double the number for covid essentially halving their true covid patient count.
23598,"Long-term, we're probably looking at COVID-19 being endemic, and we'll likely have annual boosters like the flu shot."
23599,"In fact, you'll probably get it at the same time as the flu shot."
23600,"Vaccine uptake lags in black and brown minority communities, so it‚Äôs not a white privilege thing."
23601,Doctors as a group have done that to themselves via the AMA and their failure to certify more medical schools.
23602,This benefits established doctors because scarcity drives income.
23603,Any insight into why he was so upset?
23604,"Yes, since I received the vaccine, I've noticed that I'm less susceptible to a bad outcome from COVID."

23617,Why risk your life helping people who basically are drinking the koolaid?
23618,The only difference between this and Jonestown is that these Koolaid drinkers know it's poisoned.
23619,Just to clarify: This is really targeted at immunosuppressed populations.
23620,The WHO is still asking developed nations to hold off on 3rd shot boosters in order to distribute available supply to relatively poor and crowded nations where variants are likely to emerge.

23622,".00...1%)

We should try to stop spreading this misinformation."
23623,"Delta breakthroughs are fairly rare since the vaccine is very good at preventing infection, but not trivial or to be ignored if they do happen in the elderly."
23624,"According to the [UK's technical briefing](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf) page 18-19 the chance of an overnight hospital stay is 1/110 for fully vaccinated under-50s (good, but far higher than your number), and 1/19 for over-50s (not to be ignored)."

23628,What's not to understand?
23629,If everyone did that we could get rid of covid.
23630,But as the countries who did that soon learned the other places that didn't eventually reinfect you

23661,How old?
23662,Old enough to remember polio?
23663,"Because my grandparents remember.. they all knew this wasn't some hoax, and that the vaccine is a much better option than getting sick."
23664,It doesn't matter at this point.
23665,Delta is running high viral loads in vaccinated people.
23666,So mutations are gonna happen either way.
23667,"I‚Äôm only about a week out of quarantine, wife is over 2 weeks out (I caught it at the tail end of everyone else, despite mask/isolation)."
23668,It seems that our whole family (3 kids) have dodged any long effects.
23669,"We had some lingering tiredness for a few days, but it is hard to tell if that was illness related, or more due to 10 days of sitting around in a room."
23670,I‚Äôll admit after how insanely crappy I felt after the second shot I‚Äôm worried about getting a third lol.
23671,I know covid would probably be worse and it‚Äôs dumb logic but damn did that second shot mess me up
23672,"Where I live, mitigation efforts in School worked, but so many places, my area included, are not requiring masks or social distancing this year."
23673,"I'm lucky in that daughters class just happens to be one of the larger physical classrooms in the School, and because they were a 2-3 students above the mandated student maximum student to teacher ratios for Kindergarten, they added a 4th teacher/class, reducing the size from like 22-24, 15-16, so at least their specific classes can be socially distanced."
23674,"However, I'm  very concerned about how many may not be wearing masks, and low vaccination rates in my area."
23675,"Ultimately, the way contact tracing in my state works, I feel like there are going to be so many kids qaurintined, not to mentioned schools are already incredibly short staffed."
23676,"So we can only manage losing so many Teachers to qaurintine, I think it's just going to be a mess that interrupts in person learning."
23677,I got attacked on another thread for pointing this out.
23678,"Was told the quote literally from Moderna, was ""patently ridiculous"""
23679,I'm not sure that is possible with mRNA vaccines.
23680,"Logistically speaking, much of the developing world may not be able to adequately store and distribute them."
23681,"It's almost as if telling everyone to take their masks off with half the country unvaccinated and all of our young children unvaccinated (and now with maskless anti-vax boneheads in their face) was a very stupid idea, Mr. ""Expert"" Fauci."
23682,I had pretty much zero symptoms from both moderna shots.
23683,"Got lucky, I guess."
23684,[removed]
23685,India didn‚Äôt have the same access to the vaccine as the us so maybe masks and social distancing
23686,"Perhaps, but I was trying to explain the lingo of a journalist to you."
23687,This post is based on an article by CNN.
23688,So your statement when talking about ‚Äúpossibilities‚Äù is connected to the fact that CNN is required to write that way.
23689,"If the research does suggest a connection, it means the connection is there but needs further study to confirm it."
23690,"Anyway, cheers"
23691,"Yes, I also dont feel sympathy for those people."
23692,Sorry about that you are correct UK.
23693,Didn‚Äôt mean offense there.

23695,"Same here, first shot was no problem."
23696,2nd put me down for 2.5 days
23697,read the book.
23698,the revelant scene is intense.
23699,Hospitals should set COVID capacity something less than actual capacity to leave some space for other patients (or fully vaxxed COVID patients).
23700,"For example, up to 60% (making up a number) of the hospital's capacity can be used for COVID patients."
23701,"Once that number is reached, then ""sorry, we're full"" even if there are empty beds."
23702,Would you blame the BJP if it came from India
23703,[removed]
23704,Both my wife and myself were taken down for a weekend by the second shot.
23705,Luckily for us she was a week ahead of me getting hers so we were able to take care of each other.
23706,Yup.
23707,Still waiting for that second dose in a week or so.
23708,The biggest danger I see is that vaccinate people who catch covid and have mild symptoms will blame unvaccinated people and do everything they can to spread it to them.
23709,"If enough of these people with breakthrough cases start living their lives like unvaccinated people, our hospitals will be fucked."
23710,But if the hospital had to choose between caring for your MIL and caring for someone else who was vaccinated‚Äîif there were not enough resources for both‚Äîthey should pick that someone else.
23711,Your MIL very well could be the person who put some of those others into the hospital in the first place!
23712,"Hopefully, we don‚Äôt run out of resources, though."
23713,[removed]
23714,They are starting to do that in some places/countries.
23715,"&gt; you need the same number of syllables on each side of the comma

Perfectly balanced sentence"
23716,"Sure, but there‚Äôs no reason to assume that someone with a vaccine and a robust immune response that is keeping infection at an asymptomatic level, is also acting as a significant vector for infecting others."
23717,There are a few vaccines that can be given after the fact.
23718,"Off the top of my head, rabies is one."
23719,I think tetanus and chicken pox are occasionally also given after exposure to reduce symptoms.
23720,They need to be given in a very tight window of time though.
23721,But there's nothing to suggest that covid or the covid vaccine works like that and prevention is obviously the best thing.
23722,[removed]
23723,[removed]
23724,How much is that unvaccinated vs vaccinated?
23725,"If we hit 200K daily and the majority is unvaccinated, that just basically means COVID is on or in every square inch of space in existence?"

23765,To denounce the goodness of truth and love!
23766,"We're probably around 45% of the population previously infected, so that's also doing a lot of work to push R down."
23767,"To get 45%: [CDC estimated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) as of the end of May, we'd detected 1 out of ever 4.2 infections."
23768,"Multiple our cumulative detected cases by 4.2 and divide by the total population, that's 44.8%."
23769,It's worth noting that Covid ventilation has been worse than normal due to how high the machines have to be set to keep the patients O2 levels normalized.
23770,It is so frustrating to me that the emphasis on covid protection has reverted back to mask wearing even after we have THREE highly effective and safe vaccines on the market.
23771,The effort to get people vaccinated has been laughable at best and it seems those in charge have given up on that.
23772,It needs to be more inconvenient for people who aren't vaccinated (but have no reason not to be) to go about normal life.
23773,Companies requiring vaccination for their employees will push this in the right direction.
23774,"People love to say ""but what about those who can't get vaccinated because of health conditions???"""
23775,**this is 100% why these requirements are so important to them.

If the people who have no reason to not be vaccinated would get their shot, we would have a large enough percentage of our adult population vaccinated so that those who can't would be able to resume a more normal life with the rest of us."

23778,"In his words ""I hate being told what to do."

23962,"Most of the people in the ICU are there because of a stoke, heart attack or massive injury."

24107,"Not sure where to post this, but I found this very insightful understanding the relationship between the delta variant and vaccination rates."
24108,"For those that enjoy numbers, this is the (simplified) golden formula where scientific leaders make decisions about epidemic precautions:  


R = N \*(1-P\*V)

  
R is the reproduction rate where   
\- Less than 1.0 is a rate at which it will eventually diminish on its own."
24109,\- Greater than 1.0 is a virus that multiples exponentially in it‚Äôs current environment.
24110,"N is the natural reproductive rate of virus  
  
V is the efficacy of a vaccine  
  
P is the percentage of the population that is vaccinated and/or immune  
  
  
Chickenpox has an R of 10-12  
COVID Delta has an R of between 5 and 8  
Polio has an R of 5-7  
Smallpox has an R of 3-6  
COVID has an R of 2.9  
SARS has an R of 2-4  
Annual Flu is about 1.3  
  
So currently with 50% of the population vaccinated, say at a generous 95% efficacy:  
  
R = 2.9\*(1-.50\*.95) = **1.5225**; so the virus is still growing."
24111,"We would need to get to 69% vaccinated to be at 1.0  
  
With the delta variant:  
  
R = 6.5\*(1-.50\*.95) = **3.0875**   We would need to get to 89% vaccinated to be at 1.0."
24112,"However, other factors like masks, social distancing, natural antibodies, etc would also lower the R rating (and complicate the formula)."
24113,**This is why these preventable actions are being recommended again since our vaccination rates are not high enough at the current time to push R under 1.0.
24114,"**  


Looking back historically at other outbreaks, it took several years to get under control."
24115,"At our current vaccination rate, and needing about 80%+ of population being vaccinated against the Delta variant, it will likely taking 2-3 years in total."

24117,I thought it was crazy when I heard that Austin only had about 6 ICU beds available.

It's the sad truth for some people, including my grandfather."
24431,"It comes down to them soaking up any information they hear, but not being able to separate truth from lies."
24432,I'm curious as to why people who refused the vaccination should get priority care ?
24433,"Surely just stick them in a room somewhere and get to them when you get a second, don't waste time and resources on those people while others who did the right thing need care."
24434,"Looking like Delta Plus is gonna falter out too in lieu of Delta itself - I might be speaking too soon on that, but I think that sometimes we fall into this narrative of 'well the next variant will *definitely* be worse', when it works both ways."
24435,"Not that I'm not concerned, of course, but I wish the media wouldn't have this hyperbole problem - it would probably be easier to get people to have a healthy respect for the virus if they didn't do this all the time."
24436,Not not enough research yet but signs it may be more common.
24437,From my understanding presymptomatic spread is more common than asymptomatic.
24438,That being said the science on this could have changed by now.

24463,Studies from the UK have found the vaccinated at 50% less likely to catch any kind of delta infection.
24464,And that studied a population mostly using a less effective vaccine than commonly used in the US.
24465,Sp your base assumption is incorrect.
24466,Vaccination will lessen infection and thus lower the chances of variants.
24467,Further no one pays cash for the ICU.
24468,COVID is not a cheap way to die.

24560,I live in Florida and have a kid that is under 2 and can't be vaccinated.
24561,Our pediatrician advised to not go out until cases decrease to keep him safe.
24562,Under the Florida Constitution it technically is.
24563,"The problem is DeSantis has no longer declared Florida in a state of emergency, so he can't just willy nilly just mandate executive orders."
24564,"It's so wierd, I've always just assumed School Year means September to June."
24565,I live in Canada and it seems like the same for pretty much everyone I've come across from other (north hemisphere) countries.
24566,Funny to discover after all this time huge swaths of the US that have it different (and my grandmother lived in Florida!)
24567,"In my humble opinion, we should have been at that point since November."
24568,You guys need to see the double speak that is being used here.
24569,"There is likely to be a variant that is ""worse"" than delta meaning it infects more people."
24570,"However, that variant is also likely to not be as dangerous as delta when it comes to hospitalizations, and overall sickness."
24571,"He's not lying, but he's using misleading, and manipulative language in order to scare you."
24572,"I'm sorry, I don't completely understand what this means."
24573,Does this suggest that the current rise in cases we're experiencing is more of a blip rather than a sign of continued trends for the foreseeable future?
24574,Not trying to invalidate you at all I just have never seen graphs of this type before and I want to understand what's going on.
24575,President can't really do anything on this matter.
24576,Maybe could try doing a executive action to mandate things like masks but GOP in Florida would take it to court the second he signs it.
24577,"Wow, that's crazy!"
24578,"Or Hunter, or Obama"
24579,My company reenacted a mask mandate today and the announcement actually said masks would go back to being optional if the local case rate drops below 50/100k.
24580,That's based directly on the new CDC guidance.
24581,"Look into virtual public schools like K12, most states have these and are tuition free."
24582,I see one in Florida called connections academy
24583,"Lol, the source of the data you're providing [warns that a key statistic used to formulate ""active cases"" is ""highly imperfect""](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/about/), yet here you are accusing others of cherry picking data."
24584,&gt; Active Cases = (total cases) - (total deaths) - (recovered).
24585,"&gt; Recoveries = this statistic is highly imperfect, because reporting can be missing, incomplete, incorrect, based on different definitions, or dated (or a combination of all of these) for many governments, both at the local and national level, sometimes with differences between states within the same country or counties within the same state."
24586,Or he will be fired and treated like a Democrat by the rest of the party.
24587,"Get out and live your life already, quit hiding"
24588,"Except they didn't, hahaha, where are those piles of bodies on the streets and overrun hospitals?"
24589,Oooopsie
24590,"&gt;Los Angeles County has already reimposed a mask mandate for indoor public settings, which applies regardless of vaccine status."
24591,"The new ordinance, if adopted, would require that patrons have at least one vaccine dose in order to enter ‚Äúrestaurants, bars, retail establishments, fitness centers, spas, and entertainment centers such as stadiums, concert venues, and movie theaters.‚Äù



Good."
24592,Thoughts on lambda?
24593,"\&gt;why I'm messing with the dum dums

...no...you're just an asshole."
24594,Mine is easier.
24595,"It hasn't happened yet...so no proof needed to back my statement besides for ""I'm guessing"", and it's not fear mongering or alarmist."
24596,"But, we could look at differences between last winter and now:

1. vaccines
2. far higher community immunity (rhyming it up."
24597,"vaccine and naturally induced)
3."
24598,"4 more months to improve both of those things
4."
24599,"Children will also start being vaccinated by then

These are just some variables that will make it different than last winter, and are common sense based."
24600,"I have no studies to show that this will in fact help in the future, but it's sort of known thing."
24601,"So, do you like painting, pose as a ""whore"" for painting, or just do weird things with paint?"
24602,(username)
24603,Talk to your pediatrician!
24604,Why are you asking strangers on reddit what to do?
24605,This place is a fear machine.
24606,"Kids are, at least the vast majority, not at risk for severe cases or death from COVID."
24607,"Yes, it happens."
24608,"But the flu also kills kids, way more than covid, yet we still send our children to school every year."
24609,Talk to your pediatrician.
24610,"I did, and she put my mind right at ease."
24611,Doctor is from TX.
24612,Do not know where.
24613,"Basically: 

Writer is 57 and has a history of bad respiratory infections of different varieties."
24614,Didn‚Äôt want a chance with waning efficacy and walked into to get a third dose six months after their second Pfizer shot.
24615,Family made snide comments.
24616,Weighed the opinion of the WHO and decided getting a third shot was better than going into the trash.
24617,"Funny seeing things from the other side, we fled to Fort Worth when things started getting bad out west, came back a few months ago and now it‚Äôs looking like we might have to go back to Texas again"
24618,"Oh definitely, I think Doctors shouldn't bear the burden of deciding who is and isn't worthy of treatment."
24619,I see your point there.
24620,Must be hard if they even feel a hint of resentment towards their patients.
24621,And I wouldn't actually advocate for a system where people are sorted for care according to worthiness.
24622,It'd end up causing too strife and get politicized and stuff.
24623,Better to just focus on healthy citizenry through education and opportunities.
24624,"&gt;  It seems you were looking at data for only one dose

I wasn't, it's explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oxk3a6/vaccination_stops_half_of_delta_infections/h7o69dp/?context=3)."
24625,Vaccinated people need to understand they are still at risk against this Delta variant.
24626,Wear a mask and stay away from large crowds.
24627,We're still operating on this old narrative derived from Alpha data that said vaccinated people can move on from the pandemic.
24628,Delta has dragged us back in.
24629,"The good news is the vaccine is still very helpful, and brings the Rt to a number low enough that we can probably mitigate spread with only light social distancing like wearing a mask and reduced capacity."
24630,I don't see any severe lockdowns on the near horizon.
24631,But the point is vaccinated people need to quit acting like they've moved on from the pandemic.
24632,And is that over the 18 months of covid?
24633,Surely more kids had died over 18 mo after that flu season
24634,I don‚Äôt expect it to be eradicated.
24635,"I just want to get to the point where the threat of masks, shutdowns, etc doesn‚Äôt ever come up again."
24636,Good.. because I've already assimilated it into my system
24637,What is it with these fear-mongering Twitter accounts that have gotten more common recently?
24638,Their bios are always like ‚ÄúMom.
24639,Daughter.
24640,Progressive AF.
24641,*Insert occupation*.
24642,Nerd.
24643,Anti-DNC.
24644,Free thinker üåàüåà‚Äù.
24645,And these accounts always have like 10k followers.
24646,Anyone else notice this or is it just me?
24647,"And look, I agree shit is not ideal in regards to COVID."
24648,"But literally, these people just tweet all day‚Ä¶ like do they have no jobs?"
24649,Praise Fauci.
24650,Ramen.
24651,I don‚Äôt see an end to this tbh.
24652,At this rate it‚Äôs going to become a incurable supervirus
24653,That is exactly what my grandma told my mom.
24654,They got into a big argument on the phone about it.
24655,All she does is watch Fox news all day
24656,"Probably not ""literally zero"" because for India syringes and stuff were also limiting factors, but the total numbers are also low vaccinating only vulnerable zoo animals.."
24657,[removed]
24658,You have cvs near you

24662,"I found this difficult to read, and the tables and graphs unfriendly to the eyes."
24663,I applied my best copy&amp;paste abilities and compiled a Jack&amp;Jill bit below for the comparison between official Covid deaths and total excess deaths.
24664,"I think it is unfortunate that the time frames vary so much, but it still gives a clear picture which countries are serial underreporters of Covid deaths."
24665,"To keep things a bit shorter, I omitted micronations (as they have too much statistical coincidence) and several countries that have basically not suffered from Covid at all (at least during their reported time-frame), because there is nothing to see there (e. g. Australia, NZL, Taiwan, Uruguay)."

24756,"Instead, the most dire actual data they cited was that efficacy drops from 94% to 93% after six months."
24757,"Yeah, who cares if they suffer life-long consequences."
24758,Snoo-68727 is tired of hearing about it!

24761,"Short answer: Probably not, there's no reason to believe (and substantial reason not to believe) that somebody vaccinated six months ago has similar immunity to somebody who has yet to be vaccinated."
24762,Longer answer: We should avoid getting ahead of ourselves.
24763,Boosters haven't yet been recommended for groups outside the aged and immunocompromised.
24764,"In vaccines that have a booster, that doesn't necessarily mean you need additional boosters at that same frequency for the rest of your life."
24765,I think it's pretty unlikely twice annual boosters for covid will be recommended for healthy adults.
24766,It's called a vaccine because the first instance of using a disease to prime the immune system was for a pox called Vaccinia.
24767,That was used to develop the first smallpox vaccine.
24768,It was 95% effective but if since we were able to get enough people vaccinated we've now eradicated smallpox in the wild.
24769,Even if you had a vaccine that was 100% effective you would still need enough people taking it.
24770,Otherwise the remaining population can host enough of the virus and it will eventually mutated into a version that the vaccine isn't 100% effective against.
24771,"Aspirin, on the other hand, isn't a vaccine."
24772,It does absolutely nothing to directly affect the underlying disease.
24773,You can take all the aspirin you like and it won't keep you from getting a viral infection.
24774,We have many cases where an intervention works much better at the population level than at the individual level.
24775,A classic example is fire suppression.
24776,We have public fire services because when my neighbor's house catches on fire it's not good enough to just pour water on my house.
24777,I'll still get a lot of smoke damage and there's a high chance that my house will catch on fire.
24778,Instead we put out all fires to protect everyone collectively.
24779,Same here in my area.
24780,Sigh.

24788,"As a democrat, college graduate, urban resident woman, it was cool  (and made sense) to see all those near the top of already receiving at least one dose."
24789,"Some of my other demographic categories are closer to the bottom, but probably less aligned politically as those above so that makes sense (i.e."
24790,"insured under 65, age 30-49)."
24791,New variants are vacationing in Florida.
24792,The Gov welcomes all tourists including variants.
24793,"Yep, there's a fee add on for smokers, I see no issues with this."
24794,"Obviously, there needs to be a way for those who shouldn't be vaxxed (like allergy to an ingredient) to show it."
24795,This virus wrecked the Bronx and Brooklyn.
24796,"Despite the abysmal vaccine rate there, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the immunity rate is at 80% based on vaccine plus prior infections."
24797,"I will pray for you, bot."
24798,Wow.
24799,What a stark contrast.
24800,It‚Äôs scary to think that could have happened to you if the vaccine was not available.
24801,"UHC solves this problem, but of course the anti-vaxxers are also so stupid that they are the ""free enterprise is god"" people who don't get that because of the capitalist system they will now be paying more for insurance."
24802,"Man this pandemic has burned me out on stupid, ignorant moronic f-ers."
24803,"&gt; Roni Numa, the retired major general heading COVID-19 prevention operations at Ben-Gurion Airport, told the cabinet meeting that an immediate lockdown was the only thing Israel could do to contain the coronavirus."
24804,"Segal said that at this juncture, the government seems to be following Britain‚Äôs lead in the hope that Israel will also see a decline in contagion."
24805,"But if it fails, the only option left will be a lockdown because the number of confirmed cases is so high, he said."
24806,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills, because before March 2020, almost no experts advocated for lockdowns for diseases much deadlier than COVID, and now it's just something you have to do whenever serious cases rise above a certain level, even with vaccines."
24807,"Like the virus itself demands lockdowns, even though they weren't on the table for worse viruses."
24808,"How did we ever get along before 2020 without lockdowns, and why isn't anyone interested in learning from that?"
24809,"ok, thanks for the clarification, I first thought you meant you shed viral particles from being vaccinated, which was what I responded to."
24810,"Hell yeah bois sounds like my 1:17 THC:CBD cannatonic tincture that I've been acclimating my elderly dad to, might save his life."

24822,There are far far more people out there with asymptomatic or light symptoms who are just spreading this thing like crazy.

24827,"The vaccine, and to some extent prior infection, works."

24829,You don't need you own employees to do this.
24830,"I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in late March, and I found a pharmacy with ample vaccine supply that was not prohibited from granting a booster shot of an mRNA vaccine (Moderna) dose upon request several days ago."
24831,That dose hit me like a freight train.
24832,"Every symptom one could get from the Moderna vaccine, I got."
24833,I wonder if that's part of the reason the trial in this article is making the third dose half of the dose given for the first two shots.
24834,"In early trials, Pfizer had no funding in america through the warp speed program."
24835,Moderna and others did.
24836,"This is for the US only, though."
24837,yea but it will depend on region.
24838,"The Northeast has similar adult vaccination rates vs the UK for example, and US has also been vaccinating kids over 12, unlike the UK."
24839,"&gt; Should society pay for someone that has a known heart condition that has a heart attack after refusing to take their meds, change their diet, or improve their condition in any way?"
24840,"The answer is, yes, we do."
24841,And I'm okay with that because you're talking about big lifestyle things.
24842,"Sure, smoking is also a big lifestyle thing and if we are being honest, we might want to look at the efficacy of taxes (on packs of cigs) and surcharges for insurance into their efficacy of causing change."
24843,Because I'd rather have less smokers in this country than pay less for insurance (which is what non-smokers get when smokers have their own risk category).
24844,How's this relate to vaccines?
24845,Vaccines aren't a big lifestyle thing.

24888,It's pretty annoying that Biden is trying to pin this all on vaccine hesitancy when there was policy and policy that caused confusion and harm.
24889,They tried to incentivize people to become vaccinated by dangling the removal of masks to a group of people who had already ditched them.
24890,They also appear to have miscalculated the number of breakthrough infections leading to increased spread.
24891,You can't play games with a virus that has an R0 around 8.

24904,"**Article**

When the Milwaukee Bucks secured their first NBA championship win in 50 years two weeks ago, a sea of 100,000 fans roared outside the stadium in the city‚Äôs Deer District."
24905,"Those in the largely unmasked crowd jumped as they held up their phones, snapping pictures and recording the victory."
24906,"Now, the Milwaukee health commissioner says the event may be the common factor in a surge of covid-19 cases."
24907,"As of Tuesday, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services had identified almost 500 attendees who later contracted covid."
24908,"‚ÄúWe encourage anyone who has attended a large gathering, such as the watch party in the Deer District, get tested for covid-19 due to the increased risk of transmission,‚Äù Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said during a briefing Tuesday."
24909,"The news, first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, is the latest report of a possible outdoor superspreader event as the highly contagious delta variant spreads rapidly throughout the country."
24910,"An outbreak in Provincetown, Mass., which probably began during packed events over the July Fourth holiday weekend, resulted in almost 900 cases as of Friday, The Washington Post reported."
24911,"Public health experts have also expressed concern about Lollapalooza, the outdoor music festival in Chicago that took place last weekend."
24912,"Despite being outside, the packed crowds of 100,000 concertgoers per day could lead to a surge amid the contagious delta variant and growing rate of breakthrough cases among the vaccinated."
24913,"Many states, including Wisconsin, are seeing a stark uptick in coronavirus cases."
24914,"In the past week, daily reported cases rose more than 85 percent, with hospitalizations up by about 84 percent, according to The Post‚Äôs covid tracker."
24915,"With 56 percent having received at least one vaccine dose in Wisconsin, the number of daily administered doses has slowed."
24916,"In the past week, the average inoculations per day dropped 12 percent, according to The Post‚Äôs vaccine tracker."
24917,"To date, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services has identified 491 cases statewide in which the person infected attended the championship event in the Deer District, the health commissioner said Tuesday."
24918,The results have led the state to boost contact tracing; Johnson noted that the number of cases is probably far higher than recorded.
24919,"‚ÄúWe anticipated an increase in positive cases due to the delta variant, but \[a\] 155 percent increase in one week is distressing,‚Äù Johnson said."
24920,"As the Milwaukee Bucks made their way closer to the championship during the season, some Wisconsin health experts and community leaders had warned that large watch parties and celebrations could lead covid cases to surge."
24921,"‚ÄúIn terms of the Bucks event, there are a lot of people there and sometimes with celebratory events, sometimes we let our guard down,‚Äù Ruben Anthony, the president and chief executive of the Urban League of Greater Madison, told WKOW last month."
24922,Representatives for the Milwaukee Bucks did not immediately respond to The Post‚Äôs request for comment late Wednesday.
24923,Johnson noted that the uptick in cases across the state is not solely connected to the packed July 20 event outside the stadium but could still be traced back to Bucks watch parties.
24924,"‚ÄúPeople weren‚Äôt just attending events in the Deer District,‚Äù Johnson said."

25052,They probably started to see a similar signal in the early trial data that drove the expansion to improved the  signal to noise ratio in the data.
25053,I am hopeful they won‚Äôt wait in efficacy data and are only looking for adverse effects in the expanded trial.
25054,It is Frustrating but the IFR in children is low enough that powering the study to verify the vaccine in better than the disease is non trivial.
25055,hope our schools and universities do the right thing and offer remote options
25056,yeah they banned me lmao
25057,How long did it knock you out?
25058,Could you elaborate on that?
25059,Thanks.
25060,Hospitals have been doing it.
25061,After notifying staff that they have to be vaccinated by a certain date.
25062,Some senior executives have been fired in the last few weeks for refusing to vaccinate.
25063,See... but my action *isn't* rendering the sacrifice.
25064,I got the vaccine.
25065,I followed everything i was told.
25066,"Science and Fauci and our government are telling us they *recommend* wearing masks in certain situations, which I'll gladly do when necessary...but they don't see lockdowns as being necessary at this time as the main goal is vaccinations so....

Hmm.."

The headline isn't even misleading, just the OP's title."
25070,Was this necessary?
25071,"Contrarian POV: Absolutely, yes."
25072,There is a (seemingly increasing) segment of society that is completely incapable of learning that something is hazardous without first having experienced negative - possibly fatal - consequences firsthand.
25073,"Is it advisable to put a bullet in a cylinder of a revolver, put the barrel to one's temple and pull the trigger?"
25074,"Most people would say, ""no"" without giving it much thought."
25075,"However, there are those that will (correctly) point out that the majority of people trying that will be perfectly fine."
25076,"Besides, there are far fewer deaths from people playing Russian roulette than are killed by the flu in a typical year ..."
25077,"This is from 6 days ago:

https://www.kxan.com/news/coronavirus/hospitalizations/only-13-icu-beds-are-available-in-austin-region-state-data-shows/

It notes that in the Austin region, 6 days ago, only 13 ICU beds were free at all."
25078,"The surge is going to get much worse before it gets better, so I think OP is probably telling the truth."
25079,"More recent, Dallas county:
https://www.fox4news.com/news/north-texas-covid-19-hospitalizations-back-to-february-levels-as-delta-variant-spreads

19 beds available."
25080,"I'm sure these places are converting non ICU space to ICU space for surges, so the total bed number may be moving around a bit, causing some % utilization changes."
25081,&gt;99% of the current cases in the US are among unvaccinated people.
25082,"I'm really starting to wonder if that's true, when places like my county (Los Angeles) are reporting that 25% of our cases are in vaccinated people."
25083,[deleted]
25084,That October thing is believed to be a complete sham.
25085,"Logically,  there's no mechanic which would have made an October surge subside instead of continuing to grow."
25086,I've been collecting articles from people with breakthrough infections (anecdotal evidence) because I was wondering the exact same question: which vaccine is more effective?
25087,"At first, Moderna seemed to be slightly more protective, based on the statistical data from studies and I was really bummed that I got Pfizer (I was able to choose between the two)."
25088,"But from the articles I've read so far, there's been cases of breakthrough infections with both Moderna and Pfizer."
25089,"A couple of Moderna cases ended up in the hospital as well, so to me it doesn't seem like Moderna is more protective (at least not in absolute terms)."
25090,There's also been a few cases with Johnson &amp; Johnson and one with Novavax.
25091,Do you happen to have a link to that data?
25092,I am curious what the confidence intervals are around both of those numbers.
25093,It's possible that they are statistically the same but it depends on the sample sizes.
25094,Please include Abbott
25095,"Longer explanation - the antibodies and other immune cells that your body creates in response to the vaccine target various ranges of surfaces of the spike - the antibody only has to lock onto ""enough"" of the surface to disable it."
25096,"As such, when there is a mutation that changes the expression of the protein surface, antibodies that code for the changed section are no longer effective, but antibodies that code for other sections still are."
25097,"The end result of this is that with each mutation, the number of antibodies you have that can fight the new strain goes down, but it's incremental - a virus that has no common surfaces with the alpha's spike simply isn't Covid-19 anymore."
25098,You won‚Äôt find much disagreement from me in your rant about the American education system and it‚Äôs flaws.
25099,You want to improve schools and society?
25100,I‚Äôm right there with you.
25101,My concern is about children‚Äôs well being.
25102,Another year of virtual school could have such negative effects long term.
25103,"To me, children have sacrificed the MOST of any group during this pandemic."
25104,"Not being able to see their friends, family, go to school, go on trips, etc."
25105,that all adds up.
25106,There are other things in life that effects children‚Äôs health right now besides COVID.
25107,Let‚Äôs also calm down with the fear mongering here.
25108,I‚Äôm sure you know the chances of children getting COVID severely enough to DIE is almost non existent.
25109,Less than the flu and other things that we never even think about closing school for.
25110,"I‚Äôm sure the percentage of teachers being fully vaccinated are very high so again, this school year filled with death all over, is very unlikely."
25111,"&gt;obesity, heart disease, cancer

OMG, I wish there was a two shot vaccine to prevent these."
25112,I would happy take 6 shots and feel like crap for a couple of weeks to significantly lower my chance of dying of any of these.
25113,Do people that say the unvaccinated will start dying off truly think this is gonna happen?
25114,"In 2020 with no vaccine the deaths were leaning towards the upper age echelon and we sat at a 2% mortality, did delta up the mortality to 50% or higher and im clearly missing something or?"
25115,There‚Äôs not an agreed definition of ‚Äòtrue‚Äô deaths.
25116,Countries count deaths attributable to Covid very differently.
25117,"Even in my country (UK) there are frequently two numbers reported, deaths of people confirmed of having Covid, and those that mention Covid in the death certificate."
25118,With the former it also does lot mean you does of Covid.
25119,"If you have Covid and then died 3 weeks later by getting hit by a bus, it‚Äôs included as a Covid death."
25120,A better measure across countries might be to use excess deaths.
25121,I.e how many more deaths than ‚Äònormal‚Äô.
25122,"But even here there will be issues, as what is ‚Äònormal‚Äô?"
25123,"Death rates vary each year, is all variance in 2020/21,due to Covid?"
25124,There's several people i work with like this who have explicitly stated this.
25125,It's maddening.
25126,So in my experience this is already handled with health care premium discounts for good behavior.
25127,Don‚Äôt smoke?
25128,You get a discount.
25129,Complete a wellness initiative like a nutrition program or whatever?
25130,Discount.
25131,Pointedly my insurance has already said you get a discount next year if you get the vaccine.
25132,Discounts for good behavior seem to be legally perceived better than increases for bad behavior even if the cost nets out the same.
25133,Glad they only had mild symptoms!
25134,Do they know how they were infected?

25156,Where's the mRNA vaccine that encodes for the delta variant spike protein?
25157,They should be pumping that out yesterday.
25158,"(Yes I know it would still need to go through approval, but let's get on it)."
25159,"By the time we're taking our 3rd booster we'll be on to the sigma variant and the ""wildtype"" vaccine will have a 30% efficacy."
25160,Then they'll tell us we need a 4th...
25161,"Oh, you didn't have it too bad."
25162,"I had to hear masks cause facial deformities, need for dental surgery, and even urinary tract infections."
25163,"I think the suggestion was more ""dont treat unvaccinated COVID patients"" than ""order more supplies""."

25171,I had Pfizer double dose and also tested positive a few weeks ago.

25209,"According to UK's ""technical briefing"" data, mRNA vaccines reduce infection by 88% (this is probably an overestimate; US data is more like 80%) and severe outcomes by something like 3.5x in breakthrough cases."
25210,"The level of protection is very high, but not perfect."
25211,"In particular, this means old people are still *far* more at risk than under-25s."
25212,"For kids the IFR seems to be somewhere between 1/10,000 and 1/100,000 (comparable to or a bit worse than chickenpox)."
25213,Whereas the UK over-50 fully-vaccinated CFR  is 1.3%; vaccinated CFR for people ~30-50 is 0.036%.
25214,Remember that CFR is only after the 80% protection against infection fails - the risk is low but definitely still worth reducing.

25232,You are aware how many Covid variance there are correct?
25233,How on earth can we have legitimate studies at this point in terms of how many people with the virus can actually still spread it?
25234,You can‚Äôt just do one study and act like it answers all the questions there‚Äôs so much more going on than that.
25235,Let‚Äôs say that Covid stops the spread by 50% although we have no idea if this is true at all and there‚Äôs reason to believe by a lot of people that it‚Äôs not.
25236,This will not help us get to herd immunity.

25261,i get what you're saying... that this vaccine isn't providing sterilizing immunity.
25262,And therefore those who're un-vaxxed can readily get infected.
25263,"Definitely there's some truth to that, and there's a huge concern among parents as they send their kids back to school in the next 3 weeks."
25264,"But in terms of the tragedy that's unfolding in hospitals in hot zones, it's mainly unvaxxed adults who're being hit."
25265,They rolled the dice &amp; refused the shot believing that everyone else around them would get vaxxed and insulate them from infection.

25344,"Lambda, Epsilon, and Delta Plus all have been around and unable to compete where Delta is circulating, which immediately suggests Delta is a fitter variant."
25345,"Nobody is suggesting new variants can‚Äôt emerge, but it will unlikely be Lambda, Epsilon, or Delta Plus"
25346,Uninsured under 65 is the largest subgroup of unvaccinated.

25352,You are 100% correct in that even if the US was vaccinated to the last person delta would have still come in.
25353,What he knows and wants to say is the current hit on the US could have been prevented in that if we had heavy vaccination numbers the hospital overloads wouldn't be happening now.
25354,"&amp;#x200B;

However, he's playing to an audience who believes crazy things and won't take it at all so the statements have to stay in headline fashion."
25355,"Essentially, the right is in arms around buzzwords and a lack of ability to understand deeper statistical trends has to be played to."
25356,These are calculated statements being made by POTUS and it's probably more frustrating for him to say it that way than it is for us to hear.

25358,Want.
25359,Now.
25360,"The epsilon variant originated in California in January, as far as I know."
25361,And I'm sure there have been other minor variants throughout the country that never gained traction.
25362,"Unvaccinated countries will continue to be a big risk factor, but the US is capable of generating variants as well."
25363,Who said this is the way to do it?
25364,Seriously.
25365,Maybe it‚Äôs time to revisit this a little bit.
25366,Even the doctors and nurses are sick of this.

‚ÄúData on hospitalizations and deaths do not reflect delta variant, cdc director says‚Äù"
25373,"The Wuhan Institute of Virology didn't discover sars-cov-2, the wuhan hospital system did when people kept showing up with ""sars-like pneumonia""."
25374,The case and hospital surge in Wuhan months before it happened anywhere else is why we assume the virus either emerged or mutated very near by.
25375,What about those who already had the original covid?
25376,Sounds like a threat‚Ä¶
25377,That is almost certainly a contributing factor.
25378,"On the bright side, I think telling other antivaxxers they are wrong and sharing their story is the best thing an antivaxxer can do after getting the virus."
25379,Every article hopefully increases the chance of persuading someone to get the shot even if it‚Äôs a small amount.
25380,5 months into mine and I got covid
25381,And?
25382,We aren‚Äôt going to booster shot the world every 6 months.
25383,"Not remotely feasible or possible, and as a matter if fact, that‚Äôs a bad thing."
25384,"The boosters may be needed for IC and elderly after a period of time, not everyone."
25385,Huh?
25386,"I already said she tested negative multiple times, and also this isn't about me."
25387,The fact of the matter is that young healthy people are in  the hospital all over the world.
25388,"Which, cording to governments, wasn't something to worry about."
25389,My first shot was in December üôÉüò≥
25390,Thank you.
25391,Very much.
25392,"True, but lets be honest the CDC's goals are primarily in the interest of public health and that doesn't always lead to great advise in preserving your personal health."
25393,They should be furious with the people that misinformed them.
25394,It‚Äôs also fine to bad mad at themselves but don‚Äôt let others off the hook either.
25395,"Aww, thanks!"
25396,Lyme has done what no man could...keeping a good woman down!
25397,I know everyone in my life is exhausted over my rants but I can't imagine anyone living my life.

25404,Definitely shouldn‚Äôt be prioritizing covid patients at this point unless they were immuno-compromised or had some other legit reason to not get vaccinated.
25405,Anybody who chose not to get vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt be taking medical capacity away from other patients.
25406,What would happen if the mayors of Dallas or Houston declared a mask mandate?
25407,Is that a criminal act under the governor‚Äôs executive order?
25408,To an extent.
25409,I don't like the slippery slope fallacy because we are intelligent creatures capable of drawing distinctions between different situations.
25410,Smoking and obesity are easily quantifiable metrics that have a profound impact on your healthcare cost.
25411,"Taken from [this article](https://www.ehstoday.com/health/article/21915059/study-obesity-surpasses-smoking-in-employee-health-care-costs):

&gt;&gt;Smokers, for example, carried average health costs that were $1,275 higher than those for non-smokers."
25412,"But the incremental costs associated with obesity were even higher: $1,850 more than for normal-weight individuals."
25413,"For those with morbid obesity, the excess costs added up to $5,500 per year."
25414,"(According to the Mayo Clinic, individuals with a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher are obese; those with a BMI of 40 and higher suffer from extreme, or morbid, obesity.)"
25415,Not every difference in lifestyle has to be accounted for just because these are.
25416,We already have an exception in the ACA for smokers to have increased insurance premiums.
25417,It's not a profound idea to apply that to voluntary obesity and voluntary vaccine avoidance during a global pandemic.
25418,And it might provide some incentive for people to improve their lifestyle during our obesity epidemic.
25419,Either they are completely incorrect or there‚Äôs some miscommunication and you might not be understanding exactly what they‚Äôre referring to.
25420,Most of the data I listed above explicitly is in reference to the Delta variant.
25421,"Ever see ""Wag the Dog""?"
25422,"My position right now is, I was super sore for 48 hours after first moderna dose."
25423,I didn't get chest pains but my pulse was elevated for a few days after that.
25424,I don't have insurance.
25425,"Very likely had a massive panic attack/cardiac infarction/mild heart attack end of January, no clue what it actually was."
25426,"I don't want to die of delta, I don't want to die of the vaccine."
25427,There is always a 1% chance of almost anything.
25428,"I don't actually believe the governments of the world already instituted social credit scores with AI, and are currently in the process of removing a collection of dissidents and undesirables, but............."
25429,"I only took moderna so I don‚Äôt know about Pfizer, but it did put me into bed for about a day and a half with body aches."
25430,But it was ok because I knew I wasn‚Äôt really sick.
25431,Just treated it as 2 days off for catching up on Netflix.
25432,[And theeeennnnn..... ](https://youtu.be/oqwzuiSy9y0)
25433,"Line me up, double safe triple safe."
25434,Lol with the amount of garbage we all put into our bodies in young adulthood this can't be any worse.
25435,"i got the moderna vaccine and got covid a few months later, so stay safe out there regardless"
25436,Yes.
25437,Because the vaccine has been shown to be at least 50% effective.
25438,1 in 26 fully vaccinated people get the virus.
25439,That's the hard numbers.
25440,1 in 13 unvaccinated people get the virus.
25441,Hard numbers.
25442,So vaccinated = less likely to spread the disease.
25443,Because they're less likely to get sick in the first place.
25444,Well then in that case only allow the unvaccinated in businesses that choose to freedom of choice who they can serve.
25445,"You can't ostracize people from society like that bud, they are only doing what they feel.is best for themselves."
25446,"This is very, **very** likely the case for all the current vaccines."
25447,"Vaccines are NOT intended to prevent you from getting infected, though due to their incredible efficacy they do to a pretty good degree with covid-19."
25448,"Antibodies wane over time (which is good, having high antibody titers all the time is actually bad for you), but your immune system still remembers how to make them when needed."
25449,"So you get a mild infection, feel a little lousy and within a couple days your body makes enough antibodies to fight off the virus."
25450,Exactly what happened with the one breakthrough case in someone I know.
25451,"They got what was basically a cold, and despite having been at a party with (all vaccinated) friends, none of the others got sick / tested positive, including his GF."
25452,He's making it up - it sucks for morons who aren't vaccinated and children or people who literally can't get vaccinated - but vaccines have and continue to work even if there's small n strange situations (literally gay bear sex week) that cause a different situation.
25453,"And
Why the hell should I alter my life for people that choose not to get vaccinated?"
25454,You're not going to find any of those in a survey; they're just far too rare.
25455,"You only hear about them as anecdotes from ""this one guy"" who's ""a friend of a friend of a friend""."
25456,Since getting vaccinated I finally decided to let my Achilles heal and stopped running for 3 months.
25457,I also started drinking alcohol again while continuing to weightlift and gained 10+ pounds.
25458,"If your body isn't challenged by covid exposure, your anti body (but not memory cell) count goes down."
25459,So your body has to ramp back up to fight.
25460,You can only be on Ashley for so many things at a time and your body prefers recent exposure.
25461,Difference between an army ready to go all the time and reserves you need to call up.
25462,"So you can't stop initial infection, but you can repel borders."
25463,True.
25464,Whatever camp they're coming from I'm glad that they are at least rolling up their sleeve for those who can't just quite yet.
25465,I got my second dose in February.
25466,The legal profession was allowed priority status in Alabama.
25467,"At the time, I felt a little guilty since I was taking a dose when people who might need it more didn't."
25468,"But now I'm looking at Alabama's 30% vaccination rate (though it has improved recently, thank goodness) and realized that I wasn't taking a dose away from anyone."
25469,I was just helping protect the unvaccinated.
25470,How do they know you have or have not been vaccinated?
25471,Access to medical records?
25472,[deleted]
25473,Exactly I spent $60 with insurance to be seen and told I'm fine last week.
25474,I was grateful but now I will have to be dying before I make another appointment.
25475,"The irony is that a venn diagram of antivaxxers and people that say ""why should I pay for someone else's healthcare"" has a significant overlap."

25478,"In theory,  yes schools should obviously close."

25480,Cram kids into daycare?
25481,That's no safer than school.
25482,"This is just one of those problems with no good solutions,  unfortunately."
25483,"My friend works for Boys and Girls club and said they're busier and more crowded than ever before,  for obvious reasons."
25484,Parents need a place to bring their kids while they work.
25485,"And while the debate rages on and on about the safety of teachers and faculty as we consider opening schools,  not one word about the low wage workers who've been picking up the slack this entire time."
25486,My parents in the UK are scheduled for a booster.
25487,I don't think the so in the US though.
25488,Oh my gosh!
25489,That is exactly who the poster was talking about I bet.

25503,"So if they shouldn‚Äôt help people who are moronic, should they deny care to the diabetics who don‚Äôt stop eating sugar or the cardiac patients who chose fatty foods?"

25505,Most health problems in this country are preventable but for some reason the unvaxxed are demonized.

25544,This online environment is extremely taxing on these kids.
25545,Highschoolers that started in 2018 graduate next year and in some places they only got to see a classroom for one semester of highschool.
25546,Some children start kindergarten/first grade without even knowing how a real school functions and those kids are gonna be 3rd and 4th graders within the next year.
25547,College students may have a different story since they had the option to stay home or live on campus.
25548,"However, there are several students that either come to the US for school or go to a different state for school knowing NO ONE and have gone through half of their college career without knowing anyone."

25618,"Imagine being a responsible human being that was vaccinated and took all precautions, and now they won't receive the proper care for any other issue they may encounter health wise."
25619,It‚Äôs probably a very slow decline past 6 months.
25620,"Like you‚Äôre most protected shortly after getting the vaccine, and then for the average person, after six months the antibodies that remain still leave you about 93% protected, and from there it‚Äôs a slow decline (we‚Äôre shortly past the six month mark of people being vaccinated anyways, how can they know anything past that?)"
25621,I agree with this whole heartedly.
25622,The videos coming out of Italy last spring were very powerful and a strong driver of helping with mask compliance and pushing people to stay home.
25623,At this point a lot of people refusing the vaccine are driven by their instincts towards personal liberty over collective caring for people they do not know.
25624,The only effective means to convince someone in that mindset is for them to see Covid as a personal threat to them or their family.

25854,"Just to be clear, I fully support getting vaccinated as soon as one possibly can, this is just trying to put ourselves in other people's shoes and understanding why they might be hesitant."
25855,"Also, you seem to have failed to read my entire point regarding paycheck to paycheck."
25856,The time off to get the shot is OBVIOUSLY NOT what I referred to.

25936,"They're already way more effective than we expected them to be this time a year ago and now suddenly to a chunk of the population, that's not good enough."

But instead, does news like that coming out of Israel (a vaccine success story yet in the midst of a new COVID-19 wave) point to premature lockdown endings and poor masking causing this possibility?"
25941,Should?
25942,"From what I've seen the data suggests yes, but definitely the kind of thing she should ask her doctor for a recommendation on before doing, at least until there's official guidance."

26028,I agree with the slippery slope especially since our food system is screwed up six ways from Sunday.
26029,"Sugary, fat-filled foods are cheaper for those making just minimum wage."
26030,"A diet of nothing but Ramen (which is really high in salt unless you eat it without the flavor packet) will show weight gain but is not nutritious diet to encourage a healthy diet thus adding weight and increasing the risk of disease and the elephant in the room that people are not talking about is exercise will NOT 100% make you healthy, you have to eat right, Have to have a good mix of the macro Protein, Carbs, and Fat, not just one category and exercise."
26031,Exercise will actually give healthy issues if you are not ingest the right amount of protein to allow the body to recover from muscle stress and you will not be able to exercise long without the right amount of carbs for quick starting energy.
26032,Fats help your blood stay fluid as well as we are finding out it helps with nerve impulses.
26033,Your brain uses fatty acids as fuels BEFORE protein (though not a long is needed compared to muscle tissue).
26034,We need to adjust our food system and make raw unprocessed foods cheaper before we ding people on insurance for obesity.
26035,"We can keep processed foods but they do not need the levels of sodium and fat that are in them, even for flavor."
26036,"I try to challenge people who fight against reduced fat and salt for flavor reason (it is BS I know, they do porn for the ""story""), by challengeing them to try different herbs and spices."
