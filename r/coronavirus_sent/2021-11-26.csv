0,Schools for minors should be prioritized to keep in person.
1,We should be closing down large gatherings and putting mask mandates for indoors in place before we shut down schools.
2,Well that would never happen with privacy laws and all.
3,Maybe I didn’t make it clear that I was being optimistic.
4,&gt;	This literally would be the variant to end the pandemic...
5,IF it can hold on as the strongest variant out pacing every other variant.
6,"That’s only if it actually is less severe than delta, which is just pure speculation at this point."

13,"Since I am now eligible for my booster, does it make sense to wait for the data behind the current protection towards this variant?"
14,"To be honestly, I am not worried either way but rather wait."
15,"Im so afraid of this damn virus, for me, my family, my friends."
16,"The hospitals are getting crowded again, people die even though we could prevent it by just getting vaccinated."
17,It’s so frustrating
18,And what would the “new appropriate forces” in this analogy be?
19,"Oh hell yes an A&amp;C reference, thanks"
20,"Would like to point out that transposing numbers is not uncommon, especially among people with varying degrees of dyslexia; doesn't mean OP didn't read the article."
21,Looking at the data coming out of Gibraltar the vaccines don't seem to really help that much in preventing spread.
22,However they seem to be good at preventing death.
23,Of course this isn't from the new variant.

31,So why is the media causing a frenzy now?
32,If your vaccinated there’s no point in wearing a mask.
33,It’s all bullshit
34,Gottleib retweeting a ton today.
35,"Another thing he likes seeing is IN THE VERY SMALL SAMPLES that South Africa has, the majority of hospitalizations from Omicron are unvaccinated."
36,"Which once again could add to the feeling that vaccines will likely offer at least some protection from it, that it's not fully resistant."
37,"[**Dutch media now reporting**](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5270083/zuid-afrika-veldbedden-schiphol-quarantaine) (article is in Dutch) that test results from the two impounded flights are being released, and 15 out of 110 so far processed have tested positive for COVID."
38,This works out to a 13.6% positivity rate -- apparently 85 cases overall if that ends up holding for the full passenger count of both planes.
39,Testing will continue to see which variants are present in the samples.
40,"Meanwhile, [**the Times correspondent reports**](https://twitter.com/snolen/status/1464384849792356369) that even having received this knowledge, a third of the passengers still refuse to wear masks and the whole lot of them remain crammed together 12 hours after arriving."
41,"Good luck out there, everyone."
42,"Fuck stop already, Earth"
43,"If it remains “as” deadly that’s still not bad because then we’re just basically dealing with more of the same, not worse infections."
44,[removed]
45,If only more people takes the vaccine it would be worthwhile
46,It takes a day or 2 for T and B cells to start making anti-bodies from what I've read.
47,I would assume this would also change depending on the health of the infected.
48,yeap.
49,taking the whole world down with her.
50,I believe it is second shot
51,"prepare for the worst, hope for the best."

53,Exactly.
54,Still cheaper I’m guessing to have staff working from home.
55,In Hong Kong hospitalization doesn’t translate into severity - anyone tested positive has to be hospitalized.
56,Even asymptomatic people (as in this case) have to be hospitalized due to protocol
57,I’m so freakin bummed and hopeless about all of this
58,[removed]
59,Should I wait to get the booster in a few days?
60,Looks like it’s needs a bit more ingredients now.
61,"The ""Omicron"" variant was already detected and talked about in July in S. Africa, so it has been around for a while."
62,This is another signal that at the beginning of this year S. Africa's seasonal COVID cycle (i.e.

87,It’s for crowds: “Paris has made the wearing of face masks outdoors mandatory again at public gatherings.
88,"Masks will have to be worn for gathering in public spaces, at festivals and spectacles, on markets and when standing in line.”"
89,"&gt;Scientific experts at the World Health Organization warned on Friday that a new coronavirus variant discovered in southern Africa was a “variant of concern,” the most serious category the agency uses for such tracking."
90,"&gt;The designation, announced after an emergency meeting of the health body, is reserved for dangerous variants that may spread quickly, cause severe disease or decrease the effectiveness of vaccines or treatments."
91,"The last coronavirus variant to receive this label was Delta, which took off this summer and now accounts for virtually all Covid cases in the United States."
92,&gt;The W.H.O.
93,"said the new version, named Omicron, carries a number of genetic mutations that may allow it to spread quickly, perhaps even among the vaccinated."
94,"&gt;Independent scientists agreed that Omicron warranted urgent attention, but also pointed out that it would take more research to determine the extent of the threat."
95,"Although some variants of concern, like Delta, have lived up to initial worries, others have had a limited impact."
96,Anyone else feel like over the last two days the whole world just kind of collectively gasped
97,I mean the pandemic will eventually become an endemic.
98,"It’s not being a downer, it’s how it is."
99,"Honestly, I knew Lambda and Mu were hoax and lived my life as usual."
100,I have a bad feeling about this one.
101,"At least, it looks like they are ahead of the game this time and we won't be in a complete lockdown like we were before."
102,Realistically the world can't afford another one of those.
103,We cannot lockdown everytime there is a new variant.
104,I am a healthy 28 year old and if it kills me it kills me.

109,"I think the goal is probably to slow the spread, not to stop it."
110,If you prevent people from moving around it helps.
111,Legit question: I’m vaxed and I’m sure you and others in your fam are as well so why would you care?
112,Or why would I care?
113,Afaik the vax already defends against the vast majority of the strains.
114,And on top some are now getting booster shots.
115,Shouldn’t we just get on with our lives already?
116,"You go to an event, venue or restaurant and you clearly can see that no one cares anymore."
117,The ONLY place that people care to put a mask on and protect themselves is during travel and airports.
118,I’ve seen this first hand many times.
119,How long do we legitimately have to “unlax”.
120,This virus is significantly less dangerous and its mutating to spread not to kill.
121,"So again, why should anyone care?"
122,Imho this is yet another flu (put simplistically).
123,I’m tired of the mask mandates and all.
124,"No one wears em inside and if you think ppl do, don’t bother replying."
125,I’ll go as far to say that I don’t care if people vaccinate anymore as well.

192,"I'm wondering this, too."
193,I've always been skeptical of those who say flying is relatively safe for the virus.
194,The potential ability to escape aquired immunity is most concerning.
195,"30 mutations from vanilla Sars2 in just the spike protein, 10 of which are in the 200ish amino acid section that antibodies mostly bind to are what is driving these travel bans, and is causing so much more concern than other variants at this stage of their emergence."
196,So I wouldn’t really panic right now.
197,The absolute worst case is the current vaccine doesn’t work at all (which we don’t even know yet) and it’s as infectious/deadly as Delta.
198,Pfizer already said they could get a new one approved in 100 days which was the great point of mRNA.
199,And you could start manufacturing it before it’s even approved.
200,You then use the Pfizer pills in the mean time which I believe still should work as they also worked on SARS 1 virus particles as a protease inhibitor.
201,We can only hope right.
202,At some point it should start shifting towards a less serious respiratory infection but we never studied a coronavirus evolution live like this.

237,Remember when New York got its first case Feb 29th 2020.
238,"Then we traced it back, and we really had cases in December 2019."
239,Kinda like that.
240,What do you mean vaccine resistant?
241,Vaccines may have lower efficacy against Beta but it’s not vaccine resistant.
242,If CNN is reporting that then they are exaggerating.
243,"uhhhh 13% test positivity on a somewhat random population that felt healthy enough to travel is insane.... thats like the test positivity you normally see amongst symptomatic people in a city going through a surge 

we haven't seen anything like this ... hopefully the final number comes in lower or theres some confounding factor like half the plane was part of the same tour group or something."
244,I thought no one knew much about it yet...will this be covid all over again like it was beginning of 2020?

257,No *reported* cases.

261,Right?!

268,...
269,It's a mask.
270,Why are you so scared of a mask?
271,"has there been a single confirmed case in the US, let alone NY?"
272,"it's likely already in the US, but it definitely is not widespread yet."

275,Go away.
276,"The risk is much lower than the second dose; measured at 1/50,000 of inflammation in Israel."
277,Get Pfizer - it's a lower dose than Moderna.
278,It is way too early to call how vaccine resistant this variant is or isn't.
279,I mean this thing hasn't been sequenced much since a few days ago..
280,Very little evidence to make that conclusion.
281,"I obviously won't make any solid decisions here, just want to get an idea of what's going on."
282,My body makes basically no IgG antibodies due to a condition I have.
283,I get sick as hell from any respritory illness that goes around.
284,Just wanna be cautious
285,I get where you are coming from.
286,I’ve tried to think of this like a wartime response.
287,Would I have put up with rationing and sacrifice for four plus years?
288,"If so, why shouldn’t I endure the inconvenience and challenge that is still less than two years?"
289,"What’s hit me is that the rationing and similar sacrifices were, to the best of my knowledge, broadly accepted and followed efforts."
290,"There were some jerks who tried to get around them, but people generally banded together."
291,This time there is a significant divide in how many people are willing to cooperate and work together.

381,Should I get a booster?
382,"I was going to, but it gave me a warning that males in my age group have an increased risk of heart issues from a booster?"
383,25 and otherwise healthy.
384,Had covid about a year ago and also fully vaccinated.
385,[removed]
386,[removed]
387,&gt;Legit question: I’m vaxed and I’m sure you and others in your fam are as well so why would you care?
388,Or why would I care?
389,"Personally, it’s because it’s still killing people and I have empathy, and because I’m at risk and care for others that are as well."
390,Because people are suffering the effects of long covid.
391,Because it’s impacting the medication system meaning I (and others) can’t get the care required for health issues.
392,Because there’s plenty of people in the world who haven’t had the opportunity to get vaccinated yet.
393,It’s possible part of the reason Omicron developed is because of that in fact - there’s an inverse relationship between covid19 mutations and vaccinated numbers within a population.
394,Point is: there’s plenty of reasons to care.
395,&gt;Afaik the vax already defends against the vast majority of the strains.
396,"You’re correct, to an extent."
397,"But vaccines aren’t 100% and long covid is a real, debilitating condition."
398,It is safely assumed that this variant has even more immune escape than Delta.
399,&gt;Correct me if I’m wrong here but can’t they just make a new vax that detects these different mutations like the same day now?
400,"Vaccines don’t detect viruses, they prep your body to recognize them."
401,Moderna released a statement saying they can get a new booster developed within 60-90 days.
402,That’s one of the advantages of mRNA technology.
403,"Pfizer released a statement as well, though I have yet to read it."
404,&gt;Shouldn’t we just get on with our lives already?
405,"You go to an event, venue or restaurant and you clearly can see that no one cares anymore."
406,The ONLY place that people care to put a mask on and protect themselves is during travel and airports.
407,I’ve seen this first hand many times.
408,"The fact we have events held at venues, restaurants are open, have air travel, etc… how exactly are we not “getting on with our lives already”?"
409,&gt;How long do we legitimately have to “unlax”.
410,No one knows.
411,"It sucks, I know."
412,My life and many others are upside down and have known great loss.
413,"I can tell by your frustration that this has negatively impacted your life too, and I’m sorry."
414,"Sometimes things drastically change circumstances for an entire generation/s (disease, war, revolutions, etc)."
415,"They almost become a “filler” generation, so to speak, and it’s not until the next comes along that things get back to the same level of normalcy."
416,It’s as unfair as it gets.
417,But it does happen.
418,I hope this passes and isn’t our case.
419,&gt;This virus is significantly less dangerous and its mutating to spread not to kill.
420,It is unknown whether Omicron is more lethal.
421,"&gt;So again, why should anyone care?"
422,Imho this is yet another flu (put simplistically).
423,I’m tired of the mask mandates and all.
424,"No one wears em inside and if you think ppl do, don’t bother replying."
425,I’m not sure why this comparison is drawn.
426,"Covid19 is not, nor has ever been, the flu or like it."
427,I can assure you that that everyone is tired of mask mandates.
428,&gt;I’ll go as far to say that I don’t care if people vaccinate anymore as well.
429,They’re idiots.
430,I’m done giving a damn.
431,"We can’t stop the world for idiots to vaccinate, that’s insane."
432,"I am frustrated with antivaxxers too, trust me."
433,But we’re not stopping for them.
434,Vaccines have NOT been enough to hinder this thing since Delta.
435,And it will likely be worse with Omicron.
436,Other measures are required as well.
437,Also Ebola is ugly af.
438,If Covid made Americans ugly all the antivaxxers would be lining up for shots.
439,this new African variant isn't what NY is concerned about right now.
440,it's going to take time for it to get here and spread.
441,"the problem right now is still the Delta variant, which is being spread in NY right now during this holiday weekend."
442,and the current state of Delta falls squarely on he shoulders of the unvaccinated.
443,We don't know that yet.
444,The regions its been found in have just been clusters and South Africa didn't have much of a Delta wave.
445,I mean this kindly but please don't spread conclusions when we barely have any data on this as itll only spread unnecessary anxiety to people.
446,It helps that WHO is skipping letters.
447,"Xi, for example, was not used."
448,Travel bans don't work and they instead serve to disincentivize sharing negative information.
449,CNN said its Delta and Beta mutations wrapped into one.
450,"The mutations that made Delta transmissible, and Beta vaccine resistant."
451,No I said it's one more closer to it not being as dangerous.
452,So just keep reading that statement and understand that we have to go through so many of them before it basically becomes a regular cold reading fast is not going to help you play Go
453,"I told a friend today that it was already in the US, and he looked at me like I was crazy."
454,Uh huh.
455,Let's wait 3 days and revisit that sentiment.
456,When people stop being dumb.
457,"Also, when people stop saying that it's here forever."
458,To be fair death is the ultimate liberation.
459,Thank you!
460,Vaccine efficacy already drops significantly after 6 months even with the Delta strain.
461,Just line up for the boosters.
462,March 2020 measures can never be implemented again against Covid or any of it's variants.
463,At least i can speak for the U.S and probably Canada.
464,"I have no idea about places like Australia, Austria and Germany."
465,They are in another world of their own.
466,Goodluck to their Citizens getting shut down for every variant.

480,I have no idea why you would think I or anyone else would plan someone who doesn’t have access to vaccines for being unvaccinated.
481,That’s just doesn’t even make sense.
482,I’m specifically talking about unvaccinated New Yorkers as the article was about NY and our governor.
483,We’ve had open access to vaccines for months and months.
484,Absolutely no legitimate reason to not get vaccinated.

486,I kept my mouth shut and walked away from that one.

490,What did you want them to tell you though?
491,"People didn't want to accept the answer ""as long as it takes"" so governments were forced to make up arbitrary timelines."
492,"The truth still is that, we will have to do this as long as it takes to get infections down to a background level like flu is."
493,It could be 2 months or 2 years since virus mutations are turning out to be a big unknown.
494,[removed]
495,because the assumptions are based on the known science.
496,"unvaccinated people are more likely to get Covid, meaning that there are more active cases out there than there otherwise would be."
497,and once they have it they're more likely to spread it than an vaccinated person.
498,Did you change careers and become an ICU nurse?
499,Us has had five airports taking direct flights from South Africa since November 9th.
500,It here
501,I watched that special as I was reading about Nu.
502,Seemed like a documentary more than a comedy.
503,"Honest question: If this was true, why did not a lab engineer design a corona virus that was less lethal, more transmissible and not vaccine evasive?"
504,Then spread it out into the population.
505,We could have just avoided these months of lockdown.
506,Omicron was a planet-sized transformer that ate other planets.
507,He's basically Galactus.
508,And none of them would have been discovered without this extra testing?
509,"I'm speculating here, but that might mean that the new variant causes a lot of asymptomatic cases."
510,"Which would actually be really good, it may be less dangerous."
511,"That would also explain the extremely rapid spread which seems like it's the most contagious virus in history, but maybe those cases were only discovered once people started looking."
512,Orders of magnitudes fewer than from the virus.
513,Half the world has had at least one dose.
514,This is an extremely myopic view.
515,And honestly the title should specify rich WESTERN countries because China has handled this extremely effectively.
516,The west  and especially the US is primarily responsible for the outcomes of the global south and generally the prolonged nature of the pandemic.
517,"We didn’t test well enough, we didn’t contract trace, we didn’t do China style quarantine ect."
518,On top of that we hoarded vaccine to protect profit.
519,What happened with delta and what is happening now with this new strain is primarily the inability for western countries to be able to handle a public health crisis effectively.
520,&gt; AFAIK there's a lot of scepticism about its effectiveness in Russia itself.
521,That yes.
522,The conversation I had 5 minutes ago.
523,"Interlocutor - all vaccines are arranged the same 

I - but it's not so, mRNA vaccines, vector, inactivated are different

529,"The sensible thing is to be aware and just wait, no sense in panicking."

546,Especially Delta.
547,We're reacting to Omicron the same way we reacted to the initial reports of all those variants.
548,Nobody remembers because 2021's been a hell of a roller coaster and we've all just been trying to survive and keep our heads above water since 2020.
549,"There was wild speculation that all of those variants were going to be ""the one"" that set us back to March 2020 and kill us all."
550,"They weren't and this probably won't either but, like those other variants, we need to keep our heads about us as the science gets done and we figure out what we're actually looking at."
551,Some people mentioned that the governments are moving faster than with other variants?
552,Didn't the UK not want to immediately suspend travel to India because trade reasons that have nothing to do with South Africa?
553,"And back then, the US was was still announcing travel bans days before they went into effect."
554,Others have mentioned the markets and that they didn't react with Delta the way the markets are reacing with Omicron and that's telling as to how bad it is.
555,"Thing is, the markets actually did have a negative reaction."
556,[This Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-22/delta-variant-stock-market-reacts-return-to-work-threatened) talks about that and I have two more from the Financial Post and Fortune that I can't link because of Automod.

564,All info on it so far has been publicly released and will continue to be publicly released.
565,There just hasn't been enough time to see how dangerous it is in practice.

576,US’s response is always slow.
577,Trust me it’s already here before you begin to review the “data”
578,I don’t think we have any idea yet if there will be worse outcomes or not from this variant.
579,We will need to wait 2-4 weeks from when a lot of people are testing positive for it to see if hospitalization rates start going up.
580,That’s kinda the point of advisors too lol.
581,They (ideally) have deep expertise on a subject that an elected official probably wouldn’t have.
582,What concerns me is the reactions by multiple governments — presumably also being advised by experts — that seem rather serious.
583,"I wanna trust that this variant isn’t too concerning, but I’m also wondering if there’s some wisdom of the crowd going on here."
584,"Moderna 100 mcg, Moderna booster 50 mcg, Pfizer 30 mcg, Pfizer kids 10 mcg"

588,Yeah we’re in Europe right now and don’t want to go back to the US where it’s a shit show.
589,Biggest problem is we have 50 individual states acting as their own countries with vastly different protocols.
590,I think Africa is at like 5% fully vaccinated.
591,The whole continent.
592,One thing I've learned about the data is that much of the data doesn't make much sense when comparing it to other data throughout the pandemic.
593,I've flown during COVID to go on holiday and back.
594,"Honestly, the holiday did wonders for my mental health."
595,"Travelling is what I pretty much live for pre-Covid, and so I don't think it is as black and white as stay home."

604,"David Dowdy from John Hopkins -

“To summarize, omicron:
- is still a small sample."
605,- has likely not faced pressure to escape vaccines.
606,- was found in a country w few cases (not what we would expect if it were evolving to become more fit).
607,"Meaning there's still good reason to believe it won't take off globally.“

608,"So they conveniently skipped the Greek letters ""Nu"" and ""Xi."""

617,So the bot actually helps a lot.
618,Come to Chicago.
619,We wear masks here.
620,People are complaining that the Illinois governor hasn’t lifted the mask mandate.
621,I’m glad he hasn’t.

623,This thing seems to move so fast that countries are always 5 steps behind and don’t even see the 5 steps they’re missing.
624,Dude!
625,How do you not already have a supply of at least one closet full after what happened last time?
626,"Next time we get a lull in people panic buying, do yourself a favor and buy a bunch of masks and toilet paper and don't touch it."
627,"If the nurses run short, donate your supply to them."
628,28 days later.
629,Well that's just prime.
630,Too many mays in that article.
631,Just as a PSA: That type of keywording would bias the search results towards only results that confirm or outright deny this particular claim leading to potential confirmation bias.
632,The more neutral search term would be 'omnicron delta infection rates'.
633,Air travel with this new valiant would be most difficult.
634,Yup my Japanese friend had a false negative test upon departure but tested positive upon arrival.
635,Now she's one of the few people in Japan with COVID and she's stuck in a hotel room.
636,She's better now and should be leaving the hotel room soon.
637,I have no sympathy any more.
638,The vaccine is free.
639,In another post someone said their vaccinated grandmother went from zero to ICU in 2 weeks and the drs are talking about taking her off the vent and letting nature take its course.
640,She is of course upset.
641,A nurse piped up and said 100% of patients who are put on the vent are dying.
642,A few months ago it was 93%.
643,Last year is was 80%.
644,What else can the rest do for these people?
645,"If they picked it up on the plane, they wouldn't be testing positive yet."
646,It takes a day or two to work its way through your system enough for a test to register it.
647,These people all picked it up during the time between their negative test and their flight.
648,"Which is still extremely worrying, if that many people caught it during the 24-48 hours before flying out of South Africa - how many people there have it and are spreading it, for this large a percentage of passengers to test positive?"
649,That would have made it so much better.
650,Yeah looks like things are about to become extremely good or extremely bad.
651,Probably more chance that it will be extremely bad but fingers crossed.

668,This virus contained 20 mutations that are known to prevent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from binding to it.

726,Necron-omicron… gonna need to transform my hand into a chainsaw
727,It’s just two different tests- + PCR doesn’t always mean current active infection- PCR tests pick up recent infections all the time.
728,"Also pre-boarding some passengers may have had an exposure but not yet developed detectable levels of virus- but in the 1-2 days since their pre flight test then their viral level increased, thus the positive test."
729,"not directly related to covid.. but bird flu… does anyone know anything more about this…

A study published in 2012 in Science Magazine reported on research findings that allowed for the airborne transmission of H5N1 in laboratory ferrets."
730,The study identified the 5 mutations necessary for the virus to become airborne and immediately sparked controversy over the ethical implications of making such potentially dangerous information available to the general public.

751,It’s not a word problem in math where more is less.
752,Two okay mutations be 8 fantastic mutations or some combination but some good ones and we’ve got a problem.
753,How is it that we always learn about these variants from the UK?
754,Is it that the press there is more likely to report it or that they are more on it than anywhere else.
755,"Honestly, I understand where your mayor is coming from."
756,The variant is all over the world now.
757,"I've been reading more level-headed takes and so far, even the Health Minister of South Africa is saying they haven't noticed any worse outcomes so far and the travel bans are premature."
758,Many experts are saying travel bans from entire countries are not the answer; helping these countries get better access and distribution to vaccines and enacting better sense travel policies is.
759,Just enact policies that only vaccinated travelers can enter your country AND they have to get a COVID test within a certain amount of time before entry.
760,That's the best path forward.
761,These types of travel bans honestly punish South Africa for being diligent on sequencing and being good world citizens in alerting other countries so I get the frustration on their part.
762,"As long as we keep stringent safety measures in place, other countries shouldn't really have a knee-jerk reaction to a variant we don't know much about."
763,This thing already has a bunch of variants and will continue to do so.
764,"Given COVID is here to stay, freaking out over every single variant isn't going to help."
765,We know safety measures work... let's continue to do that instead of locking down or banning travel constantly.
766,"Genuine question: if 10% of people in this sample are positive and this variant has been running rampant but hospitalizations haven’t been going crazy, does that maybe possibly hopefully suggest it’s not as terrible as other variants?"
767,"Because it is, and the scientists know it."
768,Hence why all the red flags and news coverage over the last 48 hours.
769,I believe we will see some serious developments in terms of cases in the US and Europe.

778,It's absolutely already here and it's gonna be everywhere this winter.
779,The thing is I don't know anyone who is anti vax besides my manager at work (and I work remotely and have never met him in person).
780,Even my racist (went on a rant about how even black people don't trust black people as part of a tangent about how the area is going down hill that was already pretty racist when I offered him some coriander from our garden) pro Trump nextdoor neighbor got the vaccine so he would be allowed around his grandkids.
781,"Like I was the last person in my family to get the first dose in mid April of least year (the area I was in had stricter rules for eligibility than most of my family) and my bf is like the only person I know socially who hasn't gotten the booster shot yet (he's getting it this week, and he didn't qualify till last week, so not resisting, just hasn't had a chance yet)."

852,"Testing doesn't really matter, honestly."

854,The problem is that Covid-19 is super contagious and we clearly don't have a grasp on the situation even after almost 2 years.
855,Hallo keyboard warriors!
856,'it's on me'?
857,Nice of you to say.

863,Dying because you can’t breathe is also pretty gross.
864,That's all very interesting and should be taken into consideration.
865,What I don’t understand is why you think letting the virus run rampant would help?
866,"The more it spreads, the more times it will mutate to potentially worse forms."
867,"It's likely that the omicron variant mutated in someone with a weak immune system suffering from AIDS, for example."
868,Letting the virus spread means this kind of thing is more likely to happen than not.
869,"The more it spreads, the more opportunities to mutate."
870,Letting it run wild is the perfect circumstance to create the worst form of super virus.
871,"If there had never been any measures taken we would be in the same position as now, but with a much higher stack of corpses behind us."
872,Vaccines or luck are the ways out.
873,(Luck being a random mutation becoming dominant  that is maximally contagious but no worse than a common cold.)
874,It’s not more baseless than this article’s presumptions.
875,I was thinking Pandemic Legacy season 2
876,That definitely crossed my mind.
877,"I never felt physically ill between my second dose and booster, but I was around relatives who complained of illness."
878,"One tested negative on a rapid covid test, but had the tell-tale symptoms, while another refused to get tested, because they swore they couldn't possibly have it."
879,"I never seemed to catch what either of them had, so its possible I picked up an asymptomatic infection due to my vaccination status."
880,The use of “may” vs “should” is because it helps against infection but is not necessary if you only care about severe cases.

911,The reason we didn’t get it till a year later was because of the multi phased testing approach.
912,I would think the FDA would allow the mrna companies to skip directly to phase 2 testing since the delivery vector and dosage would stay the same.

1027,No it isn't.
1028,The joke is funny but based on a wrong translation.
1029,"That doesn't seem high to me, I don't know why this is so alarming."
1030,Oh.. they accept the rapid antigen tests.
1031,No wonder.
1032,Cause saying people who don't agree with you should be let to die is so very civil.
1033,And then these people complain about Covid being a never ending issue.
1034,Idiots.
1035,Complete idiots.
1036,They're Variants of Interest.
1037,Last variant that got upped to Variant of Concern status was the Delta variant.
1038,Omicron is so mutated that it immediately got designated a VoC.

1068,"true, but they left their own country, does South Africa not have vaccination requirements for foreign visitors?"
1069,"Right, but there were some scientists that were indicating the evidence so far shows that Omicron could be more mild than Delta; if a lot of young people are showing up with symptoms, that doesn't sound more mild to me."
1070,You just bought yourself another.
1071,Want another one?
1072,No rapid test at destination.
1073,In Amsterdam they all got PCR tests otherwise they have no options to sequence the results.
1074,Do people fly from Africa to New York for Black Friday sales?
1075,There are media reports quoting passengers saying that many of the other passengers weren’t wearing a mask (as they should have done).
1076,Well SA is one of the richer countries in Africa so I sort of meant the mire poorer.
1077,But yeah 35% vaccinated is pretty useless
1078,This is sus.
1079,How can he say this when cases have spiked 15X in a week and deaths 2x after only 11 days since Omnicron was first detected?

1090,"The markets also reacted to delta, I'm saying that the situation may seem worse because of the factors I described."
1091,It is also completely pointless.

If you have a cold/ are sick - stay at home."

1108,It’s like a war.

1111,"It hasn’t even been two years and a substantial chunk of the globe hasn’t been vaccinated yet, specifically much of Africa."
1112,It’s sadly predictable that a new strain came out of there.
1113,If that’s a PCR test something doesn’t add up.
1114,A testing issue on the Belgian side is my guess.
1115,I don’t know what variant they’ve been infected with.
1116,But given the prevalence in the province it’s likely it’s the new one.
1117,A majority of Covid cases have always been mild.
1118,"Seems like those are the two options, but we don't know yet."
1119,Looking at SA Hospitalizations over the next 2 weeks will give us more data.
1120,I read that this new strain is likely to have come from someone who was already immunocompromised by aids and then caught covid and couldn't throw it off easily.
1121,This was predicted in the beginning.
1122,This thing is going to keep on going until we vaccinate everyone.
1123,None of us are safe until  all of us are safe.

1128,The vast majority of mutations are non viable.
1129,It’s the viable ones that we’re concerned about and this one appears to be a very viable and virulent form that may spread with extreme ease.
1130,Early analysis suggests that immune escape is possible though not full in scope - but this could very easily be the scaffold on which further mutation turns this strain into something much worse.

1132,"Well, s/he didn't say ""everybody""."
1133,My organization's pandemic response plan is to still not give a damn about masks or social distancing.
1134,Rapid Antigen Tests are far from 100% and are best repeated.
1135,"Where I work, we are supposed to self test twice a week, even if vaccinated if we are coming in."
1136,"However, to miss so many is bad."
1137,"Everyone who was on the flight is being quarantined and no doubt,  the tests repeated."
1138,I would be interested if we see more cases among those on the flight.
1139,I mean it's no brainer.
1140,"It's most likely all over Europe at this point, the Belgians were just the first to find out about it like it happened with other variants IIRC."
1141,"Wow, they've already declared this but are waiting till the 3rd..."
1142,If I was a cynical person I might think they were delaying it so all the Black Friday sales could go through...
1143,But no one would ever put profit over the lives of Americans would they?
1144,?
1145,The A380 is HUGE.
1146,They found 61 Corona cases in those flights.
1147,Which variant isn't clear yet.
1148,"Welp, I may have a swollen armpit/lymph node from the #3 booster but now I’m glad I got it done this week"
1149,"If we're lucky, in addition to the mutations there are also spike proteins the vaccine still recognises."
1150,If we're lucky.
1151,"Lmao, and here I thought you replied to the wrong person."
1152,Wearing a mask too difficult for you?
1153,I'll go back to my original thought which is how do you feel about seatbelts then?
1154,Five days ago South Africa was only averaging about 500 cases per day in the whole country.
1155,Now 10% of two flights test positive.
1156,This implies rapid growth and extremely high transmissibility.
1157,That’s not what actual professionals are saying.
1158,So please stop talking.
1159,It gives off the vibes of a Europe where everyone is stressed out.
1160,Research shows that it has a variant protein spike.
1161,mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna are likely still effective vs Omicron.
1162,Tests are ongoing.
1163,so why have all these governments shut their doors to flights from southern Africa?
1164,Surely the governments would be better informed than us.
1165,"The flight is long, 11hours plus."
1166,Airports are terrible places for spreading infection even if the plane with its frequent air changes is fairly clean.
1167,So far.
1168,"On those flights you’re required to wear your mask the whole time, so I’m curious about transmission based on surgical mask vs n95 vs commercially available masks."
1169,"This story wasn't about covid, but instead the school just wanted the kid to stop messing around with the duplicator machine."
1170,I remember chatting with my husband a few days ago wondering if I'd be able to travel to Europe next year for an in-person work retreat they're planning.
1171,I live in Japan and they've (wisely) been super strict about people leaving and no one can come in if they're tourists rn.
1172,"I said ""maybe next year it'll be over??"""
1173,and he looked at me like I was crazy.
1174,"He was like, this isn't gonna be over next year, or even in the next few years."
1175,Corona virus is here to stay.
1176,At the time I thought that was pessimistic but now I'm thinking maybe he's right :(
1177,"Triage is fine, that makes sense when resources are limited."
1178,I think you mean 2 to 4 weeks before we (the public) know.
1179,I think it sounds like grandma smoking a spliff.
1180,Have you been checked out?
1181,I resemble that remark.
1182,You don't know what you're talking about.
1183,The flu is literally the prime example of a virus becoming endemic and for the most part non terminal.
1184,Seriously god damn.
1185,[deleted]
1186,OK then.
1187,If it shows up in vaccinated people... and is a problem... because of very bad outcomes.
1188,Not to include the sniffles.
1189,Do they even know if the rapid antigen test identifies this variant?
1190,Which antigen do rapid tests identify?
1191,"If it’s the spike, then it won’t work for Omicron."
1192,"If it’s nucleocapsid, then it should still work."
1193,And they still have restrictions.
1194,"Every city has a metro area, it's not unique to Vancouver."
1195,Fraud?
1196,"No, we know it is Delta."
1197,99.99% of samples from Germany in the first two weeks of November are Delta.
1198,"https://covariants.org/per-country Omicron and Delta cannot be mistaken for each other, the difference is detectable on a regular PCR swab."
1199,Is there more chance it’ll be bad though?
1200,We have no way of knowing that.
1201,"Hang in there, it will take time but it will end."
1202,That's a fair point but I feel we'll know much more even in just 2-4 days.
1203,"If the South African infection numbers start pointing up with most of them being confirmed to be Omicron *and* these (at least) 61 passengers on the plane also can be confirmed to be infected with Omicron, it would indicate pretty rapid spread considering Omicron was first detected in a sample from Botswana on the 11 - just over two weeks ago!"
1204,Thank you!
1205,"853 people capacity, packed like literal sardines"
1206,"I’m confused by the naming convention - I get it, Greek alphabet."
1207,"So the ones I feel like I’ve heard of, since moving to their new naming convention are alpha, delta, lambda and now omicron."

1218,"I know people did that back in March / April 2021, but this is maybe not the best time to be doing that haha."
1219,"Exactly, I'm also fine with additionally requiring a test or even a PCR test (who cares if I have to pay additional 30-40 euros for a PCR test while the return ticket itself costs 500-600 euros)."
1220,"Hat on, sunglasses on and a mask....I'm not hiding but I am."

1222,There’s a restaurant near my parents named Omicron that’s probably none too pleased right now.
1223,Shut down all drama production
1224,"Not to mention, it tore through a nursing home in Granville."
1225,They were up to over 50 cases at one time to the point where something felt off.
1226,I think it's already in the state.
1227,The real panic will be if a large fraction of those 61 die.
1228,"Your analogies are on point, son!"

1234,Yea only 77 cases...less than 2 weeks since discovery...how does he know?
1235,BS
1236,SA's unique COVID dynamics prior make the analysis all the more challenging.
1237,"Unlike many other areas, Delta did not have a ""stranglehold"" on the region, so I'd be cautious about trying to determine R values of Omicron."
1238,Did Omicron establish fast due to a lack of competition in specific areas or did it muscle out Delta in a head-to-head race?
1239,"I'm not saying it's *not* a quick spreader, but I've been seeing some fairly sketchy numbers being thrown around without the strongest backing evidence, and while it's not the most re-assuring to say ""we just don't know enough"", I think that's the best we can do at the moment."
1240,"I don't know, looking at India or at least my country of Indonesia, seems like herd immunity do exist for Covid."
1241,"Indonesia got absolutely buttfucked by Delta back in July, and yet daily cases have plummeted to a level not seen since April 2020, that's with just 34% ""fully"" (two shot) vaccinated."
1242,"There are so many untested cases and excess deaths that basically among us Indonesians it's either caught it and died, caught it and lived to be semi-immune, or vaccinated."

1253,There.
1254,Your question is answered.
1255,"Aerospace-technology.com says, “ The A380-800 from Airbus tops the list, with a massive seating capacity of 853 passengers.” But luckily the airlines aren’t that cruel, at least not to people with some extra pocket money."
1256,"“ Rightly dubbed as the Superjumbo, it accommodates 525 passengers in a three-class configuration.”"
1257,"And the thing is, showing up in vaccinated people alone isn't going to tell us anything because Delta can also show up in vaccinated people."
1258,It'll require proper empirical evidence to make any judgements.
1259,I think it’s safe to say it’s everywhere at this point.
1260,There are less than 100 known cases of the new variant worldwide and they are not old enough to know whether the infection will result in severe cases or not as severe symptoms can appear weeks after in the current strains if I am not mistaken.
1261,"Yeah, that data."
1262,What does the tap water do regarding coronavirus?
1263,QUICK VACCINATE THE FETUS'S
1264,more cow patties
1265,"As I recall the Omnicron variant spike doesn’t register on the current test, the test spike antigens are mutated on this variant."
1266,"So it’s only picking up the capsid N protein, which may change the tests efficacy"
1267,That’s a surf contest
1268,Possible.
1269,But it is also due to low viral loads since superspreaders are identified very accurately.
1270,woosh
1271,Or has already happened…
1272,People need king fauci for the final word
1273,Time for more stimulus checks and inflation
1274,Which only means their viral load was high enough to be even spotted.

1276,"Is they were rapid tested, that is just stupidity."
1277,Pcr or stay home.

1319,Moronic.
1320,"Yeah, this seems like a stupid article."

“The companies said they can adapt their mRNA vaccine within six weeks and start shipping batches within 100 days if an escape variant is identified.”

Won’t know much else until lab tests come back with some results."
1322,Or it shows up in vaccinated people.
1323,Does the article say the same exact type and brand of test was used before boarding?
1324,Means the tests from South Africa are worthless and inaccurate.
1325,Guys don't worry its still just the flu.
1326,HARD SARCASM
1327,Thank you for the information.
1328,"The German system seems very easy to fraud, as the QR code is based on hand written entries into the German vaccination book."
1329,These entries are created by pharmacies.
1330,So there are two steps that both opens for loads of fraud.
1331,Most other European countries have QR codes based on entries from central vaccination data bases.
1332,"Yes, I had that, too!"
1333,Freaked me out at first as I didn’t have a reaction like that with my initial J&amp;J shot.
1334,The swollen lymph lasted 4-5 days and returned to normal pretty quickly.
1335,Worse than the swelling for me was the lymph was actually painful during that time.
1336,You just explained why it was a huge issue.
1337,"Oh, trust me and my mucus, I haven't forgotten colds still exist."
1338,"Brb, getting some more tea."
1339,They went on sale for Black Friday
1340,It isn't definite illness and the benefit is real apart from maybe for the nu VOC as not enough data on that yet.
1341,But don't let science ruin a good outrage
1342,"South African have tested many positive omicron cases

So far the cases in hospitals are in the same proportion to Delta

Meaning the vaccine is just as effective"
1343,"Decent analogy however Omicron is a mutation of the Alpha variant, not the Delta variant."
1344,"So it’s not a mutation of a mutation (ignoring the fact that Alpha was a small mutation)

Continuing with your analogy, we don’t know if those mutations will actually impact the key shape, it could impact the key colour, key chain, etc."
1345,We don’t know for sure yet but all the hoopla has to do with the fact the spike protein does appear to have mutated significantly.
1346,Magically changed in other words.
1347,Whether that’s a big deal or not is the open question.
1348,"As always knowing real data and facts is hard to know, especially with all the secrecy around it."
1349,Still if what you say is true the problem is to do with the network and infrastructure.
1350,"I do not know much about this stuff, but I heard how amazing Brazil is at vaccinating."
1351,"They are really well set-up for it, and this despite not having the best public health service"
1352,Totally dumb.
1353,"If we're already vaccinited, and yet they push masks again, will we live this bullshit forever?"
1354,Covid wont go away and magically disappear.
1355,"Outbreaks will keep happening but as long as we dont bad af (or die) because of the vaccine, its ok."
1356,"It's probably already all over, suspected cases in Belgium and Germany."
1357,The traveler from Belgium wasn't even in south Africa and got it from Egypt/Turkey.
1358,That's quite like extreme
1359,K....
1360,Most people dont even know what order the greek alphabet goes in.
1361,"There are obvious reasons to skip nu and xi, who cares."
1362,"By the time China opens up they'll have more or less 100% vaccination rate for anyone above the age of 3, including a booster shot."
1363,At that point in time their IFR will be 20 times lower than immunonaive populations and they will have very few unvaccinated patients in their hospitals.
1364,I suspect they won't waste a ton of resources trying to save their idiots either.
1365,Isn’t there also the issue that the vaccines don’t work as well or at all for people who are immunocompromised?
1366,So we don’t really have a way to protect those people and stop this cycle?
1367,Your level-headed comment makes me feel better about this whole situation.
1368,Hugs from Virginia!
1369,Just wear an n95 and take your trip bro... no point living your life in fear when people can literally buy n95s and have excellent respiratory protection.

1371,Throw in huge numbers of immuno-compromised folks and things don't look pretty.
1372,The doctor in question also said that her patients were young.
1373,She reminded people that only 6% of South Africans are over the age of 65 and it would take time to see the repercussions of the new variant in older populations and those with co-morbidities.
1374,"Hopefully it is also a mild illness for everyone, but currently the evidence isn't there one way or the other."
1375,Yeah but...this is possible cause for real alarm?
1376,"When the scientists are concerned, I am concerned."

1382,"From what I’ve read, there is no evolutionary pressure for the virus to become “milder” since it spreads pre-symptomatically or asymptotically."
1383,"Honestly, what cities are you people living in where everyone was just smiling at each other all day?"
1384,"If I read this page:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm

correctly than myocarditis for COVID-19 patients has an incidence of 146 per 100,000."
1385,"While according to this:

myocarditis for vaccinated people has an incidence of 2.3 per 100,000."

1401,"And if you do get it, you serve as a science experiment for the rest of us to test the immune response of vaccines to the new variant /s"
1402,Wait.
1403,There’s a B.1.640 variant?
1404,"This isn’t even surprising anymore, covid is here to stay and it will be just like the flu with different strains every season."
1405,Enough of the gas lighting and fear mongering from media outlets and governments.
1406,"There are plenty of vaccines, masks, and even treatment available now to reduce covid death or hospitalizations."
1407,It’s time to get back to normal and not keep hiding from every little variant.
1408,Because we're finding that it didn't originate in South Africa and has probably been floating around multiple countries for the past month or possibly months.
1409,Absolutely the smart thing to do.
1410,"""Go hard and go early"" has been cited repeatedly as one of the major lessons of this pandemic thus far."
1411,I expect that most of the rest of us (and most particularly the U.S.) will just sit around and tell ourselves we don't have enough data to do anything meaningful yet while millions of preventable Omicron infections occur all over the world.

1418,I think we’ve hit the ceiling of vaccinations in my state.
1419,I don’t think people falling dead in the streets would change a thing.
1420,Delta ravaged us and we still don’t have 50% vaccinated.
1421,What would your advice to us immunocompromised people be?
1422,Just say “fuck it!” and move on?
1423,Cause no will not follow that advice you have til cases are way down.

1429,"I know that it’s hypothetical, that’s the point."
1430,"I’m saying that it’s not only pointless, but also perhaps even counterproductive in some ways to just sit around dreaming up nightmare scenarios without evidential basis."
1431,What purpose does making up this 1 in 3 CFR idea out of thin air serve?
1432,"IIRC there was an increase in the vaccination rate when Delta first hit, because some people realized they couldn’t just wait for the virus to die down."
1433,"Something similar might happen now with a few people, but I doubt the effect will be very widespread."
1434,I think most of the people who still aren’t vaccinated at this point have made their minds up and/or care so little that this isn’t going to spur them to action any more than previous events did.
1435,&gt;It’s been spreading for at least a few months.
1436,This variant has likely been around since only mid October:  https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1464353262119776258

1445,"I remember back in the day reading a research paper out of Africa, and they found that they were getting higher DNA yields from plants while doing the whole extraction at higher than RT vs RT and ice, the way we do it in the west."
1446,"They didn't adjust their climate control for this experiment, they just wrote the paper because they *didn't have* adequate climate control in their labs."

1472,"The photo shows the structure of the spike protein of the Omicron variant, on the right, and of the Delta variant, on the left, compared to the original SARS CoV-2 spike."

1474,"The red dots indicate the areas with very high variability, the orange ones with high variability, the yellow ones with medium variability, the green ones with low variability, and the celestial ones with low variability."
1475,The gray area is the one that does not vary.

1530,So.. how is a travel ban supposed to help at this point?
1531,That’s why it’s so ridiculousness all the people on social media saying SA is being ‘punished” for being open?
1532,What’s the alternative- collective punishment and millions more cases.
1533,Is that the moral scenario?
1534,Echoes of China all over again where it was politicised as ‘racist’ to ban entry from that region
1535,"According to the article, the data used in the study was when China had only 54% vaccination rate."
1536,"&gt;&gt; In August, most of these countries had presented higher vaccination rates than China, where 54 per cent of the eligible population were inoculated."
1537,The numbers probably would be different if they used the current Chinese vaccination rate.
1538,I wouldn’t be surprised if they kept saying there’s a new variant
1539,The efficacy of their vaccines is not great.
1540,The US will not lockdown again.
1541,Omicron is more infectious but is supposed to be less deadly.
1542,"Fingers crossed, it should burn out quickly."
1543,Locking down is extremely unpopular anyway and benefits nobody politically.
1544,"If a vaccin can make you sick, the virus itself will be much worse."

1546,"You'll get the same spike proteins, but a much much higher dosis."
1547,"No wonder the virus has the same 'side effects', but worse."
1548,Obviously the virus is not just a spike protein.

1555,"Seems like you don't know much about India then, since they're apparently fine"
1556,So far it looks like Omicron will be the biggest nothingburger yet.
1557,I respect being cautious but man was this fucking overblown.
1558,"Not OP, but the argument is important, it is a large part of antivax rethoric to compare getting a shot to doing nothing  in terms of risks, while discarding the actual chance of getting the illness and all associated risks."
1559,1 chance out of 50000 to get myocarditis seems like a huge risk if you believe the alternative is doing nothing.
1560,"Of course, it should be compared to the risk of getting covid x the death rate of unvaccinated individuals getting covid, which is much much higher."
1561,Thanks for the heads up!
1562,No one is talking about this.

1575,They will tell you everything is fine while smarter countries around the world will lockdown slightly now to a value getting completely destroyed by this new variant if it ends up being more dangerous.
1576,"Considering the low rates in SA and how mutations should statistically tend to occur in high-infection areas, this leads me to believe that we don't really know where this variant originated, it's just that South Africa was just the first place it was detected."

1629,Depends on the local authorities.
1630,"Correct, it's called burn out."
1631,Unfortunately it's volatility in it's mutations (Eight) means that it may evade the current vaccines in part.

1709,I travelled by train very early one morning a few days ago for the first time since January 2020.
1710,I was the only person out of 6 who got on at my station wearing a mask and amongst the 20 - 25 people who got off the train I changed to there wasn't a single mask to be seen.
1711,"Despite this our cases are remaining quite steady so although masks clearly aren't the only thing controlling the spread I agree they are necessary in shops and public transport until we find out exactly what threat, if any this new variant poses."
1712,In the US at least a good number of people had their Thanksgiving interrupted.

1714,Can we?
1715,Yes.
1716,Ethically problematic though.

1728,Thank you for that info.
1729,"I recently read that PCR tests were done prior to patients flights to Asia, and that they did not test positive on PCR testing until a week later."
1730,I have family in the UP and yeah… that place scares me.
1731,Even while I was living in the rural south lol
1732,"Were they tested right as they landed, or during some kind of week long quarantine period?"
1733,But they won’t
1734,"Yeah, Greece isn't doing too well but you are an EU citizen, you can always move to western Europe again without worrying about visa approvals, applying for permanent residence etc."
1735,"whereas I have to start from scratch, so we are not alike."
1736,You can move to Western Europe by taking the next flight whereas I have to do everything else all over again and I'd rather just Kms at this point than facing disappointment again.

1770,"Instead the news is taking the opportunity to blast out that we’re back to March 2020, without any science claiming that."
1771,We need data soon on how well our current vaccines perform at preventing serious disease for Omicron.

1773,?
1774,They have only said PCR tests so far.
1775,"Lol ""should""."
1776,"If they haven't gotten it by now, there's no way news about a new variant half way across the world will motivate them."
1777,Hope this one isn't as deadly as Delta.
1778,Lot of people myself included cannot get the booster yet.
1779,So it shouldn't be used as a sign of someone underestimating it
1780,This is the first time I can say that the media has been absolutely unhelpful.
1781,Doctors on Youtube are souting about the number of mutations and I honestly wonder how much this is about public health or riding an algorithm.
1782,Also I realize they are committed to the greek alphabet but picking shorter names would also help avoid panic.
1783,Depends on where you are going.
1784,I don’t think airlines mandate anything.
1785,I travelled to the Dominican Republic a few weeks ago and no test was needed at all.

1794,Just because someone speaks with uncertainty doesn’t mean everyone is as confused or scared as you are.
1795,"&gt;…

&gt;Speaker Rachel Ní Faoláin said those who had not been vaccinated were no greater a risk to society than those who had been double or triple jabbed with a Covid vaccine."
1796,&gt;She said she was against Covid certificates and the encouragement of discrimination against “a new minority”.
1797,&gt;There were large cheers from the crowd as she complained about the treatment of those who did not have vaccine passports and said “coercion” should never be acceptable in a functioning democratic society.
1798,"&gt;”Over the past twenty months, our society has evolved into a dictatorship, a totalitarian dystopia,” she said, speaking from a platform beside the Spire."
1799,"&gt;”It has become intolerant... hate speech towards unvaccinated people has become the norm and is now rising exponentially.”

See these people will not take the vaccine just because there is a new variant."
1800,This speaker seems to relish their “victim” status as well as spreading misinformation.
1801,"So US Citizens and Legal Residents can still go to Southern Africa and return from Southern Africa anytime, just Southern Africans cant come here, correct?"
1802,Lol.
1803,In other words you don’t have a control data set.
1804,I’m convinced that neutralizing antibodies fade and boosters are helpful in controlling spread in populations that vaccinated early.
1805,But these anecdata stories are vastly outweighed by population level sets showing vaccines reducing spread.
1806,Source the slow build up?
1807,Maybe this would also be good news for treating with antiviral pills as they need to be taken early.
1808,How regularly are samples analyzed in the US to find out what strain it is?
1809,"I'd bet money that is already all over the US, but wonder about detection?"
1810,It's not like we even test a lot in general.
1811,Doing that is dumb.
1812,If you adapt it the it only works for delta and not omicron or any new one cause for example omicron came from beta.
1813,Get Powecom KN95’s and wear them properly and well if you are concerned.
1814,Just do your best to protect yourself whatever job you get.
1815,Sounds really bad
1816,"That is true, but I think the person you were responding to was saying that if Omicron is found to be more transmissible or evasive than Delta, then it will certainly become the dominant strain."
1817,"In this scenario, it doesn't really matter what you were vaccinated with before."
1818,People here are very anti mask for some stupid reason.
1819,"You even see the Prime Minister, hospital employees, restaurant waiters, and of course Immigration officials without masks..."

1829,"Was bleeding as well 😦 and my arm is a lot more sore than it was the previous 2 shots, but I don't really attribute that to the vaccine haha"
1830,It will if techs aren’t trained to look at this particular qc component.
1831,Omicron sounds like a boss.
1832,CORONA boss fight
1833,"So far only 2 (OG COVID-19, and Delta) have become major pandemic events, and even with Delta our vaccines are still quite effective at at least mitigating severe outcomes and death, while also somewhat decreasing transmission."
1834,"Compare this to influenza, where we require a new annual flu vaccine every year, which is actually a cocktail of the 3 variants that the WHO thinks will be the 3 new and predominant stains that year because the viruses have mutated enough to evade immune resistance from the previous year."
1835,"And even then, the influenza strains often have time to mutate enough between when we start manufacturing our flu shots to when we receive them to reduce the effectiveness to some degree."
1836,"Yes, this could in theory become an annual thing like influenza."
1837,But that would require COVID-19 to behave in a way that so far other coronaviruses have not demonstrated.
1838,"For example, one of the causes of the common cold is a coronavirus, for which naturally acquired immunity is generally good for at least 3-4 years IIRC."
1839,I agree.
1840,Our entire government doesnt give a shit about us and are all bought out.
1841,Its sad and it sucks.
1842,The only person I can truly say is for the people is Bernie Sanders but he doesnt have enough power to make a difference.
1843,Its sad
1844,Lol.
1845,I don't think so.
1846,i’m just shocked that masks were no longer required on public transport and in shops in the UK
1847,"Literally nobody is advocating for that, get a grip"
1848,[removed]
1849,Thanks again China
1850,We don't know that it isn't safe.
1851,Or rather any less safe than it was two weeks ago.
1852,You're vaccines almost certainly still work.
1853,Relax.
1854,"Lol, sorry guys!"
1855,Shit maybe this is why I tested positive and got really sick even though I have the booster.
1856,"&gt; the only way we're ever going to hit 90% vaccination in the US is when the unvaccinated start dying off enough to drop their % from 30ish to 10. unfortunately it won't happen quick enough

That's the direct quote."
1857,OP is hoping for mass death.
1858,Exactly.
1859,"The restrictions and losing jobs are the problem, not getting sick."
1860,"Drop the lockdown, everyone with a brain gets vaccinated and are protected, people who don't want to get vaccinated can get sick."
1861,Fuck em.
1862,There's a small portion of the population who can't and who should lock themselves down and take precautions.
1863,If they do get sick there are treatments for them.
1864,Inb4 banned for making a reasonable comment
1865,South Africa is pretty advanced in dealing with infectious disease.
1866,SA may have been the first to identify it but not necessarily the place of origination.
1867,"That said, it seems as if we’re always a day late when dealing with coronavirus albeit we may be a bit more ahead in this case."
1868,I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s already in the US.
1869,Just my HO.
1870,Vaccines need to be supplied to poorer and energizing nations.
1871,This would help with trying to keep mutations low.
1872,We need to think of ways to help keep transmission manageable.
1873,I would like to see US govt subsidize and provide N95s which must be worn in public spaces and schools.
1874,These blue paper masks and fabric are nit enough.
1875,Omicron is a concern and upsetting.
1876,Time will tell.
1877,"Well vaccines aren't doing it as well as we had hoped, for whatever reason."
1878,They're a good added protection if one must travel.
1879,But leisure travel?
1880,Maybe we as a society need to rethink this.
1881,Maybe we are not entitled to consume our way around the world just for fun after all.
1882,I say this as someone who has traveled a lot.
1883,"I'm glad I did, but in the end I helped add to the climate crisis as well."
1884,"That may be the larger point even: if just driving too much is destructive, what is all this aimless flying doing?"
1885,The world needs to change and maybe covid is telling us we don't need to visit Disneyland annually just because we want to.
1886,Travel needed to be made more special and it is.
1887,The bourgeois caste mark of travel for edification maybe needs to be dropped from the list of must haves.
1888,I also say this as someone who researches and writes about 19C travel and tourism.
1889,Are you drunk?
1890,We're referring the the guy that said OCN.
1891,Who does that?
1892,It's like calling Delta DLA
1893,That sounds like absolute hell
1894,I’d be surprised if it wasn’t already in this comment thread.
1895,That's exactly the reason though.
1896,In northern areas people stay inside during winter and in southern climates they do the same in the summer.
1897,"It evades antibodies from other variants, but the T &amp; B cell immunity still applies."
1898,I don't have unvaccinated friends anymore - there is no reason to be friends with dangerous degenerates.
1899,"As of data - like something could convince you, or you have a real choice to get an effective vaccine."
1900,You don't.
1901,"My family too, we are all traveling to New York after 2 years"
1902,That's not how it works in the real world though.
1903,It's a mix of surgical and N95 masks.
1904,"Plus most airlines in Europe at least have resumed in-flight service which means people are constantly taking their masks off to eat and drink, and the cart is rolled up and down the aisle between people."
1905,Stop asking questions that make sense.
1906,You must panic!
1907,"According to the CDC, they test ~750 samples from each state per week."
1908,Most jurisdictions only test a representative subset.
1909,[removed]
1910,The first red flag was the number of mutations.
1911,"Each previous ""worst"" VOC has been a record holder in number of total mutations and usually in number of spike mutations; Alpha had 16 total mutations, Gamma 19, Delta 23."
1912,Omicron has 31 spike mutations.
1913,"Some record holders have fizzled out, but the number of them that have not certainly makes this of interest to scientists."
1914,"Additionally, it has 11 spike mutations that we have either never seen before or have seen fewer than 100 times in humans - that's more ""new"" spike mutations than any previous VOC besides Gamma has total spike mutations."
1915,The second red flag is its rate of spread.
1916,"Omicron cases have been rising something like 5x (or maybe 3x, or 6x) per week in Johannesburg, while Delta cases remain constant."
1917,In two weeks it went from first sample collection to causing a large surge in the city.
1918,"This is one or more orders of magnitude than any previous jump we've seen, and means that for the first time since summer 2020 a VOC is spreading faster than we can study it."
1919,"If its rate of spread holds up, it will be just a few weeks until it causes case surges in areas with direct travel to Johannesburg."
1920,"Nobody's had it long enough to measure its severity or immune escape, things that we normally know months in advance before a new VOC causes a surge."
1921,"So this is rightfully causing alarm, and in some cases useless panic, as we rush to figure it out."
1922,"Right now we essentially only have anecdotes from the handful of people that have been infected more than a week, but they are promising."
1923,"However, South Africa's daily deaths have also taken a significant jump."
1924,Every day is going to bring new information there.

1935,According to ESR they're still doing urgent overnight sequencing and the rest is done on av weekly basis
1936,I believe it's real life data.
1937,As new variant infects both vaccinated and unvaccinated the numbers will show efficacy of vaccine vs virus
1938,Does anyone have the numbers supporting boosters in young people on hand?
1939,Like what is the rate of serious illness in 2 doses vs 3 for those under 30?
1940,I got super sick from my first two and genuinely wonder if the illness induced from a booster might be worse covid with 2 doses.
1941,I've seen a number of people asking about things like vaccines and how much worse this variant actually is.
1942,Sometimes it's important to say we don't know yet but here's what's being done to find out.
1943,Went a few weeks ago (early nov).

1962,"Measles: ""I'm still top dog at transmission""

Omicron: ""Hold my beer"""
1963,Where do you live that you have a 3.4% mortality rate?
1964,We have 0.8 in Germany.
1965,And the flu is 0.1-0.2%.
1966,"Is American healthcare this bad, I always thought it’s just expensive beyond reasons?"
1967,Delta in particular remains in circulation in most parts of the world.
1968,Earliest I can remember mRNA vaccines being discussed was in around 2007 or 2008 when I was consulting to the CDC.
1969,Exactly.....of a virus that 99.99% of people survive.
1970,"There's no way you would have learned about an (until recently) experimental, scientifically complex vaccine technology in grade school."
1971,The world is not freaking out.
1972,They are making decisions based on data and public health.
1973,Breaking news of single cases is also not exaggerated since most responsible people want to know where it is and what is happening.
1974,There also aren’t anywhere near 1000 variants of interest.
1975,Where did you get that stupid idea?
1976,This is exactly what I was just telling my mom.
1977,"Even if covid disappeared tomorrow, I will forever wear a mask on all flights."
1978,Seems silly that we all just accepting getting sick from time to time on vacation is just the norm.
1979,Like we just expected that.
1980,Spend thousands on a trip and feel like crap the whole time.
1981,I mean I havent had a cold or flu since covid started.
1982,Masks work
1983,It tells you that the vaccinated population is not well represented in hospitals.
1984,"You could surmise that they are either not getting sick after being exposed, or they haven't been exposed in great numbers yet."
1985,I've traveled my whole life and traveled a lot in 2019.
1986,I had planned to go to Europe in 2020 or 2021.
1987,But I didn't.
1988,"At first because I couldn't and now because I won't: the hassle, expense, possibility of getting stuck on the wrong side of a border,  the sheer inconvenience and discomfort, the lines, the tests and all the related unpredictability--all to amuse myself in a foreign cafe rather than one in a nearby town--just is not worth it."
1989,Its not hoping for their death... We're holding society hostage for a percentage of people who refuse to listen to the science.
1990,And their refusal leads to the health system being overrun and overwhelmed causing even more deaths.
1991,"Why should I care about their wellbeing when they know full well their choices lead to the deaths of more people, including their own friends and family."
1992,"I don't want them to die, but at a point why should I care if they don't?"
1993,The market's reaction genius.
1994,My understanding is that the worry isn't necessarily for any individual case.
1995,"Instead, that at this point any notable uptick in cases *could* collapse our already strained health-care system, in the USA of course."
1996,Hence why how infectious it is a main concern.
1997,"Under that context, it help explains why there was such a push for boosters and now the media hype along pre-emptive measures like NY's state of emergency."
1998,The implication... *Jaw twitches*
1999,Too late to save us!!
2000,The Holidays are upon us!
2001,Hear that.
2002,I was just wondering.
2003,Then I'll stick with it then.
2004,And?
2005,The spike protein has several mutations so I think they are assuming it will be worse based on what they know about viruses and mutations.

2028,"Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee, so we do need to be careful."
2029,"However, the good news is that, since it's taken this long to notice the new variant, and has likely already spread, it's not likely that it is more deadly, or at least is struggling to beat out Delta."

2040,Get a fucking clue.
2041,"Yeah good stuff, I always used to suffer from infections 2-3times every and they were really bad infections, in hindsight I should have worn masks."
2042,"This is also the reason, travel restrictions permitting, I will visit Japan, really disciplined stuff this wearing masks."
2043,GA is the worst of em all.
2044,I live here and it's insane people not having masks.

2046,And your proof is?
2047,"The Gov response might not have always been good but the UKs testing and sequencing is amongst the best in the world, and the vaccine boosters are progressing really well."
2048,"If it had originated in the UK, it would have been reported as such a long time ago, just like the Kent variant was."
2049,I feel some intense deja vu...
2050,"Yes, but this one has mutated rather a lot."
2051,We need to study it before assuming it’s safe.

2054,"Yeah, ignoring the new variant entirely, it's nuts that 1 out of 10 people on a plane have covid."
2055,"Either people with covid are much more likely to fly in planes, or disease prevalence is extremely high right now in South Africa."
2056,"I’m afraid to go for a walk unfortunately, but maybe I can find the courage to"
2057,"I am talking about the variant, you have no idea how much the variant impacts  immunity, transmission, and mortality."
2058,Ergo to lockdown is silly.
2059,"It is guaranteed if not this variant, something will eventually displace Delta, and then something will displace that variant and so on."
2060,If you're going to promote lockdowns everytime that looks like it might happen you're going to be having a whole lot more lockdowns.
2061,"I don’t see this mentioned anywhere but the Dutch government and klms reaction has been a fuck up, and has definitely increased the chances of other people catching Covid."
2062,Checkout this Twitter thread by Stephanie Nolen (NYT corespondent) who was stuck on one of these planes.
2063,"https://twitter.com/snolen/status/1464384849792356369?s=21

The TLDR is that the Dutch government kept everyone on the plane for several hours where the passengers breathed in each other’s air."
2064,Once they were disembark they were taken to a venue with no social distancing or mask enforcement.
2065,I think folks are missing the point with this a bit.

2076,"We need a few weeks to gather data and figure out how infectious this thing is, along with whether this changes anything about vaccine effectiveness, or mortality rates."
2077,Too many people are coming at this backwards; acting like things are safe until proven otherwise.
2078,You don’t play cowboy with a virus like this.
2079,"Sorry, but does anyone really care anymore?"
2080,Get vaccinated and live your life.
2081,I'm sick or this shit.
2082,I wonder if it’s difficult to just keep testing until you get a false negative anyway.

2090,"Let's see how this pans out, from the charts I've seen there's been a rapid increase in cases in SA."
2091,"Could there be a problem with rapid tests not detecting the new variant, while the PCR test does?"
2092,SA is basically saying that the hospitalized with this variant are still overwhelmingly unvaccinated per their data.

2131,"Vaccinated people getting infected doesn't necessarily mean a new vaccine is needed, especially when they're all asymptomatic."
2132,Good for them.
2133,US state and local governments must recognize that we do not live in Japan and do not desire to wear masks forever.
2134,Woe betide them if they try to make us do so.
2135,"&gt;Let's hope the vaccines actually still work against it

I'm hoping the mutations made it more transmissible **and** significantly less deadly."
2136,A covid-19 variant that just causes a mild head-cold and infects everyone would end this whole mess.
2137,I bet it's already in Michigan.
2138,I suggest stepping away from the computer and going for a walk.
2139,Obsessing over covid and these fear mongering headlines over a variant they know very little about is not going to help your mental state.
2140,Thank the media.
2141,People are ridiculously talking lockdowns and what not for this new variant already with zero data out and SA saying most cases have been mild.
2142,And those are countries with extremely low vaccination rates already.
2143,Do we forget Delta came onboard just on Aug/Sep at a time kids were going back to school and no lockdowns?
2144,Unless this variant complete evades vaccines then all this is way premature.
2145,"Even if it did, it’s not like a new booster can’t be made quickly."
2146,Makes sense as there are a ton of flights between Hong Kong (where we know there was at least one case) and Australia.

2169,"This is  a public health issue, not just about yourself."
2170,"More than 3 out of 4 people in South Africa are unvaccinated, so that's really not a good metric for their efficacy."
2171,I’d just like to know if it causes more seriously illness or death.
2172,Maybe a majority of infections are mild at best and asymptomatic.
2173,"The EU should have banned flights from africa when iwas first revealed, not wait two weeks."
2174,"Stopping flights now is just ""shutting the stable gate after the horse has bolted"""
2175,"Our response is conservative enough that we are still full mask wear, MS Teams meetings, and max telework so there isn't a whole lot more we will likely enact at this time."
2176,"At one point in the very initial surge we split all of our teams in two so that, of the folks who needed to be on-site to work, only half of those who could do a certain job were ever there at a given time."
2177,"It saved us from a couple of stoppages when a team would get quarantined, and we would go back to that if there's an inkling omicron can break through the vaccines."
2178,The amount of UK people at Disney World right now is astounding
2179,There is zero evolutionary pressure forcing covid to become less deadly.
2180,That only happens if the virus cannot spread because it kills or if spreading is hampered by the symptoms.
2181,"Covid takes weeks to kill, and it spreads while asymptomatic."
2182,Covid takes over a week to become more concerning than a mild cold in many cases.
2183,Covid is just as likely to 10x in lethality as it is to 1/10th in lethality.
2184,"This also still ignores the biggest threat of covid, the double digit % chance of disability."
2185,Any particular reason why?
2186,Or just cause you say so?
2187,The very first person to be reported catching it took 11 days to test positive and was a symptomatic.
2188,I believe.

2196,And I can tell you from first hand experience that getting vaxxed 6-7 months ago is not enough.
2197,I’m young and had 2 mRNA shots and Delta still fucked me up.
2198,"I was very sick for half a week, and my heart, brain, and lungs are not the same anymore."

2214,Of course we know how much a lockdown impacts mortality and transmission.
2215,"Every two people you keep away from each other robs the virus of a chance to transmit and, obviously, a chance to kill."
2216,There are some valid arguments against lockdowns but the idea they don't fundamentally decrease transmission and save lives is ludicrous.

2224,Oh shit.
2225,"Obviously slowing travel will slow the spread, but it seems like Omarion Megatron Da-do-ron-ron has a head start."

2234,I think it comes from this being defined as a [Variant of Concern](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) as opposed to a Variant of Interest.
2235,"It's the fifth VoC (after the original alpha,  and then beta, Delta, Gamma) but Omicron is the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet."
2236,So it seems other named strains have been ruled out as the only two VOI atm are Lambda and Mu
2237,Memories from when they are alive can be comforting and important.
2238,"Trying to squeeze that indy the last days they are alive is, in my opinion, asinine."
2239,"But South Africa and Botswana have a low vaccine rate still, regardless of those 4 Botswanans."

2252,Brussels.
2253,This afternoon.
2254,My wife gets a phone call to go get the kid from school.

2258,She wasn't as amused as I was.
2259,Will start?
2260,"As a physician, I can assure you we are already there in many places."
2261,"Except the media is reporting what scientists have been saying, and that this variant is frightening and worrying."
2262,Should the media lie?
2263,Jfc.
2264,"How do we “move on” when a brand new variant emerges that scientists believe may be more transmissible than Delta, and is so significantly mutated that it may evade vaccines?"
2265,Yep.
2266,Where did she do that exactly?
2267,I know what you mean.
2268,I’m 29.
2269,I normally wake up around 7 in the morning.
2270,Take a nap around 11 and then go to bed around 8.

2273,"I would really love to see all the idiots who believe that ivermectin, and various other remedies usurp actual scientific research leave this existence."
2274,"It will only help the rest of us that have gotten the vaccine, and allow us to produce more vaccine for poorer nations get their first shots."
2275,"Science proving itself that scientists aren't the heroes we deserve, but rather the heroes who still think we're all a bunch of irresponsible jerks but will save us anyhow."
2276,Definitely hasn't been the choice of my 2 year old...

2280,This is why I don’t really judge people too harshly for being anti-vaccine if they are from a different cultural background.
2281,Yep...we're screwed and can't stop it.
2282,Something like 70 percent of white tailed deer in the USA have antibodies for covid-19 which shows how easily it spreads.
2283,We cannot stop it.
2284,"Get vaccinated and keep getting the boosters so you hopefully will be asymptomatic when, not if, you are exposed and infected by the real thing."
2285,"No, it was an episode of You."
2286,"Florida, the super spreader state, says no way to no travel!"
2287,"That's funny, my whole family got the vaccines  boosters including the young ones as told to."
2288,"I'm overseas, so got the only booster available in this developing country, SINOVAC, which seems to go well with my JJ shot stateside."
2289,My son and his wife are both ER nurses and they caught the Delta variant but came out with just the lost of taste for awhile thankfully due to having their vaccinations.
2290,We all wear masks and do all of the distancing...while those that don't clog our ER and medical rooms.
2291,"Those that refuse to get vaccinated, I just think they get what they deserve."
2292,Why feel pity for those that actively go out of their way to get the virus?
2293,"I don't see developing countries not get their shots when available, they actively seek the vaccinations when they are available."
2294,"Those that don't will die, not too many ventilators available in my work area."
2295,"Fie those that don't get the vaccinations, boosters when it's available, they don't get my pity, it's just another way of getting rid of the lice on the earth."
2296,"The thing is, things might be going back to bad and lock downs and all the mayhem."
2297,The problem is how media coverage makes it really hard to distinguish between when it's actually going bad and when it's not.
2298,"After all, we kind of really want to respond when the boy cries wolf if we're all getting eaten."

2301,You speak of this timeline like your a Timelord and can simply jump to another point in time or space
2302,"Most of Canada has, statistically, no people living in it."
2303,Which means that the other parts of Canada (I believe they're called cities) have quite a lot.
2304,The markets were showing signs of trouble *Far* before this variant was announced.
2305,Moderna spiked because they just got confirmation of a huge pay day with a new set of vaccine rollouts.
2306,Source : institutional trader for 6 years.
2307,"First off i have taken both vaccine shots, i am not part of the anti vaxxer camp."
2308,"Problem with stating that covid vaccination gives better immunity is how little studies have been done, the amount of data is super limited."
2309,Normally you never draw any kind of conclusions based on current data but since it is a crisis we try to anyways.
2310,CDC also states it has been super problematic to compare the studies while studies point to wildly different conclusions in regards to how much immunity both types of protection will provide.
2311,"It is true what little data they found point towards vaccination gives more immunity, but it contradicts the cdc's conclusion that more severe symptoms lead to the production of more antibodies."
2312,"(Link 1)

Also the question regarding better immunity is contradicted in this article from August stating not all B, cells are created equal and the one from natural infection last longer and are more broad, which matches what we know about virus infections in general."
2313,But again limited data hard to draw conclusions based on a few studies.
2314,"We however know that old school vaccines provide worse protection against virus Everytime mRNA vaccines might be different though but it is the same mechanism (link 2)

Lifestyle changes has changed for the worse during covid."
2315,This makes perfect sense as staying at home no need to socialize means less reason to work out and improve your health.
2316,"(link 3); If you research the gut microbiome you will know how important lifestyle is for your immune system, it is by far the most important aspect ø."
2317,Weak immune system allows for a virus to mutate so basically if the immune system is weak enough the virus will have a relatively easy time mutating (link 4).
2318,What we currently are doing is saving the people with super weak immune systems while indirectly decreasing the strength of healthy peoples immune systems.
2319,There is also lots of social isolation during covid which  causes havoc on the immune system aswell.
2320,"My rant is not about whatever i am fed up, my rant is about the potential for this virus to mutate into a super virus."
2321,So far covid has only gotten more deadly and infectious.
2322,The longer we keep this up the higher the probability will be that we'll get a super virus that has the perfect combination of high infection rate while being super lethal.
2323,"Think an ebola combined with covid, the only reason ebola died out is that the transmitting rate was too low."
2324,A high lethality rate should not be a problem for covid as it spreads so easily.
2325,"The mutation rate of RNA virus is way too high, expecting a vaccine n isolation to kill it off is simply not possible (link 5)."
2326,"All it takes is one case in the world to start the whole COVID show over,."
2327,"Most of you guys are focused on the short term saving thousands, but if history is anything to go by we might look at a virus that kills millions maybe even billions worst case scenario."
2328,This might be extreme but we have seen it before only 100 years back with the Spanish flu.
2329,"All it took was one mutating for the Spanish flu from being as dangerous as what COVID currently is, to becoming a disease that killed off young healthy men n women in a matter of 1 day."
2330,"(Link 6)

I really do care for other people which is exactly why I am super mad about the current situation."
2331,"With the current infection rate we should see an accelerating speed of mutation, while the virus already have one of the two important traits in becoming a super virus, the ability to transmitt easily."
2332,"Based on above it can be concluded the pandemic weakens immune system, it is believed that weak immune system gives the virus opportunity to mutate and the more mutations we have the more likely a super virus will emerge."
2333,Herd immunity is the only thing throughout history that got us out of a pandemic of current proportions.
2334,I would love if vaccines n genetic entropy could do the job but i fear going that route would mean higher risk that we'll have a super virus due to the diminishing effect of immunity over time.

2351,"As another user mentioned above people take that shit instantly serious because it's so confro
ntingly terrifying."
2352,It's almost like we have been planning for these threats for the last 2 years.

2355,This is #1 on Christmas wish list.
2356,The second thing is clearly reading your obituary.
2357,This variant won't be a problem
2358,Ebola is lucky to be deadly and HORRIFYING in a movie like way that corona just doesn't unfortunately.
2359,I've always been pessimistic about this situation because corona viruses (liek the in common cold viruses of which I believe there are many) mutate so frequently that we have never been able to successfully vaccinate against them.
2360,I am not an expert however please correct if you know better.
2361,I agree exponential percentses.
2362,"We should just *let 'er rip*, then we'll know soon enough."
2363,I like when epidemiologists call me tiger.
2364,The currently-approved vaccines did a good job of stopping the original and Alpha variants.
2365,"Unfortunately Delta was lurking out there, and Delta could partially evade the vaccine and was more transmissible, so the vaccines didn’t stop Delta as well as they did original and Alpha."
2366,And now we have Omicron which might evade the vaccines even more than Delta did and which might also be highly transmissible.
2367,It’s been two years.
2368,Move on.
2369,I’d rather a 1% chance of death than waste more life away.
2370,This isn’t going away.
2371,It’s likely it didn’t even start in South Africa.

2386,"The scientific approach right now would be to collect more data, because we just don't have any right now."
2387,"Then, if that data shows the variant to be a serious threat, we respond to it with what we know works."
2388,That mainly consists of vaccines and a few treatments.
2389,"As for why the WHO cares about travel bans, there are a lot more public health problems in the world than Covid."
2390,The south portion of the African continent is a very poor place where people die of malnutrition and curable diseases all the time.
2391,Travel bans will make all of that worse.
2392,"You can't just write it all off as ""economic,"" these are things that kill people."
2393,"It could be directly counterproductive, too."
2394,"It is believed these new variants almost  always develop in someone with a compromised immune system, usually uncontrolled HIV infection."
2395,"Travel bans severely limit HIV eradication programs which, unlike Covid eradication programs, have actually worked in other parts of the world."
2396,More untreated HIV means more Covid variants.
2397,"So, very improbable upside + several potential downsides is likely the basis of their recommendation."

2408,"I'm saying ""long term"" thinking in terms of the benefits and results of shutting down travel and trying to ""contain"" a variant."
2409,"In the long term it is not feasible, it is still going to spread so it's fruitless."
2410,"All they want to do is pat them selves on the back for a few weeks of ""slowing the spread"" but then immediately they open back up it would have been absolutely fruitless just like the initial lockdowns were."
2411,"After 2 years there should be other coping strategies that does not involve fruitless, pointless short term shutdowns."
2412,It's overly reactive and misguided as evidenced by recent past failures.

2429,I wish everyone would just relax for a bit.
2430,Things aren't going back into lockdown and lifes been feeling mostly semi-normal for most double vaxxed and a breakthrough case (even if it happens) of a new variant shouldn't be severe that will also provide a stellar update to our immune cells.
2431,"If this variants spike proteins have mutated this much, I personally believe it's unlikely to put a dent on Delta."
2432,But we'll just have to see when it's in a country that isn't barely 25% vaxxed.
2433,"Fun fact: if you log off and just live your life as normal, this variant doesn’t even exist and you’ll be much happier"
2434,"From the little bit of data I can find, it seems like these people tested positive in their home countries were either asymptomatic positives or mild illness."
2435,The other thing I have found is a long lag time to clinical illness and positivity.
2436,The 2 Hong Kong cases tested positive after 9 days but we're negative up to that point.
2437,Others became symptomatic after 11 or so days.
2438,"This indicates a potentially lower replication speed, unlike delta, which was 280x more virus particles than alpha."
2439,Delta has an onset of symptoms of 3-4 days for comparison.
2440,"A lot of the breakthrough cases with delta are likely not even true breakthroughs, but a transient replication because it just replicates so damn fast while the immune system starts doing its thing."
2441,"This, on the other hand, may be replicating slower, which may give the immune system time to respond while maintaining a more mild infection and not go apeshit from super high viral burden."

2506,Get vaccinated!!
2507,Thank you!
2508,"Don't worry, there is a very strictly monitored mandatory quarantine /s"
2509,Likely that 5x number comes from some out of context data on the growth rate of the new variant compared to delta in South Africa.
2510,South Africa has very few cases of delta and this variant just got detected recently and just started getting screened for en masse yesterday or the day before.
2511,"It's really, really hard to try to compare those 2 circumstances and I think certain media outlets and Twitter personalities are drawing some dumb conclusions."

61 of 600 passengers from South Africa tested positive, variant still unclear

Of the 600 passengers on two KLM flights from South Africa, 61 tested positive for the coronavirus."
2607,The two flights landed at Schiphol yesterday morning.
2608,"All passengers had to be tested, because of the new variant of the coronavirus that is circulating in southern Africa."
2609,It is not yet clear whether the 61 infections are the omikron variant.
2610,All travelers who have arrived from southern Africa since Monday will be asked by the GGD to get tested as soon as possible.
2611,All passengers over the age of 13 who flew from South Africa to the Netherlands had to show a negative rapid test of no more than 24 hours old when boarding.
2612,Only EU citizens were allowed on KLM flights.
2613,"Last night, the GGD said it was still taking into account about 85 positive coronate tests."
2614,That estimate was made after 110 of the 600 test results were known.
2615,"Of those, 15 were positive."
2616,"Omikron variant

Since 12:00 yesterday afternoon, a no-fly zone has been in effect from South Africa and other countries in southern Africa because of the new corona variant discovered there."
2617,"It is the so-called omikron variant, which is currently circulating mainly in South Africa and Botswana."
2618,"According to a WHO working group, this variant of the coronavirus appears to be spreading faster than other variants."
2619,"At the time the outgoing cabinet announced the flight ban, there were still two flights from South Africa en route to the Netherlands."
2620,The passengers all had to be tested at Schiphol on Friday afternoon.
2621,Special test lanes were set up at the airport for this purpose.
2622,"Isolation hotel

Travelers with a negative result may leave the airport."
2623,They will have to spend another five days in quarantine at home.
2624,Passengers who tested positive will be transferred to a guarded isolation hotel at or near Schiphol Airport.
2625,There they must stay for seven days if they have complaints and five days if they have no complaints.
2626,"There is an exception for positively tested travelers who do not have roommates at home who were not on the flight: if they are able to go home with their own transportation, they are allowed to stay in isolation at home."
2627,This means that people living alone and people who were on the road with all their roommates are allowed to go home.
2628,"Understanding frustration

In a statement, the GGD Kennemerland says it understands ""that there has been frustration among passengers about the situation""."
2629,The travelers from South Africa had to wait for hours at Schiphol Airport for the coronatest and then for the results.
2630,"""People have had a long journey and until they land are under the assumption that they will be home in the near future."
2631,"Instead, they are confronted with a situation like we have never experienced before in the Netherlands,"" writes the GGD."

2667,One superspreading event can lead to 100 new infections in a single incident in a single day (like the Washington choir practice event where 1 person infected 52 of the 60 other attendees).
2668,"With low numbers, a single event like that can be very significant at elevating numbers and to start many new transmission chains making it more likely that future superspreading events will be of the same variant."
2669,"I don't have an infinite amount of time to continue this though, later."

2702,"If it spreads faster and it is able to evade the immune function since it is substantially different to Wild Covid, then just as Delta was able to ravage populations, then so will Omicron."
2703,More contageous means more people will become infected and following on even with the same death rate as Wild Covid will mean real numbers of deaths will be greater.
2704,If it is more virulent than wild covid as Delta is then there the death numbers will be a greater %.
2705,The second part of it being more infectious is that the hospital system could collapse under the weight of cases.
2706,Then we will hear about people dying from other things such as heart attack and vehicle accidents.
2707,My son has keratoconus.
2708,He was being monitored.
2709,Then with covid he couldn't get in to see a dr since the specialist had to actually see him face to face to assess his eyes.
2710,Now he got to see the Dr and his eyes had deteriorated substantially in that time.
2711,I am sure there are other people who have slipped through the cracks with their health condition.
2712,Should I get the booster next week like I’m scheduled or wait now?
2713,They'd fill their pool with diarrhea and complain someone pissed in it

2716,It’s too late to contain it.
2717,It’s out and in Europe now.

2719,Just time before it’s found in the states.

2739,"Will it be worse than Delta?, is this media yellow journalism and fear based overreaction?"
2740,If vaccines still protect us from death or severe illness and hospitalizations from this VOC why the doomsday news about Omicorn.

2745,"Stupid question, but how does one strain take over another?"
2746,I would assume someone cannot be simultaneously infected with two strains of covid?
2747,"So, if Omicron is in the system... the door is closed to Delta?"
2748,"And when Omicron leaves the system, a person is hypothetically somewhat immune to Delta?"
2749,"Yes, a lot of the spread in the US arrived from Europe."

2764,Straight no-trolling question: I don't understand how that works.
2765,"If there is no selective pressure for more deadly variants to occur, how then isn't the virus becoming more lethal, causing more deaths, yet it seems to cause more infection, although most people are now vaccinated?"
2766,"AFAIK from personal experience with contagion like flu, the end of the incubation period has always been the most disease spreading time frame."

2776,WITNESS MEEEEEEEE!
2777,Have you ever thought that maybe they closed their border faster this time was due to the backlash they recieved when they didn't close it fast enough and that they don't have any more data than the public on the Omnicron variant?

2917,Do we want vaccines to give us a high degree of immunity?

2967,"Surely it's already in the US, I expect to see that confirmed in the next 48 hours."
2968,The unfortunate thing about all these stories is that there is very little known about the new variant other than through genetic sequencing and comparative analysis to existing variants.

2972,We don't know that yet that was his point.

2976,"I hope so badly it is less deadly, but we will not know for 1 to 2 months, but to be fair we should have good data as of 3 to 4 weeks to make some good guesses."

3036,"Any mutation, not just those working towards becoming a more virulant strains require a sacrifice at some point of the genetic code which the majority of the time leads to a less stable virus that dies out.Unfortunately when the whole world has some form of the virus then it becomes increasing likely that you role 20 die and they all land on 6 so to speak."
3037,"Ironically all of the social distancing has probably been the number 1 contributor to these mutations happening, but ofcourse social distancing is still important, just an unfortunate sideeffect."

3053,The primary endpoint of efficacy for all vaccines was protection against infection.
3054,Almost every single vaccine is designed to prevent infection.
3055,Fauci himself came out and said the line of thinking in your comment is wrong.
3056,We test a lot (our testing labs are actually saturated by all the work to be done).

3127,This is the scary thing.
3128,A variant that’s way more infectious but doesn’t make people very sick (or even symptomatic) will spread faster and infect way more people.
3129,Even more if it evades vaccines and/or pre-existing immunity.

3325,But don't worry!
3326,"For those of us who weren't previously infected but got the vaccine(s), recent studies have shown that we still benefit from long term T-cell protection!"
3327,I think it was Penn who did a study in August that showed the mRna vaccines elicited a strong response of CD4 T-cells (these are the cells that produce antibodies) and CD8 T-cells (these are the killer cells that wipe out the virus).

3349,The variant actually gives a distinct PCR signature in the normal test.
3350,The test amplifies 3 genes and one site needed for the detection is mutated so only 2/3 amplify and the one that doesn’t amplify is the S protein.

3383,He sounds like any other virologist or epidemiologist trying not to freak people out about hospitalization.
3384,I haven’t tasted or smelled food in 13 months
3385,I think some think mutations are like the Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles.
3386,Baby turtles mutate into talking humanoid physically strong creatures totally dissimilar to their original form.
3387,The differences between Omicron and previous variants are so small you’ll need the most precise subatomic instruments to measure them.
3388,"The variant is similar enough for current Covid tests to detect it, so logic follows that the same vaccines will have some measure of effectiveness against it."
3389,IF the variant is more infectuous and IF there is needed a specific booster for it then it will still take months for that to happen.
3390,Mathematical models of pandemic spread show that there's little functional difference between a little initial spreading and a lot of initial spreading as long as there are at least a few infected people in all areas.
3391,The outcome is roughly the same once exponential growth kicks in.
3392,So it's unlikely the border shutdowns really do much here I think.
3393,When they start handing out the good drugs they can shove that thing in my arm.
3394,It's possible but I don't think we know enough yet to tell.
3395,"Why does Omicron, the largest coronavirus, not simply eat the other coronaviruses?"
3396,Go abroad anyway.
3397,It might surprise you how different it is in different countries.

3403,"There was a reporter on this flight that was featured earlier complaining about this being an overreaction despite everyone being tested prior, and most people being vaxxed."
3404,I hope this shut them the fuck up.
3405,I remember thinking about doing a east coast trip to see my friend as numbers were cooling down.
3406,I wanted to do 4 self-tests.
3407,"One the night before, one before plane, one after plane, and another the next night."
3408,People don’t give a fuck and it boggles my mind.
3409,One of the women was unvaxxed and hadn’t caught the virus before to her knowledge.
3410,Imagine rolling those dice.
3411,Good god.
3412,"Yeah, definitely makes sense."
3413,"Sucks that as many as 61 people apparently got inaccurate results, but I guess we don't really know what % that is of the people who took those tests."
3414,Are the delta vaccines affective against it?
3415,RULER OF THE PLANET OMICRON PERSEI 8
3416,Hopefully mostly are infected with omicron.
3417,That means the new variant is very mild and many who got it still can travel on flights.
3418,The moderna booster is a half dose IIUC.
3419,Nope.
3420,Not gonna wear a mask or social distance anymore.
3421,Also a muddying variable is the fact 20% of SAs population is HIV+ and likely more immunocompromised (both in response to the virus and response to vaccines) than the world population.
3422,"Yup, and all of these graphs and stuff have the same problem."
3423,"We're looking at the growth rate of a new variant based on 2-3 days of data when it's likely been spreading for weeks and comparing it to another variant that has very, very few cases in the country."
3424,Omicron became dominant in south africa by having like 80 confirmed cases for context.
3425,"Omicron is also far, far easier to confirm cases of when compared to delta."
3426,"Delta had to be sequenced in a lab which takes days, omicron can literally be confirmed by PCR test so it's very likely that every single case of omicron that gets tested will be confirmed to be omicron where as everyone was likely missing massive amounts of delta cases and just assuming they were alpha or whatever was dominant at the time."
3427,Yeah a number of vaccines need boosters as the wear off after a while.
3428,Tetanus is every ten years for example.
3429,She is unvaccinated.
3430,Thanks!
3431,"That's genetically informative, tho it does emphasize we don't yet have much data on how that variant acts."
3432,"In particular, that analysis fails to cover vaccination status or mention that none of the known symptomatic cases thus far were in fully vaccinated people (as of about half a day ago, IIRC)."
3433,"For example, the breakthrough case in Hong Kong is asymptomatic and the patient was only hospitalized because HK takes *all* cases to the hospital for containment + monitoring."
3434,"Given that vaccines are only provide 90-99% reduction of severe cases, I'm waiting for at least a few moderately symptomatic breakthrough cases before considering the data worth panicking over."
3435,But I'm not an epidemiologist and cautious observation is warranted given how bad covid variants could get.

3468,I WILL DESTROY YOU!
3469,In most countries it took around 5 weeks for delta to go from 100 cases to dominant variant.
3470,So when if it's more contagious than delta we might have at least two months before it takes over the world.
3471,Haaaaang on everyone… let’s just stop clutching our pearls about the whole ‘vaccines might not be as effective’ thing until there’s some EVIDENCE.
3472,it’s def here already.
3473,No question about it.

3477,The idea that it doesn't work is a popular talking point among ignorant social media users.
3478,AFAIK there's a lot of scepticism about its effectiveness in Russia itself.
3479,[removed]
3480,I think there are a lot of questions about data points like that.
3481,There could be mistakes in bias of sample or when test results are collected vs when they are reported as happening that mean the increase is not as great in reality as on the early graphs that end up on twitter or whatnot.
3482,That seems to be based on the graph of it climbing up in percentage of cases faster than delta I was referring to.
3483,"I saw an epidemiologist saying on Twitter that we shouldn’t take that graph at face value because they were doing a lot of targeted testing for it, which naturally would make it go up faster."
3484,"He was still worried tho, and things certainly don’t look good, but it seems too early to be very confident about such crazy numbers."
3485,"5x delta would pretty much be the most infectious disease ever, up there/higher than measles."

3490,I looked it up.

3504,Re: immune escape - Pfizer said it lowers the vaccine effectiveness to 40% but they need to do more tests.
3505,how soon can they test this against antibody response?
3506,fauci was on cnn saying they could do it pretty soon.
3507,If it actually does evade immune response I wonder how long it will take to reformulate mRNA vaccine to target this variant and mass produce - I assume full clinical trials will not be required
3508,A380 can carry more than 800 in an all economy class config.
3509,But in this case there were 2 planes already in the air when the flight ban was announced.
3510,It really does have this insidious vibe.
3511,"It's just a Greek letter, tho."
3512,"&gt;	[T]here was a **50-second window** between closing the door to the room of case-patient C and opening the door to the room of case-patients D and E. Therefore, we hypothesized that suspended aerosol particles were the probable mode of transmission in this instance

3514,Me in January 2021 hearing about a new variant coming out of India...
3515,"Bad feeling, schmeeling."
3516,Use it as a buying op
3517,"Yeah, Russian market tubled while the rest od the world is up only eh?"
3518,"Agreed, fueled by politics for sure."
3519,Also there’s peer pressure if you’re the only one with/without mask.
3520,Many people tend to go with the local style I suppose unless very religious about it.
3521,Yes anyone with a rapid antigen test would have not boarded the flight.
3522,"That line wasn't a quote, it was editorializing."
3523,I started buying today so im not saying the world is going to end.
3524,Im just saying this new variant is definitely worrisome and used the stock market as proof.
3525,What choice do you have?
3526,"Stuck up on essentials, don't forget to buy masks (the KN95 or better ones), take care of your body and pray (I'm not even religious but I guess I will)."

3528,"Stay strong, we'll be fine."
3529,*Fingers crossed*
3530,google this: Omnicron 500% more infectious than Delta.
3531,100 days plus however long it takes the FDA/CDC and the equivalents in other countries to give legal authorization.
3532,"Still, a Delta/Omicron shot by Spring would be awesome."
3533,If it happens I can still keep all my concert and travel/road trip plans.
3534,This.
3535,I remember the numbers just kept growing and growing for that cruise to the point where they added it to most of the initial trackers because it was so bad.
3536,"Send me in a DM then, I don’t even know exactly what to google."
3537,Not much is showing up when I try.
3538,Is the vaccine giving this thing an advantage?
3539,"I got the JnJ on June and then was offered the Moderna booster on Oct. JnJ kicked my ass for 2 days, and with the booster I immediately felt light headed and then I had even worse symptoms for 3 days!"
3540,Sore arm took a while to go but that was a ride!

3545,And you thought it was over!
3546,Lol (s)
3547,Not yet.
3548,This is just the dragon rank.
3549,"Unless, of course, a variant has the potential to evade natural immunity, like Omicron is suspected to."

3553,6 WEEKS?
3554,I thought it would be several months.

3557,Yes.

3567,"No, 30% reduction on hospitalization and 89% reduction on death (1vs9)"
3568,The honest answer would be 1) how long ago were you boosted and 2) where are you going?
3569,"Vaccine seems to wane real fast, even with boosters as demonstrated in israel."
3570,0-4 months seems to be the best spot.
3571,"From 4-8 you should still be protected, but less so."
3572,It seems like from 8-11 months is where anti body count starts falling below the threshold (though i can’t remember exactly what threshold it was.)
3573,"Also, 45% of hospitalized in Germany are vaccinated."
3574,So dont assume you re protected.
3575,Always take precautions.
3576,And now we have this o variant which is Russian roulette.
3577,"No data yet on whether or not vaccines are effective against it but pfizer made a statement saying they expect the vaccine to be way less effective but that if that does prove to he right, they can modify current vaccine to target the new variant."
3578,[removed]
3579,I know the panic right now is crazy but didnt we also kind of panic on that variant after delta too but nothing really happened?
3580,Dumb question....aren't people required to show a negative test before getting on an airplane to another country?
3581,Unlikely this all happened in 12 hours.
3582,I know someone that just left Germany for the US yesterday and she had to test negative that day to get on the plane.

3592,I spent 12 months alone.
3593,Got the vax ASAP.
3594,Always wear a mask.
3595,Then this booster becomes available.
3596,I barely leave home anyways besides some holiday travel next month.
3597,All this news comes out about a variant we may need ANOTHER booster for.
3598,Why bother get this booster?
3599,I’m pro science but I think multiple boosters within line 2-3 months of each other begins to concern me.
3600,I don’t trust our government at all.
3601,I don’t know.
3602,"I want to do the right thing and have tried, but I’m so confused."
3603,Why get this booster now if the new variant evades it?
3604,Is there seriously no risk to all these shots?
3605,"I’m young, but have asthma."
3606,I just don’t know what to do and need guidance.
3607,“That’s a BINGO!”
3608,More land for the rest of us that survive this decade 🤷‍♂️
3609,Should we call this Corona+... or Corona Max?
3610,Do people not need to get tested before they fly?
3611,Sure some will develop covid after but 13.6% seems crazy high considering everyone should have been tested before they flew.
3612,The funny thing about fractions is everybody gets four fourths of a life.
3613,We shall see
3614,&gt; but I simply do not trust officials when it comes to holding up their end of the bargain and removing them.
3615,I don’t understand this at all.
3616,Why?
3617,What precedent do you have that gives you this fear?
3618,The government does not give a damn what you wear on your face.
3619,"If they wanted to force people to wear something, why have they never even attempted it or suggested it before?"
3620,Not to mention that it’s arguably not even in their interests for people to walk around in masks because it makes people harder to identify.
3621,And they sure as HELL don’t have any interest in forcing people to stay home.
3622,People staying home is horrible for the government.
3623,"It badly hurts the economy and that’s like the #1, 2, and 3 thing the people in power want to avoid."
3624,"And that’s all besides the obvious, which is that we just had the heaviest restrictions on public freedoms in living memory, and those are pretty much all gone now in most areas."
3625,"Seriously why the hell would they ever want to keep these restrictions, I want to hear the explanation."
3626,Unbelievable.
3627,They pay you $19.50 an hour and bill the patients the same (if you leave out that pesky decimal point.)
3628,Our medical system is so deeply broken that nobody even know what to say about it - even our “we want to make things slightly better” party barely mentions it anymore.
3629,Well if this thing is as bad as feared you all won't be able to ignore it.
3630,Hope basic measures and vaccines can hold off the worst of it.
3631,But Ohio's vaccine coverage is trash.
3632,Good luck.

3634,"My kids are younger (16 and 18) and they have both fallen into major depression on and off over the last year because they don't know what college will look like for them, or if they will ever be able to move into their own house."
3635,I don't have any wise words but this old Gen X lady hopes like hell that we find our way past this and all you younger people have the same chances to explore that we did.
3636,They treated staff like garbage so what do they expect?
3637,Treat people like they’re expendable and they’ll leave and keep leaving
3638,Fauci said that the Unvaccinated and those that need to get booster shots should go get them but also what needs to happen is all these major big vaccine companies need to give more vaccines to those 3rd world countries thats where alot of these variants are coming from as much as we tell the unvaccinated this isnt a personal choice but a choice that impacts everyone we should hold these major companies to the same standard i get they want to make money but this pandemic might go on longer than it needs to if we keep trying to strong arm these countries that dont got the money for vaccines
3639,Probably much faster like the yearly flu vaccine.
3640,I think these state of emergencies and flight bans are just some cute theatre.
3641,The variant will find its way around the Earth if it wants to.
3642,The only remaining thing to see is how well the new kid on the block can compete against delta.
3643,At what point do we start demanding reparations from China?
3644,This has gone on long enough and has decimated economies worldwide.
3645,When and how do the chinese pay for this?
3646,"Unfortunately, the government doesn't consider Covid dangerous enough to make any serious changes to how things are done."
3647,"Otherwise, we could have trained millions of people on how to handle Covid a year ago and have too many workers instead of too few."
3648,Hey.

3650,Purchase various investments.

3661,Yeah I’m not denying any of that.
3662,My point was just that it’s early yet and we should let the data determine our conclusions.

3676,Let’s check back in a week or two.

3678,But these things snowball.
3679,"That 2-3% becomes 10%, quickly, and then you’re in a bear market."
3680,"Again, hope it’s just a one day, knee jerk reaction and the new version of Coronavirus is nothing worse than we’ve seen."
3681,"But Delta saw no such action, and it was terrible to a huge part of the population."
3682,&gt;Me in February 2020 when the news of the virus first hitting the Pacific Northwest

3689,in the us we barely dipped down to 1/2 of ours and now it’s climbing again.
3690,good for them
3691,"If you're willing to except the coincidence that there was a super spreader event that spread the most mutated spike protein seen this pandemic (nearly double of second place...), and it only spread the brand new variant, not the variant that already made up over 90% of cases in the area, and that this marked the first increase in around 3 months... then you'd still have to admit that this super spreader event led to community spread (quarantine hotel infection in Hong Kong, someone infected from traveling in Egypt, and a 0 year old infected in SA)"

3732,Why would we assume it would be easier than the other variants?
3733,To date they only seem to get worse.....although so far not in a big way   I don't think we have seen any variants that are less deadly than the last.

3745,So I guess there already was a Nu and Xi?
3746,[removed]
3747,It doesn't work like that.
3748,With low levels of spread the variant that arises will be random.
3749,You will get founder effects that can look like this.
3750,"The fact that the virus is spreading again in Gauteng may have nothing to do with the properties of the variant, but with behavior there, or something else (possibly just the 6 month waxing and waning of the virus as people go from being careful to not being careful)."
3751,The increase of spread amplifies whatever variant is lucky enough to be there.
3752,The test comes when this variant is introduced into areas with lots of Delta spread (Michigan or somewhere like that).
3753,"Delta may also reseed Guateng and take it over again, but right now it faces a competitive disadvantage simply because Omicron has a head start now."

3758,That is so crazy given how spread out deer live and that they don’t move across states or countries.
3759,And they don’t socialize regularly with humans to get infected from them.
3760,Almost unimaginable.
3761,They must be getting it from humans in each state rather than it spreading from deer to deer across the USA.
3762,They don't need to be less deadly with Covid.
3763,Because it doesn't kill too many overall and takes a long time to do it there really is not selective pressure to become less deadly.
3764,This is why covid is the worst of them....
3765,Lol been mask free since May of 2020.

3795,"Yes, Delta does have what appears to be the more useful P681R mutation, as confirmed by in vitro experiments, but its not like that mutation on its own instead of P681H is why Delta outcompeted other variants so easily."
3796,"A lot of the mutations in Omicron have been studied previously, because they did give other variants advantages."
3797,"https://twitter.com/jcbarret/status/1463975708770897923

There's a few levels of coincidence layering up if the first heavily heavily mutated variant from an immunocompromised patient that gets sequenced is also one that gets seeded in a superspreader event rather than the dominant variant in the region, and it is also the same superspreader event that leads to a couple weeks of sustained growth after a few months of decline.."
3798,TIL FSM
3799,How many variants are there lately?
3800,"South Africa, USA and now Belgium"
3801,New strain just dropped dudes
3802,Is there evidence that a booster is actually useful against infection for covid?
3803,Or is it just a nice to have since the CDC isn’t recommending it for 18+?
3804,It will not be ineffective.
3805,It may be less effective against milder disease but still protective against severe disease.
3806,We’ll know in a few weeks.
3807,"Meanwhile, get the booster NOW to protect yourself and your family against the current threat (delta)."
3808,Whether or not a new vaccine might be needed against the new variant is irrelevant to this decision.

3912,Unless you had an abnormally bad reaction to the vaccine imo why not just have the max possible immunity level?
3913,The main reason I’m getting it as a healthy 27 y/o is just to lower the chances of me being a vector that will spread the virus to someone that might day.

3926,Real question: how do they test for the new variant?
3927,Are we testing for the new variant?

3929,a couple of months if it doesn’t breakthrough the vaccinated people.
3930,otherwise is gg and it will be in weeks
3931,I didn't say anything about boosters.

3937,&gt; South Africa's test positivity rate is like 2%.
3938,Both of those numbers can't be right.
3939,Coronavirus-positive travelers are not a self-selecting demographic that all board the same plane together.
3940,"If 14% of airplane passengers are infected, then a similar figure must apply to the general population where they came from."
3941,"The sister took Covid rapid tests, which are probably antigen-based rapid tests and not PCR tests."
3942,Different brands of antigen rapid tests use different antibodies targeting different viral epitopes.
3943,"So it's possible, but unlikely, that Omikron might not trigger a positive on a rapid test."
3944,"For flu that has to do with the 8 different possible segments of the genome, where different segments can combine creating new strains, but it’s the same virus family."
3945,For colds they are different coronaviruses or rhinoviruses completely.
3946,It has to do with the genome of the virus and the disease is causes.
3947,If virologists collectively determine that this new strain is sufficient genetically different then it can be a new virus.
3948,Really the species names for viruses is very complicated because viruses aren’t living species.
3949,Generally the species is determined by a various number of pathogenicity factors.
3950,"SARS-CoV-1 while it gives the same disease acute respiratory distress syndrome, it spreads exponentially less than alpha coronavirus."
3951,"Which means even better cause the more the undetected cases, the less the dangerous it is."
3952,In a very real way it is
3953,Each mutant isn't a progression in severity or danger.
3954,It just means there's a mutation.
3955,"Evolution never stops, as long as COVID exists there will be new strains."
3956,"Look at the flu, for example."
3957,False negative PCR results vary by timeline.
3958,Within the first 5 days of infection up to 67% false negative.
3959,By day 5 it’s closer to 20%.
3960,You’re 100% correct though.
3961,Act as if..
3962,"600 passanegers to check, around 110 checked."
3963,So thats around 90 people infected.

3966,I was just looking at their live updates page and didn’t see it.
3967,"Yes, because that's exactly what I'm saying."
3968,There aren't any exceptional circumstances in the world right now that would make mandating everyone to get vaccinated against a virus that had killed millions and made hundreds of millions more sick or anything like that.

4001,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
4002,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
4003,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

4009,"It didnt start at 0 2 weeks ago, but about 3 months given that mutations take time to develope."
4010,This has been said by Prof Balloux.
4011,"Also, there were barely any Delta infections anymore left, so not much to outcompete."
4012,It will be speedier because they’re basically already on phase 2/3.
4013,"The FDA clears any study and in order to do a study on a large sample size like in phase 2/3, they had to prove out the science and dosage in phase 1."
4014,It would make sense to me that if all that was changed was the mrna to encode for a different spike protein and the lipid nanoparticle vehicle for the mrna stayed the same as well as the dosage then the FDA would clear the mrna studies for phase 2/3 based on the results of the original phase 1.
4015,I don’t work in the medical research field though so I don’t actually know for sure
4016,South Africa has a fairly notable seroprevalence despite low vaccination numbers - indicating high levels of natural immunity.
4017,The explosion in cases from Omicron could be purely because it bypasses previously acquired immunity.
4018,"The R0 value could be far below Delta’s, but without protection from infection and the resulting reduction in R0, it now outcompetes Delta."
4019,I’m sure you’ve read most of the theories since you’re a very educated contributor.

Don't think it's off topic really, their Delta having subsided may be offset by the level of antibody protection in the population + much more recent vaccination/lower levels of waning immunity - unless Omicron really has a ridiculous level of immune escape."

4079,There is absolutely no guarantee that we won't still be in this situation by the time that user gets to 24 or 25 years old.
4080,There are hundreds of thousands of scientists all over the world working on ways to beat this thing.
4081,In the first year of the pandemic we saw the maturation and widespread use of two new vaccine technologies (mRNA vaccines and adenoviral vector vaccines) to create vaccines with efficacy higher than anybody dared to hope for.
4082,As well as the development of several new antiviral drugs.
4083,All in less than a year.
4084,Scientific progress isn’t stopping now.
4085,"We may have a few bumpy years where we have to manage living with the virus, wear masks in the winter, etc."
4086,but eventually somebody is going to come up with a vaccine or a drug that is close to 100% effective at preventing infection in the people who take it.
4087,"Once we reach that point, restrictions only need to apply to antivaxxers (if they’re still getting sick in large enough numbers to flood hospitals), everyone else gets pre-COVID life back."
4088,I’m not sure of scientific side but I suggest you research more about the booster side effects.
4089,Because they said is tendentially way lower intensity than the first two times.

4128,That's what I was thinking too!
4129,Fingers crossed!
4130,Your ability to understand a written text is surprisingly limited to provocation.
4131,Mask mandate worldwide will impede the new variant to spread using its high transmissible tendency.
4132,"That’s will save the whole world from lockdowns, stopping the economy and rush new vaccines research."
4133,Next time ask people to elaborate their opinion instead to provoke out of disagreement feelings.
4134,Covid has a huge range a side effects that aren't death.
4135,Plenty that are life altering though.

4137,Seems like that the problem with this variant is that it breaks vaccines.
4138,Keep in mind even if true the median age (per Google) is 27.6 in South Africa.
4139,So that population may not be representative of populations you may be thinking of.
4140,March 2020 was an amazing buy opportunity.

4146,"Whether it's a significant amount that constantly uncover their nose, lower it to their chin, etc, there are a significant amount that do not follow guidelines and I am not going to spend all class every class saying ""raise your mask back up"" 1000 times rather than teaching."
4147,"Also, I may wear it as a state employee and I have my shots, including the booster, but there is an expiration date on how long I will wear this damn thing."
4148,"For one, Covid is not permanently going away and another is I wouldn't put it passed our leaders to mandate indefinite masks indoors simply due to reduction of other things like cold/flu."

4161,"I'm not in an at risk group since I'm a healthy 24 year old with no pre existing conditions, it'd be for my parents who have gotten their boosters already."
4162,I would say not with this variant?
4163,"The viral load must be so high and airborne that it gets into your nasal area within hours and you’ll test positive 

Scary thought"
4164,The problem is if it is the one it'll be too late to fight it if we don't react.
4165,It's just weighing risk.
4166,The risk of inconveniencing travelers doesn't add up to the risk of not getting under control quickly.
4167,So it makes sense to go hard until we know it's safe.
4168,Not the other way around.
4169,Worst ever *so far*
4170,"I’m the same age and for me it’s not even really about covid, the former world was absolutely magical to me - now it’s ruined by social media, the reality that there is literally no hope with climate change, plastic everywhere, the way people date and have relationships has changed for the worse, human connection in general, commercialism, affordability."
4171,"I could go on but it’s all gone to shit, covid is just the icing on the cake."
4172,"The first two shots made me extremely sick for two days each, the first vaccine was bad enough that I was highly considering not getting my second, restrictions and mandates be damned."
4173,I would rather not get any extra boosters than I need.
4174,The craziest part to me is that they looked for so long to find the fomite or direct contact connection.
4175,"It wasn't until they looked at the CCTV to see that it was, in fact, airborne transmission."
4176,"If it were truly an emergency, they'd divert them."
4177,"Getting downvoted for spitting facts, ouch."
4178,"Interesting must have changed since I was there, at that time most were not masked on the Strip"
4179,You do you but if the shots made you that ill I would be more worried about covid then being out of commission for a couple of days.
4180,That being said I am a random internet stranger you are best positioned to decide what is best for you.
4181,"Ok, this might be getting into TMI territory, but it's a legit question."
4182,"I moved to Italy from the US in August, and I have a bidet in the bathroom."
4183,"I love the thing, but I still wipe before using it."
4184,"I'd feel absolutely disgusting reaching back there with my hand to wash, if I hadn't yet wiped away all the mess."
4185,"Do people really just hop from toilet to bidet without any intervening steps, and get their hand all up in that stuff?"
4186,"For reference it's [this sort of bidet](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/bidet-with-running-water-top-down-with-copy-space-picture-id1158965959?k=20&amp;m=1158965959&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=OQ4y4jahL-BwqMauZfjl3lPp_lKLQ394CPskG0ArSB8=), there's no way to aim a stream at your butthole for hands-free cleaning."
4187,Why would you hold off on the booster now?
4188,Don't you think there might be planes in the air currently?
4189,Selfishness.
4190,"I know people who leave the netherlands now because they can't eat out and do things, so they go to a country with less strict measures."
4191,Honestly we should just stop all non-essential travel right now.
4192,"If it’s airborne and hangs around the air like passive smoke and mist it’s likely they were infected on the plane ✈️ 

It must be all over the air in the plane, like the the fog from snowlike and people are  just breathing it in"
4193,That's a total guess on their part and having a booster before will only help.
4194,We don't know how bad this variant is or if another will just supersede it.
4195,Get whatever protection you can I say.
4196,"The first two shots made me extremely sick and took me out for two days, hence my hesitation towards getting a booster now then a strain specific booster later."
4197,&gt; Which is demonstrably better and wider protection than immunity conferred by vaccination.
4198,"Not according to [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html), but we’ve gone pretty far off topic."
4199,Is this a reaction to Omi?
4200,Or was this planned before?
4201,Anyone else feel sorta relieved when they see a regular ol' Delta headline?
4202,Omicron has sent us all into a frenzy.
4203,you missed Beta which was South Africa before
4204,"I know life is hard now, but don't give up."
4205,We will get through this.
4206,[removed]
4207,We’ll know the verdict on how bad this is once they have some good data on transmission and have the data on how it does with the vaccines.
4208,I wouldn’t imagine 10% testing positive after taking a test 24hr previously is common though
4209,"Looking ahead… when the Pi variant comes out, do we get a slice of apple or chocolate after we get the Pi booster?"
4210,"Portugal, too."
4211,I know someone who went there for this reason.
4212,Very selfish.
4213,Just get booster and then get the new one when ever it is released?
4214,"The booster might still help with nu, not enough data, but will def help with any delta and more ""traditional"" strains."
4215,So nothing to lose baring a slight prick.
4216,The 100 day thing is just the theoretical time to manufacture it.
4217,It would still need FDA approval.
4218,"Meanwhile, news of a handful of cases of Omicron doesn't change the fact that we are in a fall-winter spike of good old Delta."
4219,"That new Pfizer one could possibly used prophylactically, it hasn’t been tested in that roll yet, but theoretically it could be effective as a prophylactic."

4230,"&gt; Nobody wears mask in the US, no protocol enforcements

The U.S. is quite diverse."
4231,Think of it like Europe with each state as different countries (or all the countries in South America).
4232,"In my area (CA bay area), everyone wears masks, there are strict covid protocols, 90% of eligible population is vaccinated, and the case rate per capita is lower than compared to Chile."
4233,Georgia is one of the most anti-mask/vaccine states in the country.
4234,"So that's what you're experiencing, but it's not representative of the entire country."
4235,It would be like someone going to Brazil and saying no one cares about covid in South America.
4236,"&gt;	[after they] received this knowledge, a third of the passengers still refuse to wear masks

This is just beginning to seem like suicidal behaviour by the unvaxxed and anti-maskers to me at this point."
4237,"Well, to be fair, the ""greatest generation"" raised the boomers."
4238,"I was gonna get my booster tomorrow but I'm reading Moderna is gonna put out an Omicron specific booster within 100 days, so I'm thinking of holding off on it."
4239,What would be the good news version?
4240,Because the bad news would be that this variant is more infectious but less deadly meaning we're a step closer to COVID being endemic and having waves and variants every year.
4241,The apocalyptic news would be it is more deadly and evades current vaccines.
4242,It's even worse if we band together.
4243,Then we start invading random countries to kill innocent people.
4244,That’s a really good point man
4245,They didn't test one of the last SA flights into the UK.

4249,I'm putting all of my money into stocks
4250,No the markets are reacting to the potential downside of Omnicorn compared to Delta.
4251,Main issue being how effective it is vaccine wise which we won't know for 2 weeks.
4252,The market hates uncertainty.
4253,"One might imagine, though, that over time as new variants become worrying enough to justify a Greek designation, they will be worrying precisely because they have one-upped existing countermeasures."
4254,An omega variant would by definition be concerning to us because it evades whatever defenses we have erected vs delta/omicron/etc.
4255,Thus I believe Omega (or some later letter) will likely be worse.
4256,[removed]
4257,It’s absolutely crazy how the  media is pushing this.
4258,I saw comments from WHO researchers that it may “become as infectious as Ebola”.
4259,It’s completely irresponsible.

4261,"irrelevant, going to happen anyway."
4262,"I see many contradicting messages from SA, some are downplaying Omicron and telling us there are mostly mild cases and then there are these articles with mostly bad news.."
4263,Waiting in line at the vaccination bus for my booster injection
4264,Okay so what I'm confused about is this: are most of these hospitalisations from the new variant?
4265,"If so, how does that fit in with scientists and doctors indicating that the majority of the new cases are mild?"
4266,The article mentioned rapid tests which suggests the antigen based ones and experience suggests that they are only accepted from recognised test stations (at least that was when I flew).
4267,The accreditation is local though and there may be different standards in  the EU to those in South Africa.
4268,More mutations isn’t necessarily bad.
4269,There is emerging evidence that Japan’s COVID wave fizzled out because the virus mutated too much: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/18/national/delta-variant-self-destruction-theory/
4270,"In the past 2 years but especially in the last few days, people are forgetting just how amazing and adaptable a healthy human immune system is, even without any vaccine."
4271,For most people who have been vaccinated there probably isn't _that_ much to worry about on a personal level.

We’re not living in a movie people, reality doesn’t have foreshadowing for the big act three plot twist."

&gt;a negative NAAT (PCR) test result based on a sample collected no more than 24 hours before departure in the foreign country, or;

&gt;a negative NAAT (PCR)test result based on a sample collected no more than 48 hours before departure in the foreign country AND a negative antigen test result based on a sample collected no more than 24 hours before departure."
4293,"So, they didn't just take a relatively inaccurate rapid antigen test but also a very accurate PCR test."
4294,"If we ignored the possibility for fraudulent tests (which is clearly a possibility), most of those 61 passengers must've contracted the virus within those 48–X hours since their PCR test."
4295,Some may have already had contracted it previously but it wasn't detectable yet.
4296,"This means that we can't come to any concussion yet about the passengers' apparent asymptomaticnes, since severe symptoms would still take days to develop."
4297,The 10% infection rate within 48 hours also suggests an extremely high number of positive cases in South Africa OR an extremely high R0.
4298,"Considering that antigen tests have an accuracy of around 50%, we can also assume that if the passengers went the 48-hour PCR test + 24-hour antigen test route, there should've been a large number of empty seats (up to 60) on that plane."
4299,"I'm not sure whether KLM has so far commented on how many passengers had to cancel their flight in advance, due to a positive test."

4302,I hope you are seeing a therapist?
4303,Atleast that part helps me going on.
4304,Fucking same.
4305,I think it’s too early to tell whether the variant is less virulent.
4306,I haven’t seen any information on the age or health of those who tested positive.
4307,It could be that they were infected recently and before symptoms developed.
4308,It could also be that vaccination or immunity from prior infection are protective.
4309,Or they were bribed
4310,"There’s already an Epsilon, and others."
4311,"But they were never variants of concern, merely variants of interest."
4312,They couldn’t hold a candle to Delta so they never really did much.
4313,People have made this part of their personality.
4314,They get to use it as a hammer to beat on people who disagree with them politically while also pretending they’re the main character in their personal marvel movie.
4315,Threatening to take that away from them is going to cause a pushback.
4316,I did.
4317,"We've known of omicron for ~5 days, but it can take up to two weeks to see symptoms from an infection."
4318,And almost half of the spike mutations have never been seen before.
4319,"I'm glad the handful of positive cases seem to be mild, but it's too early to know just how this variant will perform."
4320,Whether Omicron has a different incubation period than previous lineages a complete unknown.
4321,"If its incubation period is shorter, for instance, then the transmission advantage we're seeing from its rate of spread actually gets cut dramatically."
4322,So they became positive during the flight?
4323,That’s just bad.
4324,"He likely wouldn't be helping anyone is what I'm arguing, weighted against a moderate downside."
4325,Even were anyone in the situation to catch it at this point it would likely be mild and not spread much at all.

4330,"Yes, but in the alphabetical order of the Greek language which isn't the same as the English alphabet."
4331,Here's the wiki on the [Greek Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet).
4332,There is no letter 'J'.
4333,In modern Greek the English letter 'H' is represented by an apostrope (') when it is the first letter of a word and the second letter is a vowel.
4334,It is placed either before the vowel or over a lower case vowel.
4335,The upper case Greek letter that looks like an English 'H' is eta (Η η) which is pronounced somewhat like the 'i' in 'machine'.
4336,Greek letters representing a series of items are quite common in various fields of scienific writing.
4337,The field where this labelling really 'goes to town' is astronomy.
4338,A constellation may contain many more stars than those which have a common name.
4339,"Here, for instance, is a [list of the stars in the constellation Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Leo)."
4340,Note that astronomers ran out of Greek letters and had to use Arabic (common) numbers.
4341,This is a reasonable take and doesn’t involve any kind of scaremongering.
4342,It’s a rational assessment of events over the last couple years and demonstrates a clear understanding of human behavior.
4343,So of course that warrants a ban.
4344,I expect that some things have changed permanently.
4345,We won’t necessarily know what they are until we get to some sort of stable state.
4346,Am I the only one who thinks the fact 10% of people are positive is some what good news.
4347,They must have a seriously mild infection to sit on a flight.
4348,Same.
4349,People have been done for a while.
4350,Thanks for that.
4351,"It looks like this happened: 

&gt; Officials said on Friday evening they expected around 85 people would prove positive, after initial tests suggested a 13% infection rate, but told news agency ANP later the actual total is 61.

https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/11/61-passengers-on-south-africa-flights-test-positive-for-coronavirus/

So the 61 would be more accurate."
4352,Can you imagine the US testing everyone on a plane?

4370,"As German Health Minister Jens Spahn said a few days ago: ""Probably by the end of winter, pretty much everyone in Germany will have been vaccinated, recovered or died."""
4371,"With more than 10% being positive on the two flights from South Africa, we can only assume that this variant is already in every country on earth."
4372,I guess sequencing will show us within a couple of weeks.

4382,Waiting a couple months when everybody in said situation is already moderately protected is more than fine.
4383,No one should have to needlessly suffer just to appeal to sense of communal risk aversion despite the factors at play.
4384,"It's annoying to see a lot of the comments in the thread blaming and demonizing the US, despite this being about a strain found in South Africa and now in Europe."
4385,"This isn't just a US problem, this is a problem caused by the entire world."
4386,"Yeah I'd rather not have sat in my house pretty much every day for the last 2 years working and living at home with no social life or fun activities planned elsewhere, but it's a hell of a lot better than putting others and myself at risk."
4387,Wish everyone else felt the same.
4388,Holy fuck it was!
4389,How time flies!
4390,"Generally as a citizen returning to your own country, you don't need to be vaccinated."
4391,Like the unvaccinated woman who flew from Egypt to Belgium with the new variant.

4393,"&gt; less likely to experience serious symptoms

This is good for them, but it also makes them much more deadly carriers."
4394,"That sounds like a movie title:  
Goodnight Mr. Omicron"
4395,"&gt; “We’re seeing a marked change in the demographic profile of patients with COVID-19,” Rudo Mathivha, head of the intensive care unit at Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, told an online press briefing."
4396,"&gt; “Young people, in their 20s to just over their late 30s, are coming in with moderate to severe disease, some needing intensive care."
4397,"About 65% are not vaccinated and most of the rest are only half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha."
4398,"“I’m worried that as the numbers go up, the public health care facilities will become overwhelmed.”

&gt; What looked like a cluster infection among some university students in Pretoria ballooned into hundreds of new cases and then thousands, first in the capital city and then to nearby Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest city."
4399,"&gt; [...]

&gt; “It’s a huge concern."
4400,"We all are terribly concerned about this virus,” Professor Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, told The Associated Press."
4401,"&gt; “This variant is mostly in Gauteng province, the Johannesburg area of South Africa."
4402,"But we’ve got clues from diagnostic tests ... that suggest that this variant is already all over South Africa,” said Hanekom, who is also co-chair of the South African COVID Variant Research Consortium."
4403,&gt; “The scientific reaction from within South Africa is that we need to learn as much as soon as possible.
4404,"We know precious little,” he said."
4405,"“For example, we do not know how virulent this virus is, which means how bad is this disease that it causes?”

&gt; A key factor is vaccination."
4406,The new variant appears to be spreading most quickly among those who are unvaccinated.
4407,"Currently, only about 40% of adult South Africans are vaccinated, and the number is much lower among those in the 20 to 40-year-old age group."
4408,And if it stops magnitudes dying so be it
4409,"Looks like there would be a number of options: the variant isn't detectable at this early stage, it's a variant harder to detect with the current tests, test results were falsified, multiple people were infected during the flight after their initial test."
4410,"This is a work place safety issue, isn't it?"
4411,"Delta was first sequenced in December, researched for months, and and finally caused a surge in India in late March."
4412,"At one point Delta cases were increasing in India by over 50% per week, an incredibly fast rate we have rarely seen since the very start of the pandemic."
4413,Alpha cases remained roughly low and constant during that time.
4414,"Omicron was first sequenced on Tuesday, researched on Wednesday, and is now causing a measurable surge in South Africa on Thursday."
4415,"Omicron cases appear to be increasing in South Africa in the vicinity of 3-to-6 fold per week, though this has only lasted for 1-2 weeks."
4416,Delta cases have remained roughly low and constant during that time.
4417,These are not comparable scenarios.
4418,Either the South Africa numbers are wrong or Omicron is going to spread *incredibly* quickly.
4419,Additional speculation about immune escape or virulence is unfounded entirely; aside from the genomic sequence we simply know nothing.
4420,"There is absolutely no reason to panic about those, but by the time we do have them Omicron could have grown in absolute prevalence by several or many orders of magnitude."
4421,The thing we'll probably find out first (hopefully tomorrow) is drop in neutralization titers after vaccination or previous infection.
4422,I will but I had my third last week so that is a lie.
4423,Booster are effective stop trying to pretend otherwise.
4424,[removed]
4425,Could it be that the industries were preforming better compared to when delta came on the scene?
4426,"Many countries have been emerging out of lockdowns, people were largely more comfortable with going out more, the same wasn't necessarily true with delta."

4440,"&gt;	That said, get vaccinated."
4441,Better to not get it than to get it.
4442,Vaccinated + regular testing and treatement as soon as you get positive result.
4443,thst should be enough to drop the death to neglible number.
4444,but I would say very regular testing seem critical due to the long  asymptomatic phase:(
4445,"They just sequenced it, and are going to test how the antibodies work in a lab."
4446,I think they can test for it specifically in a few days maybe but it could take a little longer.
4447,"Possibilities:

* They were already infected prior to boarding the flight."
4448,"This would mean that the rapid test didn't catch it well, or a significant percentage of the tests was faked."
4449,* The infection became detectable during the flight.
4450,"Unlikely that 10% of the passengers were undetected before boarding, but had detectable levels on arrival."
4451,"If true, a much higher percentage of the passengers will have detectable levels very soon."
4452,* They became infected on the plane.
4453,"From what we know, the incubation time for covid to be detectable is much longer than 12 hours."
4454,"Regarding the chance of all them ending up on the flight, there may be an unfortunate selection bias that people with even a tiny hint of symptoms may want to get home as soon as possible."
4455,I'd be interested in hearing which percentage of passengers could not make the flight due to testing positive.

4469,"A lot of scientists kinda rail against the lockdowns, they say they don’t work, but the pandemic has kinda illustrated two different scenarios."

4474,"I would guess if all of them are EU citizens that most are vaccinated, and rapid antigen tests are known to be way less sensitive if the viral load is small."
4475,"They're just not very accurate when used precautionary a single time, they are more for symptomatic testing or regular tests."
4476,"Anecdotally, of the 5 vaccinated people i know that had mild covid only one had been positive on most rapid antigen tests they made at home before contacting authorities, one almost didn't contact them since only the first test out of 6 he made had been positive."
4477,"&gt; Passengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam 

That's not good."
4478,"They know there were 10% of the people on that plane with covid, but they are still allowing them to fly on to other countries?"
4479,"The assumption should be everyone on the aircraft has the new variant, unless it can be proven otherwise - and they should all be in isolation."
4480,They don't know if it's the Omicron or the Delta yet.
4481,"""Expert goes against the fearmonger narrative, thus is downplaying"""
4482,This just shows how ineffective these travel bans are as is tbh.

4486,Ambulances were queuing at the hospitals unable to deliver patients because the ICUs were full.

4488,Most countries experienced a spike of infections and deaths due to Alpha and Delta that could have been avoided if timely action had been taken.
4489,at this rate we will reach Omega next year..

4493,If it was me I would get it...
4494,In fact I am triple jabbed as just trying to do what ever I can to help beat this virus.
4495,Exactly.
4496,"I totally support lockdowns to buy people time to vaccinate, increase hospital capacity and the development of new vaccines."
4497,I travel and wear my mask.
4498,I will follow any quarantine procedure or testing procedure that is mandatory.
4499,"Not everyone can life a sedentary life within their own borders, or cities like this person who I was originally responding to believes."
4500,Ha...mine is an A4.
4501,Can't wait to deal with another year of the chucklefucks.
4502,That’s not what mild means in clinical terms.
4503,Mild basically means ‘not hospitalized’.
4504,"It will still be most likely be very bad on the unvaccinated, similar to Delta."
4505,"I’m pro-lockdowns, but I know it’s not going to happen."
4506,And it’s too late anyway.
4507,"We have to start mitigation measures again, which I never really stopped doing."
4508,I'm really trying to keep this in mind.
4509,"from every legitimate article I've read, it's literally just like ""yes this is concerning but no we don't know anything about it at all and it might be more resistant."""
4510,it's kind of just the reaction of people that has unanimously decided this is worse than Delta and will take over and will be vaccine resistant.
4511,"I mean, that could totally be the case, sure."
4512,but the only information we know as of right now is that people who know what they're doing are concerned but don't know much about it rn.
4513,"I don't think travel bans are a severe reaction, I think that's completely reasonable."
4514,idk.
4515,honestly what the fuck else can we do besides stay up on the news and wear masks?
4516,fucking honestly.
4517,"At this point I'm positive an alien invasion would be met with a sizeable portion of the population trying to cozy up to them for perks/using them as a weapon against the terrible, bad, not good people."
4518,"Right I’ve been under the impression that travel restrictions don’t work to stop spread, they may only help slow it?"
4519,"By the time we find a variant and  identify it, is probably too late."
4520,Even Australia already has 1 confirmed case of Omicron.
4521,"If you've waited to do a lockdown until it's your ""last resort"", you've waited too long."
4522,"If we had any sense at all, we'd be locking down for two weeks right now to give scientists the time they need to come up with the answers we all need regarding how transmissible omicron is and what level of illness it capable of causing in the vaccinated."
4523,"Because if the answers to those questions are not what we hope, then we are going to be in a world of hurt in just a few weeks, at which point it will be truly impossible to put the cat back in the bag and we will be facing another catastrophic round of infections."
4524,A couple of weeks locked down is nothing compared to the consequences of not acting soon enough.
4525,On a tour bus and heard the couple behind me talking about drive-thru testing.
4526,Guy has been sniffling the entire time.
4527,So that’s fantastic.
4528,"For the record, I understood the risk in doing a tour, but good God people."
4529,"Covid or not, stay the hell home if you have the sniffles."
4530,You spoke to soon
4531,That woman  quoted is an idiot.
4532,"An airplane is not only well ventilated, much better than a house with doors and windows closed, AND it is HEPA filtered."
4533,Yes same here.
4534,I am in the US and my family are in the U.K. I’ve had my tickets booked for about a month.
4535,"I doubt I will cancel, my whole family is vaccinated and my parents just got their boosters."
4536,The only change I may make is to see less friends/go out less and stay at home with my family.
4537,Given COVID will become/is already endemic there is never going to be a time without risk and I think we just have to live with that and manage our own risks/expectations.
4538,The OP here is here blaze about calling people dumb without considering circumstances and the bigger picture.
4539,A lot of people (like us 2) really want to travel specifically because we haven’t been reckless and we have held off for 2 years now.
4540,Agree on the insurance issue.
4541,Potentially you can get a flight refund for a voucher or if it’s flexible move it to a flight in the spring.
4542,Are you telling me they can come from the other side of the world with an antigen test and we have to get full PCR to travel inside the EU?
4543,This doesn’t feel right.
4544,I tried using antigen test to fly and got a fat NO by the airline.
4545,"If you are vaccinated, you have done what is likely the most effective thing to avoid severe COVID."
4546,Ensure you are eating well and doing some exercise and continue to mask up and limit your exposure to strangers and you will be fine.
4547,We have no control over what happens here and you only control what happens to you.
4548,Give it a few weeks for more data to come out.
4549,The way I see it currently is that if this had not been detected we may never have noticed a difference other then an upswing in new cases.
4550,Untill fully vaccinated people are dying from infection not a lot has changed for us fully vaccinated people.

4561,Does anyone have the link to the variant tracker?
4562,I saw it posted the other day.
4563,I am loving that (most) cooks at restaurants are wearing masks.
4564,"I only get take-out or at food trucks, but if I can peek into the kitchen and see everyone masked up, they have my loyalty for life."
4565,I hope this trend continues!
4566,We do not have home tests
4567,Lockdown for what purpose exactly?
4568,"We didn't lock down because of delta, because there was no reason to."
4569,"Unless data points to this being significantly more deadly than any past variant, lockdowns are beyond pointless."
4570,"I didn't mean simply that more hosts = more mutations (although that is true), I meant more that a virus can spread and mutate in one singular host far faster and more effectively if they're unvaccinated."
4571,You'd rather have 100 minor infections with very minor mutations than 1 severe infection with multiple deep infections.
4572,South Africa has plenty of vaccines.
4573,It's a demand problem not supply.
4574,[removed]
4575,Not necessarily.
4576,We don't know enough about this variant and its infectiousness yet.
4577,You could have just read the article
4578,"Yes, it delayed the spread in other countries."
4579,Obviously this was prior to vaccines so the delay had limited efficacy.
4580,"But that's the key here, delaying it."
4581,Christmas is literally a few weeks away.
4582,"It makes sense to buy time before multigenerational household mixing, to boost as many people as possible and learn more about the variant and whether vaccines need to be adapted."
4583,"So by your own words you are ""selfish and entitled"" right?"
4584,"Or can you confidently level that bold claim at 25 million people in one broad stroke, well of course except for yourself?"
4585,Classy mate.
4586,How terribly sad.
4587,"One has to wonder, though, if this was a ""natural"" death or one specifically *caused* by COVID."
4588,No discussion of autopsy in the article.
4589,Thank you for this information.
4590,I was looking for a comparison of symptoms between the second dose and the booster.
4591,I was also hoping the booster might be a little different bc it’s half the dose but I’ll still take it.
4592,"Copying my comment above:

From the statement about this strain on the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529\)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern)

""This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning."
4593,"Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs""

And 


""Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation."
4594,"Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage."""
4595,"Basically, they flagged it as a Variant of Concern because it seems to allow reinfection (though this is only from preliminary evidence so it's more just being cautious I think)  and is being detected in a high number of cases vs other strains."
4596,"Though that second note is confusing, I can't tell if that's saying it's actually more prevalent or just easier to identify because a specific target gene that we look at is affected."
4597,I didn’t make it champ
4598,"We do not have home tests
We have PCR and antigen tests at government testcentres"
4599,Doubt it.
4600,You pick up home tests ?
4601,"It’s also not about seeing someone when they are actively dying, but getting to make memories while they are alive."
4602,"It’s those memories you don’t get a second chance at, and what makes those people so impactful on your life, character, etc."
4603,"For what it's worth, I'm in the same boat as you."
4604,"Been living in Europe, and I haven't seen my family in Canada since September 2019."
4605,"I bought flights home for Christmas a couple months ago, just before this new wave of the virus kicked back up."
4606,"If all holds constant, I still plan to go, since I won't be able to get the flights refunded unless my travel gets cancelled due to the virus."
4607,"Unfortunately travel insurance and the airlines don't view ""precautionary"" cancellation as a legitimate reason to cancel your flights."
4608,"That's a great link and set of graphs, but how does it make sense both vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalizations were low last January, when covid was at its worst?"
4609,These are the idiots driving the pandemic.
4610,Every single positive test.
4611,"And we test roughly 500.000 people every day out of a population of 6 million

We are one of the countries in the world that do the most testing per capita"
4612,Yeah I will definitely wear a mask in the future if I've got a cold but need to go out.
4613,I used to think people who did it pre-COVID were over-cautious weirdos about pollution but obviously don't think that anymore lmao.
4614,Oh I absolutely agree with you - I'm not for one moment suggesting we should be going into lockdown now as a preventative case.
4615,I was just highlighting the irony that so far the most reliable way to prevent a lockdown is... lockdown.
4616,Wow I’m shocked that a anti-vaxxer is also a racist who can’t even resist putting racism in there anti-vaxx meme.

4666,Ignoring the give and take - if they only offer a 24hr period before a flight then they have to rely on rapid tests.
4667,For a PCR test the reasonably need to give passengers 48-72hrs.
4668,Testing within a day would be when the viral load is highest so would help the lackluster sensitivity

""Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation."

4780,He said that it **could** evade immunity based on current data.
4781,Why are you trying so hard to make this random scientist say things he never did?
4782,Because of genome analysis.
4783,"It has several mutations that are associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion, far more than any previously discovered variant."
4784,FWIW I'm not sure many people are assuming that the variant \*will\* be worse.
4785,"Simply that it has a \*good chance\* at being worse, so governments are trying to be proactive in case that turns out to be true."
4786,"To be clear, many people with weak immune systems who catch COVID apparently do survive."
4787,But sadly some of them linger a long time and then die.
4788,Very good question.

4796,"Well, it's just the usual trade off between the economy and disease then, I guess."
4797,It still doesn't mean that wealthy people need to haul their asses all over the world for a new kind of fun.
4798,"&gt;  both fully vaccinated and both contracted covid

how sick did they get?"
4799,"The purpose of inbound travel restrictions is to slow down the ingress of variants from abroad, and subsequently the pace in which they become endemic."
4800,"The travel ban is working exactly as intended, and is buying more time to enact contingency measures domestically while the new strain is researched."
4801,Memory cells recognize more of the spike protein than antibodies.
4802,This is why we still saw great prevention of severe disease against Delta.
4803,What the supply-side Jesus types are missing in their own dogma: *if God loved them they would already be wealthy and would have been able to afford the expensive treatments politicians get.
4804,*
4805,As is typical there’s no info yet on why anyone should fear omicron any more than other variations.
4806,Typical fear based reporting.
4807,"Yes, we were pretty disheartened by it."
4808,This variant is easier to detect.
4809,The PCR test checks for three markers.
4810,"For this variant, one marker is not giving a positive."
4811,So the PCR result shows the difference immediately compared to Delta.
4812,The same was true for the (now disappeared) Alpha variant.
4813,"In fact, this is how the UK first detected the Alpha variant."
4814,Otherwise they have to fully analyse the virusses genome.
4815,Were you boosted?
4816,"If not, when was your second shot?"
4817,My kids (2) got COVID a few weeks ago but every adult in the house (4) is fully vaccinated + boosted and we got through it without testing positive.
4818,"Yes, because morons are living in fear."
4819,"Again, not a doctor."
4820,But covid seems to mutate pretty easily...like the flu.
4821,"I’m sure it would be the same, with the caveat that it depends on how long ago your booster was."
4822,"If it’s been 6 months or so since the mRNA booster, you’d probably see a benefit."
4823,"J&amp;J was one dose because two doses wasn’t a whole lot better in trials, not because one dose was so amazing that a second wasn’t necessary."
4824,A J&amp;J with Moderna or Pfizer booster is probably fairly equivalent to two doses of Pfizer or Moderna.
4825,It always bugged me that the public messaging treated one dose of J&amp;J as equally “fully vaccinated” as two doses of the mRNA vaccines.
4826,"I’m not an epidemiologist or directly researching covid, but I do have a PhD in molecular biology and wrote my dissertation on evolving antibody evasion in viruses."
4827,I’m aware of this - but there’s a balance to be stricken.
4828,6 feet will keep you relatively safe in the majority of situations.
4829,"Plus, it’s not as if many people are sneezing directly at you - most people cover their nose with their hands or elbow significantly reducing the spread."
4830,Yes!
4831,Another excuse for me to yell at complete strangers and feel some meaning in my poor excuse of a life!
4832,I haven't left my house in 2 years!
4833,Look how virtuous I am!

4843,Rip.
4844,Thank you for your clarification.
4845,They believe that covid surging means vaccines don't work.
4846,So why should they get them?
4847,Its idiotic but this is all over their groups.
4848,To them it proves it doesnt work so why is it mandatory.
4849,I don't agree for clarification.
4850,... aaand so does Omicron
4851,People being more clever than you is most likely a daily regular for you my friend
4852,Omicron is the letter O in the Greek alphabet.
4853,"So, not omi, just O."
4854,"Not one place in the US had a ""lockdown""."
4855,"We had very, very light restrictions."
4856,New York was the only place that had stricter rules seconded by Los Angeles for obvious reasons.
4857,Everyone always calls it a lockdown but it literally changed nothing.
4858,"You had about a week where everything calmed down, but after that, people were back to normal just masked."
4859,"Restaurants did suffer yes, and thats just part of that business."
4860,Most small businesses don't have enough cash for payroll more than 1 month in advance and thats just another Achilles heel of being a small business.
4861,"English never really made up its mind on what to do with the letter ""x"", so you get weird things like the name ""Xerxes"" pronounced in English as ""Zerkseez""."
4862,"Note that the letter ""x"" gets two different pronunciations in the same word!"
4863,"That's not true in [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I#Etymology), where it's pronounced more like ""Kser-ksees""."
4864,"Similarly, I assume that Greeks would pronounce the word you're alluding to as something like ""kseelophon""."
4865,"If you develop common cold or covid symptoms of any degree it is important to get a PCR test, even when you're vaccinated."
4866,"If you had contact with a positive person, your tracing app goes red, also get a test."
4867,If you are currently infected a PCR test will show that you're positive.
4868,"It will detect very low virus loads because the testing procedure will multiply genetic sample many times, if some is present."
4869,"But if you just got infected, a short time ago and the virus hasnt sufficiently replicated any test will result negative, vaccinated or not."
4870,Its all on a spectrum and not an on/off switch.
4871,"A certain treshold of virus particles is needed to infect you, for some infections this value is quite close or actually 1 virus, for covid its around 1000 iirc."
4872,"But make no mistake, this is a tiny amount you quickly can catch, specially indoors."
4873,It also depends on how strong your immune reaction in your mucosa is.
4874,"Few weeks after your shot local immune system is strong but in a matter of months they drop off, you're still protected against severe disease, and might actually never develop symptoms, but specially with delta your viral load in upper respiratory tract is incredibly high, 1000 times higher than the previous mutations."
4875,Hence you can easily infect others.
4876,This viral load is similar high in the vaccinated but drops off quicker and you less likely get infected in the first place.
4877,Its all a shitty probability game really.

4886,I don’t disagree with you either.
4887,"I prefer a more cautious approach too, but only for temporary time with a goal to eventually get to normal."
4888,The problem I have is some people just have no desire for that and adopted that as new ‘normal’.
4889,"And I’m just not down with, and I don’t think most Americans are either"
4890,COVID certainly will yes and if this is how the world reacts to every new variant that they don't know much about then yeah...
4891,Really there’s no data yet to say either way.
4892,"Best to wait and see, as of right now, most of the world is not in real danger."
4893,"You hear about young, healthy people getting seriously sick with covid because they are outliers and it makes for a sensational story."
4894,"The vast, vast majority of younger and healthy people who got covid were completely fine, even before vaccines."
4895,The vast majority of younger people that were ventilated or died were either morbidly obese or had serious health issues.
4896,"Of course I’m not saying that anyone deserved it, just saying facts."
4897,It's probably all that anyone will talk about for a while.
4898,"Ironically, if it turns out to be less of a threat than first suspected, it will be seen as more ""proof"" of covid hysteria, rather than a successful proactive collaboration among health officials."
4899,What?
4900,"Come visit America and our health care system some time where most places don't have any digitalization at all, and there is not centralization of information."

4918,Right forgot about that.
4919,Then probably meaning 3 doses of any combo.
4920,"Typically the more infectious a virus is, the less lethal it is."
4921,Typically.
4922,"Yeah, no shock that it’s the number."
4923,"We’re also going to see all the places saying “it’s not been detected yet” realizing it’s been there for weeks already, as such has been the story from the beginning…"

4926,We don't know if the vaccines work and to what degree yet.
4927,Loll I had the exact same thought.

4929,I feel terrible for it but deep down I can't help.
4930,"If travel bans were useless, we wouldn't have eliminated flu type b."
4931,Travel bans do work to curb things like this.
4932,The reason SA is probably the origin is because Africa has largely been ignored by the rest of the world when it comes to vaccines.
4933,South Africa is just the most populated.
4934,Blah blah blah
4935,My point is that the US also has abysmal vaccine uptake relative to its capacity.
4936,The US has also made plenty of shit decisions.
4937,"And before you continue to plug India, let’s not forget that the Delta mutation appears to have emerged in India because Modi thought it would be a good idea to hold massive political rallies…

This isn’t a failing of South Africa."

4950,"It’s pretty much guaranteed that we will never find a variant early enough for travel bans to do anything and even if it did, they would probably not have enough teeth."
4951,Prob just need another 14 days to stop the spread.
4952,We good.
4953,"New variants pop up

Article titles “wE kNoW ALmoSt NotHIng aBoUt iT¡¿!”"
4954,Also 2 weeks on average is the time the desease needs to progress to the point that the patient either needs to go to hospital or is getting better.
4955,So everybody confirmed positive now will be monitored through this time.
4956,We will have a much better picture of the situation in two weeks.

5017,"I had a fellow cancer survivor friend die February 2020 on ECMO (not Covid related, her cancer just destroyed her lungs again and again) so I’m way too familiar with what I could face."
5018,I tried requesting masking at my brother-in-law’s funeral (following his Covid death) and they just rolled their eyes at me.
5019,I just burn with rage at them.
5020,They refuse to look up ECMO and prefer to think I’m dramatic about Covid rather than acknowledge it is deadly AF to someone healthy like their brother so what will it be to my disabled body?
5021,They’d prefer me dead than to having acknowledge it.

5025,"&gt;The good news, though, is that if that has been happening and no-one noticed anything was up vs. normal Covid cases, then this new variant may not be that much more transmissible than Delta after all."
5026,"What I read this morning - and I apologize, I don't remember where, but it would have been a mainstream source, is that the regular COVID tests test for two characteristics, one of which is the spike protein."
5027,"But omicron won't trigger a positive spike protein reading, so they figured out they should just test for the other characteristic."
5028,"Given this, it is entirely possible that people have been getting sick, getting a COVID test, and being told that they're negative when in fact they're positive for omicron."
5029,"It is true, as many have pointed out, that we don't have enough information yet to draw firm conclusions either way as to how serious or not serious this may be, but every new development I've read over the past 36-48 hours makes me more concerned."
5030,I basically feel like I did back in January 2020 when I read that the novel coronavirus could be transmitted by those who were asymptomatic.
5031,"The only missing piece with omicron, as far as I can tell, is how serious an illness it tends to cause."

5040,Right now from the tests of people on planes it looks like 10% of SA could be infected with Omicron already.

5050,Get a bidet ;)
5051,Ok but why are so many ppl positive.
5052,Do they still not wear their masks?
5053,I’m in AZ.
5054,"Last weekend in Scottsdale, maybe 5 ppl had masks on in a very crowded shopping center."
5055,We are 60% vaxxed here.
5056,It’s bonkers.
5057,"EMTALA says you have to be seen, not admitted."
5058,"They are obligated to attempt to transfer if medically necessary, but that’s it."
5059,It’s only in the ER.
5060,They don’t have to disclose their admission criteria.
5061,"Most docs will try to admit, but that’s usually bed board or a supervisor decision to assign beds."
5062,"I’ve seen Covid cases sit in the ER  for days getting bumped by other cases, because there wasn’t a Covid room available."
5063,This *might* explain how 10% of that Dutch flight escaped detection via rapid tests before flying
5064,So the exact same DGAF approach to travel that the UK has employed throughout the pandemic.
5065,COVID is very much the problem.
5066,You can’t escape a virus.
5067,"Governments around the world thought they could, and transferred the onus of “stopping” COVID and “returning to normal” on citizens."
5068,It was an unsustainable approach from the beginning and divided countries massively.
5069,"Had COVID been approached rationally (in all countries) from the beginning, we’d be in a very different spot."
5070,There is many reason.
5071,I work in a rather international field and most of us live a continent away from their families and have work obligations they need to go to.
5072,But even for us travel has been restricted to the minimum.
5073,But yah many unavoidables.
5074,Which state in the US will be the first one to detect it?
5075,Got to imagine this new strain is everywhere.

'South Africa has asked Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) and Pfizer (PFE.N) to delay delivery of COVID-19 vaccines because it now has too much stock, health ministry officials said, as vaccine hesitancy slows an inoculation campaign.'"
5078,"In general, I feel that, without compulsory inoculation, seeing high vaccination uptake in African countries will always be a pipe dream"
5079,Probably the fact that there's been no dramatic shift in case rates or hospitalizations as one reason not to freak out.
5080,"But the problem is, this new strain is so heavily mutated they think there’s a decent chance it could evade the vaccines."
5081,And preliminary reports show it could be more transmissible than Delta.
5082,"That’s why everyone is immediately putting in travel restrictions, etc."
5083,"Obviously they can’t stop it completely, but they need to slow it down so the hospitals don’t get overwhelmed and get new vaccines in production."
5084,600 people on one flight?
5085,What type of plane was that?
5086,"So, the opposite of the blockchain."
5087,Lol
5088,"Do you think, if I sent you a funny meme, you might smile today?"
5089,not that I know of.
5090,The tests cost like $150 because only certain testing sites are accepted

5098,"By definition long Covid will take a long time to develop

There’s so few cases of long Covid in the vaccinated it’s not worth worrying about"
5099,"It varies, but it can be."
5100,There are some things that you can know will be permanent regardless of pathology.
5101,I'm sorry for your losses.
5102,"This horrible virus took some people I love out of my life, too."
5103,These are the things on my mind as well.
5104,I would argue the flight ban makes no sense at all.
5105,"If Omicron is already in Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong banning flights from Malawi or Botswana will do absolutely no good because the horse is already out of the barn."
5106,It’s already gone global.
5107,Best thing to do now is hope the vaccines hold the line.
5108,Don't share and nobody can act upon it.
5109,Share and nobody is allowed to act upon it.
5110,What's the difference then?
5111,RemindMe!
5112,2 weeks
5113,This strain will be everywhere soon.
5114,Hopefully the vaccine holds up.
5115,"In hindsight, why was I sitting in a doctor’s office waiting room without a mask, especially during flu season?"
5116,Honestly it's insane no matter the variant.
5117,that wasn't the context of the comment to which you had responded.
5118,see this sentence.
5119,"&gt; ""thousands of people"" still make a miniscule fraction of the 27+% population not vaccinated as per your claimed stats."
5120,Nowhere is the vaccination rate challenged - the only thing that was challenged was the relevance of that statistic.
5121,it doesn't matter if only 5% of the population of only two of your cities are unvaccinated - the thousands of morons protesting vaccination can still fit in that set.
5122,"in short, calling out vaccination rates as a refutation of the article in the OP is an exercise in irrelevance."
5123,How do you scroll through this comment section with nothing but peoples genders in mind
5124,We can and we will.
5125,There’s literally no other choice lol
5126,You can actually be infected with covid and be negative takes time for viral load to build up before you get a accurate reading.
5127,So it’s possible to be infected not test + than a day or two after arrival start being able to spread it before you yourself get symptoms
5128,"If you are vaccinated, practice social distancing when possible, wear a mask and wash your hands and surroundings why should you not travel ?"
5129,There’s now cases of the new strain in the uk according to the news papers
5130,Same with the flights to Switzerland.
5131,LOL
5132,"But the problem is, this new strain is so heavily mutated they think there’s a decent chance it could evade the vaccines."
5133,"Did you love it, did you hate it, what would you rate it?"
5134,"You're the best, you're the best!"
5135,X2 from someone else living in Paris.
5136,DejaVu
5137,We need to stop.
5138,No vaccine for you?
5139,"Ok, here is your itemized bill, please try to pay it before you die in 14 days due to your own stupidity."
5140,Thanks.
5141,great.
5142,"we saw what happened last time there was a new variant, so now for lockdown v3"
5143,This is definitely true.
5144,"We have multiple pandemic examples that we know of where people were exposed infected and hurriedly fled by plane to another location because they ""didn't want to get stuck"" or didn't want the healthcare in that other country."
5145,And?
5146,Ive seen the data it still doesn't change the facts.
5147,Interesting?
5148,"yes,  Bad for the unvaccinated?"
5149,"Yes , highly contagious?"
5150,Yes but also less deadly and Does not make vaccines ineffective.
5151,"Again,  another variation being blown out of proportion for media clicks."
5152,And the new strain is now confirmed to be in the uk.
5153,"There are three important things to know about a virus: how contagious it is, how much immune escape it has, and how severe it is."
5154,The contagiousness we highly suspect is really bad news.
5155,"For immunity, it's important to understand that our body has two immunity systems, antibodies and B/T cells."
5156,From my understanding B/T cells protect more against death and are unlikely to be escaped from.
5157,"However, many scientists are thinking this might be able to escape our antibodies because it has like 10x the number of mutations that Delta did."
5158,"In other words, total immune escape might not happen, but partial immune escape is likely really bad news."
5159,That leaves severity.
5160,"At this point, we have almost no information on that and it will take us a couple weeks."
5161,It's important to understand that the plural of anecdote is not data.
5162,"Additionally, COVID often takes time to ramp up to where it becomes life threatening."
5163,"At this point, severity could go either way."
5164,We could get really lucky and this will be more like a cold.
5165,We could get an apocalyptic scenario of SARS/MERS where we get 10-30% mortality rate.
5166,"At this point, it's probably most likely we'll get a similar mortality to Alpha/Delta, but we really have no idea."
5167,"The real problem is that even if mortality is the same, what we already likely know about contagiousness and immune escape paints a very grim picture for hospitals."
5168,"When we went from Alpha to Delta, it was pretty rough and that was with both natural immunity from Alpha and the vaccines helping."
5169,"If we lose a significant amount of immunity and simultaneously deal with something more contagious than Delta, then the good scenario might still look like India did during the Delta wave."
5170,Tuesday discovery to Friday travel bans without proof?
5171,Why?
5172,I'm in South Africa right now hoping to get back home.
5173,There's a LOT of people who don't feel they need to vaccinate.
5174,Not a supply problem here.
5175,Are there any other countries where covid cases didn't decrease at all after the majority of the population got vaccinated?
5176,It seems like other countries had a lull in cases after the majority got vaccinated but it seems like the opposite is happening in S. Korea.
5177,"Of course, the numbers are still low compared to America and EU but it still seems weird."
5178,Printfriendly worked
5179,"If you want to get time, then ban all international and domestic travel."
5180,What I don't get is why people would elect to travel internationally right now.
5181,"I understand some travel is necessary to keep the world turning, but how are people that dumb?"
5182,And here I am rarely leaving our core metro area because we have a very high vaccination rate compared to all the counties around us.
5183,Haha
5184,We’ve seen reporting that PCR can pic up Om.
5185,We haven’t seen reporting that rapid tests can.
5186,It could be that an already unreliable strain is extra unreliable.
5187,So what's the plan?
5188,"Let's say someone who is young, fully health, and fully vaccinated with Pfizer becomes exposed to Covid on Monday."
5189,They eventually end up contracting an asymptomatic case of it.
5190,"If they get tested on Thursday with a rapid antigen test, will it likely show up as positive?"
5191,Or are they likely to get a false negative?
5192,You know what I hate about this?
5193,"I'm Filipino, and we have one of the strongest lockdowns in the world."
5194,"The longest lockdown, actually, and it's still going."
5195,You CANNOT go into establishments without being fully-vaccinated.
5196,It was only in recent weeks where they loosened restrictions and set the alert level in Manila fo (Level 2) to prepare the economy for Christmas.
5197,"We're FINALLY starting to have classes face-to-face and more businesses open, no more curfew."
5198,"Now that we FINALLY get to open our doors and step outside, another fucking variant is upon us..."
5199,This pandemic will never end...

5207,1.
5208,"South Africa has VERY advanced disease prevention infrastructure as they've had to deal with HIV, Ebola, and TB outbreaks in the country's history
2."
5209,That second point is based off of bad statistics due to the fact that Delta's prevalence in SA was very low compared to the rest of the world.
5210,3.
5211,Thats mostly due to vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.
5212,Tested negative for normal COVID or tested negative for omicron?
5213,[removed]
5214,This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard
5215,It was 2 flights.
5216,"It can delay another wave, but yeah just delay."
5217,No.
5218,"It were two different flights too, total of 600 passengers on two planes."
5219,You fail to see the relevance of the correct vaccination figures in reply to a comment with incorrect vaccination figures?
5220,I’m confused though.
5221,When the vaccines were introduced we discussed in the subtext it how COVID could t out-mutate thé mRNA vaccines.
5222,What’s changed ?
5223,I like your thinking.

5230,"Having said that, except when I have to wear it for work I don't go anywhere that requires it."
5231,"I won't fly, don't care about restaurants, concerts, shopping (except for food and go to a county that doesn't require them)  Some people have a stronger reaction to face coverings than others."
5232,I am not okay with the burka that takes away my voice and connection with others.
5233,"Yes, it seems to be."
5234,"Well, the thing is that the headline calls them ""experts"", and then talks about them predicting unvaccinated people's behaviors."
5235,It's kind of implied that the thing in which they have expertise is the other part of the headline.
5236,And yet...
5237,But drug companies cannot lie about efficacy.
5238,There are panels of scientists who are part of the approval process who would call bullshit.
5239,They then would have trouble getting any of their medicines approved and lose untold billions and watch their stock tank.
5240,The conspiracy theory here makes no sense.

5246,"If there was a scientific foundation the entire world would not be panicking to get it at this point, and South Africa would be open to travel."
5247,"Drug companies also cannot simply “make things up” - they are limited by strict procedures and scientific methods that get peer reviewed, and go through testing by nearly every government health agency on the planet."
5248,If they lie about something - it’ll get called out pretty quickly by a wall of scientific checks and balances.
5249,"Around these parts, all appointments are gone through the end of the year."
5250,Boosters becoming available plus tighter restrictions for the unvaccinated have caused quite a lot of interest.
5251,"Because we don't know if those mutations will cause vaccine efficacy to drop slightly, drop dramatically, or not chance at all."
5252,Our T-cells recognize over 70 regions of said protein.
5253,It is HIGHLY unlikely it completely evades vaccines

5270,Honestly its probably too early to tell.
5271,"It’s possible, but the Hong Kong cases showed high viral load."
5272,And highly transmissible between people could also well mean highly transmissible between cells in one person.

5287,Yup .
5288,We are all getting screwed
5289,You mean the ‘Xi Variant’ 🤔
5290,There is not enough data to make definitive conclusions that would answer any questions about being better/worse/whatever.
5291,"There are reasons to be concerned:

1."
5292,"There are a wide number of mutations, some of which have been seen before, that are known or suspected to increase transmissibility or to get around prior immunity."
5293,2.
5294,"In the region that we know it’s seen in abundance, there has been a rapid rise in cases."
5295,This indicates that the concerns hypothesized in the above point *might* be backed by real world data.
5296,3.
5297,"Early evidence suggests asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread might be common

Those three things are enough to trigger a response by the public health leaders."
5298,It’s certainly prudent to take the matter seriously and to respond as if we’re sure that this variant is as bad as we think it could be.
5299,"That doesn’t mean we’re 100% about anything with this variant, but there’s reason enough to take steps to slow the spread and to give ourselves more time to learn more and mitigate the problem."
5300,"At the same time, there are reasons to pause and be cautiously optimistic, or at least to consider possibilities other than a worst-case:

1."
5301,"Anecdotes about individual cases indicate that vaccinated individuals may not be having severe symptoms, if they have symptoms at all."
5302,This *might* lend credence to the idea that the vaccines are still reasonably effective against this variant.
5303,2.
5304,"The variant is spreading rapidly in the one place we know it exists at a large scale (a part of South Africa), but South Africa is different from many parts of the world."
5305,"It has low rates of vaccination (&lt;30% overall), has a population that skews younger, and didn’t see a massive wave of the Delta variant."
5306,It’s not yet clear if the new variant will remain competitive in parts of the world where a higher rate of people are vaccinated and/or delta is the dominant strain.
5307,3.
5308,There’s no evidence that this strain is any worse in terms of illness or death.
5309,"That could presumably change as we learn more, but so far it’s not looking like it will make people more sick than prior strains did."
5310,"On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be concerned and to make plans and behave in a way that keeps you and your community safe, but it’s too early to hit any sort of panic button."
5311,"We’re better prepared to tackle this variant than any preceding variant, no matter how “bad” it may be."
5312,"Two or three days ago, they talked about 10 cases in SA."
5313,Yesterday it was 77 confirmed cases.
5314,"Today, there are about a dozen countries reporting cases of Omicron imported from SA by travelers."
5315,"If so many travelers to SA can pick up the virus at random, it suggests that Omicron is already very widespread in SA."
5316,"For anyone wondering why the sudden change, Israel discovered some Omicron cases today but the bigger concern is that 2 of the positives were of people who had no recent travel history."
5317,This means Omicron is already in the community spreading.

5463,And how does cellular immunity.
5464,Can it bind like it does with any other voc ?
5465,We don't know right now.
5466,Research is happening but until we have good studies no one can tell.
5467,I guess that cellular immunity should do fine and that vaccines still generate efficacy around 80-90% in all age groups against severe cases and hospitalizations.
5468,But as I said it is just a guess based on experience with the other vocs.

5499,I agree on the punish part.
5500,There is very little incentive for countries to research and share findings about variants.
5501,"As an example, Hungary (where I am from) does next to nothing in this aspect and relies on its neighbors."
5502,In political terms the government always has other countries to blame for new variants and use it to fuel their anti-migration agenda.

5614,"She did not claim quarantining the flight was an overreaction, and in fact said that a strict response like this was justifiable to buy time to figure out what risk she and her flight cohort posed regardless of how difficult it was for them personally."
5615,"That doesn't change that it *was* difficult, and needlessly so."
5616,"What she objected to, rightly, was that 600 people were kept crammed together in poorly ventilated conditions for twelve hours after landing with no plans, no news, not even food and water."
5617,Fucking water!
5618,"And even as it became clear that people in the flight pool were testing positive there was no effort to spread them out or separate them or anything, no enforcement of masking, nothing."
5619,"No representatives from either KLM or the Dutch government were sent to clarify anything for them either, and they first started learning that lots of people on the flights were testing positive through news reports rather than because anyone had bothered to tell the people themselves yet."
5620,It was handled extremely poorly.
5621,"She also did not claim that the people on the flight were being ""persecuted for being South African,"" that's just straight bullshit."
5622,"The flight populations were largely EU citizens to begin with, so that doesn't make much sense."
5623,"What she said is that this kind of rapid, poorly planned response was in effect punishing South Africa for its aggressive practices on sequencing and openness."
5624,"Enough time has passed that there is (regrettably) every reason to think this variant is no longer only or even primarily a South African problem, but that country and those adjacent to it are now bearing the brunt of a sloppy response that is not likely to stem the tide."
5625,"It's akin to how the ""Spanish"" Flu was deemed so not because that flu had Spanish origins, which it seems not to have, but because only in Spain was it initially being openly discussed and reported on."
5626,"I do agree that saying anything about the relative fairness or unfairness of it at all was a bit of an unnecessary and distracting observation under the circumstances, as the problem we've always faced with this pandemic is that we can only ever over- or underreact to it anyway."
5627,"At no point has it ever been possible to do only and exactly the amount necessary to respond to it, because we have never known why that is."
5628,"So, while it probably is unfair to South Africa for its barn doors to be slammed shut like this by the global community after the horses have unquestionably already fled, every feasible alternative would be even more negligent and they (much like the people on those flights) just have to roll with it for now."
5629,Lord how many lockdowns do you want?

5666,!
5667,And even more apocalyptic… I’ve read that omicron is up to 5x more contagious than the delta variant.
5668,"If it’s more deadly than delta, and then still takes up to 2 weeks for someone to start showing symptoms.. we’re basically fucked."
5669,Usually contagious deadly viruses phase out as they kill the hosts too quick for the virus to spread very far.
5670,But with the delayed symptoms you may not know you’re even sick before you’ve already spread it for 2 weeks.

5689,There is no way that it could drive a surge and not be identified at even pretty low levels of variant monitoring.
5690,"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/florence-wilmington-north-carolina-social-divide

This article was a big eye opener about some of the stuff they publish."
5691,I live in this town.
5692,"The thesis of this article is just not true, and is just a lazy attempt to further push a popular narrative."
5693,Notice how there's no quotes from stakeholders on both sides of this argument (like the power company)?
5694,"I'm not saying racism doesn't exist in my community, but to say storm recovery is racially based is just wrong."
5695,"(It's an infrastructure issue, you dolts)"
5696,Well flights are still allowed.
5697,"And I doubt that they will restricts them since the variant is already here anyway, thay will probably restrict flight from south africa even tho it's too late."
5698,I honestly don't know how dangerous the situation will get or if it's safe to come here unfortunately.
5699,"Stay safe, it's all I could say right now."
5700,Great... I’m visiting NYC in a few days.
5701,"Late stage capitalism rules, doesn’t it?"
5702,"Plus, South Africa is only about 40 percent vaccinated so really they still need to worry about it a little."
5703,This is exactly why I opted out of my kid’s school’s weekly testing.
5704,The CDC doesn’t recommend it for vaccinated individuals and this.
5705,What are you on about?
5706,What do you think is achieved by these articles?
5707,"People who are already vaccinated, like us, get nothing from them."
5708,"People who are nutters, get validation."
5709,These articles do not tend to say things like 'miniscule percentage of the population in a highly vaccinated country attends relatively small protests'.
5710,"They say 'thousands gather against covid 19 restrictions and vaccine mandates, here's some pictures which make it look relatively large, followed by videos that do too because there's no scale'."
5711,"People who are normal pay no attention to it, people who are anti-vaxxers see it as validation and normalisation."
5712,"I'm sorry that you're so weirdly obsessed with tit for tat regarding ""omfg my country isn't the only dumb one"" (I mean if you're from the US, its clearly dumber than Australia considering your vaccination rates but anyway) you think this kind of headline...achieves something, but it doesn't."
5713,"It encourages silly people to think they are not alone in their silliness, and that protesting in their silliness will get them mass media coverage."
5714,Accurate enough in Netherlands to find 10% infected.
5715,"Well, luckily I, living in New York, got my booster yesterday."
5716,Which is the reason I'm lying in bed feeling like hot garbage.
5717,2019 was a very serious flu year.
5718,There's been plenty of people sure that they had covid in that timeframe and then tested negative for antibodies.
5719,I think the main reason this has taken hold of inteterest beyond other variants is the amount of mutation coupled with the rate of increase in such a short amount of time.
5720,The sequencing had Omicron beating out Delta in South Africa at a staggering pace far beyond anything seen in previous variants.
5721,"Of course there's also evidence that it may have been around for a lot longer than its discovery, and there's a lot of unknowns about it - namely South Africa has very low vaccination rates, and has been at very low levels there for a while so there was more room for a new variant to become dominant there than most countries."
5722,[98% to 99% of Americans dying are unvaccinated](https://medicalpartnership.usg.edu/covid-19-staggering-statistic-98-to-99-of-americans-dying-are-unvaccinated/).

5730,But in a good way.
5731,"So, Czech Republic now too."
5732,There is no way the variant is not already anywhere.
5733,And it is probably starting to multiply like crazy.
5734,Let's hope the vaccines actually still work against it like they are starting to say today.
5735,"The omicron strain doesn't trigger the PCR test for the spike protein sequence, just the nucleocapsid sequence."
5736,"In other words, the spike protein has mutated so much thr PCR won't detect it."
5737,I think we’re going to see this movie every 6 months for awhile.
5738,The worst part is that doesn’t even narrow it down a little bit.
5739,idk it is pretty usual to catch a normal cold or flu after a big conference
5740,Let’s not beat about the bush.
5741,It’s everywhere now.
5742,Travel restrictions won’t do shit.
5743,Just got to accept it like we did with delta and hope the vaccination drives hold up.
5744,"Omicron, if it's as contagious as some say it is, still could rip through the unvaccinated population of Europe, particularly the more vulnerable Eastern European nations."

5755,"I have seen 10 articles with titles like this, only to conclude that we basically now nothing and only theoretically the variant could have dangerous properties."
5756,"Ok, we got it, theoretically it could be pretty bad, now we move on, we wait for 2-3 weeks to see what is really going on."

5763,"If they had come into contact with someone who had it and contracted it themselves, it still takes at least 1-2 days to show up in your system with enough virulent for a test to pick up that you have it."
5764,So could’ve contracted it the day before or of their test to fly and it wouldn’t show up on their test.
5765,But it would show up by the time they landed.
5766,Computer science actually.
5767,"I have a job that pays well enough I could travel in my free time, and yet that isn't really an option."
5768,Still a huge number of people testing positive.
5769,Even of no one was tested you wouldn't expect 10% of people on a flight to test positive from almost anywhere on the planet right now.
5770,"Oh, you didn't buy toilet paper yet?"
5771,"Exactly, it only really works if you take the New Zealand approach, cutting yourself off from the rest of the world entirely and being an island nation which has easily controllable borders."

5777,I suggest you consult studies about masks efficacy and the maths behind mask effect on covid prevention.

5779,"That was normal till about 100 years ago, maybe less."

5781,Wearing masks for health reasons was fairly normal in Japan and the rest of Asia long before covid.
5782,I'm guessing we don't know how many people weren't able to board due to positive tests though.
5783,There could have been 100 tests that came back positive and those people weren't able to board the flight.

5801,What about the 528 before that?

5803,The reasons was because the people who were infected with those 528 strains did not develop serious infections.

5815,This is my question as well.
5816,Why are we so freaked out about it?
5817,"""Past performance is not indicative of future results""

If you think a repeat of March 2020 is on the table you'll be in for a rude surprise."
5818,Healthcare is not being denied to the unvaccinated.
5819,"However, when hospital beds are full and ventilators are taken, hospitals make decisions to ration care and provide resources and the highest levels of care to those that have the best chances of survival."
5820,Vaccinated people with less severe cases of covid will naturally have better chances of survival than unvaccinated patients with severe cases of covid.
5821,So the unvaccinated are simply cancelling themselves out and reducing their chances of having the best outcomes.
5822,They are extremely biased to the left.
5823,They are not good.
5824,good luck keeping it contained now
5825,fear mongering
5826,I think it's relative though.
5827,We haven't suddenly had a change in costs here.
5828,"So I suspect our curve is accurate, even if the case numbers are underreported."
5829,"Our curve increase, although recent, is growing at the sharpest incline we've seen."
5830,Much steeper than delta.
5831,No real change in deaths yet though: so we still waiting to see the real impact of case growth.
5832,Well that’s just prime.
5833,"&gt;less fully vaccinated people in SA, around 24%."
5834,That's pretty appalling.
5835,The evolution of variants like this is exactly why many experts have argued that vaccines should be prioritised to countries with low vaxx rates rather than for boosters.
5836,Sadly.
5837,This is a unique situation and it should be dealt with uniquely.
5838,"It’s so easy to prevent death/severe outcome for most people, just get the god damn shot."
5839,"It's not meant to be strict, it's meant to be a risk mitigating measure like it has been when it has been implemented before"
5840,Am pharmacist.
5841,"From my understanding, vaccine induced myocarditis tends to be transient, and occurs less frequently than myocarditis caused by covid (up to 16x more from covid)

With regards to vaccines, risk assessment is as follows: no myocarditis is better than some myocarditis (ie Pfizer is preferred over Moderna), which is better than even more myocarditis (from covid)."
5842,"Basically if you are young, male, received your 2nd dose, you are more likely to develop vaccine induced myocarditis (likely transient) and *much much more likely* to develop myocarditis from covid (which carries higher risk of long term effects)"
5843,"Well in the US (and probably Europe), HIV isn’t as big of a deal anymore bc the drugs are so good at keeping the virus at bay."
5844,"As long as HIV patients take their meds daily, their immune systems don’t get totally fucked, and they can live a long full life into their 80s (as long as they continue taking the HIV meds)."
5845,"Of course in places like Africa, they may not have access to the new good HIV meds, so I’m not even sure if quarantining them just for having HIV would be possible."
5846,They need the medications.
5847,the netherlands cant even get ventilation in schools right.

5849,Yeah all in the clear (phew).

5856,Wear two.
5857,"But it isn’t normal, comfortable behavior for a lot of people and I don’t think being dismissive of that is at all helpful."
5858,In fact that very type of dismissiveness probably has the opposite effect.
5859,"The last two years have felt like a game of Plague Inc, building up spread until its hopelessly everywhere and then cranking up lethality to the max all at once."
5860,I dont think it’ll be Omicron where the lethality goes to the moon but it’s probably coming at some point.

5868,"We'll know more about severity and vaccine efficacy soon."""
5869,"The constant headlines of ""One new case in Bulgaria!"""

5952,I got a dollar on Nebraska.

5954,That’s why the border controls are so ineffective.
5955,If you discover a new variant within two months of it spreading locally it’s a minor miracle.

6018,Man there really is an xkcd for everything.
6019,Yep.
6020,It's been detected or suspected in multiple countries in Europe too so it's already in the US.
6021,By the time a new variant is detected it would be shocking if it's not already spread to multiple countries.
6022,It's a probability game and I don't think any country is sequencing positive cases at a high enough rate for very early detection.
6023,No it doesn’t.
6024,How does the SA health minister saying that the cases so far have been mild mean that it’s milder than Delta?
6025,That is an entirely different statement.
6026,"You also ignored that the same person you’ve quoted about the mild cases went on to say this right after: 

&gt;	“We know there are a lot of mutations but no-one can tell us at this stage if it means something, or if it is just going to fade away."
6027,**We just don’t know.
6028,"**”

That doesn’t fit your narrative though, does it?"
6029,This is the end.
6030,When the first run on TP happened back in March of 2020 I was finally able to find some online from a restaurant supply company.
6031,"Problem was, their policy assumed bulk purchasing."
6032,So I wound up with a few hundred rolls.
6033,I haven't had to buy TP in like 20 months.
6034,Ironically the hoarders forced me to hoard.
6035,Maybe contact tracers will be able to figure that out.
6036,"But remember that this Italian case was in Mozambique not South Africa or Botswana, so without further information this variant probably needed time to get between the countries."
6037,It's all pretty bad.
6038,If these governments didn’t institute a travel ban and this ended up spreading like wildfire there would be huge criticism.
6039,It’s best to act quickly until there is more information.
6040,And that is why this is incredibly scary.
6041,"Shutting down everything until we know more, just in case, would be the wise course of action."
6042,"They should have a neo con edition, where the virus mutates randomly, but you can manipulate the masses to encourage spread to meet short term political goals and satisfy special interest rewards."
6043,"My reaction was the opposite: the first two had me unhappy for 3-4 days afterward, the booster was a breeze and only had about a day of grumpiness."
6044,It’s fascinating how different peoples’ reactions are.
6045,[removed]
6046,I’m not sure what they actually accomplish sometimes.
6047,It’s not as great of tool as people here think it is.
6048,We are running toward endemic status of this virus and masks may delay infections but everyone will meet it.
6049,Same with lockdowns.
6050,We need to understand what our end goals are here.
6051,Vaccinated people have already contracted the variant.
6052,A vaccine does not necessarily need to prevent infection to be effective as we have learned from Delta.
6053,South Africa *does* currently have the best view in the world regarding Omicron and hospitalizations.
6054,A mutation reducing vaccine effectiveness from 70-90% down to zero seems unlikely.
6055,"Even though South Africa may have an incentive to play down severity, we should acknowledge their transparency so far, and we should respect this medical professional's opinion as it is likely based on data as well as their medical expertise."
6056,Another great opportunity for the UK government to fail harder than any other EU nation.
6057,So say we all
6058,This might sound crazy but maybe people shouldn’t be flying around in the middle of a pandemic
6059,Detected is not bad.
6060,It's community spread you need to worry
6061,"Damn, I kinda don’t care"
6062,They should establish its R0 to claim that.
6063,"A variant could as well be less transmissible than Delta, but faster in the current circumstances (pre existing immunity against Delta better than it is against Omicron, and thus there is an unbalance)

So Omicron R(t) could be higher than Delta's even if R0 is not."
6064,"This is not to say that its R0 isn't greater, just to say that both things have to be established"
6065,"Not really, delta is the endemic strain."
6066,If Omicron is evasive it will become the endemic strain.
6067,Nobodies catching alpha or beta nowadays.
6068,"Sigh, I’d guess California, because we too have a ton of international travel."
6069,): Bet it’s already here in San Diego.
6070,What if I’m not in England for more than 42 hours?
6071,I'm not implying anything.
6072,I'm stating that Florida backdates their numbers which has been proven.
6073,"If you read the above, yes I absolutely am isolating."
6074,"My question is about the *longer-term* future, and is premised on a few assumptions:

(1) COVID is here to stay, and is going to become endemic."
6075,"""COVID Zero"" is unfortunately not an option anymore."
6076,"(2) Most people will eventually get COVID about once or twice a year, much like how we currently get other respiratory infections, and even other coronaviruses (some of which cause the common cold)."
6077,"Given these two assumptions, it seems like our two choices are:

(1) Continue our current policies forever, with the average person expected to isolate in quarantine for 10 days at a time, once or twice a year, forever."
6078,"Or:

(2) Eventually recognize that, for nearly everyone with immunity (most from vaccination, including periodic boosters; the rest from inevitable exposure), COVID will manifest with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and for the rest, treatments will gradually get better (including the new Pfizer pill)."
6079,"In such an environment, perhaps masking alone could be sufficient for minimizing spread."
6080,"absolutely, I tell him all the time the door is never shut."
6081,My brother's son was a similar age after being a terrific student reached 16 and didn't want to go to school any more.
6082,He quit.
6083,He did a commerical cookery course.
6084,He finished it and then realised he didn't want to do it for the rest of his life.
6085,"He went back to school, did a bachelors and then an MBA and then he went into management in IT."
6086,He is a twin.
6087,His sister is steaming ahead and looks like she is going to get into Med school.
6088,My third child is 15 and wanted to be a hedge fund manager.
6089,She also lost it a bit but at least she didn't sit in her room.
6090,She has started commercial cookery and wants to go to Paris to do Cordon Bleu.
6091,Lets hope in 2 years that this thing is over.
6092,FL has had 2 peaks of covid in mid summer where you'd rather be in hell then outside.
6093,So I doubt it
6094,Apparently she is also a structural engineer with inside knowledge about an airports ventilation system.
6095,I think Delta airlines is not suffering due to the variant.
6096,I'm sure the Omicron businesses will also be ok.
6097,I will take a pass on ordering Rocky Road covid
6098,See…this just seems like a problem.
6099,"If you allow US citizens back into the US, one of them is undoubtedly going to bring back this variant."
6100,Especially if it has a longer than average incubation time (that’s the impression I got from reading about the first couple of cases) and if they aren’t quarantined.
6101,"I’m not suggesting citizens should be stuck elsewhere and unable to get home, just…it seems like if we (in America) are serious about keeping this variant out, we need to figure out a way to make sure that our own citizens aren’t infected and spreading it once they’re home."
6102,And maybe there’s a plan for that?
6103,"Like a robust plan, not just testing people once they’re back in the US and calling it good if their one test after they land is negative."
6104,"I also think it’s already here, because it seems like it’s already everywhere else."
6105,So this may all be moot unless we figure out and stick to a plan for contact tracing and isolating.
6106,And so far THAT hasn’t gone well.
6107,"Covid positive samples are tested when a case is positive, and checked for which variant."
6108,"Two week estimate, probably slightly less."
6109,"&gt;Are you essentially saying that yes, we are going to continue the same isolation procedures for positive tests forever, as COVID becomes endemic?"
6110,Yes?
6111,"Same thing if you were to get the flu or strep, you shouldn't be going to work or be around people if you're actively sick, I'm confused."
6112,They’ve been low for a few weeks now.
6113,Not sure what you are trying to imply.
6114,Straight from CDC’s website
6115,&gt;The mask thing is nothing really and isn't an inconvenience at all.
6116,No idea why people get all worked up about it.
6117,"Because for some of us, it IS something, and IS extremely ""inconvenient"" (to say the least)."
6118,Your experience and your point of view is not the only one.
6119,"While this new variant may indeed justify the use of masks again (and where I am they never went away), that is a very different issue from whether or not they are a big deal."
6120,"For many of us, they absolutely are."
6121,Is Omicron that much worse than Delta or is everyone exaggerating?
6122,"This country has been hurt too much economically the past two years for Americans to do all that, especially with all 50 states having more independent control than the federal government."
6123,"Yep, our country doesn't have a polarization problem anymore...we're long passed that."
6124,We have a radicalization problem.
6125,SA has one of the best infectious disease infrastructure in the world and leading experts because of the AIDS and TB epidemics we have had to deal with.
6126,The fact we detected and sequenced it has more to do with this than it originating here.
6127,We are being treated like pariahs to the rest of the world because we were honest and quick to let everyone else know about this variant when this didn't happen with other variants that are undoubtably out in the wild in other countries and they just refused to acknowledge it.
6128,This is the second time we have been treated this way and quite honestly if we do detect another variant I could bet top dollar there wouldnt be a peep coming out about it.
6129,"&gt;The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged."
6130,"DOI: 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The virulence-transmission trade-off hypothesis proposed more than 30 years ago is the cornerstone in the study of host-parasite co-evolution."
6131,This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to replicate.
6132,This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host replication increases host mortality.
6133,"Empirical tests of predictions of the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its overall generalizability."
6134,DOI: 10.1111/evo.13692
6135,what do you think those cells are trained on...
6136,"We suspect that, but we don’t know that."
6137,"At this point, we don’t even know for sure that it originated in SA."
6138,You can get it if you're 18 years and older.
6139,Are you younger?
6140,"From Mass, and I can’t say I disagree with this"
6141,Man why does Omicron have to be such a cool fucking name
6142,What’s with downvotes?
6143,You can’t be serious.
6144,You are suggesting that we shouldn’t have to isolate if we test positive for a virus that kills people because you selfishly can’t handle 10 days in quarantine.
6145,What an absolutely ridiculous statement.
6146,Seems like this sort of data is why the WHO indicated vaccines were 40% effective at preventing transmission last week.
6147,"That came as a great surprise to me, as I'd been citing household contact tracing studies where vaccination was 66-78% effective at preventing transmission."
6148,"Enough studies like this, and we may conclude vaccination against Covid doesn't offer sterilizing immunity, and it doesn't provide mucosal immunity."
6149,My hypothesis is that either vaccination or prior infection don't generate many antibodies in nasopharyngeal mucus.
6150,"Covid infection is a disease of two phases: nasopharyngeal infection, mostly asymptomatic, when the infectivity is greatest; and in some (especially the elderly and those with metabolic disease), lung and gastrointestinal involvement and severe disease."
6151,"Vaccination or prior infection offer pretty good protection against the later, severe disease phase, but only limited protection against that first upper respiratory tract phase."
6152,Those of us who care may be wearing good quality respirators for a long time.
6153,"Sorry to my Christmas recipients, you're getting KN95s in your stockings this year, too."
6154,"We must be wary of making comparisons between COVID and Influenza, or Ebola, or whatever."
6155,They are different viruses.
6156,They act in differing fashions.
6157,COVID is actually quite novel in its nature as almost being a vascular disease - so trying to draw assumptions from unrelated viruses isn’t really going to be accurate.

6162,Actually there is some reason to think this might be the case.

6167,Schools no longer have to quarantine asymptomatic students in FL.
6168,"If Omicron is actually a threat, things will change quickly in FL."
6169,"This is an important conversation to start, but this work looks really shoddy."
6170,"""Cases in the last 7 days"" around an arbitrary date is a very flawed metric because of how seasonality progresses and how certain areas are hotspots."
6171,There are also obviously confounding factors (population density especially) which could be controlled at the county level (i.e.
6172,this needs a multivariate analysis).
6173,"Despite these, figure 2 seems to make *exactly the opposite case that the authors are claiming*."
6174,"At and above 30% vaccination, the mean cases unmistakably seem to be trending downward as vaccination rate increases."
6175,How on earth did this get published?
6176,Aha.
6177,That is bad.
6178,Needs more cowbell.
6179,Yikes
6180,Except for covid came from a lab.

6193,"It's the new ""razor blade in the candy bar""."
6194,Only Government entities can save you!
6195,Or accept the fact that this thing has evolved from pandemic to endemic and should be dealt with accordingly.
6196,Check it again in 2 to 3 weeks when they back date the numbers
6197,Two points.
6198,"First, many got vaccinated because of the delta variant."
6199,Not surprising to think the same could happen with this variant.
6200,"Second, it still remains unclear what ""new strategy"" you think should be adopted that differs from continuing to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated."
6201,I imagine a lot of younger people just don't see Delta as a big treat to their personal health and don't think its worth going out of their way to get a shot.
6202,They are vaccine-apathetic rather than anti-vaccine.
6203,Fear about a potentially new dangerous strange (unknowns can be scarier than known dangers) could give people the extra little push to get vaccinated.
6204,"Also, people who've been ""anti-vax"" in social circles and later started to realize they were wrong but didn't want to admit it have an Nu excuse to get vaccinated without admitting they were wrong..."
6205,Oh.
6206,Right.
6207,Not sure why I didn’t think about the mandate.
6208,Well for about one hour there I had a blissful moment of believing there was evidence of a mass change of heart.
6209,This is rather disappointing.
6210,The November 2024 variant is going to be a real doozie I hear
6211,Just read an article on WaPo and had comment from one in there.
6212,Said that there’s no idea on efficiency front from preventing in infections but it _should_ still protect against severe cases and emphasized getting vaccinated.
6213,That's the suspected origin for all the variants.
6214,(Not the same guy though!)
6215,I also agree with the lot of “I” statements.
6216,"Personally, I would have resonated with his talk more if he focused on the good that AMERICA has done and urging its constituents to match, that this is a battle that really isn’t politically charged but rather, for the betterment of the world."

6231,Is this the same as the south African variant as 6 months ago?
6232,"In Japan they only had to reach a 70% vaccination rate to nearly wipe it out, and eventually (because it that's a long time to eradicate any disease via vaccination) if we have 100% vaccination, it will likely be eliminated just like smallpox

there was some thinking that they acted so aggressively to eradicate it that the virus, in an attempt to survive, mutated itself out of existence."
6233,"[But more recently, it looks like it was the aggressive combination of measures that really served to severely curb the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59342308)

this would make sense

disasters are never just one thing going wrong - it's always almost a combination of issues converging that creates a disaster

so why not a multi-faceted combination of efforts being the key to success?"
6234,the defining ingredients for Japan seems to be widespread adherence to a combination of protocols.

6240,I was told that either you do them at the same time (I did) or do them at least 1 month apart
6241,Precautionary methods are not “knee jerk”.
6242,We don’t know anything about this variant yet.
6243,It’s better to play it safe and it’s ridiculous that people think we shouldn’t.
6244,It's absurd at this point we basicly have a lockdown cause we now have to be vaccined and still need a pcr test that cost around 20-70 euros just to go eat somewhere or cinema etc.
6245,You are welcome.
6246,So race matters?

6248,Correct.

6253,"the virus takes what, like a week before people start manifesting symptoms?"
6254,Whomever they sequenced Omicron from definitely was not the first person to have it.
6255,"Even that person themselves could've been spreading it around for a week prior to its discovery, and anyone they infected, ditto."
6256,Everyone's just a degree of separation or two away from some sort of air travel to somewhere.

6261,It severely hinders the ability to do targeted lockdowns in the (effective) way that they have.

6263,"Firstly, nobody said how long initial immunity would last— just that data was good."

6285,The flu vaccines do get tested.

6287,Testing takes a couple of months.
6288,Clinical trials normally take years.
6289,"“What’s more, their median post-booster antibody level was three times higher than was typical for another group of people whose antibodies were measured a few weeks after getting their second dose of vaccine, when they’re close to their peak."
6290,"And it was 53 times higher than that of a group of 76 unvaccinated people who had recovered from COVID-19 just two to six weeks earlier.”

Plus this isn’t an association study either, so some people will get real triggered over these findings."
6291,That’s not what I said.
6292,"I said what they’ve been doing not only doesn’t work, but also it pushes anti-vaxxers farther away."
6293,This article is a scientist predicting that millions will get vaccinated due to this variant.
6294,No one who has paid attention to the pro-COVID antivaxxers would agree that is true.

6451,Because they announced they would rapidly produce an omnicron specific booster in 60-90 days.
6452,It basically comes down to how well the virus attaches to your healthy respiratory cells.
6453,It’s random genetics..... sadly for your wife the match between the virus receptors and her healthy respiratory cells was really good and the virus was more easily able to infect more cells and then multiple and continue to cycle.
6454,"In your case, the match was not great so your immune system was able to kill the infected cells, make its own antibodies and prevent further infection spread."
6455,that's reddit for you.
6456,it's usually downvote then ban.
6457,This is the first time I've seen this point heavily upvoted.
6458,I'm glad people are starting to understand.
6459,"Why did moderna, in a day where the entire stock market plummeted, go up 20.57% on the day this news broke?"
6460,Seems pretty straightforward.
6461,&gt;BRUSSELS — The European Commission recommended Thursday that member countries apply more travel restrictions to people who are unvaccinated in the 27-nation bloc’s latest attempt to curb the recent surge of cases across the continent.
6462,&gt;The commission’s health authorizing agency also approved vaccines for children as young as 5 — a milestone that could help Europe improve vaccination rates at a time when cases and deaths from the virus are up.
6463,The commission travel recommendations did not apply to unvaccinated children under the age of 6.
6464,&gt;The ability to easily travel between countries in the European Union is a core value of the bloc and the commission’s latest recommendations attempt to strike the balance between upholding that freedom and implementing restrictions that could slow the spread of the virus.
6465,"&gt;Specter of new restrictions rises in Europe with coronavirus cases spiking once again
People who have a European Union covid certificate — which means they are fully vaccinated, have proof that they recovered from the virus or recently tested negative — should not have any travel restrictions, according to the recommendations."
6466,Everyone else should quarantine or be tested when they travel to a country in the bloc.
6467,"&gt; Still, vaccines are expected to provide some protection against Omicron because they stimulate not only antibodies but immune cells that can attack infected cells, Dr. Hatziioannou said."
6468,Mutations to the spike protein do not blunt that immune-cell response.
6469,This part of the article on the HIV link is an interesting theory.
6470,Might explain why it’s easy to infect a vaccinated patient but only with mild symptoms.
6471,"It can get in but when the immune cells ramp up, it’s gets hit hard."

6481,Without your booster you're still vulnerable to Delta after 6 months.
6482,Makes more sense to me to get a booster and be protected against Delta AND get whatever protection the booster confers against Omnicron.

6484,Lol not one reply or point of view on the matter just downvote !
6485,"PFE gang, was a nice bump today :)"
6486,"&gt; We don’t have the kind of surveillance that enables us to find variants before they emerge in the population

We do though."

6502,"If delta isn't able to spread, but omicron is, that is the definition of out competing."
6503,The virus that is better able to spread is more likely to pass on its genetic material.
6504,"OMG I have been posting for a while that they should name variants after fake planets, and that my first choice is Omicron Persei 8 from Futurama."
6505,And they did it!
6506,That’s the thing being vaccinated doesn’t prevent getting it.
6507,It just helps not getting super sick

6517,"The SARS scare in Asia really changed Japan, Korea, Singapore and parts of urban China."
6518,"After SARS masks became far more common for people when sick, and not uncommon for people with allergies."

6522,2 weeks.
6523,We won't know until we contact trace and track those which progress to hospitalised cases.

6525,Yes glorious leader is glorious.
6526,"I always agree that one should try to temper concern and not panic, but the truth is, we don’t yet know how this mutation will fare for those who are vaccinated."
6527,Really just depends on how similar or not the strain is compared to the strains we’ve currently been seeing.
6528,"Hopefully it doesn’t pose an issue but at this point, not sure."
6529,Should be yes for both.
6530,Only upside.
6531,"There were clear benefits to corporations and the government in finding fake WMDs, there's little benefit in this"
6532,A naturally spreading virus made by us to be less lethal would likely mutate and be out of our control very quickly.
6533,"Vaccines are ALMOST naturally spreading, in that you can acquire one very easily."
6534,I was talking about the vaccines and the urging other countries to step up.
6535,That’s leadership and the pandemic never would’ve reached the levels it’s at now if we had that sort of leadership in 2020.
6536,"Mask up on transport and in shops, but not in pubs🤣"
6537,"&gt;Wu: Several countries instituted travel bans this week, many of them primarily focused on African countries, where surveillance systems detected Omicron not long ago."
6538,How big of an impact might that make?
6539,"&gt;Titanji: Historically, there is a lot of evidence that by the time a travel ban is instituted, the virus has already gone … and potentially well beyond the borders of the countries that [the ban is] restricting travel from."
6540,Instituting travel bans as a knee-jerk reaction can send the wrong message to countries that are contributing to the global effort of virus surveillance.
6541,We could end up disincentivizing countries from reporting because they fear retaliation.
6542,There are other measures that could be taken to ensure that travel is safe.
6543,"For example, to get an international flight, you have to be fully vaccinated as a requirement for most countries, or show proof of negative tests."
6544,You’re right - at the time it was crowded public transport and the guidance/rail operator “expectation” was to wear one in those circumstance.
6545,"Regardless, not leading by example."
6546,We are a maskless wasteland.
6547,"When you think terrible you think Florida, it's actually Michigan and the only thing holding it together is a competent Governor."
6548,"Because your post said: 

&gt;I haven’t traveled at all during the pandemic."
6549,Honestly going to airports and doing non essential travel has been risky and selfish in my opinion.
6550,We've had vaccines for close to 6 months and this variant just popped up last week.
6551,Okay Xi
6552,This is such a bad take
6553,They also were extremely open with the information about the strain.
6554,I think they are trying to be honest
6555,"It'd seem that an immune response that""recognizes"" the whole virus as an intruder would putt perform an immune response which only recognizes spike fragments."
6556,"People want all the benefits and freedoms here but have no accountability, responsibility or care for society...it's a shocking revelation for me too, and the worse offenders are the religious ones who live by their respective religious texts."
6557,"Clearly they are incapable of comprehending it's teachings, it's just a rule book for them that they get to misquote whenever it suits them."
6558,My prediction is that they will announce good news around efficacy of antiviral drugs
6559,Delta is going to be managed by vaccines and saturation into the population.
6560,That is it.
6561,It will circulate forever.
6562,Anything else just delays it.
6563,The virus cannot be eradicated and it’s stupid to think that it can.
6564,[removed]
6565,Air travel restrictions on 29?
6566,That is way too late
6567,They are already working on vaccine boosters for this
6568,[removed]
6569,Maybe because they are pandering to public opinion they believe to be stupid
6570,"And we still got people that demonstrate against the corona vaccines, lockdowns."
6571,But were they all infected with Omicron or Delta?
6572,Have they released that info?
6573,Micron is a ~~chip~~ memory company.
6574,"If anything, those antivax are going “my God, Bill Gates doesn’t even try to hide his micro chip ‘covid’ shots any more”."
6575,Oil prices dropped 30 percent.
6576,The media hyping up this variant is going to cure the inflation problem..
6577,State of emergency…but no mask mandate?
6578,*cries in bartender*
6579,In Ontario the masking rules havent changed at all since they went into place so there will be very little change based on the new variant.
6580,Restaurant capacity may be restricted again but for most things it will be the same.
6581,This will help because loosening and then tightening restrictions takes a mental toll on a population.
6582,I think there is a worry that lockdowns may come but I think there is some hope that vaccines plus masking and distancing will continue to prove effective.

6733,You will need another booster by the time they develop and produce one for this variant.

6735,That date is incorrect; that's a page that was updated today but the old date was left on it.
6736,"B.1.1.529 was first sampled on November 11, the first sample sequencing was finished on Monday or Tuesday, and B.1.1.529 number was assigned on Tuesday."
6737,2-3% is not a monumental sell off...
6738,The ultimate issue here is we are using in vitro labs to make huge in vivo assumptions.

6741,We don't even have the ability to know why some people are innately completely impervious to Covid regardless of age and others end up septic and dead.

6745,🤷
6746,How on earth did 85 people make it onto a plane with covid?
6747,Were they not tested before departure?!
6748,With that many people contagious there's a high chance most of the people on the plane got infected during the flight (especially when they had to sit on the ground for hours awaiting tests - no cabin air exchange).

6759,"So, this might be a bit theoretical, but from what I gathered:

This is actually the strength of the vaccine over a natural infection."
6760,"As many would say here, the vaccine wanes faster than a natural infection."
6761,"It seems that a natural infection will make the body more reliant on that antibody even when it stops working (and is apparently the theory on why people die of Covid, their bodies stuck in using an antibody from a previous cold infection)."
6762,The transience of the vaccine may help the body switch gears easier.

6781,But sour &amp; destruction to personal lives of employees is a non-factor to the MBAs running the show.

6785,Cool.
6786,Cool.
6787,"I understand why Xi was skipped, but why Nu?"
6788,"Is it to avoid people getting confused about a ""new variant"" and ""nu vatiant""."
6789,Next the WHO will be telling us to get a Zap of Brannigan
6790,Definitely.
6791,Why can't the current vaccine fully stop a vaccinated person from transmitting the virus to others?
6792,"In regards to the mechanics of the virus, is it possible to ever have a vaccine that does completely stop transmission in a vaccinated person?"
6793,Or does covid just not work that way?
6794,So spot on.
6795,Because people are having that *exact* worry given what they know about it’s mutations :-/
6796,"Even if the vaccine isn't as effective, stopping/slowing the spread of Delta will make contact tracing and data gathering for the new variant easier."
6797,Plus it would be real embarrassing if you died of Delta while waiting for info about the new threat.
6798,"That's true of every new variant detection, unfortunately."
6799,"Agreed, but if he hadn’t done it, every COVID-denying RWNJ would take to social media to blame him personally for creating and distributing the new variant."
6800,Lol I’ve heard the “once kids are safe” line for years.
6801,"First it was 12+, then 5+."
6802,Now it’s newborns (have any newborns died from JUST Covid?)
6803,Ridiculous.
6804,Just going to keep going backwards
6805,It’s not an easy solution.
6806,It’s never gonna happen in the US unfortunately.

6824,Absolutely.

6826,"The only factor that affects a spread is transmissibility, and our actions against it (to a much lesser to extent)."
6827,"Ebola is a horrifying disease, buy that is exactly why it is more likely to be an epidemic, not a pandemic."

6833,Came here to post on the same thing.
6834,I trust Bedford's opinion a great deal.
6835,I didn't feel terribly comforted.
6836,"&gt;Growth rate (in absolute terms and relative to Delta) will be become clearer in the following days, but at the moment, I believe we're looking at a variant that potentially has significant immune evasion and that appears to be spreading rapidly."
6837,15/16
6838,If the Americans dont stop testing quickly we could be heading for disaster!
6839,The biggest problem from my amateur armchair in Canada is that we were told 2 weeks to lockdown.
6840,That became 2 years of different measures (we still have masks and a few other things here in Ontario).
6841,Then we were told vaccines get us to normal.
6842,But we can see that even highly vaccinated places like Portugal still enact measures.
6843,So vaccines didn't get us back to normal.
6844,"So now it ""feels"" like the virus is magical because apparently nothing works."
6845,There's no going back to normal (pre-2019).
6846,And the media makes it all worse with fear porn.
6847,I hear you
6848,For real.
6849,I got my booster last month.
6850,Would I get another 100mg dose?
6851,Or wait X months and then get a 200mg dose?
6852,Or do I wait for them to create and manufacture an Omicron-specific vaccine?
6853,It's all very hard.
6854,It's like every office pops a champagne bottle and that's celebrating every time there's a new variant cause it'll be a cash cow.
6855,Things may have been a bit dry for a while since Delta had outcompeted everything for majority of this year 🤣
6856,"You're not going to force me to wear pants just because of some supposed ""rattlesnake""."
6857,"Even if it is real, it's not like those pants are going to stop the rattlesnake anyway."
6858,It'll bite a hole right through those pants.
6859,"The deep-state scientists know this, but asking us to wear pants isn't about efficacy anyway, it's about control."
6860,"TL:DR: If the rattlesnake wants out of my ass, it's going to get out of my ass, which is why I'm not wearing pants."

6928,"I mentioned this new variant to a friend, she unvaccinated and ridiculous."
6929,She is having 20 people over for Christmas and is not going to change.
6930,I assume this is taken from [their press release](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-strategy-address-omicron-b11529-sars-cov-2) where they talked about going back to 100 micrograms for boosters for older people.
6931,Of course the problem with Moderna is that they're only making 5\*10^9 micrograms of mRNA a month.
6932,"That's enough for 50 million 100 microgram doses, or 500 million 10 microgram doses."
6933,Doing larger doses comes at a direct tradeoff.
6934,I’m currently recovering from my moderna booster and its been a doozy.

6955,"I understand I'm not ""normal"" so I try to accommodate as many people as I can, but I'm also not going to lie about how I see things or how I feel."
6956,Lots of assumptions in your assessment there.
6957,South Africa has been sequencing and upon omnicron's arrival the tests they were doing for Delta vs Omnicron show that Omnicron was outperforming.
6958,"Now, unless you are saying that this is the case because delta is taking longer to sequence."
6959,I doubt it.
6960,"They have a case, they test, if it is omnicron they know right away that it isn't delta."
6961,So how come Omnicron all of a sudden is outperforming so much?

Anyway"

7001,I’m pretty healthy 40 and haven’t been sick in 2 years.

7016,Its one of a few cities that have flights to SA so it makes sense to be prepared.
7017,One can only be so optimistic
7018,Do you understand by now how 2 cases are just a surface representation of the virus spread?
7019,This means in circulating in the UK and we will see more cases very soon.
7020,"The question is do cases translate into serious illness, death or long COVID in the vaccinated."
7021,No question it will rampage through the unvaccinated just like delta is doing.
7022,Just do a little research on Novavax; how it’s made and how it works and you’ll get your answer.
7023,Is it okay if we come up with nicknames for this thing?

7042,We know that Delta transmitted faster than previous variants because it has higher viral load.
7043,What's making Omicron transmitting even faster than Delta?
7044,Is it simply the ability to evade vaccine and natural immunity?
7045,Or does it also have high viral load?
7046,Does it have more asymptomatic spread?
7047,Not necessarily.
7048,It's really dependent on when this strain really started in SA.
7049,With the numbers rising within the past couple days we may have a few cases.
7050,Narrator: *it did not.

7052,Yeah these people don't care they want to do what they want to do
7053,It will probably kill you if you so much as just think about it.

7055,It was like someone turned a switch once the restrictions were removed and suddenly I lived in a pretty quiet area again.
7056,"Those ""experts"" have not talked to my WV townfolk."
7057,I am shocked at all of the people that still feel it is a partisan vaccine.

7064,[removed]
7065,Pretty low prevalence of Delta in the first place actually in SA.
7066,Those can be a joke though I think.
7067,I was coming back from dominican and had the rapid test but they hardly even touch your nose with it.
7068,They want you to be able to leave so I doubt those tests will catch much when they can be told to hardly even go into your nose with it.
7069,Two countries with a lower vaccination rate.
7070,"So far it just appears to be more transmissible, but we don't have any indication yet that it's more dangerous to any particular person who gets infected."
7071,Empirical judgements are too time consuming compared to fear based snap judgments.

7088,So 10% on a random sample seems high but might be 'normal' unfortunately.
7089,"The real question is, how many of the 540 others will test positive in a few days."
7090,The crazy thing is everyone in France has valid ID that can be used to verify against.
7091,We all have our health service card known as Carte Vitale.
7092,They could easily make it so the covid pass is only valid if the details match.
7093,Why they didn’t is beyond me.
7094,Anyone that doesn’t have a Carte Vitale is going to be foreign and so not in the health care system but that means they will have a passport to use instead.
7095,There is no excuse that they don’t have a valid form of ID.

7108,I am trying to stay calm but so worried now!
7109,I’m 3x vaccinated so not really about the virus but any travel regulations because SOME PEOPLE can’t take a damn shot!
7110,I feel like this is a thing people do because they feel like they have to like it because some other kid did it when they were young and didn't want to be not cool.
7111,But buying twice a much stuff isn't panic buying.
7112,It's a sensible thing to do in order to avoid going out as often.

7114,Only those aged 13+ were required to show a negative test before boarding.

7130,"Considering SA is the epicenter of the outbreak, they know more than anyone else."
7131,It seems the biggest threat from this variant so far is that it can escape antibodies produced from vaccines.
7132,Everyone will be looking to Pfizer to produce updated vaccines in about 6 to 8 weeks for a fresh cycle.

7167,"Security check areas will be packed and TSA agents would be overwhelmed, I bet."

7175,&gt; but its not like that mutation on its own instead of P681H is why Delta outcompeted other variants so easily.
7176,P681R is the FCS and its is thought that one really is very important and that the acquisition of the FCS at this site is what allowed the original ancestral virus to start spreading in humans.

7233,My GF and I couldn't remember when we started wearing masks and what life events we had with them off.
7234,"We're starting to feel like we can't even remember what the previous ""normal"" was."
7235,I know all that.
7236,The point is that the base point that they are working off is incredibly low.
7237,"In addition, they have not released a breakdown of cases by vaccination status (we just don't seem to track this as a priority for some reason), but you can look at the area of the outbreak  and see its one of the areas with very low vaccination rates."
7238,I totally agree my son just brought home hand foot and mouth disease from his daycare and I am freaking miserable right now I have Pok marks all over my face and my hands are on fire if Covid did that but left scars on 80% of the people that are infected people would be losing their shit.
7239,One news story said it was probably from an aids patient so it will be interesting to see just how the symptoms vary from Delta
7240,I feel the same way I did in early March of 2020.
7241,Almost everyone I'm close to thought I was paranoid or overreacting about covid.
7242,They are already gearing up to make new vaccines.
7243,100 days
7244,One dose of J&amp;J lags in effectiveness compared to 2 doses of Moderna.
7245,One doses of J&amp;J followed by one dose of Moderna is more effective than two doses of Moderna.

7247,[removed]
7248,Three drug manufacturers are already gearing up to produce a new vaccine.
7249,Should be available in 100 days.
7250,Probably worth looking at last year's graphs to see how many got sick and died in 100 day period and then factor in the increased number due to the increase in r0
7251,Well right now delta is still sweeping the US.
7252,It will continue for months at least and will definitely be months before a modified booster is distributed to pharmacies.
7253,I highly doubt a 4th dose would have higher risk than contracting any variant of covid.
7254,"Or 3 decades…

We never were there to see the previous 4 common colds become the common cold."
7255,It could have only dropped in it’s danger to us after 30 years of people getting it pretty much every year and taking those multiple exposures up into adulthood.
7256,This might be why some of the most isolated people groups on the planet have such a hard time when exposed to something that is common to everybody else.
7257,"It’s just interesting that since this began it seems like people see  2, 3, or 5 years As a long time when talking about covid 19 but honestly it’s really just a blip on the biological radar of human history."
7258,"They gave me the worst skin issues around my mouth and face, so bad I didn’t want to take my mask off.. since we’ve stopped wearing them outside that cleared up."
7259,"Can’t stand them, but wear them when required at businesses"
7260,"Not really, it’s clear J&amp;J lags in effectiveness in comparison to Moderna."
7261,And so waiting a few weeks while staying at home and wearing a mask for me is a better trade off than settling for whatever is around jf it means better immunity.

7290,"Which part of that is ""normal""?"

7292,The sooner you got your first dose the more immunity you'd have now with a third dose.
7293,"Those are all great questions and, I agree, it’s too early to tell."
7294,I guess we will have a lot more clarity over the next 2 to 4 days.
7295,PS I got the joke Lurr.
7296,I do get it.
7297,I know what herd immunity is.
7298,"You’re implying that people who won’t get the vaccine are bad people, and my argument isn’t necessarily agreeing with that."
7299,But wishing *death* upon them probably isn’t any better.
7300,I had an extremely severe reaction to my second dose.
7301,"I’m glad I got it, but I am hesitant to get the booster given I cannot afford to miss work due to inevitable, debilitating side effects I will get from the booster given my chronic illness and susceptibility for reactions from any vaccine."
7302,"I still get any vaccine I am able to, but I am not in a position to be able to miss work due to side effects."

7328,*WHAT ABOUT DEER FREEDOMS???
7329,*
7330,Either tested or vaccinated.
7331,I mistakenly thought people would get motivated to do the right thing :(.
7332,Pretty soon I was over it.
7333,Makes you think about those who were born a century before Zoomers.
7334,"Right around the time they come of age, they're pulled into WW1."
7335,Survive that and return to a global pandemic.
7336,"Then you get 10 good years to build a career, life and family and the great depression hits."
7337,"That's fucking awful, and right as you start pulling out of that, another BIGGER war that's 5x worse than the first one."
7338,"It's the same variant, omnicron, just in different countries."
7339,Yes obviously vaccines are out best solution to end this pandemic.
7340,However I think it’s too soon to say that how Vermont is doing is a good indicator.
7341,We all need to keep staying cautious.
7342,The pandemic is not over.
7343,"I hope the rich countries realise that a virus doesn’t give a shit about borders, you can’t isolate yourselves you must vaccinate the world"
7344,My partner turned 30 right before covid showed up…what a welcome to what is supposed to be a great age
7345,"Being vaccinated doesn’t preclude you from testing positive, even with the other variants."
7346,Weird they became positive en route if they had been tested before!
7347,"Unless this variant is radically different, it should take several days for the majority of people to test positive."
7348,I find it extremely unlikely that anyone that got infected on the plane would test positive upon disembarking.
7349,I believe they have quarantined the whole plane.
7350,Takes three days to test positive
7351,"If you already have it but don't see very high numbers it's a good indicator that this variant cannot outcompete delta

This is good"
7352,"my son recently turned 17 and his father died in 2018, we lost the house 2019, 2020 we had to move just as covid hit and he dropped out of school and didn't leave his room for a year virtually."
7353,I thought it was the move that was too much for him but I think now it was covid.
7354,He is double vaxxed and at least working part time now packing shelves at the supermarket.
7355,Small steps.
7356,I used to dream of big successes for him.
7357,Bingo.
7358,I’ve heard that before—like when the messaging was “whichever vaccine is available was the best one” and that wasn’t true.
7359,So I don’t want to get screwed over again by rushing out to get whatever booster is available.
7360,This data is super compelling though—I’m going to see what’s around and decide which to get I suppose
7361,It should be.
7362,I never said it makes me better than anyone?
7363,What the fuck are you saying?
7364,"As far as those who will not get vaccinated, they are the ones who are putting all other people in harms way."
7365,I just don’t understand how people like you don’t get this.
7366,"If we don’t reach a certain amount of vaccinated people, the virus will mutate and become stronger, therefore eventually rendering the current vaccine useless."
7367,"I understand there are some who cannot take the vaccine, but that is a incredibly small number of people."
7368,I’m tired of listening to people who are perfectly healthy say that they will not get the vaccine.
7369,"Just get the damn shot, and let’s all get past this thing."
7370,"I knew I was going to get a ton of shit for saying this, but fuck it."
7371,[removed]
7372,...meh
7373,"We're still listening to the fear monger, black people testing, scumbag hey?"
7374,"Right on, love that for us"
7375,Yup
7376,Why does it feel like the media is cheering for the virus?
7377,Is...nothing else going on in the world?
7378,It's found in a patient in Belgium who travelled from an unrelated county but *11 days ago* .
7379,So it's more likely she got it locally.
7380,"In which case, this variant is already in a lot of places."
7381,Probably this is a good thing.
7382,It means the variant is not that new and that means the data from South Africa is probably skewed by low Delta prevalence and low vaccination numbers
7383,I'm going to Google this.
7384,Hoping it's not a new adult film people Lego arrangement.
7385,Everything's bigger in dumbass texass
7386,"And we don’t sequence for shit, so it can be here a while before we find it"
7387,We know very little.
7388,Take the good news and bad news with a grain of salt.
7389,All versions of Covid cause mostly very mild cases.
7390,We will need to know a lot more before we can make any true comparisons or draw conclusions.
7391,The side effects you got from the booster sounds like the ones I had from both the first and second dose.
7392,"I'll never get a ""booster""...fuck that."
7393,"I'm ""fully vaccinated"" - as long as that definition holds."
7394,"It doesn't matter the vaccination status, fully vaccinated people can spread the virus."
7395,At this point there is literally nothing we can do except let it run it's course.
7396,Life...is...fatal.
7397,A lot of people can't wrap their heads around that.
7398,"We can do our best but someday, we are all of our bodily functions are going to fail and we will die."
7399,I hope you feel better.
7400,I wouldn't recommend getting another booster.

7411,Thank you for articulating it.
7412,In the hospital where they’ve seen cases 65% of admissions = unvaccinated; 35% = partially vaccinated
7413,Why are they waiting until Monday?
7414,Looks like us citizens will be allowed even after that date.
7415,Is there any quarantine?

7418,[It's well established](https://www.jcmc.com.np/jcmc/index.php/jcmc/article/view/420) and part of numerous strategies to mitigate transmission in the developing world.
7419,You would have a point of it were even remotely possible that this variant were contained.
7420,I don’t understand how people can be so casual about injecting themselves every few months.
7421,Until they themselves get side effects then their eyes open
7422,"Funny thing is, it's highly unlikely to be neutral news, it's either gonna go well or bady."
7423,There’s a lot of mutations in the spike protein that haven’t been seen in other variants.
7424,[removed]
7425,Only came here to say it's crazy I was just talking to someone about the mortality rate of the different types of plague yesterday to a friend of mine who really should get vaccinated and just hasn't.
7426,I try to talk to her about it without being a dick about it.
7427,I just worry because she doesn't have the greatest health already.
7428,It’s not unusual though.
7429,"When covid first hit the markets dropped, when delta hit the markets dropped - its all quite predictable really."
7430,Will likely happen again after the next mutation.

7432,Well I guess I won't be flying Omicron Airlines.
7433,"For us vaccinated people, absolutely."
7434,"However, the first case is only 15 days old so it's surprising there are any measurable number of unvaccinated hospitalizations yet."
7435,Get the booster.
7436,As far as we know it still provides protection against Delta and there's no guarantee this new variant will supplant Delta yet
7437,I’m hoping that’s not the case because in order to travel to the US people need a negative Covid test to come in.
7438,"I almost missed a flight in Spain because I didn’t have one, thank goodness they had a clinic at airport."

7445,"Mild, not ""very mild."""
7446,Mild is used in a clinical context here to mean any severity level not requiring supplemental oxygenation.
7447,"Mild can still be excruciating and brutal, worse than the worst bout of a bad influenza infection you've experienced, and leave you permanently injured."
7448,Source?
7449,"I guess in my thought experiment, it would be much milder."
7450,"Like, common cold mild."
7451,"At this point...........who the fuck cares......

Not me, give zero fucks."
7452,A disease anywhere will eventually spread everywhere.
7453,The point of travel bans is to buy time.
7454,"Roughly speaking, if all cases are imported from South Africa and then begin spreading here at the same rate, then every week of banned travel while South Africa's on an upward trajectory will slow Omicron in the US by that same 1-week amount."
7455,"Once absolute prevalence in the US gets anywhere near the same ballpark as South Africa that completely changes, but of course the travel ban then just drags on."
7456,Very good point.
7457,Things are actually looking surprisingly positive today with this variant.
7458,Hope we don't eat those words in a few days.
7459,"They’ve found the vaccines to be similarly effective in keeping symptoms down, but not stopping the spread."
7460,"A fast antibody response coupled with a slow T and B cell response, if I remember correctly."
7461,"I mean it’s only been a few days, patients in my wife’s ICU typically have mild symptoms until day 8 on average, then shit hits the fan."
7462,"Yeah, I accepted COVID as going to be endemic (and definitely now is) a good while ago - it's well established in the worldwide population and a mutation like this was (essentially) inevitable."
7463,People just didn't want to be downers by saying that too much out loud.
7464,"I mean, a potentially much more lethal variant is certainly possible, and either way, COVID and new potentially dangerous variants will be a fact of life for the foreseeable future."
7465,&gt;There are currently 0 Johannesburg fully vaccinated hospitalizations.
7466,"Well, may we take that as a good sign then, right?"
7467,"Yes, I don't know other details about the passengers yet though."
7468,I live in a US county with a simular issue.
7469,"They actually just changed it to end once we reach 85% vaxed, which should be by February, but I am not sure I belive them."
7470,"The thing is I am OK with targeted mask mandates, we have just set them so broad that it equals masking forever."

7476,"&gt; 46% wasn't ""herd immunity"" for the original virus or Alpha, it was absolutely wrong."
7477,How sure are we of that?
7478,"I'm not aware any particular number was recognised as a definitive herd immunity threshold, indeed the opposite is most likely, that there's no such thing as one magic number as it depends on region specific factors like number of social contacts, inter-region travel, etc."
7479,"Different countries will have different herd immunity thresholds, for the same virus."
7480,In February 2021 India had seen declining case numbers and deaths for five months.
7481,What other than a new variant would have seen that trend change?
7482,"Even today the total attack rate/vaccination rate of Covid in India is a long way short of the estimated herd immunity threshold for Delta, but again cases have fallen significantly with quite aggressively eased restrictions."
7483,"Or, to put it another way, the practical herd immunity threshold in any given place is almost certainly lower than the classical equation of: `1 - (1/R0)` because of heterogeneous network effects."
7484,That and make not being vaccinated equate a declination of corona related intensive care.
7485,Vaccinated people shouldn’t suffer any longer because of sheer selfishness.
7486,Omicron Persi 8
7487,Didn’t they have to be tested or just vaccinated before boarding?

7678,"Get tested and go visit, wear masks, social distance if you prefer, if you’re all vaccinated it’s fine."
7679,"The cost of not seeing someone for multiple years - especially when they’re old and not likely to live much longer, is far greater than the risk of a vaccinated person spreading covid to them."
7680,Nah delta was a monster.
7681,We didn't do this for Delta.
7682,And this won’t be enough.
7683,"This variant has already been found in Europe and Israel, and is likely already spreading in airports around the world."
7684,"The only solution is requiring quarantine for everyone entering the nation, as New Zealand and Australia have proved effective."
7685,"People are panicky creatures, and easily fall victim to sensationalist headlines"
7686,I’m not sure.
7687,Poverty is high in South Africa.
7688,How many people are flying to Europe?
7689,"Also, uptake in vaccines varies among groups but overall it’s low in SA."
7690,Here’s an article I remember from back in January on poverty and coronavirus in South Africa [poverty in ](https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-020-01361-7)
7691,This literally would be the variant to end the pandemic...
7692,IF it can hold on as the strongest variant out pacing every other variant.
7693,This is how we got out of Spanish flu.
7694,Highly transmissible but less severe.
7695,And I'll play the optimist...
7696,It mutates AGAIN and becomes even LESS severe again but more highly transmissible.
7697,We'd be looking at a serious cold only.
7698,Here's to hope.
7699,Cheers to the end.
7700,"This variant has a specific gene deletion that picks up on one of the PCR tests, so countries that use that test will have some means of retroactively examining their PCR data to estimate when this variant started becoming a significant percentage of cases."
7701,"That's exactly why clarifying what ""mild case"" can mean is important"
7702,"Surprised this isn't anywhere reported by the big media yet , very alarming and interesting information"
7703,Buckle up
7704,[removed]
7705,Omnicron sounds like a Marvel Villain…
7706,Its because of a combination of the number of mutations and dominance in sample of cases in SA.
7707,"However, I would bet this will ultimately be fine but at the same people would feel justified in the initial concern."
7708,"Well, more virulent strains would end the pandemic too, with a lot more deceased."
7709,What about this gem of a comment?
7710,&gt; Not all that fishy.
7711,There seems to be a lot of backroom conversations happening amongst governments with this variant.
7712,The variant was found 3 days ago yet we already have travel restrictions put in place.
7713,Something is telling these guys this could be the real deal again.
7714,The one that makes vaccines useless.
7715,Those same officials in the US are very connected and networked to Wall Street.
7716,Make vaccines useless?
7717,Really?
7718,Even boosters?
7719,People are losing their minds right now with zero data and coming up with conspiracies.
7720,This is insane.
7721,This.
7722,"Vaccines help a ton (especially against severe illness, but also significantly against spread), but I believe masking reduces transmission even more (IIRC, about 80% vs 50% reduction in spread for 90% combined)."
7723,This is extra important in the early days of getting covid when most people don't yet know they have it.
7724,Apes together strong
7725,Obviously.
7726,But we need to know first what those mutations entail in terms of severity/infection.
7727,"We already had incipient viral spread in the US at that point, albeit unrecognized."
7728,Shutting down the borders that late in the game would’ve been a pretty futile gesture.
7729,People are celebrating more that it doesn't seem to be some freak horror variant that proves dramatically more deadly.
7730,That's one win we have under our belt.
7731,You think?
7732,Someone at my work place refuse to get the vaccine even after a relative of hers died of covid
7733,Almost like our governments.
7734,"Lockdown

Shut these businesses

Take this medication 

Lockdown again

Take the medication again

No more gyms."
7735,"Oh sorry you're now out of business

Lockdown again."
7736,Oh fuck get me a booster.
7737,Print money.
7738,Inflate prices.
7739,Make housing unaffordable.
7740,Grab more power and control.
7741,Nice to here something positive vibes n a grim week .....
7742,Wii U variant?
7743,This is a terrible and awesome idea.
7744,[deleted]
7745,Which doesn't tell us much and many of the mutations could have little impact.
7746,I dislike how much I agree with you
7747,And more infected people means more dead anyway.
7748,None of this proves that this variant makes vaccines useless or March 2020 lockdowns are coming like other commenters above you are saying.
7749,Saying stuff like that is insane and misinformation until we get more data.
7750,"If you are so asymptomatic that you don't even know you have it except for the results of pre-travel testing, I'd say the vaccine did its job pretty well."
7751,But you already knew that.
7752,[removed]
7753,Transmission can occur anywhere where you are in close contact for 15 minutes or longer.
7754,There was a large spread in cases in BC after a party at a beach.
7755,So it’s really not all for theatre.
7756,"What is safe outside, is socially distanced gatherings - keep 6 feet apart, and the science says you’ll be fine."
7757,But don’t think you’re completely immune being 1 foot away from someone coughing up a storm just because you’re outside.
7758,"Delta has higher transmissibility, but only a slightly more severe clinical course."
7759,Vaccines and therapeutics still work reasonably well to prevent severe health consequences.
7760,"For the CDC, a VOHC has significantly reduced vaccine effectiveness (likely efficacy against severe disease, rather than efficacy against transmission), more severe disease/hospitalizations, significantly reduced therapeutic effectiveness, or failure of diagnostic tests."
7761,I think Delta approached these thresholds.
7762,Too early to say on Omicron.
7763,Evidence to date is substantially higher transmission but no deaths yet attributed.
7764,"Omicron was discovered through case tracing and viral genome sequencing a cluster, which if I gather correctly was mostly among university students in Tshwane."
7765,Not a demographic group that usually has severe health consequences from Covid.
7766,"It's likely present in the general population in South Africa, and likely in a number of countries in regular commerce with the nation."
7767,"I'm awaiting South African stats on hospitalizations, critical cases, and deaths, closely."
7768,"But there still is a small possibility that Omicron is the ""common cold"" variant we're all hoping for, to end the pandemic."
7769,"Easily transmissible, but low virulence."
7770,Giving everyone resistance to more severe disease at low risk.
7771,"That would be sort of miraculous, but is a possibility."
7772,Herman Cain awards are filled with people who made their own risk assessment.
7773,People underestimate their risk.
7774,"I think ""Nu"" is just the greek letter after ""Delta"", so they figured that would be what it's called."
7775,"But they settled on Omicron instead, which is further in the alphabet."
7776,"I'm guessing because ""Nu"" sounds like ""New""."
7777,But IDK why they decided Omicron.
7778,"Maybe because it's so different as well... if they have a virus more similar to Delta that mutates, maybe they'll call that ""nu""."
7779,The vaccination rate before delta hit in India was really low - like 6% or something for a single dose.
7780,Also the government blundered big time by claiming victory over the virus and finally there were super spreader events like state elections and religious gatherings.
7781,Luckily most of the world is now significantly vaccinated than before and hopefully that should limit the cases.
7782,Also to the commenters - have a little fucking empathy for the people who perished from covid in India.
7783,Many of them were older people who couldn’t get vaccinated even if they wanted to.

7788,"That means it's already too late to do anything except, hopefully, work on a better vaccine."
7789,I'm starting to feel like we're getting a glimpse into what used to happen in history.
7790,A sense of fatalism just creeps in.
7791,Or that the Omikron variant has an extremely short incubation period and they got infected during the flight.
7792,Get a job in an industry which you can profit from lockdown (i.e.
7793,car sales) and it makes it even easier.
7794,"Good point, then I guess these people got infected on the plane."

7796,15 out of 110 known test results from 600 passengers.
7797,Awaiting results of the tests from the other passengers.

7799,This includes vaccines.
7800,"https://mobile.twitter.com/jcbarret/status/1463975708770897923/photo/1

It also has mutations in key sites."
7801,And just lots of mutations in general.
7802,We are pretty good at guessing antibody resistancs from genome data.
7803,The transmission advantage was the non-obvious part.. but it appears to be large.
7804,"To be fair, erectile dysfunction although embarrassing is much less visible than paralysis or pockmarks."
7805,You're also assuming they could get it up in the first place.
7806,well now there is no need to be a downer

7808,Merck pill data recently updated to show only 30% efficacy against hospitalization and death
7809,Yeah I wish the damn virus would kill my life
7810,I also wondered about that.

7825,We have permitted international travel for good or ill. Let people get on with their lives.

7831,It becomes even more packed once you get to major cities in the different states.
7832,Well here we go again
7833,They're not any different than the millions of other people on planes everywhere.
7834,"If we allow travel, we allow the spread."
7835,South Africa's test positivity rate is like 2%.
7836,"If 13% of the population has an active infection, then that would mean people with an active infection are &gt;5x *less* likely than the uninfected to seek testing."
7837,Start rooting for Covid and it becomes immensely easy to cope.
7838,"With enough stupidity to go around, Covid might be the eventual winner."
7839,Well I can say this.
7840,If any of them think the US is gonna lock down they are either idiots or just fooling themselves.
7841,Even in the worst of delta not a single state shut down indoor dining.
7842,Yes they would.
7843,Look up polio's death rate compared to covid-19.
7844,Paralytic polio is a fraction of the cases that existed and the mortality rate of paralytic polio is only slightly higher than covid-19's overall death rate which is probably woefully undercounted.
7845,If COVID targeted children or physically disfigured people it would be old news.

7957,The publicly available information about this variant makes it much more clear that it poses a significant threat than what we saw with Delta.
7958,There were very legitimate reasons that the initial Delta outbreak got missed.
7959,I don't think there's anything being hidden from the public.

7974,"We also don't know how it evade vaccination if it does, so maybe even if it don't prevent infection vaccine will still protect from severe cases, but then if it's cold like for vaccinated and similar severity as currents variants for unvaccinated, an increased transmissibility may cause overload health system fast."

7982,"There are gaps in data, different countries recording the same data in different ways etc."
7983,So we may never know exactly how many people were infected at any one time.

7985,E.g.
7986,https://twitter.com/devansinha/status/1393552453619048451 the Indian data very closely matches what you’d expect to see with two completed epidemic curves.
7987,"One for the original virus, followed up by a second caused by Delta lifting the herd immunity threshold."
7988,"You see similar patterns in many countries in Asia and Africa, including (topically) South Africa which was at a record low despite low vaccination before Omicron started to kick off."
7989,"It’s had three distinct peaks, one for the original virus, one for Beta and one for Delta."
7990,"Which is why Omicron is alarming in the first place, whilst it might be another case of increased transmissibility, it might not."
7991,"It might be an immunity advantage, at least vs. the infection-acquired immunity of South Africa."
7992,One common theme in these countries is when they have introduced mitigation measures they’ve tended to be poorly observed.
7993,"Largely because, outside of wealthy areas, there just isn’t the support required to enable them."

8036,because it means disrupting the whole production line and distribution system.

8044,But this only works if having one strain also gives you immunity to the other.
8045,"If that doesn't happen, then it's basically 2 different diseases at that point, each with a separate trajectory through the population."
8046,I'm not sure if mine was an accidental full dose or not.
8047,"CVS's vaccine sign up form allows you to choose specifically what type of dose you're wanting (first, second, booster, third for immunocompromised)."
8048,"I signed up for booster and told them as such when arriving and they marked on my vaccine card ""3rd"" instead of booster, so I don't know."
8049,"There are vaccine manufacture numbers that are specified on the card when they sign off on it, but I haven't been able to find what those mean."
8050,I was just surprised at how much I reacted to it this time and wondered if it was because of a larger than needed dose.

8053,Smh bunch of racists
8054,Aren’t there other variants that also have the S gene target failure in PCR?
8055,I remember it being used as a proxy before instead of extensive sequencing

8112,"This is true when comparing France to Canada, but this data is a bit misleading as different countries define cities differently."
8113,"All of the French cities listed are Paris itself and small cities around Paris, which in another country would probably all be grouped together in a larger single city."

8134,Omicron Energy in shambles.
8135,Immune evasion doesn't mean vaccines and previous natural immunity are now useless against the new variant.
8136,It's all modeling at this point.
8137,We need a bit more time for real-world data.
8138,"The good news is that SA has said that infections/symptoms have remained 'extremely mild', and the gents from Hong Kong are basically asymptomatic."
8139,Pretty good news considering.
8140,That's still would be a good news as it would free hospitals.
8141,Spreading to other animals is not good.
8142,It is additional vectors and additional incubation points for mutations.

8166,so fear pushing by the media?
8167,understood
8168,👆 And that's how you justify the deaths of millions.
8169,All because you don't want to wear a simple light cloth too...
8170,Do we know if “antigenic sin” is a concern with the mRNA vaccines?
8171,That would suck badly.
8172,"“Original antigenic sin, also known as antigenic imprinting or the Hoskins effect,[1] refers to the propensity of the body's immune system to preferentially utilize immunological memory based on a previous infection when a second slightly different version of that foreign pathogen (e.g."
8173,a virus or bacterium) is encountered.
8174,"This leaves the immune system ""trapped"" by the first response it has made to each antigen, and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections."

8181,The pill was given to patients every 12 hours for 5 days in this particular trial.
8182,I believe this will be a game changer and will likely be one of the best ways for the world to get back to normal.

8305,We did get herd immunity but then the effect of the vaccine dropped and so we got boosters and regained herd immunity.

have been described before and are associated with increased transmissibility, immune escape, or other properties."
8314,"**A synthetic variant previously described with 20 mutations in the spike protein was associated with almost

investigations and vaccine effectiveness studies are needed to assess to which extent the variant will have an
impact on vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough infections."""

8358,10:1 is different than 2:1.
8359,It’s more like 100 million 50 microgram doses.
8360,Exactly
8361,You're only thinking about yourself in that scenario.
8362,You aren't thinking about the thousands of hospital staff who have to deal with and be exposed to Covid every day.
8363,You aren't thinking about millions of family members who will have to deal with the loss of a loved one because other people chose not to take it seriously.
8364,You aren't thinking about the regular people who won't be able to receive care for unrelated issues because hospital beds are at full capacity.
8365,There are more issues but you get my point.

8408,"I was feeling better the last few months, got the chance to get into contact with the people who supported me and even got a job in that same team, still struggled with negative thoughts which influenced my job, but I got the better over that after a good talk with my boss."
8409,But my country is facing another lockdown and my work is also closed.
8410,I’m not fired and will get my income.
8411,But I don’t want to slip into that negative spiral yet again because of a lack of interactivity.

8509,One of the things we're taught (or at least I was) in EMT and Medic training is that the mild-to-severe scale is different for every person.
8510,"Like the 0-10 pain scale, when we say ""10 is the worst pain you can imagine"" is demonstrably different for any given human being based on their life experience and sensitivity to pain."
8511,"So one person's 10 might be the time they had 3rd degree burns over 20% of their body, so this appendicitis pain is more a 5... but Peter Griffin's shin, to him, is a 8 or 9."
8512,"In the medical field, after watching people and collating millenia of information on what actually will kill a human and what will not, we have a standardized grouping of severities in medical care that are completely different from any individual person's perception."
8513,"Medical professionals say 'Mild', but each individual human being might say anything from 'mild' to 'severe' based on their own experiences, and to make it even more fun the media uses the terms interchangeably, so right now that communication disconnect is causing us all to need antidepressants."

8620,"Nevertheless, footage showed that during routine testing on day 12, which took place within the doorway of the hotel rooms, there was a 50-second window between closing the door to the room of case-patient C and opening the door to the room of case-patients D and E. Therefore, we hypothesized that suspended aerosol particles were the probable mode of transmission in this instance, and that the enclosed and unventilated space in the hotel corridor probably facilitated this event (4)."
8621,A commissioned review of the ventilation system found that the rooms in question had a net positive pressure compared with the corridor.
8622,Fomite transmission through use of communal bins in the corridor was considered to be a less probable route of transmission because contact with the bin lid by case-patient D was &gt;20 hours after it was touched by case-patient C.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/5/21-0514_article)

8661,does incubation mean that you cannot detect infection or that it lies dormant until it starts showing symptoms (incubated)?

8663,Firstly do not listen to the government when it comes to vaccines.
8664,Always and i mean always listen to what the scientists say and right now the scientists are saying that this shouldn't change your decision on getting vaccinated whether it's a 1 first dose or a booster etc.
8665,Also it's unlikely the vaccines will be completely ineffective against the new variant.
8666,From what I've read there is a fear it will effect our vaccines but they reckon it should at least still provide significant protection against severe disease.
8667,Another thing we don't know much about this new variant and i mean we know absolutely nothing tbh other than the amount of spike proteis.
8668,"Everyone's still trying to figure out if the new variant will even overtake Delta since cases are still super low, no idea whether it causes less or more severe cases of covid than Delta and whether the vaccines efficacy is effected or not."
8669,This will still take a few weeks to figure out.
8670,And in the event we do need another shot it's unlikely we'll need 2-4 shots a year it'll probably be this year we have the most shots then if we need shots again it'll probably just be like the annual flu where we have to get an annual booster shot for covid.
8671,Given you have asthma i would highly recommend to get a booster if your past 6 months since that places you at higher risk for Delta.
8672,I'd also highly recommend just talking to your doctor since I'm sure they'd be more than happy to help you out with any concerns you have.
8673,The worst part would be thinking you’re in the 2nd quarter only to find you’ve just about wrapped it all up.
8674,Full hospital.
8675,You have to pick one to get the bed and ventilator.

8736,not true
8737,People expect doctors and scientists to universally agree on everything the moment a discovery is made.
8738,Yet they rarely realize that experts questioning what their colleagues or even they themselves observe and interpret is what contributes to more robust conclusions drawn later.
8739,"If one interprets these early phase discussions as poor communication, that individual is in the wrong."
8740,"Now of course not everyone is expected to think scientifically, even if they really should."
8741,I believe experts must take precaution in not making bold claims to the public without sufficient evidence and expert consensus.
8742,"Furthermore, those that are responsible for communicating to the public should discuss viewpoints from numerous different experts in the field - the more voices heard, the more nuanced the conclusions will be."
8743,"Of course, media needs to stop writing clickbait headlines"
8744,Mentally I’m not sure we can go through this again

8746,The time to replace Fauci with someone less polarizng and with way less baggage was the first day of the Biden administration.
8747,"If Omicron is going to spiral into a legit state of emergency/crisis, someone else than the person who lied about the efficacy of wearing masks during the early days of the pandemic, needs to deliver the messaging."
8748,Yep.
8749,"My organization's pandemic response plan that we totally overhauled with lessons learned from Covid now includes much earlier, much more drastic action."
8750,The cost of doing that is significantly less than getting it wrong and ending up shut down due to sick employees.
8751,"Its already everywhere, at this point."

8823,I live in WNY (Buffalo area).
8824,We have a population of less than 900k in Erie County and our positivity rate is around 10%.
8825,Our hospitals are at full capacity.
8826,Only 63% of our population is fully vacinated.
8827,It is insane to me that one of the most densely populated cities in the world has a lower positivity rate than WNY.
8828,Our department of health has been working so hard to encourage residents to get vacinated.
8829,This week Erie County issued a mask mandate for all public places.
8830,A lot of resturants are now implementing mask and vaccine rules.
8831,Our county comptroller who has been working relentlessly to educate our city with covid numbers has been subjected to harassment and actual death threats that have resulted with arrests.
8832,.
8833,"We have a large population that are self proclaimed ""patriots"" that have no problem comparing themselves to holocaust victims."

8838,Hang in there dude.
8839,You will see better days.
8840,I have a feeling this new variant didn't start in South Africa.
8841,Some of the data I've been seeing data people's and various scientists posting is making it look like this thing started in 2020 and just kept mutating as it passed from person to person .
8842,This makes me wonder if we will ever find out where it came from.

Why on fucking earth does any country or even any airline allow unvaccinated individuals to travel like that?"
8862,Absolutely fucking ridiculous.
8863,Omicron perceie 8
8864,and it wasn't widespread in NYC until March and the rest of the state months later.
8865,if you're correct that Covid was in NY in December then you just proved my point that it took months for Covid to spread.
8866,"If Merck is granted Emergency Use Authorization with these results, does that significantly lower the bar for other COVID pills like Bucillamine &amp; Paxlovid and open up the market to other drug manufacturers in clinical trials ?"
8867,Good human
8868,Hopefully this is true.
8869,Here we go again
8870,"There's no way this would actually happen in our real world, but I've long been of the opinion that we need some kind of global crisis fund."
8871,Every country would pay into it (according to their means) and the money would be used for a variety of issues (maybe more than one fund).
8872,For Covid-19 and other possible epidemics it would allow countries to take drastic measures to lock down and limit spread while being somewhat protected from the incredible economic cost.
8873,Because the global community would share the burden.
8874,It could also be used to help pay for vaccination campaigns.
8875,"Having 90% vaccination rates in a rich country is great, but it could amount to little if poorer countries develop new strains because their vaccination rate is at &lt;10%&gt; 

And while epidemics are obviously the most pressing issue, there are others."
8876,Climate change being the big one.
8877,We're all shocked at the burning of the rain forest or fossil fuel use or garbage in the rivers and so many more.
8878,"We can sit on our high horses and judge them, only because we've already burned our forests."

8886,Finally some sanity
8887,They didn't skip.
8888,You can find information about all the variants up to this point even if some didn't become significant.
8889,I mean it’s gonna be here forever.
8890,Animals can literally be vectors.
8891,Is your plan to vaccinate every animal on the planet?
8892,Nothing points to it being worst ever lol.
8893,These sensationalist titles need to relax.
8894,Just because it has many mutations does not mean it's more severe.
8895,There is no data pointing to this.
8896,Wait for data before once again scaring the public...just like lambda.
8897,It disappeared into the wind.
8898,"No, a priest can take care of that"
8899,No they found it at the beginning of November.
8900,"Once bitten, twice shy after Delta I guess."
8901,Also there’s so many unverified rumours floating around that paint this variant as more infectious (500% more) than Delta AND is more lethal AND hits young people hard AND can evade vaccines.
8902,"Even if they turn out to be untrue, these rumours are basically everything people fear about a new variant all in one at the same time, and governments taking pre-emotive action so quickly seems to suggest things are going very wrong very fast."
8903,I hope you're right.
8904,"Some of us haven’t lived much more than a fourth, which I’d argue is substantially worse"

8910,"This is why I press for hard numbers, thresholds, plans and off-ramps for getting rid of mandates and restrictions."
8911,I can put up with them as interim measures but I simply do not trust officials when it comes to holding up their end of the bargain and removing them.
8912,"If you're not worried, why not take the booster and then later get a better one if it comes out."
8913,"I got the Moderna booster on Tuesday, and it kicked my ass like the first one."
8914,"Today was the first day my arm didn't hurt, but I'm still tired."
8915,That's true.
8916,"The only sticking point is that COVID has a nasty habit of developing into long COVID, which happens in, studies indicate, about a third of survivors, sometimes months after the apparent ""recovery."""
8917,"And long COVID includes some nasty, life-changing effects."
8918,"So increased transmissibility means that many **more** people will catch COVID, die or recover, and a third will suffer long-term effects."
8919,Because it’s non-judgemental.
8920,They don’t want to name the variants after the areas where they crop up - we all know how politicians and idiots play games with things like the “China virus” or the “Brazil variant” or whatever.
8921,"Just because a variant crops up in a particular state or country, it’s not their fault."
8922,"So an alphabet naming system is neutral and easy, and the Greek alphabet is known and recognisable enough to most people that it is simple enough to use."
8923,It’s a bit like hurricanes.
8924,"They have their own slightly quirky system of naming them from a rotating list of first names like Arthur Becky Chip, etc, depending on what region is doing the naming etc."
8925,"It’s just a convention - it doesn’t mean anything in particular, it’s just *a* way to name things."
8926,Anyone thing pfizer et al blocked releasing patent shit so that new variants were more likely to pop up in poorer regions and filter out to the rich world to keep the gravy train of rona funding
8927,I buy and sell stocks all the time and I’ve always said the stock market goes up or down on its own and the news of the day is what is used to explain why it went up or down.
8928,If people are emptying their savings over a covid variant the world is fucked.
8929,Kind of a weird thing to say the same day a ton of travel bans just got put in place…… life is not back to normal for anyone with family in the many countries with travel restrictions

8974,There is no excuse for the lack of testing.

8999,Some viruses are not effectively eliminated with the natural immune response though.

9001,The virus that causes chicken pox is a good example.
9002,"With SARS-COV2, natural immunity gives a more varied response."
9003,So the body makes antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein as well as the spike protein.
9004,The problem is it’s very difficult to predict how an individual responds.
9005,Some people don’t seroconvert after mild illness and some do.
9006,The best chance of effective protection is from vaccination.
9007,I don’t think there is much doubt about that.
9008,"In both natural immunity and vaccinated immunity, there is a process where the virus antigens are taken back to germicidal centers in the body and b-cells test new antibodies out to predict variants that might evolve in the future."

9083,More concerning about this medication is the potential risk of increasing your chances of getting cancer or even creating a super variant of Covid.
9084,It works by creating numerous errors in the process of replicating the virus.
9085,Otherwise known as variants.
9086,The idea is that with enough errors the virus will stop being functional.
9087,Except there are indicators that this process could cross over to human cells.
9088,It also creates an opportunity for a very different and catastrophic version of covid.
9089,One of the *good* things about coronavirus is its slow evolution.
9090,This medication could take away our one advantage.
9091,https://www.barrons.com/articles/merck-covid-pill-risks-51633398722
9092,Mu was observed for months by scientists and was essentially dismissed as less of a problem than delta.
9093,Then a month later they gave it a name.
9094,"In fairness it actually is still a problem (unlike every other non-delta lineage, it has not gone away, and Mu+ continues to do stuff in Colomia)."
9095,"Omicron was sequenced on Tuesday, media panic started on Wednesday, and what we've learned since then certainly hasn't been reassuring."
9096,This is an entirely different scenario than what we've seen with any previous VOC.
9097,How long will it take this variant to be all over the world?
9098,"It's obviously a question of when, not if, with a variant so contagious that it badly outcompeted the Delta Variant."
9099,I’m used to that.
9100,1) See thing ahead of time.

9106,Hard to pronounce lol
9107,I really don’t like how this is giving me ‘start of the pandemic’ vibes from last year.
9108,There's no evidence that Africa is squandering vaccines.
9109,"By Oct 1, Africa has received 200 million doses (https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076), and Africa has finished administering 200 million doses by early November (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1232773/total-number-of-covid-19-vaccination-doses-in-africa/)."

9112,"Yes, we have a regular flu shot that has been around a long time and we take once a year."
9113,I’m aware vaccines are safe.
9114,I took mine.
9115,"My question was - if we are having new variants, where early reports suggest the current vaccine may be ineffective, given my current lifestyle, is it worth rushing out and getting a booster when I will need to take some revised booster in 100 days."
9116,Potentially 3 shots around 1 year is a lot.
9117,That’s all I’m saying
9118,Because there’s no epidemiological value in closing borders at this point.
9119,It’s all political points.
9120,In the media’s defense it wasn’t them that basically put up travel bans after a single press release.

9131,They are not suitable for shipment to Africa.
9132,"And again, the variant that prompted your concern about boosters was created despite Africa having ample access to vaccines - their people just didn’t want them."
9133,Aka blessed
9134,They updated the story and actually only 61 of 600 ended up being positive.
9135,We're SO fucked.

61 of 600 passengers from South Africa tested positive for corona

Of the 600 passengers on two KLM flights from South Africa, 61 tested positive for the corona virus."
9148,The two flights landed at Schiphol yesterday morning.
9149,"All passengers had to be tested, because of the new variant of the coronavirus that is circulating in southern Africa."
9150,Last night the Municipal Health Service (GGD) said they were taking into account about 85 positive coronavirus tests.
9151,That estimate was made after 110 of the 600 test results were known.
9152,"Of those, 15 were positive."
9153,"Which variant of the coronavirus the positive tested travelers are infected with, will be investigated as soon as possible."
9154,"Omikron variant

Since 12:00 yesterday afternoon, a no-fly zone has been in effect from South Africa and other countries in southern Africa due to the new coronavirus variant discovered there."
9155,"It is the so-called omikron variant, which is currently circulating mainly in South Africa and Botswana."
9156,"According to a WHO working group, this variant of the coronavirus appears to be spreading faster than other variants."
9157,"At the time the outgoing cabinet announced the flight ban, there were still two flights from South Africa en route to the Netherlands."
9158,The passengers all had to be tested at Schiphol on Friday afternoon.
9159,Special test lanes were set up at the airport for that purpose.
9160,Travelers with a negative result were allowed to leave the airport.
9161,They still have to spend five days in quarantine at home.

9173,What would you like them to do?
9174,They have shared literally billions of vaccines.
9175,Many ending up trashed or unused because third world countries lack distribution and have a fear of vaccines provided from foreign powers.
9176,Nor do they have the infrastructure to safely create vaccines themselves.
9177,Meanwhile Europe for the most part list2ned to the WHO about boosters until very recently and is suffering the consequences of that in terms of increased breakthrough infections.

9192,"or do we just ""study"" it to see if its a concern or not?"
9193,"one, if its not a concern, just pretend its ok even though some variants have recombinant parts from past variants?"
9194,"or two, ok its turns out to a big concern, but too late anyway the train has left the station?"

9202,"Part of it is that the first booster isn't really a booster like boosters for waning immunity, more that the first shots weren't enough in the first place - that's what I've understood."
9203,Not sure the government has much to do with the private companies developing vaccines all over the place but who knows.
9204,"Additional shots does not seem that foreign to me, given that's how many of the past ones have been like."
9205,"Mmr, chicken pox, etc"
9206,I know.
9207,Boosters are definitely way better than relying on something like this.
9208,"Just wondering, since I can’t quite find data on whether or not exposure without infection does anything for the immune system."
9209,"Would be cool if it did, but boosters are obviously the safer route regardless."
9210,I think Nu sounded too much like Mu which would invite too much confusion and a Xi variant would invite too much focus on the name rather than the science so they probably decided to skip over to Omicron as a result.
9211,Banning the peoples of South Africa... seems a bit racist to me.
9212,"Even during the worst of the delta spike, nowhere near me shut down or even lessened capacity"
9213,"&gt; The Sputnik one is very encouraging, given that so many people have tried to claim it's ineffective."

9297,This number was theorized to be 70% but it looks to be closer to 95-99% of the overall population now.
9298,3.
9299,"If the Delta variant hadnt taken root and If we had 70-80% vaccinations in most countries there wouldnt be a pandemic anymore

One of the bigger mistakes was getting fixated on that 70% number."
9300,Given that even the OG strain caused substantial damage to even young people they should have aimed for the 95% vaccination as benchmark from the beginning.

9344,"However, it's unclear how effective a vaccines are for a lot of vulnerable people."
9345,"E.g., many persons receiving chemo have been fully vaccinated but, because of the chemo they are receiving/their immune systems, the vaccines aren't as effective."
9346,I would go further.
9347,We could have trained lay people on how to handle Covid patients within a month or two.
9348,The problem is that regulations say you have to be certified on the full set of care and Covid isn't dangerous enough for us to make change procedures.

9363,[here](https://youtu.be/WyF8RHM1OCg) we go again
9364,"Never thought I’d say this, but the pandemic has opened my eyes to the important of private companies."
9365,I am so thankful for-profit institutions are in charge of vaccine development instead of the government.
9366,"Based on how the US government has handled the pandemic, I would be terrified if vaccine development and was in their hands alone."
9367,Yes.
9368,Thank you.
9369,I've been saying this the whole time and this shit isn't gonna stop trying to end humanity because we humans think we know anything about this virus.
9370,We know such a small fraction of all that is true out there anyone who thinks they know everything about viruses is an arrogant ignoramus.
9371,The Covid eagle has landed.
9372,"“decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics”

Good news is that the previously described variants haven’t been evolving in the presence of the new antivirals so that will likely still a good tool for a while."
9373,Not sure what to do about the vaccines if they virus evolves to evade immunity.
9374,Indefinite lockdowns seem to be out of the question.
9375,N95s are more broadly available for folks who want one in many places.
9376,"I think beyond rejiggering the vaccines and developing new therapeutics, I think we’re stuck with the virus for the time being and we have to accept that, ya know?"
9377,Israel did not think so though.
9378,Okay.
9379,"One more Q today:

If/when Pfizer etc."
9380,tweak the vaccine(s) will they need to do studies/seek approval etc.
9381,all over again?
9382,Or will it be much speedier?
9383,But vaccinated people are getting sick again and have been for a long time.
9384,Delta has caused a ton of breakthrough infections.
9385,Vaccinated people already get sick.
9386,A lot of vaccinated people get sick actually.
9387,The argument is that they don't die.
9388,So getting sick is not the bar we should be looking at for this Omicron brand of Covid.
9389,It is the mortality rate.
9390,????
9391,Where in Ohio are you?
9392,Columbus has a mask mandate and I’d say prob like 90% of people follow it.
9393,Good time to buy stocks.
9394,Thank you I needed this
9395,[removed]
9396,Historically speaking every single time the government and media tries to downplay something it blew up spectacularly in their faces.
9397,I'm going to go with recent history that we should be cautious.
9398,"The good news is that governments around the world are being proactive for once, so we might not get caught off guard this time."

9400,I always knew Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't of this planet
9401,"There was very little spread in Gauteng when it emerged there, it hasn't outcompeted anything."
9402,I’m fully vaccinated and also got COVID prior to being vaccinated.
9403,"I was recently exposed to COVID very heavily and for a long period of time, but I never got it (confirmed by multiple PCR tests at different times during the whole ordeal)."
9404,"Do you think I got an immune boost at all, or nah?"
9405,Is there any data on that?
9406,You don't know that for sure.
9407,We also don't know if it's even that deadlier than Delta which it is likely not to be.
9408,So still no need for any drastic measures.
9409,[removed]
9410,Is there anything here to indicate a higher fatality rate?
9411,"Depends on where you live in the U.S. Last year around this time, in my city, they shut down indoor dining, movie theaters, museums."
9412,etc.
9413,"again and heavily limited capacity at what was left open, and schools were still mostly closed."
9414,"Thankfully there is currently no talk of that happening again here (we just still have to wear masks, and some places limit capacity voluntarily, not by city mandate)."
9415,I was supposed to take work trips to Germany in late January and mid February.
9416,It looks like both will be canceled.
9417,Anti Vaxxers and anti maskers need to be held account for fucking up society for the rest of us.
9418,I’m getting tired of it.
9419,[removed]
9420,it is not confirming anything.
9421,"any statement other than those about the genome is a hedge, using words like ""may"" or ""potentially""."
9422,we don't know anything about how this variant actually behaves
9423,Welp.
9424,I guess spreading fear and lack of information is out the door.
9425,This is just speculation and sensationalisim at the current point in time.
9426,We just don’t have enough information.
9427," I'm not assuming there will be a higher death \*rate\* for those who catch Omicron (we don't know that yet), but the fact that a higher total number of people will have infections means that given a set number of deaths for COVID infections in general, a higher number of people will die."
9428,Grim how?
9429,Just that it’s spreading fast?
9430,Imagine if Americans banded together for an indiscriminate hidden killer the same way they did after 9/11.
9431,"Bad comparison sure, but the concept of unity in response to a sudden threat to the fabric of our countries identity and the polar opposite of the vibe in our communities is just so sad to know its possible but we likely won't get there anytime soon."
9432,Even if something major happened.
9433,There would be even more division I fear..
9434,[removed]
9435,Why do they call them Apple Jacks when it doesn’t even taste like apples
9436,I don't think so.
9437,The publicly available data is pretty grim.
9438,Naw.
9439,Just make it more apple flavoured.
9440,I wish there was a variant that knocks some sense into stupid ppl..
9441,[removed]
9442,How much training does someone really need to handle Covid?
9443,Surely you could train people to handle one virus fairly quickly.
9444,"I assumed the worst part would last about 5 years based on how long the Spanish flu lasted, then it would just become a nuisance I can avoid with a yearly booster for the rest of my life."
9445,"Lol agreed - just bought one, don't want my Seamaster slandered"
9446,There's something wrong with how that article is dated.
9447,The first link links to an article dated November 25.
9448,So unless the author can see into the future the July date is wrong.
9449,Might be but it’s also possible to consider that they are pronounced entirely differently.
9450,Most people would likely struggle with the pronunciation of the Xi From the Greek alphabet.
9451,[removed]
9452,I posted about Wall Street so I thought I should include this article I found on Russia.
9453,It’s so hard to find English article on Russia.
9454,The ship has sailed or the flight has flown?
9455,That is based on the assumption not everyone will be exposed... At this point I think instead of total cases we should be worried about it getting through the vaccines.
9456,"Citizens starting to demand a return of their rights from the Government, better introduce a new ""Variant"" to Covid-19."

9459,Back to sewer poop testing
9460,Some of us live alone.
9461,Welp they got 2022 covered... Pray for 23 it'll get better
9462,That Flu add on has been promised for years but it never arrives.
9463,I’m calling it vapourware.
9464,Well this seems like a big jump?

9467,[removed]
9468,"From what I have gathered, there is, effectively, no medical reason to refuse vaccination, just like there was no medical reason to prevent mask wearing."
9469,"So people with exceptions would be very, very few."
9470,"I mean, how quickly it outcompeted Delta and led to a surge of cases in Gauteng is certainly concerning... 

And although many mutations doesn't mean anything on its own, the fact that it accumulated many mutations that we have studied in the past for their impact, AND it is creating a surge in an area that had no problem suppressing Delta certainly does seem concerning, doesn't it?"
9471,Hospitalization risk is really the only good piece of news I'm expecting might come in.
9472,"Biggest concerns are transmissibility, current vaccine efficacy, and lethality."
9473,None of that is known yet.
9474,Welp
9475,I don’t remember when seat belts gave me a disease…so…
9476,The Guardian is as bad as every other newspaper in the UK for clickbait crap and scaremongering.

9482,"Not just many, most."
9483,Only kids under 13 were not required to be tested.
9484,"However, the test used was the Rapid Antigen Test which isn't the best at the earliest stages of infection."
9485,PCR is much more sensitive but takes longer.
9486,I think you’re forgetting the economic/cultural achievements that led to the fall of the Soviet Union…

9488,I live in a different continent than my family.

9490,I am fully vaccinated.
9491,Why should I not travel?
9492,How is it pronounced?
9493,&gt;day and back.
9494,"Honestly, the holiday did wonders for my mental health."
9495,"Travelling is what I pretty much live for pre-Covid, and so I don't think it is as black and white as stay home."
9496,"Of course I abided by rules where I needed to, vaccinated, COVID pass etc."
9497,I don't think it's unreasonable at all.
9498,I live in a different continent than my family.
9499,I have not seen them in two years.
9500,I am fully vaccinated.
9501,Why can I not travel?
9502,If 10% of the people on this plane were infected what's the point of travel restrictions?
9503,Is there seriously a reason to believe that in the past week the percentage would have been significantly different?
9504,I’m gonna say it…please lock everyone back down!
9505,I was starting to love this new introverted person and then the real world busy life started back.
9506,"Just wait until the virus mutates into like 30% death rate in a year or so and you should worry but yeah humanity will collapse in few years, materials will be low, war will break out to steal resources and ontop of corona, Goodluck with that"

9508,[removed]
9509,"Also assuming they were all vacinnated, being a prerequisite for international travel"
9510,Maybe it’ll make people take things serious having an ominous names and all.
9511,I don’t enjoy wearing them either.
9512,When the op said “mask-phobia” I was imaging the people who act like wearing one is going to kill them.
9513,Complaints is also a correct translation.
9514,I suspect that foxhound read it correctly and was just joking.
9515,It’s funny too!
9516,Thanks to you for translation and thanks to foxhound for making a good job.
9517,"We currently have the lowest cases in South Africa since covid began, although we've seen the curve change in the past 2 weeks."
9518,We had about 2400 new cases reported yesterday in a population of 55million.
9519,"The Dutch article states:

&gt;All passengers over the age of 13 flying from South Africa to the Netherlands were required to show a negative rapid test of a maximum of 24 hours old upon boarding."
9520,Only EU citizens were allowed on KLM flights
9521,"In 2-5 years humanity will collapse due to mutations claiming 70%+ death rate, remember this comment"
9522,Can I mutate if I get upset?
9523,"I told my teenage daughter the same thing earlier, if they don't want to call it nu and deal with nu covid, how did they decide on a ominous transformer sounding name!?"
9524,How reassuring!
9525,"Yes, I know."
9526,It will be interesting to see if the approval process also becomes faster since the underlying technology is the same
9527,You’re welcome!
9528,Enough gloom and doom.
9529,"The vaccines work, and variants are not completely new viruses."
9530,I think we could all use a bit of optimism.
9531,I know that I could use some.
9532,Delta variant would like a word with you.
9533,You still believe that?
9534,They said around 85 initially so around 15%.
9535,And then u add in the others so its probably 30-40%.
9536,These ppl are also probably vaccinated also.
9537,Symptoms.
9538,(I speak Dutch.)
9539,"Historically, it's not that unusual to have major waves of disease kill off large chunks of the population -- proportionally, a lot more than COVID."
9540,It didn't end the world.
9541,"Things will be different for a few years, and then return to some sort of normalcy, I think more abruptly than you realize."
9542,"Those of us currently experiencing it will bear the memories, but the next generation will read about it in history books as just one of those things."
9543,"Of course, by then climate change will make things pretty abnormal in a whole other set of ways."
9544,But COVID?
9545,"Society will get through that and move on, as it has countless times in the past."
9546,R0 of 40 seems really high.
9547,"That being said, it's possible I guess?"
9548,RACIST!
9549,Oregon only brought masks back and that's it
9550,"When the virus first hit Germany in Jan. 2020, medical professionals said not to worry about it because all cases were mild."
9551,"Now we are dealing with even fewer known cases of the new variant, mostly in young people."
9552,It's too early to tell.
9553,Cool story bro

9556,Can we just close the borders to countries outside Europe already?
9557,"They keeo bringing in variants (yes, I am aware that this is a case from Belgium but the variant originated in Africa and was brought back because of tourism)."
9558,Reminds me of the doctor from Arrested Development.
9559,[removed]
9560,Some people are immune to good advice.
9561,no personality is not dependent on iq.
9562,people who can be influenced have accommodating personalities
9563,What will they name the variant after zeta variant?
9564,"Even though there was benefit from the vaccines of course it's almost like some of these companies producing vaccines and treatments may have fudged things for profit in the name of ""good intention"" and to be the first one to the finish line..."
9565,Apparently there is a new study in the works that has shown mRna vaccinations to create an up to 25% risk of an acute coronary/cardiovascular events within the first 2.5 months after injection...
9566,Waiting for the study to be fully released so it can be peer reviewed.
9567,Believer in science but really feeling duped these days by incompetent leaders and for profit business.
9568,Damnnn what state you in?
9569,In my city we wear masks 💯
9570,Original source is that 10% of people are confirmed positive.
9571,Source: Dutch news and original article Reuters is citing from.
9572,Question is how many of the 600 passengers will be infected due to their proximity to the positive cases in the airplane.
9573,And how many will actually effective quarantaine themselves without infecting family or friends.
9574,[removed]
9575,Lol oh Georgia.
9576,You should have said so.
9577,You're in one of the main epicenters of stupid.
9578,Get out of the south and it's totally different.
9579,"I realized last year when we took stock of what we had in the house with a freezer and a pantry habitually full, water emergency tanks filled up, a large sack of tp (the local football team for children sells large sacks to get some income) it hit us that we have become middle aged."
9580,"We kind of thought we vere quite young still, but honestly, it is a very middle age thing to always have 10 kg of flour and 10 kg of meat stored."
9581,It's waiting on Pi.
9582,"That's definitely why, and it's the right decision."
9583,Politics aside it's just confusing (and potential fuel for conspiracy theories).
9584,"If there was a world leader of any political persuasion named Omicron, I'm sure they would have skipped that too."
9585,"They also skipped Nu because it's too easily confused with ""new""."
9586,What a fear-mongering headline.
9587,U aren't including all the hospital where people survived with aid?
9588,People that couldn't get into overbooked hospitals and died.
9589,Or people that would have died without vaccine.
9590,"Your facts are true, but skewed in your favour"
9591,"Sorry if this is the wrong place (in which case, where could I get this info) but I'm curious about info regarding traveling to the UK."
9592,"Before the pandemic I frequently traveled to UK, about 6-8 times a year to attend some concerts and so on."
9593,I sometimes didn't even stay at a hotel because I was in the country for about 24 hours and just stayed at the airport.
9594,"I read that to travel to the UK now (from the EU, I should specify) even if you are fully vaxxed (Pzier), you must take a test on day 2 and also fill out a passenger locator form."
9595,"My question is, how should I fill out any form or order any test to be taken in the UK if I'm going to be there for so little time."
9596,Does anybody else have any experience to traveling to the UK from EU for such a short period as of late?
9597,I usually don't even have a hotel or an address for any test to be delivered.
9598,Something that may cause an issue when trying to leave the country later perhaps.
9599,hilarious because your post is so generic you could be in either camp.
9600,Can't tell from what you wrote.
9601,lol.
9602,"So that illustrated ""both sides"" more than my post, where I actually bothered to describe details of the two camps extremely differently."
9603,"Also I'm definitely not in the ""center"" of those two politically."
9604,lol.
9605,Independent doesn't mean center.
9606,Stop watching cable news.
9607,Moronic=the anagram of Omicron.
9608,Jokes on you.
9609,"Awh shit, here we go again."
9610,"If it remains ""as"" deadly as it is, it'll still mean more deaths if we get more of it (more infections)."
9611,"And if vaccine protection is lost, it'll mean even more death because even with a new mRNA vaccine in 100 days it'll take months before most of the vulnerable can be immunized."
9612,South Africa is also [very young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Africa#/media/File:South_Africa_single_age_population_pyramid_2020.png) compared to the [population in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#/media/File:USA2020dec1.png).
9613,And the African President lives in this big presidential palace in the form of a big pyramid.
9614,"Poor testing equipment/training/standards on one end, better quality on the other."
9615,"I think it already is all over the world, at this point , with all the air travel."
9616,"Imagine out of 600 random flyers, 1 in 10 was infected with this variant."
9617,"There was not enough time for them to catch the virus and test positive (in 24 hours), which means they were infected before boarding the plane."
9618,Think about that.
9619,1 in 10 random SA flyers.
9620,It's not going to be an easy ride.
9621,But we can do it.
9622,"I’m beginning to think that this has ripped through the world already, that cold that everyone had recently and negative on rapid and pcr tests 

Don’t they have to pay particular attention on the PCR test now because of S gene drop out?"
9623,Why not Xi?
9624,Isn't that the next Greek letter
9625,I had the same reaction as you really quickly.
9626,Actually had night sweats too.
9627,We have the results.
9628,61 of them were positive.
9629,10 percent of the total.
9630,"Good think we sent Lois lane to fly there and gather paperwork during a pandemic, Because it would have been lost via email."

9635,Damn did it mess me up more than dose 1 &amp; 2.
9636,Still hoping it pays off.
9637,Someone else wrote that they all presented negative tests *before* they flew.
9638,That is concerning.
9639,That and the super high vax rate in Marin County (Bay Area) really surprised me.
9640,Pre-pandemic both had relatively low vaccination rates and Portland still doesn't have fluoridated tap water.
9641,They were probably doing only antigen tests before the flight but PCR tests after landing.
9642,[removed]
9643,That's 100 days until they start production?
9644,"And then if rollout goes anything like it did last time where I live, another 6 months or more till it gets in my arm."
9645,"So, more than nine months of hiding in my house, leaving only for groceries again."
9646,"And in that nine months, or anytime thereafter, the threat of yet another variant."
9647,It's so difficult to not be overcome with depression for the situation.
9648,Oh its here its just a matter of time.
9649,With the infection rate dramatically increasing I fear tgis variant is the factor.
9650,Its here and spreading rapidly more than ever before.
9651,You can only protect yourself at this point.
9652,God bless us all.
9653,Turned out that 61 of them are positive with COVID.
9654,Why is he flying?
9655,He can't make a phone call?
9656,South Africa doesn't have their own reporters?
9657,Freaking pandemic and this guy acts like he has to fly to get paperwork.
9658,What is this 1940?
9659,the tests are sent randomly to the CDC and they sequence them.
9660,They would know already.
9661,maybe it is in USA already because they certainly are acting promptly.
9662,Of course.
9663,But I don't think it's at relatively higher risk vs. other countries as was implied.
9664,"Their vaccination coverage is fairly recent and ramped up quickly, and they have a much larger percentage of people with natural immunity, which is demonstrably better than immunity conferred by vaccination."
9665,"I'd be very, very surprised if any variant were able to evade both natural and vaccinated immunity entirely."
9666,[removed]
9667,South Africa is sitting on 5 months worth of vaccine supply at their current rate of use.
9668,"They've recently asked manufacturers to slow down deliveries, because they kept receiving more than they were using."
9669,Vaccine availability around the world isn't great (but improving).
9670,But it's probably not what's behind the emergence of this variant.
9671,"It's one thing to look when crossing the street, it's another thing to live in fear."
9672,It's another thing to compromise your daily life and it's certainly another thing to allow our governments to assert a control over what we do

9705,Corona 19 plus max S?
9706,I don’t think you understand what modern conservatism is in America.
9707,It’s the opposite of what traditional American values are despite how loudly they claim with their media propaganda they’re the “real” America.

9709,Your best maybe.
9710,Might be new enough that time hasn't passed for people to start dying
9711,Yeah man!
9712,"Stay unvaccinated, it will work well for your family"
9713,"Not gonna lie, that pretty much sounds like what it's like living in the UK right now lol."
9714,One theory I have is the virus spreads through vaccinated people and we dont notice cause they dont get sick/tested.
9715,Then it eventually causes someone to get sick and we discover it.
9716,But the reality is its probably everywhere already.
9717,I have a friend whose vaccinated and got covid19 and had no idea.

9730,yet they will complain about adding to the federal deficit with the same breath.
9731,I was wondering if someone can explain.
9732,I read a Nature article about the new South African variant B.1.1.529.
9733,The article said it would be called the Nu variant.
9734,"In all the most recent reports, B.1.1.529 is being called Omicron."
9735,"Are Nu and Omicron the same, only that the official name was changed or are they different?"
9736,Just want to be clear.
9737,Thanks for any explanation in advance.
9738,"If aliens invaded, 1/3 of people would roll out the welcome mat."

9742,"I didn’t take a stance, I asked a question because I’m injecting all these things into my body as reports come out saying that they no longer will be effective."
9743,Keep laughing.
9744,"The more you laugh and talk down to people, the more they’re going to keep perfect people like you in the pandemic."
9745,Try helping people or not bullying them
9746,Yes that’s why I said they’re desperate for it.
9747,Any booster for this new variant is easily 100+ days away.
9748,There is no scenario where you are getting 3-5 booster shots per year for variants.
9749,The next few years will likely be 1-2 per year MAX.
9750,Get this booster and then expect another catch-all booster in July.
9751,"From there, future booster requirements will largely be dictated by how many people remain unvaxxed."
9752,This should be a post - nothing but doomsday posts from everyone else.
9753,I'm don't have it in me to care anymore

9755,I‘m surprised that the topic needle phobia isn‘t discussed more.
9756,"According to Wiki the prevalence is 4-10 %, my own survey with 571 respondents puts it at 7.5 % with a 95 % confidence interval from 5.5 % to 9.5 %."
9757,In Germany roughly 20 % of adults remain unvaxxed.
9758,"So a significant portion of the unvaxxed, maybe one in three, could suffer from needle phobia."
9759,We really should have therapists at vaccination centers that can assist people in the vaccination process.
9760,Maybe even provide sedatives like diazepam.
9761,I was given this for fear of flying and it helped a great deal.
9762,Seems kind of weird that there isn‘t a proper support structure in place at vaccination centers given the high prevalence.

9766,There is no evidence that this strain or any will cause hospitalizations.

9778,"xD

Lmfao, then don't get a booster if THAT is your moral line in the sand, get the virus eventually, we don't give a shit."
9779,Not flying into the Usa you have to have a negative test or a doctor note saying you had covid I'm the last 6 weeks.
9780,I flew back from Mexico last month and they were checking everybody before they got on the plane
9781,"I don’t think that it’s particularly grim yet (sounds like most of the cases so far are very mild), it’s that we don’t know enough and after 2 years, cities like New York aren’t willing to fuck around and find out what this could be."

9917,It was nearly 100% Delta prior to Omicron.
9918,"The non-Delta were C.1.2, which has been holding its own against Delta in SA at low levels for months."
9919,"The low vaccination rate is true, but SA was able to suppress Delta despite only having a 24% vaccination rate."
9920,"NY was hit hard when the thing came over from Italy, while everyone had their eyes on China and the West Coast."
9921,They're going to be more proactive after that.
9922,This was my husband’s guess too.
9923,I like it as an option as it’s colder and people inside with closed windows is more conducive.

9944,All it takes is that there were few major superspreading events locally due to precautions due to high levels of delta spread.
9945,Then people became much less careful and now coronavirus starts to spread again.
9946,The lucky virus involved in the outbreak is the first virus transmitted in the first major superspreading event.
9947,"The plausible chain is that a healthcare worker was taking care of COVID infected HIV-AIDS patients and became infected with Omicron, due to poor practices they spread that infection around to several people, Omicron got lucky and infected some socialite who then infected 50 people at one of the first of a new wave of superspreading events, 10 of whom went to other events later in the week."
9948,"It sounds somewhat unlikely but this how all the variants have arisen, through luck."
9949,Event delta wouldn't have been able to outcompete all the prior variants without some luck on its side somewhere.
9950,The dominant variant always has the advantage of the most likely variant to be selected in any given superspreading event.
9951,So how did delta take over the first area where it made itself a foothold in the human population?
9952,"Given enough time delta's competitive advantage makes it more successful and it blows on the dice, but it had to overcome being outnumbered 100:1 at first as well and just get lucky."

9978,"I'm originally from the UK but currently live in Amsterdam (really not looking forward to my flight back home now) and they accept the rapid one or PCR but most airports have a rapid test station set up so you can take it there and get your results back in around 15 minutes, allowing you to fly"
9979,But not so unreliable that they'd miss 61/61 infections.
9980,Something about this is still very weird.
9981,"Because it’s not true, at all."
9982,"That's true with Delta, but they're saying Omicron evades antibodies, which is what the booster restores."
9983,Wouldn't that mean we're pretty much at the same risk as with Delta pre-booster?
9984,"Would you be ok with people who are carrying the HIV Virus to not disclose it to their sexual contacts, while insisting to have sex without a condom, because no one can force them to wear a condom or tell them what to say?"
9985,"The other person can still refuse to have sex without a condom, just as people  can refuse to serve, fly, drive, teach, or interact in any other form with people who are not vaccinated against Corona."
9986,That's their body autonomy.

9998,"You can be mad at peoples going on holiday, ok."

10011,"This all seems to have happened very very suddenly though, so we’ll probably start to notice it popping up this week."
10012,&gt; but it's still not clear if it escapes vaccine protection or leads to more severe disease.
10013,Did you read the article which contains the comments of the medical professional in the one country where that variant is prevalent?
10014,Don’t know why these science ignorant people are downvoting you but it’s true everyone will eventually get covid.
10015,Only get vaccinated to protect yourself.
10016,Since the vaccinated can get infected and spread the virus just like the unvaccinated.
10017,I know because I got covid 3 months after full vaccination.
10018,I hope you’re right
10019,Why not Omega?
10020,Oh I didn’t see anything about medical professional tests in the article and there are rapid tests that can be performed at home.
10021,"🤷🏻‍♀️ Rapid tests are definitely not as accurate as PCR, but it sounds like what is given at their destination is also rapid tests."
10022,But it’s not just the media leaping onto this.
10023,"It was declared a variant of concern REMARKABLY fast, the WHO, scientists, doctors, virologists, governments, all are concerned."
10024,"It’s not the media who declared it a major concern, nor is it the media who implemented travel restrictions."
10025,"This is the first time I’ve heard experts NOT downplaying the seriousness of a variant, and the fastest they’ve jumped on it."
10026,I wish I could have the same mentality because I’m really scared and I want you agree with you so badly
10027,The shelves were empty because certain products saw a 500-1000% increase in daily demand.
10028,They were empty because people drove round from shop to shop buying the buy limits of shit they didn't need so they could ensure they were OK at the expense of everyone else in their community.
10029,"You should have seen all the bins local to me during the pandemic, EVERY WEEK people were throwing out 10+ loaves of bread per household, rotten fruit by the kilo, etc etc."
10030,"JIT will always struggle with an increase in demand, but this wasn't just ""people doubling up and halving the frequency of their shops"", this was people deciding that they came before everyone else and ensuring they had theirs and then some only to throw a ton of it away because they bought magnitudes more than they needed."
10031,We could have doubled the volume of deliveries and all that would happen is those same people would buy it all and throw it out 2 weeks later having not fucking used it.
10032,"Maybe I’m just old, but this situation looks like those tests were taken in a way that would maximize their chance of a negative result."
10033,Could have been infected at an airport.

10037,No.
10038,The vaccine effectiveness wanes over time.
10039,The booster recharges it.
10040,Apparently at about 6 months a booster will restore your protection to where I was after the second shot.
10041,&gt;	I really don’t like how this is giving me ‘start of the pandemic’ vibes from last year.

10044,It's literally days away.
10045,It's in Europe already.
10046,Overselling the side effects there?
10047,"There aren't lots of side effects, side effects are extremely rare."
10048,And I agree with you I've probably had more than 10 vaccines in my whole life.
10049,Why wouldn't I want them?
10050,"Flu, MMR, smallpox, covid... And numerous others."
10051,"Sounds like there’s a market for fake test certificates, because otherwise this variant royally sucks and I’ll have none of it."
10052,"Airplanes cycle the air rather quickly, though if that means more or less infection I really can't say."
10053,Just that they cycle the air several times per hour.
10054,Those tests are inaccurate as fuck.
10055,"Despite manufacturer claims of a high sensitivity the actual sensitivity is a mere 42,6%."
10056,Meaning more than half of infected persons tested fly under the radar.
10057,This has been known since July 2021.
10058,But of course our gvts could not be bothered to inconvenience a loud minority.

10060,It's a crazy high number indeed.
10061,What might be part of the explanation is that cases are record high at the moment in the Netherlands.
10062,Last week 1 in 100 people tested positive if they have been tested.
10063,A lot of people don't test when they have sympthoms and people might be asympthomatic.
10064,Those are not the 1 one 100 stat.
10065,This with the given that people might still test positive with PCR after eight weeks might partially explain the high number.
10066,What do you want to know?
10067,That we have a black death kind of pandemic watching us in the dark and waiting until we mess up too much?

10077,How the fuck does one plane have space for 600 people?
10078,"As someone heavily in the markets, that's false."
10079,The reaction to Delta was not anywhere close initially or at any point to the violent and dramatic reaction we saw just now to Omicron.
10080,The Omnicorn reaction Friday was textbook the reaction to the initial virus.
10081,Whether it will continue forward is anyone's guess.

10087,How would you test it?
10088,Lab tests and computer simulations only get you so far.
10089,"Some variants of SARS-CoV-2 were expected to be quite bad based on their mutations, but ended up not causing too much trouble."
10090,"On the other hand, Delta seemed to not have that many problematic mutations but ended up wrecking many countries."
10091,"The only way to accurately verify that a modified version of the virus has the desired properties is to test it on humans, which is incredibly risky and a bottomless pit of medical ethics concerns."
10092,Why not get 10 more shots while you're at it?
10093,"""Nothing to lose""?"
10094,Lots of side effects from the boosters (heart issues) and that's from someone who's gotten 2 already.
10095,Yep this realisticly will last to 2024/2025
10096,Funny since I've heard anecdotally the opposite on these very boards that the 3rd booster is the worst by far.
10097,And I had an awful experience with the 2nd one.
10098,"You’re gonna leave an Australian summer for a cold and dreary UK December, 21 hours on a plane there and back, just to be there for only two weeks, in the midst of a new variant, during an existing pandemic ??"

10111,"Hopefully, it doesn't get to that point again."
10112,States have one more year people aren’t gonna wear masks forever states can forget it
10113,I'm sure that was Unicron.
10114,We don’t have enough data yet to make that conclusion.
10115,So far with the limited data we do have Omnicron has a R value of &lt;2.
10116,Delta has a R value between 2 and 3.
10117,Omincron has 30 mutations on its spike protein.
10118,It remains to be seen how exactly Omnicron will be.

10121,The booster is only half the dose of the original shot.
10122,I wonder why unvaccinated are even allowed on airplanes.
10123,Have not seen my gf in over 2 years.
10124,I am fully vaxxed so why should I not travel?
10125,I am sure there are millions in the same position.
10126,What about the T-Virus ?
10127,🧟‍♂️
10128,Realisticly it’s gonna last to 2024
10129,Yes in June cases of covid were the lowest ever and within 6-8 weeks delta ruined that.
10130,But cases fell off by October so will see what this VOC does.
10131,I don't think it's an all or nothing issue.
10132,Delta has already reduced vaccine efficacy a little.
10133,"5 months after vaccination, efficacy declines even more."
10134,Omicron is bound to decrease efficacy further.
10135,"Thus, if you get infected with Omicron 5 months after vaccination, your immunity is bound to be very low."
10136,"Rather than wait another 6 or 12 months for an updated Moderna booster, it's better to boost now to increase your immunity."
10137,The booster reportedly increases antibodies substantially.
10138,I will certainly get a booster as soon as I'm eligible in a month time.
10139,That would be kinda cool though
10140,Except people are a lot less willing to follow the rules  now.
10141,"Maybr with a new variant that will change, but I'm not very hopeful."
10142,"and the temp workers come from an agency, owned by whom?"
10143,What about if you got covid after being vaccinated.
10144,Won't they at least require a quarantine?
10145,I try to keep stocked up on canned food.
10146,If I got to quarantine ( which I have done once per year so far due to what ended up being viral infections ) I want to have a variety of enjoyable foods.
10147,Canned foods are fantastic for ease of use.
10148,"Omicron is a small o, as in lock, or bog."

10158,Hundreds of passengers arriving in Amsterdam from South Africa were tested for the new variant.
10159,Some 61 people on two KLM flights tested positive and have been quarantined.

10161,"Or they’re testing themselves, where user error would definitely come into play."
10162,"If the incubation period is a week, you wouldn’t have caught it from other passengers  and have it should up on a test in 24 hrs"
10163,61 people were tested positive with a pcr test after the flight.
10164,Everyone over 13 years old was in need of a negative rapid-test before entering the flight according to [KLM's travel restrictions](https://www.klm.com/travel/za_en/prepare_for_travel/up_to_date/travel_restrictions.htm).

10193,They actually really missed the reference….
10194,"Indeed, that's generally what happened here in NL."
10195,But now the closing time is 5pm and that's enough to stop people going at all.
10196,Our previous 12am closing time did stop me from going to a few events that required travel time so it had some impact but not enough.
10197,The ignorant minority of people refusing the vaccine (even though they can obtain it) is also a small minority compared to people in developing countries who don’t even have access to the vaccine.
10198,"So even if we can get American/European “antivaxxers” on board, we’re still fucked from mutations happening in poor countries with no vaccine access."

10205,If you seeing your parents is worth the risk of spreading a deadly disease go ahead.

10215,"While possible, the other factor is that with high baseline Delta infections, it will take at least 4+ weeks for a new variant to make waves that are notable in charts."
10216,USA has daily new cases of 75k per day.
10217,Say 10 infected people land in USA.
10218,"With R 10 (high estimate)
100 in week 2
1000 in week 3
10000 in week 4 

This is if the virus has that super high R number even in vaccinated and or immune populations… all while competing with Delta that is still out there infecting people."
10219,The R for Delta is closer to 3 so that would mean it takes 2 months for the variant to pop up in charts.
10220,"So this could be spreading like wildfire, but due to the underlying epidemic we might not notice it in epidemiological data really until it’s way too late."
10221,That’s why the sequencing and genomic data is much more important signals this early in the variant.
10222,"But we might see some real effects of this by Christmas, hitting with big time exponential growth then if the worst case scenarios come true."
10223,"According to a lot of the epidemiologists I follow on Twitter, all flight bans do at this stage is make countries that are banned less likely to come forward with suspected new variants."

10242,No?
10243,Just us in South Africa then?
10244,Except these houses breed fast and don't need a second one.
10245,The mistake was opening travel without extensive monitoring and quarantine.
10246,"With the variant already found in multiple cou tries, banning flights from one cou try is, overall, meaningless."
10247,"Smart countries would shut down non-essential travel, enforce quarantines on incoming people, and initiate a robust surveillance program to search for the variant."

10250,"If we are going to count how many people got COVID after vaccination, we are never going to move on."
10251,All I want to know is how serious it was.
10252,Did they get sniffles or ended up on a ventilator?
10253,The only promise of vaccines was that COVID was going to be turned into a regular annual flu nuisance.
10254,"I took the vaccine, and I never turned green."
10255,"Some people were saying that the test didn't work because 61 people had Covid, 61 tested negative and the conclusion is that the test failed 100%."
10256,The rest of us are just pointing out that we don't know how many positive tests there were because they weren't on the flight.
10257,We know it’s dangerous because of its ability to mutate quickly and because it transmits so easily.
10258,"What we don’t know, per articles online right now, is whether it can evade the vaccine."
10259,"From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-vaccines.html):

&gt; The researchers found more than 30 mutations on a protein, called spike, on the surface of the coronavirus."
10260,The spike protein is the chief target of antibodies that the immune system produces to fight a Covid-19 infection.
10261,**So many mutations raised concerns that Omicron’s spike might be able to evade antibodies produced by either a previous infection or a vaccine.
10262,**
10263,Wouldn't It make sense that the reason Omicron is spreading so fast is because it bypasses vaccines?
10264,What could possibly make the new strain exponentially more infectious than Delta.
10265,Only logical conclusion is that it bypasses vaccine effectiveness and spreads as fast the original covid strain as if no one was vaccinated.
10266,Thank you for your response.
10267,I’m definitely going to check with my doctor before getting the booster.
10268,I’d pick 1999 if I had a time machine.

10355,"airplane cabins are well ventilated during flight, but that is still disturbing."
10356,Agreed you honestly couldn't make this stuff up...if I was watching a movie based on this last year before any of this happened I would be thinking yeah right as if!
10357,Because business has to go on.
10358,Any nearly the ones ones that die are anti vaxxers.
10359,So they are free to take their chances and the rest of us can motor on.
10360,If this variant starts showing total breakthrough and 10% morbidity or higher then we might see total global lockdown again.
10361,I'm surprised that many people don't seem to understand this
10362,&gt; At least those of us in heavily vaccinated areas.
10363,So like in 1% of the world...
10364,Yeah.
10365,Not sure what to say to them.
10366,"They have my sympathy, but what, are people supposed to just travel from all over to go there so their tourism economy stays afloat?"
10367,"Great, can we now stop n those stupid travel restrictions?"
10368,"They don't help, the variant is here already."
10369,Depends on where testing is happening the most
10370,My wife had to laugh loud in the store today as she noticed the empty toilet paper shelves already.
10371,lol
10372,"Except there is no evidence that any of the countries on the ban list are “hotspots”, or even that they are the point of origin."
10373,"Likewise there is no evidence Omicron is capable of jumping current vaccines, or that it is any worse than any other strain despite the 24hr of panic we just witnessed."
10374,"South Africa was the first to identify Omicron because they have a very robust infectious disease research program (mostly because of HIV being such an issue there), but the strain didn’t necessarily emerge there."
10375,Omicron appears to already be global.
10376,Best thing to do is robust testing for international travel and hope that the vaccines do their job.
10377,For Covid or positive for Omicron specifically?
10378,An abundance of caution.
10379,Some might say an overabundance
10380,Even the lab created super mutations had vaccine responses
10381,The dark ages didnt end for some ppl lol

10384,I flew from SA to the US two days ago and a negative pcr was required to check into the flight and get a boarding pass.
10385,How did so many people get a false negative?
10386,Or did they fake the test?
10387,&gt;  Probably even high enough to be infectious.
10388,You've just described the purpose of a rapid test.
10389,No.
10390,With all due respect you are being incredibly obtuse and disrespectful to all the people out there who are going through immense suffering and loss which you are now happily minimizing and glossing over.
10391,That’s all I’m going to say on the matter because your comments are infuriating.
10392,"The new variant has 30 mutations to the spike protein, that’s the main thing that’s causing all the alarm."
10393,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03552-w
10394,"dumb question, but why is it not epsilon instead of omicron?"
10395,COVID was likely the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich in recent history.
10396,(maybe except for '08).
10397,"After seeing how many small business failed during the first year, it's insane to me that people are still advocating for the return of lockdowns."
10398,"Get vaccinated, wear your masks, and cross your fingers."
10399,at risk people should weigh the pros and cons and decide for themselves what they want to do.
10400,But telling vaccinated people they need to now stay at home like some countries in EU are doing is mind blowing.
10401,"If you can test positive, you're contagious."
10402,Haha I always thought it was “I miss the rains down in Africa”.
10403,Derp.
10404,Do all states do sequencing?
10405,This is really a question best answered by a doctor.
10406,"*Your* doctor, if possible."
10407,[removed]
10408,That really isn't a large amount when we're looking at global statistics.
10409,There’s no winning or convincing permanent maskers like this.
10410,They will mask forever and shame people who don’t wear N100 masks when alone in a park.
10411,I believe it is a letter in the Greek alphabet.
10412,"The good news is, in the US at least for a long time, if you wear a mask, folks won't really think twice about it."
10413,"Before covid, if you wore a mask, totally different."
10414,"I will continue to wear a mask on planes, busses and other places where I am exposed to folks in tight quarters."

10416,send it back i beg you
10417,Lmao I am literally reading what you posted.
10418,"You said the only reason to travel is for “growing children.” Dying parents, spouses, etc will suffice with a zoom call."
10419,"You can continue acting like the moral police when it comes to peoples reasons for travel, some of us don’t have the luxury to lock ourselves at home and wait for all of this to disappear."
10420,Fighting COVID is public health.
10421,Alvaro Obregon.
10422,🇲🇽
10423,He is not a virologist or an epidemiologist.
10424,*over* 100%?
10425,"You've obviously blanked out when the UK was banned last year, lol."
10426,We were the original plague island.
10427,"It does not magically make it more valid, it makes it more valid because... they don't understand and so are more harmed."
10428,"Thus, the quarantine."
10429,That’s just bad presentation of the data.
10430,Expand the area and recalculate instead of manipulating for a sensational headline.
10431,Alvaro Obregón
10432,Yup.
10433,If it’s in the UK there is a high probability it is already in the US too.
10434,You're on the right track.
10435,Any point in the viral RNA can mutate.
10436,Sometimes this doesn't impact anything at all sometimes it makes the virus less deadly or less infectious.
10437,Those might go undetected or just quickly be crossed off as a strain of interest.
10438,The issue is the ones that affect certain regions of the virus.
10439,"For example, of they affect the site that our antibodies bind to the virus but NOT how the virus us."
10440,"Those are these strains that could ""beat"" the vaccine."
10441,"[The WHO has a site ](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) listing current strains of concern (alpha, delta, omega) and interest (lambda, mu), as well as some that don't have the Greek letter name yet that they're monitoring (think like an early monitoring system."
10442,We know these strains are there but not if they're any better or worse).
10443,[removed]
10444,"No, deaths are actually a little less than this time last year."
10445,"Current 7-day average is 253, last year it was 301."
10446,The peak was 907 on the 10th January 2021.
10447,"Since the number of daily cases is triple to last year, the death rate has been reduced to a third of what it was."
10448,"That said, this still needs to be taken seriously and too many lives are going to be lost if action is not taken."
10449,We NEED to go into another national lockdown.
10450,New York.
10451,They have better medical infrastructure and NYC is a major travel hub.
10452,"Also the early symptoms may be not there, so.. a later detection"
10453,"Do you realise ""instituional trader"" means worked for a bank whos job it was to monitor these things."
10454,I wouldn’t go back to February 2020 for literally all the money in the world.
10455,You do realise the UK sequences a lot right?
10456,The idea that its been circulating in the UK and no one realised till a couple of weeks after South Africa sequenced it is bizarre to say the least.
10457,[removed]
10458,"Its almost like you missed the part when the ""Kent"" variant had almost every country banning travel from the UK."
10459,I’m guessing you’ve not yet lost a parent?
10460,"Because I have, and my biggest regret is that I didn’t get to see them one more time, give them one more hug, share one more meal with them, etc."
10461,and this was PRE COVID.
10462,One day and that South African travel ban is already useless.
10463,This is probably already spreading like wildfire in the EU right now.
10464,Yes!
10465,"We installed one a couple years ago, before the pandemic."
10466,They’re great for cleaning.
10467,Americans really should get over the idea that bidets are weird.
10468,You can install on any regular toilet.
10469,Search on “bidet attachment for toilet”.
10470,And then the people who did not test positive were allowed to continue on with their trips.
10471,"After sitting in the plane with the infected passengers, maybe not wearing masks, on the tarmac for 4 hours."
10472,"If it wasn't out before, it is now."
10473,Data protection laws are weird in Germany.
10474,"On the one hand there is no health database, on the other hand Germay is actively trying to enforce chat surveillance and some politicans are even pushing for mandatory registration in online forums with your full name."
10475,The EU artists to be a joke the more I hear about it.
10476,Quarantine now isn't going to effect what had already passed through the border.
10477,But it would reduce risks of the next variant if we kept it in place.
10478,"Since covid isn't long lived on surfaces, only Pele need to be Quarantined, thus God's can travel fairly easily with proper planning."
10479,Do you have any proof to substantiate that claim?
10480,"Because I've heard stuff like that happening during the delta wave too, again without any evidence."
10481,Just bought come new KN95 masks when I read this.
10482,This is going to be never-ending.
10483,*That* is the same argument being peddled in Florida as a reason not to wear masks.
10484,[removed]
10485,It’s got to be everywhere by now.
10486,NY
10487,Because if you’re vaccinated then you have little to worry about.
10488,COVID is not going away anytime soon; a lot of folks are ready to move on.
10489,The unvaccinated can live with (or die from) the consequences of their choices.
10490,"Get a vaccine, wear a mask when needed, and live your life."
10491,The large number of mutations suggest that it originated in someone with a comprised immune system who was unable to clear the infection.
10492,Therefore the virus had time within the body to adapt and mutate.
10493,"It's not all about lots of people getting it, it's about how long the infection lasts in someone too."
10494,Sadly there is a higher incidence of HIV in Africa.
10495,[removed]
10496,"Sorry, I was only referring to breakthrough cases."
10497,Should have been more clear.
10498,1.
10499,The study has yet to be peer reviewed.
10500,2.
10501,This only occurred if the person was infected within the previous 6 months only.
10502,Past that the correlation was not as strong.
10503,3.
10504,Previous immunity + vaccine dose is best.
10505,“They don’t understand” does not magically make travelling to see them more valid.
10506,They can get interactivity elsewhere without any travel being involved.
10507,"If you’re going to be against travel then you need to be against travel for everyone, not everyone except people with young children because they’re super special."
10508,"Individually, both heart disease and cancer are still killing people at about double the rate of corona."
10509,Where’s the cheese burger vaccine?
10510, Thank you for the information.
10511,Wow do I feel dumb now for not finding that myself.
10512,How I did not think to check the CDC website is embarrassing.
10513,I will blame it on lack of sleep.
10514,Thanks so much!
10515,"It would be a very good thing, that’s best case scenario and what I’ve got my fingers crossed for."
10516,Luckily though it’s looking like vaccines will still be effective regardless.
10517,I mean that in and of itself is theoretically a good thing.
10518,"Natural selection tends to send viruses down a “more contagious, less virulent” path."
10519,The more mutations the further along that path it would have traveled.
10520,"Sure, anything is possible but a large number of mutations in and of itself is meaningless."
10521,I’m just going to say it.
10522,This thread doesn’t pass the vibe chat.
10523,I miss when it was just folks taking the virus seriously in Jan and Feb 2020.
10524,[Think about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tknR5AGh-uU)
10525,"The high number of mutations that we have studied and know to be impactful, the high number of mutations that we haven't studied but appear to likely be non-coincidental (why are there 3 mutations within 5 adjacent amino acids..?)"
10526,And the rapid spread in Gauteng.
10527,No data on hospitalization risk or anything like that though.
10528,LET'S GO
10529,Exactly.
10530,"*Never* say the ""L"" word."
10531,"Why not try ""Rollback"", as was planned on in the very beginning?"
10532,It refers to *reducing* public gathering in enclosed areas.
10533,And p.s.
10534,": the average American citizen will not want this either, unless there is visibility here: *massive* visibility."
10535,Every grocery store needs to distribute a pamphlet with the groceries about it.
10536,Tents in front of the entrance with medical personnel or at least trained tracers to talk about transmission and prevention.
10537,"Posters on public transportation, in Ubers and Lyfts, in laundromats, etc."
10538,Mail campaigns with postcards.
10539,It's got to be massively advertised.
10540,Got both shots in 2020 and a booster a month ago.
10541,I feel like this is going to turn into an annual shot much like the flu vaccine.
10542,"Not to be misinterpreted as a “but Covid is just like the flu!” comment, just that I think Covid is never fully going away, and the vaccine will become a regular part of our lives."
10543,"Huh, I wonder if my vaccination, literally got my second shot this Thursday, will help against this."
10544,Not that I would mind another shot.
10545,"Ah shit, here we go again..."
10546,"Idk why you think, the guy with *gasp* 6 whole years of experience thinks he is the only person with knowledge."
10547,Maybe you’re just wrong lol
10548,the truth is so far we know nothing about it and IMO the media is jumping on this as the next big thing to scare people about.
10549,but from what I understand the mutation came about by being in someone who also had AIDS so it's like some weird mix.
10550,"this is at least what people are thinking because again, we don't know anything about it."
10551,"Whether they do or not, it does at least seem to be an almost cartoon-villain level of cruel indifference towards those around them."
10552,"Like fine, surrender to the possibility of getting sick themselves if they want -- but in this situation, with the sure and certain knowledge of the risk, could they truly not just exercise this one miniscule crumb of consideration?"
10553,The reporter frames it as a human failure and I can't really disagree.
10554,"Only anecdotal I admit, but I had to pass through this same airport a month ago and it was just wall-to-wall maskless people without any apparent care in the world."
10555,One of the only guys I saw wearing a mask actually... pulled it down so he could cough more comfortably.
10556,The Belgian one was symptomatic but was unvaccinated
10557,They had 61 out of 600 positive for Corona on the flights back to the Netherlands.
10558,I mean wtf?
10559,"If some of them have this new variant, it probably is already everywhere."

10579,What a bizarre reach
10580,"He’s excellent, the science is good."
10581,He explains why this new variant is 500% more competitive.
10582,[that'd be one way to go about it](https://i.imgflip.com/3kzeqx.jpg)
10583,"The EU isn't one country and doesn't have that power, those sit with national governments."
10584,"As others have said, quarantines are an ineffective tool and just security theatre at this point, the variants are already here and spreading and would be regardless of an airport quarantine (the EU is too big and porous for that to actually work, how do you stop the cross border trade in Ireland, Dover, Turkey or Morocco, a quarantine of that level would consign Ireland and the UK to the worst food shortage since WW2?)"
10585,But the point is that right now we do not even know what locations currently have the highest prevalence of Omicron because we’ve only been looking for it for a day and a half.
10586,At this point it could well be more common in the Netherlands than South Africa (for example).
10587,Flight bans like this are purely theater.
10588,"We know, for example, that there have been multiple cases in Israel, at least one in Hong Kong."
10589,Where are the flight bans for those countries to help slow the spread…
10590,Rapid tests are inaccurate.

10596,Stop spamming your shitty meme in every post
10597,It’s weird that the reporter calls it an unventilated room.
10598,The airplane’s hvac system with hepa filters should have been operating the entire time.
10599,Whether you are in the air or on the tarmac.
10600,Depending on the aircraft it would also be adding fresh outside air and supplementing with O2 as needed.
10601,The Boeing 717 was one of the first that I am aware of to pull in outside air.
10602,I expect most planes made in the last 20 years do that as well.
10603,I have been a frequent flier for 23 years.
10604,Usually over 100 flights per year.
10605,The only time I was stuck in a plane where the hvac system wasn’t functioning was on a 757 that had a defective auxiliary power system.
10606,"When the engines had to be turned off, while we sat waiting for weather to clear, they had to open the cabin doors to let fresh air in."
10607,"Outside of a system failure, the air should be cleaner than it was in the gate area before boarding."
10608,"Just doesn’t help much if the person directly in front/behind/next to you is infected, but it should prevent the entire plane from being infected."
10609,Growing children are less likely to understand the person in the glowing box is their mom.
10610,Especially younger children.
10611,"Growing children need interactivity, especially from parent figures and peers."
10612,Even things like bugs are Vitaly important to children's mental and physical health as they grow up.
10613,"While physical contact is important for adults, it is less vital to their wellbeing and adults can rationalize better."
10614,"They understand that their grown children can't hug them, but that they are present via the phone."
10615,"Either way, I suggest a 2 week quarantine for any travel, and allow the travelers to determine if they have a legitimate need to endure a month of quarantine (2 weeks; on each side)"
10616,Ok great hobby moderator...and bc keeping the discussion pure you keep responding.
10617,Theres no need for further talks about this.
10618,LMAO yes this is true.
10619,The past few years have shown me the bar for game changing in the US is so fucking high
10620,"&gt;	I’d love to go on about how the developed world needs to underwrite the vaccination and medical needs of the developing world, but if the halfassed response of the developed world has shown us anything, it’s that we aren’t even handling our own needs."
10621,"Yeah, this isn’t the developed world’s fault and it isn’t a ‘developed vs developing’ world issue."
10622,"South Africa has more than enough vaccines but the government has been weak to convince citizens to take it, and many citizens themselves are antivax resulting in a dismal 24% vaccination rate."
10623,"On the contrary, India, which is way less developed than South Africa, has 75% of its population inoculated with at least one dose."
10624,What can the developed world do if governments and citizens don’t take it seriously?
10625,"That’s on them, not on the US or on the EU."
10626,[removed]
10627,Lol we know why Xi wasnt used
10628,It’s the one that became dominant variant in two weeks.
10629,It took Delta 3 months to become the dominant variant levels seen in omicron.
10630,Where is this early data?
10631,Was that comment buzz lightyear cause that shit went to infinity and beyond your understanding
10632,It's easy to be contrary.
10633,Praying for you.
10634,Hope you feel better 🙏
10635,It's already in Bavaria.
10636,I have no idea why it shouldn't be already in the USA.
10637,You’ve provided no actual data sets for your assertions.
10638,Or sources.
10639,Amazing how all your supposedly vaccinated friends are beating the odds and getting knocked down.
10640,And yet you mention no unvaccinated.
10641,Put up data sets.
10642,[removed]
10643,Slamming down a total travel ban on eight countries and isolating them from the world before *any* hard data is out could very well end up doing more harm than good.
10644,Travel bans are crap.
10645,This stupid thing is everywhere already.
10646,Would probably help to properly check the certificates when entering restaurants/cinema/events.
10647,"I only had to show my ID once, but my QR code wasn't scanned ever..."
10648,It seems to be very rare.
10649,Some restaurants only ask if you have a certificate but don't even want so see it.
10650,I don't understand why this isn't checked more thoroughly.
10651,So of course some people will find it appealing to fake their certificate or use one of someone else.
10652,"It won't be properly checked anyway, so why not try it."
10653,:( very sad.
10654,And here we both sit on Reddit wondering wtf went wrong
10655,Media is so happy new variant emerged so they can scare people.
10656,That annoying people advocating for permanent lockdown and measures are also very happy.
10657,yeah.
10658,Everything closes after 5pm.
10659,"This means that you can go to the gym from 7am to 5pm, but in the evening it is not allowed."
10660,"What is this 😂  


What we see here is that there are busses going to Germany to party there."
10661,The clubs in Germany are still opened and the Dutchies go there.
10662,Also for dinner etc.
10663,[removed]
10664,Schools gonna be fun next week
10665,"Isn't it a little early for hospitalizations to have increased, though?"
10666,You usually see that weeks later.
10667,Just as I thought it safe to start traveling again…
10668,I'm glad you clarified but I was secretly hoping you were logging in from Mars.
10669,Most people that smoke don’t get lung cancer.
10670,Many do.
10671,How else would you know if you’re alive
10672,"Meh, let them."
10673,What makes me laugh is they run to get tested when they get sick and agree to hospitalisation instead of sticking to their guns and taking livestock medication at home.
10674,"This aired on CNBC at approximately 5:20am yesterday, November 26, 2021."
10675,"The variant was, as yet, unnamed."
10676,I watched this live and am grateful that CNBC put the video up on their website.
10677,"Pasi Pentinnen remarks that early data suggests Omicron evades immunity from vaccines, prior infection, and even monoclonal antibodies."
10678,"With the news landscape filled with competing views of Omicron, it’s my belief that Mr. Pentinnen is speaking honestly and certainly frankly."

10714,I don’t understand.
10715,Why are people assuming that this new variant will be worse than delta?
10716,The economy will get a big hit with a full lockdown.

10718,Also amateur (team) sports aren't allowed after 17:00.

10728,I feel so lost right now.
10729,It is important to remember that none of the Covid vaccines is 100% efficient.
10730,If you have one that is 90% efficient then if you meet 10 infected persons without other preventative measures then you are likely to catch it.

10800,"Did you not see the part where I said “**BEFORE COVID**, vaccines were not a lucrative business unit in pharma.” Infectious diseases have never been."
10801,Why?
10802,"Antibiotics (cheap) and vaccines (cheap, preventative) are what typically cure infectious disease and they simply aren’t money-makers."
10803,"They yield some profit, but they aren’t enormous like with cancer drugs, heart disease, pain meds, etc."
10804,Switzerland is the global headquarters for many huge pharma companies and they weren’t interested in making vaccines (when covid first hit) bc they **traditionally** aren’t very profitable.
10805,OBVIOUSLY companies are in business for profit.
10806,Here is an article you didn’t read before explaining this.
10807,Pharma companies were quick to jump on developing things like home-test kits (=profit) but they weren’t starting their vaccine departments back up bc vaccines don’t usually make long-term profit.
10808,"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/covid-19_with-no-prospects-for-profits--big-pharma-turns-back-on-new-infectious-diseases/45598436

10811,Just shows how polar your echo-chamber is.
10812,Waste lol
10813,Its not 100% clear when new variants come into play.
10814,"The vaccine induced antibodies only focus the spike protein, but natural immunity likely targets a broader range of features."
10815,"So, if the spike protein changes, it may not just be about the quantity of SARS COV 2 antibodies but also their quality (&amp;diversity)."
10816,Remains to be seen.

10835,"For an airborne virus like this one, good filtration is key."
10836,"Of course, it isn’t fullproof and I’m sure plenty of people have acquired Covid while flying."
10837,Two close friends - COVID ICU nurse and ER head resident- tell me there's no rhyme or reason to who gets heavy responses based on the experience of colleagues (because COVID patients are notorious liars and most have no experience with vaccine response or they wouldn't be there).

10861,We have to stop giving a shit about personal uncomfortableness.
10862,We’re past that.
10863,"We have to finally, finally make some tough ass decisions and fucking stick to them."
10864,"Hmm no i did my part for almost 2 years now, i traveled back to my home country all summer and see all my family, now my parents are coming to visit for xmas, we re all fully vaxed,  booster shot within the next week and  children soon to be fully vaxed."
10865,"We re done, we did our part, screw that."
10866,Ok - so those people can be more cautious.
10867,The vast majority of the population who aren’t at elevated risk shouldn’t have to bend over backwards.
10868,"Fwiw, my 90 year old grandmother is boostered - my family decided at this point with this protection, her getting to see her family and taking a tiny risk is better than continually cloistering her."
10869,What is the endgame here?
10870,The vaccine is widely available.
10871,You can’t move the goalposts again.
10872,2 weeks was the number the news outlets were spouting that Pfizer planned to know if they needed to “tweak” their vaccine.
10873,"That, and that it could be done and ready in 3 months if needed."
10874,"All just reporting, no hard data I’ve seen yet."
10875,Viral load also has a huge amount to do with it.
10876,"In things like norovirus, the virus can still spread for weeks after a person has recovered but like a vhs tape thats been copied over and over, its likely that it will degrade over time."
10877,I think it's important to remember that the spike protein has a limit on how many mutation it can have before it's unable to interact with host cells.
10878,"If it mutates to the point that it can't interact with human cells, it can't cause human infection."
10879,"The vaccines may be less effective, but I can't imagine a scenario like March 2020."
10880,"That is, unless you're unvaccinnated."
10881,Very few formal mandates are in place right now.
10882,"Those that are (federal government, state/city governments, military, some airlines) have largely worked with compliance usually 95%+, sometimes close to 99%."
10883,The only way we got other vaccines to near 100% was school related mandates and time.
10884,Mandates only are realistically enforceable when it’s a long term relationship that can do a deep check and has value to both sides.
10885,"This means schools, jobs, maybe certain government services."
10886,Travel is the one outlier where they could also enforce.
10887,"That's a pretty hands-off job imo, should be ok."

10890,"Of course but adding those people and surrounding area in actually makes Vancouver even less dense than 5,500 ppl per square kilometer."
10891,So that actually makes my point that Paris is not at all like Vancouver even stronger.
10892,The poster i replied to was saying essentially this is how it is in Canada so I know what they should do in France.
10893,Vancouver is the most dense city in Canada id we only look inside city limits.
10894,If we widen that scope it actually decreases.
10895,"That promise was made retrospectively, long after they were marketed as a silver bullet that would guarantee a return to normal."
10896,"Infections among the vaccinated are still important because, since the emergence of delta, scientists and politicians alike have been gaslighting the public into thinking that getting vaccinated is the only responsible choice as it stops the spread."
10897,"In reality, there's plenty of vaccinated individuals with asymptomatic or mild infections that are inadvertently contributing to the prolongation of the pandemic."
10898,"I understand that some vaccines do not confer sterilizing immunity, but not everyone doubles as a doctor in their free time."
10899,"Even if this was common knowledge in scientific circles, it wasn't explicitly stated to the public from the very beginning."
10900,"This also casts reasonable doubt on the necessity of vaccine mandates, but that's another story for another day."
10901,I think it's important to hold authorities accountable for their lack of transparency and for putting political and financial interests ahead of public safety.
10902,"The earth isn't flat, but this whole affair could've been a lot cleaner imo."
10903,"There are several scientific papers that followed COVID cases in patients with weak immune systems due to various cancers, HIV, etc."
10904,It could also be from an organ transplant patient.
10905,Those cases can last for months.
10906,These papers frequently show large numbers of mutations like this in one patient.
10907,An HIV patient origin is suspected because that’s probably the most common cause of weak immune systems in southern Africa.
10908,This is exactly what Ive been saying!!
10909,Thank you!
10910,"Its not the variant that scares me, it's all these government reactions to it."
10911,"If all they said in the news is, theres a new variant of concern and here is where it is and what we are doing, id be nervous but not freaked out."
10912,They only found this variant tuesday.
10913,Flights and borders are being closed.
10914,Emergency meeting at who.
10915,Pfizer saying they are working on a vaccine or tweaking this one.
10916,Like I feel they know more than they are telling us.
10917,This has never been the reaction during these waves.
10918,Its always disjointed and late.
10919,This time they find it and are shutting things down.
10920,"And look good, I'm happy they are taking it seriously."
10921,But now after a year and a half we are proactive and aggresive?
10922,Idk my dad says the goverments and health organizations are only worried because of what happened with delta.
10923,So they are acting faster and more aggressively.
10924,"Idk what to think, I'm just waiting for more time to pass and info to come out."
10925,Pretty soon they’ll change it to 4.
10926,Then 5.
10927,Then 6.
10928,Then 7.
10929,Then 8.
10930,Then 9.
10931,Then 10.
10932,Then 11.
10933,"I think the government should pay everyone monthly regardless of the pandemic, so yeah, especially now they should help people survive financially to curb a virus that otherwise will continue to run amuck on our planet."
10934,What happened to hotel quarantine and Howard Springs?
10935,"In most patients immune system creates a strong enough response to destroy all the virus, you pass on relatively whatever virus you had the same as you got it unless when replicating it mutates within you and you pass on that mutation."
10936,"In someone immunocompromised like HIV patient not being properly treated so the immune system is stunted, they produce some antibodies that fight the infection but not enough."
10937,You need a swarm and a mass of antibodies.
10938,So the infection sticks around continuously multiplying but the immune system is still producing some antibodies to fight it and the virus exists in equilibrium.
10939,"Then one of the virus particles evades that specific antibody or has a better chance and begins winning, then immune system produces a slightly different antibody but it's still not enough."
10940,You become your own self selecting machine evolving a virus much quicker then 10 20 or 1000 normal people.
10941,"Numbers of course pulled out of my bum, but largely in a normal individual the antibodies you produce wins out and kills the virus entirely and leads to not many mutations probably none at all except and when you do spread even if you do have a mutated version you still have the original variant in you as well so you may not even pass on your mutation."
10942,"If you are infected for months continuously fighting and forcing self selection, it's the ideal breeding environment for a virus to go leaps and bounds past where it was in the past."
10943,"If it's more contagious but less lethal than delta then that would be a good thing, no?"
10944,"A milder strain taking over would help weed out the bad strains, and give people immunity through illness."
10945,"&gt;Overreacting is just as bad as reacting too slowly

So enforcing masks and social distancing again is just as bad as millions of people dead?"
10946,Most viruses spread easier in cold climates.
10947,Dry air and cold will make people have runny noses and all which you will constantly be touching/wiping and then spreading.
10948,Then people spend more time indoors.
10949,This is why you see most stomach bugs/colds/flus spread a lot in winter.
10950,Yes.
10951,"Only when Delta hit, most of the world did not have access to vaccines."
10952,"I dont think anyone will ""announce"" anything."
10953,"It will be a slow fade  into 2023 summer by which time the full effect of worldwide vaccinations, anti virals and boosters would have taken effect."
10954,"Hopefully at this point arbitrary shutdowns, restrictions and such are no longer the norm over the world."
10955,Essentially the rest of the world has to reach the state the US/UK/Scandinavia are in right now sans masks.
10956,An official end would be when the WHO announces it has ended like they do with all pandemics and epidemics.
10957,But given the political nature of this pandemic Im not holding my breath on that.
10958,you think the pandemic will last the rest of my life?
10959,interesting take.
10960,Mask dont work it even says it on the box
10961,Evading immunity is misleading.
10962,Antibodies may be less effective in stopping it.
10963,"However, for all variants, T cells are there to fight it long-term, even if you literally have 0 antibodies left."
10964,"Honestly, saying that it evades immunity simplies the matter tremendously, which is either stupid or fearmongering."
10965,Omicrons roll out!
10966,!
10967,Why?
10968,If i am a healthy 20 year old why on earth would I take the vaccine.
10969,My chances of dying of covid are minuscule and there is a much greater risk of myocarditis
10970,This is what a lot of people need to know.
10971,"As someone whose vaccinated I’m not as concerned about contracting a mild case as I am about potentially spreading it to others, especially at Christmas with older relatives."
10972,So what is different about this variant?
10973,Anything or is it just a new strain?
10974,"Double-vaxxed + booster for meh, but still wondering how much longer we gotta keep going through this same ole shit"

11006,You also have half of those names wrong and left out the majority of the variant lineages.
11007,Didn't this exact thing happen when Delta first broke?
11008,I got my booster today anyway so I'm not worried until we see anything otherwise.
11009,Just deal with it no???

11019,They can only provide information on the fly atm.
11020,Let's hope they're being truthful
11021,"&gt;Despite a mask mandate by the Dutch airline KLM, which operated the   
flights from South Africa, many passengers did not wear face coverings,   
said New York Times reporter Stephanie Nolen, who was aboard one of the   
planes."
11022,"Passengers were stuck on the airport tarmac for about four hours  
 before being sent to be swabbed, tweeted Nolen, who later said she tested negative."
11023,This is what you are up against.
11024,"Those deaths are not realistically preventable, any more than hunger and poverty can be eliminated."
11025,"The Earth will become Easter Island, and everyone will die, and their deaths will all have been preventable."

11028,"Well, I did what I could until now I say that because I got vaccined with all vaccines recommended here in my country."
11029,Idk whether my government'll advise to get vaccined with one more shot.
11030,I'm not sure like they'll act about that yet.
11031,Did you guys right there in NY already get some new news about some new shot beyond three ones you already took?
11032,hahahahahaha.
11033,sure.
11034,Of course it's here.

11038,Please?
11039,We have no evidence that the vaccines are ineffective against Omicron.
11040,None.
11041,We have no evidence that Omicron is more deadly than previous variants.
11042,I have a toddler in daycare.

11045,I get COVID tested every time.
11046,And I have never gotten a positive result.
11047,There are lots of colds out there!
11048,"Question: If a person is fully vaccinated (2 + booster), and has been exposed/infected with COVID-19, is it absolute that a PCR test will show positive result?"
11049,"I'm curious if being vaccinated means that if you catch COVID-19, your immune system will react fast/powerful enough to neutralize it in a way that most likely will not allow sufficient virus load in your body to be detected by tests."
11050,"I presume breakthrough cases are a result of the immune system not performing well enough to prevent infection, and thus the test picks up the virus presence, even being asymptomatic."
11051,Appreciate any insight/explanation.
11052,Thanks.

11068,There are no prominent symptoms.
11069,Of those infected some are currently being treated at home.” Hospitals have NOT been overburdened by Omicron patients and the new strain has not been detected in vaccinated individuals there.

11076,"Hong Kong identified an 11 day incubation period (its not from delta so its back to a slow build up, which might be good for the immune response), so it could already be everywhere, and depending on how honest those Hong Kong cases are it’s super easy to catch even before symptoms appear in the vaccinated."
11077,It's always too late.
11078,Governments will start announcing new restrictions in maybe a week if they rush it.
11079,Isn't this the same with the flu as well?
11080,Young healthy people sometimes rarely die of it though the greatest risk factor is being overweight and age.
11081,Actually it's counterintuitive but we want it to be more symptomatic but less deadly.

11091,"If the latter, is getting a fake negative test for travel a thing people can do in South Africa?"
11092,Also the UK had much more spread of Delta than the rest of the EU.
11093,I think once EU had a single digits percentage of spread it was already the dominant variant in the UK

Yea."
11096,Duh.
11097,We’re talking about Infectious Diseases tho.
11098,There are both bacterial and viral.
11099,Antibiotics cure bacterial and vaccines/anti-virals help cure viral.
11100,In the pharma and medical industry they are all under the umbrella term “INFECTIOUS DISEASE.” You’re clearly not in either industry.
11101,Infectious disease (ID) is the name of the business unit and specialty for all infectious diseases (whether they are bacterial or viral).
11102,"Yea, ID sectors are making enormous profits NOW."
11103,"That wasn’t the case before, yet you keep bringing up last quarter lol."
11104,Many companies downsized their ID business units bc they weren’t making enough profit before covid.
11105,NOW THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY.
11106,Read the article.
11107,Federal government and our taxes funded these vaccines with some help from private investors too.
11108,Pharma companies didn’t give a shit about vaccines before now bc they never turned enough profit.
11109,Why would they??
11110,It’s not good for business.
11111,What’s good for global health doesn’t always align with what’s most lucrative in pharma business — is there anything wrong with that?
11112,Not necessarily.
11113,But this time socialism and capitalism worked together bc what is good for global health IS good for business IN THIS CASE.
11114,so far that seems to be the case.

11124,How many more people has it passed around between November 11th and this weekend?
11125,How many flights have there been out of Joburg since November 11th?
11126,"First detected cases were announced in the last 24 hours in England, Italy, Belgium and Germany."
11127,"The only reason we don't know about where it has spread so far, is because we didn't know to look for it."
11128,"And given the incubation period, I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't toeholds of the variant all over the globe by now."
11129,Just need to start doing the right tests to bring it to light.

11352,100-200 international flights a day with about 25k passengers a day.
11353,Give it a few days for the infected to develop and the numbers globally will skyrocket.
11354,"I can think of a few;

- Something went wrong with the second testing of these passengers, eg."
11355,"most/all of these cases are false positives
- South African infection rates do not start/keep going up, eg."
11356,"while Omicron might have outcompeted Delta in South African context, it's not actually spreading that fast and there was 'just' a superspreader event that we're overanalyzing it due to the low overall rate of infection in South Africa
- More sequencing shows that the high relative prevalence of Omicron in South Africa was a fluke due to the low rate of testing there, eg."
11357,"it was just bad luck that Omicron cases were selected to be tested (This might already be quite impossible, as seems like the latest out of South Africa is that SGTF of PCR assays seems like a good proxy and the rates of such failures is looking pretty scary - over 50% in all specimens over the last few days; source: [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Implications-emergence-spread-SARS-CoV-2%20B.1.1.529-variant-concern-Omicron-for-the-EU-EEA-Nov2021.pdf))

11364,&gt;The best chance of effective protection is from vaccination.
11365,I don’t think there is much doubt about that.

11367,"Well now it's in Germany and the Czech Republic, per The Guardian."
11368,"So, yeah, it's everywhere."

11370,"Not a virologist and haven't delved deep enough in the science to understand it fully, but maybe someone smarter than me can tell me if I'm thinking about this right:

Does a high number of mutations necessarily mean as much as it sounds on paper?"
11371,"On the surface it makes sense that the more varied the virus is, the more challenging it is to catch/stop with a vaccine."
11372,But wouldn't there also be the possibility of useless mutations?
11373,Or ones that aren't really connected to the overall fitness of the virus?
11374,"Think about a race car as an example of a virus and the parts of it that you can ""mutate""."
11375,"You can tweak it to be more aerodynamic, adjust the tire pressure for better grip."
11376,"All good ""mutations"" that make it better on the track."
11377,"But fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview mirror would be a ""mutation"" as well that clearly doesn't do much for the overall abilities of it on the track."

11458,Or aren't consulted?
11459,The reason the travel bans have been set up the way they are is because it gives airlines the option to continue travel.
11460,This whole pandemic has shown how poor neoliberalism is at managing crises.

11628,I read there are concerns that it won't be as effective but we need time and data really - give it at least a month
11629,That’s an absurd comparison
11630,I don't think so.
11631,I'm reading this article now.

11639,And Detroit Metro brings in a lot of international flights.
11640,Kinda makes you wonder if our spike is partly the big O....not in a good way.....
11641,[deleted]
11642,"Exactly, it could actually be a good thing."
11643,A less severe variant that will out-compete Delta.
11644,I hope you're right man 😞 I'm not here to argue with you.
11645,"Thanks, hear that."
11646,I'll try to stick with it.

11650,Nine months since their second vaccine shot.
11651,Interesting.
11652,I'll be waiting for the science eagerly to see how omnicrom stacks up against a boosted person
11653,I imagined that we had progressed as a species since the days of witch burnings.
11654,Turns out we're still the same.
11655,What about people who had two Pfizer shots then had Covid?
11656,I’m not arguing on how transmissible it is.
11657,I’m saying there’s clearly something wrong with the data.
11658,There’s no way this variant spread across an entire continent and only caused a single (potential) outbreak.
11659,How transmissible it is doesn’t matter.
11660,"It could be the most transmissible virus to ever exist, and this would not be possible."
11661,There is something wrong with the data.

11670,"Start exercising, eating well, and stop being obese."
11671,It's still has not been confirmed yet.
11672,"Some countries make you pay for the quarantine hotel, i'd take a look into that."
11673,International travel is risky.
11674,I'd also have a look at incidence in all 3 countries and their testing (and avaccination) regime as low testing might fake low incidence.
11675,Ministry of foreign affairs should have risk assessment.
11676,"Netherlands just butchered their handling of incoming african passengers, all in one unventilated room, barely anyone with masks waiting for hours, where at least every 10th came out positive."
11677,"In short, western countries overburdened after 2 years of pandemic to test people smh."
11678,[removed]
11679,I think both.
11680,"So, I don't want to rain on your parade or anything but I live in a very ""blue"" major US city and I would say mask usage is at maybe 15-20% of what it was in May."
11681,And that's with Delta (too soon to really tell if Omicron is going to move the needle).
11682,"Very, very few masks but vax rate is very high."
11683,"Bars and restaurants packed, live music back at full capacity etc."
11684,Cases are still low relative to other areas.
11685,"Are you actually suggesting that 80-85% of the population where I live has sociopathic tendencies, or could it be perhaps that wearing a mask just isn't normal, natural behavior and people have made a risk assessment based on age, vaccination status, etc."
11686,and decided that the benefits of not wearing one outweigh the danger?
11687,I can only guess that if usage is that low where I live it's probably nearly nil most places in the USA.
11688,South African health officials already said the variant has shown mild symptoms without loss of taste or smell.
11689,"This is according to Angelique Coetzee, a board member of the South African Medical Association."
11690,We aren't going to see millions of dead from this.
11691,It's hysteria to make that prediction.
11692,"&gt; Whereas there is a wide range in antibody titers in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2, completion of a primary vaccine series, especially with mRNA vaccines, typically leads to a more consistent and higher-titer initial antibody response."

11718,"This could very easily not even have originated in South Africa, but only detected there first."
11719,Wouldn't be much worse than what we've already seen.
11720,Would also promote younger people to get vaccinated when they saw their coworkers get hospitalized and die.
11721,Yeah I don't get it.
11722,Getting paranoid that they know more than is being disclosed..
11723,Surely not enough reason to close borders in Israel with high booster rate unless it turns out to be more lethal
11724,Exactly this.
11725,"Reading more about this, it doesn't apply to US citizens or permanent residents, which makes it even more useless."
11726,"She's talking about transmission at at that point, not severity."
11727,"And it's not my narrative, it's the narrative of the head of the South African Medical Association's narrative."
11728,Fact
11729,That is a bit early to say though.
11730,It might confirm that  but they might also be close contacts to the travelers.
11731,That was the case of the five in Italy.
11732,Isn't this basically how Spanish flu stopped killing people?
11733,It just turned into the flu we have now.

11735,Do you need to Google what asymptomatic means?
11736,Gotta act now while supplies last
11737,Vax Thanos
11738,Okay sure lol
11739,I wonder if Omicron has anything to do with the recent spike of COVID in Austria.
11740,We're already a couple days too late to do anything meaningful towards prevention.
11741,Just have to hope the vaccine helps against this variant and continue doing your personal procedures.
11742,Too damn many people in this country don't give af so we're pretty much screwed.
11743,Amen haha
11744,So why exactly are governments already losing their minds over it?
11745,Based on what we know so far from news reports of how it is spreading it seems to be very highly transmissible.
11746,But we know pretty much nothing about its virulence (how sick it makes people) relative to other strains.
11747,"Not necessarily, the scenario you described would be true if the rate of vaccination and the severity of disease was the same for all demographics."
11748,A possible alternative scenario is that vaccinated folks over 70 could still have a higher risk of severe disease than unvaccinated people under 35.
11749,But vaccinated younger folks have basically no risk of severe disease.
11750,"If you have an older population, you could end up with a relatively high number of vaccinated individuals in the hospital, but over all the vaccine is still quite effective at preventing severe disease."
11751,"I get what you're saying, but if the new variant is bad enough to warrant additional shutdowns, that means it evades the vaccines and ""having done our part"" is not enough."
11752,The virus gives no effs about how tired of it we are.
11753,"I'm not gonna tell you how to live, but this thing will kill 1M+ by the time it's all over and you move to a place without restrictions at your own peril."
11754,"Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but we will know by January."
11755,I'll wager a guess that it's much more difficult to hold someone if they test negative than if they test positive even if it makes sense to hold them.
11756,Narrator: It didn't.
11757,About 10% of cases are sequenced in the UK
11758,$800!
11759,That’s like TWO firstborns
11760,Because they think the first time made them immune and the second time was just a fluke.
11761,Bruh why you gotta tempt fate like that.
11762,Watch this shit turns everyone into COVID-zombies to inherit the Earth.
11763,"You'll probably only have minimal contact at the door, if any, with people."

11766,"/s 

In all seriousness, this variant emerged weeks if not months ago, and has been spreading around the world since then."
11767,We're only noticing now.
11768,It's already widespread.
11769,The only things that matter are disease severity and vaccine efficacy.
11770,"I think they're referring to other illnesses, such as the cold and the flu."
11771,I’d be surprised if your not already being a coward and screaming to put everyone in lockdown…
11772,I'm being cautious anyways.

11784,Testing DOES matter.
11785,"A single test is just that, a single point in time when you aren't shedding the virus."
11786,"False negatives are low, so that's not an excuse to say ""testing doesn't matter""."
11787,"A single negative test just before the flight suggests you aren't infectious while on the plane, if you test positive a few days later.. What would be better is for people to 2 or 3 tests over a period of time prior to flying."
11788,"But regardless, if your not in quarantine between tests then there is still the possibility of catching it prior to your flight and having it slip thru the cracks of intermittent testing."
11789,I see a lot of Positive PCR results.
11790,"There are a couple of companies that run the target genes broadly, but most do not."
11791,If you're an under 30 man I would get the smaller Pfizer dose.
11792,Otherwise it really doesn't matter.
11793,Even the weakest vaccines are incredibly effective with three doses.
11794,I really don’t understand what you are saying is incorrect.
11795,Followed by facts I already know.
11796,Then reiterating the idea that we don’t really know or not if this variant will be important or turn out to be nothing.
11797,Which I also agree with.
11798,We can’t lean one way or the other without more evidence.
11799,We also can’t assume it will be less deadly when we don’t have the data.
11800,Because we don’t know.
11801,Covid isn’t known for mutating to be less deadly.
11802,Delta proved that.
11803,Any other mutations that may have been less deadly were beat out by Delta.
11804,So we can hope that it turns out to be less deadly/not a factor… but we need to be proactive instead of reactive.
11805,Saying to look at the few cases we have data on as proof it’s much more mild is bizarre.
11806,UNLESS you actually have more access to data then the general public?
11807,"Which is possible, however what is not yet known to us is most likely known to those making decisions."
11808,"Which could simply be unverified data, waiting for verification."
11809,"Could also mean that the data they are drawing from is incomplete, not sufficient… but until they know for sure they exercise extreme caution."
11810,"Because we know what it’s like to pretend it won’t have an effect, and what could have been different if we had reacted differently."
11811,The two people in Hong Kong who caught omicron both were double vaccinated with Pfizer.
11812,Yep!

11869,Very true.
11870,What I mean is the implication that vaccines are not effective against the variant.
11871,In that scenario you would expect them to be representative of the population.
11872,By that I mean total immune escape.
11873,The early statistics seem to show the vaccines are working enough to keep people out of the hospital for now.

11974,"Gottleib Retweet: ""The gut feeling I'm getting is that before Botswana and South Africa detected it, this variant has been flying under the radar in various places for some time."""
11975,Literally no one knows at this point.
11976,Omicron was first fully sequenced less than a week ago from a sample collected on November 9.

11990,I didn’t say that.
11991,I’m just correcting the assumption that blankets all those who are positive.
11992,"At the same time everyone I know who is vaccinated that was a close contact never got sick, my friend has been sent home 3 times now because of close contact and required negative tests to come back to work all 3 times nothing, another friend is only partially vaxxed and even she came out negative after being a close contact."

12002,The negative test that we have before flying is made officially by an authorised tester and a certificate is issued.
12003,I show that when I check in and when I board.
12004,It could be faked but that is now forging an official document with penalties.
12005,I believe they are also printed with QR Codes that can be checked.
12006,the outcome of catching covid is totally dependent on the individual who catches it.
12007,one variable of that is vaccination or natural immunity.
12008,I blame the media hysteria for this.
12009,There have been several mutant variants detected throughout the past two years and they choose this particular variant to drum up fears without there being any concrete indication that it is as any deadlier or more contagious.
12010,Many countries have banned travel from South Africa already.
12011,Punishing them when they were very open about the variant while sharing as much data as they could.
12012,"Meanwhile, we had politicians in New York organizing visits to Chinatown on February when China was most unhelpful with transparency about the novel coronavirus."
12013,I fear this will only disincentivize countries from reporting new coronavirus variants for fear of travel bans and backlash.

12038,So who cares about wellbeing of our neighbors.
12039,Oh wow.
12040,Didn't know that.
12041,Thanks.
12042,Considering the 4-8 day incubation period (can be up to two weeks or longer) with COVID-19 many of those will probably move onto develop symptoms.
12043,We don't know.
12044,Even whales and other mammals that live in the ocean get coronaviruses and may get COVID-19 at some point.
12045,This will circulate among mammals for the foreseeable future.
12046,COVID variants have existed for well over 50 million years and humans aren't going to eradicate it in a few years of trying.
12047,"Get vaccinated, stay current on the boosters, and encourage others to do the same."
12048,It's the best response we have to defend against it.
12049,The Spanish flu  pandemic 100 years ago was H1N1 also known as the swine flu and may have come from contact with farm animals (possibly pigs but we don't really know for sure) and variants of it still circulate today and we are going to have to learn to live with COVID.
12050,If we can significantly increase vaccine production and uptake in humans globally then it would really help us get back to normal.
12051,"Unfortunately many people refuse to get vaccinated even where it's available, pharmaceutical companies do not want to share their trade secrets to help other countries produce effective vaccines that would save millions of lives, and we have a global shortage of supplies needed to produce the vaccines for 7+ billion people."
12052,It's like trying to stop global warming...we can't do it...80 percent of global warming is natural and only 20 percent of it is possible for humans to control.
12053,It's similar to waging war in the middle east that is unwinnable...we have done the same with COVID.
12054,That doesn't mean we shouldn't try but we can't stop the inevitable.
12055,"The craziest part is they had this knowledge in _May 2021_, yet did _nothing_ about it and [a similar scenario happened](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/what-we-know-about-the-crowne-plaza-investigation) in August 2021 which led to New Zealand's major delta outbreak which we have still not recovered from."
12056,How?
12057,"With the never ending demands for more lockdowns and restrictions every time a variant pops up, it won't get better."
12058,The vaccines were supposed to give us our lives back and continued mandates for NPIs are not sustainable in the long run without turning into a powderkeg.
12059,I'm so concerned for my kids' future in a world that has subordinated *everything* to trying to control a statistically-mild and contagious upper respiratory virus that's de-fanged by vaccination.
12060,"We've lost nearly 2 years of their childhood to this, now it's turning into a forever war."
12061,We struggled with whether to even bother getting them vaccinated because it won't give them their lives back.
12062,"In the end we made them start the series earlier this month, but they're pissed because they'll still have to wear masks in school all day."
12063,Two days of illness isn't what I would consider moderate downside.
12064,But people have to make there own discussions just bear in mind your decisions will effect others.
12065,"The market reaction to omicron was significantly more risk off compared to any other variant so far, including Delta"
12066,"When I take a shit at work I feel like I'm downgrading, flying coach."
12067,Per day.

12090,"So if you're right, we'll see Africa doing quite well vs Covid compared to the West (and Far East) in the coming years."
12091,"It will be interesting to see how it plays out, though it is hard to get good data from Africa."
12092,"If 100% of the population of the US got vaccinated when it was first available, there would still be a high prevalence of COVID in the population both domestically and abroad."

12100,I'm having flashbacks to similar conversations on Reddit in February 2020 trying to figure out what was happening with high numbers of positives in recent air travellers.
12101,"I suppose, if there's one thing we learned then, is that this won't have started yesterday."
12102,This will have been happening for a week or two at the least already.
12103,"So probably hundreds if not thousands of cases already, and that's just through one airport."
12104,"The good news, though, is that if that has been happening and no-one noticed anything was up vs. normal Covid cases, then this new variant may not be that much more transmissible than Delta after all."
12105,"Either that or the Netherlands has worse monitoring than South Africa, which is actually quite possible."
12106,"Yeah, why didn't they go in proper order?"
12107,"Ν, Ξ, Ο

They skipped 2."
12108,"Being overly optimistic might land you at the end of the Greek alphabet quite fast, and quite fast we'll have to learn to pronounce Thai consonants."

12120,"There were over 600 people on the flight and an unknown number of people *not on the flight* who took the test as well, but testing positive, were not allowed."
12121,"So for any of the other ~540 passengers not yet known to be positive, the test’s negative result was correct, and for anyone rejected (who was actually infected) the result was also correct."

12144,I’d wager this didn’t even originate from South Africa and more likely a country in the region where it could spread almost unchecked.

12194,Yes if you happen to catch it in the next couple of months.

12272,"A paper I read in alpha showed few people tested positive the first 48 hours after infection, about half did on day 3 and 90%+ from day 4 onward."
12273,But I think the incubation time of delta is shorter so it may be detected sooner than that.
12274,The Belgian omicron scare has been confirmed to be delta though

12298,"If that will make people get the vaccine, I'll repeat it ad nauseam."
12299,"But to be honest it's the civic aspect that is important : getting the vaccine limits the capacity of the virus to incubate and potentially mutate if you get it, AND it seriously impedes the possibility of you infecting anyone else."
12300,"Anecdotally, all four double vaxxed people I know that caught mild covid tested positive on the LFTs."
12301,They aren't 100% but your anecdote is rather misleading.

12317,It could be that they actually don't have much supply of vaccines (at least nationwide) but some vaccination sites in certain areas got a bunch donated/already vaccinated a large chunk of the local population
12318,Further proof that capitalism can’t and won’t solve the worlds major problems.
12319,A vaccine that’s only for the rich makes the poor a Petri dish for more variants.
12320,The US has already shut down air traffic to SA though.
12321,Rapid rests are extremely easy to fake if self-conducted.
12322,So whether they were done by a lab or just by the person is pretty important.
12323,You can take a reliable test 5 days after you’ve possibly had contact with a positive person.
12324,That’s on average the time that it takes the virus to built up and make it traceable for a test.
12325,So if you want to be completely safe you have to quarantaine travelers 5 days before they travel
12326,"Legally, you really can't stop US citizens from returning to the US."
12327,But you can certainly force them to quarantine on return.
12328,And you can prevent them from leaving the US to go to a hotspot.
12329,Which is what we should be doing.
12330,"The fact that United and Delta announced that they will not stop flying to SA literally an hour after the travel ban was announced is disgusting, these companies would not be around today if we didn't shovel billions of taxpayer dollars into their pockets during the pandemic."

12592,"Omicron was only discovered 4 days ago, but drama and excitement wins."
12593,"“When in danger or in doubt; run in circles, scream, and shout.”"
12594,This sounds like it's more about vindictiveness than actually ending the pandemic.
12595,"Withholding a viral cure pill from people because they have refused to get the vaccine feels nice, but is just as counterproductive as people not getting the vaccine."
12596,"&gt; No excuse not to get all three shots, even for people who had covid and two shots already."
12597,I got a good excuse.
12598,Have not been invited to get it yet.
12599,Panic stations better lock down everything even though it doesn’t help whatsoever

12607,He’s only asking if it’s possible.
12608,The answer is yes.
12609,The probability is unknown.
12610,They were never worth it
12611,Incarceration rate and happiness index aren’t inversely related are they?
12612,"Greeks: ""We were not consulted on the naming convention""."
12613,Which makes sense.
12614,I’ve heard from some evolutionary biologists that say mutations will typically trade for higher infectiousness for lower severity/lethality.
12615,The “goal” being a higher chance of the virus surviving over the long term
12616,"I mean, we don’t know if it’s a sucker punch yet."
12617,Could be a sucker stab or a sucker pinch for all we know.
12618,Well in all fairness it has become political in the sense that there is policy around getting it now.
12619,"My apologies, it’s apparently five days, still slower than deltas four and that’s good news."
12620,"I had heard it reported 11, but the threads I’m seeing in it state 5 now."
12621,"“Hong Kong omicron hotel” 

Your search terms, it was a SA traveler who seemingly infected a Canadian Traveler in a quarantine hotel due to a valved mask (why permit a valved mask in a quarantine hotel is beyond me, enough of a cut in transmission to use when there’s a cloth mask or no mandate, but not truest a respirator)."
12622,"As I understand it, transmission is a time x concentration thing."
12623,Wearing masks reduces the concentration of viral particles in the air.
12624,Less people would be infected if someone did have it.
12625,Ah thank you!
12626,Agreed
12627,Dip the chicken nuggets in the frosty.
12628,Why even use QR code?
12629,Store or link vaccination status to the ID card and let it be read via NFC.
12630,"That guarantees no ""eye check"" and simple copy can be done."
12631,It doesn't make a difference.
12632,You said the *only* way to get to 90% is for unvaccinated to die off and *unfortunately* that won't happen quick enough.
12633,More transmissible.
12634,This is seemingly following the same stages as the last big pandemic with the Spanish flu in the early 20th century from my knowledge.
12635,First wave was bad (Alpha).
12636,Second wave was really bad with the war and everything else.
12637,(Delta for us) and then the virus slowly burned itself out.
12638,"This is what my very dumb brain is assuming is happening with the new variant, viruses don't want to die either, so killing a host is bad for it."
12639,"The best viruses are ones that can easily go from one to another without harming the host, like the common cold."
12640,Most people have mild symptoms for all covid variants.
12641,The concern is around the fact that it displaced Delta faster than Delta displaced the dominant variant before it.
12642,And the mutations are expected to make existing antibody treatments much less effective (supposedly AZ's treatment may not be affect that much though?).
12643,"For the same reasons, it may be much more infectious in vaccinated people."
12644,I think what finally spooked some people is that more young and healthy people seemed to be hospitalized and succumbed to it.
12645,Plus the rate at which unvaxxed people were being hospitalized and dying was very difficult to ignore.
12646,"So, *I trust my immune system* no longer seemed like such a great excuse."
12647,I have doubts that Omicron will have the same effect if it's as mild as the early reports are suggesting it might be.
12648,"In fact if it is mild, it might actually have the opposite effect."
12649,Anti-vax people have very backwards ways of justifying their denialism.
12650,"I know, otherwise makes no sense."
12651,Its not like only Southern Africans are or can be infected.
12652,"No one said you can contain it, but the spread can be slowed down to give us more time to get more information

  


&gt; Nothing fundamentally changes, just get vaccinated

  


We don't know that yet."
12653,There are reasons to believe the vaccines could be less effective against omicron.
12654,"That's why both Pfizer and moderna are working on new boosters tailored for this variant, out of an abundance of caution."
12655,[removed]
12656,[removed]
12657,"Maybe it will, maybe it won't."
12658,"In the meantime, it remains that there is overwhelming upside to getting vaccinated."
12659,That's not what ges saying.
12660,"He's saying that hes CONCERNED about the POSSIBILITY of that happening, there's a difference."
12661,What do you think the fatality rate of covid is?
12662,"I'll give you a clue: it's not 100%

What *will* happen is that they all catch the virus (most of them probably have already), so the 98-99% that don't die will develop similar immunity to the vaccinated population."
12663,Well.....crap.
12664,I thought those vaccinated didn't require a test?
12665,Typically that's because either the sample wasn't stored or collected properly or it's early enough in the infection that your viral load isn't high enough to be detected yet.
12666,By the time you're having symptoms you should have enough virus in your system/sample for the assay to detect COVID
12667,"I still wipe once or twice to dry off, but it comes back clean a vast majority of the time, and on the rare occasion that I missed something (only ever just a tiny spot), I just turn it on again and it's taken care of in a few seconds."
12668,The water pressure is plenty strong enough to wash the poo away.
12669,I never have to turn it up more than 50% or so (more than that would be pretty painful).
12670,Proud of the number of vaccines we’ve provided to the rest of the world.
12671,We fuck up a lot but that was nice to see.
12672,"The traveler either caught in Mozambique so it was there on or before November 11, or the traveler caught it in Italy which means there are other older cases in Italy."
12673,"Here’s the thing: from watching https://cov-spectrum.ethz.ch/, Italy is one of the fastest countries to report sequences after sampling."
12674,It would be hard for Omicron to go unnoticed in Italy very long.
12675,"Now it could have been spreading for a few months, or it could be spreading very quickly."
12676,The recent case jumps in Gauteng Province suggest the latter.
12677,If they are so rare have they considered that the trigger might have been something else and not the vaccine?
12678,"Due to so many people getting their shots, odds of random coincidences like that are very high."
12679,The Italian man has 2 vaccine doses but mild symptoms.
12680,This is good news for vaccine efficacy against severe disease.
12681,Have to talk to Aaron Rodgers’ medical team.
12682,He sussed it out way back.
12683,I’m not sure I agree.
12684,This virus spread from South Africa to Egypt enough to infect random visitors from other continents.
12685,"I don’t care how transmissible it is, that’s takes more than a month to happen."
12686,Just think about doubling times and how many doubles you’d have to have before a virus spread across an entire continent.
12687,And then think about how widespread it would have to be in random countries for visitors to come in contact with it.
12688,I just don’t see that happening in a month.
12689,"From Israel analysis of BNT162b2

Among more than 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members who were 16 years of age or older, 54 cases met the criteria for myocarditis."
12690,"The estimated incidence per 100,000 persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine was 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 2.70)."
12691,"The highest incidence of myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 to 14.46) was reported in male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years."
12692,A total of 76% of cases of myocarditis were described as mild and 22% as intermediate; 1 case was associated with cardiogenic shock.
12693,"After a median follow-up of 83 days after the onset of myocarditis, 1 patient had been readmitted to the hospital, and 1 had died of an unknown cause after discharge."
12694,"Of 14 patients who had left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography during admission, 10 still had such dysfunction at the time of hospital discharge."
12695,"Of these patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing that revealed normal heart function."
12696,I don’t understand what you think the alternative should be.
12697,Should they just not be telling us when it shows up in a new country?
12698,Should they just hide the information?
12699,Do you want the scientists to not tell anybody when they find it?
12700,Do you want the governments to not tell anybody?
12701,Like what is the alternative that you want?
12702,Yea no probs.
12703,I don't think wishing for the quick death of 50 million people is a valid opinion.
12704,I think you should be ashamed of having that opinion.
12705,"&gt;plus the positive case in China again, 

what is this part?"
12706,Thanks for the reply!
12707,What do you mean by transient?

After overnight genome sequencing, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed that two cases of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 have been identified in the UK."
12713,"The individuals that have tested positive, and all members of their households, are being re-tested and told to self-isolate while further testing and contact tracing is underway."
12714,One case has been located in the Chelmsford area and the other in Nottingham.
12715,The two cases are linked and there is a link to travel to Southern Africa.
12716,UKHSA is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious.
12717,"In response to the developing situation, the UK is taking decisive action to protect public health."
12718,Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary.
12719,"In addition, in line with updated advice from the UKHSA, from 4am Sunday Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will be added to the travel red list."
12720,Travellers who have returned from these four countries in last 10 days must isolate and get a PCR test.
12721,UKHSA are following up recent arrivals from these countries.
12722,"To all of us vaccinated folks, definitely yes."
12723,"The media is claiming this one originated in Africa, stereo typically anti-vaxers fear things from Africa more"
12724,It depends on how long you are contagious before you become symptomatic.

12728,"I don't have the rate you're looking for, but the rates of long term effects of COVID infection are significant."
12729,"You're also infectious two days before your symptoms appear, so by the time you realize you're sick you could have passed it on."
12730,Getting your booster lowers your likelihood of becoming infected after an exposure and could break a chain of transmission that ends up killing someone.
12731,5-8 million depending on age.
12732,It's look like normal variant.
12733,No death or serious symptoms reported.
12734,And what do you think is going to kill them?
12735,Certainly not covid; its fatality rate is *far* too low to shift demographics in such a significant way.
12736,It won't even bring them from 30% to 29%.
12737,October 7 is the best guess for common ancestor of all the current sequenced genomes.

12743,Do take that for what it’s worth
12744,Time to imprison these people.
12745,They are a threat to society.
12746,65% in the hospital were unvaccinated and 35% had one dose.
12747,None were fully vaccinated.
12748,"I couldn’t find the vaccination rate for Bara, but someone else had reported it was somewhere around 27%?"
12749,"So, if 50 people were hospitalized with the variant, you would expect 13 of them to be fully vaccinated."
12750,68.4% is low.
12751,On top of that you have regions below 65%.
12752,"And you can clearly see they are doing worse than regions with higher vaccination rates

I think the estimates to get though the winter without needing significant measures was a vaccination rate of at least 85%."
12753,A lot of people are right there with you
12754,You’re welcome!
12755,There’s too many acronyms to keep track of these days.
12756,Myocarditis is transient.
12757,It is not something to be overly concerned about and considering you've been vaccinated prior the probability is even less.

12775,“Mild” in my head can be rough but not at risk of death — I.e.
12776,not go to hospital bad.
12777,Omicron has around 30 mutations on the spike delta has a couple.
12778,This may not carry over need to wait and see
12779,"I know there are many types of cold virus, but I was referring the the  most common one that originated from coronaviruses."

12785,How much does B cell immunity hold up if it’s just making new antibodies?
12786,That's plain wrong.
12787,"The strains don't really compete with each other, they propagate as multiple independent epidemics."
12788,Who said do nothing?
12789,We need to get vaccinated and get the whole world vaccinated.
12790,But beyond that what can we really do.
12791,Its in animal populations... Its not going away ever.
12792,"this might sound silly:

is it safe to get the booster the day after i go to the eye dr &amp; have my pupils dilated?"
12793,"like, eye drop dilation drops are safe before the vaccine?"

12809,Thought it was a variant on SO (significant other) at first.
12810,"This is not a science subreddit, r/covid19 is a science subreddit."
12811,Exactly
12812,"N95 3-jabs club, represent."
12813,"Several reasons for the concern:

* It displaced Delta faster than Delta displaced its predecessor (Beta, I think?"
12814,"), therefore it's probably more infectious than Delta, which itself was almost off the charts."
12815,* It has a huge number of mutations... over 50 from the baseline virus.
12816,"A number of them are in the spike protein, which is the segment of the virus that vaccines are targeting... so there's a worrying chance that people with immunity from the vaccines won't have immunity to Omicron."
12817,"* Because it has so many mutations it's potentially a very different virus than Delta... it could be more lethal, it could be less lethal but with more long term consequences, or any other differences."
12818,"It's like the novel potentially deadly virus is novel again, and we're rolling the dice again."
12819,"* With the number of people not vaccinated in the US, the health care system is already overwhelmed with Delta cases."
12820,"ICU beds are running low, doctors and nurses are burning out, corpses are being piled in trailers."
12821,"Because it spreads faster than Delta, it could infect more of the unvaccinated faster, which will greatly increase the pressure on hospitals.. they're already at the breaking point, they may become broken."
12822,"We might reach a point where people getting sick for any reason (including non covid reasons) can't get help at a hospital at all... people could die at home from appendicitis or child birth, while the people who do get health care will still be broke due to the cost."
12823,"People aren't assuming so much as expecting... this virus is just plain mean, it can't be contained with the measures the US public and government are willing to take at this point, so a new variant that is easier to catch than Delta is a potential nightmare... and everyone is expecting more bad news these days as a means of coping with the reality of the world in this pandemic."
12824,"I understand, but I'm talking about the same thing, you have the sniffles, a cough, maybe a low grade fever but does not require hospitalization or a visit."
12825,That's where we want to be.
12826,Apparently “expert” is too if they truly believe that
12827,"
&gt; The United States has already donated more vaccines to other countries than every other country combined."
12828,Does someone have statistics on that?
12829,Ideally separating pledges and already given vaccines.
12830,Could be that he tested positive a while ago but the sequencing results only came in recently
12831,We don’t get access to them here until the new year but omicron might get them to speed that up
12832,Oh shit.
12833,It’s everywhere
12834,&gt;the news about this new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations.
12835,"The United States has already donated more vaccines to other countries than every other country combined

This is a bit misleading."
12836,"What is needed to end the pandemic is total exports, because the virus doesn't care about whether a vaccine was donated or exported."
12837,"When it comes to total exports, the US has only exported around one fifth of what EU and China has."
12838,"Not sure about these, yesterday it was confirmed that one Belgian person was *not*."
12839,My sister-in-law!
12840,"We HAVE to wear masks in indoor public spaces here, I had no idea that wasn’t the case in the states!"

12842,"Can, but won’t."
12843,"Should, maybe, but shorn’t."
12844,"I don't think anyone said it was two weeks old, but we have no evidence that it spread before November."
12845,"It’s not because of South Africa, it’s bc of shitty people in general."
12846,Buying fake tests is prevalent all over the world.
12847,What are some other possible explanations?
12848,My grandma is going to be absolutely devastated by this loss.
12849,"Excuse me for asking, but what is a SIL?"
12850,"Aside from the fact that most South Africans in general aren't vaccinated, we should also bear in mind that a *huge* proportion are likely to have been naturally infected (the number of excess deaths there is massive), so looking at the number of vaccinated people in hospitals doesn't tell us much about whether the new variant is good at evading immunity."
12851,It’s still so nice reading things coming out of the WH and feeling like they were written by adults.
12852,So they are playing covid roulette.

12862,The variant is out there.
12863,"We'll never stop it from spreading, just like we never stopped delta."

12865,"There will be hundreds of stories in the coming days, one case detected in country X, 4 in country Y, etc."
12866,"Irrelevant, it's everywhere!"
12867,Let's get the data that really matters.
12868,I had Pfizer as my vaccine.
12869,"However, I'm going for a booster and was considering requesting Moderna."
12870,But apparently it's more common for Moderna to cause myocarditis.
12871,I know the chance of this side effect are rare and it's not stopping me from getting my booster.
12872,"However, I was curious if the myocarditis is temporary?"
12873,"Like, if you are an otherwise healthy person, is it something to be overly concerned about?"
12874,You know how doctors often have terrible bedside manner?
12875,"Well, many researchers have terrible social understanding."
12876,Yup.
12877,99% of people don't realize what a game changer mRNA vaccines are.
12878,"BioNTech, etc saved a shit ton of people."
12879,Highly recommend reading up on it.
12880,Can you explain how this shame thing works?
12881,It just sounds like your judging someone else's opinion that you disagree with.
12882,"If there is a list of places in the US that is okay with survival of the fittest, UP Michigan is on the list."
12883,16 days is a long incubation time.
12884,Wonder when the Mozambique traveler was first symptomatic.
12885,A full martyr for the cause.
12886,That's my hope too.
12887,Those mutations on the spike protein may help it evade the immune system more effectively but hopefully at the cost of ability to dock to the ACE2 receptors it uses the same spike protein for.
12888,And the data we have might suggest just that.
12889,"Very mild cases in people without immunity, asymptomatic in people with immunity, very low hospitalization rate."
12890,Fingers crossed.
12891,The high variability in outcomes are one of the aspects of the disease that's very hard to understand.
12892,People form strong opinions based on their own experience or the experience of someone they know (It was just the sniffles!
12893,"), but that's really valid to understand the risks."
12894,"Two people in  a similar demographic and health condition can get it, and one really might just get the sniffles, and the other get deathly ill."
12895,"That’s probably true, though they made efforts to flatten the curve as well, and, I still say our density matters a lot."
12896,They need to be honest about their failures because blithely stating that vaccine holdouts will get vaccinated because of a new variant is just wrong.
12897,Stating otherwise just undermines their credibility.
12898,"Especially as the majority of the world has some T or B cells which works for any variant, which matter the most for a long pandemic with many variants."
12899,"DTW is a major Delta Hub, and is also a pretty big international travel hub."
12900,Case trajectory outcomes lag behind positive tests so for severity of illness probably a few weeks to a month?
12901,The more time the clearer the picture.
12902,For vaccine effectiveness probably two weeks ought to give enough data to begin drawing a picture.
12903,Maybe a little sooner.
12904,We’ll know how well the vaccines hold up before we know much about changes in severity.

12906,Slow news day.
12907,Honestly I have no idea.
12908,Only time is going to tell how bad this is and we won’t know for like two weeks.

12922,&gt;Does WHO (or whichever entity) that does the naming even look to see if there are claims on a name?
12923,they chose greek letters rather than place names like had been used in the past (see spanish flu or south africa variant).
12924,hurricanes in the US are named after a set of common first names (followed by a set of uncommon ones if there are too many storms in one year).

12939,"Compared to their European neighbors:
Less severe restrictions during the pandemic
Vaccine hesitancy
Way more guns
More conservative
Values individual freedom highly
Low taxes"
12940,If everyone is vaccinated it'll be fine.
12941,I don't see why you judge us so much for taking a sun holiday.
12942,Mild symptoms over hyped.
12943,Get vaccinated and this will pass.
12944,I mean what else are they supposed to say?
12945,Tell people not to get vaccinated?
12946,Not say anything at all?
12947,Tell the unvaccinated to take pseudo-science remedies instead?
12948,The people that are staunchly against the vaccine likely won't even get it if they watched their closest loved one die.
12949,At this point its not on the experts to convince the unvaccinated; the unvaccinated have to convince themselves.
12950,I test the waves down in Africa...I thought they were surfing...😔
12951,On your left kapt
12952,Same here.
12953,I was miserably sick for a couple days after both the first and second Pfizer.
12954,"The day after the Pfizer booster, I was just sleepy."
12955,"Fauci must be pumped, more spotlight time coming around."
12956,"To be fair, original COVID-19 took a couple weeks to really ""take off"" and kill someone, and in the interim it was often mild."
12957,It's important to make the distinction between a virus' ability to escape immunity to cause infection vs its ability to escape immunity to cause severe disease.
12958,"This is all just speculation at this point so we will have to wait for a full answer

So, I do want to mention that it's very possible that Omicron evades the vaccine-induced immune system to cause infection but not to the point to cause severe disease."
12959,This is a nuanced but important distinction.
12960,"But again, just speculation at this point, but the answer will come eventually."
12961,You don’t have to with this variant.
12962,The S primer fails so you get 2 positives instead of the usual 3 with the “S gene dropout” which disappeared with Alpha.
12963,"Yea, you would have to sequence it to be sure, but it’s not a variant that spread silently that requires a full sequence to even detect."
12964,"As long as you’re seated and actively eating or drinking, you can’t get it or spread it to others."
12965,There’s an invisible barrier that covid hasn’t managed to penetrate.
12966,/s in case there’s any doubt.
12967,Get the booster.
12968,It will protect you now.
12969,It will be months before an Omicron specific booster is available and it's only speculation if an Omicron specific version  will even be needed.
12970,In 2 weeks the Omicron variant has jumped to 75% of all sequenced variants in South Africa.
12971,There is a really good chance it is Omicron.
12972,https://mobile.twitter.com/tuliodna/status/1463911571176968194
12973,I don't disagree that misinformation is problematic.
12974,But I'm not sure what else you would have public health experts do in public facing comments other than continue to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated.
12975,It really is strange.
12976,I suspect there is still a lot to learn about this.
12977,"""Knee jerk reactions"" are the only ones with a chance of working."
12978,"If Omicron spreads as quickly as is feared, then the flight ban is warranted."
12979,"Unfortunately, the reality is it's probably already too late."
12980,&gt;Why feared?
12981,We have no information yet on lethality or vaccine effectiveness.
12982,"When people talk about being reactive instead of proactive, this is what a reactive strategy looks like."
12983,Why wait for the data to find out you're screwed when you could take action two weeks sooner and prevent the problem from getting worse?
12984,Why should we wait for the numbers to find out we did the right thing?
12985,I completely agree!
12986,But I’m glad we are being proactive and shutting down travel until we find out.
12987,It’s a nice change of pace from waiting until we are 100% sure on something and then acting too late.
12988,If it turns out to be less than we are worried about then we can reopen travel and not much is lost.
12989,But if it turns out to be worse than we need to buy ourselves all the time we can.
12990,No idea but I did read today if a vaccine booster is required one can be delivered in about 100 days.
12991,I wish I was an vaccine manufacturer this day and age.
12992,Should.
12993,But won’t.
12994,90% of cases in SA are O... Its a 1 in novemdecillion (or decillion if you use the long scale) chance that 0 in 60 had the O variety.
12995,Just got my 3rd shot of Pfizer.
12996,How long should I wait to get a flu shot ?
12997,[removed]
12998,Must be those gruelling 4-hour work weeks.
12999,Showing the (still pretty sanitized) horrors of war helped turn the public consciousness against the Vietnam war.
13000,Maybe we need to see these people dying in their own fluid on the nightly news for it to sink in.
13001,Where's the data?
13002,"I haven't had a cold or the flu since I started wearing a mask in public, think I will keep doing that."
13003,Especially here stateside after all the shit Trump got for doing it - it’s just dumb.
13004,My guess is if we are seeing it in test more than likely we will see it in the community.
13005,My hope is this will be a quick and painless variant.
13006,"Lol, k."
13007,"Considering that the Belgium case is in a person who arrived there from Egypt on November *12th* (according to sources provided by Dr John Campbell), it is pretty much guaranteed to be already spreading in the wild in the US."
13008,And in a ton of other countries too.
13009,"It being in Egypt on November 12th, means that it has been kicking around for weeks longer than it's being reported right now."
13010,I'm not trying to be alarmist here.
13011,"We still don't know a lot about it, including how severe a reaction it causes in humans."
13012,But it does seem quite a bit more contagious than the delta variant.
13013,And authorities in Southern Africa have been downplaying it.
13014,I'm very glad other world leaders are jumping on this to try to slow it down.
13015,"But even assuming the travel bans are thorough (spoiler: they're not really), it might be too little too late."
13016,"\&gt; “And ‘Xi’ was not used because it is a common last name.”

this is outright false."
13017,It doesn’t even crack top 100 among \[common Chinese last names\] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_common\_Chinese\_surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames)).
13018,NY Time’s comment on speculation that this is done in deference to the Chinese president is a much more likely explanation.
13019,"because it's a 3 dose series, so they need their 3rd dose."
13020,"They don't have it, which is why they are concerned."
13021,Lmao dude you’re living in another reality.
13022,I knew somebody that was in NYC recently and they only had to show their vax card once the entire time.
13023,You're spreading misinformation.
13024,https://mobile.twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1464358265425481729
13025,"With the magnitude of travel in and out of the US, there is zero chance it is not in the US already."
13026,I agree with this.
13027,I had a negative covid test a while back but had a slight cough so I wore a mask in public just to be kind to others.
13028,I support that for sure.
13029,[removed]
13030,Triple vaccinated?
13031,The current booster dose or the one that's gonna be adapted to that variant?
13032,"see, this is what concerns me."
13033,"Yes the vaccines are working and you didn't die, but you have Long Covid, and as someone with it myself, it is fucking bonkers to me that people think Long Covid is a decent outcome here."
13034,I'm so sorry you've gone through this.
13035,[removed]
13036,It's a problem for us (vaxxed) as well unfortunately
13037,"When a relatively less deadly and significantly more contagious variant outcompetes the current variant, which will fast-track us to endemicity."
13038,[removed]
13039,Completely agreed.
13040,I travel a lot for work and it sucks.
13041,The longer I have to keep this up the more pissed off I’ll become.
13042,It’s why I really can’t stand the rebuttals here along the lines of “it’s not difficult stop whining”.
13043,They’re missing the point: it’s the mental fatigue of constantly doing the right thing and having to still put up with interventions for the sake of others who can’t be bothered.
13044,Asking the virologists amongst us: Is there any rough estimate of how long it will take to determine the efficacy of the current vaccines against Omicron?
13045,[removed]
13046,No.
13047,They need to stop lying to themselves that what they’ve been doing is effective and that news of a new variant will cause pro-COVID anti-vaxxers to line up for a shot.
13048,"The reality is, I’m not sure who can reach the people so far down the rabbit hole of misinformation."
13049,Certainly it needs to be someone other than public health officials or elected politicians.
13050,The problem is the people spreading misinformation (like Candace Owens and  Joe Rogan) are benefiting from solidifying clout and an obedient power base.
13051,They are never going to tell their followers to get vaccinated.
13052,"This much is obvious, but we literally know nothing about hospitalization rates for Omicron."
13053,It could even be considerably less than Delta.
13054,Sounds like something a Texan would say
13055,It really doesn’t.
13056,"But if people find some amusement in guessing, let them have it."
13057,Something has to distract.
13058,Im surprised they aren't requiring NAAT tests for international travelers.
13059,Heading to Hawaii next week from within the states and it's a requirement to have a negative result no more than 72 hours in advance of boarding the flight.
13060,Italy has one case of Omicron variant https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1464658574106189825
13061,"Fully vaccinated and boosted, I'm wearing my mask because it's flu season here even though I've had this years flu shot."
13062,"It's a minor inconvenience, easily tolerated."
13063,"Fair point, but that skepticism should be solved by a 5 minute conversation with their doctor."
13064,It's not a political topic.
13065,"You don't discuss the keys of a vaccine at a political rally, you discuss it in a doctor's office."
13066,Long covid is still a pretty bad outcome and the vaccines cut down the chance of that a lot less than they do hospitalisation/death.
13067,[removed]
13068,"Basically, no."
13069,I'm on a packed train right now - standing room only - and there's only me and one other person wearing one.
13070,55 years
13071,hey everyone!
13072,I had a Mild case (pre-vaccine obviously) and still have a steroid inhaler and lung problems!
13073,21 months later.
13074,We really need to be looking into the chances of getting Long Covid after getting an infection while vaccinated.
13075,"When the original comment said ""asymptomatic or mild"" I don't think they had in mind ""horribly suffering for weeks but not hospitalized"""
13076,A Professor from SAGE also said he's been really disappointed with the fearmongering including peers using phrases like 'horrific' without any significant data.
13077,"People don't want a fully lockdown, which works the best."
13078,So the government make some compromise.
13079,"Even if the government did something else, another group of people will be mad."
13080,Narrator: it was.
13081,Source?
13082,Riiiiight!
13083,Cause this is gonna change their minds.
13084,"I only my edited the part that says *edited*

Also bro, Pfizer Aline made 37 billion in profit."
13085,After 37 fucking billions in profit in one quarter but you still want to argue that vaccines aren’t profitable .
13086,Lol.
13087,"*oh but now they just returning to new infectious diseases*
Ffs after billions in profit I would too."
13088,"Not are you only admitting that they only do stuff for profit (like every other company), you let acting like over 40 billions in profit doesn’t exist lol 

Are you innocent?"
13089,No company does stuff if it’s not profitable.
13090,That’s how things work.
13091,Also I didn’t said that governments didn’t finance some  of it but it’s residual.
13092,And they also finance it because the governments needs pharma companies and all the lobbying associated with it.
13093,Also governments can’t do much since they can’t just force private companies to do what they ask if they don’t threat them well.
13094,It’s almost like a game of power where pharma companies want benefits and acess to taxpayers money and the government want acess to health technology so they can keep the people satisfied.
13095,Still can’t understand what the hell socialism has to do with any of this.
13096,What I don’t get is they say the vac wouldnt exist without trumps magic but that it is also a democrat hoax.
13097,How can both be true?
13098,And you obviously understand the situation better than all the world leaders and the scientists advising them.
13099,"Learn things, read."
13100,Jfc…
13101,"They are not vaxxed, and they had like 4-6 days sick, but last timed different, muscles pain, fatigue is more than the two last times, headache and fever, just to let you know they don’t respect any mesures ; gathering, no mask no distance.."
13102,It's not and I don't
13103,I think that’s a good approach.
13104,"I’d like to think that people will do the right thing and stay home if they’re sick, but already I’ve already proven people can’t be trusted."
13105,"Guy came into my office despite clearly looking sick, tested positive the next day and ultimately got a couple others sick."
13106,"It’s just not worth it if you’re sick, don’t bring it on anyone else because you’re in denial about being sick."
13107,You can only find new variants with PCR tests if you’re varient testing positive PCR samples.
13108,"Ie; when you get the “wild type” result it’s usually a bad thing, because each variant test looks for the traits of a given variant."
13109,"So if you’re variant testing for delta and the response is non-specific, that’s picking up similarities to the original virus."
13110,As for full recognition; that’s sequencing.
13111,Where the virus is first discovered is not necessarily its source.
13112,We know nothing about it and yet countries are reacting like its March 2020.
13113,"We have vaccines, we have masks, we have testing abilities."
13114,Overreacting is just as bad as reacting too slowly.
13115,There are reasonable measures to put in place until we know more about the virus.
13116,SA has released information stating all of their cases to this point are mild and they believe vaccines are still working against it.
13117,It’s not that simple.
13118,"If 1/1000 people are hospitalized with either variant, but 10x more people are infected with omicron then that’s still 10x the strain on the hospitals."
13119,Note: those aren’t the real numbers I’m just using them to explain the potential risk.
13120,They are implying they're not actually experts in the field of predicting unvaccinated people's behaviors.
13121,Stop federal funding to states that are not helping.
13122,Is that an option?
13123,"Seems like it's speculation, not necessarily proven and pinned to one specific person."
13124,"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/26/vaccine-resistant-what-scientists-know-new-covid-variant

13126,I know people that have gotten the J&amp;J 1 shot and both shots of Pfizer and Moderna so it could mean anything really.
13127,Is it just more contagious or does it have a higher mortality?
13128,Yeah…this isn’t because we did anything correct.
13129,We let the Delta variant ravage us all summer long.
13130,"If and when Omicron comes, if it’s as transmissible as they say it could be, Florida will be right back where it was."
13131,13th is lowest?
13132,"Ahh, another post for r/agedlikemilk"
13133,And frustration.
13134,I had about 3 weeks of feeling comfortable in society after my first two doses then Delta hit.
13135,I had my booster 3 weeks ago and here we go again.
13136,"Oh well, poor me."
13137,I'm still healthy and I'm happy about that and I am grateful for the vaccines.
13138,"I really feel bad for health care workers, I'm not sure how much longer many of them will hang in there."
13139,"A lot of federal employee deadlines for mandatory vaccinations are also hitting, and noncompliants are starting to see disciplinary action and are realizing that the Government wasn't bluffing about termination and are getting their butts in gear to get stuck."
13140,"Vaccination helps reduce the amount of spreading by quite a lot, it's the best we have."
13141,"Like I said there's no end to this in sight, we can't just lock ourselves up for decades."
13142,Oh my god NO
13143,If only there was a way to prevent that … like … NOT TRAVELING DURING A PANDEMIC!
13144,Not impressed with Mr. Biden.
13145,"First, we know that Omicron was first identified in South Africa, not that it developed there."
13146,It is throughout Northern Europe.
13147,"Second, we need to close our borders."
13148,Completely.
13149,"Too little, too late, too slow."
13150,"Yes, we need to move products."
13151,There is no place for recreational traffic in a pandemic.
13152,No one week delays.
13153,Close.
13154,"This is about public health, not politics."
13155,We need real leadership along the lines of FDR fireside chats.
13156,We need a plan everyone understands.
13157,We need enforcement of vaccine and mask mandates.
13158,We need a national RealID compliant vaccine credential.
13159,We need people to STFH and cook for themselves.
13160,We need 90% vaccination.
13161,We need the business community to support curbside pickup for everything.
13162,Some people HAVE to go to work and can't be remote; running out to Starbucks for coffee is not essential and adds risk to those who must go to work.
13163,Vaxx + mask + distance + curbside + STFH.
13164,LOL.
13165,Experts don't understand Americans.
13166,😴😴😴
13167,[removed]
13168,I did them at the same time
13169,Nah.
13170,Covid started in china.
13171,Those studies were quite flawed.
13172,If Covid had indeed started way earlier in Italy we would have noticed it’s effects.
13173,"We didn’t though, because it started in china."
13174,I really truly hope that the people in charge learn that this tactic does not work.
13175,Because IF this is faked (as anti vaxxers said) then this is the wrong tactic to use and the attempt to scare people into the right action will not work.
13176,"When it's revealed how BAD this is, people are too tired to care."
13177,"This is not the fifth wave, this is the true second part of covid."
13178,And we still have the third act to go.
13179,And if omicron is there and it hasn't been found in testing yet it would likely mean that delta is still the more dominant strain.
13180,However it more likely means omicron is just not there yet
13181,My fully vaxxed and boosted but immune suppressed ass is gonna have to keep teaching for 10 hours a day in an N95.
13182,I had switched to more comfortable cloth and surgical masks but it looks like those days are over for now.
13183,My B and T cells are fantastically incompetent.
13184,This is such a clueless question lol
13185,"Uh, if you test positive you absolutely should be isolating."
13186,What kind of question is this?

13225,I don’t disagree.
13226,Still though I prefer this culture to the alternative
13227,"&gt;	the news is taking the opportunity to blast out that we’re back to March 2020, without any science claiming that."
13228,Show me one news article that has said this.
13229,Just one.
13230,"Yep, just in time for me to take my first business trip to the states since covid.."
13231,It's not even pronounced the same.
13232,"""horribly suffering for weeks but not hospitalized"" is not a high percentage."
13233,You’re also missing the vast numbers of people who never notice they have it.
13234,"Given how common it is to pick up a cold while traveling by air, I’m skeptical how well all of that works."
13235,[removed]
13236,Lol the world isn’t “struggling” to contain Omicron.
13237,It’s barely even trying.
13238,Stopping direct flights to South Africa (but not countries that haven’t similarly stopped these direct flights) can’t be considered anything more than repainting a crumbling foundation.
13239,"A big part of the problem is that our response to Covid had been a lot like that Simpson’s meme, [“We’ve tried nothing and we’re all out of ideas”."
13240,](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/PEWONvY)
13241,I'm fairly certain I had covid last march (similar symptoms to what I have now) near the beginning of the pandemic.
13242,I've also been double vaxxed since August.
13243,Just this week I've been tested positive for covid again.
13244,"Considering I'm double vaxxed, it's proper hit me like a brick so I'm thinking it may be this omicron variant."
13245,I think only a small number of positive cases are sent on for variant testing.
13246,So we could have loads of omicron variant in the UK already and just wouldn't know.
13247,[removed]
13248,This is not true.
13249,There isn't data yet.
13250,This is *possible* but incredibly unlikely.
13251,No booster shots.
13252,Had we been eligible we would not have hesitated.
13253,ok thanks i didn't know about the situation in SA

13260,been saying this to my family for a while -- the only way we're ever going to hit 90% vaccination in the US is when the unvaccinated start dying off enough to drop their % from 30ish to 10. unfortunately it won't happen quick enough to avoid the hospitals getting overwhelmed.
13261,[removed]
13262,"Of course it’s already here, you’d be daft to think it wasn’t"
13263,"Get your first,  second,  or third vaccine dose."
13264,J&amp;Js is also a newer platform.
13265,Not sure where the idea that it wasn't came from.
13266,(Which isn't to say newer = worse or more risk or anything.
13267,"Just correcting this meme I see often that j&amp;k is the ""old"" method of vaccine)"
13268,Toilet paper and ammunition was impossible to find.
13269,Maybe we can move from 3.4% to 2% mortality rate.
13270,That would put it down to a flu.
13271,"better safe than sorry...or do you want another reactionary situation where it's already surging and people are clogging up hospitals, while the south and the right throw another denialism hissy fit?"
13272,"But at the same time, they want us all back in offices."
13273,The governor can't have it both ways.
13274,"Antibodies are for active infections, t-cells for long term immunity."
13275,T-cells will recognize any variant and will work with any variant.
13276,"How the media only focuses on antibodies is nothing short than either stupid, or fearmongering."
13277,"South Africa had very few cases at the time this variant started spreading, so there wasn't much competition."
13278,Direct flights to Vancouver from South Africa.
13279,... until now.
13280,I did not get sick for the year and a half I wore a mask.
13281,"I ended up getting covid in mid October of this year, probably from the one time I took off my mask to eat on the plane 😢."
13282,I am fully vaccinated with the Pfizer doses and I can only imagine that what I got was a new variant.
13283,However it can take several tests to catch it.
13284,HK travelers were found positive after 4th test.
13285,Coincidentally been watching transformers this week and feeling creeped out by that haha
13286,Right?
13287,How do you expect the world to listen to you when your own house is in disarray?
13288,"Florida was second in the country in total cases per capita 6 weeks ago, but now the state has dropped to 13th"
13289,"Tl;Dr:
FDA put a clinical hold on the EUA for the children's version of Covaxin being marketed in the USA by Ocugen."
13290,FDA will provide a list of flaws in the application for Ocugen to address.
13291,the question then is how can it outperform delta in SA
13292,"Watch the next two weeks, particularly in Africa."
13293,It could end up being more infectious but less severe than Delta or vanilla COVID.
13294,"Delta isn’t prevalent in South Africa though, so I don’t know if you can draw that conclusion just yet."
13295,Probably delta.
13296,Honestly.
13297,They changed the definition of fully vaccinated to 3 shots.
13298,Hope you get well soon.
13299,and US cdc is one of the worst countries at sequencing.
13300,Also keep and eye in the age of people who die if you start seeing mid age people dying more than the old we have a major problem the 1918 spanish flu killed more of the middle aged then old and young
13301,"This is a massive inconvenience over Christmas, I've got friends coming who are only in the country for 4 days might not even be worth it now."
13302,"Hey I agree, you just left out an important part when criticizing the other guy."
13303,[removed]
13304,Somebody set up us the omicron
13305,[removed]
13306,"This will be all over the world soon, if not all ready."
13307,the question then is how can it outperform delta in SA
13308,[removed]
13309,Will humanity still exist by the time we get to Omega?
13310,"Yes, usually the more transmissible it is, the less virulent it is."
13311,Viruses want to survive and not kill thier host because the virus dies with the host.
13312,"Therefore, it is in the best interest of the virus to eventually mutate in a way where it is contagious but not deadly."
13313,"Remember, viruses do not have brains to think ""I want to destroy humantiy!"""
13314,Viruses just want to survive.
13315,"This could actually be good news, if it means it is less virulent."
13316,We just don't know yet.
13317,Nobody is afraid of a cold!
13318,Strange.
13319,Is this a typo or perhaps those numbers are not always unique?
13320,[removed]
13321,[removed]
13322,The point is that if COVID-19 mutates enough that it evades the vaccination or natural immunity entirely then it will also lose its ability to infect people.
13323,"Square peg, round hole."
13324,Deaths take a while to show up in counts too.
13325,"Or at least where I’m located, theyre not usually added the day they die."
13326,"It’s a wait and see game, which the media, public officials, and everyone else reasonably hates."
13327,"We've had our return to office date pushed back so many times, I don't even think they have a schedule announced at this point."
13328,"When have the words ""Africa is doing alright without vaccines"" EVER been true?"
13329,[removed]
13330,"If they skipped ""Nu"", then shouldn't it be called ""Xi""?"
13331,Wasnt New Zealand able to use travel restrictions to great effect?
13332,This is a natural evolution for an especially virulent virus.
13333,"When it kills its host too quickly, often a variant that makes its host sick enough to replicate itself will eventually out-compete the very virulent kind."
13334,"I'm not sure this is at play here, since covid isn't that deadly, all things considered, and the damage it does is like a bomb exploding."
13335,"By the time the worse of the effects are felt, the virus has stopped replicating anyway"
13336,I'm really hoping for golf rules
13337,"No, it's because the US sent ambassadors to Taiwan."
13338,You can thank China for the dip in the Dow.
13339,"The market doesn't give a single fuck about covid, they've all gotten richer during this crisis."
13340,I want out of this timeline.
13341,"Someone, load the old save and choose differently"
13342,sounds to me like the rich-ass countries got vaccinated with a vaccine that targeted a very specific mechanism of the virus and now the virus has evolved a new mechanism while on holiday in the poor-ass countries.
13343,Maybe we should create multiple vaccines that target multiple mechanisms so the probabilities of the virus evolving a new mechanisms are low enough so we have time to vaccinate the entire planet.
13344,This is all terrible.
13345,Eventually there will be a strain that evades the vaccines and we will bet at booster shot # 56 at that point.
13346,[removed]
13347,Why would Jesus weep?
13348,Didn't he and God make this and allow this to happen?
13349,"Good one, open with a joke"
13350,My normal is traveling internationally a lot between North America and Asia unfortunately.
13351,Because it gets them views and clicks?
13352,When has the media ever talked about variants without click bait titles?
13353,[removed]
13354,If it causes spiders to crawl out of your ass would be even worse.
13355,WHO CARES KEEP LOCKING DOWN PLEASE
13356,Why is omnicron getting so much more news coverage over other previous variants of concern?
13357,"I remember people through Mu, Lambda, and delta plus were going to be super serious and vaccine defying but ended up not having much of an impact… what makes this one so much different?"
13358,"I’ve been vaccinated, I get my booster in two weeks (they were booked out until then), I wear a mask in public, and i socially distance as much as possible."
13359,What else does the world want me to do?
13360,I’m so exhausted with Covid.
13361,"I was looking forward to 2022 but Omicron really said, “nah”."
13362,"Not sure about SA, but in India during the Delta wave  it was cheaper to buy a fake negative test than to actually take the test."
13363,I was advocating focusing on ourselves instead of making comparisons with other countries.
13364,"The Americans have nothing to do with it, you are the only one in this thread making the comparison in order to defend your beliefs."
13365,Unfortunately there's even a chance the opposite happens.
13366,"Omicron turns out to be a sprinkle instead of the big hurricane, and anti-vaxxers just keep on being dumb."
13367,"Your best course of action with covid is to be vaxxed, but the world can't do much about the stubbornly stupid."
13368,[removed]
13369,[removed]
13370,Omicron: Challenge accepted
13371,"What has not been ""of concern"" these past 2 years almost ?"
13372,The supply issues would've been even worse.
13373,[removed]
13374,"Even if it has a higher breakthrough factor, it needs to be hospitalizing people at a rate higher than Delta to justify continued travel bans or lockdowns etc."
13375,Too early to tell but I guess we'll know in a couple of weeks both from the manufacturers and from the rate at which those testing positive today actually wind up in hospital.
13376,Yep!
13377,Especially considering that we don't actually have evidence that the vaccines are ineffective against Omicron.
13378,The only reason people believe that is due to criminally irresponsible reporting that capitalizes on the general public's limited scientific literacy.
13379,This gives back my lost hope.
13380,Thanks.
13381,[removed]
13382,"Yup, it's all about risk and cost-benefit analysis on a personal level."
13383,"At this point, we've been dealing with the pandemic for almost two years straight."
13384,It's exhausting.
13385,"I personally am still living like a recluse 95% of the time (and am still very careful the times I do socialize or travel), but I have friends who now regularly go to bars and dance classes with strangers."
13386,Will I do that?
13387,No.
13388,But I recognize that it's impossible to for everyone to live like a recluse.
13389,"I'm not even sure how much longer I can go like this, but for now, as long as I take calculated risks and protect myself and others to the best of my ability, I don't feel guilty."
13390,Especially when there are other people who shop maskless and antagonize mask wearers.
13391,"My understanding is that infection immunity is broader (attacks more parts of the virus) but it varies widely from person to person so you can’t count on it, and vaccinations reliably invoke immunity."
13392,https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1442930233796034560
13393,Booster vaccines effective on this strain will be announced shortly and everything will be fine.
13394,No need for any panic or full lockdown.
13395,Just continue wearing masks for everyone.
13396,She could have phrased it a bit differently.
13397,"Bottom line, it's good to be cautious and investigative when it comes to Omicron, but we don't need to be hoarding toilet paper just yet."
13398,This pandemic is full of surprises!
13399,[removed]
13400,When I was in Mexico my resort did a rapid test where they barely put it up my nose and gave me a negative result a minute later.
13401,From what I've heard no one ever tests positive as no resort what's to be known as the one that gives positive results.
13402,They could have just gotten their tests at facilities that operate in the same manner in SA.

13415,"Nu-Covid......

Fred Durst is getting excited."
13416,Right that’s why lockdowns happened when Delta hit a couple months back at first…
13417,It may exist in those countries at very low levels but it’s not responsible for a significant number of cases.
13418,It would have been picked up in genomic sequencing by now.
13419,These curfew style lockdowns seem like they may do more harm than good.

13904,No it won't.
13905,Not even close.
13906,"Pretty much now, wearing a mask and a vaccine seems to be the answer currently for current and possibly future strains."
13907,"Once more data comes out that boosters will help gradually against this, mask and vaccine will be here to stay."
13908,"I feel most people are fatigued now, did everything like double mask and double vac, and are now just getting around to getting a booster shot that was pretty much just green lit for everyone, not just the most vulnerable."
13909,"Debates about if we should wear masks, take vaccines, abide by rules, etc."
13910,definitely wore on me to the point where I’ve given up on trying to change others’ minds.
13911,If they voluntarily want to get sick it’s on them.
13912,If most wear masks and take the vaccine at its most preferred level (currently boosters) fear of new strains for the most part diminish.
13913,"If it turns out this just claps the old double vax and the current booster, it’ll just be 2020 all over again while we impatiently or patiently wait for Covid vaccine patch."
13914,Wouldn’t be surprised if we play this game every six months or so.
13915,It’s starting to shape up in society like the flu has where most new strains just get covered by the yearly shot.
13916,Some years one gets through but luckily with the flu there’s backup procedures.
13917,Once similar ones come for Covid (antiviral pill or something) it will really start feeling like how we deal with the flu.
13918,It really might turn out that way given the massive spread of mutations to spike alone.
13919,"Might be able to infect and spread faster but not as effective at replicating, allowing the innate response to take hold without being overwhelmed."
13920,Perhaps lower viral loads.

13941,Travels bans for china were quick and uncontroversial.
13942,"So I’m not going to call myself “very smart,” but I have a tiny fraction of the education that those folks have."
13943,I spent a year of my life as a virologist (not working on any human virus) and I have two degrees in molecular biology.
13944,This virus has taught us things we didn’t know about coronaviruses in general and specifically about the spike.
13945,"It’s really hard to make a good prediction about how a single amino acid change is going to affect the virus’s behavior, let alone 23 changes."
13946,One thing that is true in Biology is that Nothing In Life Is Free.
13947,There are very few examples of mutations in organisms that offer all benefits and no costs.
13948,This spike came from many rounds of reproduction and optimization.
13949,"To have this many changes will almost certainly impact the overall function of the spike, which is to 1) bind to a cell surface and 2) fuse the viral membrane with the cell membrane, in that order."
13950,"The machinery to allow this is flexible, but not infinitely so."
13951,You can’t just change any amino acid to any other amino acid.
13952,Some of those changes will make the spike work less well.
13953,"It’s difficult to model exactly what evolutionary forces would have given rise to this variant, but it may be that person-to-person transmission wasn’t one of those pressures."
13954,But we are nowhere near a point of being able to read the sequence of the spike and accurately predicting how the variant will behave.
13955,Cant be that much because it can be recognized easily from PCR tests
13956,Merry Christmas to you too!
13957,Well said.
13958,Travel bans shouldn't drag on either because they're a serious disincentives to honest reporting - they're okay as a sort of circuit breaker but don't make much public health sense at all for variants that have clearly been circulating for ages.
13959,"In the end it's all about virulence and hospitalisation here, even higher transmissibility isn't the end of the world if it isn't much worse than Delta in terms of breakthrough infections leading to sickness and death."

14004,Japan ( and other Asian countries like Korea and China) have a HUGE mask culture that began many many years ago (even before the sars epidemic).
14005,"Just watch Asian drama and you'll see that is a cultural norm that people with a cold/flu will wear one as to no infect anybody else, many use them just for covering their faces from the cold/ other people's eyes, for alergies and even just for style."
14006,It's a whole different culture.

14032,way too politically biased for my taste but you do you
14033,So would far less advanced medical care combined with less comorbidities just canceled each other out?
14034,Which one was responsible for more deaths?
14035,You're also judging the entire Spanish Flu pandemic against only a partial Covid one.
14036,We will likely be getting new variants and waves for a least a few more years.
14037,"Excess deaths from Covid suggest the death toll could be already more than 20 million, which is already within the lower estimate range for Spanish Flu (estimates aren't universally agreed upon for SF)."
14038,"Who knows what the totals will look like after all this is finally over, so I think it's far too early to make a judgement call on which one is ultimately worse."
14039,"As for Covid only killing older people, I don't think that really matters to those people, or to their families."
14040,Death is not more tragic just because it happens to a younger person.

14064,"While it did not discuss the duration of protection, it did find that fully vaccinated individuals developed robust anamnestic antibody and T cell responses following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant

A recent [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.23.21266574v1) also concluded that the combination of natural infection and vaccination provides maximal protection against new infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that prior vaccination does not impair this protection."

14126,"So yea, it's contagious, no one is arguing that."

14168,"do you think that based on numbers that you see in hong kong, south africa, and other countries you can make a guess about the US impact or will each country have to wait for their own major cycles to have an accurate guess?"
14169,rapid tests are inaccurate already and likely more inaccurate when finding omicron.

14194,These experts don’t seem to understand the people they are dealing with.
14195,Are you looking at the age-adjusted graph?
14196,Seniors are most likely to have a severe case.
14197,They’re also most likely to be vaccinated.
14198,So you need to adjust the results to fairly compare hospitalisation rates in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
14199,The graph has done that.
14200,They are NOT the actual rates of hospitalisation in the real world.
14201,"It’s for a pretend population, where  70yr old and 18yr olds are equally likely to be vaccinated in each of those months."
14202,Similar problems in France.
14203,Even with a centralised system the breakdown is that nobody verifies the name on the QR when scanned with an official ID.
14204,So you go into a restaurant and they scan your QR code but there all they do.
14205,There is nothing to stop someone from registering a friends (or anyone else’s) valid vaccination certificate and using it.
14206,The system relies on the name displayed when it’s scanned as being the same as the persons ID but if you don’t check the ID it is essentially useless.
14207,Apparently most places don’t have the “authority” to ask for ID which is the problem.
14208,From what I’ve read only places like nightclubs that do have authority to check IDs bother to verify.
14209,I know this because my selfish sister in law has been using her friends vaccination certificate registered on *her* phone whenever she is asked for her covid pass 😡

14213,"I have a friend, 30 years old, super fit, who got Covid last year working a Frontline job."
14214,He had trouble walking to his bathroom and back to bed.

14216,He was like this for 5 weeks.
14217,"That was still ""mild"" which is an insane use of the world."
14218,We need some better tiers for classifying the severity.

14227,if the infected passed through the long lines at Heathrow arrivals then it will already have a wide dispersion.
14228,Wait and hope.
14229,Huh?
14230,"In terms of case numbers, yeah, I’d say estimates should change."
14231,Anyone coming up with concrete numbers though at this stage is being foolish – we haven’t been good at predicting the precise scale and timing of spikes even with the old variants.
14232,"Now whether we have entered a different phase in terms of impact on hospitals, etc., is too early to tell because we just do not know whether this causes more, equal, or less severe symptoms."
14233,"Barring information that we will have soon enough as the first major cycles of people being infected progress through illness, one should basically assume equal health impact and increased transmission and adjust their winter expectations accordingly."
14234,But stay tuned over the next weeks.

14259,You need to look up what positivity rate means.
14260,It does not mean they test people at random in the country.
14261,It means the percentage of people who get tested whoprobably already have symptoms which is why they are testing in the first place.
14262,Something is seriously off with these numbers in South Africa.
14263,The size change would be readily detected by anyone who knows how to read a qPCR.

14281,Ironic.
14282,You don't know that the day people test positive; it takes weeks to determine outcome.
14283,Omicron's virulence is something we aren't going to have any kind of estimate on for at least another week.
14284,I'm old enough to remember when people like you were optimistic about Delta.

14292,"Yes, if the vaccines are still effective."
14293,"No, if it evades vaccines and still has even a lower morbidity or mortality rate, could overwhelm our health care systems"
14294,São Paulo city just reached 100% of the adult population fully vaccinated as well.
14295,And it will exceed 100% slightly due to outdated census and population projection.
14296,"Here is an actual comment on a thread about the new variant here:

&gt; Shouldn’t these mask mandates be kept in place permanently?"
14297,It seems like the virus isn’t going away and the best we can do is just wear masks when we leave our homes.
14298,Comments like this are disgusting and harm public health.

14326,I was freaking out.
14327,Less severe is good!
14328,No we are going back to Season 1.
14329,It's primarily infected children so it's impossible to really know at this point.
14330,Depends on just how mild it is.
14331,"If it's more mild but it spreads much, MUCH easier than Delta, more people would get sick and die as a net total."
14332,Yes this has been considered one of the hypothetical endings of the pandemic
14333,Pretty sure that's more or less been debunked.
14334,There are actually a lot of facilities capable of manufacturing the vaccines but can't because of the patent restrictions
14335,I've had 3 shots and I'm ok!
14336,I'm high risk and I would sure appreciate it 😊
14337,"The good news then is at the very least, it seems to be *as* deadly."
14338,"More deadly can probably be safely ruled out, which is a big sigh of relief."
14339,"Well, how many of.them are symptomatic?"
14340,"And if the number is known, how many are mild cases?"
14341,Lethal enough for the whole world to go into lockdown
14342,It still mutates with another evolutionary challenge in it's face.
14343,"It's more complicated, but as Delta reduced the effectiveness of the first vaccine, the tendency should be to further reduce that."
14344,The next step would likely be to develop a new better targeted vaccine.
14345,someone please convince me to get the vaccine…I want to get it but i’m scared with all the things you hear.
14346,Don’t judge pls
14347,This will or will not evade the vaccine.
14348,We will know in 2 weeks.
14349,This short term impact is going to be the reason for a good sell own and cash holders will rush in to snap up the deals of the year on stocks.

14360,Most of the transmission happens before you realize you’re sick.
14361,Covid was and is gonna get around one way or the other.
14362,But it completely killed all the new nu variant English jokes.
14363,I already have the new/nu Drake meme posted on fb.
14364,Gort understand.
14365,"I was kinda hoping this would be the case after delta...

How many variants and deaths will it take?"
14366,People also start to get increasingly number and number as time progresses.
14367,"Remember how everyone was freaking out for the first two months and then nobody even bat an eye when beta came, which was like twice as infectious?"
14368,"Most COVID cases are mild, including those caused by Delta."
14369,Just because most people with this new strain have mild symptoms does not necessarily mean it’s less deadly than other strains.
14370,Meh
14371,So the booster is useless since protection against hospitalization is still good with the first two shots?
14372,Maybe you don’t remember the furor that erupted over England not closing the border quickly enough on Delta.
14373,The reaction to Omnicrom is undeniably faster than the response to other variants.
14374,"The UK couldn’t close its border to Alpha because it arose, or was at least identified, there."
14375,Maybe one day people will learn

14386,South Africa has a very low vaccination rate across all demographics.
14387,This is most likely explained by SA's median age being very low (i.e.
14388,they have a lot of young people).
14389,What is wrong with you?
14390,I don't think this falls under ACA's protections of pre-existing conditions.
14391,Not vaccinating is not a pre-existing condition.
14392,Same lol
14393,"They are allowed because they are requested negative tests in most destinations 
How are vaccinated allowed to travel without showing a negative tests in many instances?"
14394,It’s ok to bring the virus on board if you are vaccinated?
14395,technique or practice of responding to an accusation by making raising a different issue.

14397,They were recording lowest levels since start of pandemic so id say not exactly.
14398,Not to our level
14399,I’ll get boosters as recommended but not social distancing or wearing a mask (except where required).
14400,Scotland?
14401,The late symptoms might have nothing to do with the variant at all and more to do with her body itself.
14402,The average number of days for symptoms to show is just an average.
14403,I wouldn’t be too worried.
14404,Do we actually want to 100 million people who just barley survived due to ventilation in our population going forward?
14405,"OK, dumb question."
14406,"If a variant of a virus with more successful propagation rates tends to wipe out competing variants, couldn't a milder version of the virus that just spreads better actually improve the situation?"
14407,"Hypothetically speaking, not suggesting that's what we're observing."
14408,In to the pit.
14409,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdK-OuEJ8fI
14410,This is a kind of pedantry that not even expert epidemiologists employ and is really just pretentious.
14411,Epidemiologists themselves speak of viruses as having the goal of maximizing their genetic replication and form hypotheses about virus behavior on the basis of that goal.
14412,"On that basis, a virus does not want its host to die too quickly if doing so would inhibit its ability to replicate, and often times that is the consequence."
14413,"As a matter of fact, most viruses do not kill their host organism and you are full of viruses that not only benefit you and will continue to live with you for the rest of your life, but if you're a woman will be passed down to your offspring."
14414,Saying that a virus doesn't have a goal is about as senseless as saying that a chess program doesn't think.
14415,"It's a technicality that to someone otherwise uninformed sounds true, but is mostly just posturing."
14416,Can someone please aware why this fear seems to be spreading more panic than even Delta?
14417,"It’s basically only ran rampant in SA, one who’s vaccinate rate is extremely low."
14418,Has it shown to even cause stronger symptoms?
14419,Why the sudden fear of “immune evasion”?
14420,I don’t get it.
14421,Welcome back to Season 1.
14422,Probably will keep getting current vaccine boosters with a new one hopefully soon!
14423,"So pretty much the same as now, but to a greater degree."
14424,That may finally mean we move from wide mandates ('obbligatory' vaccine for all) to targeted ones (mandates/regular boosting only for vulnerable people/elective for everyone else).
14425,Which was always the most sensible approach.
14426,I’m just gonna ask at the risk of downvotes.
14427,Are any Europeans not upset and frustrated with seemingly endless rolling restrictions?
14428,I have tried to look up European exit strategies but found little to none.
14429,Not even discussion about it.
14430,Besides the UK and Sweden (that have no mask mandate) I can’t even find one talking about an end game for masks.
14431,"For those who live there, are people frustrated about this or are they generally fine with it?"
14432,Sorry but  against ACA
14433,"Yep, I'm talking background info."
14434,Here in a few days or so we will have more detailed info on the new variant.
14435,"My guess would be a new even more transmissible variant but not necessarily more virulent, possibly some twists there."
14436,"How well it takes as a world encompassing variant like Delta remains to be seen, but at first blush it seems to have what it takes."
14437,Let's wait and see.
14438,Always need more data.
14439,"So, if this group of 110 passengers on board this plane is at all representative for the population in South Africa, about 13% of people there have corona."

14444,Prepare yourself for bad times and you won't be surprised when they come.
14445,Hes saying exactly the same stuff as the other people who were criticised for using that data set
14446,One way to do it is to have health insurance providers hike premiums for the unvaccinated.

14462,At least 15 passengers from the two KLM flights from South Africa that arrived at Schiphol earlier today have tested positive for the coronavirus.
14463,"The planes carried a total of over 600 passengers, all of whom had to be tested."
14464,"According to the GGD Kennemerland, the first 110 test results have come in, of which 15 are positive."
14465,"Based on that result, the GGD says it expects a ""finding rate"" of 13.6 percent."
14466,"""That means we're taking into account about 85 positive coronavirus tests in total,"" he said."
14467,Which variant of the coronavirus the positively tested travelers were infected with is not yet known.
14468,"Omnikron variant

A no-fly zone has been in effect from South Africa and other countries in southern Africa since 12:00 a.m. because of a new corona variant discovered there."
14469,"It is the so-called omikron variant, which is currently circulating mainly in South Africa and Botswana."
14470,"According to a WHO working group, this variant of the coronavirus appears to be spreading faster than other variants."
14471,"At the time the outgoing cabinet announced the flight ban, there were still two flights from South Africa en route to the Netherlands."
14472,The passengers all had to be tested at Schiphol this afternoon.
14473,Special test lanes were set up at the airport for that purpose.
14474,The travelers who already have a negative result may leave the airport.
14475,"However, they still have to spend five days in home quarantine."
14476,Passengers who tested positive will be transferred to an isolation hotel at or near Schiphol Airport.

14478,"If I remember correctly, spokespeople from South Africa were more concerned with the beta variant last year, compared to this new one."
14479,"Also, if it's very severe and lethal, it becomes easy to contain, because the people don't walk around spreading it."
14480,That's what happened with SARS 1.

14491,"The problem is (which I read on Reddit, so take with a grain of salt) is the 100 days or so of clinical trials."
14492,How many people will get sick during that time?
14493,The R number is a representation of how many people one infected person is infecting.
14494,It changes over time due to a number of factors.
14495,"If the R number is 1, then one person will infect one person and the level of infection/number of cases stays the same."
14496,"If R is less than 1, then 1 infected person will infect fewer than 1 person, so the level of infection/number of cases decreases."
14497,"If R is greater than 1, then 1 infected person will infect more than one person, so the level of infection/number of cases increases."
14498,The UK has been continually using the R number as a measure for the public to quantify and understand the pandemic.
14499,The US hasn’t used R  as a public health tool.

14505,70 per day would grow by something like 70-1240-280-560-1120.
14506,If O was no more contagious it would grow like 1-2-4-8-16.  it would take several super spreader events spreading only O for it to catch up.
14507,The probability of that is roughly 0.

14530,Remember when we were all so optimistic in March and April of this year because everyone was getting vaccinated and we thought the pandemic was coming to an end.
14531,How blissfully ignorant we were
14532,or a moslem shower.
14533,Easier and cheaper to install
14534,"For anyone who wants to learn more about our immune system in a fun way, I really recommend Kurzgesagt videos on the subject."
14535,"They make easy to digest, well animated videos, with hundreds of hours of research going into each one."
14536,"Here's one linked to the training part, or ""Murder University"": [""You Are Immune Against Every Disease"" (473s)](https://youtu.be/LmpuerlbJu0?t=473)

I recommend checking the whole video, and/or series to learn more."
14537,Currently visiting family in the Central Valley; I’d say 1 in 25 is masked.
14538,[removed]
14539,Question: how long does it take to become infected?
14540,Could you have gotten infected on the plane and then tested positive?
14541,Or is that too soon?
14542,"If the latter, shouldn't the whole plane be quarantined?"
14543,"With this variant they’re saying this mutated from a immune compromised person with long covid, so it could be that because there is obviously a ton of immune compromised people due to HIV/AIDS that may be a factor in why they have seen two bigger variants during the pandemic."
14544,Also could be like another redditor below said and they may just have better tech to research new variants
14545,"You don't need to trust your government,  you need to trust scientists."
14546,Your government is only one of many.
14547,There is no global conspiracy of governments that are working for some nefarious agenda.
14548,(As if you could get China and France and Russia and Taiwan and the US to all agree to some secret scheme lol.)
14549,"The situation is frustrating, but giving up won't help, it will make things worse."
14550,"Ignore the politicians,  listen to the science, and remember to focus your anger on the virus and not the people trying to help you"
14551,Yeah.
14552,I'm not sure what the best interpretation of this data point is.
14553,Were most of these people asymptomatic?
14554,I find it hard to believe that so many people would board a plane knowing they were sick.
14555,Were they pre-symptomatic?
14556,"If so, how long are they/were they incubating the virus for?"
14557,What percentage of passengers were vaccinated/had the virus already?
14558,"We know this variant features some degree of immune escape, but how much?"
14559,"If this is a sign of a high degree of asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread, it could also be a sign that the virus is less lethal... and/or also a sign that contact tracing will not be very effective or practical for this variant."
14560,There are a lot of unknowns at this stage.
14561,Boosters are so effective there's no point waiting or worrying about getting the wrong one.
14562,"There is a selection pressure to be less deadly, if your host dies immediately after infection then the virus doesn’t transmit effectively to others and dies out."
14563,Random mutations that allow for more transmission allow it to survive more effectively.
14564,Maybe.
14565,I haven't seen any data on incubation times or hospitalizations.
14566,I think that following these 61 people might be helpful.
14567,"If none of them become seriously I'll, that may be a good sign."
14568,"No, I am tired of covid and need a break."
14569,Can't omicron take one too?
14570,Please.
14571,"As far as I’ve heard previously throughout all this, the UK (I think specifically Oxford?"
14572,Could be wrong) is the world’s center for genome sequencing.
14573,So it’d make sense that they’re the ones catching the different strains
14574,I have reduced lung capacity since catching covid in March 2020 and I find myself getting very out of breath when I wear one.
14575,It's pretty horrible.
14576,So it begins...
14577,I work in healthcare and….yikes…we are already falling apart at the seams
14578,I mean if you barely leave home then I wouldn’t worry about getting boosters
14579,How do people just not know they have such a life threatening disease?
14580,?
14581,All of the airplane passengers had either been tested before the flight or had been vaccinated already.
14582,None of them expected to have covid and all of them were supposed to be symptom-free.
14583,I guess we'll hear soon enough how many of these people get symptoms.
14584,Thank you!
14585,I wasn’t sure because the messaging has been so inconsistent.
14586,"Get a booster or don’t, then you have to wait and see which mix is most effective, or maybe just wait to see if a new one to address the new variant will emerge."
14587,I appreciate this
14588,I genuinely think most people are making it up.
14589,"I’ve been living in a country where everyone, literally everyone around me, wore a mask."
14590,Coming back to the US this fall has been… an experience.
14591,[removed]
14592,For your logic to work there would have to be only one variant spreading at each of the superspreader events.
14593,That would have happened in 2019-2020 (e.g.
14594,when only person at an event was infected at all) but now it would be extremely unlikely.
14595,"And the probability that the ""lucky"" variant would happen to be the new one is about 1 / (# of active cases)."
14596,"All variants have come to our attention because they had some advantage over the locally dominant variant, either immune escape or more contagious or both."
14597,ALL of them.
14598,If they don't have some advantage over the other variant they probably don't even make it out of patient zero's body.
14599,We don't hear about the other variants anymore because delta is 99%+ of all cases.
14600,"I mean, yeah, those are crazy numbers."
14601,BUT it's like 12 hour flight and a plane is fairly close quarters.
14602,So I want some additional context: what kind of masks were the infected wearing?
14603,Were they vaccinated?
14604,"Also, how does this compare to Delta's transmissions on long plane flights?"
14605,And you’re positive all available information is on the public arena?
14606,"You don’t think government officials find things out first, or perhaps hear a *smidge* more than us?"
14607,"I had a giant paragraph typed out, but I don't want to get any of my data wrong."
14608,"So I will just say all I said was hopefully, but I don't really think that will happen."
14609,[removed]
14610,This is smart.
14611,Start making a vaccine immediately when a new concerning variant is found.
14612,"The trials will take a few months, but at least they are wasting no time in idle speculation."
14613,"If this product comes out, it might excite other pharmaceutical companies to update their vaccines as well."
14614,Same.
14615,"Seattle's got its own tourist spots, like Pike Place Market and the Gum Wall."
14616,Pike Place can get pretty packed.
14617,I've played enough Plague Inc. to know it's probably already here
14618,"Eh, point out where they did or stop bashing the media."
14619,We fucking need them and the Guardian is good.

14624,[removed]
14625,Wanting people who don’t want the vaccine to *die* doesn’t make you a better person than them.
14626,"So in order to prevent people from dying from covid, you want the unvaccinated to die from covid?"
14627,Interesting.
14628,Netherlands doesn't require you to take a test before entering their country as long as you're fully vaccinated.
14629,"The lack of data is itself as ""grim"" as what that data itself shows."
14630,With previous VOC's we've lacked data and waited months to get some.
14631,Omicron is spreading so quickly that we simply cannot have any data that tells us anything useful.
14632,Mutation is a numbers game.
14633,"Each time a virus replicates its a roll of the dice, with a small chance of a mutation and a tiny chance of a 'beneficial mutation."
14634,Billions of people each replicating billions of viruses is billions of billions of dice rolls.
14635,The fewer the people that contract it the less likely you are to have a bad luck roll and wind up with a new VOC.
14636,"As I understand it, VOC are most likely to develop in people who are immunocompromised - people who bodies can't fight off the infection but live to be long incubators of virus."
14637,This is one of the prime reasons that we want many people to be vaccinated - to hopefully protect those ticking time bombs from catching it.
14638,"I was a single parent (had a kid young) and she moved out on her own last year.... 

Beginning to doubt I'll ever get to go out/have fun."
14639,"There will be a lot more infected on that flight that aren’t  testing positive yet, if this new variant is as transmissible as feared."
14640,Depends on how deadly this variant is.
14641,If the mortality rate is high then yes.
14642,[removed]
14643,I think we use different definitions of mild if you consider permanent injury to be a consequence of a mild infection.
14644,So you like to stay at home.
14645,Cool.
14646,"That was the realisation that we were wrong, yeah."
14647,So I’m a bit less inclined to treat this one with complacency too because I sure as shit wrong about the last one.
14648,WHO etc all seem to think this one is a big worry.
14649,Oh yeah next to the giant statue of Lara Croft and down the hall from the Pac Man mosaic tiles in the kitchen.
14650,"The transmissibility factor in that scenario is not 100×, the *number of cases* is."
14651,"As they said, viruses spread exponentially."
14652,This exemplifies why higher transmission with lower fatality is not an implicitly favorable change.
14653,I'm shaking in my boots.
14654,-\_- /s
14655,But muh rights (to spread viruses).
14656,"&gt; are expected to provide at least some protection

&gt; astronomically low

Those are two very different statements."
14657,"Because of Oil, or lack of it."
14658,"Europe and most of the world must somehow restrain demand, one way or another."
14659,Why on an American holiday?
14660,"Well, because of $."
14661,"Will Omicron , the biggest of the variants,  not just not just eat the other variants ?"
14662,You lose all credibility because you don't know to use an apostrophe correctly.
14663,Outdoor transmission is not significant under most circumstances.
14664,These packed Christmas markets are a different circumstance.
14665,The entire point of the Greek alphabet names was to *not* associate the variants with specific countries.
14666,There is zero benefit in naming this variant after the Chinese president.
14667,Wait is this the same as Nu?
14668,Did they rename it?
14669,That’s generally what viruses want.
14670,Not to kill their host and to replicate like mad.
14671,Why?
14672,Hell Ape is my favorite band.
14673,Seriously?
14674,Obviously we should wear double masks and cancel school and up social distancing to 1000 feet.
14675,"Right, but this neighbor is acting like COVID is not a big deal bc they don’t personally know anyone who died - when their own neighbor had just died."
14676,We do know that for this virus because Israel has been testing for antibodies as well as breakthrough infection.
14677,Lowered antibodies equals higher rates of infection.
14678,"*waves hands*

14680,"Exactly, this is very, very weird."
14681,Almost can't be possible.
14682,Could it actually be due to the fact that Omnikron is so virulent that they got infected at the beginning of the flight and now tested positive after 12 hours of flying?
14683,Some of them won’t even learn from the deaths of friends and family.
14684,"She’s right though - the anti-vaxxers only care about themselves, so asking them to act to protect others is a waste of time."
14685,"My whole family and all my coworkers have gotten it starting in April, we're all fine and no side effects."
14686,A couple of breakthrough cases in people I know and they were very mild.
14687,"I'd say go for it, much better than the alternative of not being vaccinated and getting it."
14688,"OMG WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE...

yeah, life is fatal and the sooner people figure that out they can live their lives while they still can."

14757,"If we get a new variant every couple of weeks, vaccine makers obviously have to wait for a variant that shows substantial immune escape before dedicating production towards a new vaccine."

14886,Merck has one too but just had some less than amazing clinical results come out
14887,So it could escape antibodies but T-cells and other defenses are on it.
14888,"This really has been thinning that this actually spread to that number of people over the 10+ hr flight, rather than that number of infected people boarding from the onset."

14949,"1) The Evening Standard is not a high quality or reputable source of information - it's a cheap tabloid paper, with a long history of obscene, racist, clickbait, and otherwise biased content."
14950,2) This article cites a single broken-up (and possibly incomplete or out of context) quote from a single doctor.
14951,More importantly - there is no data to back up any claim made in this article - the headline and content are entirely based off the subjective interpretation of a  quote.
14952,"This does not link back to case counts, hospitalization numbers, etc."
14953,Or any other form of validation or citation.
14954,I don't believe that one GP's quote to a tabloid should constitute high quality info here... especially as this thread is getting high viewership now.

14956,It’s 100% from this news about covid.
14957,Someone posted a link to a nice website that listed Omicron cases by country with confirmed and probable.
14958,Anyone know that link?
14959,I felt like it was a .org?
14960,Do you live exclusively outside in the summer?
14961,"Then, according to you, asymptomatic cases wouldn't qualify as mild."
14962,Because asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 have left people with permanent lung or heart damage.
14963,If it crashes 10-20% I will.
14964,It might just rebound Monday.
14965,I’m curious to see what people do.
14966,"If it just goes right back up, then fine, if it crashes a lot, I’ll buy some more."
14967,"If it has another 1-2% drop… meh, I’m not sure."

14969,Also If it's more infectious it will have a sooner onset of pre-symptomatic spread because it will be able to transmit with a lower viral load.

14993,Any data on people who are vaccinated contracting Omicron?

15000,Why would you *not* think that.
15001,Look at the past 2 years.
15002,Moron variant factories
15003,Delta changed that incubation period to a mean of 4 days.
15004,All the newer variants I’m aware of have been trending towards shorter periods since the original 2 week incubation period.
15005,Delta has the shortest time span I’m aware of.
15006,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00264-7/fulltext
15007,I’m kind of leaning the other direction at the moment.
15008,Recall that the original virus had a longer incubation time.
15009,A lot of people didn’t show symptoms until 10+ days after exposure.
15010,"Delta sped that up, to where if you weren’t sick in about 7 days, you were probably ok.

Omnicron doesn’t come from the Delta lineage."
15011,"I’m thinking perhaps it has the longer incubation period like the original strain, coupled with higher pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission thus a ton of people get exposed before anyone realizes they are sick."
15012,The case in Belgium didn’t get sick for 11 days after she landed in Belgium.
15013,But this is purely conjecture.
15014,We’ll know soon.

15029,SO yh id say he seems to be on the verge of becoming anti vaxxer.
15030,"His one video title is literally called ""vaccination dissapointments"""
15031,"A scientific approach usually means doing things that have been shown to work, as opposed to things proven repeatedly to not work."
15032,"Closing borders to stop a variant more transmission than Delta that's already in five countries is as ""scientific"" as praying for rain."
15033,"Also, ""economic interests"" mean ""people's livelihoods,"" you shouldn't be so dismissive when money is involved because most people in the world need that to buy food."
15034,There is no data yet.
15035,"In the absence of data, science says act conservatively until you have more data."

15037,One can hope for peace.
15038,But Covid is not fatal enough for that peace
15039,It can still be everywhere yet rare enough that they don't catch it.
15040,No country is sequencing more than about 1 in 10 positive detected cases.
15041,"It also typically takes 3 weeks to do NGS prep, run sequencer with many samples multiplexed, and run data through pipelines to identify variants."
15042,So everything you're seeing so far is from a few weeks in the past.
15043,No vaccine that can handle the mutation levels covid gad become.
15044,We were lucky with the vaccines that were already being developed for the influenza.
15045,I’m from the US and we don’t sequence shit
15046,They’ve been too busy treating Covid patients to study for higher degrees
15047,The media wants us to live in fear lol…people will be scared of the new variants for like a month then forget about it a month later…rinse repeat.

15199,Don't worry.
15200,You definitely won't live 500 years.
15201,The opposite is not true.
15202,There is no evidence so far that the vaccines are ineffective against Omicron.
15203,There *is* evidence that they are.
15204,"Scientists need a bit more time to get a precise answer, but this isn't a 50/50."

15206,Not yet…
15207,[removed]
15208,Lmao what

15210,So we should probably ban travel from any country that allows travel to omicron hot spots.

15212,"Man, I think we are letting them stream back in."
15213,If so this is as half assed as the trump travel bans.
15214,What's so hard about testing and quarantining people coming back from hot zones?
15215,The idea that it originated very far from Johannesburg does not hold water.

15232,"Right, but a lot of people are asymptomatic, never seek hospital care, etc."
15233,"At some point, we need to just move on with our lives."
15234,"I'm young, healthy, and fully-vaccinated."
15235,"I currently have covid, and for me it's just been a cold."
15236,"Sure, I'll of course continue to isolate for the rest of the 10 day period, but afterwards I'm going to go right back to normal life."
15237,"I'm in NYC, so every social activity here requires vaccination anyway, and beyond that I don't think it's reasonable to stop socializing for the rest of our lives."
15238,"Covid is here to stay, and it is never ever going away at this point, no matter how much you deny yourself a normal social life."
15239,"I wonder if we'll even end up self-isolating for positive tests in, say, 5 or 10 years - we don't do that for any other respiratory diseases, after all, and it seems unreasonable to make everyone waste 10 or 20 or 30 days a year in isolation every winter forever."
15240,Think it was 3 different planes
15241,Do you think we'll know more about this new variant by say the end of December like whether vaccines work and if it's more or less severe etc
15242,Definitely...
15243,There always seems to be some other petty squabble that prevents two groups from working together.
15244,Should be pretty obvious pretty quickly imo
15245,It can be detected right now.
15246,The PCR test that is already being used can identify it.

15269,"If it has been going around for some time, then you're right."

I mean, I'm sure you're being somewhat hyperbolic, but this is obviously not true?"
15282,"It reduces the amount of cross-border spread, just not by as much as it would if citizens were included?"
15283,Just because it is discovered in SA doesnt mean it is only in SA.
15284,This ban is just simbolic act that causes damaged economics and forces other countries to hide other variants discovered.

15286,Omicron means they skipped a Greek letter lol

The WHO is skipping Nu because it sounds like ""new"" and Xi because it's a name."

15306,I read earlier that there were a lot of misspellings already lol.
15307,It’s **omicron**.
15308,The markets are so pumped up right now that this money that was lost really wasn't that huge.
15309,I've seen worse 1 day losses off normal bad news.
15310,Now you know how our ancestors felt dying of diseases randomly.
15311,"&gt; It’s often due to lack of logistics and willing populations holding them back, not supply."
15312,The data indicates that this is not true (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1232773/total-number-of-covid-19-vaccination-doses-in-africa/).
15313,Africa has been using up vaccines pretty much as soon as they have been receiving them.
15314,"As of Sep 2nd, Africa has received 143 million doses."
15315,(https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1099012).
15316,"As of Sep 2nd, Africa has used 106 million doses."
15317,"By Sep 25, Africa has delivered 146 million doses."
15318,"(https://www.statista.com/statistics/1232773/total-number-of-covid-19-vaccination-doses-in-africa/)

By Oct 1, Africa has received 200 million doses (https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076), and Africa has administered 200 million within about a month."

15323,NYC also got body slammed by OG COVID early on.
15324,"Well, take my (wishful) upvote!"
15325,"I mean, an order of magnitude would be rather high, it's a rather large figure to hide in abstraction."
15326,Omicron transform!
15327,Or 2 years taught us something finally to be overly cautious.
15328,You guys are just speculating and it accomplishes nothing.
15329,I assume they applied for EUA with their interim data of 50% efficacy.
15330,So that's probably what the FDA will be primarily looking at.
15331,"However, the huge drop implies in their second half of the trial the efficacy was around 10%."
15332,With a sample size this big it's really unlikely this is due to just statistical variations.
15333,"It could be a sudden trend reversal due to delta, which would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless by now."
15334,Another possibility is they cherry picked a sub group of high risk people for their interim analysis.
15335,It would make sense since their orders with the US are conditional on EUA approval and they are gonna allow generic manufacturing in poorer countries anyways.
15336,"In that case it could be granted EUA just for this subgroup, certainly though the FDA is not gonna simply ignore that if they did."
15337,Molnupiravir's Mechnism of Action is basically mutating enough errors into the viral replication so that the replication fails.
15338,There is potentially the danger of mutating human DNA as well with unkown long term side effects.
15339,"On top of that, new variants could evolve faster by this mutation accelerator."
15340,Merck's drug looks more and more like a very expensive and ineffective burden with unkown risks involved.
15341,My guess is Pfizer's Paxlovid will probably be the answer for high risk population as an antiviral agent and Bucillamine potentially the pill for standard risk population as an anti-inflammatory agent.
15342,Even combination of both will be considered since their MOAs work complementary.
15343,[removed]
15344,One person doesn't mean anything.
15345,Need much more samples.
15346,&gt; Their case count went as low as 70 per day.
15347,Omicron would have had to be very lucky to be in a super spreader event that Delta did not get to partake in.
15348,Their case count being low is precisely why it had a much better chance.
15349,"&gt; Omicron has around twice as many spike mutations...

That just means it likely came from someone immunosuppressed with a long-term infection like an HIV-AIDS patient and those mutations were beneficial in that particular patient."
15350,It doesn't necessarily mean those mutations will be super impactful in the broader population.
15351,"&gt; many of its mutations are well studied and understood to be impactful

Yes, and it has P681H which was more or less eliminated and displaced by P681R."
15352,That would be some curious backwards evolution to a mutation which competition had previously proven to be less-fit.
15353,&gt; The growth in cases is also happening faster than the Beta or Delta wave caused originally.
15354,That could just be human behavior and everyone aggressively piling unmasked into bars and no longer caring.
15355,"Well, this sucks."
15356,AFAIK they only need to do phase II testing.
15357,So it's gonna be much faster
15358,I'm from the US and some of my neighbors just had a mask burning party.
15359,Do you really think that’s the only limiter?
15360,"Not saying we can’t do better, but many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure to deploy these vaccines to all of their citizens, let alone educate them all."

15404,"Not a full answer, but here's something about presentation of detectability."
15405,"The flights out of SA were EU citizens only, who tested negative on rapid test 24 hrs before boarding."
15406,\* note that rapid antigen and molecular pcr have different thresholds.
15407,"rapid antigen returns more false negatives when not symptomatic, but molecular pcr detects almost *any* presence of live virus (which of course counts as infection)."
15408,&gt;This virus is supposed to be 5x as infectious as delta.
15409,"hopefully, it's more infectious but less dangerous \*cross fingers\*"
15410,"Actually every data suggests it is worst ever - has all the worst mutations from other spikes, most spikes, most mutation on the spike and evades all monoclonal therapies (previous variants evaded only some)."
15411,2 to 4 weeks you mean
15412,You must not work in a SNF.
15413,Because we have over 60 employees unvaccinated.
15414,"And many residents also unvaccinated, because they think ""the CIA is microchipping them"" ( that's what one of the patients said the other day""."

15419,That would mean its twice as contagious as measels.
15420,"&gt;The differences between Omicron and previous variants are so small 

Omicron has 32 mutations in the spike protein (delta had 9), and there are mutations in the capsid too (associated with increased viral transmission)."
15421,"Omicron also appears to have high viral loads, but it's still not clear if it escapes vaccine protection or leads to more severe disease."
15422,We're obviously in a different situation now than before we knew there was a dangerous virus going around.
15423,Back in 2019 no one was looking for it.
15424,Now we're looking very hard for it.

15462,"In USA terms (because that's where I am, so translate to your own country):

Team Trump wants to downplay all developments, including Omicron, because COVID is still just a flu bro and Fauci is a goober or whatever."
15463,"Doesn't matter if a couple neighbors die, it's still fake, and even though you believe your doctor when she treats you for cancer, you don't believe her when she tells you what drugs do or don't work against COVID."
15464,Instead you listen to a pillow salesman.
15465,"On the other side, Team Rachel Maddow or whatever actually sorta secretly wants every variant to be badass killer to justify their overly-rampant lockdown fantasies so they can impose their will on the Team Trump people."
15466,"(Team Trump has been obnoxiously marching around for the four years prior to 2021 being jerks while in charge, so Team Rachel Maddow is just naturally wanting some revenge and likes locking the Trump people in their houses and trying to guilt trip them.)"
15467,Meanwhile all the independents are watching the country burn like.... what the frack is going on and why are Donald Trump and Rachel Maddow mud wrestling on CSPAN???
15468,That's the USA.
15469,I'm gonna hope my booster stays in good effect for another month and try to enjoy a quiet Christmas with my vaccinated siblings and parents.
15470,:)  Tootles.
15471,That’s what got my attention for sure.
15472,That plus the report that cases went from a few hundred to over two thousand in a couple of weeks in South Africa
15473,"They skipped Nu and Xi, probably because Nu would be a communications nightmare and Xi would upset China."
15474,"All the other Greek letters up to Omicron have been used AFAIK, but some, like Mu, just haven’t made that big of a splash."
15475,At this point I just hope it evolves a kill switch so people will actually take it seriously
15476,They don’t learn until it’s directly affecting them.
15477,&gt; wouldn't even shock me if the penguins of Antarctica somehow got it.
15478,"Well, it is summer in Antarctica  , so flights to McMurdo are happening ;-)"
15479,Yeah...
15480,"I mean Delta already ""should"" have been plenty of incentive."

15483,Partial lockdowns do not.
15484,"Delta sure didnt like the name though, i read yesterday that the company just refers to it as ""the variant"""
15485,Yes!
15486,Taking away resources from those that are vaccinated and might have comorbidities and get infected.
15487,Or those who are vaccinated and need to be admitted for other medical issues.
15488,So unfair.
15489,We’ve recently booked a vacation to Rome in late February.
15490,I’m nervous we may not be able to travel.
15491,I think I’m trying to say that we can choose to not lockdown again.
15492,NYC (where I live) has been open thru out delta and it’s been great.
15493,"I’ll vaccinate, I’ll respect ppl who want to mask and/or work remote, but besides that I want to live my life."
15494,I can’t go thru another depressing year.
15495,At some point the mental/educational/societal toll on the population starts to outweight they gains
15496,What about those of us who got 2 shots: a J&amp;J and a booster?
15497,"Don't say that, I can't go through the last 18 months again, I've already lost everything."
15498,"Thank you, agreed."
15499,"We had a recruitment relationship at my work with South African universities, and over the years I met and really enjoyed having our SA grad students."
15500,"Brilliant artists, storytellers and just amazing people across the board."
15501,"New policies under the last administration made it financially impossible for more to matriculate here, then travel back and forth became impossible, so we haven’t had any since before Covid."
15502,I think about them and you all all the time.
15503,"Learned a lot about how SA is treated and it was my first thought when the news broke about the flight yesterday that “this is unfair, again”"
15504,Nobody has had it long enough to know if it's more virulent.
15505,Get your third dose.
15506,At this point it’s a feel-good measure that will win politician points but do little else of any value.

15579,This has been seen in *every* VOC; Omicron is just 2x farther mutated than any other.
15580,"We see individual mutations all the time, with many of the same common ones cropping up repeatedly."
15581,"But individual mutations - changes to one amino acid of the spike protein like E484K - do not drive a more contagious disease; it takes multiple amino acid changes to restructure the protein to ""still work""."
15582,"Every VOC is different, and has popped up with multiple mutations with no common ancestor between it and wildtype."
15583,"The conjecture is that each VOC evolved entirely within a single unvaccinated host with persistent COVID, likely someone who was healthy but immunocompromised."
15584,As time has gone on there's been a steady upward ladder of contagiousness.
15585,"Any lineage can mutate and be spread once, but to go anywhere it has to be more contagious than the currently circulating variants."
15586,"Every one of these ""most contagious variants yet"" has had total mutations than any previously seen variant: first there was D614G with just one mutation that made a huge difference, then Alpha (9 spike mutations), then Gamma (12 spike mutations), then Delta (23 total mutations, though fewer spike mutations), and now Omicron (31 spike mutations)."
15587,"This can also happen with cross-species jumps, though every pre-Omicron variant certainly evolved within humans."

15612,"[Well](https://c.tenor.com/2TG_TETYwXgAAAAM/ohwhale.gif)  


If you've gotten your original vaccine dose(s) + a booster, all you can do is hope."
15613,Till there's yet \*another\* vaccine for Omicron etc etc etc.
15614,With the 300000 mutations.... it'll make the virus \*less\* stable.
15615,The world can't handle another square 1.

15626,[removed]
15627,"The early data suggests that it is spreading extremely rapidly in South Africa, and literally became the dominant strain in around two weeks."
15628,Alpha and Delta took a lot longer to achieve this - and the specific mutations  of Omikron raised some eyebrows based on existing data on antibody binding.
15629,Best case scenario is that it only causes asymptomatic infections and mild symptoms and we don't really need to worry too much about it.
15630,"If you work on the 'neutral' assumption of it having the same ability to put people into hospitals as the previous ones and combine that with more rapid spread, it would cause issues with hospital capacities down the line - which are currently already limited in parts of the world, eg."
15631,Europe.
15632,And then there are potentially worse scenarios.
15633,"So it makes sense to look into travel patters, tracking people who might be carriers (e.g."
15634,recent returns from risk areas) and follow up with testing and monitoring for a few weeks until these things get clarified.
15635,"Our warmer months for us for sure so November to March since you would go to Cape Town for that, we don't really get anything close to real cold over here (we barely get to 0 in winter) but those months are the most pleasant."

15691,"I personally don't believe the bans work, just as I don't believe that the smoking ban we had in place worked or the curfew we have had in place since last April does anything either, our government has simply put in place what they think will help and people have mostly gone with it."

15723,"There's definitely differences between immunity from previous infection and immunity from vaccination, but its a similar concept."
15724,"Unless Omicron has been extremely lucky with its global debut being kicked off by a superspreading event, it appears to have replaced Delta in a moderately immunized population, faster than Delta replaced Alpha or Beta or Gamma or Lambda or Mu."

15756,This is not at all a scientific consensus.
15757,Too early here.
15758,Because the aim of the restrictions is primarily to prevent hopsitals from being overwhelmed.
15759,"If hospitals weren't being put under pressure, and there were relatively few serious illnesses then there wouldn't be any need for this new wave of restrictions."
15760,And those who are getting seriously ill in large numbers and are therefore overwhelming the hospitals are largely the unvaccinated.
15761,Depends on timing and evidence at the time.

15775,"I don’t think that’s what they were saying… I think they meant that it’s not hard to fake a negative test result, so saying everyone was tested before they boarded might not be accurate…  I mean they just look at a print out and find “PCR” and negative somewhere on the form…  Tests for traveling are over $150 in many places, so people faking having taken one is unfortunately a reality…"
15776,"Governments: “Don’t worry guys, we’re stopping flights on Monday”"
15777,We keep complaining about anti-vaxers but I suspect there are no nation-level Covid solutions.
15778,"As long as there is global travel and breakthrough cases, I am doubtful of any “silver bullet” solutions"
15779,"They skipped Nu, Xi, and Pi"
15780,Wouldn’t you need to account for multiple rounds?
15781,"39 test positive and are disallowed, but then the airline would want to maximize occupancy so 39 tested standby passengers would take their place?"
15782,Oh I got what you were judging but even work travel is much less necessary than before and many of us try to avoid at all cost but their employers make them take the risk.
15783,Its been an issue really that people aren’t happy with it.
15784,I have the Same disbelief for the travel just for fun that you have.
15785,Blows my mind.

15793,"LFTs range from complete garbage that can't even detect high viral loads, to almost as good as PCR for medium viral loads."
15794,Check out this study (out of many) where some EU-approved tests had 0% sensitivity with high viral loads https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.44.2100441

15796,And thank you
15797,"I'm not sure why you replied with that to me, I mean it's very likely someone faked their negative tedt out of l the entire flight of people who ""tested negative"" 24 hours before boarding."
15798,Which is why there's now half a flight full of positive people
15799,A Red one.
15800,Tell that to the Andalusian economy.
15801,"If Israel just found it, it's surely in the US already."
15802,imo...
15803,Medium confidence-- spreads much faster than Delta in the current world.
15804,Its growth in Gauteng is very very fast.
15805,The virus has some biologically relevant mutations to increase transmission and in vivo spread.
15806,High confidence-- High antibody resistance.
15807,"There's extensive literature on how different mutations interact with antibodies we use, and Omicron has a lot of them."
15808,"Low confidence -- I'd guess that although transmission risk isn't reduced a lot by vaccination or infection via Delta, it might still provide good protection against severe symptoms and death."
15809,"Low confidence -- I don't know of any way to estimate mortality rate in immuno-naive people.. best guess is probably the same as it was for Delta, or maybe for Beta instead?"
15810,Low confidence -- longer infectious cycle with lower viral load?
15811,Delta was a bit unique in its high viral load and quick infectious cycle.
15812,SA health noted this variant doesn't have the mutation associated with higher viral load.
15813,I believe the Belgium person had a really long incubation period as well.
15814,"I feel pretty confident that it will infect many people very quickly, personally."
15815,"I don't think we have estimates for how severe the disease is, or if this will lead to a more severe endemic phase."
15816,Moving my stocks around when the market opens up though.
15817,The variant must be escaping the rapid tests.
15818,Even bad test taking or reduced sensitivity should have caught some of those.
15819,"This has clearly already spread everywhere, but brace yourselves for ""new cases detected in this area"" to be spammed for the next several weeks."
15820,"Ultimately, what really matters now is whether it becomes the dominant strain, how deadly it is, and how resistant to the existing vaccines it is."
15821,Because the politicians and health ministers who say this is 'serious' don't actually mean it.
15822,This is the real kicker.
15823,This money isn’t fixing the situation.
15824,"It’s just throwing money into a bottomless pit, as the situation continues, unabated."
15825,Is that the quality of South African tests?
15826,“But how are people that dumb” is exactly what you said.

15838,Yup.
15839,"&gt; and an unknown number of people not on the flight who took the test as well, but testing positive, were not allowed."
15840,"Statistics are difficult enough, but inferring proper context like this is even more challenging."
15841,That's the dumbest thing I read today
15842,I'm seeing some sentiment in anti-vaccination circles that Omicron is a validation of their stance.
15843,I don't see how that makes sense.
15844,"For the better part of a year as cases surged, vaccinated people have faced far fewer complications and fatalities from COVID than their unvaccinated peers."
15845,That's an achievement and suggesting otherwise when a new variant emerges seems very irresponsible.
15846,This virus has like what 8 more mutations to the receptor than delta and 50 total mutations seriously wanna see more data
15847,"UK has 0 restrictions in place atm, if Omicron is as contagious as it's said to be, there's a very big chance that it already spread throughout UK and the rest of Europe"

15873,"We need more machines for creating vaccines all around the globe and we need to devise ways of testing those vaccines faster so that when a variant of concern appears we program those machines to produce vaccine for that variant quickly and ""attenuate"" its ""band""."
15874,This pandemic might take decades if there's plenty of spectrum left.
15875,Everything I’ve seen says we don’t know much about this variant.
15876,Why is everyone shitting themselves as if the vaccine doesn’t work?
15877,All those are true but you’re assuming what they felt.

15985,"Increase the requirents for travel (Fully vaccinated plus a PCR done with this new variant taken into account while you are quarantined during the period the PCR is run to ensure you don't catch it post test), something like that, people would take that over not being able to do anything at all."

16093,"The left is using it to justify panic for clicks and views

We're so fucked"
16094,"I mean, I’d like to see a mandatory quarantine for the incubation period, followed by a test before you can “leave” but many would have a fit if we did that, and even as someone who is more moderate/slightly left even I am uncomfortable with that."
16095,So they would have been better off keeping them in the plane.

16122,This level of brainwashing and stubborn defiance is scary.
16123,People are not rational creatures.
16124,I feel like the past few years have been eye opening.
16125,To some extent though you have to admit Florida gives some evidence that restrictions only have marginal affects on the overall numbers.
16126,"Florida has had the least amount of restrictions and one of the oldest populations, yet they still fall within the range of other states on all Covid numbers."
16127,"Get vaccinated and protect yourself, government intervention isn’t all that."
16128,It's because high net worth individuals hold most of their wealth in equities (stocks) and real estate.
16129,"When COVID hit in 2020, after the lockdowns, we needed stimulus to prevent the economy from imploding, so the Federal Reserve (our central bank) printed hundreds of billions of dollars and disbursed it into the economy, causing stock markets and real estate markets to increase extremely fast."
16130,This means that people who hold assets became wealthier.
16131,Everybody should hold investments if they can.
16132,Take some money every month and throw it into an S&amp;P 500 index fund if you can.
16133,"&gt;What is safe outside, is socially distanced gatherings - keep 6 feet apart

16137,Not practical therefore the risk outdoors is real and you should wear a mask.
16138,I think it's a combo of delta hitting right around when the vaccines were waning for a lot of people.
16139,"Yeah, that’s literally not a mild case."
16140,I thought this has been shown to be incredibly poor research?
16141,They won't.
16142,They are still flying in until Monday.
16143,But dont people have to be tested upon landing in US?
16144,Vaxxed and tested before and after international flights?
16145,"No there's not, everything available to the public right now just seems like speculation and unnecessary fear mongering."
16146,"If you're vaccinated, mask up and keep living."
16147,TBF a ton of vaccinated people still have gotten infected with covid
16148,Then tell the governments that.
16149,"I think it’s about high time we leave behind the people who aren’t getting vaccinated, and just fully open up everything."
16150,"And also make a law, if you’re not vaccinated you’re not entitled to hospital treatment for Covid."
16151,Thank you very much for these!
16152,&gt; Gauteng is definitely the epicenter here.
16153,It's where I live.
16154,... will see in a few days.
16155,"Oof, that must be very rough; stay safe and I hope it all goes well!"
16156,"I guess we are still using the Trump methodology of ""don't test, can't know""."
16157,"It's absurd, all these countries are testing anyone getting off a flight from SA and the goddamn US of A sits with it's thumb up it's ass."
16158,Yes.
16159,They’re just a lot less likely to be than the average person.
16160,Definitely.
16161,But not moreso in the past couple of weeks.
16162,I think we will need more time to understand the impact of the new variant.
16163,There are parts of our country where antibody tests seem to indicate that 80% of our population have already had covid.
16164,I wonder how much impact that may have on natural immunity where vaccination uptake has been low.
16165,So much of our country is rural with limited access to Healthcare services.
16166,So people will locally just deal with their own dead without testing and therefore without covid notification.
16167,It’s pronunciation is difficult (not pronounced anything like Xi leader of China).
16168,Might be why.
16169,It was two flights.
16170,[removed]
16171,They put all of the people from that flight in the same area as up to a thousand people from other flights.
16172,No social distancing and few masks apparently.
16173,It's like we've learned nothing.
16174,Oh no a new variant the end is nigh!!

16187,Exercising their democratic right to protest?
16188,"Australia is nearly at 90% vaccinated, a huge number of people who don't support vaccine passports and mandates are vaccinated themselves."
16189,"These laws are an affront to the Australian way of life, when you have *hate groups* like the Victorian Bar Association maybe it's time to take a moment of pause about the extreme authoritarian shit government's are trying to pass in under the guise of ""public health""

As it stands the conservative side of politics is far more vaccinated than the left."
16190,When it rains and you jump into a pool so you don't get wet.
16191,I don't understand the point of this comparison.
16192,"People aren't really freaking out about a new variant, they're more freaking out about a possibility of new lockdowns and restrictions even for vaccinated people."
16193,"From a tv expert interview, they said it has a minimal impact, maybe changing when there is a spike in the US by 7-10 days."
16194,"Still, in the early days of a new strain, that may be helpful."
16195,"Yeah, those are people who got on the plane with it."
16196,People who contracted it on the plane wouldn’t have immediately tested positive for it.
16197,So it’s gonna be much worse.
16198,As a layman I don't think viruses choose to evade any vaccine or defence as afaik they don't have brains and they don't think.
16199,"I would assume it's just the sheer number of errors that happen in the genetic code of the virus when it replicates, and it's just by chance a mutation that circumvents our defenses occur."
16200,This would mean the amount of virus in existence is a factor for creation of vaccine evading mutations and as far as I know vaccines reduce the amount of replications and spread so they should work against new mutations.
16201,But as numbers grow astronomical so does the amount of mutations and a vaccine may be ultimately evaded.
16202,"My brains say each vaccine attenuates a certain ""band"" of mutations from the spectrum of all possible mutations where the virus can infect humans (enter the receptor)."
16203,"The virus cannot return to a vaccinated band with its mutations because it's a dead end, but vaccine does not drive the virus to any other band either."
16204,It jumps there randomly.
16205,Once the virus randomly enters a band where vaccine is less effective it of course spreads as there's nothing preventing it but it could happen also without vaccines.
16206,Until all possible bands are locked the virus has available spectrum to jump into.
16207,"I would also like to theorize that over time when the virus has generated gazillions of variants, some being weaker than others, these weaker variants might circulate freely and act as natural vaccination on all of the bands ultimately replacing the serious forms, because our behaviour and deaths are a one kind of band filter too, which favours evolution towards milder disease."
16208,"However, sometimes those milder variants may evolve backwards to being more deadly, just as we see with influenza."
16209,Maybe we should both have a travel ban and some kind of bounty system so that countries get some aid or award when they discover a new important variant to help offset the travel ban.
16210,South Africa's excess death numbers are far worse than official COVID numbers.
16211,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker
16212,Both those cases were found about 10 days into their mandatory reentry quarantine.
16213,It was found via daily/every other day testing.
16214,Neither became symptomatic.

16217,"Guys we need to assume Omicron is in every city even Boring Ass Rural City, USA."
16218,"Wear your N95 masks for the next 14

16221,The only time when its appropriate to panic is if vaccinated people start to die of covid at the same exact rates as unvaccinated people.
16222,Buy high sell low
16223,Yay a silver lining
16224,I’m not all that happy about situations where (willfully) unvaccinated people can get on a plane / in a concert hall / etc.
16225,with a 48-hour-old antigen test.
16226,This story makes it crystal clear that the rapid antigen tests are a snapshot of *that instant’s* probable infectiousness and NOT an indication that one is free from a stealthily replicating infection.
16227,"With all the mutations in the spike, i think it would make sense that the spike vaccine actually works even better than ever now- get your boosters!"
16228,Take it easy there Starscream.
16229,"They barely test in South Africa, there were 30,000 tests done yesterday"
16230,How do you feel about 65535?

16263,"In Pennsylvania, the deer are all infected with it now."
16264,Good news would be this.
16265,Studying the 1890 pandemic has led to the likely causative agent being the last coronavirus to make a leap in to humans on a global level.
16266,"Eventually, pandemics end when the virus mutates to its most common variant being a very mild illness, aka a ""common cold"" or at worst a flu (like avian H1N1 did)."
16267,The 1890 pandemic likely led to one of our current 4 endemic but very mild coronavirus es.
16268,These are manageable.
16269,"It would be great if this was a highly infectious variant that causes extremely mild illness but produced a good, normal immune response."

16287,Definitely what I'm calling my spelling mistakes from now on lol
16288,The best way to handle this in my view is a hope for the best but prepare for the worst type of deal as there’s no way to be certain of anything until we get genetic sequencing done and lab tests done to definitely measure what this variant is actually capable of against vaccines.
16289,"Against death and hospitalization the covid vaccines are still very very good even after 6 months tho, for most people."

16298,Both NSW and Victoria are taking it one step further by announcing that all fully vaccinated travellers who have been in any other overseas country during the two week period before their arrival must travel directly to their place of residence or accommodation and isolate for 72 hours

16381,"Of course, it's a baby Toyota."
16382,Seems unlikely that 85 infected people on a flight of 600 got a negative test result less than 24h before getting on the plane...

16384,Alpha to Omega.
16385,Shudder.
16386,It is only a hypothesis but i would assume that if we open up without any protective measures the outcome short term would look bad.
16387,However on a longer time frame we should see the immune system improve rather quickly in all humans around the globe.
16388,"If you are healthy, you'll rarely get more than 1 flu during flu season, even though there are several strains, this is because of the improved immunity right after,, the following winter you however are very likely to get infected again, as the body haven't seen a flu virus in a while."
16389,Isolation against COVID is like taking a break which makes our body think it no longer needs the protection.
16390,"A side note is that you will also not be able to isolate in a lot of countries around the world, these people could keep the show going and reinfect us once we're open again with a new more deadly strain ( see virus from linked article in op's post)

Now if your body keeps being bombarded with different strains the immune system should at a certain point get strong enough, that covid would no longer infect you short to mid term."
16391,If everyone could get to this stage who knows what might happen.
16392,I like to think this is possible as the current strains are super easily transmitted.
16393,It is also worth noticing that isolation prevents the immune system from adapting to virus which is how humans have survived a shitton of pandemics throughout history.
16394,30% of our DNA only served the purpose of adapting to virus (Link 1).
16395,Research points towards that mRNA vaccines do not make these changes to the immune system.
16396,"(Link 2)

The luck approach (genetic entropy) (link 3) won't work as we isolate ourselves preventing strains from dying out."
16397,It might mutate into a less deadly variant then later on mutate into a more deadly variant again.
16398,"If you see my previous post one of the sources state that the reason this COVID virus mutate slower than other rna viruses, is that it has the ability to correct errors in its mutation, that would lead to genetic entropy."
16399,The flu never stopped because we are only exposed to it a few months of the year.
16400,Vaccines probably won't work either as covid mutates too quickly meaning vaccines just favors the strain that is immune to the vaccine.
16401,"Long term solutions are never popular,  we see it all the time that politicians rather pick the solution that increases popularity (read short term solutions)."
16402,"TL;DR
COVID won't go away on its own if we do not allow for our immune systems to adapt in response to covid."
16403,"Isolation is doing the opposite, which one could argue it is like pissing your pants, nice and warm at first but soon it will be cold and you have piss all over your pants."

16405,"I feel like at this point if no one has learned the lesson to overdo precautions now and sort out incoming data later, then its going to be a long 2022."
16406,But longer incubation times make sense.
16407,"Delta outcompeted the other variants because it could spread fast in lowly vaccinated populations, but once enough people become immune/resistant then a variant with long incubation times can more easily get through our testing procedures and get to the unvaccinated."

16417,Seattle is a mark better than Tacoma as far as mask usage.
16418,"In Tacoma it’s a bit of a joke, two of my coworkers wear mesh masks."
16419,Last I checked the Delta is still a problem.
16420,Trump…
16421,I really wish I was born in UK.. Would have changed everything..
16422,I won't be seeing better days in my country so it's better to just hang myself rather than hang in there..
16423,"I am from South Africa, there are plenty of vaccines, but we are only 30% fully vaccinated."
16424,Many won't take it.
16425,Don't know about rest of Africa though.
16426,Perfect time for virus to spread.
16427,It's hard to beat the feeling of a squeaky clean ass right after a taco bell deposit.
16428,Once you have a bidet there is never a chance of going back.
16429,Makes it really rough to have to use a bathroom without one
16430,This is wrong.
16431,Parts of germany are under lockdown and calls emerge that whole germany should be.
16432,International health organizations keep repeating the importance of NPIs.
16433,"UK is triaging, if you're over 45 you dont get ECMO and several patients died in emergency cars outside of hospitals waiting hours for treatment."
16434,Yes the NYT reporter lol
16435,Should probably investigate the origin of those tests.
16436,"Could be falsified tests, or could be a tester not really testing them and labeling them negative, or could be bad equipment."
16437,"No, but it impacted my mental health so much that I can't get back to restart my career.."
16438,Yup.. Lockdown after lockdown after lockdown..
16439,Even after vaccinations are in full swing.. How long can you possibly keep the economy shut?

16441,Let's see.
16442,"There is a pandemic and you want to know if you should get trapped, with total strangers, in a box for over 10 hours."
16443,Is that right?
16444,"It's important to keep in mind that many in South Africa were already infected with the delta variant, so they have a high level of natural immunity against delta."
16445,"Omicron seems to ""ignore"" that natural immunity (at least to some level), so it's easier for Omicron to spread in SA."
16446,So the 4x may not be true in other regions where the level of natural immunity against delta is not as high as in SA.
16447,"It's also possible that vaccine immunity works much better against Omicron than natural immunity, so in countries with high vaccination rates,  Omicron may not be able to spread as fast as in SA."
16448,[removed]
16449,&gt; EDIT: Everyone had been tested with a rapid test less than 24 hours before departure.
16450,I’m going to hazard a complete unsubstantiated guess: some of the passengers faked test results because getting a test within 24 hours could be a hassle and/or expensive depending on location (I have no idea about South Africa)

16453,🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
16454,Do we though?
16455,Does every positive test get analyzed and sequenced to identify the specific strain?
16456,"Plus, a lot of the most at risk people are already dead."
16457,🤷🏻‍♂️
16458,Yes.
16459,I think probably all of them will be infected.
16460,Some will never test positive due to resistance perhaps.
16461,You can't put everybody in a hotel because you have 600 more each day.
16462,"The battle is already lost, pretty much."
16463,"Also, 24+ hours can make a lot of difference in terms of test positivity"
16464,It's too late..
16465,The damage is already done and it's irreversible..
16466,It's all over
16467,0.6475% of 8 billion people have died from Covid 19 during 2+ years of what has long been seen by epidemiologists as a three-year pandemic.
16468,"There are more humans than ever, and Covid has made a very small dent in *growth* of population."
16469,Okay.
16470,Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask - it's just been the thing occupying my mind.
16471,I'm meant to go to the UK (from Australia) a week from now for about 2 weeks...
16472,I was already on the fence and now even less sure.
16473,Thoughts or things to consider?
16474,!
16475,I don't know why people act like panic buying was a huge issue.
16476,"A few people bought way too much shit and their pictures were posted but the real issue was that grocery stores only order enough of things to meet the usual demand, and everybody decided to buy twice as much as usual to reduce trips to the store."
16477,A perfectly normal and advised thing to do.
16478,But when everybody does it only half of us get through shopping before the thing runs out.
16479,That's why shelves were empty.
16480,no one knows.
16481,"plenty of speculation, but no one knows."
16482,Yes.. Sleep is the only time I don't feel the pain..
16483,I just want to sleep forever
16484,Not yet...
16485,I would argue part of the reason we’re seeing a more proactive response is that many of those same governments were also heavily criticised for being too slow to react to Delta before it became widespread.
16486,So better to be safe than sorry.
16487,Or saving Xi for the last most powerful humanity destroyer.
16488,Would want to make a wimpy variant after him.
16489,"I get that the argument you make could be true, but i believe it's very unlikely."
16490,Their case count went as low as 70 per day.
16491,Omicron would have had to be very lucky to be in a super spreader event that Delta did not get to partake in.
16492,"I don't think that's enough evidence on its own, but when Omicron has around twice as many spike mutations as the previous leader in the pandemic, and many of its mutations are well studied and understood to be impactful, it seems like there's a legitimate reason to   believe it could have an advantage."
16493,"When something that is so distinct immediately creates a wave in an area that was successfully controlling Delta for 3 months, and the wave becomes increasingly composed of the brand new variant rather than the old and established one, i really think the odds are heavily in favor of it not just being blind luck helping Omicron out."
16494,The growth in cases is also happening faster than the Beta or Delta wave caused originally.
16495,"I don't think that's strong evidence, but it's another piece."
16496,Get the booster then worry about the new variant later.
16497,Delta is still real and there's no evidence that the booster won't protect you from the new variant.
16498,[removed]
16499,No.
16500,This is not accurate.
16501,It’s a tiny sample.
16502,24% vaccination rate and little/no delta plus low cases.
16503,i didn’t make a claim to the contrary.
16504,"he said it would be more likely to mutate where it can spread among many hosts, i just pointed out that it spreads among a far larger amount of people in the UK than south africa."
16505,"I mean, it sounds like the next super contagious variant is already here."
16506,So maybe?
16507,Not enough vaccinated in SA to matter.
16508,I think 60 people on a flight being infected suggests South Africa was horribly undercounting their COVID rates unless we want to buy into the thought that these people represented more than 1% of all South African COVID cases?
16509,It's the huge number of mutations in this particular variation.
16510,SA has been punished for its excellent sequencing procedures.
16511,But remember plague island?
16512,The Kent variant?
16513,"Until you get into a car accident and there are no icu beds in the entire state, because half of the healthcare workforce has left the bedside due to poor treatment/ptsd, and the other half that are somehow still standing are dealing with the 8th Covid wave or whatever."
16514,That’s the issue.
16515,"Even if you don’t get bad Covid, the healthcare system is still pretty much in a state of slow collapse."
16516,"I’m surprised of all places, that the German Health Care vaccination system is not unified under one system."
16517,I think you should be prepared for this.
16518,Even people in areas that were generally strict about restrictions are over it.
16519,"The general sentiment here in Massachusetts is, ""oh well, just get it over with because we just don't care anymore."""
16520,"Not exactly, wellness programs let employer offer discount but everyone as baseline must be charged the same."
16521,"For example everyone is charged 300 a month for insurance, if you are vaccinated under wellness program you get 50 discount."
16522,The only exception is smokers that can be charged double
16523,"Vaccine is there to protect you from getting sick, not from catching it."

16525,If you aren't out of toilet paper people like you are why it happens
16526,I actually would consider smiling if someone put a gun to my head and ended my misery already
16527,"As an American, I guess I've gotten used to distrusting people and assuming no one is going to do the right thing the last few years."
16528,"The city I live in does pretty well with masking, but go out 15 miles and no one is wearing a mask, case rates are ridiculous, and vaccination rates are abysmal."
16529,"Maybe you folks can travel safely, but I just don't want my fellow Americans doing it."
16530,Haha
16531,What you’re seeing right now is sensationalism.
16532,There’s no firm data that omicron is actually any more dangerous than delta.
16533,"Keep an eye on it, but otherwise don’t be concerned yet."
16534,This is really getting into hysterical.
16535,"There is a whole lot of distance between ""variant of concern found"" and lockdown is needed."
16536,"You have no idea how much it impacts immunity, mortality, transmission."
16537,None.
16538,That is a whole lot of questions to have to shut down society.
16539,It's the societal equivalent of doing prevantative chemotherapy.

16560,"People will test negative multiple times, days, before they test positive."
16561,In this example a negative tests just means they weren't infected... days ago before they got on the plane.
16562,He used to be credible but now he uses his credentials to spread fear daily on covid.
16563,"If it wasn’t a self administered test, wouldn’t the result be “inconclusive?” I had an inconclusive result and they said one protein was detected but not the other."
16564,You don't understand.
16565,The wellness program is what allows the employer to raise health insurance premiums for the unvaccinated.
16566,My understanding is that generally if you already had covid you would have had a severe reaction to the *first* dose
16567,That's not how spread works at all with R rates.
16568,"You are correct in that it cannot be stopped, but it is the average speed of spread that is key."
16569,"If you have an R rate of 2, that means 1 infected gives it to 2 others (and so on)."
16570,"If you have 10 at once, that means 20, 40 etc and it gets harder and harder to contain."
16571,"We are talking about buying a few days or weeks of outbreak at this stage, which may make some difference."
16572,It also allows the leaders to actually show leadership and not an indifferent shrug to the upcoming deaths that will probably follow.
16573,the UK has over a million covid cases per month
16574,When you watch your 24 year old friends daughter die alone in the hospital and your own 16 niece get pots and now need a wheelchair things might feel different.
16575,Also given that 40% or so of the US won’t vaccinate who knows what happens with it.
16576,My point being we are not out of the woods and this virus is probably unlike any before it.

16582,"I can’t sleep, I am feeling so unhinged."
16583,"&gt;Yes, you can go from SA to Egypt in some 5-6 hours by plane, but how likely is it that there are enough people carrying this variant that an European tourist would get in close enough contact with one of them to get infected herself?"
16584,What are conditions like in the airports she visited?
16585,"In the US airports are filled with restaurants that are full to capacity, with everyone eating right next to each other."

16600,It’s a little of “not looking for it” and “not much of it”.

16602,It’s because his excessive use of emojis makes me want to unalive myself
16603,What makes this variant more dangerous than the multitude of other mutations already circling the globe?
16604,I’m feeling like I’m missing something.

16606,That is their thought-process.
16607,I don’t mean to be an alarmist but I can’t help but wonder if this could be a huge mess given that many people are dragging their feet on getting a booster.
16608,I have family who got vaxxed 6-7 months ago but have the I’m tired of this mentality.
16609,Sounds like this could have the potential to be more contagious than delta.
16610,A growing population here in the states are taking it all less and less serious because they’re just over it.
16611,Add that with anti vaccine people and it could really start popping off here in 1-2 months.

16656,"The vaccine uptake is high in the UK, it seems far more likely to have started somewhere it can spread among many hosts like South Africa where the vaccinated % is so low."
16657,It makes sense that those mutations would be more likely to spread in a highly vaccinated environment which means that any variant that breaks through in that area would have to be vaccine resistant.
16658,If a variant occurred where there isn’t a high vaccine uptake then there is no environmental pressures to evade the vaccine so the chances of it mutating and spreading are lower.

16666,Damn I was feeling hopeful until I saw this :(
16667,"I disagree, the travel ban makes sense even when the variant is already in your country."
16668,"The virus propagates like a series of family trees, each generation infecting more people than the last in an exponential way."
16669,"Starting with fewer initial infected persons means fewer ""family trees"" which means more time to react."
16670,Possibly weeks.
16671,This presupposes that spread is tied to quantity of infected people entering all at once.
16672,"Folks are envisioning this is like the Normandy Invasion or something, where it matters at this point if it’s 10 or 10k people with it entering a country."
16673,Not correct.
16674,"At this point if Omicron is as infectious (or more) as Delta and a few infected people who slipped through the cracks before South Africa identified this strain have been out and about in major cities globally hitting businesses, riding public transit, dining out, going to work, etc."
16675,it doesn’t matter a single bit if you have a plane load of infected Botswanans landing in Amsterdam.
16676,Uncontrolled spread is already happening.
16677,"Best thing to do is robust testing of travelers, quarantine where needed and hope like hell the vaccines do their job."
16678,Panicking at this stage does nothing but harm.
16679,So I keep hearing of a test you take (when you are in another country flying home and need the test 3 days before the flight) where you get on video call with the lab.
16680,They watch you take the test etc .
16681,then email you a result that is acceptable to American government guidelines ..  but as of yet I have not actually found it.
16682,We are going to Costa Rica and otherwise they will test you day of but you must be at airport 5 hours before the flight
16683,"&gt; There is no valid reason to ever go back to such measures with vaccines in place, more therapeutics on the way and the fact that the virus is already wide spread."
16684,You can't make definitive statements on principle here.
16685,If the actual *consequences* are bad enough then measures will need to be considered with that in mind.
16686,"Obviously there is little political or societal willingness to close anything again, but things could get extremely bad and the equation will change."
16687,It probably won't but nobody knows as of now.
16688,"Get vaccinated, wear a mask, go about living a normal life instead of being in perpetual fear 

I mean imagine the next super contagious variant comes out in 6 months."
16689,Everyone should stay at home for the next year?
16690,"Poor countries have a distribution problem, not a money/quantity problem."
16691,"There is some truth to that, but it is also the flaw in democracy."
16692,"Any country leaving their borders open with a ""dangerous"" country whilst others close theirs will be labelled a bad leader and heavily punished by the electorate."
16693,This is a political and not a scientific decision.
16694,"I wouldn't say constant noise pollution and chronic overwork in itself is good, but New York seems like it has some cool people, yes."
16695,Good thing you don’t make the rules
16696,Seriously.
16697,"If anyone has a source fo find that info, please let me know."
16698,Again: This isn’t like Delta.
16699,"As long as people keep getting PCR tests, Omnicron essentially loudly announces it’s arrival because the tests have a certain failure that makes handing off for sequencing likely."
16700,It’s the same reason we knew Alpha arrived early on: The “S Gene dropout” occurs so you get one negative and two positives.
16701,They slow down the spread
16702,"If 61 out of 600 passengers to Amsterdam yesterday were positive, plus positive cases from other countries on the opposite side of Africa, there's next to no chance it isn't here and spreading already."
16703,"Even if it was just South Africa, the fact that we would still let us citizens in with no mandatory supervised quarantine means that it would eventually reach our shores."
16704,"And even if we had a reasonable quarantine strategy from other countries and it wasn't already here, some country we hadn't isolated would eventually have a screw up, and it would get here from there."
16705,"The only conceivable way to keep it out is a Chinese style blanket, mandatory and supervised quarantine for all arrivals."
16706,"Even with the amount of social control that they have (and we don't), they struggled to keep delta out at great cost."
16707,I'm hoping it's less severe or at least unlikely to reinfect/break through vax protection.
16708,We're in for a really awful winter if not.
16709,My wife and I are both fully vaccinated and tested positive yesterday.
16710,"Pretty sick too with fevers, extreme weakness, cough."
16711,I wonder if it’s this new shit.
16712,Ah yes yes.
16713,As expected it bought us no time and crushed the travel industry again - 2 cases already detected
16714,Sure they can have wellness program but it's a discount
16715,How much data is there to say the opposite?
16716,All of the known cases reported so far were asymptomatic
16717,Now all of a sudden every country will start reporting the presence of this new variant.
16718,Developing nations will again be on the receiving end as the airport screening without a doubt will be very lax.I think within the next fortnight almost all the countries would be reporting it.
16719,"I've been repeatedly exposed to covid, both pre and post-vaccination, but never contracted it as far as I know, does that mean that I've already had it?"
16720,Is there any way that I can find out if that's the case?
16721,"Both my husband and I have had repeated exposures to people who, pretty immediately after, discover that they had covid at the time or contracted it at the same location."
16722,One of which we stayed with in the same home and rode in the same car while they were symptomatic but thought that it was just a cold.
16723,"We live in a major city, use public transport, have travelled internationally numerous times throughout the pandemic, have attended large music events both indoors and outdoors, bars, restaurants, house parties, the gym, etc."
16724,etc.
16725,"We've both had a few colds over the past two years but tested negative each time, even though we tested numerous times each."
16726,We live in the UK so we only just received our second vaccination about a month and a half ago.
16727,"Our incidents of known exposure have happened throughout the pandemic, unvaccinated, half-vaccinated, and fully vaccinated."
16728,"Each time that we're notified by the friend or acquaintance, we brace ourselves, absolutely *certain* that this is going to be the time that we get it... but nothing ever happens, and we never test positive."
16729,"Anecdotally, we both received Moderna and both had incredibly severe side-effect reactions to the second dose, I even had an episode of tachycardia."
16730,"Otherwise, we're both in our mid-20s, visit the gym daily, eat healthily, and take vitamins."
16731,Requiring to be verifiable and actually doing the verification are two very different things.
16732,"My personal experience traveling internationally is that they just look at a printout and if it looks official, says PCR and negative with the exact passenger name it is accepted."
16733,With hundreds of thousands (?)
16734,"of testing centers worldwide there is simply no scalable process to verify results from each provider and know they are legitimate,  As for consequences.., in this case a lot of attention will be put on these travelers, But the millions of travelers who flew last Tuesday?"
16735,"No one keeps their test records… I wish everyone would follow the testing rules, but I worry that too many don’t take this seriously and will cheat resulting in more spread and more deaths..,"
16736,Idk things have been pretty good the last few months.
16737,"Unfortunately the IQ in the likes of Germany and Austria is lower than I'd hoped, as we can see with their US-level vaccination rates."
16738,[removed]
16739,Do these flights have vaccine requirements?
16740,Some old family friends I had are of the mindset that this is all just a massive global conspiracy against SA again because of apartheid.
16741,I think part of the problem is the massive distrust in their government due to massive corruption and the vast mass of misinformation they keep reading and spouting isn't helping.
16742,Even the advice from their uncle who is a doctor in the UK is being ignored.
16743,I recently travelled from France to Canada.
16744,I needed a negative PCR test from within 72 hours of my flight.
16745,A test taken on a Tuesday morning was well within the window to get on a plane on Thursday afternoon.
16746,I’d prefer a combination of RA tests prior to boarding and a take home RA test to use within 24 hours handed out on arrival.
16747,I think that that would be less expensive for everyone and more effective at slowing and monitoring spread.
16748,"While it could be worse (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00954-4), Omicron has several Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) mutations consistent with enhanced transmissibility like N501Y, Q498R, S477N, and K417N."
16749,It also has Furin Cleavage Site mutations like P681H consistent with enhanced transmissibility.
16750,The only hope would be that these mutations conflict with each other to decrease transmissibility.
16751,"To argue against that, studies show that immunocompromised patients develop many high-mutation lineages in the same person, so it’s most likely that the most transmissible lineage jumps to a new person and starts to spread."
16752,"Oh, and this variant also has deletions at spike positions 69-70, 143-145, and 211."
16753,"These deletions are known to occur in long-duration immunocompromised patients, and these deletions are known to reduce effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies specifically those which act against the Spike N-Terminal Domain (NTD)."
16754,(See https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf6950 ).
16755,What’s new is these deletions haven’t been seen together before.
16756,So it is possible that Omicron is highly transmissible.
16757,Indeed it’s probable which is why the scientists and governments are reacting like they are.
16758,"It *could* turn out to be not-so-transmissible for some reason, but that would take some luck."
16759,I wouldn't be surprised if my neighbor had it already
16760,I'm not scared of 'Omicron' and you shouldn't be either.
16761,fuck the media.
16762,They exist to make you scared and get clicks.
16763,We are doomed captain mannering
16764,Definitely.
16765,"Vaccination can cause swelling and the like,  but that's not harmful or cross reactive with dilation that will be over anyway."
16766,Yep!
16767,This is a big reason why even Delta was able to spread so easily.
16768,"People thinking that it's not bad, and walking around maskless thinking that everything is fine and dandy."
16769,Thank you.
16770,I feel a day lying in bed under the weather is worth the decreased risk of a fatal infection.

16785,Get your first dose today.
16786,Would it have to go through trial studies again?

16837,Yes!
16838,What are symptoms AND how long have they had it?
16839,Omicron must be really serious then
16840,OK. Let me explain why I don't think we have accurate information on this Covid variant.
16841,It was first sequenced on the 24th of November.
16842,It is currently the 28th.
16843,4 days is not enough time for people to be hospitalized by covid or complete a full infection cycle.
16844,"If your telling me this variant doesn't cause hospitalizations in vaccinated individuals after 4 days, I'll say ok, but what about after 5 days?"
16845,A normal infection cycle in someone who does not require high dependency care is typically in the range of 2 weeks (10-14 days).

16852,Any data on how many sites of the protein the vaccine tries to hit?
16853,Any data antibody vs. memory cell response?
16854,"If you have it, please share it, because as no variant has even begun to escape a boosted individual, I have no reason to vary until the data tells me to, because the data until this point shows partial to good protection is more likely than none."
16855,"Which brings me back to my original question of: 

&gt;when do we get to travel again?"
16856,The point is that it’s not all just about little old you.
16857,There are other people in the world who you probably interact with.
16858,"If you refuse to wear a mask when health officials say you should, you’re putting other people at risk."

16886,"However, 11 hours in a plane would potentially be a vector, as well as any public transportation and indoor setting."
16887,"If we catch something in the first country and test positive, it will prevent us from continuing our itinerary."
16888,We will wind up quarantined in a hotel and spending vacation time (or beyond) quarantined in a foreign country with our remaining flights gone.
16889,Same can be said in the 2nd country when trying to get home.

16950,I suspect that good long term followup data on vaccine induced acute myocarditis is very limited due to its rarity.
16951,"The CDC is now collecting data on it from covid vaccines but in cases where we'd have long term data, likely tdap or tetanus, it's typically reported only as case studies with no long term followup

With that lack of data you have to rely on long term followup of myocarditis in more common instances like viral induced or just general all cause cases."
16952,Both of these are not ideal comparisons but they exist.
16953,Here's a study of acute myocarditis.
16954,"They looked at &gt;600 acute cases

""Major AM-related cardiac events after the acute phase (postdischarge death and heart transplantation, sustained ventricular arrhythmias treated with electric shock or ablation, symptomatic heart failure needing device implantation) occurred in 2.8% at the 5-year follow-up, with a higher incidence in patients with complicated forms (10.8% versus 0% in uncomplicated AM; log-rank P&lt;0.0001)."""

17004,If this variant does turn out to affect the efficacy rate of vaccines to below 50%… that would be a HUGE setback.
17005,"Vaccine hesitancy is already too high, with many who got it, not doing so because they believe in it."
17006,"This would destroy public opinion, and it would be even harder to convince people to take more and more shots."
17007,"I’ll still be taking them, but I know too many who barely took the vaccine… who would view this as proof that it wasn’t worth it."
17008,So that could also be a fear in the scientific supporting governments.
17009,Especially because the only quickest way out of this is everyone vaccinated.
17010,"Fortunately vaccine antibodies are polyclonal, and target various parts of the spike protein, most notably the protein that is the ""key"" to cell entry."
17011,What it is bad for is monoclonal antibody treatments.
17012,"Because the current vaccine was still effective and logistically it didn't make sense to alter production to focus on Delta interrupting production, the same is going to be likely true for this variant as well."
17013,vaccines will work maybe not as good as against OG corona but enough that it doesnt make sense to alter production.
17014,But China is more vaccinated than every European country
17015,I wish my dad would actually read articles like this
17016,I'm sorry.
17017,I hope you get to see her soon.

17022,"They weren't necessarily suffering from Covid, just infected enough to flip the test."
17023,How long does that take?
17024,I'm unsure from the article as to what tests they were given when they landed.
17025,"If there was any doubt, they would have been given PCR as the shortcomings of the RAT are known."
17026,Thank you.
17027,This puts things in context and perspective
17028,Here we go!
17029,Because supposedly it has more mutations than delta but other than that it's still the same virus.

17041,"That was before there were seven billion hosts with about a billion of those able to travel anywhere in the world within 24 hours, faster than seroconversion."
17042,We are updating the history books.
17043,"The 'neutered' variant should also be close enough to the more dangerous variants to give immune response that also protects against the dangerous variant, almost acting as an involuntary 'vaccine'."
17044,"If there isn't enough cross-immunity generated by this, we will just have two separate variants and the more deadly variant will continue rampaging through the population."
17045,It seems like the biggest fear with the 'O' variant is that it is different enough from the original variant that it may be able to bypass most of the spike-protein based vaccines and some natural immunity as well.
17046,Not those on the cocktail
17047,[removed]
17048,This would only be the case if they are not under treatment.
17049,Those on the cocktail do not have weakened immune systems
17050,This!
17051,Why are people freaking out without any information on severity of symptoms?
17052,"Is South Africa getting an influx of patients in hospitals, particularly vaccinated patients?"
17053,I need this data before I start freaking out.
17054,I’m feeling ok fully vaccinated and boosted right now.
17055,I agree.
17056,This is the only information available at the moment.
17057,We definitely need to see more research.
17058,"You're probably right about REGN-COV2, which was made in response to the pandemic and under EUA just like the vaccines, but monoclonal antibody drugs have been used to treat autoimmune disorders since the 80s."
17059,"They have plenty of vaccines, the problem is not enough people want them there."
17060,Not too different from the US.

17062,Taiwan and some other countries have managed enforced border quarantines quite well.
17063,"So ignore what SA government says because they have an agenda and financial motive to lie

17064,"[SIGH]

Guys this is a bureaucratic designation that makes it possible for the state government to enact certain executive orders regarding emergency supplies and funding *if needed."

17066,Chill the fuck down.
17067,"His aides likely told him that he can only beat gop candidate, but that frozen dog poop could also beat that candidate"
17068,But South Africa isn’t missing cases.
17069,They have like a 2 percent positivity rate.
17070,"As an expert with a lot of experience, I see this headline as ""click bait"" optimistic at best."
17071,Either way it should result in an increased percentage of the population being vaccinated
17072,Absolutely.
17073,Literally an elementary school shooting and I could still buy a gun at Walmart.
17074,Go touch some grass
17075,And so what begins?
17076,Any Intel on how much more deadly this is than delta?
17077,&gt;Do you mean that like all the people in countries like Sweden and Denmark where the mask wearing is super low have sociopathic tendencies?
17078,Go out and touch grass or something you seem like you are in a dire need of a reality che

17084,"Apparently it is already in Italy, where I live... damn it."
17085,"Seriously, they just talked about this variant yesterday, for the first time!"
17086,And a day later we already found a case in my country...
17087,!remindme 5 days
17088,**citation needed
17089,Could be the alpha lineage as well.
17090,"I wish ""significantly deadlier"" was enough for people to take it seriously."
17091,Please clap
17092,"yep, kept getting emails from my boss on Thanksgiving."
17093,Worked 12 hours yesterday to design sequences to order and doing that again today for the B.1.640 variant that is coming out.
17094,Looks like I'm not going home for Christmas and probably working over christmas.
17095,Gotta get these into mice and establish models.
17096,"It's been moving quick since the 25th, shit is wild."
17097,"We could not even keep our bleep at home long enough to get rid of Covid Vanilla, we absolutely needed to go out and keep it alive."
17098,"It matters because it infects people, makes them sick and sometimes kills them."
17099,If it were a bacteriophage infecting an obscure archaea in some hotsprings somewhere few would pay attention.
17100,If it were a bacteriophage infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis it would gather a cheering squad.
17101,'Dead' is about the most serious 'implication' imaginable.
17102,Top this off with being highly contagious with the potential to become more so.
17103,"If there is a possibility of 'doing something', which there is, to reduce the death rate then the research becomes high priority."
17104,You have to find the 'somethings' before you can do them.
17105,As to the 'final balance' nobody knows - or *can* know - at this time.
17106,"The most likely outcome in my opinion is that it will finally settle down to become a low level endemic problem, but who knows when."
17107,The more that is known about the virus the faster that balance can be achieved even though the worst impediments to date have been political and economic rather than scientific.
17108,Hooray that's where I live.
17109,And it was England Vs **South Africa** last week.
17110,You can’t fix stupid
17111,You’re an ass
17112,Or is it just the RAT is best given a few days after exposure?
17113,"At the early stages, it doesn't react too well hence the need to repeat tests after a few days if you think you may have been at risk."
17114,What is this narrative?
17115,"""The world is sick of this shit?"""
17116,Do you think lockdowns are for someone entertainment?
17117,"They are a necessary measure to preserver society as much as it is, without risking to have people locked out of hospitals when they will all need them , all at the same time."
17118,Jesus Christ
17119,"Wow take it easy
This variant is going to be everywhere within a few weeks."
17120,"It is not the end of the world

Society is still functioning as normal"
17121,The problem with the data is probably that it doesn’t exist.
17122,Sequencing takes money.
17123,RT-PCR takes money.
17124,That can be in quite short supply in Africa.
17125,Note: I’m *not* blaming Africa for poverty.
17126,"However, it would be in the enlightened self-interest of wealthier countries to help Africa with its sequencing infrastructure."
17127,"Low apparent cases in Africa may be due to two things: a lack of testing due to insufficient resources, and a younger population age distribution resulting in more mild and asymptomatic cases."
17128,But the virus can still circulate and evolve.
17129,Are you familiar with lineage B.1.640 that seems to have recently come out of the Republic of the Congo and is now spreading in France?

17139,"God, we need good news for once."
17140,I really hope we can all catch a break.
17141,I hope so for the doctors and nurses especially!
17142,"Who remembers the time that German ""expert"" tried to write a hit piece Twitter thread on Chise and he ended up deleting it?"
17143,Not to mention not killing off those still vulnerable like the elderly and immune compromised.
17144,But I guess people only care about themselves.
17145,This thing is popping up like mushrooms all over the globe
17146,Some people are saying people in Southern Africa say it is just like the sniffles/cold.
17147,Thats it.
17148,Anyone know?
17149,Its been everywhere and we would have been non the wiser if it wasn't reported in the news.
17150,"Ah I see, thanks!"
17151,"Is it possible, if the Omicron becomes the dominant variant, that it would overtake Delta?"
17152,And maybe it's more transmittable but less lethal than Delta?
17153,Nobody who hasn’t cared before is going to care now
17154,"&gt;There's no way US citizens actually have supervised, forced quarantine when arriving back."
17155,That would require our country to have taken this seriously at some point.
17156,Instead we half-assed everything.
17157,:(
17158,"That or they simply say “ there’s no new variant, it’s just the media scaring people”"
17159,"If that is the case, and this is highly contagious, couldn't this be the mild variant that ends up dominant and helps usher us out of the severe phase of the pandemic?"
17160,[removed]
17161,"Loosened some measures end of September, and since then the reproduction number has been a steady 1.2."
17162,The reproduction number being (slightly) above 1 with similar measures as during the summer is probably due to less ventilation with the colder weather.
17163,Also most people are tired of all the measures and don't follow them as much as before.
17164,"Leave slight exponential growth unchecked for too long and you end up with a giant surge, exactly like this one."
17165,And the sewage measurements check out: https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/landelijk/rioolwater
17166,Why?
17167,If 61 are infected and barely knew that could be fantastic news.
17168,Well eventually.
17169,"It can take years or might never happen, see flu for instance."
17170,You made a general statement that is incorrect.
17171,I pointed out your mistake and you have doubled down.
17172,Internet 101.
17173,I wonder how long the variant has been out there.
17174,Probably a good chance its already spread to other countries
17175,Very likely.
17176,This has been spreading in South(ern) Africa for at least two weeks now and flights were only halted as of yesterday.
17177,I work in retail and we were lucky to get a break after last year's madness.
17178,I feel bad for healthcare workers.
17179,You didn't get a break and I am so sorry for that.
17180,I'm amazed at your strength.
17181,I would not of been able to take it for this long.
17182,You mean like Oxford-AstraZeneca and their pledge to not profit from the vaccine while the pandemic lasts?
17183,I guess that meant they didn't have enough money for propaganda and lobbying.
17184,"Hi, Belgian here."
17185,The situation was getting verry bad verry quickly.
17186,"These measures were planned before, we also had less strict measures one or two weeks ago."
17187,It all happened before this variant was found here in Belgium.
17188,Did people really think this was the game changer?
17189,thanks to masks flu cases also declined to near zero.
17190,wearing mask isn't hard at all.

17198,Exactly
17199,"So any species that's figured out ""x/y &lt; x"" :["
17200,&gt;So let’s shut down the world because we might get the sniffles?
17201,"""Mild"" in a clinical sense - even before Covid - has nothing to do with ""mild"" in the colloquial sense."
17202,"I had Covid, it was clinically mild and yet the worst illness I ever had, maybe even with long-term effects (but could also just that I got somewhat overweight during the last two years because I eat too much)."
17203,"Also, I once had a wound of like 5mm and when I went to the hospital, it was classified as ""surface"" wound as no organs or other important stuff was affected."
17204,Pubs shut early in England last year.
17205,Scotland also had early closing I think.
17206,Just meant everyone piled out the pubs/ restaurants at the same time.
17207,Makes perfect sense 😂
17208,I expect a Navy Seal copypasta for this please

17210,Fair enough.
17211,"Germany is where I lived but I saw a lot of the same in multiple countries, excluding like Croatia lol."
17212,"I see multiple reports from SA saying they're positive vaccines still work at preventing serious disease, 'based on initial data from cases in South Africa'."
17213,What data are they talking about exactly?
17214,[removed]
17215,Yes they showed a negative test to get on the plane.
17216,And now 60 people are positive.
17217,Seems like the new strain is very transmissible.
17218,I heard some experts say 5x as transmissible as the Delta variant.
17219,"Yeah, it might require us to get artificial limbs and time travel."
17220,(Thanks for the VLR reference)
17221,Yeah would put us at 2000 deaths per day and 300.000 infections per day at Christmas.
17222,I don't think they will let that happen.

17226,In the US here.
17227,Just curious if anyone knows what briefing happened to cause NY to already declare a state of emergency?
17228,Or maybe I’m misunderstanding- was NY already at a high case load and they’re bracing for Omicron?

17233,Belgium already did and they released the info on their situation report released on November 26.
17234,"They reviewed the last 250,000 PCR samples (which covered a timeframe of one month) and found a prevalence rate of 2.2% with that deletion."
17235,"The majority had low viral load so they didn’t view them as suspicious, but a small portion (47 samples) had high viral load and those began increasing in frequency  in the last week of the month reviewed."
17236,Sydney or Melbourne?
17237,Sigh.
17238,"Buys TP and pasta, puts on sweat pants and gets ready to watch Tiger King."
17239,Deja Vu all over again.
17240,10-14 days is our doubling rate here in Germany as far as I know
17241,Is there any chnace that the Omicron is responsible for the recent surge in Europe?
17242,"I know loosening the restrictions usually causes the increase in cases, but the sudden burst in infection feels out of nowhere..."
17243,[removed]
17244,Omega is yet to come.
17245,"There is a sensible reason: travel bans work great if you catch a new pathogen early on before it can spread abroad, a good example is the way ebola outbreaks are handled."

17261,tested positive for what?
17262,the new omicron variant?
17263,I do when i remember mask most people have largely gotten used to covid at this point most of my immediate family have had to self isolate at some point or another its just become a part of life at this point
17264,Just makes me think of the omicromians from futurama and Omicron periesi 8.
17265,i think the spanish flu ended because of a combination of people being vaccinated and the unvaccinated mostly dying
17266,I don't know that we can trust you as just fully vaccinated because you haven't made it clear that you've gotten the booster shot as well
17267,I’ve just started it
17268,Make sure you get travel insurance
17269,You've got to isolate from when you arrive so there is no point coming.
17270,"Most people I know that aren't vaccinated, never will be, without extreme pressure."
17271,In the form of tens of thousands of dollars.
17272,"Quite a few of them have had friends or family have an ""adverse reaction"" to the vaccine, or already had covid."
17273,So my understanding is that the removal of quarantine for international arrivals into these states is because of our high vaccination rates.
17274,But if the new variant is able to evade vaccine induced immunity then vaccination means bugger-all.
17275,I would assume it's the transmissbility.
17276,But I haven't looked into that.
17277,For how long time?????

17284,Politicians and markets always act rationally.
17285,Yup.
17286,I got Pfizer and my second dose was 7.5 weeks after my first.
17287,But if this new variant evades vaccines then that doesn’t really matter :(
17288,Did you get your 7th shot already?
17289,8 are more effective than 6.
17290,[removed]
17291,"When properly used, a bidet removes all offensive material from the area."
17292,You use the TP to tap dry.
17293,They the covid vaccines clearly didn't work and they'll need to continue to make brand new vaccines 2-3 times a year in some super safe effort to save lives while singlehandedly ignoring the things that cause the larger percentage of deaths in this country.
17294,Just a guess though.
17295,Caution and cancelling all your plans and becoming a hermit are very different
17296,Yeah Biden's words on the waiver are vacuous bullshit given the way things work at the WTO.

17309,Our country was left out of Pfizer's agreement because we are not poor enough....
17310,So basically ... Darwinism
17311,You need more information like how many of each group are in the hospital and what the overall vaccination rate and demographics are like in the country.
17312,If for example they have a 25% vaccination rate and 25% of patients are vaccinated you would surmise the vaccine isn't working.
17313,"Or if they only have a few cases, there isn't enough data to tell if you're just seeing statistical noise."
17314,You've probably already seen but the new variant is in the UK.
17315,Take care.
17316,"I mean yeah, work, school and pubs will all be major infection zones."
17317,"It seems like a plaster on a hemorrhaging wound but even if it slows it down a little bit, it's worth it especially if we see it evading immunity and covid wards start filling up again."
17318,Or letting us produce them
17319,"I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!"
17320,"We don't know yet, if omicron is as contagious as some doomsayers predict, the whole world will be a corona party soon."
17321,Not just the Japanese!
17322,And double the distance to 12 feet and make that permanent too …
17323,"If current vaccines are so good at reducing spread, why politicians of the countries with good healthcare systems and high proportion of vaccinated population are panicking right now, and stock markets are in storm?"
17324,Because their analysts already know the remarkable potential of the new strain.
17325,"""Back to normal"" slogans won't work anymore, and current contracts for outdated vaccines are screwed too."
17326,"In other words, current strategy has already failed."
17327,They had two years to develop a working mechanism to adapt vaccines to new strains and to distribute them really fast and effectively.
17328,Do they require a negative test to fly to the US?
17329,[removed]
17330,"It should, but there are a lot of syllables in Omicron..."
17331,It is impossible to contain this virus.
17332,It was impossible from the start and its impossible with any of these variants.
17333,It is way too transmissible and insufficiently lethal to contain.
17334,"Nothing fundamentally changes, just get vaccinated."
17335,"Delta established everyone is catching this virus and there's no ""herd immunity"" and it'll kill around 2% of the people who don't get vaccinated."
17336,"Nothing about that is likely to change much, other than small tweaks one way or another to that percentage value."
17337,And there will be new variants every 6-12 months for the next 50 years.
17338,When do we decide they're not worth headlines any more?
17339,It’s out there.
17340,This variant has more mutations than any other variant up until now.
17341,It has outpaced delta in South Africa at a speed not earlier seen in this pandemic.
17342,Boutta go viral
17343,"I think they meant less symptomatic as in ""very few people need to be treated in a hospital when they have it""."
17344,"Serious question:

Do you not wipe after using the bidet?"
17345,"I mean, instead of smeared poo on your cheeks, isn't it more like a poo slushy?---- still need to wipe, only easier to get all the poo out?"
17346,"Sorry, I'm about as ignorant as they come with bidets."
17347,the problem is that being more contagious creates higher rates of infection which one turn brings opportunity for mutation - and i wouldn't want this one getting any deadlier.
17348,it's imperative to drastically reduce and control the infection load in any given population.
17349,"&gt;Well if talking and mandating doesn't work, than what will?"

Yep."
17397,"When Belgium confirmed that they had a positive case, I was concerned."
17398,"When they followed it up by saying that the person who tested positive had returned from Africa two weeks ago and just started feeling ill and getting tested... yeah, that's game."
17399,"Two weeks of potential uncontrolled spread, plus the positive case in China again, add a sprinkle of ""we're worried about this so we're going to shut down travel from these places...in three days"" from the US and now it's ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss"" time."
17400,"If you actually look at the data,  the earliest indication is that it is more contagious,  but also more mild and less deadly."
17401,"Which is,  by the way,  how most viruses tend to evolve."
17402,The alarmist media has successfully convinced millions of people that virus mutation=bad.
17403,"I visited Copenhagen, Christiania for New Year, welcoming 2020."
17404,It was great.
17405,One of the last trips before shut down.
17406,"Christiania is completely nuts for a wealthy, digitised country."
17407,Perfect alternative place with its grungy crazy places
17408,The flu vaccine system chugs along pretty well.

17410,Repeat a year later.

17414,[removed]
17415,Thanks.
17416,I was trying to understand the hype.
17417,It seems people are having a hard time accepting permanent life with covid forever.
17418,But I knew this as soon as I found out covid was a RNA virus and not a DNA virus.
17419,So covid will forever mutate.
17420,!RemindMe 2 weeks
17421,I actually don’t think Africa is the place to look regarding severity.
17422,"For whatever reason (genetics, environment, whatever), their population has fared well with COVID and the other variants."
17423,Europe is the place to watch
17424,"It displaced delta extremely rapidly in SA, which does indicate that it's more transmissible."
17425,"We don't *know* yet, but it's better to err on the side of caution."

17441,"That's a bit of an exaggeration, but they \*are\* likely more robust to variations than the antibodies."
17442,Some discussion on the topic: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7)
17443,So glad my family is all boosted up.
17444,Everyone except for my 10 yo.
17445,"I was able to get myself, husband, and two over 12 boosted with no issues (no idea how, just walked in, filled out paperwork, got shot)."
17446,That depends on the incubation period and if it's transmissible during that time.
17447,You could easily have a virus where you are contagious with no symptoms and then after 10 days you are suddenly very sick and then die.
17448,More than possible and we have seen it already with covid in some cases.
17449,Damn I wish!
17450,It's a direct quote and please no need for personal attacks.
17451,This is a science subreddit.
17452,The U.S. being at 70% or 100% is meaningless to someone that is vaccinated.
17453,All the screechers below fail to realize there is a world outside the United States.
17454,What's the suggestion to get the vaccination rate up in the rest of the world to prevent mutations?
17455,Delta and Omnicron weren't created by the antivax here in America.
17456,"Get a life, stop obsessing over the dumb anti vaxxers like most of the posters on this board."
17457,"I have heard fair share of doc not ""encourage"" taking."

17459,Does anyone have any word of the details of this strain vs previous strains?
17460,I don't know about the Russian vaccines but the mRNA booster brings protection against Delta back to initial levels.
17461,"Delta doesn't particularly need different antibodies, just more of them."
17462,Yeah I gave you the benefit of the doubt that you knew that variants of interest were the only important ones.

17472,How is literally being hospitalized not a hospitalization?
17473,These experts aren't very smart.
17474,Anyone who wanted a vaccine has one..or three.
17475,Those people are ok with a vaccine but who were too lazy to figure out have mandates to make them do it.
17476,"The rest are die hards who won't be getting the vaccine, and will die in droves."
17477,It was to be expected.
17478,Yesterday two flights landed just after a travel ban was imposed.
17479,"These flights were isolated from the rest, or at least, that was the plan."
17480,"It ended up in chaos when passengers needed to be tested, and it took many hours to get the first test results in: ten per cent (!)"
17481,was tested positive.
17482,And despite that this was the very first time that the  Netherlands imposed hotel quarantines (after two years!)
17483,there were many people that were allowed to await their results at home regardless of the chance that it could be positive or even be omicron.
17484,"It is exemplar for how Schiphol, and by extension, the Netherlands, treated potential threats."
17485,Probably their score in the ability to stop the virus is in the bottom for large airports.
17486,"Because being proactive can screw with your economy, make people scared, miserable, and damage the trust the populace has with its policy makers.. so yeah, there's that.."
17487,"*should*

*^(but won't)*"
17488,I guess.
17489,I don't understand people's obsession with abbreviations that nobody knows nowadays.
17490,It’s been compulsory to wear face masks in these places everywhere apart from England in the U.K. I’m in Wales and the rules on masks never changed.
17491,Wish they’d correctly report on just England….
17492,Assuming your recording to the ivermectin thing why is this still a talking point?
17493,Its such a wack topic to discuss simply because of how much its been disproven and debunked.. you dont even need to do much digging into ivermectins history to learn that i was made for humans.. the whole livestock medication is dumb because its like ragging on someone for drinking water because its commonly used as a means to provide cattle with hydration?
17494,Genuinely intrigued in what you would have to say on this
17495,Trueeeee
17496,That was 16 days ago.
17497,"That means 16 days ago, this variant had spread across Africa enough to infect random visitors from Europe."
17498,"This points to the variant not being new, right?"
17499,"I mean, the newest, but not brand new in the last two weeks like has been reported."
17500,It’s been spreading for at least a few months.
17501,Because people already use omi to describe omnivores.
17502,"This is precisely the issue, all the more developed nations have been vaxing larger proportions of their population and the rest of the world get neglected and creates a perfect recipe for this stuff happening."
17503,All we can realistically hope is that the virus even if it is more transmittable that it’s perhaps weaker with this mutation.
17504,Not very sick at all.
17505,Both in their late 60s.
17506,The worst of it was only about 1 day feeling tired and generally unwell.
17507,"After about a week one has a mild cough, the other no symptoms at all."
17508,Not sure they would have faired so well without the vaccine.
17509,Especially as one has a lot of underlying illnesses.
17510,And it’s a trade-off of risks: the risk involved with catching covid unvaccinated greatly outweighs any risk that the new vaccine may pose.
17511,"To me, it is that simple."
17512,I think you got confused somewhere along the way.
17513,You were apparently under the impression that Texas was equal to or greater than Switzerland in freedom and reported happiness.
17514,You were downvoted because that's an absolutely insane take.
17515,"I showed you proof that you were way off, and now you're trying to deny the data to justify Texas' outrageous incarceration rate."
17516,Lemme guess.
17517,You've been told places like Switzerland and Finland are communist hellholes and your brain literally won't allow you to accept that they measure better than the US in nearly every metric.
17518,It's been my understanding since like May-June that this was a widely known thing; that vaccinated immunity is more reliable than natural immunity.
17519,Was this not the popular understanding?
17520,I've personally seen countless individuals including loved ones claim their natural immunity meant they didn't need the shot.
17521,Better than the articles that are acting like this is COVID: The Sequel
17522,The real question is how severe the disease is on the double vaccinated imo
17523,Also we have a huge amount of mid to upper income international workers who travel home for holidays etc…
17524,So far.
17525,If anyone in the NHS is reading this.
17526,"I will be masked up, washing hands etc and avoiding big gatherings."
17527,"You won't be seeing me this Christmas, unless it's because I ate too many mince pies and need my stomach pumped."
17528,[removed]
17529,This place is an echo chamber.
17530,I don't find the vaccines personally to be a political issue.
17531,"If the vaccines are effective, and also potentially partially responsible for mutations among other things, then won't we need a shot every 200 days?"
17532,"Look I'm not anti Vax, far from it."
17533,I've gotten just about every vaccine out there.
17534,So have my kids.
17535,But this just doesn't seem to make logical sense.
17536,"After omi, what's next?"
17537,Another variant needing another shot?
17538,Don't any of you find this at least a little bit of an issue?
17539,fine i'll bite.
17540,"i do think that is the only way, i don't wish for that to be the only way."
17541,"but for the 'unfortunate' bit you're hung up on, i'll try and set it up like a trolley problem so you can hopefully grasp the missing piece to the puzzle."
17542,situation: X amount of unvaxxed die to reach 90% full vaccination status.

track 2: instantly."
17547,full herd immunity.
17548,"hospitals are suddenly liberated from the weight of the unvaxxed, etc etc."
17549,"honest question, do you now understand where the application of the word 'unfortunate' is in this scenario?"
17550,"to give you a hint, it's italicized."
17551,Yes same here!
17552,Three jabs and an n95!
17553,!
17554,"Stay strong, my friend."
17555,Stay strong.
17556,"&gt; Also, people who've been ""anti-vax"" in social circles and later started to realize they were wrong but didn't want to admit it have an Nu excuse to get vaccinated without admitting they were wrong...

That’s a really good point."
17557,Nu/Omicron gives them an out.
17558,the problem is they're active breeding mills for new variants
17559,All this does is make it harder for S. Africa.
17560,Willing to bet most countries will have O. variant cases in 3-4 days.
17561,"You’d still lose, Covid has killed a lot of people but there’s zero chance that it ends up killing everyone"
17562,It's too late.
17563,Cases are popping everywhere.
17564,Just like delta…
17565,They'll have to write them out of the script.
17566,"They can say they died from a pandemic, how convenient!"
17567,I got my first dose in February 2021 and and second dose in March *kicked*.
17568,*my*.
17569,*ass*.
17570,I’m a runner at a healthy weight with no medical/health issues and I’d been tested in mid January due to a potential exposure (negative).
17571,🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m getting my booster this week and I’ve already planned on taking the next day off based on my 2nd dose reaction.
17572,FWIW I get a solid 12-18 hour fatigue and muscle aches from the annual flu shot as well.
17573,"If its really 75% of all cases in SA then its is out competing Delta, and we are well and truly fucked."
17574,When do the vaccine MANDATES start?
17575,Question: Are there long-term risks of vaccine-induced myocarditis?
17576,The reason I'm asking is a thread in a certain disinformation sub which shall not be named here.
17577,That thread claims vaccine-induced myocarditis has a 50% mortality rate in the first 5 years.
17578,"I fully expect this to be disinformation like everything else in that sub, but since I'm not a medical expert myself, I could use a bit of help [debunking](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisinformationWatch) it."
17579,Here's what I got so far.
17580,"There is indeed some evidence that *viral* myocarditis carries long term risks:

&gt; All patients diagnosed or suspected to have acute myocarditis should be admitted to the hospital and be monitored for hemodynamic instability."
17581,"Immediate complications of myocarditis include ventricular dysrhythmias, left ventricular aneurysm, CHF, and dilated cardiomyopathy."
17582,The mortality rate is up to 20% at 1 year and 50% at 5 years.
17583,"Despite optimal medical management, overall mortality has not changed in the last 30 years."
17584,"source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/

But I assume there is a huge difference between myocarditis that was caused by a viral infection - like COVID-19 - and myocarditis that is an adverse effect of vaccination."
17585,I assume the latter is more easily treatable and has significantly lower long-term risks.
17586,"However, I do seem to remember reading somewhere that for people under 18 the risk of contracting myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination is higher than the risk of contracting myocarditis from COVID-19 infection."
17587,Can anybody help me untangle this a bit?
17588,I mean Delta Airlines did some linguistic gymnastics when announcing their handling of the Delta variant policy.
17589,Italy has confirmed 5 cases of COVID Omicron involving a business traveler who arrived from Mozambique on November 11.
17590,There is household transmission.
17591,2 of the 5 infected are school-age children.
17592,Germany has confirmed two cases of COVID Omicron in business travelers who traveled from South Africa on November 24.

17594,&gt;You do have to take sentences in their context and not just cherry-pick things people say in order to make them look bad.

17600,"&gt;	Sharon Peacock, professor of public health and microbiology at Cambridge university, said the R value, which measures an epidemic’s growth rate, was estimated at 1.93 for Gauteng, where Omicron is concentrated."

17604,"Wearing a mask is not big deal, at all, and is one of the better tools we have to contain the pandemic."
17605,"Similarly, we can’t hold the virus to a deadline or time commitment, nor can we reasonably expect the virus to compromise and agree to an early withdrawal."
17606,Why is wearing a mask suck a big deal to you?
17607,Have you considered that a conversation about it with your therapist might be helpful?
17608,Point was that 'omi' is just as dumb.
17609,Transmissibility.
17610,"From an *individual* perspective, you care about severity."
17611,How bad is it if you catch it?
17612,"But from a *public health* perspective, transmissibility is far more important."
17613,"Even if it's not severe on average, it'll be severe in *some people*, so 10x as many people catching a disease is far worse, in terms of burden on the hospital system, than the disease getting more severe."
17614,Omicron is mostly concerning now because it's *unknown*.
17615,Is it more severe?
17616,Is it more transmissible?
17617,Is it more evasive (vaccine-resistant)?
17618,"The answer to all three of these questions now is ""we don't know."""
17619,"If the answer to 2 or 3 of them turns out to be ""no,"" we will stop caring about Omicron."
17620,"But for now, it's media panic field day until we get answers."

17635,"No, they will be shot down ala 1981 Escape from New York style."
17636,Leaves about 25 million unvaccinated.
17637,It's very alarming that many people are so brainwashed to the point that it overrides their instinct to survive.
17638,So do we know if its more lethal than delta?
17639,I know its more contagious but the severity of infection?
17640,Or is it too soon to tell.
17641,Best case is it isnt as lethal.

17646,No.
17647,Wrong metric.
17648,You need to look at the number of hospitalized per 100k vaxxed.
17649,"If you have 50 million vaxxed and 10 million unvaxxed, 65% of hospitalizations being vaxxed people sounds bad."
17650,Lol.
17651,Nice vaccine you got there.
17652,"While they are trained on spike proteins, the whole point of somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation is so that the trained response can adapt to a modestly different antigen."
17653,There were a few good papers showing breadth of response of T cells and affinity maturation of B cells in this context a few months back.

17722,"But there are countries that exist with incredibly low vaccination rate and a high prevalence of COVID, so  even if Japan or US or whoever reached 100%, they would still have COVID, as vaccination does not prohibit you from getting the virus, and those lower vaccination rate countries would keep providing the opportunity to mutate and replicate"
17723,"They are probably saying 500% more transmissible, equivalent to 6x more transmissible."
17724,This is essentially not possible; Delta has a secondary attack rate of 20-25% so increasing that six-fold would give a value over 100%.
17725,"(By comparison, measles has a 80-90% secondary attack rate.)"
17726,What is true is that Omicron is increasing roughly 5x per week in Johannesburg while Delta cases are constant.
17727,So this means it's outcompeting Delta 5x per week.
17728,Immune escape (reinfections that are contagious) can play some role in that.
17729,"But since the serial interval of (pre-Omicron) Covid is considerably less than a week that does not mean it's ""spreading 5x faster""."
17730,The time interval must be included in any honest comparison.
17731,Isolate at home?

17735,That is incorrect.
17736,Covid has mutated dozens and dozens of times.

17738,The news doesn't cover the routine variants.
17739,"Only the exceptional ones,  such as Delta."

17747,"Which by the sound of it, is the only thing which would slow Omicron."
17748,God save the Queen and our NHS employees.
17749,Here comes winter.
17750,Boris Johnson in the UK just said that Omicron spreads easily between the double vaccinated.
17751,the vaccine was never going to stop people from getting it.
17752,"It was intended to reduce severity, hospitalizations, and death."
17753,It IS doing that.
17754,We still need more information on if it reduces Long Covid though.
17755,"Because not dying is great, but becoming disabled from it is not what anyone wants."

17759,"The scientists do have preliminary information with regards to how heavily the new variant is mutated and where those mutations are located (it’s got twice the number of “bad mutations” in the spike protein area as Delta did, and these specific mutations point to a likelihood that the variant could be much more transmissible than Delta and have the potential to evade the vaccine)."
17760,"Further, we also know that approximately 90% of the new cases they’re seeing  in South Africa are Omicron, so there’s evidence that the concerns about transmissibility are founded."
17761,lmao what

17777,They’re not going to stop.
17778,It’s a way of life now.
17779,Sequencing isn’t an easy process.

17782,"I’ll happily carry on as normal, unvaccinated with no papers to show for when the Gestapo arrive."
17783,"Nope, i am fully vaxed,  husband and I getting booster next week (also getting flu shot while im at it, gon a be fun) and a couple days later my kids are getting their second shot of pfizer."
17784,All the family members that i care enough about are also fully vaxed and some already boostered.
17785,At this point the unvaccinated (with the excpetion of immunocompromised that cannot get vaccine or allergies) made their own bed.
17786,"Worst case scenario i get a breakthrough case but i know it will be likely a mild one, i won't die and very low chances of getting long term effect."
17787,I ll wear my mask in public when required (indoor in my state) but i am no longer afraid.
17788,Not doing their part?
17789,With exceptional sequencing and reporting this as soon as it reached significance?
17790,What an entitled western take.
17791,"Currently on Day 7 of being stuck in my parents' basement, after a positive test right after I came home for Thanksgiving."
17792,Are we really going to isolate for 10 days at a time every winter for the rest of our lives?
17793,"It seems like we should *eventually* move on, and just wear a mask in public but otherwise go back to normal life despite infections."

17813,"&gt;for a mutation to be dominant, highly transmissible but also very mild, symptom-wise?"
17814,"Meaning, this could take over as the version people are catching but it’s like a Covid-Lite s

17883,If you had you shots 8 weeks apart you much stronger immunity then if you followed the 3-4 week dosing schedule.
17884,In Canada with the 8 weeks between doses it has a 80-90% efficacy against delta infection.. Slightly less for AZ/Mrna but still in the 90s.
17885,This is based on two studies that came out of QC and BC.
17886,if you had  az/mrna like my you have the highest efficacy against hospitalization and death..

17927,"I'm now following this new variant like everyone else - but when I first heard about it I did a google (well, actually a DuckDuckGo) and I was surprised by how many businesses were named omicron."
17928,There were literally a few pages (on my phone) of businesses with that name.
17929,Not sure how naming these things go - but even if those businesses are small and have no claims on their name it probably creates a fucked up situation for them.
17930,Does WHO (or whichever entity) that does the naming even look to see if there are claims on a name?
17931,Or is their a taxonomy for this which businesses should be aware?
17932,What?
17933,They remain quite effective.
17934,What are you on about?

17946,They did.
17947,It turned out to be about as effective as the original vaccine.
17948,I feel so bad for hospital workers.
17949,Some reports say this is about 500% more infectious.
17950,South Africa is a country that relies on tourism and is publicly complaining about the flight bans being unreasonable.
17951,I’d definitely take these statements about vaccine effectiveness against the new variant with a grain of salt.

17985,A 20 old hasn't had the chance.
17986,Arguing otherwise is mental.
17987,The amount of years lost is important - working age people dying is more significant than pensioners dying for many reasons.
17988,When a grandparent dies in their 80s it is sad but not tragic  - everyone celebrates that they have lived a long and full life.

18124,"And as the promise of ""freedom after the vaccines"" looms ever further due to various reasons, more and more people are pushed to conspiracy."
18125,"Engage expert discerning views, have multi-panel debates (all I've seen on mainstream are extremely one sided panels, usually with almost illiterates representative of the opposing view, when in fact there are extremely literate discerners on alternative sources), allow people to hear the misinformation on the mainstream - if the truth is as compelling as we are told, it would win the day."
18126,"People would see why the misinformation is incorrect, and, most importantly, you would have all sides of the fence engaged in the same content, rather than living in polar opposite worlds of information."
18127,"AND, as a byproduct, you would end up with a much more educated, informed, and empathetic population."

18214,I had J&amp;J in March and 2nd Pfizer in mid-July.
18215,"Had antibody test done a couple weeks ago, and it was high."
18216,I’ve been on the fence on when to get the booster.
18217,Do you think I should get it now?
18218,“There is a new highly mutated virus that might make the vaccine less effective”  isn’t a very strong argument for getting vaccinated.
18219,I wouldn't be surprised if you guys already have it.
18220,My reaction to the second dose sucked as well.
18221,"Knocked me on my butt for a few days, took over a week to start feeling normal and even then my muscle stamina was reduced for maybe a week longer."
18222,"So far from the booster on Wednesday, have a sore shot spot, some fluid collection in the lymph node under my armpit on the same side which is annoying, fatigue and general muscle aches, but nowhere near as bad as that second shot."
18223,Probably closer to the first shot.

18255,"Because it's not particularly helpful and lacks context -- yes, Delta is dominant in SA."

18281,It is right.
18282,Though in some ways this variant showed up in the number of cases - just like with Alpha and Delta.
18283,"Cases spiked, they looked for explanation and then found variant"
18284,It says the mutations that are similar are linked to heightened transmissibility.
18285,"It also says the variant harbors a high number of mutations in the regions of the spike protein that antibodies recognize, potentially dampening their potency."
18286,"Other mutations look like they are likely  contributing to “further evasion,” and there are hints from computer modeling that the virus could dodge immunity conferred by T cells."

18325,It's being discovered in asymptomatic or mildly ill people who are traveling.

18519,"The fact that countries can't get cheap exploitable labor (that were of course taking jobs before) and whine about it is funny bc they immediately start eating their unprotected classes (elderly, children)."

18530,"He got covid end of oct, I got booster first week of November."
18531,I'm thankful I booked mine cuz clearly we were vulnerable
18532,Good to hear.
18533,I think this will def.
18534,accelerate the booster rates and 5-11 year old rates.
18535,Much less optimistic about people that never got vaxed before.
18536,"Phew, currently in the state with fam"
18537,It's a long flight and people have to unmask to eat.
18538,More positives incoming for sure... if they even bother to test them again

18543,"The government did jack shit to help those companies, yeah PPP was cool but I’ve spoken with plenty of bar owners who said if there were another lockdown that he would have to close for good."
18544,"(This guy owned the building and ran the bar for 30+ years)

PPP isn’t enough when you’re running a bar in DT LA or Sam Francisco or wherever."
18545,It’s a drop in the bucket.
18546,And with how many of these restaurants and bars closed for ever I am confident in my statement that the government didn’t do anything at all.
18547,I know.
18548,yes.
18549,perplexing.
18550,maybe a poor testing centre…we had those in the UK.
18551,"I don't believe a thing about their health minister, too lax about this variant, said ""give it to weeks to actually do something about it in our country"""
18552,Wow that’s actually really good to hear.
18553,"I don’t understand it, but whatever."
18554,Do we have any new information for this article?
18555,No.
18556,To be honest if it’s more contagious then delta and evades antibodies then it is almost completely unmanageable….

18561,I agree.
18562,Had to get a ride with my brother to the auto parts store yesterday.
18563,He stopped at two different liquor stores and wears this toy cloth mask that does jack shit.
18564,"He's like ""I don't want an n95, I wear MY masks""."
18565,"Ok cool buddy, makes literally zero sense to me and I'm not going anywhere with him if I can walk instead."
18566,I can’t honestly answer the “when” as I am not able to figure that out myself.

18575,Sitting in a restaurant.
18576,Fuck COVID
18577,Oh no.
18578,Anyways
18579,At least no one's feelings are being hurt by mandates though.
18580,So a few kids had it when they boarded and by the time they landed it had spread?
18581,The pandemic has been going on for almost 2 years now.
18582,We've been in hard lockdowns for half of that.
18583,We've vaccinated everyone we can.
18584,When exactly does international travel resume again?
18585,Vaccinations are the end of this.
18586,If we don't open up again after mass vaccinations then we're literally never going to.
18587,There is nothing else to come which will improve this situation after vaccinations.
18588,Lol  no we arent.

18591,"Yeah all I forsee is a lot of ""just in time for the holidays,  gotta keep everyone under control"" style messaging about to come from the antivax crowd."
18592,"At this point, nothing will convince those that have refused to get vaccinated so far- they've made it their whole personality, to change now would break them."
18593,How is it selfish to stay home and not get your family sick or spread the virus?
18594,It's what was advised by the cdc.

18607,"Sure, this is “mild”."
18608,It doesn't matter what we do going forward.
18609,This disease is going to mutate until it becomes deadly for a large percentage of the population.
18610,With air travel and such a large percentage of the world's population unvaccinated covid will continue to evolve.
18611,"Stupidity doesn't evolve, just ask a republican."
18612,Omicron concerns should spur thousands of experts to understand that anti-vaxxers are not going to be convinced by the latest variant.

18614,It's really sad how we've had almost two years of uni with some of our students only to have stepped in a proper lecture hall (or even just allows on campus) a few weeks ago.
18615,Only to now have them go back home and possibly finish their degrees without ever really having experienced uni life.
18616,At least the sociologists and psychologists will have new stuff to publish about...
18617,That’s why we all need to stop watching mainstream media
18618,The virus eventually runs of our immune naive people.
18619,The more it circulates the more the human population has immune systems adapted to fight it.
18620,It can be a game of cat and mouse but your comment is completely over the top.
18621,No top health officials think this is our future.
18622,[removed]
18623,I do t need elaboration on anything.
18624,Your sentence was crystal clear.
18625,Not at all.
18626,I thought people *everywhere* had to sow negative test results before boarding any flight.
18627,How are the rules so lax in some places and so restricted in others?
18628,"Makes it all quite useless, no?"
18629,Honesty is way more important than false modesty.
18630,"And indeed, honesty begins with acknowledging the bolded part of the sentence as well:

&gt; **The Netherlands have a great many flaws in my opinion**, but comparing that to the United States is like comparing Hendrik Lorentz to Louie Gohmert."
18631,"Merely acknowledging this as a superficial disclaimer and then ignoring it while it thoroughly kicks the chair from underneath any subsequent argument that flaws aren't acknowledged, is simply dishonest."
18632,I don't merely need to focus on infrastructure and intellect.
18633,"I could write a long jeremiad completely eviscerating the United States instead, especially after the past six years, or twenty, however you want to look at it, and that is *before* I compare and contrast just how superior this country is to the United States in practically every single way."
18634,"Now,  recall that OP mentioned smartness, and that is why I highlighted that point."
18635,"You would have done well to acknowledge that, too."
18636,"Again, honesty is the most important thing."
18637,"We are all guilty of flattering each other too much, while problems escalate."
18638,The Dutch approach to the pandemic has some severe weak spots.

18640,"Yes, all."
18641,"And as far as I'm concerned, not just temporarily, but ad infinitum."
18642,"But the important thing is, you’re staying positive"
18643,In the U.S.?
18644,Probably after the 2022 midterms.

18646,I hope it's true!
18647,(Not doubting what you saw and heard).
18648,My dad died of covid last week and someone in my Q-adjacent family secretly got vaccinated.
18649,So at least one of them got scared.
18650,"&gt;If they were put in another room, it would have decent ventilation but not HEPA filters."

18653,"Cuz it’s an anagram for moronic, the elites are taking the piss out of us"
18654,You should be numb cause drops mean nothing over decades.
18655,"If you look at a lot of people’s returns over like 25 years they are horrible because people are worrying, timing etc etc."
18656,Then eventually a lot of them say it’s rigged or to unpredictable.
18657,It is pretty predictable in 20 year chunks.
18658,People just want a lot of money NOW OR QUICKLY
18659,"My understanding is that CD4 are ""Helper"" T cells."
18660,"They don't make antibodies, that is B cells."
18661,"CD8 are ""Killer"" T cells."
18662,"They kill infected cells, and don't directly attack the virus."
18663,Detroit has a common layover airport...
18664,If only there was a body of people that had the capability to offer assistance to non essential workers so they don’t fall behind on their bills and can provide for their family while we lockdown to stop the spread of a deadly virus.
18665,Oh wait….we have that

18667,Hopefully they just want to get ahead of this and not have a sequel to overwhelmed hospitals.
18668,Hopefully
18669,I see you've fully internalized airline propaganda.
18670,"&gt;Still, I would rather be on an aircraft with everyone unmasked and all vaccinated, than an aircraft with everyone masked and only some vaccinated

Depends on how well masking is enforced."
18671,If masking was actually strictly enforced and real N95 or equivalent masks were required then I'd rather be on a plane of unvaccinated but masked people as that would put me at lower risk than a plane full of vaccinated but unmasked people.
18672,"Though honestly I'd much rather have both in place since the risk from a plane full of people that are both vaccinated and (actually wearing, not having it down while they spend an hour eating a bag of peanuts) masked people would be essentially zero risk."
18673,"Why does this joke, the largest joke, not simply eat the other jokes?"
18674,[removed]
18675,The vaccines were not widely available during the worst of Delta.
18676,Not an accurate comparison.
18677,"I agree that we should take this new variant seriously,  but we also shouldn't be too alarmist."
18678,There's no evidence that the vaccines are ineffective against Omicron.
18679,Yep.
18680,"Way too many people getting all up in my area at the gas station, check out lanes, etc that it still feels like it's a necessary precaution."
18681,"Possibly over a year, since the most similar lineage was sequenced more than a full year ago."
18682,Yeesh.
18683,"Most of these ""oh it could've been faked"" responses, in my experience lately,, are bad actors pushing a false narrative."
18684,"I mean no disrespect whatsoever, but I and many others in the US are so tired of bullshit getting pushed in favor of fact."
18685,"I appreciate your input and unique experience, and frankly, that makes me even more angry that people put personal inconveniences over the health of the population."
18686,That's flat awful.
18687,The new variant is so heavily mutated that it’s possible it could evade current vaccines (or at least render them significantly less effective).
18688,"&gt;This is baseless speculation

I think everything is, at this point."
18689,"Nobody has any bases, neither me, nor you, nor Fauci, nor South Africa."
18690,We're just building a base right now.
18691,[removed]
18692,Is SA/NL requiring some sort of test to fly?
18693,There's a possibility that this variant is giving false negative in a rapid antigen tests due to the changes in the Spike protein and other antigens.
18694,"Its giving a false negative for the Spike gene on TaqPath PCR, other genes are testing positive."
18695,This helps track it without the need for time consuming gene sequencing.
18696,Why would vaccination status matter when we know vaccinated people can still catch and spread COVID?
18697,It’s not just a small tiny percentage either.
18698,"If you think you’re safe, and safe from infecting others, because you’re vaccinated, you’re wrong."
18699,Vaccinated people are absolutely contributing to the spread at this point.
18700,I was fully vaccinated from the start and got COVID from another fully vaccinated person.
18701,That’s not an uncommon thing lately.
18702,"&gt;COVID was likely the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich in recent history

Do you have any sources, or is it just BS?"
18703,"&gt;After seeing how many small business failed during the first year, it's insane to me that people are still advocating for the return of lockdowns."
18704,Do you think the lockdowns had anything to do with that 'wealth transfer'?

18716,"Yeah, COVID hits everyone differently."
18717,"I got it pre-vaccine and it hit me hard, but it was like a bad flu."
18718,I didn't even lose my taste or smell.
18719,Meanwhile someone I know who had COVID at the same time (different exposure) had fucked up taste for months.
18720,So much talk about lockdowns on here as if they are just indisputably good and effective.
18721,You know that regular people need money to eat?
18722,That’s just how this whole thing works.
18723,"Lockdowns eat at the core of the economy by shutting down lots of production, so it’s not about money."
18724,There will be a shortage of actual things.
18725,All of these things need to be weighed but everyone in here thinks that lockdowns are somehow just a good thing for everyday people.

18736,"Which, per the cease fire agreement we have signed with COVID, makes it okay."
18737,"Markets plunged on Friday, hope of taming the coronavirus dimmed and a new term entered the pandemic lexicon: Omicron."
18738,The Covid-19 variant that emerged in South Africa was named after the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet.
18739,"The naming system, announced by the World Health Organization in May, makes public communication about variants easier and less confusing, the agency and experts said."
18740,"For example, the variant that emerged in India is not popularly known as B.1.617.2."
18741,"Rather, it is known as Delta, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet."
18742,"I have no desire to live in fear, but I do like to understand what’s going on in the world around me."
18743,"And while you are correct that Delta had heightened transmissibility and mutations, Omicron has over twice the number of “bad mutations” in the spike regions as Delta did."
18744,"Early modeling is suggesting that Omicron has the potential to be 500% more transmissible than Alpha, in addition to increased ability to evade the vaccine."
18745,"Obviously nothing is for sure yet, but what they do know is the concerning heavy mutations and the very fast spread in South Africa, hence the immediate global response."
18746,Probably not imo.
18747,Likely somewhere in Africa that's not sequenced.
18748,It has more genetic variation between different Omicron samples than you'd expect if it truly originated in November.
18749,Likely it has been around in an African country that doesn't do sequencing for a month or more.
18750,South Africa was just first to detect it - who knows where it could have originated.
18751,Omicron doesn’t understand the stock market is on a bull run until January and nothing stops a bull rally- move aside Omicron.
18752,[removed]
18753,Precisely because we don't know.
18754,For once i am happy countries are being proactive.
18755,If it turns out the variant is of little extra concern that is only better.
18756,"I have a question, and admittedly my knowledge of biology is at a 10th grade level from the 1960's, so I'm no expert by any means."
18757,I know that viruses mutate.
18758,Would it be possible for two different viruses to infect the same cell and then exchange genetic material?
18759,"For example, could a COVID-19 virus infect a cell that was also infected with an HIV virus?"
18760,"And as a result, could there by a hybrid HIV/COVID-19 virus?"

18767,They simply arent a political topic.
18768,"Rapid test is probably failing because it's testing for the Spike protein, but probably giving a false negative due to mutation."
18769,"The Spike is giving false negative in Taqpath PCR, S gene drop out helps track it."
18770,There's also reagents that can identify other variants.
18771,This is very wrong
18772,North America?
18773,"Ontario is still pretty aware, with a lot of protocols"
18774,"All you really need is a variant which triggers a massive immune response in young people, similar to what Spanish flu did."
18775,That would be a nightmare because you'll be incapacitating key workers.
18776,"I am not anti vax at all, but this variant made me actively pursue the booster."
18777,"I’ll need it in February (6 months), but if I wait on the government then it’s probably going to be a mess (non-western country)."
18778,I’m booking it with my private hospital.
18779,"Mu and Lambda did not outcompete Delta, and actually had strong evidence of being outcompeted by Delta at the time of their designation."
18780,"Omicron has evidence of outcompeting Delta, and does not have evidence of being outcompeted by Delta."
18781,Its spike protein is also much more unique than any variant's has been so far.
18782,Are you serious?
18783,"Because the vaccine doesn’t provide immunity, and vaccinated people can still spread COVID, and they are."
18784,Traveling for leisure during a global pandemic is moronic.
18785,"At the very least, full mask mandates should be in effect globally, regardless of vaccination status."
18786,Not to mention there will always be selective pressure for a variant that kills no one but infects everyone.
18787,"Now, that selective pressure is extremely low for COVID due to the incubation time, but it's still there."
18788,There is no timing the market.
18789,It has been shown over and over again.
18790,"I’ve made 10x the wealth the last 20 years as my friends who are always “thinking” this and that, calculating on random nonsense they don’t understand,  reading the headlines, getting in, getting out etc."
18791,It isn’t fast but it is pretty predictable over long cycles.
18792,Sure a person can luck onto a big bonanzas but 9 of 10 will lose big or miss out on further gains
18793,Was hopeful for this.
18794,I have been studying the virus since February 2020.
18795,I knew the CDC's recommendation that you could stop wearing masks if fully vaccinated was completely reckless.
18796,Europe was going through Delta and it was only a matter of time.
18797,"Once you removed the masks, it would be a fight to get them back."
18798,Now Delta is putting strain on our healthcare system and people still refuse to wear masks or not gather for the holidays.
18799,Everyone seems to think the pandemic is over.
18800,Even Biden blew $1 trillion on infrastructure.
18801,Now we have Omicron and it's hard to see a stimulus package after we already spent $1 trillion and have been dealing with rising inflation.
18802,"Single data point is single data point, but the man who brought it into Hong Kong was, and I believe stayed, asymptomatic."
18803,They caught it during his PCR testing while in routine quarantine after travel.
18804,"He was 2-dosed with Pfizer, but not boosted."
18805,You are saying those last two things with certainty that the experts aren't even claiming right now.
18806,We have no idea if it's less deadly because not enough time has passed.
18807,"Also, that thread right there, from someone smarter than you, surmises that actually vaccines will be at least slightly less effective."
18808,You are certain and you shouldn't be.
18809,Change that about yourself.
18810,Thank Germany and Merkel for [that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/merkel-pushes-back-on-vaccine-patent-waiver-in-clash-with-biden).

18821,A group of this subreddits members could more efficiently manage this pandemic better than any other government has.
18822,It would be nice if we were taken more seriously here and they would listen to our ideas more often.
18823,I think individualism is a stretch when you’re taking about people who’ve succumbed to propaganda.
18824,Honest question (that eventually morphed into several): why do governments around the world seem so reluctant to announce that Covid has become endemic and will never be wiped out?
18825,"When will the government announce that Covid is becoming endemic and that people should get boosters every year, possibly wear masks if needed and go about their lives?"
18826,I don’t recall any government official acknowledging this.
18827,I know there are a lot of stupid people out there but anyone with even an ounce of common sense and knowledge of human and viral behavior surely knows this.
18828,Quarantines are useful when a virus hasn’t yet metastasized throughout a population but Covid mutates way too quickly for any restrictions to work anymore.
18829,"No matter the precise efficacy of protection,  common sense tells us that more is better."
18830,I've had covid and I'm triple vaxxed.
18831,"Even if my chances of reinfection are low even without the vaccine,  I still can't think of a single good reason to not get vaccinated."

18835,It will not.
18836,"They will make more excuses, cite more BS social media posts, and continue to be selfish, ignorant assholes."
18837,Holy shit.
18838,Are they going to be able to get back to the US?
18839,"In South Africa it’s hesitancy, and not a supply issue for the low vaccination rate."
18840,They have plenty of vaccines but no takers.
18841,Most countries have enough vaccines at this point.
18842,Vaccine availability is not an issue.
18843,Reading this feels like January 2020 all over again.
18844,No more potlucks.
18845,Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
18846,"Because if 2 countries have roughly equal covid case loads, flying between them is irrelevant."
18847,Why da f do you need a new kinda vaccine?
18848,Why Pfizer Moderna Sputnik commenting about new vaccine at this point.
18849,Is this the beginning of real pandemic.
18850,[removed]
18851,The media is bored of Delta.
18852,"If people are not getting that sick from it more often who are vaccinated and asymptomatic, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not a big deal for those with weaken immunity who are staying home and less exposed."
18853,If it's more infectious that's very bad for those who need to avoid it.
18854,There will me more people who will not think they're sick and expose the more vulnerable people.
18855,"The earliest detection was found in the place that has the highest number of cases of it though (South Africa) 

Couldn't the reason that it hasn't been detected aside from travel and contact-with-travelers outside of SA simply be because SA was the first country that is a part of the global travel network in which the Omicron appeared?"

18862,Oh I was thinking about this the other day.
18863,Why are some drugs like heroine taken in the veins through the forearm but the vaccine was stabbed into my arm in a random spot.
18864,"True - but if I'm assuming I'm 3/4's of the way through a typical life span, no guarantees I will get more."
18865,"We were saying the same thing this morning, that it’s already in the US."
18866,"SA Airlines has been flying into JFK, and IAD up to, like, yesterday."
18867,Undoubtedly an infected person disembarked from one of those flights.
18868,it probably did originate in SA.

18877,This is not true.
18878,It was a whole year.
18879,"You don't need a full PCR in the EU AFAIK, or is this something that recently changed?"
18880,Over the summer an antigen test was enough.
18881,So are we just expecting them to do this forever?
18882,China strategy is the best one.
18883,"If the whole world applied it, the pandemic would already be over or close to be."
18884,Omicron changes nothing in regard to this strategy.
18885,Yes they will.
18886,It's called martial law.
18887,Lmao they skipped the letter Xi
18888,"No I’m sorry, of those hospitalized 80% are unvaccinated."
18889,But I’m in Colorado and last I looked we were third in infections.
18890,Reaching capacity in a week or so.
18891,"And if they detect it, they won't tell anybody"
18892,You think society was more resilient in the 1400s than today?
18893,Why?
18894,source: trust me bro.
18895,"So now you're saying that Chise who is literally a scientist and knows way more than you, is wrong?"
18896,I’m glad finally they started caring about viruses they’ve been here for centuries.
18897,A single case confirmed likely means many cases exist.
18898,"Well if talking and mandating doesn't work, than what will?"
18899,"I saw a case of medical personal giving vaccines instead of some misinformed treatement (can't find the source), but that is not going to work on a larger scale nor a real solution to the misinformation."
18900,It's the shellfish.
18901,"There is no shellfish in the vaccine but the people making the vaccine could have consumed shellfish and cross contaminated, creating a shellfishness in the process."
18902,So the real reason people won't get vaccinated is shellfishness.
18903,"They chose that path, despite everyone begging and pleading them to get vaccinated."
18904,Nothing hilarious about it.
18905,But I mean this in no uncertain terms: fuck ‘em they deserve what they get.
18906,"I don't think there's anything that nefarious going on, just bad or inadequate testing."
18907,Have you tried cognitive therapy?
18908,We get a massive amount of tourists and snowbirds so it wouldn't be a surprise.
18909,Even if we don't have it already we will before 2022.
18910,Only 80% unvaccinated in the hospital?
18911,What state?
18912,My kids got their second doses of the pfizer vaccine this morning.
18913,There were tons of kids waiting at Walgreens with us.
18914,My seven year old had a panic attack right when he sat in the chair for his vaccine but he pressed on and got it done.
18915,Some sweet woman cheered for him when he left the vaccination area and that helped both of us feel a bit better.
18916,I’m so proud of all the kids and parents that are out today getting that second dose.

18921,"As most long haulers can attest, it gets better but takes time."
18922,Be graceful with yourself and know that it’s not forever.

18927,There are regular flights from London (and much of The EU) to LA and SFO.
18928,In fact I had dinner last week with someone who just got off a plane from Paris.
18929,Guess I should go get tested.
18930,Knee-jerk is the only appropriate reaction at this point.
18931,I guess SA would rather the world give them two weeks to export it to every corner of the planet before confirming that it actually is a very big deal and shutting down travel then.
18932,You have to react to situations like this before you know if it’s as big a deal as you think it might be.
18933,"If it ends up being overblown, so be it."
18934,"But people will always complain when proactive action completely averts a crisis, saying something like, “You made such a big deal about it and it ended up being a complete  *nOtHiNgBuRgEr*!!"
18935,"!” Yeah, the point of being proactive is to prevent crisis, not to make it marginally less horrible."
18936,"If we had been a bit more knee-jerk at the beginning of all this, maybe we wouldn’t be in the situation were in now."
18937,"so they didn't share an airplane, an airport, a ticket clerk, a baggage handler, a fast food worker, a taxi driver, a front desk clerk, a maid, or a hallway right?"
18938,right?
18939,?
18940,Source?
18941,Omega the jab collector.
18942,10-15% of a 600 passenger flight was infected with this variant from SA to the Netherlands.
18943,"So yeah, it’s been breeding here for weeks."
18944,Inescapable at this point.
18945,Why would you be asking that when the news has just been broken about the dangerous variant out of SA?
18946,We don’t have the answers yet.
18947,"Americans who live.in Rural areas....people in New York, LA and the like get it."
18948,Any Europeans ever see Black Friday at Walmart...even dipshits Americans should get it
18949,"Oh, I thought they had said it was unrelated to any of the existing variants?"
18950,"I could see being skeptical of the mRNA tech at first, as it was new and different, but we have enough data now that continued skepticism is impractical."
18951,Just a point to consider in defense of South Africa.
18952,They have an advanced medical system which was able to identify the virus.
18953,That doesn’t mean the virus started there.
18954,Delta Dawn what that flower…….
18955,What harm did 8 weeks of online learning do to your kids?

18978,Gonna lock myself up until we have another booster available to fight it.
18979,Already considering getting a fourth dose soon.
18980,Very doubtful.
18981,The colds are colds.
18982,The rest of the viruses didn’t go away.
18983,I think you're projecting ...
18984,"I don't think anybody, in Reddit or outside, love lockdowns."
18985,Everybody would rather COVID just disappears.
18986,"Now, if you see high transmission rates of COVID in your area, are lockdowns appropriate?"
18987,Maybe.
18988,"Everybody would rather NOT see the high transmission rates ... nobody \*wants\* a lockdown, but many people see it as a less worse alternative to having dead people piled up on the streets ..."
18989,False.
18990,"Yes i know and my point is there was very little panic buying, but everybody bought a little extra which is why stores ran out"

19040,"It's a reasonable point - they have an interest in downplaying the variant, since it's their country that's being blockaded."
19041,"It doesn't imply bias, but it certainly is what we'd call a ""conflict of interest""."
19042,10% of thousands of cases is well above the required sample size that can be generalized to an entire population.
19043,"Presuming they are sampling fairly randomly, there's almost no chance that a major omicron surge has evaded them."
19044,"Well talking about 'new viruses' there is a difference between progressive mutation, recombination, 'jump'-mutation and host jumps."
19045,"Basically for the 5 jump mutations that were discussed so for (alpha-delta, omicron) there are hundreds of detected progressive mutations and a dozend recombinations - the dark number is probably 10x or 100x that."
19046,"Nontheless a jump mutation fueling an outbreak is noticeworthy, since it is unlikely and had big implications in the alpha-delta variants of winter/spring 20/21."
19047,On the other hand there were WHO designated VOI with less significance than the VOC and there were cases of jump mutations like [A.32.1](https://cov-lineages.org/lineage.html?lineage=A.23.1) with as little significance.
19048,"I’m triple vaccinated, so not too worried."
19049,Could this already have been here and this Is what the terrible 'cold' people had for weeks?
19050,Maybe it wasn't showing on the tests?
19051,"I remember years ago, I went to the doctor's feeling sick, and they handed me a surgical mask to put on while waiting because that was their protocol any time someone came in with flu-like symptoms."
19052,I really hope they extend mask wearing in hospitals because it makes NO SENSE to me why sick people would just wait in a single room together maskless lol.

19054,"Is it possible for a mutation to be dominant, highly transmissible but also very mild, symptom-wise?"
19055,"Meaning, this could take over as the version people are catching but it’s like a Covid-Lite since the mutation weakened?"
19056,"Remember the first travel ban when all these passengers were dumped into Boston's Logan International and were crowded together, sharing the virus?"
19057,"No quarantine, no masks, no isolation measures, just stay in a crowded terminal for hours and hours and then go on crowded buses so you make sure everyone gets a lungful."
19058,&gt; Travel bans are for lesser countries that voters usually don't travel to.
19059,Didn't USA ban all incoming travel from EU ?
19060,And other countries banned flights from UK ?

19148,Life is better when you don’t judge strangers you’ve never met according to your likely flawed perception of their choices.
19149,There’s a lot of space between sniffles and ventilator.
19150,"I had a breakthrough case of Delta, and it’s the most sick I’ve ever been."
19151,"Even months later, I have horrible fatigue and brain fog, I get heart palpitations all the time, my resting BPM is high, my lungs still don’t feel right, and I still have shortness of breath and coughing problems here and there."
19152,"But I didn’t go to the hospital, so I was still considered a “mild” case."
19153,The new variant i get it is more infectious but it is more deadly ?
19154,And hopefully Pfizzer vaccine works against it.. i will make the booster next weeks (done my full scheme in May) and i hope i will  not need a new booster in the next 6 months again.
19155,"I'm tired of this bullshit, we have a lot of vaccines and non of them are good"
19156,I suppose the silver lining here is that working people are getting paid well for their labor and that the majority of that money will (hopefully) recirculate within the country.

19169,"Some of the US territories don’t do much sequencing, but for at least one territory (American Samoa if I remember correctly) that’s because they’ve only gotten their first COVID case fairly recently."

19181,I think the pfizer studies involved people taking the pill within 3 days of symptoms while the merck studies involved people taking the pill within 5 days of symptoms.

19208,"It would take a complete reversal of our political culture for the government to take this approach, and there's nobody to do it."
19209,Do we know if the standard NHS lateral flow tests work just as well to detect Omicron?
19210,I assume PCR does I'd they're finding it and sequencing but they're saying it has many more variations than other strains.
19211,Stay out of Oregon.

19213,The state of emergency is to allow access to resources that may be needed.
19214,"Y’all will believe anything anyone tells you, huh"
19215,There are over 100 different cancers and plenty of different ‘heart diseases’.

19218,Yup.
19219,And not one mfer actually does wear a mask.
19220,I got the impression she was speaking about the room they were put in after exiting the plane to wait for testing .
19221,"&gt;Which could be benign but countries are just being cautious until they know more

i'm from the US (insert normal comments about not knowing world politics) so i'm not familiar with the structure of the countries involved, but do you know if there are countries having travel bans where some states/counties/municipalities are attempting to defy the national leadership like desantis/abbott wanted to do last year in the US?"
19222,2 channels light up?
19223,Can you explain what this means?
19224,I know PCR and RT-qPCR.
19225,"I assumed they just performed RT-qPCR to test, but that’s just an increase in fluorescent signal."
19226,We really need a better way of describing “mild” disease.
19227,"Because right now, “mild” could mean anything from a slight head cold to the worst flu you’ve ever had + long term lingering brain, heart, and lung issues."
19228,"As long as you didn’t go to the hospital, it’s considered mild."
19229,The “mild” spectrum is far too large.
19230,"Yeah, it has competition in England, against the Delta."
19231,"In SA it's ""easy"" to be dominant."
19232,"I love the guys who try to hang out on WSB and be cool, but it comes off so desperate and obvious you have zero real money in the market."
19233,I think in the worst case scenario there could be lockdowns.
19234,If Omicron is as deadly as MERS and kills 30 percent of the people who catch it and evades vaccines... Maybe.
19235,"If course that's extremely unlikely, and the fact that a 1 in 3 chance of death elicits a maybe says a lot."
19236,"Lucky, I guess I might as well go to the future since the past isn't the useful or fun for me"
19237,Lockdown for the vaccinated?
19238,I don't think so.
19239,It won't until we start holding these morons who refuse to get vaccinated responsible for their actions.
19240,[removed]
19241,"I just wonder—even if you are fully vaccinated with a booster, who is thinking the AIRPORT is a place to stay maskless?"
19242,"I was 2.5 hours early to the airport, and couldn’t find a single spot where a maskless person wasn’t in eyesight."
19243,People were maskless for HOURS.
19244,HOURS!!
19245,"I appreciated the notice so I could see it, but to see people of various ages, races, and genders maskless…I think I really will commit to getting a booster when I can get time off"
19246,Got it!
19247,As another irish citizen yes that's overboard when you don't even know if it is in Ireland currently!
19248,But then we are doing terribly in general so follow public health advice just don't do things that you feel are unsafe!
19249,Wear a mask avoid large crowds the new normal unfortunately.
19250,UK travel ban?
19251,Haha I kid.
19252,Travel bans are for lesser countries that voters usually don't travel to.
19253,I think almost all of the tests are essentially self tests at least in the U.S. where I live - I’ve never seen one where they don’t hand you the swab to swab yourself.
19254,"When you go to any of the large county testing sites you walk or drive up, they hand you a swab and a tube, you swab yourself and break it off in the tube, then drop it in a large bin."
19255,"These are accepted for many purposes (return to school/work, play sports, etc) though not sure if there are special ones for travel since I haven’t done any."
19256,"Not days, weeks"
19257,Same here.
19258,Now I feel like a derelict boomer trapped in an Orwellian perma-lockdown  :(.
19259,That still wouldn't explain 10% of a random group to be suddenly positive.
19260,No more lockdowns!
19261,!
19262,"To add some humor -

As soon as I saw it was named ""Omicron"", I immediately thought of ""Omicron Persei 8"""
19263,"they mean all of the countries banned from entering the US (like the UK, entirety of europe, china, brazil, etc) were unbanned"
19264,"As a Dutch person, I'd say you're right, but also missing the point by focussing on intellect and infrastructure."
19265,Empathy and genuine long term thinking are not receiving the attention a country that is so well off should be capable of giving them.
19266,"I'd be less interested in comparing our country to other countries and then cheer because ""we're better"" (in some ways), I'd be interested in identifying the shortcomings of the Netherlands."
19267,"In my opinion, arrogance and exceptionalism ('we are very good', 'these rules are not for me') are prevalent cultural problems amongst many Dutch and a big mistake."
19268,I read the same in your comment.
19269,I think it would be correct to be a lot more modest.
19270,I agree.
19271,"MY version of mild here is sniffles, head cold, etc."
19272,"That was the problem initially when they reported from China that 85% of cases were mild and only 5% were ""severe."""
19273,"We, in the healthcare community though the 5% was the bad, admitted to the hospital overall group."
19274,The 5% turned out to be those needing ICU and near death.
19275,"That 85% of ""mild"" includes people sick at home unable to move for 4-6 weeks."
19276,He’s basing this on what exactly?

19281,"As far as I'm aware, no airline actually operates it with 800+ seats, that's just a theoretical maximum with an all-economy configuration."
19282,oh yeah i forgot we are already near december
19283,"It's not their fault, they haven't left their house in 2 years without a hazmat suit."
19284,There's tremendous incentive from a geopolitical perspective to downplay the severity of the current variant.
19285,With due respect I don’t want big companies making people think that the vaccinations are effective towards these strains without support or claims.
19286,It’s pretty much a way for them to make people panic vaccinate like with the boosters.
19287,I’m not anti vaccine and I’ve got my booster but I’m not so sure these companies are doing their research.

19289,In my small town Northern Ireland id say 90% of people wear masks when shopping which is great
19290,The CDC in the richest and most powerful nation on earth should have known by now rather than guessing.
19291,"Currently, the transfer is happening in the other direction."
19292,"Take the vaccine, wear a mask, social distance and you should be good out and about."
19293,"I can step outside my house now in my neighborhood, town, etc and just see thousands of people that have moved on."
19294,Current best evidence of this right now is holiday shopping.
19295,Masks are 50/50 and I probably have a good estimate that most are vaccinated.
19296,"Booster wise, maybe not so much as I believe boosters everywhere were just green lit."
19297,The days of staying in and worrying seem to be over for most.
19298,Any time I go out most have adjusted to the new normal of a simple vaccine and optional mask.
19299,"If one is required, it’s always on, but if it isn’t, you can definitely see people rip it right off."
19300,I guess now it’s a game of maintaining vaccine usage kind of like we have been doing with the flu for decades.
19301,I think there have been talks of a double shot or something that has the Covid and flu vaccine and I’ll definitely be the first to take it to kill two birds with one stone with a mask being the cherry on top.
19302,"I swear as soon as I got my second dose in May or so, worrying soon vanished."
19303,A huge crowd of others in a line in front and behind me definitely reassured me when maybe a week or so ago it probably would have stressed me out.
19304,"Everyone had a mask on, gladly took their shots, and went about their day."
19305,"I feel now whenever I start worrying again, I just picture that line of people simply going to some place that provides future vaccines/boosters, getting the shot, and going about their day."
19306,Essentially the silent majority you could say.
19307,It was taken for granted with the flu and is slowly starting to be the same with Covid.

19372,"aside from judging by responses (travel bans, china's longer quarantine for cargo workers, etc) do you know of any publicly released estimates regarding ""how bad"" omicron could be this winter?"
19373,"for most of this year (some) people have talked about how bad winter would be typically referring to some seasonality and some holiday impacts, should the estimates change at all as a result of omicron being the known variant at the time when they suspected some variant would pop up?"
19374,not sure if that made sense.
19375,"without taking the time to find links, the kind of estimates i've seen for this winter fall somewhere between the first winter (partially when covid was transmitting and no one knew it and partially first wave across the world) and the second winter (when the trough was higher to start and many hospitals in the US went to surge plans) with high vaccinated areas on the low end and low vaccinated areas on the high end."
19376,"i have a hard time believing that any future waves could be worse than past waves given vaccines and boosters, unless there was 100% immunity evasion which i wouldn't expect, right?"
19377,so at this point is it fair to say the media is just renaming something they had been proclaiming all year in hopes of getting a revival of clicks?

19411,"The common cold today is a variant of the 1918 flu, but it just took the 1918 flu trillions upon trillions of mutations to get to that common cold baseline where it didn't kill us all."
19412,"If it turns out to be more mild than delta it could save lives, otherwise the US is going to have a very unmerry Christmas."
19413,Why do you think there is a disparity in infrastructure quality?
19414,[removed]
19415,It was too late probably weeks ago.
19416,Its clear this thing has been around for awhile.
19417,What's also clear is highly vaccinated countries still aren't seeing the same hospitalization rates during our unvaccinated fight against covid.
19418,"Vaccines work, they are probably still working against this variant, but the mainstream media needs and wants this attention."
19419,It was a nice balance between socialism and capitalism that created the vaccines and made them available.
19420,"Lots of grants/government funding, cheaper government rates to purchase the vaccines from the companies ($15-18 per shot), giving vaccine to people for free— and using logistics, distribution, production/manufacturing, etc by the capitalist companies to actually make and get the vaccine."
19421,It was a combined overall effort between socialism and capitalism (where everyone wins as long as people take the vaccine).
19422,I personally really liked to see it.

19424,That was a Simpsons joke my Dude
19425,I hope she recovers well.
19426,"My mother got it back in January (it killed my grandmother at the same time, and she still refuses the vaccination, grr), and she still can't smell or taste anything."
19427,Variant detection is retrospective and always takes time from its discovery to public awareness.
19428,"My theory is that many people weren't ill enough with to land in a hospital, so it went largely undetected."
19429,"Now that we know what to look for, we're learning that there's a growing number of cases across Europe."
19430,"I'm guessing we'll see there have been cases in the US as well, some possibly dating back several weeks."
19431,Has anyone with a known case died from this yet?
19432,I read that so far the cases have been mild.
19433,That's reassuring to me.
19434,"It might be wishful thinking on my part, but I don't think it fits the sky-is-falling-scenario just yet."
19435,Thank you for the well wishes 😊
19436,I'm not going to downvote.
19437,I get it.
19438,"I think it's dumb to play the lottery, that doesnt mean I think people shouldn't."
19439,"It's dumb to drink beer, I had a few last night."
19440,"Things can be dumb, but we all have to make those decisions."
19441,I'm no expert but I have heard people say this is a possibility.
19442,I seriously don’t understand why people latch onto this non stop fear porn stream of a sub.
19443,"Old enough for 10% of a group of random passengers to be infected, new enough that they didn't develop major symptoms yet?"
19444,"Possible, but sounds like a small window."
19445,So exciting!
19446,Bring it on COVID-19!
19447,"Of course not, it's being human."
19448,"Trust me, the mental exhaustion is because of worrying a lot and because of many things happening at once."
19449,"I see a lot of guilt in your post, and I think if you aim to feel OK then everyone else around you may follow."
19450,Your post really resonated with me because I've been through the exact same thing (death of a parent was much earlier than that and didn't affect me at that time but many of the other things that you mention ring a bell).
19451,I took 4 years to finish my masters because I was feeling a large void and inability to focus.
19452,I spend around 3 years literally looking at videos on youtube.
19453,"I really, really struggled with procrastinating and finishing."
19454,"Also, I applied to many jobs and no one wanted to hire me because I had no experience."
19455,I became really awkward because of the lack of contact and creeped out everyone.
19456,The only way for me to change that was to look for work in other countries when I was 29.
19457,"As long as I started to feel things moving, the situation got gradually better."
19458,"It took some time to ''remember'' how to interact properly with other people, and I can still be awkward."
19459,But there is a way to improve.
19460,"Try to keep the things you worry about simple (just keep the one thing of getting a job for now, because it really can help with everything else) and try not to worry for everyone else."
19461,At least not for now.
19462,It's no wonder that you feel that way with all this overload over your head (which ofc comes from a good place).
19463,"All these difficulties that you are experiencing are your strength, and once you figure out your way to overcome them (or live with them) you will be able to help other people in your life too."
19464,These people would all be entering the US from the east coast.
19465,NYC and Atlanta have to be at the top of the list with California being incredibly unlikely.
19466,Are we supposed fo feel sympathy for these people?
19467,That would be perfect.
19468,"If it outpaces the Delta with only mild symptoms, and the vaccine is effective against it as well, it would be great."
19469,They tried to and found that the difference in protection between the updated and the original wasn’t significant enough to justify ramping up production.
19470,Over/under if omicron severely neutralize the effectiveness on the current rotation of vaccines will the Biden administration impose a national lockdown for the US?
19471,Why does it matter?
19472,"Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic, and UK now too if you want to count them."
19473,Wouldn't be surprised if there were more just since I opened this thread.
19474,"Yeah, because people haven't stopped traveling this entire pandemic."
19475,I know someone who is currently traveling with their unvaccinated child to South Africa for US Thanksgiving break 🤦‍♀️
19476,Believe it's closer to 25%.
19477,[removed]
19478,"Hi friend, I've never been to Africa at all, but grew up in impoverished countries."
19479,"Sadly certificate faking is totally a thing, esp."
19480,in poorer countries.
19481,"Everybody already either ""knows a guy"", or has an acquaintance that can help find said guy."
19482,My point is: there already is in place an established and mature infrastructure (however informal) for forgery.
19483,One must assume that  covid certificates are not impervious to this.
19484,[removed]
19485,"Some examples: During 2nd wave, lots of developing world travel agencies were handing out fake negative tests if you bought the travel package."
19486,Its stil happening.
19487,Bribes: ie: A really high % of vaccinated people but many just bribed the nurses to fill in the form without getting the shots.
19488,Most measures are too late and mostly a PR move so you watch the news and grunt approvingly at the government.
19489,8% positivity rate isn't that bad.
19490,"Actually, I’ve been wondering how this happened in that time frame."
19491,Using a rapid test that doesn’t match up makes a ton of sense.
19492,Bunch of assholes
19493,I read somewhere (looking for references now) that this is the way the Spanish flu ended.
19494,Mutations became progressively more contagious and less deadly.
19495,This could actually be a positive step in the right direction.
19496,No.
19497,I’m just expressing my hope that national standards of living are independent of culture or heritage.
19498,That’s foundational to the past 75 years of Western philosophy
19499,2 cases in a population of 50 million is breaking news now.
19500,I've never been more convinced this never ends.
19501,Wouldn't you still live in their general location if you cared that much?
19502,Lock does just shift the burden from the wealthy who can work from home to the poor and working poor who can not.
19503,Also at this point school closures have done serous damage to our kids and really should be a last resort
19504,Virgin coronavirus vs ChAd vaccine
19505,I think really informed people like you are not the target for this article.
19506,I don't stay up on COVID news anymore.
19507,I got my vax and booster and now I just go about my life with a mask and more hand washing.
19508,But now I hear about travel restrictions because of a new variant and a state of emergency in NY so I want to look for a quick summary of what's going on.
19509,This gives me a quick rundown all in one spot.
19510,"Unless the whole planet gets vaccinated now and stops giving the virus hosts to mutate in, this will keep going and going and going."
19511,This will be with us for decades.
19512,A very significant minority on the planet will never be vaccinated.
19513,Source?
19514,I'm curios what the antivaxxer lunatics will say about this
19515,You would be able to tell by the people in SA hospitals pretty quickly.
19516,"And there was already a report released that most people in their hospitals are unvaxxed cases right now

 https://www.timesofisrael.com/s-african-expert-downplays-threat-from-omicron-we-wont-have-a-severe-epidemic/"
19517,Huh?
19518,The person you're replying to didn't make _any_ claims- they asked a question.
19519,"And the answer is yes, it's possible for it to mutate to be more transmissable with less symptoms, but it's of course not guaranteed, it could also become more deadly."
19520,Thank you for the much-needed childish giggle lol.
19521,Snot.
19522,Yeah pro diseasers can be convinced with logic.
19523,"Guys does it make any difference that I took about 4 months, between my two doses?"
19524,"They surmised that the patient had been infected with Covid for an unnaturally long period of time and assumed it was an HIV patient, since immunocompromised + Botswana = HIV 

I don’t know why exactly Covid would best mutate in a patient and the article didn’t elaborate on that point, though I’m guessing we will see more on it soon."
19525,"Sorry, wish I could be more helpful with that"
19526,They can't know it for sure yet.
19527,"as soon as the hospitals collapse, and there is no room for patients, we have a problem"
19528,Me too!
19529,"Our kids got their seconds today, also!"
19530,And there was a steady stream of kids coming in for their vaccinations.
19531,Our county is at 30% first vax for 5-11!
19532,I got my booster a couple days before this broke.
19533,It’s good in that my protection from covid in general is about as high as it could be.
19534,"Downside is that if this is substantially vaccine resistant and a booster is release fast (doubtful but who knows), I will probably have to wait for a bit before I can get it."
19535,Good thing he claimed it evades immunity from vaccines etc prior to us even completing our study.
19536,Fear mongering helps nobody as of now.
19537,"Yes, but hospitalisation stats take longer to start going up."
19538,There's been inconsistencies in dail reporting recently.
19539,"You tried, my dude."
19540,I agree with you.
19541,"I was taking sh-t on another thread earlier for suggesting the same thing (that is, the horse is already out of the barn if it's being found in a bunch of countries)."
19542,Good.
19543,I’m mulling in my mind that if it spreads more that it can mutate more quickly.
19544,May be good now but it may be worse later?
19545,Isn’t that how it goes?
19546,"Totally agree, this is the first time in the pandemic I’ve felt suspicious about a lot of the experts rolling out panicky threads."
19547,Some do seem algorithm chasing.
19548,"Well, no restrictions doesn't work either."
19549,"No matter what the government does, it will always be wrong according to some..."
19550,I really hope so

19555,It is impossible to contain this virus.
19556,It was impossible from the start and its impossible with any of these variants.
19557,It is way too transmissible and insufficiently lethal to contain.
19558,"Nothing fundamentally changes, just get vaccinated."
19559,"Delta established everyone is catching this virus and there's no ""herd immunity"" and it'll kill around 2% of the people who don't get vaccinated."
19560,"Nothing about that is likely to change much, other than small tweaks one way or another to that percentage value."
19561,And there will be new variants every 6-12 months for the next 50 years.
19562,When do we decide they're not worth headlines any more?
19563,They also provided zero data.
19564,"The unvaccinated aren't going to die off that much, though recoveries from COVID count the same as vaccinations anyways."
19565,I wonder if first dose only really is relevant.
19566,It was already way lower in protection before we knew about the vaccine waning.
19567,It wouldn’t be surprising if the numbers now were almost insignificant.
19568,"The only real hope we have is 90% recently fully vaccinated or boosted, but the CDC fucked up booster rollout tremendously."
19569,The flu is an entirely different virus that has different characteristics that allows it to easily recombine with other strains.
19570,We also have lots of previous immunity to the flu as a population that still inhibits it’s severity and spread.
19571,Next up: The Rumplestiltskin Variant
19572,Did they?
19573,Why?
19574,"It's been in SA for a couple days already, we'll know in 2 weeks I believe."
19575,&gt; So it's unlikely the border shutdowns really do much here I think.
19576,"Especially considering that literally hundreds of thousands of people illegally come across the southern border... 2 Million people were *apprehended* doing so, and presumably some smaller (but quite large in an absolute sense) number of people made it through."
19577,yeah.
19578,understood.
19579,I didn't mean low testing on the plane... .I meant in the general SA public.. to have a 10% prevalence (or anywhere close to that) of infected people who boarded the plane.
19580,It's such a relief to have this man as President.
19581,It's like having Ike in the White House again.
19582,Just tested positive.
19583,28 M who was at a wedding last weekend.
19584,Have my vaccine (but no booster).
19585,Felt a scratchy throat Wednesday and got a rapid and PCR test that day to make sure it wasn't COVID before I saw family.
19586,"Rapid came back negative, and the sore throat was minor so I figured it was just the weather changing."
19587,"I told everyone who I was seeing all the information I had, and they all had the same sentiment as me, ""sure it's just a cold, you're vaccinated, just no hugging and it'll be fine."""
19588,"Each day I've felt worse and worse since then, and it took about 72 hours to get my PCR results back."
19589,I've exposed my entire family and feel awful about it.
19590,Just called everyone and told them to go get tested.
19591,Praying I wasn't the cause of a super spreader event.
19592,"If our testing was better and the rapid was more accurate or the PCR came back sooner, I could have not exposed so many people."
19593,[removed]
19594,So can I make a reasonable response to your point?
19595,Coming from someone who does despise the masks.
19596,I honestly think one of the key problems in messaging regarding masks is that very few people in positions are power are laying out clear metrics for when they will go away for good.
19597,"And I'm not an anti-mask person, am fully vaccinated etc."
19598,But some clarification would be nice even with the uncertainty around Covid.
19599,"Even if it's something like, ""when we hit x number of deaths per day and stay below that for two weeks masks can come off"" or, ""x percent vaccinated"" or the like."
19600,Some kind of an immutable metric that signifies that this is the level of Covid we will live with.
19601,"And some regions are doing this, but many are not (I'm in the USA so the response is largely devolved regionally and/or onto states)."
19602,"Because it's incredibly frustrating, you see, to at least some people to keep them on edge all the time about the threat of always bringing back various restrictions/inconveniences, and I think that is a valid perspective too that is often dismissed."
19603,"The short answer is no, hybrid viruses like you are describing are not an actual concern outside of thought experiments, and very specific scientific experiments."
19604,"HIV and COVID are completely different viruses, and even use different ways of replicating their genomes."
19605,"It's not like a tiger and a lion mating to get a hybrid liger (which can happen), but more like trying to get a squid-eagle hybrid."
19606,"Having said that, as u/doedalus and u/jdorje pointed out, recombination does happen commonly in some virus types, and has causes problems for us in the past."
19607,"Influenza is a good example as well where closely related viruses can reshuffle their genomes and gain the ability to infect a different species (birds, humans, pigs)."
19608,Africa and (to a lower degree) South America and south Asia have a lot of mammal species similar to humans that can have disease jumps (zoonosis).
19609,And zoonosis is more likely to create a deadly disease than within-human evolution.
19610,But it's just chance.
19611,It's odd because there seems to be a lot of misinformation in the media and saying its vaccine evading is baseless anti vax.
19612,The media are basically being anti vax right now
19613,[removed]
19614,So ridiculous.

19639,"I was debating because it was the day before Thanksgiving, I was working, and vaccinations always make me feel like shit."
19640,But I did it anyway and just slogged through.
19641,Now this comes out and I'm glad I went ahead and took the opportunity.
19642,Alot of news stories are saying the variant evades immunity and is 500 times more transmissible.
19643,This is not based on anything concrete and an EU health official parroted it.
19644,"Well for me,  nothing."

19674,"The economy takes a big hit when you pull the floor out from under the service industry,  too."

19680,"&gt;""Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation,"" the WHO statement explained."
19681,This thing is probably too dangerous for a live-virus vaccine to be worth the risk.
19682,But the Chinese inactivated vaccines seem to be fine; it just takes longer to build immunity IIRC.
19683,Maybe it comes out from his ass
19684,&gt; Why?
19685,"Antibiotics 

Antibiotics cure bacteria."
19686,"Not virus...

&gt; Switzerland is the global headquarters for many huge pharma companies and they weren’t interested in making vaccines (when covid first hit) bc they traditionally aren’t very profitable."
19687,again.
19688,37 billion in profit.
19689,only in a quarter.
19690,&gt; NOW WITH COVID THE VACCINE MARKET LANDSCAPE HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED since everyone needs one and governments are financing it.
19691,Again more than 80% of financing came from private investors.
19692,"Pharma companies had all the tech, research and people."
19693,That they invested for decades.
19694,Funny?
19695,Oh I I'll say it to you : capitalism and socialism are indeed some sort of arch-enemies.

19698,Over and over again.
19699,They roll this out every few months.
19700,It's the toilet paper of research.
19701,What we actually want is a variant that is extremely transmissible and much less lethal.
19702,We can't try to tailor one because we don't know how and nobody would want to be responsible for the deaths it did cause.
19703,But we want the 'common flu' variant.
19704,I can only defer to the video and Mr. Pentinnen
19705,You missed the wanting to be told good things part of childhood thought.
19706,Glad you’re vaccinated though.

19711,"Gonna go out on a limb and say if people haven't gotten it yet, this isn't going to change anything."
19712,"They should mandate it, apparently its constitutional."
19713,Unfortunately the US is also very lax and is afraid of hurting the feelings of the 25% that hates being told what to do by people who aren't trying to scam them.
19714,"I dont think it would go on forever, at least not like this."
19715,"Eventually it'll be like dealing with measles: its still a problem, but most people don't realize it until too many unvaccinated people are in one place at the same time."
19716,But incubation time of covid is several days not several hours.
19717,They would have all been infected way before the flight.

19719,"This is probably a dumb question, but how are you supposed to prove that you have had a negative LFT?"

19721,No.
19722,Those people tested positive for COVID19.
19723,But sequencing takes a while so they don't know what strain.
19724,The media however is deliberately making it sound like they had omicron though.
19725,The fever is climate change.
19726,Covid is just the headache.
19727,Because I want to see my old parents again before they die?
19728,Not everyone lives in the same country they grew up in.
19729,"True, but we must not get to the point where we read more and more articles just because of fear if there is no new info."
19730,"I'm not talking about this article specifically, just a general thought."
19731,https://i.imgur.com/VVBFyhz.gif
19732,We don't know that for sure yet.
19733,COVID was at very low levels in SA when this new variant appeared.
19734,One or two super spreader events could have caused the spike in cases of Omnicron that were seen there.
19735,We just have to wait and see what happens when it's identified in a community with high levels of circulating Delta _and_ high levels of vaccination.
19736,I’m triple vaccinated.
19737,"I’m also a geneticist, so obviously I’m worried."
19738,No matter how many boosters I get the vaccine isn’t going to protect me if it can’t see the virus.
19739,I don’t know that omicron is the big one.
19740,We don’t have that info yet.
19741,"But I do know it’s not going to stop mutating so if not this one, maybe the next or the next after that."
19742,The vaccines were the first miracle.
19743,The pace of the research is the second - we are learning so much so fast.
19744,We are becoming so much better at keeping this thing from killing us.
19745,Hopefully we will also learn to avert disability.
19746,But we aren’t done yet and have to stay out in front of this thing.
19747,NY is 68%.
19748,Other states have downwards to 45%.
19749,NY is just one small piece of the puzzle.
19750,"So 700 000+ deaths won't, but this new threat will."
19751,Sure it will.
19752,"It’s not so much the climate, but how the climate causes people to behave."
19753,Cold weather = closer together and more time spent inside

19759,"Knowing what I know about India, some Africans are going to be lynched."
19760,Some of us have conditions that make those protections not even a guarantee.
19761,I’m still awaiting updates from the antibody and t-cell studies I’m in.
19762,And I’m hardly alone in these groups.
19763,I'm hoping this kind of research convinces FDA/CDC to endorse boosters every six months.
19764,Let's do it.
19765,She could probably use that $10k and get a fresh start leaving his ass.
19766,"Wait, really?"
19767,"I'm no murican, but it don't sound like murican's have been a ""we"" for a long time."
19768,Why would that spur the anti vaxxers?
19769,This is exactly what they were expecting.
19770,"""Watch us get the shot and then a new variant comes out and we need more shots""."
19771,Not saying that they are right.
19772,Can't enable that behavior.
19773,"If we keep treating these people like children, they will continue expecting everything served on a silver platter."
19774,If/when we encounter another pandemic- it would be even more disastrous.
19775,A 1 in 3 CFR for this variant?
19776,I have no idea where that idea even comes from.
19777,I’m not aware of *any* evidence whatsoever at this time that even comes close to suggesting a morality rate like that.
19778,"But who needs evidence or substantiation, let’s just keep dreaming up worst case scenario fantasies for no reason other than to promulgate fear."
19779,"I’m convinced that many, many people on social media just like to engage in borderline masturbatory fear fantasies; just sitting around dreaming up catastrophic scenarios in their head."
19780,"Isolating right now is fine, and I'm doing it."
19781,"I'm asking about the longer-term approach, say Winter 2026 when vaccines continue to be widely available and effective and ~100% of the population has immunity through either vaccination or exposure."
19782,"We don't (or at least, haven't historically) go into 10-day isolations for influenza or any other common disease, which COVID is very likely to become."
19783,"10, 20, or even 30 days of sudden isolations each year seems like a giant burden to impose on everyone without thinking about it carefully, especially considering how many people have obligations (family members, work, etc) that make sudden 10-day isolations impractical for people who may not even be symptomatic."
19784,I already spent a good portion of my 20s isolated when I had cancer.
19785,It’s just a lot to do it again.
19786,But the secret from chemo is you can’t just quit when you’re tired.
19787,You cope (or don’t) and just keep going and keep surviving.
19788,You find ways to keep busy and enjoy little moments.
19789,I’m both beyond prepared for this and devastated so much of my life has been this way.
19790,"And once people decide the risk is fine so long as it only kills the elderly and immunocompromised, that begins an even more dark lockdown for me where people have decided it’s okay if I die so they can have fun."
19791,It really might always be part of my life and I’m only in my 30s.
19792,You want to look at hospitalizations and critical care/ICU in combination with lethality.
19793,Delta is lethal/transmissible enough to overwhelm hospitals in some areas which means that you should probably be concerned about it.
19794,"Still waiting to hear back on whether Omicron is good news or bad news in that regard (it's a variant of concern due to transmissibility from the gist of what I've read), and would like some more info if anyone knows of any."
19795,Gosh what a shitty paper.
19796,“Fear is not real.
19797,The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future.
19798,"It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist."
19799,That is near insanity.
19800,Do not misunderstand me danger is very real but fear is a choice.”
19801,It’s hard to correlate the numbers correctly between the alpha and delta variants because we have had vaccines and significantly better ways of knowing how to treat the virus than with the initial onset of the novel virus.
19802,Via casinos?
19803,[removed]
19804,Thank you!
19805,"I am also not sure where I first read that, but I now stand corrected."
19806,Then tell the SA department of health chairperson that early data is that all cases have been mild.
19807,We have zero evidence it is worse.

19809,"&gt;more inclined to just go along with govt directive

Dude, they would have all worn masks without govt directives."
19810,"In Vietnam, they criticised the government that the measures were not strict enough, during a full lockdown"
19811,If anything it'd do the opposite - 'why would I get vaccinated if this variant escapes the vaccine?'
19812,get a doctor my friend
19813,"&gt;	Even compared to a group of 73 people who had weathered a bout with COVID-19and went on to get two doses of an mRNA vaccine, the boosted group’s median antibody level was 68% higher."
19814,"&gt;	Study leader Alexis Demonbreun, a cell biologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said the data demonstrate that  **no matter how well protected a vaccinated person may think she is, getting a booster shot is likely to increase her neutralizing antibodies — and with it, her immunity — considerably."
19815,"**  And because scientists expect large antibody responses to create more durable immunity, the protection afforded by the booster should last longer than the initial two-shot regimen did."
19816,Doesn’t get any more clear-cut than that.
19817,"No excuse not to get all three shots, even for people who had covid and two shots already."
19818,It’s only been 18 months.

19823,"While I do agree that your statement is factually accurate, probability leans on the side of that being the case."

19825,For how long?
19826,2 years?
19827,4?
19828,10?
19829,&gt; Management is trying to bully and bluff their way thru this but don't fall for it.
19830,"I remember years earlier when industry in the US was complaining loudly about ""the nurse shortage"" when all they wanted to do was import nurses from other countries who would work for less."
19831,"This is pretty much the same with ""the trucker shortage"" (and every other worker ""shortage"" we're hearing about right now) where industry wants to pay incredibly shit salaries and then complains there's a shortage because it's more advantageous for citizens to not take those jobs than to take them."
19832,&gt; when I could be going out and having fun.
19833,You can still go out and have fun.
19834,This ends when you just accept the fact that you're probably going to get covid.
19835,"You're 22, and if you're in relatively good health, you'll be fine."
19836,I've worked this entire pandemic and I do so in an industry not known for its air quality.
19837,I smoke.
19838,I go to bars.
19839,I go out with friends.
19840,I spend time with family.
19841,"I'm just more cognizant of if / when I'm feeling a little ""meh"" and am more proactive about doing things like taking supplements, eating right, monitoring symptoms (if any), etc."
19842,Just live your life.
19843,You're too young to let this become a major source of depression.
19844,They're saving it for the final boss.
19845,because it will be the variant that spreads super fast but is mild as hell and ends this pandemic once and for all.
19846,We will all be celebrating Omicron day and their will be cool merch and stuff…
19847,It *should* but it wont
19848,Yup.
19849,It’ll be here in nyc if it isn’t already.
19850,[removed]
19851,You’re ruining their buzzword “mEdiA iS FeArMoNgErInG” narrative with your facts.
19852,Stop it.
19853,For how long?
19854,A decade?
19855,COVID is probably never going way
19856,"The WHO and other agencies need at least 1 week or 2 to get accurate results about this variant, but in the mean time we can see the infections skyrocket."
19857,"So, in the worst case, getting vaccinated will protect you against existing variants other than omicron."
19858,Exactly what I said above.
19859,I'm sure they will be.
19860,The 24 hour fear news cycle is really capitalizing on these variants
19861,"It's more the messaging that comes with the bans, straight up locked us out of the rest of the world AGAIN, when that hasn't happened to anyone else including China where this thing originated and we have never seen accurate numbers out of."
19862,"In SA our numbers have been low for months but we were extremely limited on our travel due to the last variant we deteted, even for fully vaccinated people, now with no notice we are shut out again."
19863,Also when our numbers do go up our lockdowns are extreme I'm not aware of any other countries that go as far as banning alcohol sales to ensure people aren't drinking and socializing spreading the virus.
19864,Or a Futurama fan.
19865,0 microns?
19866,No mask will stop it.
19867,While you may have a point that some businesses will be fine - I feel Delta Airlines is a false equivalency because that has been a worldwide and established brand for decades.
19868,They also don’t have the same level of competition as there are a relatively small number of airlines compared to other industries.
19869,My curiosity was mostly how this might impact smaller businesses or lesser known brands if their names became associated with a death machine.
19870,That's actually my point.
19871,People are hoping it will behave like the Spanish flu.
19872,I'm saying let's not hope.
19873,Let's take precautions and watch carefully.
19874,It's well established Florida's numbers are a work of fiction
19875,Did they stop counting?
19876,There’s Christmas and News Years…
19877,"Until the US government man's the fuck up and requires everyone to be vaccinated, this will go on forever"
19878,The media fails again.
19879,Politicians as well.
19880,"What is described in the article as ""lockdowns"" are not lockdowns."
19881,Finger wagging at best.
19882,What’s suspicious is after all the data available you still aren’t vaccinated
19883,I'm vaccinated and currently at a vaccine clinic with my kids but keep assuming things.
19884,There have been thousands of variants.
19885,Kakashi cosplay everyday
19886,That’s not how the testing works.
19887,I think I saw an interview where the preliminary results showed a more mutated virus and can possibly evade vaccines.
19888,They said it would be 2-3 weeks to have more scientific data.
19889,Not to mention having no sure idea if this variant is more or less deadly to those infected.
19890,It’s still “new”.
19891,"Of course, but if you had a mild case of strep throat (to use your example), it wouldn't be unreasonable to wear a mask and get groceries, pick up lunch at a drive-thru, walk through a park, etc."
19892,You likely wouldn't continue to quarantine after you're no longer symptomatic either.
19893,"No, leaders just talk"
19894,This should be higher.
19895,Let's not panic.
19896,"Given their use of present-tense, I'm guessing the current booster dose."
19897,"Speculation, not much is known yet."
19898,[removed]
19899,Then they can be concerned when they don't have their 4th.
19900,Or the one that will inevitably be needed for a variant.
19901,Guess they will always be concerned.
19902,Nope.
19903,"I never considered it, either."
19904,I just assumed we were hoping to keep them from dying.
19905,"""The patient from Campania positive for Covid 19 and on which a sequence attributable to the Omicron variant was identified, returned to Italy a few days ago from Mozambique with a plane that landed in Milan."
19906,"On landing, the man was subjected to a swab that was later positive."
19907,"The alarm in recent days about travelers returning from southern Africa has turned the spotlight on his case, starting more in-depth feedback on him and his family members, residing in Campania."""
19908,You’re fucking insane pal.
19909,90% of adults in New York have received at least one dose.
19910,It's not an impossible accomplishment.
19911,It’s because it has a combination of mutations that past variants have shown that reduced immunity effectiveness and also made the virus more contagious.
19912,No variant since Delta has been as concerning as this one.
19913,"Whether it actually is worse than Delta, we won’t know for a while."
19914,But it is objectively something that scientists are concerned with and monitoring.
19915,"It would have taken you 5 seconds of googling to know this, but that wouldn’t fit your narrative, would it?"
19916,Or I could wear a N95.
19917,Like I always do when I rarely leave my home.
19918,Make your home cozy and stay home as much as possible.
19919,It's not worth going out unless it's necessary.
19920,"Isn't this a measure of R_t and not R_0, though, so you're not comparing apples to oranges?"
19921,"Like, I don't think there are that many places where Delta has had an R_t of 2 in recent months..."
19922,These fear mongering headlines all hitting at once and pushing everyone to get more vaccines.
19923,Nothing suspicious in that
19924,I think over time we will see this new wave hitting Europe is mostly this new variant.
19925,Look at how their numbers have exploded the past month.
19926,Insert braceyourself.jpg meme here.
19927,"I would be extremely surprised if this hasn't gotten a toehold just about everywhere by now - and the only reason we don't know is because we're not testing specifically for it, and the incubation period."
19928,"[Britain, Germany and Italy all report first cases](https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/27/germany-reported-first-suspected-case-of-omicron-covid-19-variant)."
19929,I believe the first case in South Africa was discovered over two weeks ago on Nov. 11th.
19930,How long was it spreading around locally there before that first detection?
19931,How many more people was it passed along between the 11th and today?
19932,We can *slow* the spread at this point through proper mitigation efforts.
19933,"But I think we would only be fooling ourselves to think it's not going to be all over the place by the end of the year, if not the dominant strain outright in a matter of weeks."
19934,"Per capita, DeSantis killed 20,000 more Americans than Maryland."
19935,I thought his name was Brandon?
19936,"No shit, plus no risk of death on a vent or permanent disability"
19937,[removed]
19938,Some things are larger then repercussions
19939,Vaccine mandates on flights or mandatory testing would be a great idea about now.
19940,Especially with more Holiday travel looming.
19941,Hey y’all.
19942,"So I was trying to figure out the lethality rates for delta versus the original strain, as I got into an argument and I was under the assumption it was less lethal but more transmissible."
19943,"So I googled it, and the articles that popped up were quite strange."
19944,"Very little analysis, lots of inconclusive studies bereft of much data, yet each of these stories seems desperate to imply delta is more lethal."
19945,How is this not widely available information?
19946,"The entire world is working on this problem and we can’t get a simple graphic comparing lethalities of two strains, each of which we have tens of millions of data points for (and probably way more)."
19947,My spider sense says this information is being strategically suppressed.
19948,"After all, if delta were more lethal, every news org would be shouting it from rooftops."
19949,Thank god someone said—news media outlets everyone salivating at the chance to post sensationalized headlines and riling up the masses
19950,No chance that they'd test positive if they were infected on the flight.
19951,"If that somehow was the case, then this variant replicates and is detected a lot faster than anything we've seen yet."
19952,[removed]
19953,"I feel bad that you mourn my tastebuds, but then i remembered what canned pears taste like."
19954,When we talked about how important it is to protect and vaccinate the immunocompromised I don't think the mutation aspect got talked about enough
19955,[removed]
19956,I didn’t bother translating.
19957,Did they say when this person first got infected and when their test went to be sequenced?
19958,There is zero evidence that it is milder than past variants at this point.
19959,Stop spreading misinformation.
19960,[removed]
19961,That is exactly the method that we used to develop vaccines back when they would use live vaccines.
19962,"That's why some of the development of vaccines took decades, because they needed to replicate and test the virus millions of times."
19963,Modern vaccines of course are no longer live as live vaccines pose a significant risk to individuals who are unable to fight off even the reduced variant.
19964,Non-live vaccines are much safer because of course you are not getting sick with the virus itself but rather exposed to the protein of the virus (like the spike protein of covid).
19965,"But, even then proteins are intensely complex folds and the work to produce them in vaccines can take a lot of time."
19966,"That's why RNA based vaccines are particularly wonderful in that we simply sequence the RNA of the virus, attach it to a nice fat lipid so it will enter our cell and deliver the RNA to the ribosomes who will then do the hard work of synthesizing the protein for us."
19967,"It's really neat :) 

As for purposely making a less transmissible variant, this would take far more time to develop since we would have to do the first method that I mentioned above\^."
19968,Our efforts are much better focused in the immediate aftermath of a pandemic on developing a vaccine using our fastest and safest methods.
19969,"I don’t doubt it, though travel bands from a country with a surge shouldn’t be considered as being treated like pariahs, or at least you shouldn’t be surprised."
19970,It’s tribalistic business as usual from other countries.
19971,I greatly appreciate what SA did for us by communicating on Beta so well and now Omicron.
19972,Science is moving quickly.
19973,"Or this is great news, the new variant is so mild that even with strong spread, mass majority actually don't even feel sick so few bothered to wear masks."
19974,Most of South Africans aren't even vaccinated.
19975,"Health experts better not start saying ""antibodies/efficacy against anything besides hospitalization and death don't matter"" again when they JUST said they do matter and that's why everyone should get boosters."
19976,"Since amino acids are coded for by 3 nucleotides, and not every amino acid has a unique nucleotide code, it's also possible to have mutations that have no actual impact on what amino acid is created -- this allows them to estimate the baseline mutation rate for a virus."
19977,"On a global scale, this can be used to estimate how often non-impactful amino acid mutations should show up."
19978,Ones that show up more often than that  on unrelated chains of infection are likely to be areas the virus hasn't been optimized for its environment.
19979,Mutations that show up less often are areas that likely can't be mutated without a deleterious effect to the virus.
19980,"What's interesting about Omicron though is it has a very high number of amino acid mutations on the spike protein, which is completely disproportionate to the number of mutations it has on other proteins."
19981,"It suggests the genome faced selective pressures, rather than just some unknown heavily mutative process."
19982,"How old are you, mate?"
19983,I’m speaking to a selfish asshole that doesn’t care for the inconvenience of testing her children.
19984,"But, okay, whatever helps you sleep at night."
19985,"Believe it or not, growing children are the only reason to travel, and even then, there is still risk and it should be minimized as much as possible."
19986,"Parents, spouses, and businesses can be dealt with via calls and such."
19987,"It's not what everyone wants, but it's what we should be doing until we can reduce the risks from traveling."
19988,"Any international travel should involve a 2 week quarantine to be honest, would cut down on the tavern for fun and so allow peeps who feel the need to visit family get the option."
19989,So the issue is that this one is not like the other variants.
19990,It has a lot of studies mutations that we know individually make the virus a little fitter all in combination and then some new ones we do not know anything about.
19991,"Doomsday is not assured or anything of the sort, but you should not dismiss it simply because most the other variants turned out to be duds (relative to Delta, especially)."
19992,Be honest.
19993,Did you eat horse paste to cure your COVID?
19994,&gt;	At least two infection in Hong Kong were vaccinated.
19995,Like literally every single other variant has.
19996,Luckily we still have people around like you to needleasly help incite panic anyway.
19997,The problem is defining essential travel.
19998,Is going on holiday essential (no)?
19999,Is visiting my family after 2 years (maybe no)?
20000,Is visiting my sick parent (probably yes)?
20001,How do you prove any of those things realistically in a way that isn't insanely bureaucratic?
20002,And how (or why) do you enforce quarantine in the EU.
20003,"There are open borders between all the countries and even if one country enforces very costly hotel quarantines, it will enter via the backdoor."
20004,The current approach (test pre flight and after) is working well so far and we don't know if this mutation is actually more dangerous yet.
20005,"We have quickly implemented a quarantine and ban system until we know more info on how this variant has effects, but locking everything down in the hope this magically goes away just isn't feasible under any government (unless already very independent and geographically isolated like NZ, but even then they have had to bow to the reality of living with the virus now)"
20006,Ah yeah.
20007,"You see, you need the give the airlines the time to honor the tickets for the next few days and not cut off the flights immediately."
20008,It might \*inconvenience\* some people.
20009,"And then they have to issue refunds - t's like, a whole thing."
20010,You can't mess with the business.
20011,"Let the whole country take it up the ass, for shareholder value shall not be infringed."
20012,"Yeah, viruses mutate thousands of times a week, but those mutations are shit for reproduction and spreadability and so die out just as quick."
20013,The mutations that stick around are the ones that show improvements in it survivability which is always bad news for us.
20014,So so most mutations are harmless doesn’t mean that the one mutation we worried about is nothing to scoff at.
20015,The person trying to distract us with that is either a stooge or has an agenda.
20016,"With the UK being the best at genomic sequencing, we should at least get some more concrete data from this"
20017,"I don’t agree with the “total breakthrough” and “10% morbidity” parts, but this is pretty much spot on."
20018,"We were to the point where we have vaccines that bring the severity in line with the flu, and vaccine availability is pretty damn good."
20019,This is our new normal.

20300,Im genuinely confused
20301,To get a real answer will probably require waiting and collecting data from hospitalization numbers.
20302,Scientists are continuing to test the antibody response in vitro.
20303,You may see some scary data in the coming weeks like Omicron causes a x-fold decrease in antibody binding but we don't yet know how that translates to practical protection.
20304,Swapping out the RNA sequence should be pretty trivial.
20305,Pfizer's manufacturing time from raw material to final product is about 60 days plus the logistics of shipping and getting shots into arms.
20306,I don't know what arrangements they've made to expedite the testing and qualification.
20307,Well I guess even in that case it could be a good thing we have a lot of natural immunity in the population now too.
20308,And vaccine overlap.

20310,The count was zero.
20311,The doctor even called out the “journalist” for using scary words in her buildup to a question- undoubtedly so she could also write a scary headline.
20312,Good try though.

20314,"Or different ones, perhaps, who actually know something about immunology?"
20315,It’s weird how the world is reacting to Omicron vs other variants.
20316,"Which leaves me to believe that the initial data scientists on the ground are seeing, is that it’s most likely appearing to (insert what article says)."

20337,https://nos.nl/artikel/2407322-rivm-vermoedelijk-omikronvariant-bij-besmette-reizigers-zuid-afrika
20338,Everyone agrees that we need more data before we can confirm anything.
20339,But “every single scientist” is not against prudent precautionary measures in the meantime.
20340,"Yeah like the other commenter said, it's a cost-benefit situation when it comes to delay."
20341,The only downside of delaying the doses is literally just the fact that you're working with just one dose the entire time during the delay.
20342,"Delaying itself, however, allows the immunity to stick longer."
20343,And it's looking like the ideal delay is around 6 months.
20344,Oh for sure.
20345,Everyone just needs to calm down though until we know more.
20346,Panic is counterproductive.
20347,Is it right that you need to wait 6 months to get the booster after you're initial jabs?
20348,"I cannot answer your question exactly, BUT none of the people currently hospitalised with it are fully vaccinated (2 doses, not including boosters in that definition of fully)
 https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1464297685826117639?t=UDRj98254u2OwFBl28yO6A&amp;s=19"
20349,"Stay strong, please."
20350,This virus will eventually wither.
20351,"Get your boosters when available, and hang in there."
20352,"Myself I'm asthmatic, so I'm still being extremely carefull."
20353,I know how it feels to struggle to breath.
20354,I really do not want this virus.
20355,It's frustrating.
20356,Right.
20357,And most likely it will be fine.
20358,But they have no idea about the new variant.
20359,There is just no data yet.
20360,I’ve dealt with a manager feeling the same way.
20361,I think part of it is her being older and struggling with technology.
20362,Probably also needs to see people working to feel comfortable.

20372,Reading comprehension is important.
20373,"And countries closing borders to other countries, stock markets crashing, and the literally hundreds if not thousands of breaking news headlines isn't the world freaking out?"
20374,Alrighty then.
20375,What data?
20376,"They don't know if it is more transmissible, they don't know if it evades the vaccines, they don't know if it causes more serious illness."
20377,Everything is speculation right now  They discovered it 72 hours ago and at last check there were less than 200 cases.
20378,"Yet NYC, France and others are declaring states of emergency and code reds etc."
20379,"Like I said, if this is the world reaction to every new variant (even variant of concern if that makes you feel better) then this is life from now on because covid will never be gone and there will always be new variants and new variants of concern."

20385,And the Netherlands has reported 61 of about 600 passengers from Johannesburg to Amsterdam tested positive.
20386,That’s about 10%.
20387,So far.
20388,Some may still test positive later.
20389,And just think of all the Thanksgiving travelers going through all of these airports.
20390,How many are getting exposed and taking it home?
20391,"How many earlier travelers got exposed, got infectious, and took it to Thanksgiving Dinner and Black Friday shopping?"
20392,We likely would not yet know.

20398,Happy 2020-too!
20399,Lol k
20400,For another two weeks.
20401,Chance that this variant will severely worsen the global situation is low.
20402,"I think once we have more information, this will calm down."
20403,It should but it won’t.
20404,Look up the recently released case data of 60+ age in Uk.
20405,"In October cases were high in those ages, then all old people got boosters and cases completely sunk."
20406,The booster data is very promising.

20470,"Which to be fair, they kinda have been."
20471,Really hope they're right about this being a nothingburger.
20472,Because of the liberal media narrative
20473,Start polishing up those Herman Cain Awards for these folks.
20474,"There's no evidence that would suggest that the Omicron variant meaningfully evades vaccine immunity, and even if it did, affinity maturation would help in the presence of an active immune response."
20475,Get your booster now if it's been 6+ months since your second dose of Pfizer/Moderna or 2+ months since your J&amp;J dose.
20476,Dammit.
20477,You are unfortunately probably right at least until they see the first person completely covered in blisters.

20480,"There's a famous photo of two boys with smallpox, one vaxxed and one not, that shows just how horrific it was."
20481,My doctor is extremely pessimistic about our survival chances at this point.

20483,That is what's been seen so far in the small number of cases that have been detected.
20484,It's not necessarily what actually is true over all.
20485,We can hope that's the end result of this variant.
20486,"And if it is, that's really good news, especially if it can outcompete delta and, along with the vaccines, turn this thing in to a cold."
20487,"However, we just don't know yet, and we can't act as though we do."

20490,Why feared?
20491,We have no information yet on lethality or vaccine effectiveness.

20556,We have yet to create 100% effective vaccines to stop those from transmitting and mutating; covid will be no different until our technology improves.
20557,Influenza A alone (aside from influenza B) has many variants and still mutates year to year.

20626,"No, it's not thought to be some unholy mixture of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 lmao."
20627,"The only relevance of the suspected incubation in an immunocompromised individual is that the lack of effective immune response potentially allowed the virus ample time to evolve and mutate within that single host, thereby accumulating many mutations."

20669,Pretty common in a lot of Asian countries anyways before the pandemic
20670,"Worst case scenario, you're more protected against Alpha and Delta."
20671,"Best case scenario, you're protected against this variant as well."
20672,Seems like a pretty strong argument.
20673,Yes we are nowhere near March 2020.
20674,I hope people don’t assume that is the case.
20675,"Even though it’s been far from perfect, we have well-proven, safe vaccines and we know that masking, distancing, tracing and isolating remains as effective now as it has in the past."
20676,"Ok, so what’s up with all the PRAYER WARRIORS not being heard and uncle jeb dies anyways?"
20677,"I think everyone is on edge as we’re all so tired and have come so far, that while this wouldn’t take us back to the beginning, it would be a huge setback if it had a bad outcome."
20678,It’s born out of anxiety.
20679,"I’m Russian, during October and November several of my fully vaccinated acquaintances and friends got covid, two went in hospitals, one of them required Levilimab monoclonal antibody."
20680,All are 35-45 years old.
20681,"A year ago, when vaccines were already available to anyone here, we were told that revaccination will be needed yearly."
20682,Then each six months.
20683,Now some EU countries are talking of five months.
20684,"This is a common knowledge that current vaccines are ineffective even against Delta, they are already unable to stop the pandemic: we witness new waves in countries with very high proportions of vaccinated population."
20685,"So, I’ll continue wearing masks, social distancing, and will wait for something new: actual effective vaccines, or advances in specific therapy."
20686,I hate those people...
20687,Is it possible that this is what's going on in Germany but hadn't been detected?
20688,Schools aren't the main vector when masks are used diligently.
20689,yeah ...
20690,No country has a monopoly on irrational behavior.
20691,That's what this experience is showing - including that developed countries are not behaving better than developing ones.
20692,The world is far too interconnected to be able to isolate variants of this virus.
20693,"By the time it's identified, I assume it's already too late."
20694,I don’t believe this.
20695,"Then you have this EU health official on CNBC in literally the middle of the night in the USA saying neither vaccines, immunity from previous infection nor monoclonal antibodies work against Omicron."
20696,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/11/26/europes-health-agency-is-quite-concerned-about-new-covid-variant.html
20697,Why was my comment not considered high quality?
20698,"&gt;there is a gap between the medical and lay definitions)

this is true of severe as well."
20699,i forget the exact definitions but essentially no one should say they had bad covid unless they ended up in a hospital
20700,Short term memory issues.
20701,"Ya - I knew they didn't want to use location names (and rightly so) - but greek letters can be trademarked just like our own alphabet (there are thousands of trademarks on the letter ""S"" making it the most popular of the alphabet)."
20702,Anyway - I was just curious if there might have been some consideration for this or if maybe businesses should be more aware of the taxonomy.
20703,Also - I'm not marginalizing this issue (COVID) in case anyone thinks that - this just piqued my interest and curiosity.
20704,No no you do not understand.
20705,IT's already here.
20706,It's already everywhere and we all just had a huge holiday in the states with shopping as the dessert.
20707,Force mandates.
20708,"Children should have it easier, not harder."
20709,"Dont allow antivaxers to enter certain states, districts, businesses, schools, airports, etc."
20710,"Honestly, purposely putting your country in danger should be jailable."
20711,"This should be a much bigger deal than what ""rights"" you have."
20712,If you had the plague do you have the right to go spread it around?
20713,"We need to seriously examine the type of people who dont care that they are making darker days for the future because they always say ""well i wont be here so i dont care""."
20714,That should be jailable.
20715,Destroying the environment and purposely giving away a deadly virus is exactly what they did to native americans.
20716,That should be jailable if we've learned anything.
20717,[removed]
20718,No this is how professionals react responsibly.
20719,Not being vaccinated and wanting to be told good things is how children react.
20720,It's incorrect to assert broad consensus that vaccines will be equally effective against the Omicron variant.
20721,"Evidence suggests the major vaccine manufacturers are fast-tracking boosters designed for Omicron, which certainly doesn't indicate a consensus belief that existing vaccines are sufficient."
20722,I've seen equally compelling analysis from mainstream infectious disease experts that the nature of the spike protein mutations make this variant more likely than any others to evade antibodies created by existing vaccines.
20723,"Of course, there may be some level of protection based on T-cells and immune responses other than antibodies, but there's almost no data to conclude in either direction."
20724,"I would be thrilled to be wrong about my concerns - like most other people, I'm at the end of my wits with this pandemic, and I'd welcome anything that would bring it to a conclusion sooner."
20725,"However, hoping the existing vaccines will continue to work before there's solid evidence to support that conclusion is not a strategy I'm willing to pursue for myself or my family."
20726,[removed]
20727,I agree 100%
20728,you can thank global corporations like FB for that.
20729,Their help with he propagation of disinformation and propaganda across their platforms can be correlated to similar anti-vax behavior globally.
20730,"The numbers I am talking about would be, for example, the share of people infected with this variant who end up with mild, moderate, or severe disease, hospitalized, intubated, etc."
20731,"Because Covid in general takes weeks to progress from infection to body-bag (assuming medical care is available) and, on top of that, there are signs this variant’s incubation period is longer, we’re still a little bit out from seeing what this variant does to folks on average."
20732,In the last 12 hours or so you’ve had some South African public health folks coming out and saying that they see this variant causing mostly mild illness (and what they mean by mild is unclear; there is a gap between the medical and lay definitions).
20733,"That is one of the few good signs we have seen regrading this variant thus far, and the next few weeks will see whether this is indeed the case."
20734,"It’s the same disease so it should produce the same outcomes everywhere, conditional on the vitality of medical care and public adherence to mitigation and treatment measures."
20735,Very on brand for America!
20736,"Not if you're vaccinated, you can travel to most of Europe and the UK."
20737,I don’t know.
20738,He really should have taken the opportunity to promote himself and used twitter instead.
20739,/s
20740,Yeah that’s my feeling.
20741,"Public transportation, grocery stores, etc fine with wearing a mask, but it just doesn’t make sense for restaurants/bars."

20765,I'm not aware of any public health expert who hasn't said that misinformation and vaccine hesitancy aren't a problem.
20766,But I'm also not sure how not advocating for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated would solve the problem.
20767,You don’t have to sequence this one really.
20768,"It gives strange readouts from the PCR, so it’s not really going to slip under the radar."

20774,Just good old Delta hitting the unvaxxed hard.
20775,Your point?
20776,I suppose that’s the difference with this.
20777,Delta was interpreted as wild type as we were variant testing for Beta at the time.
20778,"Or Florida, they get a lot of travelers this time of year, those are my top 3 picks."
20779,Then the answer is no
20780,"Is SA's advanced disease prevention infrastructure why 61 out of 600, or 10% of passengers in two KLM flights from SA to Amsterdam tested positive?"
20781,"if so, that doesn't say much about their prevention efforts tbh."
20782,I don't really care about masking being required in stores.
20783,I could do that somewhat indefinitely.
20784,"I do care about masking anywhere that gets in the way of things socially: restaurants, theme parks, gatherings... anything that you do with other people socially."
20785,Required masks in those situations gets very depressing very quickly after two years of pandemic.
20786,"One of my coworkers was rebelling by not wearing a mask because he “ain’t afraid of no virus with 98% survival rate” and I was thinking there are about 100 people employed here so if we all get it, the odds are that 2 people will die."
20787,"But if I said that to him, he’d just say masks don’t work anyway."
20788,Communities of course get prioritized after storms because of race.
20789,You just don’t recognize it.
20790,I live in Austin and watched myself as the white neighborhoods were prioritized during the winter storm.
20791,It’s obvious.
20792,The racism isn’t overt - white neighborhoods are just better served because of ingrained biases going back decades.
20793,&gt;Why downvotes?

20830,How is vaccine efficacy vs a new variant tested?
20831,Can researchers use an animal or in vitro model ?
20832,Do we wait until there are enough vaxxed hospitalizations and deaths for a meaningful statistic?
20833,"I am guessing this is the best data, and we just have to wait for it?"
20834,"Also, if a new vaccine is warranted, how easy is it to retool vaccine production?"
20835,Is it as trivial as replacing vanilla spike protein mRNA with the variant's and running the program?

20843,There were many flights.
20844,"After seeing that, I just stopped checking for other cities or other airlines."
20845,"Until Monday, many many flights will arrive into the US without any quarantines, and if passengers are carrying the virus, they will be spreading it."

20847,Yeah but let’s see how it goes.
20848,"Gamma had a bunch of mutations, Epsilon was a concern, but Delta managed to beat them all."
20849,Maybe some other one will do the same with Omicron!
20850,😅
20851,Thank you GuthrieBot!
20852,There is no reason to think this will be the case.
20853,Making these claims before anything is known muddies the waters and lays the groundwork for disinformation and rationalization of lapsed precautions against transmission.
20854,A virus that spreads before symptoms like rona has no reason to evolve this way.
20855,Can’t wait to fly home tomorrow.
20856,Ugh
20857,For sure.
20858,"Hell, we'd never have wars if people didn't have that complex."

20861,And all these places shutting there borders are dumb.
20862,All it’s going to do is stifle the share of information because nobody wants to become isolated.
20863,If there is one thing we should have learned - closing the borders doesn’t really do anything to stop the spread.

Your comment prompted me to think of a Woody Guthrie style song."
20965,"Worst ever, so far…"
20966,Thought I would reply in this thread to clarify some things.
20967,"Yes im\_on\_the\_case is right, if Omicron is incredibly transmissible but far less lethal we would see very widespread natural immunity amongst the world."
20968,"We actually already saw this from the 1890 pandemic which despite it's name as the Russian flu is largely suspected to be a coronavirus known as OC43, which still spreads to this day as the common cold."
20969,"Now, a lot of the population have a natural immunity to this coronavirus."
20970,If Omicron is far less lethal and results in less severe infection then this would be one of the best things to happen during this pandemic because it would spread relatively harmlessly (i.e.
20971,"does not result in ICU and hospitalizations like previous variants) then we would essentially acquire natural immunity, of course supplemented with those who are lucky enough to be vaccinated."
20972,"However, this might not be the case as reinfection rates are believed to be increased with Omicron and it has the potential to evade the immune system."
20973,"Whether this results in more severe infection, we do not yet know and we do not know how efficacious the vaccine protection is against it."
20974,i.e.
20975,"worst case scenario: far more transmissible, more/equally deadly, reduced vaccine response."
20976,"best case scenario: far more transmissible, far less deadly, allows for global acquired immunity"
20977,Thanks
20978,Thank you!!
20979,I've been reading up on it but hadn't found an article that explained it as well as this one.
20980,Yeah I agree.
20981,Feels like it might bias the result if its just easier to identify in any PCR test.
20982,Which makes the last sentence bother me since they say that means it might have a growth advantage but first say it's Judy easier to detect
20983,My best guess is a combination of extremely low vaccinations since they were new - this wouldn't impact anything much.
20984,My main guess is that we still had lots of restrictions and mandates in lots of places.
20985,Mitigation is pretty much nil in the US at this point.
20986,That appears be due to one day of like 18k.
20987,Seems like a data anomaly.
20988,The other recent days are elevated but not a huge exponential growth.
20989,NYY/Florida/California are the most likely.

20997,It’s almost as though permitting travel during a global pandemic is a bad idea.
20998,Were they hospitalized?
20999,I'm assuming not.

21002,Keep in mind that this was only detected 2 days ago and it’s far too early for there to be enough data to make any definitive conclusions with any confidence levels about anything.
21003,When SA/beta was first detected I had this massive dread /panic feeling for days/weeks aS I was worried about my 75 year old parents getting AZ instead of Pfizer (here in Canada) as AZ didn’t protect  well against beta.
21004,Then there was alpha and delta and where I am our city has over 90% vaccination for 12+(5-11 just start being vaccinated this week) and we have gone from a 7 day average of 20 cases per day to 40 cases per day over 3 months while lower vaccinated area have shot through the roof.
21005,Kids are in school and make up 25% of cases.
21006,We Went from 1.9 test positivity rate to 2.9 while other regions with low vaccination went to 20% tpr.
21007,"My point being, if you continue to mask up along with being vaccinated and restrict unvaccinated form events and eating out things will most likely continue to as they were."
21008,Don’t panic until there is ample evidence that’s vaccines aren’t effective at blocking infection or blocking moderate to severe cases and deaths.
21009,Hugs from Canada !
21010,"&gt;	like, why not the rest of the passengers who tested negative?"
21011,"they might test negative now but not in 2-5 days, theyve likely been infected in the plane

Because they’re stupid."
21012,[removed]
21013,Overreacting.
21014,"We know nothing about this variant yet with regards to the effectiveness of vaccines, hospitalisation and serious illness."
21015,"If you let news like this dictate your life plans, you're not going to have a life for a long time."
21016,Seems more people go and walk around outside in Amsterdam too.
21017,"The walking streets in the center are also much narrower, there really isn’t a whole lot of room to maneuver."
21018,I wonder if this variant will have any effect on the current US housing market?
21019,The market didn't seem to give a shit about delta - I wonder if omicron will be any different
21020,whelp I flew out of state for TGing but now I'm afraid to fly back because of omicron.
21021,"I realize it is not in the US yet, but that will probably change by Tuesday"
21022,"It’s not that they failed per se, it is that rapid tests are not accurate enough to reliably detect virus in asymptomatic people."
21023,This is a known drawback of the rapid test.
21024,I’m surprised that this flight required a rapid test within 24 hours and not a PCR test within 72 hours which is the norm around where I live.
21025,I’m guessing the tests they received when they got off the plane were PCR tests (several hours or even 24 hours to get results).
21026,"There is thought that if you aren’t producing enough viral shedding to trigger the rapid test, that you may not be producing enough virus to infect those around you (especially if everyone around you and/or yourself are vaccinated)."
21027,"This is more of a guideline than a hard belief though, as some people’s unique body chemistry may produce more or less viral load as time goes on."
21028,[removed]
21029,What do you mean the gvt did absolutely nothing to help?
21030,"Between PPP and specific funds for restaurants at various levels of gvt there was a tremendous amount of help – perhaps not enough relative to the crisis, but definitely a lot in historical context, and certainly not “absolutely nothing.” You can make the same point and have it be more or less as reasonable without the poorly grounded hyperbole."
21031,"All the studies about infection + vaccine immunity are about people who had covid, then got vaccinated afterward."
21032,"Do you know of any studies that have looked at the reverse order: full vaccination, then breakthrough case of Delta?"
21033,It’s weird that there’s no data on immunity about this when there have been many breakthrough cases.
21034,[removed]
21035,"Yea if things get too bad I'll look at cancellation or reschedule options, but I'm not to keen on it."
21036,Had to cancel a flight from Swiss airways in March 2020 and it took 7 months to finally get my refund.
21037,[removed]
21038,"Exactly, I don't know why everyone is pretending like like vaccines provide 100% immunity."
21039,I live with two people who are both fully vaccinated and both contracted covid.
21040,I am fully vaccinated but haven't got it.
21041,That's 2/3 living in the same household.
21042,Now I think what made the big difference is I am younger and received my final does much later than they did so potentially have stronger immunity than they do at present.
21043,Interestingly I also had bigger symptoms/side affects after I received my second dose than they did.
21044,I don't if that means much.
21045,"depends on how less lethal is it - if it's harmless enough to not even kill or seriously harm vulnerable people, it's fine."
21046,I think it would even be beneficial it it outcompetes and replaces delta in  that case.
21047,Because you’re assuming that any of this is actually about safety.

21057,could you explain this part?
21058,"i was under the impression that ""30 MuTaTiOnS"" was just the media exaggerating something that just happens with viruses."
21059,"do some of them have some significance that sets them apart Alpha, Delta, or some other that has become prevalent in an area?"
21060,"You could just shut down air traffic, stranding Americans but telling them they can come back if they find a way is legal."
21061,I don’t get the targeted bans though tbh.

21072,And/or
21073,[removed]
21074,"Yes, 10% positive, *after* they were required to present a negative antigen test to board."
21075,"In the best-case scenarios, it's a widespread issue with the antigen tests, but even then, 10% positive among people taken at random (who apparently feel good enough to travel) is disturbing."
21076,And people were saying Lambda and Mu were going to overwhelm us when they were first detected.
21077,Bottom line: we don't have enough info yet as to whether or not this will outcompete Delta.
21078,I agree with you.
21079,"Yes, the variants were identified but never really spread enough to have people talking about them."
21080,They pretty much all got out competed by delta
21081,2 shots still over very good protection.
21082,If toy really look at the breakthrough data it's not nearly as high as you would think when compared to the vacinated population size.
21083,Also the vast majority of breakthrough hostpital visits are over 50.
21084,I would have waited a couple of weeks to say that.
21085,Best game ever!
21086,Thanks for your contribution anyway.

21088,Record breaking profits for Pfizer and Moderna with their vaccines and boosters.
21089,You're tired of the bullshit but they're going to keep pushing it as long as they're making money.
21090,"I dont think so, here in Greece they sequenced 40.000 previous PCR tests in order to look for it and didnt find it."
21091,This is why the testing 72 hours before travel is just not enough.
21092,.
21093,We need to test more.
21094,Upon arrival.
21095,And frankly even after a 5-10 day quarantine too just to be safe.
21096,They were kept in the plane on the tarmac for about four hours and then bused to a room within the airport for another ten or so.
21097,"It was during this latter period that she commented on the masking, specifically to note that the airport officials present were doing nothing about it."
21098,"It was also during this period that the people in that room began to be informed that many of them had tested positive, though they initially learned this through news reports from outside rather than because anyone at the airport bothered to tell them directly at first; about a third of those present (by her estimate) refused to mask up even after receiving this information."
21099,"You’re right in general to be cautious about sensationalism, but this isn’t that."
21100,"As the WHO notes in its statement classifying Omicron as a variant-of-concern, a number of these mutations are known to be impactful."
21101,"These include, for example, E484A, K417N, N440K, and N501Y."
21102,"In combination, these make it both more contagious in general and also (theoretically) render antibody immunity whether acquired by vaccine and/or prior infection less effective."
21103,"Now, it is true that we do not have the data yet so this is all (reasoned) conjecture, but I have not seen an informed, compelling case explaining why these things would somehow not be problematic in practice, and I have been looking for one."
21104,I’m supposed to visit for Christmas and starting to wonder if I should try and bump my flight up a couple weeks to make sure I can get in before any shut downs…
21105,I want to hear from somebody else outside of South Africa.
21106,Taking our first trip to Europe on Wednesday from the US.
21107,Fully vaccinated + booster.
21108,What’s the likelihood there’s a travel ban before Wednesday that keeps me from going?
21109,"That sounds miserable, hope you both feel better soon!"
21110,People are selfish and never are a good judge of how likely bad things will happen to them.
21111,It’s like the lottery complex.
21112,we overestimate the chances of good things happening to us.
21113,and underestimate the chances of bad.
21114,[removed]
21115,"South Africa had extremely low cases overall, and pretty low vax rates."
21116,It's too early to say whether or not Omicron will outcompete Delta.
21117,There seems to be people who have a hard time catching covid.
21118,"It could be due to previous coronavirus infections in your lifetime, or maybe some people just have really robust immune systems."
21119,I know scientists are super interested in those people who never get sick from the virus
21120,Are you attempting a genetic fallacy?
21121,I worked at the hackathon which was funded by the German government in the beginning of the pandemic everybody thought about it the choose to not do it.
21122,It was mostly lobbying work.
21123,They also took all the work which was done by people like me gave it tontwo big tech companies which only did it when they could also install the hardware on which it's run.
21124,They got 300 million for that.
21125,Took them months to get the hardware running instead of Outsourcing it.
21126,"Because ""data protection"" ofc had nothing to do with the 300million"
21127,Also the PCR test indicates it’s omicron - that’s how other countries can go back and “find” potential cases from the past few weeks.
21128,"The sequencing for confirmation takes a while but it will be very, very likely they are all omicron because the PCR report is different for this variant."
21129,I think this pandemic will continue through the lifetimes of most people alive now!
21130,There is no reason to believe this will just go away.
21131,It will surge and mutate all over the world.
21132,Continued vaccination and improved therapeutics will be the way forward for those who value their lives and the lives of others.
21133,Many ignorant millions more will die and they will take others with them.
21134,The health care systems around the world are going to be in dire straits for the foreseeable future.
21135,Who would want to work for a system that is constantly overwhelmed?
21136,We live in a new world now.
21137,We literally know nothing about risk of hospitalisation and in fact SA are saying the affected people were mildly symptomatic and people are talking about lockdowns and shutting down economies for the literal fourth or fifth time as inevitable.
21138,"I mean, there has been cases on vairous places like Belgium, Germany, and Hong Kong already."
21139,"Even though they are all found in the airport, considering how human detection is slower than the actual spread, I am convinced that it has already went worldwide."
21140,"The thing is that, if the Omicron is easily distinguishable from Delta and we assume that it outspreads the other dominant variants, There should have been even more reported cases than now."
21141,Am I missing something here?
21142,No.
21143,Only people who suspect having covid get tests usually - so the positivity rate is skewed and does not represent the amount of infections in the actual population.
21144,"That’s not a study from the CDC, it’s a discussion of existing studies, but thanks for bothering to read."
21145,They are no longer the scientists who say Ni.

21149,Remember them saying that you could take missions from different factions?
21150,Those are in the game now.
21151,"There is an actual story to follow with NPCs, dialogue, and plot items that slowly teach you how to reach the center of the galaxy."
21152,This might be a spoiler: After reaching the center of the galaxy&gt;!

You can own multiple ships, land vehicles, and even pets that you can tame from any planet and take with you across the galaxy."
21157,There is a new story mission that rewards you with a LIVING SHIP that takes completely different resources to function and has different weapons that you can't get on normal ships.
21158,"&amp;#x200B;

You can own a massive freighter that can be warped around the galaxy like a mobile base."
21159,You can build bases inside the freighter or anywhere on any planet and set up resource gathering operations akin to something like Satisfactory.
21160,You can own a fleet of frigates that you can send on missions that reward you with rare materials based on the difficulty rating of said missions.
21161,"&amp;#x200B;

You can save an alien settlement and become its mayor, settling disputes, protecting it from sentinels, and telling it what resources to focus on."

21163,"&amp;#x200B;

There have been multiple updates to combat both in space and on foot."
21164,"They have added more weapons, tweaked the old ones, and allowed you to own more than one multitool so you can specialize your arsenal."
21165,"&amp;#x200B;

You can board derelict freighters in space and collect data aboard them that describe what happened to the crew."
21166,You can then sell this information to either a black market vendor or the local race/faction broker for different rewards.

I haven't even covered half of the stuff they've added since launch."
21168,If I were to do that this post would be too long.
21169,"The developers have even started making temporary story missions called Expeditions that show up like ""seasons"" where you can get exclusive cosmetics by completing them."
21170,All of this stuff is free.
21171,Every Expedition is free.
21172,"There is no paid DLC for any of this, there is no way to buy your progress with real money, and Hello Games intends to keep it that way."
21173,No Man's Sky is now the best space sim game out there.
21174,"I've seen players convert from Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and Space Engineers to become the biggest No Man's Sky fans."
21175,There is so much to get caught up on since its launch that you would probably have to watch 10 hours of videos to see it all.
21176,"It still isn't for everyone and fills a niche audience, but I'm happy to be part of that niche."
21177,"There was a data error in which ~800 cases were accidentally entered as ~18,000 cases."

21196,"It would, though, right."
21197,I mean 10% vs 9% of people sampled across the whole country is pretty close.
21198,It looks like the plane load of people was tracking with roughly the rate in the rest of the country.
21199,Aw i really appreciate it but I’m too broke unfortunately.
21200,I would totally go otherwise!
21201,FYI sequencing takes time.
21202,"The first 4 sequences (3 full from Botswana and 1 partial from Hong Kong) weren’t noticed until late Tuesday/early Wednesday (depending on your location), and then they still didn’t meet the criteria even for designation of a lineage."
21203,"The UK scientist who flagged them, Tom Peacock, did note that the mutations were concerning when he flagged them."
21204,Here’s where that happened: https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/343.
21205,A few additional sequences from South Africa were found very soon thereafter.
21206,The virologists and epidemiologists jumped on this.
21207,Most of the delay was getting the samples sequenced especially when the urgency was unknown.
21208,"From watching https://cov-spectrum.ethz.ch/, it is very rare for sequences to be uploaded to GISAID within the first week after sampling."
21209,"Uploads in the second week, especially early in the second week, are still unusual."
21210,"Many sequences seem to come in 3, 4, or 5 weeks after sampling."
21211,Some sequences don’t get uploaded for *months* after sampling.
21212,"So Botswana, Hong Kong, and South Africa moved *fast* on these samples."
21213,They deserve gratitude for their speed.
21214,"Fortunately, like Alpha and due to some of its mutations, Omicron shows S-gene drop-out on one of the common and faster RT-PCR tests."
21215,That is helping monitor the spread.
21216,S-gene RT-PCR drop-outs are now being presumed to be Omicron until proven otherwise.

21218,I'm going to say this.

Some of us are just over it."
21222,"It's been years, not months."
21223,I got vaccinated.
21224,What did other Americans do?
21225,"Many of them said ""No thanks!"
21226,"I don't care about your health or ability to travel!!!"""
21227,So guess what?
21228,I'm done.
21229,I'll get my PCR test before my flight.
21230,I'll PCR test again before I fly back.
21231,I'm doing much more than other people are.
21232,I did my part.
21233,I masked.
21234,Other people are doing NOTHING.
21235,So I'm gonna travel.
21236,Sue me.
21237,"So some countries are doing more variant testing than others; South Africa and UK being two of them, which is why variants show up there."
21238,Not necessarily because they’re originate there.

21253,Well let's wait and see but I seriously doubt it'd be a lockdown announcement.
21254,"More than likely it'll be a reassurance message to address the media hype, and another ask urging people to get their boosters."

21261,does anyone with some math skills know how many samples are actually sequenced in a typical country?
21262,"hypothetically if 1% of positives are sequenced there should be a very high chance that low percentage variants are missed until they suddenly pop up everywhere, right?"
