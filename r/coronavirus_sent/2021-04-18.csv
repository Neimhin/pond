1,I'm not either.
2,Probably because you don't have to freeze it at -100 degrees
3,useless dollars?
4,we exported the vaccines for free.
5,i wish we got useless dollars.
6,You just seem to be an unnecessary dickhead
7,"I think there's a major difference in the demand for the flu vaccine compared to the covid vaccine, as the flu isn't a pandemic that shuts the entire world down."
8,"Rog, thanks brother"
9,They’re saying that the assumption is that the people who would travel internationally for a vaccine are probably wealthy enough to afford a jacked-up price.
10,And they’re suggesting using the profits from those vaccine sales to donate free vaccines to the global poor who don’t have the privilege/opportunity to travel for a vaccine.
11,So it’s not the same as jacking up the prices of insulin... unless Canada suddenly decided to take the profits from Americans buying insulin in Canada and use it to give poor people free insulin.
12,Yes he’s saying we’ve been conditioned to negativity and a pandemic lifestyle that we will struggle to adjust to optimism and normality
13,Probably in a couple of months it will be lifted.
14,"Does not make any sense to have one of the most vaccinated places in the world banned, while most of the rest of the world have little vaccines and can go as they please to the US."
15,This has been true for a couple weeks I believe.
16,We were at 100M two weeks ago which is 50% of the over 18 population.

19,Is this an actual model of the amount of doses administered by then or just how many doses are delivered by then?
20,And is it a first dose for all adults who wants it or a first dose for 100% of the adult population?
21,"The EU has produced just as many Vaccines 
as the US the difference is that they actually shipped out some of those vaccines to different countries."
22,The EU has plenty of vaccine manufacturing to take care of themselves.
23,"2.73 Lakh = 273,000"
24,"Just divide this week's cases by last week's cases (or 7-day rolling average, but you really need to look at full weeks to avoid weekend reporting issues) and exponentiate it to the 5/7 (for a 5-day serial interval)."
25,No online web site is gonna do anything different or better than that.
26,"[Israel](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/) : (159/241)^\(5/7\) = [0.74](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=%28159%2F241%29%5E%285%2F7%29)

The 5/7 part doesn't really do anything; just looking at week-over-week growth gives you the same exponential rate on a weekly basis instead of a 5-day basis."
27,But if you want to figure out how many more vaccinations we need to get to a certain level it's the actual R value we'd want to know.
28,5.0 day serial interval remains the best estimate I've seen.
29,Israel's R has been slowly rising.
30,"The US has been pretty flat, but case numbers might be unduly low today because of snowstorms (even looking at full-week averages can't solve the smoothing problems of holidays or storms)."
31,"That surprises me, it’s good to hear."
32,I’m happy for you!
33,Hope you both have an amazing time together!
34,These are the shit takes I come to this sub for.

36,There are plenty of stuff to do in Alaska.
37,Unless you’re implying something else.
38,"Last summer I didn't think restrictions could last into 2021, but here we are."
39,I'm starting to think the restrictions will never end unless the people literally refuse to comply with them.
40,Uhhh...can you actually find something that indicates that?
41,US-Canada.
42,We are about a month behind the US in vaccinations.
43,We had a slow start for sure.
44,But we are looking at  all adults first does by end of June.
45,36 degrees today.
46,So happy masks are done for

48,Removing the J&amp;J vaccine from the market was such a terrible decision.

91,I feel so bad for the people in India and Brazil who don’t have access to the vaccine like we do.
92,We are so lucky...I read that babies are dying from it in India.
93,Heartbreaking
94,People in my neighborhood do to walk their dogs.

122,Sat down with a bartender on Friday and walked him through the lost until we found an appt that worked with his schedule.
123,"Checked in on him today and so far just ""punched in the arm"" effects."
124,"Thus far, around here, everyone I know in the early 20s on up is all for getting it."
125,"A lot were preferring the idea of J&amp;J for ""one and done"" to pickup faster, but so far everyone's been happy with ""the best vaccine is the first one you can get"" as a final mentality."
126,Are you talking about USA - CAN or NED - CAN?
127,If it is between US and Canada they're probably around a month behind (Canada).
128,But NL and Canada are very similar I think.
129,"The Netherlands should be at 50% of the adult population with a first dose by mid-May, a milestone the US just passed."
130,So that's exactly a month difference.
131,I thought Canada was very similar to the EU in terms of deliveries the coming months.
132,"I know the that Canada uses a pretty extreme 1-dose strategy, while the Netherlands uses a stretched 2-dose strategy (4 weeks Moderna, 6 weeks Pfizer and 12 weeks AZ)."
133,So that will change the first dose : fully vaccinated  ratio.

200,.... *waves from afar in mexican*
201,The pandemic is not over.
202,Being vaccinated is a good defense against the virus but it will require over 70% of people to being either fully vaccinated and/or having natural immunity before we reach herd immunity.
203,We are getting closer to that but we still have too many cases and a couple of hotspots around the country.
204,Many people have a false sense of security when vaccinated but trust me as someone in a hot spot I already know a couple of people fully vaccinated and got covid.
205,The clinical trials were also conducted when both the control group and vaccinated group followed social distancing and mask wearing guidelines.
206,If vaccinated people decide not to take precautions then the efficacy rate will fall compared to unvaccinated (and non immune) people who do take precautions.

223,This is... getting a bit dumb.
224,"There's been more and more information and a stronger and stronger consensus building that vaccinated people spread the disease at an incredibly reduced rate (massively reduced chance to catch it and then massively reduced chance to infect others on top of it), and that's coming in on top of simple common sense about how this shit should work - not just ""scientific common sense"" (if there is such a thing) about how vaccines work, but also social common sense, about incentivizing people to get the shot."

289,How was this account allowed to stay up on eBay for 2 weeks?
290,A large number of the people I know who got Covid (including my mom) got it from a co-worker who came in sick.
291,And I’m not talking about “had Covid but was asymptomatic”.
292,I’m talking about coming in with actual symptoms.
293,"My mom caught it from her co-worker who was congested, but figured it was just a cold."
294,"My mom is all “Well, even if it’s a cold, I still don’t want it!”  So this idiot gives Covid to my 63 year old mother (she was fine)."
295,I feel like pushing this messaging of staying home even if you think it’s just a cold would have helped far more than standing on our little designated circles at the store.
296,"Too many people had it in their heads that Covid is always super severe when the vast majority had simple cold symptoms, which exacerbated the spread substantially."
297,That's not really the point.
298,Your statistics are wrong.
299,"19.1% of Georgians are fully vaccinated, but we’ll over 30% have had at least one dose."
300,Same goes for the other southern states you cherry picked.
301,"They are still lagging states like New York, but it’s not as dramatic as a difference as you made it seem."
302,"And considering Southern states feature large numbers of African Americans and conservative whites, this shouldn’t be a surprise."
303,"Maybe they’ll catch up eventually, though."
304,There is 0 chance that Pakistan's daily deaths are anywhere near that low.
305,None.
306,"Some places, it’s not that we think it’s cool or it makes us tough but that we can’t afford to miss work and work doesn’t provide enough or any time off."
307,"Well we are already over 50% of all adults receiving at least one dose and it just opened up to all adults today, we can assume most of the 50% who received their first dose will finish their vaccination."
308,"The 65+ age group is around 80%, far more than I thought would get vaccinated as boomers are a very stubborn group."
309,I think we get well over 60% of adults being vaccinated.
310,My guess is somewhere in the 70% range for all adults easy.
311,"Then as you say, after vaccines are approved not under EUA, businesses, travel, colleges, and hospitals will start requiring vaccines."
312,You want your elective surgery?
313,You have to be vaccinated.
314,"You want to go to Europe, vaccine proof please."
315,"Cruise, COVID vaccine (you'll probably get the norovirus tho, cause cruise ships are nasty, lol)."
316,I also have a theory.
317,"After most people are vaccinating and the pandemic while still going on but mostly under control here, it will not all over the news and politics 24/7."
318,"Folks not wanting it because of political reasons will start getting vaccinated slowly as their doctors, family members, etc."
319,start telling the should be vaccinated.
320,Minus the crazy anti-vax people.
321,"Most people trust their doctors and when sat down and have an honest conversation about the vaccine, I think most will get vaccinated."
322,Yes
323,This post appears to be about vaccines.

326,*
327,So it does turn you gay!
328,"That is a simplistic formula, the assumptions used for that are not exactly applicable to the real world."
329,Fine for a first hand approximation but the real world is more complicated.
330,[removed]
331,First wave was surprisingly well handled.
332,The initial complete lockdown definitely helped.
333,Though the numbers still seem under reported and testing in general was slow the overall of affect it had was no where close to this second wave.
334,In the first wave 3 people I know got infected.
335,Now from my circles maybe 30 or more and 2 acquaintances dead.
336,It is an unfortunate situation.
337,"Students should ideally be allowed to reschedule if they are sick, and usually are with a doctor's note."
338,But having to do a rescheduled exam means the professor has to do twice the work.
339,This happens sometimes anyway because you will get students who end up absent for other bigger reasons.
340,But if you allow students to call in sick to reschedule an exam with no note that basically means 100% of the time the professor will need to prepare 2 exams.
341,And then what happens if they call in sick again for the rescheduled date?
342,It isn't like just not going to work where all it takes is a delay in work or finding someone else to cover.
343,"A professor can't just give the student the same exam, they have to come up with a totally new one for each session."
344,I think the majority of people would not care if it was voluntary.
345,Most of the antimaskers are against the forced mask wearing.
346,"Without question , and this age cohort has the potential for a very large denominator"
347,I don't think Michigan or Ohio are.
348,I know plenty of people from Michigan who went to Ohio for vaccinations before Michigan opened up.
349,Lots of people are not vaccinated and never plan to be.
350,Those folks carry the risk of creating mutations that cause the vaccine.
351,Im living life fear free but it sure seems like this is a big risk of the vaccine fearing folks.
352,"It’s too late, they already decided some guy from Oxford is going to come and sneeze on them."
353,It's 50% one dose over 16
354,This is honestly a terrible sub.
355,Last fall half the comments were gloating about how badly america was doing and how terrible america people are and how we deserve to die in such high numbers.
356,"Meanwhile now, when someone brings that fact up everyone denies it ever happened."
357,"It's a toxic, doomersub that is somehow also way to casual about it's doom predictions."
358,"&gt;  Reinfections are possible and have been extensively documented, but they have been rare so far."
359,A recent study basically showed that around 20% of healthy young adults could get reinfected within a short time span (like 6 months) after their first infection.
360,[https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=255545](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=255545)
361,Even Fauci says he'd be comfortable dropping masks and social distancing if we can get down below 10k cases per day.
362,And he's ALWAYS overly cautious.
363,&gt;For the time being the infrastructure (super awesome freezers) we need for the current round of mRNA vaccines make shipping them to less fortunate countries untenable.
364,That's not true.
365,"The ebola vaccine requires similar cold chain solutions, which was solved by a chinese freezer company making a portable, insulated and GPS enabled dry ice cooler"
366,"&gt; The country will ""cap out"" at somewhere between 50-60% of all adults vaccinated

Given that we're already above 50% of all adults vaccinated, I find it hard to believe that there is less than 10% unvaccinated adult Americans remaining who will want to get the vaccine."
367,&gt; I will always adjust my behavior based on risk.
368,"If you’re so data-driven, what’s the probability of death or debilitation from covid caught at an indoor restaurant?"
369,"Since you claim to adjust your behavior based on risk data, and have adjusted it to avoid restaurants, you must have a quantitative answer to this."
370,"And if they want to continue being stupid and selfish, that’s on them."
371,Stay home.
372,Don't punish others with your own selfish stupidity.
373,"So AstraZenica publicly kicked out, 15m J+J doses down the drain, and all for nothing."
374,You need a time machine.
375,That's absurdly reductionist.
376,"It's not that they'd rather get people sick, it's that they don't think they'll get it."
377,"Minor quibble, from news articles it seems like the lockdown was started on the 18th (merely announced on the 13th), not that it necessarily invalidates your points."
378,Well reducing the denominator is another way to reach herd immunity.
379,"&gt;the downstream effects of india collapsing are just enormous

I predict a whole lot of IT systems going down and customer support being completely unreachable."
380,Agree.
381,80% in the highest age bracket already have it.
382,"I think we’ll see a bit less cooperation with the 50s and upper 40s crowd, but I think for the most part, we’ll get to 70% for everyone else."
383,And it’s not like kids are never getting it.
384,"Once they do, they’ll easily push us into herd if we aren’t there already."
385,Omw to get my 2nd pfizer rn
386,Even Fauci is saying it'll be very likely your age group (12-15) gets it by September and he's always overly conservative.
387,But I don't know if we'll see under 12 this year.
388,But if we can get everyone else to a high percentage then I guess that's not a huge concern.
389,Because the cdc still won't study gun violence...duh
390,"I slept for like 12 hours the next day (on top of a full night's sleep), and took decent naps (2-3 hours) on the day of, and two days after too."

399,Not fearful.
400,Just cautious and considerate of the fact that we can still spread Covid.
401,"In other words, we think about more than ourselves."
402,Imagine that.
403,I truly hope you are correct... maybe a bit off on timing.
404,I’m just getting worried about how much of a problem vaccine hesitancy is going to be in rural areas.
405,Thanks.
406,Eventually we will have good data on the risk presented.
407,I will always adjust my behavior based on risk.
408,Your dad's friend is now a test case.
409,Please keep us updated!
410,"Think we have a different definition of young adult, I'm talking more about the 20-30 year old crowd."
411,Have seen a lot of statistics that this group is currently polling as the least likely to get the vaccine.
412,"I think the worry is that many in this group have already begun to return to more of a pre-covid ""normal"", and likewise the rest of the country is moving in that direction as a whole anyway, so some may feel as if there's no real point in them getting the vaccine at this point as we're already ""coming out of it"" regardless."
413,"There are definitely many in this age group who were jumping to get the vaccine including myself and a vast majority of my friends, however I think a lot of the super enthusiastic people have likely already gotten their first dose at this point depending on what state you're in."
414,"It's similar to how a lot of this age group, at least from my anecdotal experience, at some point over the last year developed mild covid symptoms but never got tested because of general apathy."
415,"This is a nice map of future COVID hotspots so I know to avoid traveling there for the remainder of this year, at least."
416,Eligible and able to get it are very different.
417,This is worse than getting a ps5 lol
418,Like Walgreens censored it or your email did?
419,I hope not.
420,I EAGERLY await the end of mandatory masks.
421,"But pre-pandemic, people freaked out that they were in the presence of a leper if they saw someone wearing one."
422,"My hope is that if the elderly want to wear a mask at the market when people around them are coughing and hacking, that we'll now be more okay with it."
423,"Perhaps I'm being too optimistic about human tendencies, though."
424,"I like the Aquabats and Reddit is vulgar, hence the name :-)."
425,Because Fauci and others are being too cautious about messaging and it is having the double whammy of making people scared when they're safe and making people think the vaccine is useless.
426,You would think this shit doesn't work if you've been following just what people say about it!
427,And you don’t have to have insurance.
428,That’s just so they can bill the insurance company for the administration if possible.
429,"I posted the worldometers link in my original comment, don’t know if that got taken down for whatever reason, cases are still dropping."
430,"&gt;Because nothing is ending it

Because people don't wear masks and don't want to get vaccinated or socially distance."
431,People are being idiots and it is prolonging this thing.
432,"NONE of the key numbers are down in the past month: infections, hospitilizations and deaths."
433,"And Fauci has said that once we get to below 20k infections a day, then it will be a lot easier to handle things."
434,Habits are hard to break.
435,The science shows that vaccines are extremely effective.
436,"It's time we trust the science and resume normal life as soon as everyone has had a chance to be vaccinated, which should be in about 6 weeks (Memorial day)."
437,We need politicians to start laying out a short term plan to end mask mandates &amp; lift restrictions.
438,We also need to push back on fearmongers such as u/Real-life.
439,"&gt; lockdowns do in fact work incredibly well when needed

When they are draconian, and you can tightly control entry points to the area being locked down."
440,"The kind of things they were calling ""lockdowns"" here in CA, I'm skeptical they were worth the trouble."
441,"The formula for herd immunity is

1-1/r0

Where r0 is the reproductive rate of the virus."
442,"That means if changes all the time, and is based on how much the virus is spreading at the moment."
443,"That's it, it's about viral spread."
444,"My entire family in Benares, Patna, and Delhi have this including my parents."
445,"Everyone over there is saying it is much worse than first wave and more deadly too, but I think it’s just spread faster so people are seeing it in their own lives for the first time a lot of the times."
446,This wave is like how January was for me here in the US when 60% of folks I know got it.
447,"I just hope my family, American citizens, are able to come back before travel is blocked."
448,I doubt it for my parents as they are caring for my grandma who is very sick (non covid reasons).
449,But hopefully my brother can come back so he can start college this fall.
450,Hopefully my parents don’t die either.
451,Eh.
452,Who would have thought...you bring people into an enclosed space during an airborne virus and shocker....it spreads... s/
453,&gt; mask the **** up.
454,I got my second dose a few weeks ago.
455,Absolutely packed with little regard for distancing until you were actually going to get a shot.
456,"A room full of people for hours on end probably isn’t safe, even if they distanced us."
457,This is definitely dependent on where you go.
458,My first shot was in an area like this but my second shot was in a Rite Aid.
459,"the chicago teachers union is still fighting for vaccinating all kids before they force 100% in person learning, which causes a lot of meltdowns from the usual suspects."
460,"Lol, our teachers union is officially being ignored by board members and not allowed to even ask questions of board members."
461,"So I got my vaccine follow up email from Walgreens and I noticed that the word Covid 19 was censored, does anyone know why?"
462,That's wonderful.
463,I wasn't aware of this development.
464,Hope it accelerate serums production output
465,"I actually tried to sign up this morning, but for some reason my state doesn't add more slots till noon."
466,I guess I will sign up then.
467,"Yeah, the risk is low, but with a big enough denominator you'll still get enough cases to fill a hospital."
468,Does this include 16-17 as well because in washington and I think california they included 16-17

470,"The problem is, people usually only call in sick when they have a fever."
471,"However, the recovery process for a flu is about a week and you’re still going to be couching up a lung or have a fountain of mucus from a runny nose."
472,"At that point, you’re still contagious."
473,How do you send an employee home for a week if their job requires manual or on-site labor?
474,Got both doses in TN.

491,"These places offered vacation days (ONLY) an since we were100% commission no work no pay and also getting a lot of flack for not showing,people came in."

595,"Funny, I was nauseated the first half of the day after my first shot."
596,Second shot was almost completely uneventful.
597,"I went to bed the night of the second shot freezing, but it could have been chalked up for me feeling chilly on a rainy night."
598,Meanwhile community college requires that you wait 17 hours for a parking space.
599,"I'm gonna rip my hair out if I see someone else say ""a few more weeks""."
600,I'll bet my life savings that a month from now people are saying the exact same thing.
601,You might as well copy your comment and repost it in late May.
602,Yeah they've been ordered but there is only so much manufacturing and shipping capacity.
603,3 million a day is moving along at a good clip.
604,"I'd be surprised if we managed to hit 5 million a day,and demand is going to start to be a limiter soon as we hit those who don't want it and those who can't get to a vaccination for various reasons."
605,It’s just a commonly used phrase on Reddit.
606,I don’t remember how it started.
607,"Wait, the sun actually shines in England?"
608,"I mean, your immunization records are sent to university from your doctor/pharmacist so I don't think the fake vaccine cards will be a problem."
609,What makes you assume this is even true?
610,"It may be, but let’s be honest, an anti-vaxxer would certainly come on here to stir up fear with a made-up story."
611,My entire family is fully vaccinated and not a single one of us has any issues at all.
612,"Maybe we are unique, but I doubt it."
613,"Long story short, don’t trust personal stories on the internet."
614,Source on the suicides?
615,"Because I was literally looking at the data yesterday and suicides are down in 2020 by a significant amount, it’s drug overdoses that are up."
616,True that.
617,Their world view is limited only to how things affect their lives and nothing more.
618,"Leaders, in Australia it was the states that did the leading the federal government wanted covid to run Rampant here in Australia our prime minister is not a leader he’s a religious moron who wants to be trump,"
619,I think I’m okay with my soul staying where it’s supposed to!
620,&gt;The states make it possible.
621,No they don't.
622,The U.S Central government is the one that pays for the vaccines.
623,The only thing the states are doing is assisting with distribution.
624,The states aren't the ones going out to get the vaccine.
625,&gt; If Texas wanted to it could have banned vaccines.
626,No they can't.

628,Meanwhile we’ve been averaging 40 per day in Michigan the past week with 1/6th the population.
629,Get me out of here already.
630,"Careful, Doctor Warner will come on tv and tell you about his ICU."
631,He makes more in one shift than most Canadians do in a month and has the gall to say we aren’t doing enough
632,Trump actively thwarted science and medicine at every turn.
633,I award zero points.
634,And may god have mercy on your soul.
635,I'm less worried about that.
636,That's not keeping my kids from having a normal childhood.
637,Showing I got it doesn't bother me.
638,"Well, I am 32, perfectly healthy."
639,"I got offered the AstraZeneca in February, but I decided to wait for Pfizer or Moderna."
640,"Just personal choice that I could afford, since I live alone and work from home (mostly)."
641,"I got my 1st shot in Poland, at the end of March."
642,Then I had to travel to Denmark (where I work) and just got the second shot here.
643,About 23 days later.
644,I didn't encounter many issues.
645,"Even when I went to get the shot, I didn't have to wait, just in and out."
646,Actually pretty surprised by the efficiency.
647,"For me, I tried getting it ages ago because I was eligible for medical reasons."
648,Couldn’t get an appointment!
649,"I got appointments twice, they got cancelled with no reschedule because the vaccines didn’t arrive."
650,I finally just gave up because I was taking so much time just trying to track down appointments.
651,I got vaccinated by pure luck.
652,Walking through an area that has a lot of undocumented population and they were running a “no questions asked” walk in clinic.
653,"Zero line, they said they had way more shots than people showing up so I posted it to a bunch of FB groups."
654,I hope the shots all got used!
655,Then what am I doing wrong to have never been selected?
656,"It pisses me off, I’ve not been selected for jury duty yet, I’m in the bone marrow registry but I’ve never been selected for that yet, i donate blood all the time, I routinely try to sign up for as many clinical trials as I can, and still haven’t been selected."
657,Is it due to my location and the fact that they would have to pay my travel to get near where these clinical trials are?
658,I’m a 27-year-old male if that helps.
659,[removed]
660,People who had little to no symptoms are probably a lot less likely to make their own comments about it.
661,But my first and second were both very chill and I had no problems.
662,"I don’t know anyone in real life who had a severe reaction to it, young or old."
663,"Not saying people don’t, but it probably feels more common on the internet"
664,Haha pretty much.
665,I’m WFH now and we don’t appear to be going back soon.
666,We had a coworker really hit hard from it and it spooked everyone.
667,"Honestly, just reading this is refreshing."
668,It's nice to have a little bit of optimism in the comments as opposed to cynicism.
669,"Obviously we're still far away from things being ""better"" but it's a huge leap when you consider where things were at a year ago."
670,So I'm hopeful that things will improve.
671,How dare a school wants everyone to be safe!
672,/s
673,Didn’t I read a month or so ago that despite lots of infections India was ‘paradoxically’ low in deaths?
674,I get it
675,I got my 2nd pfizer last Monday and had very mild effects.
676,No idea if it helped by I hydrated the day before and kept it up all day after I got my shot (got it at 8:30 am).
677,I'm talking 4+ liters of water throughout the day.
678,I'm in the desert so 2+ liters a day is already normal for me.
679,I ended up with soreness in my arm.
680,"I really only felt it if I tried to lift my arm to the side, up past my shoulder."
681,This lasted 2 days.
682,"Otherwise I just felt ""off"" the next day."
683,"Think like you went drinking the night before and don't have a hangover but you are just slow, off, and a little achy."
684,This was just the day after.
685,The next day I was back to normal.
686,What is your definition of heard immunity?
687,"Yes, I know this, and I don't think it's a binary thing."
688,I think you can pause and explain why you paused.
689,"As someone who works in pharma, I'm accustomed to hearing insane conspiracy theories and for every person who would be turned off upon finding out that there's a lethal side effect there's at least another who would see conspiracy if regulatory agencies didn't take it seriously."
690,"Hell, there are still people who think the vaccine contains a microchip from Bill Gates."
691,"You can't win with those folks, so it's better to do the right thing and explain yourself, in my opinion."
692,"And people, including this article’s authors, aren’t good as assessing it, either."
693,Nobody is saying vaccinated people won’t eventually return to normal!
694,"The public health plan is essentially:

1."
695,"Vaccinate as many people as are willing
2."
696,"Watch case numbers fall to manageable levels
3."
697,"Return to normal life at an acceptable level of risk

The problem is we are in an awkward middle ground where Step 2 is being completely skipped;  people are so impatient for 3 they aren’t waiting for 2 to happen first."
698,"Once 2 happens, 3 will come very rapidly - we can see that happening in Israel and, very soon, the UK as well."
699,"America’s time is probably only 2-4 weeks away, but we aren’t there yet, and we’re seeing one last hurrah of COVID surge while people are skipping the “get vaccinated” and “wait for case numbers to fall” steps."
700,It’s not irrational to continue precautions for a few more weeks in that environment.
701,Because truth.
702,[removed]
703,"I'm pretty certain 1,400 people died yesterday in England..."
704,I was the same.
705,Could move my arm just fine even thought it was sore (soreness diminishing and disappeared by Day3) and just sleepy.
706,I don’t think there is enough data yet to analyze this.
707,"However, many long covid patients have been hospitalized or had severe disease, which we know the vaccines prevent almost completely."
708,But someone told me long wait times only happened with socialist medicine?
709,!
710,Oxygen factory...they attacked a forest?
711,"It's supposed to prevent indoor gatherings, but we're getting close to the month of May and people will soon naturally gather oudoors."
712,I don't see why this curfew is necessary either.
713,"We have one in Quebec and it's tearing through people's trust in the government, and it's really worsening pandemic fatigue."

715,"Ah yeah you used present tense so it sounded like you were still experiencing it, unfortunate that there's no evidence of something so wild sounding!"
716,If you hear of any other *grapefruit* sized injection sites could you send them my way?
717,That's huge!
718,"This Science (meaning these studies) won’t figure out what’s safe for her, we already know what’s safe for her."
719,"And we already know this vaccine falls into that category of things safe for her, what those studies are doing, is making sure that that’s still correct for her age group."
720,"It’s like how when I count the stack of pennies on my desk for the third time, it’s not that I don’t know the number of pennies, it’s just that I’m making triply sure."
721,"I know that might seem pedantic, but objectively it’s actually a large difference."
722,"Hey sure the conspiracy only requires the US government, the Chinese government, the UK government, the North Korean government uh pretty much all the governments, and all the health workers in those countries and uh the newspapers who report the obituaries and all the doctors and nurses and uh ....."
723,I'm sure they are all in on it together.
724,"I’m at my job, tired AF, and I thought it said vacation."
725,Ok anti-vaxxer.
726,"I'm really scared for India, and honestly am surprised it took this long to get to this point over there."
727,Just got my second Moderna vaccine.
728,Not looking forward to the side effects.
729,"But, I’m sure they will be better than covid."
730,Well at least Johnson Johnson is not going down without a fight
731,I got my second a week ago and had no symptoms.
732,"My friend got his second the same day from the same LOT# even, and had bad symptoms for 48 hours."
733,Who knows?
734,Still better than getting Covid!
735,I would say 8/10 people I know felt nothing significant after the 2nd shot besides arm pain.
736,It all depends on your level of health and genetics.
737,Yeah that’s roughly what they are saying but it really feels like they are dragging this shit on.
738,Surely there is a faster way to get them distributed.
739,I did find it interesting how the 2 mRNA candidates weren't even separated in that study (and most of the newest studies coming out).
740,Given their similarities it seems very improbable that T cell responses would be so different.
741,In any case as a lay person it's interesting to me that AZ seems to produce a superior T cell response yet seems to be less effective against variants than the mRNA vaccines.
742,All of this just makes me question the importance of a strong CD8+ response if vaccines look to be extremely effective without it.
743,I don't know the specifics.
744,Maybe you can name all the countries that had stricter and longer lockdowns.
745,"My guess is that your list would be short, which would prove my point."
746,People in positions of power or seek those positions because they need to remake the world into their own image.
747,If they can’t make you jump when they yell jump it frustrates them because it negates their power.
748,This doesn’t just apply to governments but also to religions or some people need someone to follow in some people need someone to give them orders.
749,[deleted]
750,You’re right that we don’t know whether or not exposure to COVID will cause long term harm to children.
751,"On the other hand, we do have decades of data about [the extensive and permanent harm prolonged learning loss does to children."
752,"](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-students-left-behind-by-remote-learning)

Seems to me that known harm should outweigh unknown harm."
753,"Yeah I'm in Ontario, 30, and not expecting my first shot until September based on the plans they've laid out."
754,Unless there's some kind of update I've missed.
755,Edit: it seems it says July now which is nice.
756,I’m firmly neutral.
757,The political process does what it does; I’m not out there advocating any position and ask nothing of no one.
758,"I’ve been living my life following the new rules and when it becomes an inconvenience, I’ll get the shot."
759,It’s not mandatory so I’m ambivalent about it because I really don’t leave the house much anyways and see very little risk to me or my family at the moment.
760,Wearing seat belts is a lot less intrusive and impactful than the mitigation restrictions to lessen Covid.
761,It's not a fair comparison.
762,"Yeah, it really does sound like a preemptive messaging to prepare for the inevitable P1 spread."
763,Where are you that the key metrics have not improved over the last month?
764,"Texas reopened over a month ago, and hospitalization have dropped ever since."
765,"Mask usage inside stores is very high within the major cities, and fairly low in other areas."
766,I didn't realize the trend in Texas wasn't part of a national trend.
767,I thought it would have been worse than other states because of low mask usage.
768,https://www.cbs7.com/2021/04/07/nearly-4-weeks-after-reopening-texas-covid-hospitalizations-continue-to-drop/
769,I thought challenge studies were ethically frowned upon if not outright forbidden
770,This post appears to be about vaccines.

774,TLDR: eligible doesn't mean available
775,The states make it possible.
776,If Texas wanted to it could have banned vaccines.
777,A buddy of mine said he was going to wait as long as possible so he has deniability when his company tries to get him to come back into the office.
778,"Once it’s fully FDA authorized later this year, I’m guessing all schools and universities will mandate it just like every other vaccine, so that will lessen the amount of children and teenagers that don’t get it."
779,"Or you know, that on top of the entire country having been completely locked down for more than a month"

781,I get my second Moderna tomorrow.
782,"5 days after the first one, I got flu-like symptoms, cleared up after a couple days, and then again 2 weeks later."
783,I'm curious to know if this is going to be worse or if there's barely a reaction (other person in the household had far fewer side effects the second round).
784,Immune systems are weird.
785,How easy is it to get them in Europe?
786,July 4th is the lit celebration I'm shooting for with my family.
787,I’m trying to figure out the same thing.
788,I recently got my first Moderna shot and felt absolutely terrible.
789,"But I can’t find anything on if the second shot is gonna be worse, about the same, or perhaps even better."
790,I’ll circle back if I learn anything.
791,"Also, for context, I did have COVID previously."
792,"I think I would look for the fatality rate of a disease before deciding whether it is a ""death sentence"" or not."
793,What is the fatality rate of COVID-19?
794,2%?
795,"If 98/100 survive a ""death sentence,"" it isn't a death sentence."
796,My uncle died of COVID-19.
797,I have some POTS-like symptoms five months after having COVID.
798,The pandemic is serious and real.
799,But that's not a green light to say something is a death sentence when it certainly isn't.
800,MI has been open for everyone for a couple of weeks now.
801,Some counties opened earlier than that
802,I think the EUA will be seen as a technicality given the amount of data behind testing and the massive amount of data from millions of vaccinations just in the US.
803,The reason for the EUA was the urgency of a crises situation.
804,There is more than enough data to support requiring these vaccines.
805,"A contrast would be an EUA  for a promising drug to treat a rare,but urgent condition."
806,There wouldn’t be sufficient data to justify requiring that treatment because the data would still be very low level.
807,I think the colleges will win against any law suit brought against them by private parties or governments.
808,Why Argentina?
809,"The FFP2 Masks have a higher filtration efficiency, which makes it harder to breath through."
810,They do protect you.
811,The science is very clear on that.
812,NHTSA website.
813,There is approximately 1 fatality for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled.

815,"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/)

I'm confused."
816,The above link is a study about how the masks don't work.
817,"For the record, I started wearing masks the second the surgeon general recommend we start wearing them."
818,I got the vaccine as soon as it was available for me.
819,So I'm not here to argue that COVID is fake.
820,But I do believe in following what science says.
821,And the above study shows that masks aren't effective.
822,"I have not been looking for articles that say they ARE effective, but I've been presented this study and looking for someone to walk me through this science."
823,Please help?
824,And we’re viewing Texas as some genius state that clearly respects guidelines if there are any?
825,Yeah idk about that one chief.
826,People were upset when Texas said they’d remove restrictions and it hasn’t changed anything.
827,"Obviously it takes time but contagion of the virus means it would be spreading within only a few days, meaning that even now, we should be seeing a departure from the current trends by now if the event had any effect on cases."
828,It hasn’t.
829,"Like I said, I think if we wait another week, we won’t be seeing any changes in current, declining trends"
830,Wrong person.
831,But I also think that we should be taking vaccines when possible by force from other countries.
832,We should probably be trying to intercept vaccines in transit from Europe and India too.
833,I had crazy ones from my first moderna last week.
834,I had gastrointestinal issues high fever and my arm swelled up with a massive red lump.
835,I still have the lump 9 days later but it’s not red I can feel it when I touch the spot
836,"Yes, the variant from Brazil is something like 20% of all covid cases."
837,I am doing my best to control the voice in my head but the same people who get the vaccine are the same people to vote.
838,Count me out but check.the numbers when it is all said and done.
839,My personal view is i did not vote and will not get the vaccine till they offer it to me at my work place during paid hours.
840,That's in the Australian airports.
841,Australia has a mask mandate for them.
842,"NZ does not require masks outside of public transport, even at the highest alert levels."
843,"I fly domestically in NZ regularly, you don't need to put on a mask until you board the plane."
844,If people are wearing them incorrectly it's because we so rarely wear them.
845,"It's a made up thing that conservatives are anti-vaxxers/conspiracy theorists 
 Its something reddit has been pushing and it's based off of nothing."
846,Most Americans are not against vaccinations.
847,The ones who are nervous about the Covid vax is because it's new.
848,The ones who actually believe the crazy microchip thing are rare
849,When the roll outs happened they included everyone over the age of 16.
850,"Meaning the percentages of the new people vaccinated should average out between all ages that weren't eligible before, yet the percentage of the 18-29 crowd is still lower than expected."
851,"So now we're back to the original point, where the person I replied to said this could be fixed just by having local pharmacies do the vaccinations, and all I basically said is, ""that's already the case, so it must be something else like that age group might just be more indifferent to it than other groups""."
852,"I'm not being obtuse, you're just misinterpreting a conversation you weren't involved in."
853,"Fauci doesn’t make decisions on that, correct."
854,"But a lot of what he says carries weight with the public, which in turn influences actual decision making with elected officials."
855,"You see that, right?"
856,He spews off interview after interview and his words have actual influence.
857,He pretends to not know that but it’s true.
858,That congressman or senator or whoever the fuck asked him some real questions which he squirmed and squealed trying to answer.
859,"You can call that guy an “idiot” because he doesn’t play for your team or whatever, but at least he’s asking Fauci real questions and not just sucking his balls all day like everyone else."
860,The underreporting in India and Mexico is shocking
861,Dude the vaccine was chill.
862,Just move your arm around a little after the shot and you’ll be good.
863,"Worst that happened was some arm soreness, like after a good workout."
864,The Patriot Act was also seen as a temporary law at the time it was instituted.
865,When is that getting repealed?
866,It’s impressive given the obstacles they have to overcome.
867,I’m impressed by vaccinating remote people in the Himalayas because it’s a logistical nightmare.
868,These are people that could have been left behind for years.
869,I’m also impressed at the very high level of adults complying with taking the vaccine compared to other countries.
870,It’s supposed to be a positive example of a “can do” attitude.
871,"I don’t know why it’s should be seen as a slight against larger, wealthier countries’ response."
872,"It's horrible, isn't it?"
873,"Where I live they barely wore them in the first place, and screamed about it when they had to."
874,"I had to work around them, and am totally thankful to be alive after this past winter."
875,"Unfortunately no, in my country there is a slow rollout of vaccines so they didn't get to me in time."
876,I'm still waiting to get my shot.
877,To be fair im in PHX and i drove an hour to get mine.
878,Not a big deal honestly considering im up against 7+ million other people.
879,Ill happily drive an hour for the vaccine.
880,Thank you!
881,Jimbo is not famous for his intellect.
882,"well its easier when the only the vaccinated survive...but in all honesty, they've had a longer time to get through the line."
883,"Right now the bottle neck in many populated areas isn't a lack of vaccine or demand, its the lack qualified individuals to administer it."
884,Getting mine tomorrow!
885,🥳
886,"Well 100 needs to become 200, 400, 800, 1600, etc etc."
887,That takes a lot of time.
888,"Big outbreaks like the ones that make headlines usually happen because of community-wide decisions, not because of a single event."
889,"Also, Texas is still experiencing seasonal advantages that may not be around in a few months."
890,"You can expect pretty much everywhere to have one big final wave of cases once a bunch of anti-vaxxers start going back to church/etc, and Texas will be a part of that."
891,Probably not just from a baseball game.
892,"When parks are overly crowded from people who are desperate to get out from pandemic isolation, you bet your ass they should be wearing masks."
893,Just because you're in the middle of the woods on a trail doesn't mean you're safe if there are tons of people there too.
894,"If you're completely alone and isolated, sure whatever, but I've seen some crowded mountains lately."
895,"Officaly yeah, but almost no one do that"
896,Why would you charge them a multiple of the cost?
897,When americans cross the border to get insulin for 10$ / 3 months supply in canada; canada doesn't jack up the prices to american levels for americans...
898,7 day rolling average for first shots has been on a bit of a decline recently.
899,Looks like we're reaching the inflection point where low demand starts to slow us down.
900,&gt;I think the past year has given me something akin to PTSD.
901,I think you're absolutely right.
902,The probability of getting hospitalized after vaccination is only about three times as likely as being struck by a thunderbolt in a given year.
903,"If that possibility isn't concerning to you, this shouldn't be either."
904,I'm happy you're acknowledging the possibility that this could be a mental thing and I hope you can move past it.
905,[removed]
906,Clearly boomers and gen x failed to raise kids that would feel any sense of obligation to the community.
907,I can’t imagine being such an entitled and selfish twit that I would have needed some kind of incentive beyond not spreading a horrible virus that kills people.
908,It’s embarrassing and anyone who parented one of these adult children should be deeply ashamed.
909,Pathetic that so many continue to enable this me-first culture by making excuses for them.
910,"I wear a mask if i am not in my home, full stop."
911,There is basically no good reason not to mask up at all times in public.
912,"Plus, why pass up an opportunity to obscure your face?"
913,"There are plenty of non-death risks for young healthy people:

* Permanent or indefinite loss of the senses of smell and taste
* Permanent or indefinite organ damage
* Permanent or indefinite male infertility
* ..."
914,That's my big worry.
915,Pretty sure my customers will do this.
916,As much as this sub would jump me for it I've stopped wearing mine in low-traffic places like running into the gas station or into a low-traffic downtown shop that doesn't ask me to because being fully vaccinated with Moderna the material risk is basically null.
917,I'm waiting for some give on the CDCs side before I stop masking in large stores or the mall and it seems like we're on the verge of them finally cutting vaccinated people totally loose judging by these latest comments from Fauci
918,I tell you what you wtf  you can.
919,Dont worry if this true or not.
920,If you can do it and breath well.
921,DO IT.
922,I xant bring back the ppl I lost.
923,So it hits me different seeing ppl not Care at all
924,I had my 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday.
925,No I’ll effects whatsoever.
926,Same for the first shot.
927,"I waited for 15 minutes after the first one, so that took about 20 minutes."
928,The second one I was in and out in 5 minutes.
929,It’s ridiculously easy!
930,[deleted]
931,Agreed!
932,These have got to be bots/trolls.
933,Thankfully in my everyday interaction with ppl I have yet to come across actual crazies that want to live in masks forever!
934,Certain odds I just chalk up to fate.
935,Like if you drive there are certain odds you'll crash and die.
936,But they are so high that you can't live your life avoiding such activities.

938,This post appears to be about vaccines.

941,*
942,"Health Pope is a mistake, but it feels good to have a voice you can trust during a chaotic event like this."
943,"Although I do a little adjustment when I hear something he says for ""This is a very cautious take."""
944,It makes me so angry reading the bs people write on Facebook regarding the vaccine.
945,Idiots everywhere
946,Same here.
947,It was a rough 48 hours but totally worth it.
948,You can’t vaccinate me that easily.
949,Try harder
950,I don't understand why you got downvoted.
951,"Patience is in short supply in the US, I guess."
952,Just need more people vaccinated and then it won't be long.
953,"I do think the CDC should work toward establishing metrics that would indicate a return to normality, but I never said those exact metrics were simple."
954,"When I say it’s not complicated, I mean it’s not that complicated to understand that we’re still averaging like 70k new cases/day and it’s only tomorrow, April 19, that all adults nationwide become eligible to receive the vaccine."
955,"That means we’re not quite out of the woods yet, despite things definitely heading in the right direction."
956,"The risk of transmission from a vaccinated person to an unvaccinated person is low, but not zero, and it will still be a few more weeks before everyone has had a chance to get both doses of the vaccine, and cases are still plateaued at a fairly high number."
957,And I think most adults understand why the CDC would be hesitant to give a hard metric on such a novel and dynamic situation.
958,When was the last time we vaccinated hundreds of millions of Americans for a novel coronavirus that killed over a half million people in our country?
959,Never.
960,There is ambiguity in this situation and most people understand that.
961,"That said, my main point is that I’m not convinced that the messaging from the CDC is actually what’s driving reluctance to take the vaccine."
962,"Vaccine reluctance is seriously concentrated in certain demographics—mainly conservatives, and conservative men in particular."
963,I don’t think this is because conservatives are literally incapable of understanding the nuances of what I described above.
964,It’s because conservative media willfully undermines trust in the vaccines and in public health officials.
965,"They play dumb, pretend like they don’t understand nuance, and suggest that public health officials are ill-intentioned."
966,"Agreed, and unfortunately we all paid a price for that, because there was no longer any room for credible or science based criticism of our approach."
967,On 60 minutes the antidepressant they said worked for Covid was fluvoxamine (similar name but different drug).
968,"They had really great data and from my limited understanding I think antidepressants are generally safe drugs, but I kept thinking, by the time it is approved, the pandemic will be nearly over ..."
969,"I mean if I got Covid today, I don't think anyone would give me this drug."
970,I was drowsy as fuck for 2 days.
971,I got 2nd shot this week.
972,let see.
973,I think the issue is that it's an extremely high stakes decision and if you get it wrong you kill thousands of people.
974,"It's very easy for me to say ""vaccines probably reduce transmission a lot"" on reddit but that shouldn't be used as public policy until we have very very strong evidence."
975,"I'm in Michigan, and the mask mandates need to stay until vaccines have been on a walk-in availability for at least a month or two (i.e."
976,long enough for the people who get them to reach full immunity).
977,"It would be nice if it stayed long enough for this surge to abate, but most of the communities suffering through it are already ignoring the mask mandates anyway, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
978,"&gt;The “we just don’t know” excuse just sounds like absolute bullshit at this point

But why?"
979,What is the motive for bullshitting here?
980,"That, more than anything else, is what I don't get about criticisms like this."
981,"What would Biden, Fauci, and the CDC have to gain by secretly plotting to keep us masked and social-distanced forever?"
982,"Even just from a purely cynical, selfish, political standpoint, wouldn't they want to be the ones to say ""OK, everybody, we did it!"
983,"It's safe to go out without masks now!"""
984,"Oh yeah, that's fine."
985,I'm talking about the reasons they don't bother getting vaccinated.
986,Hopefully this will be loosely representative of the rest of the population... Can't imagine it'll be as high for the less at risk population but its definitely promising!
987,There is a stomach bug going around I had it Friday as well.
988,It’s was a brutal 24 hours.
989,I slept 12 hours day of and was super out of it the next day.
990,"Drink lots of water, take a nice hot shower and go to bed, you’ll be fine :)"
991,You're being kind of weirdly obtuse.
992,"Dates have varied across the country, but it is consistent almost everywhere that younger people have had fewer total appointments available to them than older people."
993,"The size of that differential varies, but it is positive everywhere and thus pretty obviously explains the trends you're observing in vaccination rates."
994,"It turns out that if you design a vaccine rollout to prioritize individuals who are at greater risk to a virus that disproportionality effects the elderly, it results in younger people getting the vaccine later on average."
995,"I'm not quite sue why that is surprising, or makes you think there is something to read into this."
996,"Absolutely, and I wish they would pay more attention to the scientists than those mouthpieces who have no background in science or medicine."
997,[deleted]
998,Hasn’t everyone been saying that cases show up between 2-14 days?
999,Wait another week.
1000,Nothing will change I guarantee it.
1001,One event is enough.
1002,My state never had one but my county does.
1003,It's hardly enforced and really up to the businesses themselves.
1004,I'm fine with complying when I'm inside for another month to give everyone a chance to get fully vaccinated.
1005,Agreed.
1006,Trump was a terrible fit as president.
1007,"I still have a serious grudge against him for his presidency, especially this awful pandemic."
1008,I got the vaccine because my pharmacist told me she was going to throw it away anyway since her appointment canceled.
1009,"I was there for allergy medicine at first, but she made it seem like such a waste that I might as well take it since its right there."
1010,Either in my arm or in the trashcan.
1011,"It worked out pretty good, I got to skip the wait list appointment scheduling stuff I hate keeping up with."
1012,"It was just a sweet simple, ""you want it?"""
1013,"Me: ""sure why not."""
1014,Sounds similar to what my SO and I experienced with J&amp;J.
1015,"A few hours after, we felt great and went for a walk."
1016,"About 7 hours in, the chills hit us hard."
1017,Everything ached.
1018,Didn’t leave the bed for most of the following day.
1019,"By days 2-3, we were nearly back to normal."
1020,I think personally it's the people who would of really suffered without vaccine.
1021,"I think it hits hardest on those weakest to covid, but unlike full virus  it's less severe with vaccine and no death."
1022,"Uh, one large-scale outdoor event in a state with pretty low cases to begin with does not a ""no excuses"" take make."
1023,And it's not even been two weeks.
1024,"If a hundred people caught covid at the first game, it would take a couple months to multiply into an actual visible blip."
1025,Nobody believes that covid is so good at spreading that you'd suddenly see thousands of cases pop up all on the same week because of a ball game.
1026,"This is pretty desperate, man."
1027,"The whole ""permanent"" thing feels VERY, VERY much like it's just caution."
1028,Of course they'll end it after they're sure it's safe.
1029,Awww!
1030,When was wedding?
1031,Congrats!
1032,I skipped my step-son's wedding in November.
1033,It was a last minute decision but husband said I wouldn't have been comfortable with mask usage at rehearsal.
1034,One of us had to stay safe to take care of my Dad &amp; MIL.
1035,I made the difficult decision to skip it.
1036,We spent 2 weeks in separate parts of the house since someone tested positive 2 days after wedding.
1037,People will get there.
1038,The best thing you can do is lead by example.
1039,Enjoy life &amp; especially your time as a newlywed!
1040,I really think the US could end up messing this all up.
1041,European governments including the UK are all going to keep up testing even after everyone is vaccinated to keep track of any breakthrough cases and new variants.
1042,But the narrative in America and somewhat here as well except our governments aren't following it is that vaccines competely end the pandemic and we never have to think about it again.
1043,"The average person will no longer have to change their behaviour, but there still needs to be constant monitoring."
1044,Not a single low risk person under 55 has had one because there’s no shots to give out in Canada!
1045,"My god, they are spacing out doses to those who can get them by what, 3 months just so they can get 1 into more people?"
1046,"Yeah, I'm in Seattle, we have high demand in the city &amp; surrounding suburbs but drive 40 miles in any direction its wide open."
1047,"The states case counts have doubled, 649 7 day average on 3/22/2021 to 1274 7 day average yesterday 4/17/2021"
1048,"Tbh, I think the US should be thinking real hard about vaccine diplomacy now because China is winning that game in Latin America."
1049,"No idea about Africa, but I presume they're doing the same."
1050,Too premature.
1051,I would rather wait until we know for sure this is truly over.

1053,See arrogance..  pffft.
1054,"I knew they had to cover C-19, but are you sure they can’t charge unvaccinated people more for coverage?"
1055,"If it mutates ""past the vaccine"" it is highly likely to have mutated enough that it can no longer infect human cells."
1056,I thought that they released that one had asthma and 3 were considered overweight/obese?
1057,Those are considered complicating factors for COVID.
1058,In my county 16+ is open

1061,"&gt; He doesn't deserve credit after allowing 560,000 Americans die

Didn't say he did"
1062,The actual scientific observations on Pfizer -- as opposed to anecdotes from Facebook -- suggest it is an extremely safe vaccine.
1063,Your anxiety is getting the better of you.
1064,"&gt;Honestly I feel like conservative pundits/media/politicians are just playing dumb when they suggest to their audience that Fauci wants masks for

Plus, this IS Fox News as an article."
1065,I cannot trust them.
1066,Does anyone have any information on the variants in India and how likely the Pfizer/moderna/J&amp;J vaccine fairs against it?
1067,What's your logic here?
1068,You aren't getting the vaccine because you don't want to go out?
1069,I'm another person in that age group who's gotten my first shot.

1082,It’s not exactly affordable but with covid tests costing €80-€120 a pop I’ll be saving a crap ton of money this summer when I don’t need to do them anymore
1083,Yes.

1089,Doesn't it make sense to have a permanent legal framework for certain public health measures though?
1090,Not to be too doom and gloom here but Covid isn't the first pandemic and it won't be the last.
1091,I'm usually quite libertarian when it comes to granting the state power but the cost-benefit of mask mandates and social distancing seems pretty benign to me.
1092,I don't really see a tyrannical government *abusing* these powers because they can only hurt the economy and the ability of the government to get things done.
1093,"Unless it's actually needed, it doesn't achieve anything, it just inconveniences everyone."
1094,"It's not like for example, full on lockdowns, nanny state surveillance, welding people in their homes and such."
1095,It's more like seatbelt laws.
1096,"The executive order allowing the state health department to overrule counties is expiring, and the legislature isn't going to extend it."
1097,"Colorado is more bipartisan than most states, and it makes for a lot of compromises or angst."
1098,Without enforcing a means to prove vaccination then this will only lead to everyone going maskless regardless of if they are vaccinated or not.
1099,Those who are not getting vaccinated are often times the same people who reluctantly mask or don’t mask at all.
1100,They will just stop even pretending to give a shit.

1350,I think a pause of a few days was critically important to convey that even a few unexpected complications are being taken very seriously.
1351,It was necessary to retain trust in the system.
1352,"It gives them the ability to say ""Everyone's who's administrating these shots is now informing their patients to watch for these extremely rare blood-clot symptoms that they may require further medical attention, and doctors across the country have been advised how to treat it."""

1416,The entire time I read this I was trying to figure out what obscure and roundabout Game of Thrones joke you were trying to make.
1417,"About 130,000 Norwegians have had at least one injection of the AstraZeneca vaccine."
1418,"The jab has mainly been given to healthcare workers, meaning that 78% are women, mostly belonging to the younger part of the population."
1419,"About 1 out of 25,000 have suffered from the severe and rare thromboembolic condition."
1420,"Based on that data, suspending seems prudent."
1421,I did that why I added it.
1422,Life is not with out risk.
1423,There is no way to create a bubble of no risk.
1424,Outdoors is significantly safer.
1425,And no I didn’t mean there was no transmission outdoors.
1426,Realize that the vast majority in the study were likely 65+ with underlying condition just simply based on the timing of the study.
1427,The CFR will change significantly in the coming months.
1428,"Also, don’t undermine the simple fact of far far far fewer people becoming ill after vaccination."
1429,Those numbers were framed to incite fear.
1430,It would be difficult to become ill even if you tried.
1431,Their vaccine is likely good enough to keep control of an out breaks like the flu vaccine do.
1432,That’s what’s important isn’t it?
1433,That's similar to my reaction to the J&amp;J one.
1434,9 hours in severe headache and chills.

1442,"And just like the OP said above, this isn’t a mask debate, I’ve been pro-mask for most of the pandemic, but a return to normalcy should include lifting mask mandates."

1475,Well the people I know whom I know who got Pfizer are more 40 and up!
1476,I’m sorry you got wrecked.
1477,I hope you are felling better now!
1478,"Yeah, my fiancé had no reaction to the second Pfizer shot besides a sore arm."
1479,Everyone is different.
1480,"To add to the other response, everyone should still get it to reduce spread which helps prevent the rise of additional strains and protects those that for whatever reason cannot get the vaccine."
1481,It makes sense.
1482,"You body thinks it's seeing a massive dose of SARS-COV-2,  so it ramps up the defenses it already has."
1483,That's why people who haven't had COVID-19 have that reaction to to second dose.
1484,"Oddly, I've read a many people saying that if they had COVID-19 already, dose 1 was ""bad"" but dose 2 was like most people's dose 1."
1485,"My guess is the body already has so many antibodies it fights the ""infection"" without needing to ramp up the defenses."

1513,"And Canada has a higher population than Michigan, by about 3.8 times (38 million vs 10 million) making it even more significant/odd that Michigan is seeing more total numbers for new cases and deaths each day than the entire country of Canada."

1518,For several days they opened up a J&amp;J clinic on the speedway which I think enticed a lot of people as I suppose it was a convenient and quirky thing to do!
1519,I had Pfizer and no side effects at all (not bragging just saying it is possible).
1520,Do you think it’s possible you had Covid at some point?
1521,"From what I’m hearing, a reaction to the first shot is a good indicator of having had Covid."
1522,"It is what it is, my dude."
1523,"A proud cesspit, full of immigrants and noveau riche, of great art and graffiti, of kale and al pastor."
1524,A great city!
1525,Not to mention the constant bombardment that even after vaccination you still need to mask and distance.
1526,"Frankly, the only real case to be made for young people getting the vaccine right now is if you want to travel internationally because nothing is going to change domestically after you've vaccinated."
1527,"It doesn't get repeated enough, they exported doses to a country on the other side of the world that had not recorded any covid19 death in months while people were dying by the thousands just over the Channel."
1528,This is so utterly despicable.
1529,UK is doing alright.
1530,"USA has already passed UK shots per 100 people, but the UK has already largely suppressed COVID due to its first dose first policy."
1531,Also USA is on the verge of a surplus.
1532,I think we probably get 60% of total population covered eventually.
1533,Despite the fact we are only at 33% total coverage I think weekly demand is likely to drop soon as we finish up with first doses and we have to start convincing vaccine hesitant people.
1534,"Damn, I had the second pfizer dose yesterday around 1 pm."
1535,I stayed up til 1 am and i felt fine except for my arm was sore as hell.
1536,When I got up to go to bed I started feeling the chills.
1537,I was like okay here we go.
1538,I laid down in bed and the chills went away after five minutes or so.
1539,Just a real sore arm ever since.
1540,Sleep was rough last night as I couldn't put weight on that arm and it also still hurts like hell.
1541,"Tbh wherever you are in the US, there is pretty a specific subreddit for your state regarding covid."
1542,I would check there as my state’s Reddit drops apt all the time
1543,Well I mean death from Covid is a pretty long term health effect.
1544,Ayyy fuck the Cubbies 😂
1545,I have a low platelet count.
1546,Do you think that I should take AZ or wait a couple of weeks?
1547,Everyone is not going to have a chance to get vaccinated for a very long time though.
1548,You are excluding 0-15 year olds which is a LOT of people.
1549,When we hit some date in June there will still be spread and tons of people refusing the vaccine so the kids are really the ones who get screwed by anti vaxxers once all the masks come off.
1550,"Yes, they may not die, but it's still not good to be infected."
1551,Moderna's second shot is kicking my ass.
1552,"I expected it as a 20something woman with autoimmune issues and a generally strong immune system, but sheesh."
1553,"I got my shot at 145 pm on Saturday, felt wiped out 2 hours later, and the aches and fever hit me like a truck around 10 hours post shot."
1554,Today fever is hovering around 100-100.5 and everything hurts but still - so worth it.
1555,I can't wait to feel peace of mind.
1556,If you're eligible and haven't scheduled your shot now is the time to do it!
1557,"Side effects suck but not everyone gets them and even if you do, it's a sliver of what covid could do, to you or whoever it could be passed on to."
1558,Florida allowed me to stay employed so I ain’t mad about it.
1559,I bet everyone who lost their job in lockdown counties wishes they were in FL.
1560,"We don’t talk about that, and you shouldn’t either."
1561,"Besides, who needs math when we got fear galore"
1562,I proved you wrong multiples times now.
1563,What are you referring to?
1564,Second dose on Thursday!!!
1565,I friggin hate needles but have pushed myself to do it becaus that's what you do.
1566,Moderna second shot effects hit me 26 hours later.
1567,Got chills and went to sleep for a few hours.
1568,Next day arm was very sore.
1569,Day after everything was fine.
1570,Now I’m wondering if the booster becomes necessary if it’s going to do the same thing or worse.
1571,I have got two
1572,Sure they are.
1573,"Florida no lockdowns, minimal restrictions, people still pulling back on spending."
1574,People aren’t going to blow money during a pandemic.
1575,Note that savings rates across the country skyrocketed.
1576,"&gt; That’s still 40% of adult population
   
[50% of adult population](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)"
1577,Oh I am down voted.
1578,The virus won't spread anymore eh?
1579,If only that were true.
1580,Then I would happily take as many down votes as possible.
1581,I’m just gonna go back to reading headlines only.
1582,A lot more concerning to find that these people were positive a whopping 45 days before vaccination and were still well enough to make it to the vaccination site and THEN die.
1583,[deleted]
1584,That’s still 40% of adult population.. there are still about 35% population that’s going to be very difficult to get vaccinated ..
1585,But Brazil reported a 50% effectiveness rate.
1586,Other countries reported a huge range of numbers with one apparently going as high as 84%... given that gigantic range I’d say we have no idea how effective Sinovac is and frankly that’s a big problem.
1587,I said show definitive proof there is no spread outdoors.
1588,I already said there is low risk outdoors.
1589,And I will name call if people make stupid counter arguments.
1590,Plenty of people who think risk is low or this won't affect me and spread that misinformation to others.
1591,Lives and jobs have been ruined thanks to people not taking this seriously.
1592,And indoors is indeed a greater risk.
1593,You take a risk everytime you go in a public place to eat or drink indoors.
1594,However they try and keep you socially distanced.
1595,Even in Florida.
1596,"However there is a greater element of risk in non socially distanced, non mask wearing people in large numbers outdoors than there is well socially distanced people eating indoors taking their mask off for brief periods."
1597,And you still think that its dangerous.
1598,"Let me guess, you buy into the notion that China owns most of our debt?"
1599,It doesn’t matter
1600,"Yes, that's fine."
1601,Just don't take it before your shot.
1602,"I live in Pennsylvania, so the answer to that is a yes."
1603,Most definitely.
1604,"Where I live, at the height of the pandemic, they were carrying on like it was on big party."
1605,"No masks, no social distancing, nothing."
1606,Starring Dwayne Johnson.
1607,Tell that to Brazil and the 50% rate they reported for Sinovac.
1608,Ah shit I better not screw up my last chance
1609,I also had the same experience with J&amp;J
1610,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483
1611,You said that the Sinovac vaccine has results ranging from 50% all the way up to 84%.
1612,Those aren’t the sort of numbers that are acceptable.
1613,How could they be?
1614,Throwing out some unsubstantiated “what about-ism” with AstraZeneca doesn’t mitigate that in the slightest.
1615,I can’t find the original Chinese language version of what the Director said but if you want to provide it (because you say he did not say what was reported so I assume you have access to it) I’d be happy to translate it myself and we can see.
1616,Only thing I can find backing up what you say is in the Global Times and that’s nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for the CCP.
1617,[removed]
1618,I only took Fluoxetine one time.
1619,It gave me very very hard stomach ache.

1629,I could not find it.
1630,"I find it hard to believe there hasn’t been a dip based on all the articles saying many states have stopped pushing tests as they shift to the vaccination programs, coupled with state relaxations in mandatory testing for people who travel out of state or for students in classes where a classmate is exposed to Covid."
1631,Some of the young people without them now just don’t want to put in effort to get a shot.
1632,Make them easily available at a local pharmacy and they’ll do it.
1633,My parents gotten second dose of modern and felt nothing.
1634,I just gotten my second dose of pfizer.
1635,I think people that have severe side effects more likely to post regarding it
1636,"I wonder if in the next couple months North America and Europe will be viewed as having ""won"" the pandemic and then Australia, despite handling it brilliantly, will be seen as doing terribly."
1637,"It wouldn't really be fair, but I can imagine the narrative going that way."
1638,This was obvious based on case studies from over a year ago.
1639,Lol this is so ridiculous
1640,I get my second Moderna shot on Wednesday.
1641,Is it ok to take Tylenol/acetaminophen for side effects?
1642,Not sure if that will affect the immune response or not.
1643,"Here in Alabama, you're admitting to being a Democrat if you get a vaccine."
1644,I know people who are keeping the fact that they got it a secret because their family and friends might disown them.
1645,Got my first Pfizer dose today!🥳
1646,Same except with J&amp;J.
1647,Around 12 hours post I was in rough shape.
1648,Took me a day or two to recover from that first night.
1649,Wasn’t 100% until about 5 days.
1650,It sucked but I’m glad to have gotten the vaccine
1651,"wow, game changer, but now there is tons of n95 k95 available to buy vs last year"

1657,I have been trying to ask this question as well.
1658,"My plan was to get it around summertime, in my hometown, near my doctor and family."
1659,I had a health issue years ago and I’d just feel more comfortable doing a check-up with that specific doctor before getting the vaccine.
1660,No big deal in my opinion but NOPE.
1661,I am getting shit left and right for not doing it NOW.
1662,"I wear my mask, carry my sanitizer and get tested."
1663,Can some explain what the problem is?
1664,Depends on the state.
1665,"CT switched to an only age based system, and it actually sped up shots, thus helping those on the front lines get theirs quickly."
1666,"Not the full province yet, just some areas."
1667,"I'm not entirely sure, but I do know that the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine is a different technology than the J&amp;J one."
1668,Average redditor
1669,Not long?
1670,How soon after Nov 5th were restrictions completely lifted?
1671,"I did yes, I got it early on at a state run site so they didnt even have the vials in the same room unfortunately."
1672,Some kids in my city are in school over the summer.
1673,Year round school is a thing.
1674,No idea.
1675,"Nobody wears a mask in restaurants except when they get up to go the bathroom, which I think is hilarious."
1676,A lot of the rules don't fit together or make all that much sense.
1677,"These moderate capacity half measures aren't designed to be in place for all that long, so they're not always the most well thought out."
1678,Does anyone know if minors need a parent/guardian present when they get their vaccine?
1679,"(Pa, USA)."
1680,Single day reporting isn't very relevant.
1681,"The seven day average is a little over 67,000 cases a day, and a little over 750 deaths a day."
1682,I wish we were averaging 310 deaths a day!
1683,I'll be there in three days!
1684,Lockdown 2 which was in no way strict or long.
1685,"Seriously just stop, you know very little about what you’re talking about and apparently don’t have the humility to admit it as shown by you ignoring my reply to your question to then use the wrong date."
1686,Thank you for elaborating!
1687,"Considering how on top of the vaccine rollout you guys have been, I would have expected the easing of restrictions to happen sooner."
1688,Sorry to hear that you've had to deal with so many restrictions!
1689,"I'm in Texas, so we've been on the complete opposite end of the spectrum."
1690,Plenty of people also aren't happy that we aren't taking it seriously enough.
1691,Seems like a lose-lose situation for all.
1692,"I've made it work for me though and have done okay, but it's a shit situation all around."
1693,"Got my second dose two days ago, so feeling pretty elated at the moment!"
1694,"Not a slogan, but it’s basically a catch phrase of his.."
1695,"Ok, and?"
1696,How does that change the fact that I can't access the vaccine because of the sudden openness and skipping the high risk phase?
1697,Imagine making life or death decisions based on whether or not you want to work in the office or not.
1698,It's in the paperwork people are handed to sign when they get vaccinated.
1699,"""Have you recently been diagnosed with Covid?"""
1700,It's right there.
1701,I'm in FL and I was able to schedule for a Pfizer for yesterday at a CVS about 5 days in advance.
1702,You can schedule weeks ahead too.
1703,"Feeling great one day later (but sore, RIP my Monday workout)."
1704,Take a look online today.

1708,Lol yeah I'm sure it's the Indians who are bringing the virus to Canada.
1709,Nevermind the rampant community spread.
1710,"1.	formed in 7-9 months instead of 7-9 years
2.	literal anecdotes from people who got it such as almost passed out, continual pain, out of commission for an entire day
3.	need 2 shots instead of one
4.	anyone who shows hesitancy is attacked and called nutjob, anti vaxx, you name it."
1711,cult-like shame behaviour.
1712,there is literally nothing wrong with hesitancy.
1713,it's natural.
1714,Wow great news.
1715,"Maybe NY will follow, we're close behind on the vaccine front."
1716,"Do the math:

Nearly 1/3 of people who get covid have long lasting side effects vs 1/1000000 getting a serious complication

Your chances of getting a clot from covid is significantly higher than getting it from the J&amp;J vaccine"
1717,"“If Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it."
1718,"Absolutely,”

Context is important."
1719,It’s crazy that people forget that this time last year he was denying its existence; calling it a liberal hoax.

1721,Meanwhile in Canada you have to wait 4 months for your second shot
1722,"November: lockdown 2, stay-at-home order

December: Tier 4, illegal to meet others indoors etc."
1723,January: lockdown 3 until March 8th and we're still heavily restricted as I've pointed out in literally the last 3 posts above.
1724,mmm yes 6 months of heavy restrictions and government over reach is not long tho!
1725,!11 fuck civil liberties who needs 'em
1726,"Yeah, I'm aware that several countries in Europe have also had long and strict lockdowns."
1727,My point was that the UK (as well as Ireland) is among the strictest and longest in the world.

1747,This user just seems to be in denial as to how strict things are and how long the restrictions have been going on.
1748,[removed]
1749,Agree 100%.
1750,The confusing messaging about effectiveness towards different variants and if the vaccine truly means you can return to normal life is causing people to be hesitant.
1751,The message should be once you get it you can proceed as normal now that the most vulnerable people have probably gotten their shot.
1752,"Yes, people will lie but why do we have to cater to the lowest common dominator."
1753,If the vaccines don't work we are screwed anyway so we might as well open up.
1754,How can you possibly be so brutally obtuse?
1755,"Go get your second dose of vaccine, it's a far greater risk to remain unvaccinated."
1756,Blood clots can occur with or without vaccines.
1757,The point is however that this type of very rare blood clot in combination with low platelets only occurs after vaccination with the vector vaccines and not after vaccination with the mRNA vaccines.
1758,"Exactly, it's a calculated risk."
1759,"I'm also less worried as all the old people around me are fully done already, I was obviously more worried about them."

So yes we have been in and out of lockdown restrictions for ages, idk why this other idiot cannot realize it."

1809,Fauci said it's too dangerous for a fully vaccinated person to dine in a restaurant.
1810,"They produced a lot, it is just that half of vaccine production in the EU is being exported."
1811,The pharmaceutical companies will deliver at least 510 million vaccines by the end of June.
1812,"Considering over half of EU production is being exported, that reaches over 1 billion produced in the EU."

You can drop the attitude and maybe do some of your own research."
1815,If you look into how other SSRIs and then other psychotropics in general work you will find that psychiatrists actually know very little about the mechanism (though they do know a lot).
1816,Psychopharmacology was started because they discovered compounds that appeared to have a mental affect on animals and wanted to try it out on people with apparent disregard for safety or efficacy.
1817,Very different from othet medicines which had a known effect in a known way on a known pathogen or metabolic process in the body.
1818,Pretty sure banning indoor meetings between different households at Christmas was implemented throughout the whole of the UK.
1819,"This time period was right before lockdown 3 and we were in Tier 4 (with very strict rules)  mostly throughout England, which in itself was preceded by lockdown 2 in November a month earlier..."
1820,So yeah we've been in and out of lockdown restrictions for the better part of a year.. lol not so difficult to comprehend
1821,Population density bro.
1822,You are just pretending that's not a thing.
1823,Population density drives outbreaks and the feds decided to vaccinate people in rural areas first because they're dumb.
1824,Obv Ontario has the highest cases per capita because they have the most people in the smallest area.
1825,The government should have prioritized vaccinating the GTA but they vaccinated the rural provinces at the same rate.
1826,Reddit is just a bunch of stupid far left extremists who like to blame everything on the right.

1833,No one knows the exact number needed right now—anyone giving numbers is just giving their best guess at this point.
1834,"You’re saying people don’t trust OHA, but are asking OHA to give a number that would be a guess and could easily be too high or too low through no fault of anyone’s."
1835,Why would it matter to each individual if the number is 70% or 80%?
1836,Are they seriously refusing to get vaxxed unless their vaccine will tip the scale?
1837,That’s like refusing to vote unless you’re guaranteed your candidate will win.
1838,It honestly sounds like they’re just using that as an excuse to be anti-vax without admitting to it.
1839,I’m very sad that they’re willing to continue to put their community at risk both economically and health wise when vaccines would get their lives and businesses back to normal the quickest.
1840,"I've heard both sides of that ""fudging numbers"" story."
1841,"One side says they're over-counting deaths, the other says they're not counting enough."
1842,"But seriously, any break from the ""War of the Worlds"" type rhetoric is encouraging."
1843,You see for everywhere else the vaccines really are the key to life returning to normal.
1844,Bars and restaurants have been closed in most of Europe for months and they won't reopen until the rollout is far along enough and cases have declined.
1845,As far as I can tell that isn't really the case in many parts of the US and masks have been one of the few widespread measures.
1846,"So even if you are someone that has been partying for the last year here, vaccination is still going to make a big difference to you."
1847,"And masks are the absolute last thing that they want to get rid of, since they are so minimal compared to capacity limits or the total closures of industries."
1848,"So as far as I can tell, there aren't enough restrictions in the US to allow for a carrot and stick approach."
1849,Right but you can’t do that for a multitude of reasons that require basic math and thinking skills.
1850,"First, it’s states that run the open/close restrictions so “a percentage” doesn’t make sense when you’re talking in a national context."
1851,"Second, even at the state level the difference in uptake between cities and rural areas is absurd."
1852,Should cities have to wait for the rural areas to take vaccines they’ll never take?
1853,"A better route would be to cut the states into zones and open up zones as the they hit a specific target, however that’s going to enrage the MUH LIBERTIES crowd, but they weren’t going to be helpful anyway."
1854,It’s a tough one with all the ight wing vax refusal.
1855,Do you give them a pass and say “fuck public health” or do you coddle them?
1856,From the CDC's recommendations I believe they would be considered phase 1B frontline essential workers (public transit).
1857,"&gt; exact same protocol as all other student vaccines (MMR, tetanus, etc)

1858,Never heard of that being a thing before.

&gt;  
&gt;**EMILY BRINDLEY** APRIL 19, 2021  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The state plans to move forward in two stages, Lamont announced, both contingent on declining coronavirus metrics and rising vaccination rates."
1895,"&gt;  
&gt;First, on May 1, the state will lift all outdoor restrictions, including allowing bars to operate outdoors without serving food."
1896,"Then, on May 19, the state will do away with the remaining restrictions."
1897,"That means bars will be able to open indoors, event venue and stadium capacity limits will be removed and social distancing requirements will be dropped."
1898,"In addition, gathering restrictions for private events will be eliminated."
1899,"&gt;  
&gt;The one exception is the indoor mask mandate, which will remain in effect."
1900,The state also said that the Department of Public Health will be issuing recommendations for indoor gatherings and large outdoor gatherings.
1901,"&gt;  
&gt;Throughout the pandemic, Lamont has opted to keep bars and night clubs closed, due to concerns that their close quarters could trigger significant COVID-19 spread.The state also still has gathering restrictions in place currently — at private residences, gatherings are capped at 25 people indoors or 100 people outdoors; at commercial venues, gatherings are capped at 100 people indoors or 200 people outdoors."
1902,"&gt;  
&gt;The announcement comes as the state pushes forward with its vaccination effort — about half of Connecticut residents have now received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to The New York Times, placing Connecticut among the top three fastest states for per capita vaccinations."
1903,"&gt;  
&gt;Even so, the state’s cases, hospitalizations and deaths are not as low as they were over the quiet summer months, when the virus seemed to temporarily loosen its hold on Connecticut."
1904,"&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Ulysses Wu, the system director of infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare, said that he understands the impulse to reopen now — and that there are ways to reopen safely."
1905,"&gt;  
&gt;The key to a safe reopening, Wu said, is for residents to continue masking, social distancing and hand washing, even after vaccination."""

1907,"The flu vaccine, quite frankly, sucks."
1908,It's fairly low efficacy even when they guess right on which strain will be prevalent a given year and the virus mutates readily.
1909,The mRNA vaccines are super high efficacy and the coronavirus doesn't mutate nearly as quickly.
1910,"There's a lot of variants now, but none completely evade vaccine immunity."
1911,"Once the infection rate is no longer sky-high, we'll see way fewer variants popping up."
1912,"The booster basically restores full efficacy on the new variants, and if it gets rolled out quickly with low refusal rates we can probably hit full suppression and lower the mutation rate to near zero."
1913,"So, something in-between but closer to Polio or maybe TDAP,  but the more people who refuse the vaccine the closer it'll be to flu."
1914,[removed]
1915,Add to that that Israel is very small with a tiny population.
1916,Pfizer could pump out these doses without really affecting supply to the big powers (US and EU).
1917,"Even if the EU or US would make an Israel style deal, it would have been a lot slower than Israel, because the doses just do not exist and cannot be produced at such a rate."
1918,You love to see it.
1919,Ooh hot girl summer bout to be liiiit:3
1920,Arriving in 2030.

1922,Yes; what I meant was nothing in addition to what was already announced.
1923,But it would not surprise me at all if Pfizer announces that they will increase the deliveries in Q2 with another few millions.
1924,Looks like a continued upward trend to me dawg.
1925,"Yesterday was a sunday, take its numbers with a grain of salt."
1926,Dude learn to comprehend what you are reading
1927,"&gt;This will probably mean nothing for the EU coming months

I disagree, didn\`t they anounce recently that a lot of doses originally planned for September- Oktober will be delivered earlier."
1928,"(50 million by end of June)

Now they simply refill for the end of the year."
1929,Basicly they help out a lot for the AZ fuckup.
1930,"LOL... Just an ultimate one about reality, human beings and their flaws of which I have many, and that yes, Epidemiology is a great field to go into, but remember where it came from if you become one."
1931,"It isn't primarily about knowing in exquisite detail what happened in a human tragedy but a tool for stopping it, now to prevent human tragedy."
1932,Many Epi's seem to forget that... Every Epi should be forced to knock on a door or two and give an individual a death sentence... Then all that population health with millions of people and decadal outcomes becomes a bit more real.
1933,"Remember, there are many who want schools to stay open *so the parents can go to work*."

1938,I never said all.
1939,"If we have to get a covid booster shot every year then we will be living with covid for years, possibly forever."
1940,It would be up to each culture to determine if we want masks to be permanent
1941,"You're right, it's not."
1942,"On the other hand, our federal government has not managed to do what is necessary to support the people hardest hit by policies put in place to mitigate the pandemic, and no matter how you try to slice it, masks are extremely disruptive for the youngest among us."
1943,"People's lives are on the line, but vaccines are available for the most vulnerable."
1944,"On the other hand, people's livelihoods and the right of children to learn are on the line while others have the opportunity to protect themselves as they see fit with KN95's or choosing to seek out a vaccine."
1945,"The hard truth is that we don't physically force people to get vaccinated in this country, so the number needed is the number willing to get it."
1946,"That could be 100%, 70%, 50%, or even 25% -- that's it."
1947,That's the end game.
1948,Right.
1949,"But that's where my fear comes in... that their desperate need for a ""return to normal"" will be greater than their understanding of how the vaccine will make that happen fastest."
1950,Probably.
1951,Makes sense why face coverings in the desert are a thing too.
1952,"Avoid disease, the sun, cold winds, sand etc."
1953,Seems like a smart option.
1954,"Adding to this, Sweden has recently allowed for single women to get sperm donations, driving up demand."
1955,Well thankfully it looks like Michigan has peaked.
1956,"Seems the worst is now behind us there, and vaccinations are too widespread at this point for a meaningful increase anywhere else."
1957,Start the countdown.
1958,"Maybe.. but on the other hand, I think a lot of people are ambivalent about the vaccine but are desperate for a ""return to nromal"" so getting a free shot isn't a huge sacrifice to make."
1959,"At least, I hope so."
1960,And this article doesn't say anything about the opposite being true; the Brown U. expert suggested that the likelihood was for cases to be arriving from outside the schools.

1989,It’s kind of insane that the worst year for some was the best year for others.
1990,Seems pessimistic.
1991,Western Europe will be fully vaxxed by Q4 2021
1992,More likely they will be used to vaccinate kids.
1993,Don't expect boosters before 2022 for people who got AZ/J&amp;J.
1994,"Both sides are frustrated because from the side of ending the pandemic, more people have to get vaccinated."
1995,"I've seen estimates that say that 10-15% of the population should not get it for one reason or another, but about 50% of the population is not getting it."
1996,"That means that unfortunately, everyone who wants the pandemic to end has to work to get people vaccinated by having those uncomfortable discussions."
1997,I have personally had to repeatedly have the discussion about how it doesn't cause cancer.
1998,People hear mRNA and think that means the vaccine is altering their DNA or something like that.
1999,It drives me crazy.
2000,"I'm pretty paranoid about cancer, but in short, to cause cancer something must be mutagenic (cause DNA damage or alter DNA)."
2001,The vaccine and its ingredients do not.
2002,"So now, I'm stuck in this position where when someone says ""I'm not getting it because..."" what the people who want the pandemic to end must do is ask ""Why."""
2003,"It's unfortunate, but we aren't going to reach herd immunity at the current rate, and the spread of misinformation as well as the mutation of current variants means that there is a real risk that the vaccines are rendered useless anyway."
2004,So the conversation must be had if we want the pandemic to end and things to get back to normal.
2005,reality???
2006,can you explain which Europe country exporting vaccine to poor country
2007,Wait until you get symptoms.
2008,I guess they had to be quarantined.
2009,The United States is a massive single country with a lot of people.
2010,It’s necessary to vaccinate the majority of its population to reduce overall spread and to prevent variations from popping up.
2011,It will have plenty to export afterwards
2012,"&gt;~~Normality~~


Normalcy"
2013,And now we enter the phase where we probably discuss like vaccine passes that might be a partial fix to this for a few months.
2014,Say we do a system that is very good at somehow showing businesses that you were actually vaccinated and we run it through the summer banking on the system not being needed in the fall.
2015,Or maybe we just run things as is and make vaccines as easy as walking in to the local drug store again like we did with the flu so there probably won’t even be a reason to run the system as getting sick would then be on you.
2016,"After this past year, I wouldn’t mind the first even though I’m halfway vaccinated, but I feel reality will shift towards the second option, at least in the states."
2017,Vaccines finally got sent out to the main cities in my state that allow for big vaccine events along with all adults in my state finally being able to be vaccinated.
2018,"This can only mean that vaccination is quickly getting to flu levels where you can just walk in to a drug store, get a shot, and move on with your life while also possibly feeling hopeful that others in society you bump in to also got their shot."
2019,The hundreds of people that probably ended up in the thousands this past weekend I stood in line with to get my first vaccine shot with reassured me that people are itching to get the vaccine.

2035,I mean this person’s counterargument is literally ‘my freedom!’

2037,I was thinking the continued masks mandates are so anti vaxxer / masker covid deniers can't just lie about having been vaccinated and stop wearing their mask.
2038,What age?
2039,Masks?
2040,I haven't seen anything like that in our school so interested about circumstances.
2041,Lifting restrictions.
2042,Isn’t it obvious
2043,There should actually be enough doses to offer the first shot to around 290-300M people by the end of June.
2044,I got the first vaccine on Wednesday the 7th and started feeling sick on the 8th.
2045,I got tested on the 10th and had covid.
2046,Apparently I had a cousin at my house who had it but was asymptomatic.
2047,It’s been almost 2 weeks of staying home now and I feel fine but I’ve had people tell me I don’t/shouldn’t get the second vaccine.

2053,Glad they cleared that up right out of the gate.
2054,"Well, the current vaccines can't cause cancer."
2055,"They don't have anything in them that causes DNA damage, which is a requirement for causing cancer."
2056,"I get that you personally don't want to keep having the conversation, but in my own friend group about 10-15 people are refusing to get vaccinated because they think there is some magical ingredient that's going to cause birth defects or cancer or some unknown problem later on."
2057,There's nothing in the vaccine or its mode of action that would cause those problems.
2058,"It's not like Zantec or any other pill, actually, in that regard."
2059,"The CDC has actually said they don't think there is a risk to pregnant women who get it, but you're 100% correct that there is not enough data."
2060,"The probability of impact from the clotting issue on the J&amp;J vaccine was so rare that it took about 6,000,000 people getting it to determine that it even happened."
2061,"They are looking now to determine if 1/1,000,000 is statistically significant and what other factors might come into play."
2062,"I get that you aren't wanting to get it because of your specific issue, but the recommendation for everyone who wants the pandemic to end is to keep pushing vaccines, and to do that, unfortunately, we have to have the uncomfortable conversations to determine who isn't getting it and why."
2063,"In your case, you might be well-informed and correct in not getting it, but you are the 1% of the people who have a legitimate reason and not because you think that (to quote my cousin) ""The vaccine and the virus are both risks, so I'm choosing the natural one."""
2064,"I laugh my ass off every time I see the phrase “double mutant variant.”

Sounds scary, but with the added context that the UK variant is an octuple mutant variant, it kinda puts things into perspective."
2065,It's a hard problem because they've found that Americans don't like large walk in clinics and prefer small pharmacies in their neighborhood.
2066,"It's hard to imagine for each small pharmacy they could truly handle ""walk ins"" because of how inefficient defrosting mRNA doses is- there would surely be waste."
2067,Our area has loads of big walk in clinics but people are still wasting time hunting for appointments at particular Walgreens near their house.

2075,Somewhere around the 65% level will mean that everyone who wants a vaccine has either had a dose or will get it in the next couple of weeks.
2076,We should be there in 2-3 weeks at our current pace.
2077,Sorry I’m so upset.
2078,It’s very frustrating coming from the other side of this.
2079,The CDC should rethink this recommendation because it’s over stepping.
2080,It’s one thing to talk to someone who thinks the vaccine has a microchip in it but it’s another to push people to explain medical reasons.
2081,What if I had aids or some other reason (idk what the excepted conditions are).
2082,It’s beyond just allergies and it’s very personal
2083,"Ummm, or you know... work on getting to a position where you can stay home if your sick..."
2084,What does controlling movement has to do with vaccines?
2085,"This argument would've made sense if the Israel's control prevented the Palestinians from procuring vaccines independently, i.e."
2086,"if Israel not only controlled movement, but actively used that control to prevent Palestinians from getting vaccines, but this isn't the case."
2087,"Even if it were the case, the argument then would've been that Israel should not do that, not that Israel should gift the Palestinians free vaccines."
2088,"Most aspects of Palestinian life in the WB in Gaza are controlled by the PA and Hamas respectively, not Israel, and there is nothing about Israel's control that prevents the Palestinians in those places from procuring and distributing vaccines independently, which is exactly what they've been doing."

2097,"Not disagreeig with you, but it depends how you define 'vast majority'."
2098,"To specify it a bit more, 225 million people vaccinated with (at least) 1 dose will be reached mid-June in the EU."
2099,"“As he has said recently, Fauci reiterated that the use of face masks by individuals, even after vaccination, has been to stop the low – but still possible – asymptomatic spread of the virus: vaccines have around 95% efficacy, meaning that there is a 5% to still become infected.” Stupid typo aside, this is irresponsible journalism."
2100,And I keep seeing it pop up like this totally unchecked.
2101,95% efficacy does *not* mean you still have a 5% chance of being infected.

2109,"&gt;	The study, the largest and most detailed COVID-19 brain autopsy report published to date, suggests that the neurological changes often seen in these patients may result from inflammation triggered by the virus in other parts of the body or in the brain’s blood vessels."
2110,Yes the freedom to die from lack of medical care or go bankrupt and still die from bad and super expensive medical care.

2114,"The problem is that residents are more dependent on the hospital than the opposite, since they can't have a license without residency."
2115,I think it is all a disparity of wealth distribution problem.
2116,People are feeling more threatened as resources get more scarce and or more wealth flows to only a few.
2117,Even the well educated middle class followers of the crazy politics are just fearful of losing or not being able to hold on to what they have as the “middle class” get smaller and smaller.
2118,"My god just to be “low income” in parts of California you have to make 117,000 a yr!."

2133,I never get the flu so I never saw the news for the shot.
2134,Ignorant thinking perhaps.
2135,"As soon as it was announced that all 16 and older could go, I made an appointment."
2136,Got my first vaccine last Wednesday.
2137,Better to go to Rd states like the Dakotas or Alabama or Tennessee.
2138,They are lagging behind other states in vaccination rates since people don’t want the shots.
2139,It’s a use them or lose them situation so you are helping everyone by getting a vaccine there.
2140,I got my sweet J&amp;J in SD while driving back from a real a road trip (to isolated wilderness areas).
2141,Put down the Post Office when signing up online.
2142,I gave my real one when filling out the paperwork in the pharmacy.

2145,Yes.
2146,"Besides the fact that Germany has lesser deaths,infections and so on than all other comparable countries."
2147,And lesser impact on the economy too.

2149,I think youre just poor at communicating the issue tbh.

2155,It’s a gamble.
2156,One of these days the masks are going to come off in full force (my money’s on summer).
2157,I get my second shot in early May but am still hesitant to do outings.
2158,"I have a feeling my first one will still be with a mask on, but I’m sure as I finally get adjusted to simple outings again (movies, restaurant, vacations), the mask may come off."
2159,"Just like with the virus, I’m sure everyone’s different where some are so ready to take it off as soon as Fauci or the CDC give the word while others will probably wait until 2022 to remove."
2160,"This was always going to be the grey area time for me, that time between getting vaccines and being in a place similar to pre-March 2020 when society barely worried about the flu."
2161,It feels like we’re right smack dab in the middle with summer trying its best to rocket ship us to that second destination.
2162,"There’s going to be so many vacations, parties, outings, etc."
2163,in the coming months unlike last time when people did so as defiance.
2164,Perhaps fall will be a good time to discuss masks as then everyone will be back in line for work and school and won’t be as crazy as they were in the summer letting off all that pent up energy from being indoors.
2165,They have no control over anything.
2166,"Fauci has to realize mask mandates will be gone by the summer, removed by the states."

2177,Once I see the clinical trial data on pregnancy or fetal impact Or I am done having kids then I will get it.
2178,My child’s pcp prescribed him infant zantac for GERD and 3 weeks later they pulled it from the market because it was found to cause cancer.
2179,This was about 1-2 years ago.
2180,Drs and the CDC can only work with the data they are given.
2181,I honestly haven’t found any data on this vaccine.
2182,More concerning is that I haven’t been able to confirm that this type of vaccine has been used on pregnant women at all for any type of virus.
2183,That said I’m not going to run around nursing homes or around people and be a dick about it.
2184,At the same time I’m tired of having this conversation.
2185,"I am a big food, vitamin, health nut and I do the same for my kids."
2186,Baby Purée was all fine and dandy until the CDC or whomever came out with a new report last year or so that there were heavy metals in baby food (mostly rice sweet potato and carrots) so I talked to my dr and she said just limit those foods and etc etc.
2187,And mind you I was already making my own baby food before I found this out - which I was glad about.
2188,I have my reasons to delaying my vaccination and frankly that’s my right
2189,"If they mean fully vaccinated, that's a pretty realistic goal actually."
2190,"Right, what fucking idiot would think this would continue after a year?"
2191,Surely our dear leaders are on the precipice of giving our lives back to us and won’t ever abuse this power again
2192,I'd still day there is a general shortage in the metro area though.
2193,"That seems to be the only place you can easily get a shot and that's an hour drive for me

I'm also confused though because I was there today and they were definitely asking for the QR code you get when you sign up for an appointment."
2194,Maybe there was just a different process if you didn't have an appointment.
2195,"Regardless though - yes, if you are in the ATL area, that's the way to go"
2196,I’ve heard stories of people hopping over to Indiana for theirs since it was so difficult to get one in Chicago and they weren’t making a fuss about residency since turnout in Indiana was so low.
2197,"I concur, the steep upward trajectory in cases there appears to have stopped and is plateauing into what hopefully becomes a drop."

2208,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/15/united-states-vaccine-sharing/
2209,Getting kids vaccinated is more about protecting adults than the kids themselves.
2210,"Hardly any children have died of coronavirus (less than 300 of 75+ million), all of whom have had preexisting conditions."
2211,"The amount of kids who died in 2020 actually fell compared to 2019, despite COVID."
2212,Thank you science and bidens leadership.
2213,We dodged a 2nd trump bullet.
2214,But very few people keep up a very healthy lifestyle *consistently* over the long term.
2215,"IMO you need to have an ""addiction"" to the lifestyle to do so"
2216,Yes.
2217,You need to stick around as a tourist though for at least 3 weeks for your second shot.
2218,Me too.
2219,I really thought we'd top out around a total of 38-45% similar to the flu vaccine.

2239,Don’t people still run into the problem of trying to get back into Australia after a funeral or dying family?
2240,"And are all jobs ok with you missing 3 weeks minimum (1 week travel and attend funeral, 2 weeks quarantine) for a funeral?"
2241,And then the possibility of flight cancellations.
2242,We were going through that and decided to just drive 2.5 hours to Bakersfield.
2243,Yeah it was annoying but its like a 6 week process from first dose to being fully vaccinated so we wanted to do it as soon as possible just to be safe.
2244,Hopefully for our next dose we will find something closer.
2245,[removed]
2246,This is the kind of shit that makes me begin to sympathize with people protesting this.
2247,Indefinite mask mandates and social distancing even after people get vaccines?
2248,"I mean you can do whatever you want like wear masks after, but if this passed, I would 100% be pissed off."
2249,"Businesses have been suffering for over a year and now they’re basically saying “we don’t think you suffered enough, do this forever.”

2252,"compared to other states, a $25,000 grant, which is different from a loan, is more meaningful than nothing at all"
2253,I think in the end this was more about how doctors were trying to treat this with heparin which was making it worse.
2254,"Now we know the cause, know the signs to look for, how to test for it, and to treat it with anything but heparin."
2255,Those who develop the condition should be fine now as long as doctors know how to respond to it.
2256,Obese people are less active as well.
2257,It's a chicken and egg situation.
2258,"Good question, my assumption would be they do not because they have received a vacccine that has been EUA’d yet by the FDA."
2259,"Awesome, thanks for the help!"
2260,I imagine that there will be quite a few 3 to 4 week vacations.
2261,amazing how little empathy people have in the US.
2262,why would you not want to wear a mask to protect someone else?
2263,I agree entirely

2265,In MA it's not open to under 55 until Monday.

2289,I think you are misunderstanding me.

2308,Masks are never going to be normalized to the vast majority of people
2309,Lucky them.
2310,I had to run into trouble with my supervisor in order to get an appointment.
2311,"But I thought the United States was handling COVID-19 so poorly, that's what I've heard from Reddit the last year."
2312,Wouldn't that mean the United States needs the vaccines badly?
2313,Screen for antibodies before getting vaccinated.
2314,"Northeast here: masks are mandatory everywhere, and everyone wears one all the time."
2315,"You might see one person without, but that person would get strange looks."
2316,"There was definitely a big aspect of Governor Sununu's refusal to extend the mask order that was political (and I disagree with it), but NH is leading the country in first doses given at nearly 60%."
2317,Do we know when that will be?
2318,Last I heard was next year and that seems like too long to wait for a group that's almost entirely unaffected.
2319,"Not a single person in the thumbnail is wearing a mask correctly, if at all."
2320,Airports are literally the only place you have to wear them there.
2321,Lol this comment needs more love!

2326,"Overemphasizing outdoor spread is a case of diminishing returns, especially as the bottom falls out of community spread."
2327,I'm kinda curious how mass vaccination of polio or measles went back then.
2328,Did everyone only get one shot and think they were completely immune?
2329,Did people get yearly boosters until transmission went down?
2330,Did they know right away how many doses we would need or did they guess?
2331,There's a part of me that thinks Covid is going to go the way of measles instead of flu because we have yet to see a variant that completely evades vaccines.
2332,"Oddly, I don't remember my dad having one."
2333,And he enlisted around 1959... Gotta figure he had to walk the needle gauntlet at MEPS or whatever they called MEPS in the 50s.
2334,"&gt;but firstly the chance is still non trivial

Again, who cares?"
2335,As long as they're getting vaccinated.
2336,I got mine at a grocery store.
2337,That's crazy that he was right about that.
2338,I don't think anyone saw that coming.
2339,He did pretty well on the vaccine side of things.
2340,"We've been hearing this for over a year (along with reports from pilot programs)

But it never seems to materialize into any widespread deployments."

2343,How if they're resistant to vaccines?
2344,Smallpox.
2345,I had to get it for going overseas in the military.
2346,Don't touch your Smallpox Vaccine.
2347,"Seriously, some of the guys ended up with some big scars."
2348,Yep.
2349,I got both of my doses there.
2350,"I was hoping there would be more availability at pharmacies by the time I needed my second shot, but that turned out not to be the case at all"
2351,How about a link from say the CDC that says vaccines are only effective in keeping you from dying and going to the hospital.
2352,I'll wait.
2353,Judging by the last election I anticipate that number to slow down.
2354,It’s not 52% of the country I’m concerned about.
2355,It’s the 48% that have proven to be an embarrassment to the human race
2356,Can’t wait for the border to open up.
2357,I miss going to my favorite restaurant in Burnaby.
2358,[deleted]
2359,"That's the important number, the 39%."
2360,"As far as virus spread is concerned, age doesn't matter."
2361,A warm body is a warm body.
2362,You really think a stimulus check is going to keep a restaurant open in LA?

2364,&gt; Has Scomo not dropped the plan of getting everyone vaccinated by the end of the year?
2365,He has just dropped the idea of making any dates given they have only made him look dumb so far.
2366,"I expect this will be a little like masks, hard to get at first but sorted out in time."
2367,Manufacturing will ramp up above what has been currently planned and we will get doses in the not too distant future.
2368,(i obviously get there is a difference between mask and vaccine production but you get the idea)
2369,"It's easier to enforce a blanket ""mask required"" policy than one based on who is fully vaccinated and not."
2370,Same.
2371,Another advantage is that Germany recognizes patients with depression as high-risk.
2372,So I can get vaccinated sooner.
2373,"We don’t yet know what concerts, festivals and other large gatherings will look like after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, but you may want to start adding dogs to the picture."
2374,"Canine presence is already normal at airports where dogs search for weapons, explosives, drugs or other dangerous materials."
2375,But they have been gradually making appearances at large events to sniff out COVID-19 following research that revealed their powerful noses could detect if a person was carrying the virus.
2376,"**They’ve perused Miami Heat basketball games, scanned NASCAR races and inspected nursing home residents."
2377,"**  
  
But just how accurate are they?"
2378,A new “proof-of-concept investigation” by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania adds more evidence to the pile.
2379,"In its study, nine dogs were able to identify positive coronavirus samples with 96% accuracy on average after three weeks of training."
2380,Researchers say using dogs can help catch people who are infected and don’t know it — otherwise known as asymptomatic carriers — before they spread the virus to others.
2381,This method is also cheaper than traditional testing practices.
2382,The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.
2383,(continued....)
2384,"One of the big mistakes during this whole things was elevating Fauci to what is basically 'Health Pope', because we allowed ourselves to end up hanging on his latest vague pronouncement which always so happens to be far behind the times."
2385,And often contradictory.
2386,"So yeah, you can see the Pope similarity here"
2387,If you don't wait long enough you end up with people claiming they are vaxxed when they are not just to have an excuse to not wear a mask.
2388,[removed]
2389,Even that says most of the things that could happen are very rare.
2390,Spreading fear about long term effects sounds a lot like antivax propaganda.
2391,Just because less Canadians have died doesn't mean the situation isn't dire.
2392,It could very well get close to European/US numbers if things continue in its current trajectory.
2393,"Even so, the equivalent of 200,000 Canadians have died of coronavirus when adjusted for population."
2394,"The longer vaccinating the general population takes, the more these numbers will continue to tick upwards."
2395,I don’t get mad at people who are hesitant.
2396,I get mad at people who aggressively spread unsubstantiated information and influence others to make poor health decisions.
2397,You didn’t listen to world to mask up.
2398,Instead u followed direction from fumbling idiot.
2399,And your holding on to vaccines and the materials to make them.
2400,"Tweet from serum institute CEO  ‘Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up."
2401,"Your administration has the details.’  

And then this part in an article ‘A surplus of COVID-19 vaccines is starting to pile up in many states and cities across the U.S., a sign that supply could be starting to outweigh demand in some areas, according to a new Bloomberg analysis."
2402,"While appointments can still be hard to come by, the analysis found that as many as one in three doses go unused in some states."
2403,Top U.S. health officials are beginning to rethink their strategy for distributing the doses based on population’.
2404,"You’ve order 300 million AZ vaccines but aren’t using them, your emergency act allows for the manufacturing of them but does not allow the distribution to other countries."
2405,So yes .. your killing people.

2646,I am sure they will be completely transparent and forthcoming with data in their clinical trials.
2647,You argument still makes zero sense.
2648,"Even with more resources, the sheer number of people to vaccinate is staggering."
2649,426 for every 1.
2650,There's also one more fatal flaw in your argument: pharmaceutical companies can only produce so much of a vaccine within a certain time frame.
2651,Vaccines don't just magically appear out of thin air.
2652,"They need to be produced, distributed, etc."
2653,If you got both doses already you where in one of the top 4 priority groups.
2654,A miniscule clotting risk trumps covid if you got to skip the que.
2655,The UK isn't mixing &amp; matching jabs so you get the same as your first.
2656,"I looked up pictures, it looks like there’s a skin reaction."
2657,Yes you can compare vaccines efficacy data.
2658,That's the whole point of data.
2659,The reason people have been running with that lie is because they do not want people turning down whatever vaccine is offered to them
2660,"There was literally an article posted on this sub that for over 40,000 upvotes where Fauci says vaccinated people can gather amongst themselves:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lsxtyf/fully_vaccinated_people_can_gather_individually/"
2661,That’s just the byline of where the article was written.
2662,They should have called the vaccine Magic Johnson.
2663,It's a little funny that the only vaccine that is a one-shot vaccine is made by a company called Johnson &amp; Johnson.
2664,"Sir, you're getting both Johnsons at once."
2665,Cool their phase 3 was at the height of the pandemic so that caused their vaccine group to have more infections but that ignores that the placebo group was exposed to the same conditions.
2666,If J&amp;J had its phase 3 at a better point in the pandemic sure they would have recorded less infections in the vaccine group but then the placebo group would have had less infections too.
2667,Also where did you get J&amp;J had better effectiveness against severe infection because that is 85% while Pfizer damn near 100% and that's after real world testing in Israel where 90% of cases were the UK varient.
2668,Where do you live that concerts are going on and public parks are crowded?
2669,They shut all of that down.
2670,"Got mine two weeks ago now, but if I hadn’t gotten it already, I probably still would"
2671,"My one worry is that in early May we will be at 50% fully vaccinated and then see a huge slowdown as people who resisted getting a shot start to see infection numbers plummet &amp; think they don't need to get vaccinated, misunderstanding how this works."
2672,"Otherwise, we could definitely get to at least near-effective immunity by July."
2673,"Yeah that may be the case in Florida or other parts of the US, the world is not only the US."
2674,"Most EU countries have been closed for nearly 5 months, that means all bars, restaurants, cafes, museums, cinemas, everything is closed including outdoor terraces, also sale of alcohol is banned in outdoor take away places so what you described is very unlikely."
2675,Also busy shopping streets when retail shops were open (this was only a week or two) also require masks.
2676,So I see no reason why we have to wear a mask walking down the street.
2677,"While I hope this to be true, the U.K. had been in months long lockdown during its vaccination drive so it’s hard to say the effect was purely vaccination"
2678,"&gt;Almost 40% of the South American country’s total population have now received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to statistics compiled by Our World in Data, reflecting one of the highest vaccination rates in the world."
2679,"&gt;Only Israel and the U.K., respectively, have inoculated a larger share of their population with at least one dose."
2680,"&gt;Nonetheless, Chile has endured a sharp uptick in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, even with its world-renowned vaccine rollout and strict lockdowns in place for much of its 19 million inhabitants."
2681,"&gt;The Pan American Health Organization’s regional director has since emphasized that for most countries in the region, vaccines won’t be enough to prevent rising infection rates."
2682,Deaths will spike hard in the near future.
2683,1600 deaths is not much for a nation the size of India.
2684,Sweden had upwards of 200 at its worse days.
2685,130 times the population.
2686,The trials being done in completely different environments means jack shit.
2687,If Pfizer vaccine group didnt get many infections because the environment was more favorable at the time then that means its placebo group also had the same favorable environment so the ratio wouldn't change.
2688,Also we have real world data of Pfizer and Moderna and it's still far higher than J&amp;J trial data.
2689,"When do you all expect the world to feel ""normal"" in the following places:

- The United States

2698,*
2699,&gt; then how could we be over 50% as a country?
2700,Because we're not.
2701,"&gt; Half of US **adults**
&gt; 
&gt; best states are around 35-40% of the **total population**

There are roughly 74 million children in the US (most of which cannot yet be vaccinated) and 256 million adults."
2702,"If half the US adults got vaccinated, that would be 128m/330m for a total of 38.78% of the total population."
2703,"An [earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mti7xf/half_of_us_adults_have_received_at_least_1_dose/guzuu3x/) said 1.7% of those 17 and under have received a vaccination, so if you add them, it would be 129.25m/330m for a total of 39.16%"
2704,This makes sense given how lacking the regulations and the public will to follow them seems to be.
2705,At one point it was like 25% of people polled said they were still going about their normal daily life (i.e.
2706,not quarantining) when they had symptoms.
2707,"It has been really disappointing to watch my own efforts at trying to stay indoors and safe be eradicated by partying neighbors, people gathering outside bar's ""takeaway"" areas on the sidewalk, etc."
2708,Older means wiser maybe?
2709,I actually wonder if this could be attributed to the Internet.
2710,"When I was younger you never heard of anti vaccination movements, moon landing hoaxes and alike."
2711,So I think the Internet and social media have sort of helped give the anti vaccination folks a wider audience than they would have had in the 80s.
2712,I suspect vaccinations are a contributing factor but I'm just a random internet person
2713,I've yet to see an article that points out their false positive rate.
2714,That said I guess the real reason is a dog is going to require a lot more maintenence and have a lower throughput than PCR testing.
2715,Perhaps you are living in the bubble.
2716,"We've already got 28% vaccinated when it isn't even available to young people in some states, and it's only just become available in most."
2717,What are the stats of permanent impotence in young (&lt;25) men in positive covid cases?
2718,I keep seeing this claim and would love to see an actual number!
2719,Thanks
2720,‘Antibody dependent enhancement’.
2721,The future isn’t as certain as you want it to be.
2722,Astrazeneca vaccine is reserved for 55 years old people in France.
2723,So it's not very strange to have this average age.

2735,You’re welcome.
2736,We have an emergency production act to fall back on if supplies deplete.
2737,We cranked out new ventilators at speed when supplies we disastrous.
2738,What a huge pile of bullshit.
2739,Amd yet the comments below are full of antivax pseudoscience.
2740,"I don't know, man, the long-term complications of operating with practically half a lung kinda sucks."
2741,Special appearance by Don Johnson
2742,Were none of the deceased / sick vaccinated?
2743,You’re getting downvoted because you’ve linked a ‘study’ which is just a series of largely unsubstantiated anti-mask conspiracy theories posing as a ‘summary of the science’ from a non-peer reviewed journal.
2744,"You’re not ‘following the science’, you’re following a loony with a PhD."
2745,You’re compounding it by asking for other scientific studies that disprove it before you disbelieve it.
2746,"Just read the first few paragraphs again, it’s obviously bunk."
2747,"Your burden of proof is totally out of whack if your only criteria for believing this nonsense is that some guy wrote it, yet you’re setting a much higher bar to disprove it."
2748,This article has very strong 'flying cars' energy.
2749,**Don't spread misinformation.
2750,** Nothing you said is true.
2751,"To be fair, there are a lot of people who are asking for exactly that and it's never given."
2752,"I'm the opposite of a fan of Jim Jordan, but in that widely panned exchange he had with Fauci, he was in fact asking for a metric, any metric, that would mean ""Americans got their freedom back""."
2753,"In my opinion it's pretty silly and dramatic to suggest that Americans have had their liberties ""assaulted"" as though by some evil design, but that doesn't make his question illegitimate, because he was actually asking for exactly what we are saying should be reasonable."
2754,Sorry about your situation.
2755,Must suck balls to have to hire your replacement.
2756,"They’re probably going to have to base mask rules on how many cases are in the community, not on who is or isn’t vaccinated"
2757,I'm just pointing out that the thread starter and the first reply aren't in disagreement.
2758,I've not expressed an opinion either way but come at me with downvotes anyways.
2759,Most of what you wrote I agree with..  but I also want to point out The negative isn't just about the risk of infection to children.
2760,What happened  in my state is vaccines were given to young teachers ahead of front line workers and seniors who do not live in nursing homes dues to unavoidable politics from schools opening (cant send teachers to school if you dont offer them the vaccine first).
2761,This delay meant the needless death of some front line workers and seniors as they could have otherwise gotten their shots before they were exposed to covid.
2762,Jesus Christ.
2763,And they just had a holiday last week.
2764,Hopefully we don't see a huge boom in the coming weeks.
2765,So can we go outside yet.
2766,I’m 19 and am getting Moderna #2 on Tuesday because of a pre-existing thing.
2767,I’m so relieved it’s all coming to an end and I’ll be able to go to college in the fall.
2768,"Look at Israel data, the vaccines cut everything by the same rate - 90% less asymptomatic, 90% less severe cases, 90% less deaths."
2769,But this sub likes to pretend deaths are prevented at 100% rate.

2786,The west might not but what about the other billions of people?
2787,"The vaccine betters our chances of fighting the virus, so hopefully will make it easier to get to a point where viral loads cause massive damage."
2788,We won't know until we do enough long Covid studies into it.
2789,"So far, we know that people can get Covid repeatedly, although viral loads *usually* decrease with each infection."
2790,"I don't think we know yet, conclusively."
2791,Just goes to show you can't buy class.
2792,(In all seriousness I really love the brand rivalry bit)
2793,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe now that it's midnight all adults in the United States are now eligible for a vaccine."
2794,"Same with B.1.351, but manufacturers gotta manufacture."
2795,"Vaccines are being developed and improved upon to account for these “variants” and “mutations.” Only a new virus with little knowledge would put the US in lockdown, not a virus in which treatments and vaccines are already developed/being developed."

2801,Moderna Gang Gang
2802,"to be fair, NZ's opposition wanted to open up, and that opposition was in power most of the last 10 years."
2803,The longer we stay separated and unable to experience coronaviruses the more deadly this will become as T cell memory wears off.
2804,We have natural immune responses to the 4 coronavirus strains.
2805,Synthetic replacements as a sole panacea is going to be a disaster in the long run.
2806,Antibodies focus on spike proteins.
2807,Glycan shielding on these spikes allow the virus to hide from these vaccines.
2808,If our t cells forget how to identify coronavirus due to lack of periodic exposure to similar but less lethal versions then we will see B.1.617 and future mutations do more and more damage.
2809,"Here in Canada doing something like that would be considered ""racist"" so regardless of the common sense of doing this by the time they have no choice it will be far too late which at this point it probably already is."
2810,Lets hope.
2811,"It works in Asia, so why not everywhere else?"
2812,"&gt; The cynical part of me remembers flat earthers exist

The pandemic has made the ""skeptics"" more apparent because everyone else is at home isolating or wearing masks."
2813,There are an enormous number of people who are drinking the koolaide.
2814,"No matter how deadly, there will always be people who won't follow the logic."
2815,18-29 and have my first dose scheduled for this coming week!
2816,So excited!
2817,I didn't edit the title.
2818,The site must have changed it.
2819,I hope the vaccine studies with kids are going beautifully with only the most minor of side effects so they can be approved soon.
2820,Children are unvaccinated.
2821,It makes sense.
2822,The question is whether the risk of infection in school age children should be considered greater than the guaranteed harm of keeping schools closed.
2823,"BC has about 600 pharmacies with AZ doses but is averaging 8,500 vaccinations per day and have 190,000 unused doses."
2824,By opening up to 40+ we pharmacies will be able to vaccinate at a much higher rate and we can get BC better protected and sooner.
2825,Right now Moderna/Pfizer are being administered to 63 year olds and AZ is being offered to 55+.
2826,Lots of people are waiting for Moderna/Pfizer.
2827,BC is expected to announce tomorrow that on Tuesday they will open up AZ doses to those 40+.
2828,NACI will make an announcement on Tuesday.
2829,India is the 2nd largest manufacturer of Covid vaccines.
2830,"The problem they are having right now is they got complacent and overconfident with their recovery, and then got hit with a 2nd wave."
2831,Yet still you can travel from India to most places including the U.K.
2832,It's time for ppl to lay off this delusional optimism the vaccines have brought and start waking up to the fact that unfortunately this nightmare is far from over.
2833,"By the time we come close to vaccinating a decent amount of the population a booster shot will be required, not to mention that they've already announced that we will need yearly shots."
2834,Oh and the subject that is completely ignored which is that the virus is spreading through endless amounts of animals which we haven't even begun to consider the mutations that are yet to jump back to humans from that.
2835,Everyone keeps complaining about being fatigued but don't you think every brutal situation that humans have faced over the centuries ppl felt the same way?
2836,"No amount of complaining will change the reality of the situation and if you don't take this seriously yet, just wait until someone you love dies and see how fast your attitude changes."
2837,That's true.
2838,I think they want to keep it for later use?
2839,"Not enough is known about why AZ causes blood clots and what part of the demographic is at higher risk, so until more is known, it's on hold."
2840,That's a very good point.
2841,"Although antibiotics wouldn't help with viral loads, they would have absolutely helped stop secondary bacterial infections because of peoples worsened immune systems, and helped reduce the number of people with per-existing conditions."
2842,Thanks for mentioning that!
2843,"I downvote the ""if you're vaccinated, live your life"" crowd too."
2844,Continuing to wear a mask really isn't that big of a deal.
2845,"If everyone who is vaccinated stops wearing a mask, people who aren't will stop as well."
2846,"One dose typically gives 80-90% immunity I think, the second one is just a booster."
2847,"Well, if you look at the envelope of the Israeli infection rate curve, you can notice it steepens at the start of September."
2848,"Second lockdown started around 13th Sept, and the rate was still going up until around the start of October."
2849,This is contrary to the predictions of any model of a successful lockdown.
2850,Can I guarantee that the lockdown did nothing?
2851,"No, I can't guarantee anything, but I also know that the lockdown came about at the start of the Jewish holidays to attempt and stop mass congregations, but both ultra orthodox and Arab communities had several 1000+ people events (more than the usual even), with little to no repercussions, and these are the two communities with the highest infection rates."
2852,"I mean, California only has so many adults."
2853,It may never hit 1M/day and that’s ok too.
2854,You are making the same point.
2855,Consider that that next pandemic is a covid variant this fall.
2856,"I believe it's 2-3 weeks after 50% of the total population gets vaccinated, not adult population."
2857,"Given we're vaccinating about 1% of population per day, we should be at 50% in a couple of weeks."
2858,Hope it's the J&amp;J one then
2859,"While I agree with your point, this logic completely ignores the group of people who can't benefit from vaccines."
2860,"Immunocompromised people, such people who have received an organ transplant, are one such group."
2861,"We can't just say ""fuck all the non vaccinated people"" because not everyone is unvaccinated by choice."
2862,"That being said, once we hit a high enough percentage of people vaccinated, the risk for all non vaccinated people will be low enough that we shouldn't all need to wear masks."
2863,And that's when we should stop wearing them in public.
2864,"Not once everyone who wants one can get one, but when we have enough people in our population vaccinated."
2865,"&gt; After the vax is available to everyone who wants it, that's enough

This is pretty much made up."
2866,You can believe it if you want to.
2867,Of course you want that.
2868,I agree we will stop wearing masks at some point.
2869,But this isn't true at all.
2870,"""After the vax is available to everyone who wants it, that's enough""."
2871,"We will need to be vaccinated again within a year, for example."
2872,The truth isn't what you want it to be.
2873,It's not over at all once enough people in the US get vaccinated.
2874,I can't find an article about it but I believe in fifteen minutes all adults in the country will be eligible to make an appointment.
2875,I think Oregon is the last one to open it up.
2876,"Very scary stuff, prions."
2877,This post appears to be about vaccines.

2882,how many people did they kill?
2883,"Oh, yes, you actually know almost nothing about it, and you know nothing about Bhutan."
2884,"I’m fully vaccinated and I had covid back in October,  if I can’t go out and rage (dancing, mingling etc) by Memorial Day I’m gonna fucking lose my shit."
2885,Just under half my state is vaccinated with their first dose at this point almost 3mil fully vaccinated)  and we still can’t leave our tables at a fucking bar.
2886,These restrictions are a total joke at this point.
2887,I can walk around aimlessly at the grocery store and the gym but god forbid I get up to talk to somebody at another table at a restaurant/bar.
2888,"If your scared of corona stay home, at the very least allow non - essential businesses to CHOOSE to implement restrictions."
2889,"I’m in my early 20’s, signed up to get vaccinated as soon as possible which was difficult because our age group was basically put at the very end of the line to get it."
2890,In my state a girl dressed up as a granny and got caught ‘skipping the line’ to get a vaccine.
2891,Dr Fauci is also vaccinated and he is wearing his mask everywhere.
2892,Lol if you think the US will enter another heavy lockdown.
2893,"By fall, just about everything will be open again and will stay open until whatever new virus/pandemic that shows up."
2894,"How's this for a horror story: 

Felt great after receiving my first dose of Moderna."
2895,"A few hours later, I began to experience nasty aches, chills, and muscle pain."
2896,Woke up the following morning with a fever and felt like I got hit by a bus.
2897,"Got a covid test and it came back positive the following day, so I must have contracted it days before being vaccinated."
2898,Currently entering day 5 of covid.
2899,"Arm still hurts, and eating eggs that have no taste is a very strange feeling."
2900,THANK YOU!
2901,!
2902,"Yes, they have stronger/better immune responses than people who didn't get covid before the vaccination."
2903,Multiple papers recently came out about this.
2904,Check r/COVID19
2905,India has access to the vaccine.
2906,They are donating all the doses internationally for political points.
2907,Yay far right parties in power!
2908,[removed]
2909,Another problem is that these viruses adapts and evolves faster than human attitudes and behaviors.
2910,It’ll be so satisfying to kill them.
2911,"The viruses i mean, not humans."
2912,"I’m not worried, we have a vaccine"
2913,We were at a rolling 7 day average of 3.38M on 4/13.
2914,Yesterday we were at 3.2M.
2915,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-19-vaccination-doses?tab=chart
2916,[removed]
2917,Is this any different from how it’s been for the entire vaccination effort?
2918,I keenly remember the percentage of delivered vaccines that were administered being under 80% in February.
2919,Are you saying supply outstripped demand then?
2920,Yep.
2921,Just a few dead women bd and a small price to pay tbqh.
2922,Oh I don’t blame you.
2923,You got the vaccine live your life.
2924,Especially if you’re low risk yourself and won’t be around people who are high risk when you get home!
2925,already the 2nd wave would have been largely avoidable if the government hadn’t caved to the AfD/Querdenker bunch in Autumn.
2926,Now the third wave is in full swing and they learned absolutely nothing... - too many people stopped following the rules and the governments reaction to avoid the spread of the British variant was too little too late.
2927,"- When you know that it takes two weeks for the lockdown to take effect, you can’t wait until all ICU-beds are occupied... -besides there is still no effektive cure available, and the people who are now hit hardest are 40-50y instead of the 80+ year olds during the first wave... - it’s a race against time, and the world is losing, because we didn’t expand vaccine production fast enough."
2928,When you look at India etc.
2929,you can already expect millions of additional deaths...
2930,Stupid moderna people.
2931,The cool kids get primo Pfizer.
2932,I bet your parents bought you mega blocks as a kid and called it lego

2936,"The case count is looking good, but we need deaths to keep falling."

2939,"Farmers tan is bad enough, but one on my face?"

2941,Why bother?
2942,Just wait until your second..
2943,"Those countries will be spending years and decades recovering from the toll of the pandemic in every possible way: in terms of their economies, their educational losses (from kindergarten to univeristy), in terms of mental health, physical, social and community health on top of the deaths and injury."
2944,Meanwhile Australians are almost untouched.
2945,It would take a lot for Australia to fall to the devastation of those countries.
2946,A few knocks here and there when we're already in such a strong position will be easy to manage.
2947,You're right.
2948,I.
2949,Just being cautious since I haven't seen any studies on it.
2950,This is absolutely not true.
2951,Risk is reduced but just because your outside doesn’t mean there’s no chance.
2952,They have very very little evidence that you can get it via surface contact though.
2953,"Obviously scientific studies are needed on this, but yes, I think having more wallks, jogging outside would have also helped an obese person increase their chances in the last 12 months."
2954,"Maybe not in the first 2-3 weeks, but after that more air and walks could have done good."
2955,You can take that vaccine and blow it out your ass.

2959,I'm going to be a good girl and stick to lots of water.

2961,No.

2964,[deleted]
2965,Everyone I know who isn’t getting them now just do not trust brand new vaccines.
2966,They are worried about long term effects.
2967,I’ve argued so much with them and it’s their loss but most of them are waiting later on in the year or at least next year.
2968,Waiting till the general population has had the vaccine for a year.
2969,It’s depressing.
2970,Why would you take a vaccine with less than 90% effectiveness rate when you can get one with more than 90% effectiveness rate?
2971,The J&amp;J and AZ vaccines are less effective.
2972,Why is it bad to wait for a more effective one?
2973,If you’re ugly just say that.
2974,"Israel is not ""occupying"" anything."
2975,They were granted this territory and they annexed the rest fair and square when they were attacked continuously.
2976,They are a beacon of civilization in that part of the world (though Jordan is nice too but they're on good terms with Israel).
2977,Why would people not protect themselves against AIDS???
2978,?
2979,&gt; The Modi government has completely failed this country.
2980,"Modi definitely has blood on his hands, but this is also a case where the people deserve the government."
2981,In an alternative universe if an able government had imposed stricter lockdowns people would've rioted and broken rules anyway.
2982,I remember the police beating violators with sticks last year.
2983,I like to think this is nature thinning out the stupid.
2984,Virus mutates and adapts to spread faster
2985,You're totally right on stuff like this.
2986,I should have used a better example in my post though.
2987,"My wife was pregnant a few years back, and the doctor offered some genetic tech because of her age."
2988,It's not always covered by insurance so they asked us.
2989,We couldn't get the price from the doctor.
2990,"We couldn't get the price from the insurance company because they didn't know the exact procedure code, and we called the doctor back and she and her office didn't know because its the lab that determines that."
2991,"That is my frustration, that many times it's so hard to figure out the exact price."
2992,"Get that procedure code wrong and you're screwed, even though you really only agreed to a procedure based on the understanding of price."
2993,"For your point, the obvious solution is to change the combo back to include the tool the surgeon actually likes."
2994,But is there any actual pressure to do so?
2995,Probably not much.
2996,Which is so silly.
2997,Ask them to help find you an appointment.

3009,"I hate being sick but I'm far more concerned about not spreading COVID to other people, regardless of whether I had a symptomatic infection or not."
3010,The falsehood that vaccinated people can still be major vectors for COVID has become a very dangerous one and may be partly to blame for some people not getting vaccinated.
3011,This is unfounded bullshit.

3030,I already had Covid and am just not in a rush
3031,I really don’t know how anyone could fall for it.
3032,We paused it over 6 cases in 7.4 million.
3033,You don’t think if the others had a similar rate we wouldn’t pause them?
3034,A 2-3% death rate for an extremely infectious disease is HUUUUUUUGE.
3035,Jesus christ if that were the death rate we'd be at millions dead in the US alone.
3036,Some what late but better than never - at least it looks like Borris is doing something.

3038,"For reference, from [the recent NEJM editorial,](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2106315) the European numbers are:
&gt;Additional cases have now been reported to the European Medicines Agency, including at least 169 possible cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 53 possible cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis among 34 million recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, 35 possible cases of central nervous system thrombosis among 54 million recipients of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine, and 5 possible (but unvetted) cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis among 4 million recipients of the Moderna mRNA vaccine."
3039,"It must be emphasized that not all of these case reports have been subject to rigorous central review, nor have results of tests for anti-PF4 antibodies been reported; however, these numbers may be underestimates, since reporting is voluntary."
3040,well its tough when their presidente rejects the helps
3041,"Understood, but I'm not sure why movie theaters have a much lower capacity than restaurants, which is presumably a more dangerous activity."
3042,Restaurants guarantees that pretty much everybody dining will not have a mask on while dining and drinking.
3043,"There is some food and drinks at movie theaters, but not everybody going to see a movie gets food or drink."
3044,There is also not going to be the same level of talking at a movie theater.
3045,"Restaurants are very social places where people gather and converse, and talking without a mask has been shown to spread the virus."
3046,I am more likely to go to a movie theater than dine indoors.
3047,It seems like the much safer option since I can keep a mask on and still enjoy the movie.
3048,"I’m done wearing a mask, social distancing, etc."
3049,"on September 1, 2021."
3050,Absolutely no reason this thing shouldn’t be effectively over by then.

3053,Got it.
3054,"To both of you, the side effects are very important."
3055,It shows the vaccine is working.
3056,With ANY illness you will have an immune response.
3057,In terms of the vaccine being scared is okay.
3058,We all are.
3059,But how are you not scared of long term COVID risks?
3060,80% of people who got COVID never return to 100% pre COVID after 6 months.
3061,As of now nothing shows a long term risk by taking a vaccine.
3062,Something to consider and look into is that this type of vaccine is not new.
3063,It’s just new to this scale.
3064,It’s been shown to work stronger and more effectively than conventional vaccines.
3065,I hope you do research and trust the medical experts.
3066,20 years from now we will know a little more.
3067,But it’s not like they are missing anything than what’s right in front of us.
3068,Vaccines save lives.
3069,At any age.
3070,The problem with saying I have a healthy immune system so I’m not getting it is that you are still helping the virus mutate and spread.
3071,So while you have a very small chance of becoming seriously ill you are saying this small inconvenience for me isn’t worth helping other people who are at risk.
3072,If a large amount of people refuse then the virus WILL continue to mutate and there is potential for a new mutation that the current vaccines won’t protect us from.
3073,"Sputnik's data is really good, it's just the trust issues with it."
3074,But that is a political issue so it's hard to set politics aside.
3075,"Sinopharm's data is not as good, although it's an inactivated virus vaccine which could take considerably longer to give protection."
3076,There is concern that sputnik has the same clotting risks as AZ and J&amp;J; there's no reason to think that it doesn't.
3077,"Hard choice and either would be fine, but I'd probably choose sinopharm."
3078,I agree.
3079,My husband is not political.
3080,He hates politics and any political party.
3081,He also doesn't want the vaccine and I believe it's because it started with government telling us to vaccinate.

3083,"I'm from New York, but I work with a lot of people in Houston and have to say that the mischaracterization of Texas in America's discourse is pretty wild."
3084,The state is home to 4 of the nation's 11 largest cities and trails only NY/CA in # of Fortune 500 headquartered companies.
3085,"In other words, there are a TON of moderate/liberal, highly educated, institution trusting folks in Texas."
3086,"Heck, Trump only won it by 5.5 points this past cycle."
3087,Physically yes.
3088,"But again, they’re not donated for free in most cases"

3122,Yes.
3123,Medical doctors generally refer to what you listed as “side effects of the vaccines”.
3124,I know what you’re trying to say.
3125,I know you use a much more specific (and scientifically correct) definition of the term “side effect”.
3126,To your final sentence.
3127,"Yes, they don’t know how much of the vaccine is safe to give to 4 year old children at this time."
3128,"So, no, we dont know that this vaccine is safe for 4 year olds."
3129,"If you give too much of this “safe vaccine” to 4 year old children, it may be fatal or cause serious complications."
3130,"One of my parents got Moderna and one got Pfizer, neither reported any side effects."
3131,Hopefully that extends to their children XD
3132,"Despite the controversy, it appears that sputnik V is a very effective vaccine, moreso than sinopharm."
3133,"It likely has similar, very very rare, clotting issues as the other Adenovirus vector vaccines."
3134,"I would probably take the sputnik vaccine, personally."
3135,"It can literally also mean “I’m worried about the accuracy of a non-peer-reviewed, potentially rushed, and literally incomplete clinical trial which, while technically science, is not very reassuring science”."
3136,I’m not going anywhere and don’t plan to at all this year.
3137,"No family within a 600 mile radius, I’m not planning on socializing like I used to(no bars, clubs)."

3157,More catastrophic thrombosis have resulted from the mRNA vaccines (still rare) than the J&amp;J.
3158,This is absurdity.
3159,I have an indoors meeting with some maskless people (most likely) at 12 days post 2nd dose of Pfizer?
3160,No reason for concern in terms of level of immunity?
3161,Why is wearing a mask dystopian?
3162,"East Asian countries have normalized Mask wearing for a generation and they faired much better against COVID because of it, why wouldn't it take off in the rest of the developed world?"
3163,Also Masks would prevent other diseases beyond just COVID going forward.
3164,A much milder flu season would save thousands of lives.
3165,This was obvious
3166,How is it nearly identical when things are spiking now?
3167,This is the end of flu season.
3168,Yes.
3169,That it is relatively safe to gather with unvaccinated individuals.

3180,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
3181,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
3182,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

3197,"Lower demand would accelerate the US dropping our export embargo, which will do tremendous good."
3198,"Those doses can be sent to high-risk people in other countries, saving considerably more lives there."
3199,This is interesting because they give stats   that 28% of Republicans will not get the vaccine and 18% more will wait and see.
3200,"Ironic, because it was Trump’s crowning achievement to get the vaccine ready and available."
3201,But they don’t give numbers for Democrats or any other groups.
3202,This is surprising because much of the anti-vax movement is very liberal and it’s liberal enclaves with the highest rates of unvaccinated children.
3203,Robert F Kennedy Jr. has been a leader in the anti-vax movement and has been very outspoken in his criticism of Fauci and the vaccines.
3204,"So, is it true that Democrats who are traditionally against vaccines are actually getting the covid vaccination?"

3227,Just a lot of anecdotal evidence.
3228,"As they said during the meeting, that is for CVST only."
3229,"As they also said during the meeting, they only reviewed that very specific type of thrombosis (there are dozens of types), but VIPT thrombosis can occur in places other than one very specific vein."
3230,Blood clots travel.
3231,The place they start can be different from where they end up.

3236,"&gt; That may sound like a big number, but it indicates that a vaccinated person’s chances of getting Covid are about one in 11,000."
3237,"It's about one in 11,000 IF ALL 11,000 ARE EXPOSED TO COVID!"
3238,This is a huge point that even the NYT is missing.
3239,Your chances are much lower than that because not everybody is being exposed to COVID.
3240,Plus as more people get vaccinated it gets even better because there will be fewer and fewer carriers.

3248,80% of people above 20 had at least one shot.

3252,"I want to, but it’s only 60+."
3253,Meanwhile I have friends in the states who are in their 30s and got their 2nd doses.

3261,Until June BioNTech alone is gonna supply another 45 mln doses.
3262,"If 80% of adult population wants to be vaccinated, everyone will probably get atleast their first doses within end of July even in the most pessimistic scenarios."

3337,"All three of the potential breakthrough cases had a prior positive PCR test for COVID-19, but met the definition of a ""breakthrough"" case because they'd tested positive more than 45 days before the onset of symptoms, said Chelsea Wuth, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services."

3340,"Is she saying they were asymptomatic positive COVID and 45 days later, while completely vaccinated, they  came down with symptoms of COVID?"
3341,I've read that you can continue to test positive after having severe COVID for months but this article makes it sound like they were asymptomatic positive COVID and continued shedding for month and half.

The comment I replied to:

&gt;	Show me the studies"
3361,That’s awesome!
3362,Last week marked the point of me being considered fully vaccinated.
3363,My mom is also fully vaccinated so she’s actually visiting me right now and staying for a few days!
3364,I hadn’t seen her in almost a year.
3365,Almost all my family has been fully vaccinated as well so in may I’m going to visit them and I can’t wait.
3366,The incompetent prime minister Modi is holding state election rallies amidst all of this.
3367,He also gave vaccines to other countries to improve his image while we could’ve been vaccinating his own people.
3368,I don’t really think that the vast majority of the EU adults will have the first shot by the end of June.
3369,"Obviously it depends from your definition of vast majority, if you mean 60% of the population then it *may* be possible."

3381,This is disingenuous in my opinion.
3382,"The breakthrough infection data is very encouraging but still preliminary, and the myopic focus on death and serious illness doesn’t address the concerns people may have about ending up with long Covid."
3383,I for one am being more open since vaccination but still cautious.
3384,I won’t do things like see people I don’t know indoors or eat at an indoor restaurant until community spread stops or they demonstrate there isn’t a risk of long Covid from breakthrough infections.
3385,I also dislike the term because mutations are always relative.
3386,"Saying it has 2 ""mutations"" just means it has 2 differences compared to the first one we studied."
3387,"Every gene of every organism is a ""mutation""."
3388,At the end of the day all that matters is how infectious it is.
3389,That’s exactly my point and my worry given that this is a possible conclusion to come to with the little information that’s given.
3390,"If you’re a college age kid, coming and going, keeping track of this sh1t, etc."

3392,Is that ground glass something that can be fixed?
3393,I don't get this argument...
3394,I'm saying tying reopening and restrictions to hospitalizations is a good thing.
3395,You're saying that's not good enough?
3396,You'd like it to be some nebulous thing left on the backs of highly risk-intolerant unelected public health officials (who do a great job with the things they've been tasked with) and I think that's every bit as damaging as any potential issue you see with relying on accurate hospitalization metrics.
3397,You have far more chance of being shot in the States than you do Australia.
3398,You guys have police shooting people and crazy people with guns shooting at people with alarming regularity.
3399,That certainly doesn’t happen very often in Australia.
3400,There's nothing we could do about that.
3401,"We signed deals with every major vaccine maker just as early as the US, UK and European nations."
3402,But the vaccine manufacturers made the decision to send the largest shipments to the nations which have the biggest outbreaks and the nations which gave the most money to the vaccine development first.
3403,NZ and Australia were put at the bottom of the list.
3404,"Australia put most of its faith in AZ because it made a deal to manufacture that vaccine itself, which has now backfired."
3405,"NZ is simply too small and not wealthy enough to compete with bigger, wealthier countries."
3406,We have to wait for Pfizer to deliver the vaccines we paid for and that will be months.
3407,I suppose human trials on uyghurs and tibetans.
3408,"The media just reported what the CDC reported on last fall: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/schools-can-open-safely-during-covid-the-latest-evidence-shows/

I'm not a Trump fan but when he said to cases will decrease if you stop testing he was right."
3409,When you have mandatory testing you find a bunch of asymptomatic cases.
3410,Some states have in person schooling and are not mandating testing of kids and the cases are not spiking.
3411,I think what we need to realize is that now we have vaccines and a large portion of the vulnerable are vaccinated or at least 1 shot so cases mean something different now.
3412,It's not great to have a lot of cases but it's not as dire as in the past.
3413,"""I know that feel, bro."""
3414,"- Louisville, KY"
3415,Even the compromised people who have gotten the vaccine don’t have the same full protection that someone with a robust immune system like me or you have.
3416,"They may also have kids, who are unable to get the vaccine, but are likely to catch Covid from school, daycare, or play groups."
3417,"This is why it’s so important for mass vaccinations, so that we can truly return to normal."
3418,"(Source : Fully immunized parents of 2 young kids, and wife is currently battling cancer."
3419,"Kids are too young and have special needs to understand socially distancing and wearing masks, so we can’t send them back to school yet due to cases being really high."
3420,It's already happening in NYC!
3421,Kids spread worse than adults so yes you’re right they don’t spread like adults.
3422,Stop being such a negative nancy when its been clear pfizer has been exceeding expectations at every step.
3423,"Wait wait wait, every time I read about people who are asymptomatic it’s usually in the context of them never knowing they were sick in the first place and being shocked to find out they simply had covid at one point, but not of people being asymptomatic and then developing systems later on and/or dying."
3424,I listen to NPR regularly and I definitely got the message.
3425,Who cares?
3426,"No, I tested positive a week later."
3427,Just my luck.
3428,&gt; and kids ~~could~~ will die as a result.
3429,FTFY
3430,India has the vaccine.
3431,It costs $5.
3432,It’s not a supply issue either.
3433,It’s being handed out like candy there.
3434,It’s a politics issue.
3435,You realize there are many areas of the country where there has never been a mask mandate or hasn’t been one in months?
3436,Now that vaccines are available to everyone the rest of the county will not be far behind in dropping the mask mandates.
3437,"You can wear a mask for however long you want, that’s your prerogative but don’t expect many people to join you."
3438,"&gt; Because a partnership would give BioNTech more bodies, more resources, more money, and more locations to produce vaccines, thus greatly increasing vaccine production rate and being able to distribute the vaccine to more people."
3439,Gee its almost as if manufacturing and testing is something BioNTech couldn't do without pfizer.
3440,It’s wild the way this virus spikes
3441,I don't think we'll ever achieve global eradication of COVID.
3442,But we should be able to eliminate domestic spread (just like we have with a dozen+ diseases that still exist globally).
3443,"Animal reservoirs are an issue, but it is pretty clear that they are not a major one."
3444,The fact that several countries (e.g.
3445,"Australia, China, New Zealand, and others) achieved complete elimination of the disease shows that regular spread between animals to humans is not significant."
3446,"We have a peeing section in the public pool, neat."
3447,[removed]
3448,Good data doesn’t matter when people in power misuse or straight up ignore them.
3449,Which has been happening quite a bit and a certain group of people eat it hook line and sinker.
3450,&gt; BioNTech could have partnered with every company which is able to produce vaccines on a big scale.
3451,But they didn't.
3452,Get over it.
3453,Why would 2 shots be logistically challenging?
3454,You don't have to go to the same place
3455,Cool just a 1 in 3 chance of long covid instead
3456,That’s now how efficacy works.
3457,That’s not how any of that works.
3458,Something tells me that there is going to be one hell of a scandal that will be uncovered in the Michigan Legislature.
3459,Not an epidemiologist so correct me if I’m wrong but weren’t the major diseases that were eradicated ones that didn’t have an animal reservoir?
3460,That would make zero Covid harder.
3461,Not saying we shouldn’t try just out of spite though.
3462,I'm all for giving it to other countries now.
3463,The US needs to push other countries to get vaccinated before more variants get a chance to mutate.
3464,I'd specifically like to see a concentrated push in Brazil
3465,"I know someone who tested positive 2 weeks after the first dose, and while they had mild headache/sneezing in addition to the loss of taste and smell, they recovered fully within a few days."
3466,The problem is they need to do more than just releasing IP.
3467,They need to be waiving international property rights agreements and be providing support both logistically and know how.
3468,This should be a cooperative global health initiative and getting more factories online now is the only way to speed up the process.
3469,My uncle just passed away from COVID (UK variant) after getting the first dose.
3470,"He ended up on the ventilator for a week, then dialysis, then his body gave out."
3471,This virus is horrible man
3472,Because there's not as much urgency.
3473,"People would prefer if things were happening quicker, but you know... when you have a single community case in several months (that results in no further infections and no serious illness), you tend not to panic."
3474,Could you direct me to the info on it having disadvantages compared to other variants?
3475,"I don’t not believe you, just would like to see what that’s about."
3476,Thanks!

3488,"&gt; anything to end this pandemic

Lowering vaccine hesitancy, by emphasizing that vaccinated people can live normal lives, would help end this pandemic."
3489,"There's always going to be holdouts that won't get vaccinated, but that's not the people we're trying to reach."
3490,There's still plenty of people on the fence
3491,“Culture of masks” really makes me angry.
3492,It’s way more about symbolism than effectiveness at this point.

3496,"Yeah, our governor in MD is an R despite MD being blue and basically most of his “pandemic response” he got credited for was a publicity stunt for a presidential run."
3497,"He forced schools to re-open later well before people started getting vaccinated at large, MD unemployment distribution is one of the top 3 slowest in the country, he blew a lot of our state money on “negotiated” faulty South Korean testing kits when an American company offered him the working kits for cheaper (publicity stunt), and MD vaccine distribution started out pretty slow at first."
3498,Did they give him remdesivir?
3499,Did you read my comment?
3500,I know more people that refuse to get the vaccine that will get it.
3501,So it is a race between vaccinations and mutations.
3502,"I think at this point the virus wins and we will live with it, but the race isn't over yet."
3503,Hopefully as it mutates it becomes more cold like (harmless).
3504,"So vaccines at this point will continue to save lives, I guess that is the point."
3505, I wear a mask because I go out and do dope activities.
3506,If I stayed locked in my house why would I ever wear a mask
3507,Fauci hinted at that being the case yesterday and he’s mister “abundance of caution”.
3508,In NZ people were relatively loose with the rules and there was very little actual enforcement of them as well.
3509,"We've never even had a mask mandate, just a recommendation at the highest alert levels."
3510,Generally about 1/3 to 1/2 the people in a supermarket would be wearing a mask during the strictest lockdowns.
3511,"But the rules we did have were so strict that even though people pushed the boundaries and a minority totally ignored them, it was enough to cut the R0 to 0.4 and kill off the virus."
3512,"You set very strict rules, then take a relatively relaxed enforcement regime and have a strong public health campaign playing to people's sense of responsibility and their patriotism to encourage compliance rather than force it."
3513,Almost no one was actually arrested for breaking lockdown rules in NZ.
3514,"And Kiwis are not generally rule-following, compliant people like the Germans or Japanese."
3515,I’d say a phased reopening with the last restrictions to go in July or august depending on vaccine uptake and covid stats.
3516,Zero COVID is completely realistic if enough people get shots.
3517,That's literally all it takes.
3518,"Doesn't mean we have to wait for zero cases to end all restrictions (it will take at least a year to eliminate endemic spread via herd immunity), but zero COVID is definitely the goal and 100% achievable."
3519,"That said, I agree OP is a bit alarmist."
3520,"We don't have to wait till ""zero COVID"" to start fully enjoying life without restrictions."
3521,"That said, in many states COVID cases are still very high and caution should be used, even when vaccinated."
3522,"For example, even with the vaccine, I would definitely avoid indoor dining in any state that still has high rates of spread (e.g."
3523,Michigan being a great example).
3524,There is no better protection than low case spread.
3525,"As an example, in Israel, it is safer to be an unvaccinated person today than it was to be vaccinated at their peak."
3526,"Cases in Israel are down 98% from early January, which exceeds most estimated protection from the vaccine (90-95% from symptoms, 87%-99% from hospitalization)."
3527,"In addition to being personally protective, the vaccine is the tool that helps us get to very low case loads which further reduces risk."
3528,Shhh.
3529,I agree but this kind of stuff fuels the fears of a big segment of the population.
3530,Wahh!!
3531,I don't want a new normal.
3532,That makes me feel a little better.
3533,I hope your relatives are feeling better!
3534,"Honestly, as a teacher, I think one of the main reasons there wasn't more spread this year is because of the correct decision we made to have a hybrid program."
3535,It was the best compromise that kept health and education on an even keel.
3536,"I suspect it will be a mistake to bring all the kids back in to the buildings at once, especially as I've heard from multiple kids that they are travelling, having guests from out of state etc."
3537,"Also, there is no denying the variants are more contagious and affect children more."
3538,There is evidence the kids are feeling fatigued and teachers have not kept after protocols because of their own fatigue.
3539,It's potentially a recipe for disaster.
3540,The layout in my room is going to resemble sardines in a tin.
3541,I am not yet vaccinated so I plan to take my classes outdoors as much as possible.
3542,I will continue wearing my n95 and hope for the best.

3546,And those people.. are selfish idiots.
3547,"Adult population, right?"
3548,Since there's a lot of under-16s who still can't get it.
3549,You’re assuming there’s no overlap between those who had covid and those who are getting the vaccine.
3550,"Thus far, every person I know who had confirmed or suspected covid is getting the vaccine."
3551,"To be clear, I don’t think every person with covid will get vaccinated."
3552,I just think the overlap is larger than a lot of us might think it is.
3553,&gt; If vaccines aren’t going to return things to normal then what’s the point?
3554,Not OP but the point is to save lives.
3555,Just because someone is a “health official” doesn’t give them the right to remake the world according their whims.
3556,Resist a world where hypochondriacs decide whether you’re allowed to leave your home or socialize with other people.
3557,Pew’s data does a nice job of tracking changes over time.

3562,"I did food delivery during the early pandemic days, you best believe there were parties."
3563,How is that gonna work when for the last week or so we keep hearing reports that India stops exporting vaccines because they don’t have enough atm?
3564,I’m a bit confused.
3565,Every now and then the large corporation I work for puts up an internal blog post about COVID or vaccine news.
3566,And I so enjoy going to the comment section a few days later to see the absolute dumpster fire of crazy conspiracy theories that have resulted.
3567,&gt; Really the big change that needs to be made is that people can work from home in those conditions (assuming you work in a job where that accommodation is manageable).

3579,Bharat Biotech and SII have been given $200 million and $500 million credit respectively to ramp up vaccine production.
3580,I'm officially 2 weeks out from the J&amp;J shot!
3581,"Love to see the US kicking ass with these vaccinations

I thought I wouldn't be vaccinated til fall at best"
3582,"You think we will ""cap out"" at 50-60% of all adults?"
3583,We are already above 50% and are averaging about 1.8 million first doses every day.
3584,The biggest group of concern was 50-64.
3585,"Still highly vulnerable but less likely to have experienced mass death of friends than 65+, more conservative, and make up a higher proportion of rural areas."
3586,And in the last week they went from 50.7% to 57% with first doses.
3587,"Yeah, you've been able to partially reopen more quickly, but I'd say there's a fair chance we'll only be a couple weeks behind by the end of June."
3588,"&gt; For that, we need actual sick time."
3589,"If this year has proven anything, no we don't, not for all positions."
3590,A large number of jobs can be done from home &amp; allowing people who are feeling under the weather to isolate should be the norm.

3605,Just wanted to thank you for standing up for our fair home - stay safe out there!
3606,❤️
3607,Entire India already facing Vaccines shortage since last week.
3608,Now we opened up vaccinations for all.
3609,Hope there are more Vaccines in pipeline since Serum can't handle this load.
3610,Sputnik should come in May.
3611,"It's not on J&amp;J, the gov selected this facility even though they were not certified."
3612,The fed gov owns this one.
3613,The feds signed them up eight years ago and they still haven't achieved certification from the FDA.
3614,Regarding a Dr notes.
3615,I called in shock on a Wednesday and was told that afternoon I would need a DRs note to return to work.
3616,I said fine.
3617,The following morning I was called and asked why I wasnt at work and I told my manager the office told me I needed a DRs note so I made an appointment to see the Dr. that same afternoon... the first available appointment was Tuesday morning so after my appointment ill bring over the note.
3618,"Expect me around noon,."
3619,I would also hope that this is serves as a warning to antivax parents that vaccination is worth it when it becomes available for children (though I'm not optimistic anything will reach that crowd).
3620,Stay healthy!
3621,The pandemic is going to be over soon whether you like it or not :)
3622,Downvoted you because the OP was a joke comment that you took in a weird direction.
3623,You don’t need to be so public about your personal revenge fantasies.
3624,"They are the same ones shouting ""masks don't work""--they do--and spreading lies and misinformation because they can't handle a piece of fabric near their face longer than Ron Swanson can eat a banana."
3625,What the actual fuck.
3626,Someone needs to take their kindergarten biology lessons again
3627,Because our public health messaging has been terrible.
3628,And this almost certainly underestimates the number of those getting vaccinated.
3629,"He says 50 to 60%, when we already are at 50% (at least one dose)."
3630,Interesting
3631,[deleted]
3632,It’s not destigmatized.
3633,You’re gonna get weird looks a year from now “Mc Fap Commander.” (That’s hilarious.)
3634,This is good news :)
3635,I had a boss once tell me that I should have really left a note for someone to take care of something that I ended up being unable to take care of because I got food poisoning.
3636,Fuck that place.
3637,"yeah, wasn’t commenting on NZ at all, just that I know whether Latin American people count as “white” or not is something super contentious."
3638,"a lot of people have raised good arguments about how white passing =/= white, as most Latin Americans face enormous amounts of discrimination regardless."
3639,"can also speak to discrimination despite looking ethnically white as an Ashkenazi Jew, so given that a lot of activists say that the 60.1% figure is far more representative of the barriers that they face in the US than 76%, I do want to advocate for that when I can."

3643,*
3644,Link to those 10-30% studies?
3645,"Because nothing is ending it

The masks, closing business, staying home and now vaccines."
3646,Its another hoop to jump through to *maybe* get to normal.
3647,To get *some* normality back.
3648,"Nothing is ever good enough

The entire population of America could be vaccinated and Fauci would still be over cautious about the strains etc"
3649,"&gt;  however we are starting to ""hit the wall"" as they say."
3650,"The country will ""cap out"" at somewhere between 50-60% of all adults vaccinated 

Where are you getting this from?"
3651,We already have 50% vaccinated with at least one dose.
3652,"Sadly I don't think we'll get to 90%, but you're basically saying pretty much no one new will be vaccinated."
3653,"It's amazing, thinking how this week, 1/3 adults and 2/3 seniors will be fully vaccinated in the US, and 40% of the entire population will have one dose."
3654,I thought at the beginning of the pandemic india was doing really well
3655,"&gt;	I am not waiting for zero cases to do normal stuff like dining out or movie theater, but definitely not now and waiting a little bit longer as I live in LA which is one of the higher covid count places."
3656,"With young child and older parents and grandparents in my circle, there are no need for me to eat at a restaurant to increase the chance of catching it when take out tastes perfectly fine to me."
3657,"We are at the last stretch, now is the worst time, figuratively, to get it."
3658,Given the people around you that’s a completely reasonable take.
3659,I won’t be netting up and doing things with my family and extended family till they are fully vaccinated and cases drop in their area.
3660,"We dont have many vaccinated patients, so we dont scan them."
3661,"(go get your jab, vaccines work) Lung destruction happens in every infected person."
3662,"How many of the tissue gets destroyed, varies by the virus strain, patients immune system, vaccinated or not."
3663,"We have asymptomatic patients (no fever, no cough, nothing whatsoever only slightly tired) with covid stage 3 or 4."
3664,Usually immunocompromised persons.
3665,&gt;I wish we had the transparency the Swedish or Dutch governments have regarding vaccine deliveries and timetables.
3666,This so much.
3667,Even the Irish national broadcaster has to use their plans to try and figure out what's going on here.
3668,I just sit understand why it has to be so secretive.
3669,But he forgot to mention vArIaNTs.
3670,9/10.
3671,Studies on the population as a whole find a 10-30% rate of long Covid regardless of initial severity or hospitalization.
3672,"Even for people who don’t report long Covid symptoms, there is evidence of widespread long damage in Covid patients and we don’t know how (if at all) those messy chest X-rays will correlate with actual health effects."
3673,I will be DELIGHTED when vaccination levels are high enough and new cases are low enough that we can end mask mandates and go back to normal.
3674,"That said, the destigmatization of masks might be one of the most significant long-term wins for public health emerging from this pandemic."
3675,It will now be NO PROBLEM for someone to wear a mask if they are immune compromised or if they just want to feel safer riding the subway during flu season.
3676,This will save countless lives.
3677,I think we're talking about different things.
3678,"I'm talking about the rate of death in the breakthrough cases occurring in fully vaccinated people, not the *overall* rate of death in the vaccinated population, which is obviously going to be *a lot* lower."
3679,"It's the people calling in sick when they aren't that cause all the problems, real or not, just the perception is a problem."
3680,And making someone get a sick note if they just had a cold for a day or two is also ridiculous which stops some people from even bothering to stay home sick.
3681,"Hire good people, treat them well and if someone abuses the sick days just deal with that specific person instead of punishing everyone."
3682,"I didn't agree with it, but an earlier job got rid of sick days and added 5 days vacation."
3683,"Had they already been competitive with time off, then maybe.."
3684,But that was only competitive if they'd also offered sick days.
3685,"Eventually the company got bought, vacation stayed and we got sick days which was nice."
3686,Goddamit J&amp;J...
3687,[deleted]
3688,I think it is 2 weeks after second dosw
3689,you slept for 30 hours after each dose?
3690,Cap.
3691,Let's assume that a gigantic number of people get their shots today.
3692,"For these people, the last shots will be those that get the second dose of the Moderna vaccine in 4 weeks (May 17)."
3693,"All of these people will be fully protected on Memorial Day, and most every adult who wants the vaccine will be robustly protected by then."
3694,This Memorial Day is going to be absolutely fucking lit.
3695,Help me out.
3696,A local nursing home had 10 new cases .
3697,"3 were unvaccinated and 4-5 were asymptomatic, but had shots."
3698,Doesn’t that mean the vaccine worked in those people.
3699,They have to be tested every few days there regardless.
3700,But wouldn’t you test positive for a day or two while your immune system with the vaccine fought it off without you getting sick?
3701,"I think that if you asked people from those countries, how it works in practice is different from how it works on paper"
3702,"&gt; About 50% of individuals were vaccinated for the flue

But how many of them were chimney sweeps?"
3703,"&gt;The country will ""cap out"" at somewhere between 50-60% of all adults vaccinated

I think (hope) it will be closer to 80%."
3704,We're already at 50% having had their first shot and doesn't seem to be slowing down quite yet.

3714,This guy gets on the internet just to be pissed off at things.
3715,"Like, what's your angle?"
3716,Imagine using this moronic line of reasoning on the 145 countries that make it work.
3717,They'd laugh at you.
3718,And some of those people got infected *before* they got vaccinated.
3719,Do you want to end up with mandatory vaccine passports?
3720,Because that's how you end up with mandatory vaccine passports.
3721,Idk.
3722,My 14yo and her friends are chomping at the bit to get their shots.
3723,Poor critter was so scared for me.
3724,She started to cry after I got my 2nd from relief.
3725,Makes me tear up thinking about how scared many of the younger teens are of losing their parents...
3726,"I have relatives who got infected after the first dose
Although I can say that the vaccine definitely decreased the lethality of virus"
3727,"I have a feeling this statement will age poorly, I think it will be more like 70% of our country that will get a vaccine"
3728,[removed]
3729,"At this point, it feels like the thought process is, ""well, we said 6ft."
3730,"Since it doesn't REALLY depend on that amount of distance and matters more about other factors in the rooms, then lowering it to 3ft would really make no difference."""
3731,"But the 6ft has prevented more students from being in a small room--at the detriment of their education, but to the benefit of those in the room."
3732,It's just all so frustrating.
3733,Vaccines for children can't come fast enough.

3740,*
3741,I did the loop from Anchorage to Fairbanks to Valdez and back to Anchorage.
3742,Highlight of the trip was a trip to Katmai National Park to watch bears feasting on salmon at Brooks Falls (it would be awesome if you could book a stay at the lodge there!).
3743,"We did glacier landing at Talkeetna, tour of Denali National Park, fly fishing, several nature cruises and lots of hikes."
3744,"If we had more time, we would have visited Homer and Seaward."
3745,Or school.
3746,Schools require doctors notes for excused absences.
3747,Professors refuse to let students reschedule exams when they are ill.
3748,So I am back on here after being temp banned by the automod for what I think is a silly reason.
3749,I didn't fight it though because I figured I needed a mental break from here anyway.
3750,"In the 30 days I was banned: my parents got their first shots, the rest of my bridal party and their spouses got either their first or second doses, and I myself got my first shot on friday."
3751,And my fiance and his parents are now fully vaccinated.
3752,"We sent out invitations to our June wedding and most everyone is saying yes, except for a couple people who have work entanglements."
3753,"Meaning, no one is not attending because of covid fears."
3754,People are ready to get back to life.
3755,I had a huge mindset shift after my first dose that I wasn't expecting.
3756,Like this giant weight was lifted off my shoulders - I now have a personal end date to this madness.
3757,A true light at the end of the tunnel.
3758,"It's not over, but we're getting there pretty damn fast in the US."
3759,I am so so so grateful to be here right now.
3760,"It's been proven many times that it's possible to contract covid more than once.... so, no."
3761,"Regardless of your beliefs, the fact is: Some people don't feel comfortable with the vaccine."
3762,They're not buying these to save money.
3763,"They are buying them because they want the freedom to travel, go to sporting events, and live their lives without getting vaccinated."
3764,A bit late but India has finally decided to financially support their domestic vaccine produces after months of requests.
3765,"4500 crore = 45 billion 

3000 crore INR ~ $400.5 million USD to the Serum Institute of India (worlds largest vaccine producer)

1500 crore INR ~ $200.2 million USD to Bharat Biotec"
3766,You've been reading this sub too much.
3767,It is *so* minuscule
3768,"""OMG I'm so sick but I can't want to save my time for a long weekend!"""
3769,"Thanks, sincerely."
3770,"It's a relatively selfless act for a younger person to get vaccinated, I think, because younger people are much less likely to develop serious cases."
3771,So for them it's more so a case of doing what's right for society.
3772,"Well, society thanks you!"
3773,Ground glass opacities are typical in covid infection of the lungs.
3774,"Once you see it, you distinguish it immediately."
3775,"You see it in every covid patient, doesnt matter their age."
3776,Every scan is abnormal if done on day 8-9.
3777,The percentage involved varies with the individual and when (what day of symptoms) was the ct done.
3778,Also it goes hand in hand with the symptoms.
3779,"Better symptoms, less groundglass lesions."
3780,"Worse symptoms, more tissue involvement."
3781,A good imaging doctor can tell you if its in an active state (acute) or subacute (no virus replication) or already post covid.
3782,Grow up.
3783,"&gt; Since the government has said they won't mandate vaccination, industry and businesses are what will save us."
3784,At least until state governments outlaw requiring vaccinations.
3785,I can see that happening in places like Florida and Texas.
3786,Have you ever had to manage people before or be responsible for making sure your place of work is fully staffed?
3787,Entirely made up by OP
3788,We (the US) constantly bump up against ideological differences in the population that make public policy really difficult.
3789,On the second dose?
3790,Because the CDC refuses to say that Vaccines significantly prevent infection and transmission.
3791,We have to run around in this stupid theater pretending these masks are actually doing anything instead of being honest about the reality of the situation.
3792,This gives the doom sayers all they need to keep spreading fear propaganda.
3793,I have no idea why but that squirt of sanitizer part made me chuckle lol
3794,I'm currently still wrecked (day 3 of second dose).
3795,Felt like I had the flu.
3796,"Agreed, it’s hard to know how to evaluate certain symptoms."
3797,There are also reports of people experience quick relief of symptoms following vaccination and it is hard to know what to make of those.
3798,We definitely need to keep studying.
3799,Snopes is known to be completely unreliable
3800,Fucking hell.
3801,Im scared to get my second dose cos apparently that is when youll get fucked by the side effects.
3802,&gt;I don't need to worry about anything?
3803,I agree with these last few words.
3804,Great news - see you in Monument Valley this fall.
3805,Are they female?
3806,I’m a young female and BC blood clots are less fatal than this one.
3807,"Since they actually know that there is a sound treatment I’ll rethink, but I know every needle has risks but a lot that are saying “I’ll take AZ” is male."
3808,*cries in 3rd world country*
3809,This is what it’s all about.
3810,This is why im optimistic
3811,Read it again.
3812,The 75% was &gt;= 7 days after does 2 which should be when you have the strongest protection.
3813,What kind of reaction?
3814,"I was planning on being sick as hell and having things like Ensure on hand, ice cream, pain meds, etc."
3815,I saw in another thread that J&amp;J had reached like 500k/day at it's peak and dropped to like 50k/day.
3816,"We made up some of that ground with moderna/pfizer, but it took a pretty massive hit when J&amp;J went away."
3817,At very least eligibility was already open for 16+ in a lot of states long before today.
3818,I'm still a little fearful too cause of the variants.
3819,"About people more likely to get in car accidents, true now but I don't know if it will change later and I'm sure I won't know when the risk is too great until after it's already too great."
3820,"That said, I'm hanging out with family indoors now and without masks even though I turn the air purifier up full blast."
3821,I'm not going to gyms still.
3822,There would be large numbers of false positives.
3823,"The dog will be spotting people left and right, most of which won't actually have it."
3824,"96% accuracy means 4% inaccuracy, which means in some public setting with thousands of people you are going to get dozens of false positives."
3825,Tell them the 1 year trial data will be available soon and hopefully that helps.
3826,[deleted]
3827,&gt; I’ve worked in a corporate setting for a very long time and the amount of people that think it’s a badge of honor to come in sick is absolutely ludicrous.
3828,I'm hopeful that with the experience we've gotten over the last year dealing with remote work that these diehards will at least stay home and work and take meetings via Zoom.
3829,"Like, yeah, keep working dude."
3830,Just don't do it in the office.
3831,I did last last Friday!
3832,I used to be that guy that would go to work sick.
3833,"I would stay in my office though and not interact with people and thought by going in sick, my job would be like ""wow even sick this guy comes in and works hard""."
3834,Now I look back and think what the fuck was I doing.
3835,Interesting.
3836,I just had a sore arm for a few days and mild chills.
3837,Crazy how everyone reacts differently to covid-19 and the vaccines.
3838,The risk calculus incorporates the use of seatbelts and car seats.
3839,Not sure what your point is.

3848,That seems entirely expected and not particularly scary.
3849,Yes...
3850,I got the deafening blaring notice on my cell phone.
3851,Disgusting
3852,"The moment you make masking ""mandatory if you're not vaccinated"" you're actually making it ""recommended but not mandatory if you're not vaccinated"" because no business is checking vaccine status of everyone who comes in unmasked."
3853,And the people least likely ot get vaccinated are probably the most likely to toss the mask off as soon as masking isn't actually enforced.

3868,But they don't want to do that because it will cut profits for Big Pharma
3869,Takes a special kind of person I guess.
3870,I'm pretty empathetic towards people but I still don't think I'd be willing to be reinfected
3871,I guess I don't think there's any ethical obligation to hold the risk of disease transmission as low as possible at the cost of your own wellbeing.
3872,"If you were proposing going despite feeling ill/having tested positive/having close contact with a positive test, then I'd say that's unethical."
3873,"And if you were proposing doing some extraordinarily risky or caring for a unvaccinated high-risk person, maybe it would make sense to wait, but you're proposing walking around outside an extra day at a theme park that you'll be going to later in the week anyway."

3880,"And I guess I'm just going to hope my 6 year old survives it, even if B117 seems more dangerous to kids, because I don't see them approving it for her age group anytime this year."
3881,70% vaccination rate
3882,But where is there any indication that this occurring?
3883,So far all of the evidence we have so far is that the variants we have so far are recognized by T-cells.
3884,Hate to be the one to break it to you but the people who would lie about being vaccinated have been living normally for a year now.
3885,Are you vaccinated?

3898,"I don't consider living a normal life to be dangerous to me, but a respiratory infection the severity of COVID is certainly given my lung condition."
3899,"Seeing as there is still an active pandemic happening with the aforementioned respiratory illness circulating rampantly, with case numbers increasing, that makes living a normal life to be significantly more dangerous to me for now."
3900,And to countless other Americans who may or may not be aware of conditions they have that make them higher risk.
3901,"Or even some who have no such conditions, but for unknown reasons will be killed by this virus or left permanently harmed by it."
3902,We're weeks away from adults at least being able to be vaccinated if they want it and completing that course.
3903,I don't understand the rush to open before we achieve that when it's so close.
3904,It feels like pulling into the intersection when the other light turns yellow--wait two more seconds and your light will be green and there will be significantly lower chance of being t-boned even though in theory the yellow light means people should be slowing down to stop.
3905,"They are heading into winter down there so cases would go up from that alone, compared with lower numbers in summer."
3906,Hopefully as more people get their second dose the wave will subside.
3907,"Doubt it, my 15th was in March"

3909,The conversation around mandatory vaccination is like walking into a room full of TNT.
3910,Lmao these articles know exactly what they're doing with these headlines
3911,I wonder if you'll turn 16 first or get approved at 15 first.
3912,"At least in this context, I blame the reporter who wrote this article vs the health experts."
3913,It's possible that they just took some quotes out of greater context about how kids CAN get sick and Dr's wanting people to not just pretend like nothing is happening.
3914,I'd argue that this journalist was pre-emptive with their story and then found the quotes to make it happen.
3915,First dose first works.

3922,I live in the DMV super population dense so I doubt I’d get it any walk ins.
3923,Only walk ins I know are 2 hours away.
3924,The maryland preregistration aint tell me shit to schedule yet haha.
3925,But ya know according to reddit its available lol
3926,&gt; The UK has 95% uptake in the vulnerable 50+ and the US is at 80%.
3927,It will be harder in the US.
3928,"It will be harder in the US, more vaccine skepticism here, but the UK's first-dose priority plays a role here in getting a larger proportion of people with 1 dose."
3929,US is well ahead on fraction of people fully vaccinated.
3930,&gt; the younger people are taking scraps while the older people get first pick.
3931,Older people are much more likely to need hospitalization if they get COVID.
3932,If you have a finite amount of hospital capacity then vaccinating the over 60s makes sense.
3933,I'm so irritated.
3934,"My sister and brother refuse to get the vaccine because ""they don't want to try something that was rushed"" smh"
3935,"Serious question - those of you eligible now and still not planning to get it, why?"
3936,God speed.
3937,Drink lots of water and take it easy.
3938,Moderna #2 knocked me out.
3939,I've read a lot of these papers and know groups like NASCAR &amp; the NBA have already used dogs to help sniff out COVID+ people.
3940,What I haven't seen discussed is whether or not dogs can catch COVID doing this job?
3941,Does anyone know if using them to sniff out COVID cases puts them at high risk of catching it?
3942,Valid concern.
3943,I am hoping for the best.
3944,Do you know the difference between lowering quickly and lowering slowly?
3945,100 is not very many.
3946,Thats the Canadian way.
3947,"Bonus points if youre old, rich and white."
3948,I would also avoid people like that.
3949,Death rate is only part of the problem.

3951,Think of others and wear a mask.
3952,"Spread in schools that are open is at community or lower and the primary vectors have been faculty, not students."
3953,The data does not backup the articles now being pushed about children and covid.
3954,"I had Covid less than 90 days before I got my first dose, and so the first dose had the immune response of the second one for most people."
3955,Second dose is gonna suck aassssssss.
3956,But then I’ll be able to go to whitewater so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
3957,That’s a pretty stupid comparison.
3958,"People are going to continually die from heart disease for decades to come, but COVID is a once in a generation (at least) event."
3959,The US might end up reaching herd immunity and the amount of people who’ll die of it will be minuscule.
3960,Heart disease will be around for as long as there are obese people.
3961,"Good job, looking forward in Canada to achieve the same soon."
3962,"&gt;That said, my main point is that I’m not convinced that the messaging from the CDC is actually what’s driving reluctance to take the vaccine."
3963,"There is also what might better be called ""vaccine laziness""."
3964,"There are people who will get the vaccine, but they aren't going to spend hours online trying to find an appointment every day."
3965,"Any ""nothing changes"" messaging makes the bar that much lower for the effort people are going to put in."
3966,How am I possibly taking into account 100% infection rate?
3967,I literally just gave a real example of relative risk (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated) in two different exposure environments.
3968,It's a straight reading of vaccine efficacy.
3969,I am not fearmongering.
3970,No where in any post have I fearmongered.
3971,I am incredibly optimistic about where we are today and where we are going.
3972,The crisis stage of the pandemic is over.
3973,We're solidly in a permanent return to normalcy stage.
3974,But ignoring facts and case loads is premature.
3975,The 5800 out of 77 million is a bit misleading and runs contrary to every study done to date in terms of efficacy.
3976,Why?
3977,Because breakthrough tracking is immature at this point.
3978,The CDC has 5800 *confirmed* breakthrough cases.
3979,But they are still working to collect data.
3980,"Most testing sites only recently started asking about vaccination status, and the CDC is relying on voluntary data collection to track breakthrough cases."
3981,"We're going to get better here but 5800 is guaranteed to be an undercount, especially today."
3982,"And more importantly, the death rate in the UK has been very low for a while now."
3983,"They may not be much (or at all) ahead of the EU in wrapping up their vaccination campaign, but their quick start has benefited them hugely."
3984,[removed]
3985,Honestly the answer is probably yes.
3986,"Some states are opening things up to non residents soon, if not already."
3987,"On June 1st, Alaska will start offering vaccines to tourists."
3988,"So, if you want to road trip through the Yukon..."
3989,"Yup, totally agree, and as I said THIS DEPENDS ON LOCATION (caps lock for the people in the back saying “it’s extremely easy to get”)."
3990,"For me, it wasn’t difficult, I was lucky to have a FEMA site in my city and just showed up with no appointment to get a shot."
3991,This isn’t the case for the majority of Americans who are stuck with an overrun appointment system.
3992,"I wouldn’t spend hours a day looking either, and it’s understandable to not want to drive hours for the vaccine."
3993,"I imagine you want a shot so I hope you can get one in your local area soon, also, when you go to your local pharmacy or grocery store that offers the shot, you can always ask them if they can give you one, at my local Publix, they’ve offered me the shot multiple times but I refuse because I’m already vaccinated obviously."
3994,It's only a pain because the demand is high
3995,you are way overthinking this.
3996,go to epcot and enjoy yourself.
3997,Colorado is doing it similarly and it's the only way that makes any sense.
3998,Why not?
3999,Cases are still at their current trajectory.
4000,They’ve remained unchanged from their current trends.
4001,There you said it yourself the experts say get whatever vaccine you can.
4002,All the lies about J&amp;J efficiency numbers actually being better than what they are is because they dont want people turning down J&amp;J if that's the only vaccine being offered when they arrive at their appointment.
4003,Your numbers don’t add up at ALL.
4004,"Where are you pulling this from, months ago?"
4005,"We’re already past 50%, and that’s with several major groups being unable to get the vaccine."
4006,"The full paper, available [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253167v1.full), cites many of the previous studies and discusses their contradictory findings."
4007,The vaccine targets specific proteins on spikes that are not hidden by glycan shielding.
4008,If those spikes evolve to be shielded then we have to develop new vaccines.
4009,While this is going on our bodies are not experiencing coronaviruses of any sort and our memory t - cells are forgetting how to combat these antigens in a quick manner.

Cross reactivity is how our bodies normally fight diseases."
4011,&gt; Let's assume that a gigantic number of people get their shots today.
4012,I don't think that's a very reasonable assumption (at least I don't think it will be significantly higher than the number of vaccines on previous days).
4013,"Most of the states with high availability but low demand have already opened up to their state's general population, so we don't expect to see a shift in daily vaccinations there as a result of this."
4014,"State with high demand (that previously needed to prioritize certain groups over general population) have already been near fully capacity for weeks, and will continue being near full capacity."
4015,"My eligibility opened up today, but the earliest date I could book was in the second week of May."
4016,"FWIW, I think the U.S. is doing an incredible job at the vaccine rollout and that this news is a huge milestone, but it doesn't actually suggest that there'll be a sudden surge in vaccinations."
4017,"Sure, there will absolutely be individuals and the statistic outliers, but our vaccination schemes primary goals was to reduce the load on hospitals and reduce deaths."
4018,Both of those goals have been achieved.
4019,It isn't 'mission accomplished' but the most vital areas have now been covered.
4020,"And we are still doing ~450k a day, which will hopefully step up in May"
4021,"&gt; how they'd find someone who is willing to be reinfected lol

Probably published an advertisement."
4022,"I mean, for a young healthy person the chances of complications are very low and finding people willing to do it shouldn't be a problem."
4023,"&gt; But globally speaking, it's far from over."
4024,Globally speaking it hasn't even started.
4025,Most of the Covid deaths have so far been concentrated in rich countries.
4026,India and Brazil show where the global poor is headed.
4027,"Next up, sub Saharan Africa."
4028,I get that but it's a different situation now right?
4029,"With a pandemic that we still don't have under control, it's important to be able to trust the information on who is or is not vaccinated."
4030,This isn't a dumb question at all!
4031,"Blood constantly exists in a state of coagulation (clotting) vs. anticoagulation, like a tug of war."
4032,Some things tip the balance in one direction or the other: a big one is Factor III/Tissue Factor (TF).
4033,"It lines our blood vessels and is exposed to our blood when the vessels are damaged, like in trauma."
4034,This sets off a bunch of stuff that ultimately creates a clot to prevent us bleeding out and start the repair process!
4035,"It's hard to say exactly how deadly blood clots are, as we usually find them when they're clinically significant (when they're big enough to cause symptoms)."
4036,"We sometimes find them incidentally, like when doing an ultrasound for something else."
4037,"As to how we find them, if they're big enough they can block blood flow causing a back-up behind them leading to things like a swollen arm or leg."
4038,"They can be very dangerous if they're a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as these can become dislodged and travel through your heart into your lungs, where they become stuck, forming a pulmonary embolus."
4039,Now you have a big chunk of your lungs not getting blood flow or providing oxygen to your body.
4040,"None of this is talking about blood clots in your arteries, which tend to be rarer, but much more dangerous."
4041,Sorry for the wall of text!
4042,"No, all of us rich countries dropped the ball by trying to fight over and bid over the vaccines instead of all standing together as governments telling corporations no we’re going to buy in bulk in a joint multi lateral operation, and share resources as well as methods for efficient distribution."

The National Institutes of Health will fund a large, randomized, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to test several existing prescription and over-the-counter medications for people to self-administer to treat symptoms of COVID-19."
4087,"Part of the [Accelerating COVID‑19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/activ) public–private partnership, the ACTIV-6 trial aims to provide evidence-based treatment options for the majority of adult patients with COVID-19 who have mild-to-moderate symptoms and are not sick enough to be hospitalized."
4088,NIH will provide an initial investment of $155 million in funding for the trial.
4089,"“While we’re doing a good job with treating hospitalized patients with severe disease, we don’t currently have an approved medication that can be self-administered to ease symptoms of people suffering from mild disease at home, and reduce the chance of their needing hospitalization,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “ACTIV-6 will evaluate whether certain drugs showing promise in small trials can pass the rigor of a larger trial.”

Several drugs currently are [recommended](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapeutic-management/) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, including the antiviral drug remdesivir, the anti-inflammatory baricitinib, and corticosteroids."
4090,"Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of intravenous monoclonal antibodies in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for severe disease."
4091,"However, medications that can be self-administered at home to reduce COVID-19 symptoms are critically needed."
4092,"The problem isn't who needs it more, it's that they're only giving it to 55+ and allowing them to deny AZ without allowing those younger to take the so called scraps"
4093,I had a legit fever on my second shot.
4094,I'd do it again though
4095,I can’t imagine fighting to schedule an appointment.
4096,"Got to give it to Indiana you register online, pick out the location / vaccine type."
4097,It gives you an appointment and then show up.
4098,I was there 22 minutes from registration to walkout including my 15 minute wait after getting the vaccine.

4103,I'm sure there are places other than Serbia that you can visit -- he only went there because he had family that lived there.
4104,But younger people are going to have to live decades with the long-term effects if they get infected.

4108,&gt;In NYC and NJ there are thousands of available appointments and no one taking them.
4109,Why would you lie about this
4110,I don’t think that you are compromising safety given that Covid19 is vastly more deadly than any possible complication (given the amount of data we already had when they’d stopped it) with the vaccine.
4111,"They aren’t decoupled, you have to get the misinformed people you don’t care about vaccinated or else you don’t get herd immunity."

4117,"She may have been fearful before (and I'd even say that was likely), but this is a whole new and very concerning level."
4118,Same here.
4119,Kept waiting for side effects and nothing happened.
4120,It has very little to do with how much free time people have.
4121,It has everything to do with age-based risk factors and the fact that only people in predefined age brackets were allowed to receive the vaccine.
4122,This is a painfully obvious example of how correlation does not imply causation.
4123,Perfectly healthy?
4124,It means you’ve got a shit immune system.

4138,Long as you don’t expect everyone else whose vaccinated to continue restrictions like wearing masks then that’s fine take your time.

4149,"I expect that both states will have high enough vaccinations to reach herd immunity relatively soon, and I think that people will rightfully start thinking that its ridiculous to enter a crowded bar or restaurant while having to wear a mask (just to take it off 30 seconds later while sitting down)."
4150,"So while I wouldn't be surprised if on paper some states continue the mandate for a while, in practice indoor masking while probably slowly disappear over the summer."

4156,"You really think the main purpose of the vaccine is to protect other people, not yourself?"
4157,Isn't the purpose of the vaccine to reduce the chances of hospitalization of the person infected with covid?
4158,"Here in Florida,  got my husband vaccinated a few days before they opened up for 40+ because I'm pregnant and have a toddler at home."
4159,"Got called a ""line cutter"" too but there was literally no line to cut as I'm in a red area and half the people here don't even want vaccines."

Oh wait

4184,Didn't only like 300 people die yesterday?
4185,Seems like deaths have plummeted.

4187,"It’s a small sample size but this pretty recent study looked at the cd4+ and cd8+ and t-cell responses elicited by Pfizer and moderna: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.27.433180v1

Other than this, I’ve been on the search for any other recent info on vaccine t-cel responses and at every turn I get somebody who says “moderna doesn’t elicit cd8+” or “Pfizer has a a stronger cd8+ response” but it all seems to be based on the very early and preliminary info when they probably weren’t even really looking for this stuff."
4188,"So in conclusion, I totally agree with you and think you’re right."
4189,And also I’d love to see some more research into it as well.
4190,"The legislation you're talking about isn't ""common sense""."
4191,"Frankly, the use of the phrase is almost always disingenuous."
4192,You're assuming best case scenario with covid and worst case with vaccine.
4193,Seems disingenuous
4194,If you were eligible to get your shot in Phase 1 but haven’t yet then that’s on you.
4195,We’re done with slowing down vaccinations so that the “right” people can get them.
4196,Full steam ahead!
4197,1.
4198,It does make a lot of people immune.
4199,"Not every single person, but a huge percentage with these vaccines."
4200,Pretending otherwise is misinformation.
4201,2.
4202,"In the US at least, hospitals are not full."
4203,"Again, misinformation."
4204,Where has Fauci been.
4205,Look at the last year people were not wearing masks because of politics
4206,No we just love to see it
4207,Don't act all high and mighty.
4208,You are simply wrong.
4209,Feel free to act humbly about it or be indignant.
4210,Yeah.
4211,It’s not happening in 10 days.
4212,"But they’re going to approve j&amp;j soon, which will be produced domestically by biological E (600 million doses initially, but I think they’re scaling up)."
4213,"Sputnik v will initially be imported, but they’re hoping to produce 70 million doses a month by June (total production is 850 million doses to be made by different Pharma companies)."
4214,And we are waiting on phase three results from another Indian vaccine zycov-d (DNA plasmid platform like the Inovio vaccine).
4215,They’re planning on making about 250 million doses of the vaccine.
4216,Covovax (Indian version of the novavax vaccine) has been delayed to September.
4217,But I’m hoping they’ll be able to bring it out before that.
4218,A lot of pharma players in the country right now.
4219,So I’m expecting the vaccine situation to stabilise by June or July (hopefully).
4220,Edit: I forgot to add they’re ramping up production at SII (AZ) and Bharat biotech (covaxin) by roping in different Pharma companies and public sector companies.
4221,Vaccinated people don’t spread covid at any meaningful level.
4222,I’m done with the mask.
4223,NY just made it legally required.
4224,"At worst, you’re now required to get 1hr paid sick time for every 30 hours worked if your employer makes more than $1,000,000 and/or has more than 5 employees."
4225,My coworker stated he would get bored at home so figured he’d come to work sick but close his office door.
4226,Another would wander the halls declaring how ill she felt.
4227,I don’t think that’s going to be acceptable anymore.
4228,(They have sick time.)
4229,"Biden's government is getting things done, and we all just love to see it."
4230,Getting vaccinated is *a part* of keeping kids safe until they are elegible for vaccines.
4231,A fully vaxxed adult *can still contract and spread* coronavirus &amp; it's believed there may be an increased risk of asymptomatic spread.
4232,That's why it's important to continue to mask &amp; distance in public essential businesses.
4233,"""Concern"" sounds like a rational approach."
4234,"And sure, I was concerned too."
4235,But the way the FDA shut down J&amp;J over a tiny issue is reassuring that no such tiny issue exists for moderna/Pfizer.
4236,We've given a hundred million doses of each of those and have watched what's happened - it's no longer rushed at this point.
4237,"30,000 people have had them for 6 months now and the health of those people is higher than the rest of the population."
4238,The last is a key point.
4239,This probably isn't a choice between vaccination and nothing.
4240,"Unless a lot of antiscience people change their mind,  everyone who chooses not to get vaccinated is choosing to catch covid eventually."
4241,And hypertension is one of the biggest covid risk factors.
4242,I just got my second shot for Pfizer yesterday.
4243,Man the symptoms are hitting hard but I'm glad I was able to get it before everybody ran out of doses.
4244,I was similar.
4245,"Second shot only gave me a bit of tiredness and a sore arm, though less on both compared to the first."
4246,Okay so what is this lockdown in the UK you’re referring to?
4247,What period are you considering as the UKs lockdown and what restrictions do you consider strict?
4248,Restrictions changed over time so considering it as a singular set of rules is wrong.
4249,Yes it was strict at the start but then those restrictions ended 6 weeks ago.
4250,Claiming it’s very strict and very long ignores the fact that the most strict elements were not in place for a very long time as they ended 6 weeks ago.
4251,So better to have a chance of getting Corona and dealing with the potential long-term effects* of that.
4252,Makes sense.

4260,Pfizer could be approved under EUA as early as mid-May as Pfizer already wrapped their 12-15 trial.
4261,This coincides nicely when demand from adults should drop very low meaning a surplus of vaccines.
4262,Children under 12 will be much later.
4263,September may even be optimistic for them.
4264,But if we get enough over 12 year olds vaccinated it shouldn't matter too much as we should reach herd immunity (although concentrated pockets of unvaccinated under 12s in schools will probably preclude endemic spread eradication).
4265,For what?
4266,"In your imagination do Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J not develop vaccines without big government involvement?"
4267,"I have mine, but people in my family don't want it because they don't trust big pharma in the US."
4268,Where the heck are you in Canada?
4269,"I'm 32, living in Nova Scotia, and a teacher no less, and likely won't see a first shot until the end of May at the earliest and that's if the vaccine supply gets back on track."

4272,Corrected.
4273,This is a tough figure to determine.
4274,"Whatever the risk is, I think we should limit it with the vaccine."
4275,Mate I wasn't making a jab saying that my health is more important than anyone else's.

4300,This is the second article I’ve seen in as many days that claims that deaths are rising in Colorado.
4301,"Based on official state stats, the 7-day average of deaths is 2.7."
4302,That’s the lowest it’s been since September 10th.
4303,Ireland is an island.
4304,"Ok we have a border on it, but Vietnam is right beside China."
4305,Our population took it seriously.

4308,"Little bit round about, but yes he has."

4311,"Check Twitter feeds of patients begging for oxygen, beds, ventilator for their family members."

4313,This is reductionist.
4314,Not even saying we should keep most things closed down but this is sophomoric logic
4315,I think it's individual.
4316,I have a hard time breathing in masks when moving.
4317,I know my lungs are scarred already and I lost capacity from a previous virus so maybe that's why.
4318,But I start air trapping like crazy if an activity gets aerobic while wearing a mask.
4319,I can sit on my ass just fine though so I have sitting while wearing a mask down at least.
4320,Go on CVS at midnight.

4329,I hate to say it but it’s a lot like buying a PS5.
4330,I looked to fauci because he was the only reasonable and reliable one when the outbreak started.
4331,I think I hang onto that because he’s been the only one to deliver real science up until Biden got into office.
4332,My second dose is next week 🥳
4333,it's like the brand name or the no-name label cream cheese... they are basically the same thing =)

4339,They did not to help on the vaccine front.
4340,Throwing some of our money at vaccine manufacturers would have been done by anyone.
4341,He didn't talk about COVID once from Nov until he left in Jan.

4343,Fk Mr. golfer - he killed people.
4344,"Why, they are old enough to remember polio?"
4345,Nonsense.
4346,Here is one thing that breaks your pattern.
4347,"People in the medical field have a better reason to not partake in the 'control group', that is people who are first-line usually are better educated and more aware of the consequences and the necessary precaution to avoid these consequences than the general population."
4348,"Ergo, the general population would have a variety of reasons to have a completely different make-up than nurses and doctors and thus are NOT remotely represented."
4349,"And the point about random sampling is just that, representation."
4350,That's illegal under the ACA
4351,All so immensely unlikely its not even worth worrying about.
4352,"There is not shortage of vaccines in Israel, there is a shortage of people who want to get vaccinated."

really the only vaccines that the u.s. might give away in the next month or two are the oxford vaccines, and those will probably go to canada and mexico"
4377,Not sure why you're being downvoted.
4378,It's 5 weeks from the day you get your first phizer shot until you're fully vaccinated.
4379,3 weeks in between and then 2 weeks after is when you're fully vaccinated.
4380,Thought you made good points.
4381,Starting in 64 minutes all American adults will be eligible for vaccination.
4382,"Yes, I re-read your post and realized I was wrong &amp; you are correct, I am sorry &amp; have deleted my post."
4383,Also WTF is going on there?
4384,This makes sense!

4393,He has failed to adjust his messaging to the phase of this pandemic with widespread vaccines.
4394,He has been over-cautious to the point that he’s caused doubt about vaccine efficacy.
4395,"Our public health institutions are behind the curve in their guidance, so the public is making its own risk assessment."

4402,Almost all 16+ people who wanted to get vaccinated have done so.
4403,The current rate of first doses is really low.
4404,At this point I'd honestly be more interested in them figuring out what chemical the dogs are detecting and using that information to develop a non-canine test.

4432,It could be hard in many cases to prove outdoor transmission as either you don't know the person or you also interacted with them inside.
4433,If you are in a 10000 persons crowd without physical distance and masks you are going to see spread.
4434,If people keep some distance the spread will be reduced compared with indoors as the virus has a larger volume to disperse.
4435,Yes.

4445,The shot was so painless the first couple of hours I was beginning to question if they got me good enough or not.
4446,Definitely did.
4447,"Likewise, I haven't gotten the flu vaccine in like a decade but was signed up for the covid vaccine as soon as I was eligible."
4448,My biggest worry is that we might see a lot of apathy in the young adult population regarding vaccination that isn't even due to vaccine hesitancy itself but more just the thought that things are returning to normal and we're not high risk anyway.
4449,"Not sure the best method to combat that, but im already anecdotally seeing that with some of my own friends, kinda a ""why bother at this point"" sort of attitude."

4454,I hope in the next weeks and months the cases sharply decline.
4455,Because the 18-24 demographic is contributing to the rise in cases.
4456,Fingers crossed 🤞
4457,I wear the mask now during the pandemic because I care about protecting others.
4458,But once everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been vaccinated?

4488,"Less than 1% of confirmed COVID cases in children ended in a hospitalization, and even less in intensive care."
4489,The CDC keeps data on all of this.
4490,COVID was never a real risk to the average U18 person.

Didn’t sleep well that night due to anxiety of what side effects I will have
Saturday at 1pm I felt exhausted, took a nap, woke up and had a headache."
4520,Sunday I was a little tired after going to the store and took a nap.
4521,"Only side effects were fatigue, sore arm (feels mostly ok now) and a headache."
4522,"But I found a Facebook page about people who had terrible results happen (coincidently or not) after getting vaccinated, clots, strokes, neurological stuff, now I’m having awful anxiety about something happening to me from the vaccine/after the second shot"

4545,Oh fairs you're probably right.
4546,It must've been California.
4547,But either way I hope more 18-24 yr old get the vaccine so cases can plummet further
4548,[removed]
4549,Considering how there are still people waiting for their vaccine appointments it’s not just a personal problem.
4550,Pretty sure a lot of vaccines will find their way to Canada and Mexico when the US is mostly covered.
4551,Idk if you read what I wrote right.
4552,I was trying to say is I'm going to wear my mask in public indoor places but then go hangout with my vaccinated friends indoors at their houses as a vaccinated person.
4553,Public places I'll wear a mask cause it's public but while I'm with friends (not in public) that are fully vaccinated I'm going maskless and back to normal life.
4554,Does that make sense?
4555,Have you tried.

4557,"You can enter your zip and it points you to places that might have it, granted it’s not alway 100% accurate but I had to reschedule a couple times and it was a great help."
4558,because vaccinate yourself if you want to be protected.

4570,yea im 99% sure you either misread it or what you read is reporting bad info.
4571,"as a country, the 18-29 demo is at 13.6%, which would mean some weird shit if 18 year olds and only 18 year olds are at 50%."
4572,"i think you may have read the article that said that 50% of californians over 18 have gotten at least 1 shot, and that would be accurate."
4573,but its almost definitely not 50% of 18 year olds
4574,&gt;	They were doing that before the pandemic.
4575,"Maybe in Japan but not in Thailand, which is where I am now."
4576,"Before no one wore a mask, now 99% are."
4577,You don’t know what you’re talking about.
4578,Don’t generalize across all of Asia.
4579,Metrics ain’t exactly perfect either.
4580,"We all know we need more than half the country vaccinated, but how much more?"
4581,Will 60% cut it?
4582,65%?

4588,I’m in Portland and it is very difficult to get appointments.
4589,Everything is booked solid
4590,Got my first Pfizer almost exactly when you did!
4591,"Only have some minor arm soreness around the injection, which isn't unexpected for me."
4592,Hopefully the second goes well in a few weeks!
4593,Yes it’s impressive but this is not how they outvaccinated the rest of the world which what the headline asks.
4594,They did it by getting all the vaccines in go.
4595,They were able to do that because their entire population can fit in a mid sized city.
4596,Additional explanations beyond that are unnecessary.
4597,"Anecdotal: like everyone else has said, seems the first shot is tougher than the second if you've already had COVID."
4598,I managed to avoid getting it this whole time.
4599,My first shot was painless and I just had arm soreness the next day.
4600,"My second one, I couldn't move for about 48 hours."
4601,Hang in there
4602,"Gosh, I hope so."
4603,Canadian who wishes you all the best.
4604,Do you think you're any more likely to get the flu shot going forward?

4606,Goodrx.com was a great resource for finding pharmacies.
4607,"It’s a bit of a pain once you get to the various pharmacy sites some make you register before showing appointment times, and some don’t do enough prescreening but overall it took me less time to find an appt than I spend on Reddit in a day."
4608,(I ended up at CVS)
4609,[removed]
4610,The only time I've gotten a flu vaccine is when it's offered at my workplace and I don't have to go out of my way to get it.
4611,I'll get it if it's right there but don't care enough about it to go the extra mile for it.
4612,Covid vax though I was right on top of and I even had covid.
4613,"In my experience I haven't seen people in the 18-30 age group being lazy with it, everybody I know has either gotten it or wants to."
4614,Since this is the most recent age group to be eligible I only expect this number to rise in the coming months (and I can't even say for certain that it's eligible in all states yet - lack of research).
4615,"Anybody with a ""why bother"" attitude that you know can probably be easily convinced by reassuring them that it's completely free and all they have to do is show up"
4616,(Not an immunologist so take my word with a grain of salt) but I’ve been seeing that people with prior COVID infections seem to have a worse time with the shots the first time around.
4617,"I tested positive almost a year ago, so I’m hoping that the second dose won’t be as bad since the immune response was already activated."
4618,I’m 16 and got my Phizer vaccine today!
4619,"I don’t have studies to link to, homie."
4620,Maybe try the WHO or CDC websites
4621,They went down with half the adult population or half of total population?
4622,"Also, the US is very large and some regions are doing better than others."
4623,"The best states are around 35-40% of the total population, but a bunch of southern states are closer to 25-30% of their total population."
4624,Only if you stop in another country like Mexico for 14 days first
4625,Thank you.
4626,That is a very good tip.
4627,&gt; I would rather they just allow vaccinated people to hangout with other vaccinated people without any masks.
4628,"Inside Walmart and stores because there's others around that don't know your vaccinated

To me it’s just a simple courtesy."
4629,"We frontline workers busted our asses for the past year while you got to stay home and shop with us once a week (you called us heroes for two weeks and then right back to abusing us when things were slightly inconvenient for you), the least you can do is wear your mask until we all get the chance to get vaccinated, not when you personally know you’re all set."
4630,"It ain’t long now man, c’mon."
4631,Just one time back up what you say when you claim we’re all in this together.
4632,I feel like they’re gonna say vaccinated people can spread the virus for 3-6 more months so people don’t let their guard down prematurely and they’ll flip flop around the start of Q4 after the vaccine has been available to the general population for 6-7 months.
4633,Fauci will never say it directly but I think he doesn’t trust us with any good news.
4634,"I’m not saying this as a dig at him, I think he’s genuinely worried that if they change the rhetoric and let vaccinated people let their guards down more, then a lot of unvaccinated people will lie about getting the shot, and go out and spread the virus."
4635,I feel like malpractice insurance should really be tax deductible....
4636,Alaska is selling vaccines to the highest bidder and healthy 64 year olds in Oregon are *still* waiting to be eligible
4637,Biden really needs to announce a policy that if a state has a month’s worth (or 78 days’ worth!)
4638,of unused supply then some the doses get reallocated to other states or at least that the state doesn’t get another shipment for another week.
4639,What good could more doses do when there are already so many available?
4640,It makes me so frustrated that it’s apparently not allowed to take demand into account when deciding where vaccine doses go on both the local and state level.
4641,The anecdotal stories on side effects have been crazy varied.
4642,"I got my first Moderna last week, the shot was so painless I thought she didn’t actually inject me, next day nothing but the tiniest bit of soreness in my arm and a little tired."
4643,Feel better!
4644,"The vaccine doesn't necessarily protect yoi from getting infected, especially vaccines like AZ and J&amp;J."
4645,"You get milder symptoms, yes, but you may still be infected and symptomatic."
4646,"Considering that loss of taste and smell has been associated to even mild and very mild COVID cases, a vaccine might not be a silver bullet."

4720,No the strongest reactions to the vaccine are most likely to happen to young people and women.
4721,Old people and men are the most likely to die from covid so having a strong reaction to the vaccine shows a strong immune system that could have fought off an infection.
4722,The UK is doing the same thing and it seems to be the wiser choice.
4723,Get everyone covered by vaccines then do second doses.
4724,"UK and US have cumulatively distributed similar doses but UK isn’t getting a spike like what’s happening in Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota and Florida."
4725,Pfizer isn’t even saying that delaying second doses don’t work.

4792,The people in this age group are easily the most risk of death and obviously the fewer people die the better.
4793,"Plus it bodes well for the general population that there are so many older people who had the opportunity to get the vaccine months ago, but are still deciding to do so today."
4794,It suggests that there may be a significant number of people who don’t really fit into either the “must get that shot now” or the “I’m never getting that shot” categories.

4801,Do you mean that you currently can't get past the questions to an appointment?
4802,My advice is to just bend the truth a bit.
4803,"It's not lying, as you'll be eligible (as I understand it) when you actually get the vaccine."
4804,You're just massaging the dopey machine a bit.
4805,They won't ask you anything about your answers when you actually show up to your appointment.
4806,"In my locale, I think that the drugstore websites are all still stuck on Phase 1A, when we're open to all adults."
4807,You should just make your appointment if you're in the eligibility pool -- and select one of the other options.
4808,"Their website will be behind your state, but when you show up to the appointment they have you specify which group you're in, and it should be more up to date."

4817,I just became eligible and got my 1st shot this past week and pretty much every appointment option I saw said which vaccine you were getting ahead of time.
4818,I don’t think that was very common in the beginning though.
4819,When my parents got theirs in January they weren’t told ahead of time.
4820,"Aside from what the other comment said (effectiveness is based on the results of the trial, with trials being done in completely different environments), both had the same effectiveness at preventing serious sickness and death - 100%."
4821,It’s still a relatively new technology and still ultimately delivers mRNA to build spike protein.
4822,It’s just not exactly the same approach as Moderna and Pfizer for delivery as it packages it into a viral vector vs just the mRNA in a fatty lipid.
4823,This is why it’s easier to store and handle.
4824,Only one previous viral vector vaccine has been approved which was also from J&amp;J for Ebola.
4825,Your old school vaccine uses viral fragments.
4826,A lot of people seem to have this impression and I’m not sure where it’s coming from.
4827,&gt; Their vaccine was a rush job so they can capitalize off of this virus..
4828,"It's apparent in how many ""hiccups"" they have had, like when their vaccines got cross-contaminated."
4829,"Um, what?"
4830,"If anything, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is the *least* rushed since it’s based on their Ebola vaccine which was approved before the pandemic even started."
4831,It’s the mRNA vaccines that are the first of their kind.
4832,"And if we’re being honest, every pharmaceutical company has done shady stuff."
4833,They make money off of sick people.
4834,"Also, the cross contamination was the result of an incompetent vendor that had been contracted to manufacture more doses."
4835,"The UK is testing nearly a million people a day and genome sequencing 10% of those, NZ is testing ~900 people a day... so the UK is genome sequencing over 100x the amount that NZ is just testing it doesn't take a genius to work out that 100x the workload is going to take some time 

As a point of reference the UK is currently testing over 1/5 of the population of NZ every day (the population of NZ being just over half the size of the population of London)"
4836,We could see a slightly higher number of young people vaccinated if schools mandate it.
4837,"It will be a while before that is possible at younger ages, but high school seems plausible in the near-ish future, depending on the state."
4838,"That’s true of cases and deaths, but I don’t think hospitalizations have the same backlog issue."
4839,"You don’t have to add up missing hospitalizations from previous days, it’s just a snapshot of how many beds are used that day."
4840,"Even if there is a lag, as long as the lag is fairly consistent (one or two days) you’ll still know what the trend is."
4841,Honestly I feel like conservative pundits/media/politicians are just playing dumb when they suggest to their audience that Fauci wants masks forever.
4842,Anyone who struggles to wrap their heads around the fairly simple notion of “wear masks until everyone has had a chance to get vaccinated and cases come down” is either playing dumb in bad faith or legitimately cognitively impaired.
4843,It’s really not that complicated.
4844,When my state opened to 16+ a couple weeks ago nothing was updated when I woke up that morning.
4845,"It was at least midday by the time places like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid started to update."
4846,Now maybe they're on it more  now but as of a couple weeks ago it wasn't something they did right away.
4847,"How do you figure ""only""?"
4848,130million people have started vaccinations by the 4 month mark and there's still  a ton of demand with many places just opening up a week ago to everyone.
4849,"Once you see daily doses plummet you'll know we met demand, but until then, it is not safe to assume that everyone that is eligible and wants it has gotten it."
4850,"In the mean time, we're averaging 3.2 mil a day and increasing, so yes, there's still a ton of demand."
4851,I'd rather be in Canada than imprisoned in Australia but to each their own I guess.
4852,Same.
4853,Wasn’t even eligible to book an appointment until a few days ago
4854,Yeah.
4855,What I’m hoping for is quick and cheap at-home tests that everyone can use to keep a tab on cases and also will go a long way towards driving cases down.
4856,Pandemic II/Plague Inc. really was quite the accurate simulation after all.
4857,Yes but they’re more forceful about the vaccine.
4858,Forceful might not be the right word but I can’t think of anything better.
4859,"But in the USA, there’s a slim chance but it’s very unlikely if vaccinations continue at this rate."
4860,And especially once it’s out for under 16 year olds.
4861,We haven’t approved AZ yet which as far as I’ve heard is the main problem in Canada since it’s restricted to seniors but a lot of seniors prefer Moderna or Pfizer.
4862,We may see some of this with J&amp;J once thats sorted out but it’s such a tiny fraction of our supply compared to modern and Pfizer I don’t see it having much of an impact overall.
4863,I'm 27 and in my state I just became eligible 3 days ago.
4864,Got my first dose today.
4865,Relax
4866,Bill Gates is already tracking my boring single life!
4867,"[https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/gezondheid/10438255/statistici-maken-gehakt-van-fieldlabs-pseudo-experimenten](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/gezondheid/10438255/statistici-maken-gehakt-van-fieldlabs-pseudo-experimenten)

Google Translate should work fine for this article."
4868,But in summary: this 'experiment' is no real science; it's just an excuse so people can have a festival after 1.5 year of restrictions.
4869,"There's no clear research plan, the sample size is unjustifiably big and all of that being said: there are allegations that the organisers (AKA the people that are selling tickets and making money of drink sales) have shady links to the 'researchers'."
4870,"Not only that, the entire thing is a super spread event waiting to happen."
4871,"Currently we have anywhere around 160,000 people still infectious (total population = 17 million); so at any time roughly 1% of the population is a potential spreader."
4872,Right now the R value is hovering around 1.
4873,"The event will only be accessible if you get an antigen test, but I think that if you read my points below, it should become apparent as to why this 'experiment' is bound to result in increased cases: 

A."
4874,"People who have tickets are extremely lucky (10k tickets, 1 million applicants), so they might even go with symptoms and fake their test or have a false negative somehow and get in."
4875,B.
4876,People who attend these kinds of festivals tend to also be the most over represented group of covid cases: Young people.
4877,"So not only do we have a high number of cases, the people most contagious are the ones going to this event."
4878,"C. The tests used aren't perfect, and with 10,000 attendees you are going to have multiple false negatives."
4879,D. No covid restrictions apply once you're in.
4880,And finally: E. People are going to be travelling there mainly via public transport.
4881,They all probably know someone who has died of Covid at this point unfortunately.
4882,Did they announce whether or not the vaccine had anything to do with it?
4883,[removed]
4884,"Meanwhile in Canada...

4885,"At least where I went I didn't know which one I got until I was there, that might change now that they've opened it up more."
4886,(Virginia)
4887,No it didn’t because it’s going crush the will of a bunch of people to get the vaccine in the first place.
4888,Stopping vaccinations with JNJ was about the dumbest public health move they could have made.
4889,newsom hopes to reopen the state on june 15th and i considered that a conservative estimate and that we would more than likely get to that point sooner.
4890,"by my napkin math, we should be able to get at least 1 dose into 75% of the adult population by next month, so yea newsom, like biden, probably underpromised so he can overdeliver"
4891,"67% puts it around AZ and J&amp;J.

4892,"Yup, my buddy who lives outside the states wants to temporarily come back."
4893,A lot harder to do for 3 weeks to get your second shot.
4894,What does he have to gain by this?
4895,And people w/ medical issues.
4896,And those under 16.
4897,"

My 5G connection is better than ever."
4898,It’s weird that you never see it broken out like that.
4899,"I assume this means that 1.7% of the US population 17 and younger has received at least one dose, but why are people under 16 lumped in with that group when they literally can’t get the vaccine right now?"
4900,How is that useful information?
4901,"Just give us 16-17, or lump them in with the 18-29 group."
4902,It’s not like the age groups are uniform anyway.
4903,"Genuinely curious, is that a hunch or have you seen any data to suggest this?"
4904,At 67% effective it's quite similar to J&amp;J and AZ without the VIPIT issues.

4908,"Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't kinda thing."
4909,I would take a JnJ vaccine.
4910,"Since it was paused for more scrutiny, verified as safe for public."
4911,"This is the craziest part of this whole thing to me, how quickly the vaccines were developed."
4912,"A year ago, the projections were 2 years minimum and up to 10 years."
4913,"california blows texas and pretty much every large state out of the water as far as our numbers go, even when you adjust for population."
4914,"california is vaccinating an average of 1.21% of our population every day, while new york is at 1.08%, ohio and pennsylvania are tied at 1.07%, florida is at 0.99%, illinois is at 0.93%, and texas is at 0.78%"
4915,And yet of course I’m the one suck with an anti vax best friend
4916,"You want to keep up testing as well, so you can have an idea of its prevalence."
4917,Same here flu shot every year.
4918,And got both my moderna shots at work.
4919,I just don't think we're going to get to the complete normality where Covid doesn't exist at all this year.
4920,This seems to be what governments everywhere outside of the US are planning for.
4921,"We won't have social distancing and masks will probably go as well, but it seems testing is still going to be very widespread."
4922,Take this from an Irish government report.
4923,The UK and Gibraltar also have similar plans.
4924,"&gt;Given the (perhaps unrealistically high) expectations of the  public with respect to vaccination, the prospects of acceptance and adherence to another lockdown  after widespread vaccination are low."
4925,"The Spring and Summer months of 2021, with more outside  activities and better ventilation, should help but we must prepare now, especially for next Winter with  increased indoor gatherings in poorly ventilated spaces."
4926,"Moreover, it is likely that as more people become vaccinated, their adherence to public health measures, e.g."
4927,"mask wearing, social distancing,  regular hand washing etc."
4928,will decrease and this will work against the positive effects of the vaccination campaign.
4929,"Rapid testing together with vaccination, can be deployed, along with other public health measures, as a way of decreasing the risk of transmitting COVID-19 as well as maintaining the effectiveness of the current vaccination by minimising the spread of new variants."
4930,So these people (assuming they recover) could end up with crippling medical debt for the rest of their lives?
4931,This was how my first moderna felt and second dose I felt pretty terrible but only from 24hrs after to 28hrs after.
4932,I’d do it again in a heartbeat
4933,"Tomorrow is the day the floodgates in my state open for all adults (and most if not all the remaining ones, I have yet to see a mention of an all-adults day later than 4/19)."
4934,Have a feeling we are going to see a lot of green flairs next week.
4935,😁
4936,Weird how everyone is different.
4937,"I hardly get a sore arm for the flu shot every year and sometimes I think, ""I didn't get sick, so is it really working?"""
4938,"but I haven't have the actual flu in the 10 years I've been getting it, but Moderna kicked my ass this year lol."
4939,Totally worth it though.
4940,Be better at this man.
4941,Have a good one
4942,My family only stopped doing this once we were all vaccinated.

so small or unimportant as to be not worth considering; insignificant."
4945,How long ago?
4946,Risk is low so hopefully you will be fine.
4947,It boils down to whether or not you can narrow the effected group down by specifying whether or not all of the individuals who suffered from this had common demographics.
4948,"So you start at 7 million, but if all of them are women, you now cut that basically in half to 3.5 million."
4949,"Now if all of them were within a specific age range, now you have to lower it further."
4950,"If they were all on birth control, you lower it further."
4951,"Eventually when you run out of common demographics, you look at the denominator and determine whether the percentage of people this happened to is insignificant or not."
4952,"1 in a million is nothing, but if it's say 1 in 10,000, that's a concern since there are other vaccines and there's no reason that an extra few thousand people should get bloodclots when they can avoid it."
4953,"Hence why you figure out who, if anyone, should avoid J&amp;J before letting anyone else take it again."
4954,Some of these people are at virtually 0 risk of getting COVID right now even before a vaccine so why take the chance?
4955,"So if come Friday all is cleared up and we have a better idea of what to do, I think it was good to pause."
4956,"&gt; So once Covid is reduced to being the same level of threat as the flu due to herd immunity via vaccination, we won’t need masks anymore."
4957,Why do you think that?
4958,Seems to me you think we have handled influenza perfectly in the past and we should continue doing everything the same way because of that.

5014,In fact what's more likely to happen is that coveted programs/specialties would pay residents less
5015,&gt; LAST WEEK the billionth dose of covid-19 vaccine was produced.
5016,"It is a sign of how greatly manufacturing capacity has expanded over the past six months that the next billion doses could be produced by May 27th, according to Airfinity, an analytics firm (see chart)."
5017,Yet this ambition is at risk from American export controls on raw materials and equipment.
5018,"Production lines in India, making at least 160m doses of covid vaccine a month, will come to a halt in the coming weeks unless America supplies 37 critical items."
5019,"&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On April 16th, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, put out a tweet begging President Joe Biden to “lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US...Your administration has the details”."
5020,"Suresh Jadhav, SII’s executive director, says “we are absolutely concerned,” and that in the next four to six weeks the production of two vaccines will be affected: AstraZeneca’s, of which SII makes 100m doses a month, and Novavax’s, of which it expects to make 60m-70m doses a month."
5021,SII says it first alerted the American government to the impending problem two months ago.
5022,"&gt; 
&gt; That was shortly after the Biden administration announced, on February 5th, plans to use the Defence Production Act (DPA)—legislation that grants the president broad industrial-mobilisation powers—to bolster vaccine-making."
5023,This legislation has helped American pharmaceutical companies to secure raw materials and equipment needed to make more vaccines.
5024,But American firms that supply products essential to vaccine production say the DPA hinders their ability to export them.
5025,"They must seek permission before exporting goods, which requires time and paperwork, and if America’s government decides they need the goods, firms may be barred from exporting them at all."
5026,Some are also concerned about pharma companies outside of America stockpiling goods because of concerns about delays caused by American export controls.
5027,"Together, export controls and stockpiling risk gumming up the global supply chain."
5028,"&gt; 
&gt; Vaccine production requires an array of special materials, including plastic tubing, raw goods, filters and even paper."
5029,"Because all these items have to be specially approved by regulators to be used in medicine production, finding substitutes quickly can be impossible."
5030,"&gt; 
&gt; SII is not the only company to be concerned."
5031,"Export controls also affect European vaccine producers, who need special bags from America in which to make their products."
5032,"At a vaccine supply-chain meeting in early March, one European pharmaceutical company complained of 66-week delivery times for the supply of bags, commenting that it would be quicker to make a steel container to manufacture them in."
5033,"&gt; 
&gt; On March 24th, Micheál Martin, Ireland’s prime minister, warned that export bans (and not just from America) would undermine global vaccine production, and noted that the Pfizer vaccine involves 280 components from 86 suppliers in 19 countries."
5034,"Richard Hatchett, head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to develop vaccines, says his organisation is “extremely concerned about constraints on global supply chains”."
5035,"&gt; 
&gt; CEPI is part of a new task force working with industry on this problem, and has also appealed to the World Trade Organisation for support."
5036,"Its new head, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, held a high-level meeting this week, which concluded that stronger supply chains were critical to addressing global vaccine inequity."
5037,"&gt; 
&gt; If all goes swimmingly, the world could produce as many as 14bn doses of vaccine this year."
5038,"But if vaccines and raw materials do not arrive where and when needed, production will fall grievously short of that estimate."
5039,"Shortfalls in India will hinder its own vaccination programme, which is ramping up amidst an alarming second wave of infections—the country is recording more than 1,000 deaths per day from covid-19."
5040,"And since India has banned the export of finished vaccines while it serves domestic needs, Mr Jadhav says that SII cannot fulfill its commitments to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing programme, and cannot deliver supplies to Europe and Britain."
5041,"&gt; 
&gt; At a time when many American states have a surplus of vaccines, with as many as one in three doses going unused, American export restrictions are not just galling."
5042,They may soon derail the plan to vaccinate the world.
5043,Good for LA county.
5044,But now we've got multiple states that have cases rising significantly.
5045,We gotta take care of that before we can officially reach the end of the pandemic.
5046,"I mean I know there are new more infectious variants taking over and many regions are loosening their restrictions, but shouldn't case counts be taking a nosedive by now with 50% at least halfway vaccinated (assuming one dose is roughly 70% effective)?"

5056,Wow!
5057,Those numbers in the 65 and 75+ groups are great!!
5058,I really didn’t think that large a percentage of people would be willing to get the vaccine.
5059,"True but JNJ is very logical for certain parts of the population - students going back to college in the fall, young people in general who are transient (2 shots would be logistically challenging), etc."
5060,"I think JNJ has always been targeted as a Ex-US vaccine, iirc."
5061,Well in some places it’s been over for weeks or even months!
5062,Thank you very much.
5063,Its nice to see at least one person sharing the truth of what happened and I appreciate the detail you provided.
5064,God I look at all the liars on reddit saying I'm the one spreading misinformation and it makes me sad for our world.
5065,That's on top of the disappointment I have for our government  who essentially killed our seniors and yes front line workers.
5066,"Pfizer pfelicitations, Phteven."
5067,Me too man.
5068,By day 2 you can start integrating to bluetooth!
5069,/s
5070,Its ok. Stay on your island forever.
5071,It's safe there.
5072,"So once Covid is reduced to being the same level of threat as the flu due to herd immunity via vaccination, we won’t need masks anymore."
5073,"If you want to wear one, feel free."
5074,Don’t expect everyone else to though.
5075,"&gt; I might get to take home 80k of that

how so?"
5076,"And once every American who wants to be vaccinated can just pop into their local pharmacy or McDonald’s or whatever, sure, export the leftovers."
5077,"Amogus, sorry."
5078,"The numbers may make it seem like this, but no."
5079,I&amp;j was tested later with more mutations that made the numbers look worse.
5080,You can't directly compare them.
5081,I never said it doesn’t spread out doors.
5082,You used spring break as an example that it does but have not fact based evidence to prove that.
5083,See last summers protests.
5084,Repeated shown to not be spreader events and not cause case increases.
5085,Many people were with out masks and shouting on top of that.
5086,Walmart get a mask?
5087,I feel like Walmart might get a mask longer than Target 😂.
5088,In the near future be prepared to meet certain people who's only personality will be restricting their life and wearing masks even when most of the population is vaccinated and its completely safe to go mask-less.
5089,I have a friend denying to go to an outdoor gathering with 3+ other people.
5090,Despite Everyone being completely vaccinated and CDC states its safe.
5091,"Just like how there's ""extremists"" that hate masks and didn't give a shit about safety and lived life like there was no covid, there will be extremists at the twilight end of the pandemic who will act pretty extreme in restricting their life."
5092,The latter group won't be harming anyone so its all good.
5093,Decades of education and outreach on physical fitness and diet.
5094,"We have had all manner of govt programs over the decades designed to encourage people to take care of themselves, they have not been heeded."
5095,"So you get that things are done in school, all those PE and health classes, think they are just for fun?"
5096,"You don’t need sports to exercise, and there is nothing stopping any community from starting rec soccer or basketball leagues."
5097,"If I see someone working out, that proves they aren’t lazy."
5098,When I did cross fit we had overweight people join up all the time and they were just as welcomed as the lifelong athletes or the skinny minis.
5099,But your friends refuse to work out because they might be seen as lazy?
5100,That’s some really backwards thinking.
5101,Guess what?
5102,"No one can judge them if they are getting a workout in at home, no one."
5103,"I mean I guess I can turn on my camera on my peloton, but I don’t because I’m sweaty as hell on a ride on that thing."
5104,"The real solution is to stop making excuses and put in the time now, so you get more time later."
5105,That’s it.
5106,The time for “have you thought about working out” has past.
5107,Push-ups and sit ups and squats in sets of 10 all day long.
5108,You are working the big muscles with just those three groups.
5109,"Cant do 10 pushups, plank."
5110,"Cant plank, do modified push-ups, we all learned this stuff in middle school gym class."
5111,I got my first dose (Pfizer) just by walking thru the grocery store yesterday!
5112,“Other” are these trial participants for other candidate vaccines?
5113,"Just lie on the the screener, that is just something to stop people from registering from appointments they aren’t eligible for."
5114,If you will be eligible on the appointment date you are fine.
5115,"I put my real birth date, my real age, everything into the registration, including the screener page."
5116,All I did was click “40 and over+” for an appointment that was the morning it went to 16 and over.
5117,Worked for both me and my wife with no issues in 2 separate CVS locations.
5118,I think we found a way to fund the Covax vaccine doses.
5119,Definitely can confirm.
5120,"Had a bad case of covid several months prior, and both doses of Moderna absolutely wrecked me—especially the first one."
5121,"&gt; Hoping it ends soon

It will."
5122,"You are almost done in terms of timing, I believe."
5123,"Honestly, unless I’m wearing it for a long time, a KN95 is both more comfortable and effective."
5124,"The issue for me is that my ears hurt from long time, like 5 or more hours, wearing of a KN95."
5125,Really?
5126,Didn't know that.
5127,"Sucks, but I guess not a lot of options."
5128,"Israel's cases crested on Jan 18, when they got to 30% vaccinated, but since Israel specifically excluded people previously confirmed positive from initial vaccination, they have an additional 10% immunity on top of that."
5129,So Canada might be less than a month away.
5130,"But Israel's cases didn't fall smoothly, it plateaued twice, and it's not clear where the true infliction point is."
5131,"It probably depends on many things and vaccination is only one variable, albeit a critical one."
5132,https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact
5133,Way to be a child and name call.
5134,I was simply making a counter argument and you resorted to childish insults.
5135,There is a ton of evidence that this does not spread well at all outdoors even in crowded environments.
5136,People don’t wear masks while eating and drinking indoors bud.
5137,Is it possible that the vaccine affect people with pervious covid differently?
5138,"Don’t know, don’t care lalalala"
5139,Yes and no.
5140,Most every women where's a mask where ever they go.
5141,Part of their driving outfit.
5142,Live in the country side and the air is clear and nice and still most people where masks.
5143,Need to amplify the long term symptoms then to scare them.

5145,For whoever needs to hear this.
5146,This is actually kind of normal.
5147,"It’s a good thing, the immune system is like hey I know this fucker."
5148,If it lasts more than a couple days than start to be concerned.
5149,"At least you’re in an area where everyone is eligible to be vaccinated

(canada btw)"
5150,Those chains are woke as fuck.
5151,It's not going to be until 2022.
5152,[removed]
5153,Big cities yes most everywhere else no.
5154,I had my second around 36 hours ago.
5155,Still have a fever and it’s been rough going all day.
5156,Right at the 12 hour mark I felt absolutely horrible.
5157,Hoping it ends soon but everyone else I’ve talked to said it went away fairly quickly.
5158,I don't think the economic and societal consequences of no lockdowns or restrictions are comparable.
5159,You probably should wait before studies are published on whether you can still be a carrier once you are vaccinated.
5160,The coffee test is something like 77% accurate.
5161,Sniff a spoonful of coffee grounds.
5162,Smells like coffee?
5163,You probably don't have Covid.
5164,"Oddly DOESN'T smell like coffee, you almost certainly have Covid."
5165,I was reading this morning that covid patients in some places in India are so numerous right now they are sharing covid unit beds.
5166,"Europeans will, I’d imagine."
5167,Lol dude you are on a sub where if they had their way masks would be permanent for the rest of their lives indoors and out
5168,Ah ok.
5169,I think that's fine.
5170,CDC was recommending not to take them before the shot.
5171,I’m getting tired of all these articles about how tiny countries with like 10 people are fully vaccinated as if that’s supposed to impress us.
5172,Yes.
5173,"Will wear one on airplanes, port a potties, doctors offices, just places where I generally feel gross."
5174,But not in Target etc
5175,"By June, many states will probably use free shots as a lure to get tourists to fly in."
5176,You see Alaska talking about it already.
5177,"Very true, as I was typing my response it definitely occurred to me how much of that is privilege, affording fun hobbies and a home in their community (although, SW Florida is a lot more affordable than my home...) and obviously people with privilege have better outcomes with covid."
5178,"BUT, I like to believe that at least my old folks have their level of activity going for them."
5179,"Was planning on taking them a few hours after, like 6 maybe, as that's how long it took for the effects to kick in last time."
5180,But I'll look into this.
5181,Thanks!
5182,It seems like from the upvote/downvote system that you lack basic education lmao
5183,Mean while in Toronto the positivity rate is around 10% jesus us Canadians are fucked
5184,True.
5185,I think the government should especially help J&amp;J to expand its manufacturing capacity.
5186,"It’s cheap and one dose, a better choice for poorer countries."
5187,Miss you friend to the North!!
5188,"Hopefully, we can get back to normal enough to have Canada open back up to the US."
5189,Really miss going to the Stratford festival.
5190,"Hmm, maybe ""get vaccinated but you still have to wear a mask, possibly *until 2022*, even after every adult has been offered two shots"" wasn't that great of a message."
5191,"""""Studies indicate that even if vaccinated people do become ill, they are  far less likely to experience severe illness requiring hospitalization  or resulting in death."""""
5192,"CNN had some numbers the other day which were like... 5,800 breakthrough cases, with 74 deaths (so CFR of 1.2% in the breakthrough cases), and somewhere between 6-7% requiring hospitalizations."
5193,Aren't the CFR and hospitalization rates in the breakthrough cases in that set about the same as what it is for unvaccinated people..?
5194,"Crowded markets, spring break beaches, crowded public parks, concerts etc."
5195,Do you lack basic education or something?
5196,"Not very high means 67%, as linked by the person above."
5197,You’re missing the point.
5198,"67% is still decent, just not Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax/Covaxin levels."
5199,It’s more like AZ levels.
5200,Is the Brazilian study you mentioned the one with a 60% confidence interval?
5201,Yes I was exhausted after my first shot.
5202,That and brain fog were my only symptoms.
5203,"Marylander here, got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday, and no issues so far, other than minor pain at the injection site."
5204,I think they're actually going to find more examples like this.
5205,Just because someone was diagnosed 2 weeks after their second dose doesn't mean they were infected then.
5206,"The median incubation period may be 5 days, but there's pretty significant variance."
5207,Watch a lot of these people turn out to have been infected shortly after their first dose and then just had a longer than average incubation time and/or waited until they were really sick before getting tested.
5208,22 and just got my first shot last weekend.
5209,LOL.
5210,Sure.
5211,The ignorant downvoted you.
5212,Because how dare you be logical?
5213,&gt; Gonna be loading up on the 'cetamol and the 'prufen for my next dose!
5214,I read that those could interfere with the vaccine doing its thing if taken close to the vaccination time.
5215,I recommend doing some quick research before taking them.
5216,except business owners and people that need to work to feed their families  😒
5217,I'm referring to those that are unable to be vaccinated because of them.
5218,While many (most?)
5219,"folks are lying antivaxxers, there are legitimately people that can't be vaccinated."
5220,[removed]
5221,Show me definitive proof there is no transmission outdoors.
5222,Why should I waste my time trying to convince an idiot?
5223,Even in Florida there are plenty of places with mask restrictions indoors.
5224,But none outdoors.
5225,And the virus does not care about your stupid opinions.
5226,It is spreading quite efficiently.
5227,Even outdoors in crowded places.
5228,So get vaccinated and mask up or f**k off.
5229,I won't tolerate nay sayers almost a year into the pandemic still asking proof when it's all there to look for.
5230,3% of adults in America are immunocompromised/suppressed.
5231,That’s a lot of people.
5232,The thresholds for lifting restrictions/precautions should be based on case/hospitalization/death metrics just like was proposed from the very beginning of this thing.
5233,That blows.
5234,Were you vaccinated?
5235,"Compared to Pfizer and Moderna no, compared to the others yes"
5236,I’m not entirely sure why it should be.
5237,You can still travel from South Africa
5238,I’m 20 and got my first one 2 weeks ago.
5239,"It isn’t hard, and I expect us to be the age group that gets it the second we can"
5240,"LOL, I bought a total of 120 KN95 masks from meh.com in fall and early winter."
5241,"Still have, probably, 50 left."
5242,"I wear them twice, at least a day apart."
5243,"Husband wears a Reebok mask most times a when he goes out, because he’s playing tennis."
5244,But wears the KN95 otherwise.
5245,I got my 1st Moderna yesterday
5246,[It'll be sad if doctors and nurses develop PTSD after this covid-19 nightmare ends.
5247,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychological-trauma-is-the-next-crisis-for-coronavirus-health-workers1/)
5248,It means the first shot got yo body ready and that it’s working
5249,30 some percent of the whole population only 50% of adults.
5250,Basically it takes about two more weeks to get to 50% and another 2 for those first doses to be effective.
5251,So basically between now and Memorial Day hopefully every state begins a decline that shouldn’t reverse after that point.
5252,"Ah man, the “Everything Virus” can do it all, not even vaccines can save us now, because the super big bad mutated COVID is coming!!"
5253,!
5254,They don't have a point.
5255,"They're just making a logical fallacy in an attempt at a ""gotcha""."
5256,Quad city area Illinois side has been great utilizing Facebook and the national guard has been seem less in rock island county
5257,Where are they being imported from?
5258,"The US is not exporting a lot, unlike countries like India"
5259,[removed]
5260,It's not just about helping others (although there is nothing wrong with doing that.)
5261,It's about being pragmatic.
5262,The longer this virus is allowed to circulate the greater the likelihood of another variant popping up and causing more trouble.
5263,The sooner we can start exporting vaccines to poorer countries the better for everyone.
5264,We should focus heavily on our neighbors to the north and south and then branch out from there to get the whole western hemisphere and then move onto Africa.
5265,*As Reddit wants to believe
5266,"OH, I get it now!"
5267,It was Corona that gave them the fatal blood clots which had nothing to do with the vaccines.

5293,"In MN, you can’t go into any retail establishment without a mask."
5294,I had my second Pfizer vaccine in early March.
5295,And I still wear a KN95 mask.
5296,Oh yeah some dude walked up to the bar for a drink maskless and the bartender made a gesture to put a mask on and the guy shouted “oh it’s ok I’m vaccinated.”
5297,Good news.
5298,"On Friday I had a woman at work explain to me that the vaccine is an apocalyptic conspiracy between Bill Gates, the Rockefeller family and Satan."
5299,It was quite disheartening.
5300,"I hope the numbers continue to trend up, but there are so many delusional individuals out there."

5304,but I also had this bizarre full body sensitivity that felt like I had been baking in the summer sun sunrise to sundown.
5305,When it first started developing I felt very prickly like a cactus.
5306,I forbade my boyfriend from even brushing me because everything was sore.
5307,The soreness lasted for a good few days.

5312,"Incorrect, they are polling everyone- those who have got it and those who haven't."

5314,&gt; ...younger Americans are less likely than older Americans **to claim they have** or will get vaccinated.
5315,Eh maybe.
5316,But if they have the appointment for the second one I’d imagine they would go.
5317,But yeah some protection is better than none.
5318,"I don’t understand, can you try proofreading your comments before submitting?"
5319,There's also probably a few percent of people who are waiting to get it until the get the okay from their doctor because of various conditions.
5320,"I have a couple family members (in the 75+ group) who fall into that category (e.g., cancer treatment that wrecks the immune system, so doctor says it won't have an effect)."

5326,Resident have more leverage than you think.
5327,Hospitals right now are dependent on them.
5328,"Out of fear of not having enough residents, they will increase pay not lower it."
5329,"Even in competitive specialities, you will start to see doctors prefer the higher paying program for the same speciality."
5330,Your reasoning is fairly sound.
5331,1.
5332,"Israel's numbers point to a major dent in cases a few weeks after they hit the 50% of the total adult population, so we should hopefully see a reduction in cases begin over the next 2-3 weeks (though this is understandably not guaranteed)."
5333,2.
5334,"While the current USA COVID numbers aren't great (led by states with new surges), the severe cases and hospitalizations are way down, and certain regions that had major waves in the past (Texas) are now seeing their case numbers AND hospitalizations (the latter is important) plummet despite having no real restrictions."
5335,3.
5336,"Natural immunity does offer some protection, though likely less than what the vaccine does (especially against variants), but some is better than none in terms of reducing the rate of transmission (r0 number) and slowing the spread overall."
5337,4.
5338,Less spread = less opportunities to mutate.
5339,"Half of all adults in the US now being able to resist COVID will begin making it a lot harder for the virus to spread very soon, and it will only get better from here."
5340,"I want us to get to 70%+ fully vaccinated, but I believe that when we do, we'll see major changes in the USA."
5341,"Yeah I’m still fine wearing a mask post vaccine for a few more months, not that big of a deal 🤷🏻‍♂️"
5342,"No, they are different types of clots."
5343,The AZ vaccine is linked to specific blood clots in the brain
5344,That was it!!
5345,!
5346,"Some researcher did, in a video to demonstrate that, contrary to the claims of fools, you can breathe under a mask."
5347,"Early in the pandemic, I watched a researcher doing vigorous activity, and as he both spoke and moved, took off four masks—maybe even five?—one after the other, leaving a single medical mask on his face."
5348,I would link to it if it weren’t a year ago and parts of my memory are like a sieve.
5349,I remember seeing it.
5350,Not where or how.
5351,"Or people who are on chronic immunosuppressive drugs for transplants for instance, or those with some forms of cancer"
5352,Pretty sure people with medical issues have been eligible for a while now
5353,"Their choice affects others, so it's perfectly reasonable for places to require vaccines."

5366,It's not as simple as just shutting down travel from one county to another in a highly globalized network of flights and people moving around.
5367,It truly depends.
5368,Some Masters degree holders I know of are waiting for the Biden developed/approved boosters this summer/fall rather than Trump's original vaccines that are being used now.
5369,They're convinced something is wrong with them and the J&amp;J stuff recently didn't help.
5370,"Because it’s a pain, it’s hot, it makes my skin dry and breaks some ppl out."
5371,This is a bit of a ballpark but I'll try to estimate.
5372,Let's define Michigan's big surge as February 24 to April 9.
5373,I could have gotten the averages wrong but I believe that's where the new cases were at their lowest and where they peaked.
5374,"On February 24, Michigan recorded a seven day daily average of 1,208 new cases, and the country had its average at 68,604."
5375,"On April 9, Michigan went up to 7,614, the country went down to 67,927."
5376,This means that the country went down by 0.98%.
5377,"But without Michigan, *just* Michigan, those two dates for the country would have given us seven day new case averages of 67,396 and 60,990."
5378,That would have been a decrease of 11.10%.
5379,The Michigan surge was *huge* and incredibly unusual compared to the rest of the country.
5380,Nah.
5381,It started with one man.
5382,A name I won’t mention.
5383,But it was his goal to create chaos and divisiveness over this virus.
5384,One person is responsible for the politicization of Covid.
5385,Yes.
5386,One person can make a difference.
5387,One person in power can use their “magnetic” personality to create a culture of “us vs them”.
5388,And he did it rather brilliantly.
5389,In a sick and twisted way.
5390,"I work for a health authority, all hospital staff have been able to get appointments including me who does not work at a hospital."
5391,"Oh boy, let's outlaw guns that have been legal longer than the average redditor has been alive!"
5392,"I don't care if those solutions would somehow address this insignificant problem the media hypes up, its not worth the cost to liberty, period."
5393,I never said that.
5394,You made up this ridiculous scenario in your stupid little head.
5395,"Okay, genius."
5396,I didn't see anyone say it's over.
5397,It's progress.
5398,"Some people take the fact that there were summer waves at all to mean that there's no seasonality, even though they were smaller and considering susceptibility to this novel virus at that time in those locations was nearly 100%."

5435,Sometimes that means a 'tough love' message that people don't want to hear.
5436,You want to know when you can stop wearing masks: when Covid cases are very low in the country.
5437,"Either everyone does the right thing with masking up and staying away from super-spreader events, such as crowded bars (examples: South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, which have all consistently had very low Covid numbers), 

or everyone gets the shot (Israel)."
5438,"The US is very far from either of these, and Covid variants are spreading like crazy in Florida where lots of people congregated during Spring Break without masks."
5439,You are right that he is not a politician.
5440,Politicians never give 'tough love' messages.
5441,They just tell people what they want to hear.
5442,“Could potentially”.

5446,Strict lockdown = more restrictions than most of the world for a longer period of time.
5447,"&gt;I don’t think comparisons are required because I know what I classify as strict and the UKs lockdown was very strict for the first part of it when schools were closed, non essential shops were closed etc."
5448,Then in March some of the things I classify as very strict were removed.
5449,Why does what other countries have any impact on that?
5450,"Just because some EU countries have or had curfews, how does that impact the UK

Comparisons are not required?"

5458,[removed]
5459,I appreciate the question; I will confess that I similarly don't understand how you are reaching your conclusion.
5460,"While I could have been clearer, I guess I am stating that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of transmission, but doesn't stop it."
5461,"Perhaps it is an argument over semantics, but I equate the term ""stops infection"" with a nearly 100% rate of prevention in subsequent transmission of the virus; similar to what we've seen in the reduction of severe outcomes."
5462,"&amp;#x200B;

Everything that I've read suggests that the Moderna/Pfzier vaccines can reduce transmission in up to 90-95% of individuals post-vaccination and somewhere south of that for the other manufactures (see, e.g., this [summary](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison) from Yale)."
5463,That's great progress.
5464,"But I don't define that as ""stopping"" transmission of the disease and that may be where we differ."
5465,"Now, it may be that the remaining 5-10% risk of infection, when extrapolated across the population is truly nominal."
5466,"You suggest the risk of infection post-vaccination - even at that 5-10% - is ""extremely, extremely, extremely low""."
5467,"I haven't seen any hard data on this point to help me reach the same conclusion, but would love to read up on the matter if you have a reference."
5468,"(As an aside, I'd agree with your assessment as to the risk of severe outcomes following administration of most of the vaccines because that has been a nearly 100% reduction.)"
5469,"&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, children under 16 cannot yet be vaccinated."
5470,That means there are still A LOT of potential vectors out there for current and new variants to continue circulating and create additional opportunities to chip away at that 90-95% effective rate.
5471,"And while there has been a lot of focus of the original strain being most harmful to seniors/those with certain comorbidities, there is evidence that the newer variants are more contagious amongst children."
5472,"As a parent, this absolutely informs my continued assessment of risk and helps explain why I may be more cautious than a 20-something itching to resume their social life."
5473,"&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I understand that no vaccine is 100% effective, but context matters, too."
5474,It's okay that many of our current vaccines are less than 100% effective because we've obtained herd immunity with respect to those diseases.
5475,That isn't the case for COVID.
5476,At least not yet.
5477,"So it's completely rational to me that we would need to continue taking additional precautions (i.e., masking) for COVID that we do not for, say, measles."
5478,"Once a greater percentage of the population has been vaccinated - and I have no idea what that number is - then by all means, let's open things back up."
5479,But I'm just not sure we've reached that tipping point just yet.
5480,"Yeah, and I was in favor of closing schools during the first wave."
5481,Mainly because we just didn't know what was going to happen.
5482,"But now we do have the data, and unlike flu, these kids aren't germ factories for COVID."
5483,Helps that most schools in person are taking CDC precautions seriously.
5484,"And all teachers can get the vaccine and protect themselves, which is crucial."
5485,"Funny thing is, my daughter actually did really well in online school, but again, her social skills deteriorated."
5486,She's been back a month and a half and she's starting to come back to who she was before.
5487,"I do not, I haven't tried it myself."
5488,I made my name from looking at a PB Jar and Can of Soda lmao
5489,Antibody count is still much higher in vaccinated people than in people who had COVID
5490,Scratch that and reverse it.
5491,**Not** wearing one got politicized by one person.
5492,One person made it their mission to sow chaos and create as much divisiveness as possible.
5493,And we know who that person is.
5494,"You mean the guy that wanted to replace ""vacca"" in ""vaccine"" with his name?"
5495,President Cow.
5496,"I think there’s a lot of people who won’t take it because they don’t believe in vaccines or the virus (“idiots” basically), but I’m wondering if there’s some who are t gonna get it because they don’t trust the vaccines."
5497,"I’m signed up to get the AZ vaccine on Tuesday...but I gotta be honest...I’m a little scared because of the media coverage about the lack of efficacy, and the whole blood clot thing (even though the sensible part of me knows the risks are infinitesimal)."
5498,"Well you know man, if people want to lie and get themselves sick whatever."
5499,Im vaccinated and I'm going to live my life
5500,It’s not too long.
5501,"AstraZeneca is not used in the US, so the CDC recommendations are pretty irrelevant."
5502,"Amongst other benefits, trial results suggest that this particular vaccine is actually more effective with the longer dosing interval."
5503,Edit: I should clarify that the second appointment is assigned to you automatically here when you book the first dose.
5504,Mother's day is my target.
5505,"New cases are usually people who got infected 1-2 weeks ago, so I would say we only missed Easter by a week."
5506,Supreme court case Wyeth v. Levine confirms that even with FDA approval pharma companies aren't shielded.
5507,"Don't know why you want to bootlick big pharma, I thought we all hated them?"
5508,Yeah I’m not pro lockdown in the slightest.
5509,I just disagree that the last few weeks have been ‘very strict’ and would say we left a lockdown that could be defined as such 6 weeks ago.
5510,Also what is that edit?
5511,It’s been illegal to leave your house for a year?
5512,Lol
5513,I agree.

5517,Israel had a little bit of a rise before their dramatic fall.

5520,"So if you're ""fully vaccinated"" with a single J&amp;J shot then why do Pfizer/Moderna receivers have to wait until two weeks after their second shot before they can act like they're vaccinated even though the first shot gets them to the J&amp;J level?"
5521,Only missed the Easter goal by a few weeks!
5522,There is recourse.
5523,The Federal Government is underwriting any liability for COVID vaccination related issues.

5535,:D
5536,Good chance you will not need to get the booster of the same brand you got your base shot.
5537,It's still TBD though.
5538,No need to go out and get another vaccine in the mean time.
5539,"I heard the same news story and it said the university and further the board of regents will wait and see before making further requirements, not that they won't require them period."
5540,Specifically EUA and what vaccination rates turn out to be.
5541,Vaccines are highly effectively and safe and we have literally hundreds of millions of data points showing that is the case over several months.
5542,You’re implying we don’t have enough data to confidently say they work as well as seatbelts work and you’re just wrong.
5543,If you feel their logic can’t be argued with it might be because your understanding of vaccine efficacy of the threats posed by covid is not very good.
5544,The risk of taking a covid vaccine is many many orders of magnitude lower than the risks of getting covid and not getting a vaccine puts everyone in your life including vaccinated people at a greater risk of catching it.
5545,It’s very easy to argue with the logic you’ve presented.
5546,Same!
5547,Had my second dose on Thursday and I was OUT Friday.
5548,"Fever, body aches, chills, everything."
5549,BUT I was totally fine by Sunday morning.
5550,Now I’m just a little sore in the arm.
5551,Cant wait til May 1 when it’s all kicked in!
5552,That’s too long to go between doses.
5553,CDC recommends 3 weeks.
5554,"You’ve made comparisons and then followed it up by saying you’ve got no idea of the specifics of any of it, haven’t any idea what you classify as strict and then told me to go away and actually do the work to prove it (despite the fact you can’t even tell me how you define a strict lockdown)."
5555,"I don’t think comparisons are required because I know what I classify as strict and the UKs lockdown was very strict for the first part of it when schools were closed, non essential shops were closed etc."

5557,Why does what other countries have any impact on that?
5558,"Just because some EU countries have or had curfews, how does that impact the UK"
5559,As a Canadian I am sorry for anything sarcastic or damaging comments made about the states.
5560,Our government up here couldn’t organize their sock drawer.
5561,Uhh...media and fearmongering?
5562,I get the anxiety.
5563,"But rationally speaking, how would a potential booster shot be any better or worse for your body than the current generation of vaccines?"
5564,"They would work in exactly the same way, with just slight modifications to better target the mutation."
5565,"You may know more about this than I do, given you work in the field, but it seems to me that the mRNA vaccine technology is basically the most harmless you can get with a vaccine."
5566,"It's just a piece of mRNA, which is inherently unstable and breaks down by itself once its in your body."
5567,"Yeah, that's what I really don't understand."
5568,"It's a once-in-a-century global pandemic, with almost 600,000 dead in the US--but so many of these people seem *genuinely offended* by those of us who are erring on the side of caution while we wait for the vaccines to finish rolling out."
5569,I already did once I found it :)
5570,"i really hope so, man"
5571,Thanks for the post!!
5572,I just scheduled my first dose for Wednesday!
5573,That's not entirely true.

5577,A LONG time ago (back during the docked cruise ship fiasco) they were saying it has been seen up to 45 days.
5578,"Probably rare, but not new."
5579,Yes
5580,Just because I won't die doesn't mean it can't affect me-- I know I'll be downvoted for this but it'll feel really unfair if I had to give up half of high school for this only to be forced to return without restrictions and catch covid as a thanks for my troubles
5581,I will continue to wear a mask until it's not required because it can help other people feel safer.
5582,They don't know my vaccination status.
5583,Which is why it was listed separately than every US state (as was Washington D.C.).
5584,Not sure what your point is.
5585,This still doesn't address or capture transmission by asymptomatic carriers without testing.
5586,"Also, the FERPA issue makes it really hard to feel confident sending a kid to school."
5587,"The schools put it right in the paperwork that nah, they won't notify you if your kid was exposed, partially because they can't but also because don't fucking know who your kid sits next to on the bus or gets stuck in an overcrowded hall with between classes."
5588,I get that the schools are hamstrung by guidelines.
5589,"I know that the schools aren't set up to prevent transmission of...well, literally anything."
5590,My kids have attended classes in portable buildings with no functional ventilation.
5591,It's not great.
5592,So I'm not ascribing malice to the schools.
5593,"I really think they're doing their best, and I know the Rona is capable to changing significantly faster that school administrations."
5594,"I just have a hard time looking at specific policies based on outdated information and potential missing data and saying ""Well, this seems like a good idea."""
5595,"I had a bad case of the flu 11 years ago, but was no where near death."
5596,Just very sick with odd symptoms for flu.
5597,"Since then, I've had to deal with a chronic illness that has made every day of my life more difficult, and likely will forever."
5598,"And I'm one of the ""lucky"" ones that still can lead a pretty normal life."
5599,Surviving isn't the only goal.
5600,Not getting it at all is even better.
5601,One thing we had here was a shortage of people who could give shots.
5602,"So they've had medical students, student nurses and even National Guard medics giving shots."
5603,My shots were given to me by student nurses (Who did a fantastic job I might add both times.
5604,Barely felt a thing).
5605,My wife got her shots at a mass vaccination clinic at Arrowhead Stadium.
5606,"8,000 people in two days."
5607,The shot givers there were mostly National Guard medics and a few EMTs from various communities around the metro area.
5608,I wouldn't mind my dentist giving me a shot in the arm.
5609,You go with whatever gets you to the dance.
5610,Only half of the country gets a flu shot.
5611,"Last years flu season (or current season) we had 9,200 known flu deaths."
5612,A bean counter will come around and crunch numbers and settle at a higher 20k or what ever.
5613,"We shut the world down, everyone (mostly) wears a mask in public, people stay home."
5614,And we have 60x more known deaths.
5615,Meanwhile the people who got their vaccines first are about to start losing protection.
5616,"But yes let’s talk about the never ending covid season being similar to the couple months of flu season where nobody stays home, everyone goes to work and Walmart sick, no masks, and baby fever reducer is only profitable because of daycares."
5617,This is not correct.
5618,The government is in negotiations to trade the AZ vaccines with other nations.
5619,The health authorities have mentioned that a third wave will probably cause them to revert their decision.
5620,"It is not a ban, but a suspension of use as part of the mass vaccination drive."
5621,Ways to allow for voluntary vaccination outside of the official programme are also being explored.
5622,You should add it!
5623,This sub is hilarious.
5624,Cases fall by .4% (yes ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT) and people suddenly declare that it's over.
5625,LMAO
5626,Mine is tomorrow!
5627,You are trying too hard to give Trump zero credit.
5628,How does this help you at all lmfao
5629,The part where we are talking about fraud.
5630,Well I've been in the camp of giving people immunity who don't already have it so that might also influence my thought process.
5631,I think those that have had covid should get to the back of the line and let others go in front (kind of a moot point now though).
5632,One would have to assume that these people probably were asymptomatic carriers but who knows.
5633,This virus is weird.
5634,Thursday for me too!
5635,"I’m in the Moderna club, so I got a Dolly Parton shirt to wear for my appointment 🥳"
5636,"A fifth is a very tiny amount, honestly."
5637,It's amazing so many seniors have it.
5638,"Once it's in their pharmacies and doctor offices, a lot of that fifth will slowly be vaccinated."
5639,They don't understand how to do it and don't have people to help or encourage them.
5640,A doctor simply telling them it's time for a vaccine after their check up will have a big impact.
5641,I can’t argue with this comment.
5642,The Australian Federal Government should have stepped up an fast tracked building  quarantine centres to cope with large number of overseas Australians.
5643,Hotel quarantine is not going to be overly successful against the new strains that are developing the air supply’s are not seperate.
5644,People will be infected while they are in quarantine more often and there is going to breaches of Covid into the outside population.
5645,This would not be a problem if the fools in charge could organise fast vaccination- but they are not able too.

5670,Does your hospital not have high flow devices?

5692,If we can do it with covid there is no reason we shouldn't do it for the flu.
5693,I get mine free on the NHS but most have to pay so they don't get one.
5694,Because even the CDC is now putting out recommendations about talking to people who are antivaxers.
5695,"Just last week, I listened to a podcast talking about how one of the biggest factors in getting people vaccinated was letting them know that others they know were vaccinated with no ill effects."
5696,"In fact, a google search shows all kinds of results on it."
5697,"So when someone says ""I'm not getting the vaccine,"" the recommend approach is to ask why and then try to help people who are unsure of it to get some material that didn't come from their conspiracy theory group."

5708,"Even the state with the worst elderly vaccination metrics, West Virginia, has almost 70% of people 65+ vaccinated (at least one dose)."
5709,Most states with low elderly vaxx rates tend to also have low general population vaccine uptake—their vaccine problem is that not enough people want to take the shot.
5710,There’s plenty available for anyone who wants an appointment.
5711,"Your argument might’ve been valid months ago, but it’s not with the current progress of our vaccine rollout."

5718,I saw it all the time with Asian tourists in England.
5719,"We don't get many of them where I live, the students from Asia where odd."
5720,Every fall you would see a large influx of Asian students in masks.
5721,Come November few if any of them seem to wear them anymore.
5722,The students stayed but the masks where probably saved for traveling.

5729,Cases going up after you start reopening schools stores etc... sounds kinda normal to me the real question is are these people getting very sick or not.
5730,Being an expert isn't a yes or no but more of a continuum.
5731,"They learn far more about vaccines than the average person, but even full blown doctors may not consider themselves experts in the field of vaccines due to their specialty focus."

5738,I don't think so in my country I will probably be among the last t get the vaccine and my government said probably early september at the earliest.
5739,Looking at vaccination rate maybe it will happen late August but not before.
5740,Let's just hope that there is no kidnapping plot or a coup planned for the Governor.
5741,That is the part that scares me about the situation in Michigan.
5742,And what does that have to do with me and the need to explain myself to people I don’t know and don’t want knowing my personal life?
5743,As of the end of March over 36k Australians were still standard overseas due to the limits being placed on arrivals.
5744,This is about Australia not even letting those citizens in to go through the testing and quarantine process.
5745,I'm comfortable with the term abandoned being used in this context.
5746,"They were found to be fairly effective against the UK variant, but the Indian variant is another beast entirely"
5747,That might be true if as many as 1/2 the eligible population wasn't actual fucking morons who refuse to get vaccinated.
5748,"""I have a medical condition so I refuse to wear a mask"" = the pandemic continues."
5749,"""It only kills 1% of the people"" = ""I do not understand statistical significance."""
5750,"I'm not going to give a master class on statistical significance, but if you consider something that kills 1% of the population in a year, it becomes close to the most deadly threat to daily life."
5751,It's more than just saying 1%.
5752,It's actually an idiotic statement to say that and proves a failing of education all over the world.
5753,And the pandemic continues because people are too dumb to understand how incredibly significant 1% is.
5754,"""I'm not getting a vaccine because..."" = and the pandemic still continues."
5755,Fed by rumors and lies about vaccine safety and conspiracy theories by soccer moms on Facebook.
5756,"Normally, I'd agree with you if 1-2 people weren't getting vaccinated, but a this point, nah."
5757,Everyone who isn't getting vaccinated better have some legitimate reason for it or they are just doing their best to continue the pandemic as they have been for the last year.
5758,These people are actually real threats to ending the pandemic.
5759,Actually 70% of population fully immunized end of August is a pretty realistic goal IMO.
5760,The deliveries from the companies should give enough vaccines for first shot end of June and second shot end of July.
5761,"To add 4 weeks to account for distribution, administration, waste and possible delivery delays is very reasonable."

5781,"&gt; I lack optimism because I have small children, all under the age of 12."
5782,It’s going to be at least another nine months to a year before they can be vaccinated.
5783,"I doubt it, trials are already under way &amp; teaching unions will throw a fit if children aren't vaccinated."
5784,At most I expect by August for the US so they can be jabbed in time for school.
5785,UK I expect July as that's when we expect to jab all adults.
5786,"If Maine is anything like my state, schools require testing, so they’re catching a ton of asymptomatic cases."
5787,Most people usually test unless they have symptoms.
5788,This makes kids’ infections look like an artificially high % of total cases.
5789,"As far as risk/reward, I think it’s definitely worth it to keep schools open."
5790,There’s also a guaranteed harm in reducing kids’ education quality for a virus that poses very little threat to them.
5791,[removed]
5792,"Invoking fear, as well as being easier to perpetuate unrest amongst the population in order to better keep control measures in place without question."
5793,"Here is the fucking problem:

1) Some people don't want to wear masks, like ever, even though it's crystal clear they work."
5794,"2) Some people don't want to get vaccines, even though they insanely safe and obviously the best way to end the pandemic."
5795,"3) Some people Don't think this virus is deadly, even though it has killed millions of people around the world and over 500,000 Americans."
5796,And these three groups are all the same people.
5797,Fauci is in a very difficult spot because of these idiots.
5798,I am getting increasing pissed off and annoyed at people who don't want to do anything to end this pandemic yet they complain about it all the time.
5799,"If you skip the 2nd mRNA shot you are not considered fully vaccinated, and that might eventually bar you from something."
5800,"They are also not studying long term efficacy of single dose regimen, so you won't know how long it would last."
5801,So is the solution to increase taxes on the rich?
5802,Most people here are pessimistic &amp; obsessively keep track of covid.
5803,There are a few us optimists but we are usually drowned out by those still worried.
5804,But it's a lot easier being optimistic if you have had your jab &amp; your community has high take up rates.
5805,There is a very simple way of checking it.
5806,Get most recent Chile deaths and categorize it by age.
5807,Then compare the proportion of deaths in each age during the entire course of the pandemic.
5808,I assume that Chile as most countries prioritized the elderly.
5809,"If the average victim of covid is getting younger and younger, there is a very clear sign that the vaccines are working."
5810,"I suspect that this exactly what is happening, but a headline ""vaccines work as expect"" do not get as many clicks."
5811,"Okay thanks for confirming that your argument isn't ""We couldn't do it"" it's ""I don't want to do it""

If a one month serious lockdown and strict test and quarantine requirements for outsiders is ""losing your freedom"" for you then you are part of the problem."
5812,good luck with that
5813,I’m well-aware of the challenges of messaging to the entire public.
5814,"Fauci isn’t going it alone-he develops his message with a whole team of officials, some of whom are scientists and some of whom are PR types."
5815,"The message they have chosen is not appropriate for this point in the pandemic, and they’ve lost huge swaths of the public."
5816,"If they’re losing public trust, they’re behind the curve."
5817,"Trump isn’t President anymore, so he can’t be blamed for recent loss of trust."
5818,What uphill battle?
5819,We’re vaccinating at a rapid pace.
5820,Michigan has peaked.
5821,The only “uphill battle” is to get hesitant people to take the vaccine.
5822,How do you do it?
5823,By boasting the all the normal things it’s safe for the vaccinated public to do.
5824,Don’t accidentally talk down your own vaccine by being over-cautious.
5825,"Fauci is a scientist who might not think of these angles, but as a figurehead, he should."
5826,That’s why he has support staff for his communications.
5827,They’re finally coming around to this.
5828,Do I know better than Fauci about virology?
5829,No.
5830,But do I know enough about government to realize we’re getting PR spin just as much as the candid advice of an expert?
5831,Yes.
5832,Yes we do they fare pretty well.
5833,Recent outbreak after one dose of AZ in a UK care home resulted in only asymptomatic cases.
5834,The fuck happened to the comments?
5835,"I find the masks on tv annoying, especially the inconsistencies."
5836,"One scene out doors no people around, lets run with the mask on cause reasons."
5837,Next scene indoors with strangers lets take the mask off.
5838,NCIS new Orleans is the worst for it but the inconsistency bugs me.
5839,"Driving some where in car with everyone no mask, get out the car put masks on to stand next to each other."
5840,The masks on shows seem to have no rationale past pretending to be covid aware.
5841,"The crowds from the past cheer me up, while introverted it's a tantalizing prospect of returning to normality."
5842,And more importantly provides hope even on the darkest days we will return to normal soon.
5843,"But it has been a brutal lockdown here in the UK, my region has more or less been locked down hard since November."
5844,This particular pandemic?
5845,"As endemic, yes."
5846,And yes.
5847,"For our safety, of course."
5848,None of your business.
5849,We don’t need to air our medical conditions in the air to appease people who don’t need to know
5850,You shouldn't have to guess
5851,"If you're eligible and not allergic, what reasons do you have to not get vaccinated?"
5852,"Not getting a vaccine that is recommended for you by healthcare professionals, by definition, makes you an antivaxer."
5853,TL;DR Hypoxia causes brain damage
5854,"Im Canadian and I agree, the Anti-American stuff ppl kept saying was stupid

You help neighbours when theyre down, not shit on them, this aint a competition"
5855,I guess you have to estimate the accumulated risk of Covid while waiting for the preferred vaccine.
5856,That's just politicians intentionally under promising to score political points afterwards once those lackluster goals are crushed.
5857,I wish we had the transparency the Swedish or Dutch governments have regarding vaccine deliveries and timetables.
5858,My college has required flu vaccines my entire time here and there are never any issues with that
5859,In this case allocation was by population but there is little demand in rural GA. Nobody wants to be microchipped just to prevent the flu.
5860,"Honestly, a strict lockdown across the world is probably all that can stop this wave."
5861,"Even in countries that are using a vaccine with higher efficacy, we have no idea how they're going to fare against some of the dangerous new variants."
5862,"So practically, CoronoVac - the Chinese made vaccine, is proving to be not the most efficient vaccine out there."
5863,"It is only able to hinder the virus fifty three percent at time, for two doses."
5864,"Sadly, the article does not note that Coronovac is also the easiest to obtain for poorer countries as richer western countries had practically monopolized better faring vaccines."
5865,No data on how it is effective across ages was provided.
5866,How about you stop wanting the US to become China.
5867,The US was founded on the principle of freedom.
5868,You seem to hate that.
5869,I don’t think this is accurate otherwise we would see a much larger percentage of young people with strong reactions.
5870,"&gt; When you ban your own citizens from entering, you abandon them."
5871,Requiring them to go though the same hotel quarantine and testing process as everyone else is not abandonment its called taking a smart approach.
5872,"&gt; And in a country of 350 million people, no lockdown is going to work."
5873,People will always break whatever rules there are.
5874,Then you harshly punish and arrest and jail anyone who refuses to comply.
5875,"Make people either comply because of science, or because of fear."
5876,Stop making excuses for why we didn't handle it correctly and own up to the fact that we have to this day politicians being against the science for political gain.

5881,"Accordingly, while the pandemic continues, Moderna will not enforce our COVID-19 related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic."
5882,"Further, to eliminate any perceived IP barriers to vaccine development during the pandemic period, upon request we are also willing to license our intellectual property for COVID-19 vaccines to others for the post pandemic period."""
5883,Nicest thing I've heard all day :)
5884,The NY Times is talking about covid and how people fail to understand risk.
5885,"&gt; The vaccines have nearly eliminated death, hospitalization and other serious Covid illness among people who have received shots."
5886,The vaccines have also radically reduced the chances that people contract even a mild version of Covid or can pass it on to others.
5887,&gt;Yet many vaccinated people continue to obsess over the risks from Covid — because they are so new and salient.
5888,"&gt;To take just one example, major media outlets trumpeted new government data last week showing that 5,800 fully vaccinated Americans had contracted Covid."
5889,"That may sound like a big number, but it indicates that a vaccinated person’s chances of getting Covid are about one in 11,000."
5890,The chances of a getting a version any worse than a common cold are even more remote.
5891,&gt;But they are not zero.
5892,And they will not be zero anytime in the foreseeable future.
5893,Victory over Covid will not involve its elimination.
5894,Victory will instead mean turning it into the sort of danger that plane crashes or shark attacks present — too small to be worth reordering our lives.
5895,&gt;That is what the vaccines do.
5896,"If you’re vaccinated, Covid presents a minuscule risk to you, and you present a minuscule Covid risk to anyone else."
5897,"A car trip is a bigger threat, to you and others."
5898,About 100 Americans are likely to die in car crashes today.
5899,The new federal data suggests that either zero or one vaccinated person will die today from Covid.
5900,"&gt;It’s true that experts believe vaccinated people should still sometimes wear a mask, partly because it’s a modest inconvenience that further reduces a tiny risk — and mostly because it contributes to a culture of mask wearing."
5901,It is the decent thing to do when most people still aren’t vaccinated.
5902,"If you’re vaccinated, a mask is more of a symbol of solidarity than anything else."
5903,Funny how my government (Spain) keeps making quite lackluster promises.
5904,Last week they said 70% of the population would be immunized by the end of August.
5905,And in my region (Galicia) the official target is similarly unambitious: all the over 60s by the end of June.
5906,"When you ban your own citizens from entering, you abandon them."
5907,"And in a country of 350 million people, no lockdown is going to work."
5908,People will always break whatever rules there are.
5909,In some member states with high vaccine hesitancy probably even half of june
5910,"Okay and if we did a real lockdown and banned everyone from entering (including our own citizens) and did hotel quarantining for everyone coming into the country and required mandatory negative tests like them, we could have been able to prevent the spread."
5911,Size of the country is irrelevant.
5912,"Getting my second moderna shot this afternoon, can I take Advil after getting it to help my arm pain or will that mess something up?"
5913,They're also islands with very little people on them compared to the US and UK.
5914,&gt;Is there a particular reason why countries like India and Brazil cannot manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine?
5915,But they do?

5917,"&gt;Vaccine reluctance is seriously concentrated in certain demographics—mainly conservatives, and conservative men in particular."
5918,I don’t think this is because conservatives are literally incapable of understanding the nuances of what I described above.
5919,It’s because conservative media willfully undermines trust in the vaccines and in public health officials.
5920,"They play dumb, pretend like they don’t understand nuance, and suggest that public health officials are ill-intentioned."

5944,Where did you hear that?
5945,I got vaccinated by the military and they told me that you have zero immunity until the second dose.
5946,Depends on where you lived.
5947,Some areas had local restrictions over Christmas which were strict but these were not national and we didn’t go into lockdown until January.
5948,"Yes that is a long time, but of course that’s not relevant to this strict national lockdown we have been talking about so far which started in Jan and ended in March."
5949,The only reason for you to decide to bring up a load of time we weren’t in lockdown while avoiding the point is you do actually agree that Jan to March is not a very long time but don’t want to admit it.
5950,Thought we were actually getting somewhere but I see I expected too much so will go back to the original plan.
5951,Side effects as is in headaches and arm pain and fever... Not death.
5952,So we can stop wearing masks now right?
5953,[removed]
5954,Who is “they” and how do you think a flat percentage works here?
5955,"Good example is in IL the rural people aren’t taking the vaccines for whatever stupid reason, but the cities are chomping at the bit."
5956,Should the cities have to suffer because bumpkins don’t vax?
5957,Over the past month the case count has gone up.
5958,In the last two days the count has gone down.
5959,Let's hope this trend continues!
5960,[removed]
5961,I think it has more to do with your poor language skills.
5962,"Hahaha

I guess people just want to have a beam of hope and anything that crushes it gets DV."
5963,You aren’t wrong but maybe the timing was..
5964,I was hoping masks in school would make it so my kids stopped getting sick but unfortunately that didn't work for us!
5965,Kids are germy AF.
5966,Is that better than most of Europe?
5967,Most of Europe is probably the EU.
5968,They will receive enough vaccines to fully vaccinate 79% of the adult population by the end of June.
5969,"Considering supply is quite unequal among Europe, this means quite a lot of countries will be ahead of Canada by then."
5970,But overall they are extremely similar.
5971,[removed]
5972,Michigan and New York are continuing their decline.
5973,Hard to say about Florida because I think they had reporting issues early last week.

5975,"You have a good amount of safety after your first dose, but it feels like the high first dose numbers are being thrown around too easily."
5976,Are you citing the CDC’s study?
5977,"What about the studies in Israel and UK which, I think, pointed to numbers in the high 60s and low 70s?"
5978,"I don’t fully disagree with your idea that people should feel more comfortable doing things, but whether that protection is actually 80% vs a lower number does seem like it matters."
5979,I got mine at a drug store (Pfizer 1st shot) and I would have rather had it in a community center or health center.
5980,"I am extremely grateful to have the vaccine, but people were absolute jerks and being difficult to control, barging in front of line and hassling the staff, who were very nice."
5981,Going on the 29th for my second.

5994,Literally why is this downvoted?
5995,Do people not understand that they can still catch and spread COVID even if fully vaccinated?
5996,Only like 50% of the population has gotten a single dose.
5997,Whatever trait India had that prevented it from doing what everyone expected from the beginning -- exploding with cases -- doesn't seem to matter to the dominant variant there.
5998,"Vaccination is rolling out slowly and now there's a runaway outbreak, probably many times larger than what's being observed."
5999,"When I go to NYC from the suburbs where I live, there’s a noticeable increase in outdoor mask usage."
6000,"Great, so we agreed from the start then that Fauci is being divisive."
6001,Exactly.
6002,The second shot is more for long term immunity.
6003,I think they must just hit a nerve sometimes.
6004,"My fiance and I got the same vaccine, the first time he felt a pinch and I barely felt anything, just a bit of pressure."
6005,"The second time it switched, I got the pinch and he felt nothing."
6006,So maybe your second one will be a breeze!
6007,Tee hee?
6008,Was that before or after he ordered Florida to fudge numbers?
6009,Was that refreshing too?
6010,Well the media politicized it from day 1 of the pandemic so not surprising.
6011,"I'm vaccinated, so unlike you I can make antibodies against sars-cov-2."
6012,"And because I live in an area where people are rapidly becoming vaccinated the government is easing restrictions on mask use, restaurant capacity, and gatherings."
6013,"Additionally, when a high enough percentage of my colleagues are vaccinated I won't have to wear a mask at work anymore and being vaccinated means I no longer have to stay home from work if I'm exposed to COVID."
6014,I heard they’re desperate for emergency care
6015,This is great news- but I really don’t like the optics of the US vaccinating children when other countries are still in 50+ age phases.
6016,"It might be more nuanced, but it makes me feel a bit icky."
6017,Hahaha.
6018,"Wait, this reads like you think Biden is in charge of state level restrictions when a few months ago y’all were screaming about how this was a state level issue and the president* had no responsibility."
6019,Pick one.
6020,I’m right outside the city in Westchester and very few are wearing masks outside.
6021,You mostly see masks in stores.

6026,I don't think you're the kind of person this article is really talking about.
6027,There are plenty of people who are sticking with full on isolation despite being fully vaccinated - that's fearful.
6028,"There are many people who are vaccinated that still have reason to be careful, that's one group."
6029,I could also see someone having a gathering/event and just not knowing the attendees and wanting to have everyone tested.
6030,Right I forget kids get sick a lot (I have not interacted with a child since I was a child lol).
6031,That makes sense I can see that being a huge pain.
6032,"It's not just the quantity of vaccine, but the distribution that Israel did better on."
6033,The system in the states has been a shitshow.
6034,Anyone who has tried to get appointments on almost any of the websites will attest to how frustrating it was.
6035,"And the high risk population of those over 65 are the least tech savvy, compounding the problem."
6036,"As a start they should have scheduled anyone on Medicare, as that is a large percentage of that at risk population."

6042,"Does anyone know if US airport/airline staff were considered front line workers and had the opportunity to get the vaccine earlier, or if they had to wait for their age groups?"
6043,"I imagine this may have actually depended on the state, but I'm just trying to get an idea."
6044,"He's done far, far worse than my provincial government."
6045,"We've been able to go to a movie theatre or a restaurant since last fall, economy is chugging along just fine, workplaces all open, and hospitals running as normal."
6046,But that's just here - things aren't looking as good elsewhere in Canada.
6047,"But even given that, if you look at the data, it seems very safe to say that he has done worse than every single other provincial government in the country."
6048,"I had been theorizing, and now it appears to be a legit idea, that if you had covid at some point you'd probably react worse to shot 1 since you'd have some level of natural immunity."
6049,Age plays a big part too.
6050,I'm 24 hours after getting Pfizer 1 and nothing but a very sore arm.
6051,Do you know what the poor reaction was related to?
6052,"I know egg allergies are a common cause of vaccine reactions, but that's not a problem with mRNA so you may be ok with Pfizer or Moderna."
6053,Very cool.
6054,The J&amp;J vaccine is paused right now while the CDC and FDA investigate rare cases of more serious side effects.

6070,"So there are at least two possible answers to the different questions that you are asking, the special case of an external RNA (or other genetic material) going into the cell, or the more general case of 'an external molecule telling the cell to make a protein'."
6071,"Every time you get infected with a virus its genetic material (DNA or RNA) goes into the cell, and makes the cell produce the proteins that the virus needs to make more viruses."
6072,"This is pretty much true for every virus, even the ones that cause a regular cold."
6073,Happens to all of us all the time.
6074,"The 'external molecule telling the cell to make a protein' is pretty much how all the cells in your body communicate, and figure out what's going on outside of the cell."
6075,"You eat something sugary, the cell notices the sugar outside, and starts to produce insulin."
6076,"The difference here is that the cell already knows how to make insulin, because that information is stored in its own genome."
6077,"As far as vaccines go, we traditionally mass-produce something that looks like the outside of a virus, and inject it into people to get an immune response, which is a lot of work and takes a long time."
6078,"Now we can use mRNA, and give a few cells in the body instructions to build that stuff for us."
6079,"It's the difference between having to airlift a bunch of prefab shelters to people in need, or flying in a stack of instruction manuals on building shelters with local materials."
6080,A consensus is not necessary to tell us we don't need to wear a mask at all times when taking a walk by ourselves outside.

Sorry for late update!"
6222,Speechless.
6223,"After all this stress, suffering, anxiety, trauma ... God Bless 🇺🇸"
6224,"Once it receives full FDA approval, sure."
6225,We can't even forcibly give it to the military—you know the folks who give up constitutional rights when they sign up—there's zero chance schools will be able to.
6226,Most of the early 20 something year olds have told me they don't want to get it.
6227,"They don't think its ""safe."""
6228,Yes - we should.
6229,I believe we reached our local maximum of cases at the end of last week.
6230,"There had been a weak but sustained uptick nationwide with a rise of over 30% from our late-February lows (with a few states being the primary driver) but I am optimistic we have ""peaked"" for the last time based on where we are with vaccinations (perhaps aided by some seasonal effects)."
6231,"Between natural immunity and vaccine immunity, we're probably at a minimum of 65% of adults with antibodies in less than two weeks (assumes 50% from vaccines + 15% from infection - conservative as probably at least 35-40% of the adult population has had COVID and my guess is that those who got COVID are less likely to have taken the vaccine)."
6232,It’s so easily searched online I don’t get it!!
6233,:)
6234,"Hey, you in the Bay Area?"
6235,Cuz that's exactly how it is right here.
6236,I'm looking for one for my best friend because I have more time to check.
6237,I've been looking for 2 days so far and nothing unless we want to drive an hour+.
6238,If I don't find one in our area by tomorrow we'll have to do the drive because he wants the shot as soon as possible.
6239,it was hot today in CA.
6240,these things are gonna be in the trash this summer.
6241,He’s correct.
6242,"Teachers went after elderly in nursing homes, but before all other elderly."
6243,Google it ?
6244,LOL
6245,"You too, “Vaxxer”!"
6246,[🪓 🥦](https://youtu.be/-mXIL_LKvvI)
6247,Huh?
6248,"In Canada, we are way way behind in the vaccination numbers."
6249,"We don't produce it, so we are dependent on European supply and that supply has been delayed."
6250,Our infection rates are really bad and some provinces are back in extreme lockdown.
6251,"Weird cause the official pfizer booklet I got says ibuprofen is fine, but not to take anything before the shot in 'preperation' for pain or soreness or anything."
6252,"Well done USA, here in Italy we're still trailing behind unfortunately, only a fifth of the population has been vaccinated, which is still far from a safe number for herd immunity."
6253,"And strangely number of deaths are still high, amounting to 350 per day on average"
6254,The subset of young people currently in college is much smaller than the subset of young people.
6255,I personally think public schools requiring it are going to be challenged in court due to the emergency use authorization aspect.
6256,"The reddit rumor I've been reading says if you were infected with Covid, even if asymptomatic, the first shot will have side effects, if not it won't, but the second shot will, but won't if you were previously infected."
6257,"What are the odds of the US opening itself (especially its most touristy states, like CA and NY) to vaccine tourism–just like Alaska did–this summer?"
6258,"I know vaccine tourism has been reported and is happening in areas with loose restrictions, but I'm thinking of a scenario where it's wide open, welcome and supported."
6259,"Sincerely, a desperate foreigner from the developing world who traveled a lot to the US before the pandemic."
6260,*lockdowns
6261,was just thinking about the likely required booster and I heard a doctor on tv say we should likely get the same vaccine as our original.
6262,"if that’s the case, I don’t think I have the heart to come back to J&amp;J for a booster... not after all this, sadly."
6263,If we are OK’d to receive a different type then I would be open to it.
6264,I just feel a bit betrayed tbh.
6265,we were all told that all vaccines were completely safe and effective &amp; I preached this to my friends and family and then this happened :/
6266,[removed]
6267,I just helped two 24 year old friends navigate the numerous portals to find availability that works with their day off.
6268,Helps someone in /r/Orlando created a GDoc with all the direct links.
6269,So it was just a matter of going down the list until we found something that works with their days off.
6270,"There's a lot of options out there, and I almost feel that can overwhelm some people when trying to find a spot."
6271,So I say down Friday with one of them and we just talked it out as he went down the list.
6272,"And boom, first dose yesterday when he was off."
6273,The other friend did similar and found an appt on Wednesday when he's off.
6274,What's hurt the numbers in FL (in theory) is the J&amp;J pause.
6275,The 4 FEMA had been doing second Pfizer by appt and J&amp;J on walk-up.
6276,They're going to start offing Pfizer 1st again starting Tuesday until J&amp;J is back.
6277,The FEMA sites have been hella efficient.
6278,"Most people in Orlando said 15 - 30 minutes from parking to needle, with 15m being the common number."
6279,No it would be impossible in theory to study meaningfully.
6280,If you vaccinate somebody there is no way to compare to a real covid infection because having covid will likely affect vaccine reaction and Vice versa.
6281,Maybe you could do some kind of weird twin challenge study where you infect one and vaccinate another but that’s not gonna happen and would ignore major environmental factors.
6282,There is no evidence to beleive that how you react to a vaccine would have any indication for how your body would do against the virus and any theory is purely speculative.
6283,It’s possible there is a causation or correlation but we’re unlikely to ever know that or at least in the short term.
6284,"Because if we leave these general COVID subreddits to those who are scaredand keep to ourselves in lockdown skeptic subreddits, then we perpetuate the illusion that terror is the only lens through which to view this thing."
6285,There are a lot of people out there afraid to openly question the doctrine due to fear of ostracism.
6286,You're free to say what you want to say and so are we.
6287,COVID subreddits are an ideological battleground because public acceptance of worst-case scenario narratives impacts our lives by enabling the government to subject us to onerous rules dictating what we can and can't do.
6288,"It's important that people know they don't have to stand for this crap, and that they are not alone in feeling this way."
6289,Good
6290,"This is great news,  I'm sure there are a lot of +40 people that have zero issues taking AZ."
6291,"Yea I wasn’t saying we’re done vaccinating, just that there isn’t a bottleneck because of demand for vaccines."
6292,"If you want a vaccine now, there is a dose waiting for you."
6293,Had my first Moderna shot on Friday evening and was good until midday yesterday and when my arm started to get sore as shit and get stiff.
6294,It went away eventually and I presented no other symptoms.
6295,"All-in-all, really not that bad."
6296,Of course!
6297,"It's fascinating to witness it firsthand, even if it's uncomfortable haha"
6298,"If it meant I could get one dose and be good to go I'd take 1 in 10,000 odds for a blood clot frankly."
6299,The point at which cases fell off a cliff in Israel was 39% with one dose and 53% with both.
6300,So the US should be there in a couple weeks.
6301,[removed]
6302,They actually do pose a source of great discomfort and some risk during summer months for those of us who don't work in air conditioned places.
6303,We should aim to not need them by June when temps start getting high.
6304,"That comes from someone who is very pro mask, and I will likely be wearing them next fall and winter when there will be a likely resurgence of all the other respiratory viruses."
6305,"June, July, August though, I can only manage a surgical mask and I would like to be able to go bare face on high heat index days."

6341,That’s awesome.
6342,Progress is a great thing and my mom is going through something similar.
6343,She finally just got rid of her table and cooler where she used to quarantine her food/mail/etc.
6344,It's a dilemma to a degree.
6345,"Go too hard on trying to get everyone to obey restrictions, whether vaccinated or not, and you risk giving the message that the vaccines don't work, or at least don't reduce spread, and therefore drive vaccine hesitancy."
6346,"Allow the vaccinated to have more privileges, and since the more vulnerable are vaccinated first, the largely younger and healthy unvaccinated population will wonder why they have to remain under restrictions when they don't feel at risk and feel that those who need protection, have it."
6347,Spoiler alert: It won't be.
6348,In my state at least.
6349,Other states (Florida) have been normal for quite a while now.
6350,My mother is old enough that she has the scar on her arm.
6351,"She doesn't remember if it was from a polio or a small pox vaccine, but yeah."
6352,She remembers.
6353,And she's happy she can start a little normality again.
6354,The huge majority of her 55+ community is vaccinated fully now...and they've opened up bingo again on Fridays.
6355,That’s...what they want?
6356,"For young people, ""faster"" isn't an acceptable modifier."
6357,"If you tell them they need to study for a test next week, most of them will do so."
6358,"But if you tell them to start studying now for a test they'll get in a few months, as long as the rest of the class gets acceptable scores on homework along the way, you won't get near the compliance."
6359,"Vaccinated or not people need to get outside and get sunlight, fresh air, and exercise."

6384,Friday evening I sat down at a little hole in the wall bar I frequent and loaded up a list of all the locations in Orlando offering the vaccine.
6385,The bartender (around 23 or 24 years old) and I went down the list until we found a pharmacy with availability for yesterday (Saturday) so he could make an appt.
6386,"He's off Sat Sun Mon, so it worked out well."
6387,Sometimes it just takes a friend (or good customer) to help move things along and get the motivation going.
6388,"Checked in with him earlier and thus far just the ""who punched me in the arm"" discomfort."
6389,"It helps that someone in /r/Orlando made a simple Google Docs spreadsheet with all the pharmacies and county sites offering, and included direct links."
6390,So we were able to start at the top of the list and move down until we found availability.
6391,Another friend of mine around the same age just used the same spreadsheet to find and make him an appt as well.
6392,"So a lot of that age group want it, but occasionally you have to grab the reins and lead them to the watering hole."
6393,It'll be good when the FEMA sites gear up first doses again during the J&amp;J pause...
6394,They had moved to second only Pfizer by appt and J&amp;J walk-up.
6395,On Tuesday they'll start Pfizer 1st again until they can go back to J&amp;J.

6405,Amen!
6406,&gt;Individual states in the US are nowhere near 90% vaccinated.
6407,And they're considered to be doing well with the vaccine rollout.
6408,"Individual states in the U.S. can't be 90% vaccinated, because we don't have enough vaccine for that."
6409,&gt;Is it really that hard for Westerners on this sub to give credit to the Eastern countries for demonstrating how to effectively handle a pandemic?
6410,I did.
6411,"I said, ""Their secret was having a small population"", which is why they vaccinated so many more people than most countries."
6412,"Yeah as a Canadian, we and Japan are way behind the UK."
6413,Although things are looking really good over the next couple months in Canada.
6414,We will get enough Pfizer alone to vaccinate everyone outstanding over 18 with the first dose.
6415,"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219
In the US it is 22.3% under 18."
6416,Other countries have quite different numbers though.
6417,Take it after the shot and when you feel the side effects.
6418,Don’t take it before the shot.
6419,Will they be able to manufacture it though?

6430,They paid not only with money but very valuable data which continues to come in as the vaccine shows its real world efficacy.
6431,"Doubling down on the shortsightedness, I see."
6432,Love it!
6433,"And how, specifically, do you think someone's going to save $100 a week starting at age 18 when the typical 20-something is leaving college with $30,000 in debt?"
6434,Do you even live in the real world?
6435,What are your feelings regarding states repealing mask mandates and how is the situation in your state?
6436,I just thought I'd post this question here to get a real feel for folxs' reactions to it
6437,It must be location specific in the bay then.
6438,I looked on Tuesday and found an appointment in scc for a site 20 min away and it was 20 min to line up and get the shot.
6439,Roundtrip tickets between US and Spain go for as low as $400 before the pandemic.
6440,It’s not really that much as a transcon ticket within the US can cost you that much.
6441,Oh yeah I know and I'm not belittling that at all.
6442,Our response was terrible.
6443,"I still think that Australia has done the best, but I just imagine the media narrative changing somewhat."
6444,Just look how quickly the image of the UK and US has changed despite them probably handling it the worse out of all developed countries.
6445,Has Scomo not dropped the plan of getting everyone vaccinated by the end of the year?
6446,Big difference between your average anti-vaxxer and someone who elects not to take the COVID vaccine yet
6447,IIRC it was about 5.7 in early spread (I.e.
6448,: Italy pre lockdowns).
6449,"It wouldn't be that now, because even with everything ""back to normal"" people will at least act slightly differently."
6450,We're absolutely not going to play this game where we're wearing masks thru 2022 and beyond because of possible variants or because a small % of people got covid after getting the vax.
6451,That's just opening the door to indefinite mask mandates and lockdowns.
6452,"After the vax is available to everyone who wants it, that's enough"
6453,Wait why are you complaining then?
6454,Or you could just give them their lives back?
6455,I know many people who aren't getting the vaccine because they see no point if they have to keep wearing masks and social distancing.
6456,Instead of trying to scare them with unlikely scenarios how about incentivize them with one of the largest benefits of the vaccine we've been holding back for some reason?
6457,"So, can Europeans take a trip to Alaska to get one of those Pfizer or Moderna doses?"

6463,We should totally set up a vaccine clinic in Peace Arch Park
6464,[Booking link](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/vaccine-locations)
6465,By end of May we'll have most adults who want a vaccine already given at least one shot.
6466,New vaccinations will have slowed to a trickle.
6467,"This is only my opinion, but at that point we've done everything we can do and we open up and move on."
6468,There should be enough vaccinations at that point to squash covid down to a mundane level of risk.
6469,You could say it indirectly is.
6470,Other countries need any vaccines badly.
6471,Right.
6472,"I can already hear the dipshits, if he says June 1st no more masks, they will be shitting out memes about how the virus magically goes away at midnight May 31st, and how this has all been a farce."
6473,Fuckin eggheads.
6474,"Your children aren't traveling far, right?"
6475,Wouldn't this mean if the adults and (hopefully soon) teenagers get vaccinated this will make it hard for pockets of infection to travel?
6476,"Must feel good to be rich, ha?"
6477,I see it too.

6494,He's leaving Tuesday for a fishing trip &amp; I booked him a flight to see his best friend while we are in Mexico.
6495,"He was hesitant at first, but we have taken baby steps with him."
6496,"Once he saw I was comfortable going back to life as usual, he followed along pretty quickly."
6497,Helping the people around me understand how life changes post-vaccine is what I can offer right now.

6508,The only people I know personally who won’t get the vaccine have only a high school education.
6509,The other two have families that immigrated from Africa and are religious.
6510,"There are certain communities where it isn’t surprising that they are skeptical due to misinformation, lack of education, and idiotic religious beliefs."
6511,It is scary that so many of these types of people are taking care of our country’s elderly.
6512,No wonder there are so much abuse and neglect in these places.
6513,Our society should care enough about our seniors that the people working in these facilities should have higher education requirements and be paid more.
6514,"In most cases side effects (other than arm pain) seem to kick in 10+ hours after, so going to work right after will probably be fine."
6515,Sounds like your unvaccinated friends are a bunch of cowards.
6516,In fact I was in the stage I trial.
6517,Feeling fine and so glad to see the vaccine shows promise.
6518,"What I find disappointing is that government did not allow combined stage 2 and 3, so the vaccine cannot be approved this year."
6519,And with the ongoing vaccine rollout it will not be an easy task for them to enroll people from all age groups for those trials.
6520,"It's important to point out that the vaccine is also VERY effective at preventing you from having any infection as all, and thus preventing you from being able to spread the virus."
6521,It's just not 100% effective.
6522,"Really, at this point, the only major reason for keeping a universal mask mandate is that as soon as you ""mandate"" it for only unvaccinated people, you're on an honor system suggestion and not a mandate."
6523,The UK is not the US
6524,"Yea you can, it’s enforceable the moment you sign it."
6525,Yes agreed!
6526,"Possibly, but they stand little chance when they will be suppressed in a matter of a couple months."
6527,Less fortunate countries don’t have that advantage.
6528,"There are plenty of people downplaying the virus and saying you can ""live your life"" if you're young and unvaccinated."
6529,It's an endemic problem in this sub.

6538,Hoping that when demand slacks off in US they are able to export more to other countries
6539,That’s nuts.
6540,"Here in Canada not a single low risk person under 55 has had one (not really, but close)."
6541,I can’t get a vaccine within 6 hours of my house.
6542,It’s infuriating
6543,Yeah that’s what I’ve been hearing.
6544,It’s possible.
6545,"Also, I’m 16 and apparently young people react worse."
6546,I honestly think that point in time will be around when kids get out of school for the summer so I think everything will just jive together well timing wise
6547,The headline is kind of a no-brainer but the article below it talks about some reasons people haven't gotten the vaccine yet.
6548,The next BIG risk is not distributing it worldwide to help prevent devastating variants.
6549,I didn't downvote.
6550,I just commented.
6551,Yes this.
6552,My first does laid me out completely for 48hrs.
6553,I’m at 72hrs and am still feeling fatigue and just kinda meh.
6554,I got mine on Thursday and Friday at work was a struggle.
6555,My next dose I’m doing on Friday so I don’t have to try to work through that again.
6556,Pretty good availability here in Northern VA burbs of DC.
6557,Fairfax Co and Arlington have been killing it on distribution.
6558,There are large govt sites and pharmacies all in on the distribution.
6559,Get my second on Thursday!
6560,35+ y/o
6561,Maine still isn't in a great place for vaccination rate as evidenced by cases continuing to rise.

6584,"I don't think anyone's downplaying the virus, the truth is that it isn't a risk for young, healthy people."
6585,Opening to tourists would make the problem worse.
6586,There would be more people taking up quarantine spots.
6587,"The whole notion of vaccine cards is not helping encourage people to get the vaccine, if for no other reason than to be rebellious."

6595,Its funny what 3 months of competent leadership can do.....the USA was the laughing stock when it came to COVID last Christmas and now we are basically lapping the rest of the world with vaccinations
6596,No need to downvote hence the question mark

6601,"I live in Brooklyn NY, and in both places that were giving the vaccine all of the seats were empty and in one the guy giving the shots in one was just straight up sleeping at his laptop."
6602,We should send these J&amp;J vaccines to poorer nations which aren’t doing as well with the vaccinations.

6621,"It’s really amazing when you compare it to last year, we’ve come a long way."
6622,Because the standard dose numbers is what they subsequently tested in all future trials.
6623,"Their low dose numbers was some weird fuck up that wasn't intended and you want to compare apples to apples by using the standard dose result, since that's what was used for all other subsequent trials."
6624,"It was also intended to show how results can vary by country, without it being some conspiracy."
6625,"The US trial was largely data from the US and came out at 76%, which is a far cry from 60% and definitely a far cry from 10% in South Africa."
6626,It did piss poor in South Africa as the South African variant is 93% of the cases in that trial.
6627,It was yet another example of how variants can cause large fluctuations in efficacy results without it being a massive conspiracy.
6628,You know.. the same kind of variants that have been running absolutely wild in Brazil.
6629,You asked for proof of huge variations in vaccine efficacy results and I gave it to you.
6630,They occur due to geographical and temporal differences since   variants are cropping up at different rates in different locations at different times.
6631,"Now you're still backtracking, deflecting and spinning things."
6632,Oh well.

6689,So what if we need a booster shot and then a yearly one?
6690,The only reason it's a scramble right now is because the demand for the vaccine far outweighs the supply.
6691,By fall there will be a vaccine available for everyone who wants it.
6692,By next year it'll be no different than a flu shot.

6703,"According to the chart, NH was supply constrained, the only state to use up 100% of vaccine supply."
6704,"Last I heard, there was a federal formula for the distribution of vaccines, which *isn't* based on local demand — or if it is, it's at least delayed."
6705,"I'd say, then, that it's a combination of (a) an extra willing populace, and (b) a federal formula that favors smaller states."
6706,"Expanding on (a): NH is one of the better educated, older, whiter, least evangelical, least ""hippy enclave"", and (contrary to popular belief) least ""libertarian enclave"" states out there."
6707,All of those details would point towards a state that is going to be disproportionately pro-vaccine.

6779,&gt;It's just not right that less fortunate countries have to rely on vastly inferior medical technology.
6780,For the time being the infrastructure (super awesome freezers) we need for the current round of mRNA vaccines make shipping them to less fortunate countries untenable.
6781,They already have this problem even though nobody is telling them they should wear two.
6782,In fact they are already outraged about being forced to wear *three* masks and mocking it by sharing memes of people wearing a hundred.

6799,"That first Moderna shot kicked my ass, felt like I had full blown covid again for a day."
6800,Get it over with and be the proof on concept.
6801,The whole world needs to see a nation of 10mil+ back to complete normal before vaccination requirements can be rationally pushed.
6802,Israel very much needed the vaccines.
6803,I have never seen a culture so in need of touching everything.
6804,"Food, objects, each other, you name it."
6805,I worked there for months and it seemed outside of Tel Aviv people didn't understand personal space whatsoever.
6806,Which means they were waiting to uncover more cases when they told doctors specifically to look for it like we saw in the UK with the AZ shot.
6807,"If a hundred came through over the last week, we would have a much harder decision."
6808,"Most of the J&amp;J shots were put in arms during the lead up to the pause (Catalent’s stockpile was approved), so it was prudent to stop and take stock of further issues."
6809,"Our county, Montgomery outside of Philly is rising back up to holiday numbers."
6810,"It is a pretty liberal area where mask wearing and covid precautions are taken seriously, and there is a high demand for vaccines."
6811,"Less than a month ago we had dipped below 5%, less than 50 cases most days."
6812,Now we're back up to 9% and 250-300 new cases a day.
6813,"Our school also had their first outbreak, after being in person 5 days since August, with 10 kids in one class getting infected."
6814,This post appears to be about vaccines.

6816,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
6817,*
6818,"I just looked at the current vaccinated numbers from the New York times, and the other commenter's statement doesn't seem too far off."
6819,"It seems almost as if they looked at the numbers a few days ago and said what they remember  Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Alabama are all currently between Georgia at 19.1% of the population having are least one dose and Louisiana at 23.3% of the population having are least one dose."
6820,"In contrast,  other then New Hampshire, the next top 7 states are between 45% and 50% of the population having at least one dose."
6821,I don't see U.S. doing anything.
6822,It's clearly Canadian research?
6823,I'm glad my university is planning on requiring the vaccination for the fall.
6824,"Even if there's no guarantee of that and there are exceptions able to be made, everyone knows if we don't reach a certain threshold of vaccinations by the end of August in person classes aren't happening."
6825,No one wants to be blamed for that.
6826,They should look at some statistics.
6827,"Seriously, hundreds of millions of doses are being distributed."
6828,Risk assessment even for the healthiest of individuals makes vaccination favorable just based off numbers alone.
6829,People die for all kinds of reasons.
6830,"There's a reason we deal with automotive deaths by wearing seatbelts, not by totally stopping to use cars."
6831,It’s not that novel.
6832,"It’s just a coronavirus, which we do know a lot about."
6833,"No one says it’s not dangerous, but little about Covid at this point is particularly surprising, development or otherwise."
6834,There are certain scenarios that are more likely than others based on what we know.
6835,A variant appearing and completely wiping out vaccine mediated immunity in the near future is as likely as many other science fiction scenarios.
6836,the fact that you get downvoted and the other comments under this get upvoted is just so wrong
6837,&gt;Forcing a person to disclose their disability is a big no-no per ADA.
6838,"Not in this context, since making an exception for them is the opposite of discrimination."
6839,"If having to disclose disabilities was illegal on this context, then exceptions and other privileges wouldn't legally exist because people don't receive them without disclosing that they need help."
6840,Make Apple require young people to be vaccinated inorder to buy an iPhone.
6841,Which is why you're expected to quarantine upon entry.
6842,The test upon exit will also then flag if you are sick and should then notify any people you made contact with
6843,[removed]
6844,This has yet to be observed with any reinfection with Covid.
6845,"It’s a possibility, but it’s not likely."
6846,because claiming a corrupt undeveloped country is corrupt and undeveloped is not really headline news worthy...
6847,"If you wanna be the smart guy who's not falling for optimistic propaganda, you need to offer something more solid than this."
6848,&gt;unfortunately this nightmare is far from over.
6849,"Real world data from Israel suggest that the vaccines we currently have are extremely effective at blocking the spread and even more effective at preventing severe disease, which means we'd be able to control the spread without needing additional NPIs."
6850,Why do you assume it wouldn't be true?
6851,Do you have new data?
6852,"&gt;By the time we come close to vaccinating a decent amount of the population a booster shot will be required

How do you know that exactly?"
6853,&gt;we will need yearly shots.
6854,Like we do for the flu?
6855,&gt;Oh and the subject that is completely ignored which is that the virus is spreading through endless amounts of animals which we haven't even begun to consider the mutations that are yet to jump back to humans from that.
6856,And?
6857,We'll deal with the problem once we have it.
6858,Luckily covid doesn't mutate as quickly as the flu.
6859,"&gt;No amount of complaining will change the reality of the situation and if you don't take this seriously yet, just wait until someone you love dies and see how fast your attitude changes."
6860,Huh?
6861,"No one is saying stop all restrictions now, but why shouldn't that be the case once a sufficient % of the population is vaccinated?"
6862,"The thing is, this virus actually mutates slower than the flu and escpailly HIV."
6863,The only problem is that it’s spreading like crazy.
6864,"As people get vaccinated, the number of opptunites for covid-19 to spread and mutate will go down, causing a negative feedback loop."
6865,Are any of the major COVID vaccines going to open source the recipe / manufacturing process?
6866,"It's truly a global issue we're facing right now, and variants are popping up constantly."
6867,"The sooner people are vaccinated, everywhere, the lower the risk will be to everyone."
6868,Is there a particular reason why countries like India and Brazil cannot manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine?
6869,Or the JNJ?
6870,Or are they actually withholding the intellectual property purely for business reasons?
6871,"If so, does that make them scum?"
6872,I hope that American vaccine manufacturing continues to dramatically ramp up so that we can spend the next year or two shipping doses all over the planet.
6873,After two doses the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are at least 95% effective.
6874,CoronaVac is only around 56% effective.
6875,"It's just not good enough, and frankly I'm not as confident in its long term effectiveness as I am for mRNA vaccines when it's so inconsistently useful right away."
6876,"I think after the United States has enough doses to fully vaccinate everyone here, we should obviously allow manufacturers to sell vaccines elsewhere, but when the orders are fulfilled I really think we should begin giving them to countries that would be willing to accept."
6877,It's just not right that less fortunate countries have to rely on vastly inferior medical technology.
6878,"Regardless of the possibility of mutations evading vaccines that could effect us, I just think everyone deserves to be immunized."
6879,"I just think it's the right thing to do, and as the most powerful country in the world I would almost say that makes it the United States' obligation."
6880,&gt;Forcing a person to disclose their disability is a big no-no per ADA.
6881,"Not in this context, since making an exception for them is the opposite of discrimination."
6882,"That’s a common word through around when charctirsts found in 2 other variants are found in 1
But that is BS and fearmongerng because that word is often abused(you can call 2 Bai Raines that have no impact) a double vairaint."
6883,"Your own comment says it all ""very likely that this will be the same for this new variant"" that's just the issue that's feeding this unfettered optimism, you nor anyone else can say it's likely just as much as no one can' say it's unlikely so everything just comes down to opinions because no one can predict how a novel virus will evolve not even experts and I personally prefer to assume the worst to keep it easier to remain vigilant as opposed to assuming the best which breeds compliancy."
6884,Chin diaper
6885,Israel is a great example of a covid failure state making progress but is not a prime ex@mole of how to manage the pandemic as a  whole.
6886,But media keeps saying it doesn't spread in schools
6887,Man you are right - when will the kids be able to go out and have a beer?
6888,Jk - it was the way you wrote it.
6889,Stay safe and strong.
6890,"If you want to point the finger at anyone, point it at big pharma."
6891,They should open source these COVID vaccines and allow/assist lower income countries in producing their own supply.
6892,"It's unreasonable to expect the US to vaccinate India, Brazil &amp; similar countries."
6893,These are big economies which have the resources to produce vaccines domestically.
6894,"Where is this 1 in 50,000 from?"
6895,The idea that it was the person in the trial who had it?
6896,"Well, they’re using sinovac, and many only got the first dose."
6897,The tricyclics at low doses can be very effective - especially amitryptaline.
6898,The higher doses are sedating but low (10-20mg) doses can be stimulating.
6899,It goes against the usual dose-response curve so you need to find a decent quack.
6900,"You're right, it's not a fair comparison."
6901,"Because even per capita, the US has far far far greater resources."
6902,Individual states or counties in the US with similar populations have budgets several times higher.
6903,&gt;Forcing a person to disclose their disability is a big no-no per ADA.
6904,Not when they're seeking an exception due to disability.
6905,"&gt; It’s riskier for you to drive to get the vaccine then to actually get the vaccine still

I hear a lot of people saying this, seems weird."
6906,Let's maths it out.
6907,"I'll include both the drive there and back, to be fair."
6908,"Vaccine: 20 deaths in 20m, say."
6909,So that would be about 66 deaths scaled up to the UK population.
6910,"A) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/922717/reported-road-casualties-annual-report-2019.pdf

B) https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/average-car-journey-uk  (source: dept of transport)

A) 1800 people each year die in the UK to traffic accidents."
6911,B) average 1.1 car journeys per day.
6912,Sounds low to me but OK.
6913,Though this is only 'car journeys'.
6914,"Road accidents would also include bikes, pedestrians, ..."
6915,"Anyway, that's 1800/365*1.1 = 4 people die in traffic accidents, statistically, if the whole country does 1 car journey there and back."
6916,So from trips to get vaccinated we'd expect 4 people to be lost and from vaccination we'd expect 66 based on what we know.
6917,Any mistakes in my maths?

6980,This is covid in America in a nutshell actually.
6981,I think there are a couple things at play here.
6982,"First, as a public health official, he has to err on the side of caution and be conservative about safety measures until there is truly enough science to back up a relaxing of policy."
6983,"Once a more lax policy is announced, they can never take that back."
6984,"Second, I hope that the messaging will be used to encourage the vax-hesitant crowd by saying, ""hey, the vaccines are so effective that you can stop wearing a mask after you get it"" to keep vaccine uptake going strong."
6985,"A lot of people have the attitude of, ""if nothing changes *for me*, then what's the point?"""
6986,This might help address that.
6987,"If it makes you feel any better, your sarcasm was readily apparent to me upon reading your comment."
6988,Got lucky for my mother.
6989,She's in a 55+ community and one of the guys here isbretired FDNY and he works with the locks FD for a lot of stuff like smoke detector installs for the elderly.
6990,"With his connections, they got a county run pop-up for Moderna back around late January."
6991,"It's a larger community, so they got around 300 65+."
6992,"Now that the age is lowered to everyone, they've run another pop-up."
6993,"Unsure what the numbers were for that, but I know it was most of the community."
6994,"My bother got his Pfizer via the VA.

And low and behold, 3 weeks ago my trial site told me I'm in the Active Group, so I've actually been vaccinated since November."
6995,"And yep, we're a very diverse household."
6996,"😎 Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J."
6997,"The vaccine was never expected to be 100% effective against death, even though all the trials incorrectly said so."
6998,"All the trials combined had something like 3 deaths and 50 hospitalizations, and of course all were in the placebo arm."
6999,Even taking that 50-0 split gives something like a [97.5% lower bound for efficacy under a reasonable bayesian prior](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sca8jouz8f).
7000,74/77M is roughly a 10^-6 chance of death.
7001,"Meanwhile among the other 251 million unvaccinated people, there have been 30,000 deaths over the last month (a dubious proxy for vaccinated versus unvaccinated risk, but sufficient to make the point), a 10^-4 chance of death."
7002,That puts the efficacy at somewhere around 99%.
7003,"But this actually vastly understates things, since the first people vaccinated are overwhelmingly those with higher risk, 10-100x so."
7004,The news we're getting about efficacy against death is overwhelmingly good.
7005,"In addition to all that, some of these cases were infected prior to vaccination."
7006,"In Colorado, 20% of deaths happen more than 30 days after symptom onset."
7007,We don't believe vaccines do anything for ongoing infection (sadly) so this surely accounts for some of the deaths.
7008,"The US is trying to exclude those, as the recent news from Michigan shows."
7009,"In other countries, such as Chile where they claim vaccination is only [80% effective at preventing death 42 days after the first dose](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/big-chile-study-finds-chinese-vaccine-slashes-covid-77120616), this could easily account for nearly all of the deaths."
7010,"(Side note: while mRNA vaccines give efficacy [within about a week](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download), others seem to take much longer.)"
7011,Is that you Gym?
7012,"Just reading the first paragraph, the title fails to tell the correct story of the actual results..."
7013,We'll reach a point very soon when every American who wants a vaccine can get one almost immediately.

7018,Do you think the pandemic will last forever?
7019,"I work at a VA hospital, and we are given 2 days of paid leave after the vaccine if we feel under the weather/have side effects."
7020,92% of employees where I work are currently vaccinated.
7021,Yeah this doesn't make any sense at all.
7022,If they were infected 45 days before vaccination and still didnt die until after receiving a vaccine.
7023,Like do people need to worry about being presymptomatic for potentially months before deadly symptoms start.
7024,"&gt;non risk

That's a no from me, chief."
7025,"We can have a conversation about how people's risk assessment has been skewed, but calling covid a ""non risk"" is ridiculous."
7026,"Almost 600,000 dead americans would disagree with you, if they could."
7027,What do you mean anecdotal?

7037,My wife read that article and became super concerned.
7038,The Patriot Act was also supposed to be temporary.
7039,Spitting is assault in many places
7040,"I mean, what you just said sounds like they're readjusting their risk tolerance based on if they're vaccinated or not."
7041,"I would try not to worry too much about what other people's risk tolerance is, it's just gonna drive you nuts."
7042,"I already did this one year early, although my reason was to hide the surgical mask with a fashionable cloth mask, which alone I did not trust enough to protect myself."
7043,Hmm.
7044,Just like how they allocate voting machines.
7045,"AFAIK as with most things, the problem is the population density."
7046,The sheer scale of the requirement here makes getting it out and distributed to enough people to have an impact is a problem.
7047,Add in less than adequate medical infrastructure and the issue becomes even more daunting.
7048,"To be fair though, even with all these issues, I do have give kudos where it's due - atleast in Tier-3/4 cities like I am right now, it wasn't as difficult as it seemed for my parents to get the first dose of vaccination a few weeks ago."
7049,The registration and vaccination for elders had been going well enough IMO at that time.
7050,Now on the other hand is a completely different matter with the infrastructure crumbling under the huge influx of cases...
7051,"But wearing a seatbelt is incredibly and unacceptably inconvenient, and unbelievably uncomfortable for some people."

7058,"Now, are they in great shape."
7059,Definitely those who are not in great health are worse off.
7060,But the vast majority of people in the US who think they are healthy probably have the wrong definition of healthy in their head.
7061,"The level of obesity in the south, for example, is incredibly high."
7062,How many of those folks think they are healthy?
7063,Get tested.
7064,Holy crap Florida is actually more functional for once than MA!
7065,Florida is 18+ now.
7066,It's too early to tell confidently.
7067,"But I would be extremely surprised if the vaccines were ineffective against it, since they've been effective against all the others."
7068,"It can only mutate so far before it's not even the same virus, and so far the vaccines work fine on all of the studied variants."
7069,"It can be mandated to the military if the president waives the informed consent provision, and the law that currently makes it optional doesn't apply to schools or anything else."
7070,Stay hydrated.
7071,Dehydration headaches are no joke.
7072,I'm interested in why you think the number of deaths wouldn't have been higher without a lockdown.
7073,"You seem so sure of it, as if the current second peak couldn't have been higher."
7074,"Waves will always form a peak, that it exists doesn't mean the lockdown did nothing."
7075,A curve will always have a high point.
7076,"You're being downvoted because there are multiple studies and articles on this very sub that show that masks work, but you've zeroed in on one that says they don't."
7077,"I'm not saying you're coming at this from bad faith, but it's not hard to find studies that show that masks work."
7078,"My source is googling ""mask studies."""
7079,You'll get a lot of info immediately.
7080,"Yeah, people need to start understanding that right now in the states that are seeing increasing in hospitalizations, it's young people that are being hospitalized because the older crowd has already been vaccinated."
7081,"This narrative that young people won't end up in the hospital is just not true, and the data is showing it now."
7082,I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with this.
7083,This pandemic has been really torn the mask off (hah) a lot of people’s selfishness and lack of empathy.
7084,I don't think it's hesitance for many so much as it is apathy.
7085,Most of my friends from university immediately got the vaccine once it was available to them and have been (mostly) following good COVID judgement.
7086,Other people I knew from high school post pictures from bars every weekend like nothing changed.
7087,"Maybe both of these get lumped into""vaccine hesitancy"" but I see them as different phenomena."
7088,"Small correction: it delivers DNA, not mRNA."
7089,"The DNA doesn't integrate with your cells' DNA, but it does make it all the way to the nucleus."
7090,"It's similar to mRNA vaccines in that from that point on the ""machinery"" in the nucleus will read that DNA to produce the spike protein, but mRNA has an edge here in the sense that it only needs to make its way to the cytoplasm instead of all the way to the nucleus."
7091,Are you serious?
7092,You might want to start looking at the numbers where states are seeing increases in hospitalizations.
7093,Here's the news flash for you.
7094,It's not old people in the beds anymore and there are states with absolute increases in hospitalized patients.
7095,Florida and Michigan being just two of them.
7096,Did he mention J&amp;J?
7097,Does no one care that Johnson &amp;j have law suits against them right now?!
7098,Why even... oh never mind.
7099,You shouldn't be paranoid.
7100,"While there is some decreased efficacy against the SA variant, you're still very well protected from getting infected, and even in the slim chance that you do, you're EXTREMELY protected from becoming seriously ill."
7101,"Still follow local health guidelines, but other than that, try to relax."
7102,The worst is behind you.
7103,"So, I've been wanting to ask this for a little bit, at the risk of sounding condescending, how are you guys so comfortable getting the vaccine?"
7104,"Originally my plan was to wait for about a year to see results, and the most effective brands, but with the J &amp; J scare, I'm genuinely nervous to get the vaccine."
7105,"I don't want to rejoin society and pretend covid doesn't exist, I plan to eventually get the vaccine but right now it feels safer to quarantine rather than risk the effect of the vaccine."
7106,"Looking for genuine insight, again this post was not meant to be condescending I really just want to better understand the thought process and get to a place where I feel comfortable with one of the vaccine options"
7107,The people who aren't at risk of death or hospitalization are very small crowd.
7108,"In fact, they probably are too young to get vaccinated."
7109,"If you're over 20 or so, the vaccine is definitely worth it, because the trend right now is that younger people are the ones being hospitalized, particularly in the states where there is an absolute increase in the number of people hospitalized."
7110,This narrative that young people don't get hospitalized needs to die (pun intended).
7111,"If that’s the case, why are they telling us we still need to wear them after vaccination?"
7112,"So when you were vulnerable, of course everybody wore make to protect you."
7113,Now that you are less likely to get infected and it is too much to ask you to extend the courtesy and wear a mask so that everyone else can get the chance to get vaccinated as well?
7114,"Just shows, we did prioritize the wrong people with the vaccination campaigns."
7115,Fun fact: Pfizer's Head of Vaccine Research and Development is named Katherine Jansen.
7116,That's not how it works.
7117,It's 90 something percent effective on top of the current chance of being infected which is something like 40% even in face to face interaction.
7118,"[Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was a single shot, but they kept having little outbreaks so eventually gave everyone a second shot."
7119,These days the shots are separated by a few years.
7120,[Polio](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782271/) vaccination was much earlier and probably a lot more complicated.
7121,"It may have coincided to a large degree with research on how viral vaccination (inactivated, attenuated, etc) works."
7122,Hepatitis A and B vaccines are another good viral example - more modern than either measles or polio.
7123,Both are given in several doses with good separation to give ~lifetime immunity.
7124,I haven't heard of another vaccine with two doses close together besides the COVID vaccines.
7125,The reasoning for putting them close was simply to finish the trials and get vaccination completed as quickly as possible.
7126,It makes sense.
7127,What you're seeing is an immune response.
7128,"If someone has already had COVID, they are more likely to have antibodies and the body will respond hard and fast when it encounters the vaccine."
7129,"Those who haven't had COVID get a slow, small immune response to the first shot since the body has no antibodies yet."
7130,"By the time the second shot comes around, you actually have an immune response due to the antibodies from the first shot."
7131,"I know it’s the opposite of what people say I should do, but that’s why we’re leaving in a years time or so."
7132,I just don’t have the patience to stick around and help fix the state anymore.
7133,"Rural MO will always win over urban areas, and places like KC don’t even have local control of their police department."
7134,There’s absolutely no accountability for anything in this state.
7135,Indians are expert in all these...
7136,I'll be fully vaccinated with AstraZeneca by the end of next month.
7137,Should I still be very very paranoid about the South African or other variants?
7138,How much more paranoid do I need to be?
7139,"I work in the trades and have interacted with hundreds, probably more than a thousand other tradespeople since last March and I have never heard one say they appreciate wearing a mask at work lmao."
7140,The distain for them is universal
7141,"Yeah, it's the opposite of almost every other state."
7142,"It's good for Democrats though, since the rural population spread allows them to frequently win a near majority of state house districts"
7143,Because there’s a lot of people on here who are fed up with the virus and think that entitles them to believe whatever they want... it’s a tough situation the world is in and not everyone can cope.
7144,"Most people I know felt worse the first or 2nd shot alone, not both so hopefully 2nd shot isn't too bad at all."
7145,"It probably wont be a set date, more like a set % of people fully vaccinated."
7146,We literally have thousands of people dying of covid per day.
7147,Every single thing that extends how long it takes us to get out of this is murdering people.
7148,"I don’t give a shit what process they had set up prior, it’s a bad one."
7149,and then what happens when more people get blood clots that you don't know how to treat when you have more than enough other vaccines available?
7150,"Damn some people here are going to need psychological help after this, only going to the grocery store after being vaccinated, lmao i worked all through the pandemic in nyc and took multiple roads trips around the country, you only live once and pausing life for a year for a 99.98% non risk is insane to me."
7151,You’re not understanding my point or did not read the full context of the convo.
7152,Well when they say it doesn't help stop the spread they're kind of implying that it DOESN'T help others.
7153,Demand still outstrips supplies in many areas.
7154,"Vaccinations have decreased a bit in the recent numbers, a direct reflection of the loss of the J&amp;J vaccines."
7155,Extremist websites?
7156,You don’t seem very stable.
7157,Ofcourse it's a good thing.
7158,"If rest of the world starts noticing us, our ministers would have to spend more time getting celebrities to tweet about why outsiders shouldn't interfere with our internal matter."
7159,They are already short of time due to constant gaslighting and holding rallies.
7160,"The goal should be eventually to drop mask mandates but it should be based on percentage population vaccinated, ability to get vaccinated, etc."
7161,and dropping it prematurely can be detrimental.
7162,How ever many shots the brand of vaccine requires.
7163,Maybe a booster if the CDC recommends.
7164,Duh
7165,I went for an awesome 2-week trip in Alaska a few years back and we wished we could spend more time there.
7166,"you are making a lot of bad assumptions if you think there's a slower vaccine uptake... JNJ was only doing 5% of the vaccinations as a whole... we have more vaccines in reserve over the next 2-4 weeks from moderna/pfizer than JNJ has done period... 

we have enough supply for anyone who wants a vaccine now and for the next month... pausing was not going to hurt anyone or prevent anyone from getting vaccinated..."
7167,Appreciate it.
7168,It's been 5 years now.
7169,"Most noticable these days when I have ""oh, I wonder what he would think"" moments."
7170,He was a USAF A&amp;P mechanic and I would have loved to hear his thoughts on the recent aviation debacles.
7171,"Ah yes, up to 50% more."
7172,Yep.
7173,Had fever and chills all night after my 2nd.
7174,Right as rain the day after and I know damn well it worked and my body knows to beat the hell out of Covid if it's ever in my body again.
7175,"Exactly, it varies like crazy."
7176,Didn't feel my first shot of Pfizer - arm pain for a day and a little tired.
7177,"Second shot - the shot definitely hurt a little more and I still have a bit of arm pain 4 days later, and a lot of fatigue."
7178,No fever or chills or headaches etc.
7179,"If you've been trying CVS, make sure to check around 3am, that's when a lot of appointments are available."
7180,Good luck to you and your friend.
7181,it would be kind of stupid to be making decisions based on how idiots will react...
7182,"I mentioned elsewhere, I sat down with a bartender friend of mine and while sipping my beer, I walked him through nthe link I had and we finally found Walgreens with a date / time that worked perfectly for him."
7183,He's around 23 or 24.
7184,"Zero ""hesitancy"" about getting a dose, but having all the links right in front of him make it quick and easy for him."
7185,Thankfully my elderly mom got hers via a county run pop-up in her 55+ community.
7186,And they just did a second round of 1+2 now that the age requirement went down.
7187,So the vast majority of her neighborhood is vaccinated now.
7188,My older brother is in the VA system and got his that way.
7189,"And 3 weeks ago I learned I'm in the Active group with J&amp;J. Lol, so I've been ""fully vaccinated"" since November."
7190,"People are going to be saying ""another few weeks/months"" for the next year."
7191,They need to give solid metrics for when rules change and then follow through with them.
7192,"For me it was as easy as getting a coffee in the morning, and I'm 16"
7193,((hugs))
7194,Have some dignity and stop making excuses for ethnic cleansing.
7195,"Yes, like every single event, it's complicated, and yes, it didn't happen yesterday."
7196,But it's still evil.
7197,I know.
7198,"But what he said was "" under-represented **in the world stage**""."
7199,I think he's right.
7200,"Related news can hardly be found on some major media in western countries, not in the front page level or even in the world news session."
7201,I volunteer at testing centres since last year so can't do this but yes this is the ideal scenario.
7202,"In my place, only I step out, always masked."
7203,We are being punished for others stupidity and callousness.
7204,"Oh man, me too!"
7205,Love that ballpark!
7206,Lol you live in a bubble.
7207,For me it’s the opposite.
7208,No one plans to get it.
7209,All about what your risk tolerance is.
7210,"I’m more risk adverse, have children who can’t be vaccinated, and staying home doesn’t really bother me so I tend to play it safer than other people would."
7211,That and they pulled numbers out of their ass.
7212,Not the point.
7213,They developed the vaccine and neither of them was part of Operation Warp Speed.
7214,Abundance of caution and it’s not 100% it’s closer to 95%.
7215,We’re also not 100% positive that vaccinated people with no symptoms can’t spread it to non vaccinated people.
7216,Take a look at the headline and then read the comment again.
7217,Pfizer did not develop the vaccine.
7218,They did testing and manufacturing.
7219,The vaccine is called BNT-162b2 (BioNTech).
7220,"The ones produced in Marburg are labeled with ""BioNTech"" instead of ""Pfizer-BioNTech"" like the ones produced by Pfizer."
7221,BioNTech could have partnered with every company which is able to produce vaccines on a big scale.
7222,There were many alternatives but BioNTech and Pfizer had already done projects in the past.
7223,(BioNTech also made contacts at the same time with a Chinese manufacturer).
7224,"Because a partnership would give BioNTech more bodies, more resources, more money, and more locations to produce vaccines, thus greatly increasing vaccine production rate and being able to distribute the vaccine to more people."
7225,BioNTech also partnered with the Chinese company Fosun so that their vaccine could be distributed in Hong Kong and Mainland China as well.
7226,"If BioNTech decided not to partner with anyone, they would struggle to produce a sufficient amount of the  ""Comirnaty"" vaccine, and people would have to wait longer to get their doses."
7227,And just about every company that has created a vaccine has partnered with another for these reasons.
7228,You are speaking for rich countries.
7229,"There is very little optimism for battling COVID in countries like Brazil, Ukraine, African countries, etc."
7230,They don’t have the same access to vaccines as the West/Israel does.
7231,And that’s going to be a huge problem soon.
7232,I donated hundreds of dollars to help pay for funeral costs of an American doctor who was probably at most just born when I started medical school.
7233,She wasn't even 30 and only comorbidity was mild asthma as far as I know.
7234,Exponentially
7235,As if we want to visit your leper colonies.
7236,"Ok, but have they tried samples that came from people with a cold or the flu?"
7237,What's the accuracy then?
7238,I saw tons of appointments available for tomorrow at Oakland coliseum.
7239,We booked an appointment for someone just a Couple hours ago for tomorrow.
7240,Pfizer vaccine.
7241,"I think you're right, for which I'm glad."
7242,My partner and I can safely go see her anti-vaxxer parents after her second shot.

7260,"I don't think that was advocacy, just a summary of transactional thinking."
7261,"If you aren't already predisposed to get a vaccine (out of a sense of duty to others, fear of illness, etc), and you don't see anything in it for you (because you weren't worried about COVID before and nothing about your life will change afterward), then you probably won't be motivated to get the shot."
7262,"Because he's incompetent and a liar, both of which he's already proven during the last year."
7263,This whole charade cannot keep going when people by and large are vaccinated.
7264,"You're sitting there telling me that Moderna prevents hospitalization and death, which is what people are concerned about and hence the mask wearing and USELESS surface cleaning, and then after that's done you go back on it?"
7265,"These people are lying morons, I have had over the past year even more sympathy for the Conservative/Republican viewpoint because the federal government during the past 3 months has almost no idea what it's doing."
7266,And people thought Fauci's incompetence was because of Trump but I guess after 3 months you have all the evidence you need.l

7272,Everyone funded vaccine development.

7274,"The border is open for Canadians to enter America, just not vice versa."
7275,Those who want it.
7276,Canada has just started vaccinating those 55 and up very recently.
7277,And it's just one dose.
7278,Canada effectively stopped giving out second doses.
7279,They're being spaced 4 months apart.
7280,Glad to be part of the half who have received at least one dose.
7281,Getting my second Pfizer dose on May 4th!
7282,💉
7283,How IS your tune by the way?
7284,This is the most pathetic and ignorant thing I've read on this sub.
7285,The whole point of YOU getting vaccinated is to protect YOURSELF.
7286,"If people take their masks off around you, and you're vaccinated, what exactly is the issue here?"
7287,"I think deep down you don't think the vaccine even works, hence being ""uncomfortable"" with other people who you don't even know their vaccinated or anti-body status."
7288,All your statement leads me to believe is that you're a victim of fear and doom being shoved in your face every hour of the day the last year.
7289,Caring for a child during all of this makes things exponentially harder.
7290,Might be talking about adults vs. total population.
7291,"Half of US adults is half of 78%, which is 39% of the total population, which is roughly in line with the previous comment."

7293,You’re not fooling anyone.

7308,Are you trying to get people not to get vaccinated so that everyone will have to wear masks and socially distances for longer???
7309,?
7310,"The EU has exported more vaccines than they have used themselves, including to the United States."
7311,Get off your fucking high horse.

7314,"Of course, but are you really comparing a country of 778K to a country of 332 million?"
7315,"For every person Bhutan needs to vaccinate, the US needs to vaccinated 426."
7316,"If I have 100 people to vaccinate and you have 42,600, you will reach a greater per-capita percentage much quicker with every dose."
7317,A fair comparison is between countries with similar population and wealth.
7318,Also in Israel but struggling to take mine off.
7319,Honestly I got used to the pandemic the thought of it being over feels surreal.
7320,I constantly feel like tmr I'll see the R number ride back to above 1 and we're going to start going into lockdown again.
7321,I have started seeing more people in person but things are still weird to me.
7322,"On one hand I really believe in the vaccine and I really hate the social distancing and lockdowns, on the other hand it doesn't feel like it's actually over for some reason, and I don't know when I will feel that if ever."
7323,COVID can also cause impotence.

7329,"But even as millions of them were getting vaccinated with the initial formulations from Pfizer and Moderna, the evolution in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continued its microscopic arms race with cutting-edge medical science."
7330,"The social exuberance of that Spring turned into a grim reckoning with the strain from India that didn’t care about our vaccines, that held on to the cells it invaded with a surprising molecular twist and set vaccine researchers scrambling."
7331,"My girlfriend parents, who are very fortunate, have gone full plague mode."
7332,They have bunkered down in their holiday house with one servant and nobody is allowed to leave the house.
7333,Shopping is done by delivery with no contact between delivery guy and the rest.
7334,The shopping bags are treated with vaporized disinfectants and in an UV light chamber before brought in by the servant who is not allowed other contact with the family.
7335,It's insane.
7336,Sooner or later there will be social pressure.
7337,"No vaccine equals

No travelling

No hotels

No flights

No dining out

No job interviews

I can't wait till all these morons find out what's what."
7338,Just got my second dose Friday.
7339,"Let me tell ya, Saturday SUUUUUUCKED."
7340,But now I'm fully vaccinated!
7341,😁
7342,"I wish I could find it again, but I remember reading that bathroom vents (in the US) are designed such that air never flows backwards (i.e."
7343,back inside the bathroom) even with the vent off.

7352,I cannot wait.
7353,"As soon as you ease guidelines for vaccinated people, unvaccinated people will also stop following those restrictions because there's no way enforce a double standard between two groups you can't tell apart."
7354,"So, while it will improve quality of life for vaccinated people, it will increase transmission among dishonest unvaccinated people and raise risk for honest unvaccinated people."
7355,You can't just apply common sense to situations involving agents with no common sense.
7356,"Low risk for getting seriously ill or dying, yes."
7357,But high risk for pressuring public officials to keep restrictions in place so long as case counts don't head steeply downward.

7376,"Once they’ve been available to everyone for a month or two, open everything with no mask mandates and let us move on with our lives."
7377,People who refuse are responsible for themselves.
7378,I worked in that state from June until January....3/4 of the people there have donkey brains and the rest can't wait to get out.
7379,This is good news.
7380,Keep it up.
7381,I want to go to Las Vegas lol
7382,"Amazing difference when you have a competent adult, with a fully functioning brain, who genuinely cares about things other than himself, in charge."
7383,Did no one else's parents send them off to their grandparents house in the middle of nowhere for the whole summer?
7384,Because until I could care for myself home alone that's where I went every summer.
7385,There was no going places.
7386,Just there.
7387,The obvious solution is to keep directing vaccine doses toward the counties that can successfully deliver them into arms.
7388,Forget about the hesitancy.
7389,Direct the vaccine toward the willing takers.
7390,I just want to know who the people are that have been inconvenienced so little by this global pandemic that a couple hours of their time to put an end to it all simply isn't worth the trouble.
7391,I don't think it's necessarily fair to pinpoint that to stupid behavior.
7392,"A lot of people who took COVID very seriously (masks, SD, etc) still ended up infected."
7393,I feel it should just be a choice what you want to do after people get vaccines.
7394,Idk im just a regular person with no expertise
7395,&gt; Can anyone explain how this can work?
7396,Cellular immunity is believed to be the backbone of protection against hospitalization and death.
7397,People infected with SARS in 2003 are believed to [still have good protective immunity against COVID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z).
7398,"Helper T cells recognize infected cells by the spike protein they are emitting, giving off hormones to ramp up the immune system and activating killer T cells to eat those cells."
7399,"Even if severe flu-like symptoms result, the cytokine storm or autoimmune problems that result in really severe outcomes should be avoided."
7400,Even partial efficacy at preventing contagiousness should greatly reduce rate of spread.
7401,"Also, we have mRNA printers now and can just print out a new vaccine if we need a booster for a particular strain."
7402,Gotcha.
7403,"Thanks, I’ll give that a try."
7404,My knee jerk reaction to seeing an article like that was to try to find others to talk to about it.
7405,Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
7406,How does that make mathematical sense?
7407,If the best states also aren’t over 50% then how could we be over 50% as a country?
7408,"I know the people who keep regurgitating this stuff aren't interested in science, just politics, but for the record while research is ongoing at the very least it is very likely SARS2 is a type 1 diabetes trigger, like vaccine preventable rotavirus."
7409,If we can just hurry the hell up and give the kids the vaccine so irresponsible selfish adults don't condemn them to this life long illness that would be GREAT.
7410,Hope you're feeling ok after that second dose :) congrats!
7411,!+
7412,Are you comparing the legalization of the invasion of privacy into citizens by the Federal government to a local mask mandate during a pandemic?
7413,"Sore arm &amp; fatigue 5 days after the 1st, had 2nd on Friday &amp; super sore arm, 100.5 temp, aches &amp; etc."
7414,Slept it off until this afternoon- now I feel fabulous.
7415,"Im not saying it is right, just what they thought and  probably others."
7416,If JJ wasnt available (when they got it) they would have kept waiting or not gotten one at all.
7417,I have some opinions I'd like to share on that waste problem.
7418,"And who's to blame for it, but it would land me another several day suspension from this subreddit."
7419,Yes.
7420,"The one in the clinical trial was severe enough that they paused the trial, which made headlines at the time, and they did not disclose the reason for the pause at that time."
7421,They decided in the end that it was unrelated but now it looks connected.
7422,I think it would be useful to use the dogs in addition to the other methods too though.
7423,It's like every practice with Covid.
7424,No ONE precautions is 100% safe.
7425,But the more layers you add the less chance of something getting through.
7426,There were flaws in the PCR and other test methods to fly to certain areas.
7427,Unlikely but possible.
7428,"How about people taking a PCR test to fly 3-4 days prior, but then not maybe not following guidelines and hangs out with others indoors, etc?"
7429,I think they're handling it right.
7430,"I don't think anyone really suspected vaccinated people could be contributing to the spread, but they were worried about the implications of creating a sort of tiered society where those given preferential access were granted certain rights and privileges those who were not offered the vaccine were not entitled to."
7431,"Once everyone has been offered the vaccine, I think you will see restrictions start rolling back."
7432,I love the diversity here.
7433,I guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like society as a whole will delay reopening because so many people have a skewed assessment of risk after the past year
7434,Still miles ahead of Japan.
7435,Olympics are in 100 days and they are less than 1% fully vaccinated.
7436,Their rollout has been a disaster.
7437,Our elementary school has been the same way.
7438,My oldest had to quarantine for 10 days early on because of a student who got it from outside of school.
7439,My youngest hasn't missed a day other than a scheduled doctors appointment.
7440,I think maybe 10 classrooms have been impacted this year and we've had 0 in school transmission.
7441,The upper half of the middle school and the high school however: bit of a mess.
7442,They REALLY didn't need sports going on.
7443,"It's been the source of most transmissions, either kid to kid or the idiot parents tailgating before the games."
7444,They finally had to have a cop in the parking lot to chase off that kind of behavior.
7445,"For the US at least, there has been a VAST improvement in leadership between the horrendous virus response and amazing vaccine distribution"
7446,Supply isn’t the issue.
7447,People willing to get the vaccine is the problem.
7448,50% of the eligible people have received at the least the 1st dose.
7449,"California opened it to everyone on last week and you use vaccine Hunter, you’ll see tons of empty slots."
7450,I heard community vaccination sites aren’t even running at capacity.
7451,I picked up vaccine from a rural community super site last month because they couldn’t drive the out population to get vaccinated.
7452, Someone should set up Obama's camera better.
7453,It looks like he's not looking in the eye of the viewer.
7454,Makes sense!
7455,The research I did pointed to the J&amp;J Ebola vaccine being the first approved adenovirus viral vector vaccine.
7456,And that was in July of 2020.
7457,I agree the research has been going on for decades.
7458,mRNA has also been in research for quite some time these new vaccines are just the first to actually be used.
7459,In either case they're both new relative to the old school way of using inactivated or viral fragments is my point.
7460,"https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/pfizer-beats-back-accusations-pandemic-vaccine-production-hurdles

You mean when Trump delayed doses intentionally?"
7461,[removed]
7462,"They can apply after 6 months and Moderna and Pfizer have both hinted that they plan to ""soon""."
7463,April was the soonest Pfizer could apply - I would expect to see it any day.
7464,"Whether or not you like it, it's true."
7465,The issue is lack of accessibility.
7466,"&gt;Europeans especially should be ashamed of themselves

More than 100 milion vaccinations done amd 110 milions exported."
7467,"Meanwhile,the Us has exported less than a milion."
7468,"Also, Israel and UK and other countries are doing much better than the US"
7469,Lmao I don't have a Facebook.
7470,The scientists like dr.Fauci?
7471,He's lied to us once before....
7472,"As everyone else has mentioned, risk is probably very low, even without you having the vaccine."
7473,Don’t feel bad for being nervous!
7474,It’s a difficult habit to get out of.
7475,I still catch myself worrying about it sometimes too.
7476,its Biontech not Pfizer lmao
7477,Well there are people who are concerned that the US won't get 75 percent uptake needed for herd immunity with the virus so maybe Canada will do ok in the long run
7478,Sore arm for day 1.
7479,Getting number 2 in 2 weeks
7480,[removed]
7481,I hope they succeed.
7482,The world needs more mRNA vaccines.
7483,That’s my takeaway as well
7484,You don’t need to be an numbers expert to smell the bullshit
7485,[deleted]
7486,This is something that people seem to forget.
7487,The only way to get it from someone is if they actually have it and have no symptoms and so are unaware and are in public... which by itself is very rare.
7488,It isn't as if every single human besides you is a carrier.
7489,Statistically getting covid from a single inhale from a single person in a single place is about the same as getting hit by lightning.
7490,Then believe the scientists instead?
7491,Or is your only credible source your friends and family on facebook who have no clue what they're talking about?
7492,"&gt; All adults in every U.S. state, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico are now eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine

Sorry, Guam."
7493,Politics.
7494,Makes it sound like the government is actually doing something.
7495,Actually Trump delayed a bunch of vaccines in December for partisan fuckery.
7496,https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/pfizer-beats-back-accusations-pandemic-vaccine-production-hurdles
7497,After how badly the US handled the pandemic last year it's kind of refreshing to see us hitting it out of the park with the vaccine roll out.
7498,How much Capacity can Restaurants do?
7499,50?
7500,75 percent?
7501,this is dumb.
7502,"&gt;The author of the study, Dr. Emmanuele A. Jannini, issued a strong warning: ""**mask up to keep it up."
7503,"**""  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's a two-way association: **if you have erectile dysfunction, you are more likely to have COVID-19, and conversely (...) people who have had COVID-19 seem to have a greater chance of developing erectile dysfunction**,"" summarized Dr. Luc Valiquette, a urologist at the CHUM and a professor in the department of surgery at the Université de Montréal."
7504,"&gt;  
&gt;The risk was increased five- or six-fold in both cases."
7505,"That's all the advertising you need for the vaccination campaign, just saying."
7506,I hope teens 12-16 are next.
7507,And the depressing part - NYC has the inverse problem of like too many open slots too little takers.
7508,"Granted weekends are hard to get but the weekdays, plenty of slots even in april."
7509,"To register in the system, not to get an appointment though."
7510,Don’t forget that it’s free!
7511,"FREE IS GOOD

I like free"
7512,"The AZ numbers are starkly different though; in Scandinavia the clot rate is something like 1/100,000."
7513,Nobody has an explanation of why it would be higher there or why J&amp;J would be lower than AZ.
7514,For a 64 year age span over the course of 16 months?
7515,That’s 100k ppl or so.
7516,More for sure have died from other reasons during that time.
7517,San Francisco just said they had twice as many drug overdose deaths as covid last year.
7518,"Also the fact they aren't even thinking about treatments for covid, ONLY vaccines."
7519,What about treatments?
7520,"Just get the vaccine or ""risk death""?"
7521,Whats up with that.
7522,And the fact they still don't know a lot about the vaccine themselves.
7523,"Even the facts sheets are filled with ""we aren't sure's"" and ""unknowns""."
7524,Waiting for J&amp;J to be available again.
7525,"If it's not within a month or so, then I'll get the 2 dose."
7526,I'm not aware of contraindications even for people who *are* diagnosed with autoimmune disorders.
7527,"But yes, talk to your rheumatologist."
7528,That'd be great.
7529,Did Pfizer submit an application for any age group under 16 as well?
7530,Good luck with the long covid and possible underlying heart damage
7531,"The authors specifically say that the rates they found should not be compared, because of the small sample size of events and because they didn't control for demographics."
7532,Like vaccinated people who still wear masks outside.
7533,I was able to walk in with no appointment this weekend for my first dose of moderna.
7534,23 - Connecticut.
7535,"Made it super easy, another walk in event scheduled for exactly 28 days later."
7536,1.
7537,"Again, long term effects are usually seen by at risk and older people."
7538,"Yes young people can get them, but its not as common."
7539,Saying i should get vsccinated without giving a fuck about long term risks of the actual vaccination seems like the dumb argument to me.
7540,"2.	agreed, most extreme short term side effects are nothing or a sore arm, im not too worried about these, even nauseau tbh."
7541,3.
7542,"Agreed that one of the benifts of the vaccine is to protecting others, but who decided that my first priority shouldn’t be to do whats best for myself and my family?"
7543,Characterizing as making your family your priority as selfish is not correct.
7544,Who the fuck are you to tell me what i should do with my body?
7545,Yea my biggest thing is the embarrassment of it.
7546,I recognize the signs now and I can sometimes keep it at bay.
7547,But sitting in from of a bunch of people while I'm sweating and pale skinned trying to not pass out is really uncomfortable.
7548,Meh.
7549,The risks associated with the AZ vaccine are overblown.
7550,Most people take much bigger risks just by living their everyday lives; even without taking the pandemic into account.
7551,"If paranoid boomers don't want it, I'll be more than happy to take one off their hands."
7552,"If you are willing to drive east or north a bit of Sac, there will almost certainly be available appointments daily in the neighboring (more anti-vacc) counties."
7553,"The lower the average IQ, the more appts are available."
7554,"Dude you’re almost as likely to get hit by a bus than get killed by corna at 15, live your life"
7555,I got my J&amp;J last week.
7556,"It was one of the most painless shots I've ever gotten, my arm was hardly sore at all after getting it."
7557,"However, the next day, I got a 101 degree fever and severe body aches that lasted for two days."
7558,Still better than getting actual covid though!
7559,I'm 36 and ran to get the vaccine the first opportunity that came up.
7560,"Having known people who have both been infected and died from COVID, I couldn't wait to get the vaccine."
7561,NC retail pharmacist here: if you are on the list you get the shot.
7562,"Don't need to he a citizen, wouldnt give a shit either way, just don't make a fuss."
7563,Now all adults need to be adults and get vaccinated.
7564,well i havent had my second dose yet but i did have arm pain after my first dose and i felt a bit nauseous the next day.
7565,everyone reacts differently to the vaccine.
7566,&gt;My entire family is fully vaccinated and not a single one of us has any issues at all.
7567,"Maybe we are unique, but I doubt it."
7568,if anything sounds like a lie its this.
7569,no one had ANY effects of the virus?
7570,not even soreness?
7571,literally everyone i know who has taken a covid vaccine has atleast mentioned soreness in the arm if nothing else.
7572,anyway its ok to listen to anecdotes as long as youre aware that theyre anecdotes.
7573,I know WHY they do it.
7574,I want to know HOW the numbers are misrepresenting reality.
7575,"No, just outside for now."
7576,Groups of 6 max.
7577,"There is no vaccine going to waste, it's just not being used as fast as it should be."
7578,"With the change in age to 40 in Ontario and Alberta, even this should be fixed very shortly."
7579,Woo!
7580,Look at the doublespeak!
7581,Amazing.
7582,Ah!Let me counter you?
7583,Why live if you do not know when you are going to die?
7584,Fauci offers the possibility of life without suffering the sickness of this virus!
7585,"Why not accept it, if you want life?"
7586,"As a Canadian, for the first time since I've been alive, I am envious of Americans."
7587,Fauci?
7588,Wearing Plague Doctor costumes.
7589,"heh, ""plague walkers""."
7590,That's a good one.
7591,There should be public checkpoints where you have to be examined by one of these dogs before going into any indoor/crowded spaces.
7592,"I'd argue that getting signed up for your vaccine during a once-in-hundred-years pandemic IS a ""drop everything and do this right now"" situation, but I understand your point"
7593,Yeah it's just unreal that there isn't an easy way to get the vaccine right now.
7594,Walgreens/CVS/Rite aid only let you book a week away.
7595,"I got mine all the way in BFE Pennsylvania, and I drove 45 min to get it."
7596,Like seriously I'd rather just be able to get on CVS website and schedule it like a month out instead of checking it every day for availability
7597,"Your comment made me look at the calendar out of curiosity and realized 2 weeks after my second dose is my birthday, how fun!"
7598,Getting my first dose on Friday :)
7599,"I have a healthy, functioning immune system."
7600,It’s experimental and still in trial.
7601,Unknown long-term effects.
7602,No liability protection.
7603,And more!
7604,I’ll pass.
7605,No thanks!
7606,"According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, out of the 77 million vaccinations in the U.S., there have only been 5,800 infections."
7607,"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/health/breakthrough-infections-covid-vaccines-cdc/index.html

Obviously, this will vary based on the dominant variant in any given country."
7608,Will also vary based on vaccines being used.
7609,In the US it's mostly Pfizer and Moderna.
7610,We still don't have data on indian variant which supposedly has two immune escape mutations.
7611,And India uses Astrazeneca/inactivated virus vaccine which already don't have high efficacy against mutations.
7612,I had pretty serious mental fogginess for 2 days where I never could've taken an exam.
7613,No way.
7614,Most of those people don’t even acknowledge there’s a race.
7615,They call it a “hoax”
7616,"Yeah, I don't hold anything against her."
7617,"I don't really have an opinion on pregnant women getting the vaccine one way or the other, I just wanted to mention that there are probably reasons that aren't super antivax"
7618,"That’s what I thought, just wanted to ease my anxiety."
7619,Thank you!
7620,"Fauci doesn't make it easy when he says things like ""this has nothing to do with liberty"" on a regular basis."
7621,Saying shit like this enrages conservatives.
7622,"I'm an extremely pro-vaccine libertarian, and Fauci makes me furious."
7623,"You can think Fauci's comment about liberty is fine, you can even agree with it."
7624,You also have to admit that comments like that are intensely controversial.
7625,"It's almost like he wants to turn off conservatives, like he wants to convince them that following public health advice is giving in to the nanny state."
7626,"Frankly, Fauci needs to go."
7627,He is terrible at communicating health advice to the public.
7628,You want to convince conservatives to get vaccinated?
7629,Get Rand Paul on the air and have him say that once you get vaccinated you no longer have to wear a mask.
7630,The EU is the #1 exporter with more than 110 Milion vaccines exported
7631,I don't believe these political yahoos when they tell me the vaccine's safe.
7632,The hospitals in larger cities *have* been near capacity since the surge peaked.
7633,"Also, imo, lockdowns and preventative measures &gt; risk of variants developing + fewer people with long term side effects."
7634,Yes.
7635,Let’s go!
7636,[removed]
7637,Fair point!
7638,But I just can’t see any other reason why C19 significantly flattened out in Europe UK and Canada in the summer only to come back with a vengeance in the fall
7639,"I charitably assume that they mean the alert should be for ""drop everything and do this right now"" situations, of which the vaccine rollout isn't exactly an example."
7640,"The more it's not used for emergencies, the more people might tune all alerts (including the emergent ones) out"
7641,Got mine last Friday.
7642,Was sick af on Saturday and a bit less so yesterday.
7643,"Take it easy after the shot, hydrate, and stock up on some gatorade, etc."
7644,good luck!
7645,I'm interested in the longer term effects 5yr+ effects.
7646,If I don't get it now I can always get it later when we have more long term effects that are known
7647,"The best metric to use would be the rate of new infections, but that's very hard to pin down."
7648,Test positivity rates and death rates are probably the best proxies we have.
7649,"Personally, I think as long as COVID-19 is still a top 10 leading cause of death, we're not out of the woods yet."
7650,[deleted]
7651,Lol good luck
7652,"When you consider the probability that 1) that person had covid and was contagious and 2) you caught it from them despite having the pretty great protection of one dose of moderna, the risk seems basically negligible."
7653,"I know it's easier said than done, but don't stress yourself out."
7654,You're good.
7655,Yes.
7656,I'd say most people have been supportive of the restrictions.
7657,The UK variant caught us by surprise and spread fast.
7658,Most people recognise we had little choice but to lockdown till it was under control.
7659,Recently the debate has started as to whether or not we're opening up fast enough.
7660,Given the low covid numbers and good vaccine progress some feel we could have opened up faster (it's a staged approach over 3 months ish)
7661,I think Swindon would have been the first choice.
7662,It's a lot different to know that feeling like crap isn't actual illness and has a defined end point than to be actually sick.
7663,"&gt;I know, the US has some of the best quality healthcare in the world

Said nobody ever"
7664,I thought it was 2 weeks after the 2nd dose not 3...
7665,Meanwhile in Canada...
7666,That's how it was for me.
7667,A drive-through mass vaccination site where it took me about two hours from when I got there to when I left.
7668,"Once my state opened the general eligibility, every pharmacy and hospital in driving distance was booked for weeks."
7669,"While it took me 2 hours to get my vaccine, they were probably vaccinating two or three people every second at that mass vaccination spot, for most of the day."
7670,"The total throughput must be staggering, compared to individual pharmacies."
7671,"They are basically opening up the private market for 18+, while retaining the government subsidized free vaccines for 45+."
7672,"You're right about the vastly greater danger posed by covid, and the need to protect others."
7673,But you might want to take your tone down a notch.
7674,"I know there are a lot of people on here who argue in bad faith, but I don't think this person is one of them."
7675,"It’s too bad when this is all over, many won’t even be able to experience relief, joy, or gratitude thanks to politics"
7676,"I mean, eh?"
7677,It made it way harder for me as a high risk person to access vaccines in a timely manner because they just completely skipped the period for high risk people in my state.
7678,Shut up you discriminatory turd.
7679,[deleted]
7680,"&gt;unvaccinated people will also stop following those restrictions because there's no way enforce a double standard between two groups you can't tell apart

I can tell you as someone who lives in the midwest, this group of people haven't taken covid procedures seriously since before christmas."
7681,"I suspect a lot of them got it over the holidays and are like ""welp I already have antibodies so...""."
7682,"With current projections all EU adults will be fully vaccinated sometime in Q3, although there is some uncertainty (primarily to what extent AstraZeneca and J&amp;J will be used)."
7683,"Of course, that's a given."
7684,"But with the system of government that we have, it's nearly impossible to do this."
7685,It's just a fact.
7686,This post appears to be about vaccines.

7691,Anyway there is speculation that it's part of the reason she's given in to political pressure to keep the state open.
7692,It's definitely concerning.
7693,I'm getting increasingly pissed off with the way the press here in the UK is covering variants.

7700,Good thing I moved 10 mins from Red Rocks.
7701,Now all the tours come to me.
7702,This post appears to be about vaccines.

7706,"With the current rate of vaccination, I think we can be more optimistic than that."
7707,"I expect US and UK to be able to return to some form of normality by end of Q2, while the EU can do it maybe by end of Q3."
7708,We don't need to have *everybody* vaccinated for normality.
7709,"When the vast majority of the risk groups are vaccinated, the virus will be much less serious."
7710,Not only are the vaccines effective against the variants but coronavirus itself has limited potential to mutate compared to many others such as the flu virus.

7717,Just like they ended the patriot act?
7718,"Yes, only Australia and New Zealand have mature adult populations and leaders, nobody else."
7719,They are unique and no one is even close to them.
7720,Congrats buddy!!
7721,!
7722,The issue is that fully vaccinated people do not spread the virus.
7723,Yet they are still being told to mask.
7724,People really rather get people sick and kill them rayher than just wearing a god damn mask....
7725,Covid isn't killing people with asymptomatic cases 45 days later.
7726,Having an adverse reaction from having the vaccine too soon after recovering is more plausible.
7727,1.
7728,This is a study of patients who were hospitalized with a mean age of 60 years.
7729,These are the most severe cases of COVID and skew old and sick—not 20 year-old athletes.
7730,2.
7731,This is just an announcement of research to be conducted.
7732,3.
7733,Many of the symptoms in this study are self-reported.
7734,4.
7735,"This has to do with people who received lung transplants, a very small minority of COVID patients."
7736,This also typically impacts those who have more severe COVID—not young and healthy.
7737,5.
7738,This just shows that some asymptomatic people’s organs do have damage from COVID after infection.
7739,It does not indicate how long this takes to heal after infection.
7740,"&gt;since people don’t really see how getting vaccinated will change anything for the better

I really don’t understand how anyone can still think this."
7741,"Even if someone only cares about what’s in it for them, getting vaccinated will drastically reduce their chances of getting Covid and almost eliminate their chance of being hospitalized."
7742,"Even if they don’t care about getting Covid, public health does."
7743,"The more people are vaccinated, less people will get sick and even less will require hospitalizations."
7744,"Oregon may not have put exact numbers on it, but getting vaccinated will obviously help with all the metrics they’ve said they care about in order to lift restrictions."
7745,"When I was in Korea mask usage outside was close to 100%, but people were kinda used to wearing masks even from before since the air quality is not so great at times during the year."
7746,(Which btw is something I think parts of the us could learn from... Like when I lived in SF and it looked like bladerunner outside for a couple days because of wildfires nearby...)
7747,Sorry but I still believe I’m only getting my first dose at the end of this year in Germany.
7748,It’s a complete mess to get the appointments.
7749,People that are receiving a f*cking letter this month with an invitation to get vaccinated could only book appointments for June.
7750,Meanwhile 60s old are refusing AZ vaccine.
7751,The bureaucracy is killing people and Europe is only “lucky” because we got the South African and British variants.
7752,If it was the P1 in Brazil we would have corpses laying around and people dying at home.
7753,Also the half-assed lockdown that is only slowing removing freedom helps with nothing.
7754,Summer here will be like New Years eve in Mexico and Brazil without vaccines.
7755,That would be nice.
7756,"I'm not letting my fully vaccinated mom come within 10 feet of my unvaccinated kids though, because she made it a priority to go back to church where removing your mask upon entry is encouraged and welcomed."
7757,Twice a week.
7758,90% efficacy isn't 100% efficacy and she doesn't understand that.
7759,"It was issued as emergency use authorization, it was never FDA approved."
7760,"Also, Moderna has tried to issue 10 vaccines and they’ve never been FDA approved."
7761,So I wouldn’t plan to take that one.
7762,Not a single lie in my comment
7763,There's a guy farther up in the comments claiming it was a delayed covid death.
7764,What a load of trash.
7765,I think we need to be careful with vaccinating recently infected people.
7766,The UK proves that vaccines are not delusions.
7767,They are the only solution to this problem.
7768,The reschedule for 2020 is the weekend after my wedding xD.
7769,"If you see anyone with just married shirts, it's probably me haha"
7770,So then the timer is set?
7771,6 weeks from Friday.
7772,In an egalitarian country like Sweden single women should be able to give donations also.
7773,The testing regimen for this vaccine was just as rigorous for this one as any other.
7774,"In fact, study was done on 40,000 subjects as opposed to the required 10,000 subjects, so to state that the vaccine has “NEVER” been tested is inaccurate and spreading a lie."
7775,"And it was approved by the FDA, so you’re lying on that one as well."
7776,"If case counts were going to fall in Texas but are instead flat, the effects of this game would be invisible."
7777,You can't impregnate a sock though...
7778,I have 2 open spots in my pod for Friday if anyone is looking.
7779,"\mm/

I love some summer camp."
7780,Been awhile.
7781,"You're right, I had the same problem with this study."
7782,They only used healthy samples and covid samples.
7783,There is a very good chance that dogs smelled being sick in general which we already knew they could do.
7784,"If we are not going to make a distinction between cold and covid then that's fine, you can also use them as finding people to test further but there is nothing to suggest they can differentiate between covid and flu."
7785,Well what about those employers that require everyone to be vaccinated?
7786,"Even if we don't have widespread 'vaccine IDs', employers can still have their HR require proof of vaccination."
7787,So they can't lie about it - in which case there's no reason they should have to mask.
7788,Aside from the slight awkwardness of the public having to mask but not them.
7789,Sure.
7790,"Also, I would go ahead and just cycle two masks."
7791,"Another way also is to hang them on the wall, some sun light deactivates the virus too."

7802,"because i meant ""in terms of the end result of their weight"" like i said on my last post."
7803,my first post also included a link that discussed the impact of burning additional calories to clarify what i meant.
7804,"&gt; Okay and if we did a real lockdown and banned everyone from entering (including our own citizens) and did hotel quarantining for everyone coming into the country and required mandatory negative tests, and actually enforced mask wearing like them, we could have been able to prevent the spread."
7805,"So I'm saying this from a UK point of view, but the two countries had similar issues."
7806,"By early March, when COVID was really getting in the news, from what we now know about the IFR and incubation period, the UK likely had tens to hundreds of thousands of cases."
7807,"It was, by any metric, much too late for international travel restrictions to make much of a difference."
7808,The US was in a similar situation.
7809,There wasn't sufficient testing capacity at the start of the pandemic.
7810,Even symptomatic people weren't able to get tested unless their case was severe.
7811,"There was also a massive shortage of PPE, so governments made the call not to enforce mask wearing by the public so that they could first try to supply healthcare workers."
7812,Just got my second moderna shot.
7813,Lucked out with both ..only had a sore arm for both shots.
7814,I'm ready to have a higher peace of mind for the summer.
7815,Can't wait to see the plummeting of the cases.
7816,"I think they’re saying the school was open full-time since August, and only now - 8 months later - has there been a large spread of infection in the class."
7817,Sounds different to me.
7818,"&gt; If you want people to get vaccinated, you can't act like it means masks and distancing forever."
7819,So much this.
7820,These infectious disease experts respond to questions in a very literal manner.
7821,"When asked directly if vaccinated people can spread the disease they answer honestly with ""we are unsure, it is possible, therefore vaccinated people should take precautions, mask, distance"" or something like that."
7822,"When in reality they should say ""the likelihood of transmitting disease after vaccination is incredibly low and you are good to go""  


They are very careful to not completely say for certain if there is uncertainty, but if we are waiting for certainty we will be waiting forever."
7823,"This week was one of the first times I've seen republicans and democrats in my state agree, however, the subject matter was terrifying."
7824,"They were agreeing that the CDC is wrong, and we dont need to implement any measures against this."
7825,They agreed against public health.
7826,&gt;  now it looks like the vast majority of the EU will have had their first shot by end of June.
7827,"It really is the tortoise and the hare, the UK aren't expecting to mop up their 18-30s with a dose until mid to late July, despite our early lead."
7828,Not that it's a race mind but the EU ramp up over the next few months is scheduled to be impressive.
7829,It may be responsible for the increased morbidity seen in some cases in Brazil.
7830,"And ADE is only seen in reinfections, by definition."
7831,Umpreeeeeys let's goooo!
7832,"Without covid, they'd be playing summer camp that weekend."
7833,"That being said, I have my vaccine and so does my wife."
7834,"We have someone in our pod who wasnt able to get one yet, and I'm not sure if he still wants to come."
7835,Taking as much as you can regardless of how it affects other people is the foundational idea behind capitalism.
7836,"If you'll be working as a teacher in Germany you're actually somewhat prioritized, so there's 100% chance you can get one in July/August."
7837,"But even if not, your chances are pretty good."
7838,"I’ve already had my first shot last week, at a completely different location than I work."
7839,"Trust me, I was talking to the pharmacy all the time about Covid this past year, I am not personally slacking or ignorant or slowing things down like you’re implying."
7840,"And btw, our pharmacy only offered Johnston and Johnson so now they aren’t doing anything."
7841,That doesn’t change the fact people are still waiting for their appointments.
7842,"I have a friend who was just as enthusiastic as I was but demand in my state is high, she couldn’t get a shot scheduled until about two weeks after mine so she still hasn’t gotten it."
7843,"Just because I have my shot doesn’t mean I stop caring about my team members who haven’t secured theirs yet, and I want customers to treat them right."
7844,This is the problem I’ve been noticing in these discussions.
7845,Somebody will point out that mask and safety practices still protect a group that hasn’t had a fair chance yet.
7846,Then somebody else will come along and offer their advice and reply to the poster that they should be good to go.
7847,"That’s great...except we’re talking about groups and not individuals, and if you’re like me, you’re not even a part of the group you’re pointing out."
7848,They are mostly 40 and 50 year olds.
7849,Not really 17 year olds.
7850,I'd rather they err in that direction instead of the other one.
7851,A first dose confers little to no immunity until roughly 2 weeks after you receive it.
7852,Just 1/3 of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated.
7853,The full vaccination process takes 4-6 weeks.
7854,Wearing masks is still the decent thing to do.
7855,Same thing happened here in the US.
7856,"Early on, Biden was making modest promises, like having most Americans vaccinated by the end of the summer."
7857,"People were outraged; ""Surely we can do better than that!"""
7858,Turns out we could do better than that.
7859,And we did.
7860,He just didn't want to make promises that he couldn't follow through on.
7861,"Rip the band-aid off, the most vulnerable are already vaxxinated and the messaging and miss information surrounding ""vaxxines don't work if I have to wear a mask"" is dangerous and could prolong the pandemic."
7862,"If the messaging was ""get a vaccine you don't have to wear a mask"" you would win over all the fence sitters."
7863,Anti-maskers will never be converted so stop trying.
7864,Shit article.
7865,Normorial Day
7866,Last month we were finally able to have a memorial service for my grandfather who died of covid last march.
7867,We requested only vaccinated people attend and we all met at the cemetery first.
7868,Maybe 20 people all together.
7869,It was the first time we had seen each other in over a year.
7870,We all stood there for a few minutes like....is it ok to hug?
7871,How do we do this?
7872,Also for everyone there except my parents it was the first time they met my daughter who is 18 months old.
7873,Always just makes me think if “double secret probation”.
7874,Hope you're right.
7875,I'm planning on moving in late July early August to Germany and I'm not vaccinated.
7876,Hope I can get in!
7877,"&gt; vaccinated doesn’t mean you have immunity at all

Lmao what the fuck get the fuck out of here with this misinformation."
7878,"Vaccines give you 80% immunity after the first dose, which is better than you get for most vaccines for other diseases."
7879,Can they give me a visa then?
7880,:(
7881,"yeah I used to buy that, but then why are 2nd shot effects LESS for those who had covid?"
7882,they should be equal or stronger.
7883,Water and humidity are also excellent breeding grounds for bacteria.
7884,The last thing you want is for your mask to make you sick with something other than Covid!
7885,"We could have taken the approach South Korea did which was allow citizens and long term residents to quarantine at home, but actually enforce it."

7892,I doubt that many of these folks’ desire to keep locking down actually has anything to do with a virus.
7893,"Unfortunately it's already too late for that, or at least it is too late as of this Tuesday (once this week's allocations are announced)."
7894,It takes at least 2-3 weeks for allocations to actually turn into shots in arms.
7895,It is unlikely any state is going to be meaningfully supply constrained in 3 weeks (especially if the JnJ pause is lifted on Friday).
7896,All the current supply constrained states are chugging along at ~4-5% of eligible population incremental first doses per week.
7897,Three more weeks of that and about 65-70% of the eligible population is vaccinated in the supply constrained states.
7898,The challenge of maintaining pace of vaccination when you get to 65-70% vaccinated increases.
7899,You're asking 15%+ of the remaining unvaccinated population to show up and get vaccinated when this is the very population that has applied the least effort to get vaccinated.
7900,"It would have meaningfully helped if the re-allocations started 3-4 weeks ago when it became clear that some states were not able to consume all supply, but at this point it is water under the bridge."
7901,In states - they have power to allocate however they see fit.
7902,There is definitely an opportunity to get better intra-state allocation.
7903,"That said, there is a strain of thinking around rural populations are both most vaccine hesitant and most COVID-vulnerable (less self-protective behavior, poorer health, and more limited healthcare options) and, therefore, over-saturating those areas may be the better public health policy in terms of aggregate harm reduction if it makes it easier for this vaccine hesitant population to get vaccinated."
7904,Some of it is just political nonsense though.
7905,"This is disgusting, I hope the judge throws the whole damn book at them."
7906,How do people like them do shit like this?
7907,Do they have no morals or a damned conscience?
7908,There is nothing normal about a lethal pathogen tearing through a population.

7916,My family is all in rural Ohio and the younger ones are reluctant to get it despite being Democrats
7917,"Thats a novel idea, NYC should do the same thing."
7918,Vaccine tourism the new catchphrase of 2021 lol.
7919,That risk seems to be mutually exclusive to the one affecting women between 20-40 (blood clots).
7920,"You don't get to save people by giving others, who are not at risk of death, health complications."
7921,You are free to give up your own health but not anyone else's.
7922,"... along with the people who were “social distancing” for years before March 2020, and don’t want their dreams of locking everyone down forever to end."
7923,Which is why you exclusively look at the 7 day rolling average.
7924,"Numbers have been on a slight downtrend for nearly a week, and we’re lower than we were on April 9th."
7925,That’s nearly 2 weeks without an increase in daily cases.
7926,It absolutely qualifies as a plateau.
7927,40%?

Weird, here in Peru we haven’t even reached 1 million out of the 32M~"
7929,"South Korea has 500 daily cases for population 55 million and they are still at ""level 3"" social distancing."
7930,And keep in mind UK is currently planning to fully reopen (including nightclubs etc) by June which is more aggressive than I think a lot of other countries with fewer cases.
7931,Rep. Jordan is a dimwit but I share his concerns of these restriction.
7932,"Why doesn't the CDC come out and say, ""When cases get to X &amp; X% of people are vaccinated in your state, we recommend lifting the mask mandate."""
7933,This gives people hope &amp; help people stay objective during these times.

7936,"Ask a qualified medical practitioner, not Reddit!"
7937,Great point.
7938,"And add in some states just opened up to everyone on April 19th like New Jersey, Massachusetts, the city of Chicago."
7939,The coming few months the data should iron out.
7940,"&gt;Where is this 1 in 50,000 from?"
7941,The idea that it was the person in the trial who had it?
7942,In the danish-norwegian study with astrazeneca they found 1 in 40.000 developed the unusual vitt syndrome.
7943,I feel vaccines were always the endgame and were the true herd immunity besides that fake herd immunity some countries tried to approach without a vaccine.
7944,"As long as you and others take the shot (and probably more often than people who are lax on taking flu shots) continually, the odds of spread go down and the odds of you catching it go down."
7945,I feel more confident with a vaccine than a mask even though a mask has made me feel comfortable in times when people are more susceptible to sneezing in closed spaces (mainly from a simple cold or allergy rather than a deadly virus).
7946,"Like those people pre-2020 March that just let one rip, wiped the mucus off their face, and then went about their business."
7947,It’s going to be hard but I’m sure we’ll slowly adjust back to people’s noses and mouths as long as a vaccine is hiding behind them.
7948,I feel way more confident gambling with odds in my favor with a vaccine than having no vaccine and a piece of cloth that may or may not work.
7949,"If we did it flu vaccines with even lower odds, we can do it with this."
7950,"True, this is something you do NOT want to get, but vaccines will help our bodies defend against it, and with more people vaccinated than still relying on masks the defense is better."
7951,"True, a mask and a vaccine is justified overkill but all good things come to an end eventually (mask use, that is)."
7952,"If anything, it's good that the EU will catch up because some EU countries have already announced they will open up to UK tourists as early as May, and the last thing we need is another spike spread by returning tourists."
7953,Vaccinated doesn’t mean you have any immunity *at all.
7954,"*

Immunity doesn’t become apparent in trials until 12 days after the first dose."
7955,We have the opportunity to give these people another three weeks for their second dose and maximum safety.
7956,Have some empathy for god’s sake.
7957,Injection site soreness and “Covid arm” are different.
7958,The injection site soreness is the immediate immune response that causes soreness within the first couple days.
7959,“Covid arm” occurs about 8 days after the injection and is thought to be an allergic reaction.

7961,"I have no doubt that there will be long-term effects for some people, and I understand that we’re just beginning to study these."
7962,My issue was more with the assertion that healthy young athletes are having their lives permanently altered from this.
7963,Who are the people being studied in this?
7964,Usually older and sicker people.
7965,"Even if we’re trying to determine the long-term effects of COVID, there’s no reason to believe it’s life-altering for the typical mild case, especially in young people."
7966,I get that but people do things like this because they think there's some kind of benefit to it.
7967,I'm just wondering what they think they're accomplishing here because I don't get it unless they think the 2nd dose is the magical one that gives immunity or something and the first one is just bogus or something?
7968,I don't know.
7969,I wonder how they define school spread honestly.
7970,My sister lives in that county and has had other children show up positive in her kid’s classroom.
7971,The school informed the parents and left it up to them to decide if they wanted to test their kids.
7972,How do you possibly capture whether there was transmission in school in that case?
7973,"Also, not ever school in the county was in person in August."
7974,"The schools my family goes to where hybrid for a while, then 5 day optional, and only recently has the classroom been close to fill."
7975,This ain't no hok...
7976,&gt; If vaccines aren’t going to return things to normal then what’s the point?
7977,"I don't think OPs description is entirely accurate, but I dont understand this take either."
7978,The point is that vaccines make things *better*.
7979,They're not a time machine to 2019.
7980,"They reduce the number of dead people, they prevent hospitals from being overrun, they help prevent variants."
7981,They *aren't* a magic wand.
7982,"Hell, we don't even know yet how many people will consistently insist on not getting a vaccine."
7983,Different things can happen depending on how high or low that number really is.
7984,Vaccines are the path forward to things being normal.
7985,"But they aren't instantaneous, and we need to see the actual results of how they are working, what variants emerge, and especially how strong the immunity holds for how long before boosters are needed."
7986,"I'll fly this year as well, but with a mask."
7987,Its not that big of a deal.
7988,"Do you concur, Doctor?"
7989,"I keep a close look on delivery schedules for Belgium, and there is is barely any chance that this will be the case, lest both AZ and J&amp;J suddenly start matching Pfizer's delivery schedule."

7991,Idiots.
7992,I am absolutely no expert so these questions are as genuine as they are snarky.
7993,Doesn't insulin cost like $3 a vial to produce?
7994,And doesn't insulin in Canada cost like $40+ if you don't have insurance (ie aren't Canadian)?
7995,And doesn't some of that profit go toward subsidizing the cost of insulin for Canadian citizens?
7996,"All of these beliefs are based on quick google searches so let me know if I'm wrong, but it sounds like they already do exactly that."
7997,"It will be a lot easier than paying them on $0 dollars a week, I'll tell you that much!"
7998,"Anyway, you make a valid point!"
7999,*Increasing* the  spooky socialism level there would actually solve the issue of being underpaid during sick leave.
8000,Glad you're paying attention.
8001,Many other countries actually give much more reasonable and generous paid sick leave than the UK.
8002,Strange you didn't mention any of those for some reason.
8003,Wonder why.
8004,"God, I so wish that was true, but then I look to my elder relatives and see that none of the 60-69 year old people have received an invitation and I'm like..."
8005,Guess I'll wait forever...
8006,"Honestly, I think anyone who gets any of the COVID vaccines should be keeping track of their heartrate for the next 3 weeks afterwards."
8007,"Effects from the disease itself is weird, and vaccine reactions can be as well."
8008,"I had the J&amp;J. I'm older (40s), but otherwise quite healthy as I'm an athlete who has very low blood pressure and a low heart rate."
8009,I do not have low platelets.
8010,"However, my heart rate has been completely out of wack during exercise since I was vaccinated."
8011,It's been two weeks.
8012,"It is slowly getting better, but if I had any idea what was going to happen?"
8013,I would not have completed any of my workouts without a monitor after the vaccine—and I probably would have ended up resting more before going back to it.
8014,And this sort of lung destruction is happening with symptomatic patients or asymptomatic as well?
8015,And vaccinated vs unvaccinated.
8016,"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the virus is spreading rampantly within schools, where strict masking and social distancing and other arrangements to minimize student contact have kept transmission in check."
8017,"Rather, the outbreaks are more a reflection of students contracting the virus outside of school, according to school officials and an expert who has tracked COVID-19 cases in schools nationwide."
8018,Patent rights are more important than millions of deaths.
8019,A little strange that he's offering immediate post-jab treatment advice for a vaccine that hardly anyone is getting today (and most likely no one reading this thread) and mostly have only received in the past.
8020,"But yes, reading it as advice for one's past self to keep the scar size small makes a lot more sense."
8021,"For his sake, I hope his advice wasn't present tense advice and he hasn't been avoiding touching his shoulder for the last 15 years out of fear of rupturing some virus reservoir under his skin..."
8022,"&gt; Once everyone has been offered the vaccine

All Americans 18+ have access to the vaccine."
8023,"In my state, vaccination eligibility opened up to everyone a few days ago."
8024,"I was up late when the day changed so I checked availability, the nearest appointment to me was an hours drive so I decided to wait until later in the day for somewhere closer."
8025,Midday my nurse cousin called me to say I had an appointment scheduled 10 minutes away.
8026,"Long story short, this 20-something is 1 done and 1 to-go."
8027,yeah why should we want the whole of society to act more considerate of others
8028,"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the virus is spreading rampantly within schools, where strict masking and social distancing and other arrangements to minimize student contact have kept transmission in check."
8029,"Rather, the outbreaks are more a reflection of students contracting the virus outside of school, according to school officials and an expert who has tracked COVID-19 cases in schools nationwide."
8030,But didn’t the CDC say that vaccinated people can gather without masks?
8031,"Especially now that most states, like today in Massachusetts where vaccinations are open to all, vaccination rates are ramping up drastically."
8032,The bill was paid.
8033,"The vaccines planned for next year were not paid, and their shipment was canceled."
8034,"They were not paid for not due to lack of money or greed, but because the government is having internal unrelated issues reforming and passing a budget."
8035,"https://www.insider.com/pfizer-halts-shipment-of-covid-vaccines-after-israel-doesnt-pay-2021-4

No unpaid vaccines has been received:

&gt;...a shipment of 700,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine was due to arrive in Israel last Sunday but was delayed indefinitely, pending payment...

&gt;But these plans — as well as a motion to approve funds to pay for the 700,000 COVID vaccines — were halted when Netanyahu and defense minister Benny Gantz got into a political tiff over judicial appointments."
8036,"The other vaccines were paid for:

&gt;....rolled out a mass vaccination campaign after it paid for its first 10 million vaccines, but the supply began to run short in February...

8054,I do realize that but their tourism sucks too.
8055,who is comparing anything?
8056,did you reply to the wrong comment?
8057,"I know how efficacy works but I entertained your link just to confirm my knowledge is correct, and it is."
8058,"the video says ""each vaccinated person is 95% less likely to get sick each time they are exposed to covid""

that still doesn't add up to 100% protection, and when my kids are unvaccinated and with high risk factors involved, I'm not risking it."
8059,"if my mom is covered by 95% efficacy and my kids are _also_ covered by 95% efficacy, that's another story and makes it virtually impossible to get sick or more importantly, severely sick."
8060,so I'll wait until they are fully vaccinated instead of risking it with someone who visits anti-masker mass congregations twice a week.
8061,[removed]
8062,And staying home from work!
8063,I DESPISE people who think it's cool to come into the office w/a cold or the early stages of the flu.
8064,It is still absolutely baffling to me how people brush this virus off after hearing countless stories of the type of lung involvement COVID can bring.
8065,"Am I correct in stating this kind of lung involvement ('ground glass opacities') is *not* all that rare, nor is it only a feature of predominantly elderly patients?"
8066,"People act like this happens either extremely rarely, or only to elderly patients and it's so frustrating."
8067,Imagine being willing to risk your *lungs* because of an inability to perceive or correctly evaluate risk.
8068,Just fear mongering.

8072,We ignoring the fact republicans were literally caught saying they wanted this to spread to kill liberals and make money off of?
8073,Oh wait are you not allowed to say the truth here?
8074,I don’t think they can be “absolutely sure”.
8075,"And if it does spread in schools, don’t worry!"
8076,Their unvaccinated family members definitely can’t get it.
8077,They didn’t even check my ID here in Colorado at the Walmart and several states openly say they will give to the undocumented so they’re not checking either.
8078,Emily Oster has every professional incentive to downplay spread in schools.
8079,She’s been saying for months that schools are safe and even wrote an Atlantic article last month saying that parents should consider their kids “basically vaccinated” and go on vacation.
8080,She then got defensive when actual public health experts criticized that message or questioned her data.
8081,If she ever admitted school spread was a problem it would undo everything she’s spent all year claiming.
8082,"I’m not saying she’s wrong at this moment, school spread may still be incredibly rare and not a problem."
8083,But I no longer trust her implicitly on this.
8084,Plus he sold the vaccines to other countries to improve his world image before vaccinating his own people.
8085,"The problem is that in some countries, like the UK the vaccine is not yet offered as a free-for-all, so the healthy young by and large haven't been offered it yet, so they won't have had a chance to accept or turn it down yet."
8086,"If you release all restrictions for the vaccinated, probably a good chunk of younger healthy people (whether they would accept the vaccine or not) will decide that the restrictions shouldn't apply to them either, since they would consider themselves not to be at that much personal risk from the virus."
8087,YMMV.
8088,It's fair to assume that most states will require some form of ID.
8089,I can only speak for NY and we do require a form of ID to prove residency or proof of employment.
8090,How strict they are about checking that ID depends entirely on the facility you go to.
8091,I've seen remdesivir not working even when given in the first days of symptoms.
8092,We also tried favipiravir.
8093,We still cant figure if they work or not.
8094,We have patients that get better very quickly after administering either remdesivir or favipiravir and some that doesnt care if you throw half the antivirals we have at them.
8095,I also have noticed that 80+ yo usually withstand the disease better (low number of hospitalized people and even lower deceased) than the 55-75yo patients.
8096,"Dont know if their immune system recognizes the virus or what, but we just dont have 80+ yo hospitalized, at all."

8105,Out of 77 million people vaccinated only 5800 have tested positive.
8106,The vaccines work incredibly well and the measures you're taking to prevent transmission of fully vaccinated are absolutely overkill.
8107,The extremes are far more frequent than you think they are.
8108,"They're the majority of this sub with most being anti-lockdown, when lockdowns do in fact work incredibly well when needed."
8109,"In fact chances are you yourself are ideologically anti-lockdown, having formed that opinion never having read a study on the topic in your life."
8110,I had the exact same experience after the second Moderna shot.
8111,I like how you just pull everything out of your ass with no sources at all lmao
8112,No we fucking don't are you insane?
8113,I live in the south and people here are better than the rural areas but it's never closed over a month or two with most businesses bullshitting to stay open.

8117,No one in the usa took this shit seriously except for very few people.
8118,I don't know anyone who did but the two of us BUT YET THEY ALL INSIST THEY FOLLOWED ALLLLLLL THE RULES.
8119,It's almost like keeping schools close hindered the spread of the disease through the school age population.
8120,Who would've thought?
8121,I’m just trying to point out that the person who you replied to has a point; in the end it’s up to the political figures’ or person in power’s mercy.
8122,I also don’t like the metrics tied to hospitalization approach.
8123,"It’s just going to be a sine wave (hospitalization up -&gt; mask on + people stay indoors -&gt; hospitalization down -&gt; mask off and people go out, repeat) until vaccination has been completely fulfilled; I’d like it to be tied to vaccination rate and solely that, especially now since vaccines are available."
8124,"Tying it to metrics is going to happen but it’s always going to be at the mercy of politics in the end is my point, and probably what the first person that replied to you was saying as well."
8125,Example: you mentioned federal government.
8126,There was one of two people from the federal government who most of us listened to for the majority of the pandemic.
8127,Trump and Fauci.

8177,"The people who actually know how to quantify the data have said that you should get whatever vaccine is available, and are the same people who paused the J&amp;J vaccine due to a new datapoint being available because all three are unapproved vaccines authorized for emergency use and it’s their job to ensure their safety."
8178,"This new datapoint might change their recommendation on the use of the J&amp;J vaccine, and the reality is the J&amp;J vaccine is now tainted regardless of if it’s the cause of the clots which will hamper the vaccine rollout but unlike Europe with the AZ vaccine we have access to two other vaccines so that should be minimal outside of certain areas."

8209,Yet another superficial article that doesn't really get to the important points.
8210,No vaccine is perfect.
8211,The Sinovac vaccine is much less so.
8212,The true efficacy level of a vaccine has a very dramatic effect on the coverage needed to achieve herd immunity.
8213,"If you don't vaccinate across all of your populations and demographics, those populations are still vulnerable."
8214,"Despite their success in vaccination, they are still not at a level that could be considered herd immunity."
8215,A little basic math would go a long way here.
8216,"I mean, that's awesome for you."
8217,But not the reality for a huge number of people.
8218,Plus having other people willing to send stuff is a huge help.
8219,I don't think this is going to be as big of a problem as the media is portraying it.
8220,"At some point it will be easier to get a vaccine, than just faking it"
8221,"Even though Janssen isnt being used and AZ are useless deliverers, the Netherlands has surpassed 4.5 m vaccines and will hit 6 million within the coming two weeks, perhaps even before May."
8222,"We're quicker than Britain now with an average of 110k/day, up from at best 55k only two weeks ago."
8223,"Infections are super high (8000 a day), but deaths are a measly 22 average a day."
8224,"Currently, a 90+ year old would be just as likely to perish as a 70 year old, thanks to the vaccines."
8225,"Nah, talk and action is different."
8226,The UK took 5m doses from India.
8227,The EU did not.
8228,The EU also didn't plan for it and only looked into it after AZ's shortfall.
8229,The UK from the start planned to receive doses from a third world country struggling with Covid.
8230,"Wait, are they supposed to become senators before or after the fraud trial?"
8231,Pretty sure that’s how it works in Florida...
8232,But no one is saying we should trust what random doctors say.
8233,"The point is to debunk the fallacious claim by one random doctor (among others) that vaccines are this big, scary unknown that even doctors don’t know anything about."
8234,That's what I don't get.

8289,"So, they’re not going to be willing to drop mask requirements until a vast majority of people are vaccinated, nor should they."
8290,"Change it or not, I’ve been fully vaccinated since mid February with Pfizer and I don’t see me going massless anytime soon."
8291,At this point I just feel naked in a public place without one.
8292,No it’s stupid behavior on an individual basis.
8293,Businesses that care will have put on a mask mandate anyways.
8294,People who don’t believe in masks will tout medical conditions and not put one on anyways.

8296,Maybe for you.
8297,The rest of us are moving on.
8298,Covid is just going to be one of maybe illnesses that are floating around now that some people will die from every year but for most will basically be a cold because of vaccines.
8299,Did you lock yourself in your house and wear a mask at all times during flu season every year too?
8300,"You touched on this but i want to emphasize:

**Fully vaccinated people basically do not spread the virus even if they get infected**."
8301,Thank you.
8302,I appreciate your common sense and understanding.
8303,People need to take a breath and look at this from a place of reason like you
8304,Exactly.
8305,I don't get it.
8306,I have absolutely zero fear the flu will land me in the hospital or leave me with long-term issues but I still get the flu shot because having the flu really sucks and I would like to avoid it.
8307,With Covid the potential risks are a lot higher than for the flu so why wouldn't you get vaccinated?

8316,"Chicago thanks Springfield for those sites as well, because it has been 10x easier to drive down to a place where appointments are always available than deal with it in Chicagoland."
8317,I’m terrified of the end of mask mandates before we have ended community spread.
8318,The only reason I feel comfortable bringing my unvaccinated children anywhere is that everyone is masked.
8319,If we see unmasked people we go away from them.
8320,If they ended mask mandates then we would have to go back into lockdown until the kids can get vaccinated.
8321,Vaccinations are the endgame.
8322,"If after that things are not normal, society will break down."
8323,"The rate of vaccinations in the US is so high that even if there is an increase in spread, it'll be well overtaken by the speed of vaccinations."
8324,"If the vaccines get us out of this, and if it doesn't then we'll just get natural herd immunity because people aren't going to take this any longer, then it doesn't matter what we do at this stage because the outcome is always that the virus loses."
8325,"I don't blame people for not caring any more after like 14 months, shutting down the 99% to save the 1% only goes so far, there's a limit to how much we're willing to give up."

8327,"Covid is permanent, there is no going back to 'normal'"
8328,I wonder how many people would leap out of the anti-vax group if they were handed a stimulus check for 2k after their second shot.
8329,"That would stop the pandemic immediately, at least in the US."

8334,I guess I’ll give in to bullying now at the possible expense of my child/pregnancy.
8335,You’re a real hero.
8336,Round of applause for “justified” bullying everyone!
8337,"On the opposite end, can you show me the data that shows there is no impact to pregnancy, menstruation  or an unborn fetus?"
8338,The CDC doesn’t know and is actively collecting data but it seems you are VERY well versed on the matter.
8339,Teach me.
8340,Fuck me for wanting to wait while being safe and socially distancing.
8341,I’m so selfish
8342,We’re in a transition period and he doesn’t know yet.
8343,Look at how the angry right has treated him this entire pandemic when he tried to treat everyone like adults and tell them what he knows.
8344,"When information changes and he reports that, the angry right isn’t smart enough to understand that no, he didn’t lie, information changed."
8345,"Until the right stop purposely keeping their voters dumb and angry, it’s hard for Fauci to speak up openly because he’ll be vilified for it, because science necessarily means changing your opinion as new information comes out."
8346,"We just have a political party whose spent years demonizing science and education, and this is where you end up when purposely keeping your voters uninformed."
8347,the 95 percent number for the mRNA vaccines means you are 90-95 less likely of getting infected compared to someone who is unvaccinated.
8348,What are you talking about?
8349,That’s literally the job of the vaccine and they’ve been shown to confer robust immunity after just one dose.
8350,"Right, right."
8351,They’re content to stay isolated in their little countries.
8352,That must be it!
8353,Man I love the people down voting me.
8354,What normal situation can you imagine for someone stabbing you full of something in a syringe without talking to you and without your consent?
8355,"Sure if someone I knew said ""I'm giving you the vaccine"", and then wrestled me to the ground and forcibly gave it to me I'd just beat the crap out of them..."
8356,"But if they did it without saying anything, or I didn't know the person?"
8357,That's serial killer territory.
8358,That mask excuse was the worst move.
8359,We are not all children the Governments should have communicated that masks were needed for the health system and encouraged the general public to make and wear their homemade masks.
8360,It could have saved so much confusion and arguing.
8361,Any idea on how the vaccines do against variants?
8362,One of my dad's friends is currently back in India.
8363,I know he waited until he got fully vaccinated to go back but now I'm worried it was for nothing.
8364,Great to hear this from the New York Times.
8365,Is the tide turning in media messaging?
8366,Especially if you look at the risk of clotting from birth control or other medications.
8367,We always accept some degree of risk in everything we do
8368,Probably a very small number.
8369,I wish people wouldn't do this.
8370,Exaggerating side effects just makes you lose credibility in the long run.
8371,Maybe they didn't create a vaccine because they don't need it ASAP cause the virus didn't ravage their populations.
8372,I’m not qualified to answer that.
8373,"I’m also not sure they know, or at least they haven’t reported it definitively"
8374,&gt; Then you harshly punish and arrest and jail anyone who refuses to comply.
8375,"Make people either comply because of science, or because of fear."
8376,Oddly enough I've seen research that says the opposite.
8377,Punishing people harshly doesn't lead to better compliance.
8378,"Taking an education approach, encouraging rather than forcing compliance, has better results."
8379,This is actually what was done in NZ.
8380,There was almost no actual enforcement of lockdown measures.
8381,"Police spoke to people, cautioned them, sometimes gave a verbal or written warning."
8382,"But very, very few people were even fined, let alone arrested for breaking rules."
8383,"Also NZ is one of the few countries which has never had a mask mandate, at any point or alert level."
8384,"Masks are recommended when inside stores during Level 3 and 4 lockdowns, but not required."
8385,The only place they are legally required is on public transport and even that isn't actually enforced.
8386,Are the absolutely sure then that the vaccine is the cause?
8387,So you’re going to wear a mask forever then?
8388,You realize covid isn’t going away for probably years optimistically right?
8389,I’ll wear a mask in public since not everyone has been able to be vaccinated yet but I’m sure as hell not wearing a mask in private around my also fully vaccinated friends and family.
8390,The risk is basically zero to everyone in that situation.
8391,Wait you have to wear your masks walking around Disney Springs?
8392,"I agree, just what I've observed with some people."
8393,Think there's been a lapse in messaging throughout this entire pandemic where we've somehow not effectively communicated that the purpose of many things like masking and even vaccinating don't just fall into the category of individual risk tolerance but instead overall community risk.
8394,"It's why we still see so many people say ""well if your mask works so well than why do I have to wear mine?"
8395,""", we somehow still have failed in messaging that something like masks aren't just about your own risk but about protecting others."
8396,"Now I think that kind of messaging is an uphill battle in a place like the states where we have much more of an individualistic culture (which isn't even the worst trait, I think there are lots of benefits to that culture, it just doesn't do us any favors in times where we need a large scale communal response)."
8397,"For those who recovered, when did you gain your sense of taste and smell back?"
8398,"I tested positive after the vaccine (very annoyed), and that’s basically my only symptom."
8399,Not even a cough or fever.
8400,Thanks.
8401,"As a high risk person who also can't get the shot, this is really exciting news."
8402,Thank you all who are vaccinating!
8403,Your choice to vaccinate is an act of caring and kindness towards people like me.

8405,"While there have been no issues linked to pregnancy from the vaccines, there's been limited data, and i understand your trepidation."
8406,I respectfully disagree that there is a guaranteed harm from remote schooling.
8407,My first grader has done full virtual school all year by choice and the quality of his education this year has been excellent because the teacher he got is better than the teacher he was assigned to for the classroom.
8408,I won’t dispute that closing schools has posed a problem many but it hasn’t for all.
8409,"Honestly, I question the decision of people who have sent their kids back to school in person over the last month or two from full virtual."
8410,"I don’t think it’s dangerous for the kids to be in school now, but disrupting their routine this far into the year seems like a mistake to me."
8411,It’s ok they can get immunized the old fashioned way
8412,"you say that, but 80 percent of 65 plus have had at least one dose, and those are the people most likely to be watching fox news on a regular basis."

8416,I hope they reconsider having the Olympics move forward.

8423,Going to Orlando in a few days and look forward to not wearing a goddamn mask since I’m fully vaxxed
8424,"My personal guess is that the change to mask guidance will happen on April 30th, which marks Biden’s 100th day in office and the deadline for his “100 days of masking to stop the spread.”"
8425,Why is this literally the first time I'm hearing about this?
8426,And I'm on this sub everyday.
8427,I agree with you that the first wave was largely unavoidable and unstoppable in the US and UK.
8428,But in the US that first wave was largely restricted to a handful of regions.
8429,The US could have prevented the second wave over the summer across the South and Midwest.
8430,In much of the US and the UK summer saw cases drop low enough that it was then possible to move to a zero-Covid strategy.
8431,"It would have required closing borders and implementing quarantine systems like Taiwan and South Korea, where people were quarantined at home, but electronically monitored to ensure compliance."
8432,"The biggest error the US and UK made was taking a mitigation strategy, letting up on restrictions when cases got ""low enough"" and accepting continuing transmission."
8433,"They could have prevented the 2nd and 3rd waves of the virus, which killed far more than the first wave."
8434,"Either way, this birthday should be better than last for you."
8435,"I agree, but did you click the link?"
8436,The point is that anti-vaxers are falsely alleging that doctors don’t learn about vaccines in med school as a way of undermining trust in their safety and efficacy.
8437,Porter is closed I believe.
8438,Just stay inside then instead of wanting the whole society to adapt to you.
8439,Agreed.
8440,Just noticed the similarity.
8441,A cautionary tale for the rest of the world.
8442,If vaccines aren’t going to return things to normal then what’s the point?
8443,I’ll get my Pfizer shot 2 on Tuesday and I’ll be happy to dine indoors in 2 weeks after that and fly later this year.
8444,Zero Covid is unrealistic.
8445,they went inside for a large amount of time
8446,"Yep, everyone in Australia and New Zealand is so mature and all political leaders are so mature and great and amazing."
8447,Everyone else in the West is stupid and immature.
8448,Odd then how neither Australia nor New Zealand actually invented any of the very successful vaccines to fight the disease.
8449,Must be all that maturity...
8450,Okay thanks.
8451,Didn't see the post I guess.
8452,"My guess is the point they were making was that messing with the injection site can increase the likelihood/severity of scarring, not anything about psychological trauma"
8453,Yes
8454,Just found out a friend had it over Christmas and still  hasn't got her sense of smell back.

8513,It’s overkill and not exactly supported by science at this point.
8514,Same

8537,We need mandated paid sick leave.
8538,That’s really not where the downvotes come from.
8539,"The downvotes come from people spewing misinformation that the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid, only reduces it to a mild case."
8540,This is **NOT** true.
8541,These vaccines are over 90% effective at *preventing* infection.
8542,Breakthrough cases have been mostly mild when compared to non-vaccinated populations.
8543,The *only* reasons to continue to mask are twofold.
8544,"First, we don’t want to start making excuses for people who haven’t been vaccinated."
8545,"If only 30% of your population has been vaccinated, then it’s too hard to police who hasn’t been vaccinated and still needs a mask."
8546,"Second, for immuno compromised people because we haven’t vaccinated enough people to reach herd immunity and protect those people."
8547,Everyone else can pretty much get on with their vaccinated lives.
8548,There is *no reason* not to have indoor and unmasked social gatherings with fellow vaccinated friends and family members.
8549,"You can even be around unvaccinated people unmasked, in small numbers."

8554,What are you supposed to do when your workplace doesn’t give you the time off?
8555,Hopefully workplaces change from this and let people work from home when they are sick.

8557,"Wow, what a baby!"
8558,"Why not just live at home in a giant bubble and let the adults use actual guidelines and not ""I'm afraid of interacting with people and use Covid as an excuse to stay home"" to decide when best to go out in public or mask up."

8563,"&gt;not nearly enough for herd immunity, especially since kids aren't vaccinated."
8564,"There is natural immunity, though."
8565,Many people have had Covid already.
8566,They are likely to retain some level of protection.
8567,"Reinfections are possible and have been extensively documented, but they have been rare so far."
8568,10-20 % of people immune from their own disease + 50-60 % of people immune from vaccination may get us over the threshold.
8569,"&gt;My one worry is that in early May we will be at 50% fully vaccinated and then see a huge slowdown as people who resisted getting a shot start to see infection numbers plummet 

I'll be thrilled once we get to 50%."
8570,"The subset of people who didn't take covid seriously, caught it and refuse the vaccine are actually helping us get to herd immunity through their own stupidity."
8571,"Wouldn't be surprised if those people make up like 10-20% of the population, which gets us to 70%."
8572,Vaccinating previously infected people has always been recommended against as far as I know (in short timeframes) so I ain't surprised.
8573,"Then again my mum got the second dose after she was infected, though I think it was a false positive, and was fine."
8574,"CFR is probably a great metric to watch, because as the vulnerable are vaccinated, we should have far, far less fatalities per case, like 80-90% less."
8575,Basically CFR should fall 80-90%.
8576,5m less Indians got vaccinated because of the UK.
8577,0 Indians lost their vaccine to the EU.
8578,Cry more.

8583,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
8584,*
8585,My friends from India were warning about this months ago because they were really worried about the news they were hearing from home.
8586,This has been going on for a while now but Modi has been working hard to hide it to make his vaccine drive look successful while pleasing religious groups by letting free to act with impunity breaking the rules.
8587,"The strain from India can be a global danger to the rest of the he word, far worse than what the UK strain has done to France and Germany."
8588,"What do you mean Israel ""declared herd immunity""?"
8589,"If you commit fraud by stealing tax dollars, I want you to go to jail for a really really really really long time."
8590,"And I want everything you own, including your family home, to be seized by the government."
8591,Down to your underwear.
8592,"Not sure what to do about your kids, who are blameless, but we’ll sort that out."
8593,"Well boys, it’s here!"
8594,The moment we’ve all been preparing for!
8595,So sorry for your loss.
8596,Teenage mutant ninja variant?
8597,That is incredibly encouraging.
8598,Do you have a source?
8599,What did you write the fucking article?
8600,How about no.
8601,Fuck modern journalism.
8602,"Now this is a ""just wait two more weeks!"""
8603,"tweet I'm glad to see:

&gt;[The Israeli and UK experience show that once the population is 2-3 wks out after 50% of adults are vaccinated (something the U.S. hit this wknd), then you get strong suppression of the infection."
8604,](https://twitter.com/MartyMakary/status/1383874745632886789)
8605,"I’d just say as an entrepreneur, my company had unlimited sick days (past tense = company sold), and had to send someone home if they came in sick somewhat regularly (only 20 employees… maybe once or twice a year)."
8606,"I don’t know why people would come in when it wasn’t required…

As far as I was concerned, the risk of getting other employees sick was a much higher concern than the possible productivity they could provide by coming in."
8607,"We would tell the employees that if they felt good enough to work from home, they could, but also wasn’t expected."
8608,"I’m sure there are employers who are much worse about it than I was … but I think it’s also something that is so ingrained in American culture that even when the employer does everything right, unless the sick employee is literally shamed for doing it, they often come in sick."
8609,"For now, I'll wear a mask indoors in public places."
8610,"That's it, and probably I will not feel a need to do that anymore later on this year."
8611,&gt;Public and private K-12 schools in Maine are the sites of 52 of 75 active outbreaks listed by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention this week.
8612,But school-related cases represent only 10 percent of the state’s total cases over the past month.
8613,Only one school has recorded an outbreak with more than 20 cases.
8614,I don't see how people can think this article confirms their biases without reading the second paragraph of it.
8615,Most employers will not mandate until it receives full authorization and not just emergency as it is now.
8616,You’re just asking for a lawsuit before full authorization sadly.
8617,That’s probably the stupidest sick policy I’ve ever heard of.
8618,How do people even function?
8619,"the US is actually 60% white (not Hispanic or Latino), not 76%."
8620,they’re totaled separately.
8621,"60.1% white, 18.5% Latino or Hispanic, 13.4% Black, 5.8% Asian, 2.8% two or more races, and 1.5% indigenous American."
8622,the 76% figure doesn’t account for the Hispanic and Latino population at all.
8623,"I am in the DC metro area, vaccinations just opened up here to everyone 16+ and there are no appointments within 60 miles of me for the next week."
8624,So demand still seems very high.
8625,"I just decided and announced our new ""if you're coughing, sneezing, etc."
8626,"just work from home and we won't dock you a PTO day"" policy."
8627,"I'm worried about it being abused, but we'll see how it goes."
8628,"Let's hope the younger population doesn't have as much vaccine hesitancy, or this country is fucked"
8629,That's because the clinical trial endpoints were based around rates of hospitalization.
8630,"In medicine, you need to get evidence to make a claim, and things like ""it reduces asymptomatic spreading"" are much harder to measure than ""it stops you from being hospitalized."""
8631,"Given enough time, we'll probably start to get more data around spreading and the other stuff from indirect measures."
8632,Covid-19 DOES infect CNS tissue [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00758-5)
8633,Maybe OP is only using J&amp;J info.
8634,Pfizer and Moderna provide a better and different protection than J&amp;J.
8635,For those that don´t want to read the article: they will reinfect volunteers.
8636,You are safe.
8637,Some states that require residence sometimes just require that you maintain a residence there.
8638,"For example, non-residents of Florida were permitted to get a vaccine with a deed/lease and a utility/financial bill."
8639,A friend of mine was able to get vaccinated in NY even though he’s a CA resident because he attends school in NY.
8640,"So people should know that when they say “resident,” they don’t always mean that you must be a legal resident of the state with an ID from the state."
8641,There are exemptions in many states for the people who live there who aren’t residents.
8642,They still recommend wearing sunscreen when it's cloudy and cooking your steaks well done.
8643,So... probably never.
8644,Hydrate with electrolytes before (like the day before) and after your shot.
8645,"I don't know if there are any studies yet that support hydrating for reducing symptoms, but it can't hurt."
8646,Let’s not speculate about ADE without giving a high quality source that suggests it’s a thing.
8647,"It would have also been seen in vaccine trials,"
8648,"they were going to become available to all adults at one point, that much was obvious."
8649,not much of a prophecy there.
8650,Sounds about right.
8651,"In the great before times, there was an outbreak of influenza (diagnosed, not just a bad cold that people conflate with the flu) that resulted in multiple kids in my child's class being hospitalized, and we didn't hear diddly dick about it from the school."
8652,"Yes, my kid caught it, and then it went through our family."
8653,"I'm not a durable person, lung wise, so I was sick for months after."
8654,I did not enjoy it.
8655,"I have zero faith in our school district to safely and responsibly handle covid, especially since they're basing their current safety protocol on old, disproved information about the Rona."
8656,I dunno these articles are poorly informed and seem like just a way to try to scare people.
8657,"Herd immunity comes from a combination of vaccination, exposure and recovery."
8658,"Israel declared herd immunity having vaccinated only 56% of the population because they had tracked another 15% of people that had recovered and they were considered ""immune enough"" to have immunity."
8659,The goal is still to eventually vaccinate everyone but there is a turning point well before that happens.
8660,"J&amp;J will deliver a lot in June, for Norway it will be 700K in June so perhaps double of that for Belgium."
8661,Also that table does not include already delivered doses.
8662,"If you take into account that Pfizer will deliver as much in July as in June, giving a large chunk of the adult population a first dose by end of June is not far fetched at all."
8663,&gt;it's making me very uncomfortable though I'm vaccinated.
8664,"You are literally protected, even if you catch it, you get the sniffles, that's the whole point of the vaccine."
8665,&gt;I think the past year has given me something akin to PTSD.
8666,That might be true if you're fearful of others once you have the vaccine.
8667,"For that, we need actual sick time."
8668,"When I worked in a government job, we earned one sick day a month."
8669,"After having a baby, I had to use my sick time (all 10 days of it, lol) during maternity leave, and then came back to zero PTO."
8670,The baby (in daycare) was sick more than one day a month.
8671,Plus we had a bunch of doctor’s appointments.
8672,We had a bout with chronic ear infections.
8673,"When I was sick, there literally just was no option to stay home without losing my job (especially since FMLA was used up)."
8674,"This was repeated with my second, and I eventually just had to quit."
8675,All because of the damn PTO.
8676,This is just one story.
8677,So many essential workers workers have had little to no PTO during COVID and couldn’t take unpaid time off.
8678,We have broken system in this country and many will not be able to stay out of the office with colds until it is fixed at a systemic level.
8679,I volunteer as tribute
8680,So far the trials indicate basically no symptoms and close to 100 efficacy in minors.
8681,But those aren't done yet
8682,"They look [pretty flat](https://covidactnow.org/us/texas-tx/?s=1762683) to me, but the point is, you can't draw this kind of conclusion because you don't know what would've happened without any particular event."
8683,"Scientists and statisticians do a lot of work to figure out why things happen or don't happen the way they do, much more work than some guy on the internet saying ""Look!"
8684,"A baseball game happened!"""
8685,As an immigrant myself I love it.
8686,"My regular poker group includes Canadians, a Mexican, a Russian, a couple Koreans, an Indian, a Thai and a couple native born Kiwis."
8687,I'm a teacher and a class of 30 kids will very often include 15 or more nationalities.
8688,"Of course there is tension around immigration here too and many people not so happy with how diverse NZ has become, especially since this is all recent."
8689,NZ was basically just British and Maori until the 1990s.
8690,The changes have been fast and dramatic.
8691,Lots of schools have been open for a long time.
8692,good to hear from him.
8693,I am here.
8694,I don’t want to be here either.
8695,I thought schools had a magic covid bubbles and kids didn't get it?
8696,🙄
8697,We already knew that though
8698,"Are you ""fully vaxxed"" immediately after 2 doses of moderna/pfizer or some period of time after the 2nd dose?"
8699,So I woke up with a fever and diarrhea.
8700,It's really my fault for not doing more planning here.
8701,Everywhere?
8702,That will be a while.
8703,"For example, i doubt they drop it for flights anytime soon."
8704,Maybe not until sometime in 2022.
8705,But for state and businesses i see dropping the mandates sometime this summer.
8706,Just like how it’s all 7.99999 billion peoples opinion that authoritarianism is the SMART approach!
8707,And if you don’t want it you’re part of the problem!
8708,"Wow, very dumb."
8709,Similar with pfizer except my reaction started within 5 hrs and dragged on for 5 days alternating mild to moderate symptoms.
8710,"Mostly muscle and joint aches, fatigue, low grade fever (topped out at 101F), pretty serious diarrhea through the 2nd and 3rd nights  that never hit during the day."
8711,Weird.
8712,Unfortunately I got the less common symptom of swollen and sore underarm lymph node and that is just resolving 21 days later.
8713,"I'm thankful that I never got the headache at least and even more grateful that at the end of my 40s, my immune system gives such a robust response."
8714,Edit to add: 2 weeks my stamina for excersize (biking/pilates) has been poor but am back to normal.
8715,"Your best chance is in the south (Alabama, Louisiana, etc)."
8716,"We have sick leave in the US, I don't really know what you're going on about."
8717,When I need to take a sick day I send an email to my superior and I stay home.
8718,I get paid as if I worked that day.
8719,"Of course not every job is like this, but not every job is like this in other countries, too."
8720,That won’t happen as long as paid sick leave isn’t mandatory.
8721,I agree that they aren’t a time machine and we need a critical mass of people vaccinated for them to truly be effective but OPs view that they won’t help at all is mildly infuriating.
8722,I think we're a long way from that happening.
8723,Maybe with a high majority of the population being vaccinated and a low daily case count.
8724,School is out in a month.
8725,"There's literally no reason to keep spreading COVID, knowing that all those people lied when they said school was safe."
8726,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence
8727,90-95% efficacy means that you have a 90-95% reduction in the probability of catching the virus versus an unvaccinated person.
8728,It's literally the definition of vaccine efficacy.
8729,"I'm making these numbers up (the risk isn't that high, just using simple numbers): if I have a 1 in 100 chance of being exposed in New Mexico, but 1 in 10 chance in Michigan, this means by chance of getting COVID when unvaccinated is 1% and 10% respectively."
8730,"When vaccinated, assuming a 90% efficacy, my risk is .1% in New Mexico and 1% in Michigan."
8731,The 10X higher exposure risk in Michigan makes my chance of catching COVID just as high in Michigan as it is in New Mexico without the vaccine.
8732,There is a nuance to this as to an extent the protection of a vaccine is *relatively* binary - either you have enough antibodies or you don't (exposure viral load aside).
8733,"However, you personally have no way of knowing how effective your body was at creating neutralizing antibodies."
8734,"Therefore, in practice, whether the protection is binary or not is not super relevant."
8735,Just as Trump said
8736,I'm up voting your comment because you recognized the impact of last year on you.
8737,I think a lot of people need to look at the symptoms of PTSD and assess themselves.
8738,"It was a really rough year for everyone, and there needs to be a transition period before things can go back to normal."
8739,"As Nick Carter would say, “Everybody: Rock your body.”"
8740,"Promise made, promise kept."
8741,"That you healthcare workers, drug companies, pharmacies, and all of the logistics folks who helped make this happen."
8742,Let’s keep vaccinating!
8743,It's extremely less likely
8744,"Canada - ok, if you're over 60 and not in the workforce you're eligible for your vaccine now."
8745,Joined the fully vax club about an hour ago!
8746,Articles like [this](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/18/gov-newsom-calls-covid-herd-immunity-illusory-is-he-right) that downplay the vaccination effort and push for a world Olin pursuit of “zero risk” which is an illusion scare me.
8747,This quote in particular should worry anyone who resides in California.
8748,"We will reach herd immunity, but not before this winter,” Mokdad said."
8749,"He expects the virus to subside over the summer and fall but to return in winter again with the onset of cold, drier weather more favorable to its spread."
8750,"It’s unlikely to drive a surge as bad as last winter’s, he said, but it’s likely that health officials will need to reimpose travel and mask requirements and restrictions on gathering.”


Never mind the fact that all vulnerable and elderly will be long since vaccinated and by that point probably the vast majority of the population 12+ will be."
8751,"I remember we were trying to come up with all these reasons why India wasn't hit quite as hard from the pandemic (boy, how many times have we done that, with so many different countries and states?"
8752,).
8753,Not the case for my sister and I who both had the virus.
8754,No side effects to speak of from the first Pfizer shot besides a sore arm and a little fatigue for me.
8755,"Second shot comes in three days, we will see how that one goes soon."
8756,I can't wait!
8757,It was pretty much the same for a lot of Israelis.
8758,People waited near the vaccination spots in the evening when all the appointments were done and queued up for whatever was left.
8759,I'm in my 20's with no health problems and I got the second shot in early February.
8760,I agree and I don't see why some people are so opposed to this.
8761,"It's all optional, no one is forcing you do."
8762,It will certainly help flu season.
8763,Patents.
8764,Can't let pfizer make a bit less money off the vaccine they practically spent nothing on even of it saves thousands of lives
8765,"In response to why people have to mask after  vaccination;
“This is something that, as we get more information, it’s going to be pulling back that you won’t have to."
8766,"But currently, the reason is that when you get vaccinated you are clearly diminishing dramatically your risk of getting infected.”"
8767,I have no issue scamming people who act this ignorantly.
8768,That's on them
8769,"This is fantastic, however we are starting to ""hit the wall"" as they say."
8770,"The country will ""cap out"" at somewhere between 50-60% of all adults vaccinated - not nearly enough for herd immunity, especially since kids aren't vaccinated."
8771,"Since the government has said they won't mandate vaccination, industry and businesses are what will save us."
8772,Employers are starting to mandate vaccination if you return to the office.
8773,A few stadiums are mandating if you want to attend games.
8774,Cruise lines are mandating as well.
8775,"Once kids can be vaccinated, you can bet school districts will make it mandatory."
8776,"I think once the FDA grants full authorization of the vaccines, instead of just emergency authorization, you'll see most companies mandate it because of business liability insurance."
8777,"Airlines will do it, and certainly if you want to travel overseas, you'll have no choice but to get vaccinated."
8778,"In other words, right now people have a choice."
8779,They won't forever unless they want to never fly or work (in most jobs) or go to school.
8780,"Oy this whole comment chain is just so cringe-inducing... 

It’s rare to see someone so confidently and extensively ignorant in a single comment thread"
8781,Would that risk lawsuits?
8782,"Yeah, I mean I don't agree with them politically, but I'm also really not into blaming people for something they're not doing."
8783,Being on opposite political sides doesn't mean you automatically do or should disagree with a person about literally everything.
8784,That's toxic and also probably means you aren't doing things for the right reason either.
8785,[removed]
8786,That's how my wife and I got ours.
8787,Had to drive an hour and a half out of the city but we had no trouble registering
8788,[deleted]
8789,"That is insane, it’s not even worth discussing with you if you legitimately believe that"
8790,Yes.
8791,"Your governor put first responders above 112 year olds too, that's just the way it is."
8792,Individuals are at less of a risk and provide less of an essential service than teachers.
8793,Gotta love that Conservative foresight
8794,"The infrastructure to produce mRNA vaccines in quantity, which hopefully will be maintained after the current pandemic, will have great value going forward."
8795,"New pathogens sequenced in hours, vaccines designed in days, production of enough for trials in a few weeks."
8796,I don't think we will be able to hasten approval processes much more.
8797,There will still be months between new pathogen identification and completion of pilot trials for safety and larger trials for efficacy.
8798,"But the greater mRNA vaccine production capacity humanity is building now will mean everyone (in developed nations) could be eligible for vaccination in the future equivalent of say Oct 2020, rather than the current situation where it took til April of the following year..."
8799,Take it up with your governor.
8800,"https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download

17 days until the symptom onset curves diverge, implying protection a few days before."
8801,Protection does seem to increase over time for more than a month.
8802,"14 days until you're ""fully"" vaccinated according to the CDC (although your level of protection then is lower than mRNA vaccines 14 days after the first dose)."
8803,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/03/21/operation-warp-speed-head-says-trump-administration-responsible-for-90-of-vaccine-rollout/amp/

8805,Exporting vaccines while your own people suffer seems pretty shortsighted.
8806,"No matter, the US will bail you guys out just like we always have since 1915."
8807,"Like I said, hang tight, we’re on our way with the good shit."
8808,You’re welcome.
8809,I’m way more struck by the data on new cases and hospital numbers.
8810,Still down on last week despite the lockdown relaxation.
8811,Three weeks ago the UK went bonkers in the sun with out of control parties in parks and gardens in towns and cities across the land.
8812,I thought we’d pay a heavy price.
8813,It’s soooo good to be wrong.
8814,5 and up by the end of the year.
8815,"I don't think there will be a rush for 0-4 after that, since they won't be in school and the adults and older kids around them will be vaccinated."

8822,Nice anecdote.
8823,"My dad got some fairly nasty side effects, my mom had zero, and my brother and I both had moderate ones."
8824,My roommate was totally fine after the first shot and had vicious body aches the day after the second.
8825,"Sooooo, let’s add up all ten or so people between your family and mine and average them out to “people may have moderate side effects”?"
8826,Or  just believe people when they tell you about their lived experiences.
8827,To be honest I think this will depend on demand in your area.
8828,If you can get to a more rural area where the department of health is distributing I think they will be more likely to look the other way on residency.
8829,You are likely a person with some privilege able to supervise and help.
8830,Your child is probably not suffering from any issues like a disability.
8831,"The harm of remote schooling is more of a broad one - average to smart kids from supportive homes will do ok, but those kids do anyway."
8832,Why do we let anyone make any choices in their own lives with that logic.
8833,"Everyone makes objectively worse decisions all the time, and a lot of those decisions affect other people."
8834,Doubtful that law would hold up if it's fully authorized.
8835,"There is plenty of precedent allowing schools, both public and private, to require students are vaccinated, with religious and medical exemptions."
8836,Exactly.
8837,Phasing was put in place due to a lack of supply.
8838,Phasing prioritized vulnerable populations and essential worker with higher risk of exposure.
8839,Opening up eligibility doesn't do anything about availability.
8840,"Luckily, supply is looking better by the day."
8841,"Smallpox, I'm only in my fifties and have one."
8842,Had to get it when travelling from Australia to the UK as a kid because the plane stopped over in countries that had smallpox.
8843,"finally, why was Oregon so slow yo?"
8844,He is getting downvoted because he is taking the best reaction from Covid and the worst reaction from the vaccine.
8845,That isn't a fair comparison
8846,Lockdown the country for months whilst rolling out a vaccination program with 95% uptake in vulnerable groups
8847,"there we go again, the thought police prevent discussion about a disaster caused by political decision being censored!"
8848,[removed]
8849,The only defense I heard about their early statements on masks is that they saw the hoarding happening at grocery stores and were afraid if they suggested masks they would see hoarding with that as well.
8850,Especially with N95 masks.
8851,A damned if you do and damned if you dont situation.
8852,"100,000 people is a lot of people to die."
8853,That’s 3 times higher than all road traffic deaths in just the under 65 category.
8854,"I hadn’t realised it was that bad, jeez."
8855,"I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, and I'm wondering what's the recommended time that I wait before I hang out with other fully vaccinated people?"
8856,"At least from what I understood, it seemed like there was a huge stigma associated with wearing a mask before the pandemic."
8857,"It signaled, ""I'm sick with something really severe or contagious that warrants this PPE."""
8858,"A couple times when I was younger, my father and grandmother had pneumonia at different times and wore a medical mask for a couple weeks, so maybe that's where it's from though."
8859,"I do hope that attitudes change, but it may be entirely possible that we return to the stigma since almost everyone, regardless of whether they do right now or don't, won't want to wear a mask in the future, and that it'll go back to the message of ""I'm sick with something so you should avoid me"""
8860,Fuuuuu

8863,&gt;Where are you getting 190 cases from?
8864,This is the most recent source I found.
8865,It's a slide from the CDC/ACIP meeting on the J&amp;J vaccine one week ago.
8866,Thanks for posting this.
8867,I went through the actual data to try to figure out where that 190 figure could possibly be coming from and couldn't find anything.
8868,My guess is that just some random number floating out there among anti-vaxxers
8869,Fully vaccinated flex here!
8870,"( Well technically not in another 2 weeks  because I got my #2 moderna dose last Friday ) 

Just mild fever and sleepy all day Saturday."
8871,All good by Sunday!
8872,(40F with Mild Athma)
8873,Won’t be any different than any other year.
8874,Or last year.
8875,"And the thing was it usually worked out that someone ""tOuGhEd"" it out and gave everyone else the flu probably causing for delays and downtime tahn if the 1-2 people that got sick had just stayed home."

8881,It’s my understanding that there’s convergent evolution for a number of variants.
8882,That is: many developed the same type of mutations.
8883,Take the supposed “double mutant” from India.
8884,It’s so called because it has mutations from two different variants of concern found in the rest of the world and that vaccines are already known to protect against.
8885,It stands to reason though that there could be evasion of the Indian variant from vaccines if those mutations combine to make it more able to evade antibodies.
8886,But in and of themselves the mutations are handled right now.
8887,It’s also a worry that the spread in India and other countries is so severe that it’s mutating beyond the scope of our understanding and we’ll have useless vaccines.
8888,But this was a worry before the “double mutant” in India anyway.
8889,Why has Europe produced so little vaccines anyways?
8890,What happened?
8891,The vax tiers were stupid to start with.
8892,I know a bunch of people who were able to get vax who were not technically eligible.

8898,"Tetanus is one we probably cannot do, so that vaccine will always be needed."
8899,(I'm assuming no unexpected breakthroughs) There are probably a few others.
8900,However the more we can eradicate entirely the better.
8901,I did take one of these in December: https://gtxcorp.com/covid-19-igg-igm-rapid-test-kit/ and it came back negative.
8902,"I guess the question is, can they detect these types of antibodies almost a year after infection (Jan 2020 to December 2020)?"
8903,People are dropping like flies.
8904,We have around 50% of the 80+ unvaccinated.
8905,Give them the vaccine.

Is masking and social distancing THAT bad?"

9140,"Everything i see lately points to vaccines for as young as 6months old infants by early 2022, best case 2021 but more realistically the very beginning of 2022."
9141,"So if that’s remotely close to reality, and i think they’re being conservative with these estimates, then we’re talking about maybe 3 months of masking and social distancing into 2022 for 10% of the population."

9199,Are employers in certain states allowed to mandate this?
9200,Here in TX my employer has said they are not able to mandate vaccinations for people going back to the office so it’s a personal choice.
9201,"That doesn't mean it doesn't provide some of immunity, even if not as good as the vaccines."
9202,And reinfection numbers are also rather low.
9203,There is no data that is that granular.
9204,We know that there have been upticks in cases associated with reopening restaurants.
9205,"When I see epidemiologists saying publicly that they will eat indoors again, that will be a big factor in my decision making."
9206,yep!
9207,"nationwide it should be 16+, they just use the term ""adult"" instead."
9208,"you won't be able to get moderna until you're 18, though."
9209,I can’t figure out what is more stupid... not wanting the vaccine or spending $200 on something that is so easily faked.
9210,"Once restrictions are removed, they will not be reinstated unless there's a huge number of breakthroughs and hospitalizations."
9211,*Maybe* we impose travel restrictions to/from countries with low vaccination rates.
9212,But people are kidding themselves if they think the *basically already completely open* US is going to lockdown again this Winter
9213,"I got shot #2 last week, so next week will be when I'm fully vaccinated."
9214,Eligible does not mean available today.
9215,We need over 200 million more shots in arms to fully vaccinate enough of the population for herd immunity.
9216,Most of those are not manufactured yet or not shipped to the various States yet.
9217,"Most people who aren't vaccinated yet will not be able to get one this week, or the next."
9218,It's still going to take 2 months to get shots in that many arms.
9219,"Ours are about to turn 5 and 7 and we need to send them back, badly."
9220,"We just got our 2nd shots on Friday, but cases are still high around us and going up."
9221,Not trying to throw them into the fire and risk long term issues.
9222,Feels like there’s no right answer for parents.
9223,&gt;By early March... much too late for international travel restrictions to make much of a difference.
9224,That's rubbish.
9225,"And there was a time, around July, when Victoria's cases exceeded UK's on a per capita basis."
9226,And then the **local transmission was eliminated** - because a hard and long lockdown was implemented.
9227,Most places only require a doctors note if you are out a lot.
9228,A cold means you are out at most two weeks out of a full year - that being a worst case where you get several colds.
9229,So if you are out more than 15 days (3 weeks) we demand a doctors note because you obviously have something wrong other than a cold and need to get it checked out.
9230,Of course if you are out for something you see a doctor for you should get a note.
9231,"A sore throat is possibly an infection, so you  need to see a doctor to check (or more likely a lab nurse), and the note will take a few seconds to write."
9232,They're planning to ramp up Manufacturing.
9233,Might want to reread your wording.
9234,It does read like the opposite.
9235,yep.
9236,We talked to many people from Chi-town area that came to Springfield 6 weeks ago for the shots
9237,And the fastest path to full immunization is to do everything you can to encourage the fence-sitters.

9239,My experience as well.
9240,Just a little tired for a day after dose 2.
9241,"If it makes her feel better, why do you care?"
9242,If something makes your friend more comfortable why does it matter?
9243,"Is it necessary, probably not, but why does it have an impact on you?"

I've already gotten my first vaccine shot here in the United States, so it's been tempting to start thinking of this as ""almost over."""
9248,"But globally speaking, it's far from over."
9249,There is no good data on lockdown effectiveness.
9250,My opinion is based on watching what people do during lockdown here in CA.
9251,And then looking at what say Singapore and Taiwan do.
9252,"In general, vaccines are pretty effective against variants."
9253,"The only vaccine that has been shown to not be effective against a variant was the AstraZeneca vaccine against the B.1.351 variant, which is still the variant that seems to have the highest degree of immune escape."
9254,"Other vaccines (Pfizer, J&amp;J, Novavax) have demonstrated good, but reduced, efficacy vs B.1.351."
9255,Or maybe people just want to go back to socializing and having fun.
9256,It may actually be faster in the US because of our slower rollout.
9257,"It could be slower too, but they were going so fast at vaccination that I can imagine they overshot the break point quickly."
9258,I have been thinking about this for a while.
9259,Adults get sicker.
9260,Sicker people transmit more.
9261,"Kids can transmit it, but it seems like they don't as much (couple of studies show this)."
9262,So we have half the people vaccinated that are disproportionately good at spreading the virus.
9263,Transmission should go down by more than half.
9264,The questions become really intricate at this point.
9265,Are the remaining unvaccinated adults more likely already recovered from infection?
9266,Are they likely to get infected now?
9267,"If they do get infected now, are they likely to have exposure to unvaccinated people?"
9268,The infection rate is much much lower now than it was in january but we're almost half way to January numbers.
9269,That is cause for concern but I also wonder if it just means less young people are getting turned away because the elderly aren't taking up the majority of ICUs and Hospital beds.
9270,Calling Fauci overly cautious is the most ignorantly American thing I’ve read all day.
9271,To anyone reading the evidence in good faith he’s clearly moderate in that respect.
9272,Everyone was paid salary.
9273,There was no hourly or overtime.
9274,"It was a 24x7 NOC, and sometimes things got hectic, so perhaps they thought they would be helping out if that happened."
9275,"Also, the environment was very friendly and social… so perhaps they just wanted to hang out."
9276,People would often hang out for hours after their shift was over normally.
9277,The former employees all hang out with eachother years later — so it was definitely a strong social bond.

9296,yes .... pfizer and moderna have greatly increased supply since jan/feb.... we are no longer supply constrained in the vast majority of states.... the link above can show how much supply is left relative to how many shots administered... and we have at least 2-4 weeks of supply in basically 99% of states...

A lot of ignorance is driving COVID around the world."
9305,To be frank.
9306,"I haven’t paid attention to any of the state government legislation on this, so if the republicans said that stuff I don’t care and still don’t, it’s not like I thought of republican politicians as rational human beings to begin with."
9307,"My work started remote work late February, and by March almost no one came in."
9308,"When the state order came in March to stay home, it wasn’t really a change for me."
9309,Masks?
9310,As soon as the first case was detected in our area we put them on.
9311,I really didn’t care what the state had to say.
9312,Luckily we had a few n95s at home so shortages didn’t affect us.
9313,"I don’t know, I might be a minority here, but I never gave a shit about what the state government was saying."
9314,Governor extended lockdown?
9315,Good they’re doing the right thing and I commend them but it wasn’t going to affect my life.
9316,Lockdowns are lifted?
9317,I’m still not going to eat at a restaurant for a while.
9318,My understanding is that a lot of places still require masks regardless of state orders.
9319,And there were violators despite state orders as well.
9320,"So I think it’s an individual action as opposed to government action*

*actually, I think if from the very beginning this wasn’t turned into a political issue by the orange dude, it might’ve been different."
9321,"So in regards to that, sure it could’ve been a government thing."

9361,Right?
9362,The exact same thing is the case with covid.

9379,Thank you for pointing this out.
9380,Here in Canada we are getting the same messaging around this virus now impacting youth at higher rates and more severe outcomes.
9381,The problem is that the evidence behind this claim is entirely anecdotal.
9382,"Nothing showing weekly admissions by demographics has been released to the public, so we must take our officials at their word."
9383,However the trust between the people and those in power is particularly strained and good will towards them is low.
9384,"Some of this turns on the definition of ""young""."
9385,In my province of Alberta our chief of public health includes anyone under 65 within the definition of young.
9386,"By this definition, there is some truth to the claim that more young folks are winding up in the hospital."
9387,"But so we're clear, it's basically people between the ages of 50 and 65 that are seeing this."
9388,Are these folks young?
9389,Not by the standards of most.
9390,"But it's all relative, and they are certainly younger than people in their 70s and 80s."
9391,"If we're saying that people 40 and younger are being sent to the ICU in droves, that seems highly dubious."
9392,The severe cases of 20 and 30 somethings getting extremely sick and even dying still occur--but they seem like extreme outliers.
9393,My more skeptical side is wary of these claims around younger people entering the hospital at significantly higher numbers because I have yet to see convincing evidence.
9394,And this should be a very simple thing to prove with weekly age banded hospital admissions.
9395,The real question is why would health experts stretch the truth about how many young people are entering hospitals?
9396,What do they gain?
9397,"Are they assuming it will happen, therefore this is all pre-emptive?"
9398,You think you are gangsta but in reality you are just a dumb ass.

9403,Or quit her career i guess.
9404,That in itself is a horrible UX.
9405,I refuse to spend hours a day to get an appointment or potentially drive hours to get it and that’s completely reasonable of me.
9406,You see this whole public health campaign to tell people to get a shot but for some reason making it easy to get wasnt in the program.
9407,There are like 3-4 “the CDC makes insane recommendations we ignore” talking points that I see repeated daily on here as a way to justify ignoring the CDCs recommendations and it’s frustrating to witness.

9423,But now I'm wondering if that's why my 1st shot went so poorly.
9424,"My dog needs surgery and will need a lot of help for a few months following, I really have to be physically up for it."
9425,There's just no info on this as far as I can tell.
9426,That’s incredible.
9427,"Yeah once herd immunity goes up we’ll be in a place where it’s much less dangerous for us to chill a little on young, immune compromised, etc groups getting vaccinated, since the majority of healthy middle aged Americans won’t be putting them at risk of infection."
9428,I’m so excited to be in a place where we can start feeling good about going out again!
9429,"For what it’s worth, I just felt tired after my second shot."
9430,That didn’t mean much to me though cause I’m always tired.
9431,"If we manage to get a vaccine regimen approved for children soon, summer vacation is going to be absolutely bananas this year."
9432,Different age groups spread covid more than others.
9433,"But still, the timeline doesn’t add up for me."
9434,May 1st seems way too soon to have any benefit from that new deal.
9435,Mate you are taking into account a 100% infection rate.
9436,You have to allocate chance of infection and then provide the efficacy chance after exposure.
9437,Also only ~5800 have tested positive out of 77 million vaccinated.
9438,Stop fear mongering.
9439,Again mentioned is Serum Institute not able to full at full capacity due to export restrictions of raw materials from the US.
9440,Does anyone know what raw materials is only available in the US which is limiting the ability of foreign nations in producing the vaccine?
9441,Is it something needed to produce all vaccine types?

9459,It's always hot and sunny in the major cities that are seeing record breaking case counts in India.
9460,That 30-39 is my age group and I hope the number reflects lack of eligibility and not hesitancy.
9461,Many of us are parents of small to medium children and friggin desperate to go places and get these kids out of the house!
9462,I hope the rate goes up sharply now that eligibility has opened across the US.
9463,If the major US airlines came together and made the vaccine mandatory for flight on their aircraft it would force a huge portion of the population to get vaccinated.
9464,While we do have a slight supply shortage it has been sufficient to cover those who need it.
9465,"We have just enough, and thanks to the longer interval method it has worked fantastically."
9466,"We could have supply jump to 2m a day from tomorrow and it would no longer have a profound effect on deaths, the vaccination scheme has already done the most vital part of its job."
9467,"Not sure why you’re being downvoted, but this can be absolutely true depending on where you’re located, though, if you’re consistent, even on CVSs website if you spam the search button and keep typing different zip codes around your area, it will pop up an appointment, most people don’t know this and can’t be bothered to spend extra time on availability."
9468,"However, as more people become fully vaccinated already, appointments should become significantly easier to obtain, I would guess we are about a month and a half away from that."

9476,What's AZ?
9477,&gt;Of course there’s a risk.
9478,"There‘s a risk every time you shove your kids in the car and drive around, too, and most people don’t think twice about that."
9479,And yet I’d speculate there’s a good chance a kid has a higher chance of dying in a traffic accident than of Covid.
9480,"&gt;
&gt;The question is whether the risk is tolerable, and that’s up to each individual parent."
9481,Things that we don't leave up to the 'tolerable' standard for parents: seatbelts and car seats.
9482,This analogy is broken.
9483,Clearly big banks should have been held more responsible for the way they behaved with the 2008 crash (and many other things).

9491,"Table 13 (severe) in the Pfizer-BioNTech FDA report shows 75%

I believe the 'virtually 100%' which they all appear to have is about medical intervention which is probably the most important factor anyway."
9492,If you read through these sources you'll also see a lot of other big differences in the trials overall and even their end point definitions.
9493,So it's just hard to draw a direct comparison.
9494,Or to put it another way I think we're making a gross over simplification to just compare the overall efficacy numbers obtained with different definitions and under different test conditions.
9495,And you might say the other day after dose ranges say 100%.
9496,Which is true but also proves the point that they just reported data differently.
9497,We can sit here and slice and dice this data all day long to get different % results.
9498,And this isn't binary.
9499,It's not so simple that you either have covid or do not.
9500,Or that you are exposed or are not.
9501,There is also a factor of viral load or how much you're exposed to.
9502,And what variants are you exposed to and so on.
9503,And to your point about there would be less cases in the placebo also then.
9504,You're correct there was less cases in the Placebo group in the Pfizer trial as well.

9507,There is no reward and no punishment for returning it.
9508,People just do it because it is the right thing to do.
9509,I don’t see the majority of people in US wearing a mask when they’re sick.
9510,This country is way too selfish.
9511,Just look at how the response to masks were when we said “this is to protect your neighbors and those around you”.
9512,I’m masking up but I will be surprised to see more people do it “because it is the right thing to do”.
9513,&gt; Let's assume that a gigantic number of people get their shots today.
9514,Why on earth would we assume that?
9515,[removed]
9516,Some jobs don’t really allow it and others it’s frowned upon to use your sick days.

9522,"Well the fact that it doesn't share any of the spike mutations with the so-called ""escape"" variants so far is an indicator."
9523,"And also, I have no idea how you're coming to that conclusion regarding T-cell escape from those articles."
9524,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
9525,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
9526,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

9530,This is the PERFECT explanation that I’ve yet to see.
9531,Thank you so much!!
9532,!
9533,"Just got my first shot, 21 days to go!"
9534,Sound have taken their chances.
9535,Truly a fate worse than death.
9536,SMH my head.
9537,"🙏😔

^^^^/S"
9538,Nice
9539,"I know, but I can't trust everyone else to get theirs."
9540,"I have some crazy family who have never taken Covid seriously, so I'm hesitant to let my kid play with their kids."
9541,"Same at the store, where too many people don't wear masks."
9542,&gt; This Memorial Day is going to be absolutely fucking lit.
9543,Fuck yeah!
9544,4th of July is going to be off the chain too.
9545,If you’re fully vaccinated your mask is a placebo.
9546,If it makes you feel better that’s great but it’s doing nothing for your actual risk.
9547,The vaccine works.
9548,policies on work as far as you can enforce them tho.
9549,Got mine in PA with my California ID and insurance card.
9550,No problem at all
9551,That's exciting but also scary as hell.
9552,Kids are going to be spreading it like crazy.
9553,My 5 year old kindergartner is going in for his second covid test in a month due to exposure at school.
9554,"And they wear masks, try to keep distance and so on."
9555,"As more people get vaccinated, we'll be dropping a lot of those things."
9556,But kids still won't be vaccinated along with a good chunk of the population that has decided not to get it.
9557,I am though looking forward to getting my first shot today!
9558,[deleted]
9559,Lol what is the point of posting comments like these?
9560,"So many people I talk to are *terrified* to get the shot because of people saying “I FELT LIKE I WAS DYING” (like, so terrified they’re weighing whether or not it’s worth it)."
9561,"It seems like the same way people try to one-up each other about how little sleep they got or how little they studied, people love talking about how bad their Covid shot reaction was (with an emphasis on making it sound as bad as possible) and then turn around and wonder why vaccine hesitancy is so high."
9562,"On an individual level, it doesn't matter."
9563,"But collectively, it can matter a ton."
9564,I think most people would agree that double masking **outside** is completely overkill.
9565,But if you get enough people who believe that it's necessary and morally right than we start to have an issue with them pushing and asking for continued mandates.
9566,"In my state for example, one is mandated to wear a mask outdoors regardless of ability to social distance."
9567,"For example, when walking my dog in the forest."
9568,I'll never see a soul out there.
9569,But I can go to my local pub and drink unmasked.
9570,I don't want these people to fight against the loosening of that already absurd mandate.
9571,We shouldn't be ignoring those people with an out of whack risk assessment.
9572,We should be questioning them and reassuring them.
9573,Preferably with education and scientific studies.
9574,The media went *so so* hard on the fear angle that people are reluctant to look at new info.
9575,Article of 2020 Sep 18
9576,It is [exactly](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html) how vaccine efficacy works.
9577,"The vaccines are protective against severe disease and hospitalization, but not 100%."
9578,Here's [some more details](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mp5txs/coronavirus_latest_longawaited_brazilian_phase_3/gu9e48e/) on that I shared in another post.
9579,Thank you for the insight!
9580,"I honestly didn’t think about the fact that, while yes it has mutated, it still remains the same virus as a whole."
9581,Im not sure why I didn’t think about it that way.
9582,That’s some serious whataboutism
9583,"While I’d agree most who want it (probably) already got it, it’s important that there is still a pretty significant amount that didn’t, this can primarily stem from locations and access to vaccination sites, for example, where im located we have tons of pharmacies and even a FEMA site offering it with no appointment, however, most people don’t have this and are struggling to find appointments."
9584,"It would be cool if the big retail pharmacies such as CVS, Walgreens and Walmart could post daily data on how many appointments they have booked so we can get a gage on how many upcoming appointments we have and if it’s staying consistent, which I imagine it is because even in an area with a no appointment FEMA site, the pharmacies are still booked up"
9585,"And as a foil to the above comment, I had no side effects at all!"
9586,"Everyone is different for sure, so don't talk yourself into feeling crappy!"
9587,"I ordered a pizza, watched some movies, and had a lazy wonderful day of it."
9588,Hope you have the same luxury.
9589,1-2 weeks.
9590,"Pfizer suggests about 1 week, CDC says 2 as a catch all for 2-Dose."
9591,Trump's administration could've done much better in terms of setting up a better vaccine distribution system.
9592,"This needed to be a single federal system, as opposed to 50 states all implementing a solution on top of various pharmacy chains doing their own."
9593,Won't be an issue for US students.
9594,With the current rate of vaccinations within a month and a half or two months its highly likely almost everywhere in the US will have same day appointments open.
9595,Is this a Biden campaign slogan or something?
9596,Every time I see his name mentioned I see it.
9597,Serious question.
9598,Lol that's not how the virus works
9599,"Like I said I don’t care, vaccinate undocumented workers not as if they’re not here to stay."
9600,We'll end up over 60% of adults nationwide pretty easily.
9601,"New York is already at 55% of first doses and still increasing at a steady, sustained rate."
9602,My guess is we will hit a brick wall around 70% of adults nationwide with a very slow increase from there up to 75%.
9603,Some states may end up as high as 85% and some will be as low as 55-60%.
9604,States with 85%+ vaccination will probably see endemic spread elimination over time with only imported cases from other states but states at only 55-60% will likely see consistent (but low level) spread maintained.
9605,"Very strong outreach programs and ""easy access"" programs (E.g."
9606,mobile clinics showing up at places of employment or underpenetrated neighborhoods) could increase the end number.
9607,&gt;	Most americans won’t even stay home from work when they have a cold.
9608,Won’t or *can’t*?
9609,Hardly anyone loves their job that much that they’re willingly going even if they feel awful.
9610,Also as schools and employers require it as well.
9611,So would something like Tylenol be okay?
9612,I was afraid that taking medicine would not go well with the COVID vaccine

9622,"&gt; and start acting like you’re invincible

One of my issues starts with this point, as well."
9623,"Essentially, I feel kinda ""invincible"" in that after I get the vaccine, even if I do contract covid (a much rarer instance post vaccine of course), it most likely won't be serious in any way."
9624,"Theres a decent chance I might even not know I got it, due to the vaccines effect on my immune system."
9625,"So am I ""invincible""?"

9627,But it isn't about me.

9629,Or just someone who hasn't gotten vaccinated yet.
9630,"Eventually, we'll need to accept that people who are stridently anti vax are just going to have to take that risk."
9631,"But we're not at that point yet, purely numbers wise."
9632,"So, in the meantime, we mask."
9633,"Even if you *are* invincible, practically speaking."

9643,That's not the preferred method though.
9644,I agree in part.
9645,Tourist coming and getting vaccinated could happen.
9646,But undocumented workers mostly only have a passport an some don't even have that.
9647,An utility bill could work but a lot live in the same apartment so they don't really have their name on anything.

9655,"Another 3,5M people will be vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna."

9657,2M AZ doses is enough to vaccinate 1M people.
9658,"2,3+3,5+1,5+1= 8,3M (75% of the population) by the end of June."
9659,"Without AZ and J&amp;J it would be just under 6M, still around 55% of the total population in the unrealistic worst case scenario."
9660,I hope they plan to provide them as distribution isn’t equal in all areas.
9661,"Nope, because that's 25% of **adults**."
9662,They don't survey children.

9668,We probably won’t see the CDC remove indoor masking from their guidelines for a while.
9669,Obviously these are guidelines but not a requirement for states to follow.
9670,"When do you guys see the majority of states and businesses removing their indoor mask requirements and places like restaurants, movie theaters, bars and clubs will return to normal."
9671,Since we will pretty much see the return to outdoor normal very soon.
9672,This is all referring to the United States.
9673,It will be interesting on what percentage the final percentage of adults settles on.
9674,I said 60% a couple of months ago and got downvoted to hell.
9675,In NYC and NJ there are thousands of available appointments and no one taking them.
9676,And we're just at 50% now.
9677,So I think we'll be lucky to get to 60% of adults now.

9679,Sure
9680,"Try https://www.vaccinespotter.org/VA/ 

NOVA is hard but there are a few local appointments available right now."

9683,Congrats!
9684,Try months.
9685,Vaccination for myself and my friends won't be open until end the fall.
9686,Woo
9687,"Here's the Pfizer data:

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl\_file/nejmoa2034577\_appendix.pdf](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_appendix.pdf)

45% of American adults have hypertension."
9688,It's so common that it's not on the list.
9689,But the study did give the vaccine to 88 people with congestive heart failure and 194 people who have had a heart attack.
9690,I would say it’s been strict.
9691,Far more strict than most other European countries.
9692,"&gt;I suggest tying the removal of restrictions to the number of people vaccinated

Every expert has said that removing restrictions is going to be heavily dependent on how many people have gotten vaccinated and the local case counts/hospitalizations—which are affected by the vaccination rate."
9693,"There are multiple companies offering incentives to employees and patrons, although that has been controversial at least in the case of vaccine passports."
9694,The CDC has also released relaxed guidelines to people who are vaccinated but those aren’t going to matter to the people who didn’t bother with following them to keep from spreading a deadly disease.
9695,The people saying there is no reason to get vaccinated are not being honest with you or themselves since public health and the government have made it very clear getting vaccinated is our best pathway forward to normal life.
9696,Their resistance to getting vaccinated is prolonging the very things they are complaining about.
9697,"I’m all about incentivizing and making it as easy as possible for people to get vaccinated, but the messaging that restrictions will go away once enough people have been vaccinated has been crystal clear from the experts and the government."
9698,"They can’t say exactly when it will happen, because that depends on how many people get vaccinated and the rate of community spread."
9699,"If only 50% of locals get vaccinated, it’s going to take a lot longer for community spread to die down and for restrictions to go away than if 90% of locals get vaccinated (especially while under 16 can’t get vaccinated)."
9700,Considering the antivaxxers ability to jump on every single thing if it were somehow a lot more people we would know.
9701,At the beginning they were making allergic reactions a front page news story and that is not important at all.
9702,curious if they will start screaming variant and claiming that there is one that resists the vaccine completely
9703,Youyang Gu's projections helped to keep my sanity last year.
9704,"Over the summer he predicted the Sun Belt surge would peak on July 23rd, and sure enough, there were clear indicators of a downward trajectory by that date."
9705,Haha I don't think people understood with all the downvotes.
9706,There are people saying that it's over because everyone who wants one can get one now.
9707,No - realistically it's still going to be mid July before we get to over 200 million 2nd shots.
9708,Hopefully COVID numbers are smashed into the ground by then.
9709,"So I'm aware of the side effects of the 2nd pfizer shots, but does anyone know how likely it is you'll experience them?"
9710,"I'm scheduled for my 2nd this Friday, but have my law school exams the next week."
9711,Not sure if it's worth the risk
9712,You could let her know that work on these vaccines began in 2003 after the SARS outbreak
9713,Thank you Trump for starting this and thank you Joe Biden for continuing the plan!
9714,Got my fist Pfizer dose yesterday at the Philly convention center.
9715,No wait time at all but people were flowing in and out so a lot of people were getting vaccinated.
9716,"Feels pretty good that I’m now in the “people who have their first dose statistic.” On May ninth, I’ll get my second dose and be fully vaccinated, and couldn’t be more excited!"
9717,"No offense to Oxford, but they could barely handle a clinical trial for one medication."
9718,Now they are mixing vaccine types and reinfecting people.
9719,That dataset is gonna be wild!
9720,Oh cool.
9721,Doing human challenge trials.

9731,Yeah.
9732,My parents are Republicans too.
9733,"They aren’t Trumpsters, and I don’t know how much they watch Fox News."
9734,"My dad is a doctor so he was able to get vaccinated pretty early on, but my mom is refusing, and she’s convinced my sister and brother not to get vaccinated."
9735,They also believe masks don’t do anything.
9736,I don’t get it.
9737,And now my other brother got Covid last week from his roommate before he was able to get vaccinated.
9738,"Luckily, his case seems to be mild."
9739,"It’s just frustrating because one I want them to be safe, and two, I want to be able to hangout with them without worrying about them possibly having Covid and giving it to my one year old son."
9740,"Like, we’re so close to being done with this pandemic, and they’re helping drag it out."
9741,"The January peak was 1,404 deaths on the 19th."
9742,So yes essentially a 99%+ reduction in 3 months.
9743,You are going to go from 20% of the population to 70% of the population in just two months?
9744,Seriously?
9745,That's 250 million people to be vaccinated in just two months.
9746,"I find it hard to believe, as that would require you to be vaccinating much faster than the USA is currently vaccinating."
9747,There are no signs that the EU has that type of logistical capacity.
9748,"Agree 100% that we should try to get the trials done on children as quickly as possible (Pfizer is already done thankfully for 12-15 and pending approval), but 1% of kids definitely do not get hospitalized with COVID."
9749,COVID hospitalization (and death) in children is exceptionally rare.
9750,"A bad flu year is worse for the health of children than COVID, especially young children under 12."
9751,In stats you see on hospitalization rates for children that use confirmed COVID cases are going to be massively inflated because most children have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and as a consequence testing rates on kids are very low.
9752,"The sooner we have vaccines approved for 12-15 and even younger, the quicker we can reach herd immunity."
9753,I think with 12-15 year olds alone combined with good uptake in the adult population we can probably reach herd immunity without under 12s (which is great).
9754,"If vaccine hesitancy remains high in adults, we'll likely need under 12s to get there."
9755,Um pay them to
9756,"With only 7.8% of the population having one dose, how does it make sense to completely open the floodgates to all adults?"
9757,"I assume there are a lot of more vulnerable 50+ and 65+ people that haven't had the opportunity to get vaccinated yet, and now it's going to be even harder for them."
9758,This seems like purely a political move to buy some support in advance of the coming lockdown rather than a rational public health decision.
9759,Some forms are motivated by common sense legislation as a matter of public health.
9760,"Ex: seatbelt,car seat, and brake light laws."
9761,"And specifically not, in my rural Appalachian community or my rural Texas ranch community"
9762,"Need data on change in hospitalization figures by age group compared to infection rates to make this claim, not just ask some doctors about how they are seeing “more”."
9763,Getting my second shot in an two hours
9764,"It tethers your soul to your body, preventing astral projection and making you more susceptible to demonic possession."
9765,"It's true, I know because two spirit healers told me this while I was away from my body."
9766,"I wish I was joking, but this was an actual post over there."
9767,I delivered blankets to my partner and her friends on Saturday night 😅
9768,Protect the kids by getting vaccinated.
9769,I’ve been volunteering at our local health department and we are taking walk ups at this point.
9770,In our area you can find some group doing a vaccine clinic nearly every day of the week.
9771,"I am hoping the messaging transitions to ""get a vaxx dump the mask"" here in the next month or two now that everyone 16+ is eligible for a vaccine."
9772,It's almost over!
9773,You got this friend!
9774,No kid is ever forced to attend in person class.
9775,Covid or no Covid.
9776,Please show me the research where a) children are major vectors of transmissions and b) children are at risk of serious illness if they get covid.
9777,"I know you FEEL like children spread the disease, please back up with facts."
9778,Does anyone know about restrictions for non residents?
9779,"I don’t live in the state I have residency in and when I have looked before the vaccine sites often say “for [state] residents over 18...”

I really wanna get vaccinated v:

Walk into CVS and ask for it when?"
9780,They’re trying to avoid as many people as possible avoid serious disease or death.
9781,So sorry to hear that means you have to wait a few extra weeks to hit the bar.
9782,"While I completely understand the caution and hesitant messaging from the CDC, you are correct here."
9783,"I probably wouldn't go hang out with a bunch of high risk people without masks, but by the time you get your second shot, you have a very high level of immunity, enough to keep most people pretty safe."

9950,"Since the start of the pandemic, 246 Americans under the age of 17 have died of COVID."

9952,"[Source](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot)  
  
Sorry that neither the time frame nor the age range match up, those are just the numbers I could find, but considering the scope is wider in both ways for COVID than motor vehicles crashes yet the crash deaths are still 243% higher, I think the point stands."
9953,There are a lot of states with better paid sick leave than California.
9954,Actually all of the states bordering california do
9955,"On Saturday , NYS had 8300 cases and 75 deaths."

9963,"Yes PTO is necessary and some ARE in that position, but let's not pretend this is true for everyone."
9964,No it’s not.
9965,Old retirees have time on their hands to take any appointment under the sun.
9966,"Working class younger folks have to try to schedule around work, which won’t give them time off to get vaccinated."
9967,Voting is the exact same thing.
9968,"The larger point, which was made elsewhere in this thread, is that some forms of risk are specifically mitigated by common sense legislation as a matter of public health."
9969,"As an American who felt constant impending doom in 2020 due to so many national issues, it feels insanely good to watch our country not totally bungle an issue like this."
9970,"I think it's time to accept a little higher death rate at the cost of opening things up, because it is impossible to get out of hand due to the vaccinations."

10004,"So while I'll be getting the second poke in a few hours, my understanding is Im extremely unlikely to get it already following the first shot, but we don't know yet if I can carry it and give it to my grandmother or anyone else if they haven't been vaccinated yet."

10006,Absolutely.

10015,We're going to need mandates.
10016,Is this similar to the EMA's rolling review process or am I misunderstanding it?
10017,Healthcare surges aren't a danger anymore.
10018,"Michigan isn't in any danger of overwhelming its hospitals, despite the recent surge."
10019,"As for the ""society as a whole"" piece, you're imposing your ascribing your risk tolerances and preferences to everyone else."
10020,Not everyone believes that lockdowns are necessary or preferable.
10021,"And, to the point, despite all the people who said that Michigan couldn't beat the surge without a lockdown, here we are."
10022,It would be nice if people would just admit they were wrong for once.
10023,I am 90% sure the U.S executive branch is the one that makes this possible.
10024,Hence Joey getting credit for it.
10025,All of the vaccines target the spike - and further most of the immune response is targeting the RBD of the spike.
10026,You absolutely can evade all of the vaccines simultaneously.
10027,This is nothing like the HIV drugs that target multiple proteins at multiple spots which makes it unlikely to evolve mutations in those proteins simultaneously.
10028,"You fundamentally misunderstood what ""work in different ways"" for these vaccines means."
10029,You have a selective pressure on the virus in vaccinated people that doesn't exist in unvaccinated.
10030,In vaccinated the virion progeny best suited for survival are those that can evade the antibodies and t cells that person has from the vaccine.
10031,Every infected vaccinated person is a chance for the rare mutation to develop.
10032,They're more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated person.
10033,I assure you it's more likely that a mutant would out-pace our ability to vaccinate.
10034,"Yes, we can do things insanely fast now."
10035,But no where near as fast as a virus can spread.
10036,The hope I have that escape mutants won't be possible is that the RBD can only change so much before it can't bind ACE2.
10037,the fear though is several mutations that change the binding receptor(s) targeted could arrise.
10038,While I still believe we're likely not going to need boosters for variants to end this virus - if we stagnate at 50% vaccinated or something like this for a while the selective pressure concerns me.
10039,I'll get it later when there isn't a line for it.

10046,"Last time I had to go to the doctor even legitimately for an ear infection, it was like pulling teeth to even get a note then."
10047,"I want a doc who's willing to write an extra lol

Edit: for some reason it said ""to get a joke"" instead of ""note"", although thinking about it is a joke isn't it."

10073,&gt;The ability of B.1.1.298 and B.1.429 variants to evade neutralizing [humoral immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/humoral-immunity) from prior infection or vaccination has yet to be determined.
10074,And a single mutation doesn't immune escape make.
10075,"The B.1.429 variant has the L452R, and sure it may allow it perhaps escape **some** humoral immunity potentially, but that is a far cry from reinfection territory."

10081,I wasn’t really aware.
10082,I’m actually in Europe and have some friends that want to go to the US.
10083,How did your friends get to enter?
10084,(I know about the negative tests upon returning and quarantining) but it seems like people from most European countries aren’t allowed to enter unless they are married to a US citizen/ have children that are citizens.
10085,Would love to know what somebody who is willing to jump through those hoops has to do...

10097,Waiting for the train to roll over me.
10098,At this point I'm going full selfish.
10099,"I got one, you can get one."
10100,"There's no shortage, everyone can get one."
10101,If you don't have one by late June you're on your own.
10102,I was talking about national percentages.
10103,Many states are doing decent but most of those deep red southern states are lagging.
10104,The phase of nationwide pandemic will be over soon and it will move into more localized outbreaks.
10105,"for me i’m terrified of needles, but i did it."
10106,"hated it, but did it."
10107,"Still working from home, low risk."
10108,Don’t wanna do it yet.
10109,"In other words, no excuse just lazy."
10110,That don’t REQUIRE insurance.
10111,"Here unless you have your ID, insurance card, and are *at least* 18 you will not be allowed to get one unless you can make an appointment at a mass vaccine site, even then you’re still supposed to have ID but some places are smart enough not to ask for one."
10112,"&gt; kids aren't really effected from COVID

If people are in lockdown and they have more sex, then maybe kids are effected from lockdown policies."
10113,"by those who are looking our for society as a whole, and especially those that want to reduce healthcare surges."
10114,"If anything, you should continue to wear a mask in public as a normalizing signal for others to continue wearing masks and keeping people safe until they can get a vaccine."
10115,Worth noting: Neither of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) are approved nor are in use in India at the moment.
10116,The AstraZeneca stockpile is straight up unconscionable.
10117,"They're not gonna approve it, they don't need it, and even if it was approved tomorrow they're at the stage of vaccine demand that almost no one would want it."
10118,Why the fuck are they still sitting on it?
10119,I don't even mind them not exporting every other vaccine.
10120,"The country has been through a lot, the death rate was massive, and they're using those vaccines."
10121,"But hoarding vaccines you're *not* using ""just in case"" when you already have millions of vaccines in stockpile just in case (including J&amp;J)?"
10122,I don't understand how anyone is able to justify that.
10123,It literally just opened up to me and my friends at school this past weekend.
10124,Got it and slept the entire day.
10125,Three more weeks until my next dose.
10126,Can confirm.
10127,"Since I got it, it's working great."
10128,"Besides an almost certain stint with covid back in august, my sinus infection came on 15 days after my first dose."
10129,"Even *if* I had covid rn, besides an extremely low chance of catching it in the first place, wouldn’t there be none to minimal symptoms?"
10130,"I don’t have a dry cough, no loss of taste or smell, and I’m really congested (not a covid symptom)."
10131,Should i still get tested?
10132,Thank god larger corporate businesses aren't as stupid as Texan and Floridian Republicans and still require masks to be present in their shops.
10133,"It's an incredible sight to see, people being so against wearing a face covering because a once in a century virus is still among us."
10134,I'm fully back to a normal lifestyle minus the required mask wearing in certain places.
10135,I booked a trip to Orlando during Memorial Day weekend to see friend of mine down there.
10136,"Yes, tell them your name and birthdate and ask them to double-check they have your sheet, and ask them to double-check they have the right shot."

10152,Many of us who have been fully vaccinated have gotten sick of wearing masks all the time.
10153,"It's very annoying to have to keep remembering to take them with you, put them on, take them off, etc."
10154,Some people who are vaccinated who stopped wearing masks altogether outside of place that require them to enter.

10166,They would’ve undermined faith in vaccines and the CDC itself on a much larger scale if they had kept the complications under wraps for the “greater good”.

10180,"&gt;The “we just don’t know” excuse just sounds like absolute bullshit at this point

It's hard to give an exact date."
10181,"Despite vaccination efforts going swimmingly in the US, cases have still risen 30% because people have become increasingly confident in gathering despite only 40% having been vaccinated."
10182,"The US needs 75% of the entire populace to be vaccinated for herd immunity, including children."
10183,"If Fauci starts giving timelines and people start planning around them, and the timelines happen not to be accurate, people are going to start pointing the fingers and calling for his head."

10186,"Whenever I take ibuprofen or acetaminophen,  I really drowsy and mentally (numb?)"
10187,so I thought my mental fog would only get worse.
10188,"""Those without appointments should report to Gate 1 for registration and entry."""
10189,So I guess yes - you just needed to do an extra step if you didn't already have an appointment.
10190,That would be why I didn't notice.
10191,If anyone reading this plans on going - I highly recommend signing up for an appointment online even though you don't need it.
10192,It's fast and easy and I have to imagine much less of a hassle than registering there.
10193,If you PM me I’ll help you get an appointment!
10194,Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta just changed to no appointment needed and there was a line all the way down the street.
10195,I except more sites to follow suit soon.
10196,&gt; I know many people who aren't getting the vaccine because they see no point if they have to keep wearing masks and social distancing.
10197,So you know many idiots?

10205,Mine brought in a mobile clinic for the Pfizer vaccine and is doing second doses on Tuesday.
10206,Everyone who got vaccinated got $100.
10207,We need to give it more time for the other age groups.
10208,The 65+ age group has had the longest time to get vaccinated so it makes since that their rates are the highest at the moment.
10209,At least we know our hands are clean :).
10210,I do a lot of that too.
10211,Makes me feel better.
10212,"Although all 3 approved ones in the US are basically 100% protective against death or hospitalization, according to the Phase III trials, I prefer the 95% mRNA efficacy."
10213,Sit next to a sick person on a plane and you are several times more likely to get sick with J%J.
10214,I would just not want to lay in bed sick with Covid since it's still very transmissible.
10215,"Nah, you’re pro-ignorance."
10216,But glad you didn’t get a bad case of covid (assuming you don’t have long covid symptoms).
10217,Hope you didn’t infect anyone else.
10218,They still didn’t provide nearly enough information or context.
10219,Shit article.
10220,Again
10221,Death was not the concern of anyone under 40.
10222,Long term health damage was.
10223,"Regardless, summer vacation is coming and it will be a moot point as we can just let the virus run it's course in the deniers while kids are out of school."
10224,If we get the vast majority of adults herd immunity it won't be able to make it into the kids when school restarts.

10226,I think the no appointment is just getting started this week.

10228,Yeah once we've been able to get 70%+ of the population vaccinated we should be able to get back to normal with minimal issues

10230,We’ll get it higher eventually too.
10231,Too much spotlight on Pfizer and Moderna...  full speed ahead!
10232,There is a number for 0-18 so that’s what they’re using.
10233,The fact that we have the vaccines we do is attributable to the last administration as well as the current.

10244,They texted him a picture of him getting out of the hospital and he looked rail thin and looked 15 years older.
10245,He had to get a kidney removed too.
10246,He has another friend whose wife died too.
10247,"She was really young, I believe late 50s."
10248,Its just heart breaking.
10249,So yeah the vaccine might have some side effects but if you get it you can have permanent damage or worse so there's no comparison.

10337,"Washington state, for example, only opened it up to 18+ this past Thursday technically."
10338,"Now, you could book appointments if you found them as of March 31st and it would be on the honor system, but it was difficult to find appointments beyond the ad-hoc last minute ones."
10339,I know other states are similar.
10340,This means that there is likely a sizable chunk of &lt;39 and especially &lt;29 year olds who only have had the ability to make appointments in the past couple weeks.
10341,"In other words, it's not an area of concern yet but something to keep our eye on for ways to improve vaccination rates."
10342,"Also, supply is still short in some locations."
10343,"There is area of concern in [some states](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-covid-19-vaccines-administered.html) where they are not using their existing supply, but broadly speaking things are going well with vaccination rates and efforts in the states."

10360,Won't change things here in rural Missouri.
10361,Most people think it's a hoax or exaggerated.
10362,"takes alot of the edge off even though we are fully vaccinated, we still mask up but have 99% less worry."
10363,The execution of the vaccine at least from my view in downstate Springfield are has been excellent with national guarding manning a building at the State Fairgrounds and any Illinois resident can recieve the shot there thru the reservation system.
10364,"Good advice, but that's discouraging."
10365,[removed]
10366,"Whenever I get a flu shot I get flulike symptoms for a few days (similar to what people are reporting now with the COVID vaccines), which I know is just my immune system working as intended, but it’s such a hassle that I just stopped getting the flu shot and roll the dice every year."
10367,Yes.
10368,Which is why it's important to keep them up.
10369,A cold doesn't have the chance at fucking up someone's life that covid does.
10370,Why tf people keep trying to make this comparison is beyond me.
10371,There's a whole rest of my comment no one is replying to.
10372,Why isn't Fauci considered a reliable source anymore?
10373,Lol this guy has posted the same thing in multiple threads.
10374,He can’t understand why the US would vaccinate their own citizens before others.

10382,I want to clarify by conservative I mean Republican and if you vote Republican in the modern day and vote for those who voted to overturn legally cast votes  then yes.
10383,Yeah I was gonna say.
10384,"Doesn't sound Boston to me, but rather Upper Midwest/Great Lakes."
10385,"Well, I think he pointedly *said* celebrating the 4th ""with family"" or something cautious like that, but we all heard ""like 2019"" and we are likely to be good to do that, but you don't want to over-promise several months ahead of time."
10386,Why would getting a flu shot cause you to miss 2 days of work?
10387,Finally scheduled to get my first shot this Thursday and couldn’t be more excited!!
10388,!
10389,2017-2018 flu season.
10390,"Field hospitals and everything 

https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/"
10391,Thank you for citing research.
10392,I kept hearing speculation about how it was inevitable that this would foment a huge amount of distrust that would cripple uptake.
10393,"It made sense on its face, but I had been skeptical as to how much it would end up mattering."
10394,Mainly because I think I was hopeful that this would make the rounds in the anti-vax echo chamber but not really beyond that.
10395,Sounds like I was wrong.
10396,"It does, however, sound like there are existing educational inroads that need to be made that this whole snafu didn't create, but shed some light on."
10397,Hiding was not the alternative.
10398,I wish people would stop saying that.
10399,You can be upfront that an extremely rare blood clot associated with the vaccine is under investigation without pausing administration.
10400,"Hope you can make some progress moving forward, that sounds rough."
10401,I’m very hopeful that we get solid vaccination rates.
10402,It’s interesting to compare current COVID vaccinations to flu vaccinations.
10403,About 50% of individuals were vaccinated for the flue during the 2019-2020 flu season.
10404,We’re at that level now for COVID and have only just started vaccinating the adult population.
10405,"And, to my knowledge, work places aren’t offering onsite vaccinations for COVID yet either."
10406,How so?
10407,Maybe provide your own source.
10408,"And again, for the second time, you ignored the rest of my comment."
10409,Please tell me why all of a sudden Fauci isn't a reliable source.
10410,"&gt; Regardless, that leaves the rest of my comment."
10411,People are getting much too antsy to return to normal.
10412,They're ignoring experts because they seem to think that getting vaccinated means they'll never catch covid.
10413,That's a straight up dangerous mindset to have.
10414,Rare but there.
10415,The other two vaccine options in the US have no blood clotting issues and offer more protection.
10416,I don’t know why anyone would opt into JnJ over Pfizer or  Moderna.
10417,Why is it unethical for the American government to make sure Americans benefit from the vaccines before exporting them?
10418,Shouldn’t any government look out for the welfare of its own citizens first?
10419,That’s why I got all three vaccines
10420,"Wasn’t great, but had an expiring visa so had to."
10421,Pretty fucking depressed now that I’m back in Canada and honestly pretty embarrassed of my home country.
10422,Nice.
10423,"I’ve wanted a sub for a very long time, was going to buy it when I got out of the military, but I chose instead to help my wife with medical school costs and only now are we generating some surplus."
10424,"Definitely not rich, not even close, but finally comfortable."
10425,Does anyone know if states *have* to comply with Biden's April 19 mandate?
10426,"I keep seeing news everywhere that eligibility opens up for everyone tomorrow, but as far as I know Vermont out of state college students still won't be eligible."
10427,I'm just confused about how this works--was it more of a suggestion?
10428,(Sorry if you've seen me here before!)
10429,"Pfizer, AZ and Moderna, though Moderna only just started rollout."
10430,avg positivity rate last 7 days is 2.7% and available on the official data hub https://covid19ireland-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/
10431,“Lockdowned” isn’t a word.
10432,2 Johnson 2 Johnson
10433,I just told my doctor and they added it to my records.
10434,I even see it in my online vaccination records.
10435,Not sure why that isn't the best way.
10436,And me.
10437,I’m a woman in the age group that was affected by the blood clots and I got J&amp;J a couple weeks ago.
10438,"I’d do it again in a second, and I did really like it being one and done"
10439,"Meanwhile, in Michigan...."
10440,I'm not sure the risk of myocardial impact is significantly higher than what we'd see with influenza.
10441,"It's definitely possible to have severe complications with covid, but I don't think most young people see it this black and white."
10442,"I think the benefits of covid vaccination clearly outweigh possible detriments though, and I'm hoping that anyone on the fence comes around to that conclusion when it's their turn."
10443,Agreed.
10444,I told myself I wanted to get a flu shot this year (because who wants to risk COVID and flu at the same time) and never got around to it because there was never a good 2 days to miss work.
10445,"If you can’t breathe through a mask, you should go to a doctor."
10446,Pfizer/Moderna 1-shot after 2 weeks is more effective than J&amp;J.
10447,If I absolutely had to get just one shot I'd probs still get pfizer/moderna and cancel the 2nd apt.
10448,[removed]
10449,But even more people will die because of slower vaccine uptake due to the permanent PR damage J&amp;J has taken from this pause.
10450,"More people will die from the long term impacts of this pause than if we had just issued a warning saying there appears to be an extremely rare clotting issue that’s under investigation and if people under 40 want to opt for another vaccine while that investigation is happening, they may."
10451,It’s not even close.
10452,[removed]
10453,An obvious back peddle when I made the exact same point in my op?
10454,Come on you can read more than 140 characters I promise.
10455,How about overwhelmed hospitals?
10456,How does that fit in with your 'counter narrative'?
10457,"Remember, reality is that which keeps happening *even when you stop believing in it*."
10458,Stay home.
10459,Get vaccinated.
10460,Wear a mask.
10461,Don't spread false information.
10462,Johnson and Johnson 2: Electric Boogaloo
10463,Same here with the OCD.
10464,I’ve been quarantining things that don’t need to be refrigerated and washing everything else with soap and water.
10465,I’m trying to get over this by gradually decreasing the # of days I leave things quarantined and not washing certain things like fresh fruits with soap anymore.
10466,Then I handle them as a “normal” person would and force myself to sit with the anxiety I feel.
10467,"It’s part of my exposure therapy, and now that I’m fully vaccinated I feel like I actually have a chance at overcoming this stuff."
10468,I highly recommend asking a therapist about exposure therapy if you’re struggling to stop doing the compulsions on your own.
10469,"OCD sucks, and I’m sorry you’re dealing with it."
10470,"Not yet, but soon."
10471,We will be the world's biggest vaccine exporter in August.
10472,Wait and see was my approach until I never fully recovered from COVID and was desperate for relief.
10473,At this point I figure COVID’s wrecked me so any risks from the vaccine seem minimal by comparison.
10474,So what about conservatives who don't support Trump?
10475,"&gt;    I fear there will be a substantial portion among us who will struggle with the new reality of optimism and returning to normal

That's already here."
10476,It's isn't helped by people like Dr. Osterholm predicting a category 5 surge and all we got was a slight increase in cases.
10477,Same with the CDC director making it seem like we're about to enter into a dark time.
10478,The messaging has not been the best.
10479,"Instead of offering positivity with a side of caution, some people were offering negativity."
10480,Pfizer Bro!
10481,Reuters changed the headline after I posted.
10482,But it's for today.
10483,"FTA: 
&gt;""The United States had administered 209,406,814 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Sunday morning and distributed 264,505,725 doses, the CDC said on Sunday."""
10484,Sorry but half the patient load for serious cases can probably be prevented if healthcare access were readily available for them.
10485,So there are ways to help prevent people getting ill by initiative alone.
10486,You obviously can't save people from themselves and certain conditions/diseases but there are other ways this manifests.
10487,I say this as a healthcare worker myself.
10488,lordnecro's immune system: Not this shit again!
10489,Bruh.
10490,80 weeks is the norm in the US for Doctors in residency programs...
10491,Do you think people enjoy mask mandates?
10492,Do you think politicians enjoy them?
10493,Youth is wasted on the young
10494,Politics is only one piece of the puzzle.
10495,It seems like age is an equal if not larger factor.
10496,Young people have been being told for a year now that they're not really at much risk.
10497,"In my anecdotal experience, the majority of them have been doing whatever the hell they want for many months now, generally pretty free of consequence."
10498,"They probably just don't see much/any reason to get vaccinated, and that's probably a stronger influence than any politics."
10499,"Meanwhile, old people have the motivation of ""I don't want to die"" (pretty much the single strongest motivation there is) which can pretty easily override any political affiliation you might have."
10500,Also it's probably worth pointing out that conservatives aren't united on this at all.
10501,"It's really just Fox News running anti-vax segments, and meanwhile every conservative politician/leader is vaccinated and Donald Trump has stated directly, publicly, and repeatedly that everyone should get the vaccine."
10502,So there's a lot of breathing room for even a pretty staunch conservative to get the shot without feeling bad about it.
10503,In my state people know to apply to getting vaccines in red areas cause they know they'll instantly get a vaccine cause no one wants vaccines there... That's half of my state.
10504,So yeah I would not be surprised if we only get 20% more and then 30% of the USA just goes anti vaxx until a year from now when they are certain that nothing bad is happening from the vaccine.
10505,[removed]
10506,"I like how when it's convenient, Palestine is part of Israel."
10507,"When it's not, it should be a free country (and Jerusalem is theirs too)."
10508,A friends random thought was there might be a large variation in the amount of antigen produced by the mRNA vaccines.
10509,On top of that variation in how worked up the immune system gets.
10510,"One friend, 50 years old, no reaction to either shot."
10511,"Friends 19 year old daughter, in bed for three days."
10512,Most of my friends says their arm was sore and they felt icky the day after the second shot.
10513,1 month max.
10514,In the NYC area we’re already at the point where I can schedule an appointment for the same day pretty easily
10515,Literally yes!
10516,But a vanishingly tiny one.
10517,It's not that people want FL to fail.
10518,"It's that during a time when many state governments were relying on lockdowns and mask mandates to keep case counts down, people used Florida as an example to tell people that taking covid so seriously wasn't necessary."
10519,So it drives people crazy that Florida never felt the consequences that other states who were similarly lax felt.
10520,"We were all trying to save our skins here, and a bunch of jerks on Twitter were like ""BUT FLORIDA"" over and over again, and no amount of pointing out how well-suited Florida was to survive something like this could convince them that it wasn't so good an example for the rest of the country to follow."
10521,"Basically, anyone on social media who wanted their state to be careful about covid is damn tired of hearing about Florida."
10522,Just do what you want.
10523,In Canada it's bad but like 40% of people wear it outside.
10524,They don't get offended if I don't.

10530,They’d better
10531,I feel like vaccine hesitant people wouldn’t go for a Russian vaccine.
10532,If an mRNA vaccine got approved for a single dose that might be the best best.
10533,Ok but Sinovac is really bad in actually giving any kind of protection by itself.
10534,"Similar with me and Moderna, only sooner."
10535,"6 hours after started to feel tired

12 hours in fever throughout the night will chills and splitting headache."
10536,"Fever ranged from 100-102, didn't take anything because there is some speculation that acetaminophen hinders the immune response."
10537,"decided to play it safe, but it was a rough night."
10538,"Took 500 mg acetaminophen at the 24 hour point, cause I figured, at that point, I hedged my bets."
10539,Didn't feel properly normal until a full 48 hours after 2nd dose.
10540,I’d recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/K3odScka55A) about why the effectiveness rates can’t be easily compared.
10541,It helped change my thoughts on the J&amp;J vaccine.
10542,1-3 percent of athletes get myocarditis.
10543,"Yes, they'll probably be fine, but the odds are remarkably high (1 in 100) that they could develop illness lasting longer than a month."
10544,"They won't die, but it's possible to get very sick."
10545,I hope everything is open in the US by the time I get there this year 😁
10546,Problems with this statement or mentality is two major reasons.
10547,1.
10548,No one/not many people are lining up to be healthcare workers and the few that do often have misconceptions about what their work is actually like in the field and the schools often do a terrible job preparing you for what it's actually like.
10549,2.
10550,"Even if there were enough workers signing up and interested for the field, the lay needs to be higher and that's not happening any time soon."
10551,"While I agree minimum wage should be raised, full time CNAs who are delegated a lot of the simpler tasks/labor work like cleaning piss and shit barely get paid over $15/hr, some places they actually get paid less than that."
10552,"Why would anyone wanna care for patients and deal with shit, piss, abuse, risk to their safety from agitated patients, death, etc when they have the potential to make more working shorter hours at a much easier, in relative terms, job such as retail or customer service?"
10553,A 3rd problem is hospitals simply not hiring and pushing currently employed staff past beyond safe staff to patient ratio and the currently overworked staff being punished for not having the time to satisfy patients in a customer service type of quality.
10554,Is no one actually reading the article?
10555,I had no idea what you were talking about until I reread what actually posted... thanks.
10556,Fixed.
10557,I did not.
10558,I got Pfizer and I am still here with a pretty high antibody count.
10559,The problem here isn't mRNA vaccines vs adenovirus vaccines but Sinovac vs literaly any others vaccines.
10560,Even the chinese health autorities were pretty disappointed in how little this vaccine actually cover from covid.
10561,This unelected official is following [state law](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtftnb/as_mask_mandates_end_oregon_bucks_trend_with/gv0fwy9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) that’s intended to curb their power to make these changes unilaterally.
10562,"There are three options under the law:
1) allow the mask mandate to expire on May 4
2) go through regular OSHA rulemaking as required by law to keep the mask mandate longer."
10563,3) have the state official break the law and unilaterally extend their emergency powers in keeping the mandate (and certainly lose a court battle in the process).
10564,"If you want to keep the mask mandate even a day longer than May 4, your options are 2 or 3."
10565,"This official you’re mad at is going with number 2, the legal remedy."
10566,"If people don’t like it, all those angry legislators quoted in the article could change the statute."

10587,"Maybe for short term, but even Pfizer is concerned that first dose immunity may only last a few weeks."
10588,"Problem is, they just don't know."
10589,What all vaccines are being distributed in UK right now?
10590,You got your pet vaccinated?
10591,"Yes, it’s been stable after going down slightly after the Thanksgiving and Christmas surge: https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/ ~200k tests per day."
10592,How did you make it out of the country?
10593,Sounds like absolute hell to leave that island.
10594,They land but its rare to be spread by surface transmission because not enough of the virus is present to cause infection by touching a contaminated surface.
10595,Also breathing the particles into your lungs is much different then if you get it in your mouth/eyes by touching your mouth.
10596,The science is pretty clear that surface transmission is rare or even non existent.

10598,"People always complain that California is awful and that people are leaving it, yet they’ve been doing the best job at taking care of their people during the pandemic."

10648,My state is considering a permanent mask mandate and is reopening much slower than other states.
10649,I could see normal coming in October or so for a lot of states.
10650,Look for Tuesday's number.
10651,Monday's numbers are always higher because of reporting backlogs.
10652,"If on Tuesday - Friday the numbers remain this low, then yes, we're  celebrating responsibly, physically distanced, with masks on."
10653,But I'll give you a nice and hearty handshake (and a squirt of sanitizer afterwards).
10654,They were definitely inside too.
10655,But mostly they had a lot of face to face hugging and kissing and such.
10656,You stoned?
10657,"2-3 weeks after this point, cases go down based on UK and Israeli data."
10658,Huge milestone.
10659,I had those as well but only for a week or so.
10660,"Apart from that and the mild nausea it gives me, it was the right choice for me."
10661,"I normally put ~15000 miles on my car every year, in the last 16 months I've barely put 10k on it."
10662,"Based on CDC data,10% of cases in the US are of kids aged 5-17."
10663,"That said, the death rate is really low."
10664,Impressive
10665,There are going to be a lot of “US is a cesspool” Eurotrash who are gonna be getting our leftover vaccines soon.
10666,"You’re welcome, guys."
10667,That even slightly lower than San Francisco county.
10668,We've been hover with an average of 0.9-1.0% for a while now.
10669,Every health post here in Brazil has free condoms.
10670,Same applies to metro stations.
10671,They are just free for you to take
10672,"I think a lot of people will, but only a noticeable amount."
10673,People still generally do not cover their mouth when they cough.
10674,"Hello, Mr. Palestine, ISNT_A_ROBOT told me to ask you about your vax rates, please tell me."
10675,And yet the political parent comment stays because it's pro left in a pro left sub.
10676,Great moderating.
10677,I'd probably go with the Israeli government here.
10678,"Ok, there are no documented cases as far as I am aware."
10679,Clearly it is not impossible but practically unheard of.
10680,It's almost like vaccines work or something
10681,Fk you guys.
10682,I'm the one telling the truth here and you guys are all voting me down.
10683,"In Oregon, the seniors in nursing homes went first before the teachers."
10684,"But the teachers were allowed to get their shots before the seniors who live in their own homes, not nursing homes."
10685,Fking gaslighters.
10686,it is actually exactly the same kind of clots
10687,No more so than you own your credit card company.
10688,"I don't think that's normal, I would consider calling your doctor."
10689,FWIW my symptoms subsided after 24hrs.
10690,In 2 months?
10691,Really?
10692,This subreddit has really turned to shit.
10693,[removed]
10694,It's likely not helping when it's still recommended to wear masks and social distance even after being vaccinated.
10695,Argentina didn't signed a deal with Pfizer.
10696,That's Argentina fault.
10697,J&amp;J was the least effective.
10698,Like 65%.
10699,That means only 2 in 3 will work.
10700,Pfizer being over 90%.
10701,Idk why adults still cry over getting shots.
10702,"Get the Pfizer 2 shots, quit being a baby, and continue on with your life."
10703,Yes.. Half measures.
10704,At first this was my reaction too.
10705,Over the week I’ve honestly come to the belief that this will not have changed the opinion of people who were already anti-vax.
10706,It will also not change the opinion of those who were already looking to get jabbed.
10707,"The only people it will affect will be people who were on the fence, and even then I think it could be an even split between which side of the fence this has pushed them toward."
10708,Some will feel reassured that severe adverse reactions recurved such a swift response and investigation and some will feel it’s enough evidence that vaccines are too dangerous.
10709,Ignoring these incident would have been even worse.
10710,How does this not show you that Israel equals competent governance while Palestine proves why it isn't recognized as a state?
10711,I agree.
10712,"If I went on a gaming subreddit -- fortnite, for example -- and shit all over the game, talked about how stupid it was, and how players were stupid, I'd get banned immediately by the mods."
10713,"But for some reason, mods here encourage users to crap all over discussion about *social* mitigation techniques to combat Covid: social distancing is stupid, wearing masks is stupid, kids can't get sick, people that are skittish about attempts to open too early are fools, etc, etc."
10714,"In other words, I can't understand the motivations of people that hang out in a coronavirus subreddit and spend all their energies trash talking other people's concerns."
10715,"Actually, I do understand it, but only when seen through a very narrow lens."
10716,I think a lot of people have just experienced genuine medical trauma over the last year and are dealing with the mental fallout of that (whether they realize it or not).
10717,"If you're in high school right now trying to decide between careers, I would highly recommend looking into becoming a therapist."

10722,What do you mean?
10723,Bhutan doesn't produce oil.
10724,I got kicked off the voter list every election and had to reregister every time.
10725,"I actually called about it and spoke to a woman that pretty much said ""that's the way we do it... if you don't like it don't vote""."
10726,Ford appeared to start strong and was seeing quite a bit of credit for it.
10727,"Along the way, things shifted and Ford sought to politicize the issue by blaming the feds for underperforming and 'begging' Biden for support."
10728,"Meanwhile, funds put in place federally went unused, alongside a complete dismissal of science provided to him (and now you're airlifting covid patients elsewhere)."
10729,"Then, first vaccine sites were located to the most affluent, super convenient, and police were cc'd on new 'traffic interactions'."
10730,"BC has made it's share of mistakes, especially around quarantine tracing and school measures, and Horgan having a 'get off my lawn' moment."
10731,Nothing happening here approaches the circus you're defending.
10732,"Still struggling to get an appointment, but soon"
10733,What about Argentina?
10734,"In case anyone like me was wondering if there would be restrictions, this is all the article has to say:

&gt;Fauci, who is President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said he believed that federal regulators could bring the shots back with restrictions based on age or gender or with a blanket warning, so that it is administered in a way ""a little bit different than we were before the pause."""
10735,"Make sure she’s vaccinated as well, it will protect you from being hospitalized but you’ll still be able to catch it so the more the better"
10736,Here’s the issue.
10737,Fauci is doing what he is paid to do and deliver the truth about where we are and what he thinks needs to be done as a public health expert.
10738,What I remain frustrated at are idiots like Jim Jordan who think Fauci is the one who somehow makes every political decision about masks and restrictions in this country.
10739,"I fully agree, mask mandates need to end when cases and hospitalizations are low, and I wish Fauci would give an estimate instead of just fucking around all the time, but he is in such a hard position."
10740,But it’s actually named after a Belgian
10741,"Same here, 500mg acetaminophen has helped a bit but this definitely feels worse than when I caught covid."
10742,"Yeah and the turn out is pretty great, 81% of the US population over 65 has at least one dose, and 66% fully vaccinated, and that's fantastic."
10743,Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp; Janssen
10744,We're getting closer to a virtually complete vaccination effort for vulnerable populations.
10745,"I think apathy is going to be a bigger problem than hesitancy in populations that aren't at major risk ^(Yes you can still get sick, we all know) and I think that enforcing masks and restrictions on vaccinated individuals who aren't getting sick or spreading the virus enforces that apathy."
10746,"Some kind of a change could pick away at that apathy, and I hope Fauci, Biden, and the CDC realize that."
10747,"If you want people to get vaccinated, you can't act like it means masks and distancing forever."
10748,"They need an actual reason to get it, and a return to normal is a fantastic one."
10749,Influenza A is at least!

10751,I don't think that's the accurate way to phrase it.
10752,"You can get Covid outside, it's just reduced transmission outdoors."
10753,"That’s sad, just really sad."
10754,There is a real possibility that we will never have heard immunity.
10755,Let the intelligent people that have been waiting their turn get a shot before we worry about the fools trying to prove darwin right.
10756,It’s literally in my OP.
10757,This!
10758,My buddy who is a bartender helps all the old regulars get appointments.
10759,He must have reserved a dozen appointments at this point.
10760,The barman with the best shots in Queens!
10761,You made a claim.
10762,"The burden of proof is on you

&gt;	And again, for the second time, you ignored the rest of my comment

The rest of your comment wasn’t relevant to the point in contention 

&gt;	Please tell me why all of a sudden Fauci isn’t a reliable source

First of all, you’re mischaracterizing what he has said on this topic by the pretense that he supports your assertion."
10763,"Second, this is an appeal to authority, a type of logical fallacy."
10764,"Third, a source is a work you can cite, not the author of it and certainly not just a person whose statements you can mischaracterize to mean what you claim."
10765,"Fourth, press conferences serve a vital function in democratic oversight of public agencies, but they’re not how scientific consensus is established precisely because the medium lends itself to statements that present certainty where none exists."
10766,Off-the cuff statements or answers to questions from reporters on scientific questions can form a baseline to form an understanding from but should not determine an irrefutable stance you must defend even when new information emerges that contradicts it
10767,Joined this club last Monday with my first Pfizer dose in CT.
10768,"Nothing but a sore arm, and the beginning of a little relief."
10769,"Joining the two shot club on may 4, and looking forward to giving my family a goddamn hug for the first time since this time last year."
10770,"That's what I thought, and it makes sense."
10771,I friend of mine flew to California from the Philippines to get the Pfizer shot.
10772,Waiting for her second shot then flying back home.
10773,"We as a society have given people jack shit support, so I don’t know where you are getting “decades of support.” Our government funds corn, beef, and dairy farmers, not vegetables."
10774,School lunches are crap and poor kids depend on them.
10775,We don’t subsidize gyms or fitness classes or childcare to allow workers to exercise.
10776,We don’t fund sports in poor neighborhoods to encourage kids to move.
10777,People are set up from childhood to fail.
10778,And I agree that covid doesn’t care why you’re overweight.
10779,My frustration is that you sitting here going “well they’re lazy” doesn’t help at all; having some compassion and brainstorming real solutions might.
10780,I have friends too embarrassed to even try exercising or go to a doctor because they fear everyone sees them as a lazy slob.
10781,You’re basically proving their fears correct.
10782,It amazes me that in this day and age people are still willing to make excuses for slavery.
10783,Not going to work is nothing compared to having your freedom and movements forcefully restricted.
10784,"I agree, and I say this as someone who had it 🤷‍♂️"
10785,I can't find a place to get my vaccine and my appointment was cancelled.
10786,😰
10787,&gt; 1 dead of almost 7 million vaccinated is less deadly than almost everything we do every day.
10788,That was never the issue.
10789,It's the idea of introducing yet another way to die.
10790,We don't want to do that.
10791,What they did made sense.
10792,In the Netherlands.
10793,"The vaccine was developed in Leiden, a dutch city."
10794,This post appears to be about vaccines.

10798,"Doctors accept terrible residency terms because of Match, not debt."
10799,"Residency match makes it, so residents only have one job offer and have to sign that contract."
10800,"Because of this, residency packages do not have to be that competitive and allows hospitals only to use medicare funding instead add in additional funds to resident salary from their profits."
10801,Google residency match illegal to find the lawsuit where they admitted to collusion and suppressing wages but got congress to make them exempt from antitrust laws.
10802,And apparently J&amp;J was made the old fashioned way where the others used new technology?
10803,"My parents took JJ because they trusted it better being done the ""old"" way."
10804,Because j&amp;j is 100% effective against death and severe disease.
10805,I seeked out J&amp;J.
10806,1 shot and done.
10807,I also had covid in December
10808,The fact that 40 states are still at a Rt of 1.00 or higher (according to [Covid act now](https://covidactnow.org/?s=1761682)) despite this level of vaccination out there is pretty vexing to me.
10809,"I've been optimistic about the end coming soon but I don't understand how we can have 50% vaccinated (even one dose is like 85% protection or whatever) combined with our massive level of natural immunity, and we still can't get the Rt down below 1 almost anywhere."
10810,"Yup, very tired for about a day and a half after the first Moderna shot."
10811,It's not a mandate.
10812,"It was a goal to have vaccines available for everyone by May 5th, and then when every single state had set their individual goals by April 19th, Biden started saying that that moment was now the 19th."
10813,I don't think anyone's paying too close attention to the edge cases like out of state college students.
10814,"I think total hours is honestly the worst problem, although I’d argue that decisions I make on hour 28 are not as good as decisions I make on hour 2."

10816,Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings.
10817,"Sorry, that's not how I meant it.. And no, I'm in the US in Maryland.. To pre-register for my area they had you go to your county's health department site and register that way."
10818,In the options it asks what vaccine will you not accept.. they then texted me with a site and date.
10819,And thank you 😊
10820,I’m willing to do it out of politeness to those still waiting for their appointments.
10821,Ready to be out and about without one by the summer though.
10822,Huge
10823,I feel like I'm more optimistic than most for herd immunity.
10824,"*Kids are less likely to get and spread the disease so it's okay that they won't be vaccinated for a little while, it's basically like a small portion of them are vaccinated already."
10825,"*Anti-vaxxers tend to be the types of people willing to take risks with Covid like not wearing a mask or meeting in small groups indoors, so they are more likely to...get Covid."
10826,"And thus be ""vaccinated"" the hard way."
10827,The fact that we got to 80% in the older age groups who have had the time to sign up also makes me optimistic.
10828,I hate to say that you are correct.
10829,I'M DOING MY PART!!
10830,!
10831,"The media has a financial interest in keeping people scared, frightened and in their homes."
10832,Clicks and ratings were an all-time high in 2020.
10833,The media will not willingly just let that end.
10834,Interesting point of view.
10835,Thanks for the convo.
10836,"No, they didn’t."
10837,Maybe you don’t understand the difference between a general budget and a covid bill.
10838,"Residents don’t get paid more for working more hours, it’s a salaried job."

- woke up the day after (12 hour mark) with chills, fever of 100.6, very weak, awful headache

- fever got to 102.6 at like the 18 hour mark, took Tylenol at the 20 hour mark."
11239,Headache and chills stayed all day.
11240,Slept all day.

11245,"That’s what the bridging study does, a smaller study to demonstrate antibody production in previously vaccinated participants."
11246,If you have a problem with vector immunity the bridging study will absolutely show a lack of antibody production.
11247,You don’t need a full ph3 for a modified booster vectored or not.
11248,Personally I think it’s just the variant we in CA experienced in the winter moving East.
11249,We were the worst then.
11250,Good idea!
11251,Booster from someone else for broader coverage might actually make sense.
11252,This it’s just not apples to apples.
11253,They also used different criteria and had different end point goals.
11254,Also they had more diversity in their clinical trial participants.
11255,And most importantly their phase 3 was at the height of the pandemic.
11256,Interesting to me as well was J&amp;J actually still had slightly better effectiveness against severe.
11257,And most importantly 0 hospitalizations from COVID in the vaccine group.

11260,I'm not shocked.

11263,Genocide is targeted at specific groups within a population.
11264,Everyone is affected by the pandemic.
11265,Someone said they have a centralized appointment system.
11266,Similar to new Mexico who was utilizing 90%+ of their vaccines for the longest time.
11267,Meaning it's quick and easy to get an appointment ever since they went to 16+
11268,We just passed 50% at least one shot.
11269,So things are going to keep getting better until we plateau.

11276,"I think it has to do with the immune response from the vaccine, and people with stronger immune systems actually feel worse because there body is responding to the shot more aggressively than someone older with a weaker immune system."
11277,"That’s just my guess, I don’t have any real data to back it up but that’s how I make sense of it in my head at least"
11278,They advised not to take ibuprofen and only take Tylenol during my vaccine.

11299,Right but the flu doesn't seem to spread as fast or kill like covid.
11300,So a new variant that evades the vaccine will just put us back to like the beginning of covid i think.
11301,&gt; Literally just had my first pfizer vaccine and am sitting in the waiting area reading this.

That's fantastic!"
11303,How did you feel after the vaccine?
11304,If you are in the US try vaccinespotter.org it’s really easy to use.

11308,If you are in the US try vaccinespotter.org it’s really easy to use.
11309,That’s how I found mine.
11310,I think there are a couple of reasons why.
11311,"Firstly, I think that while it took a bit to get the infrastructure to administer the shots in place, once things were up and running it's been pretty smooth, for the most part."
11312,I also think there is a lot of demand here (which is possibly due to demographics).
11313,So people are eager to get their shots and appointments fill up and we're able to get doses in arms.
11314,I think the export ban should be lifted once enough Americans have had the first dose.
11315,It’s time to help saving the vulnérables in other hard hit countries.
11316,"I’m all about keeping J&amp;J going, but I don’t necessarily think cdc did anything wrong."

11331,"we will be immunized, its just going to take longer."
11332,Enough pfizer is coming at the end of the year to cover everyone under 50.
11333,AZ is being used for the over 50s.
11334,"If you are under 50 you can still consent to the AZ jab, but its not recommended, and its a talk you should have with your doctor."
11335,Omg I was about to type the exact same thing!
11336,Are you IN HERE right now!?!?!
11337,?
11338,Ohh ok.
11339,I'm just thinking about when covid first started.
11340,It arrived in North America and before we knew it it was spreading like wildfire.
11341,Dont want that to happen to a bad variant.
11342,you've politicized safety.
11343,you live in a damaged mental state
11344,Less deadly than most everything we do?
11345,Less deadly than driving?
11346,"Just like this virus, neat."
11347,Yep!
11348,That was my first though.
11349,I felt pretty crappy.
11350,"But, not nearly as crappy if I would have had to be ventilated.."
11351,It's still creeping up in those categories at a pace of about 0.3% per day.
11352,I would expect something like 85% of seniors to eventually get it.
11353,People love letting their anxiety override their minds in these situations.
11354,I’m just like “don’t worry you’re more likely to die on the way there than die from this”
11355,You won't hear me disagreeing that people (and myself...) should get more exercise (in general terms).
11356,it probably does wonders for overall health and helps keep us mobile as we age and subsequently stave off other issues as well.
11357,Also good for mental health adn who knows what else.
11358,I mostly am mostly hating on bad science journalism but this is an interesting subject and I will try to explain what I am driving at around causation.
11359,It reads like just another wine study - COVID edition.
11360,"I am willing to be that their is also a positive correlation between COVID survivability and Bordeaux consumption, but only because people who can afford Bordeaux can afford proper health care and people look after them if they get ill."
11361,It would have nothing to do with the wine per say.
11362,The Spanish flu is a good example of a disease that killed healthy young people.
11363,Health does not necessarily dictate survivability but generally there is a correlation in most cases.
11364,And maybe it is good for COVID but I just wouldn't say based off of anything I read in this article.
11365,My opinion of their reasoning was brought very low by the vague comments about cancer they also made (part of why I called those out).
11366,You should really get your pet fixed.
11367,What would Bob Barker think?
11368,Sorry I'm leaving
11369,I like your optimistic way of viewing it compared to me!

11371,"&gt; *""The state is reporting an average of 1,661 new cases a day, up by 18 percent in the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database."
11372,Hospitalizations have climbed by 19 percent in the same time period.
11373,"Deaths from the virus, which tend to lag behind infections for several weeks, have slightly increased."
11374,"""*"
11375,The response to coronavirus*
11376,My employer does weekly saliva tests and we've been told they will go on for the foreseeable future.
11377,Because it takes 2 weeks to build immunity and we’re mostly getting the groups most responsible for hospitalizations and deaths not spread.
11378,It seems likely that by Memorial Day most states will have hit whatever their final peak is and it might take 4-6 weeks after that but there should be steady decline.
11379,"That estimate is based on when we’ll hit 50% total population (not just adult) and 70% adult first dose, as well as assuming near or before that date Pfizer gets approved for 12-16 and we should have Novovax permanently ending any supply constraints."
11380,No it isn’t that’s completely false.
11381,Nope.
11382,You are wrong.
11383,Here’s an actual doctor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W57Q_kS4b9M&amp;feature=youtu.be
11384,"I think the point was  it isn't fair to call someone ""braindead"" for taking medical advice from their doctor."
11385,100% this!!!!!!!!
11386,Plenty of empty hotels in the U.S. right now.
11387,"Fly over, get vaccinated as soon as you land."
11388,Spend three weeks in the U.S.  Get your second shot as you are heading out.
11389,Or get the J&amp;J and spend two weeks then head back.
11390,Sorry but maybe it's better not to grieve when such people die?
11391,Sounds harsh but such extreme foolishness will come with a price.
11392,Extremely sorry if someone in your family is like that.
11393,I understand how painful it must be to watch someone kill themselves like that.
11394,Why can't people with the full vaccine walk around without a mask at like school or something?

11403,But even 1 shot after 50 days is so so so much better than no shot at all.
11404,Just want to take this opportunity to point out that Canada sucks.
11405,These are specific instances which are a little suspect.
11406,India seems to have a very high case number but a low death count comparatively

11410,Absolutely 0 reaction to the 1st shot except the sore arm.
11411,"I heard folks having much milder reactions to the 2nd shot compared to mine, so you never know."
11412,"I hope yours will not be as intense as mine, considering your work situation."
11413,Yeah I think 55-60% is generous.
11414,I actually think a good 10-15% more will take it eventually (like by the end of the year).
11415,I know multiple people who got the virus in January and February and were told by the drs to wait at least 8-12 weeks before they get theirs.
11416,"And as more and more people are getting it, I'm seeing people who were posting months ago about ""not getting the vaccine until"" taking it."
11417,"For the second point, would that be a significant chronic immunosuppression, like HIV?"
11418,If it’s so stupid obvious then why can’t he say what metrics he has in mind for lifting restrictions
11419,Will be increasing that 1.7% tomorrow!
11420,WINDMILL YOUR ARM FOR A FEW AFTER THE SHOT YOU WONT REGRET IT
11421,"So nice to hear a fellow Canadian actually being positive about it

On Reddit there's this bizarre relentless negative vibe while every few weeks we're getting news that deliveries are being exceeded and targets are being moved forward—we went from everyone over 18 getting a dose before the end of the year to everyone over 16 by the end of September, then the start of September, then some time in summer, now some time in June, with enough doses coming for everyone's second dose by the start of July (50M 2-dose vaccines, 300K J&amp;J at the end of April with larger orders coming within the quarter, plus we'll start getting  US shipments in June—if not the end of May)"
11422,"Not OP, but my first Pfizer just gave me a sore arm for a few days"
11423,The U.S. may restart J&amp;J vaccines by this Friday.
11424,"Personally I hope with we see busloads of Canadians wearing N95 masks, face shields and gloves coming down to get vaccinated."
11425,"Hell, better yet, require anyone crossing over a U.S. land border to be vaccinated and vaccinate on the spot if they can't show proof of vaccination."
11426,"Vaccinate, baby!"
11427,Vaccinate!
11428,The real reason not to do that is because not wearing a mask helps to normalize not wearing a mask.
11429,"If a lot of fully vaccinated people stopped wearing masks, unvaccinated people would see that and stop wearing masks too, even though not everyone who wants a vaccine has had a chance to get one yet."
11430,"So the unvaccinated, maskless people (who blend in with maskless, vaccinated people) would infect masked unvaccinated people who were waiting for their turn."
11431,"Once everyone has had a chance to get the vaccine all of the masks can come off, but until then, we risk losing control of this thing so close to the finish line."
11432,Isn’t that a massive generalisation?
11433,"This is literally what he said in the article, ""Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday said at a conference the current vaccines ""don't have very high rates of protection""."""
11434,This strategy worked perfectly for me.
11435,"Got my shot the very first day it was available to my age group, just had to drive ~1hr to a red area of my state."
11436,I skimmed through some scientific articles that were suggesting that people who had previous viral exposure had stronger vaccine reactions.
11437,Needs more research but there was some correlation.
11438,"Well you get all of them, you’ll be invincible"
11439,India has a lot of cases but a very low death rate
11440,I got sicker from the vaccine than I ever have from the flu.
11441,Still worth it so I don't spread covid though.
11442,It kicked mine too.
11443,Sickest I’ve ever felt which I guess I should feel lucky to be able to say that.
11444,[deleted]
11445,I'd to rather the ability to leave the country and get back and expedite vaccines than being told it might take two years to get vaccinated and sit imprisoned on an island unable to see my family.
11446,According to China’s CDC it is not a very effective vaccine.
11447,A conclusion backed up by the data released by Brazil.
11448,"Nobody really cares, man"
11449,odds being struck by lightning are higher
11450,Yeah but schools and employers my mandate it as insurance will definitely be charging you more if you don’t get the vaccine like they do with smoking.
11451,Once they are FDA approved we will probably hear more of certain companies requiring it.

11472,Most of them had to go through stuff like the polio vaccine.
11473,I found that reminding them of that helped a bunch in convincing some people to get this one.
11474,Also India gave it all of its doses
11475,We also have to deal with local variation of vaccination rates.
11476,Have you seen [the maps that show the Deep South tracking well behind](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) in in percentage of people vaccinated?
11477,Some states are over 60% for 18+ while some states still haven't reached 40%.
11478,I signed up a dozen elderly and the reality is that there is enough vaccine to get what you want.
11479,Everyone wanted mRNA and that's about all they had here anyway.
11480,One showed up and was offered JJ.
11481,Passed on it and got mRNA the following day.
11482,[removed]
11483,Interesting they were infected 45 days before showing symptoms.
11484,That seems well outside the normal distribution between infection to symptoms (11.5 days is usually the max with a 97.5 confidence interval).
11485,"45 days just seems very unlikely, especially with 3 people, who also ended up dying."
11486,"Yeah the flu jab doesn’t need it, but in the UK we should be moving to other, newer vaccines soon which are better against variants"

11537,Why cant the government just move doses from hillbillyville to Chicago metro area?
11538,"Well, if you’ve decided when it’s safe I guess that settles it."
11539,National effort on Reddit?
11540,That sounds a bit ridiculous.
11541,"Personally I’ve seen a lot of anti AZ posts purely on the basis of what’s been in the news or journals about it, as I’m sure you know its reputation has been put through the wringer lately."
11542,"Whether it means much or not, you have to get it pretty much perfect with these types of vaccines"
11543,[deleted]
11544,Because who is vaccinated is different.
11545,"Most of those vaccinated are above 50, but people below 50 are also going out in force."
11546,"Also, a huge chunk of that 50 percent only got their first dose in the last 2 weeks."
11547,Plus most COVID cases are not diagnosed until 4-10 days after infection.
11548,You kind of have to work backwards to see how long you'll have to wait to see impact of vaccinations on statistics: a first dose today is 80 percent protection in 2 weeks which is prevention of a case in 3 weeks which is a prevention of a hospitalization in 4-5 weeks and a death in 8 weeks.
11549,Also remember R0 is a measure of spread.
11550,"If the infection rate is very low, but rises some, R0 will still be greater than 1."
11551,"So just let them fend for themselves then, right?"
11552,"right, but that only makes telling “fully vaccinated people” no masks required all the more complicated."
11553,what constitutes fully vaccinated?
11554,To get old and healthy.
11555,Covid can kill you regardless of age.
11556,It’s because the US Census does not have a number for 16-18 year olds so we don’t actually know precisely how many of them there are.
11557,"It's not literally what he said though, is it?"
11558,He said it in Chinese and it was translated by an interpreter.
11559,"The statement seems objectively false, though."
11560,"Coronavac may be the worst vaccine we had but it was still 100% protective in the trials, and real world data so far more or less backs that up."
11561,Yeah.
11562,At my dads business like 13/50 or so people said they wouldn’t get it.
11563,So far four of those people have gotten at least one shot lol.
11564,"Israel cares more about restrictions and enforcing them, though."
11565,America has practically no restrictions at this point in many states.
11566,I don't get it???
11567,They were infected by blood clots before taking the vaccine?
11568,Unless of course you’re a Palestinian living in the occupied territories.
11569,Let’s stop congratulating Israel on the “amazing” job they’ve done and start recognizing they have much more work to do.
11570,4 months ago the first person to get their COVID shot after approval had only done so 3 days before.
11571,I knew no one who had theirs even though I have multiple family members that work in the ERs and in ICU.
11572,My brother called saying he'd be one day later than anticipated for Christmas because they were getting vaccines in and his hospital needed him to go ahead and get the shot.
11573,Now?
11574,My whole church except the kids and 1 27 year old who had COVID in late February and has been advised not to get it for another few weeks is 10+ days past their 2nd one.
11575,"My office staff have all been vaccinated, albeit there are only 7 of us."
11576,All the teachers and daycare workers in my county (well the ones that got it) are over a week past their 2nd.
11577,"My grandparents, aunts &amp; uncles, and even my cousins have had at least 1 shot."
11578,"Because it's an excellent hygiene practice and good mannered and will significantly decrease you getting anyone else sick, not just with covid but going forward to slow the spread of the flu etc...

Now give me a reason you shouldn't wear a mask in public other than it's an inconvenience to you and you're selfish."
11579,Would love some sources for “almost 100% safe”
11580,Just tell them if they want life back to normal faster they need to vaccinate.
11581,The stoners seem to have this whole side effect thing figured out.
11582,"I don't know a single one who has reported any adverse reactions, including my 64 year old partner who had Covid and fought double-pneumonia for 5 months."
11583,"He has sailed through both of his shots without any complaints at all, not even a sore arm."
11584,lol
11585,I don't think any have yet have they?
11586,Do you have a source?
11587,I think it’s much more likely to want it when you are older and it’s much more of a death sentence.
11588,The trouble will be getting young people vaccinated who think catching coronavirus is no big deal.
11589,That’s a great attitude
11590," **Germany's** **BioNTech** **had already developed 20 vaccine candidates by March 1, 2020** when they called Pfizer to ask about partnering."
11591,"That is **two and a half months before the announcement of Operation Warp Speed in the United States on May 15, 2020**"
11592,I think it's more than the premium.
11593,If was a lucky bet on a specific company plus an agreement to give access to medical records of the effect of the vaccine.
11594,Thank you!
11595,"Sinovac is not ineffective, it’s decent."
11596,Just not on the level of Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax which is what they’re aiming for.
11597,Haha so salty.
11598,"If vaccines work and getting covid walking around outside is impossible anyway, there’s no point in wearing a mask at those times."
11599,It’s basically like someone wearing a helmet walking around in case something falls on your head.
11600,"“Very unlikely but Not impossible!”

11606,Some areas with very low mask compliance have avoided major spikes and vise versa.
11607,"We (my fam) keep wearing masks every day, washing hands and made the decision to keep out child out of school 100%, but there is a reality of the fact that we’re not dead yet, and pretending that we’re on the verge is just counterproductive."

11701,"Pfizer has applied, and before it's approved, the [Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar) has to schedule a public meeting to go over the data."

11703,"For reference, Johnson &amp; Johnson applied for their EUA on 4 February, and the VRBPAC meeting was held on 26 February, so hopefully they keep close to that timeline."
11704,"Pfizer applied on April 9, so hopefully the VRBPAC will schedule something near the end of the month."
11705,"Once VRBPAC votes to approve it, it should only be about 24-48 hours before the approval is formalized by the FDA, based on how it went with the earlier EUAs."
11706,"Caveats: The previous EUAs were for adults, I don't know if the FDA will take more time since this is for adolescents and they want to be extra cautious, or possibly even less time, since we already have a baseline of good expectations and they're just looking for any obvious red flags on safety or efficacy that are different between adults and adolescents."
11707,"I talked to someone who had tried so hard to convince himself it was safe, knew all the data, but still had that gut feeling of doubt."
11708,He just couldn't do it.
11709,"However, he was very convicted about taking as many alternative precautions as he could to not spread it, even after we've returned to normal."
11710,I think that's a respectable way to go about things.
11711,"They don't seem to care about where it was created/developed, but who produces it."
11712,"Something as simple as (from Wikipedia):

11746,It was the same in the beginning when they chose not to emphasize mask wear so there wouldn't be a run on it and hospitals wouldn't be able to get PPE.

11800,This guy is so incompetent that he forced a license plate change that made blue the primary color (the same color as his political party)... which ended up being an utter failure because it was too reflective and cameras could not catch license plates.

11818,I received the J&amp;J vaccine five days before they paused it.
11819,I am a woman who falls within the age frame of 18-48.
11820,I didn't want the J&amp;J vaccine (was more interested in the mRNA ones) but took to the philosophy that the best vaccine is whichever one is available (and I think that's a good philosophy!)
11821,and that was the one the place I went to was offering that day.
11822,I'm wondering what the procedure is going to be going forward as it seems like booster shots are going to be a thing for all the vaccines.
11823,If it's determined that J&amp;J isn't recommended for women ages 18-48 (or some other restriction) then will I be changed over to a different vaccine?
11824,Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't less than ten percent of the planet vaccinated?

11833,True that.
11834,Its imporant to take precautions in areas that havent got vaccines for their population yet like travel restrictions.

11842,Your HPV shot is a recombinant vaccine.
11843,You’re confusing different things.
11844,Pfizer/BioNTech was first to market in the US and they accepted no OWS funding.

11870,I’m going to stop you right there.
11871,"The thing is, the reason why they are developing these booster shots and will probably make them yearly is because they want to make sure the vaccine stays effective against these variants."
11872,The vaccines we have right now are already very effective against variants and its very likely that this will be the same for this new variant.
11873,Plus new vaccines are being made and tested at the same time.
11874,"Look, I know this won’t be over globally for quite a while, but in some places it’s starting to be(like Israel) As people get vaccinated there are less and less opportunities for the virus to mutate(and some animals are being vaccined as well) Vaccines ARE THE END GOAL."

11883,"The seniors I know who got it, received it as a sugar cube, and it's a fairly minor memory."
11884,"No it’s not, you can’t compare the results of the trials because they were done at different phases of the pandemic, Pfizer and Moderna were during the summer when cases were low, J&amp;J was at the fall peak; the J&amp;J was also done with a more diverse group spread between the US, South America and Africa, Pfizer and Moderna was predominantly US and the trial criteria was different which skews the results to make the J&amp;J look not as effective."
11885,The J&amp;J vaccine was shown to be effective at preventing COVID infections but more importantly it was extremely effective at preventing hospitalizations and death.
11886,Not surprising.
11887,People are mostly selfish.
11888,I’m surprised there’s so little discussion of how this will affect herd immunity

12033,Nothing says anything about protecting those other than the patients administered the vaccine.

12092,"Yes, that would help - anything that doesn’t make people wonder why they should even get vaccinated."

12113,How many people have been granted approval to be reunited with their loved ones before they died or just to be reunited with their partners or family/kids?
12114,It’s extremely hard to get approval unless you can show evidence you will relocate overseas for more than 3 months.
12115,The travel exit ban is messed up because it’s not holiday seekers who are primarily affected but those who have family ties overseas
12116,How is the United States killing people?
12117,They didn't unleash the virus.
12118,"Not exporting vaccines isn't ""killing people""."
12119,"OK, so some real data."
12120,Let's look at it.
12121,With the first set from the Lancet you use the standard does/standard dose numbers.
12122,Why did you choose that rather than the combined set of numbers which show 70.4%?
12123,Bias?
12124,A desire to prove your point?
12125,"Not sure but next you use the US trials which are a summary, not the specific breakdown that the article from Lancet had so can we assume that the single number they give is an aggregate?"
12126,"I mean, it would make sense, yes?"
12127,"If so that 76% is more comparable to the 70.4% from the Lancet, not the lowest number that you provided."
12128,"That makes them pretty close, to be fair to the data."
12129,Now the last one... it's a look at how the vaccine fares against specifically the South African variant.
12130,"But that's not the same as the other comparisons, is it?"
12131,To my eye the data (ignoring sample size which seems pretty small for the most part) looks like a reasonably consistent set of results 70-76% with the vaccine not being very effective against the South African variant.
12132,Is that an unreasonable conclusion?
12133,"Now, how does the Sinovac compare?"
12134,It's hard to get accurate data.
12135,[This article is interesting](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/14/johnson-and-johnson-sinovac-and-more) and also highlights the lack of data issue.
12136,No agenda on my part.
12137,Just want the most truthful and accurate information.
12138,"My issue with Brazil isn't whether or not it's ""the truth""."
12139,It's that it's wildly different from other numbers... that all of the numbers are wildly different.
12140,"I did not ""misrepresent"" the Chinese CDC claim (and in general you cannot trust the Chinese government on anything of political substance, that is simply a fact that gets repeatedly hammered home anytime something happens that might be viewed negatively and concerns China)."
12141,"Then I moved on to the point you brought up, that the results have a huge range."
12142,"A range much larger than anything seen by the other vaccines, as I have demonstrated to you using your own data."
12143,Do you trust the Chinese government to tell the truth in matters that might reflect poorly on China?
12144,I have spent enough of my life in China to have a pretty well informed opinion of the government there (particularly as it has changed under Xi Jinping) and a quick look at just the first page of your post history shows me that you are almost certainly a Canadian 小粉紅.
12145,"It explains your commitment to your position, that's for sure."

12167,"I do think that we’ll reach herd immunity, mostly through vaccination but also through some natural infection."
12168,"However, some form of this virus will likely become endemic."
12169,It won’t likely ever be eradicated.
12170,"I hope for the best there, but I do think we need to plan for a future with some form of COVID being like the flu."
12171,It seems we already are with booster shots.
12172,So this brings up an interesting question: what is “negligible” spread of a disease that will never go away?
12173,"I don’t think we’re there yet, but I also don’t think it’s zero COVID."
12174,It’s vague words like “negligible” that make people loose patience with restrictions because it’s not a concrete goalpost like a certain vaccination % or a certain hospitalization metric.
12175,It’s one of those words you can throw around to keep restrictions forever.
12176,"Even when you talk about cases being “negligible,” you say we can “probably” drop all restrictions."
12177,"This is where the push for full normalcy comes from, in many cases."
12178,"I don’t want to go to a nightclub—it wasn’t my thing before COVID, either—but I am looking at a future where that kind of activity is restricted indefinitely."
12179,"As far as kids, I don’t think they should be factored into this calculus considering the flu is more dangerous for them."
12180,The main concern with kids is that they’d spread it to more vulnerable people.
12181,"With all willing adults vaccinated, that’s a non-issue."
12182,People who can’t get vaccinated are another issue.
12183,"Can we expect society to permanently give up nightlife for these people, or should we expect them to take extra caution and hope for the best?"
12184,"People seem to think they are different shots, and the second is more effective."
12185,They do not understand that it's just a split dosing of the same thing.
12186,"There are also those that don't believe we even have a vaccine, the shots are water, and the sooner they get their ""second"" documented dose of their ""water shot"", the sooner they can just pretend they are vaccinated and go back to their normal lives."
12187,[removed]
12188,"Oh I get it, you don’t get sick because you have no one close to you in your life with that shit attitude."
12189,I can’t believe someone just tried to flex their immune system online.
12190,But you know what it sounds like you need a win right now so take it buddy.
12191,Maybe they could say what the percentage is then?
12192,"They model stuff like this all the time, we need x number of shots, we are currently averaging 3.2 million shots a day, with that pace we’ll reach 75% by whatever day."
12193,&gt; I think we know what most people will choose.
12194,To update their resumes and find a new job just as soon as possible?
12195,That's the most rational response to an employer reducing your compensation.
12196,"I’ve been told on here (though I haven’t seen it officially stated from the mfrs or any reg agency) that this is being tested, so I would expect guidance about it to come along with the recommendation to get them."
12197,"I would imagine you can mix and match, but I’m sure we’ll see for sure before they start it."
12198,I’ve even seen some discussion that mixing and matching could result in a better immune response!
12199,"Politicians handled the messaging, so its still about politics."
12200,If someone had said to wear a mask instead of to inject bleach there'd be a lot less people using politics as an excuse.
12201,"If you only had a strong response to the first shot, your body probably was already exposed to COVID somehow."
12202,"If your body only had a strong response to the second shot, your body probably was not already exposed to COVID."
12203,"keep in mind, whether we reach herd immunity or not, states and economies are going to reopen at full capacity."
12204,Even in cautious liberal California they're dead set on lifting occupancy limits and distancing measures at all venues by June 15th (masking mandates still in effect).
12205,"The hard truth is that during the summer public health will transition to Private health, meaning that if you don't want to catch covid you're going to have to take your own precautions because the state won't step in to help curb the spread unless hospitals start getting overwhelmed."
12206,The majority of the doses probably do exist already.
12207,It takes quite a while from the time the vaccine is manufactured to the time it can get into someone's arms.
12208,Hard to give a finish line to people who won't participate in the race.
12209,50% of America has at least one shot by now.
12210,I wonder how many of this last 50% will actually vaccinate.

That entire article that was passed along here and gassed up by r/politics was a total lie."
12217,"If even politfact is correcting something in favor of the Trump admin, you know the news messed up."

12220,Well considering Biden administration halted out vaccines.
12221,Fauci has been a less than effective communicator during this event.

12243,&gt;There's literally no abuse of sick days.
12244,"Another reply to me said

&gt;who cares if you use them when you’re sick or not."
12245,"Especially if you’re like me and basically never get sick/have symptoms

People absolutely 100% abuse them."
12246,"Does that mean we shouldn't have them no, but come on how naive are you to think they aren't abused."
12247,"I know you are just trying to bait me, but ill answer honestly (let the downvoting begin)."
12248,I look at my age and overall health and have decided that the potential risks of getting the vaccine (short or long term side affects) are not worth it.
12249,Im waiting to see if there are any long terms affects before i get it.
12250,"Honestly if i was 20 or 30 years older, i would get it now as getting COVID would be riskier."
12251,I mean just because I'm now eligible and want my vaccine doesn't change the fact that every pharmacy near me doesn't have any available doses or a waiting list to get one
12252,That's my anecdotal experience.
12253,I've got a super conservative and pretty religious extended family.
12254,"But the only adult who hasn't gotten at least the first shot hasn't gotten it because she assumes she's been exposed at work a bunch (obviously not a guarantee, but there is a pretty good chance) and because she doesn't believe that anything will change in terms of restrictions for her if she does."
12255,The most conservative have been vaccinated in my family - it's just the person who believes nothing will change who hasn't.
12256,"My anecdote isn't data, but neither is the assumption that people aren't doing it *because* of politics."
12257,Welcome.
12258,"Passport, please."
12259,I'm all for vaccinating as many people as possible but as far as I know none of the vaccines is cleared to be given during a pregnancy.
12260,Thank Trump.
12261,He created the vaccines
12262,They’re not donating a significant portion to make a difference on supply.
12263,The truth is most people simply do not want to get it
12264,I mean it is.
12265,The reason teachers are a higher on the vaccine eligibility list.
12266,They want teachers vaccinated as fast as possible so schools can be reopened.
12267,So if your teacher they're going to squeeze you in.
12268,You're not a teaching work from home it's perfectly fine to wait a day or two to find an appointment.

12274,"&gt;What is high enough

I am not the right person to answer this question."
12275,The CDC should set that number.
12276,"I have seen other people throw around numbers like 70 or 80%, but I have no idea how accurate those are."
12277,Can we reach it?
12278,My gut says yes based on how high the vaccination rate has been so far.
12279,But I obviously can't answer that question definitively.
12280,"You can’t get these brains to accept or give an inkling of credit to trump, no matter how blatantly obvious."
12281,We wouldn’t even have ANY vaccines right now if it wasn’t for him.

12341,And nothing in medicine is 100%.
12342,What is your medical experience again?
12343,Pfizer has gotten immunity from all countries they dealt with.
12344,This is non-negotiable on their part.
12345,"See the other article regarding India, where Pfizer refuses to enter until given immunity."
12346,"The flu knocks you out for two to three weeks, the vaccine at best 48 hours (if at all)."
12347,You don't even *need* serious effects for the tradeoff to be worth it.
12348,"Well, he's definitely helping out his friends, that's for sure."
12349,"you probably have been downvoted because you are just assuming you had covid already and ""stopped getting tested""."
12350,So that fact that you are making a possibly false assumption about your own health in order to not get a vaccine doesn't really check out from a logic-based approach
12351,"What, specifically, has Dr. Fauci ""gained"" from his work on the pandemic and public health response?"
12352,"Keep in mind that he's been in his position since Reagan, so it certainly isn't a job title."

12357,Not really a like since I have a newborn at home
12358,I am fully vaccinated.
12359,I will give others another month or so to get vaccinated.
12360,But the mask is coming off fairly soon.
12361,If people aren’t vaccinated in the next 4-8 weeks that is their risk decision not mine.
12362,"Anyone with worse odds should just get the vaccine, then it shouldn't be an issue right?"
12363,I don't care.
12364,LOL at giving any credit to an anti-vaxer who wanted us to inject Lysol into our lungs while spending the most critical time of the virus calling it a Democratic hoax.

12366,"So yes, “preventing severe illness/hospitalization” is the official purpose."
12367,"But now with a robust rollout, we can see the the vaccines are also very efficacious in preventing transmission."
12368,"It was to be expected, but you can’t claim that without evidence first."
12369,"Anyway, there will always be some number of people who can’t get vaccinated, and even amazing vaccines like this aren’t 100%, so getting close to 100% of the population vaccinated (regardless of Covid risk) would be great!"

12382,There should be no division on this topic.
12383,Kudos to Virginia on getting creative.
12384,Im assuming this is the same type of alert that they use for amber alerts..
12385,I didn’t even think of them lol
12386,Balloon animals
12387,"Who the fuck cares if someone calls in sick, regardless if they’re actually sick or not?"
12388,"Either they get to use a sick day, or they don’t get paid for the day."
12389,There’s literally no abuse of sick days.
12390,Source on that claim?
12391,Joined Saturday!!!
12392,Woke up sick as hell Sunday but feeling great today!
12393,Well worth it.
12394,I've already decided I'll probably continuing wearing masks for at least some time after I'm fully vaccinated and the pandemic is declared over.
12395,I haven't been sick with anything in well over a year and I am cool with it.
12396,I mean everyone knows they are safe already for kids but as a parent I'm sure she wants to be extra careful.
12397,My family and community is religious and we’re all vaccinated/ vaccinating.
12398,"No, it was intentional."
12399,Comments that say “most people are vaccinated” are implying immunity.
12400,"We should be clear and differentiate the terms, especially when most people haven’t had their vaccine for 2 weeks."
12401,Uhhhhh.
12402,What?
12403,"I don't think any of your thought process is necessarily wrong, it's just extremely selfish."
12404,"The data shows very, very, *extremely* little risk when getting the vaccine."
12405,"You recognize that if we all decided not to get the vaccine, we'd be in for millions of more deaths and on going lockdowns and disruptions to the lives we all would like to be living?"
12406,"If you do, you're essentially saying: ""I'll just let others get it so that they help stop the spread enough that I can go back to my normal life and not take on that tiny, tiny amount of risk""."
12407,"Hopefully it reminds the anti-5g, antivax people that they already have tracking microchips on them, in their hands..."
12408,We’ve been seeing this for months.
12409,I haven’t seen any international response to help Brazil
12410,Probably - I think the idea is very neat and honestly it's amazing that these creatures sense of smell is just that keen.
12411,It's a breath of fresh air after putting up with a piece of shit president that did absolutely nothing about COVID-19.
12412,"Yup, I still have 1 week to go for full effective!"
12413,though even 2 weeks after the first shot pfizer and moderna are more than 80% effective.
12414,Same
12415,Politics?
12416,"Democrats are taking the vaccine because they believe in ""science"" or whatever."
12417,Republicans should take it because we developed the vaccine at record speed thanks to The Great Orange One.
12418,I'm waiting another 6-12 months.
12419,I consider those getting the vaccine now to be the trial so I can figure out if it's safe.
12420,Because it sells clicks
12421,Not once in my comment did I say vaccines don’t work or that they don’t work against variants.
12422,"I said they **do not work for at least 12 days after inoculation, and two doses is better than one."
12423,Let’s wait for people to get their second dose.
12424,**
12425,"Well, he’s not a politician or a political activist."
12426,Just a voter.
12427,"I didn’t even mention what his beliefs were, though, so it’s kind of strange that you say that."
12428,"I think a reason for the decline is simply that a lot of people have been exposed, and most people get at least some immunity after being exposed."
12429,Every virus must fizzle out at some point because enough people will get it that it can't be transmitted as easily if at all.
12430,"I also think that covid may be seasonal, there is ample evidence that other coronaviruses are seasonal, but we may not have seen this last summer because it was spreading so rapidly in so many areas."
12431,It is possible that there was a lot of spread but it was also seasonal.
12432,"This year with far more people exposed and some areas vaccinated, we may see the seasonal trend much more clearly."
12433,"Meanwhile, as many people in South Africa die of covid *each day* as would die of blood clots if the entire population were vaccinated with J&amp;J, even at the most pessimistic rates."

12439,Does anyone know If I am temporarily (2 years) living in another state for work can I still get my vaccine with a out of state id?
12440,Or do I need to wait till I go home?
12441,Your boss absolutely can’t find out if you got the vaccine or not without you telling them.
12442,He can get it and say he hasn’t yet if he wants.
12443,What ad hominem?
12444,"Claiming you don’t have a social life, similar to the claim you’ve made about me repeatedly?"
12445,What have you disproven?
12446,"Don’t worry though, I’m done wasting my time here so you can claim you’ve won if you want, even if all you’ve done is just claim I’m pro lockdown repeatedly as if that’s either correct or an argument."
12447,"This is a fair point, but I think money may talk more the other way."
12448,"If your state board is saying they’ll pull more your funding if you do that, then there’s nothing you can realistically do."
12449,You can explain the risk but these people don’t care about that.
12450,They forced in-person classes to be available when that was clearly the wrong move.
12451,"While they are different techniques, they both induce your body to make the same spike protein."
12452,Still doesn't explain why its spiking now when flu spikes at the start of january
12453,Did you happen to see anything about the trials for younger?
12454,We also see that climate clearly plays a large roll in the spread of the virus.
12455,"Notice how despite the north having more restrictions, stricter mask mandates, and much higher vaccine rates compared to the south, the north is experiencing a surge in covid cases, while the South is doing fantastic."
12456,Israel has a much hotter climate.
12457,I assume we will see cases drop like they did in Israel once the northern part of the US warms up.
12458,The vast majority of Americans are not fully vaccinated.
12459,An easy metric for ending mask-wearing would be when at least a 50% majority of Americans are fully vaccinated.
12460,It's also very plain to see that not wearing a mask is way more of an identity for people than wearing one.
12461,Thanks!
12462,"“Or kids would be dying like crazy lol“

Are we talking about the same thing?"
12463,"Clinical trials for 4 yr old children with the covid19 vaccine are just now starting...


And now you’re saying
“All that'll happen is they'll be more side effects.”
What happened to “You do realize there are no side effects right?” from earlier?"

12478,Well sure.
12479,Anyone can be divisive.
12480,Won’t disagree with that.
12481,But the influence the president has over the population is greater than any other single person.
12482,Especially when one does have a “once-in-a-lifetime” magnetic personality.
12483,We won’t see someone like that again for another hundred years.
12484,"But hopefully when someone like that does appear and gains the office of the presidency they’ll use their power of persuasion for good rather than ill.

Edit."
12485,I am comfortable saying that there have been only a handful of personalities like his that have gained political power in the past 120 years.
12486,Prior to that you’d have to back to Napoleon.
12487,It’s a very rare trait and it can be used for good or ill.
12488,Here it isn't that impossible.
12489,"Dilma got impeached in 2016, more than 2 years before her term expired."
12490,"The problem is that Bolsonaro ""didn't do anything threatening to all brazilian""."
12491,"Dilma had humanity and was far less corrupt, but her government wasn't pro-market and it was very progressive in human rights (rights for women, racial minorities, gays etc), and that is ""very threateing to our Christendom""."
12492,In other words: Bolsonaro being completely genocidal doesn't outrage us brazilians that much.
12493,"**If anyone filmed him making love to another male, he'd probably be impeached."
12494,"**

I can't express how much I hate him, I got a 15-day ban from this sub last time I did it lol"
12495,"I wouldn't say I'm fearful, just cautious."
12496,"This is still a novel virus so we're learning on the fly with the vaccines, so I want to stay abreast of all the new data that comes along."
12497,"I'm halfway vaccinated and once I'm fully vaccinated in a few weeks I'll feel less cautious, but that doesn't mean I'll pretend we're 100% in the clear."
12498,It's perfectly understandable to not let your guard down and you can do it without being a prisoner of the moment.
12499,"Like with anything else, balance is key."
12500,I guess I was just wondering since J&amp;J is an adenovirus-based vaccine whereas Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA.
12501,I don't think getting a booster based on a different technology would necessarily work?
12502,"I could be completely wrong but this is something I'm concerned about as someone who got the J&amp;J vaccine who is now finding out that, based on my demographics, maybe should be getting one of the other ones."
12503,"I'm definitely not going out and getting another vaccine, just curious about boosters!"
12504,"Yes, this process is part of what is known as the [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology), where DNA in your cells is [transcripted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_\(biology\)) by enzymes into mRNA, which is then [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_\(biology\)) by ribosomes to proteins."
12505,[removed]
12506,Depends.
12507,Houston is built on a swamp for one.
12508,The people to whom Fauci has lost credibility never really saw him as credible in the first place.
12509,I wear my mask everywhere I go and it never comes off.
12510,Sort of like what you've been doing for the last year but with other people.
12511,[deleted]
12512,That's dry heat though right?
12513,"We also get 70% humidity, which makes it worse."
12514,They ought to just give you the choice then since it seems like they don't care either way.
12515,Luckily my job wants to leave work completely from home now.
12516,"I’m moving across the country on Sunday, so I can’t start the shots in case I would get a bad reaction."
12517,"I’m planning on getting J&amp;J anyway, as I have a permanent disability and prefer not to jump into any new technology (like mRNA)."
12518,"My doctors here agree that’s for the best, but I’m obviously going to have a new GP and new specialists, so I’m probably going to get their opinion before getting it (and I might need help finding a location for J&amp;J. I’m not sure)."
12519,Of course it makes a difference.
12520,It creates even more resentment towards those that voted for the ex-President.
12521,I work in a hospital that had a covid unit.
12522,I would guess about 25% of clinical staff have not and likely will not get it.
12523,"One of the more common arguments I've heard is, ""I've already had it, so I'm already immune"""
12524,"Ah, interesting— thanks for sharing this, I wondered how that worked."
12525,Girlfriend’s mom is in a similar boat.
12526,"Constantly working, can’t get time off, only has the weekend off but of course all the appointments are booked continuously."
12527,She knows that she’ll have side-effects so even if she could get time off it would need to be a Friday.
12528,She just has to wait a few weeks for slots to open up.
12529,It's a double dose vaccine too...
12530,I think it's going to come down to money.
12531,Not requiring a vaccine even when fully approved puts the universities at a significant financial liability.
12532,"If there is an outbreak that results in shutdowns, they are going to lose millions of dollars, all while 95 percent of other universities are fully open and without these financial liabilities."
12533,"Money trumps everything, even politics, and I doubt the political will will still be there when they are loosing all that money and looking foolish on a national level to boot."
12534,"Back when I was in college, most of my classes were at a separate building off the main campus."
12535,In my entire time at college I only had one single class on the main campus after I moved out of the dorms.
12536,I missed nearly every class because of parking being just completely not worth it.
12537,I'm so lucky that attendance was only mandatory on test days and it was a pretty easy class.
12538,By the end of the semester test days were literally the only days I'd bother fighting with parking to actually show up lol
12539,So you're whole argument is that the UK didn't have a long and strict lockdown because the last few weeks haven't been 'very strict'?
12540,I guess in July you can claim that the UK didn't have any restrictions because the last few weeks haven't had any restrictions.
12541,Have a good day!
12542,"Well, wanting to see if we can't push a few more diseases over the brink of eradication isn't *that* insane."
12543,I don't know what scientists say about that though.
12544,Cool!
12545,"I like the analogy that after the first shot your body is like, oh hi, you're new and foreign but whatever."
12546,Immune response only localized to your arm.
12547,The second shot is your body seeing the spike protein again and having an oh shit moment.
12548,The second shot occurs and your body recognizes the foreign spike protein and develops a stronger immune response against it.
12549,I normally would say that it wouldn't be except that these kids are going to be shoved into classrooms full of other kids who literally cannot get vaccinated yet.
12550,"They won't infect their teachers/parents anymore, but they can still infect themselves."
12551,"However, I do realize that COVID doesn't affect most kids badly at all so that might still be not as big of a cause for concern."

12557,"&gt; Richer countries and those with more access to vaccine would pass the vaccines off to poorer countries where vaccine hesitancy is already high and it would fuel the idea of a 2 tier world, many of those in poorer countries would refuse a vaccine that isn't allowed in richer countries even though the risk benefit was clearly in favour of taking the vaccine."
12558,"This is exactly why I really don't think it's ok for countries to put off these vaccines that are perfectly safe to use with a few caveats ""just to be on the safe side"", while they wait for more Pfizer/Moderna doses instead."
12559,"Are they going to destroy those AZ/J&amp;J doses then (outrageous), or dump them on poor countries who aren't good enough for the supposedly safer vaccine (also outrageous)?"
12560,"If these vaccines are dangerous, if they really aren't good enough to vaccinate these rich countries, then production should cease immediately and all remaining doses destroyed."
12561,How can anyone even contemplate any other course of action?
12562,...
12563,"Unless, of course, authorities know that these vaccines are more than safe enough but are struggling to admit it."
12564,This seems like a pipe dream here in the UK.
12565,I feel like we will be in some form of pseudo lockdown with a ban on any fun for a long time to come
12566,Check online what to expect.
12567,But I think it was like 8hrs after
12568,I am not a scientist but honestly the vaccines seem relatively straightforward to me.
12569,"We get injected with something that makes our body produce proteins that in turn our immune system learns to fight off, in the same way that it fights off actual viruses and other things."
12570,"Once trained, the immune system recognizes this threat for probably many years and so we are much safer against that threat."
12571,My interpretation is that the weird and dangerous (and very rare) side effects stem from the immune system going into overdrive for a short time while it responds to the threat.
12572,Which is something that it would do if we were exposed to the actual virus.
12573,Some vaccines stimulate the immune system in different ways (slightly different proteins) so this effect is more or less in different people.
12574,"But the virus itself can cause blood clots, I am guessing in much the same way, because it puts the immune system into overdrive."
12575,When the body is under stress from the infection there can be severe (but very rare) side effects like blood clots.
12576,"It's actually far more likely to get blood clots from the virus, if you get it, than from the vaccine."
12577,"Even though the mRNA vaccines are a new technology, it's just a new way of delivering the same thing and generating the same response."
12578,"In fact so far statistically the mRNA vaccines are safer than the adenovirus vector vaccines like AZ and J&amp;J, perhaps because they can target different proteins more easily (or perhaps just by chance)."
12579,"The vaccine is not a drug, it doesn't linger in your system for years, it just triggers the immune system and is gone."
12580,This is probably an oversimplification but this is why I didn't hesitate to take the vaccine.
12581,I have probably taken 10-15 vaccines in my life and the risk/reward is very clearly in favor of the reward.
12582,"We are all under very unlikely risks in day to day life, like flying in an airplane statistically increases your chance of blood clots, but we all fly anyway because the risk is very very small."
12583,"At any moment in time, statistically we all have a 1 in 400,000 chance of dying on a particular day, but we don't obsess over it."

Visit inside a home or private setting without a mask with other fully vaccinated people of any age”

12617,"It definitely seems like ""something"" happened in the past few weeks to make it explode, since they were doing very well without strict lockdowns for several months."
12618,"If it is a variant, we should be hearing about it soon, because while India can't do genetic sequencing at the same rate as the UK, I'm sure they can at least sequence a few thousand samples every week, which would be all you need to see a pattern emerge."
12619,"It may just be that the people were ""behaving well"" even in the absence of lockdowns, until they weren't, and the explosion in cases might be primarily due to increased social mixing rather than a new variant."
12620,Covid is classified as a flu virus?
12621,By who?
12622,It isn't an influenza virus.
12623,It's a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
12624,Covid vaccines aren't mandatory either.
12625,But getting both is a good way to protect yourself and others.

12629,Immune systems are a thing.

12634,"I had the flu 11 years ago and after I recovered, I developed a chronic illness that affects my daily life."

12636,"A flu shot could have saved me so much pain and struggle, not to mention the ongoing medical bills."
12637,A covid shot could do the same for you and others.
12638,I sincerely hope you'll reconsider.
12639,Damn I thought the US was the best for vaccination rates.
12640,Is the UK even better?
12641,Can someone provide a comparison?
12642,Fauci is a leader as well and has made a divisive statement.
12643,Even people who aren't leaders can be divisive.
12644,&gt; Current estimates are between 60-90% of the total population.
12645,There is a 0% chance that we ever hit 90% of all Americans being vaccinated.
12646,Even 80% is highly unlikely.
12647,"Your other point, that even mild cases among low to zero-risk populations is dangerous because of the potential for new variants, implies that you're advocating for zero covid policies."
12648,Is that correct?
12649,"Divisive means it creates disagreement or tension, and it doesn't apply here because they already came up with enough reason to hate the current administration."
12650,These comments make no difference.
12651,I hate to guess.
12652,I understand the importance of masking up on public transit (and indoors) but do people wear masks just walking around there outdoors in parks or the sidewalk?
12653,Is it actually enforced or can people just stop doing it?
12654,[removed]
12655,I really want empty moderna/pfizer/j&amp;j/AZ vials to keep as collectibles but I have no idea how I would go about getting them.
12656,I've seen empty boxes of all of them on ebay but no vials.
12657,I'm guessing distribution sites destroy the vials so that people cant keep them and sell fake vaccines or something so I've got no idea where to look.
12658,"A person like you saying the word ""science"" is insulting to the sciences."

12663,I feel my stress level dropping.
12664,"So, if this is a known human error issue with Pfizer, because it has to be manually diluted, I'm thinking they need to start making their vials comically large and odd-shaped to ensure the techs know they'll pulling from the right one."

12696,They are leaders because they used their inherent powers to pursue worthy goals.
12697,No one even remembers the VP’s of each of those presidents.
12698,"Well, almost no one."
12699,A president is given enormous persuasion over the populace whether we want to admit it or not.

12707,"&gt;	The CDC data says the risk of contracting covid is less than .007% he is absolutely ridiculous

wtf The cdc says to wear a mask and keep distancing too, quit your bullshit 

&gt;	CDC recommends you get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as one is available to you."
12708,"However, because people can still get sick and possibly spread COVID-19 to others after being fully vaccinated, CDC recommends people continue to take everyday actions to protect themselves and others, like wearing a mask, maintaining an appropriate distance from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing hands often."
12709,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html

Also 0.007% chance?"
12710,That’s not how statistics work at all.
12711,Remember they are all under extreme assumptions.

12713,"Read psychology of Simpson’s paradox..

12714,Is this because England is getting vaccinated or are there other reasons?
12715,"Being a scientist, look at the evidence we have related to current vaccinations, which we give billions of doses to, and to people around the world."
12716,"Childhood vaccinations, annual vaccinations, boosters, etc — there aren’t serious side effects which outweigh the benefit of vaccination."
12717,Not one of them has an effect that could occur years or decades later.
12718,"If you’re nervous about mRNA, I believe it isn’t exactly new since there has been mRNA technology used for over a decade in developing a rabies shot... but if you can’t do mRNA for whatever reason, take an adenovirus vector."
12719,You’re not in a high risk category based on age alone — but the risks of covid outweigh the risks of vaccination.
12720,"It’s prudent to consider that everyone will eventually attain some immunity either via infection or vaccination, so you can either get vaccinated or risk natural infection with a novel virus we know very little about."
12721,"I haven't been able to go to the gym or get any work atall for 6 months, it's felt like an eternity to me."
12722,They literally said that vaccinated people can go see other vaccinated people without wearing a mask
12723,"No, I can't and that is mainly because you really can't compare this type of a vaccine which for all intents and purposes is a genetic vaccine, requiring the cellular machinery to transcribe the RNA and produce the protein intracellularly."
12724,No other FDA vaccine exists like this.
12725,"All others are typically purified protein, subunit protein, attenuated live viral (flu), virus like particles (looks just like the actual virus, but no genetic material, e.g."
12726,gardasil).
12727,"Almost all organized religions endorse vaccination - the Roman Catholics, most organized Protestant denominations, Orthodox Jewish rabbis, most Muslim imams, and a lot of others."

12753,Yeah if there's a lesson here it's to just be honest with people.

12789,it's just my prediction
12790,I'm doing it and I don't mind.
12791,I'm just grateful  I don't have to worry so much now that I will catch Covid at work.
12792,So I read an article and apparently in Oregon they have to make it “permanent” by a certain date or it goes away.
12793,"The intention is to remove it when warranted, but who knows when that will be there, and according to whom?"
12794,What kind of change do we think he'll make?
12795,That is encouraging to hear that Disney is vaccinating all of their staff.
12796,"Maybe by the fall when the vaccine is widely available for anyone who wants it, including staff, then the mandate may no longer make sense as it does take away from the experience from the sounds of it?"
12797,"Depressed people, rejoice!"
12798,But only if you're on prozac.
12799,Oh it makes total sense politically - I am just put off by the CDC dragging their feet on updating guidance when their own data shows how effective the vaccines are.
12800,I get the sense that some of it is running out the clock until the first 100 days is over (and the first 100 days has been referred to multiple times in the White House CDC Covid briefings)
12801,Somehow this will make Jim Jordan angry.
12802,Us funded vaccine development by purchasing the vaccines before they were finished and proven.
12803,This was a huge risk.
12804,The US also funded production facilities and distribution.
12805,This was all operation warp speed.
12806,Terrible name but the results speak for themselves.
12807,This was all to vaccinate us citizens.
12808,The rest of the world will eventually benefit from this.

12810,Thanks for the detailed account of what’s going on.
12811,"It seems Disney is trying to find that perfect balance of safety while keeping things open, and it sounds like it’ll be tough until more people are vaccinated."
12812,"That’s why we are looking at the autumn to go there, but we are wondering if we might have to wait until 2022 to go there because of what you described above."
12813,"I think they're realizing that 

The way he phrased it that the CDC is currently looking at how to update guidelines ""so you won't have to"" leads me to think they're going to drop the big bomb and outright declare vaccinated people don't have to mask in everyday establishments unless house rules somewhere asks them to 

Because he's never quite been that forward about the possibility before"
12814,"Good, virus is over."
12815,Same in Ohio.
12816,Rural white republicans just are not getting it at the rate they should.
12817,We have a lot of work ahead of us to undo Trumps messaging last year.
12818,"The authors of articles like this are running out of time to keep on writing them, lmao."
12819,"The US government has been quite aggressive in handing out money to its people and businesses during this pandemic:

- PPP loans are keeping thousands of affected small businesses afloat."
12820,"- Three rounds of stimulus checks totaling $3100 per adults, plus unemployment benefits paying at least $300 a week (was $600) until September of this year."
12821,"- COVID testing, treatment, and vaccines are all free in the US."
12822,- The federal government and many states are freezing evictions.
12823,Some Republican states are only beginning to restart them again.
12824,"- The recently passed American Rescue Plan gives hundreds billions more to educational institutions and state governments

As a result, US household finances on the whole are actually in great shape:

- [Bank deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPSACBW027SBOG) gained $3.3 trillion from the start of the pandemic 
- [Home prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA#0) gained 10%, [65.8% of Americans](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N) own their homes
- [Household debt service payment as a % of disposable income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TDSP) is near all time low 
- [Household net worth](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO) at all time high, not surprising considering how well the US stock market is doing."
12825,"54% of American household own stocks 
- [Real disposable personal income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DSPIC96) is up significantly in 2020, but with far fewer venues to spend, [Personal saving](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A071RC1A027NBEA) spiked

Of course, all this generosity by the federal government has a price:

- [Total federal government debt as % of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S) soared and has likely exceeded [level reached during WW2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDGDPA188S)
- On the other hand, due to declining interest rate, [federal government interest expenses as % of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYOIGDA188S) is significantly below levels reached during the late 1980s and early 1990s

Distribution of this wealth is also very uneven."
12826,"2/3 have done well, especially the top 10%, but the bottom 1/3 are really suffering."
12827,"So while the overall financial condition of Americans is good, much more work needs to be done."
12828,But domestic born variants that evade immune protection are fine?
12829,"I don't think that 85% will be necessary to reach the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19, regardless what restrictions are in place."
12830,"For that to the be case, R0 would need to be about 6.7 for this coronavirus (1-1/R0)."
12831,"FYI, Disney just changed the mask while taking pictures policy."
12832,You can take the mask off for pics now.

12842,"Watched tv for a few hours, went back to bed, slept for 10 hours and felt fine."
12843,Worth it.
12844,"From what I've heard, any adverse effects of a vaccine are typically relatively immediate -- occurring within weeks."
12845,"Are there any examples of other vaccines that had identifiable ""long term effects""?"
12846,"Other than immunity, of course"
12847,Exactly this.
12848,I bet there is more people 54 and under that are willing to take it than the 55+ crowd.
12849,"There was never good evidence that outdoor mask mandates did anything at all, so the fact that it took that long to officially reach that conclusion is really discouraging."
12850,How long will it take them to reach the conclusion that making vaccinated people wear masks in any setting does nothing?
12851,Or that there’s no good reason to keep restrictions once anyone who wants the vaccine can easily get it?
12852,"Yeah, I figured if they got 70% of them it would be an accomplishment but 80+%, WOW."
12853,Death rate is about to plummet
12854,How many Astrazenca vaccines you guys still holding on to and not using?
12855,You going to lift the embargo’s on raw materials in your control so others can create vaccines for other countries.
12856,Or are you going to continue to hoard so you can protect your 2nd amendment rights while you continue to kill people?...all over the world
12857,"&gt; If you want people to get vaccinated, you can't act like it means masks and distancing forever."
12858,"They need an actual reason to get it, and a return to normal is a fantastic one."
12859,The reason is wear masks is to save lives.
12860,"If ""normalcy"" and not wearing masks means that hundreds of thousands more people will die, then it isn't a good idea."
12861,You haven't made any convincing argument that people should stop wearing masks.
12862,"We need to look at the medical and public health reasons for wearing masks, even after someone has been vaccinated."
12863,You seem to be assuming there is no good reason to wear a mask after vaccination.
12864,"Two reasons would be that 1) vaccinated people can catch COVID and spread it to others (the vaccine doesn't stop this even if it reduces it) and 2) vaccines may have less effectiveness against certain variants, making it even more likely vaccinated people can spread COVID (which will result in more deaths and people with long term health problems."

12940,Then by day 3 I was absolutely fine.
12941,Very glad to be fully vaccinated now.
12942,You’ll see a decline by the end of this week.
12943,About exactly when they did last year.
12944,"Due to our natural immunity and vaccines the March/April wave of this year is so much lighter, the Northeast was pretty much at a plateau, last year hospitals were packed."
12945,"Our daily deaths continue to fall, last year we had about 1K more deaths a day than this year."
12946,Not to mention we were missing deaths last year.
12947,By mid May we will be super super low in the US.
12948,Good question...I wish I had an optimistic response
12949,I don’t think we know what’s going on yet.
12950,It certainly appears this could be a rare event caused by the vaccine.
12951,However I t’s by no means conclusively proven yet.
12952,And if it is and the rate is 1 in a million and we know how to treat it it’s still pretty safe.
12953,There is roughly a 5 in a million chance anaphylaxis with Pfizer which is why they ask you to wait as that can be fatal if untreated.
12954,No medical treatment is ever 0 risk.
12955,Other past vaccines have also had rare adverse reaction risks.
12956,Yet we generally consider those safe and don’t give it a second thought.
12957,Now it’s certainly possible in the future as we learn what’s going on and that one is in fact safer than another it makes sense to use the safer one.
12958,I don’t think any of us are married to J&amp;J for life.
12959,Or whichever other vaccine we got.
12960,What doctor said that?
12961,And on what basis?
12962,Do we even know who made the flu shot we got last year?
12963,Or that it’s the same every year?
12964,Because the vaccine seriously reduces the symptoms and helps your body successfully fight off a full-blown infection.
12965,"That does not mean you cannot still contract and spread the disease, the disease is less effective against you."
12966,Those who are immunocompromised still need our help.
12967,"Normalizing wearing a mask also prevents the spread of other diseases as well, it isn't a big deal to wear them, wash your hands frequently and care for others in this regard."
12968,"https://civiqs.com/results/coronavirus_vaccine?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true

Politics is by far the biggest factor."
12969,Age and Education level are pretty close to even though as factors.
12970,Vaccines work.
12971,Vaccines work.
12972,Get over it.
12973,Can't discriminate due to disability.
12974,Person says they have a disability.
12975,Forcing a person to disclose their disability is a big no-no per ADA.
12976,"Even so, I'm sure there's tons of docs that'll make a killing pumping out those letters."
12977,"So also, watch the local mandates."
12978,"While FL doesn't have a state wide, and DeSantis killed local agencies from enacting fines, larger counties still have ""Please do it"" mandates in place."
12979,"When Orange County Mayor Smooth Jazz Voice (seriously, listen to Jerry Demings press briefings..."
12980,"I would listen to that man read the phone book) removes the mandate, I'll feel more comfortable."
12981,He and his team as following CDC as best they can down here.
12982,So jealous 😞 good for them tho!
12983,I’m just sad I probably won’t receive my first dose before the end of the year
12984,"I can't speak for Universal, but Disney is serious about it and has CMs actively enforcing it."
12985,"Kids under 2 are exempt, but otherwise everyone has to wear one anytime they aren't eating **while seated and stationary** (b/c people were getting drinks/popcorn/turkey legs just to have an excuse to walk around maskless)."
12986,Downside of this is you can't even drink water while in line.
12987,"Even for pictures you're not allowed to be maskless, and for ride photos, if anyone in the photo took their mask off, they pull the photo from the system like they do if someone flips the bird."
12988,In your shoes I'd hold off on Disney for now.
12989,But not anyone can get one of they can't get an appointment.
12990,It seems a little pedantic to split hairs over whether they can't get one because the pharmacy doesn't have any or doesn't have enough
12991,I’m mainly worried about school when it comes to the CDC as once businesses open up to max capacity then masks will likely go away naturally with a lack of enforcement.
12992,"However, I’m hoping that my school starts off this fall with no restrictions."
12993,"If they have any, That’s gonna piss everyone off and rightfully so as it won’t be necessary."
12994,"Yes, vaccines aren’t here for under 16 year olds but that doesn’t matter."
12995,":(

Hopefully this surge will be handled."
12996,We are just going to have to keep producing and distributing vaccines as fast as humanly possible while doing all the non-pharmaceutical things we can safely and effectively can.
12997,Praying things change for the better soon.
12998,It doesn't change anything for *children* ...
12999,YET.
13000,"As a parent, it is my duty to keep my child out of harm's way."
13001,I have no greater desire to expose them to coronavirus than to measles or chicken pox.
13002,So until kids can be vaccinated it is prudent to continue other mitigation measures.
13003,Go for it.
13004,I like seeing people’s faces when I interact with them.
13005,I like them seeing mine.
13006,I like being able to hear my kids and their friends when they speak and when I’m coaching them.

13110,This might be a silly question.

13252,It’s an important message for some people.
13253,I don't understand why you are downvoted.
13254,"Seriously, can someone explain why 2 weeks after J and J is good enough but that isn't the case for Pfizer or Moderna?"
13255,"I mean of course there is, it's way more contagious and way more deadly"
13256,"Relax, bud."
13257,"The act itself doesn't, correct."
13258,"My point is that the Patriot Act was enacted after a national tragedy, and while currently not active (ironically thanks to 45), it is still not repealed nearly 20 years later."

13262,"same, got mine 36 hours ago, 2nd pfizer, only side effect is the same sore arm I had the first time"
13263,Interesting take.
13264,"It's hard for me to even imagine anyone feeling that way, so I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the statement."
13265,Certainly there are negative people who will find other things to be negative about.
13266,Others may may be more comfortable with the lack of social pressure.
13267,But masks are annoying and optimism seems pretty awesome.
13268,"For anyone reading this who feels bad if they didn't have a big reaction to the vaccine, there is no data suggesting that more side effects = more protection."
13269,Lot's of people reported no side effects at all during the phase 2 trials and they were found to have no drop in protection vs those reporting side effects
13270,"The death/infection rate in Israel is one of the lowest worldwide throughout the whole pandemic, I'm not sure what the reason for that is (apart from a very good, completely free health are system), but it is less than 0.8% (compare to 2% in the US)."
13271,"If you look at the stats, the second lockdown did not flatten the curve of the second wave at all, with a major peak in New cases and deaths occurring in its middle."
13272,"No, I'm just not going to bend over backwards to prove that 2+2, in fact, equals 4."
13273,Its not my problem if you want to be willingly ignorant because you think it constitutes a legitimate argument.
13274,Someone in /r/Orlando made a spreadsheet that I've been able to text to several friends.
13275,It has links to all the various pharmacies in the area that are offering.
13276,I've found this helps some.
13277,Consolidated information.
13278,"Not quite your ""Come on In"" scenario, but close."
13279,And we have a FEMA site that does walk-ins.
13280,"Well, did J&amp;J."
13281,They're going to quickly shift back to Pfizer first dose again for walk-ins until J&amp;J is back in the system.
13282,Most people say 15 to 30 minutes tops from parking to needle in arm.
13283,"How would maintaining mask mandates benefit the government, exactly?"
13284,They make it HARDER to identify people.
13285,"Even from a conspiracy theorist standpoint, that makes no sense."
13286,Wyoming is the most embarrassing by a mile.
13287,The whole state is purple on that map.
13288,They should put a target.
13289,"If 75% of Americans get vaccinated, all restrictions end."
13290,The patriot act has nothing to do with the pandemic or Oregon’s efforts to suppress transmission.
13291,"As some one who has never had a sense of smell, yep, it's brutal."
13292,Underrated as an issue in several areas of keeping safe.

13294,"There are some people who are trying to weasel kids into ""everyone being offered a vaccine"" as an endpoint (because of theoretical ""long covid"" risk?"
13295,who knows.)
13296,Despite the disease being a cold in most children.
13297,Just got back from a week at Disney World and they are serious about masks in the parks.
13298,CMs are out there enforcing it and there are constant announcements about all their guidelines including letting you know they WILL throw you out if you refuse to comply.
13299,You can now take your mask off for pics.
13300,I saw a bit less enforcement at Disney Springs but still I would say 95% of people were wearing their masks correctly.
13301,As someone said if your child is 2 or under they are not required to wear a mask so if your 3 year old looks young maybe he/she can get away with it.
13302,Most kids I saw had no issues with the masks.
13303,I had a great time but I would not recommend going now if it’s your first time.
13304,Most shows are canceled and there are no fireworks or parades so you are not getting the full experience.
13305,It was a great deal for me as a Florida resident and I’ve been more times that I could count so it worked out.
13306,"And I’m proud to be one of those people, whoop whoop!"
13307,"What about the 3,005 people that died from Pfizer/Moderna?"
13308,Funny how they paused J&amp;J and didn't even mention the other deaths.
13309,"Yet when you look it up, they say they can't find a direct link."
13310,Sure I believe that!
13311,"WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY

13312,It’s the opposite.
13313,People with stronger immune systems (younger) have a stronger immune response.
13314,You’re not getting sick from the shot.
13315,Your immune system is just reacting.
13316,"80% of doses applies are from Sinovac, so..."
13317,"I did the J&amp;J trials and found out I was in the Active group... And the only side effects I remember is the injection site was bruised for a good week, and nausea the next day."
13318,"But that was election day, so was it the shot, or general nerves?"
13319,"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

So yeah, occasionally my brain goes ""Wait!"
13320,"Are you sure?"""
13321,You’re just measuring the numbers from 1 county.
13322,I’m sorry but this is a large event.
13323,It’s going to be statewide if we see any effects.
13324,People are coming from the entire state to that game.
13325,"And so far, we haven’t seen any major changes at a state level."
13326,Nope.
13327,You misunderstood.
13328,More than 80% is the number of ALL elderly people in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

13332,One shot is rlly convenient t
13333,My husband and I were the last of the family to be vaccinated and we hit two weeks post vaccination on Friday.
13334,Today we got to hug all of our nieces (too young to be vaccinated but their parents are fully vaccinated) for the first time in over a year.

13398,I just told wifey about this 20mins ago.
13399,A little history first.
13400,I had covid in late October.
13401,"1 day very high fever, 2 next days i had on and off fever after taking ibuprofen or paracetamol, 4th day just some vertigo when i got up from bed, and fifth day i was totally fine."
13402,No symptoms at all.
13403,Its almost the end of April and just now i'm starting to feel my energy and my breathing getting back to normal.
13404,No breathlessness after exercising.
13405,I had breathlessness climbing to the second floor in January.
13406,No heart palpitations for me tho.
13407,"&amp;#x200B;

Get a serology test (anti covid IgG antibodies ) to see if you got infected in January."
13408,I think it's a sports meme.
13409,"When players are fighting on the field, the announcers might say ""you hate to see it."""
13410,Even though a lot of spectators actually enjoy watching the fights.
13411,"""You love to see it"" is just flipping that phrase around."
13412,I think it was used a lot on r/cfb and r/nba before becoming more mainstream.
13413,Could be totally wrong though
13414,"Agreed, naturally infected ppl contribute to heard immunity, but not to the extent (and possibly duration) of those who are vaccinated."
13415,"And conversely, people who are pcr positive a second time still contribute partially to herd immunity, given their lower viral loads."
13416,One thing to note is mrna vaccines have about 90% efficacy at preventing infection (pcr positivity) in their overall study populations (older average age than this study).
13417,"But still, 10% vs 20% pcr positivity after mrna vaccine (all ages) and natural infection (young only)."
13418,"Plus, there is overlap between the vaccinated and infected populations (some of the vaccinated 50% is also in the 20% who had natural infections )"
13419,"Which is why you can't give Trump credit for it, brah."
13420,Yeah that was a classic case of setting goals we were already on pace to reach for political gain.
13421,Say what you will about Trump but OWS was a resounding success.
13422,The only number I can confidently give is 96%.
13423,"It is probably a lot less than that, but we won't know until several months after we reach it, and then we will have overshot the mark."
13424,The problem is different for different things so we don't really have anything to go by.
13425,"95% if this is as bad as measles, but most are not that bad, so could be 70 or 80%."
13426,The mRNA vaccines might (it isn't valid to compare like this) be more effective than some of the other technologies which makes it harder when there is a mixture.
13427,"There are some claiming Israel has reached it at 55%, but that seems a bit low to me."
13428,"Variants matter too, if a new variant emerges that is twice as bad as the current (already twice as bad as the original) we need even more."
13429,At least this isn't the flu.
13430,The flu mutates so far that even 100% wouldn't work.
13431,Still worth getting a flu shot though.
13432,"As I wrote — Israel doesn't block the passage of vaccines purchased by the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, or donated to them, so the fact that ""Israel controls the borders"" has no practical relevance to the Palestinians' ability to obtain vaccines, and certainly doesn't somehow magically make it Israel's responsibility to buy vaccines for them."

13465,This is a bit misleading - the article says that they’re fully enrolled and waiting for data.
13466,So is the “few weeks” when they’re going to apply for 12-17?

13468,Maybe if you believe everything CNN tells you.
13469,Interesting I contact trace any confirmed student that was at school during their infectious period and interview all staff that has been in contact.

13472,The busses have been close contact gold mines.
13473,They aren’t though.
13474,They literally opened up eligibility for 1b and 1b+ on the same day.
13475,"That included a bunch of frontline workers, people with at risk conditions, and those working in service industries."
13476,"Teachers shouldn’t have priority over the other groups, so I think it’s simply an oversight in the system."
13477,"For reference I was eligible for over a month before I could find an appointment, because all the available slots were left for teachers, which clearly means they don’t need them if there were 5-6 open every day for a week when if you select another criteria, it shows no openings for 5 days."
13478,Riddle me that.
13479,China caused the pandemic because they eat wild animals and keep them in unsanitary conditions.
13480,More over they lied to the entire world and pressured the WHO to play along.

13486,there has been zero intuitive about the policy making since January and the vaccine rollout.

13488,My boyfriend wants it to be really easy no appointment necessary.
13489,He says he'll get it once he can just walk into a place and ask for it.
13490,He's a bit privileged honestly considering most of the world has no access to these vaccines like Americans do.
13491,Apparently a lot depends on age &amp; how reactive your immune system is or if you had covid before but maybe didn't know it.
13492,"You end up as immune either way as it takes 2 weeks to get full immunity but some peoples systems hit the panic button and young people have stronger reactions, or if you've had it before it can ramp up to a strong reaction faster."
13493,"Not a doctor, just what I've read from various people claiming to be doctors online."

13506,It jumped out at me because I’ve long been frustrated by how diligently older folks turn out to vote while younger folks seem to take a while to get going.
13507,I ponder what things would be like if 80 % of 20 year olds voted and only 20% of 80 year olds voted.

13514,The person that said they're going to wait because they don't feel like Covid is much of a threat to them personally has that same right.
13515,I'm saying that downvoting because people disagree is what this sub needs less of.
13516,I'd love to see someone start gathering data to see if there's any discernible rhyme or reason to how people react to the vaccination.
13517,I'm a 36 year old male in good health.
13518,I got absolute devastated by the second shot (felt nothing with the first - hardly even a sore arm).
13519,I got it around 3 PM and basically felt fine the rest of the day - maybe a bit out of it?
13520,Or could have just been the power of suggestion.
13521,"Either way, I went to bed at midnight thinking to myself ""Well, was hoping for some mild symptoms at least so that I could take a free day off tomorrow, but oh well...""  Then a few hours later I wake up with chills, sweats, body aches, nausea, etc."
13522,I go downstairs and just trying putzing around on my computer for a few minutes but basically felt like I was gonna keel over after about 20 minutes.
13523,Went to lay down and barely was vertical again the rest of the day.
13524,Had a 101 fever periodically through out the day.
13525,Was genuinely the sickest I've been in my adult life.
13526,"Fortunately by the next day it had mostly subsided, and then by the third day I was back to normal."
13527,"Some of my guesses about why it rocked me so hard:  1) Pollen season, so maybe the fact that my allergies were already getting hammered factored in here and/or 2) I haven't had the flu in nearly 30 years so maybe my body just didn't cope well to the immune response."
13528,Pure speculation though.
13529,I’m planning on going out 12 days after my second shot too.
13530,I can’t imagine the 2 days make a massive difference

13532,"During his visit with Biden this weekend, and after his call with the CEO of Pfizer, Prime Minister Suga, said they should have enough doses for all Japanese citizens over 16 by the end of September."
13533,The fact that the only vaccine they've approved is Pfizer has limited their supply and made for a disaster of a roll out.
13534,"Now they're considering having dentists administer shots, just to have the ability to administer all the shots needed."
13535,Which vaccine does Publix give?
13536,I was perfectly fine after my second moderna shot while my mother and younger sister struggled the day after.
13537,"For me personally, I think it was taking a multivitamin, extra vitamin D, zinc, and drinking electrolytes a few hours after my shot that allowed the next day to be okay!"
13538,Doesn't help that their current leader is also an abject moron.
13539,Oh it's now anti-vax for people to ask whether or not they would be medically affected by a drug in the market?
13540,&gt;Only a matter of time before you are required to have at least one of the vaccines.
13541,"Man, it's almost like those ""anti-vax conspiracy theorists"" were onto something about people wanting mandated vaccination for every minor facet of life even though all the data we know about COVID would support absolutely none of it."

13565,"Again, maybe it happened, but I'm pretty cynical at this point."
13566,The sad state of the world is that many people do NOT distinguish anecdotes from evidence and that is why we are in the situation we are in right now with idiots refusing to get vaccinated.

13570,"I love that I got Covid a week before I was eligible to get the vaccine, good to know that if the virus was actually way deadlier than it currently is, my luck would have totally fucked me."
13571,The vaccine you need is the first one you can get.
13572,"If you're in the US that's going to be Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson &amp; Johnson."

13595,I quite active on /r/running and I read stories many stories from smokers who realized how bad their shape is when they start training and eventually they stopped smoking because they started training.
13596,So I believe that if someone is obese and training regularly it is a transition period in many cases.

```The percentage of those who were consistently meeting PA guidelines was lower among those with chronic diseases (including obesity) and those who smoked.```

13638,1.
13639,This was recommended during early 2020 when PPE supply were insufficient and Healthcare workers had to reuse.
13640,Paper bag  were used as storage because it would allow humidity to escape and dries the mask off.
13641,Water and humidity are terrible for these N95 masks because they rely on electrostatic charge to plug small particles out of the air.
13642,"2 days should be sufficient, it used to be 3 days but we understand the virus better"
13643,Provided the vaccines work against the Indian variants.
13644,I find this hard to believe Sweden is full of wankers.
13645,"No, thank you."
13646,Smallpox and Polio are both unusual in having no animal reservoirs.
13647,That means they are actually candidates for eradication via vaccine.
13648,We succeeded with smallpox and are very near to the end of polio.
13649,We have never been able to eradicate a disease which lives in other species as reservoirs.
13650,So it is very unlikely Covid will go the same way as polio and smallpox.
13651,"That doesn't mean it will remain a pandemic, but it is likely to become endemic and continue to kill people every year, perhaps as many as the flu, hopefully less."
13652,"So not the same end game as Polio and Smallpox, but also not a nightmare scenario."
13653,"This will probably mean nothing for the EU coming months, but it’s impressive how things have turned around vaccine wise."
13654,"A couple of months ago, many believed that people had to wait until the end of this year to be vaccinated, now it looks like the vast majority of the EU will have had their first shot by end of June."
13655,These extra doses will give the EU some security if AstraZeneca and possibly J&amp;J are restricted in use.
13656,"If you’re just walking your dog outside, why bother?"
13657,It just shows how fucked up the healthcare system is in the US.
13658,"I too knew plenty of “health care professionals” (aka nurses) that spouted a bunch of bullshit, because they were lucky enough to only get an asymptomatic case."
13659,That's not a ban on the vaccine.
13660,"Quote:

&gt; Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation, said that adults aged 18-29 years who do not have an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk from serious disease should be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine in preference to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, “where such an alternative vaccine is available.”

Basically it means if an alternative vaccine is available, offer that vaccine, otherwise, offer AstraZeneca."
13661,"And given our dwindling vaccine stock and what little Pfizer and Moderna we've ordered, we'll likely offer AZ anyway."

13663,"Given that we basically curb stomped the flu this year, yeah, I hope people consider masking if they don't feel well in the future."

13839,It's appalling.
13840,You know who you are when I'm talking to you.
13841,Fuck all of you collectively.
13842,Me too.
13843,"But all government are about the same, they’re not better or worse."
13844,They’re much better in many respects and not so much in others.
13845,You can have it.
13846,"I want a vaccine, just not this one."
13847,Thanks.
13848,Oh wow.
13849,Talk about everyone who wants a vaccine being able to get one.
13850,I bet more than half of Alaska's population is fully vaccinated but I could be wrong.
13851,Hopefully it goes smooth for you.
13852,I know some of the nurses at my work said the 2nd one hit pretty hard for a day or 2.
13853,They might be wrong at large but right in the instance.
13854,I have had friends (who are vaccinated) express the same.
13855,It's very logical that many people who aren't vaccinated might feel that too.
13856,I think Fosum Pharma in China invested into Biontech early into last year so they have access to MRNA technology.
13857,I think they are slowly ramping up production.
13858,That makes sense.
13859,That's supposedly why the second dose makes you feel worse - because your body recognizes the threat already.
13860,they should see a cardiologist about that
13861,How did she get it?
13862,Don’t you need a California drivers license to get it or just a passport?
13863,I thought it was new Zealand?
13864,And the homeless too.
13865,I watched something on how the Johnson &amp; Johnson is useful for volunteers to use on the homeless since it takes a lot of work to keep track of who's had a first dose.
13866,"I'm a liberal so I understand the ""Except those super Christian conservative types"" snark, but I gotta say: I know for a fact (meaning, direct knowledge) or se very left-leaning private and public schools who also have hesitancy about it."
13867,"The right might have its facebook-science conspiracy nuts, but we have our anti-big-medical-conglomerate nuts all the same."
13868,"Some things I found helpful - heating pad for fever onset (got super cold really suddenly), books/shows/games to distract you, Gatorade, soup and Ensure (appetite has been shot so the broth and nutrition drink really helped me not starve ha), and I rubbed the injection site a lot and the arm pain, while still present, isn't nearly as bad as the first dose."
13869,and thank you!
13870,I hope it isn't rough on you.
13871,😊
13872,"I've never had a flu shot in my life, but I was chomping at the bit to get my COVID one."
13873,"Anecdotal, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was a much, much greater interest in COVID vaccines."
13874,It's a big deal to me.
13875,"The odds of me being vaccinated (two weeks tomorrow), and giving it to another vaccinated person, and that person dying of it is exceptionally low."
13876,Less deadly than the Flu low.
13877,I don't like people acting like it's no big deal and I have no plans of masking up every Flu season.
13878,Lol.
13879,Me too!
13880,I'm in Toronto so that's just 95 miles from here.
13881,Looking forward to visiting friends and family in the US too.
13882,I understand why you asked but it’s a stupid question.
13883,I’m not a policy setter nor a statistician.
13884,Your question is just meant to derail things.
13885,The closest star is almost 400x farther away than the moon.
13886,"All other stars are much, much farther away than that."
13887,It’ll be done by the end of the month.
13888,"Yeah, the almost 1 in 100 chance of death from Covid (and risk over the past year approximately 1 in 1000 for Europe's or the US's  entire population) vs. 1 in 1,000,000 chance of death from the J&amp;J vaccine are held up by so many nuts as basically equivalent."
13889,Boggles the mind.
13890,Must be nice.
13891,Wish my country kept its fucking vaccine manufacturing facilities...🇨🇦
13892,Pity the us handled the thing so badly they were desperate for vaccines so they can’t afford to export it.
13893,Bragging about the vaccinations because you had to vaccinate out of desperation is pretty sad.
13894,I don't believe the 20-somethings are hesitant.
13895,"They just have not been afforded the opportunity until...tomorrow, for the most part."
13896,&gt;More than 80% of the elderly aged 60 years or older received the first dose in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
13897,This formulation makes me assume that they might be delaying the two doses.
13898,Yet the cases are still falling.
13899,"Well, 55+ is statistically the most likely to have STIs, so it depends on your definition of safe"
13900,We gave it to the most vulnerable people first.
13901,My 82 year old mother didn't hesitate for a moment when they offered a pop-up in her retirement community.
13902,"And now that the age range in Florida lowered, the community had a second pop-up (it's a 55+ place)."
13903,So now the majority of the entire neighborhood is vaccinated and they can start doing bingo again.
13904,"And soon weekly coffee club, etc etc."
13905,"Now mind you, were in one of the blue islands in Florida's sea of red, so that helps..."
13906,But these people are ready to get back to being able to do things.
13907,"""Tell people that vaccines only help prevent deaths and hospitalizations""

&gt;ONLY

&gt;Only

&gt;OnLy

You just made that up."
13908,I have NEVER heard that once.
13909,God why do I visit this fucking sub.
13910,I would ask your doctor.
13911,"Obviously, my generalization incorrectly classifies your situation."
13912,"However, the commenter said hundreds of thousands of AZ doses are about to be spoiled in Canada...I don't think everyone in Canada has a low platelet count."
13913,Take a look at his profile.
13914,He's one of the anti-vax conspiracy types.
13915,He did????
13916,That means we’re a lot closer than we think.
13917,[deleted]
13918,I think it's they are going to release guidelines for testing if a clot happens and provide proper treatment protocols since it's a different type of clot.
13919,I got my first dose on Saturday and I wasn’t told which one I got until after it was in my arm!
13920,"(Ohio)

I knew it wasn’t gonna be J&amp;J."
13921,Turned out to be Pfizer.
13922,It would be an asymptomatic case.
13923,"You can have symptoms early on, that then go away and you die (presumably with new symptoms) 1-2 months later."
13924,It's quite strange to be asymptomatic at the start and have this happen though.
13925,"Perhaps they were not actually asymptomatic, or perhaps the deaths were not (directly) caused by COVID."
13926,"I haven't seen ages on these cases, but wouldn't be surprised if they were all nursing home residents."
13927,"3 COVID deaths in 700,000 people in one(?)"
13928,month is about [0.6%](https://www.google.com/search?q=3+%2F+%28700000+*+.0084+%2F+12%29+*+100&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00XNUR3ExWWLau5k-LkNPo0nc9uCQ%3A1618792094635&amp;ei=ns58YK2QJpvXtAaqrorQDA&amp;oq=3+%2F+%28700000+*+.0084+%2F+12%29+*+100&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsANQ9ocFWPaHBWDeiAVoAXACeACAAcEBiAGZApIBAzEuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit14--honwAhWbK80KHSqXAsoQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5) of the total deaths among an average-age cohort (the US has about 0.84% annual mortality).
13929,With such a small number in a large haystack it becomes really hard to get any kind of certainty.
13930,If it's not an average-age cohort (obviously) then the ratio is even larger.
13931,This is highly location specific.
13932,"In my area, you cannot get an appointment at a pharmacy unless you are willing to drive over an hour to a rural area."
13933,The only way I was able to get mine was by signing up at a max-vax site which was still an hour drive
13934,Easy to do when you have the capacity to manufacture the vaccine and then prohibit export of it🤷‍♀️ plenty of places would love to prioritise vaccinating but they can’t.
13935,"Call *me* cynical, I think once kids get out of school every one who is eligible to get a vaccine who wanted one will have one, kids won't be subjected to transmission, let the refusers get their herd immunity for us."
13936,"Protect ourselves, let them get sick, by the time school is back in session *then* there will be herd immunity."
13937,"Moderna #2 for me tomorrow and we sound very similar; though I'm obviously excited to get it, it's still like ""signing up to feel like shit for a couple days."""
13938,🙃😔 Hope you feel better soon!
13939,i wish that were the case in canada.
13940,"Crazy how the us, a third word country or failed state as I repeatedly hear it referred to, is able to put to shame essentially every country in regards to vaccine distribution."
13941,Europeans especially should be ashamed of themselves.
13942,2 masks is so dangerous.
13943,3 masks or bust
13944,Agreed.
13945,"Lol

In their defense, I think they just freaked out because they had been so careful and not know how they could have gotten it."
13946,You can't compare efficacy results between trials ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A)).
13947,"There are people who are in high risk groups that are difficult to reach as well that benefit from a one dose method (homeless, for example)."
13948,Also as we're seeing with the UK even a 'less efficacious' vaccine is curbing results.
13949,"If it takes a helicopter, a track through ice and snow, how likely were these villagers from getting Covid-19?"
13950,I mean their practically self isolating.
13951,Nor is Australia or New Zealand.
13952,But not because we’re vaccinated.
13953,Some countries were so dumb they had to be head of the queue
13954,"In New York, a huge amount of people that I see wear a mask."
13955,I've stopped wearing mine outdoors because I'm vaccinated and we have to stop wearing them someday.
13956,Haven't been called out on it yet thankfully.
13957,[removed]
13958,Lol.
13959,There's no point in shutting it off AFTER you're already infected.
13960,Could you point me to the link which ranks these?
13961,I can't seem to find it.
13962,I don’t know about six months or however long but I agree that masks are incredibly easy and effective and should be kept for now.
13963,It’s upsetting how many people are selfish and irresponsible about that though.
13964,"8x higher chance of blood clots from covid, than from a vaccine."
13965,So.
13966,"I hear you that you are sick of it, so my real question is *why are you here posting?"
13967,"* What does this subreddit offer you, now that you are ""done?"""
13968,"I understand that you are over all this IRL, so why do you come back here?"
13969,"You are like a whipped dog that returns to its master's hand, over and over."
13970,"You claim you are ""done"" but you can't stay away."
13971,Jyaaaaansen
13972,I think you may be setting yourself up for disappointment if you think more than a small handful of people will continue doing this.
13973,Hope it works for effexor
13974,Probably need time off of work to get it.
13975,"(Might be able to take a sick/vacation day, but not everyone has those.)"
13976,Look at figure 7.
13977,There is a second spike in March/April
13978,I don’t think this has anything to do with the governor ... everyone in phase 1b should have had the same opportunity to get an appointment.
13979,"And no, teachers are not more essential."
13980,Yea it’s probably just because that’s how they conducted their study but the point stands.
13981,"We obviously still need to wear masks but after a couple of weeks from your first dose you should feel much safer about going out to a restaurant, bars, etc."
13982,I turned 21 in March but didn’t get my second shot till two weeks ago so I couldn’t go out and celebrate.
13983,Going out to eat for the first time in a year and a half and having a beer in public for the first time this past weekend was so awesome.
13984,I can’t wait until we’ve got this all under control and return to some form of normal.
13985,[removed]
13986,"Just fly back, get your shot, and go wherever you want lol."
13987,This is good news.
13988,A poll I read back in October showed Black Americans being significantly less likely to willing to get the vaccine.
13989,What makes you so sure your child is at extremely high risk?
13990,"There have been ZERO deaths in the 5-15 age bracket, look at the provisional death counts chart on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm) and notice how that age bracket is missing."
13991,"Most lump all the data together (such as the table at the top) as 0-17, but this chart breaks it down further."
13992,"The fact is the risks of this virus are highly stratified by age, and that includes children with comorbidities."
13993,Children this young even having symptoms at all are the extreme outliers.
13994,"Yeah, no statement on when  Moderna is even going to submit for an EUA."
13995,"Since the original SARS epidemic, the location of ACE2 receptors and the disruption had been well studied giving a roadmap of key areas for investigation."
13996,"By February 2020, I had already seen several case studies and investigations into impacts on the testicles, sexual dysfunction, and reproductive harm all showing that the virus was infecting these tissues and causing damage."
13997,The problem is that these were reports out of Asia.
13998,"There's a huge anti-Asian bias in science and medicine, often defended by repeating old outdated claims of plagiarism."
13999,"Beast Mode interviewing Fauci was fun to watch, especially when he started cursing and Fauci didn't skip a beat."
14000,We just signed up this morning.
14001,We're scheduled for our first vaccines on Wednesday at a Walgreens about 50 mins away.
14002,We're happy to get it.
14003,"Well I can't answer that, but I can look at the example of Israel."
14004,About 56% of the population is vaccinated and they are now at about 2 new cases per 100k people per day.
14005,"In the US, about 26% of the population is vaccinated and the Covid case rate is at about 20 new cases per day per 100k people."
14006,"Unfortunately, the US numbers are increasing."
14007,Note that even in Israel they are still requiring masks in public indoor areas.
14008,They are just allowing people to now go maskless outdoors.
14009,Is it ok to get your second dose (of the same vaccine) at a different location?

14032,Wait what?
14033,Checked it using the Canadian vaccine dashboard and the EU-wide vaccine dashboard.
14034,"Because the EU dashboard only gets updated twice a week (on Thursdays and Tuesdays), you have to compare it to Canada's Thursday figure."
14035,"So that's 9,205,307 doses administered in Canada on a population of 38 million."
14036,"And 103,457,179 doses administered in the EU on a population of 450 million."

14068,"&gt; At the green level, jurisdictions are on track for containment so long as they maintain maintenance levels of viral testing (i.e."
14069,"this is not a reference to antibody testing) and contact tracing, sufficient to control spikes and outbreaks."

14071,"elective surgery), or requirements of disease surveillance programs."
14072,It is not enough to get to green; one also has to plan to stay green.
14073,"&gt; At the red level, jurisdictions have reached a tipping point for uncontrolled spread and will require the use of stay-at-home orders and/or advisories to mitigate the disease."
14074,"&gt; At yellow levels, there may be some initial community spread."
14075,"At orange levels, community spread has accelerated and is at dangerous levels."
14076,"At both yellow and orange levels, jurisdictions can make strategic choices about which package of non-pharmaceutical interventions to use to suppress the disease."

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV."
14091,"The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported""."
14092,"* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals."
14093,* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group.
14094,"The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17."
14095,I look forward to the South Park character that Matt and Trey are going to model after Michael Osterholm in the near future when things calm down more.
14096,That’s how I’ll know normal is back.
14097,"I'm willing to do it, paid or not, so long as they monitor and take care of any side effect."
14098,"The virus isn't all that deadly for the people in my peer group, and we need to learn more about how it spreads."
14099,The nuances will allow for much better guidance on how we behave and allow for normalcy to resume sooner.
14100,I'd like to see exactly that level of specificity from a public health official.
14101,"We don't need the date it'll happen, but knowing numbers is plenty."
14102,Why isn't there any sort of punishment for this sort of negligence?
14103,Its due largely to J&amp;J
14104,It doesn't matter what restrictions are lifted.
14105,A good number of people will be vaccinated and no longer care by then.
14106,Myself and most people I know included.
14107,I live in Germany.
14108,There is no plan and we'll probably never even enter step 2.
14109,"By the time the general population has been vaccinated, they will have already started boosters."
14110,"Then we'll all have to ""be patient"" while they take another 12 months to get everyone the booster, at which point the *next* booster will be ready and guess what everyone will need before it's safe to be outside your house after 9pm?"
14111,Thanks for the website!
14112,I would prefer the Pfizer so maybe I can use this to target that.
14113,For me nothing available outside a 50 mile radius for any type though
14114,That third Pfizer dose is still theoretical and all about variants.
14115,"Of which, no variant would require a booster at this point."
14116,So something would have to change.
14117,"It's possible, but unlikely for those who can build robust response from their first series."
14118,"My family spans the political spectrum, and all pretty much treat the covid risk the same."
14119,"Mask responsibly, but get on with life and get vaccinated, ASAP."

14121,That's quite literally how RNA viruses work.
14122,RNA can also be transferred between cells in extracellular vesicles similar to lipid nanoparticles.
14123,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-020-0251-y
14124,Most of the drop is due to J&amp;J
14125,Curious how much anti-vaxxers stuff there is out there in the uk?
14126,I imagine with Boris pushing the vaccine means that the anti-science folks are getting shouted down by both the center-left and center-right?
14127,That 95% at 50+ is phenomenal.
14128,"Asian nations will probably get there because they trust their government on public health, but that's better than I expected for a country similar to my own in temperament."
14129,Maybe the widespread support the public has for the health care system too?
14130,Hospital bed capacity can be a misleading statistic of the actual strain on hospitals though.
14131,I know during the peak of the surges in Tennessee they never exceeded 80-90% of bed capacity because there were plenty of places to put people but not enough staff to properly take care of all the patients.
14132,Exactly
14133,It’s hard for me to believe this story because it’s at least the fourth time during the pandemic that the media has published the same exact story.
14134,"Usually they do it as propaganda at certain times, like during spring break."
14135,None of the other times were accurate.
14136,"Checking current data, this time doesn’t seem to be accurate either."
14137,I just don’t know what they’re trying to propagandize against.
14138,He's creating resent me to a group of people based on their political affiliation.
14139,"https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/study-many-long-haul-covid-19-patients-were-asymptomatic-during-initial-infection

It has limitations, but so do all studies that exist on Long Covid."
14140,[deleted]
14141,Isn’t an employer asking you to prove something medically related a HIPAA violation?
14142,I genuinely do not know and I’m to lazy to look it up.
14143,We've had these for several months in Germany.
14144,You can buy them for about 5 euros per test.
14145,Or in Berlin you can go to a test center and have one done for free each day.
14146,You get an email 20 minutes later with the result.
14147,A negative result from a test center is required to go shopping.
14148,Grocery and drug stores don't require the daily test.
14149,&gt;	The numbers add up to well over 100% because NZ has a much longer history of racial mixing than the US with far more people having two or more races.
14150,This is just not true.
14151,Those numbers add up to more than 100% because of the way the questions are asked.
14152,"While “racial mixing” may have been frowned upon in the US, it still happened all the time from before the country’s inception"
14153,"&gt;He's categorizing people based on how they voted and them pointing the finger more at one side

where does he say that?"
14154,it seems like you're implying something he didn't say...
14155,"But vaccine + mask = pretty damn good chances I won’t get sick until vast majority are vaccinated, right?"
14156,10-12 weeks is the standard dosing interval for AstraZeneca here in Italy.
14157,"Pretty sure it's the same in the UK and throughout Europe, at least for this vaccine."
14158,Pfizer/Moderna shots are instead given with a 3-4 week dosing interval here.
14159,"Okay, but we agree that anyone be divisive, and when someone is divisive we should call them out on it, rather than deflect and blame someone else."
14160,[removed]
14161,Recent data is suggesting that Michigan's surge has already peaked and that cases will be going down soon.
14162,"If this is true, we've witnessed the end of COVID surges in the United States."
14163,How often do you test your kids?
14164,"Israelis massively outbid everybody else for the Pfizer vaccine, and effectively sold out their citizens medical records to Pfizer, in exchange for priority access."
14165,"Otherwise, vaccine production is hard, there is a limited amount of production to go around the world right now, and ramping up new production facilities takes time."
14166,People are far too critical off the vaccine rollout worldwide right now.
14167,"Yes, there are issues going on that can be individually targeted."
14168,"But overall, the fact that we have many countries approaching 1/4 of their population having received a vaccine, less than 6 months after it was first approved, and less than 2 years after development of the vaccine started, is a pretty amazing accomplishment."
14169,Viruses do this all the time.
14170,In healthy processes it’s your own DNA that is transcribed to RNA which I cannot explain like you’re 5 because it’s a little more complex than that.
14171,"The resentment was already there, so this changes nothing."
14172,"the title of this post says ""prepare to party""..."
14173,"I doubt it, not at least for another year."
14174,Would be great tho.
14175,"I ate extra healthy, didn't drink, and drank a ton of water for three days prior to getting the second shot."
14176,Kicked my ass regardless and semi ruined my weekend.
14177,Nobody knows the precise number.
14178,"It requires knowing the R0 of the virus, which depends upon which variant is being discussed, and the efficacy of the vaccine, which depends upon the variant being discussed."
14179,"There are too many unknowns and its very possible to reach herd immunity now, but lose it later due to mutations."
14180,"What may be more useful is to set thresholds based upon cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and test positivity."
14181,Vaccines push all of those metrics down and they are start really matter.
14182,I think it'll be interesting to see these numbers if/when the pause is lifted.
14183,"The vaccine has still been produced and delivered, right?"
14184,So there should be a glut of them all over the US.
14185,"Walk-ins will finally be possible, for people who can stomach the one in a million risk."
14186,Because no state or municipality hasn't relaxed restrictions to some degree.
14187,um how so?
14188,"Fair enough, but he definitely wasn't underplaying the dangers of COVID such as comparing it to the flu as OP claimed."
14189,That is not necessarily the case.
14190,Long Covid may be the result of the body’s immune response (or over response).
14191,We just don’t know.
14192,Thank you.
14193,"Admittedly, I didn't understand this at first, but once I did, it's a huge pet peeve of mine."
14194,Especially coming from a source that should know better.
14195, Bummer to see the rates go down like this.
14196,We need to do a better job “selling” the vaccine to the younger demographic.
14197,"Compared to cases rising for four weeks straight, yes an incredibly slight decline is significant news."
14198,It straightforwardly shows that the upward momentum is gone.
14199,Ever take a math class?
14200,We're concerned less about the raw numbers on the graph and more so the slope.
14201,The slope turning negative is a good sign.
14202,[deleted]
14203,"One expert is not ""the experts."""
14204,"I mean, he's probably right, but there needs to be some consensus before it can become the official view."
14205,I should have looked before sending you the same link twice.
14206,"I thought it was a different poster, sorry."
14207,The map you shared has ok info but is deceptive.
14208,"It does not show hospitalization numbers, only cases and deaths."
14209,There are several states with no data for change in daily cases that shaded yellow instead of gray.
14210,"Aside from these, I enjoyed it."
14211,Thank you for sharing.
14212,I have no idea why you're bringing up unrelated laws as if you know my stance on them.
14213,You are completely welcome to explain how judging someone and deciding you know someone based on their religion isn't discrimination.
14214,Crazy idea but maybe it’s time to say if you are vaccinated then the mask is optional.
14215,Sure you may get some people lying about it but you also give people incentive to get vaccinated.
14216,We need to get less defensive about this
14217,I’m simply saying that the divisiveness was caused by one person.
14218,And trying to blame Fauci for the divisiveness ignores the elephant in the room.
14219,I am simply placing the blame where it belongs with no excuses.
14220,Of course!
14221,"I'm calling out this statement ""experts"" in the west were telling us that it was just the flu."""
14222,OP is claiming that western scientists were downplaying the seriousness of COVID.
14223,That simply isn't true.
14224,That's always been true.
14225,Many businesses have compulsory vaccination.
14226,It's completely legal to require employees to be vaccinated.
14227,"Most employers won't bother unless they serve at-risk populations, or put their employees at risk because it's a headache."
14228,They should consider incentives as giving employees a $100 bonus or something is way cheaper than losing productivity or paying out sick time for weeks.
14229,Maybe.
14230,Looks like we’ll need the 12-15 EUA to surpass Israel’s vaccination records.
14231,"People who had covid could be ""more immune"" to variants because they could have antibodies to more epitopes on the virus (I've been too lazy to check which protein(s) is expressed with the mrna vaccine, but iirc it's a spike protein they think is unlikely to mutate)."
14232,*Cries in Canadian*
14233,people are doing more not caring about the flu
14234,He's creating resentment from the country towards a group of people who voted a certain way.
14235,That is divisive.
14236,"Find your state here and take a look

https://www.vaccinespotter.org/"
14237,"From Belgium to Alaska, that's quite a trip."
14238,And what data did you use to base your opinion off of?
14239,Did you look at any studies looking at lockdown effectiveness in the continental United States?
14240,You must have formed that view from somewhere.
14241,Where did that view come from?
14242,I should have been clearer.
14243,"10-20 % unvaccinated people immune from their own disease + ...

Of course some people who got Covid will be vaccinated, too."
14244,"But among the unvaccinated, the share of people who can dodge Covid indefinitely is unlikely to be high, unless they live in an already highly vaccinated area."
14245,No worries!
14246,"Yes, and it is misleading."
14247,"Again, we have good, controlled studies in this over longer time spans, and the vaccines do really well."
14248,We don't need misleading statistics.
14249,Yeah I think the most recent headline I saw was 25% of Americans saying they would reject the vaccine.
14250,Still leaves us at 75% who would get it
14251,Same.
14252,And it’s been a detriment at times because I was vocal about my position and sentiment.
14253,"Word of caution, be careful how vocal you are about that in your workplace/during your career."
14254,[removed]
14255,"Check the weekly question thread on r/Covid19
I found it there."
14256,They are explicitly not checking citizenship or residency to avoid undocumented people being hesitant.
14257,"But unless you get J&amp;J (currently not approved), you would still have to wait around long enough to get both shots."
14258,Don't know why you get downvoted -- in some places it's near to impossible to get vaccinated.
14259,"Some dude wrote a script recently to find free appointments, just like those scripts that check if a PS5 is in stock somewhere."
14260,Do you think this comes down to conservative projections being met with pessimism?
14261,That's certainly what happened in Canada.
14262,"We always had a conservative projection of 89M doses by the end of September (~38M Canadians, ~30M adults) based on only Pfizer and Moderna, and that got distorted by politics into pessimism all around."
14263,"In the end we've consistently exceeded all targets and it looks like most people will have access to a first dose by the end of June, but really it's less to do with better news coming out than this being the plan all along."
14264,"I think the lesson is as impatient as we all are, these things take time."
14265,"Unless you have a special deal with Pfizer, you're the biggest economy on the planet and you've shut down exports, or you make your own vaccines, this is the time it takes."
14266,Because people are tired.
14267,Fauci never seems to take in that people will get tired and burnt out by this especially once the vaccines came.
14268,"To him we’re just numbers in a spreadsheet or something 

He’s a brilliant doctor but awful at understanding people."
14269,If he did he’d know this awful messaging only harms the vaccination efforts.
14270,It makes people ask “why bother?” If things aren’t changing
14271,Pretty sure it's called life
14272,Yeah majority I would hope.
14273,But I've seen gas stations in Iowa with signs stating to remove masks before entering.
14274,In a pandemic.

14278,I'm vaccinating at a mass vaccine site in OH.
14279,"One of the questions we have to ask is, ""Have you ever tested positive for Covid 19 or has a HCP ever told you that you had Covid 19?"""
14280,"I've vaccinated over 1,000 people so far and I'd estimate that only 5-10% have answered Yes to that."
14281,The vast majority that we're vaccinating have not had covid.
14282,It may be different elsewhere.
14283,I'm on the OH/MI border.
14284,remindme!
14285,2 weeks
14286,"That still only gets you a 50% chance, and you won't know if you get a placebo until after the trial."
14287,"&gt; We are not all children

About two weeks prior to this nobody could buy toilet roll because of panic buying."
14288,I can totally understand governments not expecting people to act rationally.
14289,"Even if we count half the people or even one million people, 5800 cases is tiny."
14290,Or they could just take the 1st shot and never come back for the second...lol

14292,They go to work sick and infect those around them.

14294,That’s wonderful news.
14295,"This might happen by July or even June here in DE – cannot wait to get the vaccination and so happy everything went so fast; even considering some of the fuck-ups, it’s amazing."
14296,"You don't need to be a citizen or have health insurance, but you usually have to show some connection to the state."
14297,Like a utility bill that shows you work there or a paystub showing that your employer is based there or like a school id.

14303,I see.
14304,I have met a few people like that Ive never been one though.
14305,Lol
14306,I'm not sure you transferred the efficacy to risk correctly.
14307,"The efficacy is understated to the general population, because initial trial participants were chosen specifically in geographic areas where exposure was predicted to be high."
14308,"In actuality, Moderna and Pfizer are PROBABLY much more effective than 90-95% to a random person at a given place in the country, because  the environment they were tested in is more like Michigan now than NM."
14309,This statement isn't a good one to make because there is nowhere on earth where the risk of being exposed is 10% right now.
14310,I think your Michigan stat is about an order of magnitude too high.
14311,And it is this kind of bs that is making me push hard for more workers rights.
14312,The lack of human decency in the workforce is astounding.

14317,Our 7 day moving average is actually down a touch from last week (3.4M per day on Tuesday vs. 3.2M per day today).
14318,"&gt;There's three drivers to this:

&gt;There was a delay in data release last Saturday which led to a ""bumper"" Saturday, artificially inflating the following week and creating a base effect headwind starting with yesterday's report

&gt;The JnJ vaccine hold is starting to filter into our numbers - even though though make only a tiny fraction of total doses administered, it is still a headwind

&gt;Demand issues are being hit in an increasing number of states that are also acting as a headwind"
14319,&gt; Do they actually remain fearful?
14320,My fully vaccinated friend still wears *two masks* outside.
14321,It's ridiculous.
14322,"""It makes me *feel* better"", was her answer to that"
14323,It's of course different for different people.
14324,"I got my second Moderna last week, and I only felt very mild flu symptoms."
14325,"I had muscle aches and occasional chills on the first morning, but with Tylenol I spent my day as normal."
14326,This.
14327,"We agree overall, absolutely."
14328,I’m just saying I disagree that it’s never been “cool”.
14329,People wear it as a badge of honor if they don’t take a sick day (or vacation days).
14330,It’s crazy the culture corporate America has created.
14331,Far too many people that “live to work” as opposed to “work to live”.
14332,They think it’s the coolest that they’ve sacrificed their literal life for a company.
14333,A company that could not care less about them as humans.
14334,Alex?
14335,actually Ontario is going to drop the age for AZ to 40 this week
14336,I had not read that.
14337,"Hopefully things will change...I just read now that they have decided not to export as many vaccines, so they can have better access."
14338,Things change so quickly!
14339,Thanks for the info!
14340,"9 days for me, excited too."
14341,Are we telling people what to think now?
14342,"I waited until my state opened up vaccine appointments to everyone here getting my first shot this past weekend, but I considered lying to get it early."

14350,Exactly.
14351,"COVID is here to stay, people need to get used to that."
14352,Vaccines will keep it mostly under control.
14353,People forget the Spanish flu is in fact the H1N1 strain of the flu and that bad boy is still circulating today.
14354,The goal is to get the chances of you getting it low and if you do not requiring hospitalization.
14355,There are also drugs that are being tested that will stop COVID in it's tracks if you get it.
14356,The idea that vaccines are the only tools we will have is naïve.
14357,"Life will return to normal guys, one way or another."
14358,"Also, people are so overdramatic with mask wearing on both sides of the argument."
14359,Most of us are wearing them if they are required.
14360,"Once they are not mandated and I am vaccinated (I am already), I ain't wearing that shit anymore."
14361,Anyone know any groups for school contact tracers?
14362,I'm overseeing contact tracing for 7 schools.I feel like we are doing pretty good however I would love to see how other schools are going about it maybe some tips tricks or new ideas.

14382,There are plenty of illnesses that prevent someone from working even from home.
14383,People working from home exclusively should also have sick leave.
14384,Just nervous I guess.
14385,I emailed my doc with some questions and he hasn't gotten back to me.
14386,That was just before the j&amp;j pause.
14387,"One question was, with a fish allergy, should I go with the j&amp;j over the mrna?"
14388,"I've never had a vaccine reaction, and I don't think I'd be allergic to anything in the lipid shell on those mrna vaccines, but an early story about a Dr in boston with shellfish allergy having a reaction gave me pause."
14389,"I know I will probably be getting it (my mom recently got pfizer), but without getting too far down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, I also don't like the pressure to get a vaccine when I feel there's so much lack of transparency with the origins of the virus."
14390,"I'm just overly cautious I guess, not anti-vaxx."
14391,"Have all my other vaccines, my kids do too (except hpv)."
14392,My understanding is EUA ends soon because it's been out long enough?
14393,That makes me feel better.

14395,"The vaccines are great, but that's very misleading for a bunch of reasons."
14396,"Example, a friend of mine became ""fully vaccinated"" a few days ago (two weeks after his second dose)."
14397,He's counted in that number of someone who is fully vaccinated and didn't get COVID because of it.
14398,Which makes no sense.
14399,"Lets assume that he got COVID the very second that he was considered ""fully vaccinated."""
14400,"Well, he would still count as someone who was protected from getting COVID, because two days is not long enough for the symptoms to show, then get tested, and for that result to be counted."
14401,"And again, that's if he got infected the very first moment."
14402,"Obviously, the short time scales we are looking at haven't allowed a lot of people to get COVID even if the vaccine did nothing."
14403,"Most people who are fully vaccinated haven't been so for very long, due to the time that it takes to become fully vaccinated and that daily vaccination numbers are higher now than a few months ago."
14404,"And that's not even taking into account other stuff like that the demographics of people who got early vaccines are different than the general population, etc."
14405,"In short, the better indicators of the efficacy of the vaccines are the trials themselves plus the big studies done in places like the UK and Israel."
14406,"All those show something like 90%-95% effective, and that is really, really great!"
14407,Actually; my math is simply death/population over course of pandemic so the chance of getting it is factored in.
14408,"IF a 55 m catches it, his chance of death is even higher."
14409,The main argument is that there is no risk with J&amp;J for that individual so no compelling reason to wait.
14410,These doomsday people are almost as delusional as the anti maskers
14411,I've read that it's realistically above 95%.
14412,"From what I understand the efficacy means that if you're in a situation where you would have 100% gotten Covid, you only have a 5% chance of getting it with the vaccine."
14413,Day-to-day there is likely more of a 60-70% chance of getting Covid than 100% so the chances of getting infected with the vaccine are even smaller
14414,I tried in the US.

14443,I'm just desensitized.
14444,Its also a mind fuck that I know the deaths are actually a higher number than that and I'm still not shocked.

14451,That's... not an accurate depiction of current knowledge of the vaccines.
14452,They're highly protective from getting COVID and spreading it.
14453,"They weren't 100% sure that was the case at first (though it was highly suspected), so you saw guidance like, ""treat it like you can still spread it and get it"" - and while you definitely still **can** (no vaccine is a magical virus shield), the chances of getting COVID when fully vaccinated are pretty damn low."
14454,"If you're hanging out with another fully vaccinated person, you're about as close to safe as you can be"
14455,I'm a woman under 30 in Poland and our government said nothing about it.
14456,They've planned to use Astrazeneca in all people younger than 70 years old.
14457,"So UK made a vaccine, claims it's safe but not uses in young people."
14458,Why?
14459,How could you spread covid if you can't be infected?
14460,The Gov handed them this loser (aka forced it on them).

14479,Because news organizations including the New York Times have portrayed a disease that kills 2-3% of people (weighted heavily to 65+) as the bubonic plague.
14480,Can you blame people for being scared when you are constantly telling them that their vaccines might not work against the variant of the week?
14481,Can you blame people for maintaining social distancing when you portray everyone who's seeing people after their vaccine as uncaring and selfish?
14482,"Tl;dr of the announcement -
1."
14483,"The central govt vaccine drive remains unchanged (age 45 and above, essential workers), utilising 50% of the stock from vaccine manufacturers
2."
14484,"Vaccine manufacturers can now supply the other 50% of their stock directly to state govts and private hospitals
3."
14485,"State govts and private players can utilise this to vaccinate anyone above 18 years
4."
14486,"Additionally the central govt may share some from its stock with states on a case by case basis, but the folks from point 1 above remain the priority for central govt."
14487,5.
14488,"Lastly, manufacturers will receive funds to ramp up vaccination"
14489,For sure.
14490,It remains to be seen.
14491,"However, the media has definitely been stoking the fear about variants and all that (whether that is a good or bad thing is not the point).."
14492,I can't imagine that the anti-vax crowd is significantly large.
14493,I think most people are eager and willing to get it.
14494,"If not, it will be what it will be, unfortunately."
14495,You can always try and get her into a trial.
14496,That’s really great to see!
14497,Hopefully the numbers keep increasing as we see more people get the vaccine with little side effect.
14498,The data still doesn’t support that it’s just conservative men though when there are quite a few factors fuelling anti vax and vaccine hesitant sentiment including socioeconomic status (education and income)
14499,Similar to the way you can still contract COVID after being vaccinated.
14500,But the idea that a previously infected person has the same odds of contracting it is just nonsensical.
14501,They are also far behind in vaccinations compared to rest of the Western world.
14502,"Unless COVID cases hit zero in your country/region/province, you should still be wearing a mask everywhere you go, and you shouldn't be taking it off in the presence of other people, or in a place that's had people but is badly ventilated

&gt;The United States is administering an average of 3.2 million doses a day, up from roughly 2.5 million a month before."
14544,"More than 131 million people, or half of all American adults, had received at least one shot as of Sunday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about 84.3 million people have been fully vaccinated."
14545,"&gt;
&gt;Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont were the last states to expand eligibility, opening vaccinations to all adults on Monday."
14546,"Nice, that's the dream."

14554,While I agree with you that it would protect others why do they have to get that vaccine to protect others?
14555,Why don't those others get the vaccine to protect themselves?
14556,As for things opening up a number of states have been running full tilt for months or weeks.
14557,Hell Texas numbers DROPPED after removing mask mandates and opening up to 100%.
14558,On the other hand you have states like California and New York  who have had harsh lock downs and more cases/deaths per capita than states like Florida who were open through the majority of everything.

14590,"I've talked to people about this, how there is basically going to be a social end to the pandemic by June/July for most people in the USA."
14591,"So many people will have been vaccinated that people will just stop following a lot of the restrictions, even in areas that have trended toward a heavier handed approach."
14592,"And you combine that with plummeting hospitalizations and deaths, nicer weather, the vast amount of Covid fatigue, etc."
14593,and I do not see mask mandates being realistically enforced beyond that point *in most situations*.
14594,"I add that caveat on at the end because I suspect that in some places where you have large numbers of people in a ""captive audience"" type setting (like, airplanes or big sporting events) there will be more effort to keep them in place in some areas for awhile longer."
14595,"But I don't think like, the local bar is going to keep enforcing them etc."
14596,"Good for you, just don't expect everyone else carry on wearing masks when it's no longer needed."
14597,Thanks for the reassurance!
14598,Imagine getting into Yale and then not going because you're Anti-Vax and can't take your head out of your ass.
14599,I have the same thing.
14600,I actually told the nurses beforehand and they put me in a back room to lay down.
14601,Good thing too because I clonked out like 10 minutes after I got it.
14602,I had the moderna shot and the side effects are stronger for the second shot.
14603,They kicked in about 10-12 hours later.
14604,It wasn't worse than what I usually experience when I have bad allergies and feel slightly cruddy.
14605,And I was feeling fine by the end of the next day.
14606,"I do know some people who had a worse time of it, so the side effects can be severe enough to lay you out for a day."
14607,"Still, totally worth it and I would do it again."
14608,India's population is so large compared to available vaccine stocks that we can easily go next six months with enough people lining up to take up all available doses even with all the anti vaxxers and covidiots excluded.

14615,&gt;	Like the “plan” to make Mexico pay for the border wall.
14616,"It’s technically a plan, but if someone said Trump had no real plan on how to pay for the border wall, even if they’re technically wrong, I would understand what they meant."
14617,The funny part is that initially the plan was literally to have Mexico write a check for a one time payment to pay for it.
14618,Later he walked it back and said they would pay for it through trade or tariffs or whatever it is he said.
14619,You have to schedule an appointment
14620,"Yes, there may be some side effects immediately after the shot."
14621,"Personally, I had a sore arm for about 36 hours after my first dose of Moderna."
14622,We'll see if I have anything else after my second dose.
14623,I haven't heard of severe nausea; I suspect that's not at all common.
14624,"But actually, I'm kind of looking forward to some brief side effects, if I have them."
14625,It's almost like a rite of passage.
14626,As for long-term effects--it's true that we don't know absolutely *everything* about these vaccines.
14627,But the mRNA technology (used in Pfizer and Moderna) has been under development since the 1990s.
14628,"Moderna entered clinical trials in March *2020*, over a year ago."
14629,"And almost a *billion* doses have been administered worldwide: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

More importantly--vaccines aren't like pills."
14630,They aren't a thing that you keep taking long term.
14631,That's one reason why long-term side effects are very rare with *any* of the vaccines out there.
14632,"According to vaccine scientist Deborah Fuller, PhD:

&gt; Fuller said the chances of long-term complications are extremely unlikely because of how vaccines work."
14633,"&gt; “Most of their job is done in the first few days, then the vaccine is gone from your body."
14634,"So what’s left is that immune response to the vaccine,” Fuller said."

14637,Yea I don't really think it'll happen for a simple vaccination but my mind goes wild leading up to those moments.
14638,It sucks and it's embarrassing.
14639,I'm sorry you have to deal with it also.
14640,"Ok so since this article is not really based on any data, let’s say that hospitals are now admitting everyone, like say the person has covid and are dehydrated or have mild fever, or just need some fluids, whereas before, those people were given some meds and sent home without being admitted."
14641,"Let’s just say that if we’re throwing around unfounded claims, we’ll all just jump on this and throw around our own unfounded claims."
14642,I spoke to the CDC and the best they could do is tell me I may have the same or worse or less severe of a reaction.
14643,So...they don't know.
14644,"They also gave me the link to their database to search on my own, but I can't make sense of what to search."
14645,Here's the link though https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8
14646,Fair point I think I did over simplify that a bit there.
14647,I do suspect the difference is more to do with their relative differences in the spikes they produce.
14648,But I'm not a vaccine expert by any means.
14649,"Nah, don't worry about it."
14650,There is a very very tiny chance.
14651,"Two weeks from the final dose is what I've seen as the definition for ""fully vaccinated""."
14652,"Practically, once I was ten days out from dose one I relaxed my behavior somewhat, since at that point you're pretty well protected according to the data I've seen."
14653,"Two weeks after shot two, I'll relax my behavior a bit more."
14654,I still won't be dining indoors until mask requirements are lifted locally.
14655,I expect that will be sometime this summer.
14656,But I'm back to outdoor dining and am less paranoid about masking outdoors.
14657,"Thats what the website for my state said, was that you needed an ID &amp; a form of some sort showing youre a resident here."
14658,Trump told me it wasn't a big deal
14659,Being dead is worse than not going to the pubs for a couple of weeks but that might just be me.
14660,Same with me.
14661,First shot I couldn't raise my arm more than a quarter of the way up.
14662,Second shot I did some exercise which may or may not have helped but the pain was minor and the next day I only felt minor exhaustion and a slight fever.
14663,"I’m just looking forward to the day when we can confidently say that 100% of the people that want to be vaccinated, are vaccinated."
14664,"From that point on, we start handing over the Darwin awards."
14665,I'm 14 years old and when I get the flu I'm usually out of school for 4-5 days.
14666,I imagine my reaction to Covid would be even worse.
14667,I know I won't die and that's not what I'm afraid of.
14668,I'm tired of people only assessing risk by if you will die or not.
14669,There is so much more that goes into it.
14670,"In short, I'd rather feel bad for 2-3 days than be sick for an entire week"
14671,"If you paid attention to what Dr. Fauci said at his most recent report to the government (where he was verbally attacked by an ultra-conservative), you might know."
14672,It's on Ytube.
14673,Check it out.
14674,"Y'know, it's childish to make a human decide what the universe has in store for us."
14675,"The virus could mutate into something mild, in which case it will be around for decades, or it could burn itself up by becoming more deadly and killing everyone it touches, in which case, it will be *gone*."
14676,How in the world would Dr. Fauci know which way this will turn?
14677,All he knows is that we need to vaccinate everyone we can as fast as we can.
14678,We'll need a booster shot in the Fall.
14679,As for the rest of it: prayer.
14680,We've been drinking ourselves silly in the park for the last 3 weeks.
14681,Everyone seems pretty happy except for owners of pubs without gardens.
14682,Thousands of athletes worldwide.
14683,I really don't understand why they wasted so many months before doing this.
14684,&gt; That study is suspect as well.
14685,"The main reason that this study is suspect is that is was done by the Oxford university, *the developer of the AstraZeneca vaccine*."
14686,Nice work
14687,J&amp;J obviously hired a PR firm... for obvious reasons.
14688,"Don't be honest, you might influence people in a way that I don't like."
14689,Link below suggests even those reinfected are leaa likely to spread covid.
14690,"&gt;Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p&lt;0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13)."
14691,If you use any fact checking site you will see the claim there was no plan is false.
14692,And there is nothing wrong with that.
14693,We should be happy that both presidents were competent when it comes to the vaccine.
14694,Same.
14695,It sucked but I got it done.
14696,No one is looking for IDs.
14697,go on the cvs website at exactly midnight -- extended family in Sacramento all got it that way
14698,[removed]
14699,"From looking at the Google vaccination tracker for Alaska, they seem to be pretty in-line with the rest of the country in getting vaccinated so far"
14700,think most places are still pretty fucked.
14701,think over here only pretty recently we opened up the general 60+ group to be eligible to get vaccinated.
14702,"This is probably ridiculous, but on the way out of CVS from getting my second dose of Moderna, I inadvertently inhaled some second hand smoke from someone smoking nearby."
14703,"I left quickly, but should I be concerned about Covid transmission?"
14704,"Again, I know this is probably ridiculous, but I’m just anxious since I literally just got vaccinated, and I would not like to get it after all of this."
14705,"This doesn't quite tell the full story - firstly, this is on NHS data and doesn't cover deaths outside of the NHS (care homes, at home etc."
14706,"), and secondly, there have always been fewer deaths recorded on weekends."
14707,Tomorrow's numbers on the UK dashboard will be more relevant: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/
14708,Thanks!
14709,Got my 1st Pfizer shot today.
14710,Gold standard!
14711,"yeah that’s a problem, one thing if u were ill and had a positive test, totally another when it’s “i’m sure i’ve had it, i had a cough last spring so i’m good”"
14712,My birth control carries a much higher risk than AZ.
14713,I'll take the first vaccine I can get.

14715,"A good rule of thumb to analyze variant news by is, the more they try to make it sound like an X-Men, the less worrying it actually is"
14716,He's actually completely correct.
14717,All I remember was him telling us to shove light and disinfectant up our collective asses
14718,Why?
14719,Why risk something that lasts for months over something that lasts days?
14720,Lol you think boomers are anti-mask?
14721,You should see my generation.
14722,"I'm surprised the ""moderator"" hasn't taken this post down, because""vaccine"" and ""politics"" are mentioned in the same sentence."
14723,"In any other posts, you could never mention the two together, or your comment would be removed."
14724,"On a related note, it makes me uncomfortable that they kept referring to him as Mr. Biden."
14725,14 days after your last negative test is what my pre vaccine checklist forms had me check.
14726,Dude free krispy kreme doughnut everyday for a year is the only motivation needed.
14727,You’ll be getting comments from people who will say “the pandemic is over!”
14728,[deleted]
14729,"And if they were medically certain they've have COVID in the last 6 months, I'm maybe onboard with the logic."
14730,"Unfortunately, I've heard so many people who say, ""I'm pretty sure I already had it."""
14731,"But, of course have no test results to prove it."
14732,Already had a place do that in the town I work in.
14733,"Last May or June, Local butcher shop in town posted on their Facebook page that you could not wear a mask in their store."
14734,Said too much risk of getting robbed and the person not having their face on camera.
14735,If people weren't comfortable with it they could order curbside.
14736,So people pointed out that they could still have employees wear masks if the issue was robbery chances.
14737,The post wasn't up very long but I think they have gotten a lot more health dept visits this year from the sounds of it.
14738,"On the other hand, I had no side effects at all after the second dose lol."
14739,Arm was sore for a little the day I got it but I felt great the next day
14740,Alberta too
14741,Something tells me that vaccine take up among some of the brightest humans isn't going to be too much of an issue.
14742,I feel your frustration.
14743,Hang in there!
14744,"My in-laws are scary trumpsters and were not planning to get vaccinated, but we said absolutely no way would they be able to see our kids in person unless we were all masked and outside for short visits."
14745,We held firm to that and they ended up both getting vaccinated.
14746,My mil texted me that it was okay because trump got vaccinated and so did Ivanka.
14747,"Um sure, just as long as you got it , Bubbie."
14748,"If I’m a duel citizen living in Canada, would I be able to go to the US to get vaccinated?"
14749,"&gt; Long terms risks (2+ years) are compeltely unknown at this point, and thats what i am most worried about."
14750,I really really hope there are none.
14751,This is an incredibly dumb argument.
14752,"We know there are long-term effects to COVID, so you're willing to take the chance on getting COVID instead?"
14753,If you're afraid of long-term effects you should absolutely get vaccinated.
14754,"&gt; Well the extreme short term risk seem to range anywhere from no side effects to dibilating nauseau for up to a couple days, so i would like to not risk that if at all possible."
14755,"""Extreme"" short-term effect is called your immune system working, and most people (like me in my 20s) had a mild sore arm and nothing more."
14756,"Lastly, you're missing the point that vaccination is meant not just to protect yourself, but those around you."
14757,"By choosing not to vaccinate, you're doing harm to others, mainly those who can't get vaccinated or are at risk regardless of vaccination (like people with organ transplants)."
14758,It's an incredibly selfish decision.
14759,I’m in observation right now after my second shot!
14760,April 19th fully vaxxed gang!
14761,Kamala Harris said so herself.
14762,But now it's a problem how?

14768,"My dad, 85 years old, was in the same boat."
14769,He got an event code like the first week that vaccinations opened to 75+ and in the hours between receiving it and trying to schedule everything was booked.
14770,He never received another event code.
14771,But he was able to arrange shots at his doctor's office which was much better than standing in line with his bad leg anyway.
14772,Or just staying home.
14773,Masks aren’t going to be a thing here anymore.
14774,Historical revisionism short term.
14775,Fay I was recently still saying wear mask social distance stay home even if vaccinated
14776,It's a commonly used phrase everywhere.
14777,General consensus seems to be Moderna has worse side effects than Pfizer for more people (but it varies of course).
14778,"I had Pfizer and symptoms were moderate but manageable the next day, and it was gone by the next morning."
14779,You forgot 5g
14780,I wonder how much higher this number would have been without Brexit.
14781,Thanks for sharing.
14782,"Interestingly, reinfections resulted in milder disease and lower viral titers, the latter suggesting lower risk of infecting others."
14783,"While we don't have the studies, it seems those reinfectes will be less likely to spread it to others, and so partially contribute to herd immunity."
14784,"&gt;Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p&lt;0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13)."
14785,Beeeeeeeeeer
14786,So much mixed public messaging from the get go on day 1 from the CDC.
14787,“Masks aren’t necessary”!
14788,"Oh yeah, it’s been around a month."
14789,Israel has as many (I think more) people under 18 as a fraction of their population than the US does.
14790,Israel also has natural immunity from people having had covid (though probably somewhat less than the US).
14791,"This is just an observation that, in that one country, cases plummeted after 50-55% of the total population were vaccinated."
14792,Nature’s vaccine definitely comes with a higher risk of side effects.
14793,A few minutes.
14794,To be fair my coworker sent me a link.
14795,"it doesn't seem there is a huge desire to get vaccinated (Philadelphia)

14910,"And according to [TheLawyerCraig](https://twitter.com/TheLawyerCraig/status/1383910550078324738) on Twitter, yesterday's 7-day average was the first week-over-week decrease in thirty days."

14929,That’s literally not even up for discussion here.
14930,They tested positive for covid and died due to complications of covid.
14931,The discussion is regarding when they were infected.
14932,What they died of isn’t up for debate.
14933,Maybe read the rest of the comment...

14942,does this also apply to tourists?
14943,"You missed the /s

I suspect the post is taking a pass at the many people who claimed (as late as late last week) that the only way for Michigan to control this surge was through a lockdown."
14944,I hope ppl start wearing masks when they get a cold like in many Asian countries.
14945,Is there a subreddit to discuss vaccine side effects?

14969,She went home on day 4 with no oxygen.
14970,She now has diabetes and COPD.
14971,"Dr told her that they don't know if her lungs will recover, or if her diabetes will be permanent."
14972,She is very regretful because she had many opportunities to be vaccinated because she is admin assistant to Fire department.
14973,She was fearful of mRNA and wanted the JJ.
14974,"Two weeks after she was hospitalized, her department had the JJ vaccines available."
14975,She's only 50 and she is very worried about her long term health from COVID.

14984,I walked down to my local Kroger's got jabbed in the arm and walked out in less than an hour.
14985,I spent more time getting ice cream afterwards.
14986,"A few weeks ago they actually talked about the media messaging, even admitting that at times the NY Times was maybe overly cautious or alarmist."
14987,I can’t remember the details but I think the science has been all over the place with this pandemic as it takes a while to figure out.
14988,Just read somewhere that people are forging vaccine cards so they can skip the first shot and go straight to the second.
14989,Just why?
14990,What is the perceived benefit?
14991,A bunch of New England states are set to cross 50% of their TOTAL population having received at least one shot soon.
14992,New Hampshire is already there.
14993,"Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Jersey, and Rhode Island should all hit that in the next few days."
14994,In the vast majority of cases the vaccine blocks infection completely.
14995,It usually goes in 2 ways.
14996,Either the pulmonary tissue regenerates or it becomes fibrous.
14997,"The first is good, the second, bad."
14998,Depends i guess by the virulence of the virus and managing the cytokine storm that accompany the illness.

15000,I’m here to get my super powers though.
15001,"&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe now that it's midnight on the west coast all adults in the United States are now eligible for a vaccine."
15002,"Not just the west coast anymore, everywhere in the US."
15003,They would be if the fearmongerers didn't suspend them over a few bad reactions which may or may not even be related to the vaccine.
15004,Nobody wants them now because they got suspended over literally a dozen or so blood clots.
15005,"Honestly, I don't see how they can conclusively make that case without testing asymptomatic kids on a regular basis."
15006,My fiancee's employer has an asinine policy of having to call out sick *48 hours in advance*
15007,I don't know about Australia but NZ didn't make any bad choices.
15008,We were one of the very first countries to negotiate deals with 4 different vaccine manufacturers.
15009,We secured deals for enough vaccines for 4 times our own population and a range of providers in case any one fell through.
15010,"But despite being the among the first to sign up, the manufacturers put us at the bottom of the list of the countries who got early deals."
15011,"There's nothing our govt did wrong to cause that outcome, nothing we could have done differently."
15012,We're just at the mercy of the manufacturers.
15013,It makes no sense to me especially since we know it's airborne.
15014,"Unless there's HEPA filtration, then any distance in a small poorly ventilated classroom is a risk."
15015,&gt; Vaccinated doesn’t mean you have any immunity at all.

15021,"I know people who have come to NC and gotten shots, but I can’t guarantee it would work."
15022,"If you are actually considering this, go somewhere where the supply is greater than the demand."
15023,Their vaccines really seem to be safe.
15024,"Not that I would trust anything coming from the CCP, but a few independent western institutions did some research with them too."
15025,Wow.
15026,That's very diverse.
15027,It'd be incredible for the US to have that many foreign born people.
15028,Maine opened up slots for teachers weeks ago so those that wanted to get vaccinated should be fully by now.
15029,Some might still be nearing their 2 weeks but I would be shocked if it is many.
15030,"Maine schools have been open for months and there have not been a lot of out breaks, there have been some, but very small clusters that get isolated quickly."
15031,Don't give a time estimate.

15057,Literally all it takes is enough people taking the vaccine and [the virus will die out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity).
15058,"Doesn't even have to be 100%, just enough (probably 75-80% of the population)."
15059,"Even with the more contagious variants, COVID-19 has a max R0 of like 5."
15060,We were able to eliminate endemic spread of measles which is just an incredibly contagious - an R0 of 12-18.
15061,COVID is not like the flu.
15062,It has limited animal pathways and it has a comparatively stable genome with a very defining transmission protein that can be targeted (the spike protein).
15063,Material vaccine escape is highly unlikely.
15064,People associate elimination with authoritarian lockdowns.
15065,"With vaccines, that isn't the case."
15066,We don't need lockdowns and we don't even need restrictions to eliminate the virus.
15067,We just need enough people to be willing to have a sore arm for a couple of days.
15068,"People in Philly who wanted them but weren't eligible went to Bucks or Delaware County to get them, I assume."

15079,It was such awful messaging to say that kids aren't really effected from COVID.
15080,"Sure their risk of serious disease is less than an elderly person, but there is certainly still a risk."
15081,I don't know why people are so shocked that the virus is spreading predominantly among a population that isn't vaccinated.
15082,I always cringe when I see parents with N95's on and then their kid with no mask.
15083,I simply do not understand some of the downvotes in this sub.
15084,"""We've vaccinated half of what we need right now, some places still have high rates, let's keep wearing masks for now"" is somehow equated to ""YOU HAVE TO WEAR MASKS FOREVER AND ALWAYS GAHHH""

15095,Long covid is not as wide spread as the internet would lead you to believe.
15096,Only around one third to half of people hospitalized have long covid as defined by having symptoms at least 6 weeks after onset.
15097,Let's look at that compared to the hospitalization rates of vaccinated people.
15098,Of the 5800/77 million that were infected while vaccinated only between 4 and 8% of those were hospitalized.
15099,That's 348 people.
15100,Of those 348 people 114 could be assumed to have long covid.
15101,"So, 114 out of 77 million means 0.00014% chance of getting long covid if you're fully vaccinated."
15102,"Where are you getting your data to back up that your 90-95% protection would be ""nearly completely eliminated"" by eating in a Michigan restaurant?"
15103,"I get that the risk would obviously be higher than eating in New Mexico, but to say your protection would be almost eliminated seems like a stretch."
15104,Fully vaccinated people can in fact spread the virus.
15105,"Definitely far less likely than if they were not vaccinated, but it’s possible"
15106,"Schools are a cesspool of every other sickness including the flu, but not this new, exceptionally contagious virus..."
15107,"Truly, I didn't listen to either and I'm not an anti-masker."
15108,Fauci was trying to manipulate us into alternately not taking the health risk seriously and now into taking it too seriously.
15109,We can be trusted with nuance.
15110,Imagine reacting to an article about Michigan ending a surge without a lockdown by handwringing about the fact that Michigan isn't instituting a lockdown...
15111,"The EU has exercised a contract option to buy 100 million more vaccine doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the total number of doses of this vaccine to be delivered in 2021 to 600 million."
15112,"That's not how that works, the 77 million people who were vaccinated were not all exposed to covid."
15113,When do you all expect the CDC to drop mask wearing from their guidelines?
15114,I'm not spreading misinformation.
15115,Yes they paid for what they received.
15116,But they also signed agreements that put them ahead of other countries due to the price of future shipments that they signed up for.
15117,They then didn't pay for the future shipments and pfizer halted what they had PLANNED on sending.
15118,Schools in Maine have been open for months and the majority of counties have been green the entire time.
15119,"Now and then an area will go red, but it doesn't happen often."
15120,"Schools for the most part, have been very safe."
15121,I assume skipping an “extra” needle and being “fully” vaccinated in 3-4 less weeks.
15122,Silly.
15123,"This is likely mostly people who just want to have it one and done, but don’t have the patience or want to put in the effort to get j&amp;j but the effort of sticking it to the man by doing this is well worth it."

15125,A relatively few nitwits.
15126,"""NZ and Australia were put at the bottom of the list"" is a particularly defeatist way of putting it that disregards all the agency those countries' governments had over the outcome."
15127,It's not like their allocation is reliant on COVAX w some central dictator decreeing who gets what.
15128,"Instead, how about, ""NZ and Australia made choices &amp; tradeoffs that drove the outcome they're experiencing."""
15129,Oh and they're not bottom.
15130,NZ at least will get all its citizens vaccinated this year.
15131,That's likely a lot better than many places...
15132,"""They can't lie to people for the greater good."""
15133,You mean like when they said we shouldn't wear masks last March because they were worried about the supply chain and healthcare workers not getting enough?
15134,"It's tough with a cold though - like yeah it sucks when you get one, but if it's not actually putting you out of commission it's hard to say ""I'm going to spend some of the little time I have off because of this""."
15135,Really the big change that needs to be made is that people can work from home in those conditions (assuming you work in a job where that accommodation is manageable).
15136,My job has it exactly backwards right now - I'm working from home 4 days a week and working on site 1 day a week.
15137,"If I'm not feeling well during that 1 day, I can't opt to work from home that day - I have to take the sick day."
15138,"For me, this is fine because I have plenty of sick time available to me."
15139,"But if I have a cold, or a runny nose or a sore throat, having to take the entire day off feels so silly."
15140,lol I can’t take you seriously then.
15141,You’re saying you think the state of Oregon will still have mandatory masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic 20 years from now?
15142,That’s absolutely absurd and you know it.
15143,"Nope, its fairly standard procedure."
15144,Called human challenge trials.
15145,"If anything its surprising this wasn't done to test any major vaccines and was a fairly big controversy, I even volunteered for a human challenge trial which ultimately never came to be."
15146,Cases will never hit 0.
15147,Ever.

15153,"I had the virus, my sister also."
15154,When we got the first Pfizer shot we both had a sore arm for a day or two and I felt a little fatigued for a day or so.
15155,That was it for us.
15156,We get the second shot in three days.
15157,I can't wait tbh.
15158,It will feel so great to be fully immunized!
15159,They aren’t flat.
15160,The cases were falling and still are
15161,I think it’s playing with fire to continue torpedoing education.
15162,But I understand where you’re coming from.
15163,"It just looks kids are the least likely to have severe (or even symptomatic) COVID, which is where you see most long-haulers."
15164,Maybe if you don't understand delayed gratification there's no reason?
15165,It takes time to vaccinate 300 million people.
15166,When we're ready as a country we can take the next step together.
15167,"Michigan is a cautionary tale that it's too early to just stop trying, and that ICUs will still fill up with younger people when the elderly are vaccinated."
15168,"Personally I'd rather my state not go down that road again, when an end is in sight just a few months from now."
15169,This more than masks or anything else.

15176,Then you don't know much about NZ.
15177,"The US is 77% White, 13% Black, 5% Asian."
15178,Of that population 14.4% are foreign born.
15179,"NZ is 71% White, 16.5% Maori, 15% Asian and 9% Pacific Islander."
15180,The numbers add up to well over 100% because NZ has a much longer history of racial mixing than the US with far more people having two or more races.
15181,"Also NZ is 27.4% foreign born, nearly twice the rate of the US."
15182,"I grew up in Boston and lived in Washington DC, two major US cities."
15183,The diversity in them was never close to what I see in Auckland every day.
15184,"Auckland is one of the most foreign-born cities in the world with 40% of the population being immigrants, the same rate as NYC and LA."
15185,Other news: Missing persons report have dropped by 50% as bill gates can now find anyone lost
15186,Take my experience w a grain of salt but my spouse and I both had bad cases of covid towards end of 2020 (I was hospitalized for 4 days).
15187,Our first shots kicked our asses.
15188,Our second shots were.. more mild than the first but the effects were much much longer.
15189,"&gt;  got my 2 shots of moderna, do I need to worry about if they refridged it and stored it properly or gave people the correct doses etc

They are on top of checking these things, if they were stored improperly the location would call you back to re-do your vaccination."

Glycan shielding allows spikes to be hidden if you look at pics of the virus like this (scroll down the study)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71748-7

You can see that bits of the virus will protrude from its glycan shielding."
15201,The antibodies target specific proteins on these spikes.
15202,If they become more hidden behind the shielding then the antibodies become less effective as fewer proteins are reachable.
15203,"""just another few weeks""
since march 2020"
15204,I think besides what has been said the US is still closed for tourists from various countries so that may be a hurdle for potential vaccination for tourists from some reasons.
15205,Also since most vaccines require two doses it may be two trips (pricey depending on where you are traveling from)
15206,"I'm in montco, and all your raw case numbers are just wrong."
15207,"You are misremembering and it's painting a worst picture to yourself than it really is, comparitively."
15208,I suggest you go to MontCos covid data hub.
15209,"Our peak over the holidays was 462.9 cases per day, using a 14 day average."
15210,Our lowest point between then and now was 110.6 cases per day.
15211,"We are at 226.1 cases per day, with now mostly flat growth currently."
15212,I swear to God Ill personally beat up covid 19 if the summer is ruined
15213,It's comments like this that makes me realize how the media did this vaccine dirty.
15214,"Let's break down facts only:  
1."
15215,"Everyone uses the argument that it was tested during more mutations, and while this is true this isn't even the main argument."
15216,Pfizer and Moderna have since been tested against the variants and have done well.
15217,So this is a moot point.
15218,2.
15219,"Page 94-96 in Janssen's report state that they reported their numbers after 28 days, that's where their the 66-72%, 85%, and 100% efficacy against mild, severe, hospitalization/death come from."
15220,"But if you continue to read these pages you see that after day 49 post-vaccine the numbers rise to 95%, 100% and 100%."
15221,The B and T cell response increases over time with just 1 shot.
15222,"49 days isn't that much longer than the 5 and 6 week wait for the 2 shot mRNA ones, and they have the same efficacy at that point."
15223,3.
15224,"On pages (24-27\* i think, let me verify in a second the exact page #s) they dictate what they classified as moderate covid... it included 1 or more symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues, coughing, sneezing, fever etc."
15225,Which is how the mRNA trials classified mild cases.
15226,So the metrics aren't exact.
15227,It's for the above reasons that you cannot compare the two\[3\] vaccines.
15228,"Thankfully the US has done a good job at administering vaccines in general, the current J&amp;J hold doesn't impact us as much because the mRNA ones are rocking out here."
15229,But it's not just about Americans.
15230,The J&amp;J one is critical to underdeveloped countries.
15231,So stop spreading misinformation or your bias as fact.
15232,Brings a tear to my eye!
15233,"It was never coo,l but always expected or required because it was too hard to get the days or you didn’t get sick days."
15234,What does it have to do with?
15235,I keep seeing this implicit assumption that some people want to artificially prolong the pandemic for...reasons?
15236,It’s never made sense to me.
15237,Wtf are you on about
15238,"that upvote/downvote ratio check's out though 

my gosh, I know this is most likely gonna get removed by the mods, but part of me want's it to stay up to see how low it goes"
15239,You're being so disingenuous about this lol.
15240,"The EU literally requested for ""third world Covid-sticken"" India to send 10 million doses of AZ."
15241,"It didn't merely ""look into it"", an EU ambassador posted a letter to India requesting these vaccines, but India refused to send them."
15242,"Sorry if that's difficult for you to reconcile, but there it is."
15243,Just wanted to say you have the distinction of having possibly the worst comment I've seen on this sub in 2021.
15244,Congrats!
15245,You're living in a delusional world.
15246,Glad to see this is getting downvoted so much
15247,People should cut in line.
15248,We are reopening.
15249,It's not right to tell people they have to take on risk but also not allowed to protect themselves.
15250,Wow.
15251,"man I hate the ""let's drag this out forever crowd""

but seriously, where does the line get drawn and we can get back to normal?"
15252,"sure, can still catch it after vaccinated, but the chances of covid cases completely hitting 0 is completely unrealistic since those without symptoms are still going out and not getting tested unless they are forced to, just look at the flu which is not going anywhere any time soon

so you have fun living in fear, us in the ""real life"" are gonna do the complete opposite"
15253,"Thought this was on the CDC site but I guess not

[94% effective at preventing asymptomatic infections, 97% at preventing symptomatic infections](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/real-world-evidence-confirms-high-effectiveness-pfizer)

I'd say that a 94% prevention for asymptomatic infections and 97% prevention for symptomatic infections is quite close to being ""almost 100% safe from infection and transmitting the virus."""
15254,The Pfizer and modern a are already as effective as J &amp; J after one shot.
15255,About 85%.
15256,It’s just that a second shot adds extra efficacy with MRNA and does not add extra for J &amp; J.
15257,Lets add the fact that you double your chances of getting rhe virus in the first week after vaccination to the mix.
15258,People drop their guard and start going around.
15259,And my school is having kids go to 3ft apart.
15260,"THANKS, CDC!!"
15261,!
15262,Cases have quintupled since their summer low in December and they're currently reporting more cases now than at any time during the pandemic.
15263,100?
15264,I’m doing to for free.
15265,Give me a bag of Cheetos idgaf
15266,In the PNW there are people who not only wear masks hiking but will dive off the trail in visible horror if you pass them unmasked.
15267,HPV hasn’t been politicized.
15268,Joining in 30 minutes.
15269,Can't wait!
15270,No one is expecting to completely eradicate COVID (outside of some looney tunes in this subreddit).
15271,There are plenty of us that are completely comfortable going back to living our lives with how effective the vaccine is with reducing the spread and deaths.
15272,The eu is so horrible bad at this
15273,Maybe it’s just me but I think it is perfectly healthy to get sick from a cold once or twice a year.
15274,I don’t even want to think about how hard the next cold is going to be since I haven’t had one for a year and a month.
15275,There is no good in living in a hyper-sanitized society.
15276,"B4 everyone rages, yes  I wear a mask."
15277,I’m hoping community spread is down no almost nothing before they start school again.
15278,"Yep, same for me too."
15279,My County has said that Phase 2 people might have difficulty getting appointments as there are still Phase 1 people who need appointments.
15280,"Strange, in Texas Gov."
15281,Perry [made news back in the day requiring the HPV vaccine.
15282,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1800969/)
15283,And it’s pure theater.
15284,The only argument for vaccinated people being masked is a social one.
15285,We’re rapidly approaching the point where that’s no longer true as all US adults are eligible for the vaccine.
15286,I’m vaccinated and no longer wearing a mask anywhere it’s not explicitly required.
15287,"&gt;PR effort

I hope so."
15288,I feel like public messaging hasn't been very solid through this all.
15289,There are still people who don't know the vaccine is free with and without insurance.
15290,4 days for me!
15291,get the shots and lets end this
15292,"It is an absolutely stunning day today, nights are still a bit chilly for being in a beer garden though."
15293,"I think it's pretty safe to say at this point that his ""Worst of the pandemic"" projections in March will not come to light."
15294,Protection comes in degrees.
15295,It is not a 0-100 phenomenon.
15296,"Let us say ""resistance"" instead?"
15297,This conveys the meaning better.
15298,"*They ""could"" get reinfected just like someone without a previous infection or vaccination ""could"" get infected."
15299,"* 

The probabilities are different, though."
15300,As are the risks of severe disease.
15301,"If that happened, the U.S. wouldn't be able to reopen until 2022."
15302,We did a good job with vaccines.
15303,We should get to enjoy the benefits of that.
15304,I'll let you all know how I react to it
15305,[deleted]
15306,Simply amazing!
15307,Excellent preview of what's to come in the US in the coming weeks as we reach UK levels of vaccination.
15308,3 weeks late but better late than never...
15309,"In my city, a bunch of pharmacies are doing walk ins, and a few even set up on the college campus."
15310,Not too much of an excuse not to get it
15311,Is there literature on the mutations found in B.1.617 that gives you hope that it will not evade the vaccine and become a problem for the world?
15312,What little I've found seems to suggest the T Cell escape of the virus will set this on a trajectory of extreme infection for even young people as our memory t cell defenses will not be adapted due to lack of infection of cross reactive coronaviruses.
15313,"[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423507v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423507v1)

15314,It's even lower than 2-3%.
15315,"The CFR in the U.S. as of today is 1.78%, and we can reasonably assume that there are probably twice as many actual cases as have been confirmed."
15316,This is right on line with what Worldometers has been projecting.
15317,"Deaths will probably rise for the next few weeks because they're a lagging indicator, but for the most part this probably will be behind them especially as the warmer weather begins to take over and vaccination coverage increases."
15318,"It's in other pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and processed foods."
15319,I guess most people are...working from home.
15320,Damn.
15321,Thats a 99.9% reduction since January right?
15322,"I got Moderna shot #2 on Saturday morning, and they told me that full immunity takes two weeks."
15323,So my personal Independence Day is May 1 this year.
15324,:-)
15325,Reality is obviously somewhere in the middle.
15326,Yea that’s not how efficacy works bud.
15327,You need to go take some statistics classes.
15328,"Not only that the vaccine protects against severity of cases, so your entire argument is mute on that principal alone."
15329,"While the U.S certainly receives the most doses, it will be fair to finish up here first and then start exporting to countries that are in need of extra doses, however, once the U.S is done, other countries should start seeing they can buy loads more directly from the manufactures anyways."
15330,"I want a sticker,  never got one"
15331,"At least the corrupt government party CDU which is responsible for this is rising in polls since the media put their internal power struggles in the spotlight and germans are like ""oh i see cdu..good..i vote cdu...""."
15332,Far too much human emotion and communication happens non verbally for masks to be a widespread feature of any culture long term.
15333,"Wow that’s a very original comeback, you completely changed my mind, blew me away with your logic"
15334,"No we shouldn't, but they asked"
15335,[removed]
15336,"Great article, thanks for sharing."
15337,They didn’t even do that!
15338,Literally everything on there is written in my handwriting including dose/lot/location.

15340,[removed]
15341,Thankfully I have a job that gives you 3 weeks of sick leave per year and you can accumulate up to 6 months so if I don't feel well I call out with no questions asked but a lot of folks cannot do that but everyone should be able too.
15342,Because our media has exactly zero incentive to present objective facts and let their audiences interpret data for themselves.
15343,Let’s not tie in the military with teachers.
15344,I was being flippant because the poster above me was mocking a teachers union for wanting its teachers to be safe.
15345,"In most states, the average teacher deals with a lot of stress for relatively low reward."
15346,The point of a union is to use collective bargaining to protect its workers.
15347,It’s rly not outlandish that they were asking to be vaccinated early on.
15348,Thank you for the ethics lesson.
15349,India started vaccination in Jan and started slower than the pace it could have actually vaccinated.
15350,"Now, second wave came in hard and we are seeing 275,000 cases everyday which has caused a massive public backlash as we are going into lockdown again."
15351,That’s why the central govt decided to open vaccination for 18 plus.
15352,Earlier it was 45 plus.
15353,[This video explains the situation in detail](https://youtu.be/dFkBCNwbebU)
15354,"Hundreds of millions of people, including those with allergies, have gotten the vaccine."
15355,"You're a teacher -- you of all people should get the vaccine, even if your doctor doesn't email you."
15356,Most of us absolutely want to write off 2020.
15357,The goal here is a full return to 2019 normal.
15358,"Not masks on subways, in bars, and at work."
15359,Not getting your temperature taken at random businesses.
15360,Not making reservations for every aspect of life.
15361,None of it.
15362,Real normal.

15371,Public policy should be to let the public do what they want until there is evidence showing it’s a health hazard.
15372,You don’t get to default to emergency power.
15373,It is plainly obvious that vaccinated people are less likely to spread coronavirus we don’t know how much less likely but that lack of knowledge can’t be justification for changing the whole way society operates (and this goes way beyond masks so don’t act like that’s all there is to it).
15374,"I didn’t get anything other than a sore arm, nothing in the body or fatigue."
15375,I definitely count myself lucky.
15376,in the next few weeks you will have access to any shot you desire
15377,Someone from Belgium made a video that showed him traveling to las Vegas and getting his shot.
15378,He might've had dual citizenship?
15379,That’s what I was thinking too.
15380,"Enough participants to get data, and get good conclusions."
15381,Same with mine and my friends.
15382,"They put stickers on it with the dose/clinic, but they had me free hand my own info."
15383,"Out of curiosity though, how would you feel if your child gives COVID to another child?"
15384,"I think that's the concern, if you make all students required to attend an in person classroom, then it's no longer a choice for the parents but a risk they are forced to accept."
15385,"My arm hurt less on the 2nd shot, but holy shit people don’t lie about the body soreness and fatigue."
15386,That’s a good sign at least that they were able to meet enrollment goals.
15387,I work in clinical trials and that’s always our biggest challenge.
15388,And lose money because most Americans have extremely little sick or vacation times compared to most other developed nations?
15389,"Nah, they just gonna show up sick."
15390,I don’t think they’re secretly plotting.
15391,I think they are paralyzed due to lack of definitive data and they are making a major mistake by defaulting to retaining emergency restrictions.
15392,Restrictions need to be based in science not uncertainty.
15393,It’s fear that is keeping them from changing the guidance around vaccinated people.
15394,And it’s not simply about wearing a mask.
15395,Huge amounts of our federal infrastructure are closed to the public.
15396,I don't know why this is getting downvoted.
15397,"So far our local school district hasn't had much, if any, in school spread."
15398,"It's all been picked up in the home, at a school sponsored sporting event/practice, or at a students job."
15399,"I can't think of any elementary students that have picked it up, either."
15400,It's been mostly high school and a few middle school students.

15405,"Just curious, what country are you from?"

15408,Just being a teacher doesn't automatically make you better or more noble.
15409,"Same thing with the military and other groups that seem to get a ""they are all very good"" shine."
15410,"This'll be great, but it probably won't be a fully national trend here."
15411,Communities that are slow to vaccinate will be vulnerable for much longer than those vaccinating more aggressively.

15414,My BSB tickets for June are not a small part of why I am following vaccination news so closely.
15415,4 deaths in the whole of the UK.

15417,Things are looking up in England!
15418,The person who thinks the covid parties were not real def is
15419,Have you ever seen the immunization records you get like when a child is born?
15420,It's pretty much the same deal.
15421,We've been using this system for like 60+ years at least.
15422,"As the article says, however, there are heavy repercussions for faking official seals."
15423,"Well good, hopefully this will mean they chill out and stop looking for scapegoats."
15424,There's really no reason to vaccinate those under 18 that aren't CEV being pure selfishness and arrogance to the situation outside of the UK/USA/Other Western nations when they catch up.
15425,More people will die because of this.
15426,In theory?
15427,Yes.
15428,In practice?
15429,Yes.
15430,As a member of the servant class?
15431,Most definitely.
15432,Same I got hit by a bus but worth it in the end
15433,People seem to think that we can somehow chuck another 200 million doses in arms this week just because everyone is eligible.
15434,No.
15435,The majority of those doses don't even exist yet.
15436,We're already going as fast as the supply chain will allow.
15437,The pause was a mistake
15438,But also people like brunch.
15439,You can register no matter what your age and they’ll contact you when you’re eligible.
15440,Some pharmacies are already contacting people who have registered and booking for Tuesday.

15465,"And no, it's not a given that they'll be more and more problematic; it's just the narrative that people like Feigl-Ding try to sell."

15477,We're already seeing that.
15478,"If sports events are any indication, for enforcement or adherence to mask mandates, outdoor events are likely to see mask mandates eliminated well before indoor ones."
15479,"You would probably be able to go to an MLB game unmasked this summer, an NBA game probably not until about this time next year."
15480,You know what’s playing dumb?
15481,Acting like it’s an unreasonable question.
15482,If the CDC simply said: ‘ the risk of asymptomatic spread is low but not low enough that we can justify mask removal until everyone has been offered a vaccine’.
15483,That would be great.
15484,"But they don’t say, they hem and they haw without giving any data."
15485,They refuse to provide measurable auditable guidance.
15486,It’s insanely frustrating that the science community is saying ‘trust us’ without sharing the metrics by which they are making their decisions and when they would change those decisions based on the current conditions.
15487,Yes variants are possible but it doesn’t mean they don’t have to answer the question in the context of the current variants.
15488,I am pro vaccine and pro science.
15489,I am also pro government transparency and I think they are screwing up the marketing of this vaccine horribly.
15490,Talk about self-fulfilling prophecy.
15491,Do you know if you still had antibodies when you got your vaccine shot?
15492,I had COVID back in December and my Dr. is recommending I wait for the vaccine until I no longer have antibodies
15493,Immunity can be permanent...
15494,I haven't gotten chicken pox again.
15495,Oh yeah some parts of the U.K. like Leicester and Manchester  have spent all but a couple months of summer last year in lockdown since this started.
15496,Getting my first dose in 5 hours!
15497,Because they keep trying to make us do the same.
15498,Got it
15499,I'm getting mine on the 30th because the clinic im scheduled at is booked until then.
15500,On one hand.
15501,I want it now!
15502,Lol on another I'm glad people are getting it here
15503,The vaccine protects other people you love who may be at risk though.
15504,You won’t die from the flu or covid but you very well might pass it to someone else who will if you aren’t vaccinated.
15505,Also I assume you want places to open up and I assume you want mask policies to end.
15506,"The easiest way to do that is get a vaccine, watch covid cases drop to zero, and enjoy your life."
15507,Be a hero mate.
15508,Save some lives by getting a vaccine.

15543,"Double shit, gives it to my kid, I'm not going to know *where* my kid got it."
15544,"I'm not going to know if that's school acquired or community acquired, and realistically, my kid's doctor won't know either, because the school isn't going to tell me anything, so is that going to be counted as school acquired?"
15545,"That's not a conspiracy, that's just how the laws/privacy guidelines work in my area."
15546,"I read twenty pages of super boring documents about district plans for returning kids to school in my area, and a lot of it was based on outdated information, magical thinking and unenforceable policies."

15553,I don’t see it as tricky.
15554,"We need herd immunity, if we don’t vaccinate the undocumented that’s another segment keeping us from reaching it."
15555,Just vaccinate them the costs of doing so will be far less than the economic costs of not doing it.
15556,Vaccination is not only about the protection of individuals who get the vaccine.
15557,"I'd recommend doing some research about the functions of vaccines on a societal level, most notably being the protection of people who *cannot* get the vaccine for health reasons."
15558,"The US has the most doses administered as a percentage of population of all ""big"" countries (&gt;25 million population)."
15559,"Excluding various territories - Seychelles, Israel, the UAE, Maldives, Bahrain, and Chile all have more doses administered per capita but are relatively small countries (Chile is the largest with 19 million people)."
15560,The UK also has more first doses administered (due to their strategy of delaying second doses) than the US.
15561,This is so dystopian.
15562,"Not only do people need time to care for themselves when sick, but they cannot work while caring for a sick child or while caring for a elderly parent."
15563,"Plus, how are people supposed to go to medical appointments with no PTO?"
15564,I thought it was a given that Pfizer was immune from lawsuits given the experimental nature of the vaccine.
15565,You wanna trade lives for a few days?
15566,Getting paid to visit a lowered capacity Disney world sounds amazing.
15567,Nobody asked.
15568,Pfizer is the biggest evil now .
15569,Soon they want half of the  earth as ransom to give vaccines to people outside USA.
15570,If there is a point in time UN to intervene and show there mighty this is the one .
15571,"Where it isn't true is in locations where supply exceeds demand, and those are going to be places where herd immunity levels of vaccination won't be reached."
15572,[deleted]
15573,Around 5-10% of all infected need hospitalization.
15574,And these aren’t people who were dying.
15575,It’s a random draw of dna.
15576,Leaned towards obese people of which America has millions.

15578,"30 percent or less that you'll experience more than a sore arm and 30 percent is just ""fatigue""."
15579,I'm in that 30 percent that had fatigue but it was mild enough for me that it would have had no effect on an exam 2 days later or studying.
15580,I just went to bed an hour or 2 earlier than normal.
15581,There have been a handful of documented cases of dogs testing positive for COVID.
15582,They don't seem to be affected much by the virus
15583,No one in the south is still getting it.
15584,NO one.
15585,"Open appointments everywhere, and open to everyone."
15586,Probably ok is not enough reassurance when we’re talking about the lives and futures of my children.
15587,"Statistically yes, they would probably be ok. As their mother, I’d still like to protect them from possible mis-c, death, other unknown effects, etc."
15588,Agreed.
15589,This is also why the pause on Johnson vaccine is awful.
15590,Hopefully they are able to figure it out.
15591,The one vaccine is a huge key on a big part of the population getting vaccinated.
15592,Good luck friend.
15593,"I""m in Louisiana."
15594,Seniors are at 57%.
15595,"State at 30% and open appointments everywhere, anyone over 16 can get it but they aren't."
15596,"Overall, the country will be between 50-60% until there are more mandates."
15597,There are also pretty significant limitations to human challenge trials.
15598,"In this case it would have meant the trial group would be completely unrepresentative of the general population, as they'd only deliberately infect young, healthy people."
15599,Not the at risk population that these vaccines are primarily meant to protect.
15600,Somethings not right about that though.
15601,I’m gonna wait till I know more about it before I get it.
15602,I’m not just gonna mindlessly put something in my body when I don’t know what’s in it.
15603,Now there are recalls for a certain brand of the vaccine I forgot which one and AstraZeneca vaccine production/research got halted.
15604,I’m in a situation and place right now though where I don’t have to worry about infecting anyone luckily.
15605,So I’ll just wait and see what happens with the vaccinated population.
15606,I will also keep any further opinions about it to myself as I don’t want to come across as arrogant know it all when I don’t know enough about the vaccine tbh.
15607,UK and AZ doing extremely well
15608,In [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) air/oxygen is just assumed to be available to everyone at all times.
15609,Though thinking about it a drowning person will take down rescuers with them in their panic.
15610,I got my second Pfizer and was just fine afterward other than soreness in the arm.
15611,Just to give you a different perspective (and maybe some hope) compared to everyone else saying how much they suffered through it.
15612,"Of course, I also took 2 tylenol when I got home from the shot, 2 more before bed, and 2 the next morning, just to try and head off any symptoms ahead of time."
15613,I had plans the next day I didn't want to miss/feel bad for.

15620,Ok but locally this may or may not be true.
15621,Due to my current schedule i’m waiting to where I can walk in and get a 1 shot vaccine without appointment.
15622,Still social distancing and wearing masks until I get it but I’m not in any rush to get it.

15626,"&gt; I mean, for a young healthy person the chances of complications are very low

Especially when you already have some immunity."
15627,Virtually 0% chance of severe illness
15628,"When Israel hit about 50% of their population vaccinated, their country's R value decreased below one."
15629,"In Israel the pandemic is basically over, their cases and deaths are way down."
15630,"Not only that, the US has had 30 million confirmed covid cases which could mean there is easily 3-4x that many cases that weren't found."
15631,I had the 2nd pfizer one yesterday afternoon.

15634,"Was worried as I have bad asthma, thought there was a chance my lungs would be impacted but no issues there."
15635,&gt;But to pretend like a vaccinated person isn’t significantly less likely to spread covid is poisonous misinformation.
15636,I never said that.
15637,I said that vaccinated people can still get COVID.
15638,Please direct me to a source that contradicts that statement.
15639,"Man, I hate Doug Ford but if I hear this buck a beer one more fucking time...."
15640,He never promised buck a beer.
15641,He said he would ALLOW brewers to charge $1 per beer if they wanted to.
15642,There use to be $1 beer until the Liberals decided we aren't responsible enough adults to manage ourselves to they made it ILLEGAL to charge less than $1.25 or something.
15643,That is all.
15644,"He did not say there would be $1 beer, he said his government wouldn't force breweries to charge more."
15645,Oh I'm not arguing with you man.
15646,Just stating my opinion.
15647,It's a tricky situation in general m
15648,"I agree its still a long road ahead, but you know, a journey of a thousand miles....

Hopefully with enough of us vaccinated, the stupid people might see the light."
15649,Beaches are pretty safe tho tbh
15650,"If you're partially vaccinated, wearing a mask, and staying out doors I wouldn't think twice about it."

15660,I figured that for outdoor requirements.
15661,But for indoor?
15662,Yep.
15663,"I’m not a COVID denier (actually a biochemist/geneticist by education and trade, I stayed in and followed social distancing guidelines etc.)"
15664,"but the studies right now show Pfizer is 89-91% effective 15 days after 1st dose, and Moderna is 92% effective 14 days after 1st dose."
15665,All preliminary data points to the most probable scenario of vaccinated hosts not able to carry the virus in anywhere near the titre necessary for transmission.
15666,"I get and respect those wanting to be extra cautious, but the shaming people for a return to normal post-vaccination is just telling that your intentions were never rooted in concern for others so much as a desire for self-righteousness, or a now socially-acceptable totalitarian urge to push people to live in the isolated style of living you prefer."
15667,Like someone else mentioned they need to stick around if they are getting a 2 dose vaccine for at least 3 weeks.
15668,They should be wearing masks as well which are protective in nature.
15669,"Unless their brainwashed by the company, I don’t think most people WANT to come into work sick."
15670,Not in every state.
15671,"In Louisiana, 57% of people 65 and over have been vaccinated."
15672,"Less than 30% statewide, and we've been open for everyone over 16 for a while now."
15673,Open appointments everywhere.
15674,I'm talking about the US total will be 50-60% of adults.
15675,Areas will be higher and lower.
15676,"Again, we've maxed out in the south at below 30%, with open appointments everywhere."
15677,I'm talking about the overall US percentage.
15678,[Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mess-inherited-biden-leans-heavily-trumps-warp-speed/story?id=76186823) should get most of the credit.
15679,Memorial Day/June 1st for the vast majority of America.
15680,Vaccines should be readily available to everyone who wants one within a month.
15681,Plenty of time for them to get it before fall semester.
15682,Probably get a 1.5m fine.
15683,Get to keep 4.3m and 6 months in jail.
15684,"If Trump were president, I cannot imagine where we would be right now."
15685,"Vaccines being diverted, withheld, I just cannot imagine."
15686,Interesting.
15687,Do you feel there have been far more countries that have had longer and stricter lockdowns than the UK?
15688,"Perhaps there may be a handful in Europe that have, but compared to the rest of the world, I can't really think of many that have had long and strict lockdowns that compare to the UK."
15689,[removed]
15690,What’s the vaccinations lookin like in other countries?
15691,Is America the most vaccinated?
15692,My first shot did that to me so I really hope if the first one was bad the second won't be worse.
15693,My comment was not by myself at all.
15694,More vaccines = less cases = less chance of spread.
15695,This is exactly how herd immunity works.
15696,Plenty of research is showing vaccines are also effective against asymptomatic spread as well.
15697,"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/pfizer-vaccine-shows-94-effectiveness-asymptomatic-transmission-covid/story?id=76389615

Regarding your reduced testing comment look at California where our positivity rate is at an all time low and staying there."
15698,Heck even Arizona is staying low and they managed their lockdowns and mask mandates very differently.
15699,I always like to point out that this brand-new mRNA technology has actually been in development for the past 30 years.
15700,"From the article:

""Gas and firewood furnaces at a crematorium in the western Indian state of Gujurat have been running so long without a break during the COVID-19 pandemic that metal parts have begun to melt."""
15701,You're the one ignoring the experts.
15702,Vaccinations prevent infection.
15703,Everything in 2021 shows that.

15715,Is anything 100 percent?
15716,No of course not.
15717,But to pretend like a vaccinated person isn’t significantly less likely to spread covid is poisonous misinformation.
15718,They only recommend avoiding taking something before you get your vaccine.
15719,After to alleviate symptoms is fine.
15720,Same reason I don't get a flu shot every year.
15721,"I am healthy, fit individual in my 20s."

15725,The kids and staff all wear masks and try to socially distance as best they can.
15726,They generally keep all the grades and classes as separated as possible.
15727,There hasn’t really been much of any spread in the school.
15728,"People have gotten Covid and have had to quarantine, but it’s always been that they got it from *outside* the classroom."
15729,It hasn’t spread amongst the students.
15730,"So turns out, the guidelines actually do help prevent spread."
15731,I'll be there later today!
15732,I think the chances of side effects lasting more than a day or two is very small.
15733,"Other than Sputnik, all the two dose vaccines currently use identical doses."
15734,And there are open appointments all over the south.
15735,We've maxed out in Louisiana already (at about 25%).
15736,The percentage will be higher on the coasts.
15737,"Overall, the US will be at 50-60%"
15738,"I still think that would end up being 25% of Americans, because it would mostly be the same families whose children wouldn't be vaccinated"

15740,Not soon enough.
15741,Went out to dinner for the first time since this started (since my husband and I are both vaccinated now).
15742,I feel so bad for waitstaff that need to wear masks for hours and hours.
15743,Our waiter was sweating and just looked so uncomfortable.
15744,"Once everyone can get vaccinated, mandates gotta go."
15745,Everyone 16 and over are now able to get the vaccine in every state in the US.
15746,"With how fast vaccine rollout is, every college student should be able to be fully vaccinated prior to the start of the fall semester."
15747,Given the week/weekend day cycle that will probably be 3 weekends or so from now.
15748,Providing the latest stage of lockdown release didn't cause anything to spike up.
15749,Make sure your management team walks the talk on that.
15750,"I work in an office environment where plenty of people came in with colds pre-covid - despite having liberal sick time (separate from vacation time) and an official policy that was more flexible than most, many managers' personal attitude toward their teams made it clear that butts were expected in seats unless team members were unable to function."

15784,Just like Fauci it leaves the average citizen wanting much more.
15785,This isn’t medical records.
15786,The cdc card literally has no legal meaning.
15787,It’s like a receipt.
15788,Which is exactly what will happen.
15789,Moderna is going from bi-weekly to weekly deliveries and Pfizer is increasing with 40% in May and 100% in June.
15790,Large deliveries from J&amp;J in June and July is just the icing.
15791,"Hopefully AZ will deliver like planned too, although that’s not something to bet on."
15792,Basically the number of vaccinations will roughly double in May and almost double again in June.
15793,I think what a lot of people are forgetting is also that many know someone who either died from Covid or had a severe case of it.
15794,"When you have that knowledge and grief in the back of your head, it’s difficult to lessen your fear of it."

15835,Potentially another lockdown when the current vaccines in our body run their course and we need another round.
15836,"*Cries in Canadian*

Not eligible for 1-2 more months, and then won't be getting the second dose until 4 months after that."
15837,"Props to the Biden administration for rolling out it out so quickly considering they literally had nothing to work with back in January, whereas we Canadians were looking down smugly."
15838,Fuck this will never end
15839,Thank you for sharing.
15840,Thank you for the hard work you do.
15841,How would you feel knowing you potentially got some little old lady sick with covid and sent her to the hospital?
15842,My bad.
15843,"The point is, is that the UK was on a very long and very strict lockdown."
15844,So glad to see people on this sub understands that it takes 2-3 weeks after the second for your body to develop antibodies and fight Covid.
15845,Keep up folks..I am trying to schedule an appointment myself..soon :-)
15846,"If I don’t see cases starting to trend down soon, I’ll be kinda suspicious"
15847,No vaccine 'fully protects'.
15848,Let's please not go crazy.
15849,A gradual easing of restrictions makes a lot more sense then a gigantic BOOM today is the day we all go nuts day
15850,[removed]
15851,They aren’t here.
15852,They’re elsewhere filling each other with delusions.
15853,my husbands coworker makes those.
15854,for her friends and shamelessly offers it to everyone at work.
15855,"OK, now we're going around in circles."
15856,"I've explained all of this, and all you can do is ignore my answers and keep asking the same questions."
15857,Best of luck to you.
15858,&gt; don't they have phones?
15859,"Hey now, this is not the Diablo Immortal subreddit."
15860,I’m not yelling I’m asking the people in charge of setting public health policy to publish the rules of the game.
15861,They don’t have to convince me they just need to appropriately show their work.
15862,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2BN0L3 he’s right about them evolving in roughly the same way, I don’t think he meant to say they’re fully evading vaccine antibodies, only partially"
15863,&gt;The risk calculus incorporates the use of seatbelts and car seats.
15864,Not sure what your point is.
15865,The person I responded (not you) to mentioned neither seatbelts nor car seats.
15866,There is no reason to believe the risk calculus is included based on what is there.
15867,You can try going out for your shopping at a store that has a covid pharmacy around the pharmacy closing hours.
15868,Swing by and ask if they have missed doses.
15869,"They are only good for some time, so if anyone can't make it the preference is not to throw the dose away."
15870,If you are a busy person call some of the pharmacies and ask if that is realistic.
15871,Personally if I was 2 weeks post first vaccine I would feel great with that level of protection (80 percent).
15872,Enjoy Disney but remember your rain jacket - weather is nasty today!
15873,"Stood in line for 2 hours yesterday to get my shot, there were easily hundreds vaccinated while I was there."
15874,They're really doing their best to get through as many as possible a quickly as possible.
15875,Really happy to see so many people out getting vaccinated.
15876,"Well, if the vaccination rate here continue to grow (it surely will) you will get your first dose in no more than 5 months"
15877,Prior to covid our kids' pediatrician complained about school truancy policies that basically forced parents to bring their kids in for a sick visit solely to get a doctor's note so the absence from school would be excused.
15878,"Not only does it get expensive for parents whose families are on high deductible medical plans, but having mildly-sick kids in the office unnecessarily exposes other staff and patients to viruses and isn't much fun for a kid who will feel better the quickest by staying home to rest."
15879,They haven't even done all the science stuff to figure out that it's safe for you.
15880,"This definitely shouldn't be given to young children like that, they're at nearly no risk and the risks of the vaccine itself are completely unknown"
15881,can you imagine cost of that?
15882,makes no sense.
15883,you need proof of vaccinations from doctor to go to school they review with state as well.
15884,so yeah state has the records.
15885,if another country requires covid vaccine proof they will ask probably for something different than that card.
15886,"While low viral loads indicate CNS probably isn't the main tropism, Covid RNA was present in CNS autopsy tissue."
15887,Which results were you saying were contradicting?
15888,I want to understand your point.
15889,No that’s not true.
15890,In England some restrictions were lifted last week but restrictions started to be relaxed on 8th March with schools going back and a few other minor changes.
15891,"We are slowly getting there, we are now doing over 45s with my best guest being over 40s will be started mid May, Im 34 so Im looking at June at current rate but it been great to see England open back up even though it makes my job harder."
15892,Undocumented immigrants getting vaccinated is very important.
15893,Most won't get vaccinated unless it is with walk-ins.
15894,Hopefully more cities start doing this.
15895,This you?
15896,https://m.imgur.com/gallery/EwIIBJ5
15897,&gt;now it looks like the vast majority of the EU will have had their first shot by end of June.
15898,Less than 20% of the EU have had their first dose.
15899,"For the majority to have their first shot by end June (which is just 2 and a half months away), they would need to be jabbing at a much faster rate than they currently are."
15900,"You can, but it is very unlikely."
15901,"You can theoretically also still catch polio, but I haven't seen anyone in a developed country worry about it in my lifetime."
15902,it will be on my face next flu season now that i understand the science
15903,In my State it's been open since April 4 I think.
15904,"There wasn't a surge in vaccinations, because we're still getting about 7% of the population a week in vaccine doses shipped to us."

15913,There's a difference between being eligible and having actual access.

15915,"It's a long process, I know, but lightning fast in the history of vaccines."
15916,[deleted]
15917,What?
15918,How is your comment so upvoted?
15919,Maybe the person just wanted to share their experience?
15920,"Vaccine hesitancy is because people are stupid, not because of innocent comments detailing the TRUE experience not getting a vaccine."
15921,What?
15922,You rather people lie about their experience?
15923,"Yeah, that'll convince anti-vaxxers alright, more lies."
15924,What kind of dumb logic is that?
15925,"deaths by age group: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/

it groups 0-17 into one group, but it illustrates my point."
15926,"i can’t find the statistics i found a month or so ago, but 80% of those deaths are most likely from people &gt;12 years old."
15927,"unless your 4 year old had bad lungs/other things that could make their immune system compromised, probably ok"

15931,"With us set to receive 8m Pfizer next month, my prediction is we are about a month behind the US on this (for first doses), which isn't terrible considering how we started."
15932,What is the hypothesis that needs to be tested and where is the study?
15933,Why is further study necessary when we’ve got six months of post vaccinated data?
15934,Fauci is the mouthpiece for this work to the country.
15935,"It’s not fair to say I need to do my own research, he should be able to eloquently state the case for remaining restricted."
15936,Let’s not forget that when the CDC said it was OK to travel they did so without any fanfare or explanation for what changed.
15937,It’s bad science to make that policy change without pointing to the associated science.
15938,And I am continually growing in skepticism that they will do better in the future.
15939,They’re going to come out and say you can stop wearing a mask if you’re vaccinated and they’ll never say why.
15940,Or if they do it will be in after the fact justification for the change.
15941,It’s very disappointing they can’t simply tell us the conditions against which such a recommendation could change.
15942,"&gt; I'm worried about it being abused, but we'll see how it goes."
15943,The problem with this is that you'll never be able to quantify how many working days you've saved.
15944,"If you have 30 genuine sick days used, 10 more that are playing-hooky days, and 60 days saved because the sick people didn't come in and infect half the office you're still at +20 days of efficiency."
15945,"You'll never be able to 'see' those 60 saved days though, unless you've been tracking work outages for several years and can compare it to the numbers after the policy change."
15946,"Aside from the fact that a great number of people in this demographic remember polio so likely have a greater understanding of the importance of vaccinations in a time like this, it seems that the one thing even the more COVID-skeptic folks will concede is that age is a HUGE determining factor in terms of COVID severity and don't want to take their chances."
15947,"""It's just allergies"""
15948,6k out of 80 million.
15949,"You are the incorrect one, in the vast majority of people they are immune to covid-19, not just from getting seriously sick with it."
15950,I'm still all cold sweaty/chills/hot flashes.
15951,Shot #1 I had some mild fatigue the day of.
15952,I even drank a shit ton of water and then pedialite after my second dose.
15953,But I guess you can't really control these things.
15954,I'm sure it's better than being on a ventilator though.
15955,I was fine the day of #2 thinking everything was cool.
15956,"Meanwhile, the U.S. reported 43,181 new cases and 310 deaths yesterday, down from January peaks of 307,500 and 4,484."
15957,Yea that's bullshit.
15958,"3-4 weeks after your first shot, go and live your life worry free."
15959,"If we had a vaccine that was 75-80% effective before all this, no one would have given a shit about COVID."
15960,"Now all because the second shot just because there's a vaccine that provides 95% immunity, people are saying ""you're not safe until your second shot""."
15961,You're practically safe after your first shot 2-4 weeks from when you got it.
15962,I wasn't thinking of police enforcement but more businesses telling people to wear them.
15963,"Where I live, in Louisville, there's near universal mask compliance in stores."
15964,"Man, would love to see that."
15965,"I’ve been vaccinating in my (major) city, we’ve been begging for arms at some points in the day."
15966,We even do walk ins!
15967,I’ve heard from coworkers here that calling CVS/Walgreens towards the end of the day for any missed appointments could get you a shot just because they don’t want the supply going to waste.
15968,Might be worth a shot.
15969,"As for the preregistration, I got my email on Tuesday and the shot on Saturday."
15970,Hopefully it won’t take much longer to get those out because the mass-vaccination site was moving quick when I was there.
15971,Better than most of Europe and the rest of the world
15972,I think the messaging has been partially reflective of the fact that the average young non-immunocompromised adult has just recently become eligible to receive the vaccine.
15973,"As soon as most of the people who are unvaccinated have consciously made that decision, it's easier to promote a straight message of ""Get vaccinated, don't need to wear your mask."""
15974,[deleted]
15975,"""Invoking fear, as well as being easier to perpetuate unrest amongst the population in order to better keep control measures in place without question."""
15976,these people are crazy
15977,A lot of countries are giving the priority to elderly.
15978,This isn't Canada exclusive.
15979,"I was worried about feelin too tired after, but I realized that I am always tired."
15980,Yeah.
15981,My roommate is an essential worker.
15982,He doesn't have any sort of strong anti-vax beliefs.
15983,I just kind of assumed he got the vaccine as soon as we got eligibility a month ago.
15984,"I brought up recently that I was getting my second shot, and he was like ""oh, I gotta figure out where to go to get signed up."""
15985,Come on dude.
15986,It's been a month and you haven't even looked into the possibility?
15987,[deleted]
15988,"Well my girlfriend's mom and I both had similar bad reactions to the second dose, and she is pre-diabetic and I am diabetic and we both take metformin, so there could be some correlation to worse side effects and diabetes or metformin."
15989,"Hell, metformin can make me nauseous and fatigued by itself on occasion."
15990,I think the messaging has been poor when it comes to vaccines.
15991,I've come across people who don't plan on getting it either.
15992,"It seems like some people simply don't get that it's not just to protect you, it's to protect all of us and end this pandemic."
15993,Getting the vaccine is way more important than masking up.
15994,"I'm not sure if it will change some people's minds, but I do feel like there isn't enough emphasis on the fact that this will protect other people and end this pandemic for all of us."
15995,Not fully yet.
15996,"I try to keep in mind that the younger you are, the more likely to have other challenges in getting the vaccine -- such as a job or classes that are not flexible on timing, may not have transportation, etc."
15997,It's not super easy to get a vaccine if you use the bus and your job won't be flexible to take a vaccine appointment during a scheduled shift.
15998,"There's also going to be some apathy, but convenience will help with that."
15999,"When you can get a vaccine walk up at your grocery store pharmacy, then we'll see how many people aren't interested."
16000,I know you wish the world was this black-and-white.
16001,But it isn't.
16002,Getting pissed off and yelling at people won't change that.
16003,It looks like we’ll be really close to or achieve Biden’s original pre-walkback deadline to get 100 million fully vaccinated on his watch by the end of April too.
16004,85.4 million and counting.
16005,"We just need 17M more vaccine completions over the next 11 days, or 1.54M completions per day on average, to get there."
16006,i guess my risk reward assessment is different.
16007,i treat the risk as 0 and you probably treat it as more than 0. i understand your perspective but still disagree.
16008,That's what I thought.
16009,So the point stands that the UK has had a long/strict lockdown.
16010,And what percentage of the population is vaccinated?
16011,Wear a mask.
16012,Do you think there will be this magically time when no one is spreading Covid?
16013,Because it’s not going anywhere.
16014,"So once a certain threshold of the population gets vaccinated, which is coming up very, very quickly at least in the US, how can you justify that stance?"
16015,By your logic you’ll be wearing a mask forever.
16016,"No one cares about your anecdotal evidence though, do they?"
16017,Seeing a few comments in this thread complaining about a slowdown caused by this facility - but is there any evidence that this slowed rollout at all?
16018,"Like, was a decision made not to use vaccine production capacity elsewhere because they were trying to produce at this facility?"
16019,"It seems more likely to me that they are trying to produce at every facility they can, and that the issues at this facility didn't cause any greater ""slowdown"" than if they had never tried to produce there in the first place."
16020,"If there's some idle vaccine production facility we aren't already using, that's a bigger story than if we are already using all available capacity and one of our long shots failed Quality Testing and didn't pay off."
16021,Probably just a coincidence; I don't think the vaccine protects you from bus attacks.
16022,Really?
16023,"He was talking about chicken pox, shingles is obviously a different thing."
16024,/s
16025,It updates on an interval.
16026,If you saw green and now it's not there.
16027,It means you were too slow.
16028,Many people are just F5ing for hours to find a vaccine when eligibility increases.
16029,*Employers realize it’s absolutely asinine to gaslight workers into coming in to the office when they are sick and actually allow them to use their sick days
16030,This post appears to be about vaccines.

16034,You are so informed!
16035,"Specially about the country of europe 👏

Sarcasm apart, here in Portugal we're preparing to let pharmacies vaccinate people once we have enough doses to warrant it and we already have mass vaccination centers."
16036,"Our best day until now was 1% doses in relation to population and we might have double the capacity reaching 2% using pharmacies and gps, which is higher than either the US or the UK have done in a day i think."
16037,"Denmark has also done a stress test with 100k doses, ~2%."
16038,So if every EU country could do the same as Portugal and Denmark we could do 9-10 million doses a day.
16039,Preferred by whom?
16040,Grapefruit?
16041,Really?
16042,Can I see a picture?
16043,A vaccine does not make you immune.
16044,You can have a flu shot and still get the flu.
16045,It merely introduces your body to the virus on a low level so you can develop an immune response.
16046,If in the future you are exposed to the virus on a large level such as an exposure your body will recognize the virus and be able to mobilize a more effective attack having already seen in once.
16047,The intelligent people are still being cautious.
16048,As an ICU nurse I was vaccinated back in December and still observe all precautions.
16049,I have yet to fly or travel in any way outside of my normal routine.
16050,"A vaccine is not a bulletproof shield, it just helps you not get quite so sick and less likely to die."
16051,Please remain vigilant as our hospitals are still full and I’m still seeking COVID patients die every week.
16052,"Doesn't that depend on who you define as ""experts?"""
16053,"Doctors are experts on vaccines compared to a random citizen, even a well informed one."
16054,I mean I'm no expert compared to licensed M.D.s but hell I'm pretty sure I'd qualify as an expert on vaccines if you compared me to the average person just because I took two classes on microbio and immunology in college.
16055,"Like I said my knowledge on vaccines is quite limited so hypothetically if a bunch of doctors were to disagree with ""experts"" on vaccine safety I'm not sure how I would determine who is right or wrong as both are more qualifed than myself and I can't scientifically determine the objectivity of either argument."
16056,So how do you determine who is the expert?
16057,Do you just mean the consensus?
16058,"I don't think you can change their minds, I had two pharmacy interns tell me the same last week (Philadelphia), at the same time all STEM phd students I know took their moderna shots."
16059,I think comparisons are relevant here as I'm saying the UK has been long/strict compared to other countries.
16060,Just saying the UK did not have a long/strict lockdown and ignoring the rest of the world doesn't really make sense to me.
16061,"Otherwise I could say Texas (where I live) has had a long and strict lockdown too, since we aren't comparing countries/regions."
16062,"I mean, I'm in NC and that's not true."
16063,When I went to get my first shot there were a ton of people there.
16064,Today was my 2 weeks of my 2nd shot!
16065,It doesn't help that many media outlets and the CDC are still acting like vaccinations barely do anything.
16066,CDC guidelines still say not to eat at restaurants even if you're vaccinated.
16067,CNN is running a story about how you shouldn't go see a movie even if you're vaccinated.
16068,"If I was vaccinated, there is a chance of COVID, but with the probabilities, I'd be more worried about a breakdown in social fabric than dying from covid."
16069,Is that required?
16070,Do we have to mention every single safety feature (whether active or passive) that cars have every time we talk about the risks of riding in cars?
16071,The issue is how can you tell you is or is not vaccinated?
16072,The vaccine card is laughably easy to fake.
16073,Basically impossible to get one in Seattle/Seattle area.
16074,"100% appointment only, if you’re lucky enough to get one at all."
16075,I look everyday for weeks before finding one appointment and they’re typically taken before you can complete the form.
16076,Washington state had an extremely poor and slow roll out and Biden fixed that except then it meant we *had* to open the flood gates and apparently just don’t have the infrastructure for it or something as demand cannot even remotely be met.
16077,Ask her if half of the US population is tested enough for her or if she will only get it once 3.5 billion people had it
16078,I hope they do the responsible thing and either use vaccine passports or keep masking until hers immunity.
16079,LOL.
16080,Wow.
16081,Have you seen the show Behind Her Eyes on Netflix?
16082,Pretty crazyyyy
16083,Tell that to shingles.
16084,Northwest is more strict than Northeast..
16085,"Me, In January when the first cases were detected in Washington."
16086,I'm in Alabama.
16087,Interesting!
16088,Does make me wonder though given moderna doesn't produce CD8+ response and CD8+ is one of the reasons cited for vaccine immunity.
16089,Except we learned there was legit zero plan for vaccine rollout when Biden took over.
16090,"They should have used this study instead that shows that this specific clotting issue was actually reported for all vaccines: https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-15-risk-rare-blood-clotting-higher-covid-19-vaccines - 4 per 1M for Pfizer and Moderna, 5 in 1M for AZ and J&amp;J, 40 in 1M for covid and I think 2 in 1M for unvaccinated."
16091,Got my first half last weekend!
16092,looking forward to the last half!
16093,I checked clinicaltrials.gov - it looks like there is in fact a placebo arm for the 12 and up group.
16094,At times yes but not for the entire lockdown period.
16095,We’ve also never had some measures that countries introduced such as passes to go outside or curfews.
16096,Really though any comparison is very subjective and not really useful unless you look at a very short space of time.
16097,I think upcoming gubernatorial elections will prompt the removal of a lot more mask mandates.
16098,This is so depressing - India has been such a hero during the pandemic.
16099,The way they churn out the vaccines is simply incredible.
16100,Sending blessing to you from afar India.
16101,"So if I don't get the vaccine, but you've been vaccinated...what's the problem?"
16102,"I won’t be doing that, but you should feel free"
16103,In Ontario Canada I’m waiting 4 months after my first dose.
16104,I just want this to be over with
16105,I didn't attack anyone.
16106,I was agreeing and reinforcing.
16107,Calm down.
16108,Which is an argument for them to get vaccinated ASAP and not vaccine shop
16109,Oh yea.
16110,"Vaccinated people, especially older adults, are still being very cautious and fearful."
16111,Source: My parents and in-laws.
16112,"My parents had received their vaccines early (sort of an admin mistake), and its been months since they have received their second doses of the Moderna vaccines."
16113,My MIL has also received her second dose a few weeks ago and is fully immunized.
16114,"Neither of them are going anywhere in public or to stores, still deferring to doing curbside pickup for everything and wearing masks / staying 6 feet apart when visiting with other vaccinated friends."
16115,"My MIL still wears a mask when walking her dog in the neighborhood, by herself."
16116,"Whenever I get into discussions with them about vaccines and their risk, the in-laws still have significant fears of catching COVID and dying."
16117,"To paraphrase the MIL: the vaccine is ONLY 91% effective, the risk of catching it is too high."
16118,"I asked all of them just a perception question: ""Scale of 1 to 10, how confidant are you in the vaccine?"

16120,Is it rational?
16121,I don't think so.

16125,No one is getting it.
16126,For a lot of areas opening up like this will just clog the system.
16127,But in.
16128,Lot of more rural areas having more eligible people will lead to more vaccines simply because they have a vaccine surplus from the hesitancy
16129,"Well, I’m convinced!"

16137,That sub is full of people with serious mental issues.
16138,Yeah sure that’s nice but what about the 3 day average?
16139,procrastination
16140,I mean that's clearly not true.
16141,"Texas is currently averaging 225,000 vaccinations per day, Florida 210,000, Georgia 115,000, North Carolina 86,000."
16142,"Texas, Florida, and North Carolina are all also using at least 75 percent of their supply which is roughly on par with the national average."
16143,"Call me crazy, but to me this is a huge milestone."
16144,Any US adult is now eligible for vaccination in any state.
16145,A month ago only about 1% of the US population (Alaska and Mississippi) had general vaccine availability to all adults.
16146,Trying to draw a parallel of today to a month ago is ridiculous.
16147,Sounds like a good thing.
16148,Don't want your soul leaking out all over the place.
16149,Sad that my county is giving aways vaccines to other counties because they are only able to give out 50% of the available vaccines.
16150,My area of Florida is talking about June.
16151,We never really wore masks outside here so this means indoors.
16152,They don't want to commit to June given our infection rate is still quite high here but I'm confident we'll get low enough to ditch masks by then.
16153,I think states that are already seeing very low rates of disease and high vaccination rates will be hard pressed to justify any sort of mask mandates after the end of May when everyone has had plenty of time to get a vaccine.
16154,"COVID isn’t the Chicken Pox, they are completely different diseases"
16155,Immunity is permanent
16156,"As a US citizen currently living in Spain with the projected date of January 2022 being my eligibility for the vaccine, I just have one thing to say...

&amp;#x200B;

*fuck*"
16157,What’s the understanding of whether there are still long term effects if you fall on the wrong side of the 66% efficacy of the J&amp;J vaccine?
16158,"Much appreciated,  really interesting data point, too."
16159,"There are two currently spreading variants (one first seen in South Africa, one first seen in Brazil) that bypass immunity from a previous infection but can still be stopped by the vaccine."
16160,[removed]
16161,"When you naturally get COVID, your body produces a scatter shot of different antibodies to fight off different aspects of the virus."
16162,But most of those antibodies will be ineffective; you have to get lucky making the right antibody to fight the virus.
16163,"When you get the vaccine it trains your body to fight the specific spike protein that the virus used to infect cells, making your body's response super effective."
16164,This is why natural immunity has less effectivity from preventing another infection than getting the shot.
16165,If you're middle aged or older I'd recommend getting the shot anyway just in case.

16172,Living our lives with the small risk at the forefront of our actions is stupid.
16173,And rapidly losing justification.
16174,I have no idea as I try to avoid wasting my time with comparisons to other countries as they don’t really add anything.
16175,"However, I would assume most have like the UK made changes during the ‘lockdown’ rather than just locking down and the ending all restrictions at the same time so any comparison is pretty subjective."
16176,"The UKs lockdown was quite strict when all restrictions were in place but that hasn’t been the case for 6 weeks now, so defining it as ‘very long and very strict’ is not accurate."
16177,I have 3 members of my family that work directly with covid patients.
16178,None of them have had a vaccine yet.
16179,As a 29yo trade worker.
16180,I wont be getting my shots for a loooooong time at this rate my province is doing things.
16181,All of my loved ones/close friends/family who are at risk have been vaccinated.
16182,"Also the vaccine doesnt prevent me from getting it and spreading it, it only reduces the chances of that happening."
16183,Neither is the vaccine tho lol
16184,When justice damns the law.
16185,"lol, yeah sounds like a real loss."

16198,This is definitely very good news... but logistically this will be very difficult for India.
16199,"They export many of the vaccines made in their own country, and don’t have that many for their own use in storage."
16200,"Plus India’s population density is insane, especially in the poor areas."
16201,How will India get those who are poor and living in tight areas vaccinated?
16202,Kids are at greater risk for literally all possible complications from seasonal flu than from covid.

16214,I’m immune suppressed and care *very* much about people staying home even sick but I agree.

16216,"It shouldn’t be this way and I do understand why, I do hope at least now, they’ll wear masks."
16217,"Once every responsible citizen gets vaccinated, get ready to be coughed at a *lot*."
16218,You asked for evidence of evasion to human immune responses.
16219,I linked that mutation which is present in B.1.617.
16220,Is there some other information you are looking for that would further illustrate what I'm speaking to?
16221,That happened to me.
16222,Got some random guy camping out the vaccination center and asked me if I went blind yet after the vaccine..... Huh?
16223,The person you’re replying my to didn’t state otherwise.
16224,"They made a very factual statement about CFR, and then you go off on a tangent about “mask up!” If you’re a real person, get a grip and knock off the preaching, but your comment reads like a bot."
16225,"While I understand your concerns, based on what I’ve seen and heard I think the fears of an escape variant are kind of overblown because:

- we have multiple vaccines that all work in different ways, and I’m no expert on this, but it sounds unlikely that a single strain could evolve to dodge all those entirely."
16226,"- I don’t get how spread in unvaccinated people could lead to the virus learning to dodge the vaccines that don’t exist within them, and spread to vaccinated folks is dramatically cut down according to the new data rolling in

- even if this happens, it won’t happen instantaneously and suddenly negate all vaccines and everybody gets it."
16227,"They’re working on boosters anyway, and with RNA technology it can be done faster than ever before, with historic infrastructure that grows by the day."
16228,Sore arm is very common.
16229,Fatigue (mild) is likely.
16230,"Less common but possible is low grade fever, chills, body pain."
16231,Typically 1-2 days max and kicks in around 12 hours post dose.
16232,To be clear the majority of us only experience sore arm and mild fatigue at worst.
16233,"You could also phrase it as ""everyone who has a higher risk of severe illness or death"", so everyone who makes it dangerous to be living a normal life in general."
16234,I think you will be surprised by the degree to which vaccination grinds to a screeching halt once everyone who wanted one gets one.
16235,I predict that about 30% of Americans will not be vaccinated.
16236,I feel like most people would just want a vaccine in general
16237,"To be fair, they're probably correct if they think they'll be fine if they get sick."
16238,"I'm young and vaccinated, but the consensus among my unvaccinated friends is that they'd rather wait and let others get vaccinated first to see if there any surprise long term side effects."
16239,I think the high success rate and low complications with the current vaccines will swing a lot of this crowd to get it once it's available to all.
16240,They could have easily continued vaccinating people over 45 with J&amp;J where the risk of covid clearly outweighs the risk from the vaccine.
16241,Stop spreading misinformation
16242,"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html

""Results showed that following the second dose of vaccine (the recommended number of doses), risk of infection was reduced by 90 percent two or more weeks after vaccination."
16243,"Following a single dose of either vaccine, the participants’ risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 80 percent two or more weeks after vaccination."""
16244,Lmao.
16245,There are people who wear masks in the woods?
16246,Insanity.
16247,"I don't see masks as restricting my freedom but I'd rather not wear it for several other reasons: it blurs my glasses, it kills my breath if I run, it gets entangled with my earphones..."
16248,Can B117 even be considered a variant in the UK any more?
16249,That's our main deal at this point and clearly the vaccines are working well against it.
16250,"If they're going to make that sound extra scary with the vague ""variants"" tag then they might as well do the same for everything that isn't the original Wuhan version."
16251,"Good thing there are lots of other countries that want some of that sweet  vaccine

*looks at Canada*"
16252,It seems that most of the nasty variants that have evaded vaccine antibodies share some common mutations (although I don't know much about the Indian one).
16253,"This is a good thing, since it indicates that there's a limited amount the virus can do to evade immunity while still remaining highly infectious."
16254,"The vaccine does NOT introduce any viral infection into your body, and the reaction is simply your body’s immune system firing up to an extreme."
16255,"Since cells are not being damaged by the virus, and no illness is present, it can’t possibly portent your body’s actual response to the virus!"
16256,"My  appointment was canceled because J&amp;J, now it'll probably be another month before I can get jabbed, waiting lists in my area (central coast CA) are ridiculous."
16257,Everyone over 16 you mean.
16258,"So again if you double down even though your last post was an obvious back peddle, then my drunk driving analogy still holds."
16259,When something is obviously dangerous and bad things haven’t happened *yet* that does not mean bad things won’t happen so we should keep tempting fate.

16261,No he has not done a masterful job in any sense of the word.
16262,The state is doing better despite him...literally.
16263,"Mainly because he lied his ass off and did everything to make it worse yet people *shockingly* ignored him, distanced, wore masks and are now getting the vaccine anyway...where exactly did he make it better?"
16264,He politicized it and got people killed then tries to hide how bad it was.
16265,"Your lazy attempts at rewriting the facts is nothing more than disingenuous, partisan, political bullshit"
16266,It would be nice if they included the positivity rate.
16267,"Might be because the idea (may even dare to call it "" the reality"") that the pandemic (in America) is ending isn't something that gets a ton of airtime."
16268,"In our highly polarized and sensationalist media landscape, most outlets are taking one of the two stances:  
  
* COVID-19 was never a huge deal in the first place and the restrictions come from ulterior motives  
  
* The pandemic is nowhere near over because variants and also kids can't get vaccinated yet and there are too many anti-vaxxers and also vaccines don't actually work and..."
16269,"If either of those is your ""reality"", the questions you pose aren't all that pertinent."
16270,"And unfortunately, most Americans aren't particularly tuned in beyond cable news and Facebook posts, so those are the ""realities"" people are living in."
16271,Yeah but Modena is giving a dose at least two times what is needed.
16272,Honestly - everyone I know who has been impacted by side effects has had Moderna.
16273,That second dose seems to really wipe people out.
16274,The younger the age - the worse the wipe out.
16275,Our clinic constantly has 1-5 no shows a day.
16276,We scramble to call people to come in so we don’t waste any doses.
16277,It’s absolutely worth calling your local smaller clinics and asking them to call you if they have any cancellations.

16289,Doesn’t Pfizer give more like 50% after the first dose?
16290,"An unfortunate truth is that the more open a country is, the more that it's reputation will be damaged because people will know all the bad things that are happening there."
16291,"Actual authoritarian states (despite what reddit thinks, Bolsonaro and Trump are the exact opposite: they're hands-off libertarians) have much better-looking numbers because they can just lie and threaten/control the media."
16292,"As someone who got J&amp;J 4 weeks ago, I guess I’m one of the 999,999:1,000,000."
16293,Worst side effect was a subtle headache.
16294,Please consider the actual risks and have educated conversations with friends and family who are scared over the pause.
16295,They should’ve been more scared if we *didn’t* pause to assess the risks like this.
16296,Maybe some would prefer inactivated virus vs. experimental mRNA?
16297,I would take the j and j but eveeeeerywhere in NJ is completely booked.
16298,In the US there are many people seeking out the J&amp;J vaccine since it’s one and done.
16299,And had a reputation for fewer make you take a day off of work side effects.
16300,Its crazy to think that the pandemic started a bit over a year ago and already 12% of the entire population of the Earth is vaccinated.
16301,That are for corporate governance and that alone.
16302,"They will adhere to any Christian rhetoric, or anti-anything as long as it garners votes and keeps the power in the hands of corporations."
16303,Prove me wrong.
16304,The problem isn't those kids and their parties .
16305,It's the fact that I'm forced to sit in an office with a bunch of other people from different households for 8 hours because the virus avoids offices like the plague  but everything that's not work and is in any form associated with fun is prohibited .
16306,No wonder nobody is following rules anymore (if you actually know what the rules are because they also change all the time )
16307,"I find it pretty ridiculous to continue restricting your life after you are fully vaccinated, at least if you're in one of the many areas of the country that has the virus relatively under control now (the current slight national increase is pretty narrowly limited to a handful of problem areas)."
16308,"In my state, we only have under 10 daily infections per 100k people."
16309,"So at any given time, only a little over a hundred people out of a hundred thousand have active covid here (very rough estimate based on a ~2 week infectious period)."
16310,And some of those people are going to be feeling sick and staying home.
16311,So I've got probably worse than a thousand to one odds of any person I encounter to be currently infected.
16312,"And if I do encounter an active case, there's no guarantee I'll actually catch it (since you don't automatically catch covid just by encountering it, not even close)."
16313,"And if I would catch it, well I'm fully vaccinated, so that's a 90+% reduced chance that I'll be infected in that situation."
16314,"And If I DO get infected, new findings are showing that my viral load should be 75% reduced, giving me a 90+% reduced chance of infecting anyone else with it."
16315,"And if I would infect someone else with it, they might (or I think it's far to say at this point in my state, they *should*) be vaccinated as well, giving them a 90% reduced chance of catching it from me."
16316,"And then even if ALL those hugely unlikely events all occur in a row and I actually manage to infect another person with coronavirus... there's still a huge probably that they're asymptomatic, or at least won't have a severe case."
16317,"I mean, at what point is the odds of actually hurting someone via covid so microscopically low that it's no longer worth altering my life for?"
16318,"As far as I'm concerned, I passed that point several powers of 10 ago."

16422,"He is very smart but, like other people, he is guilty of making COVID political at times which is unfortunate."

16425,How do the mods allow the post of this bs and not other stuff?
16426,"Seriously, it's like asking a thermometer to tell you the time and then getting mad at it because it keeps responding with 74 degrees."
16427,Attributing the vaccines creation and speed at which it was developed to the trump administration is what doesn't make sense.
16428,Warp speed was essentially a pre-order of the vaccines.
16429,Trumps claims it was because of him we have a vaccine are just downright false.

16459,You have it the other way around.
16460,Most of the other countries who received their vaccines 1st received them under emergency approval from their governing body and bypassed their normal acceptence guidelines.
16461,"NZ, for example, had purchase agreements in place with 4 different manufacters pretty much the same time as everyone else but given it's situation was able to use Medsafe's normal appeoval process and had the luxury of also seeing real world results in other countries."

16464,It was known from the beginning that supply will always be a problem but it'll get better from Q2.
16465,"If your relatives are 60+, they're in prio3, we have 22 mln people for the first two prio groups and  received merely a supply of 25 mln doses so far."
16466,So it's pretty logical that 60+ have to wait until enough supply is there.
16467,Even prio3 has almost 15 mln people which means we'll hear continuous complains from millions as the supply will cover 4-5 millions each week.
16468,"As published [today](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus/faq-covid-19-impfung.html), we'll receive about 58 mln doses in Q2 just from BNT + Moderna."
16469,And vaccination is ramping up after Easter.
16470,"So it's not all doomsay as original OP implied, we have to neither wait until the end of the year nor forever!"
16471,Not true!
16472,My wife is fully vaxxed and she and I utilize astral projection weekly to commune with spirits in other planes.
16473,Admittedly we had to adjust our ritual by rearranging some of our crystals and swapping out a couple of our salt pillars with new ones but it’s not been an issue at all!
16474,Now if you want to talk about the REAL effects of the vaccine and reasons not to get it you’ll get no argument from me regarding the absolute antagonism we’ve receive from koi fish since she became fully vaxxed.
16475,"As far as I understand it, the vaccine can dilate your third eye and the koi fish absolutely HATE it."
16476,We’ve had to stop stealing them from our neighbors pond but it’s worth it I guess.
16477,"The public wants to return to normal life without masks after they're vaccinated, but there is no messaging that lifting masks mandates and other restrictions will happen any time soon."
16478,Sports and universities seem they will still require masks even when they want proof fans and students are vaccinated.
16479,"I dunno, you're the one trying to normalize mask wearing."
16480,Both shots of Moderna tore me up pretty bad.

16515,I'm increasingly skeptical of people who still hang on every word Fauci says.
16516,Quite the opposite.
16517,That’s partially why it’s political if you antagonize people further into the “opposite side”
16518,Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong.
16519,A vast majority of people infected produce ample antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection.
16520,The only real upside to him getting the vaccine is another standardized boost of immunity.
16521,Though statistically speaking he is almost surely immune for years assuming he didn't get the slightest of infections (incredibly uncommon).
16522,Everybody here really wants Fauci to imagine some finish line and magic end date where everything is all normal all over again and is also right this second
16523,"Well, this is /r/Coronavirus, but the title could still have clarified a bit more."

16540,This is a really hard question to answer.
16541,Sinopharm is probably the worst vaccine of the bunch.
16542,It works fairly well against the OG strain of Covid but it isn’t working well against variants.
16543,"Still, even against the Brazil variant which appears to be the worst— it has a 50% chance of preventing symptomatic Covid and an 80% chance of reducing severe infection and death."
16544,That’s about as good as a flu shot.
16545,"If the entire world got that, we’d be in a pretty good state."
16546,The *worst* part of it is how long it takes to become effective.
16547,"Most shots work after just one dose— AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, they all give you strong protection two weeks after one dose."
16548,"It doesn’t look like Sinopharm works at all after the first dose, according to the Chilean data just published... so you really need to act like you aren’t vaccinated until two weeks after the second dose."
16549,Sputnik is where things get complicated.
16550,"Because if you believe the one single study that has been published, it has a ludicrously high efficacy rate— higher than even the mRNA varieties."
16551,This is likely primarily against the OG and UK strains but it’s still unbelievably good.
16552,The issue is if you BELIEVE the study... cause it comes from Russia.
16553,From a state run organization.
16554,The Chinese vaccine now has several other countries that have studied it and published results.
16555,"We know the Chinese vaccine works, there are independent studies."
16556,We only know the Russian vaccine works from the people who make it.
16557,"Personally, I think Russia’s vaccine works, if only because the first shot is verrrry close to how J&amp;j’s vaccine works (which makes sense since AZ and J&amp;J were supposedly hit hard by hackers during the vaccine process) and it’s entirely possible Russian scientists really perfected the second shot to make it much more effective."
16558,But there are more unknown risks with Russia’s vaccine than anyone else.
16559,"Sorry I didn’t really make your decision easier, but maybe with more information, you can come to a more firm conclusion."
16560,Cash incentive.
16561,"$20 bill for receiving a vaccine, handed to the recipient immediately after injection."
16562,"Thank God people like you aren't in charge, then."
16563,"It's logical on an individual level, but at a population level it'll slow down vaccination efforts, increase variants, etc."
16564,"I'd say that unless you're in the US, where we have boatloads of the good stuff, then just take whatever you can get to help the effort."
16565,And wants to see the world burn.
16566,I really doubt we remotely have the supply to meet this demand.
16567,No I’m asking you because you so confidently stated it as fact.
16568,Just link to your source.
16569,"Also I don’t have a psychiatrist, never have."
16570,Please.
16571,Somehow canada managed to negotiate the additional doses and we were bottom of the list too.
16572,The reality is it's not really that important.
16573,Everyone is locked on the island.
16574,You could stay like this for years with no problem 😂
16575,"&gt; You also have to admit that comments like that are intensely controversial

That whole exchange with Jim Jordan I feel was massively negative for the vaccination effort."
16576,"Jordan merely asked for quantifiable metrics that indicate restrictions can be lifted and Fauci just kept smugly chuckling and saying more or less, ""when I say so."""
16577,So we've got our leader in this crisis refusing to put numbers to lifting restrictions and also saying that vaccinated people still have to have the same restrictions as the unvaccinated.
16578,"Well then, why get vaccinated?"
16579,There's no increase in liberty from it and no goal to hit to get back to normal.
16580,"I’m notorious for fainting after shots, I absolutely despise needles.... but I hate covid more so I signed up as soon as I could, I didn’t faint after either of the covid vaccines though!"
16581,"But it’s NOT about liberty, it’s about public and personal health...period."
16582,But it doesn’t work.
16583,"At least not sustainable enough that it doesn’t rise back up as soon as it’s lifted, so what’s the exact point?"
16584,Evil.

Please see figure 7."
16586,Flu season often persists into May before really flattening out in June.
16587,"Not a country music fan, lol."
16588,"Accepted sure, but here in Canada (Ontario specifically) the commonly spouted media/political narrative is that our third wave is due to variants and the Premier easing restrictions too early."
16589,"But in actuality it is quite common for Canada to have a third wave of respiratory infections in March-May, and there are places where even after B117 became dominant there was no major surge in infection."
16590,They actually said differently during the meeting.
16591,"They haven't reviewed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia cases yet, but are in the process of doing so (only for J&amp;J, they only said that they weren't examining Pfizer and Moderna at this time)

The UK guidance is to suspect VIPT/VITT in patients with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia regardless of which vaccine they received."
16592,So it seems their safety monitoring must have indicated that it could happen with other vaccines as well.

16594,"I got the Pfizer vaccine, and when they auto-scheduled my follow up, it was for 28 days later."
16595,It's so weird.
16596,"Again, **I want the mandate to no longer be needed**."
16597,I just hope that people with health concerns can more freely wear them if they want in the future.
16598,But numbskulls will probably mess it up.
16599,&gt;We need less divisive language and more positivity and promotion around vaccination.
16600,"Are you including Fauci's quote when you talk about divisive language, because I find his statement to be pretty divisive."
16601,[removed]
16602,This gives the impression that anyone not experiencing serious symptoms post-vaccine isn't developing as strong of immunity.
16603,"Really, whether you experience more serious symptoms or not following the vaccine just has to do with a difference in how your body responds, not on the level of immunity it's developing."
16604,"That said, I'd be a bit nervous if I didn't experience a sore shoulder."

16694,A huge majority of younger people don’t deal with serious effects (spare me anecdotes).

16712,Because then the amount of risk associated with Covid will be acceptable enough for us to move on with our lives.
16713,"If we’ve been handling the flu wrong, then why were there no mask mandates over the last 100 years?"
16714,Why was society not locked down every flu season to prevent spread?
16715,I’ll tell you why: because that would be insane.
16716,"We have flu vaccines and treatments, so we can handle it no problem."
16717,"Thousands of people still die from it every year, but no one batted an eye at it because we accepted the fact that we can’t save everyone and that there are way more important things in life to worry about."
16718,Covid will get to that point too once we hit herd immunity.
16719,I think 14-17 would be better since that's the age that kids start getting jobs (such as a cashier).
16720,At least that's the norm where I live
16721,"this guy begs to differ - yes, likely an isolated case but we can certainly wait a few more months for more data (especially when cases remain plateau-ed so high)

16722,All adults in the country won’t even be eligible for vaccination until tomorrow.
16723,That we got this far before vaccines were even opened up to everybody is incredible.
16724,Those numbers are far better than these numbers (which do you go with?

16727,"Yeah, it seems to be what governments are planning for."
16728,I haven't heard anything from the US though.
16729,It seems that most states are declaring it the end either now or in a couple months time.

16744,In the context of the presentation they were noting mRNA vaccines had very high effectiveness at 95%.
16745,That's very high.
16746,67% is not.
16747,It's decent.
16748,Not sure what is confusing here.
16749,Other countries aren't reporting lower numbers.
16750,Turkey reported 84% effectiveness.
16751,Indonesia 65%.
16752,Brazil was actually the outlier at 50%.
16753,Seems like you're looking for a scandal that isn't there.
16754,You be you and get your information from that decidedly liberal rag called the Sun-Sentinel.
16755,Meanwhile the rest of us will actually enjoy not living in a police state like New York or California that are led by bumbling idiots - one “science”- and “data”-following imbecile whose actions made matters worse and is facing a recall and the other a grandma-killing lecherous piece of shit Marlin Brando wannabe.
16756,"Oh, and let’s not forget CadaverJoe."
16757,He’s doing great!
16758,I had a pretty bad reaction to my second Pfizer vaccine as well.
16759,"I was totally fine for 9 hours, then it hit me like a ton of bricks and I deteriorated fast."
16760,"102 fever, entire body hurt badly, and chills that wouldn’t go away no matter how many blankets and layers I put on."
16761,"The fever and chills went away after 4-5 hours, but the body aches persisted and I developed a splitting headache."
16762,"Then just as quickly as it onset, it went away about 20 hours after I got the shot."
16763,The headline is literally what the official said.
16764,"What’s more, we aren’t comparing it to flu vaccines."
16765,We are comparing it to other coronavirus vaccines and it fairs poorly in most of the data that is available.
16766,How is that misleading?
16767,K
16768,I really hope people of India vote modi out.
16769,First term was demonetization and now this fuck up
16770,We don't need people to take this thing if they don't wan to.
16771,By we I mean the US.
16772,We have more than enough options to cover everyone.
16773,This vaccine will be needed elsewhere where people don't have the luxury of choosing which vaccine they would prefer.
16774,I don't think so.
16775,"Last I read about the vaccine associated clotting it was similar to heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) where platelets are very low, but there's still a state of increased clotting."
16776,There was some theorizing the mechanism might be anti-platelet antibody mediated like HIT is.
16777,"Birth control (the pill) causes blood clots because of estrogen, which is inherently prothrombotic."
16778,That’s amazing.
16779,Now do more for the UK as well please
16780,Young people need to understand that they CAN get hospitalized simply because there are a ton of young adults in America who are overweight or have some other condition.
16781,And many young people are Vitamin D deficient due to having darker skin and living at a latitude where they can't absorb enough sunlight to produce sufficient Vitamin D.
16782,Yeah exactly it's not a flu.
16783,It's SARS.
16784,We made this mistake at the begining and it fucked us.
16785,The flu has specific mechanism that allows it change and return each year.
16786,If covid mutates past the vaccine it is absolutely back to square one.
16787,New pandemic.
16788,Now hopefully we have a head start if that happens now.
16789,But it won't go away and come back.
16790,It will just keep burning in many places if not controlled.
16791,And as you can get infected after the vaccine that actually creates selection pressure for ones that aren't affected.
16792,So we still need to stop the spread.
16793,"That’s cap, showing up to work doesn’t require having a needle inside me"
16794,[removed]
16795,It does contradict it when in the world of vaccines 67% is respectable.
16796,The lower numbers reported by other countries and this CDC head’s comments all point towards something significantly less effective than what Chile is reporting.
16797,Doesn’t mean Chile is wrong or is fudging the facts (we can’t really know that) but the Chinese government does have a track record of dishonesty and manipulation that makes any claims that put this vaccine in a light that contradicts other sources in need of verification.
16798,lol i like how they took away your verified specialist badge
16799,"I’m allergic to penicillin and a lot of antibiotics, plus I’m only 24, so I’ve been chalking it up to that combo"

16804,They can't lie to people for the greater good.
16805,Compared to mRNA definitely not.
16806,Compared to the typical seasonal flu vaccine it’s about the same or more.
16807,Headline is misleading.
16808,"So I saw the out of 77 million people in the US that have been fully vaccinated, 74 people died from Covid."
16809,I know the vaccines are not 100% but any reason why some people are more likely to die than others even though they are fully vaccinated?
16810,Yes!
16811,Not sure if I had covid asymptotically and didn’t realize.
16812,Or maybe it’s because young people have stronger reactions (16).
16813,"It could also be random, who knows."
16814,Five hours post vaccine and I'm still feeling completely normal :) no side effects here thankfully
16815,"Yeah I’m glad I’m not the only one, my parents are getting on my ass about doing stuff but I’m so tired 😓 the trip wasn’t my idea in the first place though."

16822,"I mean I had to give my driver's license number to get one, I'm sure there is a database somewhere."
16823,Try to maintain your distance and you yourself wear a mask if possible if you’re concerned.
16824,"Otherwise, while not like 2019, risk is minimal, especially if you yourself are vaccinated."
16825,[deleted]
16826,The CDC has published great data on those issues.
16827,"South Africa still has the jury out, but the Brazillian variant is no problem for the vaccine."
16828,"The data they do have is that the South African variant may or may not be more likely to break through because studies are small, but the vaccine certainly has an effect."
16829,"Hence ""especially vaccines like AZ and J&amp;J"" - newsflash, the US isn't the only country in the world"
16830,"Can believe his nerve, not being a doctor for free."
16831,"It's been said a million times, but I think it's worth mentioning that the case rise was largely led by a small number of states, especially Michigan."
16832,"&gt;Michigan continued to lead the states, with nearly twice as many new cases per 100,000 people last week as Rhode Island and New Jersey, the states with the next highest rates of infection based on population."
16833,"Nevertheless I think it's the last time we're going to see an increasing case average during the course of the ""emergency"" part of the pandemic."
16834,I think there will be other rises but they'll be small and somewhat isolated.
16835,"Now that a majority of adults are vaccinated and even the biggest surges are declining again, I think the conversation is almost entirely going to be focused on maintaining vaccine acceleration and returning to normal."
16836,People just aren't that worried about containment as much now that *most* Americans are protected.
16837,"48 million doses by the end of June, actually!"
16838,Not including J&amp;J.
16839,Although administering them won’t be as quick.
16840,I'm glad.
16841,"I'm 15 and if everything is open by memorial day like half this sub thinks, I want to be protected."
16842,"I get it won't kill me, but I just really don't want to get sick"
16843,"Then, if nothing else, don't stop doing the stuff we did before vaccines."
16844,I'm gonna have my second dose first.
16845,"As much as I hate it, would advertising it as a war on the virus, maybe work"
16846,Its hilarious how your comment actually goes both ways and most people didn't even realize this.
16847,/r/RedditMoment
16848,Similar situation for us.
16849,My kids really liked school.
16850,"They're good students, enjoy learning, all that."
16851,This online crap for realistically about 90 minutes a day is awful.
16852,"They hate it, they're not learning anything, and they miss their friends terribly."
16853,"Our district and the teachers union are talking about continue this ""hybrid"" model into the fall semester as well."
16854,That would be devastating.
16855,YAWN!!!
16856,Yeha yeah yeah
16857,This article misses one crucial fact: the risk of covid is not constant.
16858,*It is actively and steadily going down every day*.
16859,"It's not low enough yet--thousands of Americans are still dying per week--but it will be very low by, like, June."
16860,"If we knew that car crashes would basically go away in two months, maybe it *would* be a good idea to wait before driving."
16861,Germany has about half the deaths per  capta as the uk
16862,"My parents and inlaws aren't anti-maskers, but also weren't especially cautious."
16863,They masked and went about their lives.
16864,That has been true of most older people I know.
16865,Thankfully none caught covid and they got vaccinated as soon as they were eligible.
16866,It's been such a relief.
16867,"I feel really bad for your MIL, the public health messaging really needs to change."
16868,"In my opinion, by May 1, hesitancy will be a bigger issue than supply and the government will change the messaging to be more hopeful."
16869,"The media has people terrified of breakthrough cases and deaths when they're incredibly rare, like the article mentions."
16870,Thats pathetic.
16871,6 hours of paid sick leave per month if you work 40 hours per week.
16872,"If you fall seriously ill, for example with covid you will still go without money for at least a week during your quarantine."
16873,What’s ‘disturbing ‘ is Fauci continuing his doomsday power trip requiring vaccinated individuals to fully masks.
16874,The CDC data says the risk of contracting covid is less than .007% he is absolutely ridiculous
16875,"Oh god, we now have 14 year olds commenting on a Coronavirus subreddit thinking they know what they’re talking about."
16876,Reddit is doomed
16877,You did actually make it a bit easier because I didn't know the exact numbers with regards to sinopharm and covid variants.
16878,"I'm leaning more and more towards sinopharm tbh, and this further solidifes that decision."
16879,"It's not the best option (I live in Guyana which is a country bordering Brazil so their variant is a real concern over here), but I feel like there's too many red flags surrounding the Russian vaccine."
16880,"I don't doubt that it works, but the fact that the studies were only done by the Russians themselves and reportedly only 2 studies with 38 participants each is concerning to me."
16881,Along with it not being approved by the Medical safety board/council in that region.
16882,"I'm also not going to lie about it, a part of me feels like they're more concerned with competing with America than the actual safety of the vaccine."
16883,"But considering I'm asking for my sister and not myself, I wanted to double check with others so that I wouldn't let my personal feelings cloud my judgment when making a recommendation."
16884,Ultimately it's her choice though.

16886,There is more than one doctor.
16887,Wasn’t the rollout based on Trump’s warp speed effort?
16888,I’m genuinely asking
16889,Finally.
16890,We should see the new case count drop off as the first doses kick in.
16891,I like how you reported me for incivility just for pointing out that your argument is flawed and my post was being upvoted.
16892,Mods here are so cowardly
16893,"I told the nurses ahead of time and they were nice about it and put up with me, tried to calm me down, and then talked to me while it happened."
16894,The only annoying person was a very enthusiastic woman I sat next to in the waiting area.
16895,"She was VERY excited about getting the vaccine and wanted to tell me, I was just trying to regulate my breathing."

16901,The west bank is not annexed.
16902,It is occupied.
16903,Remember how vaccines work— you have antibodies fighting the virus off immediately upon entry.
16904,"While Long Covid isn’t understood, it’s damage done to your body by the virus."
16905,"The vaccines, even weaker ones, stop Covid from doing as much damage."
16906,I got my second dose of Pfizer on Saturday.
16907,"I made sure to hydrate, get enough rest and eat well, and didn't experience really any side effects."
16908,"On Saturday night, I felt like I could have been slightly feverish, but it's hard to tell if that was just in my head or I was actually developing a bit of a fever."
16909,"In any event, second dose is done and full efficacy will be reached by May 1st!"
16910,!
16911,I'm guessing this is because it is not fully FDA approved.
16912,This will likely change when it becomes fully approved.
16913,[removed]
16914,Legit question here.
16915,If this doesn’t stop you from getting covid or spreading it and still having to wear a mask why bother?
16916,This is just like a flu shot you will need to get yearly.
16917,So you are hit less hard but that’s it.
16918,Is there any other benefit?
16919,Literally incomplete?
16920,I was under the impression they did the complete clinical trial.
16921,We need herd immunity because some subset of the population is vulnerable and cannot be vaccinated.
16922,"If we abandon restrictions prematurely, those people will be put at unnecessary risk."
16923,"which is asinine, and no one is following that advice."
16924,This but unironically
16925,The day after I was in extreme pain head to toe.
16926,"Not just soreness- pain, all of my muscles and could feel it in bones, so badly that I couldn’t sleep or lay still."
16927,My head has been in pain ever since.
16928,I vomited.
16929,"My neck and my head still hurt and it’s hard to move them, my eyes even hurt when I move them quickly."
16930,I’m really lethargic.
16931,It’s bad.
16932,"However, from what I’m seeing it’s not the norm, but it’s best to just be prepared."
16933,It would be absolutely tragic to die mere days before getting the vaccine.
16934,We got 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter of this pandemic and we're in the lead.
16935,Just play it safe for a few more weeks until you get the shot and it kicks in.
16936,The case fatality rate is nearly 2%.
16937,I guess the ultimate question is how many infections are we missing that would drive that number down.
16938,"&gt;Even the facts sheets are filled with ""we aren't sure's"" and ""unknowns""."
16939,You know this is true about a lot of drugs that are out there and have been used for decades?

16942,This has nothing to do with China.
16943,"I, a random redditor, was reading about Coronavirus at the beginning of January 2020."
16944,To say that we didn't have time to prepare is ludacris.
16945,"Good, now if only THOSE people in the US could be mature enough not to make stupid assumptions about the vaccine and end making surges happen because I'd  like my country to catch up with the rest of the world"
16946,"I mean just because you're eligible, doesn't mean you've been able to get an appointment..."
16947,"&gt; it's believed there may be an increased risk of asymptomatic spread

Which makes total sense when you think about it."
16948,"With infections that actually make it past the vaccine, those infections are much weaker, less dangerous and less likely to kill you."
16949,"If its getting downgraded across the board because of an enhanced immune system, it makes sense we'd see more asymptomatic infection- the weakest outcome of covid."
16950,"Yes, *you* are fine."
16951,But you can spread it to *others*.
16952,Like children we haven't vaccinated yet.
16953,I'm continually astounded in regards to what gets downvoted around here.
16954,"Okay so you are actually adjusting your behavior based on the opinions of the people you see getting interviewed on the news, rather than on a quantitative risk assessment."
16955,The accuracy of infections will generally not be know unless it's a comparison to the last calendar period to compare any changes.
16956,I think this is a much bigger motive for avoiding the vaccine than most people realize.
16957,If getting a vaccine means being forced back to the office many people won't get it
16958,You can all sneeze in each others mouth and you'll be fine!
16959,"See, is that true though?"
16960,Can we remove the masks after a certain percentage have been vaxed?

16967,It's different for everybody.
16968,Me personally I planned on working through the symptoms after the 2nd dose figuring it probably wasn't as bad as it was being made out to be.
16969,"Went to work (day after shot) feeling fatigued but ok. By lunchtime I had a fever of 102.4, every joint in my body hurt (especially behind my knees), and I just felt like death warmed over."
16970,"Took sick time to leave work, something I almost never do, and rode it out at home."
16971,Next morning I was completely better felt kinda giddy in fact.
16972,Everyone reacts differently.
16973,They will.
16974,"At least for germany, for example just looking at pfitzer/biontech, we right now have 2.5M doses a week, starting next week it will be 3.5M doses a week for 5 weeks and then increase to 5M doses a week."
16975,"In addtion, Moderna is currently basically zero and will ramp up, too."
16976,"In my family and circle of friends and co-workers, literally everyone who wants a vaccine (which anecdotally has been about 90% of them) has received at least one dose, about half of which have received two."
16977,My “local” population (people I interact with) has likely already reached herd immunity.
16978,fixed

16993,It was done by people who had been paid by Pfizer.
16994,There's a reason they have to disclose that stuff.
16995,It matters sometimes.
16996,One author is a current member on Pfizer's advisory board.
16997,I think that might be relevant.
16998,I wonder what the venn diagram of people who suffer ED and own guns or a big truck looks like...🤔
16999,You want to hear something funny?
17000,"My New Year's resolution for 2020 (as in, 1/1/20) was to quit watching the news."
17001,Irresponsible clickbait like this almost makes me want to try that resolution again.
17002,I don't know if this is really the way to convince people.
17003,"Wow, some people are just good at their jobs, lol."
17004,That's some good bedside manner!
17005,It's only a felony or 10 to use one
17006,"Yeah, we've been told by our chief medical officer that all adults will get there first shot by June."
17007,Hopefully that's the case across the country!
17008,"Exactly, we're missing important parts of human connection and language."
17009,It's been hell on the hearing impaired.
17010,Can you imagine being deaf this year?
17011,Imagine the anger if everyone kept it up just in case.
17012,It would be like a nearly silent world for a blind person.
17013,its ok to feel weird!
17014,"if you're not comfortable yet, keep taking care and wearing a mask in crowded places or in public transport."
17015,"we still dont know what may happen but if in a few weeks of no mask requirement cases are still low, thats your sign that everything is actuallly better!"
17016,It really just depends on the trial and what they’re looking for.
17017,"Some will have very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that patients have to meet, and they’re written both for patient safety and so that the data is easier to interpret later."
17018,If you’re signing up to be a “healthy volunteer” (basically the control group that doesn’t get any kind of medication or treatment) you’re unlikely to hear back because we have tons of people who are happy to be in this group.
17019,"If you’re signing up for specific disease or disorder medication or procedure trials, like I said, it may just not be a good fit for you at the moment in terms of eligibility."
17020,Check out ResearchMatch or StudySearch.
17021,You can type in your disease of interest and see if there are any trials near you currently recruiting.
17022,"If you have a big university medical center near you, check out their clinical trials pages or call the disease group and ask to be put in touch with the research coordinator for that group (ie if you have hypertension ask for the cardiology research coordinator or if you have multiple sclerosis, ask for the immunology group research coordinator)."
17023,Once you get in touch let them know you suffer from x and want to know if they have any trials for x.
17024,What the fuck does this have to do with the subject at hand?
17025,What are you trying to accomplish?
17026,Learn to debate like an adult.
17027,I have a friend who's normally a pretty rational thinker that is hesitant to take the vaccine because of people going on about how bad they were affected from it.
17028,"So I can say from experience that fear is real regarding these, some people have an irrational fear of needles to begin with but saying they're gonna get stuck and 100% be in pain the following day can overshadow the benefits of getting the vaccination."
17029,"I've even gone over my own experience with her and how little it did to me; first shot felt like a small bruise on my arm, second shot was aches and chills for 8 hours but nothing too bad, and it really didn't do much to change her mind because 5 other people were talking about how badly they got knocked by the ""dreaded second dose."""
17030,It's ridiculous but baby gloves need to be on at all times with just about everyone with regards to vaccinations because even people you would expect a little better of might have an irrational fear that they're always looking for ways to justify.
17031,"As for your theory, I think you're way overthinking that."
17032,"Not everything's some facebook conspiracy level thing, basic people can have basic fears, and any form of pain is often one of them."
17033,"They need to be handled a bit more gently, told everything's alright, and given a lollipop afterwards like a kid so they're sure to come back for future vaccinations and boosters."
17034,Nice!
17035,I’m kinda nervous because I’ve passed out at doctors offices and out patient centers in the past.
17036,"No real reason either time, it just happens."
17037,Still gonna show up on Wednesday and hope for the best lol I just hope if I do pass out it’s after I get the shot
17038,Because I don't want something that was hastily studied and produced pumped into my body.
17039,What I want to know is how many people in here with their vaccines are shitting on those of us who don't want it when they themselves are anti vaxers 🤣
17040,No thank you.
17041,"""hurr durr religion bad""

Go back to r/atheism"
17042,"Yeah, several headlines, including one from CBS, were changed in a way that supports your theory."
17043,Getting my second a few days before you.
17044,TBH it was and will be a way more emotional moment than I would have thought.
17045,This last year plus has been such a shitshow and to think this summer might be within shouting distance of normal feels weird.
17046,"Not planning *anything* until late June/early July as a jic, above &amp; beyond the minimum 2 week wait for full effect."
17047,"Still, just thinking about it makes me want to be super careful and not fuck things up."
17048,The only guns Biden wants to outlaw were already banned as recently as the 90s.
17049,"Solutions such as red flag laws, universal background checks, 3 day waiting periods, and training/licensure would address not just mass shootings but suicides and domestics."
17050,Sorry that hurts your feelings.
17051,Lmfao fr

17054,I'm not vaccinated.
17055,I wish I were but I am not old enough to be eligible yet.
17056,The problem is they are refusing while everyone under 55 remains unvaccinated
17057,"This may be true for many people, but it certainly isn't true for all."
17058,"Also, even if others take their masks off, I can still keep mine on"
17059,A relative says he wants to see the long term affects of the vaccination.
17060,🙄
17061,The long term effect is that the American public now knows the CDC is willing to lie if they feel it's appropriate.
17062,"How can they tell us to ""trust the plan"" and ""do as we're told"" when they're an organization that's knowingly lied without so much as an apology?"
17063,God the term “crotch goblin” is so cringe.
17064,Stop trying to be edgy and call it a baby for fuck’s sake
17065,"When you look at the various simulations out there for herd immunity , there is a very quick drop in infections once you get over 60% and then it plummets from there as you get to 70-80% herd immunity."
17066,So your information about Israel and comparison to the U.S. makes sense.

17078,"If these vaccines aren’t going to get people back to normal, what will?"

17108,I aint gonna lie I felt better before i took first dose.
17109,Just saying.
17110,Never felt this drowsiness bullshit before.
17111,1 more dose before my hand falls off.
17112,That’s great about bingo!
17113,I agree but I think it’s been long overdue to further update it.
17114,"It’s causing vaccine hesitancy, I guarantee it."
17115,Emojis don't make you more credible here.
17116,They might on extremist websites but we aren't that dumb here.
17117,The second option sounds good to me.
17118,"and every time I say we won’t be able to open up because of kids, I get downvoted."
17119,but here you go folx.
17120,"the messaging is already getting to people who think covid isn’t safe for kids, and y’all really still think “omg summer will be normal!"
17121,july 4th!
17122,fall!” no sir.
17123,lockdowns are here to stay
17124,Almost certainly not.
17125,"I would say no, but they may be weird about it, who knows."
17126,Did you match manufacturers of your last two flu vaccines?
17127,"If the government told these people to kiss a baby, they'd punch the baby's face on principle, then gloat about how patriotic they are."
17128,"I know, the US has some of the best quality healthcare in the world....if you can afford it."
17129,But the average joe runs from America if they need to find medical treatments.
17130,I just had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and it just made me tired and hot.
17131,I never thought to take my temp but I woke up in the night with my shirt damp.
17132,"By day 2 I was back to normal, just sore arm."
17133,"I’ll be ready for dose two tho, might just take the following day off work"
17134,"If the kid starts having vaccination side effects, it's a good indication they got the real thing."
17135,"But if they really want to know, go get an antibody test."
17136,Probably not everywhere.
17137,There are lots of sites in Ohio that have little to no demand for the shots.
17138,Demand is way down and infections are on the way up.
17139,Probably because they reached 56% vaccinated.
17140,But they’ve already said that vaccines need to be readministered in six months.
17141,"If herd immunity isn’t reached by then, it’s because stupid people didn’t get the vaccine."
17142,And thus thy cycle will continue.
17143,And they will continue to keep blaming it on democrats.
17144,I know a few people who say it is too early to know the medium to long term side-affects and don't want to risk it.
17145,"All of these people agree the blood clot issue is a non-issue, given how rare it is, and that it does not influence their thinking, but still don't think we know enough right now."
17146,"These people have various personal timelines as to when it is ""okay"" for them to get it ranging from 6 months to 2 years from now before they're satisfied about safety."
17147,Crazy how the UK and the US which were some of the most incompetent countries in the pandemic have some of the best vaccination rates currently.
17148,If only we used the vast resources we have from an earlier time.
17149,"I only know one that had strong reactions to both, and that was my son's therapist."
17150,"The first laid him out for nearly a week, and the second he described as being so bad that ""it made the first dose seem like they gave me friendly hug instead of a vaccine."""
17151,"Other than that, the same, for those I know that have gotten 2 shots."
17152,Wait longer rather than getting it too soon.
17153,You have up to 42 days/six weeks between doses.
17154,In another week there will be increased availability near you.
17155,I suspect being mostly isolated for long periods of time can also make some more fearful than they would otherwise be.
17156,Some found it shocking because it’s sudden and some feel it “dilutes the purpose of the alert” which idk I think using it makes sense.
17157,They were able to reach everyone in Virginia at once with a link to sign up.
17158,If you don’t follow the news and don’t read reddit I think it’s possible to not realize you are eligible
17159,Check out the study I posted below.
17160,"Again, small sample size, but it implies that moderna and Pfizer produce similar t-cell responses."
17161,"I agree it is frustrating that almost nobody, including moderna themselves, seem to be saying much if anything about Moderna t-cells."
17162,I guess I am fortunate.
17163,I know of no one who has died from Covid nor were hospitalized from Covid.
17164,"While I directly know 27 people who got Covid, none ended up in the hospital."
17165,If the vaccine doesn’t convince a person they are protected to go out then they have a terrible understanding of the post-vaccination risk assessment.
17166,"""12"" 1️⃣3️⃣"
17167,Why don't you believe the vaccine is right for you?
17168,Walgreens filled mine out wrong
17169,"2nd shot of pfizer knocked my wife on her ass for 24hrs, for me it was just a sore arm, fatigue and a headache."
17170,"I'm scheduled for my second Pfizer dose on Saturday (2 hour drive away), but there's availability to get it 2 days early at a facility 5 minutes from my home."
17171,"CDC says up to 4 days early is OK, has anyone else received an early second dose?"
17172,"SARS, MERS, COVID-19."
17173,"It's clear that Coronaviruses in particular pose a significant threat, so this is a good avenue to pursue."
17174,"But evolution being as good as it is, we still have to be prepared to respond much more quickly when something else inevitably breaks out, either a vaccine-breaking coronavirus or from another family entirely."
17175,"Getting vaccines approved in a year truly was ""warp speed"" compared to the status quo, but we need to get that response time down to months, even weeks."
17176,"That will require medical regulators to consciously accept more risk during times of crisis, and politicians to remind the people that we are all soldiers on the same side, and soldiers take risks to protect each other."

17188,Our district just tells you to self report to the Health Department as there is no effective tracing program due to the rise in cases.
17189,Got my 2nd Pfizer today.
17190,Mayo is my primary care provider and they are a goddamn machine with this whole process.
17191,In and out in under 10 minutes for both shots.
17192,But still some hard to reach.
17193,If live with family that doesn't care?
17194,But it is free and even administer cost is free.
17195,By this time someone living  deep in a forest with grandparents who cant leave is extreme example.
17196,But probably fixable and other issues also.

17199,Moderna is coming out with a booster vaccine.
17200,So is Pfizer.
17201,My two vaccines were from Moderna.
17202,"When the booster vaccine comes out, do I have to get my booster from the same manufacturer as the one that gave me my first two COVID injections?"
17203,"Is it just me, after my first shot I couldn't stop drinking and craving water?"
17204,So edgy.
17205,There product is being tainted as this pause continues in the United States.
17206,Other countries are now rejecting it like AstraZeneca has been shunned by some
17207,Why would anyone on the fence for this vaccine choose to get vaccinated when life doesn't change post vaccine?
17208,"We're getting to the point where everyone who wants one will be vaccinated, so you need to give people a reason to take the shot..."

I don’t know how things are done in other states or in the fairy tale that people who are downvoting me live, but Berlin and Brandenburg are an absolute mess."
17210,It’s actually extremely common for wealthy people around the world to travel to the US for healthcare.
17211,Most place I check only go 5 days out for appointments and they are always full.
17212,Checked tons of places since our state started March 30th being open for all.
17213,Haven’t been able to get spot.
17214,Up until this last year we've been used to just getting whatever we want within a week of wanting it.
17215,Supply limitations are not something we think about well.
17216,"So far nothing indicates that the Pfizer vaccine increases the risk of blood clots at all, and given how many have been administered across North America and Europe, one would have expected to see something by now."
17217,The symptoms of VITT with J&amp;J and AZ seem to develop 5-14 days after vaccination.
17218,Nah i dont read articles.
17219,I make my own opinions
17220,Evidence shows that being vaccinated also significantly reduces transmitting Covid.
17221,So I hope you’re taking precautions not to infect anyone who might have worse odds than yourself.

17223,Tomorrow for #1.
17224,5-6 weeks and maybe I can see family?
17225,I'm waiting for it to be fully approved by the FDA
17226,I can't wait for the day people actually read the latest research and stop saying you can spread so easily after vaccination.
17227,"Again, we akready at at 50%."
17228,70% intend to get vaccinated.
17229,"And ""the south"" is alarge area, and if there are Available appointments doesn't mean every place has weak demand."
17230,Do you really think that as soon as there are open appointments that it will immediately end?
17231,No new people being Bauhau vaccinated?
17232,I would be shocked if the adult valuation rate doesn't at leadt get to 65%.
17233,"And not to sound insensitive, but butso many in one region being unvaccinated might be good."
17234,"When the regions with higher rates get it under control, and your region it state sees a summer surge, purple might wake up and get caffeinated."
17235,There is no way that millions of more purple don't get caffeinated compared to now.
17236,That's fine.
17237,"They can take that risk, but we shouldn't keep restrictions up cause people refuse to get the vaccine."
17238,"Once is truly available to everyone that wants one, I see no reason to keep any restrictions."
17239,Those percentages don’t mean much because all ages haven’t had equal access to the vaccines.
17240,"It makes sense that 75+ is over 70% because they had access to the vaccine in Decemeber/January, the &lt;30 crowd *just now* is getting the opportunity."
17241,I’m sure if you told &lt;30 crowd in Juanary that they could get the vaccine first and return to normal sooner there would be lines miles long.
17242,"""Israel"" 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😅😅😅😅😅😅"
17243,Poggers
17244,"My work just mandated vaccinations by Aug 1st, with medical exceptions only."
17245,Their explanation - they are private and vaccinations aren't a 'protected' class.
17246,"Question: I live in the US and recently just recovered from covid (less than a month ago), should I get the vaccine, or is there some waiting period before I should get it?"
17247,"Previously I heard the number 90 days being thrown around, but never found any sources or reasons for that."
17248,Was it just to prioritize people without antibodies?
17249,Or was there a medical reason it either wouldn't work or be worse for your health?
17250,"&gt;You really think the main purpose of the vaccine is to protect other people, not yourself?"
17251,"Yes, that's EXACTLY the purpose of the vaccine when you're healthy and can likely fight the underlying virus."
17252,Are you really this fucking stupid?
17253,I feel like we've shattered all reasonable vaccination projections from january.
17254,I only got my shot because I saw a post on nextdoor about a drive thru clinic about 20 minutes away.
17255,I wasn’t about to drive 2 hours twice to get vaccinated for something that is a negligible threat to me.
17256,I'm waiting 'til after finals.
17257,I feel so stressed I don't want to risk a day with the sniffles or a minor fever.
17258,"(I'm in fl, so i've been able to for a few weeks now) Come this friday I'll get jabbed with the first available needle."
17259,that's weird cause I just had to listen to 14 months of you guys bragging about how well you handle covid
17260,I think it’s a lot less about politics than it is about the messaging of what we can and can’t do.
17261,Yeah I mean re: indoor gatherings it just shortens the time people can gather indoors and thus probably results in more crowding not less.
17262,"MA instituted one where liquor stores had to close an hour~ early, so all it did was make the stores more crowded at like 9"
17263,I have known medical allergies so I had to sit and be observed for thirty minutes.
17264,New Delhi has beaches?
17265,?
17266,It would be a train wreck like his presidency
17267,"Falsifying the CDC logo is the offense here, it's actually a fairly serious crime."
17268,Big bad pfizer is going to get you.
17269,"There is no escape, start running."
17270,"It's probably hopeless, but if you get the chance maybe frame it as a question:  why do you think that getting vaccinated is scarier than getting COVID-19?"
17271,- There are unknown long term consequences to having COVID-19.
17272,- *Many* more people have been hurt by the disease than the vaccine and over 200 million doses have been administered in the U.S.
17273,Maybe give people an actual finish line
17274,"If you get covid, even if you feel ok, you're still letting it spread and mutate."
17275,This year sucked for a lot of people in a lot of different ways.
17276,"I know I'm just an internet stranger, but please do your part to make the world less shitty."
17277,Please get vaccinated.
17278,The biggest thing for me is the fact that the vaccine companies have legal immunity regarding any effects the vaccine may have.
17279,"No recourse if something were to happen to you, even if it's rare."
17280,"I can’t imagine going into a crowded place for a long, long time."
17281,There's a natural ebb and flow to these things.
17282,Vaccines + Natural immunity from prior infection + people are naturally being more careful because they personally know a bunch of people that have it.

17293,You select that option before you even check your zip code for appts.

17298,"The article said deaths are not spiking in the younger cases, which leads me to believe that hospitalizations are up not because the virus is affecting younger people more severely, but rather there is room for them at the hospital, so they're not just being sent home with a bottle of Dimetapp."

17303,"Might as well, the more that are vaccinated the better off we all are."
17304,We haven’t done it yet?
17305,Many states also allow for new appointments at 12:00 am (at night).

17307,It still needs to be studied but I am hopeful that breakthrough cases will not cause Long Covid.

17326,Exactly.
17327,"I was eligible since 3/15 in my state, didn't realize it until 4/1 because my shitty doctors didn't realize it, and I couldn't get it until like 4/10 because it was packed, and that was from a FEMA place giving it to everyone."
17328,It's going to be very hard to find an appointment for people for a month.
17329,"That was when a substantially smaller population was eligible, and now they literally are trying to vaccinate like everyone in the fucking country."
17330,It's going to take a while.
17331,"He's looking at you, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, Faux,"
17332,Yes its a new strain but India wasn’t doing anything to protect itself either.

17342,I don’t want to be forced to use bing /s.
17343,Wow cant believe you uncle has not wanted to get it.
17344,And i say this as somebody who does not believe the vaccine is right for me.
17345,Yup.
17346,I'm 26 and had my first AZ shot begining of march.
17347,Absolutely no worries about the blood clot.
17348,"I had awful side effects (immune response) but I'd sooner have side effects for a day than lose my sense of smell or taste, let alone the thousands of lives saved."

17350,June 1 I’ll be ready to rebel if places aren’t dropping mandates to go about daily life.
17351,"Yes, I’m ready to be disappointed"
17352,I'm on the fence.
17353,"I've been down voted to oblivion for trying to make a reasonable explanation severall times before so here goes again:

I'm going to assume I had covid at some point in time, although I never tested positive."
17354,I stopped getting tested after so long and just said If I get it I get it.
17355,I was sick a couple of times throughout the year but nothing major.
17356,Def had some flu like symptoms.
17357,So.
17358,That said.
17359,Heres why based on what I know.
17360,Covid is hard to get a second time or can be less dangerous in most cases.
17361,This is obviously not true 100% of the time but it seems to be a reasonable popular opinion.
17362,"So if I already had it, and it ddn't affect me much, why would I get vaccinated?"
17363,"Also, the vaccine is already calling for a booster, and recently Phizer announced people will likely need a 2nd booster a year later."
17364,"So, is this a vaccine in the sense like Polio?"
17365,Or is it a yearly shot like the flu that might or might not help?
17366,Or is it something in between and we just don't know enough?
17367,"If we just don't know enough, I'd rather not be in the trial run of this vaccine."
17368,"Its not conspiracy, its just concern."
17369,I dont think 5g laser Bill Gates mind control chips are going to be downloaded into my blood stream.
17370,"I have also been personally fully vaccinated (until covid), as has my family."
17371,I fully believe that being concerned about the covid vaccine doesn't make me an anti vaxer.
17372,"And still, no one has answered my questions or concerns."
17373,"Also, if the vaccine becomes required to travel, or goto live events, etc."
17374,Then ill get it.
17375,"In the case of one friend of mine, his boss said, ""No one is permitted to return to the office unless they're vaccinated."""
17376,And he likes WFH.
17377,Having to constantly F5 and potentially drive 2 hours is not available lol.
17378,There should not be these many hoops and time requirements to get the shot.
17379,It isn’t going to be weeks.
17380,"I feel like that policy as it was, docking PTO, is way worse."
17381,"It gives you way more incentive to go into work sick, infect those around you, and cause efficiency to go way down."
17382,I don't understand why businesses think it's better to get one extra worker for a couple days just to lose 5 other coworkers for a couple days.
17383,It's such a short-sighted policy to get people to come into work sick.
17384,And good luck keeping those sick workers' productivity up.
17385,"You feel like shit, you'll work like shit."
17386,"And for those that seem to abuse it, you could probably have a policy of needing a doctor's note at some point."
17387,"Dude, 2 hours?"
17388,I was in and out in like 30min.
17389,They even had a free picture station set up and I took a really awkward picture.
17390,Herd immunity by June 1 let’s fucking GO
17391,That was very informative.
17392,Thank you for that.
17393,"Sorry, I didn't see your flair on mobile, I never would have tried to debate with you about that if I knew you were a specialist."
17394,You have changed my view.
17395,"Yup, I had a mild headache on day 2 and a sore arm."
17396,"Felt hot at times during the day, then had chills at night, but nothing I haven’t felt before with the flu shot."
17397,Day 3 woke up and felt great
17398,[deleted]
17399,Very cool.
17400,How are you doing that?
17401,Do people come to you or do you go out to find them?
17402,Sucks for them 🤷‍♂️
17403,I spent more time walking to and from my car than the actual appointment took.
17404,Was pretty nice.
17405,[removed]
17406,"I mean, the last 3 people you have been replying to aren't arguing there isn't an availability problem."
17407,They have been trying to help you get a vaccine.
17408,"I mean I’m lucky that I don’t get sick really ever so I haven’t had to factor that in, but I’ve never even had a job with any vacation time or sick days until the job I just started a little while ago, and so I just had to schedule my two days off back to back for four days in a row for any type of vacations or family gatherings I need to attend, or I just had to drive to Long Island and back in like one day or something."
17409,You were lucky.
17410,I was unlucky.
17411,I'm the only person I know out of the dozens that have felt that bad but I'm starting to feel better.
17412,So if it's 48 hours of feeling like crap and getting protected/helping protect my family and allows me to visit family and friends it's worth it.
17413,Don't forget that the anti vaxxers passing  it around to one another still contributes to herd immunity.
17414,Obviously not desired but we will reach herd immunity whether everyone gets vaccinated or not.
17415,Where their open appointments sooner?
17416,When I signed up for a mass vax site you could get appointments starting 2 days in the future.
17417,I can imagine people taking those before scheduling for a week out.
17418,No one is testing for asymptomatic spread - which is highly likely with children.

17421,Virginia pushed out an alert notification to everyone’s phone about vaccines opening up to 16+ and wow reactions are divided on that choice

17423,Also mild fever for a few hours and headache.
17424,"""I also took 2 tylenol when I got home from the shot, 2 more before bed, and 2 the next morning, just to try and head off any symptoms ahead of time."""
17425,"For those who have yet to get vaccinated, I understand it's not advisable to take painkillers before the shot."
17426,"Even after the shot, it's best to hold off taking painkillers for as long as possible."
17427,[removed]
17428,Correct.

17436,"That's a very bad study to compare frequency rates in the general population, they didn't do any control for demographic factors in the (relatively small) sample they looked at."
17437,"And comparing vaccines is even worse, since they only looked at mRNA vaccines and not AZ or J&amp;J."
17438,"The AZ numbers they list in the paper were lifted from the EMA report, which actually say that the rate of CVST with AZ is *substantially* higher than with either Pfizer or Moderna, both of which are in the range of the normal background rate."
17439,Most definitely.
17440,I never checked if I had a fever.
17441,"I probably did now that I think about it, but I do remember having to move my arm one night because it was near my head and the heat radiating from my arm was making my head uncomfortable."
17442,There's a deeper thought process that I didn't detail in the short comment.
17443,"Some days are just pretty much spoken for due to the value they provide: the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas eve, New Years eve."
17444,So now you're at 9 days.
17445,"1-2 days you'll lose to needing to not be at work for some unforseen issue (car problem,house problem,etc)."
17446,With youre remaining 7 days you might want a 3 day weekend here and there to avoid burnout.
17447,Now you're at 5.
17448,So with your 1 week of vacation what do you do?
17449,Do something fun with your spouse or go see your family?
17450,The answer is you go to work sick and do both.
17451,This is such bullshit.
17452,It only hacks your phone but you get much better reception so it's totally worth it.
17453,My father-in-law is 70 and is refusing to get it.
17454,"He has been a respiratory therapist for 30+ years, watched people die every day, but someone at church told him it was dangerous."
17455,"I mean you got to do what you got to do, but that’s not how people are getting sick."
17456,You have a better shot of a plane crashing into your house.
17457,Tell that to the millions who died of covid.
17458,"Yea, it'll be what it'll be!"
17459,If I have to watch Scream 1&amp;2 again while napping and feeling pretty down then that is a sacrifice I am willing to make!
17460,lol
17461,"My wife is immunosuppressed and we don’t even know if the vaccine will be all that effective for her, so yes we are still being cautious and will feel far more comfortable when case rates get a lot lower in our area."
17462,Makes my skin crawl thinking about some goon getting incensed that we are “virtue signaling” by doing this.
17463,By lit do you mean impossible to travel or enjoy anything because of the hordes of tourists everywhere?
17464,100 percent the Media is to blame.
17465,They had no shame with wall to wall coverage talking about every little thing of covjd and now even though many are fully vaccinated they stlll have fears.
17466,"Unless you're into arithmetic, that sounds like remarkable growth, but actually growing by 60%, from 60% of your previous level, is still 4% shrinkage from the previous levels."
17467,We require blanket masks now??
17468,When will the madness end?!?
17469,!
17470,"Got a Cinco de Mayo party planned in a few weeks, about a half dozen of us vaccinated and ready to party."
17471,Summer is looking great!
17472,I wonder if the reaction to the 2nd shot has any relation to how covid would have impacted you.
17473,"I've heard 2nd shot symptoms range from multiple days of the flu, to nothing at all ... with seemingly most getting a &lt;24hr flu."
17474,You can still get covid and transmit it even if you get the vaccine?
17475,Getting very discouraged.
17476,"I got my 2nd shot today, and that’s great, but I still get emails about the opportunity to schedule an appointment."
17477,So I decided to click the link.
17478,"For 4/25, I counted only 29 appointments taken and this is a mass vax site."
17479,"And I’m in Maryland, not Texas."
17480,Really worried that vaccine skepticism has sky rocketed due to the J&amp;J pause.
17481,"Are we ever going to reach herd immunity, or are we stuck with this forever?"
17482,"Demand is falling off in some areas, but holding strong in others."
17483,Vaccines are starting to pile up in some places where there are still shortages in others.
17484,It's time for the CDC to start shipping vaccines preferentially to states where they're actually being used.
17485,And for states to start shipping vaccines preferentially to providers who are using them.
17486,No reason to keep shipping the same number of vaccines to a place where their reserves are starting to pile up.
17487,Well my arms are pretty decently sized anyway.
17488,"Definitely not grapefruit level, but about the size of an apple."
17489,"It's not like those stories of people's hands or knees swelling to gigantic size, since those are so much smaller areas."
17490,"My arm only swelled 1-2 inches, but it's already a pretty big area, so it just looks that much larger, but even then, when you are looking at it by itself, there is an optical illusion where it just looked like my shoulder went further down than it was supposed to."
17491,"Some, yup."

17505,Yeah I just keep reading online how people are having 103+ fevers and aches with the shot and me already having Covid just got a mild fever for 1 day and felt fine the rest of the time.
17506,Just makes me a little wary tbh
17507,Among kids?
17508,"Yeah well I'm young and healthy, and according to the data young and healthy people on average have the worst reactions to the vaccine and the most mild COVID so..."
17509,It seems like you are extrapolating to fit a narrative you already agreed with.
17510,But I guess we all do that to some extent.
17511,They’re fucking denying me an available one at the local Walgreens.

17573,Yeah and don't forget people love to talk and eat popcorn while watching) annoying other movie patrons
17574,"Yes, I definitely experienced this."
17575,But for me it was specifically oranges and anything orange-flavored.
17576,Orange juice suddenly tasted like Windex and anything artificially flavored tasted extremely weird.
17577,I can’t stand junk food anymore because of this so I guess that’s nice.
17578,"Outside is fairly safe, I think."
17579,The crazy behavior in the US has proven that theory anecdotally even if not scientifically.
17580,"Between protests, riots, insurrections and FL spring breakers we've had a good look at the results and if you stick to outdoors in good weather you'll probably be alright."
17581,What's the mask situation there now?
17582,"Good on you for trying to spread awareness, vaccines being lost because they have no one to use them on is a true tragedy."
17583,[removed]
17584,"Yes, they are."
17585,"&gt;Passengers who have transited or have been in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China (People's Rep.), Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or in the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), in the past 14 days are not allowed to enter and transit."
17586,"It does not apply to US citizens and permanent residents tough, who are most likely the ""tourists"" in this case."
17587,"Even though the vaccine is available,all the appointments are ""sold out"".i have been looking forever and its always like that :/"
17588,[removed]
17589,[removed]
17590,When do you expect New Yorkers to drop the mask mandates on public?
17591,As far as I'm aware it's the same with Moderna yes.
17592,"But if you are genuinely worried, you should look up the official information on side-effects or contact your doctor."
17593,I’m currently about 24 hours post second moderna dose.
17594,I’d compare it to a mild-moderate hangover so far.
17595,Maybe just slightly worse than the first shot.
17596,Also had Covid.
17597,"I would definitely choose this over Covid again, any day."
17598,Yeah this is why I kept asking what you defined as a strict lockdown and what period you were classifying as very strict and very long.
17599,Rather than answer the point you went it about comparisons to other countries rather than actually answering the point.
17600,"Knowing you don’t even read my replies though, I’m out."
17601,You are incredibly hypochondriacal.
17602,You’re going so far down the line that you’re actually horse shoe-ing the other way and inadvertently becoming an anti vaxxer by doubting the efficacy of vaccines MUCH more than you did before the pandemic.
17603,There is literally nothing wrong with a vaccinated person going to a social gathering without wearing a mask.
17604,Vaccines work.
17605,"The great thing is that while you should keep masking and such, your odds of catching covid if exposed start declining 10 days after the first dose and by your second dose, the second dose only boosts it a bit."
17606,"So, the CDC wants us to wait to consider ourselves fully vaxxed until 2 weeks after the second, but you can start breathing easier 2-3 weeks after the first."
17607,"I, personally, liked counting down the immunity milestones while waiting for my second dose."
17608,[removed]
17609,"&gt; People are truly fascinating**ly hypocritical, idiotic** creatures."
17610,FTFY
17611,[removed]
17612,Eh I get it.
17613,I think it's honest.
17614,A lot of people like things to be easy.
17615,That's why some states automatically register people to vote or make people opt out of organ donations.
17616,It's just so much easier to get people to do something if you make it easy.
17617,I want to hire their lawyer and sue companies which have mandatory meetings.
17618,"LoL
What a bunch of idiots"
17619,I imagine it would have the date on it.
17620,"Based on that rule, he'd likely have to show it to his boss at *some* point when staying WFH is no longer an option for him or anybody at that office."
17621,"If at that time, the boss sees the early vaccination date, I imagine they might be upset."
17622,[removed]
17623,Why is the CDC taking so long to update their vaccine tracker?
17624,"All last week they consistently had it updated by 1:30 PM EST, and the week before they didn’t update it until the evening every single day."
17625,Why the inconsistency?
17626,Ah oops I missed that lol
17627,"So what is ""very low""?"
17628,How many cases?
17629,"That's what the person you're responding to is looking for - not a generic ""when risk is low"" ""when cases are low"" ""when it's safe"" etc."
17630,Thanks for the correction!
17631,"I wasn't seeing that data myself, only info on the 2 studies I mentioned (hence me running here for advice because 2 studies with limited participants is really alarming)."
17632,I'll definitely look into it more and forward whatever I find on it to her.
17633,If you have any links that you can share I would really appreciate it.
17634,"And I agree, but she's otherwise healthy so I'll let her decide how she feels about the side effects."
17635,"I'm still somewhat partial to sinopharm, but I work from home so the 2 wks wait after the second dose for effectiveness doesn't affect me at all, which isn't the same case for her."
17636,"And you really don't need to thank me, it's a completely selfish choice on our end to protect ourselves which just happens to have an unselfish side effect of protecting others."
17637,Tbh more people should probably think of it that way if it means they'll get vaccinated
17638,Can't tell if sarcastic or not
17639,What?
17640,No
17641,Oh I bet which ex-politician you’d follow into hell and back if they told you to get it.
17642,[removed]
17643,You can.
17644,Just stay in the garden
17645,I’m American.
17646,Not sure you if that’s what you were saying or not.
17647,This is splitting hairs.
17648,"The general public doesn’t give a fuck about this, and that especially means conservative politicians."
17649,"Again, what is the material win in fighting the board of regents on this from my university’s point of view?"
17650,"It’s a shitty situation, but when actually deconstructing what’s going on, this is the perspective we have to take when talking about how universities are approaching the fall semester."
17651,"I hope I’m wrong, and that the morally right thing to do will prevail over the political context."
17652,"But that hasn’t been the case this entire pandemic, I don’t expect that to change now."
17653,You forgot about Dre
17654,Good.
17655,Maybe it's time you guys finally remove your export ban?
17656,?
17657,This doesn't make sense to me.
17658,He's categorizing people based on how they voted and them pointing the finger more at one side.
17659,That's incredibly divineness.
17660,It means people who voted for the current admin will have more of a reason to resent people who voted for the ex-admin.
17661,[removed]
17662,If only I could find a vaccine 😩
17663,"A bunch of places don't check for ID, especially in smaller cities."
17664,They just want to vaccinate as much as possible.
17665,The big mass vaccination centers just want to match your name to an id so a passport will work fine.
17666,They don't scan or check if you have a visa or anything
17667,US and EU citizens don't need a visa to travel to Brazil.
17668,I'm sure there'll be at least 1
17669,Lucky you!
17670,I'm not the least bit swayed by needles or anything.
17671,"But dam, this one was a real pinch!"
17672,Worse than the novacane in my face for a cavity.
17673,At least in terms of pain.
17674,"Up until this one, the worst shot I got was just above my canine tooth, like under my nose."
17675,That was a wierd one lol.
17676,But it barley hurt.
17677,Just really uncomfortable.
17678,Covid shot felt like i was being stabbed.
17679,Plenty of people contribute to the divineness of this country and Fauci is one of them with this particular quote.
17680,"Fauci is a doctor, there is no need to single people out based on political affiliation."
17681,"Ah yes, of course semantics, pointing out he literally said he’s uninformed... 

Also again no I’m not but maybe that’s the difference."
17682,"I’ve been taking advantage of the easing restrictions so haven’t felt it’s as strict for the last 6 weeks, but you’ve apparently been unable to leave the house for a year."
17683,[removed]
17684,*Religious exemptions* to a vaccine?!
17685,Get the fuck outta here with that.
17686,That is the final straw for my last shred of respect for organised religion
17687,"When I was growing up, a relative of mine named Jan Jansen who immigrated to Minnesota from Sweden or Norway was mentioned often, and was forced to go by John Johnson."
17688,As I grew older I was almost certain this was some family inside joke of some kind just based on the tone his name was mentioned.
17689,"Had a recent debate with my mom that Jansen must have been Norwegian because Johnson in Swedish is Johansson, which an on-the-spot Google confirmed was mostly incorrect."
17690,&gt; Why would anyone on the fence for this vaccine choose to get vaccinated when life doesn't change post vaccine?
17691,Because they’re a decent human being who doesn’t want to get sick or get the people around them sick?
17692,You almost seem... viscerally upset that the pandemic is beginning to end.
17693,I cannot help but ask you why?
17694,Why are lucky enough to have a vaccine that is essentially 100% effective in preventing severe cases of covid.
17695,"In moderna’s trials, there were 30000 people who received the vaccine."
17696,Not a *single person* developed a severe case of covid let alone died from it.
17697,"It is incredibly, incredibly powerful."
17698,And the same results are reflected today.
17699,"Out of 78.5 million people vaccinated, 5800 were infected, and only 74 of those people died."
17700,"Out of *78.5 million* 

I’m not going to pretend like the vaccine isnt effective."
17701,"And if you want to continue wearing your masks, for some personal reason (ie if it brings you comfort or whatever), by all means do it."
17702,But at some point you’re just going to have to accept that masks aren’t going to become a thing.
17703,People have already stopped wearing them.
17704,And thats fine.
17705,There’s nothing wrong with not wearing a mask when seeing other vaccinated people.
17706,Vaccines work.
17707,"Yea, I guess different countries have different standards."
17708,My apologies for pulling an American and assuming my country's standard on this translates to other countries.
17709,Obviously it doesn't and each health organization has their own opinion on this.
17710,Not really.
17711,"Get back on the plane, then spend 3 days in hotel at cost of 2000$, then 14 day at home mandatory quarantine."
17712,Outside?
17713,I sure hope not.
17714,If people in NY are still doing that after all this time they should stop as soon as they are vaccinated.
17715,What about Moderna (the one I got)?
17716,The same?
17717,No risk for clots?

17729,I hope he resigns but I doubt he will.
17730,His entire handling of this pandemic has been an insult to the people of Ontario.
17731,"&gt;	Perhaps, but it’s approved for anyone 16 and up, which is the entire collegiate demographic."
17732,"No, it isn’t *approved*."
17733,"There is an Emergency Use Authorization, which is different and allows it to be used without formal approval."
17734,"When they said “fully approved,” they weren’t talking about age groups but formal FDA approval"
17735,I didn’t ask.
17736,A cursory google search about how long antibodies stay in system seems to answers this.
17737,I really doubt that hospitals and pharmacies are doing more vaccinations than the mass vax sites.
17738,"The mass vax sites are vaccinating a LOT of people, quickly."
17739,I just hope that isn't starting to dwindle.
17740,Nope.
17741,It happened twice when I was in like middle school.
17742,Just passed out at the dermatologist two appointments in a row.
17743,"Then nothing for a few years and all of a sudden, I passed out when visiting my girlfriend post-op."
17744,"There was no blood, or anything that would make someone pass out."
17745,It just happened.
17746,"And in between those incidents I’ve been to doctors, gotten shots, needles, had surgery a few times."
17747,But after passing out the last time I get queezy when thinking about a doctors office or anything that has to do with medical places.
17748,"So yeah, no reason for it and don’t know what to do about it except show up for my shot and hope for the best."
17749,And hopefully if I don’t pass out it’ll get this out of my head and I’ll be “cured”

17755,I never said I have 'no idea'.
17756,"My entire extended family live in Bolton (with one cousin in London), so I know a little bit."
17757,"Specifically:

* Outdoor gatherings were allowed but limited to six people."
17758,"* Mixing households was not allowed (unless it was with the one person in your 'bubble')
* Pubs only opened up a week ago and they are restricted to outdoor gatherings only

I know my Aunt wasn't able to go across the street any hang out with her neighbor since about Nov/Dec."
17759,She went for the first time last week and even then they still only hung out in their backyard (despite that fact that all four of them have been fully vaccinated).
17760,"There's a lot I don't know about lockdown, which is why I said I don't know the specifics."
17761,My understanding is that all the things I listed above were true from about Nov/Dec until a week ago.
17762,"I could be wrong, but my point still stands that the UK had one of the longest/strictest lockdowns in the world."
17763,You're free to name all the tons of countries that had longer/stricter lockdowns to try and prove me wrong.
17764,My guess is that you'd only be able to name a handful of other countries within Europe that were also just as long/strict.
17765,Imagine flaunting being an asshole.

17767,One man instigated a policy of divisiveness that politicized the virus.
17768,"Fortunately we no longer have to deal with his daily antics, although he came close to literally overseeing the destruction of our democratic republic."
17769,The buck stops with him.
17770,He needs a big helping of personal responsibility.
17771,It's not divisive because the people he's reffering to disagree with him to begin with.
17772,"When states stop asking for it all,  would be my assumption."
17773,I can't defend the embargo; we aren't going to use those AZ doses we have and blocking any raw ingredient exports is just stupid.
17774,But the sooner its dropped the better.
17775,"People keep saying this, but I haven't seen anyone take this lockdown seriously."
17776,"As a key worker, in the first lockdown I drove down empty highways to work at 8am."
17777,"This lockdown just gone though, traffic was at 80-90% of pre-pandemic levels throughout."
17778,"Aside from pubs, shops and restaurants being closed, the British public has ignored it entirely."
17779,"They're in storage at this same plant, their fate is still uncertain."
17780,CVST occurs in the general population at a rate of around 5 per million.
17781,It’s the low platelet combo that is the issue.
17782,And that combo was not seen with MRNA vaccines.
17783,It was a very big relief when my parents got their vaccines as well.
17784,I knew how efficient they were and what this would mean for them.
17785,"They are slowly opening up their activities, but I think ""cautious"" is a better word to describe them than ""fearful""."
17786,"They are well-informed as to how safe and effective the vaccines are, but there also isn't a lot of data on how the current slew of variants react to the vaccines."
17787,"Given how rapidly these variants surfaced after the original covid-19 virus appeared, we should also be wary of things that are not in the data pool yet, such as new or double-variants of the viruses."
17788,And the long-term efficacy of the vaccines is also something we don't have a lot of data on yet.
17789,"Even Pfizer's CEO is messaging now that adults may need a 3rd shot before the end of the year, and seasonal boosters may be likely."
17790,"There are good, rational reasons why the CDC still recommends vaccinated people to wear masks and remain socially distant when in public, because the epidemiological landscape for COVID is not completely set in stone."
17791,"It is rapidly changing and evolving, and it would be unwise to think ""Oh we have a vaccine, this thing is gonna be beat, I'm going to be fine for the rest of my life""

My MIL is quite a bit less informed, and much more fearful."
17792,The vast majority of her 'news' comes from the stuff that facebook posts.
17793,"She's on the left-end of the political spectrum, so imagine the polar-opposite of an anti-masker: highly afraid, greatly overexaggerating risks of catching covid, taking (IMO) unnecessary precautions in the name of safety."
17794,"I suppose it could be worse, though."
17795,The only reason this is somewhat difficult for me is that my MIL is retired and lives in our household.
17796,"I won't go into my life story, but to put it mildly - she is not easy to live with lol."
17797,Will everyone in NY in the U.S. be wearing masks the entire year of 2021?
17798,Dude you are speaking to the choir.
17799,I am a conservative and I’m dealing with this bullshit with my friends that are of the same political leaning.
17800,"Yea they are stupid about it, but the actual public communication on this subject had been down right atrocious."
17801,And I never specified Fauci.
17802,I'd take this perspective seriously if politicians more competent than Trump hadn't screwed this up way worse than he did.
17803,"If Angela Merkel fucked this up, then Trump deserves some credit for not fucking up."
17804,Yes!
17805,I'm proud to be part of the group that's putting an end to all of this!
17806,"""It's just a piece of mRNA, which is inherently unstable and breaks down by itself once its in your body."""
17807,"You are correct about mRNA being unstable but that is when it is in a buffer by itself, not stabilized with another additive, in this case PEG."
17808,I'm not sure they have conducted any extensive studies (maybe they are now?)
17809,to determine mRNA half life once injected.
17810,"Also, besides the muscle cells (myocytes), where else might the vaccine be traveling in the body?"
17811,It just seems like a big unknown right now.
17812,"I totally agree that the modified vaccines will function the exact same way, it's just not knowing how repeated boosters of this vaccine type may react in the body long term."
17813,"It will probably be fine, but does anyone know for sure?"
17814,Very true.
17815,"Despite the higher risk, then as today [some people objected to vaccination and had to be forced."

17818,"People tried to get rid of trump twice, but it is impossible to get rid of a sitting president before their term is over l, even if they suck."
17819,We just got lucky that his term expired lol.
17820,Not sure if they do it by county or or not.
17821,"But yeah, hopefully in a few weeks things will be better."
17822,You repost the same clickbait article from 2 hrs ago?
17823,[removed]
17824,"That's talking about the development, not the testing/approval process."
17825,"This kind of vaccine (mrna) has been in development for many years, so I think the time line kind of works out."

17839,"In the last few weeks, Michigan has accounted for around 10% of all U.S. cases."
17840,"Their 7-day case peak was 7,863 on April 13, and the U.S. was at 71,222 on the same day."
17841,"If you subtract Michigan, we would have been mostly steady."

17843,"No doubt in the cities it'll be 95+% uptake, but &lt;50% in rural areas."

17864,And this is a good thing.
17865,"He's making predictions that the numbers say are easily achievable, then everyone is going and knocking it out of the ballpark."
17866,"Think 100m in 100 days, then doubling that goal."
17867,"Originally the goal was ""every American that wants it can get it by May 1st."""
17868,That changed to April 19th.
17869,His goal is small gatherings for 4th of July.
17870,"But yes, it's gonna be possible that enough people are ""fully vaccinated"" in time for Memorial Day as well."
17871,But there is a certain symbolism with July 4th being a goal date of course.

17876,Uh... okay?
17877,Not really bad at all for someone who’s vaccinated to not wear a mask.
17878,"I mean, were you wearing a mask to stop the spread of the flu with the flu vaccine?"
17879,Of course not.
17880,Hopefully we will see some big drops over the next 2-4 weeks.
17881,What you done in Australia and NZ is impressive but aren’t you essentially locked off from the rest of the world until you get vaccinated?
17882,Like those governors are listening to any CDC recommendations anyways.
17883,"I live in Florida, we have never had a statewide mask mandate."
17884,Only some local jurisdictions have implemented any.
17885,thank you.
17886,I meant to ask what is the effectiveness after a month or longer?
17887,I would say very low.
17888,California and New York have huge populations and high vaccine demand.
17889,"It's possible you could walk up in some rural areas, but definitely not Los Angeles or New York City."
17890,They also don't need to advertise very hard to bring in tourists; they're probably two of the most visited states by foreigners regardless.
17891,Alaska is in a tough position because it has low population and relies heavily on tourism (which primarily came from cruises in the summer!)
17892,"Other states could potentially do it, especially in the South."
17893,Georgia makes big advertising pushes and has low uptake.
17894,190 cases of low blood platelets and clotting?
17895,It’s a very specific issues for JnJ and AZ.
17896,"Regular blood clots occur in the population at about a rate of 1 per 1,000."
17897,So pretty common.
17898,Thanks!

17914,"&gt;  Millions become seriously ill, and many will be sick for a long time."
17915,Do you actually have a reliable source for millions being seriously ill?
17916,The long covid boogeyman is not anywhere near as bad as its made out to be.
17917,"Simple - you say ""when 70% are vaccinated, all restrictions will be gone."""
17918,Or pick whatever number you want.
17919,"If fewer people get vaccinated, it'll take longer to get there, but that doesn't make it any harder to say the number."
17920,I’m in Texas and the other day I got an emergency alert that a cop was shot 200 miles away from me.
17921,He wasn’t even killed.
17922,What the fuck am I supposed to do about it?
17923,"It was the most useless alert I’ve ever gotten on my phone and I just went and turned most of them off, and it seemed like a huge abuse of that system."
17924,Vaccine notifications seem like a great use for it though.
17925,I stopped trying to pre-register/go through the state websites.
17926,"I went into Walmart’s website and scheduled an appointment literally within minutes, and had my vaccine within 36 hours."
17927,I’m even out-of-state because of work and they didn’t ask any questions (Virginia).
17928,Go straight thru the providers and see if that works.
17929,[removed]
17930,Wasn't Trump on track to roll out the same amount of vaccines?
17931,I know his general attitude towards the disease was lackluster which probably cost thousands of lives but in terms of vaccines even he was doing well?
17932,But yeah if Biden was president earlier you could've prevented countless deaths.
17933,"Sure, let's revisit - I'll set a calendar reminder."
17934,I'm pretty confident in what's about to happen.
17935,We've been basically on exactly the expected trajectory for vaccination since we started - we're a little over a month behind Israel.
17936,"Around this time last month, the state of things in Israel was that 60% of adults had received at least one shot."
17937,"Hospitalizations had cratered for the elderly, but there was a small spike among young people."
17938,Sound familiar?
17939,"Today, Israel is almost fully reopened and has removed its outdoor mask mandate, and they are on a trajectory to further relax restrictions in the coming weeks."
17940,The US should be there too in a month - the vaccines really do work.
17941,"If we are behind the curve, it will be because we encounter too much vaccine hesitancy or because an unexpectedly bad variant starts to spread despite vaccines (possibly the Brazilian P.1 variant, by way of British Columbia)."
17942,But I'm quite optimistic about both.
17943,Looking forward to getting that life savings!
17944,;)
17945,Still better than getting COVID.
17946,The link still works for me.
17947,But here is a screenshot anyways https://i.imgur.com/4dsjb1h.jpg
17948,"Not sure what you mean by ""they"" but there are posts that still come up in this sub regarding possible treatments for covid-- there's a lot of chatter about vaccines because it's just timely-- everyone is thinking about it because they're getting it or trying to get it."
17949,"IIRC on treatment, part of the issue is that it's easier to prevent infection than to treat it."
17950,"My understanding is that treatment also works best if administered very early before an infection gets severe, too."
17951,Which can be a challenge for people without access to good healthcare.
17952,What makes you think that’s abuse of a sick day?
17953,The day is allotted for in their contract.
17954,Who cares what they actually use it for??
17955,?
17956,Do I have to be a citizen of the state I live in to be eligible?
17957,"The poster I originally responded to says they're an ICU nurse, so they should absolutely be aware."
17958,"Being on divert a couple of nights in a row isn't abnormal during flu season or with big traumas (bad snowstorms, even)."
17959,"But yeah, that's why I asked them what they think the norm is - if they think it's 40%, then they just aren't informed."
17960,"If they think it's the ~70% that it actually is, with big spikes up during the winter being pretty normal, then they're intentionally trying to make this sound scarier than it is."
17961,"I don't expect them to actually answer, though."
17962,"It's definitely not as clear as it should be but Fauci has said that metric for getting back to normal is under 10,000 daily covid cases."
17963,Florida?
17964,Not true.
17965,"Only 6% of those actually died from Covid, probably far less."
17966,Yeah you'll always have those people.
17967,The people that need the finish line are the people on the fence or the people waiting.
17968,It really changes your perspective on things.
17969,"Prior to getting vaccinated, I was entirely for wearing masks and social distancing but once I got my shots it completely changed my mindset (for myself)."
17970,Now I tend to try and get a vibe on a place before deciding if I need a mask or not.
17971,I respect private establishments and their rules and won't make a big deal if I'm asked to put a mask on and always carry one anyway but the days of panic wearing a mask are over for me.
17972,&gt; You aren't positive while asymptomatic and then die suddenly 45 days later from it.
17973,I don't even understand what you're trying to say.
17974,People are truly fascinating creatures
17975,We (NZ) have the benefit of a (relatively) air tight border and the luxury of a measured rollout.
17976,My dad is a pediatrician and used to be pretty conservative.
17977,"But, gun crimes in our area increased and he started seeing really horrible things when being called into the ER."
17978,"Other things obviously contributed too, but he’s pretty liberal now and the gun thing is a huge reason why."
17979,Thank you!
17980,This is why I don’t get those who say “oh no we will be back in full lockdown next month”
17981,What do you do for work?
17982,"Because healthy 32 y/o's are generally not eligible for the vaccine in Europe yet, unless they work in healthcare/schools/etc."
17983,"And even then here in Italy you could only get AstraZeneca initially (now it's the exact opposite, lol)."
17984,"I had my first dose in March because of my work category, second dose not until late May."
17985,But generally the vaccinations are only open to ages 60+ right now...
17986,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
17987,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
17988,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

17995,"&gt;Also the fact they aren't even thinking about treatments for covid, ONLY vaccines."
17996,This sort of falls apart when you realize that there is more money in treating an illness vs curing it.
17997,This.
17998,If we had scaled up weekly testing in every school and workplace early on enough so that we could have done an actual test/trace/isolate program we probably could have avoided 3/4s of the total deaths we ended up with.

18029,compared to the most ass backwards country on earth they're not doing well.
18030,"When we say seasonal effects, it typically means something like the virus spreads much slower or not at all in warmer temperaturs (and/or as a function of humidity)."
18031,This is not established at all yet for covid.
18032,"It may also be the case that the virus was well under control last June and has slowly started to spread again, on a level low enough to not really raise concern."
18033,You'll see that the [estimated reproduction rate](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Reproduction+rate&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~FRA) was above 1 (i.e.
18034,"spreading) in many if not all countries for lots of the summer months, even though the number of confirmed cases was very low (about 10 per million, except the US)."
18035,"Of course that's only two data points, but [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7896490/#:%7E:text=Therefore%2C%20the%20seasonal%20variation%20might,and%20temperature%20in%20spring%20and) point out that no seasonal effect has been identified yet."
18036,"This is, ofc, reason to worry at least a little bit, because it may mean summer will still be a problem."
18037,What about DC?
18038,"They’re not misrepresenting reality, they are just selling it in a way to make people concerned."
18039,"The reality is that out of 100 million or so people that are fully vaccinated, 74 have died of covid."
18040,"Out of the 30+ million confirmed cases of covid, there have been well over 500,000 deaths."
18041,"If you extrapolate the number of infected to equal the number of vaccinated that would be about 1.5 million deaths vs. 74, and those 74 that died likely had health complications that prevented the vaccine from being effective."
18042,"No vaccine is perfect, but this one is pretty damn close."
18043,[removed]
18044,Remember that everyone who enters the hospital is tested for covid.
18045,"If you have higher infection rates among the young right now (and I’d say that’s probably true) then you will always see an increase of “hospitalized” cases to some degree, bc more are testing positive."
18046,But I’m not sure these stats really reflect “in the hospital for covid” or “with covid”

18059,I'm going for my second dose of sinopharm tomorrow and my little sister wants to tag along to get her vaccine as well.
18060,I live in South America and the sinopharm was the only option available to persons my age at the time that I got my vaccine.
18061,"I know it's still in the testing phase, but I felt comfortable with getting it after my own research (the only concern I have about it after researching is whether or not 2 doses are effective or if I'll need a 3rd in the future)."
18062,Now that the sputnik v is here in my country those are the only two options currently available for persons her age.
18063,"She's been asking me which I think she should take, but I'm not sure what to tell her because when I did some research on the sputnik v it seemed like there's a lot of trust issues surrounding it that I'm not sure how to feel about (given that it's political in nature and I'm not from that part of the world and don't know much about the politics playing into the situation)."
18064,"Politics aside, I'd love to hear your opinions/advice on which one I should advise her to take."

18066,she doesn't have any preexisting medical conditions.
18067,Stephen Colbert invited one of his female writer's on air last week to discuss this.

18155,"As someone in a rural state that opened up access to everyone a month ago and still has an issue with lack of demand/oversupply, its a real problem"
18156,Honestly 7 days is plenty for the average person.
18157,Supposedly that might happen this month.
18158,NYC is a lot more sunny than London.
18159,That’s the worst thing about British weather.
18160,I’d happily take colder sunny winters than slightly warmer grey dull ones we get.

18168,"With the new Phizer order, we'll have enough for first *and* second doses for about 80% of the adult population by the end of July."
18169,It absolutely is!
18170,We went out to a restaurant for the first time in a year to celebrate.
18171,PSA: keep wearing a mask and following CDC guidelines (or your country’s equivalent).
18172,"Even if we are protected, we need to be cautious as potential carriers."
18173,I'm pretty sure they don't know what the word sick and or day mean.
18174,Maybe both but that might be stretching it a bit too far
18175,That's not true.
18176,Symptoms post vaccine are real and some people need a day to rest and recover.
18177,I'm a full time college student that works full time and I'm waiting for the second week of May when my finals are over so I can get the shot on my days off work and be able to take a day if need be.
18178,"I don't know if you can singularly trace it to a single source but the Chapo Trap House podcast has been using it super regularly for like 4+ years now, and subsequently their subreddit and viewers in general also emulate that manner of speech."
18179,Fools and their money are soon parted.
18180,Not everyone is flexible enough to take whatever appointment comes available or tech savvy enough to constantly check vaccine spotter and what not.
18181,Calmness and normalcy are very bad for the media's bottom line.
18182,Now that Trump is gone they need a new audience and scared people click.

18185,I just got an email for my second moderna and they specifically say in it you won’t be turned away with no id.
18186,Hope that helps!
18187,I looked it up and they administered twice as many per capita.
18188,Honestly surprising the EU is lacking as much as they are.
18189,Isn't it the first widespread MRNA vaccine?
18190,It doesn't have FDA approval either.

18198,so you don't get sick?

18200,"It's not discriminatory, it's the truth."
18201,"People refusing vaccination is largely a problem of the anti-intellectual, religious, usually Republicans in the USA."
18202,"They deserve to be called out, it is a huge problem that will prolong the pandemic and cause a lot of needless deaths."
18203,meanwhile my state opened it up for everyone about a month ago and still has an issue with lack of demand.
18204,Are there updated estimates for when kids will be able to get it?
18205,Because you breath from your mouth.
18206,They tested positive while asymptomatic and then died 45 days +/- after the positive test.

18212,Like?
18213,"I've vaccinated (1 dose), and I wear my mask because I would prefer not to ""accidentally"" kill others."
18214,"I also work in an Urgent Care clinic, and am aware that one dose of Moderna does not completely cover me against P1 or B135."
18215,I am an at risk individual.
18216,So.

18220,Wow I'm really jumping into the lions den here but I'll answer.
18221,"First of all I'm not in the ""bill gates of want to put a chip in all of us camp"" and fully plan on getting it but I've been procrastinating."
18222,"I work from home and rarely go out, if I do it's to see my parents who are both fully vaccinated."
18223,I'm young and not overweight.
18224,I was able to get it in my state about a month ago.
18225,But I have a bitching case of medical anxiety.
18226,"When I was in my teens I had a very bad allergic reaction to something, basically my whole face swelled up to the point of not really being able to open my eyes and I got these disgusting, burning hives all over my body."
18227,My mom took me to the urgent care where they gave me a steroid shot in the ass.
18228,"About ten minutes later I stopped being able to breathe right, then proceeded to start hyperventilating because I was panicking I couldn't breathe, then passed out."
18229,This was all while the nurse who was observing me post shot was telling me that I most definitely could breathe and was being dramatic.
18230,There was more to it then that which ended with the nurse losing her license but the upshot is that needles terrify me.
18231,On the day my puppy was getting her first round of puppy shots I passed out in the vets office.
18232,"I am well aware that a steroid shot is not the same as any kind of vaccine but that's not how anxiety works 


So I've been going to therapy for that among many other things and a few months ago we started working on a plan for me to get it in a way I feel safe, I have a nurse best friend who is going to drive me, etc..."
18233,"I signed up with my therapist a few weeks ago which was terrifying in and of itself for me, then the AZ story came out and I panicked and cancelled."
18234,When I go see my therapist this week we will sign up again.
18235,I work in Marketing.

Yup."
18241,Both need to change.
18242,I graduated hs in 2009.
18243,I don’t really getting a meningitis shot.
18244,I remember hearing about it but I don’t think it was a requirement at the time where I went.
18245,When I read what it can do to you I thought “fuck I’m glad I never caught that.” Lol I need find out if I did get the vaccine or not.
18246,Don't drink any alcohol for a while or you're gonna have a bad time.
18247,I was just looking at Ontario vaccination information and for most adults it says July.
18248,Maybe they're just being conservative
18249,"Exporting vaccines is not what we’re talking about, so I’m not sure what your point is."
18250,It does seem like the seniors are extremely vaccinated at this point so I hope that shows in the death rate in the upcoming weeks.
18251,Should hopefully drop down super low.
18252,I peeked at a BBC article which showed the restrictions release plan.
18253,Looks like your March 29 release was the biggest release with people being able to travel outside of your local area.
18254,"The B117 spread looked intense, with a 3 month lockdown starting right after Christmas."
18255,That's tough.
18256,Here in the US we mostly just rode it out.
18257,Probably because the US politicians know their citizens have guns.

18268,The airlines had stopped 90% of travel from China before Trump did anything.
18269,Still not sure why he got away with taking credit for it.
18270,Not that it mattered.
18271,By that point we had coronavirus arriving from European travellers.
18272,"Why stop travel from China and not, say, Italy?"
18273,Oh yeah.
18274,Cause he's a racist.
18275,Oh woops it absolutely wasn't my intention.
18276,"I saw you answered me, and then that comment vanished so I went to your profile and thought this chain here was in r/travel."
18277,Apologies!
18278,"Going to need a source on that, the vaccines weren't even announced until essentially after the election, and all sources I've seen have said Trump didn't plan on distributing the vaccine federally but leaving it to the states, meaning he would have nothing to do with the rollout or whether any states decided to do a terrible job at it"

18298,Someone who works in the development or research of vaccines.
18299,"&gt;Doctors are experts on vaccines compared to a random citizen, even a well informed one."
18300,I don't see it this way; see above.
18301,I think you either are an expert or not.
18302,That does not depend on who you are compared to.
18303,"&gt; if a bunch of doctors were to disagree with ""experts"" on vaccine safety I'm not sure how I would determine who is right or wrong

And that's the reason why they should not be cited publicly because tbh the everyday doctor has next to no knowledge apart from his field."
18304,"(Same for 99% of people, me included)"

18313,Seasonality is not weather btw.
18314,"It also includes latitude, humidity, is affected by the rainy vs non-rain season in the Southern Hemisphere, etc."
18315,"“Early in the pandemic, some experts suggested that SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- may behave like many other coronaviruses that circulate more widely in fall and winter."
18316,"To find out if that could be true, researchers analyzed COVID-19 data -- including cases, death rates, recoveries, testing rates and hospitalizations -- from 221 countries."
18317,The investigators found a strong association with temperature and latitude.
18318,"""One conclusion is that the disease may be seasonal, like the flu”"
18319,Man this seems like a scam waiting to happen.
18320,Doctor notes as a service
18321,Because you realistically wouldn't have to wear it for 1-2 months.
18322,Realistically you would have to wear it for 1 more year until under 16 can all get vaccinated.
18323,"It's already basically proven that if you're vaccinated, the chance of you spreading the virus is minimal."
18324,"If we continue down the path of, everyone wears a mask until 80% of the population is vaccinated, that means we'll be waiting for 6+ months with masks."
18325,It's stupid.
18326,"If you're vaccinated you shouldn't have to wear a mask, if you aren't vaccinated, wear a mask not only to stop the spread but also for your own protection."
18327,That's the message that should be sent out.
18328,"We already had plenty of studies that show just by you yourself wearing a mask, you're already reducing the risk of getting COVID by a huge amount."
18329,"So if you're not vaccinated and you're concerned, then double mask up."
18330,If you're vaccinated then no need.
18331,"If you're not vaccinated and you're not concerned and don't want to wear a mask, be prepared to get COVID and hopefully you learned your lesson."
18332,Source?
18333,"Yep Trump promised everyone can get vaccine by April CNN, WP, “Experts” all said no way."
18334,Promise kept!
18335,"I'd want to see hospitalizations due to COVID below 2-4 per 100k per 14 days, and I'd want to see cases of COVID below 50 per 100k per 14 days with a matching test positivity rate below 10% (ideally below 25 per 100k and 5%)."
18336,"I'd expect with those two metrics, deaths should be correspondingly low."
18337,I think we are within reach of achieving these numbers nationwide by July 4th.

18347,"There are almost 600,000 American families missing a loved one."
18348,We don't need more; we need to try and bring the pandemic to an end.
18349,That's why we need people to get vaccinated sooner rather than later.
18350,I recommend you just think about that for a while and some of the stuff I shared in my other comment about long-term effects.
18351,And talk to your doctor.
18352,"My first moderna was a mild hangover, the second was a night of cold sweats, chills and ache."
18353,"I barely slept, called out of work and konked out from 7am to 1pm after that."
18354,I was back in bed at 930pm and basically fine the next day
18355,"Luckily it had the huge vaccine manufacturing infrastructure since before the pandemic, but back at home it was no hero since the beginning -- (pointing fingers at the wilful mismanagement and irresponsible attitude by the government(s))."
18356,"&gt;Whether or not you like it, it's true

Yes, said nobody ever"
18357,We need less divisive language and more positivity and promotion around vaccination.
18358,"Get as many people as possible to promote it, increase advertising, and reassure people that we can ditch the masks once a certain percentage of the population has been jabbed."
18359,Nah deffo not one of them.
18360,Thanks for the recognition!
18361,I think the pandemic has made a change in this.
18362,I've been able to get doctors notes over the phone or video call since the pandemic started.
18363,"And the charge for that has ranged from ""Free if you promise to not bring your sneezing ass into our clinic"" to ""$20 for me to verify that the thermometer you're showing the camera is showing a fever."""
18364,Obviously more serious conditions still need actual visits with more detail.
18365,"But Telehealth has been pretty easy, cheap, and accessible for me for small matters."
18366,It also lets them  quickly flip through appointment.

18385,Loved it.
18386,Happy for you Brits and also more and more optimistic that we Tschörmans who are lagging behind the UK vaccines some 4 to 8 weeks still could have the chance for a quite relaxed summer...
18387,that's insane.
18388,only a child would think in that manner.
18389,"the reason to get the vaccine is so you don't get sick, which will lead to less cases, which will lead to less restrictions."

18404,[removed]
18405,You do realize there are no side effects right?
18406,It's your body making antibodies and doing what it should.
18407,When you get sick it's not cause of the virus in you that's making you sick it's your body making you sick on purpose to basically cook the virus alive... That's what this vaccine is doing..you getting sick isn't a bad thing it's a good thing.
18408,It means the vaccine is working.
18409,Kids will get sick just like we will cause their body works the same way ours does.
18410,They aren't aliens...they have the same bodies and same molecules just less of it.

18421,Let's fucking end this shit.
18422,Is that not until November?
18423,Or might it scare governors into lifting mandates early while the legislature continues to be asleep at the switch?
18424,"My own thought is that the majority of vaccinations are being done at hospitals, pharamacies and other places."
18425,There are so many places that offer it it’s hard to predict if demand is drying up anywhere.
18426,Just my thought.
18427,"Also I think national numbers are just as important as state, if not more."
18428,People are and have traveled during this regardless of recommendations by officials.
18429,And some people have to travel for work too.
18430,"So it’s not how one state is doing, it’s how we as a country."
18431,I see some cautious optimism with the vaccine numbers but that could be a few weeks out.
18432,Manitoba too!
18433,We just lowered our AZ eligibility to 40 and are on track for June
18434,Anybody that's not over their free article limit mind copy/pasting?
18435,Indeed.

18447,Too bad the military overseas dropped the ball and are only on tier 1 over here with no actual hope of receiving the vaccine for at least another month
18448,Which state?
18449,I think you can’t blame that in everyone — focus on your political leaders.
18450,The vaccine is pretty much ubiquitous in my area (New York) after being hard to track down until April.

18466,The general NJ one shows me nothing
18467,"I am not a medical professional, so I have no idea."
18468,They told me to come back in 21 days (3 weeks).

18475,But I have suspicions because I still have very mild shortness of breath (when doing my regular runs) and occasional heart palpitations (PVCs) over a year later.
18476,I read two and up by end of year most likely.
18477,"Wy would that be ""fair""?"
18478,"Why does Joe Smith, not a scientist, think he knows better about the vaccine development stage than people who have gone to school and worked for decades?"
18479,I don't get it.
18480,"Scientists aren't perfect, but they know more than ""some people."""
18481,"And if this vaccine took two years, would that be ""good enough""?"
18482,It's just an excuse.
18483,Hospitalizations are dropping everywhere - [here's the CDC data](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html).
18484,"If you compare the hospitalizations to the peak (Jan. 9), hospitalizations in the 18-49 age group are down about 40%."
18485,In the 65+ age group they're down 80%.
18486,"Given how many of the hospitalizations were among the elderly, that has caused hospitalizations to fall everywhere."
18487,And it’s not like most or anything is even going to check lot number ever.
18488,"Ball parks, stadiums, any non-government entity will never check lot number."
18489,"Maybe air travel would, but there’s no chance we’re going to require vaccination for air travel."

18515,I think you're the one living in a bubble bud.
18516,"It is literally in the article that I’m assuming you didn’t read

“ The state’s Department of Health and Human Services reported 50 pediatric cases in hospitals Thursday, the most since the post-holiday surge in early January.”

“Statewide, the hospitalization rates are higher, therefore they must be sicker,” said Rudolph Valentini, chief medical officer for Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit."
18517,“We’re seeing more kids coming to ER across the state.
18518,"Some are in ICU, and some require mechanical ventilation.””"
18519,You seriously think that the argument you're presenting here is in good faith?
18520,"If this could be spread to the people who are anti-vax, you would see a lot of men want who would want to get(because they take that very serisouly)"
18521,"I don't think he turned anything around, but he definitely did well."
18522,"He set clear goals, he listened to experts and he used his bully pulpit to urge people to get vaccinated."
18523,"Also very important, he pushed states too into virtue signaling to open up vaccines for everyone."
18524,"The goal is to get everyone vaccinated, when Vermont tries to pass rules to favor minorities (while having some of the smallest minority populations in the nation) it is counter-productive."
18525,That is absolutely heartbreaking
18526,Fuck that.

18530,We have vaccinated 5.6% of EU population in the last 15 days.
18531,Even with such rate we could vaccinate up to 50% of EU population by end of June.
18532,"And there is no sign that vaccination rate will decrease, everything is showing that it will only drastically increase."
18533,So 70% of vaccinated by end of June might be even quite conservative estimate.
18534,He is political.
18535,There is no avoiding it - at his level everything is politics.
18536,"He may have medical ability, but that isn't what he is for, he is for politics."
18537,"If he was there for medical ability only he would be seeing patients like every other doctor and you wouldn't have heard of him (other than perhaps some tweets or other social media - a few other doctors have got famous for that, but they are not as politically influential)

This isn't a knock on him - some doctor needs to leave day to day practice aside to deal with politics."
18538,"He must be good at it considering he has been under both Trump and Biden (at least, I didn't look up his history) and political positions like that generally change when parties change."

18541,"-I'm not the only one

18546,"&gt; can't wait until we can ditch the masks

Slate ran an article about how masks outside are pointless."
18547,In due time indoor masking (with vaccination) will be described as pointless as well.
18548,There just remains what appears a never-ending supply of individuals who want to keep this weird dystopia going on as long as possible.
18549,Wait until Covaxin is approved in the United States.
18550,Traditional whole virion vaccine.
18551,That’s what I want for my kiddos.
18552,Great!
18553,I'll try to look into those studies.
18554,Yeah I personally don't have a reason to rush it.
18555,Thanks for the help!
18556,Had a little bit of a fever the next day but went away after about 5 hours.
18557,"Guess the fever is a bit of a trend, but makes sense since the body is always hesitant about things being put into it."
18558,"Yes, and that is interesting."
18559,They were still infected though.
18560,"With 20%+ (remember, these were young healthy people with strong immune systems) of people having immunity wearing off within 6 months, herd immunity would be impossible without vaccines.... and it shows that natural infections will have a less of an effect on vaccine+infection herd immunity than just adding previously infected people to the number of vaccinated people, which was the point this conversation was about."
18561,Because you can't vaccinated without any vaccines.
18562,The supply situation didn't really start to increase until the second quarter.
18563,Because we love to see it.

18586,There are also some word-of-mouth reports that I heard that some places aren’t asking for vaccines but they keep sending them.
18587,If the demand has sagged it’s fine (some rural areas aren’t very much at risk so they’re not worried about getting the vaccine unless they need to go somewhere) but stop sending vaccines to those places.
18588,There are a couple places in very rural VA where they EACH have enough vaccines for the total population around them.
18589,We’ve told VDOH and now they’re taking them back but they should’ve never gotten them.
18590,Yeah.. they had a fuck-up and were behind schedule.
18591,"My 10am appointment became an 12pm appointment.. Decided to just wait it out since I was already there, I could have re-scheduled."
18592,Are they admitting the vaccines are not what they were sold as.
18593,The messaging on the vaccines have been terrible.
18594,Many are now saying what’s the point if we can’t get back to normal
18595,Not sure why you're being downvoted.
18596,I'm a virologist and I feel the same way.
18597,I actually bought masks in late 2019 when flu was going around our department and I had to be stuck in hour-long meetings with snuffly individuals.
18598,I really enjoyed not having a single cold or respiratory illness in the past year.
18599,"I put that down to mask wearing, hand hygeine, and people staying home when they're sick."
18600,Also not having in-person meetings but I think those will resume soon.
18601,"Bottom line, you do what you feel safest doing."
18602,"You might get dirty looks from strangers or whatever, but they don't matter."
18603,Protect yourself and stay healthy!
18604,how did they do this?
18605,Half a million of the storage in Ontario is AZ which boomers didn’t want.
18606,Hopefully we’ll see it shrink down now that they lowered the age.
18607,"No, i mean immunocompromised patients are usually asymptomatic."
18608,Those are the ones that im talking about that are admitted at the hospital and usually they dont make it.
18609,"Normal people with a normal immune system that are asymptomatic, dont even know they are infected, let alone coming to the hospital."
18610,did you read my comment?
18611,"It's not necessarily the time it takes to get the shot, it's the 24-48hrs side affects that have me leery."
18612,"If I wait 2 more weeks, no harm - no foul."
18613,"No, people are just having vastly different experiences..."
18614,I know of several people personally who got the second shot and threw up for multiple days and I know others who had no symptoms.
18615,"Meanwhile in my part of Germany: Still vaccinating 70+ year olds and at risk people only, lol."
18616,In Saskatchewan the age is 48 currently.
18617,"I'm vaccinated as well, I just don't trust government to do the sensible thing when it comes to policies."
18618,I'm in the military and will go on order late next month.
18619,By then I will have been fully vaccinated for over 40 days.
18620,But I still have to quarantine in a hotel room for 2 weeks before I show up.
18621,"The government maintains nonsensical rules all the time, people who work for the government see it constantly."

18626,The UK had indeed a very long and strict lockdown.
18627,"We've been inside for 4 months now, and 2 lockdowns prior."

18634,Yeah the longest part for me was certainly the sitting for 15 minutes.
18635,By the time I walked through the door to when I sat down to wait after was about 5 minutes.
18636,Various state governments have started to criticize the central governments monopoly over vaccines procurement and distribution.
18637,"So, the central government has essentially allowed states to vaccinate 18+ but only with the ones they are able to procure."
18638,The 50% that is procured by central government will be administered per the current central guidelines.
18639,Do you have any specific reason whatsoever why a federal rollout would have been better?
18640,Do you have any specific reason whatsoever why a federal rollout would have been worse?
18641,"I mean, this is the best rollout on earth as far as I'm aware... seems like a good thing."
18642,Lol I agreed with you.
18643,My question is if the people who are most vulnerable to covid have the covid vaccine then how does protecting others justify getting it for myself.
18644,Considering every one of the vaccines are experimental and not FDA why should I risk my life to protect a stranger when they can do it themselves.
18645,Don't get me wrong I believe in vaccines and have always had mine and same with my SO and daughter but when it comes to an unproven vaccine I find myself questioning wether it is worth an unknown risk to myself and my family.
18646,When will the next lowest age group be authorized?
18647,What is the next lowest age group?
18648,Yeah I don’t get that need for a time estimate.
18649,It depends on cases/hospitalizations and that’s incredibly hard to predict.
18650,Feeling a lot better thanks.
18651,They gave me some medicine for the nausea and the next day I was almost perfectly normal.
18652,"As for what caused such a strong reaction the doctor said that it's possible that I could've been exposed to a stomach bug around the same time as when I got my shot, I don't know how it works but I'm okay now so it's all good"
18653,I’m all for reducing vaccine hesitancy but a vaccine with untrustworthy or at the very least wildly inconsistent numbers does not really help do that.
18654,&gt;Make them easily available at a local pharmacy and they’ll do it.
18655,They already are though.
18656,"I went down to a CVS last Tuesday to get the first jab and it took like 20 minutes total, and when I initially signed up online they had tons of slots available for my area."
18657,i can't imagine believing that Trump had any plan whatsoever beyond making the most money possible in the shortest amount of time for him &amp; his cronies
18658,Not really.

18664,Bet republicans are actually the majority of the vaccinated at this point whenlooking at the age of folks how have been vaccinated
18665,People have to decide for themselves whether Chile’s larger study is trustworthy or not.
18666,It’s especially relevant for Latin America’s vaccine rollout.
18667,"If the study reduces vaccine hesitancy and it leverages people’s trust in Chilean scientists to do so, that’s not a bad thing."
18668,"I spent years living in China, am married to a Chinese women, follow Chinese media and speak Chinese."
18669,The Chinese government is not to be trusted.
18670,Is there any research published that shows how effective the vaccines are after two weeks?
18671,Thanks
18672,Those are prob the same people that blame people from california for their rising housing costs in other states instead corporations.

18675,Pfizer is seeking approval for 12-15 in US and elsewhere.
18676,So happy everyone is getting the vaccine!
18677,Haven’t gotten it yet nor will I.
18678,This is correct.
18679,All vaccine appointments in NH are handled through one website (which is surprisingly well-designed and easy to use).
18680,"Doesn't matter if you're getting the vaccine at Walgreens, at a state-run site, or anywhere else, you sign up on the same website."
18681,Which means it's super convenient to compare sites and find a place near you that has available appointments.
18682,It's also really easy to reschedule your appointment if more appointment slots open up.
18683,"Add in the other factors mentioned in this thread (size of the state, demographics, etc), and what you have is efficient handling of supply, high demand, and relatively few administrative bottlenecks."
18684,"Yeah, as much as this sucks, I'll take this over covid any day"
18685,Damn.
18686,You are the first person I've heard of that had to go to the hospital due to side effects.
18687,Could it have been allergic reaction?
18688,How are you feeling now?
18689,“... range of results” prove it.
18690,You’ve provided literally no proof whatsoever for that point.
18691,“...Chile result is the outlier” we don’t know WHICH result is the outlier.
18692,Your own numbers demonstrate that.
18693,"So no, your point is not made (again)."
18694,You clearly have an agenda to push.
18695,You seem very invested to n proving that the Sinovac vaccine can be trusted and that it is as good as the other traditional vaccine products.
18696,However the fact that the numbers you yourself provided quite clearly show that the Sinovac results are simply not trustworthy.
18697,If they can have such a wild range then we really cannot trust ANY of them to be accurate.
18698,"Not Brazil’s, not Chile’s not anyone’s."
18699,That’s the entire problem.
18700,We cannot know and we certainly cannot trust the Chinese government to tell us.
18701,You know nothing about society's collapse.
18702,I was in the clinical trial.
18703,"We were told about the blood clot case, which happened shortly after the trial began."
18704,"At the time, there was insufficient evidence to link the blood clot case to the vaccine (and this was before AZ produced any data either), so the trial resumed."
18705,This is actually the reason the trial was briefly halted in late 2020.
18706,A lot less canadians died.
18707,You will be alright.
18708,"Well, what's your scientific source?"
18709,We're all waiting
18710,"Which means in 3 weeks, 50% will have gotten both doses."
18711,It will be interesting to see because that’s around the mark where Israel saw their cases fall off a cliff cause the virus couldn’t do shit.
18712,Hope we experience the same outcome
18713,For ever 1 of those people I bet there are 20+ that think they are insane and will eventually get vaccinated
18714,"You're getting downvoted, but your frustration echoes the problem pretty well."
18715,The message young people need?
18716,The vaccine will let you return to normal faster.
18717,"No, we don't know exactly how fast, but if enough do it, a normal July and fall has a much higher chance of happening."
18718,Is it guaranteed?
18719,No.
18720,But the 'good' research tells us it can happen if people get their shots.
18721,Source better.
18722,Because they're still looking at the data to try and figure out exactly what the criteria should be.
18723,"There's a lot of factors that go into that--what percent of the population is immune, how much do vaccinated people transmit disease, how well we can detect and suppress another surge, how effective the vaccines are against variants, and how we'll actually check if someone is vaccinated."
18724,"People often act like we know the answers to all of these but for many of these questions we're still in the ""gathering data"" stage."

18726,"think for a microsecond about what would happen in this litigious society if they make some bright-eyed bushy-tailed young mom sign the warning form that everybody signs before getting their shot, then she drops dead of a blood clot."
18727,multiplied by 1 case per million.
18728,there are plenty of ways to generate immense amounts of litigation from that situation.
18729,the USA isn't a risk tolerant society.
18730,Then why are we arguing?
18731,My original comment was to support someone who simply asked why removing mask restrictions outdoors was a bad idea.
18732,I simply pointed out that crowded places outdoors can increase the risk.
18733,The meta study itself has proof of that.
18734,"In the study, they did see a rise in infections after protests."
18735,But it was less than expected.
18736,Most protesters still wore masks if not socially distanced.
18737,You are clearly a lot more conscious and smarter.
18738,So it seems we had a misunderstanding.
18739,I apologize for swearing at you.
18740,I have a medical background and it bugs me that people are offended by simple measures and even make bad arguments on social media or reddit.
18741,That being said I got angry at the wrong person and I apologize again.
18742,Great information.
18743,Thank you.
18744,Still doesn’t totally change my opinion on AstraZeneca.
18745,Blood clotting also a bigger side effect than other vaccines.
18746,"These have rolled out so fast, and I’m glad they have."
18747,But I think we can look at the risks associated with each and decide what shot we’re willing to take.
18748,Again thanks for the great video and information.
18749,I’ll pass this on.
18750,"I have to say I'm genuinely surprised Fauci even hinted anything about changing mask recommendations changing soon, I thought it would be much longer for that to happen."
18751,If I had to guess I'd say the recommendation from CDC will be outdoor mask mandates are no longer needed.
18752,Progress is progress
18753,Jesus christ you guys are literal babies down there aren't you

18770,Yea that part totally makes sense and I know of several people who sought it out due to that.
18771,"In my case I took the first appointment I could get which said Moderna and ended up being J&amp;J. 

I don’t think we have good comparative data yet and the approaches have a lot or similarities."
18772,I’m just watching for the data to come in and decide if it makes sense to seek out a booster from another company or not.
18773,And it sounds like we’ll all eventually need boosters anyway.
18774,"Our cvs/target had little water bottles, juice drinks, goldfish packs and granola bars."
18775,"One thing that is striking about NH’s performance is that they weren’t doing especially well (above average but not notably so) until about a week or two ago, when their performance suddenly surged."

19066,Most people are crap for purposes of determining anything.
19067,That's the real conclusion you provided.
19068,As usual you morons can't source a single study to back your bullshit up.
19069,It's bullshit all the way down.
19070,"Ah yes, the cremations."
19071,I remember when the same story was used to claim China had millions dead last January.
19072,"Now, those same people claim China has hardly any deaths."
19073,[deleted]
19074,Is there a comprehensive info dump / tracker for the variants?
19075,E.g.
19076,"on CDC there is B117, B1.351, P1, B1.427, B1.429, and today Texas announced the discovery of BV1."
19077,I wonder if the academic literature is documenting more variants but the MSM just haven't caught up.
19078,Probably when positive cases start significantly dropping.
19079,They are dropping but still 7-8x as high as it was last summer.
19080,"If it hits those 2020 summer numbers, mask mandate ends."
19081,"Because people like Fauci have gone out of their way to say ""it changes nothing, you cannot return to normal because other people won't get the shot""."
19082,We still have subreddits dedicated to among other things discouraging the taking of vaccines.
19083,Systemic viral RNA from actual viral infections clear pretty quickly.
19084,It's fine.
19085,"I can’t get it, doctor says the risk of COVID being serious for me is lower than my risk of my autoimmune disease acting up, but I’m happy for those who can."
19086,"...okay, what does that have to do with my post?"
19087,I'm saying Fauci is being divisive.
19088,[removed]
19089,"My understanding was that the emergency use thing shortened the bureaucratic/red tape process, not the trials."
19090,Do you have some information that says otherwise?
19091,"No, the last 6 weeks as I’ve said repeatedly."
19092,My point has always been it’s either been very strict but not very long (until 8th March) or very long but not very strict if you consider up to now because that includes a lot of time with less restrictions.
19093,"Fucking hell, could have done this in 2 replies if you’d actually read what I wrote at the start."
19094,If the cost was reasonable I could see buying these to use on my unvaccinated kids.
19095,Taking kids to the testing site gets really old after a year of it!
19096,My man!
19097,Wouldn't be ANYWHERE NEAR happening if we had a 2 term narcissist in chief
19098,It's all RNA and there's no reverse transcriptase in it so the absolute worst that can happen to you is have a day of bad side effects
19099,It felt like Christmas when it was finally my turn here.
19100,Very happy for you.
19101,"Blocking you, don’t need the abuse."
19102,I definitely understand what that much work can do!
19103,I bet you'll get it sorted out soon.
19104,I'm getting my first dose tomorrow.
19105,Happy 4/20!!
19106,!
19107,Do you have a source for that from Pfizer?
19108,I haven't heard that and I am curious- also coincidentally a week after my second :)
19109,"&gt;the capacity to create them 

Are you serious?"
19110,EU is one of the worlds leaders in vaccine production with more than 200mln doses produced and around half of them exported to countries outside EU.
19111,I was THAT guy.
19112,Because of that I high-tailed it down to the vax clinic when they opened it up for my group.
19113,"Spot on, and this is why all the 'who cares, we have plenty of amazing mRNA' stuff here was so cringeworthy when the pause happened."
19114,"If you're NOT 65y old+, a medical or social worker, a teacher, a 12th grader or have a serious chronic illness - no vaccine for you in Lithuania :("
19115,I think we actually agree with each other and I may have worded it poorly.
19116,"I have had employers tell me ( an owner of a dealership) that he didn’t believe in sick days, so thats why they dont offer them."
19117,I told him believe it or not people get sick (shocker) and should stay home or they just pass it on.
19118,We didn’t see eye to eye on that.
19119,I mean we haven't really opened back up here in the UK.
19120,We have data on hospitalisation etc that looks very good but the real test will be in May/June when we try to return to relative normality and assess what happens to hospitalizations and deaths in that time.
19121,Israel is pretty clear evidence that vaccines allow a return to normality (or close to it) even before any kind of boosters etc.
19122,They are pretty close to open and doing well thanks to their extremely high vaccination rate
19123,"... you do know there's still UV rays when it's cloudy, right?"
19124,Cloudiness can actually cause the UV index to be higher.
19125,"You're right, I had looked at the numbers in the wrong place, and listed southern states percentages of fully vaccinated, and the highest states for percentages of people having at least one dose."
19126,That's a bit embarrassing.
19127,You called the antivaxxers stupid and selfish.
19128,It’s implied that I was referring to the same people when I called them stupid and selfish.
19129,Of course there’s a risk.
19130,"There‘s a risk every time you shove your kids in the car and drive around, too, and most people don’t think twice about that."
19131,And yet I’d speculate there’s a good chance a kid has a higher chance of dying in a traffic accident than of Covid.
19132,"The question is whether the risk is tolerable, and that’s up to each individual parent."
19133,"putting on a mask is not a hardship, this goes back to the fact that people are so weak minded they can’t handle a minor inconvenience to save lives, US is just filled with pussies."
19134,That concern goes down a lot if the parents and other family of those children are vaccinated.
19135,I mean obviously we'd prefer it not to be spreading between anyone but that shouldn't be enough of an issue to push these kinds of masks/social distancing restrictions into 2022.
19136,So basically what I'm saying is you have alternative solutions to slowing down that spread for that age group like remote schooling.
19137,It's not ideal but 10% of the population still being at risk shouldn't dictate the other 90%.
19138,We may be at that point by the fall.
19139,"It’s been a year, calling people selfish and irresponsible doesn’t work anymore"
19140,Yes that’s true.
19141,And if they incentivize the vaccine with $$$ then I’m sure a bunch of other people would get it.
19142,Isn’t on the production company to also certify the capability of its supplying facilities in advance of all distribution ventures?
19143,Regardless somebody somewhere has to be held accountable when preventable incidents like this slow vaccine rollout
19144,Only a couple hours until I get my second shot!
19145,Yeah I know at least a few people who have had COVID that got the vaccine.
19146,Though I also know some people who got COVID that don't intend to get it
19147,I don't think that's true.
19148,LA and San Francisco  and NY are the largest cities and most people there are democrats... Those 3 cities have more of a population than most of the upper mid west states combined and those areas are always red.
19149,"We are, essentially there too."
19150,"Remember, the number right now that comes out for states and the CDC is lower than what it actually is."
19151,"There is carryover from prior days, as well as the day before."
19152,"This goes for cases, testing and all other metrics."
19153,"It was yesterday, for all 39.5% for first doses, and vaccinations complete, 25.4%, and that's all US citizens too!"
19154,"Of course percent vaccinated is based on census, and the numbers have changed, so it's an estimate."
19155,"I think, a change could be probably two weeks away, at the earliest."
19156,"Even though that amount is vaccinated, full protection hasn't fully taken affect, so the number is probably a bit lower."
19157,"I think I've read it was about 50% for Israel, which is still a bit away for us, so there's hope things will markedly improve soon."
19158,"We aren't there yet though, but we can get there."
19159,"Unfortunately, even when the J&amp;J was in full effect, the majority were still between five to six weeks for full effectiveness, so it takes awhile."
19160,It’s on the CDC for coming up with such a ludicrously easy to fake vaccine card.
19161,"Instead of being handwritten, they must be a requirement for printed labels of administered stuck on to the cards."
19162,I’ve seen ones where the pharmacy or site has stuck on labels but mine is handwritten by the pharmacist.
19163,You can get skin cancer on a cloudy day or sunburned (it actually increases the light bouncing around).
19164,Cdc recommended temp for beef gives damn good tasty results and it's not well done.
19165,This whole subreddit is a dada-esque absurdity at this point.
19166,[removed]
19167,Not everyone reacts the same to illness.
19168,"While you may feel ok to work, colleagues who catch whatever you had could be down for days."
19169,This has happened to me.
19170,Workplaces need more forgiving sick leave policies to encourage everyone to stay home while even slightly sick.
19171,"Unlimited sick leave and/or the ability to work from home under these circumstances would be so helpful to people whose immune systems aren't as strong as the person who came in feeling just ""kind of"" sick."
19172,"Yes, once in a century."
19173,"Did some napkin math and both the Hong Kong Flu and 1957 influenza pandemic killed about 500 per 1,000,000 whereas this current pandemic is at 1,750 deaths per million."
19174,570k deaths vs. 675k during the 1920 pandemic.
19175,Mine is literally a piece of paper.
19176,Not even card stock.
19177,They didn’t even fill in the lot number.
19178,Why aren't you vaccinated?
19179,Thanks!
19180,I find it interesting that the most common symptom listed in people experiencing long covid is an anxiety disorder.
19181,Obviously catching a global pandemic scale disease can be distressing and I definitely expect some residual psychological effects from it.
19182,"From a purely medicinal standpoint, I'm wondering if it should be counted as a long covid symptom though?"
19183,India too just announced all 18 years and above citizens will be eligible for vaccine from 1st may
19184,"Didn't happen to me on Gmail, that is strange."
19185,I’m a parent of a four year old.
19186,I’m in exactly the same boat.
19187,"This, exactly."
19188,The messaging from American public health officials since the pandemic began has been pretty bad.
19189,But the messaging about specifically the vaccines has been near catastrophic.
19190,The message should be: “these vaccines are virtually a 100% cure for this pandemic.
19191,"Take them and we can all go back to the movies, restaurants, cruises, and our children’s sporting events.” 

I received my second Pfizer dose today."
19192,"In two weeks, there is no scientific reason I should have to wear a mask."
19193,"But because of Fauci’s comments, I will still have to mask up for the rest of 2021."
19194,And it really does make it more difficult for me to breathe.
19195,My parents are vaccinated with AZ.
19196,Not sure how effective it is against the variant that is now sweeping India.
19197,Our govt didn't allow us to buy Pfizer or Moderna even on our own because of fairness and socialism ( shitty quality vaccines for all) we could have even taken a flight to the US to get vaccinated but the govt does not allow travel for getting vaccines
19198,&gt; How do you send an employee home for a week if their job requires manual or on-site labor?
19199,"Did you not notice my comment saying ""coming to the office""?"
19200,The grand majority of office jobs do not require manual onsite labor.
19201,"That being said, you raise a good point, and as I've said to another response we need real labor protections in this country."
19202,"For the sore arm, use a stress ball on the side you're getting your shot."
19203,"And after you get your shot, use it as well or move your arm around (rotating your shoulders, whatever)."
19204,It works out your arm and helps you feel less sore.
19205,Did this when I got my first does last weekend and didn't feel sore (unless you jabbed or punched me right where I got the shot).
19206,I’m starting to suspect that these people that spew this “vaccines don’t work against variants!!!!
19207,!” garbage are bots.
19208,"You guys are so confidently wrong, it’s funny."
19209,"&gt; If you're fully vaccinated the mask is just theatre

Not true."
19210,"It is unclear if you can still pass it to others, and you can still get infected yourself."
19211,"Moderna prevents 95% of infections, NOT 100%."
19212,And the J&amp;J is less effective than that.
19213,It isn't theater.
19214,It should encourage the vax hesitant but the moment he says it's okay to not wear a mask if vaccinated the entire anti vax anti mask group will stop wearing them and claim they're vaccinated.
19215,"If it was % population based you could fight it better, but if he flipped the switch today's 10s of millions of people would immediately stop wearing them and we don't have herd immunity yet."
19216,Edit: The longer he waits the closer we get to herd immunity.
19217,And there's enough studying the impact on transmission left to hold on a bit longer.
19218,It’d be great if the US can start exporting some.
19219,Just a request lol
19220,Does anyone know what the chances are for having a bad reaction from your 2nd shot if you had a bad reaction from your 1st?
19221,Or any insight here?
19222,My 1st shot (Moderna) caused severe muscle/joint pain in my lower back and SI joints...to the point where I couldn't get out of bed and called an ambulance.
19223,My 2nd shot is scheduled for this Friday and I'm terrified of getting it.
19224,I'm still recovering from the 1st and can't be down again.
19225,"And you're showing little empathy to everyone else by asking them to cater to your needs by sacrificing ""just a little more""."
19226,Nice edits.
19227,You were going on about efficacy being 90% and that's why you wont let her near your kids.
19228,"\&gt; that still doesn't add up to 100% protection, and when my kids are  unvaccinated and with high risk factors involved, I'm not risking it."
19229,I have nearly every single high risk factor and I'll still gladly be around people with the vaccine rather than fear monger over the efficacy rate.
19230,I was just in hospital due to the UK variant.
19231,"\&gt; if my mom is covered by 95% efficacy and my kids are *also*  covered by 95% efficacy, that's another story and makes it virtually  impossible to get sick or more importantly, severely sick."
19232,"They can still get sick and end up having to go to a hospital, the vaccine prevents death."
19233,It doesn't mean you can't fall severely ill still.
19234,Amazing how you're going on about this after complaining about 90% efficacy.
19235,\&gt;so I'll wait  until they are fully vaccinated instead of risking it with someone who  visits anti-masker mass congregations twice a week.
19236,You can still get sick as can she with the vaccine.
19237,It looks like it stops asymptomatic spread so far but that's being studied actively.
19238,"Yeah my GF isn't even a citizen, she's an international student, and she was able to get a vaccine"
19239,"All due respect, I disagree with your assessment that is was never cool."
19240,I’ve worked in a corporate setting for a very long time and the amount of people that think it’s a badge of honor to come in sick is absolutely ludicrous.
19241,"We have sick time, doctors notes are not required, and we’re even “encouraged” to stay home if we feel sick."
19242,"I put that in quotations because it’s verbally encouraged as a matter of necessity, but please believe upper management judges you if you do stay home too often and it will affect the way you’re treated and perceived."
19243,The toxic culture of working while sick is insanely prevalent in today’s workforce and it’s not always just because you can’t get the days or you don’t get sick time at all.
19244,It’s often intentionally forced into the culture.
19245,Productivity above all else.
19246,"That said, your second point about not getting proper sick days is also a problem, but it’s also connected to creating that toxic culture I mentioned."
19247,"If you go through your career with little to no sick days and finally get a job where they’re actually offered, your mentality from previous jobs will stay with you."
19248,You feel bad using those days and thus you come into work despite risking your and your coworkers health.
19249,This post appears to be about vaccines.

19256,Majority of working population is left vulnerable due to work and related traveling in metro cities.
19257,"&gt; The downvotes come from people spewing misinformation that the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid, only reduces it to a mild case."
19258,This is NOT true.
19259,"These vaccines are over 90% effective at preventing infection

But you are contradicting yourself."
19260,It doesn't guarantee you won't get sick.
19261,"Moderna for example prevents ~95% of symptomatic cases, and 100% against severe cases."
19262,"The point is that we all need to keep up with social distancing (as recommended, nothing wrong with a small group of vaccinated people getting together) and mask wearing and hand washing (which honestly if covid disappeared today we should really still be doing)."
19263,"There is nothing untrue about saying the vaccines aren't 100% effective against infection, or that it is unclear if you can infect others even if you don't get sick."
19264,"holup... are you suggesting that responsible people should ""stay home"" because irresponsible covidiots are too f'ing stupid to get a vaccine and are continuing to intentionally spread the virus?"
19265,It honestly isn't clear in your post who you think should stay home.
19266,How about staying home from work in general.
19267,At the very least I’d like to see companies start implementing work-from-home fridays or something like that
19268,"from what i’ve seen fauci only will give an estimate of around 85%, which i think we all can agree getting 85% of people in this country to do anything is next to impossible"

19270,Pretty sure people in party's get pretty close to each other.
19271,"Same day I was a little dizzy, and my arm was a little sore, but for me the second day was always when symptoms peaked, and then started to subside, and by day 4 I was baseline."
19272,You must be American or Israeli.
19273,"Most of the trials are done outside of China anyways, downside of having low cases"
19274,Ugh I’m a little worried.
19275,I get my second shot tomorrow but I met up with my friend during lunch because I haven’t seen him in months and out of obligation I felt like I should.
19276,And since I have the first shot I have some immunity at least.
19277,"anyways, the place we went to no one was wearing masks (I wore mine double masked the entire time minus when I wasn’t eating) and now I’m a little nervous about getting the coronavirus."
19278,This!
19279,I also have three kids at home with one being extremely high risk for covid complications.
19280,We live in a heavily red area where vaccine appointments have gone unfilled and have slowed at 30% vaccinated.
19281,Mask wearing was never a thing here.
19282,The virus burned hot and fast through our town and many have caught it twice.
19283,I don’t know what we’re going to do if those around us don’t vaccinate.
19284,"Moving isn’t an option, but we have to keep our guard up until my high risk kid (8 yr old) is vaccinated."
19285,I know there are others in our town in the same boat.
19286,"Sure it’s safe for vaccinated, but not everyone is yet."
19287,So we move about cautiously still.
19288,Guess why that would be the case?
19289,Some people will always find a reason to be upset or shocked or annoyed.
19290,"If they gave a specific percentage is bet it would help, but the “I’ll know when I see it” approach just doesn’t fly anymore"
19291,Why do muscle issues seem possible?
19292,They're clearly not asymptomatic if they die.
19293,I hope that the reason why we are moving at such a quick pace is that a significant amount of people are not going to get vaccinated by a still in trials vaccine.
19294,So the government now has millions of vaccines but not enough people willing to take then so they keep on lowering the threshold.
19295,Unless I missed something it was supposed to take months as the vaccine producers already had everything set up for different countries and their supply chain was at a limit.
19296,No real evidence though...
19297,This tracks with all the anecdotal evidence I've seen about the immune response to these shots.
19298,"If your immune system is primed, either from a first shot or from COVID infection, the body seems to have a stronger reaction."
19299,Everyone I know who's had a rough time after the first shot was aware that they'd had COVID or suspected as much but didn't get tested to confirm.
19300,This means no ones taking them?
19301,Well I'm just making sure you understand.
19302,"It's not just the injection site itself, like a grapefruit sized pimple, but my entire arm below the shoulder where I got the shot was swollen."
19303,"&gt; can’t spread it

Again, that's an exaggeration."
19304,Pandemics don't work in absolutes.
19305,You're also completely ignoring what I'm saying about the need to set an example.
19306,But you do you.
19307,"Just don't be confident that you ""did your part"" if you stopped doing even the easiest mitigation measures before most people could get vaccinated."
19308,"What bugs me about this though is that I find out I'm much higher risk than I realized, and they made me eligible since 3/15, and my doctors didn't even know it."
19309,"When I brought it up in April, my doctor said ""I recommend you schedule your shot"" and then I got an automated message that I'm not eligible and I'll get a notification, and they even linked to a document that shows I'm eligible."
19310,"Supply limitations or not, my provider fucked up and I'm curious if other people in my eligibility group weren't notified and had no idea, and got sick, possibly even died."
19311,"Maybe it would've still taken a while due to supply, but my healthcare provider fucked up hard there IMO."
19312,My wife was eligible as well and that's what upsets me the most... she goes into work.
19313,"They should've taken care of us and notified us, but they slipped."
19314,The whole messaging has been a mess since day one and I get that some people are confused because Biden and Fauci encourage getting vaccinated but still wearing masks.
19315,Then we have scientific studies saying double masking is more effective but then it's in a lab setting and then there was that whole Sturgis Rally which a group of economists claimed caused a huge spread.
19316,Also doesn't help that the whole thing was politicised since the start.
19317,"I'm at a point where I'm saying fuck it, I haven't been a recluse this whole year but I also haven't been reckless and going to wild parties indoors so I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing."

&gt; Approximately 56% of Israel’s 9.2 million citizens are vaccinated and another 15% (approximately 700,000 people) recovered from Covid-19, putting Israel comfortably in the expected herd immunity range."
19345,Every time my girlfriend would give me a hug...
19346,I'd flinch and make sure I put my arms over hers.

19348,"It's approved for ""emergency use"" which is slightly different:

&gt; The EUA process is different than an FDA approval or clearance."
19349,"Under an [emergency use authorization], in an emergency, the FDA makes a product available to the public based on the best available evidence, without waiting for all the evidence that would be needed for FDA approval or clearance."
19350,"([FDA.gov](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/understanding-regulatory-terminology-potential-preventions-and-treatments-covid-19))

No idea on the liability for manufacturers."
19351,"No, somewhere in India, don't know where exactly but the whole country should be in lockdown."
19352,Okay.
19353,"If we put you in charge, exactly what metrics need to change *aside* from vaccination rates for you to recommend the end of social distancing and masking?"
19354,so many people i know that have no interest in getting it say because they had it before they see no need to “risk it” on a vaccine
19355,"I just don't understand this ""need"" to stop wearing masks."
19356,It's not that big of a deal and they work pretty well against respiratory diseases.
19357,Especially in high density/low ventilation indoor spaces.
19358,Next cold/flu season I might still wear a medical mask if I find myself in a subway or maybe do more takeout instead of indoor dining.
19359,It would be nice to not have the cold or flu on an annual basis.

19361,Oh damn.
19362,It hit you same day or next day?
19363,I got the second dose coming my way in about 3 weeks
19364,"I think Biden said that's what his hope is, is that 4th of July can feel somewhat normal again."
19365,"Ironic though there are alot of people who act like every day should be the 4th of July, who hate Biden and refuse to wear a mask or get vaccinated."
19366,Yep it’s a total mess.
19367,The states has never been so divided
19368,I think the West Coast as a whole has an advantage when it comes to the pandemic in that it's better suited to carrying out year-round activities outdoors more than any other region in the country.
19369,"Other than LA in December-January (and perhaps you can attribute that to LA being by far the most populated and dense city on the West Coast), there haven't been any ugly outbreaks in that part of America."
19370,That's just patently false.
19371,If they went through all the same hoops they would be FDA approved.

19373,I don't know.
19374,"After a very bad year of Covid nursing and then a family (Covid) death, I really don't have it in me to follow the numbers any more."

19379,"Genuinely curious, at what point in your observation do you believe that you would conclude that there are no long term effects, assuming there are none?"
19380,6 months?
19381,12 months?
19382,2 years?
19383,"Yeah, if the vaccine was promoted more as a return to normal life, more people would be on board with getting it."
19384,Maybe they're young and healthy?
19385,I do think it's questionable giving brand new vaccines to 90% or whatever of the population.
19386,I mean what if 10% of the vaccinated develop heart failure in 3 years and die 3 years after that?
19387,"(Not saying I think heart failure is a probable thing, but muscle issues do seem possible, and the heart is a muscle) That would be a spectacular own goal for a country that did that."
19388,Governments should be considering all angles.
19389,"Mistakes have been made before with drugs / vaccines, and will be made again."
19390,"There's no question that covid19 gives most trouble to the old and infirm, so for them the risk/reward equation is easy - get the vaccine!"
19391,"But for the healthy we don't know what the risk from the vaccines is, they're too new, we just know that more risks will become apparent over time."
19392,(I think stage 3 trials are still ongoing?)
19393,"For younger, healthy people I absolutely think not taking a vaccine is a valid choice, the risk from covid is very low for them."

19396,"I worked in live entertainment before all this, and the theater near me (New England) that hosts Broadway tours recently announced they’re reopening at full capacity (3,200 people) for a new season of shows starting in October."
19397,"I wouldn’t be surprised if masks are required at first, and only time will tell, but It felt so good to see that headline."
19398,They should be dropping off right now.
19399,England is down to 1 death after following the 1 dose ASAP strategy.
19400,"Your link shows that Trump did fail, and didn't have a plan, and left it to the states."
19401,Who were unprepared and not being supported by the federal government.
19402,How well was that working?
19403,"Well according to the article YOU linked ""The Trump administration’s approach was flawed, experts said""  It wasn't working well, Biden changed it, and it's working better now."
19404,Seems to have changed and be better.
19405,"Completely factual that he did not have a plan, the states were supposed to have the plan (which is sad for the federal government to shove a NATIONAL emergency onto individual states)"
19406,"Actually, I'm not trying to bait you at all."
19407,What potential risks are you referring to?
19408,I had reservations about these vaccines at first.
19409,"Then I saw the science that came out, and I was thoroughly convinced that *everyone* who can should take them."
19410,Then I saw what happened in Israel.
19411,Vaccines have pretty much brought the pandemic to an end there.
19412,"It wasn't enough for old folks to get the shot--young people had to step up too, to get them close to something like herd immunity."
19413,"Yeah, but even the typical bad reactions only last a day or two at most."
19414,I had covid and I've been vaccinated.
19415,"I definitely felt bad for a day after my first dose, but I've had worse hangovers."
19416,"People are downvoting you because getting vaccinated would be a net gain for society, but you're choosing not to because of selfish reasons."
19417,"Also, when I had covid my symptoms were mild."
19418,The worst part is I still can't smell and I would recommend getting vaccinated just to prevent that from happening.
19419,"I miss being able to smell things, even bad-smelling stuff."
19420,[deleted]
19421,Source?
19422,Honestly I don't care that much about the mask mandates indoors.
19423,"In my area, for example you are supposed to wear a mask at the entrance to a restaurant but once you sit down you can take it off."
19424,This often means just wearing a mask for like 30 seconds.
19425,"Which, by the way, makes it completely useless to me, it's all just for show."
19426,"More onerous to me is the complete closure of indoor spaces, for example no bars in my area are open, only tables spread apart."
19427,"Restaurants have limited capacity, most indoor music venues, gyms, movie theaters, and other such activities are closed, etc."
19428,"Somewhat inexplicably, most outdoor kids activities are also prohibited."
19429,It isn't just the masks it's all the other closures.
19430,jawless paul?
19431,that's who i picked it up from
19432,"He gained a lot of death threats,!"
19433,"I just got mine 15 minutes ago, in the 15 observation (leaving now)."
19434,I’m done!
19435,Except maybe side effects tomorrow.
19436,And 2 week wait for full protection.
19437,Because I have a 99.97% chance of surviving covid if I do get it and I've been working even more since covid started and have even been around people who tested positive while still managing to not contract it myself.
19438,I've also made it my entire life without participating in a clinical trial let alone in one for something I have a massive chance of surviving if I ever do catch it.
19439,Aside from being called a racist for shutting down travel from the origin of the virus.
19440,That’s exactly how it happened for me!
19441,"&gt; vasovagal syncope

I have this too!"
19442,"Every time I get a shot or get blood drawn, my heart rate and blood pressure plummet and I often pass out."
19443,"HOWEVER, this did not happen to me with my first Pfizer shot!"
19444,(Still waiting on the second shot.)
19445,"The needle was sooooo tiny and in for less than 2 seconds, so I think my body didn't even realize what was happening."
19446,I was low-key freaking out before hand but was totally fine.
19447,"Making excuses for anti-vaxxers, nice man"
19448,"It's a common misconception that without biden ""turning things around"" we would be nowhere near we are now."
19449,Before Biden even took office america was on track to smash the goals he set in terms of vaccinations in the first 100 days.
19450,He could have taken over literally changed nothing and still achieved his goal.
19451,The symptoms are different for everyone.
19452,"For me, the 2nd pfizer shot made me feel fever symptoms and had me struggle to get up the day after I got it."
19453,"It would have been a pain in the ass, if I had to go to work that day."
19454,"But the symptoms completely vanished the next day, except for the sore arm, which was good."
19455,My first grader makes it work but absolutely hates it.
19456,My kindergarten has struggled mightily during COVID.
19457,Thankfully they are starting 4 days again this week.
19458,Both of my kids have definitely had mental stress because of this.
19459,There is real harm there.
19460,What are you afraid of for your 4 year old?
19461,Does she have preexisting conditions?
19462,"Ooh, 2m/day?"
19463,Where from?
19464,I thought we were stuck at the rate we're at now for the foreseeable.
19465,That’s fucked up
19466,Everyone is different.
19467,Three of my family members said it was awful so I expect the likelihood for me is high.
19468,But a lot of other people said it was pretty much nothing.
19469,"The overall population is pretty young in India, so the low death rate isn't surprising."
19470,"But death isn't the only or even crippling issue in India, it's the health system being completely overwhelmed and broken in country with extremely high population density and many poor areas."
19471,"This will lead into other issues secondary to covid, such as non-covid related deaths, access of Health care being limited etc."
19472,"Just checked today for my area (sacramento, CA) and I couldn't get an appointment anywhere."
19473,I work food service but apparently that's not a higher priority.
19474,It's really irritating.
19475,It was determined 116 years ago that [vaccines can be legally compelled if necessary.
19476,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts) Fortunately people of the past knew better, or we'd still have smallpox and polio."
19477,The county I live in was only using J&amp;J vaccine for homebound and homeless people.
19478,Since J&amp;J is one and done it made it a lot easier to get these groups of people vaccinated.
19479,Hopefully the J&amp;J vaccine comes back soon.
19480,My first thought too.
19481,It's like..I can work just fine but I'm also sick with a cold.
19482,So I should be able to work from home and not get people sick.
19483,Seems like a win-win situation that I feel like most employers won't agree to because of course they wouldn't.
19484,"Sorry bro, I've felt plenty safe eating out and working without a mask for a long time now."
19485,Now that I've got my Fauci ouchies I'm outta fucks to give!
19486,Partying out in Florida next weekend!
19487,If you're still scared wait two more weeks after two more weeks after another 2 more weeks then wait 2 more weeks and well you probably get it.
19488,The rest of us are moving on.
19489,Not surprising that this became a problem after the virus got politicized.
19490,It's worse.
19491,It's totally organic at this point.
19492,"This New York Times article (not even an opinion piece) is written for people like you: https://archive.vn/lYMft

&gt; Victory over Covid will not involve its elimination."
19493,Victory will instead mean turning it into the sort of danger that plane crashes or shark attacks present — too small to be worth reordering our lives.
19494,Just look at that person's post history.
19495,They are only here to argue.
19496,Does anyone know when the vaccines will become FDA-approved?
19497,Like is this possible this year.
19498,This is what I don't understand from those people.
19499,"Economically, a microchip would be so much extra work when we literally have phones that already do that..."
19500,"Emergency approval is *technically* different from standard approval, but the vaccines went through all the same hoops."
19501,I actually hit an extra rep on bench the day after my first shot lol
19502,Would you run a race without a finish line?
19503,Sounds tiring.
19504,This.
19505,I did the same and no one cares as long as you get the shot.
19506,Is it necessary to rush vaccines when they have less total deaths than what some countries had die in a single day?
19507,we need more investigation on the role &amp; influence of T-cells to block viral replication.
19508,I haven't seen any hard data that measures T-cell response in a quantifiable way for any of these vaccines.
19509,"Oh, we'll get over 70% once employers mandate it."
19510,And they will.
19511,Business liability insurance will make sure of that.
19512,[deleted]
19513,Because it’s approved under emergency use - some people don’t trust how fast it came out which I think is fair.
19514,"If someone doesn’t want to vaccinate themselves, they shouldn’t be forced to until it’s fully approved"
19515,Terrible analogy here
19516,"Imma get 2nd Pfizer shot on May5, and everyone tells me to drink water for that one."
19517,"Like, I'm in good shape and stuff, so I hope it doesn't mess me up too bad."
19518,But it's making me nervous lol
19519,"Fauci, Biden, pretty much all public health officials at local and national levels agree that closing schools is harmful."
19520,"Glad it worked out for your kid, but I think you're being myopic with your response."
19521,Memorial Day in Washington and California will likely still be restricted.
19522,And it was “lit” for most of the country last year.
19523,Didn’t you see the spike afterwards?
19524,I don't have sick days.

19528,Day9?
19529,They are paying £5000 to each subject.
19530,Genuinely curious how you figure we wouldn't have any vaccines without Trump?
19531,Do you think the response would have been different with a different president?
19532,"Like let's say Hillary won, what do you think she would have done so differently that we would have no vaccines?"
19533,The amount of selfishness and ignorance in some the comments here illustrates why Covid got so bad.
19534,"Yeah, my second Pfizer is Thursday."
19535,"I took Friday off, I hear the second shot can be rough for a day or two afterward."
19536,Models are an abstraction of reality.
19537,"In the real world, a model's assumptions are tested and change in unpredictable ways."
19538,"A new variant that is significantly more transmissible, a new variant that evades immune response, population heterogeneity leaving some subgroups still very vulnerable, and variances in background seropositivity rates would all affect whatever ""magic number"" they might give."
19539,What happens if they say 70% but a new variant requires more like 85%?
19540,Or if the 30% that are unvaccinated appear disproportionately in each other's networks (hint: they do) and we get sustained outbreaks among vaccine skeptics?
19541,Or if 70% is fine in NYC after so many had it a year ago but it's still short of what upstate communities need?
19542,"Or if 50% appears fine, but previously seropositive people start getting infected again?"
19543,"The need to walk back the ""magic number"" that they gave would damage their credibility even though it's the public that didn't understand how complicated it is - not the scientists."
19544,*flashes back to Into The Wild*
19545,"Obviously there is no way to 100% be sure you were not exposed, but if you got one of the two-dose vaccines and are more than a couple of weeks out you should have a pretty high degree of protection already."
19546,So I wouldn't worry about it unless you start having symptoms.
19547,That research doesn't distinguish between pfizer and moderna?
19548,I guess they must think there's no obvious difference between the two?
19549,I had my second one Saturday and nothing other than sore arm.
19550,"I wasn't expecting anything because the rest of my family all got theirs before me and really didn't have much, although my mother didnt have any pop up until a few days later so maybe today or tomorrow

one friend of mine it floored him after his second dose, had to call in sick from work"

19560,Same here!
19561,Husband and I are in our 30's and we both got our second pfizer last week.
19562,sore arm and the second night he was getting chills so we went to sleep early.
19563,I was certain we'd be very sick since we're young and haven't caught covid.
19564,"It wasn't worse than getting a flu shot, which we also do yearly."
19565,"Oh gotcha, thanks 👍"
19566,It never set to begin with.
19567,The flu strain vaccine created every year is a narrowed-down-to-1 strain that is predicted to be the most virulent and prevalent flu virus strain out of thousands of mutations of the flu virus that occur between species every year.
19568,"It’s not that the vaccine “does nor doesn’t work”, it’s that the predicted dominant strain ends up not being the dominant one after all, even though it is very likely circulating through populations."
19569,A more dominant strain circulates as well and that’s how people who are vaccinated still end up with the flu.
19570,"The vaccine is no harm no foul though, and would still likely protect an individual from severe symptoms as long as the strain isn’t too much different than the strain they’re vaccinated from (read more about protein spikes on viruses-interesting stuff)."
19571,It’s a guessing game but scientists are pretty damn good at predicting and modeling every year and deserve a lot of thanks and appreciation.
19572,On your assumptions about having Covid: I and a family member both had a very Covid-like illness about a month before Covid was declared state side.
19573,I got it from her.
19574,We were pretty convinced we had actually already had it based on our symptoms until she had antibody test which was negative.
19575,"The point is, you can’t assume that without proper testing and factual evidence."
19576,The sooner the world is vaccinated the less likely the virus will mutate.
19577,The reason we will all be getting boosters is because it’s already mutating.
19578,The strains are becoming stronger and as a result we need more protection.
19579,If you aren’t vaccinated and you and others in your community get Covid you or those in your community could be patient zero for the next mutating strain.
19580,Um buddy I live in India and yes I know there isn't a hesitancy problem in well off areas but to claim that the entirety of India doesn't is a stretch.

19584,because of websites like this an deceptive articles put out by companies like yours
19585,Would you really rather have a decent chance of losing your sense of smell and taste for potentially months on end than get flu like symptoms for a few days?
19586,That seems like a bizarre preference to me.
19587,I know a couple of healthy people in their late teens and early 20s who got the loss of taste.
19588,What do you think normal ICU capacity is?
19589,"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the virus is spreading rampantly within schools, where strict masking and social distancing and other arrangements to minimize student contact have kept transmission in check."
19590,"Rather, the outbreaks are more a reflection of students contracting the virus outside of school, according to school officials and an expert who has tracked COVID-19 cases in schools nationwide."
19591,&gt;Public and private K-12 schools in Maine are the sites of 52 of 75 active outbreaks listed by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention this week.
19592,But school-related cases represent only 10 percent of the state’s total cases over the past month.
19593,Only one school has recorded an outbreak with more than 20 cases.

19632,"It found that symptoms such as pain or swelling at the injection site were similar in both groups of patients, but whole-body reactions, such as fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and muscle or joint pains, were more frequently reported by those who had recovered from COVID-19""

19640,"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483

&gt; CD8 T-cell responses to S-2P were detected at low levels after the second vaccination in the 100-μg dose group (Fig."
19641,S11).
19642,...is the only thing it says.
19643,It is possible the timeline for T cell production is just much longer than for antibody/B cell production.
19644,"Both mRNA vaccines seem to work in just a few days, and so protection from symptom onset kicks in around day 11."
19645,Compared to AZ where protection doesn't seem to even start until day ~30.
19646,But perhaps that then stunts the production of T cells later...
19647,Yep I stood in line for an hour or so
19648,Kaiser has both emailed and called me to get the vaccine.
19649,"It is annoying, going to wait a year before I get it"
19650,India doesn't have a vaccine hesitancy problem it's the other way round.
19651,In my city these days people are queueing up from 5am outside vaccination centres that open at 8am.
19652,Everyone wants their jab

19657,Why is it seemingly so controversial to attribute the spread of covid to seasonal patterns that we see in other respiratory viruses?
19658,"I mean, I don't deny that human behaviour plays some sort of role."
19659,"But it can't be a coincidence that the spread of covid in my country, Canada, nearly identically follows the spread of seasonal influenza."
19660,"Here people are blaming our third wave on variants, but this doesn't explain why other places where the UK variant has become dominant have not seen spikes following this occurrence."
19661,See Figure 7: [https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2018-2019/annual-report.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2018-2019/annual-report.html)
19662,Get an antibody test and you'll know if you had Covid or not.
19663,You don't have to guess.
19664,You just keep repeating that you're concerned.
19665,Concerned about what?
19666,Concerned that you'll need a booster?
19667,So what?
19668,It's free.
19669,"If you need a booster 6 months from now, you can get a booster 6 months from now."
19670,"In the meantime, you'll be contributing to herd immunity, which is a very good thing."
19671,Sure you are.
19672,Are enough UK people feeling like their depression/insanity from being locked in over the last how many months (4?)
19673,is worthwhile given your beautiful COVID numbers now?
19674,This one-dose AZ strategy + restriction has produced some amazing results on the COVID front.
19675,Hopefully you'll see the same or better numbers a month from now after having released restrictions.
19676,I find it interesting that they think the Rockefeller family is relevant enough still to be part of a conspiracy.
19677,Well that's interesting.
19678,Tell us who is doing that?
19679,"Shit, that would explain all the demons trying to possess me then."
19680,I thought I was just pretty on the inside...
19681,I totally agree with you.
19682,This sub just loves it's singular opinon on everything related to covid.
19683,We have TONS of data showing that healthy young people are not at risk from Covid and very limited data as to the vaccine's affect on widespread groups but this sub doesn't want to acknowledge that.
19684,"I’m in a similar boat, trying to decide if the risks vs. reward makes sense to me."
19685,"I’m completely healthy, walk 5 miles a day, BUT I have a positive ANA — though no evidence of autoimmune disease."
19686,"Given there’s no long term studies on people with RNA vaccine and +Ana or autoimmune disease, I’m really hesitant."
19687,"However, I’m seeing my rheumatologist this week, to discuss."
19688,"If I didn’t have that pesky Ana I would likely have gotten it, like yesterday."
19689,I just need this to be over.

19703,Ah.

19707,Really?
19708,Federal government plans are for most adults to have a dose before July.
19709,Our supply also aligns with that
19710,I'd do it if they paid me enough.
19711,I had it in June and just lost taste and smell.
19712,"If there are any long term effects from Covid, I'm already getting them."
19713,"If you actually, seriously research it with valid sources online (as in, not anti-vax conspiracy sites, but legit sources like the CDC, medical universities, et cetera) you'll find that that the risk of everything terrible is orders of magnitude higher with covid than it is for the vaccines."
19714,It's not even remotely close.
19715,Not looking forward to this

19717,I'm In Alberta!

19723,The argument an anti-vaxxer would make would be that it isn't a microchip.
19724,It's just a way for big pharma to force one into a system of control.
19725,"You can't do XYZ until you ""top-up"" your vaccine and the idea of ""herd immunity"" gives plausible deniability."
19726,"These ""top-ups"" would become more and more frequent which could be as often as monthly or daily just like we take pills now for everything from ADHD to blood pressure."
19727,"And because they'll be able to skirt government oversight due to ""emergency status"" we will never truly know what is going into our bodies."

I think we, as a culture, need to evaluate FAR more than 'work from home Fridays'."

19740,"And the majority of the remainder are in the office 2-3 times a week, tops."
19741,Employers in any moderately competitive job market are going to find themselves at a massive disadvantage if they demand the workers who've been WFH all year return to 9/5 5 days a week.
19742,"Are they in the ""I'm waiting to see"" crowd or the ""Never"" crowd?"
19743,I was mostly referring to the never crowd being rural white republicans.

19755,God damn man this shot is rad.
19756,45 days after a positive test.
19757,You aren't positive while asymptomatic and then die suddenly 45 days later from it.
19758,Are you attempting to be funny or do actually believe that nonsense.
19759,"Life Pro just the Tip: You can vaccinated in all sorts of places, people know about places like Walgreens, CVS, etc, but even my very local mom and pop pharmacy is doing it and they were actually doing house calls for older folks to boot."
19760,I'm getting mine at Costco of all places.
19761,"So if the normal channels are still booked up, you just have to think outside the box a bit."

19764,"Like they usually do, go into work sick."
19765,"Some places, before Covid, wouldn't allow you to wear a mask as well."
19766,So you just spread it around.
19767,Here in Poland they started to train for jabs in Pharmacy that soon will be available.
19768,As well lots of volunteers are been training to start a mass vaccination program.
19769,"I don't believe so, or if I did I was asymptomatic."
19770,"Not sure if it would help, but:

1."
19771,The vaccine trials succeeded quickly mostly because the disease is spreading so fast.
19772,"Normally, it takes many years for infectious disease vaccines to prove effectiveness, because volunteers get infected at a glacial pace."
19773,Covid was spreading so rapidly that the evidence of effectiveness was generated within a few months.
19774,2.
19775,We are used to vaccine development taking decades because that's what we saw in our lifetimes.
19776,But the early vaccines were so easy that 1800's physicians who didn't really know what viruses were could develop a rudimentary vaccine within a few months of work.
19777,"Vaccine research for existing diseases is only slow because the easy problems got solved centuries ago, we are stuck with the hardest nuts to crack."
19778,"Covid is a brand-new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, we just got lucky."
19779,"If it was more like SARS1, we might still be stuck on the animal research phase."
19780,"When I look at their website, I feel like they are saying that."
19781,What would you like them to say differently?
19782,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html
19783,"There’s some sort of multi-organ inflammatory syndrome, as well as “long-haul Covid”, where symptoms seem to persists for months."
19784,"It’s a small chance, but it seems to be pretty rough for those who are getting it."
19785,That’s entirely dependent on how many people you’re around tho.
19786,A lot of people come across thousands of people a month while some people might only see a 100
19787,"Anything vaccine joke, you gotta add a /s or some disclaimer... there are literally people out there who believe things like that... and worse."
19788,It's mad times.

19796,Almost?
19797,Daily I see posts from people talking about being fully vaccinated and terrified of interacting with someone in public without a mask on.
19798,"I never checked if I had an actual fever, but I know my swollen arm was producing crazy amounts of heat, worse than a bad sunburn."
19799,My arm felt almost hot to the touch.
19800,Got shot number one 20 min ago and riding home!
19801,There were hundreds of people lined up and things were moving fast!
19802,Feeling so hopeful right now!

19820,I'm so sorry that happened to you.
19821,"I don't know if there's actual data on it (would love to see it if so), but anecdotally, I know a TON of vaccinated people now, and I don't know of one person who had a big reaction from both shots."
19822,"Some people had the bigger reaction to dose 1, most (of my circle, at least) had the bigger reaction to dose 2, but yeah - I cannot think of a single person who got slammed by both."
19823,The thing that can often be hard for people like you and me to understand is that a big portion of America was never particularly worried about getting or passing on the virus in the first place.
19824,"While you and I both understand that’s insane, the fact is we still need those people to be vaccinated."
19825,"I used to track my own spreadsheets of all the virus data and people knew that, but the only questions I ever fielded about COVID were about when the restrictions would go away."
19826,A huge contingent of America is way more worried about the restrictions  than they are the virus.
19827,"For those of us who were worried about the virus, the benefits of vaccination were obvious, but for those more worried about restrictions, between news articles that say getting vaccinated won’t stop transmission or only lasts 6 months (neither of which are true) they look at it and say “Why should I bother getting two shots that will make me feel like shit to protect me from a disease I don’t care about getting, especially if the vaccine won’t stop me from spreading it, and I have no indication that getting vaccinated will directly help make these restrictions go away?” This is why I suggest tying the removal of restrictions to the number of people vaccinated."
19828,Give people a carrot for the behavior we want.
19829,We can’t keep getting mad at them for not seeing it the same way we do instead of helping them do what society needs them to do.
19830,&gt; Yes there is.
19831,"""good data"" is randomized controlled trials."

19836,It don't get less crappy when you throw it into a magical model with AI analysis.
19837,&gt; So you speculated.
19838,Yeah you know like the folks in that study you cited.
19839,That’s really early.
19840,"India currently only has like 8% vaccinated, right?"
19841,Is uptake really low or something?
19842,Mine was handwritten by me...they gave it to me blank.
19843,See the comment above.
19844,The vaccines just eliminate the risk of death/hospitalization.
19845,You can absolutely still contract COVID if you've been vaccinated though your symptoms should be much less than if you weren't.
19846,Sick people need to stay home and *rest* so they get better.
19847,Nobody can rest when they have a hundred emails and phone calls to deal with.
19848,"All that does is cause your body more stress, so not only can you not get better, you're making yourself more vulnerable to other illnesses."
19849,I know what you mean!
19850,"It feels like the anti-maskers are *juuuust* finally starting to realize that they're loudly, baldly, boldly, showing that they do NOT give a fuck about the lives of others by not wearing a mask, and so are trying their hardest to project their own sociopathy onto others to the assuage their (possible?)"
19851,guilt by calling *caring for the lives of others other than yourself* as 'virtue signaling'.
19852,Nobody likes my joke.

19856,"got mine weeks ago even though i'm only 39.  had a stroke a few years ago... right afterward, my arms would just flail if they weren't strapped down."
19857,"well once when they werent, i flailed, hit my trach, then aspirated my blood."
19858,"that gave me necrotizing pneumonia,,, so i was eligible for the vaccine early."
19859,worth it.
19860,People should take the time they need.
19861,What they shouldn’t do is shame those who are returning to normal faster than they’re personally comfortable with.
19862,Another thing people don't mention re: Fauci is that part of his failing isn't his.
19863,"When Fauci is asked a question about how he feels/how he's acting, he's answering from the viewpoint of an 80-year-old man."
19864,Of COURSE the 80-year-old who is at inherently higher risk even post-vax is going to continue following safety guidelines closer than the average person.
19865,"It's when that answer gets interpreted/reported as ""Fauci says THIS!"""
19866,"you've suddenly got millions of people following the health and safety advice of an 80-year-old man, even if they're half a century younger than him."
19867,Every pharmacy in my area is out of stock already.
19868,And there is no wait list.
19869,"Using the word ""fearful"" instead of a less emotionally-charged word like ""cautious"" or ""wary"" is in itself misleading."
19870,"When real-world studies confirm that the vaccines almost completely stop asymptomatic spread, as we strongly suspect is the case."
19871,It could happen any day.
19872,"I think it’s important to distinguish that most Americans don’t WANT to come to work sick, they just don’t have the PTO to call off or the ability to work from home."
19873,I agree that getting folks to continue to wear masks when sick is going to be an uphill battle because of how they’ve been (insanely) politicized.
19874,"Ah yes, those nefarious teachers!"
19875,I guess theres no point to having quarantine when the people coming in are less likely to carry the virus then your own population.
19876,You can get infected with SARS-CoV-2 but not develop covid.
19877,"Your body can fight it off with the vaccine, the same as with the flu, so you never develop covid."
19878,You could still carry enough virus in your nose to infect someone else.
19879,"It seems incredibly unlikely that vaccinated people will spread covid, but the research isnt completed yet."
19880,It may also be because the virus is more airborne than anyone has admitted so far.
19881,Can only spread covid if you catch covid.
19882,Active case counts are falling in many areas or at all time lows.
19883,Even Michigan seems to be peaking now.
19884,&gt; Workplaces need to be mandated by OSHA to allow leave for necessary vaccinations.
19885,"If he doesn't have weekends off (2 days), he probably works a customer facing position which are usually hourly."
19886,It's super easy to ask for time off... but you don't get paid.
19887,Which for many people that's just as much an incentive for not calling off.
19888,"Would be nice, but I know here in MA we have more distribution capacity than vaccine."
19889,And some of use only became eligible to schedule today since MA was really focused on the more vulnerable here in the state.
19890,"While it is sad that the US can snatch up so much vaccine, countries do have an obligation to try to get the vaccine to their citizens."
19891,Any vaccine given away when there is unused capacity to distribute is denying an American their vaccine and leaving them at risk.
19892,"This is the most anti science, paranoid conspiracy crap I have seen regurgitated in this sun."
19893,Same!
19894,"I was one of the first to be wearing a mask in markets, when it was like you and 1 or 2 others."
19895,I imagine I'll probably be one of the last to stop.
19896,"Yep, I had dizziness, a fever, a headache, severe fatigue, and horrific night sweats."
19897,Lasted about 30 hours and then I gradually felt better of the course of the day.
19898,Me too but I think there's considerable overlap between people with vaccine hesitation and those that have not taken covid seriously and contracted it giving them some level of immunity
19899,Because you’re selfish and irresponsible?
19900,The pandemic isn’t over because of a calendar year.
19901,Not how that works at all.
19902,Got my second moderna shot about 18 hours ago!
19903,Slept great and so far no side effects with either dose.
19904,"Arm is a little sore, but the tetanus shot I got a few months ago hurt way more."
19905,"I read that two weeks after first dose you're over 80% protected from infection so I've been going to bars, meeting new people, and doing all kinds of fun things since."
19906,"The vaccine must work pretty well, because so far all good!"
19907,I saved all my time off the last year since it was against the law to do most fun things outside the house.
19908,"I was playing enough video games and watching enough tv as it was, so no staycation really needed."
19909,Told myself this would be over to me after vaccination no matter what politicians and bureaucrats have to say.
19910,Got all kinds of vacations lined up starting next week!
19911,I've been saying this should be all over by memorial day.
19912,Would be really nice to kickoff the mask burning parties by then!
19913,"People are growing less hesitant, but a lot of my peer group for example has only gotten their first shot or the jnj one and don't have max effectiviness yet."
19914,It kind of puts a damper on planning get togethers because no one wants to get together or go out prematurely.
19915,For my friends group at least May seems like the big shift back to normal socialization.
19916,You're misunderstanding what vaccine efficacy means.
19917,"Vaccine efficacy is not an absolute chance of catching the disease, it is the relative risk reduction to non-vaccinated individuals."
19918,Being in a high risk area just means that you'll receive efficacy data faster because there are more people in the placebo group (and vaccinated group for that matter) catching the diseases.
19919,It doesn't mean that the vaccine somehow becomes more or less effective because of greater spread.
19920,[Here's an article on it from the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21\)00075-X/fulltext).
19921,You are right that my risk exposure example is too high.
19922,I mentioned that in my post.
19923,I was using easy numbers to avoid having tiny percentages.
19924,Change the labor laws so that we don’t get fired or reprimanded for using sick days.
19925,"Until then, we don’t have much of a choice."
19926,"Well yea, that’s obvious."
19927,We got our shots.
19928,Fortunately we've got plenty of evidence that indicates that fomite transmission is so rare as to be irrelevant.
19929,Isnt that true of the others as well though?
19930,I took J&amp;J because I was in the trial.
19931,"(Placebo, so ended up getting the real thing the same day I was able to book my own appointment for Pfizer."
19932,I decided to stick with the trial but wish I had just gotten Pfizer.
19933,"Well they're heavier, so if you have them all on one side it's bad for your posture."
19934,What percentage of OH has tested positive for covid-19?
19935,"If it’s around 5-10%, then the people going to your vaccination site are pretty representative of the general public."
19936,Officially fully vaccinated-meaning 2 doses + 2 weeks.
19937,Let’s party!
19938,That's great because it's all going to waste.
19939,I hope people actually take it.
19940,"I've heard people are vaccine shopping and turning down AZ, very frustrating."
19941,"Its a cold virus, chill."
19942,Had vaccinated family members over for the first time since the pandemic began.
19943,The result?
19944,I got to listen to my sister-in-law tell me that the most of the 581k would have died anyway and that with the prevented flu deaths we actually did pretty good this past year.
19945,"No wonder I wasn't as impacted by social distancing, lol."
19946,Thanks for reading my rant!
19947,[removed]
19948,"Neat, that didn't really answer the question of why it would matter if your friend felt more comfortable wearing them."
19949,If you're a good friend you'd want them to feel comfortable.
19950,"Cool story, not getting one."
19951,As well as Millions upon millions of other Americans.
19952,I’ve always been pretty vocal about my time off.
19953,If I’m already here and something extra needs to get done that was always far easier to handle than coming in on a day off.
19954,"I worked in the automotive field and if staying late to finish up a job and helping out a customer it usually wasnt a big deal because more often than not staying an extra 1/2 usually still got me home at the same time due to traffic and then it wasn’t there in the AM allowing a fresh start, but come in on a Saturday I want scheduled."
19955,Not a chance.
19956,675 k is near an average year for heart disease these days in the US...
19957,"yeah, no, that’s never been my experience."
19958,More than one day out and a doctors note is required.
19959,"Given how expensive it is to see a doctor, and how long it takes to get an appointment, no one is going to the doctor for a basic sore throat, unless it won’t go away or get worse."
19960,"I'm not worried about hesitancy, I'm worried about apathy."
19961,Scheduling an appointment is a pain in the ass and right now there isn't much motivation for someone who isn't at risk to get vaccinated.
19962,I’m not contradicting myself and you keep posting a false narrative.
19963,"These vaccines prevent infection, not just symptomatic infection."
19964,They’re extremely effective.
19965,To add to this.
19966,Can anyone from Buffalo or another northern state near Ontario confirm if they required ID?
19967,I’m tempted to go into the US to get my vaccine.
19968,"Got pfizer #2 2 days ago, currently floored and loving it"
19969,"Yes, I've met my share of people who don't know how the world works."
19970,I don't think compromising safety for the sake of the misinformed people is the right move.
19971,What are you talking about??
19972,"I still wear masks, haven't seen my parents in over a year, and got myself fully vaccinated by late February."
19973,"People like me are exactly what is going to end this pandemic asap, so please go back to your bunker and leave us in peace."
19974,At this point i’m just waiting for my birthday 😢
19975,"Come to think of it, most of my friends got stickers for getting vaccinated."
19976,I didn’t get a damn thing!
19977,"The mask mandate ended here in Indiana on April 6th, and anecdotally I can tell you that the amount of people wearing masks in a given grocery store is about the same as before."
19978,"I think the ""throw the mask off crowd"" has been doing so this whole time."
19979,"Also, no one actually enforces the mandate here, there is a sign on the door and that is it."
19980,Local police departments declared back in April of 2020 that they were not enforcing the state mandate.
19981,it’s an infectious disease if you get it you spread it.
19982,so yeah one implies another.
19983,Why would you ever dock someone PTO if they are working from home prior to this policy?
19984,They are WORKING.
19985,Ohh yes.
19986,The 20 somethings are a bit more elusive though I’m sure given time they will come around.
19987,"It’s highly likely that most by now  know someone directly or indirectly who, unfortunately, was hit by COVID."
19988,"Also, social media is huge for that age group and perhaps have read posts from long COVIDs and aren’t so apathetic to not give a shit about their closest relatives at least?"
19989,"Hopefully, the majority won’t take too much time coming to their senses."
19990,The difference is that the people who made the decision to reopen schools under the claim that they were safe with dubious evidence actually had the power to make that call and make it happen.
19991,Random redditors are just spouting opinions.
19992,Actual decision-making processes that impact real-world things should have a higher level of stringency.
19993,BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES.
19994,We've been sending my 4yo to preschool 2 days a week all year.
19995,"His school has had a single case, his teacher, and she was asymptomatic."
19996,No other student or teacher has tested positive.
19997,We (in my opinion) made the right call that it was worth the risk to send him.
19998,"&gt; Traveling, spending holidays with family and large groups of people, its been amazing."
19999,"See, this is all shit we used to do, and will resume doing really soon."
20000,Not sure what makes it particularly amazing besides the fact that you seem to have done so purposely knowing that others wanted to do those things but couldn’t.
20001,I probably slept upwards of 12 hours after my second dose.
20002,I felt extremely sore and achy everywhere
20003,In some places demand has sagged.
20004,That's a bad thing.
20005,"Anecdotal again, but my colleague who works at one of the Toronto hospitals had someone who was 40 years old admitted last week and it increased the average age of admission."
20006,Unfortunately almost half of the US population is ignorant religious people who will refuse to participate.
20007,This virus could be a problem for a long while thanks to their ignorance.
20008,Be sure to thank them!
20009,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnZfM5gqCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnZfM5gqCM)
20010,"I don't think I've ever had the flu, but the 5th day I came in to work pretty good, around 10am I had a weird cramp that turned into lots of stomach pains, thought it was food poisoning, went home early, was nauseous and fatigued, body aches, that evening had a fever of 100, sweating all through the night with stomach pains."
20011,"Woke up the next day and was pretty good, besides being tired."
20012,Did you feel worse after the first or second?
20013,"Well, I think most countries have suspended it until tomorrow."
20014,"Not very surprising, since J&amp;J have also suspended deliveries to the EU so it’s anyway just a tiny amount of the initial delivery."
20015,I hope the vaccine will be recommended at the EMA meeting tomorrow.
20016,"https://vaccinehunters.ca/

God speed to you good sir."
20017,"OK, so you're basing this entirely on speculation?"
20018,A cesspit of vaccinated people with great tacos
20019,The vaccine has been proven safe and effective not ‘I’m tired of this’.
20020,The way we have lived the last year is not the default human condition.
20021,The default human condition his kids playing together outside.
20022,The default condition is to turn on the showers at a national park campground.
20023,The default condition is spending time indoors with family and friends.
20024,We have a proven safe and effective vaccine.
20025,Vaccinated people should be giving liberty to live without fear based on that safe and effective data.
20026,If they can somehow see the vaccine isn’t sufficiently effective they should show it.
20027,🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻same here (even if it will not impact me directly as I’m not from there)
20028,"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6536/eabe8372

""However, because children and teenagers seed infections among adults who are more transmission efficient, we estimate that overall, school opening is indirectly associated with a 26% increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission."""
20029,We can't just stick our heads in the sand and pretend as if children are somehow completely immune and therefore don't count towards herd immunity.
20030,They absolutely count.
20031,Because if there was some giant secret outbreak at least a few kids would get sick rather than being in identifiable clusters
20032,You should be getting poked right...about....NOW!
20033,"Outdoors, probably somewhat soonish (few months)."
20034,Indoors probably will stay for a while.
20035,"I'm not so sure that they will do placebo arms for all, if any, of the pediatric trials."
20036,I believe at this points it's mostly about finding the proper dosage (durable immune response versus side effects) and assessing safety.
20037,"In addition even if they do have a placebo arm, it might be fewer than 50% -- the (adult) Novavax trial is 67% active vaccine, and is about to start crossover injections, giving 100% active vaccine."
20038,I signed up for the Pfizer pediatric waitlist and will be signing up for the Novavax pediatric waitlist when I go in for my crossover injection.
20039,"Right, just because eligibility opens up doesn’t mean that there are more shots to give."
20040,"Under normal circumstances supply would probably increase anyway, but with J&amp;J on hold I hear we’re going to have an average week."
20041,The IL issue is somewhat similar to the one I flagged.
20042,"Basically, lots of places aren't trying to get shots in arms the fastest, they are trying to get somewhat equal % uptake across the counties (or in DC, wards)."
20043,"In a scenario where demand is uneven, you end up with excess supply in some areas, and sometimes that excess supply is significant."
20044,Yup!
20045,Been preaching that mantra since we scheduled shot 1
20046,My parents unfortunately  are trumpsters.
20047,I was scared they were not going to get the vaccine after listening to his ilk and fox news 24/7.
20048,"However, they also know 5 people who died from covid; FIVE in one year."
20049,"I've encouraged them to wear masks and stay distant , etc.. this year, but I think by the 2nd person they knew died from not taking it seriously they started to take it seriously."
20050,They knew there was something to it.
20051,"They were both highly educated professionals , one in an Engineering field, so they both understand actual Science."
20052,"I don't know how they support outright lies about co-vid and still know it was deadly and killed their friends, but here we are."
20053,"They were first in line to want to sign up for the vaccine and are now fully vaccinated and still wearing masks, so   I'm glad the fox news cult hold wasn't so tight on them."
20054,Everyone's reactions have been so different.
20055,I had nothing but a sore arm for both first and second Moderna shots.
20056,And even that only lasted about 1 day.
20057,"I live in NJ and we’re having a spike in cases right now, so I get why your hesitant about going out."
20058,"I’m getting my first dose tomorrow and I’m trying to stay in the remaining six weeks till I’m fully vaccinated, with the current case numbers."
20059,"My J&amp;J shot was 2 weeks ago, so as of today I'm considered fully vaccinated."
20060,They're not hiding anything.
20061,All of the research is happening right out in the open.
20062,"Questions and hypotheses are being shared, and results are being published as they come out."
20063,"People like Fauci are doing the best they can to explain things in a way that everyone can understand, but the complexities of ongoing research can't just be boiled down into a few talking points and some exact numbers."
20064,"So when people demand exact answers, the only exact answer available for a lot of these questions right now is ""We don't know yet."""
20065,"If you really want to know all of the nitty-gritty details, you're going to have to put in some work and do the research yourself."
20066,As a guy in his mid 20's it ain't looking like i will be able to get my first shot till September (maybe even later)  Canada is really dropping the ball when it comes to rollouts.
20067,"It’s not about making masks permanent, it’s about thinking of others and wearing it when you’re sick

Which is what most of Asia have been doing for decades."
20068,The US has already vaccinated 50% of all adults as of yesterday.
20069,Your comment is ridiculously wrong.
20070,Yes for sure but also India has a population of 1.4 billion people.
20071,"I’m assuming that means that overnight, several hundreds of millions of people will suddenly become eligible."
20072,"While I know deals have been made to ramp up production and more vaccines have been approved, I would be surprised if any of this would make any difference in supplies by may 1st."
20073,"So far, from what I understood, the local manufacturers will now ramp up production by ordering more supplies and probably increase production capacity."
20074,This takes weeks or months to happen (today is April 19th already).
20075,"On the other side, the new approved vaccines don’t make them available."
20076,Russia said they would ship some Sputnik V but I didn’t see numbers (and if we look at how much they have been supplying other countries the deliveries have usually been “small” (if we compare to India’s population).
20077,"Moderna said they were too busy to look into it, and Pfizer said they wanted first a specific article in the contract that until a couple of days ago India’s government had not agreed to."
20078,I don’t remember what was JJ’s position on the matter.
20079,All I’m saying is: I hope opening up vaccination to all 18+ so soon will not create tensions and chaos if too many people for too few doses show up to centres.
20080," Another variant that recently emerged in California, United States, designated as B.1.429, contains four missense mutations in spike, one of which is a single L452R RBD mutation."
20081,The ability of B.1.1.298 and B.1.429 variants to evade neutralizing [humoral immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/humoral-immunity) from prior infection or vaccination has yet to be determined.
20082,"Excerpt from this study [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421002981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421002981)  


B.1.617 has the L452R mutation as well as a host of others."
20083,"They only lifted restrictions a week ago, so the UK was still under a very long and strict lockdown."
20084,"To get to where we are now has mainly been due to the long lockdown, every day though vaccines are doing more and more of the work"
20085,Can't find any appointments or lists for waiting in Virginia... Great start.
20086,We’ve all done it though.
20087,"With limited vacation days do you really want top take a day off to lie in bed sick, especially if its “not that bad” 

Its something that needs to change in this society."
20088,Ive been reading locally that a lot of business (Hotels and fast food) are having a really hard time finding people to work for the crap wages and benefits they are offering.
20089,So even without a $15 min wage mandate they are going to be forced to offer better wages to compete with UI and add on Gvt benefits to fill these positions.
20090,In the white collar workforce employers are going to have to deal with that people dont want to return to the commute office grind and permanent WFH is going to be a negotiating point.
20091,Because people didn't read the article and they thought it agreed with them.
20092,"I did read the article, but since kids are known to be asymptomatic carriers and older kids (middle school, high school) transmit covid at the same rates as adults, I find it difficult to believe that they can make a firm, factually based claim that covid *definitely* isn't spreading in schools unless they're regularly testing asymptomatic kids at the schools."
20093,"I don't think testing asymptomatic kids is practical, so I understand why schools aren't doing it, I'm just saying that I'm skeptical of claims that are missing key pieces of information."
20094,"A lot of the early studies that said ""Nah, covid definitely doesn't spread among kids,"" were lacking the same data, plus their methodology in the studies was kinda sloppy."
20095,"For example, some schools reported data based on theoretical policy, not real world conditions, and they included results from private schools (which are vastly different from public schools) and schools with attendance as low as 5%."
20096,"I'm not an anti science weirdo, and I do want kids to go back to school, but I think some of the claims and policies in place are super sketch and may be missing key information."
20097,"For example, in my area, the schools have made zero adjustments in their policies/practices in response to the new variants, even though we know that they've become the predominant strains in our community, and they make no distinction between elementary school children and middle/high school students who are known to transmit covid at vastly different rates."
20098,"I look at that and I'm like...guys, what are y'all doing?"
20099,1: Why would it be?
20100,2:Wut?
20101,It's really the only way to go about this without vaccine passports.
20102,"We can mental gymnastics this issue all we want but ultimately if we're trying to minimize spread and we can't single people out, the only way is to tie it to a metric."
20103,It’s also important that people who do get the vaccine and have reactions to know that it’s normal and they’re not actually dying.
20104,"If I were going about my life not expecting any bad reactions, and then suddenly spiked a massive fever and had horrible body aches, I would assume they the vaccine had actually done something horrible to me and then proceed to panic."
20105,"Thanks to stories like this, if I get a fever and body aches after the second dose, I’ll know to just take some Tylenol and sleep it off."
20106,Just drove in DC to Florida yesterday.
20107,Message signs around Columbia were advertising vaccine clinics with no appointment needed.
20108,Amazing the difference in how easy it is to get a vaccine from state to state.
20109,I'm one of those assumed shots today!
20110,wOOt wOOt
20111,&gt;  I don't understand the rush to open before we achieve that when it's so close.
20112,"I mean, I don't disagree with you."
20113,I'm not trying to rush.
20114,"Speaking for myself only, I don't want the world to be ""back to normal"" until it is absolutely safe to do so!"
20115,"But ...it's ok to be excited and hopeful, too."
20116,It's not anti-science to say you can't wait to get back to normal (although you can and have waited)
20117,I believe your scenario is wildly unrealistic.
20118,"A full 40% of the US Adult population is reluctant or refusing to get the vaccine, and we're now seeing breakthrough infections in immunized populations from US overseas variants."
20119,Memorial Day should not be lit.
20120,So many people for Bill Gates to visit 😂😂😂😂😂
20121,my hypochondriac ass would immediately fear throat cancer and probably go see a doctor and feel bad for wasting his time afterwards

20140,95% still isn't 100%.
20141,there's no fear mongering anywhere here to worry about.
20142,I just care about my kids more than you care about yourself.
20143,and that's fine - I didn't GAF about SARS when I was young and single and didn't have kids.
20144,anecdotal stories do not apply here.

20153,"Also, it's a constant news topic to discuss online."
20154,"&gt;CDC recommends that workers who have flu symptoms upon arrival to work or become ill during the day should promptly separate themselves from other workers and go home until at least 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medications, or after symptoms have improved (at least 4-5 days after flu symptoms started)."
20155,&gt;Note: Not everyone with flu will have a fever.
20156,"Individuals with suspected or confirmed flu, who do not have a fever, should stay home from work at least 4-5 days after the onset of symptoms."
20157,Persons with the flu are most contagious during the first 3 days of their illness.
20158,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/business/stay-home-when-sick.htm

&gt;The problem is, people usually only call in sick when they have a fever."
20159,"However, the recovery process for a flu is about a week and you’re still going to be couching up a lung or have a fountain of mucus from a runny nose."
20160,"At that point, you’re still contagious."
20161,The CDC disagrees with you.
20162,They say if you have a fever and it breaks for 24 hours you shouldn't be worried about spreading it.
20163,"Right only thing I got was a sore arm both times, much less sore on the second."
20164,He won’t respond to that.

20178,*
20179,Legit have 4 emails and 3 texts messaging me to schedule a vaccine.
20180,I’m already vaccinated and I have no one else I can give the appointments to!
20181,So relieved thats the case
20182,[deleted]
20183,Well it's different for everybody.
20184,My girlfriend got her vaccine months before me and she felt *great* after her second dose and had literally no side effects.
20185,"It's kind of a fun little lottery, or a box of chocolates, ala Forrest Gump."
20186,"Don't be scared, and remember they only last about 48 hours."
20187,"So no matter how bad you feel the next day, in just another day or two, you'll be right as rain."
20188,A mild cold will make you feel worse for a longer period.
20189,"My girlfriend's mom and I both had really bad and similar side effects to the second dose, vertigo, fatigue, etc."
20190,and I am diabetic and she is pre-diabetic and we both take metformin.
20191,"There could be a correlation between diabetes, metformin, and worse side effects."
20192,It's also another failure of the messaging.
20193,They stated constantly that older people are the priority to be vaccinated so hospitalizations and deaths can go down.
20194,"That is happening, so things are opening up more."
20195,Younger people are going to go out more if things are open and older people are safer.
20196,"Obviously there's going to be more younger people testing positive right now, but the messaging earlier was that it was pretty much to be expected"
20197,It really just sucks.
20198,I've found that Scott Gottlieb has been the best source of actual updates as to how we should view things.
20199,The vaccine is a wonderful science that has been studied for six months.
20200,What information do you think they are missing?
20201,That’s actually the only question I care about having answered.
20202,If the CDC can tell me what they need to learn and which studies are going to help them learn it I’ll shut up and wait.
20203,Right now we are completely blind about the data that they think they are missing.
20204,You and I could debate for a long time about default behavior post highly effective vaccine but it’s really irrelevant.
20205,I don’t care what the right answer is I just want to know the rules of the game and they will not share them.
20206,I got turned away for not being a resident of the state i wanted to get the vaccine in
20207,Make sure to stay super hydrated before bed (well all day for that matter) and take an NSAID!
20208,"I took an Advil 2 hours after my shot, and then set a reminder for another pill (1) a few hours later."
20209,I get my second Friday!
20210,Let’s goooo!
20211,Don't most primary/secondary schools still have 2+ months left?
20212,"Although I don't accept the premise (that I am fearful) of your rhetorical question, I'll give you a good faith response:

1."
20213,The vaccine only prohibits death/hospitalization from COVID; you can still contract the disease if you are vaccinated.
20214,Sure.
20215,"It's a relief I won't die from COVID, but that doesn't mean I'm chomping at the bit to go out and catch it."
20216,2.
20217,There are still A LOT of people that have not been vaccinated.
20218,Estimates range from 70-90% of the adult population needing to be vaccinated to end the pandemic.
20219,(Note: this isn't to eradicate COVID.
20220,That's no longer possible.)
20221,"That number will undoubtedly decrease as more children are eligible for the vaccine, but we aren't even close to reaching those numbers right now."
20222,"(And may not ever if the polling numbers about those who refuse to ever be vaccinated are true) And so, it seems premature to start living my life as though there is no pandemic just because I am personally, fully vaccinated."
20223,3.
20224,"Related: I live in a ""red"" area."
20225,There are A LOT of people here refusing to ever be vaccinated.
20226,"Couple this with reports that people are forging vaccine cards, and you will have to forgive me if I distrust that the people running around my local Walmart are actually vaccinated and not just taking advantage of loosening restrictions."
20227,Which is related to the points above.
20228,"Because of these people's actions, we are still going to have significant community spread here, particularly when the variants are added into the mix."
20229,So I continue to double mask in public because I don't want to get sick - even if I'm not going to die from it.
20230,4.
20231,I live in a society and (I believe) I ought to respect my impact on others.
20232,There just isn't good data on whether vaccinated individuals that contract COVID can then transmit it to others.
20233,It requires literally no effort for me to don a mask in public to protect those in my life (including my own children) who have not yet been vaccinated.
20234,Why not take such a small step to be safe until community transmission has been reduced?
20235,5.
20236,I have no problem congregating indoors with friends and family that are also fully vaccinated.
20237,But I live amongst too many selfish people to trust that I can behave the same way in public.
20238,...
20239,Yet.
20240,"I think I'm acting cautiously, not fearfully."
20241,"It has been a long year, but it has only been a year."
20242,"A blip in what is hopefully a long, fruitful life."
20243,"At the end of the day, I'm willing to put up with an absurdly small inconvenience for just a while longer to do my part to bring this to an end faster."
20244,"(Also: this is anecdotal, but the vaccine hesitant I've spoken to express hesitancy not about the efficacy of the vaccine, but about the safety."
20245,"And I'd say the safety concern relates to either the use of mRNA, which is relatively new, and/or the speed with which the vaccine was developed."
20246,"I don't know that asking people to continue to wear a mask (or not) for some undetermined, but not indefinite, amount of time changes someone's mind about the safety concern.)"
20247,This is what I don't get.
20248,It concerns me for people's mental and emotional health when they are so paranoid to think that nefarious leaders are making dastardly plans to... make people wear face masks when they don't need to.
20249,It's just such a ludicrous idea that so many people act like they actually believe.
20250,The blood clot issue would never have been dedicated in a trial.
20251,"It's just too rare to detect in a ""small"" trial of 50,000 or so people."
20252,Which also gives you an idea of how incredibly rare it is.
20253,The fact that they paused the vaccine delivery because of *one confirmed death in 7 million administered doses* (this number *could* go up but it is looking increasingly likely it will not - albeit risk in some subgroups may be higher) demonstrates how incredibly seriously vaccine safety is taken.
20254,"The US has administered over 200 million vaccines (between JnJ, Moderna, and Pfizer)."
20255,There is one death probably linked to vaccine administration.
20256,*One*.
20257,"If you're over 30, you are more likely to die *this hour* from sitting at home and having a catastrophic and unpredictable brain aneurysm than you are to die from COVID vaccine administration."
20258,"Interesting, thanks!"
20259,Not sure why you're getting downvoted.
20260,"EU is lagging behind on vaccines rather severely, not just on ""securing batches"" from manafacturers, but most importantly on having the capacity to create them independently from US and (far more recently) UK."
20261,"Lost batches, hidden batches, unfulfilled orders."
20262,It's a field day for tinfoil hatters and such.
20263,"If that's how we handle a virus that fatally targets mostly old or immunocompromised people (gross oversimplification of facts, I know), I don't even wanna know how ""we"" work against something much, much more severe than that."
20264,It's a mess.
20265,"Oh, ok. Did not know it was AZ."
20266,[deleted]
20267,Who’s saying it’s over.
20268,This is a positive sign though since based on what happened in Israel there was a surge from people letting their guard down early as vaccines were rolled out and then enough people got vaccinated that it shut down that surge and cases tanked.
20269,While cases may go back up this is a positive sign that we may have turned the corner on that last surge.
20270,"Our lives aren't that miserable for us to risk our lives in protests, and Bolsonaro still has so many supporters that he can't be ousted that easily."
20271,The word ‘essential’ is doing a lot in that first sentence but how that’s defined varies a lot from place to place and says nothing about what was open
20272,You check someone's passport for a Brazilian visa and don't let them in if they have it.
20273,It's not rocket science.
20274,and Fauci is contributed to that divineness with his quote.

20282,Just because you feel that he's lost credibility doesn't mean the public feels the same way.
20283,The issue is that nobody knows the actual number and it may be a value that is unreachable unless vaccines become mandatory.
20284,Nobody in their right mind would want to commit to a value that is currently an estimate just like we should not commit to a value that cannot be achieved.
20285,1 as well.
20286,Going to be curious to see the 2 numbers when they're published to see if we need to go in and get topped off.
20287,🤣😂
20288,Your comments are fucked you rashly name calling pig
20289,Just like they did with the war on drugs?
20290,"Is it just me or is the new anti-vax talking point ""5-year long term studies""?"
20291,"If by compromised immune system you mean that your immune response is weaker, then you are likely to have *weaker* symptoms from the shot, not stronger."
20292,"Yeah, the most vital part of all the vaccine programs is herd immunity."
20293,"How you get there matters far less, which is why all the fuss about which vaccine to take is so silly: every dose will be used in someone's arm."
20294,"If a Dane or a Norwegian won't have one vaccine or another, that vaccine dose will just end up in an African's arm instead."
20295,You're arguing semantics and talking around the subject to further your anti-social shut-in lockdown agenda.
20296,Very transparent and frankly tragic
20297,Ah-ha!
20298,The [REAL conspiracy](https://i.imgflip.com/56bunz.jpg) shows itself at last!
20299,/s
20300,What’s the difference?
20301,"I’m using an analogy to point out that your argument is:

“If I disagree with your risk taking behavior you don’t deserve medical treatment.” 

And you are selectively applying this to coronavirus because it suits your bias, but not many other medical conditions, some far more serious than corona, such as Obesity or AIDS."
20302,Its more that people don’t understand the vaccine then politics lol
20303,Can you give some examples of vaccines that had relatively few short term effects but proved to have hidden long term effects?
20304,It seems improbable to me but I'm curious what types of effects you expect to show up later that wouldn't show up in the first 6 months?
20305,"Anyone have any weird, long-lasting taste and smell problems after getting covid with very specific things?"
20306,"Not a lack of, but a changed perception."
20307,Partner and I had it in November and starting the last like three months ago I had a full week where nearly everything I ate had this foul garbage taste.
20308,"It faded away, but it stuck around enough where anything that had any kind of articifical (sometimes real) red berry scent or flavor had this weird, garbage-y taste and smell."
20309,So frustrating because strawberry is one of my favorite things.
20310,"So like strawberries, my raspberry vodka, starberry syrup in bubble tea, raspberry filling in donuts, etc."
20311,"all have this super weird, bad taste."
20312,I use strawberry shampoo and it smells like death to me.
20313,"For my partner, it's peanut butter!!"
20314,ehh??
20315,"Jokes about pb&amp;j aside, anyone else experience this?"
20316,"I can't imagine it's NOT covid related and I'm hoping that the vaccine will eventually fix it somehow cuz losing my palette for strawberry the rest of my life is sad, man..."
20317,"It does, thank you"
20318,"That's a lovely narrative but if you do the maths... Brits take an average of 1.1 journeys a day, USA has a higher population and taking 4 trips a day."
20319,Britain doesn't have the 'suburbia' that you find in the US.
20320,"https://www.bts.gov/statistical-products/surveys/national-household-travel-survey-daily-travel-quick-facts

So 328 million people taking 4 car journeys a day vs 66 million taking car 1.1 journeys per day."
20321,We would expect 328 deaths from CSVT in the US if everyone used AZN and assuming it's 1 death per million from the vaccine.
20322,"38000 annual US deaths (from the source I just looked up) from road traffic accidents, 4 journeys per day."
20323,That's 38000/4/365 = 26 deaths from the journey to get the vaccine.
20324,"326 for the vaccine, 26 for the trip."
20325,"In the UK it's 66 for the vaccine, 4 for the trip."
20326,"326/26 = 12.5

66/4 = 16.5

Almost exactly the same risk profile, the vaccine is over 10x more likely to result in death (assuming only 1 in 1 million die) than the car journey to take the vaccine."
20327,But as you note: there is no evidence of excess deaths directly attributable to vaccination.
20328,And this is probably due to use of Moderna/Pfizer which don't seem to have the same (slight) risk profile of the AZN vaccine.
20329,Which would make the car journey more risky in the US than taking a typical US vaccine.
20330,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html

(On the other hand, the UK was saying the same thing, no deaths due to vaccination, even as Norway and Germany were finding cases of CSVT."
20331,"It turns out, we had them recorded, we didn't see the pattern)"
20332,My sister is pregnant and got vaccinated.
20333,FERPA has nothing to do with the people who are actually doing the contact tracing.
20334,They identified the 20 person outbreak.
20335,I'm sure most of them were asymptomatic.
20336,There aren't larger secret outbreaks.
20337,My work did this dumbass move too.
20338,"They were all 'we can't force you to get bm vaccinated, but if you have reason you don't wish to be vaccinated talk to your supervisor about working from home indefinitely'."
20339,Made a lot of antivaccers in a few minutes for sure.
20340,"I'm not, but even if I were, laws would still apply to me and I would still not be able to go to a restaurant."
20341,"This COVID situation reaches a lot further than ""I risk to be sick""."
20342,[removed]
20343,"I agree, no denying that."
20344,I was simply offering an alternate view.
20345,"Yes, your recreation is much more important than other people’s lives."
20346,Why are we cruelly leaving you *bored* while old people get to putter around with reckless abandon!
20347,"I get you really are probably a child, but grow up."
20348,"Here in the south, less than 30% have been vaccinated and we have open appointments everywhere, available to anyone."
20349,57% of people over 65 have been vaccinated in my state.
20350,"Overall, yes I think it will fall between 50-60%."
20351,Open appointments are available even in NYC now.
20352,We are starting to hit the wall.

20354,Downvotes do not change reality.
20355,A counter argument might.
20356,Which you cannot seem to manage to formulate.
20357,A fact to which I am not in the least surprised.
20358,Disorganisation?
20359,Lack of flexibility?
20360,"For example in the UK and the US, you can get vaccinated at a pharmacy."
20361,You can't in the EU.
20362,"Allowing pharmacists to do jabs, in addition to GPs and mass vaccination centres, really speeds things up."
20363,But they won't do it...
20364,The vaccines lessen your chance of getting the virus.
20365,"But they don't ""eliminate"" your chances."
20366,"So again, please tell me how what I said was incorrect."
20367,"I think the UK has had a lot of fairly loose restrictions, which has probably contributed to the perception that it's not so bad here."
20368,"I don't suppose there are many countries that have had such a range of measure in place at once, but we've never had any of the more extreme options imposed like curfews or people being literally shut in their houses."
20369,Plus it varies.
20370,"In some cities they've been stuck like this since March of last year, while in rural areas and smaller towns it's a bit more like normal life but without the pub."
20371,"Lol, no it won't."
20372,Stop kidding yourself.
20373,Are you sure it's not three weeks from the second dose?
20374,I'm waiting that long just to dine in.
20375,"https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1384112892857905154

Good thread on the Indian B.1.617 Variant"
20376,Wait where in Canada are you from?
20377,I'm a 21 year old and I am predicted to get my first shot between Mid May and Mid June.
20378,"Ontario, BC, and Alberta have similar timelines"
20379,I don’t disagree that vaccinations and natural immunity are the endgame.
20380,I am just mentioning that people currently vaccinated need to still follow precautions until we reach low covid spread.
20381,"If not, then plenty of vaccinated people will still contract the virus."
20382,Just speaking facts.
20383,I would love to see prosecutions around this.
20384,"Not because the crime is so egregious (although counterfeiting government documents isn't okay), but because it would be really rewarding to see the *sort of people* who do this shit locked up."
20385,"Once the vaccine is fully approved by the FDA, we're going to see nearly every university in the country require it for their students."
20386,"The only possible holdouts I could see would be the more extreme Christian colleges, which make up a small percentage of the student population."
20387,This is going to be a big driver to get people in the 18-early 20s age range vaccinated.
20388,[removed]
20389,"If its true it's good to hear the negative reactions,  hiding them for some motive is not moral."
20390,Eligibility for kids isn’t due to waiting in line for adults.
20391,They’re still waiting on studies to finish to deem it safe (12+ will be first).
20392,If those studies were  already done they’d most likely be eligible right now.
20393,We also shut down a few plants that make vaccines right before this too..
20394,So... is there a risk of blood clots with the Pfizer vaccine?
20395,And what’s the blood clot “window” for J&amp;J vaccine...aka when would someone know if they’re in the clear?
20396,"I got my first dose, but I know a fair amount of people who are frustrated with trying to get the vaccine so they're just waiting it out right now."
20397,I just moved to NJ and trying to get a shot scheduled through CVS/Walgreens/Rite Aid is a pain and through the site scheduler for the rest of the state sucks.
20398,I would imagine more people would be willing to go get their shot if they could just drive to a CVS/Walgreens/Rite Aid or a mass vaccination spot and just go get their shot instead of dealing with the schedulers.
20399,Fauci says it's 'disturbing' that some people are complete morons.
20400,"&gt; We have asymptomatic patients (no fever, no cough, nothing whatsoever only slightly tired) with covid stage 3 or 4."
20401,Im so confused by this.
20402,So what is their outcome typically?
20403,Permanent lung damage?
20404,That’s a good point.
20405,"I was assuming that the opportunity was just that date, but maybe first other earlier dates filled up."
20406,Hopefully so.
20407,They should let everyone get the damn thing if they want it and have it mandatory for travelling etc in the future.
20408,"You're all in on being an asshole, huh?"
20409,Guess that tracks.
20410,Saskatchewan fellow here.
20411,The opening for 18-29 is planning to be available for that timeline too.
20412,"Jesus dude chill out, just stay an anti vaxxer."
20413,Nobody is forcing you to take the vaccine at least not yet they are.
20414,Only a matter of time before you are required to have at least one of the vaccines.
20415,"Also covid still exist, people are still getting infected and dying."
20416,Any halt of any vaccine is bad for anyone.
20417,[removed]
20418,Why do I need it?
20419,&gt;Let's assume that a gigantic number of people get their shots today.
20420,It'll probably be about the same as any day over the past few weeks.
20421,The limiting factor is supply not eligibility.
20422,My state opened up eligibility a while ago and it took me 3 weeks to get my first dose trying as hard as I could to get one ASAP so that I'd be done by memorial day.
20423,Originally it was 4 weeks out an hour from home until I managed to find a more local appointment for Pfizer therefore shaving 2 weeks off the timeline (1 by schedule and 1 by the faster second dose with Pfizer).
20424,If I was more casually waiting it's likely I still wouldn't have got in.
20425,"The higher profile vaccine sites (local health departments, and anything on vaccinefinder) are the most booked out."
20426,The warp is always there.
20427,"I mean, that's rich coming from the ""health expert"" who has recently taken to talking about gun control of all things...

Yeah Fauci, its no wonder the vaccine has become a political thing, you can thank yourself in part for it becoming that way."
20428,Meanwhile Doug Ford is uh taking his time like a douche soaking up shit
20429,fuck that sub nothing good comes from it
20430,"Yes, it is disturbing that you've used this for political gain."
20431,I remember rolling over onto my shoulder the night I got the shot and cursing immediately lol
20432,Bottled oxygen supplier.
20433,"It's great that cumulatively we are seeing a huge decrease in deaths from Covid in the UK, but pumping out Monday figures (historically the lowest figure during the week) to grab headlines and risk putting people who don't know any better in harm's way seems a bit disingenuous."
20434,"In the USA I guarantee we start seeing ""No Masks Allowed"" signs on businesses."
20435,Its not destigmatized at all if anything people are going to die fighting over masks
20436,Whole family will have their first jab by Thursday.
20437,Get mine on Wednesday.
20438,Can't wait!
20439,ohh my apologies misunderstood
20440,"I'm not sure where you're getting messaging with actual numbers from an official source, but no.....none of the rest of us are."
20441,It would probably be a good idea to understand where the 66% efficacy comes from.
20442,"It's a combination of short and long periods of time, and mild and severe outcomes."
20443,The long term protection against serious outcomes is closer to 90-95% like the other vaccines.
20444,Lol
20445,Ok but anyone that may be at risk can get the vaccine themselves.
20446,Anyone that chooses not to get the vaccine only puts themselves at risk (albeit a tiny risk if under 70)
20447,Every Canadian will be getting their first vaccine by Canada Day.
20448,I did my part.
20449,I wore the mask.
20450,I got both my shots.
20451,Now I’m protected and can’t spread it.
20452,Don’t shame me bro.
20453,"Hey, if you could, I want you to always, for the rest of your life, to wear a mask around your daughter and her around you."
20454,I don't want either of you ever seeing each other's faces ever.
20455,"I mean, masks are just a minor inconvenience right?"
20456,Should be worth it.
20457,[removed]
20458,I was rough for about fours the next day.
20459,&gt; They all have the chance to get the vaccine now.
20460,Literally today is the first day when every American adult is even eligible for their *first* shot.
20461,It takes 5 to 6 weeks after that (following the dose timetables) for full protection.
20462,Slow your roll there.
20463,"But my point is, pandemics don't work at the individual level."
20464,They never have and never will.
20465,People are extremely social and easily impressionable.
20466,"They do not need any more messaging saying that it's OK to stop wearing masks--not yet, when a lot of people haven't even had their first shot."
20467,Can I ask where in MD?
20468,I'm in northern VA trying to find shots within 60 miles...
20469,"Ahh, gotcha."

20471,&gt; If they were a little older I would have had to put them in private school so they could keep attending in person which is what many of my wife's coworkers had to do ( she works in healthcare).
20472,Or quit her career i guess.
20473,The American dream.
20474,Covid is becoming a comorbidity of willful ignorance.
20475,"Good luck...got my last Saturday, Sunday was a little rough for about four hours."
20476,Logistics are always going to be a problem.
20477,I got a text message from my state when I got eligible and it was about a 10 day wait till the next appointment.
20478,I will say the facility I went to was great.
20479,I even showed up 15 minutes early and within 5 minutes I was done.
20480,"Exactly, im in Hawaii."
20481,Got my second shot right before I left.
20482,"Wearing a mask every where, but I don’t feel scared at all."
20483,Almost every one I’ve talked to is vaccinated.
20484,Time to start enjoying our life’s again.
20485,My local hospitals are nowhere close to full.
20486,"Hospitals across the country aren't, either."
20487,"Pretending they are doesn't make people afraid, it makes them question why you're lying."
20488,"Even Michigan, which is seeing the biggest surge in the country, is only [at 80% capacity in the ICU and 70% capacity for total beds](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98159-523641--,00.html)."
20489,Teachers in my county aren’t even teaching in person so it makes no sense.
20490,I was checking multiple times a day under the phase 1b+ which I believe is when teachers became eligible as well as high risk medical conditions.
20491,Why should they have more vaccine slots available compared to others that are eligible at the exact same time?
20492,"it's basically memeing when sports announcers say ""you hate to see it"" after someone fucks up"
20493,"No dude, haha I’m not flexing my immune system, I’m giving you an example of what a normal immune system is like."
20494,"Also, how is me objectively stating my experience bragging?"
20495,"If you’re getting sick more than once every 15 months or so, then that is objectively a weaker immune system, you’re right I should’ve waited until I was on my computer to get some scientific studies instead of giving you anecdotal evidence, I’m sorry for that."

20811,"We DON'T want covid to do the same thing, when we have the power to stop it dead like we did with polio or smallpox."
20812,I think it will be fine.
20813,Also congrats on not having to worry about things like this in \~2 weeks :)
20814,I'm really not sure where you're getting your pessimism from.
20815,"Yea your region currently sucks, a perfect storm of defiance and skepticism of the ""system""."
20816,"Florida is actually a bright spot though right now, while they aren't great in terms of number of shots given respective to population, the trend is up, meaning the number getting shots each week has trended up."
20817,"NY is trending slightly down, but has given at least 1 shot to over 40% of its eligible population."
20818,And that number has slowed a bit but the number is still going up.
20819,"And good, businesses mandating vaccines is good if it gets people to stop acting like petulant children and do the right thing."
20820,I'm just saying governments are really good at implementing rules and really bad at getting rid of them.
20821,No bars to go to - they're **closed**.
20822,When a person goes for a walk at night the most likely 'close contact' will be when police gather around them.
20823,"Forbid random stops of lone individuals, and guess what - no chance of transmission."
20824,"If I was female, I would pass on AZ honestly."
20825,I really would.
20826,Why take the risk when there are safer alternatives out there.
20827,I have outdoor plumbing though and I wouldn't hesitate with AZ myself because it seems the risk for me is almost non-existent.
20828,Pfizer didn't use any Op Warp speed money for development and they were first.
20829,They are a business so it helped some cash flow having guaranteed orders  but they're a large pharma.
20830,They were always working on it.
20831,They will also make money off it after the pandemic since we're sort of stuck with it now
20832,Yeah and now he's probably lost all his rights cause people in Alaska I'm sure don't like that.

20851,If you let them get their vaccines then they *can* teach in person again... that's the goal.
20852,Parents need to get back to work.
20853,Yep.
20854,246 children are dead of covid.
20855,We've lost so many people during this pandemic that didn't have to die.
20856,"I get the point, but it lacks compassion, which we all need now more than ever."
20857,"As vaccine rates rise and a safer, normal way of life returns, these kinds of arguments are tinged in bitterness."
20858,Comment chains comparing one pile of bodies to another pile of bodies.
20859,Have we all forgotten these numbers are children?
20860,We've *all* had a hard time.
20861,A lot of us had a shitty time.
20862,It's not tough truth-telling to sit here rattling off numbers of dead kids.
20863,It's cold and callous handwaving.
20864,"Regardless of our own views and opinions about the how, why, and extent of restrictions... we can still find compassion by looking at our own experience."
20865,I think we can do better than this kind of cold calculation.
20866,"We should be discussing how to save lives, not our level of 'acceptable losses'."
20867,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
20868,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
20869,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

20873,Not quite.
20874,The statistics are lower on Mondays because fewer deaths are reported on Sundays.
20875,"Still impressive, but that's a bit misleading"
20876,"Yeah, I just worry about whole areas, like in the rural south, that stay under 50% vaccinated and have a troubling level of infections this summer."
20877,"But, it's on people to get themselves vaccinated."
20878,"Once we're at the ""everybody who really wanted one has one and you can literally walk in without an appointment today and get one"" point, I don't think you can justify society wide restrictions."
20879,You don't fit in the category of discussion here.
20880,We're talking about people who are unwilling to get you.
20881,You clearly have plans to get it.
20882,We do not hate you.
20883,No you are fine 3 weeks is the minimum.
20884,It's recommended because that's what they tested with because past experience told them they should wait at least that long and that way they get results quicker.
20885,However the max is much later
20886,"India is at 250k a day because its a country with a massive, densely packed, and poor population."
20887,"344 million people in India, roughly the population of the United States, don't have access to toilets."
20888,That's why COVID is spreading.
20889,COVID would spread in any country with those conditions.
20890,America does not have those conditions.
20891,"A third of all Americans are fully vaccinated, and more than half are partially vaccinated, which is already 85 - 95 percent effective at preventing transmission and 100% effective at preventing death."
20892,Americans are also able to social distance when necessary.
20893,None of us live in one room with a dirt floor and 10 other people.
20894,We won't get kicked back to Africa level hospital care because the worst is well over.
20895,It will be a while - my 7 year old wants to be vaccinated.
20896,I want my baby to be vaccinated but she doesn't have enough words to express any desire her self.
20897,"Best guess so far is sometime in 2022, but nobody really knows."
20898,"When babies are young vaccines typically do nothing, so there is a good argument we will never reach your point."
20899,We will have to wait to see what the trails say though.
20900,&gt; Strange you didn't mention any of those for some reason.
20901,Wonder why.
20902,Because I live in the UK and only have experience with our statutory sick pay system.
20903,The wild type first wave as easier on the young.
20904,"Now, lots of young people are succumbing to the mutant variant(s)."
20905,Conspiratorial nonsense.
20906,Why would the OR government want to artificially decrease the GDP?
20907,Why do you think people would follow the mandate if most people are vaccinated and case counts are low and in no danger of rising?
20908,How many circumstances would the mandate even apply to under those conditions?
20909,I'm vaccinated.
20910,I pretty much only need to wear my mask when I'm in stores who can't do anything if I took it off anyway.
20911,"Seriously, what's the danger here?"
20912,I just got my 2nd shot today!
20913,:)
20914,Considering this was a month ago as well I agree.
20915,The only reason this was detected was the enrollment in the covid study at A&amp;M. People seriously overestimate our variant testing here.
20916,I remember reading some scientists opinion last summer that one of the worst outcomes of the vaccines wasn't that they wouldn't work but that they worked but an extremely rare but serious event that wasn't found in the trial show up.
20917,Why?
20918,"Fuels antivax sentiment, regulatory authorities and public health have said the vaccine isn't rushed and has been tested appropriately, yet they promptly do a reverse causing chaos."
20919,"Many countries wouldn't do the risk benefit correctly, erring on the side of caution and more people would die of COVID."
20920,"Richer countries and those with more access to vaccine would pass the vaccines off to poorer countries where vaccine hesitancy is already high and it would fuel the idea of a 2 tier world, many of those in poorer countries would refuse a vaccine that isn't allowed in richer countries even though the risk benefit was clearly in favour of taking the vaccine."
20921,It's also very sad this has happened to AZ and J&amp;J who make up the bulk of the production for poorer countries.
20922,"It's all well and good the USA saying they'll stick to mRNA but of the 2 billion + doses pledged to COVAX (the main way the poorest countries get the vaccine) only 40 million are mRNA (Pfizer), AZ and J&amp;J make up over half."
20923,They literally can't not use those vaccines.
20924,I honestly think the fallout from this will set back vaccination campaigns in poor countries by decades even for unrelated vaccines.
20925,Things like Polio eradication may not happen in the next decade as expected as well as others.
20926,It is not being selfish to ask why can’t fully vaccinated people have more freedoms.
20927,Wasn’t the end game to be vaccinated and protected.
20928,If that’s not the end game then what is
20929,"That’s so cool, I was really hoping I’d get a sticker or something but nope :("
20930,Good question.
20931,I'm gonna see if I can get Drs.
20932,Lucy McBride or Monica Ghandhi to answer this during their live vaccine Q&amp;A tomorrow - See Dr. Lucy McBride's FB page if interested.
20933,"Thinking about this because I'm thinking about my friends that got the J&amp;J vaccine, particularly the immunocompromised friend who almost went blind last year because of his condition."
20934,How much does the difference in efficacy matter?
20935,"Expecting the answer to be that you have a framework for risk tolerance, and you should act in accordance with however you are comfortable.... something evidence/data/confidence/uncertainty."
20936,did you try asking your boss if you could take off an hour to get vaccinated?
20937,defending israeli occupation and settlement policy?!
20938,Could never be me
20939,"Lol, yes, it sounds silly."
20940,"But I would be genuinely happy to feel under the weather for a day or two, if that means I'm doing my part to bring us closer to herd immunity and end the pandemic."
20941,This is so disturbing to read about.
20942,India had seemed to do so well earlier in the pandemic.
20943,I hope they can get ahead of this surge in some fashion and beat this thing.
20944,"What I, and a ton of other people, want to know is what is the actual number/threshold of “enough”"
20945,Even the asymptomatic ones?
20946,I assume they suddenly become very symptomatic....
20947,"This guy is liar, i live in BC, hospital staff have been eligible since Feb."
20948,Stop making stuff up and spewing misinformation.
20949,[Here](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html) is the CDC's chart on COVID hospitalizations.
20950,They're literally a third of what they were during the January peak.
20951,Canada: We have the vaccine!
20952,"Bureaucrats: Let's put 25% of it in storage, for ""Reserve""."
20953,nobody can use them.
20954,It's fine that you're not a conspiracy theorist but you should still really get the shot ASAP.
20955,"I'd assume they are going to decide what can reopen when largely based on vaccination numbers, so we need every non-conspiracy theorist to be getting it when they can."
20956,If you're going to get it eventually then just get it now
20957,Suck it up buttercup.
20958,Your anxiety doesn't change reality.
20959,If you continue seeing your parents unvaccinated it's only a small amount of time before you get a variant that kills them anyway.
20960,"Your ""anxiety"" is actively taking away lives."
20961,"31 million infected, about 10% of those have been hospitalized at some point during their infection."
20962,The numbers are readily available to anyone with internet access.
20963,You don't think it's a big deal.because it hasn't seriously hit anyone you know.
20964,Good for you.
20965,Enjoy your bubble while it lasts.
20966,&gt;I wonder how much higher this number would have been without Brexit.
20967,"It's actually a decent question because it all depends on how belonging to the EU would have impacted the UKs decisions and supplies (For the former, different countries seem to have different strategies on e.g.whether they will use the AZ vaccine)."
20968,"One thing that seems to have worked very well was the ""12 weeks between doses"" strategy."
20969,I will openly admit that I was extremely sceptical about diverging from the manufacturers instructions  - but it seems to have had a major impact.
20970,What the fuck are you talking about?
20971,"I live in BC, hospital staff have been eligible for covid vaccine since February."
20972,&gt;While I agree with you that it would protect others why do they have to get that vaccine to protect others?
20973,"[I Don't Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59519811e4b0f078efd98440/amp)

I’m not here to convince you what to do."
20974,You said it yourself; the vaccine protects others.
20975,If that isn’t enough reason for you to get a vaccine then there is nothing I can say that will change your mind...
20976,"""Discriminatory"" would be the unprecedented wave of anti-transgender and voter suppression bills moving through state legislatures across the country."
20977,"These bills are attempting to erase transgender people, make LGBTQ people second class citizens, and deny marginalized communities the right to vote."

20980,"IDK, NY had 8300 cases Saturday, no sign of slowing down, even with more than 50% adults vaccinated."
20981,That’s some glorious malicious compliance.
20982,Because once enough people get vaccinated we reach herd immunity and can drop all the restrictions people are complaining about.
20983,We could drop them right now if a vaccine passport existed so that you could flash your id and prove you were 2 weeks post vaccine and thus didn't need to wear a mask to do something.
20984,"(well, assuming it is easy to verify the id isn't fake)

There are good reasons to fear a vaccine passport."
20985,"(paranoid, but still reasonable)."
20986,"Fear of mRNA vaccines isn't warranted anymore (it would be reasonable in January to want more data, and the other vaccines have some issues for to worry about)"
20987,Last Monday got my second from Moderna.
20988,Tuesday night I had fever but went away.
20989,Tuesday afternoon I started with fiver and headache until Thursday morning.
20990,Didn't fell 100% until Friday.

Hopefully you are right about no long term effects."
21007,Guess we will see.
21008,Take india for example.
21009,They’re getting 250k a day numbers right now.
21010,Meaning they’re looking at 25k people needing hospital beds in the future.
21011,What does that mean?
21012,America has in total about 100k hospital beds.
21013,The danger is racking up covid.
21014,Everyone needing hospital beds at the same time.
21015,Then hospitals are overwhelmed.
21016,Non covid patients go in there also get infected.
21017,Healthcare workers get infected.
21018,Hospitals collapse.
21019,And then what happens?
21020,Pregnant?
21021,Car crash?
21022,Overdose?
21023,Appendicitis?
21024,Cancer?
21025,Tumors?
21026,Organ transplant?
21027,What happens when America is kicked back to Africa level hospital care?
21028,They were planning human challenge trials on unvaccinated people so doing it on vaccinated cohorts is a step up really.
21029,The FDA EUA took a few weeks last time.
21030,It's reasonable to think both Pfizer and Moderna will receive full FDA approval by early summer.
21031,Canada started vaccinations in December.
21032,WTF happened?
21033,!
21034,Even in India from May 1!!!
21035,Absolutely fantastic news!
21036,&gt; We need less divisive language and more positivity and promotion around vaccination.

21040,[deleted]
21041,lol trump helping‽ nah
21042,I want your dad nowhere near politics.
21043,They did not say that... they’ve said that the vaccines are good for at least 6 months but there isn’t more data yet to formally conclude that they’re effective longer than that (given that the studies only started a limited time ago).
21044,More info about long term efficacy will be available as we get further from the first vaccines being given to people.
21045,"Please, please, please look into getting vaccinated."
21046,"How do you do, fellow 0-year-old?"
21047,Forgot the /s you freak
21048,Masks have been proven to drastically reduce the spread of the virus indoors.
21049,There is no outdoor mask requirement anywhere that I know of.
21050,Maybe at a festival or concert.
21051,We need to stop ALL flights that aren't absolutely essential.
21052,[removed]
21053,Doublespeak again!!!
21054,I love it.
21055,I have a funny feeling most of them were already dealing with this problem well before the pandemic anyway.
21056,Some studies have shown a longer gap potentially could be more effective.
21057,If you don't have a vacation planned or reason for needing the additional immunity sooner it's completely fine to wait 1 more week.
21058,Potentially.
21059,"She hasn't been tested yet, but I'm highly suspicious she inherited a condition that I have that is very genetic that affects connective tissue, potentially including her heart."
21060,"Also since there are so many unknowns about Covid, I just feel better if I try my best to keep her safe."
21061,"I'll relax a bit once both my husband and I are fully vaccinated (which I will be by next month woo) because if she does get sick, at least we'll be able to take care of her properly without getting sick ourselves."
21062,"Even though we know far more now than we did a year ago, I feel like everyone's still flying by the seat of their pants and I hate the uncertainty."
21063,Yeah the downvotes are flat out weird.
21064,Nobody seems to actually argue that holding on to AZ vaccines that'll never be used is good.
21065,They just don't like being told what their country is doing is obviously wrong I guess?
21066,"I'm also Canadian, but this isn't even a selfish thing as I'd be happy if they gave it to literally anyone else."
21067,"The loan deal also included Mexico which desperately needs vaccines, send it to them!"
21068,No.
21069,Because his solution happens to go along with Biden outlawing legal guns.

21087,"Bit of soreness when moving the arm, and some slight fatigue, but that's about it."
21088,Lasted not even a day.
21089,You won’t find 40+ vaccine shopping.
21090,Appointments are booked.
21091,The problem with 55+ was that they were a fairly small cohort who thought they were next in line for mass vaccination sites.
21092,That’s wrong (with other priority groups I don’t see it happening for general population under 59 for at least a month) but I heard it from several friends and neighbours.
21093,40+ is a huge cohort and most of know it’s AZ now or Pfizer/Moderna in June.
21094,That’s an easy choice
21095,&gt;The vaccines just eliminate the risk of death/hospitalization.
21096,You said this.
21097,This is flatly not true.

21109,"In mathematical terms, the R value of the virus needs to be below 1."
21110,"The R value amongst 65+ was already likely lower than 1, while 25- was likely several times higher."
21111,We vaccinated the individuals that needed it most whilst ignoring the impact on society as a whole.
21112,"A *very* ""conservative"" approach."
21113,80% capacity is no big deal?
21114,Are you serious?
21115,This is exactly why I'm so hard on the US personally.
21116,We have all the money and means but it's always so difficult to get to the part where we prove it.
21117,Is it just your region?
21118,Because from what I can see cases are down from the past 14 days.
21119,"Well the extreme short term risk seem to range anywhere from no side effects to dibilating nauseau for up to a couple days, so i would like to not risk that if at all possible."
21120,"Short-medium term risks seem to not be too bad at the moment, which is good."
21121,"Long terms risks (2+ years) are compeltely unknown at this point, and thats what i am most worried about."

21127,"Or do we need to go through the chain of getting married, new ID &amp;  my name on some papers (bills/house)?"
21128,Im hoping for some sort of answer..thanks in advance.
21129,How would anyone even prove residency?
21130,Lots of resident americans have not a single piece of id.

21132,"We just got 40+ in Ontario because boomers are playing "" choose your vaccine "" instead of taking what they get so before they expire they opened up the age group a bit.. fml lol"
21133,"yeah i think in the grand scheme of things in terms of herd immunity, hospitalizations and deaths, the people that had it before that don’t want it aren’t really the people we really have to worry about."
21134,hope you’re right and they change their mind.
21135,i had covid and was thrilled to get the shot when i could so i had peace of mind that my immunity would be as strong as it possibly could be
21136,I tell everyone to get the vaccine.
21137,Even made appointments for people when they act like they can’t find one.
21138,The data shows that people that are immune hardly spread it at all.
21139,I joined up about 12 minutes ago!
21140,"I think we can all agree there's no ""majority"" in this kind of masking debate; you're either of one persuasion or the other."
21141,"Those who lean towards Fl and Tx will remove all mandates by July 4th, while states like California will continue their masking policies until the fall, at that point handing over the reins to local health jurisdictions to craft their own rules."
21142,"Some counties may just require masking indoors in crowded packed venues, some only where proprietors aren't screening for vaccinations/negative tests, or others may decide to only implement it at sites with outbreaks."
21143,I see
21144,How do you guys deal with jealousy over friends getting the vaccine before you?
21145,"I don’t want to give too many details to reveal my location, but vaccine deployment in my area has been chaos.I am dealing with being rejected for appointments despite meeting criteria, yet friends of mine are booked in despite not being at risk at all and young and work from home because of the way the government wants to schedule the vaccines in their town."
21146,Meanwhile I go to work every day and have had 3 close calls.
21147,I’m happy for my friends but I feel despair about myself.
21148,"It isn't about being cool, it's about work doesn't stop and people need money."
21149,Also some work places will frown down at you taking a sick day.
21150,they also drill this into kids in school with attendance
21151,"Sure, they have a lot of people with immunity."
21152,"But the phrasing they ""declared herd immunity"" is strange to me."
21153,Did they in fact do that?
21154,"Are they going to continue with  precautionary measures like mask wearing, etc (assuming they ever did) or they going to just figure the vaccinated folks did the heavy lifting so they can now act in a  pre-pandemic way?"
21155,&gt;They all have the chance to get the vaccine now.
21156,No one under age 16 is elegible for vaccination yet.
21157,Who in the right mind would participate in the Olympics right now?

21175,Here in Canada the US loaned us 1.5 million AstraZeneca doses.
21176,"What’s stopping the Biden administration from loaning us another 5 million, at no cost to themselves, and earning tons of good will from Canadians?"
21177,I don’t understand why you and others posting on this topic are getting downvotes.
21178,I had a college professor who refused to reschedule an exam *on fucking 9/11*.

21180,My vaccination site has a bunch of stuff saying not to come in if you've had recent symptoms or have had a recent positive test.
21181,Is this not common?
21182,It was an example rather than actual supply.
21183,I was saying that even if supply jumped we have already done the vital part.
21184,Wrong.
21185,I mean I’m gonna get it no matter what and I appreciate the heads up I’ll probably be put on my ass
21186,"And while that isn't ideal, there's also plenty of evidence that people who have been infected are immune for some time, so they almost certainly aren't contributing to further spread."
21187,"They're also the group who is likely to get the shot later, after they've seen their friends and family get it and not growing a third arm."
21188,[removed]
21189,"The ""open to everyone above 18"" comes with a fine print - 50% of all manufactured vaccines will continue to go to Central government for 45+ while other 50% will be left as hunger games between states to bid and buy."
21190,Now when people complain about vaccine shortage the central government will be calmly pointing it back to the state governments.
21191,Strategic political move.
21192,CNN said the lead author contradicted them.
21193,That is true
21194,"I’m taking all this with a grain of salt, but would that mean those previously exposed are even more immune than those with just the vaccine?"
21195,"And I wonder how potential booster shots will be received, if those who were only exposed via vaccine will have more symptoms when (if?)"
21196,they get the boosters.
21197,It is all over the place among my friends and family.
21198,"Most of the people I know got the vaccine one way or another either through work or some health condition, or getting an ""extra shot"" somewhere or simply by lying on the application form."
21199,"I know other people that don't have it and simply haven't tried, because they're ""waiting their turn"", are nervous for whatever reason, or just did the bare minimum to register with their state or county and are waiting for their turn to come."
21200,"In my experience, if you are motivated to get a shot and are willing to plug away at different web sites and maybe drive an hour or two you should have no problem."
21201,I think people wear them on sidewalks as a courtesy but it’s not enforced.
21202,"Only in like grocery stores, for example."
21203,Only two more weeks
21204,I don’t think any choice is wrong!
21205,Getting any vaccine will help the entire planet!
21206,"K

edit: seems like I hit a nerve lolol"
21207,Yes because vaccines aren’t perfect and testing will be important until the numbers really nose dive.
21208,How could this even remotely be perceived as a bad thing lol.
21209,Well it's pretty wild that provincial governments are resorting to this.
21210,"The feds clearly failed at procuring vaccine and now the medical system is in peril because of it while any attempt to reduce strain on the medical system is met with protests, making the problem worse."
21211,That's why I really hope closer to 60-70% will be enough.
21212,Things seem to be going great in Israel and that's about where they are.
21213,"I'm totally aware that we will never eradicate this and I'm absolutely not in favor of enforcing any kind of ""zero covid"" policy - that would require an insane lockdown where people aren't allowed to leave their homes, and even then it will come back due to international travel and such."
21214,What I am in favor of is masks.
21215,Pretty much everything can go back to normal if people wear masks in public until case numbers drop when vaccinations hit a critical point.
21216,"If some people feel that's so much of an affront to their ""liberty"", they're no better than the anti-vaxxers."
21217,Same here but in Harrisburg.
21218,I think I waited 2 minutes because they were thawing more bikes.
21219,If anyone is getting the JJ shot (I don’t know if it’s been reissued or not) expect to feel like you have a mild flu for a couple days.
21220,"If you don’t get the side effects, that’s great!"
21221,"But if you do, don’t panic."
21222,"My wife and I had fevers, chills, aches, and a headache for several days after."
21223,"But I’ll take that discomfort and a few days off work over like, getting Covid."
21224,"Probably not because of politics, but that the messaging from government officials has been so non-committal."
21225,The public health people and the media have been too busy telling people all the negatives of the vaccine instead of promoting the benefits to public health.
21226,What about coronavac and Sputinik?

21237,The supply chain is doing amazing and we are at over 200 million doses administered.
21238,Uptake is high in all the critical demographics.
21239,It will take years untill some regions are vaccinated.
21240,"While no one should scream panic, taking this too lightly is not advisable."
21241,Adenovector vaccines have been developed since the 1980s.
21242,The Ebola vaccine was not the first; in fact there’s previously been a successful rabies vaccine that is fully approved for use in animals.
21243,Do you mind if I ask which university?
21244,"The only current major restriction most states have is capacity limits which are not closely enforced and masks, which again aren't strictly enforced."
21245,CNN said that blood clots haven't been reported with Pfizer and Moderna.
21246,That is false.
21247,J&amp;J was correct when it stated that they have been reported with all covid vaccines.
21248,"I'll try anything, so thank you!"
21249,His desire to save children's lives is somehow disturbing to you?
21250,"For sure, not disagreeing there and any link should be heavily investigated."
21251,I was just pointing out that the math doesn't lineup from what the Oxford paper claimed and what was seen in the 2021 database.
21252,"The cynical side of me feels like they were trying to slip in that mRNA vaccines cause CVTs almost as much as AZ vaccines, through the disguise of saying Covid's worse."
21253,For one second I thought it said vacation
21254,Fear mongering.
21255,Ignore.
21256,[deleted]
21257,It can't be fatal... Or kids would be dying like crazy lol.
21258,All that'll happen is they'll be more side effects.
21259,mRNA can't kill you.
21260,It's literally part of your body right now.
21261,Yea it’s nothing too bad but just annoyance when you wanna get work done.
21262,So I guess that’s what I’m telling myself for being on Reddit lol
21263,Come on Lebron....
21264,My co-workers 16yo son got vaccinated last week and I still haven't been deemed qualified (34yo man).
21265,"I'm plenty happy to wait my turn, I've felt no rush, but my patience is waning."
21266,"From what little I have read between the 2, Sputnik seems better."
21267,Not an expert though.
21268,Go get your shots you filthy animals
21269,"While that’s “technically true”, Pfizer and others have done studies and noticed you’re something like 80% protected a couple weeks after your first dose"
21270,"It would have saved 100,000 lives easy if it had been approved and distributed at scale by October, so ""months"" for approval and distribution against a brand-new virus would be a godsend."
21271,"""Weeks"" we could probably only realistically do if it's a new variant of something  we already have a vaccine against, using something like the abbreviated approval process for the new flu strains each year."
21272,I agree that having mRNA tech already at-scale will save tremendous amounts of time.
21273,"Hopefully we start using mRNA-based flu vaccines, so the infrastructure is already up and running next time."
21274,Just be glad you're not in a country that thought it could use EU vaccines without being in the EU.
21275,Still i am amazed at how the rollout has been in the US.
21276,I thought they missed the opportunity to place orders or soemthing like that last year.
21277,No.
21278,"After the whole incident with the swine flu vaccine, they’ve got some pretty high vaccine hesitancy."
21279,"Now imagine, if this time around they administered vaccines that they **know** has a chance of some very severe side effects."
21280,"A very low chance, but still, those side effects are most common in the demographic that is least likely to have a severe reaction to covid to begin with."
21281,"The people who should be getting vaccinated not for themselves, but for the common good."
21282,They’re the ones taking the risk with this vaccine.
21283,"If the government kept administering that vaccine to those people, knowing the risk, then the next time a pandemic comes around, very few people would trust the government when they try to get people to take the new vaccine."
21284,"Vaccine hesitancy is bad enough after the swine flu vaccine, but people say it was a fluke, a one time thing, and many are still willing to take a leap of faith and get vaccinated."
21285,But if that shit happens for two pandemics?
21286,And the government continues to administer a risky vaccine even after learning about the risk?
21287,They’d be totally and utterly fucked in the next pandemic.
21288,"Better to wait until they can get access to a vaccine that doesn’t have those side effects, at least for the demographic that doesn’t have much to gain from being vaccinated."
21289,"As I understand it (not sure which country or countries) the elderly are still getting the vaccine, and that makes sense."
21290,Yeah Moderna's second dose is rough!
21291,"Have a space heater, motrin, and lots of water!"
21292,I took off work and slept most of the day
21293,"Love this optimistic comment, and I agree."
21294,They are having an effect.
21295,Many states have just opened it up to everyone which will help a larger web to spread.
21296,Things are going to gradually get better.
21297,We're at the beginning of the end.
21298,"So Yale isn't going to be requiring masks or physical distancing this fall, right?"
21299,"If everyone's going to be vaccinated, there won't be any need for that."
21300,I just got the vaccine in NY.
21301,I live here but still have an out of state ID.
21302,I showed my ID and they didn’t bat an eye or ask for any verifying info.
21303,Ooof this doesn’t bode well for me.
21304,I’m on day 3 since the vaccine and still feel like crud.
21305,:(.
21306,Possibly you work with an unrepresentative sample
21307,this is exactly it.
21308,"currently Canada only has the most access to AZ, and our case numbers are skyrocketing."
21309,due to the age restrictions on AZ here we were seeing hundreds of appointments going unfilled and vaccines expiring due to people worried about getting the AZ shot.
21310,today they’ve lowered the age limit to 40+ and thankfully that age group has snapped up all available slots in many health units.
21311,&gt; It wasn't the aim of their study.
21312,"Exactly, and that's what CNN is reporting: J&amp;J claimed a particular study showed that blood clots had been reported, but it didn't, it didn't even consider the matter."
21313,So what CNN is reporting is correct...
