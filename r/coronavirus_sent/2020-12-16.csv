0,I guessed completely wrong on this.
1,I thought Santa was going to be extra busy delivering all those babies!
2,boo fucking hoo
3,I mean you're obviously just trying to be edgy but yes actually the government already said the vaccines will be free.
4,And you are already seeing that where the vaccine is being rolled out.
5,"As for compulsory vaccines, that isn't something many countries are considering, including down under where you live."
6,Given all of the problems with the US why do people fabricate bullshit to try to shit on america in order to sound pseudo-intellectual on the internet?
7,"Pick something real like the prison system, its well documented how fucked that is."
8,A couple of differences.
9,"First, the population of California has about double the population of Florida so you can halve that total first."
10,"Second, the people of Florida do not want to get tested."
11,They just don’t.
12,It’s not the state lagging.
13,Testing is totally free and available.
14,I live in a rural town in Hillsborough County (near Tampa) and people here literally do not believe the virus is a big deal and will not get tested.
15,"As a result, we have more unreported cases than elsewhere."
16,The percentage of tests that come back positive is lower in California than here in Florida.
17,"Third, major cities in Florida don’t come close to the population density of California."
18,Miami doesn’t come close to the density of the Los Angeles area.
19,"After that, it’s a huge drop off."
20,Other major “cities” just don’t compare to the cities in California.
21,"Fourth, there *are* restrictions in Florida, they’re just not in place by the state."
22,"For example, businesses can still be fined for not enforcing mask mandates (but individuals cannot)."
23,"Some of the larger companies, like Disney, have very strict mask and distancing restrictions."
24,"Disney successfully created and maintained the NBA bubble, as an example of how private companies are able to curb growth in a state where the virus is circulating at such high rates."
25,"I see that so far, at least 16 people have downvoted my comment on a gut dislike of the content, while simultaneously refusing to read on their own and prove me wrong."
26,Go ahead.
27,Google it for yourself and read the fine print.
28,It's not exactly hidden - it's just that nobody wants to acknowledge it.
29,"""But just because the vaccine itself is free doesn't mean you won't get a bill."
30,"Many providers can legally charge an administration fee for giving the shot to patients, according to the CDC."
31,"You can file a claim with your insurance company, however, since they're required to cover approved preventive care under the Affordable Care Act."""
32,"I could see an increase in births, if you count first born children only."
33,"Most of those who were stuck at home with their offspring 24/7 during various school closures, daycare closures, playground and extracurricular activity closures, etc., have a heightened awareness of the hardships involved, and are far less likely to try to have more kids."
34,I live in Alberta and we have some of the highest per capita testing in the world.
35,Our rate is 3.3% with 0.9% CFR
36,Then maybe they should stop trying.
37,Changing your answer every other day just breeds distrust
38,This is a really great point.
39,They can't hide data this large.
40,"There were headlines today about similar issues at CDC, wherein the Trump admin."
41,was plainly instructing top CDC officials to delete emails/records of their intentional efforts to suppress information about the severity of the outbreak.
42,"I suspect we will also learn about how much more deadly this virus has been to young people than has been publicized, as is being foreshadowed at the moment by some critical analysis showing this."
43,"I think there is just too much information to hide, and Trump won't be able to shred all of it before Biden gets in."
44,"I think we don't even know the half of it at this point, but honestly only half of the country will ever care, even if there is some further damning information that gets released."
45,Was beginning to think my company was the only one that did formal parties.
46,"Ours are riiiiight below black tie, i.e."
47,"nobody bats an eye if you and your date show up in a tux and ball gown and the minimum is cocktail dress/full suit &amp; tie, and always between the 16th and Christmas."
48,That is no definition of relaxing or fun.
49,I'd still prefer a bigger bonus or more PTO but a 3-hour catered lunch on company time or knocking off mid afternoon for casual drinks/dinner is a *completely* different animal.
50,I manage a bunch of systems that require yearend closeouts and changeovers so January is my busiest month...built-in party exemption for that strategy!
51,Why would there have been a baby boom?
52,Besides the jokes it was such a stupid thing if said seriously
53,"The actual science says homemade masks reduce transmission 20-40% and face shields only 5%, and that’s all indoor."
54,There are no studies I am aware of that shows benefit from wearing any kind of mask outdoors.
55,"something you wouldn't like, i imagine

they weren't screwing around"
56,Christ already past 315?
57,"Yes, a one dose viral vector vaccine would do a lot to end the pandemic worldwide more than the first-world mRNA vaccines."
58,I am just remembering the data from the pre print on their phase I trial.
59,The antibody and NAb titers from vaccinate patients were logs lower than the same data points in the convalescent plasma panel.
60,Every other vaccine in their phase i were at least a log higher in both those data points compared to convalescent plasma.
61,This won't happen.
62,People will exploit any weakness in the system to cheat.
63,"By the time you think you've perfected it, everyone who wants a vaccine will have had one and the pandemic will be over, restrictions will be dropped."
64,"As an Oklahoma teacher, I am excited."
65,Students and staff are dropping like flies in our schools to quarantines and illness.
66,Anything that helps students and staff to safely be in school is important.
67,Same to you!
68,It’s amazing how STRONG my nails are now.
69,Still pick my cuticles so have to cut that out somehow!
70,"&gt; The United States should be frankly embarrassed that name brand N95 masks are still not readily available from US retailers

N95 masks as the ones that just so happen to be approved by the FDA."
71,Why can't we use the KN95 mask which is readily available?
72,"China has been using KN95 mask throughout their lockdowns, and their medical staff seem to be doing pretty ok."
73,"&gt;
&gt;You can say a lot about the military and those involved, but when it comes to logistics they are NOT to be fucked with."
74,I read an article a couple weeks ago about vaccines and there was a quick mention of a part Moderna needed for manufacturing their vaccine.
75,The part was on a train that got stuck in the middle of nowhere.
76,"If they didn't get the part on time, there would have been major delays."
77,"The US military sent the troops to the train and they searched the entire thing to locate it, then airlifted it to Moderna."
78,It arrived on time.
79,"The problem is a lack of funding, which has run out."
80,"Closing all restaurants is mostly ok (to me), if you pay everyone enough to stay away, along with relief to mortgages and rent."
81,"This is most of what occurred in March/April, which had a vocal complaint, but the checks quieted more people."
82,"So removing the financial assistance to business owners and employee's, they don't have a choice BUT to be open."
83,"There will always be a demand for services/goods, so these businesses are fulfilling that demand."
84,Idiots.
85,The county hospital is overrun.
86,"Yep, you're totally right."
87,Entire and significant portions of the US and world economy depend on large groups of people being able to gather together for extended periods of time.
88,"Period, full stop."
89,"Some people, especially on this sub, like to write it off as a ""boo hoo, you can't go to the Bruce Springsteen concert this year"" type situation, but people like that are either flat out dumb or are just completely ignorant as to how most economies works."

97,We all know the rich and powerful will jump their place in line and get their vaccine early.
98,Don't be surprised when it happens no matter how many times you are told it won't happen.
99,"Even if it was just the flu, you shouldn't be going to the mall when you have the flu."
100,Getting a vaccine in Alaska has nothing to do with whether or not you will have this severe of a reaction.
101,Some people may but most will not.
102,As with anything.
103,If I was told this whole thing would be over if I flew to Alaska for this vaccine I’d be there in no time flat!
104,Vaxx me!
105,Are you me???
106,I quit biting my nails after 30 years during covid.
107,It’s my biggest accomplishment in life that makes me proud.
108,Kudos to you !
109,Now the real question is how many of those masks are surgical masks and n95s
110,"I wonder how pissed Mother Nature gets when baby gazelles are eaten alive, guts first?"
111,"California’s numbers are very very scary 

LA alone reported more today than most countries"
112,"They won't need em, the police unions bribed their way to the top of the vaccination priority list in California"
113,"Daily reminder that if the average person was at least as smart as someone who browses this sub, we'd have been done with this pandemic already (or at least have it in isolated pockets)."
114,I'm only half joking when I say that everyone here should take some pride in being a little bit smarter than a shit-ton of idiots who have done nothing but make the pandemic--and our lives--worse.
115,"The real answer is that we dont usually use this type of vaccine because it needs very strict temp ranges to be kept viable, something like -94 Fahrenheit for extended shelf life and 40 for up to 72 hours during actual distribution and use."
116,The normal flue vaccine can just be kept at about 40 for up to 6 months.
117,The reason we are using this vaccine this time is because its easy to mass produce where the standard flu vaccine takes about 6 months to produce.
118,"""Among the policies that reduced fatality growth rates were **general mask mandates, mask mandates for employees, stay-at-home orders, limiting gatherings to 10 people, and closing restaurants, gyms, and parks and beaches."
119,"** """
120,"what about the prisoners who get sick and die while waiting their turn at the end of the line, how is that not cruel and unusual punishment especially when the govt."
121,has been failing to provide them with adequate PPE and social distancing etc.
122,"It's almost like masks are one of the least important factors in preventing the disease from spreading and the US fixating on them has distracted from the other, more important factors that are much harder to legislate."
123,"&gt;police unions are also a problem

I was an officer in VA, a right to work state."
124,"My union had no power, all they would have done for me is provide legal counsel if needed."
125,States where unions are stronger like NY and CA yeah they are a problem.
126,THey are problem in all lines of work in those places.
127,Blow the whistle 🗣”fweet fwoo fweet fwoo”
128,Except most of the spread is at indoor household gatherings.
129,Not any of the things listed that they’ve banned.
130,"I don't think China is buying this vaccine for itself, but rather to donate to countries that otherwise could not afford to buy the Pfizer vaccine."
131,This isn't unusual.
132,New Zealand is buying more Pfizer vaccine than the entire New Zealand population to donate to neighboring countries.
133,One year too late.
134,Tbh it’s still a conservative estimate.
135,He can’t really give a false timeline.
136,He said we could be at “relative normal” between April-July and I know it should be more narrower than that but that seems like it’s possible
137,I'm going to keep saying it because it conveys a point.
138,You can be allergic to any medication and vaccine  without knowing it.
139,They always say with every medication.
140,The nurses suffered anaphylaxis which is just an allergic reaction.
141,It could potentially be from the vaccine.
142,I’m very happy that the vaccine is finally here but realistically I do believe some people could die.
143,No one knows that yet.
144,We should always be skeptical and I think that deaths from the vaccine wouldn’t be publicized because that would change public opinion too much and people would get scared.
145,Some areas are coping better than others.
146,oh shit that's right.
147,hopefully none of the other 3 vaccine candidates fail
148,I'd be surprised if it's just chemical analysis.
149,What if it reduces edge efficacy?
150,That would be something that'd take a lot of time to test.

164,We were actually told that we would have a two week lockdown to allow hospitals not to overflow.
165,The consensus was a couple months not wait for vaccine.
166,"Yeah, Amazon would definitely get more vaccine, not just take vaccine in the name of boosting profit."
167,"The issue is money, not scare resources."
168,/s
169,A higher death rate would make it burn out much quicker.
170,One reason covid is so rampant is because many people are going out and spraying it is BECAUSE they aren’t deathly ill.

175,"They may look slick but the source data is distributed into many disparate systems, some unsupported and most full of errors."
176,How else do you explain all of this?

180,"On the bright side, we are not going to only rely on the Pfizer vaccine."

183,Glad I’m not allergic to things.
184,"Is it not arrogant to say ""follow the science"" while ignoring human social behavior?"

319,"In NJ they do, is the air somehow different here than in CA?"
320,The ONLY way to explain the most densely populated state in the country staying very low or somewhere in the middle of cases per 100k people is because masks work and it's enforced here.
321,"There are people about everywhere but they wear masks and most of my friends, family, and neighborsare being careful."
322,What I see I in states like CA and hear anecdotally from friends who live there is that people just aren't wearing masks and it's not enforced or they're doing a lot more indoor dining and things that aren't being done to the same extent here in NJ even though we can.
323,"NJ peaked at 5,091 cases per day average a week ago."
324,"Except for the early peak in April, we haven't seen numbers like that all year."
325,"Not until mid November,.which was expected, but it stayed largely the same and the average has gone down every day of the last week."
326,"Things I've done here: boardwalk, zoo, mall, arcade."
327,The indoor places had doors wide open with fans to circulate in fresh air and you weren't allowed in without a mask.
328,Store capacity caps are still enforced with lines at grocery stores to get in every day.
329,There isn't a store I can go to that doesn't enforce its capacity rules.
330,Does that happen in CA?
331,"This summer, I was at the boardwalk and ride operators were empowered to call security if someone removed their mask."
332,If you wore it to get in then took it off you were given a single warning to put it on and keep it on or be kicked out.
333,Is that happening in CA?
334,Just trying to get an idea because the media doesn't seem to do such a treat job of going into place A and place B and trying to figure out what the differences are on the ground.

365,"There's still a possibility that you can catch the virus and the vaccine has prepared your body to fight it off, but while fighting the virus gains enough of a foothold to spread to others."
366,"The effectiveness of a vaccine is measured by vaccinating a bunch of people, and then comparing the number of people who get symptoms and then test positive against the total number of people vaccinated."
367,"It's not measuring how effective it is at keeping people from testing positive, which would be the threshold needed if the goal was to measure how good the vaccine is at keeping the virus from spreading."
368,That doesn't mean that the vaccine doesn't help prevent spread.
369,"It's still helpful to have a smaller, shorter illness than a full blown infection."
370,It just means that you have to have a much higher percentage of the population vaccinated if the goal is eradication.

507,With every infection there’s a greater chance of mutation and enough mutations make it another disease.
508,Additionally the immune response to the vaccine is higher than to the virus itself so the smart thing to do is get the vaccine.
509,We also don’t know what percentage of the population is required for herd immunity.

527,And they're rushing to do another 50 million JUST of Moderna and/or Pfizer within that timeframe?
528,And you know J&amp;J getting EUA approval in February means EVERYONE will be vaccinated who can by late April at the latest.
529,"Also, there are 330 million Americans, yes... of which 75 million are children who the vaccine is not yet approved for."
530,"It'll be a LOT sooner than 12-18 months, half the country pretends it doesn't exist right now as it is, some of them don't want the vaccine and the other half are very likely not gonna last much longer on self imposed lockdown without a vaccine."

538,"They are experts in an official agency, yes, but one that was downright slow and contrarian compared to others without much good empirical justification for it, relying on guesswork instead of erring on the side of caution."
539,"And politically, and as mostly highly educated individuals and population, why wouldn't you follow international experts such as the WHO, ECDC, CDC as well?"
540,"Shouldn't they actually have more combined ""weight"" than one selection of domestic ones?"
541,"Most countries including Sweden do that when it comes to issues such as climate change, where there is broad international consensus."
542,"Scientific facts don't care for national borders and who might be considered the ""official experts"" inside of them."

584,We've been giving the flu vaccine every year and this year alone its only 52% reliable.
585,If we can't get that 90%+ like this vaccine why on earth would or should anyone believe its legit and not without long term side effects.

662,They dont give a fuck about you until.......you reach military age!
663,Will there really be any monitoring of patients getting the vaccine in the drive thru?
664,"I'm saying the ""let the anti-vaxxers get it"" is a bad argument because they'll infect people who are waiting for the vaccine."
665,Man it’s so very hard to click on the article and read the first sentence.

668,"It’s this or rock back and forth in a corner until sleep gives me a brief respite in the form of nightmares that don’t matter, as opposed to the ones that do"
669,It’s basically a religious cult.
670,Anything and everything you could possibly hope to show and explain is simply ignored.
671,It will not even be considered or heard.
672,I was able to explain to my wife how microwave ovens don’t actually make your food radioactive though.
673,Small victories...
674,I feel the exact same way.
675,I am a nurse and see the effects of COVID firsthand.
676,"However, my own children tell me that I am “ brainwashed” and refuse to listen to my pleas to wear a mask and practice social distancing."
677,Much less agree to a vaccine.
678,It’s so hurtful to me and I think it will take us healthcare workers a lot of time to recover from the trauma and scorn we have been subjected to both professionally and personally in trying to protect our community and our families
679,And that number was like 60% a few months ago.
680,It's dropping like a rock and I expect it will continue to do so and more and more people get vaccinated without issue.
681,Fauci appears to be trying to make people less likely to follow restrictions past Christmas
682,Oh I know!
683,"It was just a very important thing to verbalize, because anyone reading this needs to know that test subjects are the priority over anything and everything else."
684,"When it comes to COVID, I try to avoid ever saying absolutes because this virus has been pretty unique and has taken some unexpected turns and developed odd characteristics."
685,So my answer can only be based off of what I understand about vaccines and viruses in general.
686,This vaccine requires two injections that are 29ish days apart.
687,And it takes about 5 ish days after that to have the necessary immunity.
688,"The point of a vaccine is to have your body pre-emptively make antibodies so that when the virus enters your body, there is no delay in being able to fight it due to having to wait for antibodies to develop, they’re already made and can attack."
689,"But if someone is already sick with it, they’ve already begun making the antibodies, and by the time the vaccine is administered and effective, that person has likely already made all the antibodies they need and the vaccine doesn’t serve a purpose."
690,"This vaccine does show both a lower rate of infection and a lower severity in those who are positive, so that’s something that could be considered, that the vaccine doesn’t serve the purpose of helping fight FASTER per se,but fight better?"
691,"But again, it would take about 35 days for appropriate immunity to develop, and most people at that point are already on the mend or have developed worsening symptoms that are well past just the virus, such as a compromised resp system, or a stroke, or whatever."
692,"You’d want something that is ready to fight instantly, and a vaccine would not be that soldier."
693,I hope that makes sense?
694,But I wouldn’t be surprised if in a year we discover that the vaccine can work efficiently as a cure as well.
695,I’ve learned this year to never underestimate COVID and to never stay on a comfortable path of how it works
696,"I get that you're married and that's a hell of a commitment, but I'd have a hard time being intimate with someone so ignorant and so unwilling to even remotely care about my health."
697,We made our own bed.
698,When people don’t even have the common sense to wear a mask ( literally the least you could do) then this is exactly what happens.
699,I’m tired of telling people to wear a mask.
700,I’m just gonna shut myself inside for the winter.
701,I give up

706,I don't know if that lawsuit is defensible in court.
707,"On top of the fact that you were the one who decided to take a family vacation in Orlando, FL in a pandemic."
708,There is implicit risk in it and you accepted that risk.
709,"COVID or not, if that guy had an unrelated medical emergency and those events unfolded, it is what it is."
710,Just ask yourself if you would be doing the things you were doing if this were Ebola.
711,"If it was Ebola, how seriously would you take PPE and mitigation recommendations."
712,People are thinking of this the wrong way.
713,"Mitigation efforts are to reduce community spread, but for the abiding individual, it is to eliminate your chance of infection."
714,"People are justifying not taking mitigation efforts seriously by saying ""it's not deadly"" which is ""fine."""
715,But why half-ass it?
716,I know COVID is not Ebola but people should be treating it that way; avoid it at all costs.
717,"Avoid the mindset of, I'll wear a mask and kind of follow guidelines but if I get it, I get it."
718,It should be wear a mask and do everything possible to avoid getting infected at all costs.
719,"Medical professionals don't walk into the rooms of COVID patient's thinking I put on a mask, goggles, face shielf, body suit, gloves, second gloves, show covers, head cover and say if I get it, I get it; the expectation is to avoid it completely."

734,Then it’s just another disease we have to live with including that some will die from it.
735,We don’t shut down the restaurants for all the other diseases and we shouldn’t do it for this one at that point either.

740,That is a very good argument about FL and their hospitalizations.
741,You can make the point that CA screwed themselves for doing such a good job of flattening the curve early on.
742,"Because of that, there are a whole lot more people to infect during this spike."
743,The only problem with FL is that Desantis has done just about anything to tweak the numbers so I think that things are worse there than they appear to be on paper.

850,There are two important things.

968,"For fuck's sake man at least don't call the baby ""it"""
969,"Right, but it was supposed to be giving them time to expand that capacity."
970,As far as I can tell they didn't expand that capacity.

985,Australia's also playing the wait and watch game.
986,Yeah.
987,Back when NYC was the world epicenter the desperation for supplies was extreme.
988,People were donating N95 masks and supplies even if they had 2 or 3 at home.
989,The news had medical people basically begging for help.
990,I think they would have spent any amount of money.
991,There's still abortion.
992,Norway and Finland are way lower than Sweden also

999,"If you were Minnie the Moocher, you'd already know that."
1000,Soon is subjective.
1001,Right....by fall lol this guy is such a fucking douche fuck.
1002,"Ok so from that article alone, here's my takeaway;

-An undesirable vaccine that was found to be risky and have proven side effects that are bad has been dropped by most countries long ago."
1003,"-This vaccine is still being used in some countries, such as India (this article), because it's easier and more available."
1004,"-The use of this vaccine has still had a large net positive, since polio itself has essentially been eradicated globally."
1005,Your statement here is that there are more cases of side effects than the virus itself...but that's because vaccines have brought down the polio count drastically so it's not hard to overtake that number.
1006,That is a misleading argument.
1007,"This is a case of everything is being done as best as possible, but there will always be issues that occur that can't be helped."
1008,"There will never be a perfect solution to any disease, because not all humans are the same, but we can still do our best and bring all bad numbers as close to zero as possible."
1009,"If we do this, these awful outliers no one wants will also fall off the board drastically."
1010,It's constant restrictions and then lifting them and then putting them back on.
1011,They fail to take into account the fact that when you reopen stuff.... you're gonna have more cases
1012,"Not a scientist, but if it prevents the worst cases then covid would be an inconvenience rather than a pandemic once everyone got a shot"
1013,Gonna inject myself with some kind of vaccine jungle juice of the leftovers at the bottom of the vial.
1014,"For legal reasons, this is a joke."
1015,Nevermind this spoiled cunt.

1065,Always.
1066,What the fuck is a false statistic?
1067,Do you know what an average is?
1068,All this is saying is that today - nearly twice as many Americans died from COVID as died per the average day during the Normandy campaign.
1069,"Whether or not that is useful, it's just a comparison of averages."
1070,They aren't saying that more people died at noon today than some random noon hour during the Normandy campaign.
1071,"If you want a salient daily specific, 20+% more Americans died today that 9/11."
1072,Yes.
1073,It’s begun.
1074,"Will keep ramping up and up and then we can add a Christmas and New Years wave 3rd week of Jan, and boom."
1075,First to second week of Feb the real exponential wave hits the US.
1076,(Feel free to set a reminder.
1077,This is far too predicable.)
1078,"If we are not shut down (I mean full lock down) by then, I have no words for what we will witness."
1079,"And then we have the “long Covid” waves upon waves growing each month of all those with long-term issues like brain, organ, or blood vessel damage."
1080,Unsure how the health care system is going to handle all of this later in 2021.
1081,There’s still plenty of people who need non-Covid healthcare that are going to be directly impacted as well.
1082,"God speed to everyone, especially those who are staying on top of all of this and know what we are headed towards."
1083,Gut wrenching to watch.

1131,But mostly instacart.
1132,But what is happening in the Midwest?
1133,I thought after Thanksgiving we would see people in parking lots of hospitals suffering and dying while waiting for care.
1134,Where I live in Ohio I personally heard of the local hospital turning ambulances away on black Friday.
1135,It was terrifying.
1136,But now places like Wisconsin are undeniably trending down in impossible to fake metrics like hospitalizations.
1137,Michigan too.
1138,And even Ohio seems to have plateaued in hospitalizations the last week.
1139,If it was only Ohio I’d say it was just capacity and we hit a ceiling.
1140,The downward trends make that less likely in neighboring states.
1141,I’m both exhausted and confused.
1142,I certainly don’t see better mitigation where I live than a month ago among many folks.
1143,We always seem to be screaming we are about to be overwhelmed but never quite happens.
1144,All over the US.
1145,That’s a good thing.
1146,"But for those of us trying to do our best for that not to happen at some point I can’t help but wonder why after months of hearing about it, it hasn’t happened anywhere."

1153,Also I was at at my endodontist appointment and the assistant said he'll no they are not microchipping me...
1154,So there's alot of people with that bullshit
1155,Yes but your symptoms will be less or that is the claim.
1156,"Technically, yes!"
1157,The virus is still inside you.
1158,Your antibodies are lessening the impact.
1159,It replicates slowly and will be eliminated pretty quickly.
1160,But it still replicates and is in your lungs for a paid l period.
1161,So even if you get it stay away from those who haven't been vaccinated.
1162,But you’re not sacrificing your health.
1163,You’re taking the risk of a *potential* adverse result.
1164,"&gt; especially as a young healthy low risk adult

If you agree to never go near a human that doesn’t live inside your household until the pandemic is over then fine."
1165,"Otherwise, you can spread the disease just as well as an old person with comorbidities."
1166,Well... the mRNA vaccines were made in 2 days.
1167,And now we have the equipment to have them ready for distribution after they're done being tested.
1168,So we could roll out an mRNA vaccine in like 6 months now (with a concerted enough effort).
1169,"So no, I don't think mutations are a significant threat unless that fact changes."
1170,Media.
1171,Mainstream news... the ones who refuse to cover major news until it fits their agenda?
1172,Those guys.
1173,The news.
1174,Did you read the article?
1175,I can’t understand the anti-mask messages.
1176,"When we consider the benefit-risk balance, on 1 hand we have pro-mask: almost no risk, great benefit against common respiratory diseases, on the other hand, we have anti-mask: almost no benefit, high risk against preventable transmission of respiratory illnesses."
1177,And we need to wait for “science” to push the pro-mask policy?
1178,This is why the nation is going to crap.
1179,"Nobody can be assed to get of their precious social media - Reddit, FaceBook, whatever - and go do some research about how things are really working."
1180,I'll make sure to make a detailed post tomorrow when I'm not on mobile directly citing Operation Warp Speed so I can just refer back to that in the future.
1181,"For now, if you spend half is much time ""covid administration fee"" and reading an article as you did replying to me blindly, you'd already have the information."
1182,Why do you even use the internet if you aren't going to check the simplest facts?
1183,The ironic thing is that the pharm companies said 5 billion does by the end of 2021.
1184,With 2 per person that’s 2.5 billion vaccinated individuals.
1185,350 mil Americans?
1186,330/320 something in there.
1187,60% of us would take the vaccine.
1188,WHO says it needs to be 70% to cause an effective herd immunity.
1189,And that’s iff we can secure the 500 million doses required.
1190,"The irony, by the presidents’ intentional bungling of the pandemic, we’re a hot spot first on the list for vaccine distribution!"
1191,"Although it is American arrogance that we come first, I have no doubt that the UN and the WHO want to see is vaccinated so we can stop screwing up the rest of the world."
1192,"We’ll be good by next September, I imagine."
1193,Could it have been a beta?
1194,Idk that’s why I’m asking.
1195,&gt; I'm not wearing a mask Now!
1196,"Yes, we understand many American's don't care about people other than themselves but you don't have to brag about it."
1197,this is a thing we have to do every year now?
1198,"My husband and I have 2 and were happy with that but possibly looking into having one more, especially since the little one was just getting old enough to be enrolled in preschool."
1199,But then the pandemic hit and I had to help teach a 3 year old and ADHD 6 yeah old remotely from my dining room since last March so... yeah.
1200,2 seems fine.
1201,"And at this point even if things get close to normal sometime next year, I feel like the age gap we would have preferred would already have passed, and I'm getting a touch on the older side to do the whole new mom thing again."
1202,It's hard to go back to diapers and bottles and baby food and waking up all night when everyone's potty trained and can eat regular meals with utensils without causing a huge mess and can sleep through the night.
1203,"So thanks, Corona, for putting that final nail in the coffin."
1204,I guess.
1205,You're missing the point: Fauci shouldn't be giving timeframe at all.
1206,You can't give a timeframe unless you are using all relevant data correct?
1207,"Well the scientific community is not factoring in the social and psychological aspects of this, they're giving timelines based off of what they know about the virus."
1208,"Those scientific timelines are important, but they're they're important for politicians to make decisions using that as and other things as factors."
1209,Defund the police!
1210,But also make the police enforce laws that are impossible to enforce while we limit their resources!
1211,Have our genius elected officials considered just making the virus illegal?
1212,MID fall!?!?
1213,This shit HAS to end THIS SUMMER!

1215,this is way it needs to be mandatory.

1234,"Definitely not, for the first few months only health care workers and elderly will get vaccinated, then most at risk and essential workers and then the general adult public and then kids down the road, you might have to wait until mid-2021 for this to be over"
1235,It's people like you that the anti-vaxxers are hurting
1236,They don't need to have everyone vaccinated.
1237,They just need the athletes vaccinated.
1238,"They said downs, not autism."
1239,i can think of at least 70 million people who are not going to get it
1240,[deleted]
1241,I understand your point.
1242,All I’m saying is that I’m done with this pandemic.
1243,After having to do online college for my first semester I can proudly say that I hate it.
1244,To ask for people to socially distance and wear masks (I don’t have a big issue with masks) after giving an entire year of their lives to protect elderly and vulnerable people is too much to ask.
1245,I don’t know about you but I’m not the type of person to thrive in forced isolation.
1246,"I have a life to live, and this pandemic isn’t going to stop me anymore."
1247,As soon as the vulnerable and elderly are vaccinated and the death toll plummets I’m done.
1248,You can’t ask any more from me.
1249,And I know I’m not the only one.
1250,"Again, call me selfish but trust me if you think most people in mid summer and beyond are going to care about social distancing and mask wearing you are dead wrong."
1251,Remember that reddit is a vocal minority full of hermits that for them lockdown has been the best thing they’ve ever done but in the real world most people don’t enjoy it.
1252,The 1920s also had huge wealth inequality.
1253,Only the rich were roaring.
1254,Careful.
1255,Pregnant and also breastfeeding women aren't likely to get the vaccine for quite a while.
1256,"&gt; I'm talking about social media

Yes, you're talking about social media."
1257,America is lost imo.
1258,"It's in a mental maze of its own creation, wandering around it in a coma."
1259,"Everynow and then a person finds their way through and wakes up, but the rest are still in it."
1260,That's part of it.
1261,But no one has to go to parties.
1262,No one has to refuse to wear a mask.
1263,No one has to go out to lunch with friends after being symptomatic and testing positive for covid (true story).
1264,"People have an actual choice for these things, not just a false choice of work or go hungry."
1265,In another comment you say you’ll wear a mask if you feel sick.
1266,That implies you don’t believe in asymptomatic transmission.
1267,That means you are a part of the problem.
1268,just curious.. assuming everyone literally isolated and had legit ZERO contact with no one for 1 month.
1269,what else other than covid would vanish?
1270,[deleted]
1271,I went to a courthouse in east TN a few weeks ago and the cop that took my temp at the door wasn’t even wearing a mask.
1272,The Oxford trial used either the real Oxford vaccine or a malaria vaccine (I think) so some volunteers had side-effects regardless of which one they received.
1273,That's what they said on Panorama (a BBC news program) that I just watched.
1274,If you have no assets to fight over it’s cheap

1278,2 year lockdown?

1280,Beat me to it.
1281,Good work!
1282,I would caution against assuming it’s bragging.
1283,I have been accused of that too when I merely point out facts.
1284,The US healthcare system is ridiculous BUT the vast majority of people are covered and the quality of care is good.
1285,"Yes there are uncovered people, yes we pay too much for outcomes that are no better, yes it’s not even actually capitalist as we lack price signals."
1286,But I think a lot of people make it out to be a system where half the population is going through medical bankruptcy and the other half is dying in the street.
1287,Single payer healthcare would be a big improvement.
1288,"But as an American it can get tiring to see people suggest life in America is miserable, when even poor Americans have a higher quality of life than most people in the world."
1289,"Oh I forgot about the veterinarian, right."
1290,"And then Lincoln County Mayor Bill Newman, who is a veterinarian, and whose county is doing very badly, announced that he would not mandate masks unless the holy spirit ordered him to do so."
1291,"And I thought what is with these veterinarians, but I couldn't remember who the previous one was, so thanks."
1292,"There's also been multiple chiropractors I've heard about with these positions, though I haven't kept track of the specifics."
1293,The health care trained people are really disappointing.
1294,As a person that tends to have allergies I do remain in fear of this vaccine and how many are supposedly having reactions... severe... reactions.
1295,And I'm not talking about what the media releases I'm talking about nurses on social media describing their complications with the vaccine.
1296,Is my concern warranted?
1297,Do we already have a subreddit or thread for the vaccine takers to post their stories or symptoms of the vaccine’s effects on themselves?
1298,"It would be nice to get a lot of first hand accounts of the efficacy, feelings, symptoms, anecdotes, etc."
1299,They should just make it illegal to live in cramped conditions.
1300,Problem solved!
1301,Also have our elected officials considered just making COVID illegal?
1302,Honestly I hope the new normal is wearing a mask when you're sick.
1303,Like they do in other countries.
1304,I don't want masks to disappear just because Covid is contained.

1317,"&gt; Conspiracy theories about the containers started appearing in 2007 in blogs on AboveTopSecret.com, according to a 2008 article in The Morgan County (Ga.) Citizen."
1318,"The story stated, as reported by Snopes.com, that tens of thousands of the vaults were stored on leased land in Madison, Ga., back in the 1990s by the manufacturer, the nearby Vantage Products Corp.

&gt; The paper quoted Michael Lacey, Vantage vice president of operations, as saying that when the vaults were placed on the site around 1997 or 1998, there may have been as many as 70,000 or 80,000 - but never the 500,000 that the viral email claims."
1319,"OTOH if it was left to the federal government here in Australia rather than the states we'd probably be in the crapper, with the economy being a federal resposibility and health being a state responsibility."

1361,"Here is the problem, you claimed it was a false statistic but made it sound like there was a problem related to the ups and downs of war - not that the poster didn't provide a source for the numbers."
1362,Taking an average is literally accounting for those ups and downs you spoke of.
1363,Now a statistic being false because it is based on fake numbers - obviously that's true but that isn't what you posted in any way.
1364,"For what it is worth- the original poster PROBABLY meant the Omaha beach operation, not the whole Normandy campaign."
1365,There isn't an exact known number but 104 Americans died per hour on D-Day (roughly).
1366,Over the campaign (June 6th to Aug 22) the number was closer to 10 an hour.
1367,"The point the above poster was trying to make is that today, more people died from COVID than the worst day for American casualties in WW2 (and likewise, 9/11)."
1368,Before you go calling people out on not being educated - work on how to present and back up a point.
1369,Not once did you say it was because the poster didn't source their numbers - you talked about different death rates at different times of the day (which an average takes into account).
1370,"With 556,000 cases and 8,568 deaths, Los Angeles county alone on the world scale would rank 26th for total cases, 7th in cases per million, 31st in total deaths, and 20th in deaths per million."

1661,I think though that nearly all the vaccine makers have said from day one that these initial vaccines likely won't be sterilizing that they are there to get the load off the hospital.

1760,"The public health officials in Finland stated in November (so after your first article, nice broken link to paywall btw) that both Turku and Helsinki have had handful (under 10 both, from children to elderly) of re-infections."
1761,"And considering how low our infection rate has been in total, that means it can't be ""extremely rare""."
1762,"They also stated that the actual re-infection rate is hard to determine, because not everyone gets tested and unless they happen to get different strain it's hard to prove."
1763,"The second article said ""re-infection unlikely atleast within 6 months""."
1764,"That's not long immunity, that's pathetic for seasonal disease."

1788,Thanks for taking the time to clarify.
1789,That makes a lot more sense and is something that I agree with.
1790,I think isolation is far more effective than just masks.
1791,So many people seem to think that masks are the complete answer and feel safe as long as everyone is wearing one around them.
1792,"Unfortunately, I know that although the masks help, they are not 100% effective, particularly since most are not medical grade."
1793,"They are kind of like birth control... Mostly effective, but abstinence is the only sure fire way to avoid pregnancy."
1794,"Masks are effective, but isolation is the only sure fire way to avoid covid."
1795,This site is awful.
1796,"There is no way 3% of the US population has had a ""full dose"" considering you have to wait 21-28 days (cant remember which for Pfizer) before you receive the second."

1817,"If only he loved the leaf,,,"
1818,"Ok, so that certainly is starkly utilitarian!"
1819,"And your POV has many other implications...  

For example, you could use very similar reasoning to say that someone who earned more money and was more productive in the workplace was therefore more valuable to society than someone who earned less -- regardless of what they did for a living, their internal moral compass, or the hurdles they'd had to overcome."
1820,"Think of it as not just years of earning power and contribution, but totals that could be aggregated over a shorter time."
1821,"You could also argue that someone with Down's Syndrome was less valuable, or someone with a physical handicap or chronic medical problems."
1822,"After all, they contribute less to society, and often actually need assistance, or add costs to accommodate them."
1823,"Criminals, of course, aren't very valuable at all by this measure (although unfortunately we frequently don't get a chance to imprison most white collar criminals, so it's hard to pick them out of a bunch)."

1894,&gt;Because the narcissistic leaders don’t care about the people any longer.
1895,People need to stop with the mythologized version of the American past where COVID wouldn't have destroyed us from our leader's narcissism.
1896,Like the very first thing the country did after becoming a country was when the founding fathers - the ones mythologized as the *best* leaders - refused to pay thousands of soldiers who fought in the war and then imprisoned them for not making debt payments.
1897,"That's, like, alongside the slavery and genocide thing which was ongoing as well."
1898,In what era of American history *wouldn't* this have happened in?
1899,During the honorable WWII time when American soldiers were being sent to die just to protect US colonies in the Pacific and Japanese citizens were all being locked in concentration camps?
1900,"Give me a break, COVID would have broken us even worse then than it did now."
1901,Right now there is limited hard data on if those vaccinated can spread the virus.
1902,That said there are a couple pieces of evidence that strongly hint that those who are vaccinated spread the virus at significantly reduced levels.
1903,1.
1904,In the Moderna trial all participants were tested for the virus at the time of their second dose.
1905,They found  roughly 65% fewer cases in the vaccine group than in the placebo group.
1906,Thus indicating that those who are vaccinated have a much lower chance of getting any level of infection.
1907,Further we know the second dose creates a larger immune response so there is a very good chance the reduction after both doses is even greater than 60%.
1908,2.
1909,There have been multiple studies that show those with more mild symptoms spread the virus at reduced levels with asymptomatic people rarely even infecting the people they live with.
1910,Since we do know that the vaccines significantly reduce symptoms there is good reason to believe the effect will be lower spread.
1911,In the coming weeks and months analysis of vaccinated participants blood  will shed more light on if they were able to be infected at all.
1912,So we should have a definitive answer soon.
1913,Hahahahaha!
1914,"Hi, Mom!"

1926,I find it hard to believe this is going to be an all or nothing vaccine.
1927,"Immune system retains some recognition of the previous mutation, so I think the vaccine will not be anything spectacularly good or terrible."
1928,It will be just enough to tame the virus down to something less deadly.
1929,"Once it is more on par with flu after this first round of vaccines, people will want to get back to normal asap."
1930,"I could be wrong, but this is what I foresee."
1931,"Indeed it was, but nobody says France, Britain, Russia, the U.S., or Japan lost World War I."

1948,I don't want to deal with any of that.

1975,"In such situations, the outsiders who aren't adverse to taking risks are likely to offer more drastic solutions than the insiders who were chosen specifically because of their risk adverse nature."
1976,"The key is to have people in government willing to listen to both sides, and make a call that could seem very risky to the ""conservative"" types, but is absolutely necessary given the situation."

1984,Look at all the countries that were hit hard back in spring.
1985,Now look at the ones hit hard now.
1986,"Every single one that has had both a big first wave and a big second wave, believed they would not be hit by a big second wave."
1987,Why is this considered a negative thing ?
1988,Less kids born into poverty and less people to grow up using up depleting resources sounds like a good thing to me...
1989,It takes a real piece of shit to make up false information about a vaccine during a pandemic.
1990,"I hope when we are all vaccinated and Corona is just a bad memory, that these people look back at their actions and feel appropriately idiotic."
1991,Pull your glasses a little further down your nose so they are sitting on top of the mask and not super close to your face.
1992,"I understand they are safety glasses so they need to be fairly close to your face, for safety, so you have to find a good middle ground."
1993,"&gt; A person you call “male” with sex organs of a typical biological female will not be able to have children

This is not true."
1994,"Plenty of trans men never have bottom surgery, and some never even go on testosterone."
1995,"And even if you do go on T, you can still stop taking it and regain your fertility."
1996,"And although uncommon, trans men have carried children while trans."
1997,"Aside from that, imagine being a transgender man."
1998,Your desire is to live your life *as a man*.
1999,Life pre-transition - living in the wrong body and as a person you are not - was traumatic.

2003,We're talking about Covid.
2004,I don't know anything about the flu.
2005,That's exactly it.
2006,"We'll get texts and calls from people asking if we want to hang out, or if we're ""opening up and relaxing a bit more now"" and we're stunned -- why on \*earth\* would we open up more \*now\*???"
2007,Do they not read the news?
2008,"And these are otherwise intelligent, educated folk."
2009,Madness.
2010,yes of course arbitrary criteria invalidates someones argument
2011,&gt; Let's hope that this disease doesn't suddenly get bad enough to bring such a consensus about.
2012,"Because, as bad as it is, it's not plague."
2013,"That, to me, is the whole problem."
2014,"A very large minority, maybe over 40%, thinks that a disease which by and large hurts only the most vulnerable can be dealt with by sheltering those most at risk while the rest of society gets on with life."
2015,"I genuinely don't believe these are bad people for the most part (although there are some nutjobs who actually believe this is a Darwinian cleansing opportunity), they simply have a higher risk tolerance than the majority."
2016,"If this really was as bad as the 1918 flu, where young and healthy were dying at tremendous rates, there would not be nearly as much division, and it's very possible that we would actually have many fewer infected and dead overall if a supermajority agreed on a need to take drastic action to avoid it."
2017,Even with flu shots they're supposed to keep you there for 10 minutes.
2018,"It usually doesn't happen, but I've had flu shots at several different places/situations where they all told me I was supposed to stay in the building/area for 10 minutes (and I have no risk factors)."
2019,"&gt; not even 100 people

&gt; Other countries in Europe have seen numbers in the multiple hundreds

Do you even deaths **per capita**, bro?"
2020,"That kind of ""misunderstanding of the data""?"
2021,You can't compare a country with 10 million inhabitants and a crazy low population density with countries with either 4-6x its population and/or way higher population density.
2022,"And yes, Stockholm included versus other capitals and similarly sized cities."
2023,"&gt; calm, rational and scientific approach

Yet almost none of their so-called scientific assumptions have turned out to be correct and they still deny some of what has been scientific consensus internationally for at least months."
2024,"You praise being ""rational"" but your entire post reeks of emotionality, grievance and a deep-seated bias."
2025,They have a pretty comfortable geopolitical position.
2026,Sweden never lost its independence for a long time etc.
2027,Pretty much like the UK.
2028,It was literally everywhere within an hour of him posting it.
2029,Not just reddit but everywhere online.
2030,"I had never and still have never seen something of that nature (not an ad, not from a celebrity, etc) spread so rapidly and widely."
2031,"It is, Redditors are just nitpicking a harmless word again."
2032,The group that needs immunity most are people  that transfer covid.
2033,"Cashiers, medical workers, teachers, etc.."
2034,'More coverage' for an article about strip clubs?
2035,Has this bot evolved a sense of humour?
2036,"filthy commoners, mucking up the royal lines with their low class DNA

2038,[deleted]
2039,I'm saying that BigCorp evils are much more real and tangible than the threat of lawyers working pro bono and expecting to win in a court of law given shaky cases.
2040,Proving it was the workplace that gave you COVID is an already high bar.
2041,The latter is a hypothetical.
2042,The former is ... Tyson managers in a betting pool over what hourly employees of theirs are going to get COVID.
2043,Do you remember where _you_ are?
2044,Are you sure about that?
2045,"They just [started Phase 2b trials](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/curevac-starts-late-phase-clinical-trial-covid-19-vaccine), that will inform Phase 3 trials, and those would take about five months."
2046,Fall seems much more likely.
2047,"If the J&amp;J vaccine fails, we will run out of vaccines long before Curevac ramps up production, and even then, we only get enough doses for 112.5M people anyway."
2048,"If J&amp;J doesn't pan out, we effectively have no path to herd immunity in 2021."
2049,And to think Pfizer alone could provide enough doses for everyone but the EU decided not to.
2050,AFAIK J&amp;J has begun mass production of their vaccine months ago so when/if they get the OK from the FDA there should be a large amount of their vaccine available immediately.
2051,This is fucking disgusting.
2052,Afraid I don't agree with you.
2053,"I'm 100% NOT anti-vaxx, but being anything less than 100% transparent is *not* the way to go."
2054,It simply needs to be reported in an equally responsible way.
2055,What is causing these allergic reactions in people that have had no history of allergic reactions?
2056,What might be adjusted?
2057,What might be tested to make sure you won't have a reaction?
2058,"Is the Moderna formulation the same, and might it cause these same problems?"
2059,Etc.

2066,[removed]
2067,[removed]
2068,...but don’t you dare go to Church.
2069,"The issue here is that we can still spread COVID to others, people who didn't consent for us to transfer the risk to them."
2070,"I think of not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing rules as more akin to drunk driving, where the people exercising their ""freedom"" actively endanger others."
2071,"Also, it's no longer the case that most deaths are in care homes."
2072,"I work in a hospital that's currently being inundated with COVID patients and most of my patients are relatively young, usually overweight to obese men in their 40s and 50s."
2073,"&gt; few did anything to prevent what’s happening now 

many people tried, health officials, local/state politicians, scientists, health providers."
2074,"They got ignored, shunned, harassed by the public and abandoned and/or fired by their institutions if the messaging didn't fit the narrative"
2075,Too many local politicians treating this as Us vs Them instead of protecting human life got us here.
2076,"Aaaah Unidan or whatever, I wonder what they’re doing now"
2077,Because there's not a chance in hell the Irish will skip Christmas

2099,I don't think most people take medication to control fevers daily.
2100,Idk about your shitty country but over here in the shitty USA places that have instituted lockdowns and masks have seen cases skyrocket.
2101,If imagine they'd lessen if either worked.
2102,"Well atleast you admit that lock downs will only extend the ""pandemic""."
2103,I cant believe you had to explain why an 80 year old isnt being made to wait for the vaccine lol
2104,Staffing companies exist because other companies need seasonal/temporary/part-time employees.

2106,It's worth it to pay a premium to avoid that headache.
2107,[deleted]
2108,Nope.
2109,"Because the way my friends and family choose to handle their loneliness involves partying, having strangers from tinder over for sex, starting letter writing campaigns to open their church without masks and social distancing, trying to get the office Christmas party back in full, road tripping to Disney world because Disneyland is closed, and traveling abroad with a ton of friends and getting drunk."
2110,For a couple of my friends the loneliness has morphed into a refusal to wear masks and a belief in conspiracy theories.
2111,"Oh, and none of these friends and family will quarantine when exposed."
2112,Why are you spouting misinformation?
2113,It would be massive news if it was available to everyone.
2114,"Our local gp surgery were allocated 1000 vaccines and it was first come first served, people had to call up and book, like trying to get Glastonbury tickets."
2115,So it’s a case of checking what your local arrangements are I think.
2116,I'm only proposing to not give shots to teachers until after preexisting contions and elderly get shots.
2117,They can come right after that.
2118,"Thats what, maybe 2 months more?"
2119,The kids have survived this long they can survive 2 months more.
2120,Is your state open already?
2121,Mine has stayed closed this whole time.
2122,The world didn't end and and I doubt our  kids are going to do so much worst than other states when they become adults.
2123,And I completely do not agree with forcing minority kids to do something different.
2124,I mean here we have blm and when the chips fall down and our own lives are affected we don't do what's needed to support minorities?
2125,"That just seems so wrong,"
2126,"&gt; Tegnell and Sweden defenders: Don't worry folks, trust the plan, sacrificing your grandparents and the sick was worth it, herd immunity will kick in annnnny day now so put that mask away!"
2127,This is over the line; accusing people of sacrificing their grandparents (and being happy about it) is not civil.
2128,"Keep it civil, or you'll be banned."

2175,"What’s actually happening here is that for a vial to definitely contain 5 doses it actually needs to contain
5 doses
+ 5 times the amount they estimated would be lost in the worst case every time you draw some out with a syringe 
+ the estimate they have of the maximum amount that would not be removable from the vial at all (from being stuck to the wall or maybe in the corners at the top)
+ additional overfill from the uncertainty they have in their measurement and dispensing system to ensure that you never have less than the above amount."
2176,When you add all these up it’s not unreasonable that there could be a whole extra dose or two in there.
2177,"There is no reason not to use this vaccine, so the government says do it, but the company cannot guarantee a 6th dose (since if you hit all their worst case assumptions there won’t be) so they are saying 5 and sticking to it"

2183,I have a question to which I cannot even guess the answer.
2184,Why did the number of new infections in the Dakotas decreased?
2185,I try to explain myself.
2186,"Both Dakotas had very few restrictions and, as one could expect, with the end of Summer the number of infections increased rapidly, and with some delay also the number of hospitalizations and fatalities."
2187,"Since mid November, although essentially no additional restrictions have been imposed, the number of new cases started decreasing, and the number of deaths is approximately flat, or at least growing slowly."
2188,What happened?
2189,What changed?
2190,What did I miss?
2191,"&gt; If it wasn't needed, it wouldn't exist

Yeah that's a load of bull imo."
2192,"It doesn't exist because it's *necessary*, it exists as an industry because it *generates profit*, you probably feel differently, but I don't think that profitable business = good or necessary business."
2193,Staffing companies exist because they found a way to insert themselves into an existing infrastructure and extract profit from them.
2194,"The mere fact that they profit doesn't ""prove"" they are necessary."
2195,They are rent-seeking leeches.
2196,Moderna has been about the same.
2197,So not sure if operation warp speed has really effected either of their timelines.
2198,Although I wouldn’t be surprised if J&amp;J is a bit faster since these first new were literally the first mRNA vaccines ever.

2426,"\-----------

1/3 of COVID deaths are from nursing homes in just 5 states, coincidentally, those states where Governors sent COVID patients into nursing homes."
2427,Cuomo and Murphy have the highest death rate in the world in New York and New Jersey thanks to their policy of sending COVID patients into nursing homes.
2428,"They screamed that Trump would never get the USNS Comfort to NY Harbor on time, but he did."
2429,Then Cuomo didn't use it and sent it away.
2430,"Trump built a $21million Covid Facility in Red Hook, Brooklyn."
2431,Cuomo closed it without it seeing a single patient.

* Murphy in NJ: 17,750 dead
* Wolf in PA: 12,600 dead
* Whitmer in MI: 11,200 dead
* Newsom in CA: 21,000 dead

Just in those 5 states alone they killed nearly 100,000 people."
2436,Cuomo was the ringleader and knew what he was doing.
2437,"Highlighting this fact is the fact that in Pennsylvania, the Health Secretary, Rachel Levine - a trans-woman, removed their own mother from her nursing home before she sent in the COVID patients."

2450,Really all we can practically do is vaccinate the vulnerable and the voluntary.
2451,Once they're safe the fools will either rely on the devil's own luck or just get it.
2452,Once the majority are immunized and there's far less possibility of running out of beds and ventilators due to massive case loads the whole thing gets a lot less scary but I doubt we're going to see some eradication in the US where I live at least.
2453,Covid will be killing people for years to come and all we can really hope to do is protect those who want to be protected.
2454,I work in a hospital/LTC and there's plans to really encourage all but the most adamant refusers to get it.
2455,Mandating the immunization for entry into long-term care facilities is a probable thing that will increase the rate for the most vulnerable.
2456,Just my opinion on it.

2572,What *does* it mean then?
2573,I get there are some beds left but what the does the 0% actually represent then?
2574,Is that going to count as a Covid death?
2575,That's my point...
2576,Only attack the spike protein since its structure is detected to be foreign.
2577,"No protein produced in human cells have the same structure or glycosylation as the spike protein so the body knows its foreign, both in infection and vaccination."
2578,Eventually our immune cells will break down the spike proteins and display it to other cells to produce antibodies against epitopes found on the spike protein.
2579,"As that is happening the mRNA transfected spike expressing cells will be killed, either due to the immune cells or just “natural causes” of the cell being old."
2580,"Even if it is killed by immune cells, only the spike protein will induce an immune response as the rest of the dead cell’s proteins will be detected as normal and usual."

2585,"Right, and this is exactly why it should be left between the doctor and the patient for the vaccine."
2586,Why is there so much focus on a vaccine and seemingly so little focus on treatments/cures?
2587,Do the people who get covid now not matter as much as the people who may or may not get covid later and therefore need a vaccine?
2588,"We need to save lives now, we needed an Operation Warp Speed to make sure everyone who got covid would be treated with the same level of care as the president when he got it, that would certainly reduce deaths and save lives, no?"
2589,Socialized health care systems usually have long waits even in the best of times.

2627,obesity in this country has a whole lot to do with the failings of capitalism.
2628,You should probably ask your lab supervisor instead of Reddit?
2629,More like Pfizer happy to limit the supply?
2630,&gt; I just pray people can just for once this year be considerate and not travel or meet up.
2631,"You can pray for that, but deep down you know that ain't gonna happen."
2632,People will go visit friends and family like Covid doesn't exist and January will end up being the blackest page in US history.
2633,"Regardless of who is right, this is why having additional vaccines is such a huge benefit."
2634,"Moderna won't have these freezer issues and they just got recommended by an FDA panel so, assuming the same time line as Pfizer, we'll have then approved by Friday and going out by Monday."
2635,It's such a relief we have even more manufacturers on the way too from Oxford and maybe J&amp;J. I'm not worried about Pfizer in the least.
2636,Nice
2637,"&gt;&gt; March is when we're probably going to run out of Pfizer

&gt; “Run out of Pfizer” lol like they are going to stop making it

I guess you weren't paying attention: The US has only ordered 100m doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and will likely have received all of them by March."
2638,"Late last summer/early fall, Pfizer repeatedly asked if the US wanted to exercise its option to order more, but the US didn't respond."
2639,Pfizer then contracted to sell doses to other countries.
2640,"By the time the US got its head out if its ass (four months later), Pfizer had already commited its production through June, making a Pfizer vaccine gap of at least 2 months in the US."
2641,"While the US is currently trying to negotiate for more than the initial 100m doses, they haven't actually contracted for any yet."
2642,"Right now, the US will run out of the Pfizer vaccine by mid-spring, at which point the only currently-approval vaccine will be Moderna."
2643,"If J&amp;J is approved and its vaccine can reach market by March, it'll slot nicely into the vacancy left by Pfizer."
2644,"There are some more details in various parts of that, of course, but that's how things currently stand in general."
2645,Happy to help bring you up to speed!
2646,That is what J&amp;J has said themselves.
2647,It is based on the median person.

To be fair, COVID is not the only thing hospitals have to deal with."
2653,&gt;2.
2654,"They are under testing or under reporting and the real number is vastly higher

Possibly, but in an underhanded way."
2655,"Testing numbers are ""accurate"", but at the same time they are also very low due how difficult it is to get one in the first place (many prerequisites such as fever and symptoms for multiple days, or confirmed direct contact with someone who was confirmed to have it)."
2656,"When the office I worked in had an outbreak, I had to call my city's healh center several times until they booked a test time for me, almost a week after I came in contact with a confirmed and quarantined carrier."
2657,More vaccines for the ones who want it.
2658,"The vaccine is really good at making you asymptomatic so even if you get it from an anti-vaxxer, your chances of it not effecting your day to day are high."
2659,"This won't come as a shock: ""Social media users shared screenshots of text messages that said, “omg just found out my aunt dead,” and also said that the woman’s family did not want her name revealed...the posts were shared by accounts that had previously shared anti-vaccine misinformation."""
2660,Just be smart when you encounter those claims; it's certainly not going to be the last time you see them.

USFK to raise virus warning level for all areas in S. Korea amid resurgence

https://m-en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20201216011500325?section=news"
3108,Fomite spread (meaning between touched object) is not the main driver of transmission and has never even been definitively proven.
3109,[Here is a thread with additional explanation.
3110,"](https://twitter.com/niccibelli/status/1339366007492767747?s=21)

Basically, machines fill these vials, and they have variance and tolerances."
3111,"They’re purposefully overfilled to the extent that even if the machine “undershoots” its proper dose at the bottom range of its tolerance, there is still definitely enough in the vial for a dose."
3112,"There’s also extra to make sure it’s *easy* to get out of the vial, and you aren’t drawing bubbles to get the last drops."
3113,"Basically, this is by design, and not unexpected."
3114,"But it *shouldn’t* be used for planning purposes, because you may get a vial with 40% overfill or a vial with 5% overfill."
3115,"I mean you're right, which is why I am following the restrictions anyway, but damn is it hard to convince people when leadership on either side of the aisle just doesn't care."
3116,Let's just aim for summer of 2025 so we aren't disappointed if it occurs sooner.
3117,Sure its not because less than 10% rsvpd?
3118,Yay numbers!!

3129,"If we're averaging 95-100 deaths per day due to COVID come early summer, that equates to the average deaths per day from influenza in an average year."

3143,There's quite a few restaurants open in Bakersfield as of this past Saturday.
3144,Indoor and outdoor.
3145,"“A team of 10 international scientists will travel to the Chinese city of Wuhan next month to investigate the origins of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said."
3146,Beijing has been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry and it has taken many months of negotiations for the WHO to be allowed access to the city.
3147,The virus is thought to have come from a market in the city selling animals.
3148,"But the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US."
3149,President Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak.
3150,What is the aim of the investigation?
3151,"A biologist on the team travelling to Wuhan told the Associated Press news agency that the WHO was not seeking to apportion blame, but rather to prevent future outbreaks."
3152,"""It's really not about finding a guilty country,"" Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute said."
3153,"""It's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future."""
3154,Found the North Korean!
3155,"But hey, it works."
3156,"Not ""leaked,"" clearly staged and probably rehearsed before being poorly acted out."
3157,"Jesus if that's not the most obvious publicity ""leak"" I have ever seen..."

3161,Education != Child care.
3162,Thats your responsibility.
3163,"“Free”
You keep using that word..."
3164,I don’t think it means what you think it means.
3165,I think the olympics with fans will be doable.
3166,I feel like the reason the olympics struggle at all would be because Japan is just behind when it comes to vaccines
3167,Yeah and we live with other risk every day.
3168,We aren’t going to just live like this forever because someone somewhere might die from it.
3169,60k die from the flu every year.
3170,You’re welcome to hide in your house but life HAS GOT TO GO ON.
3171,I cannot do this another year.
3172,This isn’t living.
3173,It’s barely surviving at this point and there’s certainly zero joy to be found staring at a screen all day with fuck all to look forward to or plan for.
3174,"I'd question how ""natural"" this disaster is."
3175,It has human-influenced all over it.
3176,"No, I don't mean it was made in a lab necessarily, but that that we influenced its making more so than other forms of natural disasters like earthquakes."
3177,Yes and being vaccinated will ensure that your safety and those around you are far more secured than with masks alone.
3178,"Masks reduce infections by 40-70% depending on conditions and settings (population density, climate, nature of activities) but a vaccine would statistically erase the danger of Covid altogether and make normal activity in the workplace and otherwise a even more safe."
3179,it just was mid fall!

3188,"As I said, if you start with a job offer most things will be handled by the company."
3189,Break it it into smaller tasks and it does not sound as scary anymore.
3190,Put your stuff in storage and rent out your house through an agency.
3191,"Join Facebook group ""Expats in [COUNTRY]"", make a post saying you are moving in two months and need a place such and such."
3192,Local agents will contact you.
3193,"I assume you will not be moving to Somalia, every developed and middle-income country has airbnb, uber and such."
3194,People in urban areas know enough English for you to get by.
3195,Learning another language and culture is the enjoyable part about relocating.
3196,"And don't forget to pay your taxes, unlike most countries US requires you to pay US taxes even of you become a tax resident of another country."
3197,"&gt; “When you say people can’t go to restaurants, stores, churches, you’re basically forcing people indoors.”

&gt; And indoors is where the virus spreads worst, especially if people aren’t wearing masks — which authorities can’t realistically force people to do inside their home, Hagman said."
3198,"Yes, the point of restrictions is so people stay indoors in private with their *household members*, instead of indoors in public with a bunch of random strangers, [you provincial putz](https://youtu.be/e5mzRi6r6hw?t=4)."
3199,Yes!
3200,The reason they won’t use is because it hasn’t been tested at that temp.
3201,Well now you have a few thousand that hit that temp.
3202,Time to test.
3203,The vax is freely available to ex Military who meet the age criterion.
3204,Stop turning a blind eye.
3205,"And when they're covered, the Military will drop down in a heartbeat to include not only  the active, engaged, but their families and the milkman and the haircutters and the nail salons who service the military."
3206,"Remember the game here, the public is canon fodder."

3211,Let’s reqard the people at exposure risk that were the whole pandemic and are continuing to the rest of the time
3212,It is not Tedros' fault your country ignored him.
3213,The WHO had been actively trying to get your countries to act since January.
3214,They even called 2 extraordinary meeting with member nations and nobody could agree on actions.
3215,"They published warnings and technical papers on the virus and how to deal with it, with the information they had on hand."
3216,"It wasn't for lack of trying 

Even if you ignore the near-entirety of Asia that actually listened, Australia and New Zealand also listened."
3217,The problem wasn't Tedros.
3218,"When your country fails to do something, you should look to your leaders and demand to know why they are pointing the finger somewhere else  and why they havn't done anything."
3219,It be ya own counties
3220,This.
3221,They're always on a Saturday and formal.
3222,It feels forced and I would really rather use that holiday time to see friends and family.
3223,I don't think I would resent it so much if they moved it to that dead time in January.
3224,I've heard some companies host them then because there's fewer scheduling conflicts.
3225,Ten million plus illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border.
3226,"Yes, it's impossible."
3227,"Horrible timing man, sorry for your loss."

3233,Exactly.
3234,"As adults we should be able to at least hear the information that was given to us, which was that is going to probably last 12-24 months."
3235,That a vaccine would probably be 12-24 months.
3236,"They told us this but we don't like that answer so we keep asking, hoping to get a different answer."
3237,"So, sometime between February and next February."
3238,"I honestly feel like some areas in the north that don't have high vaccine compliance are going to get some real outbreaks next fall, just like this year."
3239,"Even after getting the vaccine, in going to have my eye on the local numbers in the fall, because we don't know how long the vaccine immunity lasts."
3240,"I'm not getting Covid next October because ""I didn't know it was going to wear off!"""
3241,I'm still going to be careful until we know more.
3242,I think it may be seasonal so I'm probably going to have a normal summer (minus any *large* crowds) but I'll have a watchful eye in the autumn.
3243,"&gt;We shouldn’t be shooting ppl just cause they ran from the cops

Apparently happens all the time."
3244,&gt; couldn’t follow the cops raging demands exactly the way they demanded.
3245,Just do what is asked whether you agree or not.
3246,Not a difficult thing to do.
3247,"&gt; just wear a body cam 

Many do, not cheap."
3248,"&gt; release footage more promptly 

This isn't up to the officers."
3249,We've never had common decency.
3250,Humans have always been awful to each other.
3251,"In fact, now that we have social media now is the most decent time in human history."
3252,"Yep that’s my perspective too bc no one earth even knows how this will play out, not even Fauci"
3253,This is a serious problem.
3254,Not for the reason that many are thinking though.
3255,We are constantly bombarded with potentially world ending developments in zoonotic disease.
3256,Most of the time they turn out to be nothing.
3257,Then something like COVID-19 comes along and the world is brought to its knees.
3258,Is this move to wild minks the start of a new major problem for us?
3259,I certainly don’t know.
3260,It just feels like the boy who cried wolf sometimes.
3261,"Yeah, I mean wasn't this obvious from the outset?"
3262,The next 15-30 days we'll should see a pretty steady stream of fatalities and January (even before COVID) is traditionally the month with the highest # of deaths to begin with.
3263,That said it's unlikely we're gonna see a big jump in Feb and beyond simply because of combination of vaccine deployment &amp; individuals with antibodies (those who've already had it).
3264,"&amp;#x200B;

Remember the US population is 328 mil so we'd need to see big, big numbers to 'smash thru' the 1000 level"
3265,she would have died if she caught the flu in any other year.
3266,Theses government officials really want people to have greater hatred for them and want less compliance.
3267,"The goal posts really keep moving further and further away, at this rate, they will say we have to prevent every disease in the world before we can go back to normal."
3268,Screw this.
3269,I WANT TO LIVE NORMALLY AGIAN!
3270,They have to operate to the letter of the FDA's EUA.
3271,They will not do anything not explicitly authorized until the FDA says okay.
3272,So I’ve been having trouble sleeping and I’ve gotten ~4 hours of sleep on average the past little while.
3273,"The past couple days I’ve only gotten 2-3 and so of course I feel tired right now, eyes hurt, throat is dry (didn’t drink much water I think), etc."
3274,But how can I tell the difference between fatigue and COVID?
3275,I’m supposed to be returning home from my internship soon and I want to be cautious that I don’t spread it back home.
3276,I’ve been riding public transit too which scares me.
3277,[removed]
3278,Yh and?
3279,The US has the largest population in the western world nothing new there.
3280,So plenty of countries will have a small population in comparison
3281,Meanwhile the EU bought far too few vaccines and doesn't even bother to approve them.
3282,Return to normal?
3283,You mean the “new normal” where everyone wears masks and has to tell the government everywhere they go?
3284,"Yeah both your options suck, and I won’t take a vaccine."
3285,Vaccinating healthy teachers and grocery workers in the 20-40 range age bracket won't put a dent in hospitalizations and deaths.
3286,"The article mentions that first responders and those in nursing homes go first, which is logical, but what about all the other elderly and those with pre-existing conditions who are far more likely to end up hospitalized?"
3287,"If we want to reduce hospital burden on medical staff, we need to target the populations that are most at risk, which means higher age and pre-existing conditions."
3288,"Starting with 85+ and moving down to 75, 65, 55 and so on would make more sense to preserve life and free up hospitals."
3289,"Starting with nursing homes is a good start, but we have to do more."
3290,I say this as a young educator -- my risk of getting hospitalized and/or dying of covid is incredibly low.
3291,"Family members who are 65+ are far more likely to have a bad outcome, yet somehow I get access to the vaccine first?"
3292,Doesn't make sense.

3298,Many vaccines are developed in this way and the official Catholic stance is to take the vaccine.

3421,Who tf is arguing that?
3422,I’m not sure if even r/conservative is dumb enough to argue that.
3423,Their take by now is “thanksgiving was more important than social distancing”
3424,But no one in their right mind thinks that every single citizen will get vaccinated.
3425,"For starters, there is no need to vaccinate young children, then there's the issue that people with allergies are not recommended to get the Pfizer and probably some others, then there's all the anti-vaccers or people who might otherwise not bother etc."
3426,I think 4 out of 5 would already be a good result.
3427,"And your donate the ""surplus"", do you really think that's gonna happen?"

3435,He miscalculated the true infection rate and was going off of incorrect small samples that showed higher numbers of spread early.
3436,He thought they were at 30% when they might have been at 10%.
3437,It's clear that herd immunity takes well over 50% and maybe up to 80%.
3438,Thinking you are at 30%/ and needing to hit 50% is way different that being at 10% and needing to hit 80%.
3439,That is what Sweden is realizing.

Of course they'll host it again."
3458,The problem is that it'll be *at least* another 20-30 years before it happens.
3459,"You also have to keep in mind that in that time period there will be a couple of countries that might be poor-ish right now that undergo a huge middle class boom and they'll be prime targets for bidding for the Olympics as well (ie: an African country, we've yet to see a Summer Olympics in Africa)."
3460,Getting the Olympics in the future is going to become increasingly pricier (got to grease the palms of the IOC).
3461,"If the Olympics get canceled though, I could see them getting first dips on the next slot."
3462,"2040 would be a prime target, 20 years after COVID, has a certain ""ring"" to it and plays into the kind of PR that the IOC and companies would focus on."
3463,But what about the possibility the vaccine won’t last that long for folks?
3464,We still don’t know how long this vaccine would be effective...
3465,"The UK is having about 500 deaths from 20-25K daily recorded cases, with very good testing infrastructure."

3486,True i mean with every vaccine or even medication there's a small group of people that aren't advised to get X vaccine or medication because of whatever reason.
3487,So may well be someone who probably shouldn't have the pfizer vaccine gets it and unfortunately dies.
3488,Lol
3489,&gt; An estimated 2.8 million people died in the US last year.

3498,Wtf are you on about?
3499,Do you really think Pfizer and the others are just sitting there waiting for someone to show up with the cash?
3500,They've been negotiating with the entire globe since summer.
3501,"They're ramping up production and the supply chain as fast as they possibly can, never mind who's bought what."
3502,"But it is a fact that capacity is limited, and the first doses will obviously go to the highest bidders."
3503,So what should we do instead?
3504,"Instead of buying up hundreds of millions of doses in advance, reserving capacity beyond our needs with every conceivable supplier, there could have been global coordination within the UN."
3505,"Global distribution, taking into account those that are most affected, e.g."

3512,"Also that research is obviously still happening, they just started the roll out early in tandem"
3513,You hit the nail on the head with this one.
3514,Also the state to state gathering restrictions will continue to vary and if even one of these shows doesn’t happen it could make the tour completely unprofitable.
3515,The music industry is struggling really hard right now and it is probably going to be one of the last things to resume.
3516,So 6 more years of winter.

3524,muhahahaha
3525,Especially given the fact we're first giving the vaccine to the elderly so there a chance some will die soon after but for a completely unrelated cause simply because of their old age
3526,Agreed.
3527,Especially with their stage for this tour.
3528,They have two sets of part of it.
3529,They have one leapfrog them to the next venue in order to get it set up in time.
3530,Too much moving and logistics I feel right after all of this or as we are getting over it.
3531,"Plus with a huge stadium tour, Idk how GA capacity will work."
3532,Places might have reduced capacity still while we figure all of this out.
3533,I’m guessing the tour will resume in ‘22
3534,Hell nah.
3535,"It was a right-wing religious people thing, too."
3536,There were a bunch of cases where old diseases like measles ripped through tight-knit religious communities because they were anti-vax AND also sent some kids on missionary trips to Africa.
3537,Certainly could happen and there probably has been a few such cases.
3538,Though it would be a very small number that it wouldn't make a difference to the covid death toll.
3539,Not to mention we just need to look at the total excess death toll to see that there is a chance we may actually be undercounting covid deaths

3684,They didn’t test people regularly throughout the trials but rather asked them to get tested if they had symptoms.
3685,Therefore they don’t know if people who were vaccinated got the virus and were just asymptomatic and therefore possibly able to pass the virus on to others.
3686,It’s good that it reduced the instances of symptomatic cases though and it’s still possible that there weren’t any/many asymptomatic cases but it’s not known.

3707,Appreciate being from the Commonwealth will often make it easier given the language and educational similarities - I just don't remember anything specific to the Commonwealth as a whole.
3708,"I'd also caution while it might have been easy historically, it probably won't be going forwards."
3709,There is likely to be a tightening up of the rules.
3710,"NZ will still need lots of skilled migrants for sure, but standards will probably increase."
3711,"It’s not that everyone is “okay” with things dragging on until 2022, it’s just that they are being logically realistic."
3712,Ty who?
3713,Nice
3714,"If it helps, I’m an ER doc and can’t get one yet."
3715,Hang in there friend.
3716,[Covid damages your balls.
3717,](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201122/COVID-19-potentially-has-negative-impacts-on-male-fertility.aspx) 1/5 of world population could have a long lasting baby bust.
3718,"This pandemic has been the best thing to ever happen to me, lol."
3719,How many high priority people do you think there are?
3720,I read something like 16-20%.
3721,Another 20-25% of the population are children who can't get the vaccine yet at all because it isn't approved for that.
3722,150 million people means pretty much everyone over 25 will get it by June and probably sooner.
3723,The J&amp;J vaccine getting EUA in February means everyone who can get vaccinated will very likely get it by the end of March.
3724,Lol.
3725,We’re a long ways from that.
3726,Lol.
3727,Okay ballersshotcaller.
3728,Go ahead and die in mid winter 2021.
3729,You can't 'live normal again' in a pandemic.
3730,You die and kill a lot of people with you.
3731,"This isn’t accurate, nor is it logistically possible."
3732,"There will be general public availability during that time, but that doesn’t mean everyone who wants it will get it."
3733,Everyone should realize there will still be a line to get it—all of the doses can’t drop like that.
3734,"A majority of people who want it will probably have their first-round by July/August, but since it’s not instant, it’ll drag on until the late Fall/early Winter."
3735,Then we’re back inside with the cold weather (what’s considered typical flu season).
3736,Will deaths be as bad this time next year?
3737,Absolutely not.
3738,Will things be relatively normal this time next year?
3739,No way in hell.
3740,Q1/Q2 2022 will be when some semblance of “normal” life returns.
3741,That’s assuming the amount of vaccines available and the speed which people are vaccinated is linear.
3742,It won’t be.
3743,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember that we identified the cause of this disease early (coronavirus), and the closest relation i know is SARS."
3744,Doesn't SARS-CoV spread mainly through droplets and masks do work for prevention?
3745,"When we don't have enough info about the new virus, relying on measures that did work should be practical, and masks are available and inexpensive."
3746,"There should be no reason to push the idea against mask wearing, especially from a renowned and experienced doctor like Fauci."
3747,I think literally everyone in Sweden should have expected that it would come back this strongly.
3748,An example is the Spanish Flu that did *exactly this*.
3749,"The first year it lessened over the summer, restrictions were relaxed and then it came back in force in the autumn and winter."
3750,Most countries have a smaller population than California.
3751,"What a stupid piece of ""information""."
3752,Amen to that brother.
3753,They don’t know for sure whether people can still pass on the virus because they didn’t include that in the trials.
3754,It’s still possible that the vaccine stops you from getting the virus all together.
3755,They just don’t know yet.
3756,Obviously it’s good to act as through you could still spread it until it’s know for sure one way or the other.
3757,"The population density is a bit misleading, with how 80% or something lives on 20% of the area."
3758,[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Norden_pop_density.gif/250px-Norden_pop_density.gif) very low res (lol) map kind of illustrates it.
3759,But the density still definitely isn't crazy high.
3760,"Sweden doing ""fuck all"" is just a blatant lie, and the constant flow of misinformation not just about Sweden but every country, really drags down the quality of the sub."
3761,Isn't LA one of the biggest cities in the world...?
3762,If you count LA county / orange county and LA city county its like 19 million + people.
3763,"According to articles, he is showing symptoms, but no details on whether they are severe or not."
3764,"I also heard he recently attended some council meeting yesterday, therefore potentially exposing government officials while contagious."
3765,So remember when a world leader testing positive for COVID was absolutely *world-shattering* news?
3766,Now it happens so often we're just getting desensitized to it...
3767,Kinda doubt this person saved lives.
3768,"When someone calls themselves a healthcare worker, they're prolly just a CNA."
3769,In which case they do laundry.
3770,They basically work at a laundromat.
3771,"Subject to data on what happens to case numbers (and the R number, if that data is readily available) at different levels of vaccination, I would agree with you."
3772,"I'm not sure what percentage of the population is available and qualified to deliver the vaccine, but if they need to vaccinate 3.5M of their population (excluding children) over three weeks, that's roughly 300k per week, or 50,000 per day."
3773,"Assuming 15-minute slots and an eight-hour workday, six days per week, that's 1,600 vaccine workers, which seems doable."
3774,"Let's face it though, there's still going to be group of people who refused to lockdown and wear masks and still went out when they were sick or think that the pandemic is a government conspiracy to give you vaccines or whatever."
3775,But at the end of the day I guess they're mainly putting themselves at higher risk.
3776,"The oral polio vaccine contains a live virus, which makes it more effective but also riskier, which is why we use the other vaccine nowadays in most parts of the world, where polio isn't prevalent anymore."
3777,"It only makes sense to use the oral one where risks of contacting wild polio are much higher than risks of getting polio from the vaccines (and the oral vaccine is just easier to administer, especially in regions where access to medical facilities is harder or impossible)."
3778,"None of the COVID vaccines use live COVID though, and the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and ModeRNA) don't contain viruses at all."
3779,[deleted]
3780,"Your comment implies that non-whites are poor, which is a big yikes"
3781,Yep.
3782,People here are really sheltered.
3783,Most of the people I know who have tested positive are clear extroverts.
3784,I'm not saying it absolves them from personal responsibility but I do think it's naturally easier for introverts to embrace social distancing.
3785,Me 2 tbh
3786,I agree with the thinking behind all your points.
3787,They all make sense to me and it may yet pan out.
3788,There is sadly a however that applies to all your valid points.
3789,&gt; They’ve already addressed that they’ll be ramping up production as things progress.
3790,"However, recently (today) Pfizer is telling the US that they are experiencing delays and may not make delivers contracted to on time."
3791,"This is just one example of such talk of production delays 
https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/12/16/pfizer-production-issue-to-cause-delays-in-florida-vaccine-shipments

&gt;More vaccine will be available from manufacturers, supply chain kinks will be worked out, vaccines with different/ easier shipping standards come out, etc."
3792,"Possibly, but this is not always the way things work out."
3793,If the manufacturer cannot get supplies (even something as simple as vials) or constituent chemicals then production kinks may not be eliminated.
3794,&gt;Any product hitting market isn’t going to go from nothing to 1/2 a million in a month.
3795,"I think that increase from Q1 to Q2 is not unreasonable, considering the scale of people working on it and the urgency of the matter."
3796,"However, the worldwide demand could work against this."
3797,It could go either way.
3798,Fingers crossed that my napkin number crunching is garbage.
3799,I want this relegated to history just as much as the next person.
3800,"Also, the vaccine only prevents the chance you will develop major symptoms."
3801,It does not prevent you from still carrying it and infecting others.
3802,"Something good to know for those with children, since young kids will not be allowed to get the vaccine yet."

Sweden has not succeeded in its corona handling, the king says."
3804,"In SVT's program ""The year with the royal family"" he is critical."
3805,"– I think we have failed, there are a large number who have died quite simply, and it is terrible, he says in SVT's program ""The year with the royal family""."
3806,"It is SVT Morgonstudion that plays a clip from SVT's program ""The year with the royal family""."
3807,"There, the king expresses himself critically about how Sweden has handled the corona pandemic and calls it a ""failure""."
3808,– You think of all the family members who have happened to not be able to say goodbye to their deceased family members.
3809,"I think it is a heavy and traumatic experience not to be able to take a warm farewell, he says to SVT."
3810,"The king tells SVT that 2020 has been a terrible year:

– The Swedish people have suffered enormously in difficult conditions, says King Carl Gustaf."
3811,"Reactions after the king's words about the corona

Henrik Wenander, professor of public law at Lund University, says that this type of criticism is very unusual."
3812,"– It is startling, because it is unusual for the king to speak in this way."
3813,He should not express himself politically in a way that can be perceived as having a different opinion than the current government.
3814,"At the same time, he should be a symbolic leader, even in crises."
3815,"So he may also need to comment on what has happened, he says in ""Morgonstudion""."
3816,"Johan T Lindwall, editor-in-chief of Svensk damtidning, says that it is exceptional that he is so critical."
3817,"– It is really a giant mark against the current government, he says to SVT."
3818,Joakim Nergelius is a professor of law at Örebro University.
3819,"He does not think that the statement is outside the scope of how the king is allowed to express himself, but says that it is a stronger formulation than expected."
3820,"– It is unexpectedly sharp: ""we have failed""."
3821,"He could have said ""It's tragic"" or something more general that everyone agrees on."
3822,"At the same time: who are ""we""?"
3823,"He can hardly refer to the government where he is not included, says Joakim Nergelius."
3824,"Infection was detected in November

King Carl Gustaf was infected with the Queen and the Crown Princess couple at the end of November after Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia tested positive for covid-19."
3825,"In ""The Year with the Royal Family"", the king is asked about his concern about becoming infected."
3826,"He then replies that it feels more and more obvious, as it has crept closer and closer."
3827,"Asked about face masks

Since the start of the pandemic, the royal couple has largely lived in quarantine."
3828,"In October, however, the isolation for a visit to Karolinska University Hospital was broken, which Dagens Nyheter reported on."
3829,"During the visit, Queen Silvia raised the issue of the use of face masks:

– I think many people want to know why we are not recommended to wear them, because there are requirements for them in so many other countries."
3830,"She received the answer that the Public Health Agency's assessment does not provide sufficient protection, that on the contrary it is difficult to use."
3831,"– I do not think it seems that anyone can explain that so that you actually understand, the king said then and shook his head, according to DN."
3832,I hope the vaccine doesnt work.
3833,Is there any chance the spread is because of people being forced to go to work due to poverty?

The issue is that Sweden should have done *something*."

3888,We accept those deaths every year and don't distance or mask.

4009,"They may not show symptoms, but they have the virus in their nasal passageway so that if they're speaking, breathing, sneezing and so on, they can still transmit it to others."
4010,This is the main reason why we can't stop wearing masks right after we get the vaccine.
4011,That's how it should be.
4012,"The same people screaming that the vaccine is causing deaths (when those dying after having the vaccine actually dying from heart disease etc) are the same people screaming that its heart disease, respiratory issues, etc that is causing the people who actually have covid to die, but not the virus itself."
4013,People are fucking muppets.
4014,"&gt; Which my dog jumped up and ran to the dog treat cupboard, apparently hearing ""milk bone""."
4015,"[Researchers say](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/no-your-dog-doesnt-understand-everything-you-say-study-finds):

&gt; dogs cannot hear subtle differences between words the way humans can."
4016,"For example, the difference between ""dog"" and ""dig"" sounds different to human ears, but not so different to dog ears."
4017,"So to your dog, it probably *did* sound like your daughter was excitedly promising him a treat, and then no one gave him one."
4018,Bad humans!
4019,:(
4020,Nope.
4021,Only after reopening and a rise in cases in June.
4022,"I would say that your opinion is speculation at best, and that you have no idea what you're talking about."
4023,Ask questions instead of making assumptions.
4024,Jury’s still out on whether you can spread it to prople.
4025,Once vaccinated you still get covid - you still get infected - it’s just you then can fight it off quicker &amp; tend to have an asymptomatic infection.
4026,"Data so far shows that Pfizer-vaccinated people can still have asymptotic infections; Moderna vaccine maybe less so, not clear yet."
4027,"Also, remember the vaccines are not 100% effective."
4028,Some Pfizer-vax’d subjects still got covid and one had a severe case.
4029,5% of vax’d people will not develop immunity.
4030,So we’re not gonna be fully protected till the population as a whole hits herd immunity (~70% vaccinated) at which point te disease becomes so rare that the chance of encountering it essentially becomes zero.
4031,Everybody is gonna pick their own comfort level but I think everybody needs to at least know about all those elements.
4032,"(personally - once vax’d I’m gonna get an antibody titer, then if I’ve got detectable antibodies I’m gonna start traveling again, but will keep my mask on so I don’t spread an asymptomatic infection to others)"
4033,Rich people are a tiny minority in any state
4034,California dumped a huge backlog today
4035,In the nose.
4036,With all their resources I thought California would be handling the outbreak better than others.
4037,"&gt; but they live under an out of control government that commits genocide like it’s nothing lol

4044,"&gt;Fauci, in a phone interview, said unrestricted capacities at sports stadiums will be among “the last thing[s] that you're gonna see” as the United States pushes toward the end of the pandemic in 2021."
4045,"&gt;When asked about the possibility of full, 20,000-seat NBA arenas in July, when the postseason is scheduled to conclude, Fauci said: “Ah, I think that'll be cutting it close.”"
4046,I agree being an island makes it easier and even with an appropriate response I would not expect results as good in europe or the states.
4047,Even though it's an island as well; I think the difference in outcome between NZ and Australia shows that it becomes more difficult as land mass and population increase as well.
4048,"I wouldn't expect results in Europe or here in the US to be as good, but I think there was room for improvement."
4049,"Here in the US, I think early testing and isolation could have drastically improved our outcome."
4050,"Yeah, hopefully with frontline healthcare workers getting vaccinated first, that will be a reality."
4051,Keeping covid patients at home where possible seems like a win-win to me.

4070,Interesting find.
4071,"I read this as saying that blunt measures like bans on gatherings, school closures, business closures are more effective than narrower measures that require a high degree of individual buy-in like masks."
4072,Makes sense.
4073,cant you get vaccinated and have some medical personnel by your side in case you get a severe allergic reaction?
4074,"Hey, Hitler’s on the other line for you, says it’s urgent"
4075,Philly isn't PA.
4076,The rest of the state is acting like everything is normal
4077,You do realize that case numbers this high will almost certainly translate to 750-1000 deaths a day in a month or so right?
4078,Is there any reasonably accurate source for the average percent with covid who are hospilized &amp; the average percent with covid who save longer term effects?
4079,I found a number of incomplete numbers but no aggregate clear number.
4080,Initial vaccines are most effectively used in countries where large numbers are dying and the health system is struggling.
4081,From a pure need perspective we can hold out comfortably for a few more months.
4082,"A lot of countries are approving vaccines on emergency grounds which we probably can't justify, need to wait for full trial data to approve anyway."
4083,From a business perspective our smaller population probably makes us less able to negotiate for precious early vaccines.
4084,Finally from a cynical perspective we can afford to wait a bit longer for more safety data to accumulate.
4085,Most recent polls are at 70 percent.
4086,Dude literally fuck you for this comment.

4095,"In Greece, taxes were insanely high, but no one paid them."
4096,"In the UK, not so bad, but services were crap as soon as you left the big cities."
4097,"In Venezuela ( in the early 2000’s, both before and just after Chavez, they were high, and you got shit for them."
4098,But in all cases the fucken country just can’t run wi5hout taxes.
4099,"Everything, and I mean everything needs government to run, and that all costs money."
4100,"Without a government, who makes sure the fuel you buy doesn’t fuck your car engine over time?"
4101,"You can’t check that yourself, can you?"
4102,Or the food you eat?
4103,"Without a tax base, will every road be a toll road?"
4104,Things that people need to live need money.
4105,"Any if the tax base is whittled to zero, the only person who wins is the rich fuck who’s selling the low tax message to you."
4106,"I’m not a Dewey eyed liberal- I’ve got a couple degrees, a good job in finance, and I make good money."
4107,"Last year, I paid around $70,000 in income tax, and a bunch more in property taxes, etc."
4108,"In return, I live in a city of a million people where I don’t need to lock my door."

4115,"The pastors, the politicians, the business leaders, the teachers, the school boards, and a significant number of chiropractors, doctors and  nurses insist it is a hoax, masks don't work, and when grandma dies of covid it was just her time to go home to be with Jesus."
4116,Very few people wear masks.
4117,Stores don't enforce mask policies.
4118,Much store staff are visibly sick.
4119,Cashiers openly cough on your produce and on customers.
4120,Managers can be seen without masks.
4121,"Many doctor's offices not all staff wears masks or observes protocols, including oncologists."
4122,"Schools are open through the highest levels, students are mask optional which means no masks, there's no social distancing observed in most of the schools or on the school buses (finances), absolutely no efforts were made to retrofit HVAC systems."
4123,"If a health board in a county votes for masks then right after their announcement the mayor holds a press conference with the sheriff to say that masks violate the constitution and the sheriff vows never to enforce ""unconstitutional"" mandates."
4124,People gather in large crowds with semiautomatic rifles and confederate flags and no masks to protest black people and to celebrate the President and their freedom.
4125,Wearing a mask is looked d own upon and considered evidence you support socialism and hate america.
4126,[removed]
4127,Rich people also have more living space and better access to social distancing.
4128,The poor are some of the worse hit -  their housing is so cramped that if one person in the household gets it everyone will likely get it.

4133,Don’t see the hypocrisy?
4134,And alot of people are acting like Trump is god emperor and begging for him to tell us nothing is wrong and to keep with our normal lives.
4135,Personally as many deaths as 9/11 occurring in one day is not a trivial issue.
4136,But I'm only a scientist believing in science.
4137,It’s ten times more deadly than y &amp; the survivors have a hell of a lot more long term complications.

4145,don't just say herd immunity when your have no fucking clue what it means
4146,The vaccine compliance thing will also likely be localized.
4147,GLHF vaccine accepters who live among majority deniers!
4148,I think they should be allowed to get it early of they're willing to pony up an absurd amount of money.
4149,"For example, if Oprah wanted to pay $200,000 to get it early, I'm sure there are a number of essential workers who would love a stimulus check and be willing to trade spots with her in exchange for that money."
4150,Can I apply to work at an Amazon warehouse in order to get the vaccine?

4159,fuck trump.

4164,Well said.
4165,this is one of the stupidest comments I've ever read
4166,That's probably like half a month for him.
4167,And?
4168,There are a lot of things that can happen to you besides dying of covid.
4169,"You can decide for yourself but I won't live a ""normal"" life until I can get vaccinated."
4170,"It's unlikely to happen to me, but a few percent of people that get infected have long lasting side effects."
4171,We have no idea if they'll ever get back to being fully healthy.
4172,My flu shot was free.
4173,He can actually suck my dick.
4174,Fuck fauci and fuck this covid shit.

4188,will it really matter considering most churches spend the majority of their revenue?
4189,A lot yeah
4190,Yes 100 percent you are a complete asshole for thinking that.
4191,"Like, I know you lack the emotional and social intelligence to understand why that makes you a horrible person, but it’s important to me that you at least know I am fully embarrassed for you."
4192,lol not surprised someone who denies the pandemic also wants the pandemic he denies to kill disabled people.
4193,The poors be partying like there is no tomorrow.
4194,"Trust me, I know."
4195,1.
4196,Based on in vitro conditions with exogenous reverse transcriptase.
4197,2.
4198,"Even with such conditions, the integrated viral DNA are fragments and would not lead to viral gene expression or have much biological significance at all."
4199,"tldr highly artificial conditions designed to induce viral integration in a dish manages to do it to some extent, but even then it would not result in the production of more virus."

4203,"&gt; which is approaching a third of the country

At some level I feel I must be lucky to not have been in that third yet."
4204,But then I remember how many Americans are in complete denial about this virus and are living their lives as normal.
4205,I suppose by now they're very over-represented in the numbers.
4206,Didn’t he just say that we will be wearing masks until next winter?
4207,"I'm under no impression it would last forever, highschool relationships rarely do."
4208,"But having spent so much time with someone and caring about them for so long, it hurts nonetheless."

4213,"As much I would love for that to happen, but that quite ambitious."
4214,I don't have faith on the anti maskers movement.
4215,It's just a stupid generalization.
4216,"And ya know, children since it’s 16+ for the vaccine."
4217,"So now we have people wanting to get the vaccine acting like idiots because they want to wage war with the anti-vaxxer idiots, not realizing they could hurt innocent people."
4218,yes
4219,Or perhaps.. once they themselves are inoculated and thus not a risk?
4220,"Yeah, tomorrow he’ll push it to 2050."
4221,"And folks will gild whatever he spews here anyway, lol."
4222,So is there a reason why they use fetal cell lines instead of normal cell lines( if those are even a thing?)
4223,"It's such an unnerving detail, but when I tried looking into it, I just got that the cells can divide more and that the catholic church had given the ok on taking vaccines made with fetal cell lines, but nothing else."
4224,I originally just thought this was just antivax propaganda because it's so out there.
4225,[removed]
4226,I GOT ACCINATED
4227,70 percent or so of Americans will take the vaccine.
4228,It’s risen significantly.
4229,These people can’t think rationally.
4230,They think with their feelings.
4231,This is a gross exaggeration of the American healthcare system.
4232,But whatever
4233,This is the problem with any comment about how the US does things.
4234,There are so many people and essentially 50 different mini countries with their own laws so it’s tough to say that the US does it this way or the US has it this way.
4235,Dr Li will be remembered forever.

4241,My roommate's entire family will invite themselves over to party....just cause.
4242,Thank God I picked up a weekend shift at a side gig.
4243,I feel safer working with an N95 on all day then being at home.
4244,My roommate's and their families are not taking this seriously at all.
4245,"Pretty much boils down to ""someone they know said their family member died of other causes but COVID was listed as cause of death, so not a single statistic out there is close to being true""."
4246,"There are things that make ""extra people"" die every day."
4247,We could save lives at any time by doing absolutely nothing.. but of course that's not what we should do
4248,If I recall this is the same person who discouraged mask use.
4249,People tend to forget that event.
4250,I work with Covid pts everyday on vents and terminally extubated over 200 people.
4251,Wonder how many of would have still been alive if mask use was not discouraged from the start.

4283,"My family did cancel Thanksgiving and our state is heavier on a restriction approach than WI is, but it does seem as the Midwest as a whole (even the states who didn't a shut  a lot of stuff down like we did) is doing better for the time being after the early November spike."
4284,"That said, California is in a pretty terrible place now, I have friends who live out there who are quite concerned."
4285,"Since most people who want the vaccine will be able to get it by April or may, there won't be a lot of time for a spike except perhaps among the anti-vax community"
4286,"Cannot believe you had to break up with your high school relationship

only a one in a generation global pandemic has led you to experience that"
4287,Same goes for getting Covid itself so why not get the vaccine?
4288,It's the internet.
4289,There's been a lot of bullshit since 1995.
4290,Whoever can't sniff it out by now is probably a lost cause.
4291,My flu shot was free.
4292,&gt;This is the very first time of the year I feel jealous of healthcare workers.
4293,Congrats and thanks you for all the lives you've saved!
4294,I'm very happy for all the healthcare workers who are able to protect themselves while they've worked so hard to help others.
4295,Personally I feel our educators should go next.
4296,With so much pressure and demand to get children back into school I feel for teachers and administrators who run the schools.
4297,Maybe along with front line grocery workers who are putting themselves at risk.
4298,I did get a laugh at the Port of Los Angeles Union who made a request to be next in line after healthcare.

4305,You should not have to worry.
4306,The vaccine will certainly be free when it is available to you.
4307,To dispell your fear of if the person who gives it to you is qualified and ready to administer a epishot to you if need be...
4308,I'm almost certain that the 18 year old at your local CVS is qualified for it.
4309,"""what do you expect to get award bombed"

4331,"I'm still wondering, are there any negative side effects or side effects in general for the vaccine?"
4332,I'm wondering because I would wanna get it.
4333,"Also, how much would the vaccine help if covid evolves?"
4334,"I've heard so much, but I wanted to ask to see if anyone knew or found out."
4335,Maybe had a link or something for me to read.
4336,He’s not allowed to have an opinion?
4337,Everyone gets to make their own evaluation don’t they?
4338,"At least most leaders are in Europe aren't as reckless as Trump when it comes to following the rules, knowing he's going to get the best treatment possible"
4339,V true!

4343,No plans either.
4344,The advice was consistently that masks mostly prevent spreading it to other people.
4345,"When there were very few cases, it didn't really make sense to have everyone wear a mask, especially when there was a shortage."
4346,"When there's a lot of people who have it, many whom are asymptomatic, and there's no mask shortage, then it makes sense to tell people to wear masks."
4347,He didn't lie - his advice changed because the situation changed.
4348,"No, the vaccine isn't used to implant chips and they don't cause autism."
4349,"Secondly, if you are so scared about getting a chip implemented, then why are you on social media?"
4350,"They don't need to implant a chip to follow whatever you do, they already do that through your phone."
4351,"The shingles vaccine has about a 1 in 500k severe reaction, nobody posts those in the news."
4352,This vaccine is probably similar rate wise.
4353,"BTW, Shingrix kicked my ass for 4 straight days first dose."
4354,I couldn't get out of bed.
4355,2nd dose my arm was a little sore.
4356,Worth it not to get shingles.

4358,Terrifying.

4360,This is one depraved nation.
4361,Thanks Trump!

4364,"Oh right, I thought you were comparing country vs country, not state vs country."
4365,"True, but why are we acting like common people are 'idiots' and murderers for getting infected and spreading the virus unknowingly but people like him are getting a free pass?"
4366,You’re more likely to be struck by lightning than have an allergic reaction to the vaccine.
4367,( unless you know you have a extremely severe allergy ) The side affects have been published and are well known.
4368,Expect the feeling of onset of the flu that will disappear within 48 hours.
4369,This is your immune system at work.
4370,This is beyond scary.
4371,"Texas reported 58,245 on dec 11."
4372,Texas was first  sadly.
4373,"At the end of February, when there were (at least believed to be) very few cases and poentential mask shortages for healthcare workers, that was true."
4374,"Then the situation changed, so his advice changed..."
4375,I think even if you had coronavirus it is still beneficial to get the vaccine.
4376,"Secondly, get outta here with your conspiracy theories"
4377,The infection numbers are just as scary.
4378,Somewhere between 20%-25% of the LTC population.
4379,And that’s not counting undiagnosed/asymptomatic infections.
4380,"If you read the study, it has nothing to do with used masks at all."
4381,The entire headline is misleading.
4382,"My son has Down syndrome and I, along with other family members, would be devastated if we lost him."

4385,"&gt; there's literally multiple pictures of him at events without a mask laughing his ass off

Are you talking about Fauci?"

4387,Remember when people used to go on and on about how well Sweden was handling it?
4388,"Nice quote from the king of Sweden: 

&gt;“The Swedish people have suffered enormously in difficult conditions,” King Carl XVI Gustaf told state broadcaster SVT."
4389,"When it comes to the strategy deployed in Sweden, he said, “I think we have failed.”"
4390,Can this guy start wearing a jade headdress and make his predictions from the top of a ziggurat?
4391,He's the most important man in France.
4392,He should be the first to get vaccinated.
4393,He's probably getting Regeneron as we speak.
4394,He'll be fine.
4395,Postpartum (depression)
4396,"So he said ""clusters, but no full second wave"" and less/slower spread because ""higher number of previous infections"" (so herd immunity)."
4397,What exactly did I get wrong?
4398,What real other reasons that didn't apply to Norway and Finland did he have for the lack of second wave?
4399,"I know he said lack of travel would help, but there wasn't much of travel in Finland or Norway eather."
4400,You are right.
4401,But isn't measuring each dose an extra task that wouldn't be there if the the vials contain the exact amount of vaccine?

4406,Interesting!
4407,"I had no idea

I'd include a quote from the article to explain what you mean, because at first I thought you were saying that if a driver isn't wearing his seatbelt, when he crashes, he can launch through his windshield and the other car's windshield to kill the other driver, like some sort of tactical strike."
4408,Well honestly its no shocker.
4409,"They are elderly, sent to live out the last few years of the their lives, they are medically frail for many diseases and are prone to hospitalizations for flu etc."

4411,Interesting.
4412,I didn't know they'd made that recommendation in the UK.

4475,Also account testing rates which are relatively low in Florida
4476,Here's my 2 minute take.
4477,"AZ has messy data because they mixed studies together as one study, studies had different dosing unintentionally, the different studies had different age groups."
4478,"&amp;#x200B;

What's also different is that Moderna and Pfizer would ask patients how they are feeling, if they are symptomatic, they would be tested."
4479,"Where as AZ was testing the patients periodically, so it would count asymptomatic patients who might have immune system defeating covid at the moment."
4480,"&amp;#x200B;

all that said, even at 62%, it's still above the efficacy of flu vaccine and is safe to use."

4493,I'm a teacher as well and you know what really doesn't make sense?
4494,They shut down restaurants in my state while kids openly eat in cafeterias with masks off.
4495,Teachers need to stay in the building and not quarantine.
4496,In my building one teacher with covid usually meant 3-5 other teachers out quarantining for close contact.
4497,Schools provide childcare in addition to education and for that reason alone the more you can keep teachers in the building the better off the community is.

4560,This is much closer to countries like Germany (15.45) than it is to countries like Belgium (71.92).
4561,Similarly sized countries such as Switzerland (43) and Austria (41.5) have over double the amount of deaths.
4562,[You can see the total number of deaths divided by first and second wave here.

4638,I imagine if it's a one dose vaccine that should hopefully speed up vaccinations since you don't need to book the same person to come in again in 3 weeks time.
4639,I’m a high schooler who’s dream was to study abroad in Israel or Switzerland but I’m afraid I can’t anymore due to covid restrictions
4640,I'm sorry but what?
4641,That's not how any of this works.
4642,interesting scenario.
4643,what happens if you get the 1st dose and a day later get exposed and infected?
4644,"you have the vaccine making your body produce the spikes, and you have the real deal coming with the spike and the blueprint to create more viruses."
4645,"Deaths are definitely underreported, but it's certainly not in the range of a few millions, otherwise there would have been a huge uproar."
4646,25-28k people die in India on any given day(not because of covid-19) and a few thousand more than that are born too.
4647,"So, even an excess death toll of 1500-2000 per day due to covid-19 doesn't seem that much in India."
4648,I think this is satire
4649,it's easier for the governments to wait for the central approval and blame the EU if something goes wrong than to take initiative and shoulder the responsibility
4650,"You can also say that about half the countries in Europe, lots of countries have 'failed'"
4651,That would basically be a different disease.
4652,Such changes take decades of accumulated mutations in isolated populations

4703,The vaccine is scheduled be cleared on the 21st by the EU Regulatory institutuon.
4704,I disagree.
4705,It makes no sense to send teachers back if the adult population isn’t vaccinated.

4714,I can easily tell that their figures are wrong.
4715,For Delhi they are saying that we are missing 25 cases per 1 detected.
4716,However if we were at 75% we would not have the spike that delhi witnessed around Diwali.

4728,It really sucks that global media doesn't give a fuck about my country.
4729,"Yes, we're never going to have as many cases as the largest countries simply because our population is only 2.8 million."
4730,"And, yes, we're tiny and most of the world doesn't even know where we are."

4947,"TL;DR will the vaccine be coming with antibody tests, so that the limited doses of the vaccine are only given to people who really, really need it?"
4948,"I had a conversation with my doctor, I said I was excited to be getting the vaccine, but do I need it if I've already had it but was asymptomatic."
4949,"She says:

""If you already have antibodies for COVID, you don't need the vaccine anymore."
4950,"Your body already build the immunity towards COVID-19."""
4951,Great!

4953,"""We are not routinely checking anyone for antibodies for Covid infection."
4954,"It is also not determined how the Covid vaccine will be distributed and if the antibody test has any role in it."""

4965,"This is obviously assuming they can get the full 40% extra out of every vial, but I’m guessing that won’t be the case every time."
4966,We should be able to go back to normal even if just the vulnerable get the vaccine.
4967,For the first time.
4968,ok where did you get this info?
4969,getting the vax doesnt mean you wont get symptoms.
4970,hell you can still die from covid even if you get the vax.
4971,all the vax does is give your body a chance to try and figure out how to deal with a strange new thing.
4972,and then IF/WHEN you do get covid you have a slightly higher chance of fighting it.

4994,"Assuming no delays, if we go by what the authorities have been saying about the vaccine, it'll be April or May by the time people in low risk groups will have the option of being vaccinated, and then another month before it will be fully effective because that's how long the vaccine takes to hold."

5015,"“So, if we get the overwhelming majority of people taking the vaccine, and you have on the one hand an effective vaccine, on the other hand, a high degree of uptake of the vaccine, we could start getting things back to relative normal as we get into the second and third quarter of the year, where people can start thinking about doing things that were too dangerous just months ago."""
5016,"Quote number two:

Also the head of warp speed who actually is worried about the actual vaccination think that by May we should be in the clear

5051,"But that is the point, one vaccine (that we know of right now) out of several that will be distributed reduces asymptomatic infection."
5052,"It isn't reasonable to ask people to know which vaccine they got and then decide if they should wear a mask or not, that is why they are making the statement we should all just wear our masks for a little longer."

5256,I wonder what they would have said if I didn't have one?
5257,Because people can’t wear their masks or take this virus seriously.
5258,This estimate was when assuming masks weren’t a political issue.
5259,Cute you think there will be reduced strain on hospitals by then.
5260,How naïve you are...
5261,The Moderna and Phizer mRNA vaccines only reduce symptoms.
5262,The manufacturers do not claim they prevent infection and infectiousness of SARS cov2 virus.
5263,I think that half has been halved as well.
5264,Wouldn't it make more sense to have mobile crematoria?
5265,It’s a risky business being a landlord
5266,With as many infections as we've had at this point wouldn't we have a pretty good idea if those reinfections that have cropped up were anything besides relatively rare anomalies?
5267,It's been such a crazy year that a blizzard across some of the most populated areas of the US seems like no big deal.
5268,"I mean, remember when the sky turned some degree of orange over the whole country?"
5269,Or one of the most active hurricane seasons on record?
5270,"Yeah, me too."
5271,How do you know you have been covid free?
5272,"The studies say you can still get it, but it will be mild or asymptomatic."
5273,I don’t think you can know whether you were in the placebo group or not.
5274,"Which Washington, the state or the district?"
5275,In Germany we have pretty consistently been told return to normal would be by winter season
5276,"Yes, the guy concerned about 300 million deaths due to hunger and other things is a bigot."
5277,polyethylene glycol.
5278,its a lipid molecule.
5279,in larger doses it is a laxative.
5280,looks like it gets used as a lubricant in condoms as well.
5281,"""""All individuals must be observed for at least 20-30 minutes after injection to monitor for any adverse reaction. """
5282,Does this 20-30 minutes only apply for people with allergies or everyone?
5283,"I have read that in the UK people are monitored for 15 minutes only, which does not seem to align with that."
5284,"So, at this rate, it's only going to take like 500 weeks to vaccinate the whole population on the island."
5285,(just to put the 130k people vaccinated in to perspective)
5286,Get them antibodies boyyy
5287,I hope you attend the funerals of all the people you've killed.
5288,You're right.
5289,I'm right.
5290,It is absurd.
5291,We need to end this shit ASAP.
5292,No time for games or grandstanding like some of these putzs are doing.
5293,You’re posting articles from March and April when Amazon was struggling to adapt to a new environment.
5294,These articles are way out of date and show nothing relevant.
5295,My uncle that lives in Orange County posts on FB how he can't believe the numbers and how it's all inflated and it's a hoax.

5599,"Honestly i would much rather take it after a while in case the vaccines can have some slight side temporary effects, or if they run out here, i have had Covid from my dad and he doesn't know how he himself got it, we all follow the instructions, after taking the meds and everything they told us we will be immune from getting infected or infecting other for a good 3-6 months"
5600,Working from home/teleworking better be a new normal!
5601,😡I hate wasting 2 hours of my day driving for no reason.
5602,Wait I thought it was going to be late spring early summer.

5604,I wonder what could have happened in 2020 to cause a lot of people to lose their health insurance?
5605,Uhh..this is a big yikes
5606,I agree with you.
5607,"The only thing that would change it is if hospitals start to get crazy, but I personally don’t think they will."

5610,Too bad we have so many anti-vaxxers in the country.
5611,And too many people who say “I’ll pass” because they have no faith in science.
5612,And too many people who believe god will protect and/or heal them because fairy tales are always good for protection against reality.
5613,You still blaming others for your problems?
5614,"For most of us, staying at home in our rooms away from other people and social/physical activity was relatively normal even before this deadly virus."

5626,If the hospitals will get overwhelmed another lockdown will happen.
5627,This is what ultimately forces restrictions everywhere.
5628,Most people are already tired.
5629,"Here, in Czech Republic, most people genuinely don't care anymore and just want to go back to normal and the politicians don't want to enforce any more restrictions, but we are still heading towards another lockdown since the prospect of healthcare system collapse ultimately forcec the politicians to act."
5630,"So in the end of the day, when we return to normalcy is determined by how the healthcare system will be doing."
5631,"My guess is that in countries that will vaccinate quickly, the restrictions will ease up a lot by mid or late spring, but probably we will not return to fully normal until the general population is vaccinated, which will take longer."

5637,I hope the immunity from the vaccine does not wane with time.
5638,Rooting for all my colleagues getting the vaccines now all over the world.

5786,Why are you comparing the deaths from a single violent terrorist attack to deaths from an ongoing contagious virus.
5787,That doesn’t make any sense at all; it’s illogical.
5788,A lot of people were dying every day from respiratory illnesses even before COVID happened.
5789,Approximately nobody died of airplanes flying into buildings before 9/11 happened.
5790,These numbers are not comparable; it’s nothing more than a cheap appeal to emotion.
5791,If you’re going to be taken seriously as a scientist then present hard data on the number of deaths from respiratory illnesses before and after COVID-19 and show how you reached logical conclusions from those numbers.
5792,Leave emotional appeals out of science.
5793,That would be amusing.

5935,"And he's 81 years old, so he's part of the group of people prioritized for the vaccine, elderly and frontline workers."
5936,"I said ""*complications* caused by COVID."""
5937,I never said that COVID causes heart attacks.
5938,I didn't say it was my friend either.
5939,It's a friend of my best friend.
5940,I don't know the person.
5941,"Honestly, a bonus for a *low* number of infections would be a good thing."
5942,Encourage the managers to be proactive about protective measures and following best practices on cleanliness.
5943,"It's definitely a bit of shuffling responsibility down, but it beats the current standard of *nobody* taking responsibility."
5944,A bet on the overall number is pretty sick.
5945,Us VA patients are feeling very shut out.
5946,Ongoing healthcare is mostly shut down.
5947,Cardiovascular disease really does the heavy lifting for a more apt comparison to Covid
5948,"""Euphoric?"""
5949,I bet more people would get it if it had some dope in the vaccine shot....again and again and again...
5950,This is the way.
5951,"They cannot realise how normal life is here, because their comment makes less than zero sense rn..."
5952,That’s what I mean.
5953,"It’s *too* defensive IMO in this situation to not just be completely cowboy in that particular matter and say “yeah, sure, why not”."
5954,Masks were required but people didn’t listen?
5955,"&gt;According to hotel employees, the Ahwahnee was fully booked all week and hundreds of guests showed up for the dinner’s multiple seatings indoors from 2-8 p.m. Face coverings were, in theory, required, but there was no enforcement."
5956,"While the limited seating and take-away options were meant to keep guests socially distanced, the bar area got extremely crowded, employees say, and social distancing fell by the wayside."
5957,[removed]
5958,"Well, he shouldn't."
5959,Why should we prioritize a rich guy that spent the quarantine in what most of us would consider a mansion and probably never having to even step into a supermarket to buy groceries (he probably already didn't do that before the virus) but the medic living in a studio apartment that spent the quarantine saving lives and working his ass off has to wait?
5960,"Duuude, they're putting MDMA in vaccines now?"
5961,This has been the most frustrating part of this in the US for me (understand other countries are similar).
5962,How can we not figure out how to remove the fucking red tape and get this shit done ASAP once the trial data is released?
5963,"I get that we want independent review of the data, but why does that have to take 6 weeks from when it's announced publicly?"
5964,"I'm the biggest leftist you'll find, but honestly the best thing the Trump admin did was when Meadows said he'd fire the FDA chief if they didn't have their approval vote by Friday night last week."
5965,"They are a rubber stamp, WHY THE HELL DID YOU WANT TO WAIT 48 HOURS TO VOTE."
5966,"Shit, just get all those folks on a zoom call immediately after the EUA meeting and vote right away."
5967,Yea seriously where’s that Regeneron for everyone?
5968,It seems good enough for Trumps and Giulianis only
5969,Even before 2020 happened most people I've known in my age range (25-30) were not ever planning on having children anyway.
5970,"Exactly, I don't understand why the goalposts keep on moving."
5971,Even if transmission is still a thing if we're protected or at least the most vulnerable are protected then hospitals aren't going to be overwhelmed and we won't be seeing thousands of deaths.
5972,"We can acknowledge the transmission issue with later vaccines (if it is even an issue, lets wait and see) right now we need to stop people getting ill."
5973,"I feel like when people talk about vaccinations they act as if this virus has a ridiculously high mortality rate under the age of 50, which is doesn't."
5974,"I completely understand wanting to be protected, I want to be vaccinated at 24, but I this idea that life won't be normal until 80% of us are vaccinated just doesn't make sense to me."
5975,If 95% of the most vulnerable are vaccinated and that's considerably less than the overall population we genuinely don't have much to worry about.
5976,[removed]
5977,"&gt; I'll still wear a mask in public as long as needed, of course."
5978,Why would you need a mask if you're vaccinated?
5979,Agreed.
5980,I going to get the vaccine as soon as I can.
5981,I am not going to wait until March if I don't have to.
5982,"&gt; severe lockdown

I disagree that the lockdowns are severe."
5983,"Severe lockdowns are 100% stay in place orders:

* essential workers have to stay at work 24//7 (Really truly essential, as in ""people will literally die within 24 hours if this job isn't done"" essential)
* unessential people cannot leave their property
* national guard delivering essential goods to people's houses
* Armed military patrolling the streets and arresting anyone violating orders, or shooting them in extreme circumstances."
5984,"What we have now I'd call ""fuck bars / restaurants in particular...otherwise what lockdown?"""
5985,lockdown.

5990,Why wouldn’t you just read the article?
5991,Jesus.
5992,You spent more time writing out your list of concerns than you would have actually reading in the first place.
5993,Looks like Finland is the only Scandanavian country without a monarchy.
5994,Any reason why?
5995,You're right I don't.
5996,And if my 89-year-old grandma lived with me I sure as hell wouldn't have my kids in school around her.
5997,"I would probably quit my job and do whatever it takes to protect her, just like anyone in that situation should be doing right now."
5998,"But you know what, that scenario doesn't represent over half of the family households who have working parent(s) where quitting their job and sitting at home for months isn't an option because they would lose their job, house, vehicles and food."
5999,"Do you also realize what it does to pre-school, elementary-aged children to sit at home for months without interactions with other children?"
6000,We shouldn't shut down the schools for a minority of the people who have elderly living with school-aged children.
6001,&gt; We need 75% of Americans to get the vaccine to establish herd immunity.
6002,"Technically, we don't even need that; we need 75% to get the vaccine \*or\* the virus."
6003,"Secondary infections are still a fraction of a percent, so at the very least we're dealing with ""immunity"" that's as-effective as the best vaccines."
6004,OH SHIT IT GETS YOU HIGH TOO?!
6005,?
6006,"Based on the Politico story yesterday, it was more than that - the administration actively wanted people to get it to set up herd immunity."
6007,Unless those two thirds aren’t in the higher risk groups.
6008,Majority of hospitalizations are in specific groups.
6009,If we vaccinate those groups we can prevent hospitals from being over run.
6010,"A
Strategically using the vaccine is required though."
6011,Sure if you equally distributed it amongst EVERYONE then you would be right.
6012,But if we distribute it to the risky groups and people who work in crowded areas first we can be much more efficient with the same amount of vaccine.
6013,How is he jumping the line?
6014,He's fucking 81 years old.
6015,It's old people and frontline workers first.
6016,Which group according to you does he not fit into?
6017,And Norway has half of Sweden’s population and density and Finland even lower?
6018,The comparison of mostly really rural countries to Sweden is silly
6019,"Well, this is just not true in the slightest."
6020,"He got the jab because he lives in the UK and is over the age of 80, that's it."
6021,Everyone in this range is eligible for a free jab and the roll out over the past couple of weeks is going very well.

6264,"Their initial strategy was ""flattening the curve"" or ""managed waves""."
6265,Someone posted on reddit saying their internal expectation was the lockdown would bring the R value down to R1.4.
6266,It was under R0.5.
6267,It look nurses threatening a strike for them to be given N95 masks around quarantine patients despite multiple becoming infected.
6268,It wasn't a shortage of PPE but their refusal to accept non heavy droplet transmission exists.
6269,MoH officials refused to accept non symptomatic infectiousness existed.
6270,They literally held a party in an isolation hotel.
6271,They weren't keen on testing border staff.
6272,They tried to end testing of people in the community then tried to wind back weekend testing during the election distraction.
6273,They were fixated on privacy with the tracing app to the point they mandated a complex 10 character password nobody could remember and had it autologout.
6274,"&gt;So they sticked out during the first wave, now?"
6275,I thought everything was great because they didn't have the worst numbers in the world and because I'm not an epidemiologist.
6276,"/s

I don't understand who you are directing this too."
6277,&gt;As well as more daily deaths and obviously much more cases.
6278,The cases are hard to determine because of the horribly low testing capacity until June.
6279,"[So far the daily deaths haven't reached the peak in April, even when looking at the predictive models."
6280,"](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/covid/blob/master/docs/deaths_lag_sweden_latest.png) 

I am sure it will be a higher or equal disease burden and death burden the second wave, as it has in many countries."
6281,"It turns out that the UK didn't ""approve the vaccine early""."
6282,"Instead, the UK went with emergency approval ahead of the _actual_ approval."
6283,"European countries can also do that, but none of them did."
6284,"As usual, politicians blaming the EU for their own shortcomings..."
6285,Anger and incredulity are privileges all animals have.
6286,Try the reflection.
6287,"The differences are indeed the point, but anyone can pick differences that advance their personal narrative."
6288,"Also, my zen attitude aside, as a scientist that's not what's going on."
6289,"I mean that's not where fat people come from, and that's also not where most COVID deaths come from."
6290,"Everyone thinks they know fundamental things about the universe, and they are almost never right."
6291,I'm starting to wonder who it is I serve.
6292,"I will make it easier, how is the test inventors opinion relevant, isn't that test buggy as hell and plagued with false positives?"
6293,Lol why

6299,&gt; What is the alternative?
6300,"I already said that, global distribution."
6301,Where does that money come from?
6302,It comes from the rich countries anyway.
6303,"It's the same exact thing that's happening now, except with more steps and with no government actually willing to go along with it because of the repercussions back home."
6304,"As an example, ""you did nothing while 300,000 of us died"" just cost Trump an election."
6305,Imagine the bloodbath it would have been if instead the plan had been to use our tax dollars to donate vaccines to Peru instead of back home.
6306,Everyone should be happy that *anyone* is getting vaccinated.
6307,"No need to rush to get it, we’ve been at this for almost a year, we can wait a bit more."
6308,Those who refuse the vaccine are the ones need a bonk in the head... then we can do it while they’re knocked out.
6309,Maybe.
6310,"Given that we didn't have enough masks and there were (at least believed to be) only a few hundred to 1000 cases with a handful of deaths, I think it would have been able to get everyone to social distance and wearing masks."
6311,"I think it's justified to fault the CDC for really dropping the ball on testing in the early stages -if we had been able to identify and quarantine those early cases when the numbers were still small, we might have been able to nip this in the bud."
6312,That's clear the better strategy when there's only a few hundred cases.
6313,"I also think it's more justified to fault Trump for downplaying the virus against the advice of experts from his own administration (and for starting a moronic culture war over masks, holding crowded rallies, etc)."

6331,"Yes, you can."
6332,"Norway's ""relatively fine"" period lasted from around May 20 until November 10 (174 days) and only 51 people died."
6333,"Likewise, Finland's ""relatively fine"" period also lasted from May 20 to November 10 and only 62 people died."
6334,274 people died in Sweden during the 92 days from August 1 to October 31.
6335,Sweden had around 5 times as many deaths in around half the time as Norway and Finland.
6336,"In fact, Sweden had more than twice as many deaths as Norway and Finland combined, in half the time."
6337,"Sweden was only doing ""relatively fine"" compared to their own disastrous  numbers from before."
6338,I think a recent study said mask mandates reduced community spread by 60+%.

6362,i'm sorry to see that
6363,I want to say that the growth in case numbers is slowing but it's so hard to know if that's an actual data point or if it's just constraints on testing capacity.

**Goals for vaccination if supply is limited**

ACIP set the following goals for recommending which groups should receive COVID-19 vaccines if supply is limited:

* Decrease death and serious disease as much as possible
* Preserve functioning of society
* Reduce the extra burden the disease is having on people already facing disparities
* Increase the chance for everyone to enjoy health and well-being"
6398,Because I don't think schools should be open at all.
6399,They aren't opened where I live.
6400,The teachers should go on strike where they are directed tovwork.
6401,Distributed???
6402,"Tell me how many have been administered... That's the 64,000 dollar question."
6403,"Idiots, start with Healthcare workers, then do elderly."
6404,By the time thats done chances are many vaccines will be available to the public to be able to come get vaccinated.

6406,This little gem is politicians' worst nightmare.

6540,1) We know now that asymptomatic people spread COVID at much lower frequencies than their symptomatic counterparts.
6541,2) The recent data released by Moderna strongly suggests the vaccine reduces transmission of the virus.

6549,"The idea that what was seen as the most developed and advanced country, with some of the greatest scientific minds and institutions, decided to use very little of it and decide herd immunity was the was to go is insane."

6555,*
6556,Can we all just agree that the media has been a fucking disgrace since the start of all this?
6557,"They take things out of context, purposefully mislead/clickbait with their titles, and overall spread an insane amount of gloom."
6558,I fully believe that the media is the reason people are checked out at this point.
6559,People can only take so much doom and gloom and headline whiplash before they give up.
6560,I know they've always been really bad and polarized before but like CHRIST they've made this pandemic at least 10x worse than it needed to be.
6561,I don't know how we can fix the media but someone needs to get editors and journalists on the line and tell them to chill.
6562,They should be in prison.
6563,"I think masks can make a difference, but they should only compliment other measures."
6564,A mask-mandate by itself doesn't solve the issue.
6565,"Here in Finland, we got daily infections down to single digits during the summer months and nobody was wearing a mask."
6566,"Now a lot of people are wearing masks, but other measures are looser and we have 300-400 daily cases."
6567,"If you really want to get it under control, you shut down schools and businesses, keep people apart."
6568,"You get infected by peoole you spend time with, not a rando you walk past in a supermarket."
6569,&gt; California and the US test more.
6570,"No, the UK tests more."
6571,"And secondly, deaths in California are about to go through the roof."
6572,The only people who think Sweden “failed” are people who over catastrophize this virus based on media fear mongering and misunderstanding of the data.
6573,At the absolute peaks not even 100 people in Sweden died per day.
6574,Other countries in Europe have seen numbers in the multiple hundreds for weeks and months per day.
6575,"Nobody shits on Belgium, Spain, Italy, France."
6576,"They attack Sweden because, while making a mistake protecting senior care they have taken a calm, rational and scientific approach without doing draconian lockdowns like in other places that have worse outcomes."
6577,It’s about trying to shame them.
6578,You’ll need to keep wearing a mask for awhile but within a month or two we really should start to see the deaths drop considerably and in 2-3 months hospitals will start having much more capacity than they do now.
6579,These next couple weeks will be the darkest days of the pandemic but then things should start to turn around.
6580,There is not much we can fo about that.
6581,Darwinism will weed those out.
6582,I’ve traveled across the US (NJ to CA &amp; back) for work and it seems to be that people just dont care anymore.
6583,Everything needs to close down in order for them to actually behave.
6584,After LA started shutting down restaurants the amount of people in the area dropped dramatically.
6585,It seemed like a ghost town
6586,I literally did not.
6587,I said that I want people to have *learned* something from all of this.
6588,"But this thread is continuing to dash my hopes of that, along with the behavior of a good portion of the country."
6589,If you’re frontline worker and tired of being overworked you should feel happy someone who could possibly persuade tinfoilers to get it at the expense of literally ONE vaccine.
6590,Yeah but those people that want normal lives then complain when we have to shutdown.
6591,"1 in every 20 Americans have had it, or 5.3% based on 17,425,857 confirmed cases and a population of 328.2 million (2019)."

6594,"That is not a listed side effect, but a shot that makes you euphoric sounds pretty good to me."
6595,But only one country was telling the rest of the world that their strategy meant they would not have a second wave.

6606,Covid patients on put onto their stomach to allow their lungs to breathe easier.
6607,"However they can't be kept only on their stomach the entire time, so each patient is on a regulated schedule to be turned onto the stomach then after x many hours they must be turned onto their back again."
6608,"This procedure is one of the most effective way to treat the patients, but it's labor and time intensive as it needs many safety check steps (ensure all of the tubes and wires are positioned properly before turning), doctor's and nurses to conduct."

6615,Yeah the same week every year (Dec 7-14) always am guaranteed to get a bad cold.
6616,"This year it was so mild, probably because I'm taking better care of myself and the masks, etc"
6617,"&gt; You might be surprised at this, but medicine is in fact available in ""poor"" countries."
6618,"You might be surprised at this, but this medicine is currently not available *anywhere* because the manufacturing capacity doesn't exist."
6619,"There's a reason why Pfizer says something like 20M by end of this year, 1 billion by end of next year."
6620,It's because they're building new production facilities.
6621,It's not as simple as wave a wand and magically India is producing enough vaccine for the world.
6622,"In terms of production capacity, though, [India is already tooling up to produce massive amounts of coronavirus vaccines."
6623,"](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/india-gets-ready-to-produce-vaccines/5699285.html)  Exactly what you want in terms of vaccines being produced cheaply for the whole world is already happening, as soon as the manufacturing capacity is there."
6624,So what exactly do you want to be different?
6625,&gt;  because obviously pharma corps sell to the highest bidder first.
6626,But here's the thing: we already paid for the development with tax payer money in many cases.
6627,"Again, good luck getting governments to finance that development using tax payer money so they can then not supply their own citizens with it."
6628,"&gt; So what is the argument in not waiving all patents and let those ""poor"" countries produce their own vaccine at a fraction of the price?"
6629,No one can produce it quickly enough yet at any price.
6630,They're working on it.
6631,"You're upset that NZ is going to donate vaccines to Fiji instead of telling Fiji, ""Sucks to be you, good luck building that vaccine factory you are incapable of building"""
6632,"I wasn't trying to downplay the number of multigenerational families, just that there are more in the situation of ""can't quit work to stay home with the kids"" than there are multigenerational families."
6633,I used to live in a city that's being hit VERY hard right now because of the very high hispanic population.
6634,It also gave me an appreciation and respect for the hispanic community for taking care of their elderly family members and not sticking them in homes.
6635,"Since all of my grandparents are now gone, the thought of a multigenerational home sounds amazing sometimes."
6636,So I'm not disrespecting that.
6637,"I just think it will be disastrous in many ways to shut down schools and I personally think there are options for multigenerational homes (such as pulling the kids out of school, which is allowed indefinitely where I live) where there are very few for working parents when they all of a sudden have to quit work to stay home with the children and everything spirals down from there."

6698,Yes falling birth rates are a risk to national security.

6717,"This fact is true, so my behavior that flows from this fact is therefore just."
6718,"However, the facts are manifold and interdependent."
6719,The low overall mortality rate doesn’t lend itself to a complete picture of the pandemic.
6720,"It doesn’t, for example, take into consideration hospitalizations."
6721,"A ton of people survive and very few (overall) die directly from the virus, but an awful lot get sick enough to require hospitalization."
6722,"They may not be dying, but the resources they use have a severe impact on the system."

7478,The leader is notorious for making bad deals and going bankrupt.
7479,His son in law is also terrible at making deals.
7480,These folks dont think even two weeks ahead of themselves they make decisions in the now and then it comes to bite them in the asses later.
7481,One of the legitimate excuses by Trump that we lacked PPE is that the storage facilities were empty at the beginning of the pandemic and that the last administration didnt resupply them.
7482,You know the storage facilities that his people were in charge of for three years by the time the pandemic hit.
7483,The entire Trump administration can be summed up by this: lack of planning.
7484,Maybe you could put a bit of tape in a contrasting colour over the cap as a sort of signal to people who don't understand it's capped that you have closed off the exhalation valve?

7492,I thought the Brazilian president didn't believe the virus exists?

7494,"I sound like a broken record in this thread, but the term isn't meant to dehumanize women or reduce us to our reproductive organs."
7495,"It's meant to include trans men and non-binary people, that's all."
7496,Not because of any phony God's blessings.
7497,It's because he is enlightened by his own intelligence.
7498,I don’t think the CDC has said that all of the symptoms need to be gone before self isolation can end.
7499,"On their website, it says that it can end 10 days from symptom onset and at least 24 hours going by without a fever (without fever reducing medicine)."
7500,"If she met the 10 days and no more fever, then from my interpretation, she can end isolation."
7501,Coughs can linger but she shouldn’t be contagious anymore.
7502,"The only thing crazier than Alex Jones' ""they're turning the frogs gay"" thing is that there was actually a lot more truth to it than you'd ever expect, though his wording was a bit off."

7507,"If she has any kind of medical care at all, they would be the best people to ask about getting her a shot as quickly and safely as possible."
7508,"The roll out is pretty aggressive for her group, so there should be some resources for her depending on where exactly you are."
7509,Not for us single folks who has been mostly single throughout our lives.
7510,Well that just sounds like a giant clusterfuck
7511,It's not supposed to reduce us down to our reproductive organs; they're just trying to be inclusive of trans men and non-binary people..
7512,"Honestly though, I deleted facebook and its like i live in a different (better) world..."
7513,"My opinion is that, if you can get it, then you should get it and the tiers, while logically they make sense, should not get in the way of vaccinating as large a percentage of the population as possible(including the previously infected)."
7514,The vaccine provides better protection than previous infection and the more people vaccinated the less it's spread.
7515,"Even if you're healthy, the virus is transmitted to to the at-risk population from people that are out and about passing it along so they would benefit from the healthy population receiving doses as well"
7516,"Ooooo, can't wait for another round of tax payer money sent to businesses and churches while poor people, students, and essential workers get fucked once again."
7517,"Mmmmm, capitalism."
7518,Restaurant activity is essentially back to where it was before the stay at home order.
7519,"Even for places that are adhering to the guidelines,  the restaurants are just handing take out orders to the customers and the customers are just sitting in the places set aside for outdoor dining."
7520,It’s allowed under the restrictions because they are not being waited upon.
7521,"Not surprising that Trump pursued such a batshit, inhumane policy."
7522,I don’t think any other President of either party would have done the same.
7523,"The minute he got vaccinated, he said: “This is what they want for us” loooooool"
7524,It's as much satire as implying that America hasn't won a war in generations.
7525,"This thread didn't start with a comment about actual wars, declared per the Constitution."
7526,It started with a comment calling the management of the pandemic a war.

7530,"It's not ""problematic"", but it does exclude a subset of the population who also have ovaries."
7531,"And what sounds more awkward ""people with ovaries"" or ""women and other people with ovaries""?"

7533,"One of my kids tested positive a while back (the rest of us were all negative somehow), and he was so frustrated."
7534,"We had to remind him Lewis Hamilton from Formula 1 did too at the same time, so no matter how careful, it can still happen."

7558,Nobody's jumping a line.
7559,Over-80s and healthcare workers are the first to get the vaccine because they are the highest risk.

7562,"The Republicans (and libertarian-types as well) claim that we don't need many regulations because companies won't hurt their workers or customers because if they did, they could get sued."

7731,COVID is a much larger issue than this rare anaphylaxis.

7740,People are overly optimistic about how long the vaccine rollouts will take.
7741,Almost every country on Earth will still have social distancing measures in place when the Olympics are due to start.
7742,I actually have been donating ready made food to the homeless!
7743,Canada is also 231 times larger than Denmark.
7744,It takes approximately a hour by train or car going from the largest city to the third largest.
7745,Whole nation is also categorized as a level 4 outbreak so there's so much community spread it would make no sense to prevent travel at this point.
7746,"Better to use the political capital in other areas (like the lockdown that's being instituted) than restricting freedom, it would cause absolute mayhem."
7747,This notion doesn’t exist outside of this subreddit.
7748,The science has been clear on asymptomatic transmission since the WHO announced it several months ago and then was attack by the anti-science faction on this sub.
7749,I tried to ignore him when he engaged in religious nuttery in the past.
7750,He's already made a career out of trying to destroy education in America.
7751,Now he's just killing people.
7752,This pandemic has led me to more hate than I knew I had in me.
7753,You’ll want to talk to your doctor about that.
7754,That's a horrible prerequisite to be allowed to exist.
7755,Lincoln should have let that half fuck off when he had the chance
7756,"I think even if we don’t have herd immunity by summer 2021, life will still go back to normal then due to pandemic fatigue and the reduced strain on hospitals."
7757,"Everybody wants to live in California, even the idiots."
7758,Why?
7759,It’s not rabies or anything.
7760,"Obviously they shouldn’t happen during covid, but why complain about an office party if you don’t like them?"
7761,Just don’t go.
7762,I sure think so.
7763,"Like underwear, you should wash it after every use."

7766,"No reason to be walking around with a mask, got it."
7767,"few countries if you exclude almost every african country, most South American countries, and the poorer Asian countries like Laos and Myanmar, as well as some of the post Soviet states."
7768,"By this time around last year, we've had a good number of pediatric influenza hospitalizations already."
7769,"Covid had an 8 month head start, and there have been very, very few hospitalizations over those 8 months."
7770,It's already accepted among pediatric faculty across the country that covid doesn't really phase the kids for unknown reasons.
7771,It's so bizarre.
7772,"On the flip side, it's been completely devastating to the adults."
7773,I'm a pediatric intensivist /faculty at a large tertiary/quaternary center in one of the most populated metropolitan regions with currently one of the worst surges in the country.
7774,We are taking overflow adult patients and covid is a wrecking ball to the adults even if they survive.
7775,For the kids?
7776,"""It was Tuesday"""
7777,"Have a look at https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend the green line is ""rapid vaccine roll out"""
7778,It's fall now.
7779,So that's almost a year.
7780,We are not even half way through this.
7781,"7 day averages in California and Tennessee have gone up by a combined 6,623 cases since Friday December 11th

7 day averages everywhere else in the US have gone down by a combined 7,030 cases since Friday December 11th"
7782,Except most Bankers are behind a bullet proof barriers
7783,Like California?
7784,Were they excluded from the analysis?
7785,UPDATE: This is cherry picked.
7786,Only one State was used.
7787,California has contradicting results.
7788,"What security issues are you imagining, that the prisoner will grab the vaccine out of the hands of the person administering it and use it as a weapon?"
7789,If there is a real risk of that happening based on a person’s prior behavior they could be shackled during the vaccination.
7790,Some states in the US still don't mandate adults to wear seatbelts.
7791,if only our fucking government officials gave as much a shit
7792,"Like you said, nobody was following what Newsom said; including himself."
7793,Nice
7794,For real.
7795,"Two weeks ago, it was ""packed sports stadiums by mid-summer."""
7796,"A couple of days ago, it was ""masks and cancelled events until 2022."""
7797,"At some other point recently, it was ""we'll basically be done vaccinating in June."""
7798,I'm honestly starting to think he might be intentionally making new shit up everyday so they finally leave him alone and stop asking him to appear on morning talk shows at like 6 AM.
7799,"Most people can’t even afford any kind of health care in the US at all, so I don’t see this happening."
7800,Thanks.
7801,We got Pfizer.
7802,the US is equipped to.
7803,Whether or not the populace is mentally equipped is another story.
7804,The man has been one of the few bright spots of this pandemic but it’s definitely not unfair to say that he has had a lot of different answers to when “normal” will come back around.
7805,Lets just wait and see at this point.
7806,"Still handled shit better than most of the states, so..."
7807,21k in L.A. today.
7808,":( Some of that is a backlog that just came in, but we're easily at &gt;14k daily now."
7809,Well then we are in for the long haul.
7810,Less than half of the people in my state say they will get it.
7811,"Whether or not it prevents transmission isn't currently known

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/pfizer-vaccine-s-effect-on-transmission-still-unknown-fda-says"
7812,Fortunately the public has little chance of receiving this particular vaccine in the next several months.
7813,Hopefully Moderna doesn’t have this issue.
7814,So it's probably fair to say that war has more ups and downs throughout the day than the virus.
7815,"And of course, you could have a one day battle that kills 100k, preceded and followed by days of a few hundred dying."
7816,The dynamics are obviously different.
7817,So... what about that?
7818,[removed]
7819,Congratulations!!!
7820,Did you get moderna or pfizer?
7821,Then you'd be wrong.
7822,Please let me know what other extra measures were put in place.
7823,they aren't STARTING until July at the earliest?
7824,What the actual?
7825,WHY.
7826,This is a bit sad.
7827,"You’re right, in order to have freedom of ideas, the person who decides the truth should be president trump not evil facebook and evil antifa."
7828,Otherwise we’d be in a dystopia
7829,That is more 1 in a 1000 testing positive in 1 day.
7830,Shocking numbers.
7831,Source on that skipping claim?
7832,That’s unfortunate and I’m glad they’re doing well now.
7833,"Still, getting the vaccine is important."
7834,"Bingo

Be honest about possible adverse reactions, but put it in the context of the pandemic killing 3k people a day in the US alone."
7835,I guarantee you the Tokyo Olympics are happening.
7836,It's over 7 months away and vaccination is already underway.
7837,I assume Japan will want vaccinated people to come in general.
7838,"Of course, the pharmaceutical industries should be applauded for the vaccines development, but I also blame the these industries for the rampant and somewhat reckless advertising here in the US that pushes medication like magic pills and injections, which they clearly are not."
7839,"The advertising for years now has given the message, ""Pop this pill and everything is better"" and in printed media it's followed by 1.5 pages of legal jumbo and side effects."
7840,So now many consumers are conditioned to believe that covid will just go away (poof) overnight with vaccinations.
7841,"Hopefully, the continuing danger of covid is still broadcasted and the pandemic is far from over."
7842,"Dangerous times indeed, and I don't know of any solution which can both stop extreme false information spreading and not involve some kind of censoring by some authority."
7843,I get why you think that’s dumb but the kill rate is different overnight...
7844,I guess I’m explaining what I meant poorly but the virus doesn’t have a clock whereas ppl in war are dying at a rate of way over 68 kills per hour at some points during the day and at other points under 68 kills per hour so it’s a false statistic not sure if that makes any more sense
7845, \&gt;I find it disheartening how little good science there has been on the efficacy of masks.
7846,"I fully agree that the benefits of masks outweigh the costs at this dire point in the pandemic based on biological plausibility, but we should know more about the effect size."
7847,These sort of problems which are not for public consumption and it shows.
7848,"If you've never worked in epidemiology, I can see why you'd think there would be dozens of peer-reviewed science experiments involving different qualities of mask and showing that these variations are more effective than others, but in reality, we just will never have that information."
7849,"When I say never, I mean as in probably not in 20 years, 40 years, maybe we'll know in 100 when technology is leagues above ours."
7850,"I work in legionnaire's disease which is spread by legionella, a waterborne bacteria."
7851,"There's no DNA fingerprinting unless it goes to court, which is super rare."
7852,"Most cases the state health department comes through with a group, takes dozens of samples, asks a million questions, gets copies of everything, then if they can't find fault in the facility, still cite the facility as the probable cause if there's no other leads."
7853,"Then the rest gets figured out in court if the patients decide to sue the facility, but at that point the damage is already done."
7854,"Legionnaire's Disease has been around since the 70s, but we still don't know what concentrations of viral load, distance, time etc make it possible for people to possibly get sick from it, and we also have very little consensus of what legionella load in the water is considered a problem."
7855,"And once you start digging around, you start seeing why."
7856,"If you get a small sample size of 5000 people together on its own, imagine trying to expose them all to covid-19, which is against ethics on its own, but then get another 5000 people and expose them for the same amount of time, with the same viral load, but with 4 different types of mask and one unmasked... We might be able to have enough people in that baseline to draw conclusions, but it may not be a good enough sample size, and then we would need to reproduce those results."
7857,"All these would cost money, time, and aside from being unethical, would be insanely irresponsible."
7858,This sort of reporting by the LA Times isn't going to convince people.
7859,"What is *really* going to convince people is a grainy video of a overcrowded hospital with people lying on the floor, shared on Facebook and Whatsapp."
7860,First you have to convince half of America there's even a COVID thing to worry about.
7861,"We may have all these rules, but there's literally no enforcement."
7862,Our rise in cases is largely people realising they can do whatever they want without getting in any sort of trouble.
7863,"Ice ice vaccine, too cold too cold..."
7864,[removed]
7865,Why are they not sending in the National Guard?
7866,"Yes, I think so, plus also the doctor would have a bit of responsibility for awareness and oversight of the use."
7867,"Even though you can get the results yourself, your doctor would likely want you to check in with the results and be consulted if you get a positive result."
7868,"A doctor can say, you really only need to take it once, you don't need to do three tests in a row or a test every day, etc."
7869,"There will be a period of time, long or short, after all restrictions are removed...where you'll go places and still see many people  wearing masks."
7870,"Day by day, fewer and fewer will wear masks, until you only see one every so often."
7871,"It'll be a thing for you when, somewhere in that period of time, you decide it's a thing for you again."
7872,Did the poster say it wasn’t?
7873,That's one way to ensure old racist cops aren't on the job.
7874,I live in the one of the cities mentioned and the same night they put in mask mandate they voted against other restrictions like bar and restaurant closures.
7875,Maybe you could do some research before spouting off.
7876,depends if he has kids
7877,Florida will see it soon too.
7878,I'd expect January to see really high growth of cases in Florida.
7879,CDC numbers tell a different story though 🤷‍♂️
7880,Also behind the EU wall.
7881,[removed]
7882,They’re still more likely to be hospitalized by COVID.
7883,"This is a rare event that might just need a night in the hospital, compared to a disease that is putting millions in the icu."
7884,"But yeah, nobody is forcing anyone to get the vaccine."
7885,You take on the risk of anaphylaxis whenever you take a medication
7886,Sorry.
7887,For enough vaccination to return to normalcy.
7888,And I meant mid fall.
7889,Sorry
7890,I don't think it would be better until April.
7891,Compared to spring 2020 the Pandemic response now is really bad.
7892,"They should just open windows, put up a dozen fans and get airflow to carry it outside where it will die."
7893,Then clean surfaces.
7894,"It's already been happening, just not reported as much."
7895,Screw that.
7896,Not getting the vaccine.
7897,Hell no.
7898,The article talks about more than 130000 shot in a week.
7899,That was done in 200 locations.
7900,1000 more locations are expected to be opened in the coming weeks.
7901,So that totals 1200 locations.
7902,If each one of those 1200 locations manage to shoot 130000 patients in a week that means that each week 780000 patients will be shot each week.
7903,And at that rate it will take 69 weeks to shoot 53.8Million in the UK.
7904,That is 80% of the population of the UK.
7905,That is about a year and a half.
7906,Yeah.
7907,:(
7908,Don't want to lose your driver's license or your professional license or your trade license or even your business license?
7909,How about your restaurant health certificate?

8001,45% of adults get the flu shot every year.
8002,"I can't attest to a vaccine that cold, but, I was given 2 shots, one in each cheek consecutively for a brown recluse spider bite and those were refrigerated and very viscous and they burned like hell and I still remember feeling like my legs were immediately losing strength as it burned down each leg."
8003,"They instructed me to lay down on the bed immediately afterwards and I didn't argue with them since I could hardly stand, after 30 minutes they checked me out and said I could go, it was still hard to walk for a few hours and by then the red streaks on my left arm up to my shoulder were starting to fade away, totally worth it given the alternative could have been death if the venom had reached my heart."

8037,Yeah I mean there’s no way we’ll convince the anti Covid vaxxers to get it so I just think we have to write them off.
8038,We don’t need to force them to get it but I think policies like making it a condition to be employed in any sort of setting where they’re interacting with people would help get people to just get vaccinated.

8317,My roommates both work in hospital and they are devastated.

8320,Why are you like this?
8321,that's really bad news.
8322,To put a bigger spot light on this problem.
8323,Even if tomorrow all of a sudden there are no more new cases.
8324,The coming 3 weeks the ICU wil stay overloaded.
8325,Yesterday The Netherlands went into a full hard lock down.
8326,Not because we have a problem with our ICU capacity today.
8327,But because the models tell us that we have an ICU peak in the first week of januari.
8328,If numbers keep increasing next week we wil have a problem in our health care system in the 2nd week of januari.
8329,"Hopefully infections wil drop next week....

tl:dnr."
8330,Infections numbers from 2 to 4 weeks ago determine the number of ICU beds needed today.
8331,We won't be able to move out and about until they do.
8332,I will cross my fingers it is sooner rather than later.
8333,Of course food deliveries are vital; that's why they are allowed to stay open during a lockdown.
8334,But they are not public-facing.
8335,"There's no justification for bumping them to the front of the line ahead of public-facing essential workers and at risk individuals when simple social distancing, mask usage, limited groups sizes, hygiene, and proper workplace protocols/procedures/equipment and setups will eliminate 99% of the risk."

8366,You combat bad ideas by spreading better ones.

8368,"With free speech comes the war of ideas and you don't win the war of ideas by force by shouting down, deplatforming, and censoring the opposing ideas because all that does it make them go underground and harbor resentment."
8369,It radicalizes people when you don't let their voice even be HEARD.
8370,"These people don't just disappear because you ban them from Twitter, and if you ostracize them from society and public discourse you're just building a larger and larger powder keg."
8371,"You cannot stomp ideas out of people with brute force, you need to win their minds with clear discourse and education."
8372,Oh and just because you don't share their opinion doesn't mean they're objectively *Wrong* either.
8373,Some people could actually gain a lot from listening and maybe admitting they don't fucking know EVERYTHING.

8467,"Also his methods absolutely suck for higher income higher debt scenarios, where your debt payoff is going to be 5-10 years."

8572,She said that basically I can contact the study and they will tell me if I am in the placebo group and allow me to drop out.

8625,In 1976 the US Supreme Court said in Estelle v. Gamble that a prison staff's “deliberate indifference” to the “serious medical needs” of prisoners is “cruel and unusual punishment” forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.
8626,So are they really very close to passing the much needed stimulus?
8627,Does it still include the 300 dollar added unemployment?
8628,"I could technically survive off of what I have already saved a couple of months, but after that it gets dicey, and I will probably be on furlough until mass vaccination (event bartender/ waiter for huge NYC cateering company)."
8629,We're already at 950 deaths per million.
8630,We're gonna smash right through 1000 per million and just keep going up for a while.
8631,Well that's convenient.

8635,There really weren’t any countries in the Western Henisphere or Europe where you can say lockdowns “worked” the way they seem to have in Asia.
8636,"Every country in those regions have more deaths per capita, by far, than any country in East Asia or Oceania."
8637,I dont think it will be that bad.
8638,"The initial vaccine will give you permanently some immunity to any future strain, so even what you catch will not be as sever as it would have been if completely novel to your immunity."
8639,Im not actually sure this virus will ever be eradicated.
8640,The impression I get is that the vaccine is to simply get covid and our immune system to make nice with each other for the future ... kind of like how after two cats mark each other with their scents they suddenly no longer want to kill each other.
8641,"Might be a useless metaphor if youre not a cat person lol, but anyway..."
8642,"I feel like what is going to happen is after the initial antibodies wear off, we will all be circulating this virus in society forever, but we wont care and vaccinations wont be as necessary, because it wont be as severe and destructive as when it was ""novel"" ever again..."

8644,The number of dead and infected (reported) was not in anyway a downplay.
8645,Asia saw those as numbers they had to avoid.
8646,Anyone who saw those numbers and thought it was no big deal has some real issues that have nothing to do with China.
8647,It was 400 dead and ramping up quickly.
8648,The alarm had already been rung but all the media and other governments could do was blast China for their authoritarian and repressive measures.
8649,They used that time and opportunity to play politics when they could have used it to prepare.
8650,No one really knows.

8654,"So what is the expectation, assuming that vaccination ramps up in the next few weeks and months, for a return to normality in the UK?"
8655,I read somewhere that they're hoping for a 'normal' summer.
8656,But how realistic is this and is there an assumption that there is a sizeable group of people who are either skeptical or anti-vaxers that may limit how quickly successful vaccination can be achieved?

8677,We should be letting employers (and individuals) pay the incremental cost of more vaccine production.
8678,It's not expensive--the US government is only paying Pfizer $19.50 per dose.
8679,"Imagine how much faster production could go at $200 per dose, which is still cheap from the employer's perspective once you consider lower healthcare costs, less sick leave taken, employee satisfaction..."

8698,The moving goalposts are an unfortunate reality when working with sentient beings.
8699,"No one can accurately predict the future, so the goals and targets need to be revisited and updated as time goes by."
8700,If scientists could count on a 100% compliance to all rules / mandates / advice then it would be easy to accurately predict what the checkpoints will be.
8701,"People are extremely unpredictable, especially in never before seen situations, so the scientists are simply guessing the best they can and updating their guesses as they go."
8702,Look at my 3 shitpost ( /s ) disclaimers!

So basically forced vaccination."
8732,Are you ok with people suing those who decided to force you to take this vaccine if the vaccine ends up hurting them more than helping?
8733,"You know, since this is a rushed vaccine and all."

8739,"When we look at timeline of events, China literally had weeks to figure out what this thing was, how it spread, got it gene sequenced, then they acted."
8740,It was discovery to action in a matter of weeks.
8741,"Meanwhile the countries that are accusing them of hiding it and not acting had the information spoon fed to them, and months later are still running around like headless chickens."
8742,"An entire year later, the best they could muster was half concocted measures while waiting and hoping for a vaccine to solve the problem for them."
8743,It’s ok sarcasm is a foreign language to some.
8744,"They are still going to vaccinate, same as any other country."
8745,Why would cooling it too much make it ineffective?
8746,Imagine if it's like syphilis and the secondary and tertiary phases of infection take a decade to manifest.
8747,Probably because of stupid studies like these being called science.

8782,Completely irrelevant to  this discussion though.
8783,"Since this   vaccine is tested on a diverse group, not just sex wise  but also ethnicity."

8789,Whether social media is doing more harm than good or more good than harm is a good debate.
8790,"Your original comment though basically blames the entire pandemic on social media, which just isn’t realistic."
8791,For one thing there are world leaders like Trump and Bolsonaro who spew misinformation and responsible media wouldn’t just ignore their comments.
8792,But more importantly there are structural problems like decades of insufficient public health funding in many countries and intense inequality forcing many people to choose between protecting their health and their livelihood.
8793,These factors don’t just go away because people aren’t using social media.
8794,"&gt;""Avoid visiting high-risk venues including clubs, restaurants, places of worship and gyms."""
8795,So they're not closing these venues while their contact tracing is apparently still trying to figure out where the new cases are?
8796,"&gt;""The new cases are mostly in the northern part of the Northern Beaches."
8797,"We are currently investigating where they all are and where they may  have been,""

Australia is in a very comfortable position right now and should do everything to make sure this cluster won't grow."
8798,I don't understand how they react to a huge new cluster threat like this in such a half-assed way.
8799,"In the worst case, it's just a matter of days for this to spiral out of control and require strict lockdowns (or give up and let it run wild like in Europe and America)."
8800,Now is the time to close all the high-risk stuff to maximize chances that they can quickly re-open after contact tracing is complete.
8801,Is your solution dancing on tiktok?
8802,"Personally, Ive been following lockdown since march."
8803,Go out only for special occasions and always disinfect hands/take a shower when I come home.
8804,I suspect there are a sizable portion of people like me but theres an even bigger portion of people who dont care anymore

8808,This tour won’t happen on 2021.
8809,I’m 100% sure of this.
8810,This is definitely what it feels like.
8811,California locked down early and hard.
8812,They went too hard at the beginning by closing beaches and hiking trails.
8813,"Then they laid out what were supposed to be clear sets of rules and tiers and colors, only to change everything around."
8814,"They also failed to setup contact tracing (they wanted folks to VOLUNTEER 40 hours per week), so the data on what activities are most risky is shaky."
8815,Then throw in some government officials gathering in large groups for expensive meals and there goes the last of their political capitol.
8816,I don't know.
8817,"My behavior (masking, distancing) has been the same throughout."
8818,But it is difficult not to have anger towards the state and local governments and start to feel like some of the rules are arbitrary.
8819,I'm not surprised the state has reached a breaking point.
8820,Meanwhile California reported about 29 cases every minute yesterday.
8821,"PS I'm aware of the population difference, you get my point."
8822,That's a good point.
8823,I would say that no one should be forced to be put in a high risk situation.
8824,"So, if you are in a high risk group, you shouldn't be forced into an high exposure job."
8825,"We should get you vaccinated anyways, and send you back to work."
8826,"Until then,  you should be on disability or UI or whatever."
8827,It ought not be that long.
8828,"If you are in a low risk group and an essential worker... Again, they should be priorities... but I'd say yes, inform them of the risks and let them choose, and pay them accordingly."
8829,That's basically my logic when I was hiring DoorDash early in the pandemic.... Let the lowest risk groups get paid well so the higher risk people don't have to be exposed.
8830,"And a lot of young people made the choice to go and hustle, and it's not the worst thing in the world."
8831,It's kind of capitalism working.
8832,"What's exploitative is just how the wages are low and shitty, but it isn't because of Covid."
8833,"I know everyone wants to be sentimental and not weigh human life, but that is the damn job of a public health official or Governor or President."
8834,"Modena vaccine is actually effective at preventing spread, they’re figuring out the Pfizer one although it looks promising"
8835,The early data makes that look very unlikely.

8927,"I don't think he'd be hated, since he's also competent, but people would be a lot quicker to call him on how bad he is at messaging."
8928,Yes it’s true California has a relatively large population compared with many countries.
8929,"However to be fair to the article, according to worldometer data, United States and Brazil were the only country’s yesterday to report higher numbers than California."
8930,A country like Brazil with over 213 million population or in other words over 5 times the population.
8931,The next highest population countries are reporting less than half the number of cases of California with populations of over double California.
8932,"Poland is the closest country in terms of population of ~37 million which are reporting a high number of cases currently ranked at tenth highest on the list of countries with a bit over 12k new cases yesterday, and it’s around 5 times lower the number of new cases compared with California."
8933,So yeah currently ~61k new cases is a high number irrespective of how big the country or state is.
8934,"Texas and Florida would also be high up the list too compared against all countries, and Tennessee is reporting numbers higher than most countries too with a relatively small population of less than 7 million."
8935,Really the top 10 most impacted US states are reporting higher numbers than many countries.

8969,Doing tests at different temperatures and various other conditions apparently takes a lot of time and they thought it was best to have the harder distribution with strict limits now and work to relax them later.
8970,The guidelines say that the vaccines have to be given in places that also have epi-pens or similar treatments at hand in case of anaphylaxis.

9035,"In March or April, the drug could be used for vaccination."
9036,That is what the Belgian top director Paul Stoffels of J&amp;J said on Belgian television.
9037,"""The final measurement for our vaccine is in sight."
9038,&gt;J&amp;J's vaccine is being developed by its subsidiary Janssen in Leiden.
9039,"According to Stoffels, a major clinical study with 40,000 people in North America, South America and Africa is in progress and an attempt is being made to achieve results in January."
9040,"He hopes to obtain approval in the United States at the beginning of March, and reasonably soon afterwards in Europe."
9041,"""By the end of March or April, we will be able to vaccinate on a large scale."""
9042,&gt;Stoffels is head of medical research at the pharmaceutical company.
9043,He said he didn't find it embarrassing that the Pfizer-BioNTech duo were more likely to bring a vaccine to market than J&amp;J.
9044,"""There are 4 to 8 billion vaccines to be produced worldwide."
9045,We spent a little more time developing a 'one-dose vaccine'.
9046,"That's important in order to be able to vaccinate on a large scale""."
9047,"At Pfizer-BioNTech, two doses are required."
9048,&gt;Stoffels also points out that J&amp;J's vaccine is easier to keep.
9049,"""Pfizer's vaccine is distributed at minus 70 degrees, our vaccine is kept between 2 and 8 degrees."
9050,"That's in the refrigerator, so to speak."
9051,It can be more easily distributed around the world.
9052,"That will have a major impact on the vaccination, also in developing countries, for example""."

9054,"If there is enough for a sixth dose, you use that vial instead of opening a new one."

9256,"Not sure about the exact numbers, but I think that the likelihood of transmission should proportional to the time you are spending together."
9257,They haven't shut down because they refuse to embrace elimination as a goal.
9258,It's nuts because it should be obvious by now that elimination is the only solution until the vaccine is widely distributed.
9259,In NZ the last time we had a single case of unknown origin they locked down the whole Auckland city centre for a day while contact tracers worked on establishing the connection.
9260,"Last time we had more than 1 case of community transmission we went to a 72 hour city-wide lockdown, extended to 3 weeks when they found 13 more cases."
9261,That's the only way to stop it.
9262,isn't enough people going to be vaccinate by then?
9263,at least the old people to reduce death.
9264,"&amp;#x200B;

9281,You've got another think coming.
9282,Yep.
9283,It will turn into survival of the fittest and the anti science crowd will not survive.
9284,Symptoms are more mild if you had the vaccine.
9285,"Then, we will have herd immunity."
9286,"Also, people who suffered from serious allergic reactions in the past have been excluded from phase 3 Biontech/Pfizer trials."
9287,So the 2 anaphylaxis cases in the UK would probably have been excluded from the trial.
9288,Yes.
9289,My mom is in the Moderna test and gets first dibs if she got placebo.
9290,She's also a doctor.
9291,The frontline worker or the selfish person?
9292,Bc I was praising and thanking u/caitmarieRN (Thanks again so much cait.
9293,I used to work with nurses.
9294,Y'all are fuckin saints/angels.)
9295,The other guy is being selfish.
9296,"Stay home, you'll get your vaccine soon enough."
9297,Don't make a frontline worker feel sorry for you because you have to wait a little longer for the vaccine.
9298,The frontline workers working 12 hr overnight shift can have my fuckin place in line.
9299,Get the fuck over it.
9300,CaitmarieRN wasn't trying to rub it in the selfish asshole's face.
9301,She/he is clearly just happy a vaccine is finally here.
9302,"Yea, if you're not a frontline work, you have to wait."

9305,Woe is me
9306,Bachelor's what?
9307,No it doesn’t.
9308,A friend had a baby at the beginning of lockdown and you can’t socialize them.
9309,Her baby thinks there’s only like 4 people in existence.
9310,You can’t do any of the normal baby classes or have play dates.
9311,Friends can’t come see your new baby.
9312,People don’t give you a bunch of those new baby gifts and toys like they normally do as they just see your kiddo randomly.
9313,People can’t come and help out that normally would.
9314,Shit’s rough and sounds 10 times harder.
9315,It’s gonna be interesting to see how all the young kids and babies development is effected from not being able to socialize at an early age.
9316,Theyll use part of it to fund law enforcement salaries.
9317,Book it.
9318,"Despite most law enforcement not changing any protocols for Covid, not being designated to special duties, etc."
9319,Which means they shouldn't qualify.
9320,It already happened in Iowa.

9324,From here on out it's on the type of choices you make.
9325,It's going to get bad for those who can't stop socializing.
9326,"From here until the vaccine is deployed, it's best to lay low, keep your distance and mask up when you're in crowds."

9332,"Also, be sure to take your vitamin D. If you're overweight, it's probably a good idea to start losing some weight."
9333,Those reactions seem somewhat more common than most other vaccines though.
9334,"Two cases in the UK after \~150k vaccinations, and 1 mild / 1 severe in Alaska after maybe a few tens of thousands (?)."
9335,"Obviously the Biontech vaccine is still A LOT safer than Covid, and I'm still getting the vaccine as soon as possible, but it's a bit disappointing."
9336,Hopefully non-Biontech vaccines will be even better?
9337,So a year?
9338,And they won’t.
9339,Because too many of them are too far gone.
9340,All of the above are possible.

9342,It's because all of these predictions are based on theoreticals.

The flu vaccine does not need to be kept at nearly -100 does it?"
9359,The Covid vaccine is also in unprecedented world wide demand as well.
9360,I do not think that the situation is similar enough to offer a valid comparison.
9361,I am not hoping for it to take longer than is planned.
9362,I am just skeptical given the numbers that September is going to be achieved.
9363,Especially since the initial planning it for only 400000 in three months.
9364,That pace implies longer than 9 months will be needed.
9365,Most people are not going to get it.
9366,"We will enter a bizarre period of time of people not wearing masks on the basis of being vaccinated, and others will follow suit not because they're vaccinated, but just because they dont give a shit."

9376,"You can still spread it, if you’ve had the vaccine and get coronavirus."
9377,Vaccine will probably be more effective when a good portion of the country has it (herd immunity) or we all get it.
9378,What sucks is the vaccine isn’t an overnight solution it’s still gonna take time.

9390,Hey wasnt this predicted by every conservative conspiracy theorist racist islamaphobe xenophobe nazi lable lable lable yadda yadda yadda that you could find?
9391,We need 70% for herd immunity.
9392,"The most quick efficient way is through vaccines but anyone with solid antibodies may have some immunity as well, minus the cases where people aren't producing antibodies and can get reinfected."
9393,"Antibodies last a very long time, like 7+ months."
9394,So that will help a little.
9395,Once we reach herd immunity it's extremely effective at diminishing the spread.
9396,"edit: Vaccine is still not approved for children, so with schools etc that may affect things slowing down."
9397,"Yeah, we're not close to herd immunity and we won't be there by summer, even with crazy post-holiday spread."
9398,Herd immunity requires 70% infection and we only have confirmed 4%.
9399,They work in an intensive care unit for COVID patients at a hospital.
9400,They get priority because (1) they are essential for helping people who are at risk like your family and (2) they are at a much higher risk for catching and/or spreading the disease.
9401,It would be really selfish to think that you or your family should have priority over someone on the frontlines who is helping people stay alive.
9402,&gt;They are paying for doses to be manufactured.
9403,"No,  they are paying for doses delivered."
9404,"For NZ in particular, they have *advance* agreements with the likes of Janssen or Novavax."
9405,"These agreements are first of all conditional on the vaccine actually being effective, and then approved in NZ."
9406,No money will change hands before that point.
9407,And even then if won't change hands if it can't be delivered in the required quantities.
9408,"&gt; to justify screwing poor countries

That's some next-level alternative reality stuff, buddy."
9409,What's screwing poor countries is rich countries cornering the market and insisting on their patents.

9416,2 kids or less per couple BTW is ideal.
9417,Sacré bleu!
9418,"/s, by the way."
9419,"I'm assuming NZ will reach herd immunity via vaccination by end of summer at the latest, at which point it would make sense to reopen."
9420,17 is equivalent to 850 in the USA.
9421,"The USA has 250,000 every day so..."
9422,I think it's about a realistic timeline for getting all of the vulnerable populations vaccinated.
9423,"It's not just the 60+ crowd, it's also younger people with pre-existing conditions, those living in congregate care, folks in education settings, etc."
9424,"It's possible some places will have all of those populations vaccinated by the summer, but given how shabbily this whole thing has been handled thus far, it doesn't seem super likely, in the states anyway."
9425,[deleted]
9426,I think the difference would be being able to go back to normal with a high but manageable number of infections vs being able to go back to normal without the virus being present in the community at significant levels at all.
9427,"It hung on whether only symptomatic people spread the virus, which was generally assumed to be the case before late March."
9428,Case studies of pre-symptomatic spreading were dubious or thought to be rare.
9429,"Under this assumption, you would wear a mask to protect yourself, and if it's a surgical mask or N95, that's one less for a healthcare worker."
9430,"There was also a lot of emphasis on not touching your face back then, and fiddling with masks could potentially backfire."
9431,Reusable cloth masks weren't really on people's radars back then.
9432,"As soon as it became clear that it was infectious before symptoms appeared, the narrative changed completely."
9433,"Now you wear a mask primarily to protect others, which a cloth mask would be reasonably good at even if the holes are larger than small droplets."
9434,"On [Mar 27](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm) and [Apr 1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm), the CDC journal published 2 convincing articles demonstrating presymptomatic/asymptomatic transmission."

9443,Meanwhile several EU countries top the USA in deaths per million... are those places also hell holes?

9465,Can someone explain the reasoning to me.
9466,I may be missing something here.
9467,I thought the Pfizer vaccine was mRNA based and therefore didn’t create immunity in a population rather it prevents the disease from developing.
9468,People can still transmit the disease.
9469,(?)
9470,Therefore this type of vaccine (given the low mortality in the general population) would make sense as one to be given to the vulnerable only.
9471,Nonsense.
9472,"It's not a money problem, it's a logistics problem primarily, and one of quality assurance."
9473,Read the article.
9474,"Pfizer hasn't even made one of those types of vaccines before, and they had to start establishing the supply chain at a time when the vaccine wasn't even fully developed yet."
9475,"You can't just go and order additional billions of gallons of, say, sterile liquid as a base for your vaccine."
9476,Where is this supposed to come from?
9477,"You have to find new suppliers, you have to check the quality, and so on."
9478,I disagree.
9479,Everyone has been following the rules.
9480,Thanksgiving travelers screwed things up
9481,"I think it's down to the kind of population they have: naturally more reserved, decent living conditions, socially cohesive and trusting of authority, educated and relatively affluent."
9482,"The ""best"" person for spreading Covid is an extrovert who loves hugging people, lives in cramped accommodation with others, but who doesn't care about people he or she doesn't know personally, distrusts authority, lacks the critical thinking skills to differentiate between good science and conspiracy theory, and is broke so can't take time off work or make space at home."
9483,That's not a moral judgement; it's just the way of maximising the quality and quantity of contacts that could lead to spreading Covid.
9484,&gt; Please.
9485,Read this one more time.

9583,"The reason is that while being naturally infected with the virus gives you some degree of immunity and protection, it’s not necessarily targeted."
9584,"The vaccines are optimized specifically to neutralize the virus and its infection and how it causes disease, whereas with your own natural infection, you will produce antibodies, but they’re more scattershot."
9585,"They’ll target some of the parts of the virus that cause infection, but they’ll target other parts that don’t necessarily interfere with its reproduction cycle."
9586,"So it’s very likely that most people, even if they have gotten sick with this, it would be useful for them to still get vaccinated."
9587,"&amp;#x200B;

* How is it possible to still spread the coronavirus after someone’s been vaccinated?"
9588,"...It’s likely that even after your body gets coached to fight off this infection, the infection might be so low grade that it doesn’t really do anything."
9589,"It doesn’t even trigger the alarm bells in your body, but it still allows you to spread the virus to other people."
9590,And that low level of infection or transmission still poses a risk.
9591,etc.

9633,"We'll have a lot of recent vaccinations, unfortunately a lot of recent infections, and warmer outdoors weather in the northern half of the country."

9657,Was kind of surreal seeing everyone so happy waiting to get a shot.
9658,Everyone came out smiling.
9659,The big question now is how long will the protection from a COVID-19 vaccine last?
9660,there are a lot of factors the impact on the length of protection.
9661,"These include the incubation period of the infection, the site and rate of mutation of the virus, how our immue system responds to the virus and mounts its response."
9662,Take Influenza for example.
9663,"It has the following:

1."
9664,"A very short incubation period requiring our immune system to have a recent memory of the virus
2."
9665,Rapidly mutating surface antigens making it partially unrecognisable in a short period of time.
9666,With the slower incubation period of COVID-19 longer protection may be possible.
9667,If the spike protein remains largely recognisable despite mutations that could also help extend the effective period of the vaccination.
9668,The big question mark at the moment is the cases where people have been reinfected with COVID-19.
9669,At this stage we will still need to wait and see.
9670,Fauci was presented as a respectable and responsible health professional.

9689,"Imagine without this lady, there would be situation when china had suffered like usa right now."

9715,"So many different packages brought to desk, so much childishness on his behalf."
9716,"&gt;  Fauci told CNBC that the National Institute of Health is waiting for their doses of vaccine to arrive, and he will get inoculated publicly “to serve as an example of the importance of getting vaccinated.”   

We don't need Dr. Fauci or Bill Gates getting vaccinated publicly ( Gates made a similar statement)."
9717,"We need people that are role models for the vaccine hesitant - Celebrities, NBA stars, NFL stars, rappers, country music stars, Youtubers, far right politicians and far left politicians, the Kardashians."
9718,"UPS and FedEx are literally bumping amazon packages so they can transport the vaccine, the problem is it can't be manufactured fast enough."

9721,"&gt;0 colds in the entire year, they work

Why hasn't covid-19 been stopped, then?"
9722,Being an island helps but you definitely need good consistent leadership and a population willing to work together.
9723,Agreed.
9724,"In some states (mine, CA), EMTs aren't allowed to give epinephrine unless the patient already has one prescribed (in which case EMTs can ""assist"" them with their own), so I'd even make the argument that a pharmacist would be a better place than having EMTs on standby."
9725,Source: I'm an EMT in CA
9726,Presumably any viron which has a mutated spike protein which can't infect humans (or can't infect them as well) would die off in the first generation.
9727,"However, if a mutation allowed it to bypass COVID-19 immunity, then that would be really bad."
9728,"Luckily, mutations of the former kind are much, much more likely."
9729,NZ did have masks and were encouraged to wear them (most did in any slightly confined situation) but it was not really enforced by anything beyond other people silently judging you for being a selfish cunt and not being part of the team.
9730,Masks are still 'mandatory' on public transport in Auckland but is rarely enforced as everyone wears them on all the trains and buses I use.
9731,No social distance or crowd size limitations for close to half a year now (I think it's been about that long).
9732,They didn't even predict the worst case with covid lol.
9733,"Covid has been horrible, not denying that, but there were people saying 10 million deaths in America, total breakdown of society, no food or water, etc, back in March."

9736,What kind of MONSTER snubs the dog?!
9737,?
9738,Thing is right now most people being vaccinated aren’t out and about exposing people anyway.
9739,It is really going to be phase 3 or 4 where the general public is going to be vaccinated and to me that is when restrictions will be lifted.
9740,But it’s really a wait and see thing at this point.
9741,Great.
9742,"""Normal""."
9743,I suppose it's the best they can do.
9744,We don't know.
9745,The virus has barely been around a year and we don't have a mean number on how long immunity takes to fade.
9746,However even at this point reinfection is rare

9756,Do you realize that not everyone is getting vaccinated on the same day?
9757,We can’t pull off having separate restrictions for the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
9758,"With vaccines becoming widely available in the spring, it will take until the fall for enough people to have been vaccinated that we can remove restrictions for everyone."
9759,"&gt;When FOX 2 arrived at the tenant’s home Monday afternoon the landlord was there, but would not answer our questions before driving off."

9762,"They'd be doing even worse if people we free to fill up a high risk area, since there's air circulation, masks being take off, and reduced social distancing if there's no limit on capacity."
9763,The only time to not at least limit capacity is if the virus is virtually not an issue.
9764,I trust Fauci!

9768,The part about how the family would have to quarantine for two weeks “out of safety” was something else all together.
9769,They were willing to get on a plane and then willing to potentially risk the safety everyone they know by not self isolating.

9783,Sorry I meant if you take the two shot regiment the first year.
9784,Would you have some type of immunity even without another yearly shot?
9785,Or is this what people will be studying post vaccination?
9786,A large portion of America does not have health insurance.
9787,The flu shots are free with insurance.
9788,"Without, it’s still cheap, around $40, but a lot of Americans also live paycheck to paycheck and don’t have an extra $40."

\- She does not know if people may go around spreading asymptomatically despite vaccination

\- Women unknowingly may be pregnant and effects unknown

\- 2-3 more months would allow more data on these issues as well as better rule out delayed Dengue-like ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) as being possible

\- not enough minorities in the testing group

The interviewer was concerned about:

\- The population that volunteers already is more careful, while in the real world, a large percentage think the virus is fake and are exposed to more virus on average"

9919,"All OP said is that Fauci should stop answering this question if he doesn’t actually know the answer, which is a completely fair and reasonable criticism."
9920,It’s not like he called Fauci a moron.
9921,Pandemic fatigue.
9922,Man Americans love making up mental illnesses.
9923,There's a good chance that more people will die on the way to get their shot than from a reaction from it.
9924,"Too bad this is neither, huh?"
9925,"On any given day in the United States, 

around 7,800 people die"

9927,"From my memory, used to be almost an exclusively liberal thing before Trump co-opted it."
9928,What vaccine has skipped as much standard regulation as this vaccine?
9929,Why are we limiting it to 50 years?
9930,"Just because the rushed polio vaccine disaster wasn't recent, it doesn't mean there aren't valid lessons to learn."
9931,"They asked a very legitimate question, and although we think we know hope this vaccine works, a few months of data is most enough to say it is 100% safe long term."
9932,Ohh gotcha.
9933,Yeah in that case idk.
9934,That’s the problem with undocumented immigrants.
9935,"But they can still pay for it, it’s like $30 and they don’t ask for ID."

9965,"He’s coming across as entitled like he thinks since Spring was said at some point, he’s “owed” normal by Spring, and the timeline changing is unacceptable and a personal attack against his sensitivities."
9966,Anaphylactoid doesn’t mean less severe.
9967,"“If using this newer terminology, “nonimmunologic anaphylaxis” would replace the older terminology which described these reactions as “anaphylactoid”."

9994,It went away with a little bit left over.
9995,The second time they were able to give me prednisone and acyclovir and it went away faster.
9996,It was /never/ about it being over.
9997,It was to minimize hospital impact.

**In-flight Deaths During Commercial Air Travel**

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/371368](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/371368)

Do passenger deaths occur during commercial air travel?"
10056,"If so, how often and from what causes?"
10057,We reviewed information reported to the International Air Transport Association on in-flight deaths that occurred during commercial air travel for the eight years between 1977 and 1984.
10058,"Of the 120 airlines in the International Air Transport Association, 42 carriers reported deaths during these eight years."
10059,"A total of 577 in-flight deaths were recorded, for a reported average of 72 deaths per year."
10060,"Deaths occurred at average rates of 0.31 per million passengers, 125 per billion passenger-kilometers, and 25.1 per million departures."
10061,"The majority of those who died were men (66%, 382/577) and middle-aged (mean age, 53.8 years)."
10062,"Most of the individuals (77%, 399/515) reported no health problems prior to travel."
10063,Physicians aboard the aircrafts offered medical assistance for 43% (247/577) of the deaths.
10064,"More than half of the deaths (56%, 326/577) seemed to be related to cardiac problems."
10065,Sudden unexpected cardiac death was the cause of death in 63% (253/399) of the apparently healthy people and seems to be the major cause of death during air travel.
10066,These observations support the initiation of programs to train cabin personnel in the skills of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the use of automatic external defibrillators.
10067,you know how concentration works right?
10068,"if the first mL has x lipids, the last mL would have how many?"
10069,Thank you for your response.
10070,So it’s a toss up?
10071,I’m going err on the side of caution and stand by my source and my statement.
10072,"And Bakersfield in Kern County and Devin Cow Nunes District, and the upper eastern counties."
10073,"If the virus would go through like the gas emitted from the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones and the Ark of the Covenant, California would quickly return to open shops, open schools and back to sun, sun, sun..."
10074,LOL.
10075,Was this supposed to be hopeful because it legit made me cry.
10076,"""If"" and ""Mid-fall""???"
10077,I can't.
10078,[removed]
10079,"That statement it false, there are plenty of places domestically you can’t go without showing papers."
10080,"What *exactly* did ""Operation Warp Speed"" do?"
10081,Which research programs did they fund?
10082,A “jab” sounds more violent than an injection.
10083,“TAKE THAT!” (Jab).
10084,I guess a lot dying will do that.
10085,Especially when it hits your home town.
10086,"I thought for a second the surprise would be something morbid, like dead cats or some shit."
10087,I dunno I'm weird...

10089,There’s one in NYC for turtles
10090,Are they just not testing enough and there are actually much more cases than confirmed?
10091,"That would seem like one logical explanation, but I don't know what the testing situation is over there"
10092,I've read the same but I bet in practice it will be covered by insurance 100%.
10093,I do worry what will happen for anyone uninsured.
10094,There better be a free option for them...
10095,This is so ridiculous.
10096,The US is the richest country on the planet.
10097,Get Amazon to ship that shit to every hospital in the US and get the ball rolling.
10098,Jesus
10099,One in the USA as well today.
10100,Still worth getting it.
10101,almost..
10102,"I think previous case record was 247,414 - but 246,541 is very very close"
10103,"cool, I'm ok with this."
10104,better to have too much than too little.
10105,the important thing is that the FDA approved using it on someone else.
10106,letsssss gooooo!
10107,It is very dense though.
10108,Denser than almost all cities in the US.
10109,Why are you such a hater?
10110,You haven’t read anything I’ve posted.
10111,I don’t care what false claims you want to make though I worry for your sanity.
10112,California much like is neighbor AZ is falling apart and busting at the seams
10113,Well that’s really unlikely.
10114,Someone will have something somewhere.

10122,"They can’t teach, they can’t assess or do my charting."
10123,They can’t pass meds.
10124,They can’t look up and interpret lab results.
10125,I'm honestly torn over whether that is a good or a bad thing.
10126,"On one hand, of fucking course the placebo group should get the real vaccine."
10127,They risked their lives to ensure that the vaccine is safe and effective.
10128,Keeping them from getting the vaccine at this point is inhumane and cruel.
10129,"On the other hand, there is valuable science in keeping the control group unvaccinated."
10130,"If any late-term effects are discovered, the placebo group could be pivotal in determining who is most affected and how to treat the effects."
10131,Their sacrifice could save even more lives than the virus has already taken.
10132,My moral compass is askew over this one ever since my wife and I argued about it the other night.
10133,"She chose the former argument, I chose the latter."
10134,I just don't know which is the better outcome.
10135,"Maybe I'm heartless, but most vaccines take *years* to be approved and the placebo groups are able to be observed for exponentially longer time frames than we've had for the current batch of vaccines."
10136,"If the placebo groups are allowed to be vaccinated, we're losing a valuable avenue of science in the event there are long-term effects from any of the vaccines."
10137,"Looking like May 2021, and by that I mean August 2021, by which I mean October 2021."
10138,"Listen, I'm the same person who convinced America and the US Surgeon General ""Masks Don't Work"" early on because ""lack of data"" knowing full well that every similar virus is inhibited through mask wear."
10139,I'm already a god.
10140,"Anyway, by December 2021, if everything goes well, might seem some normality."
10141,By December I mean MAY 2021 SYKE

10157,"I often wonder what contact tracing looks like in Europe and America, but I don't know how to find out."
10158,I live in Sydney and the contact tracing seems to be pretty good.
10159,"Granted, numbers have been so low that it's very manageable."
10160,"I know a bunch of people who say they are not getting vaccinated, not because they don’t believe COVID is real or serious, but because they don’t want to find out what the potential long term side effects are (the hard way)."
10161,"While I understand this to an extent, the incredibly low possibility of some extremely rare side effect (based on other vaccines in general) is not enough to deter me from getting vaccinated."
10162,There’s no way we would have had a kid this year.

10196,California has one of the lowest hospitals capacities per capita of all 50 states.

10198,"Florida still has many more deaths and cases per capita, which shows that more people will get infected w/o lockdowns, but they have at least managed to spread those infections out over time which isn't overwhelming their healthcare system (although it did get pushed close to the breaking point over the summer)"

Then throw in the vaccine and again the sheer amt of people who've already had COVID...it'll be hard to see these numbers getting into the 500k range"

10218,Well that is becoming less and less likey the more days that go on.
10219,Seems like some person's opinion and it's not based on the findings of a vaccine research team
10220,"Some patients in the U.K. have had anaphylaxis reactions to the vaccine, but they don’t know if it was related to the vaccine or maybe something in the syringe or plunger."
10221,"Either way, I’m sure they will have a more definitive answer by the time it’s my turn for a vaccine."
10222,"I had no idea that hairy, chubby guys were in such high demand."
10223,"It can, which is why each individual case is sent to a medical examiner (or doctor) to determine cause of death - they will look at a number of pieces of information to determine whether the virus significantly contributed or if the victim was likely to have suffered that fate regardless."
10224,"In the larger picture, deaths from those with a Covid diagnosis can be compared to those in the same risk group without a Covid diagnosis to determine how much more likely you are to die from these causes when you are infected."
10225,"By using both of these methods, you can determine that Covid was actually the cause both in general and in a specific case."
10226,"The vaccine story here omits this information by necessity, because it would fall apart otherwise (not that it doesn't also fall apart under other scrutiny)."
10227,"Phase 3 trials already show that death by any number of ailments is not significantly affected by having the vaccine (and wide distribution is effectively ""phase 4 trials"" - they continue to compare adverse effect rates to the general population to look for potential issues)."
10228,"Also, a medical examiner can usually determine whether or not the vaccine was a contributing factor, so until there is an official death certificate with the vaccine listed as a cause, this is all hearsay and supposition that does not track with what we currently know about the vaccine, and hence should be looked at with an abundance of skepticism."
10229,"The fact that multiple accounts are apparently passing the same exact story off as their own, and the response from the  Alabama Department of Public Health pretty much puts the nail in the coffin on this."
10230,"Since the vaccine is going to most vulnerable populations first, am I wrong in saying that we could hope to see a significant easing on hospital ICUs in the US by February?"
10231,"While I understand we’re still very far from “normalcy,” not all doses of the vaccine are equal in terms of reducing strain on ICUs right?"
10232,These early doses will likely have the strongest effect on limiting severe cases?
10233,Or am I missing something?
10234,"The risk of severe symptoms and severe outcomes decreases but this shouldn't be an excuse to only get one shot 

Think of it like 1 shot may turn it into simple cold like symptoms, 2 shots will completely prevent any noticeable symptoms"
10235,"I mean, that’s good enough for you but I’m probably not gonna be able to get it until the very end so... please don’t test your theory out on me"
10236,"The virus is everywhere, not just prisons."
10237,Fucking christ.
10238,Projection (and probably a reasonable one at that) puts us closing in on Civil War/Spanish Flu levels of death.
10239,And now Im angry again.
10240,Who knows what the real numbers are.
10241,"Florida is engaged in a blatant cover up right now involving a gestapo style raid on a whistleblower, and I'm sure it's not the only state that's pulling one."
10242,The second one in particular
10243,Should have taken the Florida route and opened up completely
10244,"If most people, that is of the rich haven't hoarded it for their friends I don't think I'll see this vaccine until late summer"
10245,"Yes, this was in the spring I believe."
10246,I think local authorities actually barricaded their doors because they wouldn’t close.
10247,"Yes but it’s not like condoms, pills, coils have suddenly disappeared :)

Also, who the hell wants to have a baby when it was plausible this shitshow would have lasted for years"
10248,Not an issue.
10249,More and more people want it every day.
10250,"Back in September, only 50% of Americans."
10251,"After Pfizer's announcement of the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, that went up to 58%."
10252,"About a week or two ago, that went up to 61%."
10253,Gallup polled 63% the next day.
10254,"A week later, it was polled 68% of Americans wanted to get the vaccine."
10255,They polled 71% the other day.
10256,We need 75% of Americans to get the vaccine to establish herd immunity.
10257,"You'll be the first person to ever say ""Bing it"" instead of ""Google it"""
10258,Which ones?
10259,I had strep and flu at the same time a few years ago.
10260,Some people just have terrible luck.
10261,Heard it yesterday from my location’s study director.

10268,"We had 0 cases in Victoria (Australia) for more than 40 days now, masks are no longer mandated but strongly encouraged in closed spaces, still 99% of people are wearing them inside shops, people carry their masks in their bags, pockets and wear them indoors, so far no new cases."
10269,"Yes, we had a strong lockdown between August/October, but the use of masks made the difference to stop asymptomatic transmission, we just assumed anybody could be infected (including ourselves) so wearing masks was the way to protect others and protect ourselves."
10270,It worked.
10271,"Yes, all three measures need to go hand in hand: hygiene-social distancing-masks."
10272,All the current active cases in our state are now travellers in mandatory quarantine.
10273,Because virus gonna virus.
10274,Some things are out of our control and the virus won't be eradicated by our weak NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions).
10275,"Perhaps California could have hired medical experts from Cambodia, which has had ZERO deaths from COVID."
10276,They must really know what they're doing over there in Cambodia.
10277,"This, when numbers drop that is when restrictions will drop."
10278,It will be obvious then that vaccines are working.

10288,You must have ice running through your veins.
10289,I’m not finding this from a reliable news site though.
10290,"Not saying it is false, but passenger tweets are not a reliable news source."
10291,When did you hear that?
10292,I’m in the Moderna trial and haven’t heard anything.
10293,Interesting due to the negativity you’re contributing to this thread and the fact that my comment summed up the experience and paperwork up until now in my trial.
10294,I wish you a healthy season!
10295,Why is that disqualifying?
10296,Are they not sure of the interaction between the two?
10297,Hope you are able to get it asap!
10298,"Key words: ""as people get vaccinated."""
10299,"Thing is, such a large chunk of the population has to get vaccinated for any real ""getting back to normal"" to happen."
10300,"The reason people take the vaccine is to keep themselves from getting super ill. You continue to wear the mask and social distance because you are still contagious to others, even with the vaccine."
10301,And there is no consolation prize as they have already decided the next two summer olympics after.
10302,Tokyo would have to wait until 2032 to use their new olympic buildings for their intended purpose.
10303,The average loss of life at the Battle of Normandy was 21yrs old also.
10304,"Also add onto that, dating is pretty much non existent at this point, so we will probably see far less marriages over the next few years."
10305,One of the safest vaccines out there.
10306,It’s not questioning vaccines.
10307,It’s how fast it’s been acceptable vs someone who either had it or wants to see more mass trials before it’s safe.
10308,I care less about when Tokyo can host it next and more about the athletes.
10309,"Speaking as an American who ran track collegiately at a fairly high level, this is our super bowl - it is what every athlete dreams of competing in."
10310,"Without the olympics people like Usain Bolt, Simone Biles, and Michael Phelps don’t become household names."
10311,We’ve seen all major sports leagues make in work and have their athletes play.
10312,"It would suck for all the athletes who compete in things like track, swimming / diving, wrestling, volleyball, gymnastics, and countless others who couldn’t participate after postponing 2020 and living in a world 8 months after the introduction of vaccines which should be better than the current environment pro sports operate in."
10313,It’s a once every 4 years thing and for certain athletes like gymnastics their window is so small.
10314,I think there are about a million things america needs to fix but its just insane to pretend like we don't have the most developed national logistical system in the world.
10315,I can get a load of pretty much anything anywhere only limited by how fast trucks can physically travel or planes can fly.

10324,"That being said, compared to other places I lived like Germany, Canada has a lot of major health and social issues... Canada is just a slightly better version of the US... don't model a new system after Canada's, look at Germany or some other place that has their shit together instead (still have zero intention to live in the US over Canada though)."

10345,"I think we need to look into his exact wording, which is ""return to *normal*""."
10346,This in my mind means the very very end of the effects of covid.
10347,"No restrictions, no masks, etc."
10348,"Other aspects will have to start coming back in phases well before then, so there's definitely reason to be optimistic."
10349,Luckily that's the same population that is overwhelmingly asymptomatic or downright resistant to COVID
10350,"Can’t go to school, can’t go back to work until you’ve had it, verified by the CDC."
10351,This is the only way we a large portion of people to take the vaccine.

10353,People here aren't going to understand that bankruptcy of small landlords results in consolidation.

10364,Careful reading the headline!
10365,This is talking about the virus and not the vaccine!
10366,The vaccine cannot do this.
10367,"Given how well it spreads in humans, this isn't that surprising."
10368,I was wondering how it could persist in bats over winter.
10369,8% of Americans don't.
10370,That's nearly 30 million people.
10371,100% of people who receive the vaccine will die at some point in the future!

10390,You think they couldn't buy doses from moderna and the other producers of the vaccine?
10391,I can't imagine those companies would turn him down if he was planning on buying some to vaccinate his employees.
10392,"They might not get it first, but they could almost certainly buy a batch of it."
10393,good luck with that
10394,Just blame it on COVID and start distributing the vaccine and rebuilding.

10400,This will just be another one piled on to the existing laundry list OP listed out.
10401,Didn't he say just last week that it would be late spring/early summer?
10402,why?
10403,no other country allows people to come in illegally.
10404,they shouldn’t get any benefits because they’re ILLEGAL.
10405,it isn’t even a question of racism or not.
10406,"a white person, black person, anyone should get nothing if they’re illegal."
10407,just come into America correctly.
10408,not that hard.
10409,"I want that vaccine but I have asthma, and a gluten intolerance as far as I know but that’s it.. wonder if it’d be safe?"
10410,"Umm, do you mean when 85 - 90% of participants will become effectively immune for the next six to eight months."
10411,??
10412,?
10413,"I live in California, I just walked in and got a free flu shot in CVS in 5 minutes, did nothing but ask for it."
10414,Same as I did last year.
10415,This year I also had to sign a form saying I didn’t have COVID though.
10416,"Hey, I also quit biting my nails this year."
10417,"But that's mostly because I painted my nails and loved how it looked, and I never stopped painting them."
10418,Now I take care of my nails.
10419,Substitute one obsessive behavior for another.
10420,Moderna initial data says it appears to be good at preventing infection/transmission but we need more data.
10421,THAT will be the magic bullet to beat this thing.
10422,And what about people who have compromised immune symptoms so they can't get the vaccine and already have to deal with a higher risk from Covid.
10423,"Its not as simple as, anti-vacs idiots are only putting themselves at risk."
10424,They're endangering the people who can't get the vaccine on medical grounds.
10425,"It's a valid question, but when specifically talking about long term vaccine damage, historically that seems to boil down to contaminated or batches with live viruses."
10426,"Experts more familiar with how the vaccine works also suggest that theoretically, having an allergic reaction is the most the vaccine can do, and i'm unfamiliar with anyone dying from an allergic reaction to a vaccine."
10427,It's unlikely.
10428,Truly asymptomatic people don't spread it as much.
10429,Pre-symptomatic people may.
10430,We don't have data showing that people who have recovered can spread Covid.
10431,Immunity from the vaccine is likely better than being infected.
10432,"All together, it seems likely that we will soon find out that vaccinated people will not be able to spread Covid."
10433,"This may change, I'm willing to accept new information on this."
10434,"Siri, whats the percentage of anti-vaxers in america, whats the percentage of people who don't believe in Covid, and whats the overlap of those two groups?"
10435,That is an interesting comparison.
10436,I agree with you.
10437,"People need order, need structure, need definitive answers even if they don't exist."
10438,"That is a trait of leaders in government or business, acting as if they have all the answers even if they don't."
10439,I'm sure you can figure it out.
10440,I have faith in you.
10441,But their education!!!
10442,"Adults are perfectly capable of making decisions for themselves, blind trust in anything (especially authority) typically doesn't end well."
10443,2021?
10444,That is a good point.
10445,Being pessimistic is part of his job.
10446,"Unlike Trump, who was wildly optimistic and said COVID would be gone by Easter of this year"
10447,"usually with a vaccine you'd want a little more assurance than ""fingers crossed"""
10448,Did masks work for SARS CoV 1 (2003)?
10449,Would they possibly be effective in any capacity for SARS CoV 2???
10450,The world may never know
10451,What will be the cost for those uninsured?
10452,"Your link supports his comment, not yours."
10453,Kids are comparatively *more* expensive in rich countries than they are in poor countries.
10454,Nurse in Alaska just had a severe allergic reation to the vaccine and she had no history of allergies.

10456,Is any medicine 100% safe?
10457,Is 100% safety a realistic expectation?
10458,Some things will never fully recover.
10459,Like buffet restaurants.
10460,No.
10461,At least in ontario you must be a legal resident for 3 months.
10462,Canada doesn't really have the same issue with huge amounts of undocumented workers.
10463,Our labor laws are more strict limiting their work options and we have the entire US between us and South/central America.
10464,Our medical system would definitely provide care but they would need to pay some amount most likely.
10465,"I doubt a hospital would really try hard to go after someone though, especially someone with no legal status or property."
10466,Yea I can get this year's flu vaccine in the US at probably 10-15 locations within a few miles of my place.
10467,"Pharmacies, grocery stores, hospitals, urgent care facilities and I'm not in a very large city."
10468,I think the pace in which the vaccine will be distributed will be impressive.
10469,"Not overnight, of course, but impressive."
10470,By mid-fall it will be late-winter.
10471,"By late-winter, it will be early-summer."
10472,Giving covid to antivaxxers because you're vaccinated asymptomatic is a feature not a bug
10473,Lmao good.
10474,One politician down.
10475,Many more to go.
10476,"I'm now a huge believer in masks, and will likely continue to wear one when in close proximity to \*shudders\* the public."
10477,This is the first year I haven't got a sinus infection and I'm counting it as a win.
10478,But my grandma dude!!
10479,People need to come to the realization that people die - everyone will.
10480,"I hope these people who are hell bent on saving their grandparents actually spend time with them in the future, because seemingly no one goes out of their way to but now all of a sudden they want to act like they cared."
10481,And OP's article also includes most people getting vaxxed.
10482,What's the difference to my first article?
10483,Or for not giving a cut of any of the winnings to the executives.
10484,"They said to defund the police unions, not defund the police."
10485,This is a **critical** distinction.
10486,A lot of the fuckery of law enforcement is due to their unions.
10487,"It's not a full solution, but it's a good start."
10488,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you missed the nuance.
10489,Once all the vulnerable are vaccinated everything can and should open up.
10490,You ignorant buffoon
10491,LOL ya that's phrased weird.
10492,i should say: obviously unlikely
10493,Can I get a stimulus check if I take the sloppy second dose?
10494,"I mean, we already have these."
10495,At least the vaccine would keep the teachers’ families safe.
10496,"If society keeps saying that it wants kids in schools, they need to vaccinate the staff."
10497,"Teachers, custodians, and support."
10498,"This should have been the ""slogan"" (or w/e you want to call it) from day 1."
10499,Defund police unions.
10500,"And judging by the responses, people seem to not understand your comment."
10501,"I wasn't trying to minimize anything you've gone through, just to empathize."
10502,I'm sorry you missed your college graduation and in no way did I mean to come off as privileged.
10503,Everyone has suffered this year in different ways and I don't think that getting upset at someone who's gone through their own difficult times will help you cope with your own hardships.
10504,Right and then they get angry that the “magic date” of normalcy keeps getting pushed back.
10505,"Not a medical person, but just saying."

10515,Any word on vaccine risks for asthmatic individuals?
10516,The hospital I work at has set aside 1500 vaccines for volunteers in the medical center.
10517,"While I wouldn’t recommend volunteering just for the vaccine, it may be something worth looking into if she has the time"
10518,Old normal + more hand sanitizer
10519,"There's less than 0 chance that people don't force things back to normal, vaccine or no, herd immunity or no."
10520,"The only reason things could be delayed is if the government did sweeping debt and rent forgiveness plans and started sending out checks to the masses as if they were all individual mega corporations, but we haven't seen a peep about any of that happening."
10521,"Come 2021, after the first shots roll out, people are bunching together and ditching their masks."
10522,This whole thing has been an exemplary showcase of the greed and incompetence of governments and businesses.
10523,That's literally not how vaccines work (herd immunity) and your ignorance about this topic is precisely WHY we should listen to the professionals.
10524,69k...only a matter of time
10525,"Trust your parents, they're doing a good job!"
10526,There are plenty of places in the US that offer free flu shots even without isurance.
10527,"Yes, you will have to make the effort to find one, but they do exist."
10528,Dr. Fauci said there was no reason to wear masks and that Americans didn't need to change their everyday lives at the end of February.
10529,You pay for universal health care through taxes as well
10530,This makes sense.
10531,"It's not the same thing due to distance, but when dealing with the public there should be no thinking involved, just very clear guidelines and examples"
10532,"So...2025, then?"
10533,69k...only a matter of time
10534,Lol what?
10535,"You would get the vaccine because your a normal human being that cares about your fellow humans, right?"
10536,I just don't think soon applies if it means by spring.
10537,It'll be a rough next four months.
10538,And I will still be wearing my mask after my vaccine.
10539,I just don't have good faith in other people anymore.
10540,Yh it's gone down from that 50k cases a day but 10-15k is still high compared to the summer especially
10541,This is the dumbest fucking suggestion.
10542,Do you really think a DOG can replace a partner?

10545,"As a healthcare worker, I am confused about why he got a vaccine."
10546,My patients in nursing homes haven’t all been vaccinated yet.
10547,"I love this man, but...why did he get one first?"
10548,If it was for public perception of safety...why didn’t they pick some one who wouldn’t get a vaccine or leads those who wouldn’t get a vaccine (the bot says I can’t put politics here) since those seem to be the population who thinks this vaccine is chipped?
10549,It’s hard the blame the us as a whole when it’s clearly New York and California that dropping the ball.
10550,"Also, most of the coronavirus response has been at the state level"
10551,So... a guy who planned to throw a party for 800 people is now quarantining due to coming in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.
10552,Is that right?
10553,You’re more generous than I am.
10554,I think it’s going to be used for high level people.
10555,They aren’t going to “save” something so valuable and difficult to store.

10578,98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination.
10579,"The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease."
10580,"From a different part:
&gt; The interim analysis showed that a single dose induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated."
10581,"These data are consistent with preclinical studies, published in the scientific journal Nature, which showed that a single dose of the vaccine successfully prevented subsequent infection and provided complete protection in the lungs of nonhuman primates."

10592,"I’ve been in the room with multiple kids who test positive, PLC meetings with coworkers that test positive, and I’m not considered a contact by hr because I was six feet away."
10593,I have autoimmune conditions and have no faith that I would be a “mild” case.
10594,Many of my coworkers are in their 50s and 60s.
10595,"If they’re going to force me into these conditions, they least they can do is vaccinate me."
10596,It’ll be hard to educate the kids when teachers start dying.
10597,Which means we are not returning to normal..

10912,"From what we know currently, the vaccine only prevents disease/symptoms, not infection."
10913,"You can be vaccinated, but still carry and spread the virus!"
10914,"A source:  
[https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-11-24/do-coronavirus-vaccines-prevent-infection-or-disease/12905654](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-11-24/do-coronavirus-vaccines-prevent-infection-or-disease/12905654)

&gt;Assessing whether a vaccine prevents infection (rather  than the development of disease) is particularly challenging to study  in humans, partly for ethical reasons."
10915,"&gt;  
&gt;In these trials, the drug companies waited for people to get sick to determine whether the vaccine offered any protection."
10916,"&gt;  
&gt;But  to work out if the vaccine prevents infection, Dr Labzin said  researchers would ideally vaccinate people and then deliberately expose  them to the virus — to see if they get infected, even if they don't  develop symptoms."
10917,"&gt;  
&gt;These trials, known as human  challenge trials, are usually only performed when a specific treatment  (for whatever disease you're trying to prevent) is available, which we  don't yet have for COVID-19, Dr Quinn said."
10918,"&gt;

10931,"If you have a phone, you're already chipped."
10932,"And if you notice, Norway and Finland have high density areas around their capitals and Denmark is a lot denser."
10933,"And the overall density still matters because many people that have been able to work from home, have a holiday home at the less dense areas where they spend much of the time."
10934,Nice.
10935,This spring it was just the larger regions that were hard hit.
10936,The spread was very uneven; some regions were almost infection free.
10937,But now it’s much more uniform.
10938,All regions are now hard hit.
10939,That is the surprise.
10940,If he was like Trump he'd say something like Brie Cheese cures Covid
10941,Same here!
10942,My manager came around yesterday asking who would take the vaccine and it was an enthusiastic yes from me!
10943,!
10944,This is exactly what some idiot posted about the woman who received the very first Oxford vaccine in their initial trial with her and also a male volunteer.
10945,"They claimed that she died a day or so after getting the shot, only they didn't know that BBC news was following her and the man for a story they were filming for their show ""Panorama"" that just aired, so, that was quashed pretty quickly and the woman was laughing at the tale of her demise."
10946,It was a really good show that chronicled the development of the Oxford vaccine and how it was started in January and how Astra Zenica would produce it along with their full trials and efficacy findings.
10947,Just two ~~weeks~~ years

10957,"Think you need to go take a breather, man."
10958,"Saying ""I think *we* have failed"" could be taken to mean the government rather than society."
10959,Heads of constitutional monarchies rule at their government's pleasure and directly speaking out against the elected parliament is not permitted.
10960,Those that oppose the monarchy (and I don't know any Swedes that do) will take a dim view of his statement while everyone else will also take it as a failure of society ... which is likely what he meant anyway.

10988,Just curious as to how you expect the strain on hospitals to reduce without the immunity.
10989,Spreading the myth that they didnt do anything is really dangerous.
10990,"It convinces people in worse hit countries that you can do nothing, avoiding negative concequences of lockdowns, and you will be better of."
10991,At this time its the same as spreading antivacine myths.
10992,Really dangerous.
10993,That being said they did far to little and especially to late.

11090,Read Linsey Marr's Twitter feed.

11099,And that person will get stares and be refused service or entry at most places.
11100,The only explanation for why the most densely populated state seems to keep it's numbers under control with malls and other places open during winter while other states with warmer areas can't seem to do it is that the people there aren't wearing masks or taking enough precautions about who they invite into their home without a mask.
11101,"Yup, target the athletes and support personnel."

11171,Also some other interesting facts in that article that you should read about past pandemics and who got the supply first.
11172,What about population density as a factor in spread?

11183,Moderna is delivering 100-125 million doses to the US and 25-50 to the rest of the world so basically almost everything will go to the US from them at first
11184,"Interesting tidbit, the current line of swedish monarchs are descended from one of Napoleon's Marshalls, [Bernadotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bernadotte)."

11186,ironic that this is the kind of “mask” they’re interested in ..
11187,N95 masks work for prevention - they stop the smallest droplets that transmit both coronaviruses.
11188,Those were certainly not available and cheap; they were in short supply and really should have been reserved for medical staff and first responders.
11189,Surgical masks are not as good for protecting yourself.
11190,"The droplets can go around the edges of the mask, plus the pore size is meant to stop bacteria (\~1 micron) but not droplets smaller than those."
11191,Surgical masks were also in short supply outside of China and a few Asian countries that had large factories making them.
11192,Cloth masks weren't really on anyone's radar as the pore size could be 100 microns and much larger than many respiratory droplets.
11193,"However, they do work pretty well to contain or reduce the distance travelled by the droplets emitted by the person wearing the mask."
11194,It's like that disgusting but easy to understand pants and pee analogy.
11195,"If someone else is wearing pants and pees, his pants do a good job of keeping you dry even if you're naked."
11196,"If he's naked and he pees on you, you wearing pants helps slightly, but the pee will soak through your pants."
11197,So only when the mask paradigm switched from protecting the wearer to protecting others did it make sense to use home-made face coverings.
11198,They all have separate contracts that can specify who gets it when.
11199,Order date likely plays a role as well it is possible some countries were willing to wait a little longer for a cheaper product.
11200,"That said, the particulars of their negotiating strategy is not public information."
11201,I've been hearing RUMORS that astrazeneca's vaccine Apparently had minimal impact on infection rate.
11202,"Instead, prevented severe cases."
11203,Can anyone confirm this Based on results published?
11204,"also, what is the point of this vaccine if true?"
11205,Disclaimer: I am a healthcare worker and have my first dose of Pfizers vaccine scheduled for Friday.
11206,This is by choice and being performed by the company who ran my phase 3 trial.I’m not against vaccines at all I just am curious about this particular one compared to Moderna and Pfizers

11231,Having the Federal government micromanage which individuals across the country get the vaccine as new batches come in every day would be a nightmare.
11232,"Californian here, I also feel the same about Europe."
11233,No desire to visit.
11234,I assume first world countries will eventually release the slightly less effective (60-85%) vaccines for poorer nations as they'll prefer the higher efficacy versions to get best coverage from the percentage of their population willing to vaccinate.

11266,"But   to work out if the vaccine prevents infection, Dr Labzin said   researchers would ideally vaccinate people and then deliberately expose   them to the virus — to see if they get infected, even if they don't   develop symptoms."

11433,"&gt; Also, why are you calling him a nazi?"
11434,He's a troll.
11435,Makes me wonder about the quality control during the manufacturing phase.
11436,In Adelaide pretty the same.
11437,Masks are mandatory in  health care settings (I think) and reccomended every where social distancing is not possible.
11438,The only reason it can be so relaxed though is because we locked down hard.
11439,Melbourne had crazy restrictions that lasted ages.
11440,We had a recent scare and hard lock down but only a short run.
11441,Main prevention measure really was the 2 week quarantine for travel.
11442,"Originally after international travel, then interstate when it was flared up."
11443,Now its back to just international unless you are in a risk category (contact of a case or been to a location that a case had been to).
11444,Remember Microsoft “Bob”?
11445,Mid FALL?!
11446,"Damn, I thought we'd be normal by summer!"
11447,"EDIT: or before summer was over... you know, like June 30th."
11448,Your comment is extremely offensive.
11449,"Every human being has an equal right to life, regardless of social status or disability status."
11450,"If a group of people is ten times more likely to die than the general population, then they get the vaccine before the general population does."
11451,"The chances of an American being able to ""cut the line"" on an unethical basis, at this point of time, is low."
11452,"But, it is bound to happen at some point, and it's unlikely to be the disabled who do this."
11453,"People like you lack moral character: when you blame the disabled or people with severe health conditions for ""trying to get to the front of the line"", you are implying that they are trying to  ""cut the line"", when the fact is that vaccine allocation is adjudicated by multidisciplinary teams of experts."
11454,"Not only that, they are dying at much higher rates than the general population."
11455,Two thirds of US deaths are from nursing homes.
11456,he is such a C&amp;\*T.
11457,Only EpiPen carriers.
11458,since when do people use the chemical symbol for gold for that?
11459,is this some weird alchemy joke?
11460,Preparing for something and believing it will actually happen are two different things.
11461,You keep saying these people are preparing.
11462,To others it sounds like they truly believe it.
11463,She is.
11464,Hopefully she can be vaccinated soon though.
11465,Try and get her to hold out a little longer
11466,The KN masks always end up getting dented so it's not really fitted.
11467,It doesn't have the rib edge so you can't do it too at the edge and it felt like it just bends the mask.
11468,I haven't given it too much thought lately though so I will try tomorrow to see if there are better ways to tie it.
11469,"At best we are probably looking at spring, but even then projections still seem to be about 400 dead per day"
11470,Wait.
11471,You mean a chiropractor and a veterinarian are not the best to speak at a school board meeting about opening schools safely?
11472,That woman is awful and I was disappointed I could not vote against her.
11473,The board has been so shady about the numbers here and only offered condolences on the latest teacher fatality after outcry from the public.
11474,They said zero about the first teacher and bus driver.
11475,The blood of the dead is on on their hands.

11491,"They shouldn't cancel it, they need to push it back and all other hosts."
11492,It's incredibly unfair to have Japan dump all that money into it and then cancel it and be out all that money.
11493,it needs to be postponed.
11494,Your tone is very aggressive.
11495,I'll overlook that and address your point: Yes the parents should have been fully educated and made aware of the challenges and risks and been given a choice including abortion as an option if they wish.
11496,And yes in some countries abortion was often chosen leading to an essential disappearance of the syndrome.
11497,But something like this can only be done through education and providing choices.
11498,"That's not how you approach recycling or eating less meat, but it is absolutely how we should approach public health issues."

11521,Both of you are spouting a fountain of horseshit.
11522,Life doesn't follow any pattern imposed from outside.
11523,Many people work hard for years to make a good life and nothing ever gets better.
11524,Some people have as much fun as they can when they're young and then it turns out that was all they were ever gonna get.

11532,I still am genuinely wondering what timeframe you wanted him to give.
11533,Did you want him to say something like “this will all be over in May” and then... it becomes May and... like what is the plan?
11534,"Well, antivaxers should never be talked about nicely, including wives."

11682,"We don't know many things in biology with absolute certainly but enough people have been vaccinated over the past 6 months that we reasonably confident based upon what we've seen in the past with other vaccines, it would be extremely unusual to find something long term and particularly common at this point."
11683,I think we can be pretty certain that any long term effects we are likely to see are likely to be much better than getting the virus.
11684,Fetal cells are sacred....until they grow to become alter boys
11685,"From the article:

Vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna, the first two vaccines coming on the market for the public, are “morally acceptable” because neither company used “fetal cell lines from an aborted baby” during production, the letter states."
11686,"But the companies both relied on those cells during lab tests, the bishops said."
11687,"“In our current circumstances, when better options are not available, the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines remains a morally valid option,” the bishops wrote."
11688,"“On the other hand, vaccines such as AstraZeneca-Oxford use aborted fetal lines in design, development, production and testing, and therefore are not a morally valid option because better options are available.”

The point of the letter was to “affirm that the use of some COVID-19 vaccines is morally acceptable under certain circumstances,” it says."
11689,"Fauci isn’t wrong or right, it’s just up in the air."
11690,"If none of other vaccines are approved, we wouldn’t have enough dose for everyone to go back to normal anytime this year, with only 100-150M people immunized."
11691,A common practice when different vaccines/medicines are approved for a certain disease is testing one vaccine vs. the other.
11692,So you can get a group that gets the pfizer vaccine and a group that gets the moderna vaccine and then collect data on that over the next years.
11693,"Well, i have both kn95 and surgical."
11694,"all i can say is I use both and they seem to be working, but again, i think we need a study done and a final consensus made...."

11710,"Ofc, you help me by letting me help you"
11711,My definition of normal is when all restrictions to mitigate covid are lifted nationwide.
11712,"There are no physical distancing expectations in restaurants, movie theaters, grocery store lines, etc."
11713,No mask requirements in public.
11714,"Basically, precautions are no different than what we would take during cold/flu season."
11715,"That is when I would say we are ""back to normal""

Obviously, some people are going to continue wearing masks/distancing after we are no longer officially required to."
11716,And the economic impacts of all of this will be long-lasting.

11745,"testing doesn't matter when you're able to spread the disease while still testing negative

my friend in the film industry just tested positive... he's been showing up every day until he finally got a positive result... who knows how many people he spread it to already?"
11746,"Wow, I'm surprised Florida walmarts weren't participating."
11747,"I figured little states like VT or NH would be the ones to not participate, due to the ruralness."
11748,Have you eventually been able to get tested?
11749,"So far, I've been tested 2 times for active infection and 2 times for antibodies."
11750,"Tested negative on all but 1, which was one of the antibody tests."
11751,"I tested positive for IgM, which all I know is that it means I had been recently exposed within 7 days of that blood test."
11752,That was back on August 24th.
11753,please please please let this be a thing.
11754,I miss going to the movies and the gym.
11755,Sorry but I'm not doing that right now under current circumstances.
11756,*If*.
11757,We could’ve been back to normal by mid fall 2020..
11758,IF we had just gotten people to wear masks
11759,Peanut butter is far more dangerous.
11760,Yes.
11761,Lots of people (either multi generation or lots of roommates) live in houses designed for single families because of a lack of high density housing driving up the price of single family houses and apartments.
11762,Guys it's a fuckin tsunami right now.
11763,Can it really surge after that?
11764,How does this man still have a job.
11765,He’s been wrong more than my local meteorologist
11766,"Literally not affiliated with either party,  but Daddy Trump said he was a dem so all the good little boys and girls believe and repeat!"
11767,And then you have to convince the antivax crowd to stop polluting the conversation with nonsense and conspiracy theories
11768,why?
11769,I live in Alabama and these idiots think its gonna make us passive.
11770,I am probably the only one that will get it in Alabama.
11771,People are idiots
11772,"Yep, we have established science with mRNA"
11773,"Realistically just those at risk, like the 50+ range need it."
11774,You sir are an idiot.
11775,You are likely alive today because your parents were vaccinated.
11776,What the fuck kind of logic is that?
11777,"""Democrats said to listen so someone so that person must be a democrat""."
11778,"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-claims-dr-fauci-is-a-democrat-no-evidence-2020-10

Oh wait,  you're just parroting Daddy's lies."
11779,"Yeah USA did ultra shit job, europe depending on the country and circumstances ranged from shit to decent."
11780,"Im just saying that NZ had a much easier job that germany, which is the heart of europe and shittons of transit."
11781,Problem is that if we want to return to normal we need 78% of people to get the vaccine at least to achieve herd immunity.
11782,"For one, it’s entirely possible you can spread COVID even if you have the vaccine and for another not everyone can get vaccines due to immune deficiencies or potential allergies."
11783,This group of people is extremely at risk if we neglect to collectively take vaccines that are proven to be safe.
11784,How in the good god can you say that when the damn vaccine just came out
11785,"As a public health official, motivations are critical."
11786,"He's not a researcher, his literal job is public messaging - so incentives are important."
11787,"He doesn't 'just give the best advice' anyways, otherwise he would've advocated masks back in January or February or at least March."
11788,Now he says he was trying to preserve PPE which is why he lied and said don't wear masks because it could actually raise your risk of infection (they said you would touch your face more).
11789,But why try to 'preserve' PPE when in April they told people to just use homemade masks anyways.
11790,He could've done that months earlier.
11791,I also wish he'd wear a fucking mask when he's on TV.
11792,That's parenting 101.
11793,"Want your children to eat brussel sprouts, maybe don't refuse to eat them yourself."
11794,A surgical mask doesn't block your voice - his continued insistence on not wearing a mask during interviews sends people the wrong message.
11795,I've noticed Bernie Sanders has started giving more and more interviews wearing a mask.
11796,"(And no - they don't 'need' to wear one if they're distanced, but the point is to set an example and send a message."
11797,But none of these people seem to do it.)
11798,Thank you so much for your bravery and sacrifice.
11799,I hope everything finds you well after this pandemic

11801,39 million vs 37.
11802,Hardly a huge difference.
11803,I'm in NY and I'm not an expert at California but to me it seemed that their numbers didnt startle them.
11804,"They have a huge population, many populated areas have mild weather, and the population is spread out in many areas."
11805,They could absorb so much.
11806,"Besides,  who has been having a tough time until now?"
11807,LA?
11808,Wouldn't they just take the poor folks out of the hospital and drop them off in the street?
11809,I've never been asked to stick around after a flu vaccine.
11810,Sounds like we may want to require it for this vaccine though.
11811,Ahhh Fauci the great economist.
11812,🤦‍♂️
11813,[removed]
11814,You're doing the deplorables thing.
11815,You are not a good person.
11816,Can you point to any vaccines in the past 50 years that have had   long term ill effects?
11817,mRNA breaks down quickly in the body.
11818,"We understand how it works, and have almost a year's worth of data on."
11819,"&gt; He’s given so many different answers as to when things could “go back to normal” in the last 2-3 weeks, apparently today saying it could be next fall, after having said mid spring a week or so ago."
11820,"The problem is, what he's saying is right, but it comes with conditions that continually aren't being met."
11821,"An example is,

""We can be back to normal soon *if* everyone wears a mask""."
11822,And then people don't wear masks.
11823,Or his new prediction saying we can be back to normal by fall 2021 *if* most people get vaccinated.
11824,His statements can be true if people could drag themselves to do the basic necessities.
11825,&gt;I don't see large event cancellation and mask wearing being tolerated much longer past the May-June time frame.
11826,It’s easy for people to not wear masks or to go see friends in a bigger group than their supposed to.
11827,But if things like concerts and in-person school are still banned in your municipality there’s fuck all that you can do about that no matter how little you want to tolerate it.
11828,This is insane; my understanding is that San Bernadino is one of the harder hit places in California and the hospitals are at capacity.
11829,Why would you sue to stop the lockdown unless you wanna destroy the local economy completely?
11830,"Fuck Amazon, but the guys taking red eye flights to fix the internet aren’t the same as programmers sitting at home with coffee mugs of bourbon in their pajamas."
11831,The number of people who assume I can just work from home because my title has engineer in it is fucking mind boggling

11850,This article is published everyday nobody cares it is terrible
11851,Rich countries should be fine by summer.
11852,At least 50% of people should be vaccinated in most if not all developed countries by then.
11853,Poorer countries through will lag behind though.
11854,So in other words it won't be over
11855,Thank you.
11856,It sucks to be in this situation.
11857,Gotcha.
11858,I’m in the detroit area.
11859,We only seem short here because that’s the shitty matrix hospitals have chosen for us lol.
11860,Do you have CNA:patient standardized ratios like nurses:patient there?
11861,Ratio laws here are something that we have been trying to get passed for years.
11862,At one point the bill was sitting on the desk of some chick who was the head of some health care committee.
11863,Her husband was upper management of a hospital.
11864,Of course that never went anywhere.
11865,People should be in prison for the shit they’ve pulled here.
11866,I accidentally got my passport wet when a water bottle spilled in my purse.

11870,Fake.
11871,Nobody wants this franken-vaccine

11873,"Delivering food, medicine, and essential supplies to socially distancing people is now no longer beneficial to society as a whole?"
11874,Wondering the same.
11875,I'm 36 and healthy.
11876,I had a mild case of it back in July.
11877,The disease poses little concern to me at this point.
11878,"My only concern right now is becoming reinfected, not knowing about it and passing it along to an at-risk loved one."
11879,"Once those at-risk loved ones are vaccinated, my concern will evaporate."
11880,Anyone else think this is just evolution at this point?....

11893,"It's pretty much the same routine either way, and there is no pretense of trying to look professional, either way."
11894,Groundhog Day 2020!
11895,Last spring it was more than 50% of COVID ICU patients dying from COVID.
11896,The past few months it's been as good as only 30% dying.
11897,"With such a crunch in capacity, the statistics will get worst again--both because of worse care from over-stressed staff and only the sickest patients getting an ICU bed."
11898,And people were saying he should be man of the year.

11909,Oh hell no.
11910,As someone who has been suffering from depression and anxiety from before Covid... well holy fuck has this been a rough year.
11911,I can only imagine how bad it has been for the undiagnosed.
11912,I went several years before I realized my psychological problem.
11913,If Covid had hit during my denial stage?
11914,Oh man.
11915,Not good.
11916,Not that it's been good for me but at least I know what to look out for.
11917,"Could, but won’t, because once again, the idiots are going to hold us all back"

11921,I am late but I don’t think you’re an asshole for not thinking they should be included in the first group of people being vaccinated.
11922,"Health care workers, the elderly, and essential workers should receive priority."
11923,"Question here: people keep bringing up herd immunity, but the vaccine isn't proven yet to prevent contagion."
11924,"As far as we know so far regarding the Pfizer one, it'll keep you from getting sick, but not from infecting others."
11925,"In that case herd immunity isn't something that'd apply, or am I missing something?"
11926,You seem super angry dude but anyone with a decent education could understand the concept of a false statistic.
11927,The issue is with the “average day during the Normandy campaign” number.
11928,How was the number 68 calculated?
11929,There’s no source.
11930,On the first week of Normandy invasion it was wayyyyyyy higher than 68 per hour then at some point it probably leveled off back to near zero.
11931,What was their cutoff day for the end of the invasion.
11932,There’s no source and that’s not common info the value of 68 is completely meaningless and arbitrary so the statistic of 125&gt;68 is a fear mongering way to say how bad the virus is right now
11933,Nice.
11934,"What would happen is someone takes the vaccine now, and then they change it, or make it better in the next few months?"
11935,Will that person have to take it again?
11936,There is going to be intense pressure to lift social distancing measure and travel restrictions next spring.
11937,With this latest round of cases and the vaccine starting to enter the population I think we're going to see the virus peter out in March and people will demand a return to normal regardless of where we are in terms of vaccinations.
11938,Probably only the second time on Reddit I laughed so hard I have tears rolling.
11939,And probably the first time I’ve laughed in over a month.
11940,Thank you.
11941,"I don’t know why in the hell I thought that treating ninjas vs minks was so funny, but shit."

11944,I officially losing it... but I don’t care!
11945,Hahahahahaha!
11946,"You realize that won't happen though, right?"
11947,It will be virtually impossible to get *everyone* to take it.
11948,"The best we're going to get is once it's as available as the flu vaccine, everyone is going to go back to normal."
11949,I'm personally going back to normal after the allotted time it takes for the vaccine to take effect.
11950,Can't keep putting my life on hold for people who don't want to take it.
11951,Fun fact: -69℃ is -92.2℉.
11952,Stuff was supposed to be at about -70℃ but ended up at -92℃.
11953,They're not letting it go to waste.
11954,My friend is in healthcare and she was able to get the shot because of the extra dosage that was leftover.
11955,"She was originally scheduled for tomorrow but since they didn't want it to go to waste, she was able to get it today."
11956,Exactly this.
11957,Cases have grown at a much higher rate since the lockdowns were implemented.
11958,They are having the reverse effect of what is intended.
11959,"Starting tomorrow night, the remaining counties in the Bay Area region that held out of the self imposed Bay Area lockdown Solano, Sonoma, and Napa have to shut down."
11960,It’s comical to think these lockdowns work.
11961,I heard you can install linux on these chips.
11962,We did flatten the curve.
11963,That's why we opened back up again.
11964,Then people stopped taking covid seriously and did not wear masks.
11965,So here we are.
11966,He shouldn't even be giving a timeline.
11967,"We have no clue how long the vaccine lasts, no clue if this will become a yearly issue like the flu, what is the death rate of people who get infected who were vaccinated."
11968,There are a ton of unknowns still.
11969,Dude that's such an absurd and obnoxious stereotype.
11970,I've been locked in my **mom's basement**.
11971,Big difference.
11972,"You say that buy hi from South county in Orange County, California So many restaurants are fighting that order and just ignoring the mask requirement."
11973,So do most people.
11974,That's the damnedest part.
11975,Sniffles or multiple-organ inflammation?
11976,Catch the virus and find out!
11977,Its not a conspiracy theory.
11978,Im not a covid denier.
11979,What i am is in between.
11980,I think this is blown out if proportion.
11981,Funny how reddit downvotes you.
11982,The vaccine was released.
11983,Case and point.
11984,"I'm by no means an antivaxer, but I will remain to quarantine and wear my mask until it's over."
11985,I doubt many states will lift restrictions that soon unless the ICU situation improves.
11986,Hmmm too early to say that.
11987,Deaths will follow the recent spike.
11988,Orange County was at about 2% death rate before the recent explosion of cases
11989,Says person with less (no?)
11990,education and no influence on the national discourse.
11991,"But hey, you're on the internet!"

there's a medical revolution about to happen.. in like.. 5-10 years.. and it will be ***because*** of the pandemic"
11997,I took your implication in the original comment to mean that the shutdown is bad &amp; should be lifted _because_ of the mental health issues it is purported to 'cause'.
11998,That's a common argument in rightwing political spheres -- that the shutdown needs to end because 'it's killing more people than the pandemic' via mental health.
11999,"(of course, this is an entirely unsubstantiated claim)"
12000,"from an epidemiological standpoint, it makes perfect sense for a single dense metro to burn hotter and faster than a big, relatively low population density country as a whole."

12002,My first reaction to this article: what a shit show.
12003,Can't think of anywhere else in the world where it could get so complicated.
12004,Yup.
12005,Get ready for the state wide lockdown.
12006,"Thanks a lot, selfish assholes."
12007,It could have been a lot sooner if people weren't being idiots about taking even the slightest precautions
12008,I would hope for more openness from my favorite restaurants.
12009,"If my favorite said, ""Things are not looking good for us right now"", I would probably buy a 100 dollar gift card or something the next time I got food there."
12010,I'd prefer that and maybe lose the value of the GC than them just announce they're closing one day.

12031,"&gt;By early to mid spring most elderly and frontline workers will be vaccinated, sorry I forgot to specify that before."
12032,That is less than 2 months from now.
12033,That’s the time I will assume my own personal risk and start living life again.
12034,"Feels a bit different than when you said that 'Once I get the vaccine and my family gets the vaccine I’m done with this “social distancing”,' considering I don't see in what world your family and you will have actually gotten vaccinated in the next month, and once again, it takes a month for the vaccine from first dose to become effective."
12035,"&gt;(the groups only post content which supports their views and form a kind of bubble)

This is true for the majority of facebook groups."
12036,I assume the mid-fall estimate is due to the sheer number of individuals involved and the logistics needed to get the vaccine to them.
12037,Get a job like the rest of us
12038,Yes.
12039,I've given thousands of flu vaccinations and there is always extra in the multi-dose vials.
12040,Better to have a little more than to not have enough for that last dose.
12041,"Meanwhile, out in the real world, it's too late to spend truckloads of money on vaccine manufacturing facilities."
12042,$200 a dose can't magically make it possible to produce a safe and effective vaccine in a repurposed office building or school.
12043,You need tooling and training and facilities and those things don't magically pop into existence just because there's money to motivate extraordinary measures.
12044,They do take time to make.
12045,And the reason why we're not better prepared is because two to ten years ago - when we had the time - pandemic preparation wasn't profitable.
12046,"&gt;You retarded if you think that.. remember when Trump put travel restrictions against China but then he was called racist, that could've helped too.. every country in the world failed but that's on the count of China covering up shit for a while..

12053,"Hospitalizations are expensive, insurance companies would rather pay for the drugs than pay for multiple days in the hospital"
12054,"The vaccine won't be a silver bullet, even if we vaccinate enough people to get herd immunity."
12055,Some people might still get sick and die.
12056,I value the community enough to want us to do everything we can to eradicate the virus.
12057,"If we did what Australia and New Zealand have done, we'd have their results."

12070,"Once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, death rates will plummet."
12071,That won't take long at all.
12072,"Most people not involved in health care will go back to normal after that, especially if they get vaccinated too."
12073,"I'm not sure why he's saying mid-fall exactly, but maybe he's thinking of the people who are vulnerable and *can't* get vaccinated, and thus rely on the herd immunity that a vaccine taken by 80% of the population will provide."
12074,"Or he's thinking of a true 100% return to full normal, where even hospitals are operating identically to how they were before the pandemic."
12075,"Ha-ha, I will win the contest of internet dick size!"
12076,Late 20s.
12077,Lost my job twice this year due to shutdowns.
12078,Serious relationship ended due to the other cheating.
12079,Had to move out of my place and into my parents.
12080,Might lose my car.
12081,"If either of my parents get this, they die to prior poor health."
12082,I’ve lost one close friend and countless people that I’ve met this year.
12083,Do I win?
12084,Is my situation worse?
12085,"Oh wait, it’s almost like this sucks ass for everyone involved."
12086,Don’t try and equate your issues to someone else.
12087,It’s unfair to them and to you.
12088,Deaths are increasing.
12089,You can't even get 75% of Americans to vote.
12090,The only way that'll happen is if they force them to take it.
12091,Perhaps you mixed this up with another thread?
12092,Because at no point do I think this line of conversation suggested that.
12093,Or Maybe I misunderstood something?
12094,I was not arguing against a shutdown.
12095,[removed]
12096,It’s just a needlessly inflammatory—and wrong—comment.
12097,"The US will get the vaccine distributed—in the end, the issue won’t be distribution but fear and denial—in a reasonably prompt manner."
12098,"However, due to human rights, the US cannot force people to take it."
12099,well said
12100,Roller skating with my tits out again.
12101,"https://www.biospace.com/article/fauci-predicts-coronavirus-vaccine-by-december/

Oceania was at war with Eastasia."
12102,Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia...
12103,"In all fairness, he is a cancer in Australia."
12104,"Though I think the only good thing about Scotty from Marketing being in power at the moment was that the media largely went with lockdowns and federal stimulus measures, while this would have GFC debt and defecit all over again if Bill Shorten was PM"
12105,Good.
12106,Hope all of CA sues Newsom and he is recalled after.
12107,I’ve only left my house for groceries since March.
12108,Once I get the vaccine (and I’m one of the people pretty much last in line) best of luck.
12109,I did my part.
12110,I’m not staying inside for another six months for a virus I got a vaccine for.
12111,Can you clarify a bit?
12112,What do you mean by good at  making you asymptomatic?
12113,Isn’t a vaccine supposed to prevent contracting the virus in the first place?
12114,Don’t assume what I said if I don’t say it.
12115,Good for you that you are playing gigs.
12116,That’s great.
12117,"By early to mid spring most elderly and frontline workers will be vaccinated, sorry I forgot to specify that before."
12118,That is less than 2 months from now.
12119,That’s the time I will assume my own personal risk and start living life again.
12120,Some people won’t feel safe going outside until late fall/winter and that’s okay.
12121,They can do what they want but for *most* people that transition will begin in spring/early summer.
12122,Even on this thread half of the people here are already sick and tired.
12123,"People are struggling, small businesses are struggling, and the current administration is too incompetent to help them."
12124,"If I was living in a multigenerational household in a 70's era socal apartment, and had the ability to work from home, I'd do everything in my power to go to work."
12125,Simple fix in the US...
12126,Stimulus checks for confirmed vaccined citizens.
12127,You are right.
12128,It’s absurd to have voted no here.
12129,This woman wants perfection in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
12130,Ridiculous.
12131,So no hope then?

12133,Whatever works!

12136,"those poor guys got the Senate bailing them out for their money, now they want a bail out on health."
12137,"&gt; Two thirds of US deaths are from nursing homes

I don’t have to fact check this to know that it’s not true."
12138,Where did you get that number?
12139,About 1 month ago I flew from Perth to Brisbane.
12140,I was 1 of 2 people wearing a mask on a flight of 100+ passengers.
12141,And Qantas staff was offering everyone free masks and wearing them themselves.
12142,Australia did well only because of quarantine and isolation protocols in addition to  stopping the majority of international travel (and even local travel in some states).
12143,"I think if we had to rely on the general public, the outcome would still be better than the US but far worse than what it has been so far."
12144,This is a nice way of saying it’s absolutely obscene to have voted no here.
12145,The risk/return meant yes was only reasonable vote.
12146,We have no clue if he'll be that way once it's January.
12147,"How many people, including the elderly, vulnerable, essential workers, paramedics, and stubborn deniers, have needlessly died?"
12148,How many people will never see the day when we're free from this pandemic come?
12149,It doesn't matter much to me that normality will certainly return.
12150,"The damage has been done, lives have been lost because not enough people cared."
12151,itshappening.gif
12152,And place the jar next to their husbands eggs?
12153,To extort the populace.
12154,That’s always been the point
12155,Bedpan emptier &gt; shitposter extraordinaire
12156,A lot of testing and having about 39 million people has lead to that statement.
12157,Yea but this still means there are side effects and we should know them just for the sake of knowing them and what to expect and what not to expect.
12158,Also what about allergic reactions?
12159,I believe people need to know about that if any is discovered too.
12160,"Also don’t get me wrong, I am NOT anti-vaccination, I just want to know all the effects of it before I get it into my body."
12161,No thanks.
12162,Well that’s a hateful and uninformed opinion.
12163,Sure you’re not a Trumpie?
12164,My regional grocery store chain gives you a $10 gift card as incentive to get a free flu shot from their pharmacy.
12165,¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
12166,&gt; Dude statistically you'll be just fine.
12167,I’m not taking about covid.
12168,I only have to be weak for one day out of 365.
12169,And you can drop the “this is easy” bullshit.
12170,"My partner is taking food through the guest bedroom quarantine door, I haven’t seen any of my friends in 11 months."
12171,My family will barely recognize me.
12172,"I can’t think or concentrate through the panic,‘I just stare at my
Computer for 8 hours a day, and I’ll eventually be fired for gross incompetence."
12173,"I can barely even read most days, and I sure as shit can’t do math anymore."
12174,And I’m a fucking engineer.
12175,If this isnt a big deal then I should make **damn well sure** I don’t come out the other side because I simply shouldn’t fucking exist.
12176,[deleted]
12177,Hey!
12178,You!
12179,In the frock.
12180,Why don't you shut the fuck up and let science save your worthless ass.
12181,I understood none of this.
12182,-A concerned US citizen
12183,So basically a whole nother year... fuck me.
12184,"You're right, my bad."
12185,Thought I was in the 54K thread and the backlog there was similar to the number he cited.
12186,Then you have to convince that half again to take vaccines and the schedule.
12187,"Masks are comfy and cute, sorry you can't pull one off brah."
12188,Maybe try some colors?
12189,Your wife’s friend is a dumb piece of shit.
12190,Lol
12191,"As I understand it the only cases of re-infection with the same strain were people with compromised immune systems who may have never actually gotten over it, or their systems did not ‘store’ the solution."
12192,"Otherwise, there is a very minuscule chance of being infected with a variant strain, but the very minimal documented instances of that saw only mild symptoms from the second infection."
12193,"Regardless, if you’ve had the actual virus, I truly don’t understand the benefit of taking the vaccine."
12194,"Also, how does the vaccine protect against multiple strains?"
12195,It is worse.
12196,"I think we can move the crux of the argument all the back to this point: the ""rules"" levied against the US are hilariously inconsistent and meaningless."
12197,6 feet social distancing?
12198,Only 10 people together?
12199,"8 people together are immune from Covid, but 14 are in trouble?"
12200,"The rules are comical, and this is coming from someone who has been quarentining since February."
12201,"The real ""worse look"" is knowing that you'll get top level health care and priority from private doctors, so the worry about hospitals being over capacity doesn't apply to you."
12202,He's a schmuck who is likely not sacrificing anything while we all clamor to help the communal good.
12203,Seems pretty normal to pay for things that cost money and effort to produce
12204,Only a sith deals in absolutes
12205,Cases are dropping in most of the country.
12206,Only rising exponentially in California.
12207,That's completely false.
12208,"According to [the United States Census Bureau, ""the percentage of people with health insurance coverage for all or part of 2019 was 92.0 percent."
12209,"""](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html)"
12210,Talk to your doctor!
12211,Why does it matter if there is a baby bust?
12212,It just means more people from other countries will emigrate to the US in the future.
12213,Is that a bad thing?
12214,"No, unless you like wearing a specific type of hat."
12215,Your fault for not social distancing.
12216,Right but this article is about the US returning to normalcy.
12217,So americans are definitely to blame.
12218,"Because you know, they live in america."
12219,Which is what the whole thread is about.
12220,"It can but at very small rates, not nearly enough to fill up hospitals."
12221,Does this mean we will get more seasons of Survivor New Zealand?
12222,I wonder if this means the kids will have regular school in the fall?
12223,For herd immunity we need at least 75% of the population to be infected or vaccinated.
12224,"24% of the population are children, and none of the currently available vaccines are viable for children."
12225,Getting doses for the 200 million adults in the U.S. will take longer than expected.
12226,A little more than half the adult population is willing to get vaccinated.
12227,"Because of the vaccine announcement people are already letting their guard down, it’s going to get worse before it gets better."
12228,"Getting back to normal by mid-fall is a pipe dream, we probably won’t be getting back to normal until summer of 2022."
12229,[removed]
12230,California is actually doing better than Florida.
12231,"Here's a list of all states ranked by per capita deaths:

[https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html](https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html)

California is at 53.77 deaths per 100k whereas Florida is 91.37."
12232,California ranks 41st for per capita deaths while Florida ranks 21st.
12233,This isn't entirely true.
12234,They actually proved recently that this for the Moderna (and Oxford) vaccine.
12235,They significantly reduce asymptomatic infection.
12236,"Look at section 4, ""Data to Support Efficacy Against Asymptomatic Infection"" in this FDA doc: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144453/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144453/download)."
12237,So if the vaccine stops symptomatic infection and stops asymptomatic infection... you can't catch and pass on coivd
12238,Spoiler alert: they won’t :|
12239,Where did you get 40% from?
12240,"Currently they are talking about ""severe"" like always carrying an epi pen type allergic reactions"
12241,Why would we need to do that?
12242,Stock market is doing great!
12243,"Well, the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting the virus so the virus isn't going to die off due to this vaccine."
12244,"If its going to mutate, its going to mutate regardless."
12245,We will see.
12246,Only time will tell.
12247,It was already normal in a lot of parts of the world before covid.
12248,Watch any Korean films that involve sickness and you’ll see people wearing masks.
12249,I don’t know what makes it so hard for Americans.
12250,Finally
12251,Y'all
12252,Have you never heard that phrase before?
12253,Gonna be interesting when the anti-vaxxers go to war over whether or not COVID will be a required vaccine to go to school.
12254,[removed]
12255,"Yes, I agree and will definitely be changing hand washing hygiene and wearing a mask if I feel sick going forward."
12256,"The thread was informative but when will Pfizer provide details like target fill is 5 ml so we set machines for 5.5 ml to allow for a +/- 10% deviance so some vials will get 5.5 + 10% or 6.0 ml, which is enough an additional dose."
12257,"This is good news but it just seems like if this was not a life saving vaccine, Pfizer could be looking at a recall."
12258,What's literally impossible?
12259,Vaccinating the vulnerable or non vulnerable people ending up on ventilators?
12260,Because if it's the later than I don't want to tell you other than you clearly don't know how the virus works.
12261,"This is a novel disease which humans have no natural immunity to, that is more contagious than influenza."
12262,"Perfectly healthy people can and have been hospitalised by influenza, what's so hard to believe the more deadly and contagious disease doing the same?"
12263,Mid fall 2021 being best case scenario is fucking depressingly frightening
12264,Talk to your doctor.
12265,Nothing that you said is related to the corona virus.
12266,&gt;There was nothing wrong with it.
12267,"Again, labeling 50% of the citizens in a country is ridiculous."
12268,Act your age already.
12269,You're not impressing anyone with this rhetoric.
12270,"In fact, you're just wasting all of our time, including your own."
12271,Talk to your doctor but severe reaction is usually used to refer to people who risk going into anaphylactic shock and struggle to breath on exposure to their allergen.
12272,Both people in england who had allergic reactions had to carry epi pens because of prior anaphylactic reactions
12273,We need to stop farming ALL animals in first world countries.
12274,It’s 100% unethical and unnecessary.
12275,"I think he means true normal, like it's fine to take part in a mosh pit or a kissing contest."
12276,Things will still get steadily better after we get over the winter hump as more people get vaccinated.
12277,Half?
12278,Where did you get that number from?
12279,What do you not understand?
12280,Staff are being crushed and are at their limits.
12281,What do you expect to happen?
12282,They are going to spontaneously combust?
12283,It's the same headline everyday because nothing has changed.
12284,The wolf is still here.
12285,I don't have any allergies luckily.
12286,A coworker isn't getting it because she has serious allergies to nuts and eggs.
12287,"&gt;In hard-hit California, officials activated a mutual aid program for coroners, designed to help local authorities cope with “mass fatality.” Gov."
12288,"Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said at a news conference Tuesday that the state had ordered 5,000 more body bags and 60 refrigerated storage units were on standby."
12289,"&gt;”I don’t want people to scare folks, but this is a deadly disease,” Newsom said."
12290,"“And we need to be mindful of where we are in this current journey together, to the vaccine."
12291,"We are not at the finish line.”

———

This is the first time I’ve heard of a mutual aid program for coroners designed to help with mass fatalities."
12292,What does it take to get through to people?
12293,If they do hold the games are they going to prioritise vaccantions to athletes and attendees.
12294,"Ok thats fine, but when i say land of opportunity and successful, I mean the type of rags to riches shit which was more possible 30 years ago."
12295,The us now is more like the already successful people sucking the poor ones dry.
12296,The barriers to becoming rich from nothing have risen significantly.
12297,"Hell, even working a good paying job doesnt even get you ahead anymore since living costs have outpaced income for the last few decades."
12298,"This is not my opinion, its backed by hard data."
12299,100%.
12300,There was pretty much no testing-- you had to be a basketball player or you had to be already in the hospital with symptoms.
12301,The growth curve/cases pretty much until sometime in may really just reflect testing capacity and not actual cases.
12302,And then at some point testing caught up with the downward trend caused by lockdown.
12303,But New York and New Jersey has higher density of population and they seem to be doing better than California!
12304,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

12309,Wasn't the previous pronouncement mid spring?
12310,"It's not a reasonable thing to expect, but a big reason the first lockdowns were strongly adhered to in urban areas was the understanding it'd be just a few weeks to a month for the spread to be made manageable."
12311,"It's 9 months later, we're in the winter months, there's massive fatigue, and whether it's logical or not pushing a date farther back erode willingness to comply."

12314,"The landlord is running a business, essentially."
12315,Part of running a business is knowing your market and accepting the risk associated with said business.
12316,More like 25% according to the last numbers I saw.
12317,I’m guessing that will drop until it bottoms out around 15.
12318,Unfortunately it only takes a few people without them.
12319,"Your nose and mouth might be covered, but you're eyes may not be."
12320,Covid can likely sit in the air for a bit inside.
12321,"Masks work, fabric ones work less, but regardless everyone has gotta use them"
12322,Except for the unknown long term effects that have been popping up... and the folks who still can’t taste or smell many months later
12323,Australia got most antivaxxers to vaccinate their children by tying the family tax credit to vaccination certificates.
12324,Turns out there is a dollar amount where people will ‘risk’ getting vaccinated.
12325,I’m sure a similar thing could be done for adult vaccinations
12326,It's both.
12327,The pandemic has made me consider how deadly the flu can be to some people and how I should take precautions to avoid catching or spreading it.
12328,"Sure, the vast majority of people would be okay, and I’d never know if I spread it to someone who spread it to someone else (etc.)"
12329,"and someone eventually died, but it’s not that inconvenient to wear a mask if I think I’m sick, use hand sanitizer more often, get a flu shot, and so on."
12330,"*checks calendar*

It’s late fall right now"
12331,They are also suing the state for its choices with respect to mitigation efforts.
12332,People are in danger.
12333,Yeah.
12334,The US Brazil Europe all bad as far as deaths and following safety for sure.
12335,Where’d you find the 71% figure from?
12336,"Yes, because at least in US, it means penury for the elderly who depend on social security."
12337,What exactly are you getting at?
12338,I never said anything about anything being true or not true.
12339,I said if California keeps up 50k cases a day they will blow by Florida.

12346,This articles is confusing.
12347,The lawyer says be highly suspicious.
12348,The doctor says the process is transparent and open.
12349,"That’s fair, but not knowing whether it will be effective seems a far cry from not sure whether it will cause a severe allergic reaction."
12350,"This isn’t them saying “maybe it will work, good luck,” but warning people off for a risk factor it seems."
12351,"Not that I know what I’m talking about, just based on what the other commenters have said."
12352,It is when you've vaccinated everyone 60+.
12353,"Newsome is taking all the blame for strict restrictions but as you said he wasn't even adhering to them, because he is doing what his advisors and scientists are telling him to do, he's not the sole person saying we should lockdown, he doesn't even want it, he is going against his own ideas and listening to the professionals who actually know what's happening and is about to happen"
12354,All landlords are beholden to regulation.
12355,The only ones that get to bend some rules are the super tiny ones (think under 4 units) if the landlord also lives on site.

12371,"So basically, yes, ASSUME it transmits the virus even if you are vaccinated until told otherwise."
12372,&gt; Not really.
12373,It is a very rational market action.
12374,I agree and that’s my entire point.
12375,"We have a real human need with plenty of demand (temporary of course), during a health crisis."
12376,"Our production system, driven by price signals, is unable to meet the need."
12377,"Government intervention is required, which is well understood."
12378,That’s why we have the DPA.
12379,Why half?
12380,If all we do is immunize the 1% of people who are most vulnerable to the disease then this thing is as good a done.
12381,50-60% of people are asymptomatic anyways but are still suffering lung and cardiovascular damage.
12382,"Also, they can still spread it."
12383,Lol facts don’t care about your feelings.
12384,"Hopefully this is a conservative estimate and we can get this done sooner, would be nice to have a normal summer"
12385,It's partly a lack of enforcement.
12386,More importantly is the failure to realize that what might work in the summer will not necessarily work in the winter.
12387,Once I’m vaccinated come spring I’m going back to my normal life.
12388,Fuck this bullshit
12389,I wish they wouldn't make predictions like this as it feeds the idiots if it misses the fall deadline.
12390,"Just do your part for helping the world deal with a new and deadly virus by getting the vaccine, who cares when we beat it."

12402,There hasn’t been sufficient testing and studies (given the time constraints) to see if those who have the vaccine can still carry and spread coronavirus while the vaccine deals with providing your body a defense against the COVID disease.
12403,The molecular mechanism of the vaccine suggests that it is possible the vaccine is in effect treating the disease but not the virus and it’s spread itself.
12404,"Because of this uncertainty, you could have the virus and still spread it."
12405,"Therefore, it’s better to stay cautious and continue with masks and social distancing until we have the means to determine if the vaccinated can still be spreaders."
12406,I agree.
12407,"The great thing about 2021 is that every month will be better than the one that came before it, at least in terms of COVID."
12408,I'll hedge my bets expecting an asteroid will come hurtling towards Earth a few months in.
12409,"My prediction\~

January will be a difficult month, perhaps the apex of the pandemic."
12410,"February will bring more death but not be as bad as January

March will profoundly better than the two months which came before it

April off to the races

If it means anything, I predicted back in the Spring that we'd have a vaccine in the Nov-Jan timeframe."
12411,I have it in writing.
12412,So we won’t be returning to normal by mid fall
12413,Why not?
12414,The choice isn't between a vaccine with potential long-term side effects and life as normal.
12415,"It's between a vaccine with potential long-term side effects and a known deadly, extremely contagious, disease."
12416,The benefits to society clearly outweigh the risk to society.
12417,"Yeah but I think we are all continually surprised by how fucking stupid people are, so they have to adjust continuously."
12418,Isn't the idea of the vaccine so you don't get it and won't be carrying it so therefore not asymptotic.
12419,I know they say it isn't  100% effective so is that the %  of possible asymptotic people we are talking about?
12420,New Zealand actually considered charging before making it free.
12421,It's 2021.
12422,"But mid-fall of 2021, he'll be saying May of 2022."
12423,"ah, yes, how silly of me."
12424,adding two months to Fauci's guess is understandable but adding more than *three* months to a pandemic projected to last *at least two full years* is just highly unreasonable doomerism
12425,"So when my friend gave birth and she was in the hospital, they did some kind of test to see if she had MMR immunity, and they determined that she did not."
12426,"Even though she had gotten the vaccine as a child, and again when she had her first child, but it apparently still didn’t work?"
12427,Is that like what you’re talking about?
12428,Does that even make sense or am I completely misremembering this?
12429,"Can you send source i believe you but that’s fascinating, 9 days is much lower than quarantine advises"
12430,Interesting read.
12431,Thanks for posting.
12432,Thanks.
12433,I miss read it.
12434,In the trials they said it you could still spread it but the science behind it says it should stop spreading it as well.
12435,I want my son and spouse to be able to get the vaccine too but they cannot.
12436,It's depressing because we've been completely isolated since March.
12437,"My son has is doubly bad because even though we carry an EpiPen, he has a heart condition where the EpiPen can kill him."
12438,"It sucks right now, but at least the vaccine is out and we should all be vaccinated within several weeks."
12439,We won't get our second doses for another 3 weeks but even just the first dose is enough to give us a large degree of protection.
12440,"So even though life will suck for us while we are swamped at work, we will at least be safe."
12441,I'm far more worried for the large number of people in the general population who require hospitalization over the next few months only to find out that the hospitals are full.
12442,Thank you for your concern.
12443,"In the US, 2,500 people per day are dying of this disease equating to some 900,000 deaths per year if the rate were to be sustained for an entire year."
12444,"Not to mention, the economic, social and mental health ramifications of the pandemic continue to be devastating as well."
12445,"With all due respect Michigan professor, please shut the fuck up."
12446,Keep us updated if you feel any side effects.
12447,Will the vaccine fix anything ?
12448,Like by feb
12449,"They did give good advice, it just wasn't what you wanted to hear."
12450,"Politicians will tell you what you want to hear, like the virus will be gone by last Easter or we are turning a corner any day now."
12451,Medical professionals will just tell you what they know.
12452,"You just said you're a senior in college, these people have spent twice your entire life span as experts in their science."

12462,There was also pelosi going to her hair salon when hair salons were supposed to be shut down.
12463,Me and my cousin were talking about that the other day.
12464,Neither of us even had a cold once this year.
12465,Pretty remarkable to think about
12466,That sounds like total futuristic science fiction compared to what is going on here in TN.
12467,The rates are bad enough it's inevitable we're all going to get it.
12468,"There's people who are clearly actively infectious, both customers and staff and management in all the stores coughing and not wearing masks."
12469,They get violent and aggressive if you say anything about the masks.
12470,"Even if you say nothing, when they see someone without a mask many of them will follow you around or try to get as close as they can."
12471,"Some will deliberately cough on you then give you a look like ""What are you going to do about it."""
12472,"Nearly all these people are fundamentalist bible believers too who attend church several times a week, when they are not on a meth or opioid binge, or robbing houses."
12473,"Last time I saw my doctor, whom I have seen for decades and formerly considered to be competent, he told me I was a fool for wearing a mask and masks don't work."
12474,Our schools don't shut down no matter how bad the rates get.
12475,"The schools are only shutting down, briefly, when so much of the staff is out sick with covid or hospitalized that they literally can not operate the school."
12476,"Yes, but one country down!"
12477,It’s progress.
12478,"TBH, most of your questions are trivial:

&gt; *    How cold is the room the freezer is in?"
12479,&gt;    What is the thermal loss or gain from the floor in the room the freezer is in?
12480,&gt;    Is it constantly that temperature or does it vary over that given time?
12481,"&gt;     If varies, what are the temperature swings and for how long?"
12482,Why does room matter?
12483,"What matters is a temperature IN the freezer, the freezer should be on thermostat of course

&gt;  For how long?"
12484,Whatever is the expected time from production to vaccination + safety buffer.
12485,A month will be close.
12486,"Trials lasts for almost 10 months, so plenty of time to do the measurement..

&gt;    What is the humidity in the room the freezer is in?"
12487,&gt;   What is the air pressure?
12488,&gt;    Is there ever sunlight shining on the freezer?
12489,I'd expect vials to be fully sealed.
12490,So air pressure/humidity does not matter.
12491,"And of course, no sunlight..."
12492,"I _suspect_ the real problem is measuring degradation of the vaccine, that I simply have no idea about.. Everything else is really a 12th grade science (if that)."
12493,But why wouldn't they be using birth control?
12494,Were they afraid to leave their homes and get a box of condoms or refill their birth control pills?
12495,it's literally advised that you DO NOT take it if you have an epi pen.
12496,"This user is above is spouting bullshit , they would literally tell u to not take it"

12500,What do you mean realistically preventable?
12501,"We successfully beat the virus in the spring, and then gave up and got destroyed in the fall."
12502,That's exactly the opposite of what he's suggesting
12503,It's a shame my Samsung LED can't kill covid.
12504,Dumb technology
12505,I fail at sarcasm detection.
12506,It may come from reading so many news articles.
12507,you can tie knots in the bands to make them as tight as you want
12508,You can have mine.
12509,It hilarious that we are talking about the 1 or two people having allergic reactions (non fatal/non lasting ) to the vaccine as of that's anywhere near as concerning as covid itself...which in the states is killing a 9/11s worth of people a day.
12510,With all of that “suppose” why bother with the species hopping?
12511,Maybe it will just mutate into something worse without the convoluted “nightmare scenario” 🤷‍♂️
12512,Seriously.
12513,Our nation is full of fucking morons
12514,"As I've clearly stated, nothing Fauci has said in any of these articles is contradictory."
12515,WHEN YOU ACTUALLY READ.
12516,Keep looking for anything to whine about though.
12517,"Maybe talk about election fraud or something, and wait for your Kraken."
12518,"Oh snap, and what else have you noticed that has stuck even after you got negative?"
12519,Reality is when spring starts breaking in cold weather areas that will be the end of societal buy in for most restrictions.
12520,"Most people will keep wearing masks inside public spaces, but outdoor activists this summer are going to look very similar to pre pandemic other than large events."
12521,"With a lot of places being extremely restrictive for christmas, they’re spending the last of their societal credit on this holiday."
12522,A full winter of covid restrictions is going to be extremely tough on cold weather areas to keep enforced past spring.
12523,"wait 10,800 is worse than 7,800???"
12524,?
12525,"The authors also speculate:

&gt; From an evolutionarily [sic] perspective, retrointegration of viral RNA by LINE-1 could be an adaptive response by the host to provide sustaining antigen expression possibly enhancing protective immunity."
12526,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.12.422516v1.full.pdf

if it even happens, it might be good."
12527,"Yup, unless something changes in the next month, I'll have to give birth alone."
12528,:( No partners allowed in the hospital at all.
12529,"The hospital wouldn't mind, but it's national policy (they'd risk getting shut down by authorities if they allowed it)."
12530,I think Romania may be the only country left with this stupid ass policy.
12531,Who is in charge of distributing the vaccine locally?
12532,Like the entire state doesn’t have to continue their phase of distribution together right?
12533,I’m in a small town and teaching in person so I’m very anxious to get it.
12534,"if you have allergies to food you are advised not to take it , too, you know right?"
12535,I’m so fucking tired.
12536,So tired.
12537,"Man, I sure wish I could take some time away from Covid!"
12538,Too bad it’s destroyed nearly every facet of my life!
12539,The only way for an American to “take time away from COVID” would be to 1. sneak into Australia or 2. die.
12540,What are you getting your PhD in?
12541,He honestly should stop making these predictions.
12542,No one possibly knows the exact date and it'll be a gradual progression towards normality.
12543,His timeline for the vaccine was wrong and he was wrong about masks.
12544,There’s like 800 people.
12545,😜
12546,Didn’t think so
12547,"Sure, but it can’t be made mandatory because it isn’t approved safe for use."
12548,I think that might be the biggest IF I have ever heard of
12549,Or perhaps you should some listening to sound bites and take information from more than one source.
12550,Fauci is a living legend and his opinion is greatly respected.
12551,"However, he is one man."
12552,Don’t hang on his every word.
12553,[removed]
12554,"&gt; the new strain may not be stopped by vaccines

It might turn us into rage zombies, too."
12555,Both scenarios are equally likely.
12556,I have been saying this for months.
12557,I don’t care what anyone says except Fauci.
12558,"I don’t care if my job says I need to come back to the office full time (they won’t, execs love wfh), I don’t care if I’m the only one of my friends still being cautious (I won’t be), if Fauci says I need to behave a certain way, I will."
12559,"Not for myself, for my mom."
12560,She’s in her 70s and her health isn’t the best.
12561,"For her, I will do whatever this man says is best."
12562,"If it was just about me, I probably wouldn’t be so cautious about catching it myself (still would take every precaution not to spread though) but I’m so scared of being it home, it’s exhausting."
12563,"I will get the vaccine, I will still wear a mask, I will still socially distance until this man tells me I don’t need to anymore."
12564,"Actually, _technically_ the UK is _not_ part of the EU, just subject to their laws."
12565,Not for long though!
12566,There isn’t “knowing” in science.
12567,There are only answers based on evidence and data.
12568,Fauci is simply giving his professional opinion based on data and loosely connected facts.
12569,"Even if there was a way to definitively know, it shouldn’t matter to us."
12570,We still have wear masks and social distance until further notice
12571,&gt; Go ahead.
12572,"Google it for yourself 

No, you show me what you've been reading."
12573,What new data?
12574,Didn't Faucci say stadiums could be full by the spring?
12575,I liked that estimate better.
12576,I would say late 2021 is a worst-case scenario
12577,Sorry I was being sarcastic.
12578,How is he arguing against science?
12579,"Also, why are you calling him a nazi?"
12580,"From what I've seen, maternity wards are not generally commandeered for Covid patients."
12581,"I've heard of a couple places where mothers have been re-routed to different hospitals, but not one case of a mother not having a delivery room and doctor, even in the worst-hit areas."
12582,"My maternity hospital in particular is ""covid-free"", which is great for most of us, but if we do test positive when we're in labor, it means we go to a covid/general hospital to give birth, which ngl is pretty terrifying."
12583,"But I'm total quarantining for the few weeks before my due date, even more so than now, so hopefully that won't be an issue."
12584,"I agree that we have no data on the long-term safety of the vaccine, but IMO the immediate need for mass vaccination outweighs the risks of potential long-term safety issues."
12585,The vast majority of experts in the field say that it's a good idea for almost everyone to take the vaccine.
12586,You and I don't know more than the experts.
12587,That’s a bit clickbaity.
12588,It’s ultraviolet light that kills the virus.
12589,Regular LEDs won’t do shit.
12590,10% of almost 330 million is 33 million Americans without it.
12591,That's 30 million too many.
12592,Happy cake day to you!
12593,"I'd feel pretty fuckin stupid if I got covid and had to be hospitalized because I didnt get  vaccine, because of some fucking conspiracy that Bill Gates was trying to infect me with nano tech to track my movements because bla bla bla."
12594,Honestly I cant even keep up with shit ppl are spewing.
12595,The world is going mad and every moron with smartphone has a platform.
12596,Fuck it I'm going to bed.
12597,Lmao that’s incredible.
12598,I don’t even know why he’d attempt serious arguments with that username.
12599,It’s funny when picking it out but now I’m genuinely thrown for a loop at what he’s getting at
12600,It's about timing---they aren't going to have as many people vaccinated as the US or Europe ahead of the Olympics.
12601,Mid-fall what the fuck?
12602,Aw man too far :(
12603,"92% of this hoax is based on the fact those stickers look like a check mark next to ""I got accinated"" which I'm sure stupid people read as 'assassinated.'"
12604,"&gt; Please research for 5 minutes

You made a claim."
12605,You provide the source.
12606,Otherwise your words are meaningless and will be ignored.
12607,"like I said, you don't know what it means"
12608,"Well, yes, but that's also the problem."
12609,We may find that a vaccinated person has an identical viral load to someone that would be symptomatic if they were not vaccinated.
12610,That's *worse* for spread than what we have now because you'd have asymptomatic people having the ability to be super spreaders.
12611,I really hope it's what you said but the point is we don't know yet.
12612,They also don’t have a Murdoch monopoly media that has vested interests who then use their power to influence the public to vote for their puppet to lead the country.
12613,It’s quite obvious the leaders of some of these so called free democratic countries have no true backbone and are just in power to serve the Murdoch master.
12614,"Covid forced me to check out resistance band training and I’m telling you, I’m never going back."
12615,I’m stronger than I’ve ever been and you can work out anywhere.
12616,If I had found these before the pandemic I would have cancelled my gym membership.
12617,Clear answers sometimes don’t exist.
12618,Stop freaking out about it and take some time away from COVID.

12623,"I’ve been social distancing like crazy (or, you know, like you’re supposed to) and still we’ve had six or seven scares since March."
12624,"So far so good, but once my biggest risk factor is taken out, I’m pretty much going n the clear for not getting COVID (assuming I can manage to stay away from social stuff and eating out, which I fully intend to do)."
12625,"Not zero, but hardly worse than say, opening the borders to countries with endemic measles."
12626,And 90% of those are overpaying for it.
12627,But that’s good enough right?
12628,15 days to flatten the curve...
12629,Foreal!
12630,"Fauci has also said we're probably never gonna be able to eradicate COVID, so why can't we move on once the at risk folks are vaccinated?"
12631,This disease does not present a shutdown-the-world level risk to the entire population.
12632,Look up the Terror Management Theory.
12633,Thank you.
12634,He also died not of COVID but of dementia/cancer.
12635,So it was the same thing.
12636,All of the sudden he was transferred from a hospital (where we could visit) to a nursing home where it was forbidden.
12637,He was there about 5-weeks and we never got to say goodbye.
12638,Just a lonely phone call at 4:00 saying he was gone.
12639,Sorry you lost your mother in a similar way.
12640,That’s part of the untold pain of all of this.
12641,"And why I so angry when ignorant people say things like “99% survival rate!” Even if that were true, and even if 300k deaths wasn’t enough to make you have a heart, there’s probably 10s of thousands of people like us who lost our last moments with family, even though their actual death wasn’t “Covid.” 

It’s so inhuman to me."
12642,To think about how many people out here have suffered and people are so callous.
12643,"Again, very sorry you lost your mom."
12644,Such an RCT has already been attempted: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817
12645,And?
12646,"One fucking year, dude."
12647,You sound like a child.
12648,Remember when everything was going to be settled by Easter because that’s a very special day?
12649,"I mean, making babies is the fun part."
12650,"With Disneyland closed, what else is there to do?"
12651,Completely an asshole.
12652,You first Fauci
12653,I think I can explain at least.
12654,Not trying to defend it.
12655,"If you keep human cell lines alive with the consent of the donor or harm to them, you're respecting them as a person."
12656,"If you keep cell lines alive without consent or harvest them by doing harm, that's can still be okay *if they come from livestock."
12657,* (Needless cruelty is still not okay.)
12658,The objection is that it's a moral bad to treat humans as livestock or to benefit from those who have.
12659,My brother told me while I was walking with him that my sister said to him that she didn't believe in it and there was no convincing her that it is real
12660,This is great news
12661,And people say lockdown is bullshit.
12662,People sneaking out of their houses probably 😂
12663,The more people that get the vaccine and come out ok the less resistance their will be
12664,"""*it'll just..."
12665,"Disappear... Like *magic**"" said the fool."
12666,"I’m Johnny Knoxville and this is “the fallacy of relative privation”

I’m not stupid enough to think that’s a good argument, I’m sorry if you are."
12667,Not for me
12668,I'm here in LA too and worried as well.
12669,How bad will it get?
12670,I'm not a good person to ask because I'm not a scientist or a data analyst.
12671,"But since I work from home and don't really have anywhere to be, I check the graphs for new cases, deaths, hospitalizations for each state at the end of each day (there's a page on the nyt's website that sorts them well)."
12672,If I were going to go based on that I'd say probably the next six weeks will be worst of it.
12673,The one silver lining I've noted in the curves that went up really fast is that once they peaked the also went down really fast.
12674,But downside is we don't know how far up it will go yet.
12675,"ND was #1 for weeks and for a while each night I'd look at it and think ""it's so high, there's no way it can get any higher,"" and yet the next day and the next day it would go higher and higher still."
12676,I was shocked.
12677,But now I look at and it's dropping like a stone off the empire state building.
12678,It started once 1 out of every 10 people were confirmed positive in the state - that would mean we might have to hit 1 mil confirmed cases in LA county.
12679,"Sigh... new hot spots are CA, TN, RI, and AZ"
12680,"I mean, I'm sure many of the buildings will be reused...but it just wont be nice and new/renovated by 2032 or whatever."
12681,But we do know lots of things.
12682,We know mRNA breaks down rapidly in the human body.
12683,We know the rate of serious complications while the mRNA is active in the body is very low.
12684,"Incidentally, we also know that over 1.5 million people have died from this virus."
12685,"And we do **not** know the long-term complications the virus may cause because, unlike the vaccine, it and the damage it causes can be present in the body long term."

12690,absolutely disgusting and heartless.
12691,My bf was told by a driver who did it full time that the way to make money is by being on all the apps all the time that way you have way more options and can choose better deliveries
12692,I hope his case remains mild and that he recovers quickly.
12693,Same.
12694,I wouldn't be surprised if it's not all that different by income.
12695,"Low-income workers are more likely to have to be physically at work, or even out of work, right now, which makes having children an extremely poor decision."
12696,"Higher-income workers are already more likely to have lower birth rates, so presumably they would also recognize that pandemics and kids don't mix well."
12697,But on the other hand maybe these pairs were more likely to decide that they could handle it.

12905,"Yes, there are effects beyond mortality."
12906,"But if you can't live with that level of risk, you have no business *driving a car*."

13005,You have a point.
13006,I could have been infected and asymptomatic or extremely mild.
13007,"They test u prior to each injection and would let you know if you were positive or had antibodies, but since taking the 2nd injection I haven't tested, so is there a possibility I got it and don't show or feel symptoms...They did draw blood on later visits, maybe checking for that, idk."

13012,"I agree, but, say you’ve got a vial with seven instead of five."
13013,Maybe four of them throughout a day.
13014,"I don’t imagine it would be difficult at all for somebody so motivated to pocket four doses that day, still leaving one extra dose in those four vials, and all the other extras in all the other vials."

13016,Yes the wave is a real thing.
13017,I’ve watched them all closely...US and Europe.
13018,Some dropped off with lockdowns...some without.

13132,"The amount you would get in a vaccine is so minuscule compared to how big a human is, even a small human... there is just not that much quality evidence that it has any negative effect despite the millions and millions of doses given annually."

13150,Defunding the police departments won’t really have the desired effect of making the cops more accountable.
13151,"It took a bit of research and asking actual cops in my local area, but when it comes down to it."
13152,Police Unions are to blame for racist/corrupt/brutally violent cops getting away with horrendous acts.
13153,"It’s the unions that provide the legal defense for the officer, it’s the unions who try to demand officers be tried in other counties in order help them get away with their crimes."

You’re putting words in my mouth and making up my thought process."
13209,"No I absolutely would not be the first in line for a brand new vaccine or even try a new medication any year, Covid or no Covid."

13216,"Hardly anyone in my hospital did this, this was all the way back in March."
13217,My hospital was the first in Georgia to have a Covid positive patient.
13218,"When I was told I was going to be a part of this team I didn’t whine, cry, or quit."
13219,I got my 2 shitty little N95’s that were suppose to last 10 days and got to work.
13220,Seeing a brand new virus absolute decimate families and lives.
13221,Then my hospital opened up a mobile unit out in the fucking front parking lot made of shipping containers and I helped care for them there.
13222,"I didn’t whine, cry, or quit."

13234,I'm quite concerned about this tight temp requirement.
13235,Less so for going below -70 C and more about going above.
13236,I live in Romania and we're getting the Pfizer vaccine because we're part of the EU.
13237,I'm strongly considering getting it for myself and my family ASAP but the Romanian medical system is FAR FAR from those in the West and there is a serious chance the temp requirement will be violated without me being able to tell.
13238,Then what?
13239,What happens when injected with artificially built but degraded mRNA?

13389,I read it as working people keep society functioning and are at more risk of infection so they should be prioritized.
13390,I think you read it as.
13391,More philosophical claim that some people are more worthy of care as others.
13392,I could see it being read that way too I guess.
13393,It’s hard to say without them clarifying what exactly they meant.

13418,Just stop doing it please.
13419,Thanks!
13420,It’s not about them getting sick.
13421,It’s about them spreading it to people who are at risk of getting seriously ill and dying from it.
13422,It’s about keeping the active cases down so we don’t overload the ICUs so when someone IS in a car accident they don’t die because staff and resources are tied up with Covid cases (currently happening).
13423,My wife is a Covid nurse that takes cases over the phone.
13424,"She’s personally had to talk to people one week, then their grieving spouse the next because they had died from it."

13463,FHM could've done a lot more to stop the spread - within the legal framework.
13464,"The most obvious would be to act faster, the same measures enacted a few weeks earlier could've probably saved a lot of lives during both waves."
13465,They are also free to advice the government to come up with stricter measures.
13466,"While the constitution restricts a full-on lockdown in the form of stay-at-home orders, there is still a lot more that could've been done."
13467,"For example the temporary pandemic law in spring was never used, and the new pandemic law should've been prepared much earlier so that it would've been ready in time."

13510,"I'm actually kind of surprised the daily case numbers in NJ are that high at this point, even with people staying at home for the most part...considering how bad Spring was, I would assume there's a lot more immunity but it just shows that there's still a lot of people to infect."
13511,This.
13512,"Once old folks and compromised groups are protected, this pretty much will be like the flu for the majority of people."
13513,"Might knock them on their ass for a week or two, but most people will just deal with it for the freedom it gives them."
13514,"It’ll depend both on the person in charge and people’s independent decisions(I’d say ~25% of folks will stay pseudo quarantined until they themselves get the vaccine), but we’ll probably be near normal by april/may next year, if you choose to"

13635,"That may be due, in some part, to better testing and reporting though."
13636,"While true, a huge chunk died from famine, disease, or intentional genocide."
13637,"Combat, brutal as it was, was a smaller killer."
13638,"War gets all the headlines, but his brothers Plague and Famine really do the heavy lifting."

13640,"Yes, but the Swedish density is also a *bit* misleading."
13641,"It's still a factor that should play in our favor, though"
13642,They don't want to smell their own breath.
13643,I'd presume most don't brush their tooth or have much oral hygiene.
13644,The boiled egg and mcfish sandwiches they eat at breakfast don't improve things either.
13645,I mean it seems logical no?
13646,If the vaccine hasn’t been tested on his age group and the professionals are saying people in that group shouldn’t get it yet then isn’t that the right answer?
13647,Do we trust science or not?
13648,I dont know why I'm doing this.
13649,I'm arguing with someone getting their facts from some twitter feed.
13650,"But ok, I'll bring some facts."
13651,"Excess deaths above averageL

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm
Do the math and you will see +320k above ""normal"" 

12 month average of deaths, 2019, June: 2,823,000 

12 month average of deaths, 2020 (closest to present data CDC has published in the link below) 3,038,000, so + 215,000 above the year before."
13652,"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm

I don't believe you are a redneck."
13653,I just think you are buying into a narrative that is wholly untrue for whatever reason and its frustrating to see people believing there is some grand conspiracy afoot.
13654,"Like, chill man."
13655,Pandemics exist.
13656,This one is real.
13657,Lots of people are dead because of it.
13658,"ITs no Black Death, but damn dude why are you insisting things are better than they actually are?"
13659,Was looking for this.
13660,Man how Reddit has changed
13661,The roaring 20's didn't have a future of uncontrollable climate extinction staring down at it.
13662,You forgot the super-bowl.
13663,"Giant groups of people getting together and shouting for their teams while getting drunk, what could possibly go wrong?"
13664,I'm not convinced he's warm *or* nice.
13665,"Yes, I have already understood that distinction."
13666,Thanks.
13667,I appreciate the willingness to help the rest of us understand.
13668,I especially loved reading how contractors are not necessary.
13669,I would have loved to have seen all the contractors stay home for the wfh crowd.
13670,"The whining when there was no one available to deal with leaking roofs, failing plumbing or electrical would have been fun to see."
13671,Or if Home Depot actually closed and then the fridge or oven died.
13672,"You're a pretty bad troll buddy, this was fun 😂"
13673,It isn’t good.
13674,"But California is 40th per capita in deaths so far, so it isn’t like we are North Dakota."
13675,True!
13676,Thank you for the kind words!
13677,Euphoric?
13678,Why do the Brits get get extacy in their vaccines?
13679,No fair!
13680,!
13681,I understand.
13682,"We moved earlier this year, haven't been to a new church, haven't had neighbors over."
13683,Keep strong.
13684,This is the time to redouble your efforts and be diligent.
13685,I’ve eaten in that dining room.
13686,"It’s beautiful, and clearly in some people’s opinion it’s a meal to die for."
13687,"They have a dress code for the dining room, but masks aren’t part of it, just a collared shirt."
13688,"For the second time, we are MONTHS (and Faucci is talking about fall 2021) away from needing to actually promote the vaccine."
13689,"If you have 10 vaccines and 10000 people that want to get it, you have no need to promote it."
13690,"If you have more vaccines that people want and your objective is now to convince more people to get the shot, then by all means promote it."
13691,"But we don't need promotion right now, let rich and famous people that can be used to promote it stay in their goddamn mansions and get the shot to a medic that saves lives and lives in a studio apartment instead."
13692,"""Well known facts"" are totally useless as a source."
13693,It's a well known fact that the great wall of China can be seen from space.
13694,That doesn't mean it is true.
13695,Great but when it will be available for the public?
13696,It sets a dangerous precedent.
13697,&gt;You don’t think that saving millions of lives and restoring the economy is a valid reason to have to show papers?
13698,No.
13699,That again sets a precedent.
13700,&gt;Science does not care if you think the vaccine is safe.
13701,Science can be wrong.
13702,It isn't infallible.
13703,"Even worse, this is about the family of a news reporter."
13704,You would think they would be even more informed.
13705,I guess I didn’t realize how lucky I am that people in my family take it seriously.
13706,"You are right, what I meant is that people in general isnt very active in having them removed."
13707,If it was a election I think most people would vote to have them removed.
13708,Besides the democratic aspects they cost a lot of money better spent elsewhere and its unfair that they get paid so much for doing basically nothing.
13709,I hope someday you'll join us...
13710,"Yes, but only because of 102 years of medical advancement."
13711,"We didn't have supplemental oxygen, or ventilators, or our understanding of various vitamins and how they support the immune system, or our understanding of the cytokine storm and how to manage it... etc."
13712,COVID-19 would probably be as deadly if not worse than Spanish Flu if we didn't have modern medicine letting us battle it on less uneven footing.
13713,And we're still getting our asses handed to us.
13714,"That would be like using dead people to fertilize the soil and grow crops, can't have that, gotta shoot them into space."
13715,"In other news, the fetuses in question were aborted in [1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WI-38)."
13716,"and [1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC-5)., that's some good mileage."
13717,"2021 is a write off, as far as I'm concerned."
13718,"If it is over sooner I will be happy to be wrong, but I'm not getting my hopes up for ""spring"" or ""summer"" and then being disappointed when I'm still living like this in October."
13719,Appears the COVID is moving from the Midwest to Cal.
13720,California is still 40th on deaths per capita.
13721,Way ahead of most states including the rural ones.
13722,"While they haven’t been perfect, California has been much more reasonable than the vast majority of states."
13723,It is pretty shocking after doing so well for so long things are starting to fall apart.
13724,Well it's understandable due to my aggressive tone.
13725,"I'm already sick of seeing rich/connected/famous people gloating about getting the vaccine and talking about how they are ""helping set an example"" when people are already desperate for access and I know it's going to get worse."
13726,...I never replied to you?
13727,My comment was in reply to Tay\_ma45.
13728,Never read any of your comments until just now.
13729,Technically correct
13730,My brother was in the hospital in January for pneumonia and that made all this much worse.I have only seen him 4 times this year and I'm pretty much the only person in my family to see him at all.
13731,I took a chance after he got back from the hospital because I was desperate to see if he was ok.
13732,He was not ok.
13733,He has dementia now so I'm afraid the next time I see him he won't remember me.
13734,It's all fucked.
13735,I really feel for you.
13736,I hope the best for you and your uncle.
13737,"I'm going to try, I hope I'm remembering this correctly, if I'm wrong on anything feel free to correct me, anyone/everyone:  


As babies develop in the womb the starting cells start to differentiate from each other and specialize into the parts they will become, various organs, bones, blood, etc., for a very general description of the process."
13738,"I seem to remember being told that the fetal cells are at the earliest stage of development, basically our cells at their most 'default' state; I hope I'm right, as I've always understood that this 'starting state' of fetal cells is the/a reason they divide so quickly and easily,  why they're so easy to manipulate, and so most handy for vaccines, research, and such."
13739,I hope I remembered all this correctly.
13740,"I'm sorry I can't get more technical I do only have a general understanding of this from OAC high school biology classes, a loooooong time ago."
13741,(I hope it helped if I did get this right.)
13742,The word is completely ruined.

13744,"He's a coward, an habitual liar and a malignant narcissist like donald trump."
13745,The US needs to quash him.
13746,4 new provinces
13747,It’s amazing the imaging work done with this virus.
13748,I think the issue is correlation and causation.
13749,Older people have much much higher rates of weak immune systems and other cohabiting factors.
13750,It might very well be that it isn’t age but really the factors cohabiting age.
13751,"Not that age still isn’t a useful cohort for vaccination, but at this point there should be statistical analysis if it is causation or correltaion"
13752,People ignore what they don't like.
13753,"I have that problem with people in my family, which is why I am looking for another place to live."
13754,"Quarantine, the movie, but in real life."
13755,"couple people, family, friends, one gets sick, doesnt do anything, they meet, they eat, one after one gets ill, some die, others visiting others in makeshift protective gear while already being feverish and having trouble to breath."

13757,"That's why China built hospitals and confiscated universities and stadiums, to place sick people in there with nurses and doctors on site."
13758,"this dude has really gone into manic mode with Sweden, all the while screaming about the ""Swedish brigade""."
13759,It's been going on for months.

13765,"This got my attention:

&gt;The image illustrates the astoundingly large number of viral particles that can be produced and released from infected human cells."
13766,"Ehre notes that in a lab dish containing about a million human cells, they’ve witnessed the virus explode from about 1,000 particles to about 10 million in just a couple of days."
13767,"&gt;The dramatic increase in viral particles helps to explain how COVID-19 spreads so easily from the lungs to other parts of the body and—all too often—on to other individuals, especially in crowded, indoor places where people aren’t able to keep their distance."
13768,"Hopefully, images like this one will help to inspire more of us this winter to avoid the crowds (especially indoors), wear masks, and wash our hands frequently."

13777,"A person you call “male” with sex organs of a typical biological female will not be able to have children, so why worry about it in this context?"
13778,"The truth is that there are lots of people who are ""drains"" on society."

13788,"Just get the virus, develop immunity and move on w you life."
13789,I did and I’m fine.
13790,Now my entire family has had it and we’re all good.
13791,No need for vaccines here.
13792,"And before you say “well just because you’ve had it doesn’t mean you can’t get it again or spread it”, all the same applies for you after you get the vaccine."
13793,"This attitude is how people spread it to others, and it's why people like are trying to figure out their first christmas without family members."
13794,Just because you aren't likely to die doesn't mean you aren't actively spreading to others who are.
13795,You can save grandma by giving her the shot.
13796,The kid going to school puts grandma at even greater risk since the kid may bring covid home.
13797,Depends on the state.

13819,"The dick factor is way too high 

I get it people are greedy (or needy if you want) and want to make money."
13820,Fundamental rule of business be prepared to make **zero**.
13821,Everyone has thought that property was the exception well in comes COVID to remind everyone what that is.
13822,If you don't want to make zero you liquidate (sell) and if you bought a lemon that can't sell you take a loss.
13823,You don't necessarily hold 3-6 months cash in a normal business.
13824,"You hold as much as the business model needs, and sometimes you use lines of credit if you go into the red to make payroll."
13825,"Maybe, being a decent landlord means holding a year or two years of rent in case nobody wants your unit and you have to survive recessions."
13826,What's two years of rent of a property worth hundreds of thousands?
13827,Not so much.
13828,Another reminder that personal finances (3-6 month emergency fund) is different than a business.
13829,"So yeah landlords, get ready to make zero or close down if a pandemic or war or aliens or any number of unlikely events happen."

13836,Countries like New Zealand and China took the virus seriously and now have growing economies.
13837,"Meanwhile in the U.S, Republicans have been calling it a hoax and actually intentionally spreading COVID against all scientific advice and we are left with this horror."
13838,"Unfortunately we will be dealing with what we voted for in 2016, for years to come as a result."
13839,"Not to mention that (1) this vaccine reaction will become even rarer when people with history of allergic reactions avoid this particular one and (2) the vaccine reaction only affects the person who has the reaction, while covid can be spread widely from a healthy person to people who *will* be affected and die."
13840,"Yeah, I got married this year, the venue wanted to reschedule (planned 105 ppl) us instead of a refund but only had weekdays available for next year and this was in august."
13841,We ended up getting our money back and had a tiny ceremony and dinner with our parents and siblings only.
13842,Why not both?
13843,Also I live in a situation where I can’t get one yet.
13844,I plan to get one but I shouldn’t be unable to date or be forever alone to assuage someone else’s fear.
13845,People aren’t going to do that.
13846,"Sure, if the outcomes for covid were a binary selection of ""death"" and ""totally fine"", that would make sense."
13847,Unfortunately that's not the case
13848,I can't stand Trump but I think it would be great if he got the vaccine on camera.
13849,I can't believe how many people want universal vaccine compliance but hate the idea of any sort of PR campaign that involves famous people getting the vaccine.
13850,I also have no way of knowing exactly how he came to get the vaccine.

13887,A large number of healthcare workers (and other high-exposure groups) are people who are already or could become pregnant.
13888,"As pregnancy is considered a high-risk category for covid, it's not at all obvious that not vaccinating is the safer route for those who have to work in high-exposure environments."
13889,Some of those people would prefer to be vaccinated after weighing the risks.
13890,"With a few exceptions, most vaccines are actually safe and recommended for pregnant women as the benefits outweigh the risks."

13894,"Essentially the report recommended this priority order:

1. residents in a care home for older adults and their carers
2. all those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers
3. all those 75 years of age and over
4. all those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals
5. all those 65 years of age and over
6. all individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality
7. all those 60 years of age and over
8. all those 55 years of age and over
9. all those 50 years of age and over

As Sir Ian McKellen is 81, he falls into priority group 2."
13895,"There are some logistical concerns in vaccinating group 1, notably, you want to bring the vaccine to the care homes rather than risk these elderly people being taken to the hospital (I imagine this isn't the easiest thing to do, especially for patients with dementia), however, the early rollout is only going to occur within hospital ""hubs"" due to the refrigeration and logistical constraints."

14211,"However, the similarity within each pair was significant with respect to body weight, percentage of fat, fat mass, and estimated subcutaneous fat, with about 3 times more variance among pairs than within them."

14220,"People still want to immigrate here, and those tend to be younger."
14221,"plus, our ratio of working age to seniors isn't as fucked as much of western europe or japan."
14222,"You can't be told, but the difference between the placebo and the vaccine would be noticeable."
14223,I'm in the Moderna trial and I'm about 100% sure I got a placebo.
14224,"It's just saline for the Moderna and Pfizer trials, so not even a mild local reaction pretty much cued me in on that front."
14225,"As much as I wanted my arm to hurt just a little, it didn't."
14226,"Okay, again."
14227,"Do you understand how vaccines work, yes or no?"
14228,"You’re opinion is selfish and based in fear, not science."
14229,At least you understand and will admit you don’t care about expert opinion
14230,"From the article:

&gt;Are we really safe?"
14231,Boyzell sometimes wondered.
14232,"When friends went to hug Andrida at Walmart, he teased, “Honey, you cannot do that anymore.” Bombarded with pandemic news, Boyzell leaned toward caution."
14233,The isolation was harder on his wife.
14234,"But after a September dinner party, Boyzell told her, “We have to slow down, because this thing is real, and it’s kicking up.”


They were going to Walmart and hugging people so that’s a clue."
14235,"After what China went through and we went through in NYC, I don’t know how people could just go on like this was nothing."
14236,Very civil... mask off eh
14237,"I don't know how restrictions are going to be relaxed as vaccinations progress, but where I live (Singapore) I don't see that getting vaccinated means very much on a personal level since we still can't travel overseas or have too many people gathered in a space."
14238,"Contact tracing via phone app/tracking tokens are a thing for us too, and masks are mandatory."
14239,"I don't see that going away until June at earliest, when a good 40-50% of the populace gets vaccinated."
14240,Maybe it'll be different in the US?
14241,Fuck you.
14242,Maybe it’s that he learned that he is not on the list to get the special antibody treatment.
14243,He is used to taking a prick
14244,Don't know way you're getting downvoted .
14245,"Fully, yes...but efficacy stsrts to really take off in 10-14 days after 1st dose."
14246,"Oh, it's absolutely not that Jeff Bezos cares about his employee's well-being."
14247,It's 100% that he wants to avoid lawsuits &amp; to have an excuse to be much more lax on covid guidelines.
14248,"If all Amazon employees are vaccinated, there aren't labor shortages because employees are sick."
14249,"You can have full capacity at grocery stores (both customers &amp; employees), making more sales."
14250,"And, from a PR standpoint, it looks great for Amazon to be advocating for this after their historically lackluster (irresponsible &amp; dangerous most of this time) response to the pandemic."
14251,Everything Amazon does is make more money.
14252,"Everyone knows that, &amp; this move isn't any different."
14253,"My point is, that shouldn't stop us from considering the EMPLOYEES - who have taken been working the frontlines of this pandemic, in extremely high risk environments."
14254,Should we reject every Amazon policy simply because it's based on profits?
14255,Simply because it's Amazon?
14256,"I mean, that's pretty much everybody."
14257,The few healthy young people working from home would be excluded.
14258,And there would be no effective method to keep them from walking in and getting one at that point.
14259,Callong other people shit stains when you say we should be sterilizing people.
14260,Damn dude get some help get off reddit maybe?
14261,"Yeah, I have a different opinion than them."

14263,The king sure is allowed to make political statements.
14264,"It’s a norm for him not to, but nothing is really forbidding him from doing it..."

14266,To the people that need it.

14268,You’re a blind man trying to lead other blind men.
14269,Keep it up Newsom.
14270,Doing a great job.
14271,Maybe some more restrictions and shutdowns would help.
14272,🤦‍♀️
14273,"If an adverse event is going to effect say 1/100,000 or 1 in a million people there is a good chance 0 people will experience it in a trial of a few ten thousand people."
14274,That’s why vaccines are monitored for rare safety effects after hitting the market.
14275,Source?
14276,That’s hilarious
14277,Those 12 people would strongly disagree.
14278,The fucking point is that life will **NOT** be normal unless oneself has gotten vaccinated.
14279,"I thought the government couldn't actually do much because of their constitution,  unless that's just a rumor."
14280,[removed]
14281,"I mean, historically this has been true but that's because A) most people did manual (farm) labor and needed to create additional low-calorie-consumptive labor, and B) people had 150-200% of the children they actually wanted so a good 3-4 made it to adulthood and cared for them in their old age"
14282,Better be a baby bust.
14283,You bring a kid into this world you're running a risk.

14290,Super fucked up
14291,I can’t read the article.
14292,But will comment that the original one shot vaccine was going to recruit 60k subjects.
14293,"They changed it last week and made it 40k, because they say they can get enough data with that amount."
14294,"Hope this is good news that results will be out soon, especially as someone who’s in the trial who got the vaccine (I think)"
14295,They locked down too much for too long and people have lost patience.
14296,They took away outdoor dining....even though there was zero science or data to show that was spreading the virus...and people went home to hang out with others...which is leading to spread.
14297,When you are too severe...it has a bad result.
14298,We haven’t had many school open.. and still we are completely floundering.
14299,"All we are allowed to do is walk with a mask outside, get gas, and grocery shop."
14300,Well those seem to go hand in hand.
14301,"Yes, more obvious things... 
LA is not in a different or worse situation than any other large metropolitan area in the US."
14302,"It’s just a more visible problem because the numbers are larger, which leads to more frantic headlines."
14303,The amount of attention is overblown and disproportionate to the reality on a per citizen basis.

14305,Exactly.
14306,Awesome how you cannot read.
14307,&gt; Schools should not be opened until the vaccines are widespread.
14308,"Then they need to provide financial relief, full stop."
14309,"Because the alternatives for the working poor and single parent households are: get fired and have the kid taken by the state for not being able to provide for them, or have the kid taken by the state for leaving a child alone all day."
14310,Either way I’m sure foster care is nice and covid free.
14311,There's no way the union survives my lifetime.
14312,"The coastal and landlocked states are so far away from each other culturally, politically, educationally, and ethnically that i cannot see anyone caring enough to sustain it."
14313,I identify much more with my state than i do with my country (which is to say none at all).
14314,"Phase 1 in most places is health care workers, emergency services personnel (Cops, firefighters, etc."

14328,He is much more than just a figure head but you don’t seem to know shit about what you’re saying.
14329,Nah I heard Morgan Freeman is a nightmare of a human being in real life.
14330,Oh nooo anyway
14331,But we don’t need 100 percent vaccinated for herd immunity though?
14332,What percent is necessary?

14342,"I wanted to highlight this specific paragraph in the article

&gt;Chrissy Helmer of Eco Chic said the community and its leaders “need to have a backbone for small businesses.” She called those hesitant to be out and about without masks “afraid” and told them to “stay home,” described some community members as “communists” and “snitches” and likened the plight of small business owners to having “yellow stars” on their shirts, a reference to the Jewish people targeted during the Holocaust."
14343,"&amp;#x200B;

Here is the full article, for those who can't access it

&gt;About 100 people gathered at the Vacaville Creek Walk Saturday afternoon for a rally organizers said was meant to support small businesses, give owners information on how to stay open despite COVID-19 and, essentially, bring the community together."
14344,"&gt;  
&gt;While some business owners did share moving stories of how new health protocols have affected their lives, the Unite Solano event was also at times political, a rallying cry for dissent and ultimately divisive."
14345,"&gt;  
&gt;Morne Van Stade of Journey Coffee talked about his initial success story, moving from South Africa 16 years ago."
14346,"He spoke of opening his business, of “living the dream that my ancestors talked about,” of feeling thankful and blessed."
14347,"&gt;  
&gt;But COVID-19 hit him hard, he said, as he followed every guideline despite losing more than $150,000 in sales."
14348,"And, he worried about his customers, staff and family, of keeping everyone afloat."
14349,"He eventually came to the realization, he said, that there is no health emergency."
14350,"So, he will fight."
14351,"&gt;  
&gt;“Journey has a mission just like your business has a mission,” he said."
14352,"“Stand up for the mission and the rights you have in this country.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Juan Desmarais of Primo’s Barbershop spoke of losing his license for staying open when the state ordered him to close."
14353,He called the requirement a “money and a power grab” and asked small business owners to rise up.
14354,"&gt;  
&gt;“Let’s do this together."
14355,"Move forward together,” he said."
14356,"&gt;  
&gt;Danny and Diane Jackson of The Brass Tap also spoke of struggling to care for themselves and their staff."
14357,"The current health order, Danny said, is not a lawful order."
14358,"&gt;  
&gt;“We are allowed to disobey an unlawful order,” he pointed out."
14359,"&gt;  
&gt;Chrissy Helmer of Eco Chic said the community and its leaders “need to have a backbone for small businesses.” She called those hesitant to be out and about without masks “afraid” and told them to “stay home,” described some community members as “communists” and “snitches” and likened the plight of small business owners to having “yellow stars” on their shirts, a reference to the Jewish people targeted during the Holocaust."
14360,"&gt;  
&gt;There were also references at the rally to creating a new California, waving of flags honoring President Donald Trump and calling the current health crisis not a serious one."
14361,"&gt;  
&gt;Mayor Ron Rowlett, reached by phone after the gathering, said he supports small businesses and wants them to do well."
14362,"&gt;  
&gt;“But we also want everyone to be safe,” he emphasized."
14363,"&gt;  
&gt;So he’s pushing to disconnect Vacaville from the Bay Area regional counts regarding ICU bed availability and aims to create protocols that will keep businesses open."
14364,This is \*exactly\* the kind of post that those promoting denialism/defeatism (for whatever reason) would make.
14365,"Starting with a 'I believe in science but...', then adding anecdotes (conveniently from a healthcare worker or scientist) that goes against evidence and healthcare advice, finally a 'I don't know anymore' to convince others to equivocate the accepted science (as we know it) with the propaganda."
14366,Are you being paid to post here?
14367,"I honestly don’t care if 2 are used for these 2 idiots, if it helps get their supporters on board and gets us all that closer to herd immunity, fucking let them, just like Biden, Obama, And Bush are getting it on camera too."
14368,You really are stupid.
14369,You’re taking about the long term effects of traditional vaccines that have been used for decades and are proven.
14370,"If you understood this new vaccine is nothing like the previous ones, you’d understand the general concern."
14371,South Korea is a good example.
14372,They’ve handled the virus better than most and Kim said they’re not in a rush to pick up the first vaccine that comes out.
14373,They’re concerned of long term effects of this new vaccine.
14374,They are waiting for Astra Zeneca like I told you earlier.
14375,Their are articles stating the test group was controlled with everyone under age 55.
14376,Theirs also articles stating white people had a much better outcome than Asians.
14377,There’s also Cornell who made a statement saying African Americans students won’t be required to get the new vaccine because they’re not confident what it will do to their bodies.
14378,I was shocked but you should have a look.
14379,Like I would believe some idiot on Reddit over one of the smartest countries in the world is beyond me.
14380,It’s all speculation at this point.
14381,This new vaccine can be Nobel peace prize worthy or not.
14382,We will see.
14383,For you to discount the chance of something going wrong just shows you’re a dumb blind sheep.
14384,Fuck Saudi Arabia.
14385,The world would be better without them in it.
14386,"Not a US republican, I'm sure it will be civil"
14387,&gt;Boyzell wiped his glasses and nodded as the bishop talked of trusting the hand of God.

14391,"Soon there would be a memorial for his brother-in-law, Bob, who had died in between."
14392,"Boyzell himself had fought COVID-19 and was only a week out of the hospital, where his sister had gone for treatment, too."

14394,If you consider 24th worst on a list of 220 countries to be ‘middle of the pack’.
14395,Agreed!
14396,If Tengell wasn’t so vocal they wouldn’t be the focus!
14397,I know.
14398,We also don’t do proper stimulus checks.
14399,Kinda wishful thinking.
14400,Oh well.
14401,"Here's the list of his contacts/movements in recent days:

&gt;On Wednesday, he met Portuguese Prime Minister Costa for lunch, and attended a cabinet meeting, according to the Elysee Palace."
14402,"&gt;On Tuesday, Macron met with various people including the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer."
14403,"&gt;On Monday, he attended a working lunch at the Elysee marking the 60th anniversary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where he met with Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez, European Council President Michel and OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria."
14404,"&gt;Macron was also at the European Council in Brussels last Thursday and Friday, which was attended by 25 of the 27 EU leaders (two were absent for Covid-related reasons)."
14405,Tragic....And more to come as the vaccine nears our reach.
14406,Since schools are mostly not in person...I think teachers wait til they are preparing to open again.
14407,Unless you teach in person.

14455,Literally the only thing I knew wit was when one of Trump’s mouthpieces tweeted something about a vaccine having been a big success for Warp Speed ... only to have the company concerned immediately tweet back that Warp Speed had nothing to do with the development.
14456,It was really the R&amp;D funding I was interested in.
14457,Paying for the delivery of the vaccine is great but it’s only remarkable in the US context because our healthcare system is usually so predatory.
14458,This is so scary.

14499,The head of the research department had to call me 90 minutes later to tell me I had the real thing.
14500,Also note pfizer said they will give everyone who had placebo the real dose on their next follow up.

14582,Gavin “let them eat cake” Newsom tried implementing restrictions and shutdowns but no one listened to him anymore because actions speak much louder than words.

14614,"IMO it's worth *remembering* some -- this is only *some* -- of traitor Trump's outrageous lies about the pandemic:

**January 22:** “We have it totally under control."
14615,It’s one person coming in from China.
14616,"It’s going to be just fine.”

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it."
14617,They know very much.
14618,"In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies."
14619,"We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this."
14620,"But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**March 2:** “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

**March 2:** “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

**March 4:** “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

**March 5:** “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

**March 5:** “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths."
14621,"We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

**March 6:** “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

**March 6:** “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test."
14622,They’re there.
14623,And the tests are beautiful….
14624,the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect.
14625,The transcription was perfect.
14626,Right?
14627,"This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

**March 6:** “I like this stuff."
14628,I really get it.
14629,"People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability."
14630,"Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

**March 6:** “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

**March 8:** “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

And the ultimate lie:  
**March 9:** “This blindsided the world.”

Remember, in 2018 Donald Trump closed the Obama-created Pandemic Response Team that would have been invaluable in this current Covid-19 crisis:  [“I Don’t Know Anything About It,” Trump Says About White House’s Elimination of Pandemic Response Team](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/i-dont-know-anything-about-it-trump-says-about-his-white-house-eliminating-the-pandemic-response-team.html)."
14631,"Trump left the country *defenseless* for the *long-predicted* pandemic, preferring some unproven, unscientific theory of ""herd immunity"" which fit in hand-in-glove with Trump's right-wing, Libertarian laissez faire capitalist view of the do-nothing role of gov't."
14632,Moderna swabbed after the first shot (which gives partial immunity to sickness) and before the second (95%).
14633,"The had 52 asymptomatic cases, 14 in the vaccinated group, 38 in control."
14634,"I’m not good at p-values, but in coin flip terms that result would come up only 1 in 2500 times by chance."
14635,So some small evidence that it prevents asymptomatic cases.
14636,"If the rising resistance to disease after the second shot is an indicator, resistance to asymptomatic infections might also go up further."
14637,"I wish they had swabbed again after round 2, but I get that means that 40k people have to come back in."
14638,"If you study the issue as I have, there are in fact rare instances when vaccines cause harm."
14639,"It is almost infinitesimally small, but when something like this happens to a family member, and the results are so severe that it more or less ruins an entire families life forever, the experience and the first hand experience literally dictates everything that follows."
14640,"I don’t blame them for that, as it is a truly exhausting and permanent life-wrecking situation."
14641,"However, not being a live witness to it (watching a perfectly healthy boy change into a completely ruined, unpredictable, uncontrollable ‘Jeckle and Hyde’ character overnight), I can still understand the reaction."
14642,"There is likely another factor that also allowed this reaction to occur, that is not present in the vast majority of cases, but, for the family that went through and continues to go through this decades later, it is still a matter of ‘but for the vaccine’ he would still be normal."
14643,"When this happens, the story spreads, and if you e known the patient to have previously been normal, and suddenly see the change, even if it’s just from ‘down the street’, you can still be left with the same conclusion."
14644,Especially absent any other explanation.
14645,I'm assuming mask usage is also preventing a lot of flu transmission.
14646,In this moment I am euphoric

14655,"If half do not take it, yes that will be an issue."
14656,"That said, i would wait a few more months before jumping to the conclusion so many people will not take it."
14657,The chance at ending the lockdowns is a powerful incentive and people have not really had a choice yet.
14658,In the abstract many people may be hesitant about the vaccine but when the choice actually comes many of those will likely decide the risks are worth it.

14795,Take 30% of that for low income and ill be generous and say half of those are between the ages of 5 and 12.
14796,"I wouldn't subsidize any kids outside that age group as lower than 5 they aren't in school anyway and over 12, well they can babysit themselves at that age."
14797,Thats 1.35 million kids.
14798,Give each kid $1k per month.
14799,That's 1.35 billion per month in california for 3 months more so about 4 billion total.
14800,The total state budget is $222 billion.
14801,So the cost would be close to 2% of the state budget.
14802,Expensive but doable with some sacrifice and budgeting.

14886,I thought everything was great because they didn't have the worst numbers in the world and because I'm not an epidemiologist.
14887,"/s                    
Anyway, I'm sorry to tell you are wrong."
14888,"Sweden has already more hospitals admissions than during the first wave (much less for ICU, though) as well as more daily deaths and obviously much more cases."

14935,As an icu nurse I am literally around airway secretions that are riddled with COVID.
14936,I am present for intimations that are high aerosolizing procedures which means COVID in the air in the room all over the place.

14938,I’m sorry if you think it’s selfish I’m not passing on it to give it to random guy who works from home who just wants to get an drink at the bar and get a haircut again who thinks his rights are being trampled on  because every expert in the world suggests wearing a mask will significantly help safe lives but that’s not his responsibility to make sure your grandma doesn’t get sick.

15105,No.
15106,"&gt;It doesnt matter what i think bc I'm not in charge uwu

I used to wonder why American democracy was such a failure, why barely half of Americans even vote."
15107,"Then I realized people like you say things like this; that you are okay with being controlled by others and having no say in the laws, which the founding fathers of this country wanted the citizens of the country to have."
15108,"How about you start to think for yourself, and vote for the person who will enact what you believe in

To be completely fair to you though, when we only have 2 choices and both are basically the same, yeah your vote doesn't really matter; America is basically an oligarchy controlled by the rich donors who have bought both parties."
15109,"But still, Americans should participate more in democracy and try to get money out of politics, but I digress

&gt;But to answer your question: i dont think it should be like, enforced door to door by the govt or anything but i absolutely think public schools and certain workplaces should require it with no exceptions save for genuine medical reasons, such as allergies to ingredients that cause known reactions."

15116,"Additionally, if the vaccine works so well, so long as you are vaccinated, you are fine, right?"

15120,"Yes, and we can look at countries like Vietnam or even China itself that have brought the crisis in their countries to a halt with no vaccine."
15121,"Life is basically back to normal there, Vietnam is one of the few countries who has seen economic growth (2.4%), and have had only 1,200 cases and I believe 34 deaths."

15123,"These solutions include but are not limited to: 1. again the Vietnam approach, 2. focus on treatments that have shown GREAT success, Donald Trump who is a fat old f\*\*\* got the proper treatments and was able to recover and was completely fine, antibody treatments, things like remdesivir, and other treatments have shown great success, why are treatments and the like being mass produced and rushed, which would save lives NOW than a vaccine, since a vaccine only helps prevent the spread and infection, but is irrelevant once the virus is in someone's body."

15130,"It is far more profitable to have a vaccine that EVERYONE (hundreds of millions, billions) needs to take, rather than focus on treatments that only the couple million infected need to take (and less, primarily the ones who have a bad reaction to the virus)."
15131,"**Let's focus on this point of treatments versus vaccines, why do you believe that a vaccine should be prioritized instead of treatments, wouldn't the logical approach be to focus on treatments, then vaccines?"

Yeah, I said it isn't that big of a deal to wear masks and exercise caution."

15972,That lifetime of bad habits also greatly increases your chances of dying from covid
15973,"So then, maybe, just maybe- if your master plan requires ALL 350 MILLION people in the US to follow the rules correctly, without fail, EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY- it’s a shitty fucking plan that was never going to work."
15974,"There are too many variables in life to ensure that people will always follow the rules

We can’t even keep people from shooting each other during normal times"
15975,Ah... that can stay in the past
15976,"That's the thing, as you said, people at higher risk have been following precautions long before Covid and I assume they've been the most serious in their exposure."
15977,Same with old people and those who also have another chronic health issue.
15978,"It's really young people and those a little older accusing and blaming each other for what basically amounts to people who had 3 months to live, dying in 2 weeks instead, with covid, not completely from covid."
15979,It all adds up.
15980,should be way more strict.
15981,the fact that malls are even open is insane
15982,"Why, is Silk Road open for biz again?"
15983,"People of all ages die of rare things every day, and always have... and we don’t shut down vast swaths of society for any of them."
15984,"Thanksgiving was 3 weeks ago, and cases did rise afterwards."
15985,But it seems anybody who got sick at Thanksgiving stayed home and didn't spread it to anybody else?
15986,Putin is getting good at this.
15987,Why?
15988,"Most vaccines have an extremely limited chance of not stopping transmission, why should COVID be any different?"
15989,This is the immunity/reinfection argument all over again.
15990,And frankly they were enacted far too late.
15991,The entire rest of the nation is headed for similar outcomes.
15992,"Because right now everyone's looking at ""oh we have 25% left"" not realizing that cases lag by about two weeks."
15993,"Do everything you can to avoid covid-19, even more than you were doing before, because if you get it right now and need ICU treatment in 10 to 14 days you are probably not going to get it."
15994,20k?
15995,South Korea has 52 million people and we have 330 million aka 0.15 amount of people.
15996,"~1000/0.15 is only ~7000 cases, not 20k."
15997,It's nowhere near as bad as you're saying.
15998,I'm at home and my spouse has to go in to work every day.
15999,"They are having contractors in and out not wearing masks, multiple employees testing positive and people WITH SYMPTOMS still coming in to work."
16000,"I've been scouring the net this afternoon to see if there are any recourse between ""quit the job"" or ""hope you don't get it"""
16001,"Definitely makes it more complicated (from what I hear, not trans myself)."
16002,"Especially for trans women who date men, because while everyone has the potential to be transphobic, statistically trans women face a lot of violence from men."
16003,"Really only started turning in mid-November, up until then it was under control with very low numbers."
16004,Past 2-3 weeks have been embarrassing.
16005,Of course they are going to die after Covid19.
16006,Everybody dies...
16007,"I'd agree, the full deaths impact and other impacts of this disease are far from fly quantified."
16008,Especially people who haven't gone to the hospital due to fear of getting covid-19.
16009,But that's nothing new in the USA's shitty healthcare system.
16010,"A lot of people die every year in the usa needlessly because they dont go, and it is worse because of covid-19."
16011,"Also, downvotes for pointing out that herd immunity is coming from people getting sick and the vaccines?"
16012,Wtf?
16013,Are people here expecting to stay on lockdowns for another 10 years or something?
16014,True.
16015,But I’m halfway convinced I have Covid right now.
16016,And my Doc’s suggestion was just to self quarantine and pretend it’s Covid(telemedicine).
16017,Advised I could get tested but it won’t really change much.
16018,And personally I agree with this philosophy.
16019,"If it’s not covid, I really don’t want to be chilling in a doctors office and potentially contract it, or aid in the potential spread if I do have it."

16025,"Someone who is skeptical about a disease, the treatment for that disease, the prevention of that disease, and anything else to do with that disease, should speak to a medical professional."
16026,"As much as we on Reddit like to believe we're experts, a miniscule number of us have any qualifications whatsoever."
16027,"If you don't have a doctor, call your local department of public health."
16028,They'll point you in the right direction.
16029,You may even be able to talk to a doctor or nurse over the phone to get your questions answered.
16030,Yay.
16031,"One would think, but that was never the plan."
16032,The plan was to let people die in the US in search of herd immunity via natural infection hence the situation we find ourselves in (at least in the US).
16033,It's clear there are no consequences for this behavior (and some people actively encourage it).
16034,"Thats right, people shouldn't wear them."
16035,They should be saved for medical personnel....even though they don't work.

16049,Add Bluetooth or geo trackers to every single participants phone which automatically ping when they leave a specific zone
16050,"Lol, this ain’t happening."
16051,Fucking heartbreaking.
16052,Absolutely heartbreaking.
16053,Who wants to lockdown forever?
16054,Be specific.
16055,Lockdowns are usually an admission of failure to control the spread.
16056,No country planned to have to lock down this autumn.
16057,[removed]
16058,Not nearly what their worth is though.
16059,I used to work for a company that staffed nurses.
16060,The company would charge hospitals anywhere from $80-$150 per hour at base while largely paying nurses a max of $50-$80 an hour.
16061,"Sure you can make an argument that my company made *some* sort of tangible value out of connecting nurses with hospitals, but we were largely middlemen who didn't deserve the 30-50% of value that was almost exclusively derived from the nurses themselves."
16062,It was all synthetic overhead designed to extract value from hospitals that was already set aside to pay for nurses.
16063,I felt disgusting working there because I knew I was directly contributing to the outrageous and unnecessary healthcare costs in this country.
16064,"They get paid extremely well in comparison to most wage workers in the US, but that doesn't mean they're properly compensated by a mile."
16065,"And then we place a bunch of others nearby, who won't die, but may have long-term effects from it."
16066,Antivax will finally figure out what heavy metals are in it!
16067,"In this instance neighbors are in it together, though it probably doesn't help that they're hanging out with each other and helping spread the virus."
16068,Take it.
16069,&gt;that would mean that around 10-20% of people in the US have been infected.
16070,&gt;That's enough to start slowing the spread of the virus.
16071,"Not full herd immunity, but eventually enough to slow the spread to where fewer people are in the hospital the next day vs the last day."
16072,Not really.
16073,I saw an analysis done around 1.5 months ago that shows that the hardest-hit zip codes in New York City were STILL the ones with the most cases per capita.
16074,"Basically, stuff like having more people who were essential workers or otherwise more exposed swamped any possible benefit from having 20% of the population already having it."
16075,This is going to lead to some rather strange hookups.
16076,The crowd over at This Week in Virology were talking about this on [their most recent episode.
16077,](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-694/)
16078,Yeah it's a bit arbitrary.
16079,"I mostly chose it because I couldn't fit all European countries, and having countries of the same size means that the per capita death rate has like equal weight."
16080,Small countries or very large countries tend to be harder to compare since they have more of less internal variation.

16113,Just seems meaningless.
16114,I’m not saying it is a great idea it’s a terrible look though
16115,Oh man I thought you were talking about the vaccine causing ED
16116,I think the current zeitgeist is that covid mostly killed people who were more likely to die anyway (most of our deaths have been among the elderly).
16117,"That's in no way an excuse for how poorly the powers that be handled the situation, but it's still a factor."
16118,If you also factor in decreased travel and spread of other diseases (like the flu) that's probably mitigated the overall death toll a bit.
16119,Basically we didn't do a whole lot of stuff that normally gets people killed so it kind of evened out.
16120,The current covid wave may change that though.
16121,It's getting pretty bad.

16277,Agreed.
16278,The virus is being over played and over exaggerated.
16279,My entire family (family of 8) got the virus.
16280,We take care of ourselves and we’re all completely fine.
16281,Grandfather came and had thanksgiving with us knowing we had it.

16292,"It may seem weird, but have you considered that I may not be American, or basing what I am saying on the CDC?"
16293,I don’t think anything I said was specific to the US or either American continent?
16294,"So my partner is planning on visiting me in February/March, he lives in Boston and I live in Mexico, he sent me MA's vaccine plan, and it said they expect everyone to be vaccinated by June, in Mexico because of corruption who knows when I'll get the vaccine (I'm 24 so I'm ""supposed"" to get it between June 2021 and March 2022), my parents are over 60 so they're high risk, they're supposed to be able to get it starting february but again, who knows."
16295,"My question is, would it be safer for me to visit him instead?"
16296,"I wanna think it is because if most people are already vaccinated by then I have less risk of catching it there than he has of catching it here, this is assuming he gets it by time the trip comes and if he hasn't gotten it."
16297,"Our fifteen cases will go to zero, it will be like magic."

16299,"Also, kids can't spread this"
16300,i guess trying to highlight that Covid death number.
16301,I mean its just lazy journalism  to generate clicks like you said you could say that about heart disease.
16302,Or those who have seen their coworkers struggle trying to deal with having their kids interrupt their working day are also less likely to have kids.
16303,No country is doing 2000 per month *for all citizens*.
16304,They are doing it based on being disadvantaged by the virus.
16305,The US was doing much more than that for that group.

16312,My parents are retired.
16313,And my sister has homeschooled her two kids for years and my brother in law has worked from home for years.
16314,So its easy to isolate for everyone in our bubble.
16315,My husband is a manager at a Target... so unfortunately he's the most likely to bring something to them and we obviously won't have him isolate from them.
16316,He just takes extra precautions.
16317,You're doing what you think is best for your baby.

16341,"In fact, spoiling your baby by always being there to feed, soothe, and comfort builds their confidence that their basic needs will always be met."

16356,So is there an online tracker for vaccinations by state/ county/ city/ etc for the US I can keep checking on?
16357,Kind of curious to see how the vaccinations are working
16358,Absolutely valid comparisons I had not thought about.
16359,My main focus was the reporting on just the number of cases does not tell the whole picture as there other aspects at play.

16375,My husband is a doctor in one of the worst COVID units in our state for both waves.
16376,Their ICU has been full for weeks.
16377,At the end of every shift he has been updating DNRs because it's just cruel to be stuck in a hospital in your old age.
16378,70 year olds with plenty of life ahead of them are dying (COVID or not) because there's no other option.
16379,What would stop it is if those patients in care homes and elderly got the vaccine as soon as possible.
16380,But that won't be for months because so many medical staff (who have varying levels of exposure to it) need it.
16381,So they're stuck for weeks with overflowing hospital floors.
16382,Trickle down approach from the state health department isn't going to affective for a lot of states.
16383,Especially when we treated our public health officials like absolute shit during the time we needed them the most.

16389,Not a single person was wearing a mask.
16390,If everyone was wearing a mask then there seating arrangement would not be affected but it must be safer for everyone in that enclosed space so I don't know how saying people would behave differently if masks were mandated is a plausible argument in situations like that.
16391,"Was it ""America bad""?"
16392,Elected officials too.
16393,Cuomo was saying just a few weeks before the election how the vaccine wasn't going to be properly tested and NY was going to verify it themselves and people were right to be skeptical.
16394,Now he's saying he doesn't understand why people won't get the vaccine and that everyone needs to get it.
16395,They're confused because you utilized the vaccine to get in polticial pot shots and now you're flipping your message.
16396,The inconsistencies are maddening.
16397,It doesn't help us trying to promote the vaccine at all.

16436,Tegnell said it was not in his place to comment on the king's thoughts and that it would have to be judged later on.

Like I said earlier, if birth rates drop sharply enough that, fundamentally, the production of goods or services are threatened, then it represents a real risk for people in the middle age or elderly age that rely upon the future generations to produce essential goods or services older generations themselves cannot produce

An example is the lack of young caretakers/nurses to take care of a large elderly population  in hospitals/hospices/retirement homes or a lack of strong, young workers to do physical work necessary for middle aged/elderly people who cannot field hard labor like landscaping, construction, utility work, trade work, etc."

16874,"However, when I called several places they all ask me if I have covid."
16875,"When I say no, I am told they can't help me because all they are doing at the moment is covid cases."
16876,"Today, neither my rheumatologist or primary doctor were surprised when I told them about it."
16877,Luckily my primary doctor has a place that is taking non-covid patients and sent in a referral.
16878,The first call I made was to the local hospital that does all my testing.
16879,They were the first to inform me only covid cases are being scheduled.
16880,At a hospital...
16881,"I'm aware, there's nothing to suggest they're widespread or significant enough to consider."
16882,HE SAID YOU SHALL NOT PASS HIS ESOPHA-GAS!
16883,Ummmmm... Southern California AM radio disagrees!
16884,Who am I to trust?
16885,No.
16886,But I will continue to insist that the immunocompromised will be safe in taking the vaccine.
16887,People will feel sick when they take the covid vaccine because the vaccine will trigger an immune response.
16888,It was a downplay as there was evidence of far far more deaths.
16889,Partly intentionally not losing face but also partly not having accurate data for many reasons.
16890,People were dying in hospital hallways before admission and at home.
16891,"Many sick did not get treatment, reliable tests didn't come for a long time."
16892,In my Australia i was watching the chinese social media seeing how bad it was for a long time and knew it was chinese new year time so would have been wide spread.
16893,Wuhan is somewhat of a junction city too with many travellers going through there on-route to their final destination.
16894,"Our Government was simply asking people who were in Wuhan in the last 14 days to please self isolate, when they should have been quarantining all international arrivals."
16895,Most of our cases ended up coming from America (Thanks Tom Hanks).
16896,They also told people not to wear masks.
16897,And encouraged people to go to the Chinese areas that were down on business in Jan/Feb and accused people of Racism for not going to China town.
16898,Anyone with Chinese family in Australia knows that they all have someone that is currently visiting from China or someone who has just got back from a trip to China.
16899,It was legitimately risky to be seeing people who were recently in China or anywhere overseas for that matter.
16900,"i find it funny how people are scared of side effects but older people are the first one to get it, like how they cant survive if an old person can"

16926,"And officially 1.6 Million people have already died from COVID, that will easily double by the time this is over and we have a couple years to examine all the data to calculate excess deaths."
16927,"Tens of millions more might face long term health complications and bankruptcy from medical bills (Americans at least)  


Its certainly not on the same scale, like I already said... but again whats the difference if your loved one was murdered or killed from incompetence??"
16928,"Dead is dead, you grieve them the same either way."
16929,45 MILLION Chinese died under Mao's incompetence... are their deaths any less tragic than Jews killed by Hitler??
16930,Did their loved ones not mourn them the same?
16931,Are Americans not mourning the loss of loved ones right now??
16932,"By your logic one would say ""the holocaust was nothing compared to the great leap forward!"
16933,"Its offensive to even compare them I mean just look at how many more Chinese died than Jews"""
16934,"Just went thru this on an instagram post where 38,000 were in the Pfizer trial that received the real vaccine."
16935,And only 4 maybe developed bells palsy from it.
16936,"In all likelihood, it wasn't the vaccine as they developed it at the same rate as the general population."
16937,Even for arguments sake let's say the vaccine did cause them to develop it.
16938,"With just some simple math, even as a young person, you're far more likely to get sick enough to need hospitalization or die from Covid than get the vaccine."
16939,Yet so many people read something on the internet and won't take the vaccine.
16940,I know.

16949,"I’m not aware of any vaccine manufacturers using a weakened, but live form of the Covid virus."
16950,Like you suggested these types of vaccines require extensive pre-clinical research and human testing because of the risks involved in exposing people to the virus you want to protect them from.
16951,"The Chinese have developed several vaccines that use completely dead Covid virus though and there are many other vaccines that use other approaches, such as viral proteins (like Norovax) or viral proteins coupled to weak common cold viruses (like J&amp;J and Oxford)."
16952,"The mRNA vaccines were especially fast because COVID-19 is caused by an mRNA virus, which meant scientists only had to take a piece of its sequence that codes for the spike protein and protect it with a lipid envelope to make these vaccines."
16953,All the other types of vaccines have longer pre-clinical development times than this.
16954,"This is the big thing, IMO."
16955,SF is more isolated and surrounded by counties that are also doing a good job.

16959,"But there’s no evidence currently that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune disease or make it worse, says Betty Diamond, an immunologist and rheumatologist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research of Northwell Health."

16979,"With ICUs in my area now full and people in my area going full derp, I'm not taking any chances."
16980,Very selfish people indeed
16981,"That is an irrelevant question since we failed so miserably at ppe production, there aren’t even close to enough n95 with valves  for everyone."
16982,"Just wear a surgical mask over the valve, block the valve with good tape or glue, or get one without a filter and don’t be an asshole to those around you who are unable to get such a mask for themselves."
16983,People in nursing homes are at more constant risk though due to shared residence and caretakers.

17025,"At the beginning, it probably means that they’re having to put multiple COVID patients in one room."
17026,"As the ICU gets more full, they have to start offloading the healthier patients to different beds within the hospital."
17027,"At this point, hospital staff have to begin triaging."
17028,"Their resources and staff are spread so thin that they have to decide who will respond the best to treatment, or who needs to be put on the last available ventilator."
17029,"As the ICU fills with COVID patients, any other patients are left to fight for a bed."
17030,"Usually, if beds were low, a hospital could try to transfer that patient to another hospital nearby."
17031,"But with all of the ICUs at capacity, it’s impossible to find a hospital to transfer a patient to, especially in an area as vast as Southern California."
17032,"Every hospital is overwhelmed, and it’s going to get much worse before it gets better."
17033,"With no beds available, any ambulances will struggle to find a place to bring their patient, especially if they’re sick with COVID - think 5 hours of driving around in an ambulance, trying to find anyone who can take in just one more sick person."
17034,"So yes, people should still go to the hospital if they need care."
17035,"But they need to prepare to wait for hours in waiting rooms and hallways, and only those with the most immediate life threats may be able to access care, if that."

17429,We wait around for everyone to get the vaccine?
17430,Keep following mandates for however long that takes?
17431,What if it takes another year?
17432,Or 2 years?
17433,"I'm sorry, but no."

17462,That’s stupid though.
17463,"Pfizer has promised certain amount of doses in December, January, February, and March."
17464,The goal should be to use all the December doses ASAP to get the most widespread protection and then use part of the January shipment for the 2nd dose and so on.
17465,"If the January dose shows up late (or never) and people miss the 2nd dose, we have much larger problems because that means manufacturing has fallen off the rails and the whole timeline is trash."
17466,Basically the 5th dentist.
17467,most of the police in my town don’t wear masks either even though we have a mandate
17468,"At some point next year, statistics will roll out about excess deaths in each country."
17469,US will have over 500k excess deaths for 2020.
17470,It's a certainty.
17471,For reference I agree with you.
17472,"Local land lords should be the only type that is legal, as in they live in *town* style local."
17473,A lot of the worst land lords are companies or ones who don't care because they are managing more successful properties states away.
17474,I'd also be down for more improper land lords having the book thrown at them but that'd require our justice system to be fast and efficient and it just isn't.
17475,I had a big fight with my girlfriend today about visiting my parents for Christmas.
17476,"I think it's safe, she doesn't."
17477,"I don't even care what the right or wrong answer is here, I'm just crushed."
17478,"I'm depressed, I miss seeing my friends, I miss people who aren't my girlfriend."
17479,I only leave our apartment to buy groceries and go for a single run a day and I couldn't do that today because it snowed.
17480,"I'm not even sure if I like my girlfriend anymore but I can't tell if it's an ""us"" thing or a ""no one should be within 10 ft of anyone non-stop for 9 months (we live in a small 1br)."
17481,I don't feel like I can talk about feeling depressed or my feelings with my girlfriend because she would just want me to get medicated like she did 6 months ago and that's not something I want.
17482,I think I want to start phone-call therapy but how can I talk about my relationship or feelings when my girlfriend can hear every word I say?
17483,God.
17484,I just feel so trapped.
17485,That's a very obtuse definition of loophole.
17486,Everyone over 80.
17487,He is over 80 but has money.
17488,OK?
17489,It would cost way more time and money to put means based testing onto a country wide vaccination.

17506,"Remember that the government actually pre-ordered a specific quantity ahead of time, so it's not rolling out of the pharma factory just for Americans."

15 minutes doesn't seem like a big deal, but you need to only open the vax you CAN definitely administer.. if you're the one supposed to get jabbed last.. meaning the vial is already X hours old.. 15 minute ""delay"" could make that dose expire."

17554,Why should I be censored and silenced from simply asking a question?
17555,Getting a reaction like yours just causes tension and discourages people to see things from your point of view.
17556,How am I supposed to be more open minded and take in new information and perspectives when people like you react and treat people like me like an idiot.
17557,How in anyway are you encouraging dialogue and education?

17569,I really don't understand this virus.
17570,When I saw the headline I just assumed that perhaps obesity or heart disease was higher amongst people with down syndrome or something.
17571,But the fact that their rate of death was higher even after correcting for those factors is scary.
17572,That outdoor decision likely saved lives.

17575,That makes sense to me.

UK has 1.95 mil cases and 66k deaths

If you understand anything about numbers you see what’s wrong here."

CA: 1.28%

17730,"There’s been a lot of talk over the last semester that next school year won’t be any better, that we’ll still have to social distance, wear masks, etc."
17731,"Of course, this was long before the vaccine."
17732,"Now that people in our city are getting vaccinated, we’re speculating if they’ll lift precautions before this school year is even out."
17733,Any other educators wondering about this?

17742,Nice.
17743,"Looks like the 400,000 by January was off."
17744,Not complete trash though.
17745,We're at 3000 a day.
17746,Hopefully it is declining.
17747,"314,000 deaths as of today."
17748,"At this rate if it doesn't decline, we'll see another 42,000, for a total of 356,000."
17749,Which is actually worse than I thought.
17750,!Remindme 2 weeks
17751,Not really.
17752,This model is severely lacking and only serves for very basic efficacy evaluation.
17753,Once approved for use it seems pointless.
17754,Lol.
17755,You can’t trust the numbers let alone the information from China.
17756,They set on Covid information for weeks.
17757,This od amazing.
17758,And I can easily buty certified FFP3 maska masę locally in Poland.
17759,first week of jabs?
17760,what is that
17761,But we don't know longevity.
17762,Might only give you protection for a few months.
17763,"That's only if the UK does all the vaccinating, we were kind of hoping the rest of the world would have a go too."
17764,[removed]
17765,"I don't think it's just the system though, a large portion of people actually seem to love the way things are."
17766,"When you look at the kinds of things people say they really seem to enjoy the idea of ""lesser"" people suffering, and American cultural ideals give a convenient way to morally justify this, like ""the poor made bad life choices and didn't work hard enough, they need to take some personal responsibility"", etc."
17767,"If everyone actually hated the system I don't think it would really last long, but I don't see anything changing soon because so many Americans would fight tooth and nail to make sure that the current order of things stays."
17768,so let me get this straight.
17769,she arrived in wuhan on 18th jan. a few days later she recommended a lockdown.
17770,on 23rd jan wuhan was subject to the first lockdown of a major metropolis in modern history.
17771,"that's decisiveness, speed and efficacy

and yet we're still hearing how china let it spread or bungled the outbreak."
17772,i really hate to imagine how all this would have been handled if it had been a chicago instead of wuhan
17773,You can't just look at the case count.
17774,"Cases per population tells the story better, and California is 40th in this on worldometer (will probably go up)."
17775,Shows you how badly a lot of states have been handling this.
17776,California has over 10% of the US population so it'll have a lot of cases
17777,and a word that sounds similar but begins with the letter 'w'.
17778,I missed work and drove 360 miles for each of my shots.
17779,Probably not worth the 125 dollars per visit.
17780,We dare not disagree with the sub’s Gilded God.
17781,Doesn't the cold freeze covid away?
17782,Or was it the summer heat burn it away?
17783,Or spring flowers charm it away?
17784,I keep forgetting.
17785,Still rounding that corner.
17786,"&gt; If you don't steal things, sell drugs, etc., you won't end up in prison."
17787,Thats a very naive opinion.
17788,"lets say, for the sake of argument, that all ""crime"" stopped tomorrow."
17789,This massive industry isn't going to roll over.
17790,"It's going to invent some new crimes, and get the government to sign off."
17791,"Same way they've consistently pushed for harsher sentences, more prisons, minimum incarceration rates, funded ""tough on crime"" politicians etc"
17792,Have you read what the side-effects are of catching SARS-CoV-2?
17793,They're kind of a big deal too.
17794,Definitely should be fired if they took the over.
17795,Hmmm.
17796,"So I guess the whole world is ruled by a bunch of truly evil, greedy, disgusting cry babies."
17797,Because Europe has the same covid death numbers as the USA and we had nations doing everything from total lockdown to no lockdown at all.
17798,"But I guess America is so exceptional, you got your own rules."
17799,You can just point the finger somewhere and know where all the blame is to be put.
17800,At least as long as you're not pointing at yourself.
17801,Question: Did you think the flu was worse in February?
17802,Were you against locking down international travel?
17803,"That's true of the flu as well, though - the vast majority of pediatric flu cases do not need hospitalization."
17804,"For the 18-19 flu season, the CDC estimates 11 million symptomatic pediatric cases, 5.5 million medical visits, and 46k hospitalizations."
17805,That's less than 1% of the medical visits requiring hospitalization.
17806,And the overall hospitalization prevalence for &lt;18 was 63 per 100k.
17807,"[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html)

It's tough to find actual COVID case counts by age, but we're approaching hospitalization population prevalance for &lt;18 of 20 per 100k."
17808,"How comparable that is will depend on how many pediatric COVID cases we've had so far, but it's unlikely to be more than 11 million."
17809,"[https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19\_3.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html)

So I'd say it \*might\* cause slightly fewer pediatric hospitalizations per infection, but it certainly has the potential to cause more pediatric hospitalizations than the 18-19 flu season if the outbreak was totally uncontrolled."
17810,Same for pediatric deaths.
17811,"It's certainly not cut-and-dry and Politico's ""analysis"" was bunk, though!"
17812,"indeed i have, that's how I know"
17813,Says late fall for...what?
17814,Is this a surprise
17815,For the Moderna vaccine right?
17816,I don't think Pfizer tracked theirs.
17817,"we should be able to find out now, but whatever."
17818,these corps are just jerking people around at this point.
17819,This!
17820,"People should have known what is aerosol transmission, how it is likely to contract the virus and how much it is deadly by now but it seems like nobody internalizes the information or they're so sure of having a great immunity, I find it hard to understand this careless attitude."
17821,I just guess most people who think it's fine are the ones not going out for the work that much.
17822,"When you don't need to take the risk and can afford to stay at home, it must be easy to downplay it."
17823,"The Atlantic is included in the rotation for sure, they have great coverage but I certainly don't think any news publication is 100% exempt from horseshit articles and there were a handful from the Atlantic that were irresponsibly doom and gloom."
17824,If I cared enough I'd go look em up but if you're also reading the Atlantic I'm sure you're aware of them
17825,I mean people don’t die in war when everyone’s asleep while this virus is killing 24/7
17826,Thank you.
17827,Proved my point.
17828,Good day
17829,And what you do is exponentially more important than Amazon.
17830,"I remember the dark days of the sub when a lot of people thought there was not going to be a vaccine for covid, or the pandemic would gone on for years and there was nothing we could do about it."
17831,This was back in April to may time.
17832,We have come a long way from then.
17833,Also American.
17834,You have to remember the history this generation is growing up with.
17835,"We had Agent Orange, MK Ultra, Waco, and the Rodney King riots to grow up with."
17836,Everyone is well aware that the government does not care about your life.
17837,"To many, it only becomes dystopian once it’s “intrusive” and from a media standpoint almost requires the inclusion of technology."
17838,"Microchip tracking, gov’t social rankings, Robot teachers, etc."
17839,It really all boils down to conditioning when you think of it.
17840,Is this how it ends?
17841,Is this how we enter another Great Depression?
17842,Is America doomed because our general populace is too poor to be protected while simultaneously being too stupid to follow basic precautions?
17843,Find out next time on dragon ball z
17844,"At 1 in 50,000 risk of anaphylaxis that is still less than the 1 in 17,000 risk of MIS-C in children."
17845,"Virus is still way worse than the vaccine, even in that lowest-risk population."
17846,And that is entirely ignoring the point that you can minimize that by identifying the at-risk population.
17847,It might pick up more now that the Stay at Home order is active.
17848,Good luck!
17849,"Yes, looks like a record number of deaths today in the US, probably around 3300 or 3400---Today's totals in Europe(and US equivalent numbers):--- Bulgaria 191(equal to 9,130 US deaths)---Croatia 92(7,452)---Poland 605(5,263)---Hungary 144(4,939)---Switzerland 113(4294)---Italy 680(3,740)---Belgium 124(3472)"
17850,Fire the lot of them.
17851,"right and with us having the highest percentage of incarcerated people in the world, im not sure how you can be comfortable sentencing one in every 165 of them to death."
17852,Also keep in mind that healthcare in prison is pretty bad.
17853,The fatality rate in US prisons is closer to 2.1%.
17854,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249
17855,"The plans are to vaccinate everyone over 16, they definitely will ""bother"" but likely will be spring before that age group starts."
17856,"But agree with you 100% on that last point, nothing is really going to change for quite some time."
17857,So many downvoted comments on this lmao
17858,"I get your sentiment, but we’re dealing with life and death."
17859,"If Facebook doing this means we’re ultimately sparing a few COVID related deaths, then I’m all for it."
17860,Pandemic is way too out of hand right now to worry about how ethical this is when the health and well-being of people are at stake.
17861,thats a colossal fuck up I'm willing to accept.
17862,What so FUCKING HARD about putting on a mask?
17863,It's THE LEASE FUCKING THING YOU CAN DO.
17864,"They're not ""IT people"" - they're maintenance personnel to keep the physical side of things running."
17865,"All the ""IT people"" sit in the comfort of their home for 9 months now."
17866,And yes - you need a lot of people onsite as AWS powers up a huge chunk of the global internet.
17867,I'm so sorry.
17868,I understand how you feel.
17869,My grandma passed in the summer of the same causes--her home health care provider got her positive COVID result the day of the funeral.
17870,"The wait in between is hard, took them several weeks before we could lay her to rest."
17871,[deleted]
17872,The police did something awful?
17873,Color me surprised.
17874,&gt;Cool.
17875,Still never taking a vaccine for this.
17876,&gt;My odds of dying from this are lower than driving to work every single morning so I'm just gonna roll the dice without a vaccine.

17881,My aunts mother died the other day.
17882,She had Covid months ago and recovered fine.
17883,She was however a diabetic for her whole life and in the last 2 years had both of her legs from the shin down amputated.
17884,They labeled her death as covid.
17885,She died from diabetes.
17886,9/10 Amazon can deliver a package to your DOORSTEP in under two days.
17887,Add to that- the US Military isn't great because it's a fighting force.
17888,It's great because it is the most powerful logistics organization in the world.
17889,Getting and distributing the vaccine to hospitals and clinics isn't the hard part- it's getting people to actually show up.
17890,That's not what's happening.
17891,Stop spreading vaccine misinformation!
17892,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/world/the-us-will-initially-hold-back-half-the-first-vaccine-supply.html
17893,Those should probably be replaced too.
17894,Just to be sure.
17895,Of course they do.
17896,That doesn’t mean we should downvote news we don’t like.
17897,Why do you think so?
17898,"If a disease isn’t spread by surfaces, hand washing probably doesn’t do anything."
17899,"Doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea, there are still plenty of diseases that do spread by dirty hands, but if your goal is to reduce the spread of HIV or Malaria, hand washing isn’t relevant."

17901,This is not a random zombie virus that gets worse.
17902,Mutation tends to make them less lethal.
17903,"There are historians who believe some past epidemics, like the “Russian Flu” outbreak, was actually a new Coronavirus that ran through the population then settled in as another cold that goes around and didn’t kill people."
17904,So there’s that.
17905,That’s in one day?
17906,Will they hit the testing limit?
17907,Thanks.
17908,And hopefully is getting it first will show people it’s safe and effective.
17909,Okay?
17910,Your point is...?
17911,It's split in half because the other half is the second dose.
17912,This was announced weeks ago.
17913,I got mine too!
17914,Hell yeah
17915,Oh the sticker?
17916,"I was thinking of the vaccination card they gave us, not the sticker."
17917,"On the bright side, it'll be very easy for you to walk away guiltlessly when you get a better offer, since you now know that your boss doesn't care if you die."
17918,"While Newsom did make an obvious mistake, its not quite the same as this shit:

https://twitter.com/inminivanhell/status/1338218098919239680?s=20"
17919,You can also count on one hand the number of anaphylaxis cases from the vaccine.
17920,And treating anaphylaxis is actually super easy.
17921,Benefits still outweigh the risks
17922,"not like, this month.."
17923,and everyone on earth who wasn’t a complete idiot said “no shit”
17924,Was that before or after the surgeon general said masks don’t work?
17925,Alright but what does that have to do with what I said?
17926,"But for those who do choose to be vaccinated, their lives should now be deemed safe from Covid and that should help a lot."
17927,Managers are actually pretty replaceable
17928,You didn't read it that way because the media wants you to get mad.
17929,[except he did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3010&amp;v=6dVcuxU15fc&amp;feature=youtu.be)

17933,Suddenly my back hurts and I need to lay down.
17934,Yes it's antivax nonsense.
17935,That's why I removed their higher comment.
17936,They get these ideas from somewhere but they almost never have any validity.
17937,[Yes he does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3010&amp;v=6dVcuxU15fc&amp;feature=youtu.be)
17938,why do i have a feeling that the usa will do a denmark
17939,I think he’s padding the timeline because there appears to be resistance by a significant part of the population.
17940,"If everyone (70%) was willing to get it as soon as it’s available, that normalcy could be established much earlier."
17941,Early summer is completely realistic.
17942,That being said - I think those who do get the vaccine will be able to move about society safely and that’s the important thing.
17943,Those who do not will continue to gamble with their lives.
17944,Im getting mine on the 22nd!!
17945,So excited.
17946,Unfortunately half my department believes the vaccine is putting a tracking device in them and refuse to get it.
17947,"Yes, medical professionals believe this shit."
17948,God i cant wait for this to end.
17949,My colleague's family in TN had a wake for his great grandmother last month -- who died of covid -- and 70% of the people were not wearing masks.
17950,Some travelled from Florida to attend.
17951,Five got sick so far.
17952,Two in the hospital.
17953,Definitely a smart call.
17954,"But also, a pharmacist definitely knows how to give IM epinephrine and steroids."
17955,"Anaphylaxis is weird because it’s lifesaving, but we also treat 8 year olds how to treat it with near 100% success."
17956,Nope but there have been a lot of articles linking some severe side effects with the vaccine in small trials.
17957,We’ll see just like you aren’t a professional and you don’t know everything .
17958,We’ll come back to this discussion in a few weeks.
17959,It's about damn time..
17960,/r/SelfAwarewolves
17961,Most people?
17962,Which country are you living in?
17963,And do you not see the “free flu shots” signs everywhere?
17964,"If they can make flu shots free, they can make covid shots free."
17965,I don’t think you know what trolling is lol
17966,I am absolutely with you and I do know several friends who are careful as well.
17967,"But definitely, there are friends who think we are living in fear by wearing a mask and avoiding parties."
17968,We will make it through!
17969,❤️
17970,"Yes, agree, overall it is great, and I am feeling very encouraged."
17971,I just think people need to realize it may not stop the spread.
17972,"But it will stop people from getting sick, so there will be fewer deaths and the hospitals will get some relief."
17973,It has been grueling for the HCWs.
17974,"Also, this same poll was given a few months ago and more than 50% said they want it cancelled."
17975,So it actually has significantly decreased.
17976,Do you really think climate change won’t destroy the planet?
17977,"as i said ""the chinese govt tried to minimize at the outset (as did trump) but once they realized covid was bad news they cracked down HARD."""
17978,"&gt;China employed draconian lockdowns and extensive surveillance to shake off the effects of the pandemic earlier this year, allowing its factories to reopen at a large scale more quickly than businesses in America, where the disease is still running rampant."
17979,"With many American companies, especially those based on services, crippled by coronavirus, consumers are pumping their money into online shopping for manufactured goods instead."
17980,~ https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/business/economy/us-china-trade-covid.html
17981,"You didn't say anything credible, which is why everyone so easily identified you as a troll."
17982,"The fact you're **STILL** dishonestly trying to play the victim is just more proof, so thank you for helping discredit yourself by failing so hard at trolling LMFAO

Nobody who wants to be taken seriously resorts to your bad faith tactics."
17983,You're the only one digging your own grave.
17984,Ack be careful!
17985,You're not allowed to do that.
17986,And Newsom isn't doing anything about it.
17987,shut down ALL retail.
17988,That's when people will know that it's serious...
17989,"UK people, how long do we think it’ll take before we start to see numbers going down because the virus will have less people to infect?"
17990,"If you had anaphylaxis from a flu shot once you have an history of allergies, nope?"
17991,"Anyway,  in the UK there was an update already one week ago said: [Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine."

17993,You are making a lot of assumptions with that simple statement.
17994,The first one bring that any lab with any equipment can make a specific vaccine.
17995,"Seeing as how there are different storage requirements for every brand, there is probably a specific manufacturing process as well."
17996,Have you considered that production isn’t the only bottle neck in the system?
17997,At this point they are just desperately trying to get people to keep wearing masks and distancing for the winter surge.
17998,[removed]
17999,[removed]
18000,"The media loves pointing out the very rare instances of allergic reactions to the Pfizer shot, but they never point out that hundreds of thousands of people have taken the shot with no issue."
18001,"Pisses me off so much, it’s just shit-stirring on their part."
18002,And then the very next day they’ll publish some article saying “what’s causing anti-vaccine hysteria?”.
18003,"It’s not as many as you think, they’re just really annoyingly loud about being anti vax."
18004,How is the US equipped to do this?
18005,And there's a reason they're handling this one better than you too for the most part.
18006,"I’m a biologist and... no, probably not."
18007,"For good measure they should thaw one and check the integrity of the lipid nanoparticles, but if those are intact as expected, they should be used."
18008,I don't think Amazon is asking for their tech staff to get the vaccine first.
18009,Its the people who work in the warehouses fulfilling orders and their delivery people
18010,"Nope, that's an additional CR."
18011,"If he orders now, we can bring it up in the next planning meeting in March; but no chance of release pre 2022"
18012,I'm in Chicago.
18013,We're coming down off a bad peak but deaths haven't started to go down yet.
18014,Stay safe.
18015,Vaccine is on the way.
18016,Canada might have been able to do as well as NZ if we had closed our borders earlier.
18017,"Early on we were quite reluctant to do something that drastic, and ended up importing cases from the US and Europe for a good half of March; by the time we did it was there was already community spread going on across the country."
18018,At that point it would probably have taken lockdowns like the one in Melbourne all over the country to get to eradication; we could possibly have been as good as Australia at least but it would've been hard to convince everyone to buy into something like that nationwide.

18050,I’ll still wear a mask if that’s still in effect - more as a show of etiquette.

&gt;It's possible that Pfizer's vaccine could eventually be shown to be stable in somewhat warmer conditions — or for longer times out of the freezer."
18879,"To figure out a vaccine's temperature requirements, drugmakers do extensive, time-consuming thermostability studies."

18882,"You might also put the vaccine at fluctuating temperatures ""to sort of mimic what would happen if [a vaccine shipment] got left on a loading dock and something went wrong,"" Liu says."
18883,Then drugmakers have to analyze the vaccine samples that have been put through all that and do tests (usually in mice) to see if the vaccine still works the way it's supposed to.
18884,All of this is measured in real time.

18959,So I think it's time to discuss why there hasn't really been a thanksgiving increase in the US.
18960,"By now it should have shown up in terms of case increases, but cases have flattened over the last week or so."
18961,So there are a few possibilities here: Fewer people did thanksgiving than reported.
18962,People took extra precautions for thanksgiving by quarantining themselves beforehand and/or testing which cancelled out the impact of the social gathering.
18963,Or maybe people that risked it are also the type that won't get tested and so they won't show up.
18964,"If it's the last one, then deaths will spike above trend in about 3 weeks."
18965,The last option is that reporting and cases are still so delayed that we're still on the backend of thanksgiving catch up.
18966,Not looking down on anyone the way you appear to look down on the us.

19193,They are doing does test right now.

19202,"obvs, the US Constitution provides the basis for our whole society and legal system."
19203,In 1976 the US Supreme Court said in Estelle v. Gamble that a prison staff's “deliberate indifference” to the “serious medical needs” of prisoners is “cruel and unusual punishment” forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.
19204,"I’m personally going to take the first vaccine that is available to me, but there are plenty of other candidates that will be approved soon if you don’t like the side effects of this one."
19205,Does anyone understand the statistics and epidemiology / virology behind how this will work if children under 18 are unable to be vaccinated?
19206,"This is something I hadn’t expected to be an issue, and one that I haven’t seen addressed yet."
19207,"Not being condescending or sarcastic , but can you also explain the people with $48k hospital bills for having COVID ?"
19208,"You do realize that these COVID vaccines were ready back in July, right?"
19209,Why didn’t we just start giving the vaccine to nurses back in July?
19210,"Hmmm, I wonder... oh wait... it still needed to be tested to see if it was safe and effective"
19211,"Exactly for just because one is in prison for committing a crime, that does not make them any less human."
19212,Does not matter what they have done.
19213,They are still people and should get the vaccine like everyone else.
19214,"Unlike the rest of developed world, USA is very backwards and mideval when it comes to the criminal justice system."
19215,Eventually someone is going to die of something right after getting the vaccine and it’s going to have absolutely nothing to do with the vaccination.
19216,It’s amazing how they can downplay a virus that’s killed 300k+ Americans and be terrified of vaccines.
19217,How do they even drive cars or take showers without being in mortal fear of dying?
19218,There's talks about a trans Tasman travel bubble between Aus and NZ.
19219,We've both eliminated it apart from a few cases here and there.
19220,We're waiting in Aus because we have the ability to and to see what the reaction to the vaccine is.
19221,We've also produced millions of doses here and it's probably cheaper to use that first.
19222,Can't remember but I think it's the Oxford vaccine

19227,"My state has had a very well adhered to mask mandate since June, 54 deaths yesterday in a 4m population."
19228,That is up from 1-2 deaths a day before the mask mandate.
19229,"I’m not saying masks caused this increase or even that they are useless, but clearly they are nothing like a 69% effective reduction."
19230,"If they were, my state would be at 0 cases for months."
19231,They expect to vaccinate 1.4 million people in the US this week.
19232,"The UK has already given over 130k, plus thousands were included in the trials."
19233,Unless you are already signed up to get the vaccine in the next 2 weeks there will be well over a few million people ahead of you.
19234,"But please, take a back seat, wait for the first billion or two if you are really nervous, there are plenty of us that are literally dying to get it asap."
19235,"&gt;Certain vaccine providers may charge an administration fee for giving the shot, but individuals can have that fee reimbursed."
19236,"&gt;“Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund,” the CDC states."
19237,"Ooops, can't pay outright..."
19238,Guess you'll have to suffer or get insurance.
19239,Sources on any of that?
19240,But why not also try masks as well as other effective measures?

19243,I'm not American.

19249,/s /s /s
19250,Weird because not long ago experts were saying that asymptomatic people could have higher viral loads.
19251,What really needs to happen is that nurses aids need to receive a living wage.
19252,If we bolstered the wage of CNA more people will be drawn to that profession and provide enormous relief for nursing.
19253,Umm so I never said they shouldn’t be able to defend themselves either.
19254,They just need to focus more on de escalation and actually require a bachelor’s degree to join the force.
19255,Maybe even have a license that can be suspended or something like that.
19256,We shouldn’t be shooting ppl just cause they ran from the cops or couldn’t follow the cops raging demands exactly the way they demanded.

19273,It's like advocating for prison reform.
19274,"Everyone recognized the system needs to change, but at the same time, it's very hard to advocate to spend government money on convicted criminals"
19275,It isn’t 69%.
19276,The “control” of places without a mask mandate had a 40% drop.
19277,"Add in all the other things that a place that is willing to make masks mandatory would do vs a place that isn’t willing, and you’ve got no case."
19278,"Correlation doesn’t disprove causation, masks make sense to have some positive effect, but these kinds of studies are totally useless"
19279,Doesn't it take like 30 days to actually get the immunity and a 2nd shot?
19280,I just thought they were more educated about masks than Americans.
19281,We have little experience with masks before now.
19282,yeah well i gave up already.
19283,That doesn’t seem to be true.

19403,"But the difference is that that's likely to be only a small percentage of covid deaths, while the mistaken cases will be *most or all* of the deaths blamed on the vaccine"
19404,"well, thats because the US government is required by the US constitution to provide medical care to every person we lock up in cages but it’s not obligated to provide it to every citizen."
19405,are you suggesting that the protections of the US constituion dont apply in this situation because it’s an emergency?
19406,i would suggest that this is EXACTLY the time when the basic protections of the constitution must not be abrogated.

19489,That's evidently not true.

Just look at how difficult it was to ramp up something as mundane as PPE, despite there being no shortage of cash thrown at the problem."
19492,"Why do you think they're shivering in fear, rather than waiting to get a vaccine until it has already done the greatest good in terms of health and economic impact?"
19493,"NZ won't be anywhere near herd immunity next ""summer"" (which will be their winter) because they won't have had either Covid or the vaccine."
19494,"Once the vaccine rolls out, which should be quicker because logistics, rather than supply will be the limiting factor, they'll be ready to open for their own summer."
19495,"Meanwhile, until then, life will go on as normal."
19496,It was worse than a test shortage as scientists had to invent and validate the test first.

19507,Canadian health care is run by the provinces and each province has its own system.
19508,"I can only speak to BC, but if you leave the province for long enough to lose coverage, then you need to reapply for MSP (the provincial healthcare plan) when you return and purchase private insurance for the three month waiting period that applies to all new residents of BC."

19511,"You don't understand, I just have to lay my towel next to yours."
19512,It doesn't always work that way.
19513,Asymptomatic infected people can spread the virus quite effectively.
19514,It's fully within the realm of possibilities that the vaccine helps the body to clear the infection before you develop symptoms but that while you are clearing the virus you are still shedding.
19515,The virus needs to be active in your body before your (vaccine-trained) immune system reacts.

19529,"I think that increase from Q1 to Q2 is not unreasonable, considering the scale of people working on it and the urgency of the matter."
19530,That sums it up nicely.

19556,Don't be ridiculous.
19557,An option is a contractual agreement where a certain price will be paid for certain doses delivered.
19558,"So this argument that without those options, nothing would get produced, is complete nonsense."
19559,"It just means rich countries are paying a premium to be the first in line, never mind their actual needs."

Again, that's a ridiculous argument."
19561,"Big pharma corps are producing as fast as they can, they know it will be sold eventually."
19562,"They are not short of cash, they could produce billions of doses and hand them out for free if they felt like it."
19563,"What's happening right now is rich countries taking their cut first, and everyone else has to wait."
19564,"But do go on, produce a source that supports your point over mine."
19565,Because it likely would get less views and our news is reactionary to say the least.
19566,"For decades it's been pretty standard practice to go for the most views, in a lot of ways that meant focusing on set events, like a missing *white* girl over a missing Hispanic girl, things like that."
19567,"They need a plot line and story for people to follow that people would be sympathetic too, with COVID it's either hard to sympathize (Party frat guy gets it and it's his fault) or it will run counter to a different narrative they are running."

19602,"It's also that half a year of restrictions is really hard on some people and they just can't bother, and for others the fact the vaccine is coming makes them just disregard the rules."
19603,"I'd also like to say,  anecdotally, the only people I know who aren't following the restrictions never did or did so inconsistently."

19639,And there have been some allergic reactions...a couple requiring epinephrine shots...but so far that seems to be the extent of major side effects.
19640,There was actually a conspiracy theory going around the vaccines can turn you black.
19641,I'm not sure what happens to people who are already black like me but I'll let you guys know once I get vaccinated.
19642,I wouldn't mind being a little darker...lol

19716,I get the pain of having to close your dine in while not getting support from the feds but its still wrong.
19717,"I own a couple Cafes myself and we never re-opened our indoor dining, even when we were allowed to because I didn't want to expose my employees, if even one of them got sick and had to quarantine for two weeks we'd be hurting bad, if two or more got sick we'd have to shut down as we're already running a skeleton crew."
19718,"Plus I knew when they re-opened dine in it was only a matter of time before they shut it down again, so instead of playing red light green light we just focused on takeout and deliveries."
19719,It will probably be late spring-early summer when things go back to normal

19722,"Thankfully, this is not an episode of Hoarders."
19723,"I am trained for early in my job about the possible obstacles we can face in a trial (I swear we used a different term than the one you referenced, but that was years ago)."
19724,The goal is to prevent anything that would compromise subject safety and data integrity.
19725,And subject safety will always override data integrity.
19726,"For example, if a subject is taking a medication that has bad interactions while the subject is under sedation, and the subject randomly gets into a car accident and needs to have emergency surgery, we will go through the unblinding process to determine if they were on the drug or placebo."
19727,"The unblinding process compromises the entire site in terms of data integrity, bc the site, which has maintained a blind, now knows what that subject was on and the different comments he makes about whatever he is taking."
19728,It’s also why we try to have the placebo be as identical as possible to the real drug in terms of color shape smell etc.
19729,"so we will always choose to save the subject by unblinding them and determining if they are at risk for their surgery, or if they are fine because they are on placebo, all while possibly compromising an entire site’s data."
19730,Clinical trials go off the idea of: is doing “abc” worth the potentials of “XYZ”.
19731,"For instance, there are reports of subjects experiencing Bell’s palsy in the study, so all adverse events that are deemed related to the drug have to be reviewed by ethics boards and determine if it is all worth it."
19732,"Because BP is temporary, involved less than 1% of subjects, and those who experienced it all have a history of it (ie they can warn their doctor ahead of time, they are aware of the expected side effects etc), it is deemed “worth it”."
19733,Intentionally exposing subjects to a deadly virus has not been deemed as worth it.
19734,The difference in data we would get would not be significant enough to justify exposure.
19735,It is also something that should never be done with a placebo arm.
19736,"That means that we would be exposing 15,000 people that we know don’t have the antibodies and didn’t receive the vaccine to a fatal and contagious virus."
19737,There would statistically be 450 deaths from a clinical trial.
19738,That means a company knowing it is about to kill hundreds of people to obtain data.
19739,It is against all ethical bodies involved in research and is exactly what the Germans did to those in concentration camps.
19740,They had scientists run tests that they knew would result in death or permanent disease.
19741,"This is part of what inspired the creation of the NIH GCP, which protects the rights of the subjects over anything else."
19742,"I feel like I went all over the place with this so I hope it made sense 

TLDR: subject safety is the top priority of clinical trials, and every little thing done in a trial, every assessment, every test, has to support the concept that performing that action creates a greater good than the possible adverse reactions create a bad."
19743,"So, is it worth it."
19744,Intentionally exposing people who didn’t receive a vaccine (got placebo) and don’t have antibodies to a deadly and contagious virus does not make it worth getting the data we can obtain from intentional exposure.
19745,Having windows at work that f-ing open would be nice.
19746,Reminding people that fresh air is healthier than indoor air is a worthwhile change.

19802,"&gt;Already struggling with Covid-19, hospitals and nursing homes prepare for a winter storm."
19803,"&gt;Hospitals across the Northeast, already strained by an increase in Covid-19 patients and the first week of vaccine distribution, were preparing Wednesday for a winter storm with the potential to bring accident victims to their doors."
19804,"&gt;”For us, it’s part of our normal snow emergency preparations,” said Michael Maron, the president and chief executive of Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, N.J.

&gt;Mr. Maron noted that his hospital had multiple sources of backup power,  and he was confident there was enough capacity in the I.C.U."
19805,"&gt;Crews were pre-treating roads to enable smooth hospital access, and many elective surgeries were delayed until Friday to encourage people to stay home, he said."
19806,"&gt;The hospital was scheduled to receive its first Covid-19 vaccines later on Wednesday or Thursday morning, Mr. Maron said, and he was optimistic that the shipments would arrive on time, despite the storm."
19807,"&gt;At St. Luke’s University Health Network, which operates 12 hospitals in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, there was a possibility that the first vaccine delivery — scheduled for Thursday — would be delayed by the storm, said Samuel Kennedy, a hospital spokesman."
19808,"&gt;Nursing homes from Philadelphia to Albany said they, too, were prepared for the storm, calling it a routine disruption."
19809,"At the Teresian House for the Elderly in Albany, the home’s 225 residents could expect six to 10 inches of snow, which a spokesman, Paul Larrabee, called a “moderate upstate winter storm.”

&gt;The home has suffered from coronavirus outbreaks since the spring, he added, which has heightened the staff’s focus on residents’ safety."
19810,"“In light of what we’ve gone through in the last 10 months, our emergency and crisis preparedness is probably as well calibrated as any time in our history,” Mr. Larrabee said."
19811,"&gt;In Philadelphia, staff at the 54-bed Pennypack Nursing and Rehabilitation Center are prepared with a backup generator."
19812,"“We test it weekly,” said its administrator, Michael Greenwald."
19813,"“We are making sure all our staff has a way to get to work,” he said."
19814,"“We’re just ready to go.”

19865,How’s that different from getting paid for taking a vaccine as part of your job and a person in society?
19866,Can you imagine a pandemic that never ends?
19867,Because that’s what your position is relative to mine.
19868,And my position is hardly extreme.
19869,Extreme is:  s round up all inhabitants for inoculation by order of the federal government under penalty of criminal violation.

19873,You can run your own business coding at home and uploading your work to a server and connecting professionally through email and zoom.
19874,Don’t get the vaccine.
19875,No one really cares.
19876,But it is a duty of care for a company or business that employs people under one facility to ensure safety and it is absolutely within their rights and within a state or country’s rights to enact health and safety regulations.

19882,I read about the person in the US that Motor mentioned but I guess I assumed they were allergic to something in the vaccine.
19883,I didn’t realize anaphylaxis in general could be a risk factor.
19884,Thank you for the info!
19885,If you understand what vaccine does you'll understand why.
19886,The vaccine has high efficacy to prevent disease.
19887,"It one is not 100% efficacy, and two does not necessarily prevent infection(the data is 50/50 right now)."
19888,"Because the disease primarily spreads from symptomatic people, the vaccine will reduce symptomatic people dramatically."
19889,Vaccinated people with symptoms from other things like allergies or a cold will still be able to spread if they're infected.
19890,And that 1 in 20 people who the vaccine does nothing for will still be vulnerable.
19891,The reason we are vaccinating isn't just to make you immune to the disease.
19892,It's to eradicate the virus and reduce outbreaks of severe symptoms as low as possible.
19893,Why is this not being reported by any major news outlets?
19894,So did I.
19895,Must be the shape of the word.
19896,Honestly I think it's a pride thing on the right.

19919,"You're free to stand by your source and your statement -- given the data we have at the moment, it's not misinformation, and we aren't removing such comments for exactly that reason."
19920,But it's also not likely to be fully accurate.

19933,"They have a base, they cater to that base, and that base uses social media and is knee deep in conspiracies."

20000,Whoever is giving the shots should be expelling any large bubbles back into the vial (holding the vial upside down while pressing on the plunger).
20001,This would minimize or eliminate losses.

20005,"I know that's important, but I'm really hoping to do something that feels more impactful."

20096,"I think doctors and nurses should be 1st since they have the most exposure and if we have a shortage of them, that leads to less capacity to treat the infected."
20097,I’d also argue that anyone working on vaccine research and manufacturing for similar reasons (unless they have jobs that can be done from home and can keep a low risk of infection)
20098,I think a lot of it is psychological and it depends on confidence.

20140,"The county has now reported 175 coronavirus deaths in the first 16 days of December, more than any other entire month except August, when 307 deaths were recorded, and September’s 239 fatalities."""

20142,I mean i know 100% that somebody will die after the vaccine...
20143,It just won't be due to the vaccine.
20144,"No, but hopefully they’re not bagging the ones that survive"
20145,Yes but they don’t want unvaccinated people flying in
20146,It will be fairly normal if they prioritize educators like they should in the vaccine line.
20147,You can probably take the case graph and map it too earlier in the year since deaths got back to the same level.

20174,I think thats a mostly made up and relatively unfounded number at this point.
20175,The virus is less than a year old -unlikely they have identified the exact length it lasts.
20176,"Oddly enough, the antivax movement started as a liberal thing (with the hippies rejecting them)."
20177,Only somewhat recently has it been adopted heavily by conservatives.
20178,This makes sense because conservatives have been propagating anti-science rhetoric for some time now.
20179,It was inevitable that the antivaxxers would now come from and align with the science-denying party.
20180,"Yes, if we are taking about vaccinating the vulnerable"
20181,"And a huge fraction of them have ""catastrophic insurance""."
20182,"If you get in a wreck and accrue say, $220,000 in medical bills, then you need to cover your $10,000 deductible."
20183,"It's basically, ""If I get in a wreck I will owe $10k but at least I won't go bankrupt"" insurance."
20184,This leaves little to no room for regular checkups or preventative medicine as they'd pay out of pocket due to their deductible being so high.
20185,Even better!
20186,Would undocumented Canadians get public health insurance?
20187,"Oh they’re gonna roar alright, just not the way everyone is expecting"

20346,She’s due tomorrow!
20347,"And many of those cases are due to having a super weak immune system that can't fight it off even if it recognizes the infection, for example, people being actively treated for cancer."
20348,My niece got the rona about six months ago.

20354,Not even close my friend.
20355,It is.
20356,They certainly should be near the front of the line.
20357,Broski someone else said the vaccine was rushed in this thread.
20358,Please don’t pick and choose
20359,I agree.
20360,"I told her as much, and my wife didn't want to go but had trouble figuring out how to say it nicely.."

20381,They had an American moment.
20382,What do you normally do subsequent to the initial jab?
20383,What's the protocol for things that need to be kept at low temperatures - genuinely curious as I know cold supply chain was a serious challenge for this vax in particular

20396,"Not so for KN, I'm not sure why there isn't a tight fitting KN mask, but I thought that was the key difference from my personal experience."
20397,"Maybe that bad cost too much but honestly if I'm paying like 1$ for a mask, I'm cool paying 2$ for that same mask with a tight fitting band."

20408,It’s not common but here’s something wacky: I had it twice (once each side) and so did my mom.
20409,Weird.
20410,Extra History did a video special on the history behind quantum physics.
20411,I think seeing how physicists struggled with reconciling an inherent unpredictability and uncertainty that was fundamental to everything else shows how we as humans hate that.
20412,We want certainty.
20413,We are animals that evolved enough to ask questions we cannot answer and it sticks with us.
20414,Religions sprang up to explain why things worked because we needed an explanation.
20415,People demanding an answer on a set date just feels part of that human experience.
20416,People just need to learn to live with that uncertainty.
20417,Now I want this on a t-shirt
20418,I work at a grocery store if the vaccine was offered to me today I'd 100% get it
20419,"Do tell, please!"
20420,Fauci can eat my ass.
20421,This dudes opinions hold absolutely zero weight any longer.
20422,I am a massive fan of Poh's Law and often craft my replies so that is actively applies
20423,"Ye but we should be good w other vaccines, according to the warp speed head if J&amp;J and Oxford work out we’d have enough doses to be normal by May"
20424,I don’t think it will work like that.
20425,People who don’t take the vaccine will spread the virus among themselves until the virus mutates and the vaccine won’t be effective anymore.
20426,That’s something to be worried about.
20427,I'll get batch number four.

20432,Every man for himself.
20433,Drugs development are like Space travel... the concept of countries is not as tight as you might believe.
20434,Drugs are developed in labs across the world then manufactured in plants globally.
20435,The only local things that matter is regulatory approval and distribution; something that Germany has not done yet

20450,"California had 53k cases today with no signs of slowing down, per capita deaths will greatly increase over the coming weeks."
20451,Part of the problem is the media takes any off hand remark and turns it into a “headline” and then redditors only read the headline.
20452,“Omg Fauci is saying winter now?
20453,It was spring before!”  No that’s just a clickbait headline.
20454,There’s an app for that..

20456,"From a non-American perspective, y’all have been pretending like it’s back to normal since about April"
20457,English is tough because there's lots of words like that with different meanings but keep practicing and you'll get there.
20458,Why would I get the vaccine if I still have to wear a mask?
20459,You think people are getting the vaccine because they're scared of Covid?
20460,I’m going back to normal in 2021 no matter what.
20461,I’ve already stopped wearing a mask most places and no ones tried to make me.
20462,"The last time the mask producers listened to the government they spent on machines and supplies, but when the illness went away no one was willing to eat up the inventory, so no one is going to listen to the government."
20463,"The proper way would be placing orders with deposits, that way it ensures the manufacturers are willing to take the risk again to increase capacity."
20464,"I'd give you a award, but I'm broke, lol."
20465,Found the American
20466,"Fauci isn’t the ultimate authority on how people act, if people decide the risk is worth it and go back to living normal lives there isn’t much Fauci can do about it, he isn’t a legislator."
20467,Exactly.
20468,People never stopped privately socializing and thus infecting one another and never will.
20469,The government is powerless to stop this.
20470,"CA had the earliest, strictest lockdowns, mask rules etc and here we are, in our worst case scenario for hospital burden, doing worse than Florida, which is completely open...."
20471,Were you born in 88?
20472,"A similar order of magnitude of people may end up not existing due to Covid-19, than die from it."
20473,That blows my mind.
20474,That's awesome!
20475,!

20480,Natural selection will only let a suicidal virus rage for so long before all copies of it have killed themselves off
20481,I mean it might... vaccine production / rollout will still take a good amount of time.
20482,We aren't the only country trying to get doses.
20483,Social norms will dictate return to normal.
20484,As more and more people get vaccinated people as a whole will simply stop following all the rules and regulations and there isn’t anything anybody will be able to do about it.
20485,And business will welcome it.
20486,Government will be powerless to prohibit.

20491,They even say it is not conclusive.
20492,They don't know how long it is effective or how long.
20493,It's just supplementary data they collected from the study with no firm conclusions.
20494,You're so much missing the point.
20495,"There are so many different levels of ""prevention"" ... there's so much gray area that you're not seeing."
20496,"I don't know you were downvoted, it's a fair point."
20497,"We obviously don't know for sure because it's all new, but I am willing to take the chance right now based on it being pretty safe in drug trials."
20498,"On that note, most drugs Drs prescribe are not completely safe."
20499,"But, the potential side effects are outweighed by the upsides of they medicine working."
20500,Same applies to the vaccine.
20501,Why do I keep seeing different timelines this is so frustrating
20502,[removed]
20503,That number will also go up when venues start using vaccine passes to enter.
20504,If people who dont get it are restricted from going to sporting events and other public gatherings they will get on board quick.
20505,I unfortunately will have to wait longer since I am not front of the line but as soon as it is available to me at some point next year I will get it ASAP.
20506,Make it mandatory.
20507,"Simple solution, and there’s precedent for it."
20508,"If an anti-vaxxer doesn’t take the vaccine, isn’t it still possible for them to infect an animal?"
20509,"Consequently, the affect animal can then have the virus mutate within them and transferred back into humans?"
20510,"If the mutation is extreme enough, it could make the current vaccine useless if a mutation occurred and a new strain of the virus started spreading because of anti-vaxxers?"
20511,"Man, imagine being retarded."
20512,Me or Fauci?
20513,Because Fauci is quite literally the ultimate authority.

20523,[deleted]
20524,I am but I've really grown to love social distancing.
20525,I'm thriving so I'll just get the vaccine and carry on.
20526,My mom was saying that she needs to apply to work at my hospital and then quit right when she gets the vaccine.
20527,And?
20528,Did people actually think that would mean this would be over?
20529,After two weeks you reassess.
20530,How is that not obvious?
20531,I mean a bad flu or pneumonia will knock anyone healthy or not on their arse for weeks.
20532,"I certainly don't fancy catching corona virus, but nor do I fancy catching flu or salmonella."

20538,Glad we have you here to let us know what it’s like.
20539,The scientists claim they prevent severe symptoms which should prevent them shedding the virus at a high rate.

20544,It’s not about the people that don’t want it.

20564,"Whatever drives the regular cold and flu season, whether that’s population dynamics such as people staying indoors and going back to school, cooler weather, less sterilizing UV sunlight, etc., seems to work for this virus as well."
20565,"Combine that with a population where the majority do not yet have immunity, and it grows unchecked."
20566,"Now even South Korea and Japan are seeing increased cases, so it seems that even a “well behaved” populace becomes susceptible to exponential case growth eventually, unless you went for full elimination early on."

20577,The vaccine just stops the virus from showing symptoms.
20578,There isn't conclusive evidence on whether the vaccine stops transmission one way or the other.
20579,"It's possible it doesn't, but it's not a conclusively proven thing."
20580,We still don’t know
20581,In South Dakota they had people dying of Covid and on their last breaths.
20582,They and their families still denied they had Covid.
20583,You're idea is just a little too extreme for me.
20584,Feels like there is something in the middle between doing what we are doing now and the government telling everyone to put the vaccine in their body or they lose their right to work in their field.
20585,"I kinda cringed at the ""give everyone $1500 bucks who takes the vaccine"", but that seems like a more reasonable idea than yours."
20586,No offense just my opinion.
20587,Really?
20588,Trying to dismiss what I did for sharing my own experiences?
20589,I said I was getting the vaccine.

20591,Bye bye!
20592,Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out!
20593,Yes no one was going anyway.
20594,The parties being empty are a fitting tribute.
20595,Only 3.3% go to hospital?
20596,That’s not too bad but I’m sure it varies based on the health of the population
20597,Case in point right here ^
20598,I agree 100%.
20599,Everyone has a breaking point and I think the last couple of months CA residents just gave up.
20600,I'm not worried.
20601,We still have many months before that 53% can get vaccinated.
20602,"By then, ppl will be more willing once they see the ppl around them get the vaccine without developing short term side effects."

20649,He's followed the same rules as everyone else.
20650,Should he have done what he did?
20651,Of course not.
20652,Should he have met up with people outside his household?
20653,Of course not.
20654,But he wasn't doing anything that anybody else wasn't allowed to do.
20655,Man-child or would it be baby-man?
20656,Either way we were f’d by our elected leaders.
20657,"Americans are greedy individualists, the only way this works if it's mandated for things such as international flights, or people get paid to get the vaccine."
20658,Did you read the total deaths column?
20659,Wearing a mask if you’re sick or during flu season is smart.
20660,It’s really not unreasonable for people to take better precautions as a result of this.
20661,I read various sources that there is only 1 ICU bed left available in Seoul.
20662,How is this possible?
20663,A city with 25 million people reaches it's ICU capacity after a few days of a few hundred cases?
20664,And usually healthcare in Korea is extremely good (and cheap) so I don't understand it.
20665,"If Seoul would have a serious outbreak (for example 10.000 cases a day, not uncommon in other cities with smaller populations) that would mean a real big issue."
20666,Maybe having the toughest restrictions in the U.S. for so long made people feel hopeless and they gave up masking and social distancing.
20667,I really don't see a way Gov.
20668,Newsom can stop house parties and friends gathering in their homes for meals?
20669,"I *am* scared and I *am* worried and I have a right to be, and so does everybody else."
20670,Please research for 5 minutes before taking a gut dislike to information you don't want.
20671,"Every source I've read points out at the bottom of their articles, how healthcare can charge for the *administering* of the vaccine."
20672,Why is nobody acknowledging this?
20673,"It's right there in the Operation Warp Speed transcript, and numerous new sources have articles about it."
20674,I don't know how you would manage.. that sounds really tough.
20675,Is this part of the health care system problems?
20676,"I dont remember the details of these posts but hospitalised patients get bills going over 1 million for ridiculous charges mostly being ""patient responsibility (tf even is that) like being on a ventilator, PPE needed to enter their room (really), the days you spent in ICU, your room, someone had a multiple organ failure from covid and for saving them it was 100,000$ in total, drugs admistered, rehabilitation facilities, a positive or negative covid test, stay in isolation, being treated for phenomia and among other things I don't remember."
20677,This is insane?
20678,Americans are just paying hospitals at whatever price they set depending on where they are and which inscurance company they have too I guess?
20679,"Feel free to corrent anything in there, I'm not from the U.S so I'm not an expert lol"
20680,Jesus analogies much?
20681,And no the issue of access to work and other social institutions conditioned by vaccination is not new.
20682,Anti vaxxers who want to send their kids to public school without a measles vaccine are not going to find much purchase in that choice.
20683,It still is your body and your choice.
20684,You do not have to take the vaccine.

20737,"Right now at least some people listen, its seeming more and more likely that once the vaccine is widely available fewer and fewer people will listen."

20743,"&gt;VRT reported that in photographs of the event, the visitors were wearing masks, but care home residents were not."
20744,Isn't our entire strategy of everyone wearing homemade cloth masks based on the premise that the people who are infected prevent other people from getting it by wearing those homeade cloth masks.
20745,"I.e we don't wear N95 masks, which would protect us from inbound infection from other people, because if we do the health sector would run out."
20746,Instead we all wear homemade cloth masks to prevent each of us infecting other people.
20747,"That way the masks that health professionals need are saved for them but we are all protected because everyone around us is wearing a cloth mask to prevent their droplets from infecting us

Yet in this case the person who was infected wore a mask and still infected everyone else."
20748,So... the premise all of us are using to wear homemade cloth masks didn't work.

20877,"Even if that is true, case severity has been linked to how long you are contagious, so it stands to reason that the time frame you are able to spread the virus it would be for a fraction of how long you'd be contagious if you weren't vaccinated."

20948,Shops are meant to be at a lower capacity but the walmarts and targets look as busy as they always are this time of year.
20949,"Meanwhile, social media is full of pictures of people gathering for early christmas parties."
20950,Chosen one!
20951,"Honestly, things should reopen everywhere once it's available to all who want it."
20952,If a person chooses to not get it and suffers the consequences I won't feel bad for them one bit.
20953,I will feel bad for the children and elderly with caretakers who will withhold the vaccine from them.
20954,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fauci-predicts-herd-immunity-u-s-late-spring-or-early-n1251151 
I swear this is different in every article about it with him."
20955,In this article he says the “umbrella” of herd immunity will be late spring/early summer.
20956,Can we get rid of Florida.
20957,Because kindness to others IS POLITICAL.
20958,Why is there some people always want to tell us healthcare blah blah is actually not free?
20959,"Yeah, we all know someone has to f*cking pay for it."
20960,I thought the problem would be keeping them cold enough.
20961,"As a doctor who used to manage clinical trials, I’m not agreeing with the article."
20962,Lmao at the idea that not prioritizing inmates for a revolutionary new vaccine is cruel and unusual punishment.
20963,"Nobody is talking about withholding it from them or anything, you asshole."
20964,I have been closely following the research and if you read a few articles you would feel better.
20965,"I’m sorry you’re scared, but the least productive thing you can do right now is tell everyone this misinformation and spread fear."
20966,It’s not the truth.
20967,"We won’t be charged much, if anything, for the vaccine."
20968,All of these organizations have confirmed it.
20969,You’ll be able to get your vaccine when it’s available to the general public unless you’re an essential worker or at risk.
20970,It’s a safe vaccine that was only expedited because of the generous funding and the amount of people working on it.
20971,All you need to focus on right now is staying safe until it’s available to you
20972,Lol 5 weeks.
20973,There's a bunch of us still having some sort of symptoms 9-10 months later..
20974,So why are so many Americans still against free universal health care?
20975,From what I've read it seems like this system is really easy to exploit?
20976,"&gt;State health officials reported 9,411 new cases and 94 deaths in Tuesday’s pandemic update."
20977,"And with the holiday season, experts expect cases to go on the rise again."
20978,"Though, of course, people generally don’t trust these numbers."
20979,"Oh sure, *now* they can't."
20980,"In Australia, New Zealand, and some other places they closed down hard in February and March, and closed the borders, and have kept the numbers low enough that contact tracing remained a feasible goal -- which in turn keeps the numbers low."
20981,"So Australia today has had a *total* of 28,069 cases and 194 deaths (source:https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), and authorities have the luxury of trying to trace the contacts of two new infections."
20982,0% chance that happens.
20983,not with local govts that cant afford the costs being put in charge without a bailout.
20984,unless he means fall 2024 or something
20985,So never.
20986,A truthful irrelevancy.
20987,You’re arguing wiTh yourself.
20988,Thank you for the reply and rich discussion.
20989,The bioethics issue is understandable; I was trying to see how someone like you that has no agenda perceived the efficacy rates without intentional exposure
20990,More than that.
20991,There are plenty of crunchy naturality is religion Biden voters too.
20992,Then you have 75 million kids.

21000,why is fauci saying we'll be good by the spring/summer then?
21001,people are saying so many different things on this sub
21002,You're allowed to lock yourself down.
21003,Go for it
21004,I think pre-symptomatic spread was always known to be larger then the people without symptoms.
21005,I heard the viral load is low for asymptomatic which causes less to be spread.
21006,This was a few months ago I remember reading that.
21007,This study helps give more hard numbers
21008,not if you throw money at it.
21009,which is what other countries have been doing.
21010,"When I heard politicians claiming that dead people had cast ballots in the election, I assumed they meant zombies"
21011,Interesting how the California hospitals are overrun but not Florida where everything has been open.
21012,Just a comment from a doctor that used to manage clinical trials!
21013,But I don’t need to rely on that to know what I’m talking about.
21014,We are always going to have cases pop up here and there.
21015,The goal is that we can contact trace and stop an outbreak in its tracks in the future.

21020,You are the bad guy in history.
21021,I sure do.
21022,Went through the same damn thing.
21023,The issue is what economic historians call state capacity.
21024,It's basically how well a country is governed.
21025,"It's got nothing to do with military might but includes things like border control, being able to collect taxes, enforcing laws, the bureaucracy being able to enact political policy, low corruption, etc."
21026,"Australia, New Zealand and all the other countries that have dealt with this well have it in spades."
21027,The US doesn't.
21028,I would have assumed Canada would be better at this for the same reason Australia and NZ are because we all copied the UK government system.
21029,"State capacity in the UK seems to atrophied away (as one Australian commentator living in the UK put it ""The home office couldn't run a two door shithouse"")."
21030,The flip side of having a government that works is that the people get used to things working so when the shit hits the fan like it has people are more likely to trust the government to do something sensible and will follow the new rules.
21031,"The key thing that all countries that have dealt with this well isn't any particular policy (masks, social distancing, lockdown, border closures, etc)."
21032,It's that they made a plan and executed it competently.
21033,Question of ignorance - if you are vaccinated the first year.
21034,Would you be better prepared to fight the virus the next year even without another yearly shot?
21035,Why is it worse than a normal passport?
21036,"Soo bizarre, and I thought Illinois was fucking bad, but we seemigly have avoided the Thanksgiving surge so far for covid19"
21037,It's sad that we have to rely on people's morals to report if they test positive or not.
21038,Unfortunately there is a fucking slew of people that would never let anyone know.
21039,Hence why were in this fucking shit show.
21040,All points are incredibly rational.
21041,I like responses like this - full of really deep insight without being snarky.
21042,"Thank you, fellow redditor!"
21043,You've changed my mind!
21044,So ridiculous!
21045,I will never understand the thought process of many in this country!
21046,Smh.
21047,I bet you can make the deniers do the autopsy themselves and still say it wasn’t Covid.
21048,&gt;Pfizer’s vaccine requires a storage temperature of around minus 70 degrees Celsius.
21049,"Vials of the vaccine are stored in trays, which carry a minimum of 975 doses each."
21050,"Army Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees logistics for the Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, told reporters that two trays of the vaccine that arrived at two separate locations in Alabama and California had to be returned to Pfizer after the temperature somehow fell to minus 92 degrees Celsius."

21086,"That isn't the return to normalcy yet, though."
21087,"There will still be a number of people who won't or can't take the vaccine, so there will likely still be a number of infected for a while."
21088,"Even with the virus under control, I think it'll take a while for things to recover."
21089,"Though, I believe that most industries will be well into recovery by Summer."
21090,Especially some of the dems who were undermining the vaccine not too long ago.

21097,Wasn't it two weeks
21098,&gt; Why wouldn't we want to see one of the best former doctors in America ever again?
21099,Fixed it for you.
21100,"He hasn't been a practicing doctor in a long time, 1980's I believe."
21101,We don't want to see him because he looked directly in the camera and lied to all of us.
21102,He can't be trusted.
21103,I'm just hoping me and the boys can all get vaccines before the end of summer so we can hit up the lake cabin together

21111,That’s what we were talking about :) It’s nice that people have thy option and hopefully the COVID vaccine will be the same!
21112,"Yes, but then by extension they shouldn’t have a heavy influence on policy"
21113,"Agreed, local Wuhan gov definitely fucked up and delayed the response by nearly a month probably, and made the spread far worse in Wuhan."
21114,"Once China central gov realized what was happening in Wuhan, their response is lightning fast, as a result, the people of Wuhan suffered a pro-longed multi-month locked down due to the ""widespreadness"" of the virus in Wuhan, but elsewhere in China, the people in general were not affected much by the pandemic due to the quick actions of the Central government."

21124,"They improve/adjust the flu vax yearly, ofc."
21125,"Normal means when COVID transmission rate is effectively zero, like the measles."
21126,The more likely route is if schools and places of employment make it mandatory.
21127,Well no.

21132,"It’s frustrating, to say the least."
21133,"&gt;	similar to the flu

This is a really annoying comparison, though I wonder if you meant in terms of deaths."
21134,"It is similar in your projected acceptable death tally, which is really completely subjective."
21135,It is dissimilar in nearly every other way.
21136,"&gt;	probably was one of first to buy masks, extreme social distance and have only done outside visits with family and one friend group

Strictly speaking, you shouldn’t have done the last two things."
21137,"&gt;	But you’re insane if you ask people for more, especially after this all started with ONLY flattening the curve."
21138,"Flattening the curve isn’t the target, because the curve is dependent on public health resources and infrastructure capacity, which vary with a multitude of factors (politics, location, staff, PPE, drugs, beds, just to name a few)."
21139,Stopping the spread is the target.
21140,"This could have been achieved with uniform mask and social distancing mandates, as has been demonstrably effective in other countries."
21141,"The US doesn’t have enough vaccine, enough trust or compliance from the public, and doesn’t have anything close to a cohesive strategy (or effective leadership) to get out of this mess quickly."

21155,"Some places are open, but some places are locked down."
21156,"If my county would open everything but movie theatres, then there would still be a lockdown on movie theatres."
21157,"Even if I can travel across county lines and state lines to find an open movie theatre, there would still be a lockdown on movie theatres in my county."
21158,Well truth is he doesn't know.
21159,I like the guy but he's been wrong about a lot with this pandemic so far.
21160,Not because he's stupid obviously but because this shit is unprecedented and all you can really do is make your best guess.
21161,"I was just talking to a friend about how if Google were to get into the personal banking field and offering unprecedented interest rates for today (say, 3% or higher) that I'd have no problem letting them serve me advertisements based on where I already spend my money."
21162,"Hell, it's the least they could offer after I've already given them so much access to my data for all these years."
21163,I’m all for people refusing to get vaccinated.
21164,There is going to be no shortage of demand for this thing and that just means I’m further up in line!
21165,We'll likely have data by then that indicates vaccination prevents the viral load necessary for being a vector.
21166,Then you just require everyone to have proof of vaccination to participate or attend.
21167,"This is partially for vasovagal syncope, in addition to allergies, which I’ve been told is a bigger issue every time I mention it’s an issue I have."
21168,They're amazing live
21169,That's not how it works.
21170,Lifting restrictions because you're tired of following them isn't going to magically make everything normal.
21171,Cases here in Wisconsin have oddly dropped.
21172,Not really seeing that huge Thanksgiving spike that I was worried about.
21173,Good luck to her!
21174,Why wouldn't we want to see one of the best doctors in America ever again?
21175,"Actually, there will be a rush of weddings 2021 due to all the cancellations this year."
21176,As soon as cases become a trickle since a good portion of people have either been infected or vaccinated life will go back to normal.
21177,I expect by end of next year beginning of 2022 life will be like pre covid outside of people wearing masks when sick now.
21178,They had to report their covid test to management and that’s how I found out.
21179,I’m not supposed to know who it was but I only came into contact with one person that entire day and they’re the only other person removed from the work schedule.
21180,I’m sure they’ll bring it up to them cause they don’t even want us showing up if we have a sore throat.

21187,Not a doctor.
21188,If your asymptomatic.
21189,Yes.
21190,Coupled with the vaccine probably because your still caring the virus.
21191,"From the Federal Reserve: Rich countries, such as the U.S., have experienced a remarkable decline in their fertility rate as they became rich."
21192,"Also, the relationship holds at the individual level, as rich families tend to have fewer children than poor families."
21193,"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income

21195,"Same, I am going into senior year in 2021 and I’ll be damned if I can’t"
21196,We need 75% to establish herd immunity by Q4 2021.
21197,More or less than that will change when we achieve herd immunity.

21214,Well see how well this goes
21215,"&gt;She does not know if people may go around spreading asymptomatically despite vaccination

This is really important too."
21216,We won't be able to take our masks off until we can answer this one.
21217,it's been believe that asymptomatic spread is very rare for a while now
21218,Not in my area.

21248,"This is an experience I’ll never get back, and it’s so unfair."
21249,Nice way to talk about your wife lmao
21250,Which is why they're throwing up flags until they have more information.
21251,"Right now the, iirc they're at 2 reactions per 130k vaccinated."
21252,"For context, In America at least, you have a greater chance catching covid and being hospitalized on a given day than of getting a reaction."
21253,And that's assuming the reactions were directly related to the vaccine.
21254,"Remember,."
21255,"In Asian continent, there are another olympics game named Asian Games and will be held in Hangzhou next summer"
21256,I took him to be vaccinated for some things and she completely lost her shit.
21257,He still does t have his MMR...
21258,also all reasons why you shouldn't rush a vaccine through trials and development.
21259,"you only get one shot to get it right, if the initial shots turn out to be problematic then you've lost most of the population on the program regardless of any enhancements to safety or efficacy in the future."
21260,Mid fall 2021?
21261,Cuz we way passed Mid Fall 2020
21262,I bet you would like to know.
21263,I can hear the hamster running through your mental gymnastics course.
21264,He left the door open to 1.7 million COVID deaths back in [March](https://twitter.com/thisweekabc/status/1239165855633756160?s=21).
21265,"As recently as October he predicted the vaccine would be available starting in 
[April](https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/fauci-predicts-coronavirus-vaccine-available-by-april-2021/)."
21266,So you can do your own eyeballing to do the math on when things should “return to normal”.
21267,"17M people have been confirmed positive, and anywhere from 5-8 times that amount have been infected, which is approaching a third of the country."
21268,I’m sorry to hear you only have until next October to live.
21269,We simply don't have long term testing on this vaccine.
21270,We can be pretty sure it's safe but you can't tell someone that claims its not 100% safe they are wrong.
21271,....... good one?
21272,"It’s not a “mental illness”, it is a basic response to social isolation"
21273,Yes this gonna be some weird dystopian world.
21274,"Walk up to the bouncer at trivia night, flash you “I got vaccinated” sticker on you best Rip n Dip shirt."
21275,“Right on in sir.”
21276,Yea we don’t really know what this vaccine does or doesn’t do.
21277,Still working things out.
21278,Inject this shit into you and your kids
21279,Polls showed Trump wouldnt get 70 million votes.
21280,Polls are shit.
21281,Fuck you.
21282,There is literally nothing wrong with distanced visits outdoors.

21295,"Yeah, my wife works at one and they can’t take any more patients, but go on..."
21296,There have been numerous Supreme Court cases that clearly say sedition is not protected by the 1st Amendment.
21297,Baseless claims of fraud without a shred of legitamite evidence clearly is an attempt to overthrow our democracy or enrich a grifter.
21298,Same would go with a social media disinformation campaign designed to intentionally spread a deadly pandemic.
21299,I think the word you’re looking for is “cheaper”
21300,"Man there really is always someone like you who can't allow people to feel bad about their situation because ""someone always has it worse"" I'm well and fully aware of what past generations have gone through, I'm aware that people have lost family, friends and their own lives during this pandemic."
21301,"And I'm sorry they've all had to go through those terrible experiences, I'm sorry for the lives lost."
21302,But just because other people have gone through more doesn't mean I'm not allowed to feel bad about my current situation.
21303,Mine was free I'm not sure where people are going that they pay for it.
21304,"Shh, don't ask questions."
21305,Just consume vaccine.
21306,"The top comments on a website where the narrative is heavily controlled and manipulated can't be wrong, can they?"
21307,Did you bother to read anything?
21308,Do you ever read anything?
21309,"From the first article, these are Fauci's words:  
  
&gt; IF we get the overwhelming majority of people taking the vaccine ... people can START thinking about doing things that were too dangerous just months ago  
   
Second article is EXACTLY WHAT OP POSTED:  
  
&gt; By the time we get to the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality,"
21310,The article did not say no babies would be born.
21311,"That's not how it works, and pretending it is will just make things worse (like they have been)."
21312,I'm astounded at the number of people who think that just deciding to act normal after they've been vaccinated is any different from acting normal right now.
21313,"That's not how herd immunity works and your selfishness is the reason we are where we are now, and why it's going to take longer than it should for transmission rates to drop low enough to actually have a real, factual normal life again."
21314,Fuck you.
21315,"Global net population growth is currently over 78 million for 2020, and that’s with a devastating pandemic."
21316,"You are correct, the economy depends on population growth, but a lot of women around the world are still popping out babies!"
21317,It’s not for lack of trying.
21318,China was refusing to let anyone investigate anything until now.
21319,I can’t imagine there is much left to investigate.
21320,Approval Sunday injections Monday seems certain
21321,"Interesting thing will be what the new ""normal"" looks like."
21322,People die dude.
21323,[removed]
21324,"Yes, it's important to know that but constantly changing the time frame on television is 100% not helping."
21325,"People psychologically need a timeframe, not having one is just going to make pandemic fatigue worse."
21326,"If you mean for people to make informed decisions, then yes by all means more information is better."
21327,"The problem is that government is using this  to drive policy that is completely contrary to normal life, this life is currently bizarre and uncomfortable...NO ONE wants to, nor can afford continue, past a vaccine being widely available...so ""follow the science"" eventually can't be a mantra government follows or you get mass non-compliance."
21328,"Once I get a vaccine, and for the record I'm in a low risk group so probably closer to summer than today,  I'll still mask up in stores etc, but me, and no one else I know, are going to be putting off social activity or silently accept businesses being forced to close."
21329,So in that sense no we don't need to be hearing from the scientists constantly since they're operating in an unrealistic world where only the scientific facts of the virus matter....thats not the real world.
21330,"And it's not ""probably"", if you think a majority of people will accept covid restrictions once we have 1-2 hundred million people vaccinated you probably should look around at what's happening now."
21331,Well that’s what happens when a bunch of idiots wont listen...or try to stop spreading it...or fucking anything to be honest
21332,[deleted]
21333,At least he/she is waiting until they get the vaccine.. that's definitely better than just not giving a fuck from the start.
21334,I've already had it but still wear a mask in public where it's mandatory.
21335,"Grocery store with old people around, hell yea I'm wearing a mask."
21336,Bar with a bunch of young people who have had their temp taken at the door and are abiding by all laws?
21337,"Nah, I'm going to support the local business owners and have some fun because I'm free to do so."
21338,I'm also free to not hangout with grandma this holiday season.
21339,Def will wait til after the vaccine to hang out with older loved ones.
21340,"Or certainly by the evening time... the evening time is the best time, eh, Alex?"
21341,How seriously does one need to ponder the fact that he got a Russian vaccine while shooting a film in Russia?
21342,Very seriously?
21343,We're still in autumn right now :|
21344,[removed]
21345,Think about it.
21346,Fall is the realistic timeline.
21347,Literally everything about the vaccine has gone slower than everyone promised.
21348,Timelines will get pushed back.
21349,"The vaccine will be widely available by April or May for anyone who wants it, but a good 1/3 of the population won't take it for whatever reason."
21350,"It's also not 100% effective, but if we assume that it is 95% effective, and some people who are vaccinated end up taking 20 times the risk they were taking previously, it is possible that they completely nullify its effectiveness."
21351,"Also, it has not been shown that vaccine prevents the spread of disease; it only has been shown to prevent people from getting sick."
21352,"However, once a good percentage of the population takes it, community spread will slow down, and then once things open up more, it will go up again."
21353,"Repeat, rinse, and mid-fall is about when it might be close to negligible."
21354,"But I should stress, even mid-fall is a timeline that is faster than humanity has ever dealt with any disease this widespread and would be extremely impressive historically speaking."
21355,We need to be patient.
21356,"More than that, we need to be stop assuming that it will be over soon, so that mentally we can prepare ourselves to survive the next few months."
21357,[deleted]
21358,Thats a stupid ass answer
21359,"Or, maybe it’s more nuanced than that."
21360,"The more educated a population is, the fewer kids, not necessarily a more complacent one."
21361,But bad times can also be a reason to not have kids.
21362,Things are moving fast.
21363,I'm hoping the general public gets them soon.
21364,I can’t say enough how much I appreciate you and others in your profession.
21365,I am so sorry for the way things have been.
21366,"The hardest thing about 2020, aside from covid, had been watching how our country reacted to it."
21367,It’s been demoralizing to say the least.
21368,Hang in there and do something nice for yourself when you can.
21369,I’m thinking of you.
21370,I wish I could offer more comfort.
21371,Lol.
21372,Sure it is.
21373,"and now you have to go die in a hole on the other side of the world 

oh no wait that's what every generation before ours had to do to make sure you get to pout"
21374,"Add 3,000 more daily to a preventable sickness

Lmao numbskull"
21375,What?
21376,How are you supposed to stay at home without groceries and deliveries?
21377,Also AWS is keeping your home entertainment running.
21378,Normal life as in bombing other countries like it's going out of style?
21379,Nah I'll take proper healthcare and a competent government but we can't have nice things in america unless you're rich
21380,You do have a point.
21381,"But as a professional in a different STEM career, I know experts are experts for a reason."
21382,This is not some  new technology that was just thrown together within months that we're crossing fingers on.
21383,Vaccines like this have been a long time coming.
21384,I think in this situation it's worth any risks because they're likely minor.
21385,What does the FDA have to do with 9/11 and the police?
21386,"Sorry, I’m still searching my comment for anywhere I mentioned vaccines."
21387,"I think people need to understand at least one thing, the psychological/mental aspect of the pandemic will definitely end before the medical aspect of the pandemic ends."
21388,"Once the elderly/most at risk and health care workers are vaccinated, I highly doubt bans on large events plus us having to social distance, etc will still be much a thing."
21389,"Well, time to book an appointment in the morning."
21390,"For Christmas, give your child the gift of not dying of measles!"
21391,"For real though, good luck, and take good care of yourself and your kid."
21392,"If there was an serious adverse event reaction, it would’ve already happened already."
21393,Now they don’t have 2 years of safety data.
21394,The European flu vaccine caused narcolepsy but it took them a long time to find out.
21395,Dude.
21396,It hurts.
21397,I know.
21398,Well good thing we ordered enough for our country...
21399,The virus is less of an issue in private gatherings when people don't get it elsewhere first.
21400,Allowing indoor dining means more people will bring the virus with them when they go visit someone.
21401,"Yeah, Fauci should be ashamed of his early anti-mask messages."
21402,"You are the most prominent virology expert in the US, you are not allowed to make these kind of mistakes."
21403,Every single doctor in China knows and trust the science about effectiveness of masks.
21404,"You don't get to play the ""I changed my mind based on the science"" card, the science was already clear one hundred years ago, when people wore masks against the Spanish flu."
21405,"Also, if you knew, but lied to preserve masks."
21406,"Thanks for destroying credibility of the US pandemic response, and fueling the anti-mask culture that still cause problems today."
21407,His concern is with no one's health.
21408,If they get production shutdown (as they did in Italy) it costs him money.
21409,Don't do that to Tom.
21410,What I read was that flattening the curve was about buying time.
21411,It was super new and we didn't really know how best to treat it.
21412,"We didn't have enough supplies (masks and PPE, ventilators, hospital beds, etc.)"
21413,to treat the number of people who would become sick.
21414,"Flattening the curve was about not using too many of those supplies too soon, but also about buying time for the doctors to learn the best treatment, to produce more supplies and get them to hospitals around the country."
21415,"We (many, but not all of us) did our part of staying home and helping buy time."
21416,But the government and hospitals (mostly the federal government) didn't do their part and get more supplies.
21417,"Based on flu shots, I think it will depend a lot on where you go."
21418,Would have a better shot at a community clinic than a pharmacy.
21419,"Though, I also wouldn't be surprised if a large pharmacy like Walgreens just covered the difference, just for good publicity."
21420,She talks about exactly the same thing!
21421,The relapse from trying to do to much.
21422,Makes it very hard.
21423,God bless!
21424,Her relapses seem to be tied to her hormone cycle.
21425,Just a weird bit of trivia in case it helps in your case...
21426,Talk to your doctor but diarrhea and stomach discomfort are not severe reactions.
21427,She was also worried about what happens if you become infected with a coronavirus of a different strain.
21428,She explained that with dengue fever the initial infection ruin can be super mild.
21429,But that if you get reinfected with a slightly different strain it can cause a hemorrhagic disease.
21430,She wants to be sure this wouldn’t happen with SARS-CoV-2.
21431,"Honestly, screw those people."
21432,That same attitude is why we are where we are now.
21433,"Once the vaccine has been available for long enough where everyone who wants one can have gotten it and however much time needs to pass for it to be effective, we need to be opening back up."
21434,Anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers can deal with the mortal consequences.
21435,At this point I would take normal life over healthcare
21436,Well the obvious answer is that they shouldn’t have came to the country illegally.
21437,The vaccine is still 100% unavailable to over 20% of the population (kids) and likely won't be available for a long time.
21438,Seemed to handle this past summers' heat pretty well..
21439,Looking at some of these comments and I half expected to see parler in my address bar.

21443,way more than half at this point.
21444,Fingers crossed.
21445,Oh cool you trust the experts.
21446,So which experts have shown long term side effects in children?
21447,I understand wanting more data.
21448,I just don’t see how the US with our out of control infections could have waited any longer.
21449,It’s just a balancing act  and trusting  in the initial data.
21450,GET THAT BOY SOME MILK
21451,"&gt; So OP has a reasonable basis for his thesis that people have less kids the richer they get

21462,"You will, Fauci loves to make conservative estimates"
21463,Why does everyone act like they cared about the elderly before?
21464,"Half of the people ""taking this seriously"" would never go out of their way to spend time with their relatives when they were able to - hell a lot were *paying* to keep them away from them in a nursing home."
21465,"I’ve had to know the term “vasovagal” since I was 10 and started passing out whenever people would talk about bodily functions, like the woman on TV who dressed in a full body suit with organs all over it."
21466,It’s different than normal fainting since it’s a reaction to mental stimulus and not a blood-sugar or allergic reaction.
21467,"I’m always amazed at how many people suffer from it and don’t know what it’s called (like my dad when he was in his 50s, who somehow never talked to me or my mom about it)."
21468,Yeah.
21469,It was actually jarring to see Sanders wear a mask for some TV appearances because he might be the first person I've seen from either party do it.
21470,"Now most of them tell everyone else to wear masks, but they always take off their own mask to talk."
21471,Then somehow they're surprised when the person at the supermarket pulls down their mask to talk to someone?
21472,I'll tell that to all the people who've died and literally lost decades of their lives.
21473,I'm sure they'll cry for you.
21474,And the worst offenders have been out of school for multiple decades.
21475,I see a time where all social media has to be banned as too dangerous for modern societies.
21476,We will probably reach that point around 2012.

21875,I honesty think there is something special about the N95 band.
21876,That only happens rarely.
21877,Think about it.
21878,"If the best vaccines don't work 5% of the time, doesn't that imply that some people's immune systems are not working so well?"
21879,"Our immune systems are not perfect machines, and they might have different blindspots."
21880,Every virus has a chance of reinfection for some small percentage of people.
21881,This is why herd immunity is the main goal of vaccination.
21882,"Some individuals may not actually be immune even after getting vaccinated, or they might not be able to get one in the first place."
21883,"But if everyone they meet is immune, they're perfectly safe."
21884,You are so arrogant that are blaming for being given the best advice they could give you at the time?
21885,Do you now feel entitled to do whatever you want?
21886,You are en entitled pick that is not part of the solution.
21887,"Do what scientist tell you, they are not your enemies, the virus is."
21888,I don't believe in voter fraud.
21889,"1 article says spring, other says fall."
21890,"Both say most people would be to get vaccinated

Difference is?"
21891,"Interestingly enough, in a lot of poorer countries the poor people actually have *more* babies when times are grim."
21892,"They play with a rather different set of rules compared to more developed nations, of course."
21893,"More babies = more chances that one of them will survive, get good employment, and take the entire family out of poverty."
21894,Costco near you?
21895,I mean they're right lol
21896,Liechtenstein standing by.
21897,What do you do?
21898,Churches have no business in medicine.
21899,I wonder how much of that has to do with people who don’t really wear them.
21900,"The ones who wear it under their chin or take it off the second they get inside, etc."
21901,Edit: I can see where groups together in someone’s private home is more of a concern.
21902,"Anti-maskers/vaxxers didn’t care about us when we tried to put preventative measures in place to slow the spread to save lives and not overwhelm our healthcare industry, so I’m sure as fuck not caring about them after the rest of us are vaccinated."
21903,They can take their essential oils and hopefully soon to be preventable Covid virus and shove it.
21904,It certainly seemed that way.
21905,People couldn’t even wear a mask.
21906,You’re not gonna get these people to get the vaccine when they think bill gates is the one that’s going to inject them with windows 10.
21907,Oof
21908,I’ll have to find that data!
21909,"I do expect more waves, but it’s definitely a good sign transmission is below 1 again"
21910,[removed]
21911,I live in the U.S. and before coronavirus I had actually tried wearing a mask in public when sick before and gotten in trouble for it.
21912,"Many Americans default to hostility when seeing a mask obscuring someone's identifying facial features, and even in formal or professional settings people will say ""If you know you're so sick you need to wear a mask then we can't allow you to be here."""
21913,and make you leave.
21914,Not wearing a mask is often safer just to protect you from drawing the negative attention of other humans.
21915,He also said not to wear masks.
21916,Gota admit this sub has become so boring when 99% of the posts are about America.
21917,Even more so when it was the period in which they kept breaking their daily death records like 2-3 days in a row.
21918,Sometimes I’m so ashamed to be from the south.
21919,I’m so grateful that I don’t have to live there anymore.
21920,And honestly who doesn't know that the US doesn't have universal healthcare.
21921,We talk about it all the damn time on reddit
21922,Why.
21923,You take the vaccine why are you worried about me?
21924,Will do!
21925,"He said into next fall or winter, that means gradually as they approach these measures will have stopped"
21926,too late......
21927,Fuck that.
21928,I already wasted a year of my life to this lockdown.
21929,Call me selfish I don’t care.
21930,Once I get the vaccine and my family gets the vaccine I’m done with this “social distancing”.
21931,It would probably result in divorce.
21932,That’s the problem.
21933,It’s literally that big a deal.
21934,"Might want to add a /s, some people might believe it since it’s upvoted."
21935,I feel you.
21936,Not trying to turn this into a dick measuring contest; more-so joining you in the rant.
21937,I turned 21 in April and it was pretty depressing not being able to celebrate like what you’ve been expecting in the years leading up to it.
21938,I made the most of it doing a zoom call with all my buddies and my bro even got a celeb to join it and hang out but still not the same.
21939,Plus the last 3 semesters of college life ruined.
21940,But what we both can do is try and live life even more to the fullest once we get our normalcy back.
21941,Cheers to you

21947,"But this is what I’ve read before, especially when I had it."
21948,The “death” toll is absolute bullshit.
21949,Dying of cancer and catch covid?
21950,Covid death.
21951,90 years old and on death bed?
21952,Covid death.
21953,Total deaths in the country have not gone up at all.
21954,Suicides on the other hand?
21955,Doubling worldwide.
21956,OPEN.
21957,THE.
21958,COUNTRY.
21959,"Holy hell.. people still are wanting things to just ""go back to the way they were"" when the way things were is what caused this bullshit in the first place."
21960,Normalcy is a facade to the issues of things.
21961,How complacent and ignorant can people really keep being
21962,"&gt; Until they get covid or a friend or family member dies they don’t care

""Maw maw was old and it was just her time to go."
21963,Do you like my new iPhone 12 I got with the life insurance money?
21964,"This and the 4-wheeler."""
21965,That's one of my neighbors.
21966,They still believe the virus is a hoax the entire purpose of which was to thwart Trump's reelection.
21967,"Also, no one is dying of covid which doesn't exist."
21968,"Also, the hospitals are just putting that on the death certificate because they get a bunch of money for it."
21969,Cool!
21970,That's a good way to look at it
21971,[deleted]
21972,"Ah yeah same here, Ive been in my apartment taking classes all year so I thought I was pretty safe from it."
21973,Lotta people don’t seem to realize how much it sucks when your breathing isn’t 100%.
21974,Hopin I can start to get back in shape at some point and build back the lung capacity.
21975,"Sucks, but I’m grateful to be in a good spot compared to thousands of other ppl."
21976,Makes me want to reach out to anyone with asthma and make sure they get a vaccine though!
21977,"First cases rise, then deaths follow a few weeks later."
21978,3486 deaths today on Worldometers...
21979,"He straight up lied about masks and instead of making a reason up, just said he lied."
21980,You have to understand that most people are going to lose trust in you even if you are doing it for the “right” reason.
21981,But you’ve heard the phrase before right?
21982,You’re acting like you’ve never heard that phrase before
21983,It depends.
21984,"If you've got health insurance, it's generally free."
21985,"Low income people generally qualify for free or subsidized insurance, although it's more complicated if you're undocumented."
21986,"If you don't have insurance or you don't want to show documentation for some reason, it may not be covered."
21987,"here's a thought, why not wash your hands ""and"" wear a mask."
21988,"There's a problem with stockpiling some products like masks that have rubber straps, if they sit in the warehouse for several years between pandemics then the rubber will start degrading and those masks can become useless if the rubber straps break as soon as you put the mask on since it won't stay on your face."
21989,Then there's also the costs of storage in those warehouses since it could be years before the PPE is even needed that couldn't be fulfilled by normal manufacturing capabilities during non-pandemic times.
21990,"Plus, there's also additional transportation costs to get the equipment to the stockpile warehouse, instead of just shipping it to the normal supply chain channels for distribution, and then to ship it again when it's finally needed for the next national emergency which might be many years from now."
21991,It's not quite as simple as stockpiling crude oil underground in case there's a shortage since it doesn't degrade in long-term storage.
21992,Yes and no.
21993,"Individually, some of us pay and some of us don't."
21994,If you don't earn enough money to be taxed then you pay a big fat $0 for healthare.
21995,It literally is free for some of us by design.
21996,"Collectively though, you are correct, we all pay for it."
21997,It's also a fraction of what the US pays per capita.
21998,Even those of us who foot a relatively large portion of the bill (such as myself) still pay quite a bit less than we would at a comparable US position (such as myself when I worked down there).
21999,There is no field with worse title inflation than the financial services industry.
22000,I remember being super impressed that an ex-girlfriend was a VP at a bank.
22001,I was less impressed when I found out she had something like 3 direct reports at a time when I was managing a team of 30.
22002,"Nurse here, got vaccinated on the 15th, 2nd dose on the 5th."
22003,Can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
22004,Never been so excited to get a shot.
22005,"Also, so far no side effects other than soreness at injection site."
22006,We know the death rate for COVID 19 cases in minors.
22007,We know this is low.
22008,The vast majority of children who get COVID recover and are more or less okay.
22009,"We also know the rate of side effects (of any kind, from minor inconvenience to something truly dangerous) in people given each of the various available COVID vaccines."
22010,"The testing process for any vaccine specifically includes looking for side effects, and quantifying them by frequency or lethality."
22011,Vaccines **do not reach the public** until they’ve been safety tested this way.
22012,"A person given the Pfizer vaccine (the one OP is referencing, as there was a recent story about a bad reaction to it) suffering side effects of any kind from it is mathematically less likely to happen than a minor who contracts COVID dying from it."
22013,Severe side effects are rarer still.
22014,"We KNOW this, because it was a part of the vaccine trial."
22015,"It’s because of the type of deaths, it’s killing people that are on the verge of death."
22016,Like my own grandmother died from Covid.
22017,She was also 99 years old and had dementia for 10 years.
22018,It doesn’t carry the same sorrow as a working mother of 2 or something.
22019,"Also even before the pandemic, California has one of the worst per capita hospital beds per population in the US."
22020,So California will be hit hard even if the per capita infection rate here is still lower than that in most other states.
22021,"Yeah, I always have one now (had them before as well, just didn't have it on me at the time) ."
22022,"That was my first time having that much of a reaction, so I didn't think I needed to use it until I was basically at the entrance."
22023,It's sucks because now every reaction is more severe than it used to be.
22024,"A tiny bit of good news, most other versions of coronaviruses don't mutate, or mutate very very slowly."
22025,"Not that it can't happen, of course, but at least it's less likely for this family of viruses."
22026,"Ya normal changes for anyone

I don't care much for international travel for instance so if that's in the boundaries of ""normal"" then yeah normal is later in that example"
22027,"You do realize it doesn't apply here, right?"
22028,"&gt;More vaccinations means less social distancing is required

If you want to spread it."
22029,Shouldn’t these people know how to administer a shot?
22030,[removed]
22031,And when will it be available to us?
22032,I’ve had Bell’s palsy once and my face looked horrific.
22033,"Totally sagging, unable to move half my mouth or nose."
22034,"It did go away in 2 weeks, but I count it among the worst experience in my life."
22035,Don’t let anyone downplay it - it’s a horrific sight to look at your face all twisted and be unable to move it.
22036,"Great, another year of this bullshit...."
22037,"&gt; how they'll force it to happen

Nah, this is how they’ll force covid to stick around way longer that it would otherwise."
22038,While continually devastating the economy.
22039,"If people listened to the experts we could be living like South Koreans and Taiwanese, right now."
22040,“Normal” hahaha sure.
22041,"Sorry for my lack of geography, but what does SoCal include?"
22042,Does it include LA?
22043,I find conflicting info online.
22044,Edit: nevermind I opened the link and found the regional map there.
22045,This is accurate according to what I’ve heard.
22046,June seems like a realistic timeline to somewhat safely return to some normal things with social distancing still being policy.
22047,Got it!
22048,Thanks so much.
22049,Californian here.
22050,"I think while the government has done a relatively good job of passing social distancing rules, it has done a very poor job of explaining why these rules exist."
22051,It also doesn't help that the rules are often passed haphazardly with all kinds of corruption thrown in.
22052,So after 8 months of social distancing without the hospitals being overwhelmed many people kind of just forgot that the pandemic even exists and went back to their old way of life.
22053,It's also worth noting that insurance covers the flu shot at no copay because it's required under the Alternative Care Act.
22054,Insurance companies and corporations aren't just doing this out of the good of their hearts.
22055,"I can't figure out how to link in my phone, but here's a source from HHS:
https://www.hhs.gov/answers/affordable-care-act/will-the-aca-cover-my-flu-shot/index.html"
22056,"I guess that's fair, but a lot of covid restrictions don't apply to everyone."
22057,"Hospitals will probably be the last to drop their restrictions, but if you don't interact with hospitals you won't even notice."
22058,"Ah yeah, that's the other weird one"
22059,You didn’t read what they said
22060,Why even charge?
22061,Everything is a damn luxury.
22062,I swear the government would charge up the ass for drinking water if you gave them an inch.
22063,"""I got covid and it is the fault of ther other people who got covid""

Ironic"
22064,Ok.. that makes sense.. thanks for the clarification 👍
22065,Neither does the moderna or Oxford vaccine
22066,ye cuz the experts havent considered this.
22067,they should check reddit more often and ask experts with their elementary calculations around here.
22068,"and if u get a time-window announced somewhere, always expect the earliest possible."
22069,cuz thats exactly how everything in life works /s
22070,"Thanks again, Captain Obvious."
22071,Did that other person develop symptoms?
22072,"If so, they were not asymptomatic, they were presymptomatic."
22073,Ok I’m not arguing their point I’m just saying what it would be.
22074,I don’t agree with this.
22075,Can’t that be said about covid deaths themselves?
22076,"The current tallies represent deaths of people with covid, not deaths from covid."
22077,So by that same logic shouldn’t a death with the vaccine be counted as being caused by the vaccine?
22078,I eat Brie cheese all the time and haven't gotten COVID so it could be true.
22079,"And here i am, having hernia surgery a week from yesterday."
22080,My anxiety has never been higher.
22081,Different sryinges have different amounts of dead space.
22082,"So one design, more liquid is pulled from the vial, but after injection it's left in the sryinge and wasted."
22083,"So a vial has to contain extra, to account for these differences."
22084,You can also have some that might be spilled.
22085,And if you had exactly 5 doses you would probably be sucking up a bunch of air trying to get that last dose.
22086,"So buy design, you can't make it exact, and have to include extra."
22087,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_dead_space_syringe
22088,"Death per 100000:

Belgium: 159
Italy: 110
GB: 99
USA:93
Sweden: 75

Germany: 29

Denmark: 17

Australia: 4

For me it is obvious that geographical and socioeconomical factors influence these numbers."
22089,Even tho Sweden isn’t on the top of the List I think they had a chance to do way better in their particular context!
22090,I root for you Sweden and hope the numbers will get better very fast - even though I am afraid this will be a though winter!
22091,Great!
22092,Then don’t worry about the ones who choose not to get vaccinated!
22093,California is 38th in deaths per capita because of past restrictions.
22094,"Even after the current surge, it will more than likely still be doing much better than several states..."
22095,Last bit explains it quite well.
22096,[deleted]
22097,I don’t think anybody is being blamed for getting infected - just for not following precautions.
22098,All the precautions are just to decrease risk - nobody is really 100% safe.

22158,the baby boom is coming in Q2 2022. once all the single horny people who havent hugged another person in a gear get back out there its gonna get wild
22159,That's not exactly true but I think you might have incorrectly worded it.
22160,Not to put words in your mouth but I think you're trying to say if you DO get it from an antivaxxer your symptoms will be mostly nonexistent because your immune system will just kill covid.
22161,That's definitely true based on the data we have now.
22162,I mean these groups are going to continue to be anti-intellectual but the good news here is that we no longer need to depend on them being rational for us to survive - the vaccine is good enough.
22163,What IS concerning is what will happen to the families of people who are antivax because they don't deserve to due.
22164,My grandfather-in-law is probably dead due to flu complications.
22165,He and his family are anti-vax and he died while he had the flu because these idiots infected him.

22170,I'd actually say that local grocery stores deserve the vaccine sooner than Amazon.
22171,Because people can actually go to their local grocery store and pick things up themselves.

22190,It's your assumption people don't understand the nuanced difference.
22191,"I believe most do and realize ""Free"" is shorthand for the payment being from public coffers and not from immediate out of pocket payment."
22192,"Most people are familiar with the concept of ""no free lunch"" and realize that you are just trolling or have a limited understanding of conversational english."
22193,"I would agree ""people don't understand"", in general,  if you were talking about a slightly more advanced concept like inflation being a hidden tax that disproportionately erodes the purchasing power of the poor."
22194,"With a weak semantic argument on ""Free""
.. that's usually just lame trolling from poorly educated individuals that are repeating concepts and cliches they don't fully understand."
22195,"It won't help, I have antivaxxer family and they only believe what they read on Facebook or fox news."
22196,"Seriously, everything single other outlet is part of the anti trump conspiracy."
22197,I really don't know how we are going to move past this idiotic point as a nation.
22198,"In my state and zipcode, they won't be asking for papers other than cash or insurance (worst case, this should be covered by warp speed)."
22199,I think the need to vaccinate is more important than whether you jumped the border / overstayed your visa.
22200,"And since the harder hit populations will be in-line before me, looks like illegal aliens will get the jab before me."
22201,this article is off.
22202,"there will be a baby boom in 2022, with a birth rate much higher than the average of a pre pandemic year."
22203,people are pretty much gonna fuck willy nilly as soon as clubs and bars reopen.
22204,marriage rate will probably spike as people YOLO it up not wanting anything to be taken for granted anymore.
22205,sociologists are gonna have a field day with this time period
22206,Who knows...
22207,It's clearly in the public interest though so one would have to be a real dick to oppose such a thing
22208,Data center staff means people who have to physically be there.
22209,They're the ones making sure hardware gets swapped so 80% of the internet (AWS) keeps running.
22210,Programmers who can work from home aren't in the data center.
22211,"While I don't think those workers are as important as grocery store employees, I think they might be a step below, since they keep so much of the internet running."
22212,Right.
22213,So that leaves the government to make what changes it has control over.
22214,"If people would act responsibly and stop gathering, we could have more nice things."
22215,But they want to gather *and* not wear masks *and* have everything be open.
22216,It doesn't work like that.
22217,yes that is specifically an issue due to the US govt having a decades long history of forcibly conducting unethical medical experiments on prisoners and POC which lead to a forced moratorium on conducting research in correctional settings.
22218,some people used to think prisoners lack basic human rights it so it’s OK to use them as lab rats
22219,stop spreading lies!!
22220,"it absolutely is possible to catch it outdoors even with social distancing 

it's been scientifically proven that transmission can occur"
22221,"I think there's a very loud 50% of Californians who ""get it"" and are doing what they can to mitigate and another loud 50% that do not care or believe it's true."
22222,"Back in Feb/March people were more willing to ""shelter in place"" even the 50% who don't believe COVID exists, but now almost a year later, there is a sense of validation that they somehow have not been affected by COVID itself but suffer from the mitigation efforts because of loss in income or a business."
22223,"Meh, people gave birth to a lot of kids back when everyone thought we're on the verge of nuclear war."
22224,"People stopped having kids because life is too good, not because its too bad."
22225,Once Vulnerable are vaccinated deaths will crash.
22226,Why do we need herd immunity to be granted “normalcy”?
22227,"By law they're ""free"" (zero copay) through insurance."
22228,"Same as Canada, really, it's just that you guys make sure that everyone is insured."
22229,Reddit.
22230,"On the plus side, real estate is about to get real cheap"
22231,Part of the reason for the mixed messaging is that people aren't following advice.
22232,"It was fall *if* lockdowns happened and people wore masks, etc."
22233,"Instead, it's been full of half measures and people acting irresponsibly, and the facts have, therefore, changed."
22234,The other axis of mixed messaging is scientists largely saying one things and public officials not having the courage or ability to follow those guidelines (different depending on different levels and funding).
22235,Hard to blame that stuff on Fauci.
22236,Don't do it.
22237,"No way to tell who's vaccinated and who isn't (at a glance, anyway)."
22238,Mask mandates mean that even vaccinated people will need to continue to wear masks.
22239,"Those will eventually go away, but people need to have patience."
22240,Summer?
22241,People are pretending it’s back to normal RIGHT NOW lol
22242,Most people stopped caring when state restrictions were lifted.
22243,A vaccine will worsen the problem.
22244,Also curious what inoculation plans are for incarcerated populations.
22245,"If it changes literally daily though, he’s not providing any more info than a random.org script."
22246,I’m beginning to think I’m actually losing my mind.
22247,I don’t even know what’s real anymore.
22248,It just ads to the anxiety paralysis
22249,"Yeah, my sister gave birth this year and it was really scary there for a minute."
22250,Luckily everything went beautifully and everyone is happy and healthy 💗
22251,No proof???
22252,Uh 95% efficacy in preventing the disease.
22253,That’s what vaccines DO.
22254,That’s ALL they do.
22255,That’s what they are.
22256,That is the definition of a vaccine.
22257,That landlord is heartless.
22258,Exactly my point....
22259,I got $5 to get a flu shot at Target this year (US)
22260,They’re free where I am as well
22261,"Ugh, that sucks."
22262,I canceled my membership to 24 Hours in April and am so glad that I did.
22263,It reopened for 2 weeks in the summer before closing again.
22264,Los Angeles shut down outdoor dining and yet it's still the hotbed
22265,"I was done after 2, but after being cooped up with them for 9 months, no fucking way am I having another."
22266,HEY IT’S FOR THE CHILDREN!
22267,"Other than social norms, vaccine isn't 100% effective, it's like 90-95% effective, so you can get vaccinated and still get covid."
22268,I think something like 8 people out of the 40k trial vaccine people got covid.
22269,"Personally, after I get vaccinated, I'll wear a mask in public and then return to normal in my private life (hanging with family and friends inside and such)."
22270,There's a reason why republicans are pro-birth.
22271,"""Pre-born you're fine, pre-school you're fucked."""
22272,Lmao yes it’s straight from my personal experience this year
22273,[removed]
22274,If I’m vaccinated the wheels are falling off.
22275,I’m partying and going nuts!!
22276,I’m kidding.
22277,But also kind of not.
22278,"They don't know yet how long the immunity lasts, so far signs are that it is probably at least year if not longer."
22279,I think we'll know more in another 6-9 months about if it will become a yearly shot like the flu.
22280,"Yep, you whether pay for it in insurance premiums or by the shot at a pharmacy."
22281,There are sometimes free flu shot clinics at fairgrounds and stuff like that but it’s a long wait time and usually only for a day or two.
22282,No one said late February.
22283,They only said the vaccine will be more widely available then and it seems like that'll be the case.
22284,You're just looking for a reason not to listen to experts and that's messed up.
22285,[removed]
22286,&gt; “We try to call landlords and inform them that they’re violating the law  by illegally evicting people.
22287,"You can only be evicted by a court order  and with the sheriff present executing an eviction and right now that  can’t be done in St. Louis City and St. Louis County,” Swearingen said 

He's right about this being a common occurrence, and this case one of the few brought to light possibly because this landlord is rather on the mainstream map (the door victim said he had been a good landlord) and his action thus newsworthy."
22288,I love that movie.

22300,It changes so much that I am beginning to question the continuity and cause-effect nature of reality.
22301,It feels like a dream where everything jumps around
22302,"At present, the only people who ""do not qualify"" are children and potentially those having severe allergic reactions to certain things."
22303,Otherwise all adults fall under the emergency use authorization currently granted.
22304,I'm curious of why pregnant women are not in higher category?

22322,The virus is less of an issue in private gatherings when people don't get it elsewhere first.
22323,Allowing indoor dining means more people will bring the virus with them when they go visit someone.
22324,They hate anything that makes them look weak.
22325,Illegal.
22326,Legal shouldn't be an issue.
22327,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
22328,I can’t fucking wait.
22329,"Get vaccinated, you fucks"
22330,"Unfortunately, the timing of this surge sucks...California has been ""limited"" in one way or another since Feb/March 2020."
22331,"It was one of the first states to go full ""stay at home."""
22332,"The concept wasn't bad, and it worked."
22333,The problem was how durable COVID is and how relatively slow but exponential it grows.
22334,"California was ""ahead of the curve"" but completely let it's guard down after and then out of state travelers started adding to the mix and then the numbers slowly crept up again."
22335,"People have been in a limbo of ""not quite fully open""/""not quite fully closed"" and it's worn on them."
22336,"Now because of the shear duration it's gone on for, people can't go into a ""shelter in place."""
22337,The fact is many businesses cannot go a year (let a lone a few months) without in-person retail/dining and many people cannot go a few months (let a lone a month) without making an income.
22338,The financial responsibility (or lack there of) of people in the United States in general fails a lot of people especially in a pandemic like this.
22339,"How many people can ""afford"" a one time emergency costing $1000?"
22340,Now multiply that $1000 and people are getting desperate.
22341,"Of course, I don't necessarily blame people for the situations they are in entirely, but hopefully this changes peoples' attitudes and improves financial literacy."
22342,People are panicking because they've essentially lost a year of income and/or added a year of pure debt.
22343,"I completely sympathize with people who want to keep their resturants open, stores open, businesses open, etc."
22344,because they are really in a helpless situation.
22345,"Even if open, people are not spending the same way they did in non-COVID times."
22346,"I know online retail has exploded but a year in, these number swill start to look bleak."
22347,Where is this money that people can spend coming from if no one is working and no one is making money?
22348,These businesses that are fighting to stay open are in a tought spot; the pool of money they are trying to earn is not very big and certainly not big enough to help most businesses break even.
22349,Why are we showing praise on them for this?
22350,I mean I commend them for beating the virus the hard way; I truly do.
22351,But doesn’t the rest of the world have a greater need right now?
22352,?
22353,"Is 61,580 now, with 407 deaths"
22354,"I'm guessing this is the reason for that:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5811923 


""We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members' commitments to incentivize innovation,"" the communiqué reads."
22355,"""In this regard, we fully support all collaborative efforts, especially the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) initiative and its COVAX facility, and the voluntary licensing of intellectual property,"" the statement reads, referring to a COVID-19 vaccine project co-led by the World Health Organization and Gavi to ensure poorer countries have access to life-saving vaccines."
22356,"Canada has already made commitments to COVAX, which, all told, has secured hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine."""
22357,"""Canada is also a signatory to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, a program that allows eligible, developing countries to suspend official bilateral debt-service payments during the pandemic."
22358,The program frees up money for countries to purchase COVID-19 treatments and much-needed personal protective equipment or to support workers left unemployed.
22359,The G20 leaders agreed to extend this program to June 2021 and strongly encouraged private creditors to take part in the initiative on comparable terms.
22360,"The initiative has so far helped 46 of 73 eligible countries defer $5.7 billion in 2020 debt-service payments."""
22361,That'll be what further research will focus on.
22362,Too early to fully tell right know if we will need booster shots or not.
22363,I'd say yearly booster shots is a bit unlikely but not impossible
22364,That’s a MAJOR plus!!
22365,I just meant that for me personally I wouldn’t be able to handle it.
22366,"I struggle with major health anxiety, and I can barely handle this pandemic as it is."
22367,My username is straight from my personal experience lol.
22368,I wish you and your sweet baby all the best 💗
22369,It is indeed!
22370,There are so many people that wouldn’t be able to afford it if the vaccine is not free.
22371,Mid fall?
22372,Man I was hoping by July or something
22373,I am so glad everything went well for your sister!
22374,"I know a couple of women who gave birth in April, towards the beginning of the pandemic and thankfully they were OK too, but I know it was *massively* stressful."
22375,"At that time, there was a chance they'd have to give birth alone, which I can't imagine."
22376,"&gt;	People stopped having kids because life is too good

Lmao that couldn’t be further from the truth."
22377,People stopped having kids because they’re fucking expensive and people can barely make ends meet as it is.
22378,Frontline workers and the most vulnerable don't HAVE to get the shots.
22379,"That means they will have to be convinced, over time, that it's safe"
22380,[removed]
22381,Yes considering the efficacy rate is 95% but only 10%ish reported side effects beyond sore arm
22382,"Here in MN I go to Target, get a flu vaccine, and they hand me a $5 gift certificate."
22383,Done.
22384,I’m in florida and it’s really hard to get a test here.
22385,I thought the walmart deal was nationwide so I figured if we didn’t have it here it wouldn’t be anywhere else
22386,So you are saying America will be in lockdown for the next 5 yrs.
22387,got it.
22388,"No, if you have an insurance then it’s free."
22389,If you don’t then you need to pay for it.
22390,"His statements and how it hits
Your social media feed are disconnected."
22391,He hasn’t wavered in how he makes statements and estimates timelines.
22392,But now he’s part of the Biden team so the slant is against him.
22393,The virus is gonna disappear by April.
22394,"We're not sure which April yet, but eventually it will probably be true."
22395,[removed]
22396,Getting Alex Jones to vaccinate publically may actually be beneficial.
22397,"Or, and maybe I'm talking out of my ass here, but maybe we can just listen to what people with advanced degrees and decades of experience are telling us to do even if it changes?"
22398,Just throwing that out there.
22399,lmao wtf TIL
22400,America will never return to normal.
22401,Half of America doesn't even think it exists.
22402,America is dumbed down beyond recognition
22403,WTF are you people doing out there?
22404,Is the entire state now a giant rave?
22405,WHERE'S MY INVITE?
22406,I know.
22407,He says a different date everyday.
22408,"Once the vaccine becomes widely available to every American, which will be sooner than mid-Fall, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't go back to normal right then and there."
22409,Thirteen months too late my guy.
22410,"My numbers kept coming out to 500k-600k and I kept saying ""100k"" in public because that just seemed so insane."
22411,Egg on my face I guess.
22412,"Haha I’ve never had that for a vaccine here in US, can’t imagine why."
22413,I do have a medication I receive by infusion where the first few doses I had to take benadryl in advance and a nurse was watching me like a hawk for the entire two hours.
22414,People are trying to kill with lies.
22415,"I'm in Phoenix AZ area, and we had drive thru testing at our local walmart."
22416,"We had to make an appt online, then showed up and they instructed us via whiteboard signs."
22417,Got results 48 hrs later.
22418,Where are you located?
22419,...and the sock puppet accounts turn on a dime.
22420,I've been saving all my sperms to help out when the partying begins.
22421,"Every union in the country took a paycut, but police."
22422,Police are the only ones redicuously overpaid to begin with.
22423,That last bit also explains the pedophile rate in the republicans.
22424,I understand the math.
22425,If that were true the rate of death in Orange County wouldn’t be so much lower than Los Angeles.
22426,That begs the question of what was realistically preventable.
22427,"I’ve often wished that the people who want a serious strict lockdown would get their wish, just so they’d realize that would mean all their Netflix, YouTube, online gaming and shopping would go away."
22428,There are a lot of people physically going to work every day just to allow others to sit home all day arguing about covid on the internet.
22429,What’s cooler than being cool?
22430,How many times do we need to see cases drop faster or climb slower in areas with mask mandates before you accept the obvious correlation?
22431,Asian Countries with strong masking culture faired better in the early stages.
22432,European countries that adopted masks earlier gained control over transmission sooner in the spring.
22433,American states with mask mandates and strong compliance are fairing better than those without.
22434,Now we have evidence that counties within states with Mask mandates saw a greater decline in covid cases.
22435,Do you need  the data from neighbourhoods within cities?
22436,If we go any smaller than that we be introducing a whole host of problems.
22437,I think there is a lot of confusion right now about the conferred immunity of the vaccine.
22438,"They don't know if the vaccine confers sterilizing immunity or not: the data suggests that its possible its not fully sterilizing immunity (meaning the immune response might not stop the infection, just aspects of the symptoms)."
22439,As such people (both Redditors and journalists) are basically making assumptions about the nature of the effects of the vaccine.
22440,"Right now we cannot assume it will completely stop the spread, but really we don't know."
22441,"There were so few cases of the virus in the vaccine arms, its really hard to draw any real conclusions."
22442,"Additionally this virus has weird behaviors, the level of pre-symptomatic spread is fairly unusual and we still do not have a good understanding of why some people spread it significantly more than others."
22443,Oh fuck right.
22444,Sorry.
22445,[deleted]
22446,I’ve seen anywhere from March to October.
22447,The fact is once the elderly and healthcare workers get the vaccine and people see deaths under 500 a day people will say to hell with it and live normal again.
22448,I give it til the end of March.
22449,Just the flu bro
22450,[deleted]
22451,So we re not returning to normal then....
22452,It's not that odd for out in rural areas.
22453,"They are both much older than average (dad is 77), and have fallen prey to the Republican propaganda machine."
22454,"It's really frustrating, because on one hand, they have been spoonfed bullshit their entire lives."
22455,"On the other hand, they refuse statistics and won't listen to hard numbers, so, like, damnit."
22456,Y'all could have hard lockdowned properly at the start and then been fine.
22457,"Damn, cinco de mayo is really going to be lit."
22458,Google-fu says various kinds of inflammation in the brain and spine.
22459,"Mostly temporary and treatable but pretty scary, and in a few cases resulted in fatal complications."
22460,"I genuinely hate to say this, because I respect the guy, but I think Fauci needs to shut the fuck up and stop talking to the media for a while, at the very least."
22461,"He’s given so many different answers as to when things could “go back to normal” in the last 2-3 weeks, apparently today saying it could be next fall, after having said mid spring a week or so ago."
22462,He is not helping public health messaging by being this inconsistent.
22463,He desperately needs to stop answering that question if he doesn’t feel like he actually knows when it’ll be.
22464,&gt;Gosh!
22465,What is going on in LA?!
22466,American are mostly hedonistic denegerates and California is chock full of them.
22467,Other example is is Florida.
22468,i wouldn't count every one as 40% overfilled.
22469,how many prisoners got sick and suffered irreversible damage to their heart and lungs?
22470,how much more money does the state pay caring for prisoners who got sick?
22471,how many now recovered prisoners will need to be on state assistance because of lasting damage done to their bodies?
22472,preventive care is much much cheaper than a ventilator.
22473,"From:  https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html

&gt;The percent positive will be high if the number of positive tests is too high, or if the number of total tests is too low."
22474,A higher percent positive suggests higher transmission and that there are likely more people with coronavirus in the community who haven’t been tested yet.
22475,&gt;The percent positive is a critical measure because it gives us an indication how widespread infection is in the area where the testing is occurring—and whether levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission.
22476,"In other words, they are missing cases."
22477,It's really as simple as that.
22478,Right - my first thought was aligned with /u/chemomechanics but then I had a thought similar to yours.
22479,"This would be weird, but these lipid nanoparticle platforms are known to be quite touchy."
22480,It's possible that cycling temperature (going from frozen to ultra-frozen and back again) has a negative impact.
22481,You talk about Darwinism but fail to realize Darwinism doesn’t select after puberty.
22482,You sounded smart though.
22483,So that’s something
22484,Reported for misinformation.
22485,"That makes no sense, the vaccines do not show high efficacy for preventing infection."
22486,They prevent disease.
22487,"Im just up the road on the border of OC and LAC and ffs the ""outdoor"" accomodations in OC are a joke for some places, there is a bar a couple blocks from me, at least 50-100 people in there every night, &lt; 50 % mask wearage."
22488,"It makes me feel like my efforts are wasted, which they are for helping the greater community, so in the end I just do it for myself, it feels like you are making a statement when you wear a mask outside of a grocery store/restauarant here, its a joke and very frustrating

These restauarants/bars would be losing my business if I went to them too, I feel terrible for small business owners, but if you are going to open please do everything you can to be reasonable, not giving a fuck is unacceptable"
22489,pompeo is pure evil
22490,Yup.
22491,"I don't necessarily think the methods of dealing with the virus in California were out of place, it was unfortunately the timing of it."
22492,Everyone played into doubling down hard back in Feb/March and it worked really well.
22493,"Things got loosened up in June/July but not completely re-opened and people got complacent; many people still did not have jobs to go to, were not getting a full salary, or businesses were not grossing enough to even break even with expenses."
22494,"Almost a year later, it's not unbelievable that people are not into the mitigation efforts so much anymore."
22495,"In retrospect, it all comes down to testing."
22496,"I think between June/July and Sept/Oct, there was a false sense of security and testing went down and mitigation efforts were taken more lightly."
22497,People were still hurting financially throughout this time and almost a year of lost income and/or adding a year of debt has people in pretty tough spots.
22498,Most people were short-sighted as to how durable and long lasting this COVID pandemic would be.
22499,Even more people probably couldn't afford a month of pandemic to begin with.
22500,"Now there's a desperation to ""get on with it"" even though COVID is at its worst point."
22501,&gt; huh?
22502,"I have no doubt they are experts but given that, why give them 40% extra?"
22503,"could it be more ""purposeful"" in another viral headed towards someone else's veins?"
22504,"this isn't uncommon in many things, not just vaccines."
22505,"You often get a little extra when you buy something, b.c they don't want to sell you too little."
22506,"But when you are talking about 5ml, you just don't really notice it."
22507,My wife thinks all vaccines can cause autism “because it happened to her cousin”.
22508,She’s a liberal.
22509,I’ve given her entire spreadsheets of analytic analysis and you may as well be arguing about religion.
22510,It’s fucking hopeless with these people.
22511,"$10 at Publix, haaa sucker."
22512,Pub sub party at our house.
22513,Is the Oxford vaccine the single dose one?
22514,"Knowing what we know about covid, and knowing a lot about vaccines and the history of vaccines."
22515,I’m confused.
22516,"Is your problem that you think he should lie and say he thinks we can go back to normal by May, just because “probably” people will do so even if they shouldn’t?"
22517,"Don’t you think it’s useful to know that the experts think X and then you can make an informed decision to do Y instead, rather than falsely being told Y and believing it?"
22518,"They do that 15min wait here in Australia for our annual free flu shot at work, just to make sure you're all good."
22519,"If people were in this together,  they would be energized to stick it out."
22520,They would find creative ways to be together online or being thoughtful by sending food or gifts or crafts.
22521,There would be services to promote our well being.
22522,Instead people have been fed hate.
22523,Of course they're burnt out from it.
22524,Yeah that is insane.
22525,They truly do not give a damn.
22526,"I know some will bring up that it has a large population and whatever the hell, but still this is just crazy."
22527,I’ve been thinking lately that for many of us our weeks are starting to look like what people must have experienced in pre-industrial revolution times.
22528,"We’re pretty much home all the time, one day bleeds into the next, and if it weren’t for the meeting I had today at 3, I wouldn’t have known what day it was."
22529,Los Angeles has two COVID deaths an hour
22530,[removed]
22531,Serious question: When can I stop hearing about this on repeat?
22532,"Its been a month, can we move on?"
22533,We all know about it and we all think less of him for it.
22534,I have an 8 month old.
22535,What do we do?
22536,Do the parents get vaccinated and just continue to stay away from others until we reach such low numbers it isn’t too big of a concern?
22537,Too many people don’t understand how this works and expect Fauci to be a damn psychic instead of what he really is: a manager of a department of hundreds of employees doing their best everyday to brief him on new developments and better estimates.
22538,It’s like bitching at the head of Boeing because he or she doesn’t have a perfect aircraft design on day one of development.
22539,"Complicated things take time to figure out, and timelines change."
22540,Not to mention the speed of vaccine production is completely outside Fauci’s control since the vaccines are coming from the private sector...
22541,Felt like nothing honestly.
22542,But it’s only stored at that temperature.
22543,It’s injected barely cold.
22544,"That's an awfully big ""if"" to account for a whole lot of stupid people."
22545,I can't help but see this objectively good thing from an entirely cynical perspective.
22546,"I'm sitting here thinking, ""Well *of course* they will vaccinate them first... you can't *fail to support* someone if they're dead!"""
22547,My sister was a music teacher in the OKC metro.
22548,Teachers are angels; teachers in OK are like... demigods or something.
22549,This country will never be the same after this..
22550,"&gt; yet some people in this sub care more about the economy or ""pandemic fatigue"" than focusing on what needed/needs to be done to shut this crap down."
22551,Mocking the idea of pandemic fatigue is a great way to get people to ignore you or worse.
22552,This rhetoric *increases* covid spread.
22553,Not a bad idea.
22554,because our leaders were caught dining at French Laundry and sending their kids to private school while telling every one else to stay home
22555,"I tested positive on Monday, and it makes me want to spit in the mouth of those people"
22556,This.
22557,"Redditors in this subforum will likely still be locked in their basements, but the rest of the world will have carried on living their lives."
22558,If you’re a Californian you can keep telling yourself that.
22559,Makes it easier to stomach the lives ruined with shutdowns while other states largely stayed open with similar or better results.
22560,3.3% is huge and a disaster
22561,"I hope so, so much."
22562,"Respectfully, I disagree that telling someone to calm down is uncivil when they themselves said they were ""so scared"" because they were unaware that hospitals deal with overflow fairly often."
22563,&gt; Are we seriously going to sit here and say who deserves to live or die?
22564,"Yes, that is literally how healthcare has always work for all of time."
22565,I just want the Bill Gates microchip but if it comes with the vaccine then I guess that's a bonus.
22566,Please I miss my friends so much
22567,"a quarter of this count is from over the weekend

and this is one of the few states striving to accurately report their tallies"
22568,"Not to mention in the beginning when he said “Masks don’t work,” then later admitted that he lied about that to keep people from buying up all the masks away from healthcare workers."
22569,"I see his intentions, but it’s honestly pretty fucked up and what led to a lot of people thinking they’re ineffective, in addition to the president’s ramblings."
22570,"Interesting read,and very straight forward, and sadly the surge is happening all across the globe."
22571,Mid fall seems like so far but better than nothing
22572,And yet somehow we do know with absolutely certainty that there's no long term ill effects from the vaccine..
22573,"Per the projections seems like there’s no great mystery about how this all goes down from here on out, at least in the US, now that we know the stats on vaccinations."
22574,"We have the January From Hell where we have a Battle of Antietam every week and hospitals are full to bursting and we all pay the consequences for the assholes who won’t wear masks, and a hell of a lot of us spend next Christmas missing loved ones for no reason."
22575,Then once vaxx immunity kicks in amongst vulnerable populations the numbers start to drop hard in February and by March we’re on a (long) road out of the nightmare.
22576,But it didn’t have to be like this man.
22577,Wear your damn masks
22578,No.
22579,We’re not going to say “fuck you” to countries who have been responsible with handling the virus.
22580,[deleted]
22581,we're almost out of ICU beds... testing doesn't mean shit
22582,"So, just a year after 9?months of ‘teo more weeks’?"
22583,Anyone with a functioning brain cell knew this would be the case.
22584,"Expect to shut the hell up, lol."
22585,This is from the article btw
22586,"You outed yourself with your antifa bullshit my man, nobody’s falling for your “objective” act"
22587,"Yes, lack of testing and younger populations (because the older ones are dead already)."
22588,"California knows how to party \~\~\~ California, Knows how to party\~\~\~"
22589,I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.
22590,Thank you.
22591,Choice.
22592,Garen’s head??
22593,THAT’S what’s happening.
22594,"It's possible that you could have had the vaccine, but still get Covid; you can be asymptomatic and spread it to others."
22595,It's also two doses taken two or three weeks apart and it's about a month from the first dose until you'll actually have immunity.
22596,It should only be considered safe to do whatever the fuck you want once *everyone* has had the chance to be vaccinated.
22597,We're all tired of this.
22598,"We just need to hang in there a little bit longer, or we're just going to keep prolonging it."
22599,I don’t have herd immunity by summer 2021.
22600,"&gt;wildly optimistic and said COVID would be gone by Easter of this year

That's a weird way to write ""a liar."""
22601,The COVID vaccine will be free.
22602,This isn’t up for debate at this point.
22603,"I suppose it's a ""good"" thing that the people that will refuse the vaccine are those same people."
22604,That will mean we actually have a higher immunity rate than we otherwise would.
22605,Still figuring it out?
22606,This sums up why nobody should be taking this booster shot in mass.
22607,It's so untested.
22608,You literally said this with no irony huh.
22609,Unreal people will put something in their body without knowing what it will do.
22610,I'm sorry you are an evil fascist.
22611,Limiting freedom of movement is very difficult with the current constitutional set up.
22612,There is no emergency laws outside of war.
22613,The commission that investigated the corona response actually was critical of the length of the elderly home visiting ban because it violated the residents right to freedom of association.
22614,"I also don't think the economy is a big factor, rather avoiding the negative health side effects of more extreme interventions was used as a justification."
22615,One thing I think Sweden did well is to avoid widespread school closures as much as possible.
22616,"School closures are going to be awful for educational outcome of marginalized kids, but those effects won't be seen in the short term."
22617,i think a big chunk of that was a data backlog from LA County.
22618,they're at about 85 per 100k right now so they could still see a few more weeks of growth though.
22619,for whatever reason states seem to be hitting their ceilings in that 100-125 range
22620,"Define ""normal""."
22621,"Everyone knowing someone in their family or close friends who have lost their life, or job, or crippled health and financially for the next decade?"
22622,[they're lying](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/07/americas/venezuela-hospitals-covid-caracas-intl/index.html).
22623,"even then, uruguay is still doing better, with much more credible numbers"
22624,lawyer - be suspicious about the ***laws***.
22625,doctor - ***scientific/medical*** process is transparent and open.
22626,both can be true.
22627,"Not really—usually, unless it’s a county health center—it’s free with most insurance plans., $20-$30 without."
22628,"Remember back in March when it was ""2 weeks to slow the spread?"""
22629,"Well here we are 9 *months* later, and Bill Gates is telling us we'll be locked down until 2022."
22630,"Sorry but I'm going back to normal 2 weeks after I get the vaccine (apparently that's the amount of time it takes to fully take effect, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong and I'll adjust accordingly)."
22631,I see no reason to adhere to any kind of mask mandate or quarantine once I've been vaccinated.
22632,Uh...do you not know about vaccines?
22633,Storage and application issues that cause death and disability?
22634,Vaccines are awesome.
22635,Fantastic.
22636,Good.
22637,Yup.
22638,"Now, let's be reasonable...can you do that?"
22639,Can you be reasonable?
22640,Let's pretend you can.
22641,"Vaccines, like all medications [damn near all] are only tasted on males."
22642,AND STOP.
22643,Males are less than 50% of the population.
22644,Globally.
22645,I will pause here.
22646,"You may now scramble to try to justify that and explain how it is ""totally okay bro."""
22647,[It is not.]
22648,That's the first stone on your path.
22649,Acknowledge the facts.
22650,Address it.
22651,Then we will have a conversation.
22652,"I am not willing to further engage with anyone who is unreasonable, illogical, or overly emotional: as your comment demonstrates that you are."
22653,Much respect for this man and what he is currently doing.
22654,But this does contradict the “long Covid” cases.
22655,There’s going to be am absolute ton of people with long-term issues in 2021 from having Covid in the past.
22656,"I do not see a “normal” fall or sadly even life, for millions who had COVID, unfortunately."
22657,"Would love to be wrong, but the data stream that’s now flowing on long-term issues that come up months after recovery in a % of cases (no solid number yet, 2-80% of cases, some say 25%, we will see soon) is more horrifying to me than Covid itself."
22658,"It literally says in the post that these factors are accounted for, healthy, not overweight people with Down syndrome are 10 times more likely to die from COVID than healthy non Down syndrome people

&gt; the extraordinary risk they found emerged even after they corrected for many other factors including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and living in a group home"
22659,I've been trying to do this but failing!
22660,How did you guys accomplish it?
22661,"Well, Now that just convince more people to just ""keep doing what you're doing, because we are going back to normal anyway."""
22662,"Message like this would only loosen people's guard on the guideline, because ""Things were almost sooo bad."""
22663,"now it's ""no worry, things would go back to normal at xx month in 2021""

&amp;#x200B;

Maskless people: ""ha, guess what we are doing dont matter."""
22664,[removed]
22665,Is it out of line to suggest deniers and anti-vaxxers should not get the vaccine?
22666,"&gt; troll propaganda

What about it is trolly?"
22667,That African Americans have been harder hit by Covid than whites?
22668,Because that's supported by fact.
22669,"As far as my user name goes, it's a reference to Rudolph Rocker."
22670,Which I guess you can look up if you want.

22672,Did you read the article?
22673,"It specifically says that the risk is much higher even taking into account things like obesity, heart disease, and other medical issues that are more prevalent with Down Syndrome."
22674,"Hey, if you're here to say that universal healthcare is a public health &amp; human rights issue, I'm here for that."
22675,I just don't think it's a good idea to start arguing against a shutdown during a raging pandemic.
22676,"The solution is universal access to mental health services, not to simply give up &amp; allow our people to be killed by the pandemic without trying to stop it or slow it down."
22677,Oh shit!
22678,Today's my cake day!
22679,This is true.

22710,Oh yeah I was nowhere near hospitalized.
22711,I just got put in quarantine on campus and it was barely a cold for me.
22712,I listened to a podcast and Dr. Drew came on and he's a big fan of Dr. Fauci and worked with him to address AIDS/HIV prior to this crisis and said that it's his way of handling these things to be overly cautious.
22713,"He talked about how the sex ed in schools taught that having sex with someone is equivalent to having sex with everyone they've been with too to prevent STDs and that he's gonna get the U.S. through this better than anyone, but he also always assumes worst case scenario."

22771,3 layer fabric masks are a lot better than nothing and surgical masks that aren't 95 aren't perfect either.
22772,Plus it more protects you from spreading to others so don't think you are protected from the maskless person walking past you.

22800,Part of me thinks we're still going to deal with partial shutdowns and mask orders for a while.
22801,I think it was hypothesized that if 75% of Americans get the vaccine then the pandemic will get reigned in?
22802,"If that's the case, logistically it's a long way out and we might get *lucky* to get that many Americans to agree to her vaccinations, even if it's done for free."

22806,There’s two other vaccines coming on to the market soon which use completely different methods so unlikely to cause this reaction.
22807,Science and religion are not mutually exclusive
22808,"Once they have the vaccine, why is it a problem?"
22809,The government also took in account the risk of some of these vaccines may end up failing their stage 3 trial and can't actually be used.
22810,I don't understand their viewpoint.
22811,The fetus has already been aborted.
22812,It's not like they have a fetus harvesting operation to fuel stem cell research.
22813,Yay the new New York.
22814,New Is always better.
22815,I actually could totally see this.
22816,Doctors/nurses using the excess to vaccinate friends and family instead of following the queue.
22817,&gt; This is why the nation is going to crap.
22818,"Nobody can be assed to get of their precious social media - Reddit, FaceBook, whatever - and go do some research about how things are really working."
22819,"No, it's going to hell because people spew garbage all the time and take people's words as the truth, even when it's often all made up and total horseshit."
22820,"So I'm going to question everything, especially when it sounds dodgy and the person saying it repeatedly says ""look it up"" instead of giving a link."
22821,PEGs?
22822,Not everyone lives a privileged life like you dude.
22823,Some people can barely make ends meet right now.
22824,Good for you that you like a virtual life.
22825,Not everyone does.
22826,"If want to live your life behind a screen that’s your choice, others prefer human interaction :/"
22827,"Yes, Tin foil."
22828,It's one thing to point out the right and left media attacking each other.
22829,But this is health issue.
22830,Non-political in nature.
22831,"If FOX, NBC, and CNN, all tell you to get vaccinated are you really going to tilt your tin foil hat and say ""But the media is bias!"""
22832,You poor poor man.
22833,unless the ED shit is true.
22834,This isn't surprising given people with Down Syndrome are commonly known to have heart issues.
22835,What more would you want him to do?
22836,"He probably—rightfully— feels that contradicting Trump will get him fired and replaced with a toadie—which is totally reasonable given that’s what Trump does over and over, and that in the end it’s better for him to do what he can than for him to be replaced by someone who says COVID isn’t a big deal and you won’t hear about it after the election."
22837,Same with resigning—he would be replaced by someone less competent and more loyal.
22838,Thank god Trump will be gone in under a month.
22839,"&gt;“The process that this vaccine was used to be developed was transparent and worthy of trust,” he said

So then why is the prospect of hackers gaining access to information about the vaccine such a big deal?"
22840,&gt; As soon as the vulnerable and elderly are vaccinated and the death toll plummets I’m done.
22841,"But ""as soon as"" will take a long ass time is what everybody's saying."
22842,"The only difference is you're complaining about the pandemic, and I'm just deciding to not be a brat about the fact that it will take a long time."
22843,"I would have gone on a month-long tour playing bass with my best friends' band in July, playing dozens of shows in many cities across United States and Canada."
22844,That got cancelled.
22845,"My social life got cancelled, too."
22846,I haven't had a gig since March.
22847,"For the past several years, I've probably had at least 30 music gigs a year."
22848,"Last time this year, I was doing Christmas shows and preparing for a sold out New Year's Eve event."
22849,Don't try to make an argument about how much cooler you are than me for how social you have to be to find meaning in life.
22850,It will probably be more or less normal by summer
22851,The county has been stripped of its powers.
22852,What the fuck does that even mean?
22853,How can you say they aren’t factoring that in?
22854,"Sure, scientists dealing with a certain non-social aspect of the virus aren’t factoring that in, but how can you say that e.g."
22855,epidemiologists aren’t considering social and psychological factors?
22856,Aside from the fact that Fauci says “we could return to normal by fall IF most people get the vaccine”.
22857,"So he is trying to encourage people to get the vaccine, and he is giving an estimate that is conditional on what people actually do."
22858,He is saying that the distribution is such that we are able to meet a certain timeframe but people have to actually get the vaccine.
22859,So your criticism doesn’t really seem valid to me at all.
22860,"I also don’t see why he shouldn’t say anything when we are at a moment where many politicians are actively spreading disinformation, including the president."
22861,This is caused by narcissistic jackholes that think that since it's not affecting them it can't affect anyone else.
22862,Los Angeles is a HAVEN for these types of people.
22863,Making the curve go straight up doesn’t count as flattening.
22864,"My understanding is that the ""rush"" to get the vaccine out didn't mean that there's less certainly about the vaccine being safe or effective, it means we only know it's effective in the exact circumstances it's tested."
22865,"So we don't have any guarantees that, for example if the timing of the second dose is off, it will work."
22866,"It probably will, but there's no guarantee so we can't tell people there is."
22867,Likewise for pregnant women or people with severe allergies.
22868,And we have interstates.
22869,One of the reasons the interstates were built was to get the military trucks and equipment to any given place in the US quickly in case of war.
22870,This isn’t much different for emergency distribution of a vaccine.
22871,"We're on track for 500,000 in a year."
22872,"You're right, if we can cut it by 92% yearly deaths, things can return to normal."
22873,I live in the south.
22874,Everything is normal here.
22875,Get it delivered.
22876,My wife and I next go to the store anymore.
22877,Iowan here - Gyms are still closed places?
22878,"Normal minus a half million extra dead people, plus some new and interesting health problems and widespread mental/emotional trauma and proverty."
22879,So not quite normal unless you are lucky.
22880,The bad thing is that the virus can keep mutating within those whodon't take the vaccine so it can turn into a form that can infect those with the vaccine again.
22881,"A coordinated vaccination could possibly kill the virus in once sweep, but if it keeps mutating it could return again and again and could become more dangerous."
22882,We need everyone to take the vaccine so that we can reach herd immunity and potentially stop the virus for good.
22883,"J&amp;J is based off different technology, though; Pfizer and Moderna are the first mRNA vaccines and they're being very careful about production and safety because they don't want to scare people off of an *extremely* promising way of making vaccines."
22884,"If I'm recalling my vaccines correctly, I believe J&amp;J's vaccines is also predicated on a single shot, not two different shots spaced weeks apart."
22885,"If it works, J&amp;J's vaccine will be great for people who might not be able to get two shots, and for more rural or scattered populations where either transporting and storing the vaccine is difficult, or where there aren't enough people to justify sending out a whole box of vaccines."
22886,[removed]
22887,Absolutely the situation.
22888,Might lose healthcare too if you’re not privately insured.
22889,He is the exact reason no one has seen any funds since the first package.
22890,Solely him alone.
22891,There was a mink covid outbreak in Denmark.
22892,They determined the vaccine was still effective in preventing the spread of mink covid
22893,Yup.
22894,I’m a 28 y/o male and not a single one of my friends takes this seriously.
22895,They all think it’s real but it’s not a big deal.
22896,Really fuckin crazy and makes me think we deserve to get wiped off of the face of this beautiful earth.
22897,Yes.
22898,"Well for one, we’ve heard that Florida has manipulated its numbers."
22899,Tough to take anything away given that.
22900,No shit.
22901,"Everything's open and has been open for months, except for international tourism."
22902,They barely had deaths and hospitalizations.
22903,Their healthcare system was never overwhelmed and surgeries don't need to be postponed.
22904,"The have relatively few long haulers, meaning very few Covid related disabilities and medical appointments."
22905,People feel safe so they aren't afraid to go out and spend $$$.
22906,People are not afraid to go back to work because it's actually safe.
22907,Older and immunocompromised people can actually work and go out.
22908,People are working so they can actually afford to travel domestically.
22909,"This basically the opposite of the shit show we have happening here in North America, so yeah, our economy is suffering and will continue to suffer until we do what needs to be done to get this shit under control."
22910,"People throughout all of history, from every country, creed, and religion have been killing, taking, and exploiting others from the dawn of time, America is no different, nor is any other nation, anywhere, ever."
22911,I want to go back to normal where normal means tons of socializing and going out to public events.
22912,"Wearing masks when sick and not going into work would be great and not a big deal at all for me, it would be nice to see people jump on board"
22913,"Yeah, and people were also very emphatic that there wouldn’t be anymore lockdowns after the first one."
22914,"Unless you’re in charge of your municipality, it’s not up to you how fast normal comes."
22915,"I think he means ""normal"" as in not needing to wear a mask, open up everything at 100% capacity, and end all social distancing."
22916,The economic impacts of the virus will be felt for years to come.
22917,"so its possible (and likely if the Republicans win the runoff election) we wont get any more help like unemployment, stimulus checks, etc."
22918,?
22919,This is not the way the immune system works.
22920,Not true.
22921,He still wants us to wear masks and social distance even if you take the vaccine.
22922,That’s not normal societal conditions and you all know it.
22923,Google: dr fauci still need to wear mask after vaccine
22924,"This is what George Gao, the head of the Chinese CDC, had to say about masks."
22925,"""The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks."
22926,This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact.
22927,"Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth."
22928,Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections.
22929,"If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."""
22930,"It needs to be noted that requiring mask usage is a cheap and effective strategy which is easily complied with, so there's really no excuse for western countries on that score."
22931,"Those words from Professor Gao were from March by the way, so people have had ample time to pay attention."
22932,"Excuse me, assuming that 50% of a country all thinks the same thing is ridiculous."
22933,"It just depends on how the rollout goes and how many people are vaccinated by whenever, right?"
22934,Nice
22935,At the end of the day he’s said his estimates are conservative.
22936,He already said we could hit herd immunity by end of spring.
22937,I think that’s when we’ll be normal
22938,You mean illegals
22939,I think enough people will get the vaccine to make this a reality.
22940,I know there's a lot of people who either won't get it or still believe covid is a hoax (smh) but I'd like to believe the majority want the vaccine.
22941,"That too, also, the US could isolate states aside from the most essential travel such as trucks transporting goods and other exceptions deemed necessary and work on lockdowns, I'm not sure if the public would take it."
22942,This shit isn't funny anymore.
22943,This comment right here
22944,Still people not wearing masks in my area.
22945,I dont get it
22946,Gotta keep labor cheap after all.
22947,"It is up, we are now at an all time high in cases and deaths."
22948,There are so many cases here now even kindergarten are closed and we are doing remote learning.
22949,"Yeah, that’s worded a bit better."
22950,[removed]
22951,I guess my kids' summer project will be digging a hole to China in the back yard cuz I got nothing else to entertain them.
22952,We'll make it work.
22953,[deleted]
22954,"Yeah how dare someone acknowledge reality, amirite?"
22955,I guess they don’t believe in contraception?
22956,"Says you, I’m living my life, fulfilling my dream and couldn’t be happier."
22957,"It’s not even patriotism, just realism, it’s not perfect here but I’ve got everything I need here and have made myself successful."
22958,Yes this is extremely likely.
22959,The elicited immune response will be strong and prevent viral duplication thus no viral shedding.
22960,My title is kind of shit to be honest.
22961,Visiting a GP here actually cost you money.
22962,Normal.
22963,What is normal?
22964,I'm not sure what that even means anymore.
22965,I just know I don't want to go back the way it was.
22966,"No health insurance, no employee protections, working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet because what they'll pay an hour won't cut it."
22967,And when you finally do emotionally breakdown due to overwhelming exhaustion bordering on a heart attack you get called lazy for taking a day off.
22968,Fuck that.
22969,"I'm tired, burned out and I don't even work in one of the industries that is considered essential and I just can't do it anymore."
22970,Thank you to everyone who takes this seriously and is doing their best to make it through the day.
22971,"The same half of ""people"" would never take a vaccine either."
22972,"Yeah, the state is experiencing an outbreak on the level of France in October right now."
22973,I expect daily deaths to be near or even above 1000 a day for a period.
22974,"Especially considering that unlike NY in the spring, the states near California are suffering massively themselves and can't spare medical resources like much of the country did for NY."
22975,&gt; by April or May at the latest.
22976,That isn't really true though.
22977,"It will be _available_ to the _first_ recipients, but we have not had a clear answer yet when the _last_ shots will be available (ie, the US needs its 650 millionth shot)."
22978,What do people stand to gain from literally leading us to more deaths by misinforming the gullible?
22979,&gt;if they continue at this pace they will blow past Florida’s death and cases per capita very soon.
22980,So what you're saying is that the above commentor is absolutely correct when they say that case and death rates have been and are currently higher in Florida than in California.
22981,I can not believe how fast they are getting on this...
22982,Impressive.
22983,[removed]
22984,Why should we care about them?
22985,Why should we let them hold the rest of us back from returning to normal?
22986,"If it means the virus continues to spread through the population that willing didn't get vaccinated, why shouldn't we go back to normal and let the idiots die?"
22987,"I don't see this happening, too many people have guzzled Trump's ""COVID IS A HOAX TO OUST GOD-EMPEROR TRUMP FROM OFFICE"" mouth diarrhea."
22988,That’s illegal.
22989,"If all americans get it, someone will be become very rich"
22990,So 3 people out of what?
22991,"200,000 so far?"
22992,They will say anything to get people to take that vaccine lol
22993,&gt;Should we wait until late 2021 to return to normal to be safe?
22994,There are degrees of normality.
22995,"Once the weather warms up, a lot of restrictions are going to start being lifted."
22996,But it will still be a while after that before we get to a point where we can say COVID-19 is over.
22997,Not really.
22998,If you get bored check out all the packages that have died and who demanded what.
22999,And you’d have to convince the other half that a “normal” America is a good thing to go back to.
23000,Why wouldn't it be free?
23001,See y'all in 2025.
23002,Clearly a lot of countries around the world have prevented significant outbreaks.
23003,Mainly in east Asia where preparedness for a SARS-type viral pandemic was higher due to SARS-1 in the early 2000s.
23004,"It's definitely possible to stop this virus, but it requires prompt and decisive action - half-measures and being slow to react for the sake of the economy actually only lead to far more economic damage in the long run as long-term restrictions will strangle the economy whereas a short, sharp, effective lockdown that totally obliterates community spread is better overall."
23005,"Just look at the GDP growth in places like Vietnam, China, Thailand etc this year to see the proof."
23006,"Everyone acts like “flatten the curve” was some huge bait and switch when 1) we never actually accomplished it and 2) if you accept it as a reasonable goal, it is implicit that you then *need to keep it flat indefinitely* and that allowing it to curve back upwards means there was no reason to put in the effort to flatten it in the first place."
23007,"About as rights he was about collective farming, steel making, and sparrow hunting."
23008,One bad landlord doesnt' mean every landlord is bad.
23009,[deleted]
23010,"I've been quarantining since Friday, tested Tuesday, DRIVING (not flying) from PA to MI Saturday, where my parents are also quarantining and have gotten tested."
23011,No one in Philadelphia is acting like anything is normal.
23012,"Remote work is standard if possible, everyone is wearing a mask, indoor dining doesn't exist, gyms are shut down, etc."
23013,Very good point.
23014,"I think that Canada did a decent job on a federal level, the quick rollout of CERB is a good example of this."
23015,"However some provinces like Ontario, Quebec and Alberta deserve mixed grades at best."
23016,Only if there was no defections.
23017,The lower level senators on both sides of the aisle are getting fed up.
23018,"They don't have the momentum the more established senators have, so they need to pass something or otherwise their constituents are going to grow increasingly disgruntled."
23019,I thought that said “Comedians” at first...
23020,"&gt; Edit: life threatening reactions to pfizer or moderna vaccines are extremely rare and no deaths have occurred, but health experts are erring on the side of caution, and often monitoring patients for 10-15 minutes to ensure no adverse reaction occurs."
23021,So literally the same thing I have to do every year when I get my flu shot even though I've had a dozen flu shots and never had an adverse reaction?
23022,"(Not USA if that makes a difference, but every time I have had a flu shot they make us stay 15 minutes to ensure no adverse reaction)."
23023,[removed]
23024,Not needed in this case because the vaccines targeted the spike protein which is critical for COVID-19.
23025,No worries!
23026,I totally understand.
23027,"Getting pregnant is definitely a personal choice, and don’t go for it until you feel ready!"
23028,"The pandemic has been super hard, so I don’t blame you."
23029,I was just sharing one of the surprise benefits of pandemic pregnancy.
23030,Wrong.
23031,They’re free.
23032,They've definitely discussed this in several TWiV episodes.
23033,Made for a great reading and behind the scenes thinking.
23034,"To clarify, I was NOT demanding and  understand why we don’t want intentional exposure to COVID."
23035,Is it an option to try vaccinating people already infected/hospitalized ?
23036,Too late?
23037,What are the considerations?
23038,No we don’t.
23039,They’re free.
23040,That's the thing.
23041,"For how many days have we seen articles with headlines like ""Nurses at the end of their ropes,"" ""We can't take any more,"" ""Staff pushed to their limits."""
23042,"And yet, the next day is another day, and then another day, and pretty soon we've seen the same articles every day for a month."
23043,So are they at their limits or not?
23044,"I'm very far from criticizing the health care workers, believe me."
23045,This is a very bad and destructive habit of headline writers though.
23046,"It's a ""boy crying wolf' scenario repeated every single day."
23047,That's insane.
23048,And I get nervous walking by a masked person in the grocery store...
23049,Yeah sorry to be a downer but considering the state of this country there is no fucking way this is going to happen.
23050,Too many will refuse causing this to linger a lot longer than it should.
23051,I doubt there is normalcy until sometime in 2022 at this point sadly.
23052,"ICU bed capacity reached, probably."
23053,I expected these kind of numbers from California in the first wave.
23054,Any idea why it’s finally hitting now and not sooner?
23055,Were people out there really lax about thanksgiving?
23056,Using Jab or stuck when talking about getting a shot are not foreign in the US.
23057,15 different places then I try to suss out the truth from a corporate sponsored casserole of bullshit
23058,Usa still hasn't gone into their first lockdown
23059,I could see that assuming people still have enough money to actually get divorced.
23060,From what I hear it isn't cheap.
23061,Dining with multiple households was generally not advised.
23062,Nah fam.
23063,Summer at the very latest.
23064,This is probably going to be downvoted fairly heavily...but are declining birth rates really as bad as everyone assume them to be?
23065,"We are currently entering an age of rapidly increasing automation in a variety of different industries, where vast swathes of the population are expected to lose their jobs and careers, likely permanently."
23066,I'm not even talking about the far future.
23067,"Within the next 10 years, self driving vehicles are poised to put several million American truck drivers mostly out of the job."
23068,"This is one of the most prominent examples, but there are many other less obvious ones."
23069,"Are falling birth rates really that bad, when the near future is looking economically grim for people being born today?"
23070,cats apparently develop antibodies and rebound fully in about 3 to 5 days.
23071,Didn't California just recently have massive protests on police over reach
23072,Deaths are a lagging indicator.
23073,LA county had 0 new ICU patients yesterday.
23074,Orange county had 18 new ICU patients (a 5.8% increase).
23075,Hospitalizations also increased by 7.3% in Orange county versus 4.8% in LA county.
23076,There's no question that LA county is getting hit hard right now.
23077,"But, it's not all roses in Orange county."
23078,They are heading in the wrong direction.
23079,Their positivity rate indicates that they are missing cases and their ICU and hospitalization rate increases are telling a different picture than absolute number of positive cases.
23080,"Then he should qualify that, which he never does."
23081,"Or also not assume these are the only 2 vaccines that will be approved, which is also not going to happen."
23082,"Basically - if he doesn’t know the actual answer, he should shut the fuck up and stop answering questions with the kind of confidence that he sort of does."
23083,Which he has been doing all along.
23084,"Pfizer decided they didn't want to complicate things by cluttering their treatment data with varying storage requirements, so they said, ""We know that if we keep between these temperatures, it will definitely be good, without any question,"" and they decided to put off testing on temperatures."
23085,"They were fairly sure that they could store and ship the vaccine in a wider (and less-cold) range of temperatures, but they decided to go with what they knew worked, and then work on expanding that range later."
23086,"They're working on seeing if they can expand the temperature range right now and will fold the results into their final approval application, but they wanted to make sure they could provide a reliable vaccine first."
23087,Was it the wrong decision?
23088,"Maybe, especially since Moderna has less strict requirements, but its the decision that a lot of extremely knowledgable people came to, and they reached that decision while taking in a whole host of factors that would never have occured to me."
23089,So what was the US birth rate during the 1930s?
23090,Most county health departments will give flu shots for free.
23091,I assume covid will be the same.
23092,[deleted]
23093,Lots of ppl won't be going to the office the same way again.
23094,"My company recognizes work-from-home is great and plans to keep it going after society is ""back to normal""."
23095,I think your numbers are CA as a whole.
23096,Article is just LA County.
23097,"CA reported 54K today w/ a 13K backlog, so 41K much like you said but for the state not county."
23098,What are you fucking rambling about?
23099,Did I ever suggest we flattened it completely?
23100,I know where we are and why we are here.
23101,Did you even read what I wrote?
23102,This is the point.
23103,Larger landlords are more beholden to regulation.
23104,Liquidation of the small landlords is the goal.
23105,Most of my family won't be getting the vaccine.
23106,Most of my family are also Trump supports.
23107,Must be some sort of coincidence
23108,"Be careful if you have allergies, as I'm hearing reports that people with a history of having anaphylactic shock are at a higher risk of having a severe allergic reaction."
23109,Make sure and monitor yourself well.
23110,For me I'm a little concerned since my reactions tend to be very delayed.
23111,I've had times where I've eaten something and then not had an allergic reaction until 3-6 hours later.
23112,Neither I nor my doctor can really explain it.
23113,I still want to get the vaccine though.
23114,If I can’t catch it o can’t be a carrier.
23115,Sure it can physically be on me but studies have shown it doesn’t spread particularly well through surface contact.
23116,"It's less than 10 people, more like 300k shots."
23117, lets have hundred thousands of deaths so we can save the cells.
23118,Do these idiots even think at what they say or they just go on autopilot?
23119,"9/11 response was about paying lip service to troops murdering ""bad"" brown people half a world away."
23120,Pandemic response was about doing your part and keep others safe everyday.

23122,Nice
23123,I mean in the U.S. at least it doesn't seem like a stretch
23124,~ 3 months from vaccines to the general public + at least ~6-12 months before the public health effect of vaccines is significant.
23125,I want the vaccine and I want to forcibly vaccinate anyone who doesn’t want it (without a legitimate medical exemption).
23126,Either take the vaccine or don’t interact with the public in any way.
23127,"""Now that we got caught, we have issued a firm statement to our officers: anyone caught continuing to ignore the rules will be punished by us, who are also ignoring the rules."
23128,"Also, we aren't going to apologize - and you'll bear the fiscal liability of our actions."
23129,"Thank you."""
23130,You've obviously never been a landlord.
23131,Also you know the bankruptcy of smaller landlords just means larger landlords will just gobble up the smaller ones on the cheap.
23132,It's going to make the problem worse and not better.

23140,April or May is when it'll be generally available.
23141,"If you think through the timeline from there:

It'll take a couple months to get vaccines to everyone who wants them just because of supply lines and how many nurses are available to get it done."
23142,"It'll take a month or two more for each person to get the first dose, develop immunity (two weeks min), wait, then get a booster dose and develop stronger immunity (two more weeks min)."
23143,So now you're looking at mid to late summer just to get the first group of general population who are pro vaccine.
23144,"Even if that's enough, you're still going to have crowded hospitals for weeks or months for patients who caught it in the meantime, and the ones who catch it during the burn down."
23145,Probably have a trickle of people getting vaccinated that whole time.
23146,"That means people who get vaccinated will probably be able to mostly get back to normal around late summer at the earliest, and it'll probably be well into fall for the population as a whole."
23147,When you vaccinate 100 million people.

23155,The rest of the world is getting it and moving on from this and I'm joining them.
23156,I'm getting the vaccine.
23157,Shaking your fist at the sky or the tele is fucking stupid.
23158,He'd be doing whatever his Orange idol is doing.
23159,Vaccine be like refresh refresh refresh sold out
23160,Pfizer specifically went with the temperature range that they knew would absolutely produce a good vaccine.
23161,They're currently working on expanding that temperature range.
23162,"They're almost certain to be able to get it to the range that Moderna operates in, and potentially even past that."
23163,The capitalists in charge of the Republican Party who are losing all their money will handle that
23164,A few hundred out of millions of cases.
23165,Some people are unlucky and just don’t produce antibodies.
23166,It’s the same reason some people get chickenpox twice even though you’re supposed to only be able to get it once.
23167,"&gt;Masks Don't Work"" early on because ""lack of data"" knowing full well that every similar virus is inhibited through mask wear."
23168,"For what it’s worth, there was data from the last flu pandemic showing that mask wearing didn’t change the outcome."
23169,"It was never a question of if masks are capable of blocking a pathogen, it was about if having the general public wear masks was enough of a benefit to outweigh the downsides."
23170,Think of it this way: there's no way anyone can know at this point when or even if normalcy returns.
23171,"They are all just estimating, which is why different ""dates"" will keep coming out, especially as more and more developments and info come out."
23172,"There really isn't a single date where ppl are going to be like ""yup it's 100% normal again""."
23173,"It will be gradual and some will never return to ""normal"" since work from home will inevitably become more ""normal""."
23174,"Also, even from early on the experts were saying there may never actually a return to the old normal since this may become a seasonal problem etc so we may be seeing masks for the rest of our lives."

23177,True!
23178,"But getting them to wait in line in the first place, for said jab?"
23179,...
23180,Narrator : They didn't.
23181,There will be increase in unplanned pregnancy from the states that don't offer high quality sex education and birth control.
23182,But for already married couples wanting to have kids it'll depend on how bad the economic situation from the pandemic lasts.
23183,In the US at least it's probably going to be pretty bad for quite a while.
23184,We'll see which group ends up being bigger: A.
23185,The smart couples that realize they can't afford to have kids or B.
23186,The dumb ones that start popping out kids they can't afford to feed.
23187,"I guess, being a doctor, he doesn't know a lot about economics."
23188,"Our country won't be ""back to normal"" as the wealthy put it for a long long time."
23189,The damage is done and just continues to snowball.
23190,"Not to mention, if it takes that long to get most people vaccinated, the virus will simply mutate quicker and be more harmful."
23191,"This whole mess is a... well, mess."
23192,There's no need to vaccinate nearly EVERYONE.
23193,"Mainly just the people with pre-existing conditions, the elderly, and people in healthcare."
23194,This alone will ramp down hospitalizations and deaths and allow economies to re-open and life to get back to 'normal'.
23195,Hopefully that'll happen by spring!
23196,There’s gonna be so mad ppl on ventilators that refused the vaccine.
23197,Fuck em tho
23198,No way Americans will try to “go back to normal” earlier than that once a few people get the vaccine 🙄

23397,"Yeah, because the only way a virus can mutate is through an unvaccinated person."
23398,You sound childish as Hell.
23399,She has a 4 year old.
23400,I can’t even fathom how heartless you would have to be to do that.
23401,"All vaccines do not show strong data that suggests it mitigates transmission, so you can still get covid and transmit it."
23402,Which is not good.
23403,The point of the vaccine is to make sure the system isn’t overrun.
23404,The vaccine will prevent 95% (efficacy rate) from serious symptoms (or any symptoms).
23405,So the goal is it mitigate SEVERITY of it.
23406,I think distribution of the vaccine is of higher importance.
23407,"I'm sure they have ballpark ideas, but the main focus now is to get the process up and running."
23408,"Then when the system is in place, look at results and move from there."
23409,"Distribution is a very complex issue, and hasn't been done on this scale, ever."
23410,It's an enormously complex task.
23411,It's important to not put the cart before the horse and be very conservative in making promises you know you can't fufil without absolute certainty.
23412,"That being said, we should be to very loose restrictions in the summer and next winter we will be past it."
23413,"Mexico already has vaccines, racist"
23414,"Seeing as you’ve recovered, it looks like you didn’t need them!"
23415,Because the vaccine hasn’t been studied for long term safety and isn’t even fully approved.
23416,It’s being released under emergency use authorization that could be withdrawn at any time.
23417,I hope that very soon your grandmother can have her vaccine and that you get to give her a nice hug.
23418,you assume western nednecks understand what quadratic function or exponential fuction means
23419,Nah you're all good.
23420,It's changing all the time.
23421,Here's another half a month after the October article.

23423,"I mean, at this rate it's probably going to be a year and a half before dating returns to normal, that's a lot of time."
23424,This is what I've been saying.
23425,"Remember, when it was ""life won't return to normal until we have a vaccine, which will likely take at least 18 months."""
23426,"Now we have one, which was developed in half the time, but we still must restrict our activities for several months even after it is available to everyone."
23427,"Yes, pregnancy means prenatal care, and that means going into a medical office multiple times."
23428,COVID City.
23429,"Then, going to the hospital."
23430,COVID World.
23431,Was that a used needle???

23433,How are the numbers coming out of Venezuela so much better than any other Latin American country?

23436,If ADE was a concern it would have been seen in people treated with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies or convalescent serum or in the vaccine trials when vaccinated individuals were exposed to wild type coronavirus.

23438,&gt; put a bunch of vials into a freezer at a given temperature for a given period of time then try to measure chemical degradation..
23439,"So it feels strange the tests have not been done...

* How cold is the room the freezer is in?"
23440,* For how long?
23441,* Is it constantly that temperature or does it vary over that given time?
23442,"* If varies, what are the temperature swings and for how long?"
23443,* What is the humidity in the room the freezer is in?
23444,* What is the air pressure in the room the freezer is in?
23445,* What is the thermal loss or gain from the floor in the room the freezer is in?
23446,* Is there ever sunlight shining on the freezer?
23447,"All of the above are factors for the freezer as its being flown from one continent to another, put on trucks and put in various warehouses as it travels to its destination."
23448,Many things that seem simple on the surface aren't as soon as you do them in the real world.
23449,It's like every month I see a post like this.
23450,And it's always like we're gonna investigate now.
23451,"Yes, its literally illegal right now to buy any of the approved vaccines as only the government is authorized to distribute them."
23452,Taking a different route than the previous responders.
23453,Let’s say it was a solid 3% of people that got Covid died from it that would be a pretty big deal right?
23454,Most people believe that would bring society to a halt.
23455,If you don’t think it through and you’ll probably realize that a lot would be turned upside down.
23456,Now imagine a virus that less deadly (let’s say 1%) but it’s 3x more transmissible.
23457,That’s the tough thing with Covid.
23458,It’s a tough one to grapple with because it’s so catchy and often spreads in a presymptomatic phase.
23459,In a way it’s effect can’t be boiled down to what it does to one person but rather what it does when it becomes ubiquitous in a community.
23460,Imagine that hypothetical virus that kills 3% but only infects 1/3 as easily as Covid.
23461,People would be crapping themselves.

23484,If everybody gets it we’d reach this goal (which happens to be a little later than it likely will be).

23491,"If it were Clinton instead, there would be zero deaths."
23492,"That’s completely ignoring the fact that European countries that took much more invasive and aggressive steps, similar to what I assume you think Clinton would, are *still* faring worse than the US."
23493,The response to this is on governors.
23494,The states that have been the worst hit tend to be run by democrats.
23495,The states that are doing the best tend to be run by republicans.
23496,"I’m not saying it’s a cause and effect, but it’s a telling data point that you can’t lay 300k deaths at Trumps feet without looking like a partisan tool."
23497,"2 months more of pandemic at this rate is 160,000 deaths."

23500,"If ~100m of the most vulnerable are vaccinated within 100 days, there will be no real reason to stay in ""lockdown"" (unless that lockdown is regionalized)."

23514,What about Old Zealanders
23515,Yes this is what every sensible and well resourced government in the world is doing in case some don't work.
23516,Also some of vaccine purchases are through the Covax facility so pre-purchases contribute to development and purchasing in less wealthy countries.

23638,I’m not an antivaxer i’m more so concerned with the possibility of extreme unseen side effects.
23639,Pushing something out this fast under an emergency policy is concerning.
23640,The fact that the washington or new york post “debunked” side effects says so much.
23641,You can’t possibly debunk side effects until years after data collection.
23642,For the fact that they’re pushing it so hard on state workers.
23643,That they are mandated to get it and tell their staff that it’s good for them and there are no problems.

&gt;“So if we can get the overwhelming proportion of the population vaccinated by let’s say the end of the second, the beginning of the third quarter – by the time we get into **mid-fall of 2021**, we can be approaching some level of normality,” Fauci told CNBC’s Meg Tirrell during a special edition of the “Healthy Returns” conference."
23674,— From the Article
23675,"True but testing in March and April was so sporadic in California that I’m sure there were many, many more cases that went undetected back in the spring."
23676,I live in Northern California where mask usage is probably 98% and cases are still on the rise.
23677,"People wear masks, cases go up."
23678,People don’t wear masks and cases go up.
23679,Lockdowns take place and cases go up.
23680,Things open back up and cases go up.
23681,The virus will spread no matter what.
23682,Going out and shopping while wearing a mask and generally keeping your distance from people leaves you an extraordinarily small chance of getting infected.
23683,It's not how the disease spreads.
23684,You need prolonged contact with an infected individual to become infected yourself.
23685,It's also why surface transmission is so rare.
23686,Obviously it's entirely possible to go too far in the pursuit of preserving human life.
23687,"People die and accidents happen, it's impossible to prevent that without some form of dictatorship."
23688,"But the way things are now is insane, people shoot others to death for no reason, they drive high and drunk and kill innocent families and just walk away and people are such whiny little souls that wearing another bit of fabric to save lives is just SUCH an imposition and how DARE you impose upon their rights to be walking virus factories."
23689,"We all know, there is just a certain group that just thinks nothing matters unless it directly affects them."

23692,"I’m just really glad she still lives with my Mom, and not in a group environment, where her risk can be mitigated."
23693,But it’s still so unnerving because you can do everything right and still manage to catch it.
23694,Yeah i agree with a lot of that.
23695,Obama’s flint drinking was questionable at best and really disappointed a lot of people here (in michigan).

23722,&gt; most people will not get the vaccine.
23723,Most people will.
23724,But in modern society even a minority of the population is enough to cause havoc.
23725,320+ million Americans and 20 million refuse vaccine.
23726,That's enough to be a concern even though it's  6% of the population.
23727,As an independent who leans Democratic screw Newsom and CA leadership.
23728,I hope they’re all recalled and have to shelter in place for the rest of their lives.
23729,Drove so many businesses and employees out of business and broke the rules themselves.
23730,"They did none of the hard work like increasing hospital beds, having a contact tracing system, or having tighter borders."
23731,Instead there plan each time is a shutdown.
23732,"If you’re referring to your 20s, I’ll tell you that 30 and 31 beat the hell out of all ten before."
23733,Almost all of the people I know who miss being in their twenties deeply regret the path they took to get where they are.
23734,"Make of it what you will, but I think they miss possibilities more than any actual aspect of their life then."
23735,"Finally, this has been a challenging year, but there’s still a lot of joy to be found in a society where socializing is scarier."
23736,Noooooice.
23737,Entire states without mask mandates don't have as many cases per day.
23738,I wonder what is going on with the people there?
23739,I appreciate the maturity you reflect in this comment.
23740,Thank you.
23741,Yeah but once the vulnerable are vaccinated hospitalizations will inevitably decrease.
23742,"Of course not literally everyone will take it, that's why I said has had the chance to."
23743,I'm less concerned with anti-vaxxers and much more concerned with vulnerable populations who are medically unable to get the vaccine.
23744,Yay!
23745,When I did corporate flu shot clinics the person who did my training said that surprise anaphylactic allergies are so rare that she had no meaningful data to give us.
23746,But if it happens it can become deadly quickly.
23747,"When setting up for shot clinics step 1 was clean the area and step 2 was prepare a dose of epinephrine for administration, just in case."
23748,In the 100’s of clinics that I’ve done over the years I’ve never seen an anaphylactic reaction.
23749,Every year a couple people would faint at the sight of the needle but that was the worst of it.
23750,"&gt; what people must have experienced in pre-industrial revolution times

humans have ALWAYS been a social animal."
23751,"across any culture, we've always gathered and celebrated."
23752,Line my pockets by getting the vaccine and all can go back to normal muhahahahaha
23753,Well that and having lots of coronavirus.
23754,God damn it’s frustrating seeing so many people waffle about Fauci.
23755,It’s almost as if he’s only “The leading expert” when he says things that align with people’s feelings.
23756,"Make it normal yourself, don’t wait for these fucks to tell you."
23757,Pandemic fatigue leads to strains on hospitals.
23758,Multiply by 4 to account for fauci's optimism and Americans.
23759,Try Fall 2022 since every prediction about returning to normal has been longer than expected.
23760,&gt;  Is it really that hard to wait a year before dating again???
23761,Yes.
23762,"A year is insanely long, especially for a virus that has a .1 maybe .2% chance of killing me."
23763,Reporter: When?
23764,"Expert: We don't know but …

Reporter: What's your estimate?"
23765,"Expert: Personally I guess …

News: Final and only true answer: Expert says …"
23766,"Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with doing a lot of testing since the positivity rate has been going up for at least the last month."
23767,"We're looking a second state wide shut down by new years, imo."
23768,Did you read the article?
23769,"It specifically says that isn’t true and the increased risk was present even after correcting for other factors, including heart disease, obesity, diabetes and living in group homes."
23770,"This convinces me that 2021 is a wash as well, because most people will not get the vaccine."
23771,There's a bunch in OC and SD that are carrying on with dining and no one is doing anything to stop them at the moment
23772,[removed]
23773,Things change; life isn’t fair.
23774,Time for a lot of people to put their big kid pants on and deal with the new reality.
23775,"Also, almost every scientist said it’d be 12+ months."
23776,The only people spouting the 2 week shit were politicians.
23777,You can also make the argument that CA screwed themselves for being too effective at flattening the curve in Mar-Apr.
23778,Now there’s just more people to infect this time around.
23779,p.s.
23780,"In any case, look, you do you, I'm actually completely done relying on anyone but myself for engaging in what I consider to be responsible behavior during a pandemic."
23781,"If you want to take risks, that's on you."
23782,"I don't like it, but we live in a free society."
23783,"Expect to be judged by some people in your life, and expect to have to defend that decision if it comes up in the future."
23784,"It's a life choice you'll choose to make, and at the end of the day, it's your life."
23785,"But if you're judged, don't be surprised."
23786,You can't be everybody's hero.
23787,"If your attitude is ""Call me selfish I don’t care"" then take your own advice and don't care."
23788,Don't defend your decision as a responsible one.
23789,Don't expect people to like it and don't try to convince people who disagree that you're a good person at heart.
23790,You're already saying that people's opinions don't matter.
23791,"Act like it, then."
23792,ill send my accno and routing right over
23793,Why not both?
23794,"Maybe it's a 1-2 punch to end the pandemic globally, both here and in poor countries that may have to wait years for a vaccine."
23795,"There is a difference between going outside and doing normal things like going to restaurants, parks, libraries, the gym, and doing in person learning over going to concerts/parties/celebrations."
23796,Once I get vaccinated I’m living life pre pandemic without restrictions.
23797,"I’m not going to go around licking doorknobs, if that is your assumption."
23798,I will assume my risk in going to the aforementioned places but I will still avoid the latter before getting vaccinated.
23799,"them and Tennessee are basically the two reasons our numbers are still going up

even including the rest of the southern and northeastern states who are still seeing increases, the rest of the country outside of those two states has seen their combined seven day average drop by around 7500 in the last five days."
23800,Yup... Can’t help when our leadership is this stupid.
23801,Hope every CA major and Newsom is recalled and chased out of the state for good.

23852,No one dares go into a store without a mask.

23858,"If you're going to attack the nutter for delaying the recovery of our country, also blame the protesters and not just the ones you don't like."
23859,President elect Biden wrote the crime bill that put them there and vice president elect Harris fought against early parole so for-profit prisons could keep their slaves.
23860,Prisoners were specifically exempted from the abolition of slavery and the US just happens to be the country with by far the highest prison population in the world.

So I can somewhat, sorta, but not really see why some people are scared."

23870,This guy must have had something the doctors didn't catch in time but that doesn't mean the vaccine was bad or dangerous.

23877,1st day of the UK vaccinations 2 hospital workers suffered anaphylactic shock.
23878,Both already carried EpiPens and are fine.

23880,I think by march we will start getting more back to normal.
23881,but I think 100% by Fall.
23882,I've never felt so relived
23883,They don't do any good if half the state is shitting on the restrictions.
23884,Sounds more like inconsistent dose delivery by their end of the chain providers.
23885,I love how the  government and press can spin a dystopian lack of federal level standardisation into a positive benefit to add more vaccine to the lack of federal foresight to reserve more of said vaccine.
23886,"If we dose it incorrectly due to lack of standards, we have some leftover stuff in the vials."
23887,Amazing.

23891,I suspect that’s what they were referring to.
23892,"Yeah, I just assume that things will gradually go back to normal long before that, once all vulnerable people (70+, or with underlying conditions) who can be vaccinated are."
23893,"Pfizer hasn't disclosed that info yet, but for both shots, 6 hours after each injection, getting a low grade fever, chills and shivers, headaches, soreness in the arm, fatigue, a general feeling of being unwell,  and more pronounced symptoms on the 2nd injection, I feel fairly confident that it was not the placebo."
23894,"Most of the symptoms went away after I went to bed, and the arm soreness after a day or so."
23895,"I'm not sure when they will tell us what we got; they did say they would allow those who got the placebo to switch over to the real vaccine, but still waiting to hear more."

* To them the vaccine was developed and being administered at a concerning speed."
23903,Very true.
23904,It has been swift.
23905,But for good reason.
23906,"* Most of them already have it and/or still have antibodies

It doesn't mean that they had a full-on case of Covid or that their anti-bodies are sufficient."
23907,There are reports of individuals who have gotten Covid twice already this year.
23908,* we all already feel like guinea pigs and this just seems like another thing.
23909,That's just medicine.
23910,You're on the bleeding edge of the industry.
23911,If this was a new vaccine during any other year you won't think anything about it.
23912,* main thing is they just don’t want to be the first to get this newly developed vaccines.
23913,Concerns of side effects and what not.
23914,That's part working in the medical field.
23915,If you were afraid of being exposed to things or having side effects you chose the wrong profession.
23916,Doctors and staff are vaccinated early and often.
23917,It's necessary.
23918,It's too bad there are never any stories of bad landlords with bad tenants.
23919,That way I can enjoy the misery of both parties since they really deserve each other.
23920,"I don't want stories of landlords removing doors off of tenants who lost their jobs due to covid, or stories of tenants refusing to pay rent just for kicks and then trashing the place for no good reason."

24058,I read somewhere that measles immunity from the vaccine isn’t always for life.
24059,They specifically recommend pregnant women get tested and revaccinated if necessary.
24060,I’m pretty sure immunity from the disease is for life though.
24061,With some diseases natural immunity is stronger but with others vaccination is better.
24062,So far they think covid is the latter.

24075,Sorry but i think that's a poor argument in this case.
24076,In this case we are talking about a virus that is spread through breathing and can travel on moisture droplets you expel from the lungs.
24077,This virus is killing 100'000's of people world wide.
24078,"Let's say one person says they don't think wearing a mask will reduce the number of deaths while another person thinks that placing a barrier in front of the mouth, which while still allowing the person to breath, will stop the moisture droplets from being expelled straight into the air or onto another person."
24079,"Let's say there is no evidence to back either argument (which is a lie, I have personally seen a list of over 70 studies done proving the effectiveness of masks in stopping the spread of illness when people use them) but let's say there are no studies yet."
24080,"Would it not be better to err on the side of caution and put a mask mandate in place, logically thinking it sounds right that masks could stop the virus droplets being breathed directly onto someone."
24081,When the studies are done later on the effectiveness of masks (they already have been done and masks work) you can decide to do what the studies show.

24132,"Agreed on the antibodies, but most who get the illness will develop cellular immunity as well."
24133,Antibodies aren't the whole story and they will always fade quickly in people who dont get a severe case because it's just not worth the body making the effort of maintaining such a response to a relatively unthreatening illness (as for most people it is).
24134,"What will remain, however, is a cellular roadmap to getting back up to speed quickly in the case of reinfection."

24149,"Essentially the report recommended this priority order:

1. residents in a care home for older adults and their carers
2."
24150,"**all those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers**
3. all those 75 years of age and over
4. all those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals
5. all those 65 years of age and over
6. all individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality
7. all those 60 years of age and over
8. all those 55 years of age and over
9. all those 50 years of age and over

As Sir Ian McKellen is 81, he falls into priority group 2, so is of equal priority to healthcare workers."
24151,"There are some logistical concerns in vaccinating group 1, notably, you want to bring the vaccine to the care homes rather than risk these elderly people being taken to the hospital (I imagine this isn't the easiest thing to do, especially for patients with dementia), however, the early rollout is only going to occur within hospital ""hubs"" due to the refrigeration and logistical constraints."

24964,More if someone gets sick and they have to call staff from a different house over.
24965,I’ve only seen him once this year and I hate that but I refuse to take the risk of being the one to expose him.
24966,He’s already had a rough few years recently with his health and is currently bed bound with a catheter.
24967,We’ve been told his next hospitalization is very likely to be his last.
24968,I hate missing out on time with him when there may not be much left but I also don’t want to be the reason his time is shortened either.
24969,This just all stinks.
24970,I hope your brother stays on the road to recovery and you all stay safe through this.
24971,Haha well I appreciate the honesty
24972,\*sacrebleu !
24973,Is that because he is close to death ?
24974,"I love flowers and all, but how are florists included in this list?"
24975,"Customer facing for sure, but not remotely on the level of food service workers."
24976,"No disrespect intended, seriously asking."
24977,because there isn't anything to worry about
24978,Btw this paper is great for calculating the overall IFR drop once a certain age group is is vaccinated.
24979,"I did that for Germany, once you vaccinate all people &gt; 70 years old, the IFR drops from the initial 1.2 % to 0.16 %."
24980,"And once everyone &gt; 60 years old is vaccinated, the IFR for the remaining population drops to 0.05 %."
24981,The calculation is easy to do once you have the age distribution of a country.
24982,You take pleasure in this conversation?
24983,Yep.
24984,100% loser confirmed.
24985,When Trump got Covid I remember reporting several comments clearly wishing him harm.

24987,"This is hurting my brain to read, honestly do not understand a single sentence."
24988,"Can you calm down, take a few breaths and retype this with proper grammar?"
24989,Lockdowns so effective that a total of 17 new cases is front page national news.
24990,To be more clear.
24991,When the moderns and Pfizer gave their 95% number.
24992,That was the percentage that the vaccine prevented from getting sick.
24993,Not the percentage that generated antibodies.
24994,Where as the j&amp;j it doesn’t look like they’ve gotten to that part of the study yet.
24995,Being devil’s advocate here.
24996,"What strategy works best for New York or California might not work best South Dakota, for example."
24997,"So, perhaps (again being devil’s advocate) it’s best to have 50 states determine their individual plan than to have one entity, the federal government, come up with 50 individual plans?"
24998,Haha and trump said he felt like a war time President.
24999,What a tool
25000,"The Prime Minister of Sweden was afraid to
dispute the views of the Health Minister, and Sweden kept almost everything open, without a mask mandate."
25001,The death rate is about ten times that of neighboring countries.
25002,But what about 85 year olds who live by themselves?
25003,Aren't they WAY more at-risk than the people listed in the article?
25004,Isn't this about preventing deaths and freeing up the hospitals?
25005,"Then they should vaccinate those who are filling up the hospitals the fastest, and that would be the elderly, regardless of if they're in a care home or not."
25006,Then watch it go completely bonkers when you have to go back to the office
25007,North AL here.
25008,Last time I walked into a gas station I was the only one wearing a mask (including employees .)
25009,Felt like I was in the twilight zone.

25011,"Eh, they are about the same, if you scale by population size."
25012,"Here is a chart I made comparing Sweden, USA, and Canada (where I live) in terms of % of population infected each week (new infections, not total infections): [USA vs Canada vs Sweden](https://imgur.com/AMRkD8m)"
25013,One issue here in the US I think is that each state is managing vaccine distribution themselves.
25014,"They are just given X vaccines (based on adult population) and a ""good luck""."
25015,And unfortunately many state governments are incompetent.
25016,I’m a doctor in LA.
25017,I had my benefits cut.

25265,You’ll still have to wear a mask after the vaccine.
25266,It looks like you’ll still be able to pass the virus on even if it doesn’t affect you.
25267,Lock downs so effective we gotta do em again.
25268,If you dont have kids or underlying medical conditions probably shouldnt get it until long term effects are discovered.
25269,Because the narcissistic leaders don’t care about the people any longer.
25270,The “people” no longer feel any loyalty or sense of citizenship or country.
25271,We are effectively “disenfranchised”.
25272,"WW II, Hawaii was ruthlessly attacked early on a Sunday morning Dec 7, 1941."
25273,"After news of that hit the mainland, our  grandparents lined up at the military recruiting center ready to be die to protect the country they loved."
25274,"They were ready to go and were sent all over the world to fight and kill the enemy, and many came back dead and our great grandparents accepted that their children had made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and were proud of them, and pledged to make their lives matter in the next generation in honor of their lost loved ones."
25275,"The President at the time had helped the country ensure a severe and difficult Great Depression, and even passed programs to put men to work who happily took what we would call “shit” jobs in our generation to feed and support their families."
25276,Some were as dumb as digging holes and filling them up again.
25277,"But others built the Hoover Dam, which is one magnificent structure in Nevada everyone should see."
25278,"Many of the National Parks facilities were built during the Great Depression, by citizens needing a job employed by the government."
25279,"We, the people were CITIZENS, owners of OUR country."
25280,"Most Americans don’t feel this way anymore, we feel we are SERFS, SERVANTS, and SUBJECTS."
25281,We live in fear of our leaders instead of respecting them.
25282,This needs to change.
25283,"If we are Americans, then we need to vote out those who have made this country a mess, and vote in NEW LEADERS who can make the changes the country needs."
25284,I don’t think either party has it right.
25285,The special interests have corrupted leaders from doing the right thing.
25286,"Normally, it takes a big event like a war to get a country united."
25287,"But this time,  we had big virus and the the result was a deficit of leadership that should be rewarded by an angry citizenship that “votes the bums out”."
25288,The 1920s were awful for rural America.
25289,"It became a ""Great Depression"" when it hit the cities and tanked the stock market."
25290,The culprit was ill-managed prosperity.
25291,"Then, it was agricultural surplus due to industrial nitrogen fixation— now, it's the devaluation of all human labor (and, possibly, permanent labor market instability) due to technological automation and communication."
25292,Genomic testing tomorrow should confirm if its one which was in Australia previously or an unknown international one.
25293,If it's an international strain thats less of a concern because its likely a breach from an overseas traveller that can be traced and suppressed.
25294,"If its local that means its been circulating under the radar for a while and likely is well rooted in the community, and spread to other states."
25295,"Oh, that’s a good starting place, I think."
25296,What outlets do you consider reasonable?
25297,Dual-wielding corgis is priceless
25298,If we’re banning people for shitty things why don’t you ban the anti-maskers and people downplaying this ?
25299,I read Sir Ian McKellen and coronavirus and I thought he caught it for a second.
25300,I think they meant a year and a half since the start of the pandemic.
25301,So that’d be about September 2021.
25302,That's still a miniscule amount compared to all the people that a) are responsible or b) are able to sober enough to use plan B.
25303,"It's kinda hard for a woman to have more than one accidental kid in a year (not impossible but unlikely), so the small number of irresponsible women just can't offset the number of prevented pregnancies."
25304,Probably because no one on this sub seems to understand that different administrative entities have different populations.
25305,There is simply no information value to the title.
25306,Apparently the vaccine causes atheism.
25307,"How about, grouped by age?"
25308,There are still people fighting mandates.
25309,"The ""open Michigan up"" crowd really screwed the pooch."
25310,I'm trying.
25311,But my boyfriend is losing patience.
25312,He wants to go out and party on New Year's.
25313,Meanwhile I just want to go visit my mom without fear of killing her.
25314,Haven't seen my family in over a year.
25315,"God, I hate to say it, but this might be the breaking point."
25316,That's a very good point actually.
25317,Never thought of it that way.
25318,"Most studies find that asymptomatic spread is not so common, the majority of cases are traced to symptomatic individuals"
25319,"People are going to accuse me of being a ""Sweden defender"" because the state of discussion here is bad."
25320,"But, there is a double standard where countries that aren't Sweden that have high death tolls are often explained away by environmental factors outside the control of interventions whereas in Sweden it is always a direct result of policy."
25321,"I think it's like how past Presidents will be taking the shot publicly to help encourage people to take it, except with someone who's popular."
25322,Ill take the vaccine in a few years.
25323,Hope you already have kids.
25324,Yes.
25325,Some cities in CA are well on their way right now.
25326,The pretend lockdown is doing nothing.
25327,Remember how they sealed people in apartment buildings in Wuhan?
25328,Welded doors shut.
25329,"Unfortunately a lot of clinical literature these days refuses to use the terms ""male"" and ""female"" or ""man"" or ""woman."""
25330,"I do a lot of healthcare writing and it's becoming a problem, because not everyone is health literate enough to even know they're a ""person with a cervix."""
25331,"The idea is to be inclusive, but the reality often excludes people with language barriers or reading comprehension issues."
25332,One might even say Warpspeed
25333,Gandalf the Grey becomes Gandalf the Vaccinated.

25338,Shocking!
25339,What you're predicting is very unlikely.
25340,"Sure, people will have a lot of sex in 2022, because that's just something humans do when the opportunity presents itself."
25341,"However, the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the unprecedented upward wealth transfer, at common expense, will generate a decade-long baby bust at minimum."
25342,The endgame of our economic system is something like Japan's *hikikomori* phenomenon.
25343,"The labor market diverges; wages fall, opportunities worsen, and people eventually become inured to declining conditions."
25344,"People are becoming temporary shut-ins during the pandemic, but when they come out to find there are no jobs for them, a lot of them are going to shut in in a more permanent way."
25345,"Society will eventually find a way out of this, but I doubt it's going to happen in 2 years."
25346,It took 40 years for the upper classes to loot America to this point; it will take 40 years at least to reverse their damage.
25347,"This seems like they're doing the opposite, looking only for T cells caused by a COVID infection, assuming that cross-reactive T cells are just getting in the way of detecting ones resulting from an actual COVID infection, not that they're actually effective."
25348,&gt;It is still controversial how exclusively specific T cell antigen recognition is in general.
25349,"On one hand, there are reports suggesting that T cell recognition might be highly promiscuous with individual T cell clones being able to cross-reactively recognize 10^(6) different peptides."
25350,"On the other hand, changing even a single amino acid in the presented peptide frequently abrogates T cell recognition

And considering some of the vaccines cost as little as $4 (AstraZeneca), a mass vaccination campaign is probably more cost-effective than a mass T cell testing program using some newly developed lab test."
25351,It's pretty well established that the elderly are at a greater risk of dying to COVID.
25352,That does not necessarily mean they are contracting it more often.
25353,Cases based on population of age group would be a better indicator.
25354,God bless the dark web

25356,"No, mRNA vaccines are new."

25359,“Unlikely” is not good enough.
25360,“First few weeks” is the opposite of long term.
25361,Thats short term effects buddy.

25367,I'm about the only person even wearing a mask.

25370,"From the article:

&gt; By the time we get to the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality"
25371,There are no greater experts than those who understand nothing at all.
25372,"He's also a widely known, universally beloved figure who's in one of the higher risk groups and was photographed taking it and immediately shared it to all of his followers."
25373,He was probably tapped to help promote the vaccine.
25374,Not sure why you are getting so heavily downvoted.
25375,Fuck the king.

25377,He should not have a say in anything.
25378,"Thanks for that, those reviews are hilarious!"
25379,!
25380,The European Union has ordered over 2 billion doses of vaccines from 6 different companies for it less then 450 million people.
25381,"The rest will mostly go to Africa , not just for humanitarian reason but also for self protective reason."
25382,"Historical Africa and Europe a one and the same dispersal area for infectios diseases, especially when they are seasonal."
25383,"This pandemic is only over for Europe , when the virus is routed out from Norway all the way down to South Africa."
25384,No one cares what they would say.
25385,There aren’t a bunch of idiots running around saying Britain and Belgium have done ok. Everyone knows they are shit.
25386,There’s no morons like Tegnell slagging off other countries.
25387,They know they are in deep shit and the aren’t trying to hide it like some of the Swedes are.
25388,"Honestly, I kind of want the Olympics to go on."
25389,It would be such a hopeful moment after all of this shit.
25390,"Plus, I want Simone Biles to do her thing."
25391,Gymnastics is one of my favorite sports to watch and it is absolutely devastating for these athletes to have this canceled especially when so much of the sport depends on when you peak.
25392,They might not get the chance in another few years.
25393,[deleted]
25394,However there is good news in michigan.
25395,Cases have been cut in half since 2 weeks ago.
25396,We are still at 4000/day but have been declining.
25397,Hopefully people can continue to isolate and we can get this better under control.
25398,Well there's 13 million people crammed into LA county so it's not surprising.

25402,&gt;  J&amp;J getting EUA approval in February means EVERYONE will be vaccinated who can by late April at the latest.
25403,"Well I hope so, but I think it will likely be into late may/june for everyone who wants it to get it."
25404,"our state dept of health is saying for normal individuals, you can get in line for the vaccine in April."
25405,"I do think by August/September, we will be approaching normal social interactions."
25406,We do!

25409,"""Thorough assessment of a candidate vaccine’s safety requires sufficiently long follow-up to address delayed untoward reactions."
25410,How long will that be?
25411,How many subjects must be evaluated before a vaccine is deemed safe.

25422,It's very unlikely that there would be any effect after the first few weeks or so.
25423,mRNA is not a new thing to the body.
25424,It’s weird that we live in a time where something like eating in a restaurant is considered irresponsible.
25425,I’ll be glad when this is finally over
25426,Only difference is war killed mostly young soldiers and coronavirus killed mostly old people
25427,"He’s only doubting the prevelance of spread not the benefits of natural immunity, which are clear and long lasting"
25428,Sounds nice.
25429,In Idaho (usa) we can't get people to do the right thing even with actual restrictions in place.
25430,I can't even imagine a world where the majority just choose to do the right thing because it's the right thing.
25431,You wouldn't need to.

25511,David Attenborough as well needs the vaccine
25512,"Well, maybe they should then because compared to Sweden, they both fucked up."
25513,Why do you think an economic depression will start after the vaccines?
25514,"Being vaccinated will provide a great deal of personal stress relief, more than anything else."
25515,"But beyond that, as soon as the elderly and particularly vulnerable are vaccinated, economies will be reopened."
25516,"The government's will require young people to accept the risk of infection, because of the low odds of any serious symptoms, let alone death, for younger and healthy folk."
25517,"Governments will stop caring particularly much about case numbers and start focusing of hospitalisation and death figures, which will likely go down really fast as vaccinations are carried out."
25518,Why do people like you have to be the way you are?

25530,Think I've found my Internet rabbit hole of the day.
25531,Thanks for the help.
25532,Both my parents were nurses at LA County Hospital for about 3 decades and retired just before COVID.
25533,They both said that everything they’re hearing from their colleagues sounds a million times worse (in terms of volume) than what they experienced working in Los Angeles during the AIDS pandemic.
25534,"They’ve told me the most heart-breaking stories of people alone, on their death beds, suffering horrifically, dying of something unknown, then eventually called “GRID” (Gay-Related Immunodeficiency Disease)."
25535,It’s breaking their hearts that they can’t be there to help their colleagues and the people of LA anymore.
25536,But both of them are in their late 60’s and have health problems that make them more susceptible to COVID.
25537,They can’t go back.
25538,Especially because the PPE situation is so bad.
25539,The conditions the nurses and other hospital staff have to work in are just ridiculous.
25540,They’re being set up for failure.
25541,"These working conditions are unethical and inhumane — but beyond that, they’re just unsafe."
25542,Nurses aren’t disposable.
25543,They’re literally saving lives or comforting those who cannot be saved so that they don’t die alone.
25544,Nurses are fucking heroes.
25545,"But with the conditions they’re being forced to work in, they’re being forced into martyrs."
25546,And a forced martyr sounds more like a hostage to me.
25547,Power to the nurses who strike.
25548,Both my parents were in the union.
25549,My dad negotiated and lobbied successfully to then-governor Schwarzenegger about CRNA’s.
25550,I inherited an SEIU t-shirt from my mom that I wear proudly.
25551,"But most of all, having nurses for parents taught me to care, unyieldingly, about helping other people."
25552,"And for that, I am eternally grateful."
25553,Thank you to EVERY nurse and hospital worker.
25554,"I support you, especially those of you striking."
25555,I know that you’re doing it because you have to.
25556,You can’t keep helping your patients if you’re sick or burnt out to your breaking point or dead.
25557,Power to the people 👊
25558,"When people don’t believe, they just say they (celebrities and the rich etc) got a fake injection or something."
25559,It doesn’t make them believe.
25560,If they’re that utterly foolish as to not want the vaccine.
25561,Not when the drug is a 100 grand they don’t.
25562,This is one thing I was worried about when the UK made that 90 year old lady the poster woman of getting the vaccine.
25563,Maybe don’t publicize the faces of people who have a high chance of dying from unrelated causes as just getting the vaccine.
25564,That’s the last thing we need right now.
25565,"This kind of action by viruses isn't novel - we've known that this can happen, generally speaking, to other organisms for a long time."
25566,"Shouldn't be shocking that it can happen to us, too."
25567,I know a lot of people checked out when protests were deemed unnecessary to trace in.
25568,"Then move to colder weather, holiday season and loss of trust in our our political leaders."
25569,Preaching to do everything perfect then constantly being caught breaking the rules.
25570,I just stay at home
25571,&gt; You should contribute only high-quality information.
25572,And yet “dat my state” was not removed.
25573,Literally millions of people have been killed by Michigan’s largest industry in this country.
25574,Michigan’s net contribution to untimely death is not one of the state’s strong points.
25575,A PhD in global health should know these things.
25576,False.
25577,Check your facts.
25578,This is misinformation and just plain wrong.
25579,"It's also the fact that he downplays it, tells you not to worry and that it isn't real and if it is, it isn't a big deal."
25580,Then when HE gets infected what's the first thing that happens?
25581,"He gets shipped to a military hospital to get injected and treated with high end medicine unavailable to the general population AND THEN comes back saying he's immune and covid isn't a big deal, don't let it control you."
25582,Just un fucking believable
25583,"The current official death tally for the United States, which the CDC reports, is deaths involving COVID-19, which is total deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19."
25584,"It says so on this page: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm if you look at the total deaths involving COVID, which is the current official national death count, there is a footnote explaining this."
25585,"Again I’m not arguing for anti-vaxxers or covid deniers, I’m just explaining the reason they might think this."
25586,Obviously there haven’t been any deaths we know of caused by the vaccine at this point.
25587,"I mean, the UK is doing things by age and vulnerability... so these old guys will get it soon

My grandmother had her first dose on Tuesday, it’s not like normal people are being excluded"
25588,And meanwhile where I am (Canada) people are saying it’s just the flu and everyone is overreacting and are acting like hypochondriacs.
25589,We’re in for one hell of a surprise because our Hospitals just released a statement about getting ready for surge capacity.
25590,Our Hospitals are already designed to run at 90% so idk how they’re going to mange covid patients on top of that.

25592,He only lives there half the year or less.
25593,The guy is 81 lol he’s entitled to the vaccine as one of the prioritised groups.
25594,"He hasn’t paid for it, it’s only available via our national health service so his money/game has nothing to do with him being eligible to get it."
25595,Somehow that might be even worse in the antivaxxer's mind.
25596,Lol
25597,Right.
25598,But don’t we also celebrate Thanksgiving in the Midwest?
25599,Why aren’t cases exploding there?
25600,Honest question- we were told there would be a tsunami of cases.
25601,SoCal and a handful of other states are seeing that massive wave but most states aren’t.
25602,I think Her Majesty is down to one dog unfortunately.
25603,I think the Dorgi died recently (dachshund/corgi).
25604,I hope I’m mistaken but I think I read it.
25605,The Placebo effect comes from you believing that it is real medicine.
25606,You can't just give yourself a skittle and pretend it's medicine and have it magically work because you know it's a skittle.
25607,Placebo's work because a person thinks it should.
25608,Simply believing that you are not ill does have quite an amazing impact on feeling better.
25609,"This obviously can't replace everything, like you wouldn't start having psychedelic hallucinations off of a placebo alone just cause you thought it was something else."
25610,"sure thing buddy youre hired, heres $15 for your first hour and no bathroom breaks you gotta shit your pants like a [true patriot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EoFlTMEXMAgZLkR?format=jpg&amp;name=small)"
25611,"Because it wasn't enforced, just bragged about."
25612,That is definitely a possibility.
25613,Certainly I've been worried about testing constraints for a couple of months now as I know the availability of the necessary reagents is awfully tight and does not permit dramatic scaling up from this level.
25614,Without a broad national testing system that uses proper statistical methods to sample the entire population instead of those actively looking for a COVID diagnosis it'll be extremely hard to properly model this infection.
25615,I'm waiting for the spin.
25616,"If there is anything I have learned, it is that this crowd can spin anything."
25617,"And on the other side of the spectrum, Desantis says that maybe we should just give everyone we can one dose and that could be enough rather than holding back the second dose and giving it 30 days later per protocol..."
25618,It's almost like we should have had the federal government help each state figure this out or something.
25619,This is seriously so pathetic.
25620,I just can’t help but laugh anymore.
25621,I moved with on life many months ago like a normal human being.

25625,Japan and Korea running out of hospital beds must mean they Aren't testing enough.
25626,"Their numbers are so low, but hospitals don't lie"
25627,Ok so you want me to take the 90% antibody results as hard fact and stop wearing a mask completely?
25628,In that case why don’t we all stop following guidelines?
25629,Everybody already had it anyways and their sending healthcare workers back positive.
25630,"You’re right let’s not have a mind of our own and look at both sides of the picture and make calculated decisions, I got my answer already let’s just cough on everyone and everything."
25631,The people who do responsible financial/family planning aren't the one's having kids this year.
25632,"The people who are, are not doing those things and might have accidentally/purposely ended up with kids with or without the pandemic."
25633,I mean it wasn't enforced and the residents didn't care.
25634,Make all the rules you want but when no cops want to enforce (and become even more hated in a large group of people)  it is just fluff.
25635,Reinfections are incredibly rare.
25636,I’m guessing you didn’t read any of the studies.
25637,"We actually do know mild cases generate a robust immune response, so all your conjecture is just Bullshit."
25638,"Here’s some more studies if you care to read, if not stfu."
25639,You’re little anecdotes don’t mean anything.
25640,"Sure, long covid defines as “brain fog” and “tiredness” lasting a few weeks, might not be so rare."
25641,"But real long term damage will only happen on a small minority of severely ill patients, like the flu, not enough to warrant significant restrictions or worry

there's a limited amount of doses, each person who gets it early means another person gets it late"
25646,He’s not jumping the line.
25647,"Over 80s in the uk are being prioritised for the vaccine alongside other vulnerable groups like those on care homes and frontline health workers etc - him getting the vaccine has nothing to do with his fame/money, but is probably the reason why it made the news and was picked up by the media"

25651,"Yeah, there was an interview with one of the first people in the UK to get it."
25652,He was just some random grandpa.
25653,He said he called the hospital where he always goes and asked if they were giving the shots.
25654,They told him to come by around noon and he got it and went home.

25656,Im glad the people most important to me are getting it :)
25657,I hate that this has to be reiterated on a daily basis.
25658,I'm assuming the people pushing for elementary and middle schools to be shut down don't have children and a career.
25659,I see no issue with it.
25660,"My experience was that every school I attended required proof of vaccination, kindergarten through grad school."
25661,"Institutions have the choice to make it a requirement and, given public schools doing it, it would seem the government has some ability to do it as well (though I don't suspect they will)."

25667,This image offers a striking example of exactly what happens to cells in the human airway when this coronavirus infects them.
25668,This colorized scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung cells (purple) covered in hair-like cilia (blue).
25669,Those cilia line the inner surface of the airways and help to clear mucus (yellow-green) containing dust and other debris from the lungs.

This priority list is as follows:

residents in a care home for older adults and their carers

all those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers

all those 75 years of age and over

all those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals

all those 65 years of age and over

all individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality

25690,People have lost loved ones and businesses have closed and the whole world has ground to a halt and vaccine conpiracy theorists just want people to pay attention to THEM instead??

25697,I don't think there's going to be any concessions made by someone who believes that.
25698,"Even if it is a major pain, worldwide the major bottleneck is in the supply of the vaccines, not the administering time, so it feels like it's worth the effort if its doable."
25699,They call the current health crises not a serious one.
25700,Can they agree not to use medical resources if they get sick?
25701,I think a trade could be made.
25702,"I mean, California’s population is larger than most countries in the world."
25703,They won't need a pay increase if they get the vaccine.

25715,Taking my family fishing later.
25716,I got alll day to go back and forth with your crap
25717,Basically yes.
25718,Our NHS is contacting all those in the groups prioritised to get the vaccine first via their GPs or care homes (depending on what group you fall into).
25719,So Sir Ian probably did get a letter in the post from his doctor saying he was eligible for the vaccine and to make an appointment ASAP to come and get it.
25720,"Majority of people in the UK will be registered with a local doctor (GP = general practitioner), which tends to be your gateway into the national health service."

25745,"The vaccine will prevent the type of systemic infection that leads to symptoms, but it’s possible to still harbor some amount of virus."
25746,"However, a vaccinated person with a greatly reduced viral load should in theory be less likely to transmit it because a) they’re less likely to aerosolize it via sneeze or cough and b) they’ll deposit much less of the virus if they cough/sneeze/rub their eyes and touch a door handle/etc."
25747,I’m speculating only based on the fact that the amount of virus an uninfected person comes in contact with affects how likely they are to then develop a systemic infection.
25748,We don’t have good real-world data yet so everyone should still protect themselves to the fullest extent possible.
25749,What a weird comparison.
25750,I agree but it's too early to start with this.
25751,It's going to make it more difficult to give out the vaccine.
25752,"Let those who want to wait, wait."
25753,It will all be used.

25766,"The saddest part about this is that it was widely known, yet few did anything to prevent what’s happening now and the tsunami keeps building."
25767,And... we didn’t know the severity of long Covid back then.
25768,That’s a pretty sad and scary variable that makes this even more complicated.
25769,What would have been helpful would have been the government to tell the TRUTH and not that it was going to magically go away by Easter... by summer... by winter... it was all a game.

25781,Lmao.

25783,Not all Americans need a vaccine.
25784,Small children won't be getting it.

25795,"Considering that most mild cases didn't get tested during the first wave, we don't even know how many second wave infected were infected before."
25796,"And we don't even have proper data on the prevalence of long covid, but it isn't all that rare."

25939,"&gt; Experts have warned that credulous coverage of fringe and misleading anti-vaccine misinformation — coverage that doesn’t explicitly state that the information is false — can cause real-world harm, including a hesitancy among some people to get vaccinated that threatens to undermine the pandemic response."
25940,"Local television news is a particularly important source of information about the pandemic, as it’s consistently the most popular source Americans turn to for news, according to the Pew Research Center."
25941,This is one of the ways in which I think many public health agencies have fallen down.
25942,There's no reason why every single news station in the country has not been provided with the contact information for a person within their local health unit to comment on any medical story involving public health.

26000,The profit center is going to be in years to come.
26001,"This opens up a whole new field of diseases they can immunize against, which means new products, that can be made more cheaply (they developed the COVID-19 vaccine in like... two days, everything since then has been trials and mass production), with tech that people now trust because they've already *had* an mRNA vaccine and it was fine."
26002,"I'm surprised, but not unduly so, that J&amp;J are delaying to refine the tech since they can't be first to market."

26160,*
26161,I have relatives in their 80s who’ve had their first vaccine shot too.
26162,Healthcare workers are being done at the same time.
26163,Patients who came in with COVID and no mask.
26164,"She’s a nurse, remember?"
26165,"&gt; Because the 80 year old has a higher than 10% chance of passing away if they catch the virus and the healthcare worker doesn't 

Oh yes, now tell me."
26166,"Who is more likely to catch the virus at all, the 80 y-o that spends his whole day in his mansion and isn't forced to go out at all or the medic that spends every day with infected people and also has to go out to buy groceries and such?"
26167,Not yet.
26168,"Health and Human Services Director Alex Azar said Tuesday night that they were rolling out a tracking dashboard [""within a week""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/keaitm/hhs_secretary_azar_says_the_public_will_get_covid/gg1a97g/)."
26169,"The number of multigeneration families is not small these days, especially not amongst minorities."
26170,You're making the same argument that people were making about how the majority shouldn't have to change their lifestyles just cause seniors in the senior homes were all dying.
26171,They aren't the majority.
26172,I realize those kids will live which is better than the seniors.
26173,"And the seniors that die, covid deaths seem like pure torture to me, all alone and not being able to breathe,"
26174,"Limited Edition vaccine bro, get it while it's hot!"
26175,I thought *y'all* was just a regional pronoun.
26176,"No, we’re going in priority order."
26177,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55045639
26178,"We do have state required ratios, but it’s no good if we can’t hire the bodies."
26179,The facility just gets fined instead.
26180,"Yes but there’s this thing called immigration, where people from other countries can become US citizens."
26181,"If we’re ever at the point where global deaths exceed global births, then this would be a good topic for discussion."
26182,Different goals.
26183,The first gulf war was fought because an ally was under occupation by a neighboring dictatorship.
26184,"Within a few weeks we pushed them out of Kuwait, and turned the 5th largest land army in the world into a non-issue."
26185,Within a month we could have taken Baghdad.
26186,But we didn’t.
26187,Because they realized that a power vacuum in the Middle East would cause far more problems than saddam did.
26188,"So having ruined Iraq’s offensive capabilities we left, because that’s all the situation called for."
26189,"We didn’t occupy, we didn’t try to build a new government, we didn’t try to fight a sectarian war."
26190,That’s why it was successful and OIF was doomed from the start.
26191,"One had a clear, and honestly reasonably justified goal, at least as far as war can be justified, which is of course debatable

The other had no goal and no purpose and no justification."
26192,"This is really terrible and sad, and it's unconscionable that the CDC hasn't addressed it."
26193,These folks need to be vaccinated ASAP!
26194,I say this as someone who is immunocompromised.
26195,"I am fortunate to be able to work from home, and I'm happy to keep my butt out of stores and restaurants for the indefinite future so that people who really need the vaccine quickly can get it."
26196,When things go well.
26197,"Yes, I your king did it."
26198,"When shit hits the fan, We failed."
26199,"No, people like *you* are part of the problem, because you're going on a form of social media to ask a serious question like that."
26200,"Go online and start researching, it is not that hard."
26201,You should be willing to do that; no matter what someone else may tell you.
26202,"It's way more important to study and find the right answer for yourself, than to just ask around and settle on whatever others will say."
26203,"Go educate yourself; it will be good for you, especially on such a serious subject."
26204,&gt; Are you actually suggesting that we vaccinate all our vulnerable older people.... except if we decide that they are too rich and potentially have been having their shopping delivered?!
26205,"Yes, where is the wrong in realizing that Ian McKellen is much more privileged than a simple medic to wait his turn?"
26206,"The PM did critic the response though, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/15/swedish-pm-says-officials-misjudged-power-of-covid-resurgence

I guess that is how critical he can be without being charged with ministerial governance."
26207,"No, not really."
26208,If I firmly believed masks had no impact and still wore one where it wasn’t required that would be virtue signaling.
26209,As I stated up thread I believe masks have some modest impact...even if less than some others might think.
26210,What the hell is wrong with virtue signaling anyway?
26211,We live in a society.
26212,If I can make others feel a little safer by my wearing a mask during a pandemic that seems like a good enough reason to do it.
26213,"A vaccine doesn't erect an invisible force field around so that you are never exposed to a disease, it teaches your body how to identify and fight a pathogen once it enters your body."
26214,"It is unclear if all of the vaccines for covid make it so that you can't spread the virus at all in every single person, the vaccine might just mean your case is mild or asymptomatic but you still have the ability to spread it."
26215,"Spreading the virus isn't a binary state, you can shed the virus it a little for a short amount of time or you can shed it a lot for a long period of time."
26216,"The vaccine, if it doesn't provide sterilizing immunity, is over the whole population going to reduce the amount the virus spreads."
26217,"You getting the vaccine individually probably doesn't help anyone but you, but 70-80% of the population getting the vaccine combined with continuing to wear masks and distance will eliminate community spread and allow us to go back to normal."
26218,This is all explained in like every article about the vaccine.
26219,"You know, the ones quoting public health officials that are begging us to continue to wear a mask and distance into the fall."
26220,"It isn't the internet trying to be mean, it isn't evil scientists trying to ruin your summer, it is what we can do to end this (the pandemic, not the restrictions) as fast as possible."
26221,I made a post a while back making a similar remark and I recieved about -100 for that discussion altogether.
26222,Vaccinating our president should 100% be a top priority
26223,"Sars virus don't ""evolve""."
26224,Not trying to troll but sooner or later you are going to have to leave your house and re-join society.
26225,There are a few side effects with the vaccine but I think they are better than being dead.
26226," Lead Paragraphs:

According to an [alert ](https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8015608)released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday, the department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has detected the first case of a non-captive animal infected with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19: a wild mink in Utah near a fur farm with an active virus outbreak, Lee Davidson reports for the [*Salt Lake Tribune*](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/14/wild-mink-utah-is-first/)."
26227,"The survey did not conclude how the wild mink became infected with the virus, but it’s not unusual for captive minks to escape fur farms, and the virus isolated from the wild mink was indistinguishable from virus circulating in the farm."
26228,"The mink was the only wild animal carrying the virus amid ongoing testing of several species that live near the farm, including raccoons and skunks, Dina Fine Maron reports for [*National Geographic*](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/12/wild-mink-tests-positive-coronavirus-utah/)."

26230,Friend's teacher posted on FB that they had her elderly mom over for Thanksgiving despite the teacher knowing she was COVID+.
26231,&lt;Shocked face&gt; elderly mom has it and has now spent 13 days in the hospital.
26232,"&lt;insert pity story about thoughts and prayers, go fund me, etc&gt;

I really hate people."
26233,It's because we know they'll be fine.
26234,He'll go to the hospital proactively where he'll be giving all kinds of medical treatments that none of us have access to and in a week or so he'll be completely fine again.
26235,Oof.
26236,"Looks like they're repositioning a patient, maybe to prevent bedsores."
26237,"If I remember correctly, nurses/aides are more likely to suffer from serious workplace injuries than construction workers or police."
26238,Largely due to back injuries during transferring or repositioning patients.
26239,Healthcare workers are being done in parallel.

26248,"As a new parent to-be, this scenario is a quiet, gnawing terror that I can’t quite shake."
26249,I have autism but was lucky enough to still be able to be independent and successful professionally.
26250,"Having a kid like myself doesn’t worry me, but if I’m brutally honest, having a child with severe autism who will never be able to control themselves is not something I think can handle."
26251,"Being responsible for a child with violent outbursts who will forever require my care would probably leave me a broken, emotionally-disconnected, bitter husk after a few decades and I’m terrified to think that I would fail my child like that."
26252,I just cope by knowing it’s extremely unlikely to happen...
26253,Japan is really old

26255,Is that what works with you?
26256,"They really need to clarify “severe allergies”...it’s not Sinus/allergies that need claritin/Flonase, it’s MEDICAL allergies that need Epi-Pen emergency treatment..."

26259,cheers!
26260,&gt;Lusty librarian does roll off the tongue better
26261,WTF with people being anti-Down people?
26262,Anyone who would say something negative about people with Down being among the first to get the vaccine really needs to do some serious soul-searching.
26263,Priority groups are being done in parallel where possible.
26264,Front line healthcare workers are getting vaccinated already too.
26265,"Nope, that’s why I said he isn’t next."
26266,There’s no relevant difference between a symptomatic and pre symptomatic.
26267,None are showing symptoms.
26268,At least one of the gunshot deaths was a hunting accident where a guy was shot by someone else in his party (not sure about the other one).
26269,Grand County isn’t a raging hotbed of violent crime.
26270,"The county was also devastated by the East Troublesome fire in October, which shut down one entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park until last week and the county is also home to a major ski resort (Winter Park)."
26271,"They’re desperate to keep tourists dollars flowing in right now so I’m not surprised they’re trying to make their COVID numbers look as good as possible, but Colorado has been tracking the two numbers (deaths among cases and deaths due to COVID) separately since I think May, so this guy can STFU."

26274,This virus itself came about from a hop.
26275,AIDS was a hop.

26278,"Really, though, you’re a fool if you sign something like that."
26279,Why would you attend in the first place?
26280,We need to start holding people accountable for contributing to our public health crisis.
26281,Why should everyone else suffer because of those who refused to do their part?
26282,"If we detained people indefinitely for being in public without a properly worn mask, I’m pretty sure a lot of people would avoid that by wearing a mask."
26283,"And by segregating those who are actually causing the surge, we lower community spread."
26284,Just vaccinate the staff who work at the detention facilities so they aren’t taking it home.
26285,wow
26286,How about video evidence of the inventor of PCR testing openly saying Fauci knows nothing about the body?
26287,Makes a lot of sense.

26304,I'm glad some people have the guts to be guinea pigs.
26305,This vaccine has not been researched and I'm sorry but exactly when did the government or anyone have the best interest in people at heart.
26306,The answer is never.
26307,What?
26308,Key man insurance.
26309,You guys can be the 5 year guinea pigs haha.
26310,Im smooth
26311,I wasn’t allowed to say anything but it's now okay for me to share that I volunteered for a Covid-19 vaccine trial.
26312,The vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia.
26313,"I received my first dose this morning, and I wanted to let you all know that it is safe snd I’m ok, with иo side effects whatsoeveя, and that I feelshκι я чувю себя немного стрно и я думю, что вытл осные уши."

26316,&gt;Only 2.5% of the total number of deaths comes from the three-month period Aug 1 to Oct 31.

26357,That’s insane.
26358,"Age, diabetes, immune compromised, etc."
26359,The only exception I see is for front line health care workers.

26364,"I think the most stark reminder of American culture vs everyone else's is how acceptable the argument ""I won't be inconvenienced just so other people can live"" has turned out to be."
26365,Sweden reports deaths in a different way than other countries so there is a constant backlog which makes the curve of deaths seems to decline all the time even when the death toll is rising.
26366,"It is described here:

[https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting)

Here you can see that reported deaths has increased by 514 in the last week but that is deaths that happened about two weeks ago."
26367,"[https://platz.se/coronavirus/](https://platz.se/coronavirus/)

IHME estimates that we have around 80 deaths a day now and in an increasing trend."
26368,"[https://covid19.healthdata.org/sweden?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend](https://covid19.healthdata.org/sweden?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend)

But I based my prediction on this site  
[https://adamaltmejd.se/covid/](https://adamaltmejd.se/covid/)

It was however updated with a new model just today so now it looks as there is only 60 deaths per day."
26369,When I wrote my comment that site estimated around 110 deaths per day for Sweden.
26370,I need some help in the R and D department.
26371,"So we agree that the vaccine is the best choice, right?"
26372,I didn't know that and would like to follow the research.
26373,Can you post a link if you're not too busy?
26374,What?
26375,"Teachers are around anywhere from 100-200 kids a week, and the high school aged students are the ones doing dumb shit like getting boba maskless with friends, wearing their masks at school with their noses hanging out, breaking distancing rules to vape with their friends in the bathroom."
26376,Why shouldn't teachers get the vaccine before seniors?
26377,They're a lot more likely to be exposed; the kids that are still coming to school instead of opting for online teaching are almost always the kids of anti-masking covid-denying parents.
26378,"So yeah, I get that seniors are old, and that's dangerous, but teachers have been working really hard in extremely dangerous conditions with very little support since last March."
26379,"We are all lucky teachers haven't gone on strike yet; their working conditions are abhorrent in some districts, even the ""affluent"" ones with good reputations."

26385,[deleted]
26386,The average age of death was 84 or something like that.
26387,Combine this with the fact that 2019 fewer deaths than usual you can be absolutely certain that most people that died with covid wouldn't have seen 2021 and probably 90% wouldn't have seen 2023

I agree with jcontact; I think that wearing a proper mask properly shows compassion, empathy, caring, and intelligence."
26401,"Only fools or the weak would think wearing a mask makes them look weak, IMHO."
26402,"I consider it a silver lining of this pandemic that because of the masking issue it's super easy to spot the sociopathic, idiotic, brainwashed assholes in the world."
26403,"Whether they realize it or not, they're outing themselves to the world every time they don't wear a mask, wear an ineffective mask, or wear it incorrectly, and I hope the rest of the world remembers each and every one of them."

They won’t let women drive but they’re allowed to inject vaccines."

26439,I have a bad feeling the people who aren't reproducing now are the ones you wanted to and vice versa.
26440,I honestly predict that people will behave like the vaccine brand they got will be worth discussing or showing off.
26441,"""Oh, you got the Johnson &amp; Johnson?"
26442,"That's great for you, yeah, really accessible product."
26443,"They make baby shampoo, don't they."
26444,Neat.
26445,Yeah...
26446,I got the Pfizer.
26447,"You know, the company that makes boners."
26448,"They said this vaccine was super difficult to acquire, had to use really space age tech to transport it."""
26449,"&gt; People just won't engage their noodle, they have the capability."

26452,Either way their actions produce the same results.
26453,"Good to know, and again, thanks for the information."
26454,Nah.
26455,Just drinks.
26456,It was a pretty cool experience.
26457,"As of this morning, here's a ranking of all US states by total per capita deaths:

The Northeast states still on top, but others are rising fast."
26458,"And a ranking by 7-day per capita deaths (hot zones):

Some pretty impressive numbers for the Iowa and the Dakotas."

26463,"Well some of it was backlog of tests that came in, but still, California is fucked right now and it is not going to get any better any time soon."
26464,You people?
26465,Thanks.
26466,And oh do I question it.
26467,Why the fuck is he getting vaccinated first?
26468,I’m a divorce and criminal defense attorney.
26469,It’s a record-shattering year.
26470,You're a moron.
26471,You don't prevent a virus or any other illness for that matter by running away from it.
26472,That's why we have immune systems.
26473,"But for our immune systems to work efficiently, they need practice."
26474,"Germs are a natural part of life, illness and death are a natural part of life."
26475,"Following the WHO and CDC guidelines is the problem because those measures, like masks and frequent hand washing, make the virus stronger and people weaker."
26476,"People need to get off their asses, exercise, interact with others, eat healthy foods -- that is the way to fight off illness, not cowering in your house watching Netflix."

26482,"It's way too late for that, I'm afraid."
26483,Even if all of humanity disappeared the damage is done and the Earth will continue to warm to some unknown point as it's become a partial positive feedback cycle as the soil gives up more carbon as it warms and methane seeps from under previously frozen ice.
26484,We need some amount of excess labor power now in order to manufacture and deploy whatever fictional technology we are going to try to use to save ourselves.
26485,"Not to be a downer on carbon capture, it DOES work, but...we are going to need a lot of plants built."
26486,Ten million or so.
26487,They supposedly did their reviews concurrently with the FDA.
26488,Pfizer and the US government have been going back and forth on their involvement in Warp Speed.
26489,Pfizer says they didn't use any of that money for 'development' of the vaccine.
26490,The US government says 'we bought the vaccines untested and unproven under the Warp Speed umbrella'.
26491,I 'get' both sides if they want to argue semantics.
26492,Long story short the US government has dropped a LOT of dollar dollar bills on a number of vaccines and therapies ... many unproven just to encourage numerous companies to get into this business without fear of failure or financial ruin since we are basically buying stuff they are researching before they finish it.
26493,It has also allowed these companies to start producing their products before approval is granted so when approval happens we aren't waiting on production lines to get started.

26506,Or as if that is even a thing.
26507,Something wrong with Washington's 7-day numbers?
26508,Incomplete?
26509,Seems strange for it to be that much lower than anything else in the continental United States.
26510,Yea
26511,Thats really disgusting what california is doing.
26512,I thought you guys were as liberal as my state Oregon so would still have schools closed.
26513,Newsom is a murderer as far as I'm concerned.

26516,Exactly!
26517,"About 4 people that I know who are my age (20-30) and who already are negative mentioned shortness of breath, pains in their chest or head, loss of smell or taste."
26518,All of them have been negative for at least 2+ months.
26519,That's why I prefer to not catch it until after I've been vaccinated.
26520,"""Yeah you're right, your vaccine will be fine, not worth pointing out that it has 75% efficacy."
26521,"You know... it's not exactly 95%, but it's still good."

26530,Not everybody who does it is as awesome as you are.
26531,What are we gonna do if our enemies start using bio-weapons against us?
26532,This pandemic has exposed the flaws in our healthcare system and exposed a blind spot in our National Security.
26533,What are we gonna do if our enemies create a virus that's far more deadly than Covid?

""Harald married a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, at Oslo Domkirke in Oslo on 29 August 1968."
27071,"The pair had dated for nine years, but Olav was reluctant to allow his son to marry a commoner."

27380,Sweden has become a bit of a laughing stock around the world.
27381,"How is that going to affect your ""human dignity""?"
27382,"As for democracy, tell me, who elected Anders Tegnell?"
27383,Who elected any of the people at FHM?
27384,These unelected bureaucrats have made decisions that cost thousands of lives and can't even be voted out.
27385,Where is your democracy now?
27386,That user above you has mysteriously managed to misrepresent the goal of Iraq and Afghanistan.
27387,Wasn't it all *suppoooooosed* to be about WOMD?
27388,Unless...
27389,No.
27390,We've had recommendations.
27391,The only restrictions was and is really on any event that requires a permit.
27392,And for venues as restaurants and similar.
27393,"But, you can freely throw a party and invite as many as you please without any legal ramifications."
27394,Or walk without masks on.
27395,Or randomly stand close to people.
27396,Swedes are not good at following recommendations.
27397,"It’s not just the deaths, if all the icu beds are taken by covid patients then where are the people who need icu from car crashes, burns, sepsis etc going to go?"
27398,They will sit in the ED and wait for a bed or get transferred to another hospital if they are lucky.
27399,This lack of beds will cause more deaths.
27400,"Why are you asking me I didn't make it, contact pfizer or the other companies that made it."
27401,You should spend less time on r/conspiracy

27403,erectile dysfunction.
27404,i had it for about six months after i got covid in march.
27405,may have just been anxiety but many reports indicate covid damages testes.
27406,"lol and see, that's why you get so much push back from the population now."
27407,So many contradictory rules  and actions by the local leadership.
27408,I’m in so cal and I can say that about 90% of the people I know who had/have covid all caught it around Thanksgiving.
27409,I’ve lost track of how many people I know that did.
27410,My best friend’s stepdaughter’s family took covid over to the grandparents house on thanksgiving.

27420,"Is a curious reality you live in where the individuals such as low-level Tyson employees have all the money in the world to pay for these lawyers to bring frivolous suits, but *poor little* Tyson doesn't have money to then defend itself, and must instead rely on Big Government to shield businesses from any and all responsibility."
27421,While Big Government already gave out billions in PPP loans to ... the very same businesses.
27422,*Shudder* -- big businesses would have a financial reason to apply Capital to improve the Work Environment to lower the likelihood of Catching Diseases In The Workplace.

27442,Sweden: *shocked Pikachu face*
27443,Like I said most people are not affected like this.
27444,Sure it happens to some but what about the fact that half of all obese people are in 10 countries.

27451,Is that some kind of sex thing
27452,I saw a post today being shared by dummies on Facebook that actually says the US has herd immunity and that’s why the pandemic ended so the vaccine is unnecessary.
27453,I can’t even begin to understand how someone can think that’s remotely true.
27454,"I mean...if you would have asked me that direct question, I would have guessed that America would lose that war."
27455,"&gt;you don’t understand what is even happening in order to be suspicious in the first place

You’ve just described Americans."
27456,Weather definitely plays its part.
27457,"Now that it's freezing in many northern cities it's impossible to meet outside to chat and catch up, restaurant patios are closed, and people are just generally doing indoors stuff now where even the best public area ventilation is vastly inferior to open air and mild wind."
27458,Do you have a reference for all this or are you particularly familiar with multi dose vaccine vials yourself?
27459,"It says ""if you follow the manufacturer's directions very specifically"" there are 6 doses, implying they were in fact not following the instructions, which is just kind of funny."

27463,Sweden is not to blame for the Western media's failures.

27471,Average age in Belgium 41.64 (2018).

27483,It sounds like you've never talked to any of those people.
27484,"They're not skeptical of the science, they're skeptical of the media, the politicians and regulations."
27485,"No one is giving  up 30 months of their life, got bad news for ya babe"
27486,That's a fucking contrived example.
27487,Why are there a bunch of vulnerable un-vaccinated people at a party sharing bottles?
27488,"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/02/science/charting-a-coronavirus-infection.html

The vaccine means that your immune system is able to lop off that viral load curve at its knees."
27489,I think that people have been generous with you because sure it might be technically possible for a vaccinated person to contract the virus and spread it before their immune system can squash it.
27490,"It's going to be unlikely, very unlikely, and require  a constellation of unlucky coincidences."
27491,"But if you're going to throw around terms like ""superspreader"", then you're taking the generosity of argument WAY TOO FAR."
27492,Vaccinated people are definitely not going to be spreading the virus as well as unvaccinated people.

27497,It's a minor inconvenience while we look for a vaccine.
27498,"But now there's a vaccine, and I don't *want* to wear a mask all the time."
27499,"If you want to, great."
27500,That's totally fine.

27511,People on this sub have been more bent on defending Sweden from misinformation that has become popular on here.
27512,"The Swedes in that other thread, actually living in Sweden, have an accurate understanding of the situation so their criticism should be held in higher esteem."
27513,I think the worse is that the vaccine is finally out and news companies are pushing for FURTHER compliance.
27514,Listen.
27515,I wear my mask and I socially distance.
27516,I've been doing that for a while.
27517,I was told to wait for the vaccine.
27518,Guess what!
27519,I waited!
27520,And now they're trying to tell me that I'll have to continue doing this bullshit after I get the vaccine because of some made up reason??

27709,"&gt; More people die of smoking every year

Which is really an excellent point."
27710,Smoking in a rational world would have been banned long ago.
27711,Instead the smoking industry waged a very effective propaganda campaign to sew doubt into our country at large.
27712,Something that has stood as a template for many disinformation campaigns since.
27713,Politician endorsement would make it worse.
27714,Like if a video comes out with Hillary Clinton saying to take Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine there will be reactionary response to throw it any drug made by Pfizer.
27715,We are better off not doing that and getting a wide selection of celebrities to join up a campaign.

SAN FRANCISCO (KABC) -- The ICU capacity in the 11-county Southern California region has dropped to 0% amid a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases, officials said Thursday."
27779,The announcement does not necessarily mean there are no intensive care unit beds available.
27780,The state adjusts the percentage downward if counties have a higher-than-expected ration of COVID-19 patients occupying ICU space.
27781,"News of the diminished ICU capacity came as the state announced the deaths of 379 Californians, marking the highest number of fatalities in one day since the pandemic began and surpassing the previous record set the previous day."
27782,"The state reported another 52,281 new cases of the virus, just 1,400 cases less than what California saw the day prior."

&gt;It is possible that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could reduce severity of  disease but lead to prolonged shedding of infectious virus, which could  have important consequences for public health if shedding resulted in  increased transmission."

27978,Context for non-Swedes: Örebroare is the demonym of people from the town of Örebro.
27979,The king said this in a speech when addressing the people of the town of Arboga.
27980,This happened in 1985 and we're still laughing about it.

27987,Thank you.
27988,That is a very interesting list.
27989,I'm especially intrigued by the bullet point that people who have Tuberculosis should not get the chickenpox or MMR vaccines.
27990,But my point stands.
27991,I'm generally sympathetic to the argument that it is our responsibility to build herd immunity and protect the vulnerable among us who can't get the vaccine.
27992,"But this is not a ""weakened version of the virus"" type of vaccine."
27993,A compromised immune system is *not* a reason to not get *this* vaccine.
27994,the immuno-compromised??!

28015,A leader cares for and tends their people.
28016,I'd be suspicious of the source of that figure.
28017,Trump's handling of the virus was so bad it appeared like he was actually trying to make it worse and IMHO he single-handedly doubled the severity of it.

28026,You're trying to fit the data to your hypothesis.
28027,What we are experiencing in the US is the seasonality of the virus.
28028,Its following the same epidemiological curve in each temporal region regardless of interventions
28029,"They need to save it for a rainy day, in case the pandemic gets bad."
28030,That argument is empty - it literally doesn't matter how many people would have died of what in some other decade.
28031,Such a thing is irrelevant except for one use: comparison to understand how deadly covid is.
28032,"The bottom line, the only thing that matters, is that NONE of those dead covid people should have died at all, because covid could have been limited and stopped if intelligent action had been taken in January."
28033,They are additional deaths.
28034,They are people dying ON TOP of everything else.

28061,"It said the one of the reasons Bernadotte was picked by Sweden is that during a battle in which Bernadotte was the commanding general, a bunch of Swedish soldiers were taken prisoner by Bernadotte."
28062,He treated them with such respect that the Swedish officers never forgot about this.
28063,"When they were released, they went back to Sweden and some of the officers ended up in serving in Parliament."
28064,"When Sweden went shopping for a new King, some of the former officers remembered how Bernadotte had treated them and brought up his name as a suitable replacement."
28065,It also helped that Bernadotte was also known as a fair man and a man of his word.
28066,Being connected to Napoleon when Napoleon had half of Europe under his control also helped.

28076,"Sweden was actively pushing herd immunity, told citizens masks do nothing, and enacted very loose restrictions."
28077,"America was disorganized, due to our constitutional situation."
28078,Generally public policy measures (as they relate to health) are left to the 50 states.

28084,Pfizer should refuse to send any more doses to the Tennessee government until these thousand are in people's arms.
28085,No reason to send more doses into this stockpile.

28088,"i know the vaccine won't drop deaths to zero but if they dropped to say 100 per day even 200 per day across the whole country it will not be politically expedient to have restrictions and as we all know, if politicians are good at one thing they are good at being political"

28161,Not necessarily.
28162,We've now hit the \~93 deaths per 100k people in the united states.
28163,The worst counties in the US have somewhere between 400-600 deaths per 100k people.
28164,"Assuming 80% of the people in those worst hit counties have been infected, that would mean that around 10-20% of people in the US have been infected."
28165,That's enough to start slowing the spread of the virus.
28166,"Not full herd immunity, but eventually enough to slow the spread to where fewer people are in the hospital the next day vs the last day."
28167,Especially if people in hard hit places wear masks and take more precautions.
28168,"Also, we're burning through the population at around 0.1-0.3% of the population per day, depending on how many real cases are detected of the whole population."
28169,"That and we're probably vaccinating around 200-300k people per day, or at least in the next few weeks we'll be up to that rate."
28170,Maybe even higher.

28522,J&amp;J won't even reach the 2 month median safety data requirement until the end of January.

28580,You’re playing both sides of the issues for clicks and controversy.
28581,Disgusting ghouls.

28586,oh no
28587,I am fully acknowledging the difference between sex and gender and I don't understand the point of the first paragraph here.
28588,"A ""male"" person, which I am defining as having testes and sex organs consistent with an XY chromosome pairing, can have any gender identity, i.e."
28589,"they could be biologically male but be a woman, man, or anything in-between."
28590,"When I say a""'male' with sex organs of a typical biological female will not be able to have children"", I'm responding to the above commenter and acknowledging that testes are not exclusive to someone who has a penis."
28591,"*However*, someone who has internal sex organs that do not correspond with their outward sexual traits cannot generally have kids."
28592,This would be cases like where someone is intersex and has testes with a vulva.
28593,"Someone who has ovaries but does not have a vulva cannot carry children, and thus they are not important to this specific article where we talk about having kids."
28594,"And to your hypothetical, wouldn't a trans man be just as uncomfortable being reminded that they have ovaries?"
28595,"The distinction between ""person with ovaries"" and ""female"" for a trans person is not really relevant to the point I or the other commenter were making."
28596,&gt; Why 'should there'?
28597,Because they claimed they'd be producing already for half a year?
28598,Did you read *any* news?
28599,What the fuck is your problem?
28600,You can't do basic math?
28601,They plan for the vaccination **TO TAKE A FULL YEAR OR LONGER**.
28602,Go and arrest the fucking idiots who screwed this up.
28603,Is this becoming a he said / she said situation?
28604,"Administration: Pfizer has production issues

Pfizer: We gave you everything we agreed to give you, when we agreed to give it to you, and where you specified."
28605,It is not confidence inspiring to see the public political volleyballing.

28607,"yeah thanks for the spikes in cases

but.... it's not his fault."
28608,He should have been receiving aid from the gov't.
28609,Yet here we are.
28610,Yea I am getting really tired of the forever shifting goal posts.
28611,If you don't know fucking say you don't know.
28612,This is going to erode public trust so fast.
28613,It’s sad that the news of another safe and effective vaccine has less than 1/8th the upvotes of yet another post about records in such and such community being broken.
28614,Shit is crazy right now but there’s literally millions of vaccine doses going out before January.
28615,Come on!
28616,I called them a few days ago asking how to be unblinded (as I'm trying to get on the high-risk lists) and they informed me then.
28617,They also sent out an email on Tuesday letting everyone know they'll begin vaccinations in 1-2 weeks.
28618,If he gives up his spot it looks like he doesn't trust the vaccine.
28619,If he takes the vaccine people cry privilege.
28620,No win here.
28621,"Not saying I am more deserving then healthcare workers by any means, but I have been going to work throughout this entire pandemic working in food manufacturing and testing."
28622,"Right now under my current work conditions its absolutely impossible to social distance and my work will not enforce their mask policy they put into place (meaning that if people have it somewhere on their person even as a chinstrap, it's acceptable.)"
28623,"I am very surprised and grateful I haven't gotten COVID yet, but is it likely I could be lumped in with essential workers in the second vaccine wave or would i need to wait until its more available to the general population?"
28624,Rip.
28625,I hope they can be together in the after.
28626,Fuck this virus.
28627,You shall not pass!
28628,This is terrible.
28629,"It's easy to be mad at them for not taking precautions to prevent spreading it, but we have to remember COVID is the enemy here."
28630,Nobody asked for this.
28631,This isn't normal.
28632,"This family was still living a modified life, it just wasn't modified enough."
28633,They weren't deniers.
28634,I don't blame them for trying to be normal.
28635,"Covid killed the family members, even if they let their guards down."
28636,It's a really shitty situation for everyone.
28637,Depends how they do it.
28638,Olympic villages would be pretty easy to create a bubble with or without a vaccine.
28639,And you don't need foreign spectators- I can't imagine a situation where Japan just lets people in.
28640,I went hiking near gatlinburg and went to stop at a Walgreens to pick up some toilet paper and gatlinburg looked like times square on new years eve.
28641,I had a full on panic attack.
28642,The Walgreens was packed and there were many people not wearing masks.
28643,I totally get why seiver county is one of the biggest hotspots because it's a huge tourist destination and people treat the virus as if it doesn't exist.
28644,"People truly don't know what ""quarantine"" means a lot of the time."
28645,"I will say though, I understand funerals are important, but an unfortunate reality of living in a pandemic is that we should be willing to give up even those gatherings that are important to us."
28646,"I read a book recently on the Ebola crisis, and something that stuck with me was a story about families having to burn their homes with infected family members inside to prevent the spread of the virus instead of caring for the body and having funeral practices as normal."
28647,"That's just the kind of sacrifice we have to make if we want to control the spread, so I do find myself frustrated at people who continue to attend, although I am not too bothered by outdoor, socially-distanced, masked gatherings, if everyone can abide by all three of those measures at all times."

28668,There is no enforcement in California since the police are the ones in the anti mask protests ..
28669,Haha I dont get all my fucking information from Facebook.
28670,You think the government gives two 💩 about us?
28671,I'm not saying I'll never take it but I need to see more information.
28672,It is so rushed.
28673,"Of course they could, they just don’t want to."
28674,They have other plans for those vaccines.
28675,"Plans they don’t want to make public, so they tell us a lie that makes it sound like they have the best interest of the public at heart."
28676,We’ve heard a lot of these lies over the last year.
28677,I’m sure some journalists will dig into this to sort out the truth.
28678,"Also, if you haven't seen it, they have a video out showing the I believe week long process of setting up their stage."
28679,It was pretty damn cool.
28680,"For me, I'd be seeing them in New Jersey, and I seriously doubt anything in NJ/NY will allow people to be packed tightly into a GA pit."
28681,Even sitting in a seat that close will be tough.
28682,"If we figure the general public will start to vaccinate in late spring/summer, no way we will have enough people vaccinated for states to allow gatherings like that."
28683,"I do think things will be on their way to normal, but there is a big difference between that and standing up against and sweating all over each other."
28684,You have a great point about the music industry.
28685,"It is very sad, especially for those of us who love to see bands perform live."
28686,I do think there will be a middle ground for them to ease into normal.
28687,I figure concerts will be able to be had but with a more limited capacity.
28688,Figure they do that as well as sell digital packages as well.
28689,"It isn't the same as going in person, but after all this time, you bet your ass I'd pay to see a digital concert."
28690,If for nothing else to help out these bands.
28691,"Agreed, but I do think some further steps could have been taken to prevent infection."
28692,Having lunch (or any other meal) with anyone outside of one’s household at this time is not very wise.
28693,"That meeting surely could have taken place masked, without food and drinks involved."
28694,"I’m not sure if government officials outside of the US are being tested regularly to try to stay ahead of possible transmission during their daily work duties, but if they are, I’m sure it is providing a false sense of security."
28695,This shit spreading around like crazy should be getting us to herd immunity faster not slower.
28696,That makes sense.
28697,I was only asked to report symptoms.
28698,Sure.
28699,"And if a quick approval meant getting UK type of amounts for EU, the UK was at 0.2% vaccinated this morning I believe - even if they shoot up to 1% by the time EU gets started, it's not like that's a huge advantage."
28700,Yes and that is included as a secondary endpoint in their vaccine trial.
28701,However they still have to meet the primary endpoint of 50% efficacy in infection level to get approved.
28702,Biological products don’t get approved if they don’t meet their primary endpoint.
28703,You can sufficiently decrease the amount of severe infections but that doesn’t means much if you can’t sufficiently decrease the normal level of infections that can potentially become severe.
28704,"For now, anyway."
28705,"Given that this is a sudden rise, and hospitals across the state are running out of beds, It won't take long to climb that list."
28706,Has anyone had any experience with employers requiring a certain type of mask?
28707,"My dad’s employer requires him to wear a branded, company-issued mask."
28708,"The problem is that it’s a cheap, low-quality cotton mask."
28709,Normally we all wear a reusable N95-level mask.
28710,He comes into contact with the public so it’s kind of worrying that he’s so much less protected.
28711,I smoke a pack a day too.
28712,Still won't inject myself with some garbage that altars my DNA.
28713,At least with junk food I know the long term affects.
28714,"This shit, no one knows what the outcome will be."
28715,And I think its stupid we are using essential workers to find out.
28716,What happens if it backfires?
28717,"The fact that multiple people who have received the shot went into a coma, had their heart stop...some countries even have a crash unit standing by, ready to go at every place they give the vaccine."
28718,Your ok with that?
28719,Thats a good scenario for you?
28720,I appreciate you responding.
28721,Thanks for the quick take and educating me a bit
28722,I agree and can't believe more people don't realize this.
28723,"I imagine LAPD officers screaming at a South Central L.A. resident for not wearing a mask, residents come pouring out of their homes and things get ugly."

28727,"&gt; Because that was what everyone thought was best practice then, and things have changed."
28728,They changed because they were wrong.
28729,"&gt;They were wrong about it in the beginning when NOBODY knew how bad it really was

28735,That's the entire basis of how science works.
28736,Leopards ate my fried green tomatoes?
28737,There are less than 30 confirmed reinfections.
28738,You can't do any kind of analysis on those numbers regarding outcomes.
28739,Bizarre what people think sometimes.
28740,"People in congregate settings are at the highest risk of infection and are the least able to isolate, so they get prioritized."
28741,But there’s no good choices here and plenty of essential workers have pre-existing conditions and are older.
28742,"From what I’ve read elsewhere, there is subgroup prioritization given shortage of vaccine, so those essential workers more at risk are prioritized."
28743,[removed]
28744,Right now 61% of US is willing to be vaccinated and that will go up.
28745,Here’s a hint: “beds” are not the actual limited resource.
28746,“Beds” are a term that hospitalists use as a shorthand for “how many patients they can take care of”.
28747,That is limited by trained staff and medical supplies.
28748,"They can build as many beds as they want, but it won’t matter if they don’t have the medical capacity to treat those additional people."
28749,"&gt;we have no good reason to think that it is

And we have no good reason to take what's being said to us at face value either

&gt;the government already forced you to do plenty of thing, the only difference is because the vaccine is new it scares you

That's a stupid argument."
28750,Being legally required to wear clothes is not the same as being required to inject a substance we're supposed to blindly trust
28751,So don't make any holiday plans for next year too?
28752,That's racist
28753,Why 'should there'?
28754,Do you know anything at all about vaccine production and storage?
28755,Or are you just someone who whinges while other people get stuff done?
28756,I'm getting the vaccine today!
28757,I'm curious.
28758,"If the vaccine targets the spike protein, is the spike protein specific to covid-19, or is it general, and this could help with future coronaviruses?"

28772,"&gt; Health workers, police officers, the elderly and teachers will be the first to receive the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine to be made available in the first quarter of next year, the government said on Wednesday."
28773,&gt; The Ministry of Health added that people who come into contact with crowds and those with two or more medical conditions will be the first to be vaccinated against coronavirus.
28774,&gt; It estimates that the first batch of the recipients will cover 20 per cent of the country’s population.
28775,&gt; Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said Kenya has ordered 24 million doses of the vaccine as the government also explores ways of partnering with Chinese organisations that have developed Covid-19 jabs.

28811,"no, i'm not arguing one way or the other about their herd immunity, but i did want to point out that terminology used for NYC is different than other places."
28812,when people on this sub talk about NYC they were preaching gloom when it was positivity rate of 3% while other places in the country had 30%.
28813,"los angeles and other places are finding out pretty quickly how fast 3% or 1,000 cases or whatever can snowball if people arent careful, that's why those big cities have to be stricter than small areas that can withstand even 30% and ridiculous numbers."

28910,"once hotels effectively closed, they should all have been reopened for quarantine housing as part of a stimulus package for them."
28911,obviously they shouldn't pay them full room rate (if for no other reason than they wouldn't be cleaned daily) but hotels could have made back money and given to the community so to speak.

29208,"So I'm curious if that 8x is for the entire pandemic, or maybe at its worst?"

29468,So the vaccines are going to come out soon.
29469,We all know how many people are proud super spreaders and proud to avoid vaccines.
29470,Is there anything we're planning on doing to show support for getting vaccinated and to show that we ourselves have been vaccinated?
29471,Could be as simple as an arm band of a color or something?
29472,I would like to have some idea of who in the community is vaccinated to help me support their businesses and such.
29473,So which ones have openly admitted it?
29474,Or are you just saying that just because Sweden didn’t do “proper” lockdown they haven’t admitted failure?
29475,The article above.
29476,Regions within South Dakota experienced different levels of transmission due to their interventions.
29477,"At this point, other than some rural communities, South Dakota should be experiencing approximately the same level of transmission if your assertions were correct."

That could be an outlier though."
29485,Other zip codes are around 400-600.
29486,"And keep in mind, that's from the beginning on the pandemic."
29487,The death rate can be affected by other factors such as hospital care.
29488,That will show up in poor counties and ny early in the pandemic.
29489,"All of that said, 500 deaths per 100k people is really close to the 0.6% case fatality rate and 80% infection rate."
29490,He doesn't tip the instacart driver.
29491,The blame comes from the unrepentant unwillingness to admit that the current strategy isn’t working and make adjustments.
29492,Tegnell’s pride is literally killing people.
29493,"As so many Swedish Redditors have been fond of highlighting here, the rest of the government has been unable to mount an appropriate response tot he pandemic because Swedish law delegated the authority to Tegnell’s agency with a high degree of autonomy."
29494,That means the responsibility for the deaths and suffering Sweden is experiencing fall squarely on his shoulders.

29537,"&gt; At the Sundale facility in West Virginia, the arrival of the vaccine this week undoubtedly was a watershed."
29538,"Sundale was considered “ground zero” for the virus in West Virginia, said its director, Mike Hicks, after one of its residents, Shannon Taylor, fell ill with the state’s first locally acquired case of Covid-19."
29539,She was on a ventilator for several weeks but managed to recover.
29540,"&gt; As the vaccine injections began this week, Mr. Hicks said, it was only fitting that Ms. Taylor, 73, was inoculated first."
29541,&gt; “I was No.

29543,"We should not be encouraging people who have already been infected with COVID-19 to get vaccinated, at least not while there's limited supply of the vaccine."
29544,Every vaccine administered to someone with previous immunity is a vaccine that could save someone else's life.
29545,"This is shocking, not only that it's happening, but that the New York Times is highlighting it as ""fitting""."
29546,Or you can just accept that a 24 month sacrifice makes life not worth living and wait till summer and live like normal.
29547,"I would rather risk death then give up 2 years (which will soon become 3, or 4, and   so on and so on with no end in sight)"
29548,Plus homemade masks are only 20-40% effective according to CDC studies and face masks just 5% effective.
29549,"Some people seem to have come to believe that masks are 100% effective which is a religious belief, not science."
29550,That's a bloody good point.
29551,I really hope there is an investigation into these state sponsored vaccine approval committees.
29552,"As far as i can tell all they did was review the FDA press release, which if the purpose of the review was to be a double check on the FDA proves they were purely political."
29553,"It's not like the FDA would ever issue a press release saying ""yeah this vaccine sucks but we are going with it anyway""."
29554,I do not believe a single one required Pfizer or Moderna to submit to them for a formal review.
29555,"Yes, there is, dating back to April."
29556,"From a [Science Magazine article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6513/159.full):

&gt;	On 5 April, Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist for the Swedish public health authority, sent an email to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) expressing concern about proposed new advice that face masks worn in public could slow the spread of the pandemic coronavirus."
29557,"“We would like to warn against the publication of this advice,” Tegnell wrote."
29558,"How much people without symptoms contribute to spread was a “question that remains unanswered,” he wrote, and the advice “would also imply that the spread is airborne, which would seriously harm further communication and trust among the population and health care workers.”

&gt;	On 8 April, ECDC published its recommendations anyway, in line with an emerging scientific consensus."
29559,"Although questions remained, “use of face masks in the community could be considered,” it said, “especially when visiting busy, closed spaces.” Tegnell still disagrees."
29560,“We have looked very carefully.
29561,"The evidence is weak,” he told Science."
29562,"My wife said she thinks the residents are signing up in higher numbers, but she's not entirely sure."
29563,"&gt;i don't feel like I should get the vaccine so soon

You won't get it soon."

29568,Then the governing officials decided just to do what they want and not really follow the orders and then people got pissed and did what they want too.
29569,Shit for government.
29570,"I mean that was obviously bullshit but, I think it's safe to say at this point there's a very strong seasonal component."
29571,TBD still how much of that is due to heat/humidity/time outdoors/vitamin D/kids having summer off school.
29572,Mmmm... macarons.
29573,Sir that was morphine
29574,"I take COVID extremely seriously but honestly, I gotta say, they wouldn’t have been infectious already after only 24 hours post exposure (if they got it)."
29575,This is a rather amusing headline tbh.
29576,It makes it sound like he's implying covid climbs up the age ranks before targeting older citizens.
29577,is it too late for him to catch autism or is that for the babies vaccines?
29578,"anti vaxxers, whats really up?"
29579,"From the meeting right now:

29580,My local news in Michigan said we are getting 20 some thousand less than originally stated.

29582,My wife didn't think we'd come up with a vaccine for this.
29583,She's very happy to be wrong.
29584,You need to *also* look at how many are getting serious-but-not-life-threatening sickness from Covid.

29616,i don't feel like I should get the vaccine so soon cause I honestly want healthcare workers and people who are at high risk to get it first.
29617,Is this wrong and should I get the vaccine anyways or what?
29618,I don’t know.
29619,"That used to be the case, but at least the places I drive around the peninsula mask usage seems way down over the past month or two."
29620,"Tons of folks out without masks now, where I agree compliance seemed near 100% previously."
29621,People have given up.
29622,Because deaths from a War and deaths from a virus are very different.
29623,Why do you feel it is a good comparison?
29624,I would think another pandemic or illnesses like Cancer or Cardiovascular disease are a more apt comparison.
29625,Yes definitely.
29626,If I've learned anything in 2020 hardly anyone can follow the rules properly no matter what political leanings.

29775,Ideally I'll be isolating and masking up much as we have been for months now.

29791,"&gt;Yes wealth is a privilege, but this isn't wealth privilege."
29792,Not considering wealth privilege at the moment of deciding who get the vaccine first is the thing I'm criticizing.
29793,Giving a vaccine to someone with the means to live perfectly safe is wasting a vaccine that could have been given to either someone without the means to live safe during the pandemic or that due to its responsibilities cannot live safe no matter how much money they have (like a medic specially).

I haven't, I acknowledged that I was wrong there."

29797,With the asterix bring with treatment.
29798,Covid spreads so rapidly that it quickly overwhelmed out ability to treat people.

***New York, NY, December 17, 2020 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)*** today released the following statement to address public comments that allege there are issues in the production and distribution of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine: “Pfizer is not having any production issues with our COVID-19 vaccine, and no shipments containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed."
29813,"This week, we successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U.S. Government to the locations specified by them."
29814,"***We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses."
29815,***
29816,Can confirm.
29817,"My company has had a LOT of cases popping up recently, but as far I can tell, they're all on the manufacturing floor and no one of the office side."
29818,"Yeah it kind of was, but in retrospect it was better than this “new normal”."
29819,No shit
29820,Coastal San Diego and Orange Counties are one and the same--*many* people out and about like everything's normal.
29821,Watch the latter follow SD's lead.
29822,Someones bitter today
29823,I wonder this every time I see things like this.

29842,This is worse in my opinion because it hides transparency in the distribution.
29843,"By ""stockpiling"" who knows how many doses are actually physically in the stockpile."
29844,"It just becomes a number that may or not be accurate, if you know what I mean."
29845,I lived this on a small scale.
29846,Made an appointment for &lt;Big Name Pharmacy Chain Here&gt;  to give me a flu shot.
29847,I'm waiting for my shot and a guy comes off the street to try to get a flu shot.
29848,"""Sorry we are all out"", was what he was told."
29849,"Now that could be the case, that I was getting the last dose."
29850,Or it could be that they only had enough for appointments.
29851,But at the end of the day I don't know that.
29852,The guy told they're all out doesn't know that.
29853,The only ones that knows?
29854,The guys with the vaccine doses.
29855,"I find it hard to believe people in charge that took that charge so seriously that the infection rate graph looks like a roman candle on fourth of july, now want to sit on vaccine doses until their brain trust figure out how to ""equitably distribute"" them."
29856,Way to look out for the common man.
29857,After all that has been the theme of this pandemic hasn't it; the big guy looking out for the little guy.
29858,"The only thing equitably distributed through all of this, is covid."
29859,"I can almost guarantee that ""stockpile"" will be distributed sooner rather than later."
29860,People just won't hear about it
29861,Then you would lump together the tiers instead of separating them.
29862,UK has 800k shots.

29869,"I would need to leave the whole industry, because it's the same all over."
29870,I'm 60+ years old.
29871,I have no income potential even close to what I am making.
29872,"So yeah, I could leave, sell my shit, get a different shitty job with half the income."
29873,Or I can try to bring awareness to how bad it is and maybe hold them accountable through public opinion.
29874,Also using quotes around superspreader event just shows your ignorance of what's going on.

29882,It was their job to not bungle the pandemic so that the people can feed themselves you’re right.
29883,The UK has already vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people.

29895,"&gt;But despite what this subreddit thinks, in the second wave they are decidedly average."
29896,"The second wave took off way later in Sweden, is still not officially at a plateau, and they are the only country that seems intent on not issuing harsher restrictions at such a high level of community spread at the current time."
29897,"Their death toll is fairly average for the second wave, but 1 month ago it even looked good."
29898,Signs now point to Sweden again being affected badly.
29899,"The numbers are very high, and not dropping yet."
29900,"Maybe they could put you in charge, then."
29901,Open everything up.
29902,Kill a bunch of chronically ill and elderly people.
29903,That would probably be fine.
29904,Much better than preventing a widespread outbreak just before a vaccine is ready for public administration.
29905,yay humanity still exsits!
29906,love the comment.
29907,I think those dinners are pretty ‘cheap’ at like 250-500 if my memory is correct last time I looked into it.

29921,"I not sure why people downvoted your comment, if they know side effects exists they will try to fix it but if they don’t share it, how would they improve the vaccine?"
29922,Just because you can place an order doesn't mean you can actually get the vaccine before like April or May.
29923,If I'm wrong and you can?
29924,Jump on it.
29925,I would.
29926,"Yeah, I'm in LA and def not leaving my house except for food."
29927,This is really bad.
29928,"&gt;They didn't say anything about ""IT people""."
29929,"Yes, they did."
29930,"&gt;including its warehouse, grocery store and data center staff

If you have a data center where so many people are inside that you are requesting vaccine priority for its staff, you are doing something HORRIBLY wrong."
29931,I agree with you.
29932,I'm just playing devil's advocate at this point.
29933,I still have people around me that say they'll never take it.
29934,"But I'm with you, with a proper government campaign and a little confidence boost when they see a lot of other people taking it without side effect I think they'll come around."
29935,Especially when the talk about excluding non vaxers from certain events becomes reality (gotta see about that one though..)
29936,"that's why what you said ""surely there is enough data"" I have a question about."
29937,"This depends a lot on how many vaccine get's approved, which then will determine how many vaccine doses are available, which along with how willing people are willing to take the vaccine will determine how we get to herd immunity."
29938,"Dr. Fauci suggests we need to be 85% immunized, but survey shows something between 50-70% of people are willing to get the vaccine."
29939,"If only 50% get vaccinated, then it'll take longer to get there between immunized and infected people."

29943,"&gt;Do you believe young, healthy volunteers who received the placebo should get the vaccine before the elderly, those living/working in long term care facilities, frontline healthcare workers?"
29944,All because they got the placebo?

29971,Are vaccines actually on sale on the open market?
29972,You're making it sound as if the vaccine is offered by the government for $100/dose and this tech mogul wants it for free.
29973,Put it up for sale and they might actually pay for it.
29974,I’m a little late here.
29975,"But im confused, too."
29976,The articles says that fauci believes the US will reach herd immunity in late spring but he goes on to say a semblance of normalcy will return mid-fall later on in the article.
29977,How does that make sense
29978,When you scale up the vaccination there may not be time to keep watch over people and sometimes these reactions occur more than 10 minutes later.
29979,"yep, that's exactly what we have to do when we ship ultra cold across country or internationally."
29980,"We're allowed temperature excursions of so many minutes if it's within a certain percentage, so we analyze the shipping temperature and humidity from the tracking devices and analyze whether we can save the shipment or not."
29981,"Unlike other cultures, when you become old in America you often become invisible and ignored."

29983,Will Moderna be able to deliver quickly?
29984,"*How many are actually walking around the data center replacing hard  drives and handling networking equipment, versus those who are there to  work on a terminal that could just as easily be located in their house?"
29985,"*

You need a lot of people to maintain the physical side of things - security, cleaning personnel, electricians, maintenance guys, etc."
29986,Those who work remotely are already remote for a long long time.
29987,&gt; This is a valid concern no matter how little we like it.
29988,One in 300.000 would mean 1000 scaled up to the US and some allergic shocks of those will be deadly.
29989,If 10% of those are deadly (which the rate would probably be nowhere near close to that) then that is 48 minutes worth of pandemic fatalities at today's rate.
29990,"At that rate, you don't stop and you continue to vaccinate everyone."
29991,"Me, who lives across the street from a mink operation in Utah:

*Fuck*"
29992,"Wow, my comment saying the exact same earlier up the thread has been removed."
29993,Crazy
29994,As opposed to the approximately zero people that had been vaccinated a week ago?
29995,The clinical trials showed that the vaccines created a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies.
29996,Not a calendar per se but this is what I was looking for: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/03/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-timeline.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/03/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-timeline.html)

30001,"No, the H1N1 vaccine does not cause the body to express H1N1 genetic material, and even if the person is actively infected with the H1N1 virus, the Covid PCR is highly specific, it only look for Covid genetic material."
30002,"Those two viruses are very different, a swab cannot mistake one for the other any more than a paternity test is likely to declare you the father of a butterfly."
30003,It's sort of like an anti-Trump award for Fauci.

30005,In Florida and taking it seriously :( it sucks.
30006,So many people without masks and I live in a pretty liberal city of Florida.
30007,At least once a day at work someone will try and tell me to take my mask off for some weird reason.
30008,Are vaccines actually on sale so that he could pay for it?
30009,They might actually pay for it it was auctioned off to the highest bidder.
30010,Now it’s a ghost town.
30011,and when it really was declared a pandemic of course the world suddenly woke up and started to act and follow the WHO's advice as if 'pandemic' was the magic spell?
30012,"no, we all know the thing could have be declared a pandemic on 23rd january when wuhan got locked down, and the US'/trump's/americans' behaviour would be no different

in fact, there'd be cries of a globalist government trying to restrain the economy/freedoms when there's no need to worry about it."

30016,It very much includes small businesses.
30017,"Things aren't perfect, they are just much better than expected."
30018,In March/April things seemed very bleak for hospitality and tourism.
30019,With virus eliminated restaurants/cafes/bars are packed.
30020,"With no one being able to travel overseas they are going on holiday in the country so tourism is doing well too, though it hasn't been good for luxury high-end places."
30021,Another interesting quirk is the government has supported the hotel industry by using a lot of them as quarantine facilities for returning citizens.
30022,Also a lot of money that would usually be spent on travelling is being spent on housing which is causing it's own issues but has been really good for tradesmen etc.
30023,*Especially before their IT people.

30439,It doesn't take anything away from their victory.
30440,"According to the US CDC, there were 1.3 million residents in nursing homes as of 2015: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/nursing-home-care.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/nursing-home-care.htm)

That's less than 0.4% of Americans who live in nursing homes."
30441,"And less than a third of just Pfizer's week-one shipments, not at all counting Moderna next week or what Pfizer will deliver the rest of the month and in January."
30442,"Nursing homes account for 110,000 covid deaths, or more than 1/3 of the US' overall total:  [https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-nursing-homes-pfizer-8b7899de1c214989bb5fb16305b9c44e](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-nursing-homes-pfizer-8b7899de1c214989bb5fb16305b9c44e)

We can a bunch of debates about what the exact right order for vaccinations should be, but vaccinating 0.4% of the population where 35% of the deaths are coming from is a no-brainer."
30443,Because the Chinese conpany Fosun has invested money to the pfizer vaccine
30444,"If you read my original comment properly, you'll notice I did not say America had performed worse than *every* country."
30445,So you don't need to convince me that the 2nd and 3rd world has similar struggles to yours.
30446,Corporate welfare knows no bounds
30447,How to be stupid 101.
30448,Do not give vaccine to some group so they can incubate mutations and your herd immunity remains a dream.
30449,Jesus Christ over 2 million prisoners wtf.
30450,Do not give clean needles to drug abusers so they can sell their HIV/Hepatitis ass for men who will then give a gift to their wives.
30451,And the drug abuser guys are btw.
30452,fucking with your daughter atm.
30453,Do not give HPV vaccine to your children because they'll have only one sex partner during their life and that person will be loyal for 100% sure.

30455,So no respect for free speech nor property rights out in the boonies.
30456,"well, there’s that whole annoying eigth amendment to the US Constitution that protects prisoners against cruel and unusual punishment."
30457,"obvs, the US Constitution provides the basis for our whole society and legal system."
30458,In 1976 the US Supreme Court said in Estelle v. Gamble that a prison staff's “deliberate indifference” to the “serious medical needs” of prisoners is “cruel and unusual punishment” forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.
30459,I did not ask for this.
30460,I was born here.
30461,I never thought this should be our culture and it definitely isn't my American dream.

30465,Nothing will make them qualify for vaccines in the next two weeks without states activity choosing to ignore the plans they put out.

"""
30468,"Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief science advisor for President Donald Trump's  vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, told ""Healthy Returns"" that it's possible the U.S. could miss its year-end target by about 3 million "" 

comes in pretty handy that each vial somehow contains another shot, isn't it."
30469,We have know for a long time that this virus can infect a wide array of animal species.
30470,As long as a reasonable portion of the human population can get vaccinated the animal resivors would not have much of an impact.
30471,This virus is only a threat because it's novel and the population have no pre-existing immunity.
30472,Give the sloppy seconds to the political leaders at the end.
30473,Once everyone else has a chance.
30474,&gt; The reason there are extra is because pharmacists and nurses are being super careful and expert with the fluid and so the purposeful remaining liquid is still there at the end.
30475,huh?
30476,"I have no doubt they are experts but given that, why give them 40% extra?"
30477,"could it be more ""purposeful"" in another viral headed towards someone else's veins?"
30478,"while that's true in theory, social media interaction tends to be in bubbles, communities that are closed to the general public and only choose to view content they want to."
30479,"the vocal minority will share false articles which spread among their friends, and you could try to argue against them I suppose."
30480,But it kinda forces everyone to use the same platform to argue.
30481,But if the experts don't operate under realistic scenarios then what's the point in hearing from them.
30482,Should we wait until late 2021 to return to normal to be safe?
30483,Yes.
30484,Will we?
30485,Absolutely not.
30486,People will be returning to normal in a summer lul while they're vaccinated.
30487,Most people I know are still keeping their late summer plans because a lot of people will be vaccinated by that point.
30488,"He's not understanding the ""truth"" because the truth of how this goes involves understanding human behavior, not just he line by line science of the virus."
30489,what the fuck does that have to do with anything you asshole.
30490,Police should be allowed to defend themselves.
30491,200 officers died on the job in 2020.
30492,"When you lunge at an officer with a knife, you're gonna get shot."
30493,"I was an officer, I know how it is."
30494,"In 2019 there were 6 questionable officer involved shootings, 3 had charges brought."
30495,"It might take longer, but by like August at the latest the vaccine will have driven this into the ground, or at least Fauci and others seem to think so"
30496,"So, in a few years?"
30497,[removed]
30498,An analogy used by someone who doesn’t know what they are talking about.
30499,"True, about asymptomatics."
30500,"Hope you are right that Pfizer stops the spread, or at least makes it less likely."
30501,Sweden pursued a no-lockdown policy that caused thousands of uneccessary deaths.
30502,Norway had one tenth of the deaths of Sweden per capita by locking down.
30503,Denmark and Finland both had an order of magnitude fewer deaths per capita than Sweden by locking down.
30504,Germany a far more densely populated country has less than half the deaths per capita of Sweden.
30505,The person in charge of managing the pandemic in Sweden made a terrible mistake.
30506,The way i look at it a lot of people were expecting a 60-80% effective vaccine.
30507,Good but not as spectacular as Pfizer and Moderna at around 95%.
30508,"J&amp;J are probably confident they can hit that 60-80% range but want to be able to compete with the best in the industry, they just didn't realize the best was going to be so good."
30509,A 70% effective single shot vaccine would still do wonders though.
30510,"I've never had a nurse make me wait 15 minutes after a shot, ever."
30511,Edit: I had to run back to the nurses office when I was trying to leave and felt like I was going to faint 5 minutes after the gardasil vaccine.
30512,Normally they are allowed to equilibrate to room temp before being injected.
30513,Nice!

30515,No hospital beds for you!
30516,Thanks Doc
30517,No but they'll cover for any of the other murderers in the blink of an eye

30519,"We're about a week in, so I expect the surge to decrease in a week or two."
30520,HOLY SHIT.
30521,Even with the backlog.
30522,there’s that whole annoying eigth amendment to the US Constitution that protects prisoners against cruel and unusual punishment.

30524,In 1976 the US Supreme Court said in Estelle v. Gamble that a prison staff's “deliberate indifference” to the “serious medical needs” of prisoners is “cruel and unusual punishment” forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.
30525,New Zealanders should be truly thankful to have a leader like PM Ardern in-charge during such a difficult era.
30526,"Living in the United states, it's been like a three-ring circus for the past four years and our federal government has been fully useless in the face of this crisis."
30527,The effects of this can be shown by the social strife and general disruption to our economy and daily lives.
30528,I can only hope that after January the United States can start to emulate the good common sense shown by the government of New Zealand and that of Australia and we can get our shit together and act like a grown-up country again.
30529,🤔
30530,I live in FL and take it serious.
30531,Recently I've rediscovered how beautiful Florida is outdoors and been having some of the most fun of my adult life.
30532,I'm going kayaking somewhere new every weekend and able to socialize with people out on the water from a distance.
30533,I don't even care about not going to restaurants to sit down and eat as I'm trying to save money and can't afford to eat out.
30534,I go grocery shopping at like 7PM on Sundays at the Aldi down the road and there's usually &lt;10 other customers in the store and kinda enjoy working from home.
30535,It also helps that I pretty much hate amusement parks and other crowded places like malls.
30536,Other than that I still will go to the bait shop and there's never more than 5 people in there.
30537,With the holidays and then using some of my PTO I'll have had 4 four day weekends and then a 3 day weekend for NYE that I'm spending on the water fishing on my kayak lol

30605,"A mask isn't an article of clothing, it's a medical device to help prevent the spread of a pandemic."
30606,I thought Korea has the best contact tracing and testing system worldwide.
30607,You can see which bus or subway was taken by the infected people.
30608,They were also the first country with drive trough testing.
30609,Deaths are also still low.
30610,100%.
30611,"It's going to be blamed for heart attacks, strokes, cheating on a spouse, various STD's, pregnancy... you name it."
30612,`Correlation == causation` in their book.
30613,"That's just how this is, this one is just getting more focus."
30614,People will use this as an opportunity to explain away anything they want.
30615,So this asshole came to work with covid and I came in contact with them for a large part of my shift.
30616,I just found out about this a couple hours ago and that it was 2 days ago so today I could potentially start showing symptoms and start being contagious.
30617,Fuck my life!
30618,I try to follow all the rules and stay sanitized and it takes one dumb fuck to ruin it all.
30619,I live with family too so it’s even scarier thinking I could have already given it to them.
30620,"I did t know where to post this, I just needed to vent lol"
30621,well i guess 2022 till i get to visit the US again.
30622,"Dr.Fauci also said:

If everyone wears a mask we’d limit spread and lockdown periods."
30623,This is wonderful news
30624,[deleted]
30625,That’s a waste of vaccines.
30626,I never see cops wearing masks when they are out.
30627,If you aren’t going to take basic precautions you shouldn’t get a vaccine until there is no supply issues anymore.
30628,"Covid, unlike what King Donald Trump told us, likes the Sun."
30629,"There's also the fact that Florida's gestapo style COVID coverup is working, and I doubt it's the only state that's doing one."
30630,Only in the US.
30631,TN resident that just tested positive last week.
30632,"I got lucky, no symptoms or problems."
30633,But yikes... so many people here don't seem to care.
30634,"Oddly enough, Walmart shoppers seem to have the best mask usage."
30635,You'd think that would attracted more anti-maskers.
30636,It also depends on what’s safe and what’s acceptable.
30637,I bet he’s right that it will be safe to return to normal by mid-fall but I predict that people will return by Memorial Day.
30638,That’s pretty phenomenal.
30639,They used their geography to their advantage together with a months long lockdown.
30640,I saw a video of a small underground night “cave” of people enjoying themselves.
30641,It claims the video was taken in December in New Zealand so it comes to show how they’ve been able to reopen with everything under control.
30642,"Thanks, me too!"
30643,I’ve been hyperventilating in my room trying to setup a rapid test for tomorrow.
30644,I thought I had covid in February but you had to be pretty much dying to get a test back then.
30645,"If I do have antibodies, who even knows if it’s the same strain."
30646,"Idk, shit sucks"
30647,I hate being pessimistic but will it even matter by then?
30648,Healthcare and other essential workers may be vaccinated before this huge surge basically infects everyone.
30649,Its going to get so much worse after christmas as well.
30650,Ha that's a pretty big if.
30651,But at least I'll be getting it.
30652,&gt;For real.
30653,"Two weeks ago, it was ""packed sports stadiums by mid-summer."""
30654,"A couple of days ago, it was ""masks and cancelled events until 2022."""
30655,Both of those things are likely to be true.
30656,There are still stadiums that are open NOW because they are outdoors.
30657,It’s not that hard to imagine some places having stadiums full of people in masks while other indoor events are still banned.
30658,"What is ""normal""?"
30659,"If I can visit other vaccinated people outside my immediately family, even if they're not wearing a mask, is that ""normal""?"
30660,I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday!
30661,I'm so excited.
30662,0.5% ICU capacity remaining in the Southern California region.
30663,0.0% ICU capacity remaining in the Central Valley region.
30664,Seems like a twisting of this story.

https://www.wdsu.com/article/medical-emergency-prompts-flight-heading-to-los-angeles-to-land-in-new-orleans/34970433#"
30666,I looked for mainstream news sites but couldn't find any yet with more information.
30667,It's being reported in a few travel related blogs and this one seemed the most credible.
30668,"It's also coming from different twitter accounts, and the emergency landing happened according to this but it cuts off at the end:
https://www.wdsu.com/article/medical-emergency-prompts-flight-heading-to-los-angeles-to-land-in-new-orleans/34970433"
30669,That's not rally correct.
30670,Vaccines aren't there so you can get the virusb they mostly prevent you from getting an infection.
30671,you picked a real winner
30672,Same topic discussed in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kek4rq/fda_says_pfizer_vaccine_vials_hold_extra_doses/ so it does have to be removed as a repost.
30673,Sorry!
30674,"A 9/11 worth of deaths every day, and 40% of Americans think it's nothing to worry about."
30675,Alvarado?
30676,"ohh, you are right."
30677,"It does say world wide...........

well, US just jumped to 246,996 too"
30678,I think its going to shock everyone how many people are anti-vax now.
30679,Send them across to the mink farm tell them the mink are all non believers
30680,It's now 407 according to Worldometer.
30681,"And without vets affairs &amp; a few other states reporting at all, the total number is close to 3500."
30682,Crazy to think that at one point we were the poster child for the battle against COVID.
30683,Weren't we at one point sending medical equipment to the east coast because we were so confident?
30684,Well 15 out of 10 people tested positive for covid and 22 of them died of it.
30685,I agree tho
30686,Wasn’t mid-Fall like a month ago?
30687,That would mean... ah crap.
30688,I hope NovaVax works.
30689,Anybody have their phase I results?
30690,People have decided on an appropriate risk level for every single part of your life.
30691,One of 3486 who died today of COVID in the US and one of 13441 around the world  according to Wordometers
30692,The current vaccines do not necessary stop infection and thus do not stop the spread.
30693,They prevent the disease.
30694,Likely a good number of people will not be vaccinated.
30695,"That's fine, if the spread is reduced and infections can be isolated(Think all the countries fully open right now) ."
30696,But that only happens if vaccinated people are aware that they can still spread the infection.
30697,It goes back to the whole reason for wearing a mask.
30698,"It's not just bout you catching it, it's about you spreading it."
30699,"Yes, they have hundreds of stores."
30700,if lockdowns work why is this happening

30710,Speaking out ≠ pretending
30711,Same here...
30712,"But the thing is, I highly doubt half of America would take the vaccine to the point where the government or whatever gives the ""a-okay"" sign for concerts."
30713,Can you report your coworker to management somehow?
30714,Normal healthy people perhaps.
30715,But nursing homes and healthcare facilities may not be back to normal by then.
30716,That’s probably why there are different dates given.
30717,Healthy people who can vaccinate may be able to get to normal faster than others.
30718,So for everyone to be back to normal it may not be until fall.
30719,But majority may by spring.
30720,Yeah it certainly might be the case that numbers are now so high that it doesn't reflect actual infections.
30721,"Percent positive is 13% across the whole country, which might be above what you need to see trends on a weekly basis."
30722,"I get what you're saying, but I want you to know that the people who've been feeding you that line are a bunch of BS defeatists."

30726,"Fame is fleeting, and the early falls and dissolution of young famous people really catches the public imagination, and gives people this wrong impression that ""live fast, die young"" is the only good/fun/happy way to be, and they're so very, very wrong."
30727,Cool.
30728,The rest of us won’t get it for months.
30729,McConnel and Pelosi are both douche sandwiches.
30730,Americans pay more on taxes for healthcare per capita than Canadians do.
30731,"And they have to pay co pays, deductibles, and be worries that if they lose their job they'll have no healthcare."
30732,They didn't have a test in the beginning.
30733,"Then they had the antibody test that was really unreliable, so they had to do 2 seperate tracks, people who show symptoms but negative on the test and people who are positive on the test but no symptom, and people who have symptoms  and is positive on the test."
30734,So you will hear constany someone ran the test like 8 times and was finally positive on the 9th.
30735,It was insane back then.
30736,The latter.
30737,We'll know loads more as doses roll out.
30738,It was mostly (all?)
30739,"healthcare workers, so I have the hunch it's latex."
30740,"Latex allergy is common amongst older (but not necessarily old old) healthcare workers due to exposure before they switched to nitrile and silicone gloves/etc, and latex can be used in vaccine packaging (stoppers, vials, syringe plungers)."
30741,My SO couldn't get a flu jab this year because the doctor's didn't have any guaranteed-latex-free ones.
30742,That delay in access is not suspicious at all.
30743,...keep your mic muted unless you have a question?
30744,"We could have, and did, predict everything along the way."
30745,"Not sure about any other country but in the US we fucked up at every step, experts said ""This will happen if we don't do this."""
30746,We didn't do that and then this happened.
30747,It's formulaic.
30748,We're a country of assholes that don't understand 7th grade concepts.
30749,Do undocumented Canadians have free healthcare through the government ?
30750,Does this man even know what he is talking about anymore or just spouting random months twice a day?
30751,“15 days to slow the spread”
30752,Mine tooo!
30753,Lol...
30754,I suffer from severe asthma and I’m hesitant to get it but more afraid to get COVID
30755,Because the Republicans insisted covid liability protection for employers.
30756,They want to let employers put worker health at risk with no liability.
30757,Smart.move though.
30758,Seems like the death toll.alone will be around 3500 by the weekend; times we'll speak of for decades I hope.
30759,I would believe so.
30760,"I also think you could definitely still get sick with it, but the hope is to not have as horrible of symptoms as you possibly could."
30761,Some women freeze their sperm
30762,They want me to stay at least an hour after the vaccine for observation.
30763,I'll be sure to bring a book and I could listen to some podcasts.
30764,Can never be too careful.
30765,I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
30766,"Im going to concerts in 2021, how safe it’s gonna be is a whole other question"
30767,Unless you’re in a higher tax bracket I guess.
30768,Then I’d rather pay the $40 flat fee.
30769,"This has been the longest ""couple of weeks"" of my goddamn life."
30770,I give it until spring for people to start showing up at governor's houses.
30771,It's illegal for me to walk around in public shooting a gun in random directions.
30772,Why should it be legal for someone to walk around in public potentially spreading deadly disease when we have a quick and easy fix for it?
30773,Risk has been artificially created.
30774,"There was two ways to approach this situation:

1."
30775,Let the market regulate itself.
30776,People who can't pay are evicted.
30777,"If landlords can't fill in those units, then tough luck to those landlords."
30778,2.
30779,Keep people inside their current units.
30780,Pay for the rent of those incapable of paying the rent.
30781,Forcing landlords to bear the burden doesn't make sense.
30782,They're being artificially forced to bear it by the government.
30783,The best course of action is for the government to step in and pay for rent for those in need.
30784,It's included.
30785,Also Americans pay more per capita into their health system through taxes than we do.
30786,Oops i fell and OMG YAS IN DA KLERB WE ALL FAM
30787,Vaccinate all staff.
30788,"As far as I know, the immunity from having it lasts around 3-6 months."
30789,My friends who had it 6 months ago got tested for antibodies and it came up negative.
30790,The vaccine will last longer than the regular immunity from being infected.
30791,"The vaccine will probably not protect you from multiple strains, so you'll have to get it every so often (like a flu shot)."
30792,Even if you're not at risk for covid its better to be vaccinated so that you don't get it and spread it to those who are at risk and can't get the vaccine for medical reasons (such as allergies).
30793,"I expect the rest of the developed world will get almost completely rid of it before the end of summer 2021, while in the US this will be like a new kind of flu, it’ll never disappear."
30794,You’ll just learn to live with it.
30795,And they won't figure it out for a years time easy.
30796,To much left for doubt with this.
30797,Needs to be long term tested.
30798,We already have 26 Million in the US alone that can't take it due to food allergies.
30799,What if people had a regulated way to log if they’ve been vaccinated.
30800,"Wouldn’t it be as easy as scanning a card or something to allow access to things like movies, concerts, potential super spreader events?"
30801,"No card, no access."
30802,You’re not forcing people to get vaccinated but you incentivizing them.
30803,"I want to be careful here as I'm not an expert, but given the current crisis we're in it seems almost criminal to not use every last usable drop of vaccine."
30804,"What I've read is they aren't allowing pooling of doses from multiple vials due to contamination risk, but if the risk is very small it may be worth taking."
30805,"Prevention isn't perfect, as you can see with the 300,000 death toll."
30806,"Incarcerated people is actually included in phase 1B or 2, whichever one groups like teachers, utility workers, or other legitimately essential services are."
30807,"That's assuming the state governments don't fuck around, which uhhhhh yeahhhhh....."
30808,Because the current administration is fucking garbage...
30809,It'll just go away in the summer months when it warms up.
30810,These viruses don't do well in the heat.
30811,^^^out of loop
30812,I live in Fenton and it’s 25 degrees right now.
30813,That’s unbelievably cruel
30814,They pay for the shots indirectly in Canada too.
30815,Yeah what is he a doctor or something?
30816,Some kind of infectious disease specialist?
30817,I’d sooner trust a reality TV star and his spoiled kids.

30829,Probably the only good thing trump did in 4 years was talk good about the vaccine.
30830,Loyalists will now get a vaccine.
30831,It's almost like the experts are examining new data and evidence and aren't afraid to change their answers.
30832,If they saw evidence that it was going to be closer to September than February it's their obligation to change their answer.
30833,I already had covid.
30834,I just find it wild that people are risking it for no real good reason.
30835,Still trying to get a root shell to appear irl...
30836,I'm so happy to know this!!
30837,Hope you have some time off for rest and that the side effects aren't bad for you.
30838,At that point due to vaccines the virus won’t be much worse than the flu
30839,Yep biggest impact on deaths and also hospital resources.
30840,That helps everyone in society so it’s the biggest impact with the fewest doses.
30841,I think they would just want you to get help.
30842,"Like I said, so many people are struggling now."
30843,Don’t be so hard on yourself or feel guilty because you’re having a bit of a rough time too.
30844,There are more resources in the article.
30845,"The doctor says that people commonly tend to isolate and try to deal on their own, but that is a mistake."

30847,"&gt;”Everybody’s temptation, I think, when things start to go off the rails is to clamp down and isolate and be by themselves, and that’s almost always the worst thing that you can do,” said Devlin, a staff member at the New York State Psychiatric Institute’s Eating Disorders Research Unit."
30848,You really aren’t alone and there is help for you.
30849,Why can't my life go back to normal as soon as I'm vaccinated?
30850,Exactly.
30851,Yes let's look for clues after Mr. Clean has visited x100
30852,We haven’t had any active cases down these ways for a long time and any that we get are from returned travellers who go into 2 week quarantine
30853,That's what you heard from the government.

30875,"There’s no rush to vaccinate since the only real benefit is international tourism, and LOTS of other countries need them a lot more now."
30876,"I'll put one on to go into a business if that's the rule but in general, I am opposed to the government having the type of authority to mandate any article of clothing as opposed to certain conditions such as incarceration."

30932,"The T cells outlast the antibodies, which as I understand it might only be 8 months (seems uncertain as yet), and from my understanding that is the same mechanism the vaccine relies on (T cell wing like an owners manual, vs the active army of antibodies)."
30933,"That being said, I don’t think the vaccine is a permanent fix, even on a strain by strain basis."
30934,"I could be wrong, but this is what I’ve gathered from various physician friends of mine."
30935,"Much seems to still be unknown, overall, though."
30936,"Wait, is that supposed to cover my nose too?!"
30937,That explains a few things.
30938,"I missed my college graduation so don’t try and compare shit

You’re so fucking privileged you don’t even know what you’re fucking talking about thank Christ I’m not in a room with you right now your face would be fucking broken for talking to me like that"
30939,Nothing but vague language and general ideas.
30940,People don't appreciate being treated like children.
30941,"I'm someone that was opposed to lockdowns on principle but it was refreshing to see societies willingness to step back from their life for the greater good, if only for ~a month."
30942,"But you can only ""2 more weeks"" people so many times before it loses it's umph and turns into a boy who cried wolf situation."

30946,All time score is meaningless compared to active infections.
30947,Damnn bro i wanted to enjoy summer this year...
30948,Lol what makes you think I’m being hostile
30949,More vaccinations means less social distancing is required.
30950,It could easily be that at 50% immunization society could go back to normal with only the addition of testing and targeted self isolations.
30951,"And yes everything is possible, but if the vaccine immunizes you it is very unlikely that you'll spread it."
30952,It will be many months before it is approved for children.
30953,I wouldn't expect it to happen even next year.
30954,Teenagers will get an approval way before children under 12 do and who knows how long or if it will ever be approved for infants.
30955,Everyone understands that.
30956,"My last kid is off to college next fall and then I’m getting the fuck outa here to somewhere warm, alcohol-laden and lazy."

30962,"In the case of her cousin, it’s pretty fucking bad, to be honest."
30963,He will have to have care for his entire life and has serious problems with violence and all manner of ‘can’t live on his own’ issues.
30964,"I would hate to have that situation for my child’s life, being real."
30965,The problem is trying to get someone to accept that the ‘reason’ isn’t because of a vaccine... when they and the whole family have lived and breathed that as an explanation for decades.
30966,It’s seriously like trying to get someone to stop believing in their chosen religion.
30967,This is how science works.
30968,You make you conclusions based off of data you have.
30969,You then state your results.
30970,"As more data comes in, your results change."
30971,You then make changes to your previous conclusions if the data calls for it.
30972,"There are already few cases of reactions causing people to be hospitalized for awhile, though they recover in the end."
30973,"If I’m a child or teenager with no pre existing condition, The shot isn’t worth it at this point."

30975,"All he's done so far is say the manufacturers sat on their announcements until after the US election, which is a relatively harmless claim."
30976,The study I'm participating in which aims to measure the covid reinfection rate doesn't involve deliberately exposing me to covid.
30977,How does it work?
30978,So you will stop all the safe measure as soon you are vaccinated ?
30979,i posted about this earlier but if you exclude California and Tennessee the rest of the country is already on a pretty steep downhill slope

30983,That's good to hear that it's so very few people who are reacting!
30984,"Like I said, I'm still going to get it."
30985,I'd absolutely rather have an allergic reaction and get hospitalized as opposed to contracting covid-19 and giving it to one of my very vulnerable family members.
30986,"I'm terrified that if my mom got it, that it would just outright kill her."
30987,"International tourism isn’t that big a factor, and about half of that comes from Australia which may happen in the next few months."

30991,The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is not a live vaccine and it can be administered to immunocompromised patients.
30992,Physicians and other providers should inform such immunocompromised patients of the possibility of a diminished immune response to the vaccine.
30993,"We do not know at this time if people with a weakened immune system will respond to the vaccine and be protected from COVID-19. """

30996,"With this second link I want anyone reading it to very explicitly know that it is a bit old, from November 26th, and that the BMJ has since written more about it, but I think people should still be aware of the fact that this needed to be written in the first place:  


[https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/)  


And then I'm also going to ask: How is it that we can possibly call a vaccine fully efficable if people can still apparently reliably catch it Asymptomatically?"
30997,I know that having it Asymptomatically only should result in better outcomes for people.
30998,"But we don't even know if Asymptomatic people have longer-term effects from covid itself later, or not."
30999,Let alone a report on the full long-term effects of this vaccine given what has been written about some of the many transparency issues surrounding it.
31000,"And it's really discomforting to me that the media hailed this thing, and then only later do we get a ""It might just make people asymptomatic, not prevent them from catching it."""
31001,how the fuck are we supposed to put full faith in that.
31002,"And while that does help in some ways because people won't be affected nearly as badly by the virus as far as anyone can tell, we don't have data on whether or not people will be asymptomatic, which raises uncomfortable questions about whether or not this will reduce spread."
31003,"Which raises even more questions of, lets say it's 95% effective at simply making people Asymptomatic, does that mean that it could become vaccine resistant?"
31004,"[https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826)  


Which is a problem with having two doses in general, what if for some reason thousands or hundreds of thousands of people get that first does, but can't get that second dose?"
31005,I'm glad there's a vaccine.
31006,"But I am quite frankly upset, distrustful, and shook, because the lack of transparency around this and the amount of money involved at the corporate and governmental level do have me very bothered."
31007,Just.
31008,Just slow down and lets do the science.
31009,For the love of god.

31020,WTF!
31021,Are men “people with testicles”?
31022,It’s not that it’s about people wearing masks.
31023,It’s about calling it a new normal.
31024,To me that word makes me think that this pandemic is a permanent thing and honestly I would rather live the rest of my life acting like it never happened.
31025,Though I am in favor of mask wearing when sick.

31035,"TBF, no one knows at the time what coronavirus is nad how severe it can be, let along some Wuhan local government who's merely attempt to stop unconfirmed rumours online, fucked up but understanbale at least"
31036,Looking at the 7 day running average it appears we are at the peak or near the peak of infections in the third wave.
31037,"Of course Christmas could change it; but we could also be on the downhill slope already, in pre-symptomatic infections."
31038,Don't forget it takes time for the vaccine to be fully effective after the second dose.

31058,I'm all for the lockdown and restrictions but they can't go on until we've reached herd immunity.

31212,&gt;People who were responsible enough to get the vaccine shouldn’t have to keep living restricted lives because some people won’t get the vaccine when it’s widely available.
31213,"They shouldn’t, but they will."
31214,"As we’ve already seen so many times this year, controlling infectious diseases is a group project."
31215,We all get the same grade in the end.
31216,"Challenging yes, but certainly not impossible."

31219,"Juneau, Alaska (KINY) - A Bartlett Hospital employee had an adverse reaction 10 minutes after she received the COVID-19 vaccine with symptoms like a rapid heart rate, a flushed face, and shortness of breath."
31220,Officials said the health care worker did not have a history of allergies.
31221,They called this an anaphylactic reaction.
31222,The symptoms were discovered during a 15-minute observation period recommended by the CDC.
31223,"The attending physician said the worker took Benadryl, was admitted to the emergency room, and was administered steroids and other treatments."
31224,She was kept overnight for observation and is healthy and doing well today.
31225,She was listed in stable condition.
31226,Chief Medical Officer for Alaska Dr. Anne Zink said they expected some side effects.
31227,"""All sites that are approved to provide vaccinations in Alaska must have medications on hand to deal with an allergic reaction and that was the case in Juneau."""
31228,"Tl;dr, pers had an allergic reaction, was admitted to the hospital and is now stable."
31229,"When I’ve gotten vaccines in the past, staying around for roughly 15mins after getting the vaccine was to catch rare events like this."
31230,And now you know why they swatted Rebekah Jones
31231,This is literally a policy attempting to get their workers immunity as fast as possible.

What about poor people, like me, who don't have access to a physician to ask these kinds of questions?"
31275,I've been hospitalized twice for anaphylactic shock.
31276,Are the people administering the vaccines going to have access to this knowledge or is this something I'm supposed to goggle on my own and roll the dice?
31277,"I'm not expecting a real answer, I'm mostly just fed up with America's health care system and venting sarcastically."

31310,it's a very expensive thing to dose everyone when only a fraction of patients get sick enough to need hospitalization.
31311,I can't see insurance companies being willing (without a Federal mandate) to fully cover these drugs and I suspect the sticker price would rule it out for many people to pay out of pocket.

31500,"It's people that are going to decide when we're back to normal, not Fauci or any of the other disease experts."
31501,It will depend on how fast society moves back towards normal in the coming months and I think it's going to be way faster than most expect.
31502,Once people have the vaccine they aren't going to care about masks or being socially distant.
31503,"Once the general population has access to the vaccine, the pandemic is over and we'll be right back to normal."
31504,April/May is more than likely when it's going to be.

31510,"The thing is, once a vaccine is readily available to whoever wants it, this is all going to be over with."
31511,Restrictions and all that are going to be out the window at that point.
31512,"We can’t keep doing this forever,
and once the vaccines are out there and hospitals aren’t filling up anymore, there’s no reason to protect people from themselves anymore when they don’t want, especially when it drags the rest of society down."
31513,"No matter how many people get the vaccine, by the time May or June or whatever rolls around and anyone can get it, we are going back to “normal”"

31521,Especially for areas far removed from those areas that were hit hard in 2020.
31522,Most likey the Western States.
31523,Hospitals are going to be full and patients are going to still over to other states or temporary hospitals.
31524,"We are going to start to hear about the side effects from all of the different vaccines, so the rates people are willing is going to slow down."
31525,Things will start to relax in May - July and it's going to be a nice summer.
31526,Maybe once people actually listen to the advice from the experts?
31527,"If the time estimate is predicated on people not being assholes, then of course it goes out the window when people are still assholes."
31528,"
..so 6 more years?"
31529,Sounds like you're saying it'll be 8 more years.
31530,"What about the microchips and 5G, huh?"
31531,Gotcha!
31532,You can go on and be a sheeple but I’ll take my chances and take the vaccine as soon as it’s offered to me.
31533,Congrats!
31534,And thanks for your work

31540,Why aren't we shut down like March?
31541,Why is non essential retail still open?

31543,!
31544,"Once the vulnerable populations are vaccinated, the number of people getting Covid-19 and needing the hospital bed are going to drop."
31545,Most people do weather it without hospitalization after all.
31546,That’s when governors are going to stop mandating public health measures like quarantine and social distancing.
31547,Exactly
31548,Really depends on what happens to the economy.
31549,"If the effects last from 2020, that baby boom won’t happen."
31550,Also the birthrate was dropping pre covid because the young are too broke to have kids.
31551,My extended family are in another country.
31552,"A vaccine trial is being conducted there (probably SinoVac, but I'm not sure) and one of my relatives was asked to be part of the trial, but he refused, because he believes it contains the Bill Gates ID chips."
31553,"I explained to him that while he is very much free to not take part in the trial, *that* was not a valid reason to do it."
31554,"This is a also a relative who is very active on almost every social media platform, so the concern about being tracked using a ""chip"" was sort of hypocritical."
31555,it ain't the rich people spreading it
31556,These “side effects “ mean that the immune system was fully involved and that’s how you get 95% effective numbers.
31557,Flu vaccines don’t have many side effects because they are not nearly as effective.
31558,It will likely be July
31559,Long as you turn the AC/heat off and not waste energy I'm down with that.
31560,My life will return to normal 10 days after I get my vaccine
31561,[deleted]
31562,Because that worked so well in Europe /s
31563,Rich bankers will take their private jets and get the vaccine in other countries if they have to.
31564,Fauci can't stop them.
31565,"From the article:

Konkal said the federal government has shielded coronavirus vaccine manufacturers from personal liability lawsuits."
31566,"Instead, there’s a federal fund for those who can prove their injuries were caused by the vaccine less than one year after receiving it."
31567,"“They only pay non-covered medical expenses and lost wages as a general rule so it’s a big difference from the general vaccine compensation program which will pay for uncovered medical expenses, lost wages, future medical expenses, pain suffering and disability,” Konkel said."
31568,Dr. Ryan Westergaard is Wisconsin’s chief medical officer of communicable diseases.
31569,He’s trying to convince those who are skeptical of the vaccine that it is the quickest way to return to normalcy.
31570,"“The process that this vaccine was used to be developed was transparent and worthy of trust,” he said."
31571,To be honest if Newsom was a republican this sub will ask his demission
31572,Me too.
31573,We can do this if we just grit our teeth and carry on.

31577,Feel free to wear one for the rest of your life though.
31578,"Do you understand what the phrase ""long term symptoms"" means?"
31579,The anecdotal data from Moderna seems to imply transmission will be cut pretty significantly.
31580,Other studies about asymptomatic carriers only having an attack rate of .7% within households also points in that direction.
31581,Second infections have been recorded which implies antibodies were no longer produced or became otherwise ineffective or possibly a different strain of the virus.
31582, I don't know.
31583,The economic effects of this pandemic are going to be felt for years to come so I don't know how many couples will be wanting to have kids right now.
31584,"The smarts ones, at least."
31585,I'm wondering what the plan is for schools since the vaccine isn't approved for anyone under 18.
31586,Is the plan just to have the teachers and staff protected?
31587,"1st they need to define ""most"" as a numerical value, and have that many vaccines available by that time."
31588,I’m definitely looking forward to not having to worry about my job or getting sick.
31589,But is anyone else not looking forward to having to go places and do things again?
31590,"Yes, however the immune response started day one so it is not that simple."
31591,53k cases today... 2% fatality rate is 1k just for today.
31592,Those numbers are absolutely insane.
31593,"You can spread it, it just won't hurt you."
31594,So like you have a personal bubble and it can stick to the bubble and bounce to someone else.
31595,"10, here."

31609,Nothing is stopping that from happening.
31610,My wife and I paid $70 for ours this year.
31611,The experts have been very clear that social distancing and mask wearing will need to continue for months after the vaccine becomes widely available.
31612,If that wasn’t already clear to you than you need to take a hard look at where you’re getting your news.
31613,None of that matters.
31614,Not putting my life on hold for a tiny infection chance akin to the flu and hoping sometime in the future this thing is gone?

31616,"“All those crazy fuckers were actually right!”

Thank god she was fine next day, just to realize those crazy fuckers are just crazy fuckers."
31617,It won't cut transmission much but it could cut deaths depending on who is vaccinated first.
31618,"At low levels of vaccination like 10%, transmission will only be cut about 10%."
31619,Wearing a mask since March in california like everyone else.
31620,It feels like it was useless :(

31677,"&gt; “On the other hand, vaccines such as AstraZeneca-Oxford use aborted  fetal lines in design, development, production and testing, and  therefore are not a morally valid option because better options are  available.” 

At least, they study these things, and can make these distinctions."

31710,For the most part COVID is highest in those neighborhoods you would expect on a per capita basis.
31711,There are a lot of poor people living in dense neighborhoods.
31712,Many of them are multi-generational households and most of them don't have jobs which enable them to work from home - if they are lucky enough to have work.
31713,And there are of course idiots in even affluent neighborhoods who flout the rules but as a general rule there is mask compliance in stores in Los Angeles.
31714,And strict social distancing protocols really seem to work - I live in a high rise in Los Angeles which has very strict rules for residents and staff.
31715,Everyone has to be masked in the common area - no more than one household or person in the elevator and none of our staff has become infected since March - knock on wood.
31716,It is unlikely that the any of the vaccines will allow asymptotic carriers in people with healthy immune systems.

31751,"Canada looks great compared to the USA, which is a legitimate opinion."

31773,Having an allergic reaction is the most we think it can do.
31774,Just like recommendations for how to handle Covid changed as we learned more and more about how it spread.

31788,"&amp;#x200B;

it's could take ***DECADES*** to trace this back.. 

&amp;#x200B;

example:

in 2000, turns out HIV was actually in humans in the 1930's.. it just popped back up in the 80's...  they genetically contact traced MONKEYS... dead ones they found in the jungle.. dead of SIV (the virus that jumped to humans and became HIV) - and the had autopsy samples from the 30's victims."

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1842879](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1842879)

Using one of the world's most powerful supercomputers, a machine typically used to crunch numbers for physicists and astronomers, Bette Korber, PhD, and colleagues from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico analyzed a global database of the genetic sequences of variants of HIV-1."
31790,"By applying mathematical modeling techniques used to study evolution on the molecular level, the team extrapolated from some 160 HIV variants to predict when such variants converged back to a common origin."
31791,Why does this even matter if you can still transmit the virus once vaccinated!!?
31792,?
31793,I've commented in the parent comment but there are a number of unfavorable circumstances which would likely prevent us getting early vaccines.
31794,"Firstly people aren't dying, the flow on effect of this is we wouldn't be able to approve the vaccine under emergency measures like the US or UK and will need to wait for the full clinical trial data to be released and peer reviewed."
31795,Our small purchase orders also give us less negotiating power with manufacturers to get precious early doses.

31799,I honestly have never regretted my career choice till this year.

31843,Or when is herd immunity happening?
31844,Exactly.
31845,And companies have been preparing for distribution for months.
31846,Just waiting on the vaccine to be produced.
31847,We'll be administered the vaccine as fast as the companies can produce it.
31848,"Especially near medical centers, which are dotted all over the US."
31849,Moderna is baller at distribution.
31850,Other companies can help with production.
31851,Not as many people go out as much in the winter after the holidays so hopefully that drives cases down and we can get rid of a lot of this in the next 6 months.

31869,We need to weigh risk vs reward and its OK to question a vaccine that has never been tested long term and was rushed through the approval process.
31870,"I know, but polls showed he wouldnt, polls are shit."

31909,This dude says a lot of things.
31910,The US will never return to normal.
31911,There have been people like you spreading death and disease since the times of bubonic plague.
31912,There is nothing special about you.
31913,"Its a trope that has played out for centuries, the result of auto piloting your brain and moral code."
31914,"Hey there, I share your frustration with the system."
31915,"I’m not going to offer solutions you’ve surely already thought of (e.g., it’s fairly well-known that community health centers are required to treat anyone regardless of insurance status/ability to pay, so I’m assuming you don’t have easy access to one), but I wanted to offer one piece of advice for our current situation: with telehealth becoming so common, and likely to stick around in some capacity even after this ends, you may have more access than you did before, assuming proximity/transportation to a CHC has been a barrier."
31916,"Also, once you’re established as a patient (even remotely), you can get hooked up with a medical case manager who may be able to help with transportation to in-person appointments, as well as other programs and resources that may help you feel more able to be engaged in care (that’s literally the purpose of their job and what they’re federally funded to do.)"
31917,Source: I’m a clinical social worker at a CHC and used to manage our case management department.
31918,Do we have any figures on number of cases &amp; deaths by age?
31919,I know the number of people who died globally vs those who were infected is 'relatively' small.
31920,I also know the elderly represent the majority of deaths.
31921,"But I'm trying to find a stat along the lines of ""X% of people over 65 who were infected died""

There's a disagreement in my family about how much risk my grandmother may or may not be at and the overall 'low' death rate is the basis for the argument."
31922,If we started making decisions based on science instead of politics we'd be closer to normal already.
31923,You can read the UK's independent priority groups report [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-2-december-2020/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-2-december-2020).
31924,"Essentially the report recommended this priority order:

1. residents in a care home for older adults and their carers
2."
31925,"**all those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers**
3. all those 75 years of age and over
4. all those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals
5. all those 65 years of age and over
6. all individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality
7. all those 60 years of age and over
8. all those 55 years of age and over
9. all those 50 years of age and over

As Sir Ian McKellen is 81, he falls into priority group 2, so is of equal priority to healthcare workers."
31926,"There are some logistical concerns in vaccinating group 1, notably, you want to bring the vaccine to the care homes rather than risk these elderly people being taken to the hospital (I imagine this isn't the easiest thing to do, especially for patients with dementia), however, the early rollout is only going to occur within hospital ""hubs"" due to the refrigeration and logistical constraints."

31935,This is the end.
31936,"He'll be fine,  most likely have no symptoms and move on."
31937,Could we please stop reporting on every important individual who gets Covid?
31938,It isn't cancer.
31939,If deaths are reduced by 99% I see no reason not to just let people live their lives.
31940,"At a certain point the damage done trying to stop it with endless lockdowns will be worse than the damage of the virus, like in Japan there's already been more excess suicides compared with 2019 than virus deaths and the response has been pretty minimal comparatively so I'm certain a lot of other places are in a similar boat and we just don't know because the data isn't made as available elsewhere."
31941,Everyone ignores the mental health aspect because it's not as quantifiable but I'm genuinely more afraid that I'll have a bad day and end it all myself than that the virus will hurt me.
31942,This is the first time I've been suicidal at all since like 5 years ago and if it happens that was a preventable death.

31952,"Except the benefits of natural immunity doesn't seem to be clear or necessarily long lasting since there are plenty of re-infections on record and plenty of ""long covid"" cases."

31958,"Poverty and lack of resources doesn't mean people think ""It's hard to raise children so let's have lots of them because one might be successful enough to make it worthwhile."""
31959,"Long Covid is no joke and the biggest threat to our healthcare system and economy on 2021, I believe."
31960,"Yes, saw the same range."
31961,"Before I had seen 25%... either way, life will be VERY different with many millions with long-term health issues and much shorter lifespans."
31962,Most have no idea what we’re in for next year.
31963,Guess you didn't read the article.
31964,"Well, March is when we're probably going to run out of Pfizer, so this can slot into its place."
31965,"Bonus is that its easier to store and transport, and doesn't need to be kept hyper-cold, so it can be distributed almost everywhere."
31966,[deleted]
31967,Yet everyone who dies and tests positive is labeled a covid death even if they died from something unrelated.
31968,So anyone who receives the vaccine and dies afterwards should be labeled a vaccine death by their logic.
31969,Do you know the difference between long term and short term?
31970,"Like i said, “unlikely isn’t good enough” for me."
31971,I probably have at least a year until I’m scheduled to get a vaccine so I will be watching.

31997,Well that's a gross oversimplification and overgeneralization of cities in 'Europe'.
31998,Most cities I know are a melting pot of cultures and very livable.
31999,Take for example a city like The Hague: 60% of the inhabitants are (descending from) immigrants from 138 different countries.
32000,You won't find a much more integrated society.
32001,Yes you also have stupid motherf#ckers like Poland and Hungary where government sanctioned minority hate is alive and kicking.

32016,"As more vaccines come online, I'm sure we'll have enough to go around :)

Here in Denmark the government has ordered 15 million vaccines from different companies."
32017,6 million people live here.
32018,"The explanation is that the government didn't expect every vaccine to be ready, or even get authorised for use in the EU."
32019,"But that we were able to secure contracts for that amount, seems to suggest that there will be enough for those of us fortunate enough to live in a 1st world country!"

32025,"Erm, yeah, actually, that’s pretty much literally it...

There’s a separate program running alongside that where healthcare and care system workers are being offered the vaccine at work, because they’re working with vulnerable people 

I dunno if we’ve ever mentioned it, but the NHS is pretty good"
32028,Question for you all.
32029,"As far as we know currently, the immunity period for the virus seems to be a few months."
32030,How sure are we that the vaccine will provide lasting protection?
32031,"From what I’ve seen, it could be several months before the majority of the population is inoculated (June or so at earliest)."

32449,All the nutters would push for mass vaccinations.
32450,We could have waited much longer if the federal government wasn’t actively trying to spread the disease and if people didn’t act like it was a hoax

32486,That’s the plan.
32487,"I’m very low priority though, since I’m 27 with no underlying health conditions and I was working from home already pre-Covid, so it’ll be a while."
32488,Clearly you just don't want me to have the last word in a conversation about whether you understand how vaccines work: and it's becoming apparent that you don't.
32489,"So, again, do you?"
32490,Yes or no?
32491,"My heart aches, that all these people,  decent people are dying."
32492,"Nurses, doctors,  service persons and I still see idiots without masks, with shirts saying ""Lion not Sheep""."

32499,Are they though
32500,How do you even get the vaccine?

32573,&gt; Why does room matter?
32574,"What matters is a temperature IN the freezer, the freezer should be on thermostat of course

Because a freezer has a finite amount of cooling it can do in relation to the outside temperature."
32575,"Freezers don't ""create cold"" they ""move heat""."
32576,"If it is too hot outside the freezer, it cannot dissipate the heat collected inside the freezer to move it out and the temperature inside the freezer rises."
32577,&gt;Whatever is the expected time from production to vaccination + safety buffer.
32578,A month will be close.
32579,"Trials lasts for almost 10 months, so plenty of time to do the measurement..

Not all freezers are stationary in the production facility or the destination location."
32580,These move from one place to another.
32581,Thats where the problem arose in the article for this thread.
32582,&gt;I'd expect vials to be fully sealed.
32583,So air pressure/humidity does not matter.
32584,The question wasn't related to the contents inside the vial.
32585,Air pressure and humidity affect the freezer's ability to cool.
32586,"&gt;And of course, no sunlight...

You can guarantee that these freezers will not be sitting on a tarmak or shipping dock in sunlight for any amount of time?"
32587,You mean they have 3000 a day with 1/3 of our population?

32593,We do the same with soldiers.

32595,"I think the day is fast approaching where doctors/nurses will basically get drafted into their positions, even in first world countries."
32596,And deserters won't get shot but they will probably be barred from practicing medicine again.
32597,"Yes, they have failed."
32598,And they also had restrictions...just not enough.
32599,Ok so who is hypocritical?
32600,"Unfortunately, that's not how it works."
32601,The vaccine works to make the body recognize the spike proteins inside of Covid19.
32602,"The mutations are all directly effecting the spike proteins, so it will not be effective."
32603,I think the same could be said for the US.
32604,Did you dine on his royal yacht?
32605,"No, he didn't HAVE to."
32606,But by doing so he will almost certainly help increase the take up of the vaccine.
32607,We are hoping that by vaccinating all these elderly folk first that we can reduce the strain on our hospitals.
32608,As well as save some lives.
32609,"Of all the things he could have criticised the Sweish government for, he chose a virus that hasn't even caused more people to die than a usual year."

32611,"137,000 people receiving the vaccine within a fortnight of it receiving regulatory approval is 'unbelievably slow' is it?"
32612,You're just talking rubbish.
32613,If delivery is ramped up to 1 million per week the entire adult population could be vaccinated by the end of 2021.
32614,"Of course, that plan relies on people showing initiative and the drive to solve problems to help others rather than just standing on the sidelines and whining about how terrible things are."

32642,This sub is pretty predictable.
32643,My chance of dying from covid as a someone in their 40s is higher than this non fatal vaccine risk.
32644,"Nevermind surviving covid but having organ damage 

Remember this is just a severe allergic reaction."
32645,The FDA also considers diarrhea a severe vaccine reaction and something like 2-4% of people get that.
32646,I fucking love this so much thank you for blessing me with this kind sir
32647,"Finland isn't technically Scandinavian ;)

Besides that, Finland was a part of Sweden until 1809 when Russia conquered it."
32648,Later Finland became independent in 1917.
32649,"In other words there has never been a Finnish monarch, because Finland as a state is young."
32650,When they gained independence some people supported creating a new royal house by offering a German noble the crown.
32651,But the offer was rejected and republican ideas were stronger anyhow.
32652,"Well, the whole thread started out by me contesting NZ being ""highly ethical"" in their approach."
32653,"Some people genuinely think rich countries are doing poor countries a favour by buying up the entire supply, because according to them the pharma corps would otherwise not be able to produce vaccines at all."
32654,I also said that the approach is entirely understandable from each country's own perspective.
32655,What is the alternative?
32656,"I already said that, global distribution."
32657,"Waive the patents, produce cheaply in India (where most of our generic meds come from already), serve those countries first which are the most affected, or do it proportionally by population."
32658,"If I'm not mistaken, I swear!"
32659,&gt;The latter is probably the most important part.
32660,"The New Zealand government used a colloquialism to describe their strategy: ""go hard, go early""."
32661,The general idea is that the most effective way to save lives in a pandemic of a novel virus is to do everything possible to stop the spread of the virus as soon as it appears.
32662,The other Nordic countries had similar responses.
32663,"They may not have had as ""hard"" a lockdown as some other nations, but they put measures in place as soon as community transmission was even suspected, and those measures were strict enough to prevent community transmission from growing out of control."
32664,"Norway, for example, announced a partial lockdown on March 12, the same day the first death was recorded and around 400 confirmed cases was reached."
32665,"What was different in Sweden:

&gt; ""We’re continuously discussing a number of different measures, including of course those taken in other countries,"" Tegnell said, **""but no, we’re not having an active discussion about doing something similar in Sweden."
32666,"""** 

[March 12, 2020](https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/7427723)

The same day, Sweden had recorded around 700 cases and one death, but Tegnell et al."
32667,were not even considering harsher measures to try and halt  local transmission.
32668,"In fact, within days, the FHM was not even interested in how many people were infected:

&gt; \- We will no longer discuss whether we have 458 or 562 cases."
32669,"But instead how large parts of Sweden are affected and how badly affected they are, says Tegnell."
32670,"&gt;  
&gt;It is, according to him, instead of looking at what it looks like in healthcare and how many cases come in there."
32671,But also to look at which groups in society seem to be the sickest.
32672,"&gt;  
&gt;\- These are the types of questions that will be central to having answers to."
32673,**Now it is no longer important to know exactly how many are infected in Sweden.

At every step of the way, Tegnell downplayed the seriousness of the situation, until he made a sudden about face and said the situation was already out of control and thus there was no point trying to stop it."
32675,"He did it prior to the first wave, and then again prior to the second wave."
32676,"Sweden's version of the strategy was ""go soft, go late"", and it failed miserably."
32677,This story initially looked like nightmare fuel for someone (like me) who believes there is no vast conspiracy to inflate Covid numbers.
32678,People who died from gunshots being classified under Covid?
32679,Then I read on.
32680,There are two classifications here.
32681,Deaths among people who have tested positive for Covid.
32682,And deaths where the CAUSE of death is attributed to Covid.
32683,I’ve had friends insisting that when someone is killed by being hit by a car and they had a positive Covid test in the last 30 days the cause of death is listed as Covid because (insert various insidious reasons).
32684,I finally understand where they are getting this from.
32685,They are confusing the first report type (which is an attempt to monitor deaths among cases irrespective of the cause of death) with the second report type; deaths due to Covid.
32686,"This, even rational people have decided that 2020 was the bad year and 2021 is finally the time they can resume their pre-covid life."
32687,Is the Swedish king the one that rides a bike to the office every day?
32688,An oldman trying to convince other people (especially older people) to get vaccinated is bragging...
32689,Then change the constitution if it's an emergency.
32690,Imagine letting people die just because you don't want to change the constitution even temporary or under certain circumstances.
32691,"Oh god, can you imagine vaccine drops instead of sneaker drops?"
32692,That would be a scary reality.
32693,Unfortunately nursing is a job you can't social distance in.
32694,When didn't win shit in Iraq.
32695,"We left a vacuum of power taking out Sadam, who wasn't a humanitarian leader at all but also wasn't ISIL who filled that vacuum."
32696,The sunk cost financially and lives lost made it a total failure.
32697,Actually depends on the disease.
32698,The more contagious the higher vaccination levels are needed for herd immunity.
32699,On 70 percent with a super contagious virus the remaining 30 percent would still very likey passing it on among themselves at high rates
32700,[removed]
32701,&gt; “Would you want to go to a county that has really high death numbers?
32702,Would you want to go visit that county because they are contagious.
32703,"You know I might get it, and I could die if all of a sudden one county has a high death count."
32704,"We don’t have it, and we don’t need those numbers inflated.”

Maybe let's focus on the two gunshot deaths."
32705,COVID would likely be a bit lower on the list of concerns I'd have in visiting that county.

32717,But probably wait until everyone can safely get the vaccine.
32718,"Also, it’s advised you still wear a mask afterwards anyway."
32719,You’re not fully protected right after you get the vaccine.
32720,You have to wait a few weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective.
32721,"I get you man, it was puke-inducing seeing a *certain someone* getting hospitalised from Covid, getting experimental, state-of-the-art medical assistance, then playing the virus off as being nothing, and them being strong."
32722,In a country with 200k deaths at the time.. All made possible due to their high status in society.
32723,"I agree with your insinuation that something else, other than setting an example, is going on with the rich getting the vaccine."
32724,It's probably the same selfish desire of becoming immune that we all carry.
32725,"The excuse that they are setting an example, is only able to be presented due to the fact that anti-vaxxers, and covid-deniers have been given undue media representation these last few years (for anti-vaxxers, of course)."

32745,Please stop talking out of your ass.
32746,Nobody knows for sure.
32747,Does anyone have any clarification about the 3rd CDC guideline for ending self-isolation?
32748,What do they mean by other symptoms improve?
32749,My wife tested positive and self-isolated.
32750,"She clearly meets the other guidelines for ending self-isolation and I think meets the third, but she still has a cough."
32751,"It's definitely improved and is continuing to improve, but it's still there."
32752,"Her symptoms were mild(no hospital/a bad flu), but I don't know if she should have no flu like symptoms anymore, or if they just need to be on the upswing."
32753,I’m on a mobile — just search the sub for Pompeo — the size of the party and the dearth of attendees + his missing it due to having to quarantine has made the news again &amp; again &amp; been all over this sub
32754,2 months?
32755,Don't you mean 2-3 weeks?
32756,Not necessarily.
32757,I would focus on infection rates.
32758,Fatalities are dropping as treatment improves through experience.
32759,But survival isn’t the same as being fully recovered.
32760,Best to just not have em get sick at all
32761,"To the extent that bringing the virus under control requires broad public buy-in for a vaccine, these interviews are a useful window into how people are thinking."
32762,They seem to basically track the 50/50 split in national polls between those ready to take the vaccine today and those who are more hesitant.
32763,"&gt; with minor adjustments due to particular circumstances

Well, that's exactly what works."
32764,General guidance that can be adapted for specific circumstances.
32765,People freaking out actually would have been great.
32766,Fear can have a powerful impact on actions.
32767,"“Preventable”

You seem to think people could just stay in doors forever."
32768,It’s basically been a year.
32769,That wasn’t going to happen.
32770,Because that would probably just lead people to panic buy masks in stores (because they think it's necessary to have a mask and nobody was mking homemade masks).
32771,"You also have to consider that he has finite resources in terms of political and social capial, i.e."
32772,what he's able to get people to do.
32773,"If public health officials like Fauci made everyone panic and radically change their lifestyles every time there is a potential risk, people wouldn't take his advice as seriously."
32774,"And at a time when they thought that they could get it under control by testing and isolating cases, it makes sense to focus his attention and energy on that instead of the (very difficult) task of getting on board with collaborating like that."
32775,"But when it becomes clear that this is necessary and they can't get it under control by just testing and isolating cases, then it makes sense to change the recommendations."
32776,I think it's easy to forget what it was like in February because the pandemic as become so normalized.
32777,"At the time, it seemed like a very remote problem, and it would have been very hard to persuade people that it was."
32778,"And if public health officials sincerely thought that they would be able to get it under control with just a handful of cases, it makes sense that they would want to reserve big public statements that ask everyone to change their lifestyles to situations where that's truly necessary."
32779,"Sure, in retrospect, it does look like that's what they should have done."
32780,"But at the time, I don't think anyone thought it would be this out of control."
32781,"The human brain seeks to assimilate information in ways that pleases its existing neural network, and frequently discards any information that doesn’t easily assimilate."
32782,"It’s also why we have this toxic social divide in the US, born from partisan news and supercharged by social media."
32783,The only top 10 country that isn't European is Peru (death rates).
32784,Comparing Sweden to just European countries is stacking the deck.
32785,There's no reason not to compare them to Canada or Japan or South Africa.
32786,Though in my opinion there may be a reason to segment the world between tropical and non-tropical.
32787,Its rather difficult to find tropical countries that are struggling with the virus.
32788,The only two tropical countries in the top 40 are Panama and Belize.
32789,explain why the virus is following a nearly identical epidemiological curve regardless of intervention techniques.
32790,the answer is staring you in the face.
32791,you just refuse to see it
32792,"&gt; At a meeting with EU diplomats in July, a Commission official said the EU had declined an offer of 500 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech because it was too expensive, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows."
32793,"So 150M people can get vaccinated with this, 80M with Moderna = exactly half of the European population."
32794,"Boy, am I glad this incompetent bureaucracy decided to save money."
32795,"We do have a contract for 200-400M doses of J&amp;J vaccine, so now we have to _pray_ it works or else we're boned."
32796,"Yeah, I'm not used to reading positive news on this subreddit."
32797,Excited to see more and more stories like this.
32798,I fancy the Dairy Queen myself.
32799,"For healthy children and teens the symptoms are way milder than the side effects, those are just counting the ones needed to be at hospitals, not counting the ones suffer from moderate side effects like really bad headache for a day, which is quite a big percentage of people who got the vaccine."
32800,Already worst than most covid cases for healthy children and teens.
32801,"Yeah, after watching our mountain communities get slammed all summer and now with ski season, can confirm that many tourists don’t look at COVID rates or anything else before they come to Colorado."

32804,What is the point of taking the vaccine if you still have to social distance and wear a mask forever?

32815,Still take the recommended precautions until the majority of people can get the vaccine.
32816,Worldometers change the daily numbers of Sweden thereafter because of how Sweden [report the daily deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting).
32817,"Sweden had several 100 deaths a day since december, with a higher peak than [during the first wave](https://www.cjoint.com/data/JLrroflSrcA_02.png) and the weekly average is 66 today."
32818,"I haven’t had this vaccine but for my flu vaccine my drs texted me to say come in and get it

As they’re 80+ I am sure they got a letter rather than a text."

32828,&gt;It does tell us that the average actual Swede on here is more critical than others.
32829,"I mean, most of the people who stumble upon these threads don't otherwise follow what is going on in Sweden that much."
32830,"Of course the Swedes should know more, but I've had to correct some Swedes at times, too."

32866,"That's not what a hoax is, at all."
32867,I sure hope restaurants come back.
32868,Part of me wonders if demand will be down because we all just spent however many months cooking all our meals at home for the first time in decades.

32893,"Not really, this was an avoidable event that many countries missed out on through proactive measures."
32894,Heart disease and cancer aren't like that and affect everywhere fairly evenly.
32895,This is far more comparable to a war which is unfair to specific locations for various reasons.

32897,Of course.

32901,A whole lot more people (of all ages) have complications from Covid than from the flu.

32904,"I understand, but I am trying to emphasize that the real economy i.e."

32927,Just look at worldometers if you want to compare the deaths per million due to covid.
32928,I don't see why you are trying to do the math yourself.
32929,"[This source is also very useful, I find](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;country=SWE~USA~EuropeanUnion&amp;region=World&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=total&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=total_cases&amp;pickerSort=desc)

If these are the figures you are referring to, Sweden is doing worse than the EU average according to official covid death statistics."
32930,"No, the Swedes frequenting the regular Swedish sub are not more or less informed lol."
32931,A very big part of the people on here discussing Sweden are not Swedish nor have they ever set foot in the country.
32932,And thats goes for every opinion or stance on the matter.
32933,It does tell us that the average *actual* Swede on here is more critical than others.
32934,I'd be pretty happy with that tbqh.
32935,I now have to decide who I believe.
32936,Big Pharma or the Trump administration.
32937,I’m gonna go with Pfizer on this one.
32938,What could possibly go wrong?
32939,"Ah yes, the traveling vaccine-man problem"

32944,&gt; But only one country was telling the rest of the world that their strategy meant they would not have a second wave.
32945,Which country would that be?
32946,"Because FoHM always said the spread would go down during summer, and come back in autumn."
32947,"What he did say that was incorrect tho, was that after summer he expected a lot of regional outbreaks at different times, but all regions got hit at roughly thesame time."
32948,"You have to realize that company is also paying for the nurses insurance, payroll taxes, retirement benefits, and other things that cost employers money."
32949,It also costs money to staff the nurses.
32950,You need people to find them jobs.
32951,Staffing agencies have notoriously low margins.
32952,Those numbers seem reasonable.
32953,"It is, but it's a lose-lose situation at this point."
32954,My wife is a teacher; her school opened up this week and already has 2 positive covid cases (I believe that 3 cases in two weeks forces a shutdown).
32955,"I believe it's possible to safely open schools back up, other places have done it."
32956,I don't believe that in California specifically that we can open schools back up.

32965,"But he is getting vaccinated exactly when he should, along with all the over 80's, and we are vaccinating health care professionals as a priority too."
32966,So you really don't have any point at all do you?
32967,To who?
32968,You want the Gestapo to come rough them up some and haul them off to the gulag?
32969,Did the violate an actual law?

33503,"idk if they did for sure, but if we assume ND is similar to other places there were 6 people who had to isolate for every positive case and of those 1/3 would eventually test positive themselves  (this ignores the over 50% positivity rate, but i'll address that at the end) then during that period of time roughly 1/150 people per day went into isolation for two weeks...so before it was all said and done over 1/10th of the state was in isolation."
33504,that would easily cause numbers to drop on it's own.
33505,"but mostly the big boom of cases for any state has come from big cities, prisons, factories, nursing homes, etc so once those folks caught it the rest of the state has plenty of social distancing, i forget how many acres per person but it's insane how spread out they are."
33506,"back the positivity rate, when it was all said and done they had 1250 deaths (with 250 more projected from the last 3 weeks worth of cases) so 1500 divided by the 0.6% death rate and you get 250,000 positive cases that's nearly 1/3 of the entire state so that would drop the case count pretty darn fast, even faster if people are still isolating at a 6 to 1 rate at a given time."
