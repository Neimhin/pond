0,"As a guy responsible for 5000+ officers, and the 4th largest city in the country he's not just some random guy."
1,If for no other reason than the increased exposure to his officers he's got serious skin in the game.
2,"As mentioned elsewhere in reply to your comments, he's not a qualified medical professional."
3,And neither is the gov.
4,Which makes everything both of them say opinions.
5,However as it is believed that the gov's comments are significantly politically motivated (read: decisions guided by something other than his responsibility for the health and well-being off the state's residents) this seems to prompt others with similar qualifications to weigh in with conflicting opinions.
6,It's unfortunate you're being down voted so much as you do make a few good points.
7,"I'm just providing some alternative perspective to them and perhaps explaining why not only be feels compelled to make the statements he does, but why it resounds so strongly with many people."
8,I'm guessing many who got the real thing probably already know.
9,"Matter, yes."
10,But how big are the risks?
11,The vaccines all it prevent serious disease in most cases.
12,But the whole lockdown and flatten the curve push was to prevent hospitalizations and deaths.
13,"And the faster it gets out there, the less likely any of us get it anyways."
14,"America is ruled, largely, by the consent of the minority."
15,"A simple majority can get some things done, but not much, and nothing big."
16,It requires a supermajority to overcome a filibuster to do anything substantial without consent of the minority parties.

31,"I.e., if the numbers were bad then and we shut down and they're X times that now, we should still not be opening things up."

38,Sorry.
39,This is a story that should get publicized.
40,"We've had around 20k covid deaths so far in the Netherlands, a lot of deaths were under reported last year."
41,So with a 0.5% mortality rate that would put us at 4 million cases so far.
42,"Plus 1.2 million vaccinations puts us at 5.2 million or 30% more or less protected right now, of which a lot are among the vulnerable."
43,"Absolutely I do, something is better than nothing."
44,I‚Äôm just never a fan of last minute surprises I guess.

46,Is that what I described is going on?
47,He can be in public just not in the placed i put above.
48,Its less dystopian than what was before that where it was illegal to have any people at restaurants and crowded events.
49,"Gyms have been completely closed almost all year, hotels too."
50,For a few months out of the last year it was illegal to be more than 1km away from your house.
51,So there are phases to lift the restrictions.
52,This is just part of it.
53,Infections are getting lower and lower each week once they get low enough everything will be completely open.
54,[deleted]
55,So it's weird to single out maskless people as disease vectors.
56,"All humans are disease vectors, mask or not."

65,The FDA scientists literally said it was less effective than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines
66,Listen I get medical professionals saying this but if they got their way we'd wear masks forever.
67,We'd never cook steaks less than well done.
68,We'd never have eggs done kver-easy.
69,That would reduce all types of diseases.

79,So why is it he is acting the opposite of what every medical professional in the country is saying right now?
80,I mean he should be responsible for the well being of a state per your own words right?
81,"That means looking out for the health of your citizens... And listening to what MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS say, sorry but I don't trust a governor to know more than doctors about this."
82,Fuck him for not giving a shit about his people and letting pride get in the way of actually being a politician.

"" Eulerian‚ÄìLagrangian modeling of cough droplets irradiated by ultraviolet‚ÄìC light in relation to SARS-CoV-2 transmission""

*Physics of Fluids* ***33***\*, 031905 (2021)\*

ABSTRACT

It is well known that several viruses, as well as SARS-CoV-2, can be transmitted through airborne diffusion of saliva micro-droplets."
219,"For this reason, many research groups have devoted their efforts in order to gain new insight into the transport of fluids and particles originated from human respiratory tracts."
220,This paper aims to provide a contribution to the numerical modeling of saliva droplets' diffusion produced by coughing.
221,It is worth noting that droplets' diameters of interest in this work are such that represent typical emission during a cough.
222,"Aerosolization effects are neglected since emitted droplets' diameters are greater than 10 *¬µ*m. In particular, the well-known problem around the safety distance to be held for avoiding virus transmission in the absence of external wind is further investigated."
223,"Thus, new indices capable of evaluating the contamination risk are introduced, and the possibility to inactivate virus particles by means of an external ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation source is studied."
224,"For this purpose, a new model which takes into account biological inactivation deriving from UV-C exposure in an Eulerian‚ÄìLagrangian framework is presented.**I."
225,**
226,Guess I won't be travelling anywhere then.
227,"Not gonna be using a vaccine passport, way too concerned about privacy"
228,They did skip long term testing though
229,unfortunately they legally can‚Äôt enforce penalties for not wearing masks.

232,How am I a big pharma science denier?
233,It doesn't honestly matter what you think or what I think.

235,Then find someone else who aligns with your goals.
236,"Some people are going to choose to wear a mask around others when they are sick after COVID, or if it's flu season."
237,It's a personal choice.
238,You also have a choice to find another therapist.
239,Or you could do virtual appointments.
240,"1) a lot of people died already
2) a lot of people caught covid already
3) a good amount of people are getting vaccinated"
241,Woo just got my J&amp;J!
242,"Not scheduled until May, but SWIK called me about extra vaccines at a school clinic."
243,"In other words, don't count on any J&amp;J vaccine until later this year."
244,"By then we should better know the efficacy especially against the Variants, which will be critical to success by the fall."
245,&gt; I think more states need to expand eligibility.
246,More us vs them nonsense.
247,I'd be shocked if things were limited by anything other than number of distribution centers and volunteers to give the shots right now.
248,Dime a dog night is going to be lit.
249,"What it does mean is ""if you _would_ have caught COVID, there's only a 65% chance the vaccine will stop it."""
250,"So given 10 situations where you would have caught a moderate case of COVID, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would stop at least 9 of them, while the J+J vaccine would only stop 6 or 7."
251,That's still a meaningful difference.
252,That‚Äôs what the constitution is for folks.
253,Protecting us from mask mandates
254,I‚Äôm also in Texas.
255,"While I don‚Äôt agree with the dropping of the mask mandate, I doubt much will truly change."
256,80% of COVID deaths have been over 65+.
257,An additional 10-20% have been obese or autoimmune compromised patients.
258,"I wouldn't consider those statistics as qualifying as ""extremly deadly""."
259,"I understand how &amp; why COVID is a problem because of how contagious it is, how hidden it is, and how deadly it can be for 75 million people in the US, but 3% deathrate, to me, isn't considerable as extremly deadly."

321,The only screaming is from pro-mask people in Austin.
322,There hasn‚Äôt been an enforced mask requirement from any business I‚Äôve been to in months.
323,This is where you need to understand the difference between restrictions and choice.
324,Now it depends on the situation but me wearing a mask into a grocery store isn't not going to restrict my ability to shop.
325,Now if say I was going to the dentist.
326,Well then wearing a mask would restrict the services I could receive so therefore I would not have to wear a mask.
327,What the order says is no local orders can be put in place that restrict services.
328,Which in a legal sense can be argued that as long as the mask does not need to be removed to recieve those services then a mask mandate is okay because access to those services is not restricted.
329,Additionally a private company can require you to wear a mask on the premises or ask you to leave.
330,"You see it all the time ""no shirt, no shoes, no service,"" ""we don't have to serve gay people here,"" ""you must wear a mask while shopping."""

343,Oh yeah.
344,Good point.
345,"AZ showed efficacy of some 73%, which is very similar to what their clinical trials showed, which was 76% (basically identical, because of CI)."
346,It's really interesting just how big of a problem immunity to vectors then hurts the second dose.
347,"In their latest Lancet publication, getting a second dose after 12 weeks only bumps you up to 81% from 76%."
348,"In fact, it's the anti-ChAd immunity waning that makes the 12 week regimen more efficacious than the 4 week one."
349,"You can see JnJ opting for that (12 week interval) in their ongoing clinical trials of a 2 dose regimen, probably for the same reason."
350,The reason it's probably for the same reason (aside from the Ramasamy et al paper literally talking about it) is the fact that Sputnik V is the only 2 dose viral vector vaccine that is being given in a 3 week regimen and it's also the only vaccine to be using two different vectors in their two doses.
351,"Pays off, because it's the most efficacious 2 dose regimen out of any viral vector vaccine."
352,And most / all Denver metro districts are full in-person elementary grades and going back full in-person for middle and high schools after spring break.
353,Lol.
354,Yes there are several businesses that are still ‚Äúrequiring‚Äù masks but that has almost never been enforced in the past few months.
355,H-E-B which is Texas‚Äô pride and joy grocery chain is only ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù masks for the customers.
356,Most of the businesses here have been threatened by the idiotic Covidiots and have all but ignored any mask mandates of their customers.

Got an appointment at Safeway on my first try using that site."
359,First Pfizer shot was on 3/5.
360,"if i had to guess, it would probably have to do with the fact that the majority of alaskans live around one area, and while there are a lot of small isolated communities spread across alaska, theres are also established logistics networks that allows those communities to receive vaccines too."
361,"some extra evidence supporting that idea is the fact that new mexico, which also has the majority of its people concentrated in one area, also has a pretty high vaccination rate"

584,As long as it hasn't been approved they don't need to supply any doses yet.

652,By that argument then the EU is blocking the export of several hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccines which scheduled to be delivered to EU countries or have already been delivered to those countries.
653,"After all "" The net result is vaccines being produced and kept within the borders of the producer. """
654,....you realize immune people can still contract the virus a second time?

683,I think a 'tolerable level' of covid death can be higher than what the flu was to go back to normal.
684,If the flu were twice as bad one year I doubt anyone would bat an eye.
685,"Alright I'll enlighten you bud

13% of deaths are the result of cancer."
686,12% are heart failure.

765,So we could see their export numbers drop from 0 to 0 and they could finally drop this ridiculous facade.

777,"&gt;I can share what I think about governments selling tobacco products if you like, but again - it has nothing to do with what we're talking about and that is clearly obvious."
778,"How is it ""clearly obvious""?"
779,I'm just taking your logic about COVID and applying it to tobacco.
780,"If you think governors are murderers for lifting mask/lockdown orders, then why aren't they equally murderers for not banning all tobacco products?"
781,What is the significant difference?
782,"COVID has killed around 500,000 people in the past year."
783,"Tobacco has killed 480,000 people in the past year."
784,"In terms of mortality, they're pretty equivalent."
785,So where is your condemnation of virtually every single politician failing to ban tobacco and calling them murderers for their failure?
786,You sure had no problem calling politicians who are lifting statewide restrictions as responsible murdering anyone who succumbs to COVID.
787,So why don't you equally call politicians who do not impose restrictions on tobacco as murderers?
788,&gt;As far as your other question - I definitely blame Biden for not implementing a federal mask mandate.
789,I think that's just pathetic leadership.
790,So Joe Biden is a murderer?
791,"&gt;However, considering your previous president was telling people to drink bleach to stop the virus, (or whatever the fuck was coming out of that pathetic excuse for a man's mouth) - your current senile old man president just doing nothing is an improvement."
792,This is little more than whataboutism.
793,"&gt;But like I said, you account for 25% of the death toll of a virus with 4% of the worlds' population."
794,I think you're trusting official statistics a little too much.
795,"Do you really believe that China has had only 4,848 deaths from COVID?"
796,"But then again, you are a bit of an authoritarian who wants to impose your will on everyone around you, so of course you'd trust a Communist government who imprisons dissidents who contradict the official narrative."
797,"If you believe the official Chinese numbers, you're a bigger fool than you sound."
798,Just look at the world map.
799,I guess it's just sheer coincidence that the nations with freer press have higher COVID numbers.
800,Apparently freedom of the press causes more COVID deaths.
801,Or those governments are lying about those numbers and rubes like you swallow them wholesale because it fits your narrative that America = bad.
802,"A ""useful idiot"" is what Vladimir Lenin would call you."
803,"You can twist and turn this any way you want but currently the EU are exporting hundreds of millions of vaccines, and the UK none."

805,"I feel so dumb asking this, but can someone explain the difference between administration and distribution?"
806,They‚Äôre so similar and it‚Äôs throwing me off
807,"Idk if there are national breakdowns, but Ohio shows 11% of people in their 30's vaccinated."
808,Missouri looks similar.
809,"These states are not outliers at the top of the vaccination list, but more in the middle/bottom."
810,Most breakdowns show about half of people have gotten both shots.
811,"So if we conservatively assume 5% of US adults in their 30's have received both shots, let's guesstimate 5% of ~30 million people (both true numbers are probably a bit higher) which is ~1.5 million people, with probably no more than a handful of suspicious deaths."
812,"I think it‚Äôs gotten a little better over the last few weeks, but I agree."
813,"I‚Äôve been updating my friends on the vaccine progress, they were all surprised to hear we‚Äôre going to hit 1/10 Americans fully vaccinated and 1/5 partially vaccinated this week."

819,"Essentially, yes."
820,"That's really what it means when something like this becomes ""endemic."""
821,It's also possible that the viruses we currently think of as seasonal cold and flu viruses started out as larger threats to people's health (or so I've read).
822,"I'd love to see some of the states with mass vaccination centers like the ones utilizing stadiums, convention centers, or with huge FEMA or military sites offer a sort of 'open season' day like once a week."
823,No appointments.
824,Just drive up.

826,No requirements.....
827,"&gt;You're strawmanning me

No, you were just not clear enough, I think."
828,&gt;The booster lowering efficacy compared to letting a single dose play out makes perfect sense.
829,That's why Sputnik V opted to use 2 different adenoviruses...to circumvent the vector immunity.
830,The booster shot not increasing efficacy is what makes sense and why Sputnik V opted for 2 different vectors.
831,You are the one strawmanning *me* now üòÖüòÇ.
832,"I said that efficacy *dropping* as a result of the second dose is what does *not* make sense and you said that it did, vaguely citing anti-vector immunity as the reason."
833,"&gt;Now, I agree 1 dose of J&amp;J could very well reach into the 80s if given enough time to reach peak antibody levels."
834,I never said that üòÇüòÇ I said that it was imaginable that a second dose could push it to 80%.
835,&gt;That would make it the best single dose we have so far.
836,"As of right now, it's definitely not the best, be it overall or compared to other vaccines' one dose regimens."
837,"&gt;It could very well be the case that the booster modestly increases efficacy, but increases duration to a substantial degree."
838,That's the case.
839,It's well established and researched.
840,The second dose is definitely gonna increase the duration of the immunity.
841,It's highly unlikely to have a significant impact on efficacy.
842,"It's a very safe assumption, but an assumption nonetheless."
843,We'll see.
844,It's amazing to be honest.
845,Both my wife (her daughter) and I have got our first shots here in the states while only her mother (because she's a teacher) has got theirs over there.
846,"Her dad is late 60's, and my wife's grandparents (91 for nonno, 85 for nonna) haven't got theirs."
847,Hopefully they can get it sped up because we're coming in August.
848,So instead of a few weeks you really meant a month and a half

851,‚ÄúJust two more weeks‚Äù

859,Thanks!
860,If you file with direct deposit the checks will start going out the week of the 22nd.
861,Paper checks will arrive the week after.
862,"I know they keep saying distribution is very high, and everyone is complaining about eligibility, but at least in my state as of yesterday's update from the OHA
""Oregon has now administered a cumulative total of 1,179,510 first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines."
863,"To date, 1,418,455 doses of vaccine have been delivered to sites across Oregon."""
864,Which is 83% of the doses have been used.
865,Do other states have extremely high supply that they aren't using?
866,Got mine yesterday.. super easy so far!
867,Congrats!
868,!
869,"Also daily vaccinations are not static, they are increasing."
870,They have been increasing at an average rate of about 30K vaccinations per day on average nationally.
871,The ~30K per day average increase has been fairly consistent since the beginning of January.
872,"It‚Äôs not a consistent increase every day, but the trend has been consistent."
873,If the trend holds we should be vaccinating 3 million per day by the end of March and 4 million per day by the end of April.
874,"Who knows if that will hold, but I expect that 2 million per day is likely the lower limit unless there is a significant impact to supply."
875,It may be be more deadly relatively speaking (so far both types very low) ..but t least it is not something very scary like sweating sickness that killed within hours of infection!
876,No.
877,The second dose is automatically scheduled once the first one is given.
878,BTW screw you allergies... you're making me cough and have itchy throat right now really sucks and scares me.
879,I've had my first shot and scheduled to have second on Friday but damn you allergies for making me feel this way.
880,"Got it yesterday -- just some arm soreness and then I feel a little flushed today, but that's about it."
881,I think that‚Äôs quite a reasonable position.
882,"Telling people to keep living like this even after being vaccinated is I think a bridge too far for the vast majority, and starts to get a little unreasonable (even if it‚Äôs not technically over yet)."
883,"Plus in 4 weeks, we will have a HUGE number of people vaccinated in the US, meaning not only will you have slashed your own transmission to others, but the people you‚Äôre potentially transmitting to will also be largely immune, at least those who are at the greatest risk from you."
884,When should we expect the stimulus checks to arrive to bank accounts?
885,"If you're a male over 6 ft, that's not that crazy."
886,I'm damned near 30 and wear 34 in pants.
887,I could stand to lose 20 pounds but I'm definitely not obese
888,Way to go!
889,It's exciting to see stories of people being vaccinated across the world.
890,It was slow in our area and has just rocketed in the last week.
891,"It‚Äôs coming, hang on a bit longer!"
892,"Got my first Moderna shot, no pain but flush/euphoric and not complaining about arthritis or acid pains...  can't complain, really!"
893,I do appreciate a good delirium.
894,"Yes, there's about an average delay of around 2-3 days between jabbing and the jab being reported, based on the day vaccine administered on the CDC dashboard."
895,"Well, when some parties panic when a new variant is discovered... the pandemic never ends."
896,Obese people dying and taking up hospitals is what outs strain on a society.
897,You need to educate yourself more on how the intricacies of society works before whining so much about it
898,"ot didn't, i just got the shot :)"
899,To the limit what to the limit uh hu
900,I don‚Äôt see Vermont or Wyoming doing better; they have fewer people
901,You mean April 5 of course
902,"Felt like I got slugged in the arm for a few hours, otherwise no."
903,"The side effects are very ‚Äúyour mileage may vary‚Äù from person to person as I understand it, though"
904,"I‚Äôm no doctor.. but as tragic as it is, young people like you describe die every day for a huge variety of reasons that aren‚Äôt immediately obvious."
905,My girlfriends cousin collapsed last year in the parking lot of his work.
906,"27 years old, healthy, athlete, no co-morbidities... spent 3 months in the hospital getting a pacemaker put in and loads of other stuff and procedures."
907,If he had just gotten the vaccine it would look like that‚Äôs what did it... but it was just a freak health thing that they still can‚Äôt identify the root cause of.
908,"I‚Äôd also add that moderna (not sure about Pfizer) is testing 3 separate things:

-if a third shot of a half dose of the existing vaccine provides better protection against the SA variant

-if ‚Äúthird‚Äù booster targeting the SA variant provides better protection for those who have already received the existing two dose regimen."
909,-if the same booster can be used as the beginning of a two dose regimen for someone who has not yet been vaccinated.
910,So it‚Äôs possible we could see different things available depending on where you are in the process as well.
911,"I wouldnt say that, plenty of older people then her have survived covid without the vaccine many didnt even know they had it."
912,"Ah, I see."
913,Death as a spectator sport.

919,"Preventing it would involve a truly massive police crackdown, the magnitude of which they have neither the manpower nor the morale for."
920,"And, depending on the state, possibly not even the legal basis to do so."
921,"When I say brainless i don't really mean unintelligent, I admit that the way I worded it blew it out of proportion a bit."
922,"This was never about intelligence, IQ or education, well informed and educated people are no different."
923,Some really smart people make stupid decisions that cost peoples lives all the time.

947,I deleted my Twitter over the last year because it has just become so unbelievably toxic for mental health and overall societal health.
948,I got my flu shot at a Target last year.
949,"Quick, easy, free, and I got a $5 gift card."
950,"The more places that can put shots in arms, the better."
951,100%.
952,Put this sucker on full blast!
953,"I am at my wits end with the ""one year ago X happened"" posts."
954,I don't know if you are seeing them in the subs you frequent but the wrestling sub has been getting a lot of them since it was around this time last year when wrestling shows with crowds stopped and all the promotions tried to figure out how to stay running during the pandemic.
955,"The ""remember when the world didn't suck"" posts are depressing and are usually just cheap karma grabs."
956,Sounds like your feelings.
957,You feel they don‚Äôt deserve it because of your own value system.
958,I‚Äôm sure the line is just right below you on who should get it.
959,Surely smokers shouldn‚Äôt.
960,What about people who do not exercise daily?
961,What about people who have eaten fried food?
962,What about people who consume alcohol?
963,By your own logic in your second paragraph it makes sense why obese people should get the vaccine first.
964,"If they‚Äôre more likely to have severe symptoms, it‚Äôll put a greater strain on society."
965,"If they get the vaccine and don‚Äôt need to be hospitalized, it‚Äôs less strain on society."
966,"If the US keeps ramping it up, and we get through our population, my bet would be that a lot of the extra vaccines would be going to Canada."
967,"They're one of our most important trading partners, and share a huge border with us."
968,&gt; or 500% less.
969,"well, no that's not possible"
970,Think about the thousands of wasted doses because of the eligibility requirements.
971,Sometimes logic is just not logical
972,"I tried going to my university campus last weekend to do some reading outside (had to get out of the house to focus), and I was told to either put on my mask or leave campus."
973,I was outdoors and alone...no one except me and the security guard.

979,a couple years ago I got HFM from my kid that brought it home from daycare.
980,"When the stuff was growing on my hands, feet and mouth (hahah seriously though it sucked) I wore latex gloves and a mask when I went to the doctor because I didn't know what the hell it was and I didn't know if it was airborne or not."
981,People looked at me weird but I didn't care because I just wanted to be sure.
982,[deleted]
983,I suppose it is interesting to know what percentage of people have COMPLETED their vaccination as per the defined protocol?
984,"This isn't a value judgement, it is just an interesting view of the data."
985,Some of y'all are treating this like arguing about sports statistics of your favorite cricket teams.
986,Well look at the U.K. they had the U.K. strain then 3 months later it was a bigger mess than before.
987,Thank you!
988,I'd say kicking someone out of a store is pretty effective enforcement.
989,Well I just hit Day 7 6 minutes ago!

996,You're strawmanning me.
997,"I never said 4 weeks wasn't enough in general, I'm saying 4 weeks was likely premature for J&amp;J due to vector resistance."
998,The booster lowering efficacy compared to letting a single dose play out makes perfect sense.
999,That's why Sputnik V opted to use 2 different adenoviruses...to circumvent the vector immunity.
1000,"Now, I agree 1 dose of J&amp;J could very well reach into the 80s if given enough time to reach peak antibody levels."
1001,That would make it the best single dose we have so far.
1002,"80+% and 90+% are pretty close, and would make J&amp;J single dose nearly as effective as w doses of the M-RNA vaccines."
1003,"Now, something that isn't being brought up is duration of immunity."
1004,"It could very well be the case that the booster modestly increases efficacy, but increases duration to a substantial degree."
1005,"If all goes fairly well, I‚Äôd assume mask requirements will be dropped once the vaccine has been made available to everyone who wants it?"
1006,Big step!
1007,Furnace Fest?
1008,People that age are terribly fragile.
1009,My husband's grandmother recently died at age 93.
1010,She had developed a UTI and had to be hospitalized.
1011,She collapsed while walking in her hospital room.
1012,The injuries from the fall killed her.
1013,Sad that she managed to avoid Covid but died from being weakened by a common ailment.
1014,I live near the town in TX where this story happened.
1015,"It's really stirred up the anti-vaxxers, they're talking about this being proof the vaccines are worthless, so why bother risking side effects if you're not going to be immune afterwards."
1016,"Rational people are trying to point out that if the vaccines are keeping nursing home residents out of the ICU, they're working as intended."
1017,I  heard that some of the nursing home employees weren't vaccinated.
1018,It's a problem.
1019,"Lots of people here DO want the vaccines, a large drive through vaccine  hub in the same town as the nursing home is doing thousands of vaccines a week."
1020,"But too many people, even medical personnel, are refusing it because they don't believe it's effective or they fear it's harmful."
1021,"My ""feeling"" is not logical, but *yours* is?"
1022,The catch is that you have to fight a polar bear to get to the injection site.
1023,Big deal.
1024,total population of 3/4 of million people.
1025,California could vaccinate all of that in just 5 days.
1026,July 1 at the latest.
1027,"Yes, we certainly do."
1028,"This includes people with hypertension, heart conditions, and obesity."
1029,"So, it casts a pretty wide net and should hopefully get more folks with appointments."
1030,&gt; Im not sure i understand.
1031,You don't understand that 1 month is a larger period of time than 1 week?

1037,"I know we hate entertaining the idea that the vaccine could kill a young person, but I‚Äôm not gonna lie, from the story it looks like the vaccine messed her up."
1038,She started feeling bad soon after the second jab.
1039,Her liver ultimately failed.
1040,That doesn‚Äôt just randomly happen in young people.
1041,I‚Äôm going to watch this story closely.
1042,"Pfizer were also very delayed, for what it's worth."
1043,"Awesome, thanks for the reply"
1044,Good news‚Äîopening day is in fact a few weeks away
1045,No it‚Äôs not logical and fair.
1046,Urban areas are not getting their fair share.
1047,Alaska done did it.
1048,"You're right, people going through trauma actually often make ill-advised decisions."
1049,"That doesn't make them ""brainless"", just human."
1050,"You do the same thing, and so do I. I'm just arguing against your idea that people are stupid for making poor decisions during the pandemic."
1051,"Yes, some people are not as smart as others, but someone's intelligence is not necessarily their choice, but a product of the environment they've grown up in and the information they've taken in (minus some mental disorders which could also affect things)."
1052,Combine poor education with worldwide trauma and you're bound to get people that make poor decisions.
1053,This is why I said it isn't practical or feasible to expect 100 percent adoption of 100 percent of mitigation procedures.
1054,That just isn't doable for the entire population.
1055,I think I saw something about 6 weeks of testing when they announced them about 2 weeks ago.
1056,I‚Äôd expect some kind of info in the next month or so.
1057,Not sure when we could realistically expect them to be available or distributed.
1058,"Everything I‚Äôve read seems to imply it wouldn‚Äôt be a thing til late summer/fall, if even at all."
1059,"I‚Äôm under the impression that this is all precautionary and more to just make sure they can if/when needed, though if I‚Äôm being fair I‚Äôm sure the allure of more money and Max protection will result in them coming out at some point before the end of 2021."
1060,"Oh yeah the same people who one year ago said the science doesn‚Äôt support that masks work, when in fact, the science already supported it."
1061,"Uh, it didn‚Äôt have anything to do with feelings but thanks for your reply?"
1062,Just another case of obese people putting a strain on society.
1063,My kroger pharmacist said if situation arises they are to approach  store customers people individually and not of course announce it over the loudspeaker.
1064,I think time is the only remedy for that.
1065,Humanity has overcome a lot of plagues and disease before this.
1066,"Imagine being in Europe during the Black Death, seeing massive swaths of the population die, have literally no clue why this is happening outside of some vague idea that God was mad."
1067,The amount of fear and terror must have been off the charts.
1068,"But, time goes by, things seem calm, and people move onward."

1073,"Feel kind of shitty, but overall very much worth it."
1074,I guess most do.
1075,We should be proud to save the most humans at risk.
1076,Even more prople would be willing to share the doses if some did not cut the promised production by more than half.
1077,Does anyone actually enforce this?
1078,"Is Oklahoma allowing people from Arkansas to get vaccinated there, or did they have to lie about their residency?"
1079,I am 30 min from Oklahoma border and have some older family members who don‚Äôt qualify yet in Arkansas but are eager to get the vaccine.
1080,I'm seriously wondering if there is another coronavirus sub that doesn't tolerate hostile anti-mitigation people as this one has clearly gotten taken over by that group.
1081,Their 2 or more anti-mitigation subs weren't enough.
1082,But also not looking for an extreme opposite where people live up to the most ridiculous exaggerations these anti-mitigation people pretend everyone who disagrees with them believe and say.
1083,I am fully vaccinated as of today and couldn't be any happier.
1084,I assume you got offended.
1085,Check cdc stats Florida is now by far the leader in the new variants.
1086,And it is a shit hole full of uneducated science deniers.
1087,thank you for your input basement-dwelling troll
1088,well... the fact that it's in the title of the article makes me think it might matter.
1089,"DeSantis has already said that 55-59 would open up a week after 60-64, before we knew the exact date the ages were moving down to 60+."
1090,"For context, that‚Äôs double the population of the UP of Michigan."
1091,I agree.
1092,"It is hard to balance the needs of the many with my personal desire that this is ""over."""
1093,"I didn't say you didn't care about anything, you need to read more carefully."
1094,I said not caring is archaic.
1095,"How and who you apply that comment to is on you, not me."
1096,"These cards are needed because the entire world isn't digital, and moving them to purely digital would be a cost prohibitive tax on the poor, and impossible for the ultra poor and those without connectivity to the level they don't rely on the digital world, still."
1097,"Your social security card works both digitally and with a physical card, these vaccinations will be the same."
1098,"It's likely that we'll see a continuation of the enforcement with the cards like we have with the rollout, it'll likely be up to the local level officials as to what is required and what isn't, for local travel and access to local venues/services, and on the federal level they'll likely integrate existing databases and vaccination records, not an easy task, but not an insurmountable or foreign one, either."
1099,"If you need to have your vaccination records to do it on the interstate and federal level, you'll likely need a real ID to do it, anyway, so it's not like it's that much harder to just add and tick a box in that database."
1100,Houston and Dallas are actually better for lower income people than Austin thanks to the lower cost of living.
1101,"Not more quality, but definitely more bang for the buck."
1102,If you have essentially infinite money then cost of living doesn't really matter to you.
1103,Why does that matter?

1109,Sounds totally reasonable to me.

1148,This is possible because Alaska is receiving far more doses per capita than the other states ‚Äî roughly 60% more than WA state for example.
1149,This is true for several other states that have wider eligibility like OK (but not all).
1150,"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations

Shocking but receiving more vaccines helps you vaccinate your population much faster."
1151,"Chose, contractually obliged."
1152,Since AZ doesn‚Äôt have anywhere close to 10m doses on handin the UK how about they skip shipping to the UK for the next 6 weeks or so to help offset their lack of choosing or honoring their EU contract?
1153,Seems perfectly  reaaonable to me given they have the choice as you put it.

1155,"The hype around Cuomo was real, as was the resentment on the other side - remember all the talking heads on late night referencing themselves as, ""Cuomosexuals""?"
1156,"It got embarrassing there for a bit, as it wasn't a secret for those that cared that Cuomo had the 2nd worst death rate in the US and had implemented the nursing home policy, which I guarantee was significant contributing factor.. we don't know exactly the relationship, but that is because Cuomo's admin hid the figures."
1157,"For me, that is enough and I'd want his resignation, but I don't live in NY and have a hard time getting past that."
1158,"Is kinda like asking how effective a water hose is on a fire, when just before asking you were pouring gasoline."
1159,Plus the spikes in cases take a long time.
1160,The winter spike we saw was the result of an upward trend that began in September/October.
1161,"If Texas was gonna see a spike in cases due to lifting mandates, it would be smothered by vaccinations before it could ever gain traction."
1162,"The CDC is always going to use the most cautious approach, so for them to be using language like ""a little bit longer"" shows that they see the writing on the wall."
1163,"We're sort of in a grey zone, where things are looking better by the week, but the large majority of the country is still unvaccinated and won't have access for a little while longer."
1164,They probably don't want an Israel situation where most of the high risk population has the shot and then the kids go ballistic in tossing caution to the wind and keeping the case count high.
1165,You seem like a fun person

1184,These 4 million shots will go to regions that have a very high percentage of covid cases.
1185,You could say it's for the regions that were the most foolish.
1186,"We got 100.000 extra doses in Austria for Tyrolia, because some people decided to travel to South Africa and brought the most harmful strain with them."
1187,The region with the most cases will get the 100k and that's enough for all of them.
1188,So 4 mill for the highest risk regions might be a very good idea
1189,There are a few issues here.
1190,"First, it‚Äôs a preprint, so I take all findings and conclusions with a grain of salt."
1191,"Second, it‚Äôs based on results of an internet survey."
1192,"They sent the survey to ~120,000 people, of which ~6,000 declared they‚Äôd had COVID."
1193,"From what I can see, the diagnosis were not independently verified."
1194,"From other studies I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôd agree that long Covid does effect some people, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be particularly prevalent."
1195,Except the removal of restrictions went into effect today.
1196,So cases went up while they still had the restrictions.

1202,Stay home and cook your own food
1203,"Yeah sure ""they're supposed to"" because its ""autonomous""."

1227,Well the idea of getting vaccinated is so that you could touch your passport again as soon as possible...
1228,Many of my friends are planning a trip to Mexico or the Carribean as soon as they're vaccinated.
1229,[removed]
1230,For real.
1231,Israel has also donated a small number of doses to PA and will probably do more once Israel is fully vaxxed.
1232,People act like Israel could just waltz into Gaza and start giving out vaccines.
1233,That‚Äôs what happens when a state only has 6 people leaving in it.
1234,Simply put this shouldn‚Äôt be as scary as some people can make it sound.

1241,what?
1242,this statement contradicts itself.
1243,"it would require invasive, in depth, costly research to prove anything since we stopped tracking individual cases and contacts."
1244,"to assert *this is within the realm of possibility, according to research* does not confirm anything, nor is it a narrative."
1245,no outcome can actually be confirmed.
1246,"it seems almost like youre implying that because we dont have the tools or information to confirm the effects, we should just say nothing happened, and move on

what the factual evidence in this study does confirm (that counties with the largest number of sturgis attendees had much higher infections following the rally than those with no sturgis attendees) is still rather significant."
1247,"it may not confirm the people in those counties got it from the rally, rather than someone willing to attend an event like sturgis is more likely to fail to adhere to prevention guidelines."
1248,"but timing would allude to the former, if not both."

1272,FWIW I live in MD where people are passing around the sign up link circumventing the process meant to screen for eligibility and the ineffective ‚Äúhonor system‚Äù due to lack of resources for vetting.

1284,"The problem with Pfizer scaling up is that their process requires some eye wateringly expensive hardware, that is specialist made and was in short supply."
1285,There is a hard limit to how fast they can grow their facilities.
1286,"A big chunk of their scaling up in the near future is from improving the efficiency of their current production lines, it used to take around 100 days to go from nothing to having a phial, Pfizer are in the process of trying to half that time which means they would double production... if they can get enough more suppliers for the complex ingredients they require."
1287,"All scaling up has issues, that's why the best option is to make a variety of different types of vaccines in whatever existing facilities are available, then retool to get even more of the vaccines that work."
1288,If you were fully vaccinated (i.e.
1289,"you have completed the shot regimen, and enough time has elapsed for max protection), would you still actively avoid contact with individuals who have confirmed COVID-19 and are still in their 10 day isolation period?"
1290,Likewise would you also actively avoid contact with individuals living with them that are still under a 14 quarantine period?
1291,What I don't understand is that their daily number of cases and deaths is still relatively high.

1295,"Yeah, people forget that the goal the entire time was to 'flatten the curve', meaning not overrun hospitals."
1296,I don't see how we can risk overrunning hospitals in Texas (or other states) for that matter even after removing restrictions.
1297,The people who are most likely to die or be hospitalized are getting vaccinated in very high numbers and cases have been going down.
1298,"Yes COVID is still around, but it really feels like we have flattened the curve and I can't really see that changing from here on out."

1301,A lot of folks are teleworking or have been implementing similar measures as the civilian sector.
1302,"I work at a desk all day, so it is easy for me to socially distance and wear a mask like other people."
1303,Folks like me are lucky to get the vaccine because we are able to keep the mission going while still maintaining health measures.
1304,"I think it would make more sense if you were talking about folks who are deployed or set to deploy, particularly for those in the navy."

1316,"So am I understanding the transmission thing correct in interpreting it as, ""if you happen to be in the 5% of people who still get covid after getting both doses of the vaccine, then there is less than a 10% chance that you will then transmit the virus to another person""?"
1317,Yes but not because of an export ban but because AstraZeneca chooses to deliver it's UK orders first.
1318,The UK has no influence in the decision other than the contract.
1319,For example if AZ shipped 10 million doses to the EU tomorrow they would get there with absolutely no problems.

1543,Be sure to get there early!
1544,"The line gets pretty long, but the whole process only took about an hour including the waiting period for side effects."
1545,"It is literal, textbook gaslighting."
1546,"Also the smarmy, dismissive ‚Äúsorry you have to cook at home and can‚Äôt lick doorknobs‚Äù attitude from people who cannot seem to understand that peoples jobs and livelihoods have been ruined."
1547,I had people flat out tell me to my face that ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù was never a thing.
1548,Jesus Christ.
1549,These people are just desperate to blame someone.

1557,History shows it‚Äôs cyclical.
1558,We‚Äôll get both.
1559,Just a matter of when.
1560,No happy ending for this poor guy!
1561,"&gt;But what if, in the five days between the game and when you start feeling symptoms, you go to the grocery store, where I'm also shopping?"
1562,That‚Äôs on you to evaluate the risk.
1563,If someone isn‚Äôt feeling any symptoms then they‚Äôre not going to stay in the house.
1564,"As if it wasn't already a challenge having misinformed people screaming about their rights and threatening store workers, now the Gov."
1565,who's supposed to have their backs crumbles to his fears of not being re-elected.
1566,YOU'RE KILLING YOUR OWN CONSTITUTENTS.....but I guess that's fine if it's the economically and racially disparaged.
1567,"I used to feel the same in NYC and then suddenly the tide started turning, more and more people started realizing how absurd the shutdown was and things started slowly opening up."
1568,It sucks but it will change before you even realize it.
1569,&gt; I think Texas is somewhere in the bottom 5 for vaccinations per capita.
1570,"Texas is low in per capita vaccination rates, but has consistently used a significant portion of its allotted doses."
1571,"States don't receive equal numbers of vaccine doses per capita from the Federal government, meaning states can do a fantastic job getting shots in arms but ultimately fail to vaccinate as many because they don't have the doses."
1572,"For example, Alaska has given 25% of its population at least a single dose, but has used 70% of its doses."
1573,"Texas, meanwhile, has used 75% of its doses but has only given 16% of the population at least one dose."
1574,"Assuming Texas used 100% of its doses, it would be able to get around 21% of its population vaccinated with a single dose, assuming the same ratio of single doses to fully vaccinated."
1575,It would still lose to Alaska no matter how great a job it did.
1576,It's unclear to me how the Feds are allocating doses.
1577,"I'd bet median age is a factor, but not the only factor, as we'll see."
1578,Texas has a low median age; it is one of the youngest states.
1579,"Given how heavily age impacts death rates, it makes sense to me that Texas has a lower allocation of doses."
1580,"Utah is also young, has high vaccine utilization, but a low allocation."
1581,"Again, it makes sense to me."
1582,"It now makes me wonder why Alaska, which is just slightly younger than Texas, has such a high allocation of doses."
1583,"Or why South Carolina, which is older, has a lower allocation, despite high utilization."
1584,"Yeah, I'll be looking for Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax (if it's ever approved) when it's my turn."
1585,No one will convince me otherwise.... not unless new studies come out and show J&amp;J magically improves.
1586,"Either way, the messaging on here is crazy."
1587,People need to stop trying to tell people how to handle their own health.
1588,Freedumb = dumb.
1589,"Only stupid people want autonomy and self determination, authoritarian dictatorship is much better /s"
1590,4 million is pretty much nothing for 446 million people.
1591,This won't change a thing.
1592,Trolling used to be so much more entertaining than the flamebait-reliant trash your batch serves up now.
1593,Do better.
1594,Good!
1595,Not a single dose should be wasted.
1596,"While well intentioned, the tier system most states have in place make less sense when vaccine supply is rapidly increasing."
1597,"&amp;#x200B;

The less hurdles in place the less likely we are to make things too difficult for people."
1598,The excessive documentation requirements at some locations in Florida have already seen people with legitimate health issues turned away because they could not get ahold of their doctor fast enough.
1599,Some of the folks interviewed didn't have a PCP or insurance to be able to get the correct documentation.
1600,"I'm glad a state is trying the ""free-for-all"" approach that has thus far only been a thought experiment."
1601,My gut feeling tells me that rapidly getting shots into ANY arm may have a bigger uplift to the COVID-vulnerable community than trying to arduously target them directly.
1602,Will be interesting to see how this plays out in relation to other states using different approaches.
1603,"But the governor, who is ignoring medical experts, is in his lane?"
1604,The problem they have is that the UK is unlikely to restrict international travel to only vaccinated citizens/residents.
1605,It would take a change in law to do so and would likely be discriminatory.
1606,Come May/June they need to open outbound travel up to everyone which needs a risk assessment on destination countries and their vaccine rollouts.
1607,"For example, the USA is a major destination for UK residents (myself included) and it would be wise to wait for the proclamation to be revoked before booking travel there, so in part the advice is useful common sense."
1608,I (perhaps unwisely) have already booked flights and accommodation for a summer trip to the US which may not happen.
1609,What even is this source?
1610,Thanks for the info.
1611,I have some teacher friends who qualify but didn't hop on it when I told them to on Friday when CVS started taking reservations here.
1612,This is available on the vaccine tracker sites like Bloomberg
1613,I don‚Äôt disagree with you that this makes brexit look good and kinda has nothing to do with it.
1614,"But it‚Äôs important to note that the Uk had nothing to do with the eu failures in procurement, of which there are many."
1615,This is an old but good article exploring some of the differences we are seeing today: [link](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.politico.eu/article/europe-coronavirus-vaccine-struggle-pfizer-biontech-astrazeneca/amp/)
1616,Karen's are not going to happy about this
1617,"The stigma comes from people touting one of the dumbest new phrases I've heard in my lifetime, ""trust the science""."
1618,"Blind faith is one of the most unscientific things I can imagine, and 'appeal to authority' is a stupid position to take as if scientists themselves are perfectly amoral characters who never have financial or social incentives to either bend the truth or outright lie about their results."
1619,Do I think that happened here?
1620,No.
1621,I haven't seen any solid evidence of it myself.
1622,"Do I think people, who in the first months, questioned COVID vaccine safety are on the same level as people who refuse to get **any** vaccines **ever**?"
1623,"Also no, but that stupid equation was made by people who love ridiculous 'pop science' stuff online and dumb people on this subreddit who treat scientists like comic book characters, and not people who can have flawed ambitions like anyone else."
1624,Holy shit I‚Äôm glad you are ok.
1625,"I feel like lost in all this, is the HCWs."
1626,Like seeing these idiots protesting having to wear masks and crying about their freedoms (what freedoms?
1627,To go to a fucking Applebee‚Äôs and then swing by a target to buy more shit?
1628,"), is just such a slap in the face to the HCWs."
1629,"It‚Äôs a shame some people claim to be Patriots and love our military and first responders, yet they actively engage in behaviors that fill up our hospitals and ICU‚Äôs."
1630,I have friends that are HCWs and seeing their Facebook posts pleading for people to take this seriously and their description of their experience has been absolutely heartbreaking.
1631,I‚Äôll forever be ashamed how we just turned our back on HCWs and basically told them to fuck off.
1632,Why couldn‚Äôt we at least do it for them?
1633,Why do we devalue their service and life?
1634,"Anyways, glad you recovered and made it through Internet stranger."
1635,So you believe it is just a play for PR?
1636,"Seems bizarre, imagine the PR they could get with, AZ are struggling with production so we set up another site, plays perfectly into the EU play book, plus it's a not for profit vaccine that is easy to distribute to third world countries, and both doses are the same."
1637,"I'm not sure how ""we helped the Russians produce their vaccine and helped them make a profit whilst doing it"" will play out to the EU's voters."
1638,"There must be a reason but I'm currently just not seeing the benefit of producing a vaccine that hasn't been authorised and who many in the EU ridiculed during the trials stage for rushing, over a European vaccine that has been approved already."
1639,"Don't get me wrong, I see no issue with the Russian vaccine now we have real time results, I just don't see any benefit to producing it over European ones."
1640,"I'm not sure what's the big deal with this announcement, it's not like they are the only ones."
1641,"States like Georgia and 20 others have never had a statewide mask mandate, it's been up to the local municipalities."
1642,"Georgia has also been wide open for business since August, most places are 100% capacity and we have not had any more cases per 1000 capita than states that are locked down."
1643,They say follow the science all the time!!
1644,"I'm fine with a mask, I'm sure they help and I wear mine all the time when in public but there is definitely science behind lockdowns based on the numbers every month over the last year per 1000 capita when you compare open states to locked down states."
1645,What am I missing besides the political angle?
1646,So that's 53% (at least one jab) + 8% (confirmed went through the virus) + ?% (unconfirmed went through the virus).
1647,What you're saying is that very few people went through the virus without being tested?
1648,Reality: very few people have been fully vaccinated.
1649,I think it's like 14 percent.
1650,That does not stop community spread.
1651,Stop pretending we didn't have surges exactly when the experts said we would.
1652,It's denial of reality
1653,Another outstanding performance.
1654,How pathetic are you to post an article you didn‚Äôt read?
1655,"Nothing proven, all hypotheses."
1656,Not one sentence in either study supports the claim that ‚Äút cell immunity will last decades‚Äù.
1657,Read your own article before posting it big brain.
1658,As of yesterday right?
1659,New numbers don't come out until this afternoon
1660,"Also from Canada, they usually have a reserve list of qualified people to call in case of this."
1661,"Basically they create a list of eligible people who say they are willing to come in within 30 minutes when called, and if they have extra doses due to cancellation they call down the list until they get someone."
1662,"So no one who isn't already eligible to receive it for some other reason is getting them this way, at least in Ontario."
1663,"&gt; That puts me at risk due to their choices, not my own, allowed by the end of the mandate."
1664,Shop in places that require masks and actually enforce it?
1665,Or is that non-existent in Texas?
1666,"I'm in Tennessee, and the groceries stores I visit still require masks and people seem to (mostly) abide by it."
1667,[removed]
1668,Do her job next üòÅ
1669,"Oh, yes."
1670,Pfizer lets you pay if you want earlier delivery.
1671,Same with the 2nd EU contract which will start deliveries in Q2 long before the 1st contract is fulfilled.
1672,I‚Äôm also unvaccinated and will wear a mask.
1673,"The problem is if I am in line at the grocery store and there is a visibly sick person behind me, coughing without a mask."
1674,"That puts me at risk due to their choices, not my own, allowed by the end of the mandate."
1675,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

1682,"Unfortunately over the past year, at least half of our entire country has demonstrated that they are sociopaths."
1683,The upvoted response to your question with data  shows one confirmed death.
1684,That 60% figure from Novavax only accounted for the HIV- participants.
1685,The overall efficacy rate for the sample as a whole dropped to 49.4% when they included data from the 6% of trial participants who were HIV+.
1686,All HIV+ participants were also regarded as medically stable at the time.

1697,100% effective at preventing serious illness and death.
1698,"If that isn't great to you, I believe you have skewed priorities during a literal pandemic."
1699,Thank you üôèa
1700,I hope the EU demands some form of open borders in exchange for deliveries.
1701,Countries banning travel all together goes against everything the EU stands for.
1702,"I have no issue with mandatory quarantine, proof of negative test and so on but banning travel in the EU is a step too far in my opinion."
1703,"Joe is anti-lockdown for good reasons, never heard him say anything anti-mask."
1704,"Also he‚Äôs smarter than average or he would not have accomplished all that he has, including talking to a multitude of brilliant guests."
1705,It‚Äôs so easy for cowards to call him a moron from behind their keyboards as if they are so much smarter or have done anything better with their lives.
1706,I really appreciate your comment and agree completely.
1707,The stigma of just questioning some injected directly into your bloodstream has gotten ridiculous.
1708,"Oh I have no doubt, but I do think American culture in general might breed more active idiots out there than in some places."
1709,At least I hope the rest of the world has at least slightly less idiots than we do.
1710,She has upper management written all over her...bruh
1711,The point being that they aren't just delivering the 4 million as part of their original contracts (the 600 million) its extra doses (so the EU now has 604 million doses from Pfizer)
1712,I was told to try to avoid taking them right after but if I was still experiencing symptoms after a while then I could.
1713,I tried to wait out the fever for as long as possible but after a few hours I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer and took some Tylenol to break it.
1714,But I did that around 14 hours after I got the initial vaccine
1715,They exist everywhere unfortunately
1716,I got downvoted for asking this a while ago when the CDC said fully vaccinated people can skip the quarantine if they were exposed.
1717,"The whole point of a quarantine is to prevent the spread of the virus if you might have contracted it - but by saying fully vaccinated people can skip the quarantine, they must have been fairly confident they aren't going to contract it or spread it (or at least a much lower chance)."
1718,No province in Canada has anywhere near the case count of Colorado.
1719,[Quebec is closest at 45%](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/covid-19-in-the-u-s-how-do-canada-s-provinces-rank-against-american-states-1.5051033).
1720,I would therefore argue Canadians have been shown much more respect by their government in preventing this deadly illness.
1721,Not the city's job to do this.
1722,But also not the states job to overwrite what the city does unless it's unconstitutional.
1723,Will be interesting to see how this one pans out
1724,America can‚Äôt get props for shit on Reddit
1725,Thank God you don't speak for the UK.
1726,Why anyone would want to start a vaccine war I don't know.
1727,"This is just point scoring stuff from politicians, let the EU have a moan, who cares as long as we continue with the status quo."
1728,The majority of the EU and the UK will be vaccinated before Autumn as long as we don't fuck with each others supplies which I don't believe either side will.
1729,It's not a competition.
1730,65% (which it was higher in American data anyway) is better than 0%.
1731,"If you're so inclined, grab a mRNA vaccine as a booster at a later date."
1732,Take whatever shot you can in the mean time.
1733,"&gt; Seems like they need to be purchased by individual countries

This is the same for all EU vaccine contracts."
1734,The EU commission negotiates the terms (e.g.
1735,price and total pool size) of vaccines but it's still up to each individual member to buy (pay) them.
1736,"This is great news, has anyone tried using it inside the body?"
1737,"They act like this is some sort of ""protest"", when it's actually just how the government is designed."
1738,"Drop the state mandate, and now individual counties and cities can decide for themselves."
1739,"This, so much this!"
1740,I'm a pharmacist in the same boat.
1741,"We actually could give more shots in a day, and have the vaccine to do it, except we don't have the time because of the insane amount of phone calls and walk up to the counter asking for doses, asking for extra doses, refusing to listen when we tell them they just have to go to the website and make an appointment."
1742,"I cannot get across how much time all these phone calls are taking, literally every 2 to 3 minutes for 12 hours straight."
1743,"Everyone calling and asking is slowing down the process, literally."
1744,"I mean, yeah."
1745,Why wouldn't there be exceptions?
1746,"Because it takes time to build up capacity and capacity on AZ, J&amp;J and Pfizer will be enormous before this Sputnik site is operating."
1747,But making some Sputnik doses does perhaps work better for PR than announcing that Pfizer will deliver 500 million doses by Q3..
1748,"These extra 4 million doses are an increase in production from the first contract, so I guess they will be able to increase even further the 47M doses they are planning to send in April."
1749,Pfizer is truly saving our ass.
1750,"Man, right Florida when Florida was recovering from that super bowl super spreader event in Tampa."
1751,Some just want to be pissed at others for living again while they cry in their studio apartments and haven‚Äôt left in a year
1752,I hope it's easy!
1753,My first shot made me feel crappy.
1754,I had the sweaty nausea shits where you poop with a wastebasket in front of you.
1755,Again Pfizer could airlift a production facility in the UK today and export the vaccines tomorrow.
1756,You cant do that with a vaccine ban.
1757,"Again like you point out you dont make vaccine orders to countries, you make them to private pharma companies."
1758,"EU has one agreement with AZ, the UK has another but we expect AZ to fulfil it."
1759,The EU could fund 10 AZ plants in the UK and all 10 would be able to export the vaccines.
1760,Red faced Alex Jones on his megaphone yelling about his freedums as he waves the American Flag.
1761,Don‚Äôt think she is white &amp; it‚Äôs shameful that you assumed she‚Äôs white based on her behaviour
1762,I do have that luxury.
1763,I've already had Covid so I already have some level of protection.
1764,"And I'll still grab a vaccine, but I can afford to wait for several months."
1765,"And given my situation, I'll probably grab an mRNA vaccine."
1766,But if I hadn't already caught it and recovered...
1767,I'd be trying my best to get the first vaccine available and would have zero qualms about J&amp;J's vaccine.
1768,"Yes, it does no one any good sitting in the refrigerator."
1769,So let me get this straight.
1770,If you are fully vaccinated you still cannot go on a holiday?
1771,How do people find this acceptable in any way?
1772,They should just get it into as many arms as possible as quickly as possible.
1773,"In some Asian countries, they prioritized working people before retired people theorizing that working people have more day to day contacts and interactions, therefore drive the spread while older retired people are able to stay home most of the time."
1774,Alaska has 700k people in it.
1775,Hawaii has double that.
1776,"Or... China made it during their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù of coronaviruses, which we all knew last January."
1777,"‚ÄúIllegal activities.‚Äù  JFC...yes, let‚Äôs call ICE on people because of their activity being brown."
1778,My great aunt is a CNN viewer and was concerned that her penicillin (among other things) allergy meant the vaccine could be dangerous.
1779,I think in this case all of the networks have over reported allergic reactions and have lumped in side effects with allergic reactions.
1780,It took a lot of convincing but myself and several others convinced my aunt to get the vaccine.
1781,She had less of a reaction to it than she does to a seasonal flu shot.
1782,Bots or just morons?
1783,"I really don't see too much bot-like stuff, but I see plenty of morons."
1784,"Is she rich and white, though?"
1785,This is America after all.
1786,"I don't think he understands all the consequences of his actions, but he definitely knows many people will die as a result of the pandemic in Brazil."
1787,"For example, he purposely talks against the use of masks and until very recently said things in agreement with antivaxers (i.e."
1788,"that vaccines will turn you into an alligator, which most know isn't true, but some indigenous tribes believed and are know refusing to vaccinate because of it), but as soon as he could he made sure his mother was vaccinated and to this day we don't know if he was vaccinated or not (bolsonaro uses false names for medical related things so that people can't track what he does)."
1789,But I'd say it's pretty obvious he's vaccinated himself.
1790,"But I don't think he knew that his actions would made Brazil the ideal place for mutations in the virus (nor do I think he cares), as I don't think he listens to anything that doesn't support his agenda."
1791,"His only concerns are himself and his sons, he's willing to fuck up everything else."
1792,Its the other way around.
1793,People preferring the mRNA vaccines and planning on not getting J&amp;J's.
1794,Congratulations on your recovery.

1825,OK IDrinkMyOwnSemen
1826,"not familiar with that area in particular, but in some places they have extra vaccines because of allotment issues."
1827,bear with me on some math.
1828,"hypothetically there are 10,000 in the county and 500 work as first responders of various kinds so in the first wave the town got 500x2 shots to cover them, say there's a native american tribe nearby and they got 200x2 shots to cover them, and the nursing home got 300x2 shots to cover them so effectively 1000 people have already gotten their shot."
1829,"now the county starts getting an allotment based on their population and an allotment based on the number of elderly, and the state maybe put a minimum on each order so every county always got at least 50 per day, etc etc

suddenly you end up with a situation where the county has gotten itself more vaccines than people or more vaccines than the number of eligible people who want it."
1830,that means they will likely be getting less vaccines per day eventaully but whatever they have in stock or already in route will keep coming
1831,I have rheumatoid arthritis and I‚Äôm on Humira.
1832,"They do not disqualify you from the vaccine, you just have to delay taking certain medications if you choose to take it."
1833,"Definitely check with your doctor, but I‚Äôm just saying the live vaccine shouldn‚Äôt be considered IF they get the vaccine."
1834,"It‚Äôs far better to take the vaccine than to experience covid, anyway."
1835,I‚Äôve been in Tallahassee the last couple days looking for a place to live because I‚Äôm moving here next month for a job.
1836,"Most people I‚Äôve encountered do wear masks, but every store etc I‚Äôve been to there‚Äôs always been a few maskless people wandering around."
1837,"It‚Äôs sort of shocking coming from Massachusetts / Colorado where everybody always wears a mask, without fail."
1838,(I‚Äôve been split between these two areas since pandemic).
1839,I just don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs a political issue.
1840,I don‚Äôt want to die!!
1841,I don‚Äôt want to kill someone else!!
1842,!
1843,My BIL volunteered in AZ and got the vaccine.
1844,He only had to volunteer for a day to get both shots.
1845,The hysteria around this is kind of funny if it wasn't so sad.
1846,I guess it gives people a chance to confirm their political priors.
1847,"All Abbott's order does is allow people, and organizations, to make their own decisions on a local level."
1848,"If you have a store and you want to enforce masking and distancing, have at it."
1849,No one is telling you you can't.
1850,"What are we up to now, 15 other states (including deep blue Connecticut who had many more deaths per capita than Texas) that are doing the same?"
1851,Florida was having that issue and so they passed a law saying only state residents could get it.
1852,In Oklahoma it says you must be a resident when you sign up for the portal.
1853,I assume other states are the same way.
1854,don't Texas cities have Home Rule specifically on the state constitution?
1855,"""How many orders from foreign countries have been sent to the UK for vaccines?"""
1856,"Thats what I responded to, I didn't even say it was a ban, although admittedly I do consider it an export ban."
1857,"Look you can turn this any way you want, but the fact remains that the UK isn't exporting any vaccines."
1858,"Not because they would love to export vaccines and it's all just because no country ever ordered from them, but because they don't allow exports of the one vaccine they are producing."
1859,"What does it even matter if that's a ban or an exclusivity contract, result is the same and it sure as hell is not because of lack of interested foreign parties."
1860,"And it's fine, you are in fact allowed to do that, it's in fact quite understandable, but in practice it is a de facto ban in every way except for semantics."
1861,Lockdowns aren't being strictly followed any more
1862,I vote let Benny administer the vaccines
1863,https://www.croda.com/en-gb/news/2020/11/pfizer-croda

1866,Try to really relax your arm while you get the shot.
1867,I think that probably helped with my second shot.
1868,"No, I wouldn‚Äôt."
1869,I would applaud them for finally doing something anti-big gov.
1870,He most certainly isn't anti-mask.
1871,Do you even listen to his podcast?
1872,"So, vaccines exported during February:

US - 0

UK - 0

EU - 25 million

Italy blocks the export of 100k from AZ, English-speaking media: ""Shame on the EU for being protectionist!"""
1873,Good on the NYT for setting the record straight.
1874,"There are some second doses being delayed, though."
1875,I got mine through health dept.
1876,Was told I was supposed to get a scheduling email about a week or so out from second date to schedule a time for my second shot.
1877,"Got an email recently that it's delayed, they dont know when theyll be scheduling... just a note that it will be within 62 days of the first shot per CDC guidelines and that they'll email when they are."
1878,I am sure you are so much more intelligent and accomplished

1884,The first jab did hurt my arm but moving it helped a ton.
1885,I did ice it and that helped too.
1886,"Almost exactly 24 hours after the shot, it didn't hurt."
1887,The second shot was way more painful and nothing helped for the first day.
1888,By day three it didn't hurt anymore.
1889,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
1890,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
1891,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

1897,"But, if you try and get data from VAERS on the vaccine you have to go to their site- find the C19 page- go through security verifications and only then are you given the option to download the data- you cant view it in simple form on the site."
1898,They DO NOT want the general public to be informed regarding the vaccine and in the US informed consent is a right.
1899,Not only that- but I‚Äôve had several friends that were only told what shot they were given AFTER they were injected.
1900,It‚Äôs unacceptable.
1901,i'm sure they will.
1902,have to assert our influence to the world but not until taking care of home first
1903,Link?
1904,Curious about the study‚Äôs sampling method.
1905,"If you look at the 7 day moving average in Maryland, it has been essentially flat over the past couple of weeks."
1906,The issue is that this trend tends to precipitate a rise in cases shortly thereafter.
1907,"If you start from a high baseline, you'll end up with a high peak and that could be devastating if if gives the virus a better chance to proliferate the more dangerous strains and mutate further."
1908,That's what is already starting to happen in Europe as per Dr. Fauci's comments above.

1922,In terms of personal antibody production and immunity...sure.
1923,"In terms of vaccination statistics, per the headline, it‚Äôs as soon as the individual receives their second shot."
1924,Moderna is four weeks in between doses and Pfizer is three...thus ‚Äúat least three weeks‚Äù.
1925,the 3 in the US are 65-85%~ after the first after about 3 weeks.
1926,btw the goal was 50%.
1927,"Michigan

My grandma hasn't been on her own though."
1928,We've been trying to get her an appointment ever since the vaccines were authorized but no matter what appointments would always be booked up in 5 minutes whether it was with a pharmacy or her doctor or with the county health department.
1929,"And have been unsuccessful until now

It's crazy because this rollout is supposed to be organized but so far its feeling like trying to get a Nike drop."
1930,I think states should go in this direction as well.
1931,"If you want to understand why, just join your local Vaccine Hunters facebook group."
1932,It's mostly just super confused senior citizens trying haphazardly to sign up for an appointment for a vaccine.
1933,They don't have good computer skills.
1934,I suspect there is a lot of lost efficiency logistically here.
1935,It was a fine approach when constrained.
1936,It will soon become the constraint when supply increases (like within the next two weeks).
1937,The coverage of the vaccines has also been abysmal.
1938,The media has been directly comparing 95% to 66% for months and now they're scolding people for preferring mRNA?
1939,"Also the J&amp;J efficacy numbers include mild symptoms of covid as success, while the mRNA ones didn't, right?"
1940,Yet it's all like the news media agreed to not even talk about that.
1941,"I get that there are other confounding factors in favor of J&amp;J and that you can't directly compare the rates, but the media is to blame for why people feel this way in the first place..."
1942,Examples?
1943,We know there won‚Äôt be a 1:1 correlation because of holding back the second shot.
1944,North Dakota is doing something similar .
1945,"They are even trying to pass a bill to make mask mandates illegal outright , because the majority conservative state can't stand the idea of the slightly more liberal city of Fargo governing themselves"
1946,"Right, unfortunately it's been a little confusing for some people."
1947,I have friends who work in the service industry and they've already had a few difficult customers...
1948,It‚Äôs called a joke lol
1949,I think it‚Äôs very common.
1950,But I wonder if it‚Äôs more of a British thing now that I think of it?
1951,I get it.
1952,I really do.
1953,I do not believe that a covid case creates those kinds of costs.
1954,Covid restrictions and lockdowns?
1955,Absolutely they could.
1956,But covid itself didn't restrict or lock people down.
1957,Governmental and legislative bodies did that.
1958,"If these costs were identified as costs due to restrictions imposed, I would be more inclined to believe it."
1959,"Simply saying a covid case created nearly $50,000 in costs is inaccurate, in my opinion."
1960,Probably.
1961,This is the exact reason the don't tell recipients in the vaccine trials if they received the real vaccine or the placebo.
1962,Behavior is effected by that knowledge.
1963,lol what does that even mean?
1964,we should inoculate an entire population based on a glorified hunch?
1965,you know how many vaccines including HIV vaccines had ‚Äúencouraging data‚Äù but fell apart during a proper trial?
1966,Follow the actual confirmed science - give people their doses as the trials intended.
1967,"They weren‚Äôt questioning their move to Texas, they were questioning his move to a liberal city if he‚Äôs so against mask mandates, lockdowns, and other liberal policy"
1968,[removed]
1969,"That's why I said largely, and noted that it's not happening in washington."
1970,Yeah.
1971,Maybe I should just delete this because it‚Äôs not accounting for the snowstorm.
1972,He didn‚Äôt directly say it.
1973,"But under his government, we‚Äôre pushing our second dose to 4 months after the first - something that many Canadian infectious disease experts and doctors are advising against, saying it‚Äôs a political move."
1974,His government is under fire for lack of vaccine doses.
1975,I think the worry from Canadian medical experts is that we‚Äôre pushing doses further apart to look better when it comes to % vaccinated - more in line with other G7 countries - but this isn‚Äôt recommended by the vaccine producers.
1976,Sarcasm is very hard to convey effectively through writing imo
1977,"To people who live in Texas and Mississippi, I wanted to ask, what does public opinion towards mitigation measures look like in your states right now with your governors removing restrictions?"
1978,"Are most people going back to normal or are they still following the guidelines, even though it‚Äôs not mandatory anymore?"
1979,No problem
1980,Thanks!
1981,Making final plans for Denali.
1982,Can‚Äôt wait to be back to Alaska.
1983,This study seems like it‚Äôs looking at asymptomatic cases too?
1984,mRNA VE was always for symptomatic Covid.
1985,I‚Äôve read some people think without a nasal spray shot it‚Äôs possible to still be asymptomatic with Covid since the shot might not concentrate enough antibodies to your nose.
1986,Which is why J&amp;J is testing a nasal spray vaccine.
1987,"I agree with you, but my attack is on CNN."
1988,"Even since I posted, they ramped up another story about motorcycles in Florida."
1989,But where were they during the months of rioting last summer?
1990,I never once saw them condemn the riots out of concern for it being a spreader event.
1991,&gt;People who are vaccinated feel like they have magic shields applied to them the moment they walk out of the pharmacy.
1992,This was my dad just about a week ago.
1993,Got his first Pfizer/Biontech shot on 2/28.
1994,He called me on 3/2 asking if he was fully protected now that he had the shot and it had been 2 days.
1995,"I had to send him the Pfizer press releases about the vaccine just to convince him that no, he wasn't all the sudden protected."
1996,We definitely need to make sure that the messaging is clear on when the stated efficacy is truly expected.
1997,Constant movement will probably help in and of itself.
1998,Otherwise there‚Äôs not a whole lot to do.
1999,"Fortunately, I don‚Äôt think most people have had THAT much trouble with it."
2000,Good luck and congrats!
2001,Canada‚Äôs delaying second doses by 4 months - sounds like an endorsement to me
2002,I think it would be an offer to Canada.
2003,If it‚Äôs not needed then it would quickly go to other countries.
2004,Although I‚Äôm not sure how you don‚Äôt need vaccines but you do need vaccine exports.
2005,"They are one in the same, no?"
2006,"Meanwhile, in Missouri, our governor is punishing cities that didn‚Äôt vote for him."
2007,"I loved your comment about people rearranging the letters of a word because it absolutely drove me nuts that Bret Favre pronounced his name ‚ÄúFarve.‚Äù I argued many times with my family that it was wrong, but their argument was that his family could pronounce their own name any way they wanted."
2008,"To which I said, OK, then pronounce it ‚ÄúSmith.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs just nuts."
2009,"If you change the pronunciation so grossly, just change the damn spelling to match."
2010,"I think I read somewhere that in Israel, cases actually slightly increased for the first two weeks after the 1st dose compared to the unvaccinated?"
2011,Perhaps explained by people thinking they were safe too early and doing risky stuff?
2012,&gt; I'm glad the EU took the opportunity to buy these additional doses when they became available.
2013,"According to the Dutch governement/news, these are not additional."
2014,Just early deliveries of already ordered batches.

2019,"But since they don‚Äôt know those others, they don‚Äôt care."
2020,I am low-risk and could probably attend a super spreader event right now with no risk to myself.
2021,"I don‚Äôt want to kill anyone, though, so I don‚Äôt."
2022,It has been the biggest shock of this pandemic to me that most people in the US are willing to kill others in order to go to a party.

2024,"I guess it was from the factory in Puurs, Belgium?"
2025,I'm also from Belgium.
2026,I've visited the Duvel (translates to Devil) beer brewery a couple of years ago.
2027,That brewery is a neighbor of that Pfizer factory in Puurs.
2028,I saw then that the personalized number plates of 2 cars of the owners of Duvel had ...666...  on them.

2036,Any of the three places I‚Äôve lived during the pandemic have been good in Cali.
2037,"It‚Äôs pretty rare to see someone not wearing a mask even outdoors

But I know a lot of people indoors with friends who wouldn‚Äôt bother"
2038,"Why is it that this ""covid"" bill is only being discussed for checks, vaccine, school funding only?"
2039,Do people not know what else in is in it?
2040,"We are sending money to murders, other countries besides the US with US taxpayer money?"
2041,So many things in that bill that are not even covid related that they should have separated them into many different bills.
2042,"My wife had it back in April, no she didn't die or get hospitalized so I guess technically she had what they would define as a mild case."
2043,"But holy sh*t she was miserable, she was bed ridden for about 2+ weeks with literally barely enough strength to eat."
2044,Her recovery process took months before she was feeling 100%.
2045,"Don't get me wrong, if offered to me I'd take the J&amp;J shot in a heart beat."
2046,"But going through what she did is totally a concern for me after seeing it up close, so if given a choice I'd much prefer to be inoculated with something that has a higher degree of protection."

2051,Any pointers?
2052,Can I compress the arm and ice it as soon as I get home?
2053,Should I move it around.
2054,I fully expect for this vaccine to put out my arm.
2055,The stats back this claim.
2056,"But I am caring for my mother who broke a few bones, so I am playing nurse for the time being."
2057,And its constant movement.
2058,"No, they received $500m."
2059,"Later they did get a billion dollar order, but that's not much different from the $2b in orders the US made for Pfizer."
2060,"By the same token, other countries have ""ordered"" vaccine doses too."
2061,"If we're going to count warp speed progress, it can really only be counted by ""investment"" funding."
2062,"Now Moderna, they got massive massive help from OWS."
2063,"I'm sure the people in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia might disagree with your assessment of who is in greatest need."
2064,I'd argue that those EU members are in far greater need than Australia.
2065,Exporting local supply to countries outside of the EU that are in far better shape WRT case numbers is stupid no matter how you slice it.
2066,"&amp;#x200B;

Note: I'm not saying don't export to places like Brazil, who have MASSIVE case numbers."
2067,But the Australians have spent the past 12 months gloating here on reddit about how well they are managing covid via lockdowns etc.
2068,Seems to me they are fine to wait a few more months while Europe gets their hardest-hit states taken care of.
2069,I know you disagree.
2070,"It‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt accepted that it‚Äôs an opportunity cost (loss of income/consumption) figure, rather than a direct cost number (cost of covid healthcare treatment)."
2071,guess we just have to accept it then!
2072,wrap them in bubble paper or something.
2073,It‚Äôs his job to interpret the medical data and make executive decisions.

2077,"It's only okay to have that many people together to protest, not have fun."
2078,Haven't you learned this yet?
2079,?
2080,&gt; They set up these types of sites in rich communities and get them all vaccinated in short order and let poor folks fend for themselves.
2081,"Yes, because it's easy to reach a lot of at risk people in the rich communities."
2082,That's the point.
2083,"&gt; Shit, they even limited a site to only zip codes."
2084,You haul your ass over there and they nope you out because you don't have the right zip.
2085,"I mean, no shit?"
2086,"If they bring enough vaccine to vaccinate 1000 people in the zip, they don't need 10,000 from the surrounding area showing up."
2087,"&gt; If ""the state"" is ""dragging their shit"" to a clubhouse in a wealthy neighborhood, they better fricking ""drag their shit"" to some community center, school, park, whatever, in the poor neighborhood a few miles down the road."
2088,That's the point though.
2089,You can't just set up in some random public park and expect to have any idea how many people are going to show up.
2090,"The whole point of the clubhouse set up is that there is a small, tight knit community that is easy to assess/access."
2091,Sorry if that fact hurts your feelings.
2092,Well I did a year of all the precautions and had my second shot three weeks ago.
2093,And funny enough I haven't traveled or gone to any bars.
2094,I'm still enjoying my life though knowing that we're all getting closer to normalcy and my mental health is good without worrying about your what it's.
2095,Something very few people in this sub seem to understand
2096,Lmao
2097,They removed that a few weeks ago.
2098,"Didn't say that, but they've been less shady than many of their competitors."
2099,Probably too because some people catch covid from others when getting vaccinated especially with the 15 minute wait.
2100,Some pharmacies are still vaccinating in their enclosed windowless vaccine room and have 10+ people all waiting around near each other for their 15 minutes.
2101,I got my J&amp;J this morning and I want to echo this sentiment.
2102,Wasn't given a choice on the vaccine.
2103,Showed up and they gave me what they had.
2104,"I'm in med school, they knew that, my school knows that, and there were no special considerations."
2105,"All the vaccines are good enough for anyone, whether you wander around on COVID wards or you sit in your basement all day."
2106,"The US is Pfizer's biggest cash-cow by far:

2107,That article is bologna.
2108,One person died in some connection that has been proven and in no way cost the health system $12 billion.
2109,Data regarding delayed intervals is very encouraging.
2110,This shows that most people in these states are hopefully smarter than their reckless governors.
2111,Merck to the rescue.
2112,Sanctions shouldn't apply in humanitarian aid
2113,And it's highly concentrated in a few areas.
2114,"If you take a look at a density map of Alaska, there's a lot of open land that's relatively uninhabited."
2115,It would frankly be more embarrassing if they weren't at this point yet.
2116,&gt;Prevent suffering and save lives?
2117,Maybe.
2118,"If it's safe, how is this a maybe, could you elaborate?"
2119,There are half a million dead and many more who have suffered in this country alone.
2120,The vaccine causes some arm pain but that's about it for most people.
2121,I think it's a clear tradeoff.
2122,I mean I get a flu shot whenever offered and have a tone of other vaccines.
2123,"Strong vaccination programs means we don't worry about thinks like polio and smallpox today, in fact we don't even need those vaccines anymore in the US."
2124,&gt;You wish to boil things down to binary yes/no good/bad.
2125,Life is not binary and response to risk is not binary.
2126,"In this case it is very binary, if the vaccine is safe and prevents harm, what's the downside?"
2127,I'm not seeing any concrete downsides.
2128,Arm pain?
2129,The fact it'll take a few hours of your time?
2130,Tax/insurance dollars?
2131,What is it?
2132,"&gt;For example, you think the only discussion relevant here is the vaccine."
2133,"You do this because you think it gives you a superior argument, not because it's actually the only thing relevant."
2134,"No, I ignore the rest because I fully agree we shouldn't be locked down."
2135,Regardless of what you think of a vaccine and covid itself.
2136,"Without any government mandates people WILL be afraid of eating indoors and going to gyms and etc... A vaccine fixes this and makes people start going to these things, more doctor visits, less afraid of socialising."
2137,This has nothing to do with mandates and just how people are reacting.
2138,If you want life to go back to normal mass vaccination is the best route EVEN IF you think covid isn't a big deal.
2139,"The reason I don't want to talk about lockdown is because both of us agree, we shouldn't be locked down."
2140,And the easiest quickest way to renormalizing is mass vaccination.
2141,"Just like you have people who refuse to wear masks despite government mandates, you'd have people refusing to dine indoors even if the government said it's safe - until we all have the vaccine and covid is no longer prevalent."
2142,"&gt;If I had a safe and effective vaccine to deaths by milk jug drownings, do you think it would be relevant to discuss the number of deaths and vulnerability to milk jug drownings?"
2143,"Of course it would, it would be asinine to put everyone through a vaccine for something that might happen to only 2 people a year, no matter how safe and effective it is."
2144,"Covid has killed 500,000 people in this country and harmed tens millions including my uncle who's not part of the dead but will never have a productive happy again."
2145,Are you saying dead americans aren't a big deal to you?
2146,We're not talking 2 people a year we're talking a disease that's hitting millions.
2147,My brother got sick and he's in his 20's you know what happened?
2148,"He took 3 days off work, and stopped eating from restaurants for 2 weeks because he couldn't taste anything."
2149,"Had he been vaccinated, he would have not missed any work, spent money supporting restaurants for those two weeks and have ""only"" wasted 3ish hours of his time getting vaccinated."
2150,You're right it's not binary but you're completely focused on death.
2151,He's completely fine because he's young and healthy but being sick still kinda sucks.
2152,A vaccine prevents even that relatively minor inconvenience.
2153,Just because he's not part of your 0.03% does that mean we shouldn't vaccinate?
2154,"This is a disease that is affecting tens of millions of Americans whether major or minor, not milk jugs affecting 2 people or whatever."
2155,"&gt; If you are unwilling to discuss the role the covid response measures have had in comparison to the damage covid itself has done, then there is no discussion you be had."
2156,No matter how safe and effective the vaccine may be.
2157,"I am willing to discuss it and I just did, and we actually agree here on lockdowns."
2158,"My actual thoughts were:

We all needed to do a much better job of wearing masks, and have had no lockdowns."
2159,If we could have excellent mask compliance and no lockdowns less people would have died overall and our economy wouldn't have been hurt.
2160,Japan is a prime example of this.
2161,"Regardless of whether you're for or against lockdown, for or against masks, a vaccine is the best way to get things back to normal."
2162,"Even if you thought covid was a complete non issue, how will you convince people who currently think covid is going to kill them to go eat at restaurants again?"
2163,Vaccinate them.
2164,I'm willing to discuss since you did answer the questions finally.
2165,Now we can have a frank discussion now knowing you're not one of these people saying the vaccine is going to kill us all or microchip us or whatever crazy stuff comes out.
2166,"I get you have an ideological need to not get it, fine."
2167,But there are tons of people who will not go back to normal until covid numbers are no longer high.
2168,And vaccination combined with mask usage is the best way to reduce those numbers.
2169,"For the record, I've done plenty of outdoor dining, and even indoor dining since the pandemic started"
2170,I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden and I only cried for twenty minutes.
2171,It works like the military.
2172,"Lower levels can make regulations stricter, but not less strict."
2173,Same principle at work here.
2174,Where's the double ententendre?
2175,I don't quite get it
2176,"There is some initial evidence supporting this, as it is thought to trigger a stronger response, but studies are still ongoing."
2177,"John Hopkins in the US, and I know there's one in the UK too but can't remember if its NIH or a university."
2178,The benefits of being a state with under a million people lol.
2179,"Really, the question should be why most of the lower populated states haven't gotten to this point yet, especially if their populations are concentrated around a few main city centers."
2180,Good news.
2181,The level of bureaucracy needed to screen out in eligible people on a tiered system is pretty high.
2182,It‚Äôs appearing more and more that the supply is growing so much that these requirements should fall off.
2183,"People are bypassing them anyway, at least in California."
2184,"Right, AZ are angels."
2185,I thought it was only for Sinovac Vaccine.
2186,Is this  reaching peak effectiveness after second shot  thing same for all other vaccines?
2187,uno reverse card!
2188,take that abbott ;)
2189,Bickering between political factions will prevent the US from finding effective solutions to nuanced problems probably for the rest of our lives.
2190,[removed]
2191,That‚Äôs horrible that you would get higher premiums for getting the vaccine for a medical reason
2192,Not that I know of.
2193,I got mine through work and do have email evidence because I was trying to make sure my second dose wouldn‚Äôt be late but since I‚Äôm already fully vaccinated can‚Äôt imagine why I would ever need to produce those.
2194,Its not just the larger cities either I live in a smaller suburb of Austin and everyone here is pretty much doing the same thing with masking and distancing.
2195,My 77 year old mother had gotten both her vaccinations and went to get her hair cut today for the first time in five months.
2196,She said she was the only person in the place.
2197,People are generally keeping to the guidelines so far.
2198,I think summer will change things a bit though.
2199,All the big and small stores are still masking around here and I got an email from the local hospital which is the largest in the area outside Austin that everything will remain in place following guidelines.
2200,The email even went out of the way to nicely state its opposition to the governor's order.
2201,"Did you forget about this:

Nurses: we found a way to extract more doses!"
2202,Pfizer: Nice technique you have there.
2203,Would be a shame if something happened to your vial supply.
2204,Variants can pose a problem to the ultra desired herd immunity.
2205,Nipping this in the bud would have literally taken 3 weeks last March if this society wasn‚Äôt filled with egotistical morons.
2206,"Hmm, too soon"
2207,Would be interesting to get an actual number from the UK on the number of vaccines that they have exported.
2208,Pretty easily would prove who is right and wrong.
2209,"&gt;and probably will never be reached as children under 16 can't get it 

Can't get it yet."
2210,"With everything opening, you will see rates &gt;1 without herd immunity, but Covid just doesn't cause the health problems in the young that it does in the old, at least not in the short term."
2211,"I expect that, a year from now, Israel's children will also have been vaccinated and/or have natural immunity."
2212,Sounds dangerous.
2213,"We actually already know, the article is from March 5th, while Israel has further lifted restrictions on March 7th, see [here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-eases-3rd-lockdown-lifting-travel-limit-restrictions-on-some-businesses/)."
2214,"I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but this article is pretty clear:

* [https://bcmj.org/articles/what-evidence-extending-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-dosing-schedule](https://bcmj.org/articles/what-evidence-extending-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-dosing-schedule)"
2215,I wonder though if that‚Äôs due to age and different immune systems.
2216,A young healthy person‚Äôs body reacts differently
2217,"The EU who‚Äôve been nothing but fair, but threaten to breach the NI protocol to prevent vaccine entering the U.K. through Ireland."
2218,Italy having also banned exports to Australia.
2219,"It seems to me the EU, which has also propagated untruths lies about the AZ vaccine (see Macron‚Äôs comments about it being quasi-ineffective) against all evidence, and banning its use for over 65‚Äôs, before reversing the decision, have a massive chip on their shoulders with the U.K. and have handled this all appallingly."
2220,The problem your big brain is struggling with right now is you‚Äôre too prideful to admit when you‚Äôre out of your league and just plain incorrect.
2221,This is a novel virus where longitudinal studies are incomplete.
2222,To arrogantly say T cell immunity will last years is total speculation.
2223,Because they can get more doses from one bottle **but** in the US at least the caveat is when the pharma companies found out vials had more doses they just shipped less vials because the contract was for doses not vials.

2233,&gt;By May Greece will still be a COVID hotspot.
2234,"Tourists aren't going to flock to a locked down country and Greece will NOT have bars and restaurants open by May

From what I'm reading in the news, the COVID situation in Greece seems to be deteriorating pretty rapidly."
2235,"For a nation so heavily dependent on international tourism, it looks like grim times ahead, at least as far as this year's tourist high season goes."

&gt;The contract with Pfizer runs for five years and awards Croda an initial supply contract for four component excipients used in the production of the vaccine candidate for the first three years of the contract."
2237,Demand remains subject to relevant approvals.
2238,&gt; It will be produced at sites in the UK and US.
2239,&gt;we're actually in a better spot than Israel.
2240,"That's just not true, Israel has lifted far more restrictions than the US, for example we're back to in person schooling across the country and all age groups, and we're going to get in person universities soon."
2241,"US daily deaths is at 1580, while Israel is at 18.5 (7 day moving average)."
2242,"US population is 35 times that of Israel, while daily deaths are 85 times."
2243,The situation in the US is much much worse than in Israel.
2244,I'm interested to know how airport security will spot a valid vaccination certificate considering they'll be different in every country
2245,And airplanes
2246,Maybe inform yourself about the ways Coronaviruses work.
2247,The article has false info in it.
2248,"Israel has just around 55% people vaccinated with at least one dose, not 97%."
2249,97 per 100 was the number of doses.
2250,"With 55% people vaccinated they still have ‚Äúonly‚Äù 30% people with full immunity, so it will take them an extra month to get to 60% and two months to 90%."
2251,Hence lockdowns.
2252,"The article paints it as ‚Äúsee, even with 90% people with immunity you still need lockdowns‚Äù which is not true"
2253,&gt;Time to expose those who aren't in it for the kids.
2254,Time to expose *everyone* to new strains of a virus that shows no signs of slowing!
2255,Good job.
2256,You posted an article from 2017.
2257,"As it pertains to this sars-cov virus, there is no way of knowing T cell memory as it‚Äôs only been a year."
2258,;)
2259,"Like a baseball bat was my thought, lol."
2260,"Keep in mind it's an intramuscular injection, not an intravenous one."
2261,They give you the option of which arm to get jabbed in; I recommend your primary arm (right arm if you're right-handed).
2262,Because it's still dangerous to cluster large groups of people indoors for hours at a time?
2263,Because students can still catch the virus and bring it home with them?
2264,Because there are new strains like B117 that may be worse for kids and more lethal in general?
2265,"With all the mask and ventilator hijacking at start of COVID, yes supposed allies do engage in piracy against each other."
2266,I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have found Alex Bergerons twitter.
2267,That dude is straight up posting anti vax propaganda
2268,I'm in UK and its approved here.
2269,"I've had 2 Pfizer jabs, but my uncle (a kidney recipient, actually, my kidney) had 2 astrazeneca jabs and is fine."
2270,I'd be curious to see the actual supply vs doses currently administered state by state.
2271,"Are some states sitting on a giant amount of unused vaccine right now while they ""wait"" for people to show up to have the vaccine."
2272,I think there was a graphic awhile back that showed supply vs doses given in France and the number was very low.
2273,"Kind of wish they'd have just opened it up to everyone immediately as although the older someone gets the greater risk, there's probably a good chance they're getting it from a younger person that isn't being hit by the effects as hard, and as such are spreading it at a faster rate overall."
2274,"Plus, we'd be able to vaccinate larger numbers faster since there is some resistance overall to the vaccines in each age bracket and timing-wise."
2275,"Right, because the kids are all educators and vaccinated too?"
2276,"Wait, hmm, something doesn't seem smart about this...."
2277,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354216304016

2284,"I posted in yesterday's thread asking if anyone knew when CVS opened new appointment slots, turns out it's midnight on the dot."
2285,Posting this here to hopefully help someone else.
2286,"If in doubt, check with your doctor."
2287,But if it was a week ago and you feel fine thats great.
2288,Of course if you start to feel ill get in touch with a doctor or you A+E / ER immediately.
2289,80% is still far far away.
2290,(and probably will never be reached as children under 16 can't get it and Israel is a very young country.
2291,Luckily the average Japanese person is skinny
2292,"The article is 5 days old, it was BS then and it's even more BS since."
2293,There's absolutely no chance Israel goes into another lockdown.
2294,Live in Austin.
2295,"Can confirm, it‚Äôs pretty awesome."
2296,Keep Austin weird!
2297,And alive.
2298,Yeah I went online again Sat.
2299,night and found slots open at Meijer on Monday.
2300,Went in and got the Pizer shot and am scheduled back in 3 weeks for second shot.
2301,Came in told them my time 320 and they said get in line.
2302,First stop along way they check your sign up status.
2303,Line was about 100 but moved quick took about 15 minutes to get where they gave shots.
2304,They had 12 tables set up and all were giving about one every minute or so.
2305,"They check your ID, Ins, etc along the way at 12 different tables."
2306,Location Meijer Rockford Mi.
2307,They have just 30% people with full immunity afaik.
2308,It will take them a month to get to 50-60% if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
2309,"I can't believe people still think ""If we had locked down hard the first time we wouldn't be in this position now."""
2310,"We are never getting zero covid, and advocating for such policy is asking for rolling lockdowns *forever*"
2311,"Shit, we couldn't even go to the fuckin beach at one point."
2312,Lol who told you that?
2313,The ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù numbers generally tossed around don‚Äôt account for the fact the US usually earmarks the second dose when the first is allocated.
2314,That surplus is usually on hold and already accounted for.
2315,"I empathize for the situation Canada is in, but the US signaled very early on not to look to us for capacity until we were covered."
2316,This is an unfortunate side effect of not investing as heavily in vaccine production capacity over the years.
2317,I‚Äôm sorry but if people are going to be upset at the US for this then they should also be pointing fingers at the EU.
2318,"As far as our current output, we‚Äôll soon be running at a true surplus."
2319,At that point I do hope we start exporting to allies and partners.
2320,Everyone in Israel can get a shot since about 5 weeks ago.
2321,"We did prioritize getting 2cond shot to elderly, and I believe that was the right decision."
2322,"Take note that there is not a chance in hell for 4th lockdown as deaths, severe cases and cases are still going down."
2323,"As for metrics based on cases, a couple of things:

1."
2324,Depends on how much and who you test.
2325,2.
2326,"Kids, Israel has a shit ton of kids."
2327,"50% of all new cases are found in the 0-19 demographic, weighted to the unvaccinated 0-15 demographics."
2328,"As Israel has reopened in person schools for most kids several weeks ago and for the rest this week, the cases are not a surprise."
2329,"This is nothing really, deaths are now under 20 a day weekly average, and are still declining."
2330,Maybe people who are smart (and can contribute more to the economy) naturally migrate towards the city's and actually vote for parties that are good for them and society.
2331,You're absolutely correct.
2332,"I didn't mean to imply that Pfizer is a bad vaccine (I've had two shots of Pfizer with no side effects, although I've not had tests to see if I have antibodies)."
2333,I was only trying to say that a vaccine may not be appropriate for you if you have a certain condition or take certain drugs.

2351,I mean it‚Äôs truly amazing.
2352,"Y‚Äôall are usually like a bunch of little recording devices, broadcasting the talking points, verbatim."
2353,"Yes, it‚Äôs creepy as fuck, but it‚Äôs also a massive accomplishment by the people that feed you lies."
2354,"But when it comes to the death rate, y‚Äôall all say a slightly different number."
2355,Why is that?
2356,Is it because numbers are hard?
2357,and that isn't even bringing up their person to person social skills into the equation
2358,"My uncle, a kidney recipient, was told he must avoid Pfizer and should take astrazeneca because covid gives adverse reactions."
2359,He had the astrazeneca and was fine.
2360,"A friend of my moms, also a kidney recipient, wasn't told this (but should have been; he's considering legal action), was given the Pfizer vaccine and ended up very ill and admitted to itu."

2362,Draw your own conclusions.
2363,"Article from March 5, it's 

1."
2364,"Outdated
2."
2365,Even then there was no chance of a 4th lockdown.
2366,It's BS.
2367,"If vaccines work as well as they say they do, why would another lockdown be necessary with 80%+ of the population vaccinated?"
2368,Is social distancing and restrictions forever the plan here?
2369,"I mean, you can point that out, and it's a great point."
2370,But I guess I've heard there were a few issues in the south in the last year that may have some relevance.
2371,"Something something, Breonna, something, something, Ahmaud Arbery."
2372,"My point is that yes, the north has some racism."
2373,"But this is quite the whataboutism, when the south is still much worse in this regard."
2374,"Immunity doesn‚Äôt last, but right now we have people that have zero immunity, so it‚Äôs a decent thing to wait with vaccination until those are vaccinated."
2375,+1.
2376,In Poland we have officials guidelines now - if someone was infected they will wait at least 6 months and offer just one dose.
2377,Greece was nearly COVID free for a while.
2378,Up until around October Greece was absolutely storming ahead.
2379,Then it all went wrong.
2380,You've got to remember that Greece is far from being a first world country.

2395,?
2396,All of them I know.

2403,He removed the state mandate and let cities and localities impose their own.
2404,Isn't that how it was supposed to work?
2405,Why is this a story?
2406,You think you made a point but you didn‚Äôt.
2407,The police chief is outside his lane.
2408,The Spanish language?
2409,"Unless I've been mispronouncing it this whole time... 

Now I feel I must check this out immediately."
2410,"in a roundabout way, yes."
2411,"Of course, smoking usually takes most of a lifetime to kill a person, COVID takes a few weeks - so there's clearly a difference here?"
2412,"So apparently, there‚Äôs a problem with using insulin syringes like this."
2413,"The Pfizer vaccine must be injected into muscle, which is beneath the layer of subcutaneous fat."
2414,"On the other hand, insulin syringes (at least those in Japan) have needles that are shorter than that of normal syringes."
2415,So this method can be used only for people that don‚Äôt have a very thick layer of subcutaneous fat.
2416,"This isn‚Äôt in the posted article, but I heard it on NHK news."
2417,That's a very valid question.
2418,Don't know
2419,Do they just throw out the extra vaccine at the end of the day if they don‚Äôt have an eligible arm to stick nearby?

2433,Austin is a cool place
2434,Aren't they vaccinating only people above 60 years?
2435,And maybe people over 40 years with co-morbidities?
2436,"When this fucking stunt started, some genius in the UK predicted two million dead."
2437,"Then his holiness said the virus wasn't dangerous (February 29th, 2020.)"
2438,Then he said we didn't need to wear masks on national television.
2439,Now we need to wear two masks to protect against a disease that 99.5% of people survive.
2440,The average age of a person who dies from coronavirus is well into their 70s.
2441,"For some reason, the United States, despite having a tiny fraction of the world's population and one of the most advanced health care systems in human history, is responsible for one out of every four coronavirus deaths worldwide."
2442,That number is statistically impossible.
2443,"The United States is so advanced that tuberculosis, which is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, is so rare here that in all the hysteria over the last year and a half, nobody has mentioned it even once."
2444,This despite the fact it is spread identically to coronavirus.
2445,Was anyone wearing masks to prevent tuberculosis in 2018?
2446,Of course not.
2447,Why?
2448,Because it's not dangerous.
2449,And neither is coronavirus.
2450,"But it really wasn't until China announced they expected Americans to stick something up their own ass to test for the disease and that people could get ""re-infected"" after being vaccinated that the whole thing went off the rails."
2451,Assholes are always too clever by half.
2452,The CDC thing was just the most recent and most obvious confirmation.
2453,The anti-mask people were right all along.
2454,The reason is because they have common sense and they can think critically for themselves.
2455,They are grown men and women who can make their own decisions without someone shoving a tit in their mouth.
2456,Oh yeah like all of those American posts that say 'in USA'
2457,T-cell immunity will last for decades
2458,"Tobacco kills [480,000 people per year in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm)."
2459,Is the federal or state government responsible for  those deaths because they don't ban tobacco?
2460,Are they murderers because they didn't enact laws that prevented those deaths?
2461,Why don't you call them murderers for not forcing their will upon their citizens vis-a-vis tobacco?
2462,"This isn't even my point tho, my point is that if you're Joe mfing Rogan The Woodlands, Lake Way, and Highland Park are all fucking great places to live."
2463,"Living in Austin is just the hip cool place to live so that's why he lives there and to act like it's some incredible hub of culture is dumb, you can find a lot of that in other cities, too."
2464,[removed]
2465,"Cities can and at one time did feed themselves,  but with our current industrialized agricultural system that doesn't happen."
2466,"Cuba, for instance grows much of their food on reclaimed parking lots in the cities."
2467,Not everyone has a smartphone.
2468,Any form of ‚ÄúCOVID ID‚Äù would have to be a physical thing people could carry with them.
2469,I read this as 7-foot insulin syringes and that raised more questions than it answered.
2470,Suppose I should keep information quality high though.
2471,Mean while in Fort Worth....
2472,Weird.
2473,I and 4 other people had only very mild effects.
2474,Maybe some headaches and that was it.
2475,"How about the millions of kids that are missing out on childhood experiences, getting poor education, and are increasingly developing mental health problems and social anxiety?"
2476,There have been many many low income kids who have not gotten a proper education or a real interaction with a friend in a year.
2477,Can you see Russia from your backyard?
2478,"If you‚Äôre vaccinated by that point I would go, no real reason not to unless you live with someone at risk who won‚Äôt be vaccinated by that point or something."
2479,Well we did learn a lot about mRNA vaccines
2480,This isn‚Äôt true...Tarrant County (borders Dallas and has Forth Worth) also turned blue
2481,I‚Äôm going to have a drink and celebrate the fact that my mom gets her first covid shot that day!
2482,"While depressing this has dragged on a year, I honestly didn‚Äôt think she would make it to her vaccine due to her state not having a mask mandate, her health issues, and her doing in person teaching this whole time (many teachers working with her also tested positive)."
2483,Very happy that this is nearly over for her!
2484,[deleted]
2485,Sounds good!
2486,I'm trying to see how people who have had the vaccine reacted to it?
2487,"Ah hell, Pennsylvania is a whole other underground fire."
2488,The racism there rivals Mississippi.
2489,We have a lot of natural immunity because lots of us in the US caught the ‚Äòrona like they were playing Pokemon Go.
2490,I do not think that shit goes away and I'm not gonna deny the problems that existed in the past and exist now.
2491,Racism is really hard to quantify for obvious reasons but if you look at hate crimes in 2019 by state the south has only one state in the top 10 (that state being Texas the second most populous state at number 4).
2492,"States seen in the top 10 include Massachussets, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, Washington, and New York."
2493,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/737930/number-of-hate-crimes-in-the-us-by-motivation/

While I doubt that one stat really tells the whole story I think it's a good start to showing people that their preconceptions may be wrong."
2494,They have no power to issue fines are anything.
2495,They're just hoping people will listening but doubt most will after a year of this...
2496,I‚Äôm Alaskan got my first dose today
2497,Sure but that's an 8 hour drive one way from the city I live in lmao
2498,"This isn't ""despite""."
2499,It's in compliance to the mandate.
2500,I enjoyed the ayaan podcast she was great.
2501,I heard displeasure with lockdowns but don‚Äôt recall anti mask rhetoric.
2502,Bill Burr one was a long time ago.
2503,Don‚Äôt recall.
2504,Their families believe they did and tracing suggests it.
2505,I‚Äôm from Michigan.
2506,The guy is right.
2507,It‚Äôs like the old political joke:   What‚Äôs between Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania?
2508,Alabama
2509,Love you Polis (if you read this)!!
2510,!
2511,"The comparison does make sense because it demonstrates that there is at least one group of people that have a legitimate fear of being taken advantage of by the government giving away free stuff, as opposed to just saying ""well if they don't want it they don't have to take it""."
2512,It shows that they are capable of seeing that people have complex and deeply seated reasons for why they behave the way they do.
2513,"Name one, besides you."
2514,"Austin not dumb, unlike rest of Texas."
2515,Anyone with even a semblance of insight into statistics
2516,Do you know they picked up the virus at school?
2517,Anyone with a shred of empathy and intelligence is thankful for masks.
2518,"I consider myself very fortunate that I was in high school and college before the invention of A., social media, and B., the camera phone, so I couldn‚Äôt unwittingly document everything that I did"
2519,"Thanks, friend."
2520,Not sure why YOU are getting downvoted either.
2521,People suck.
2522,have you not seen the Bill Burr episode or the recent Ayaan Hirsi Ali one?
2523,And there is not ‚Äúzero evidence‚Äù there is indeed early evidence that it does reduce transmission
2524,Seriously.
2525,My district is overwhelmed with teachers who offered to go back.
2526,How about the Sinovac vaccine?
2527,Texas is gonna be the first state to secede from itself isn't it?
2528,Says who?
2529,You?
2530,Texas politicians are a disgrace.
2531,We‚Äôll start with the CDC and WHO.
2532,The people who are qualified and certified.
2533,What‚Äôs wrong with the vaccine?
2534,This is literally the purpose of lifting the mask mandates.
2535,Allowing smaller cities and individuals to take responsibility for their own health instead of a large government doing it for them.
2536,Because Republicans have always been willing to sacrifice people for politics.
2537,"Abbott is a disgrace, that‚Äôs why."
2538,"Elected Republicans are a disgrace, that‚Äôs why."
2539,They are.
2540,They were back in school before we got vaccinated.
2541,No concerts?
2542,Have you gone into a grocery store during a covid surge?
2543,How about eating outside at a restaurant?
2544,Seen any family over the past year?
2545,"By all means, send the link and prove me wrong!"
2546,Or something like that lmao
2547,Then the comparison means nothing
2548,There are a lot of teachers.
2549,Millions.
2550,Don‚Äôt you understand that it‚Äôs POSSIBLE that teachers who are uncomfortable going back and ones who are on planes might not be the same people?
2551,My district is trying to open right now.
2552,Only 16% of parents decided to go back to a hybrid model.
2553,The rest want to stay virtual the rest of the year.
2554,We have FAR more teachers who want to go back to in person than we need.
2555,"It is not productive not logical to lump all teachers into one big group and just say that since you saw some teachers posting pictures on planes, then obviously they must all be doing it."
2556,Then how is this news?
2557,Which experts?
2558,Small government is good unless they don't agree
2559,It's almost like teachers can vary in how seriously they treat the virus just like the rest of people.
2560,"Oh, man."
2561,Every person who receives an unlawful citation will have one hell of a solid lawsuit against the city.
2562,"All of this stupid crap because some giant turd vaguely shaped like a human said once ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to wear one‚Äô, and all his dumbass cultists that worship him because they have no self-worth have no choice but to blindly do what he says."
2563,San Antonio and Bexar county passed a carefully worded ordinance which requires local businesses to post their legal right to require a face mask in their private property.
2564,"Everybody at my H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB was masked up, !"
2565,Wife and I were thinking of doing a cruise this fall .
2566,We had it ready to go March 16th last year but it got canceled.
2567,We are thinking of going in October for my birthday.
2568,Neither my wife and I have gotten any vaccines.
2569,Neither of us have a positive covid test.
2570,We are not against vaccines but we aren‚Äôt in the 1A / 1B groups and in our early 30s so we are waiting for our place in line .
2571,Hopefully by this time next month or early June we can get vaccines.
2572,Anyway do you think this fall would be good time to do a cruise ?
2573,Or is it too soon
2574,I know about the study and I get why black people don't trust government but the vaccine is not being given exclusively to them .
2575,The same vaccine is being given worldwide.
2576,So the comparison doesn't make sense here.
2577,&gt;Another limitation was the use of Google Community Mobility Reports as a surrogate marker for staying at home.
2578,"This may underestimate the real value: for instance, if a user¬¥s cell phone is switched off while at home, the observation will be absent from the database."
2579,Or if they're old and don't have a smart phone.
2580,"Or if they don't have an *android* phone, or do they suggest Google are able to GPS track IPhones, too?"
2581,"&gt;In conclusion, using this methodology and current data, in‚Äâ~‚Äâ98% of the comparisons using 87 different regions of the world we found no evidence that the number of deaths/million is reduced by staying at home."
2582,"Its after 3am so maybe I just missed it, but I didn't see any mention of how strict the ""staying at home"" was meant to be."
2583,But if they're suggesting that if everyone not leaving home for the 25 week period they were looking at would have no effect on mortality then I'm bewildered.
2584,How can you catch covid from someone else if you don't leave your home?
2585,Is the 2 mins receiving your grocery delivery equal to going into work or walking around a supermarket in terms of infection chance?
2586,It reinforced my idea about how much people embraced various forms of theater to feel safe.
2587,Stuff like this doesn't just ramp up overnight.
2588,It takes time.
2589,"Vaccines still have to be produced, shipped, delivered, administered, etc."
2590,It's all incremental.
2591,"As long as next week's numbers are looking better than last week's numbers, we're doing good."
2592,The best way to look at is by comparing month's end numbers compared to the previous month.
2593,"By that metric, we're fine."
2594,"Missouri has never had a statewide mandate, it's been handled on a local level since the start."
2595,We currently have one of the lowest infection rates in the country.
2596,"If they had tried to force rural areas to shutdown because of infection rates in KC or St Louis, it wouldn't have gone well."
2597,Hard news comes better from locals than some governor in a fancy house somewhere
2598,How the fuck does the computer grade my student‚Äôs writing?
2599,...what?
2600,"This has upvotes O.O

Am I having a stroke?"
2601,"Thanks, I'll give it a shot!"
2602,"He's rich, they live by different rules."
2603,Haven't you been paying attention?
2604,Depending on what you believe
2605,All Texas cities vote blue but Austin votes _super_ blue by at least 10% more than all the other cities.
2606,"Austin had at least one surrounding county turn blue during the last election, I don't think any other Texas cities can claim the same."
2607,"Not op but the reason they bring up blacks is because they don't trust our nation's doctors and medical professionals because they've been on the receiving end of some pretty fucked up ""treatment"" from doctors, like the tuskegee syphilis study, where black men were promised free healthcare as part of a study and were actually given placebos and were never told that they had syphilis."
2608,lol same argument can be made for any group identity.
2609,"yes, they are individuals but ‚Äúthe medias‚Äù goals are much more closely aligned then say, those don‚Äôt control 90% of the market share."
2610,it‚Äôs like saying calling someone rich is lazy because he or she is still his or her own person lol.
2611,"Everything bad is over exaggerated and everything good is usually under exaggerated by the media when it comes to covid, it seems."
2612,"As for variants, the data seems to suggest that current vaccines are pretty  solid against them, and the producers of them are reporting they can fine tune vaccines quickly to give boosters if needed."
2613,"So I'm sure variants will slow us down some, it's not a doom scenario the media seems to want it to be."
2614,"No one claimed that, son"
2615,you tried so hard
2616,Next the polar bears
2617,Didn't Greg Abbots executive order block local governments from enforcing mask mandates and/or emposing any fines for not wearing a mask?
2618,"I think the statewide mask mandate shouldn't have been lifted, so good for Austin for keeping there mask requirement."
2619,"However if they can't enforce it, will having the mandate mean anything?"
2620,"So is Houston, America's fourth largest city."
2621,"Bars sucked, you had to sit at tables"
2622,‚ÄúLook at you all tough with your exposed throat‚Äù or something like that.

2670,So you would help administer a vaccine in which you do not want nor believe in?
2671,Am I understanding that right?
2672,Get off your high horse.
2673,I enjoyed reading this.
2674,It's a place with a lot of liberal leaning people that won't likely freak out when asked to out on a mask.
2675,It's also a place where you see people also walk around homeless people laying infront of doors.
2676,"The only time I've seen someone tell at someone else in Austin is when I had a lady yell at me while walking to a ramen place because she was ""not homeless"" and that she just ""needed money""."
2677,"Which was an odd response to ""sorry I can't help you""."
2678,Those food trucks are good though.
2679,Also the onion is one of the few places I have had decent pizza that wasn't on the east coast.
2680,"Haven't been there since 2019, hope I get to go there again soon as I have some good friends there."
2681,8/10 would recommend over anywhere in Cali any day.
2682,"I might not be exactly getting it either but I think what they're saying is:

&amp;#x200B;

If you had 100 chances of getting covid, and 90 of them you won't get it because of masks, social distancing, your own level of immunity already, other factors, then the J&amp;J vaccine gives you the 96-97 chance of not getting it and the Pfizer gets to 99."
2683,"&amp;#x200B;

I might be misunderstanding still, it's very confusing."
2684,"Well, let's all work on our particular corners."
2685,&gt; but I genuinely believe that the freedom to express oneself and change rapidly without communal judgement is a major driving force in the liberal nature of large urban environments.
2686,"I completely agree with this, but also noticed that you described university culture as well here, and due to the high rents of urban areas, you typically need a higher paying job to live in cities like Austin."
2687,"Austin is full of the ""socially progressive but economically conservative"" types, though, which is why I was critical of it being meaningfully less conservative than the rural areas."
2688,"It passes the very low bar of recommending masks during a pandemic, which isn't saying much..."
2689,[removed]
2690,My point in posting that is OP suggests teachers are lazy and wanting to stay home and go on vacation.
2691,That is absolutely not true for the teachers I know.
2692,Many - but not all - are terrified of getting covid and getting a family member sick.
2693,"Every day they have posts from parents along the lines of ‚Äúshut up and teach‚Äù and ‚Äúget in the classroom or find a new job.‚Äù In the spring, parents were ‚Äúteachers are heroes, give them raises!"
2694,"In August, it was, ‚Äúget in the classroom with no PPE or guidelines prepared.‚Äù"
2695,Yes which is not even close to #2

2698,He is strongly against lockdowns and for good reason though.
2699,"All the major cities in Texas lean Blue, some very strongly so- i.e."

2703,"The test figures are the number processed in the relevant 24 hour period, of which a certain number of tests return positive."

2705,Never asked for any vaccine status.
2706,Either way why would anyone be keen to take away your freedoms to travel?
2707,"Well la di da, aint that swell."
2708,But what about the rest of the world?
2709,People who think that hospitalization surge would happen - I just don't understand... who would we be hospitalizing?

2727,"You are totally right, of course, that works on the American public."
2728,You just wonder what the public is even interested in at that point.
2729,"&gt; Yes certain people need it, but why does someone who makes $90k get $1,200 and I get zero?"
2730,First the cutoff is $80k at a reduced amount.
2731,"Second, making $80k in a city like NYC or San Francisco is not as much money as you think."
2732,"Finally, if you aren't getting it then its because you either make too much money or are an adult dependent (thus, don't pay any bills)."
2733,If neither applies to you then you need to stop complaining and figure out how to get the check.
2734,"From Jerusalem Post article data :

0.013 % hospitalized

0.0080 % serious case of disease

0.0029 % dead (qty 99)"

2740,Nah this one seems different.
2741,I think that‚Äôs saying cities can still have their own mask mandate but they can‚Äôt close business or limit gatherings
2742,"Sorry, is this your legal opinion or are you just spitballing?"
2743,I am also a layman and my understanding of words says if you restrict something it's a restriction.
2744,My reading says a private business can restrict whatever they want based on the concept of trespassing.
2745,Restrictions involving a municipal building would directly contradict the Governor's order unless the area meets the hospitalization clause.
2746,"No, you're totally wrong."
2747,"Today, we report the number of positive cases since the same time yesterday."
2748,But we don't know how many tests have been carried out.
2749,"Tomorrow, we report the number of tests carried out until the same time today."
2750,"That means you match the number of reported cases yesterday (4,712) with the number of tests reported today because there's a one day lag (1.53m)."

2802,It doesn't help his case that Florida is a microcosm of what it looks like in the US as B 1.1.7. becomes the more dominant variant.
2803,And it looks a lot like the rest of the country in that cases and hospitalizations are declining.

2867,"A negligible number of cases were traced back to things like dining, entertainment, sports, etc."

2878,It was a creeping worry of mine starting sometime in January (I think) and getting much worse throughout February.
2879,I was very worried as we were going into March.

2893,I had my last ever day of in-person college classes the next day.
2894,Most of the day was spent talking about the coronavirus and our fears.
2895,I asked for a girl's number who I sort of liked and was planning to get to know more during the rest of semester.

2898,"Most people thought we would be back within a few weeks, but shit just seemed to be bad to me."
2899,What I didn't realize is that the pandemic would last well into 2021.
2900,I still thought it would at least end in the summer or fall.
2901,Now I'm graduating in a couple months and I'm still doing online classes (my own choice to be extra careful).

3035,"I'm still unwilling to receive J+J, because I frequently travel internationally and need the best protection I can get against contracting COVID-19 while abroad in an environment where local health infrastructure may not be well developed;  it's a perfectly fine choice for people who are at lower risk, but for folks who want the best protection, the mRNA vaccines are clearly better."
3036,"I'm glad AstraZeneca isn't approved in my country; while I'm open to considering it once higher quality data is available, the existing evidence shows it has a much lower efficacy than other vaccine options, and there are major questions around the study design and execution that show sloppy attention to detail from the team that developed the vaccine."

3049,I feel sorry for the people of Austin.
3050,"I posted somewhere above, but I think it will be someone like DeSantis that can say he did a better job than basically every democratic led state at minimizing COVID deaths while keeping things open."
3051,That will win a lot of suburbs back.

3062,I embody your second paragraph.

3064,We get delivery and work from home.
3065,We can wait.
3066,"When people say ""everyone has been offered a vaccine"", it typically means on this subreddit that that means adults."
3067,"People have always been disease vectors though, we just didn't stress over it before COVID."

3070,Masks and distancing work though so what's the problem?
3071,The P M was quick to understand that the greek healthcare system would not be able to withstand a virus like this.
3072,He put us under curfew quickly during the first wave.
3073,Then the summer came.
3074,"Everything was open, everyone was welcome."
3075,"They used an untested algorithm called EVA created by a greek ""entrepreneur"" who resides in the US without even a backing paper, which in essence randomly selected tourists to be tested."
3076,"After the tourists left, we had a big second wave with 100 deaths/day."
3077,"When the second wave subsided, they eased the restrictions considerably."
3078,"All this time, the hospitals gained too little in terms of new infrastructure, doctors, nurses etc."
3079,Covid-19 was still here but more and more people became complacent and some didn't even care.
3080,Then we had an uptick in new cases.
3081,The new variants from abroad became known and we had a few cases of them too.
3082,The new variants started to spread like wildfire in the previous month.
3083,"Hospitals are full, doctors are scarce, hospital beds are a commodity, regular patients suffer, covid-19 patients suffer."
3084,It's not looking good.
3085,"To make matters worse, cases of p o l i c e   b r u t a l i t y sparked unrest and we have daily demonstrations by thousands of people."
3086,It is really not looking good.
3087,Exactly it seems the vaccines are working as intended.
3088,I‚Äôd also be interested if the staff that brought it in was vaccinated (I doubt it).
3089,I see nothing but positive from this story
3090,Noticed my arm kind of hurt when I lifted it above my head (hurt no more than a long gym day).
3091,"Next day it was a constant soreness at the same level, but by the time I went to bed it was barely noticeable and completely gone the next day!"
3092,In terms of qualifications - the question that was asked - they are probably both equally qualified.
3093,I.e.
3094,"neither are medical professionals, therefore both are offering unqualified personal assessments based on information received."
3095,They are likely both equally qualified.
3096,I work at a pharmacy giving vaccinations.
3097,I wouldn‚Äôt bother looking out further than 3 days.
3098,"That‚Äôs as far in advance we are scheduling, as we never know how many doses we are getting from the state department of health."
3099,"Kicks your ass because flu isn't a joke, get your flu shots every year."

3105,That and whether you still have to worry about long-term effects if you do get it.
3106,"Not dying is great, but living with a chronic illness doesn't sound like much fun either."
3107,[removed]
3108,Did they even give any cards to the people that were lucky to be given the unused doses at the end of the day?
3109,"You know the stories of clinics having leftover doses and instead of tossing them, basically opened the door and said ‚Äúanyone need a vaccine?‚Äù"
3110,Came here to say this.
3111,If I had the chance?
3112,"I‚Äôd go back and ask for the J&amp;J knowing it has more recent data re: variants and such 

&amp; I say that as somebody who prayed for sweet death with the Pfizer side effects bahahaha"
3113,"Sorry to harp on this, but why don't other manifestations of COVID matter?"
3114,Speaking as a physician with some experience with chronic diseases
3115,"The good news is that even if you get infected, you will be less likely to transmit the virus."
3116,Recent studies suggest the viral load/level of viral shedding in infected vaccinated people might be four times lower than unvaccinated infected people.
3117,üôÑ
3118,"sure but it's not just your problem to get rid of the virus and if we can not get rid of it fast enough, together, everywhere the virus is going to mutate over and over again and it will never stop."
3119,why not giving away just a little part to poor countries?
3120,it's not like you have only the doses you have right now.
3121,"you keep producing themü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
somehow it's senseless to try to let you understand"
3122,It‚Äôs funny I see people who don‚Äôt have a mask on as disease vectors.
3123,The mask reminds me I‚Äôm safer.
3124,pretty sure thats the point.
3125,basically creates an on-campus bubble versus flying back to your home town and traveling
3126,"yeah, what a sucky experience."
3127,saw somewhere else that rite aid drops new appts.
3128,at 11:45pm???
3129,"It seems like a game of mostly luck, which it should not be."
3130,"Yeah I‚Äôd also want to know when was their last second shot and if those two staff had the vaccine, as I bet the one that brought it into the home did not."
3131,Also how many of the 10 had the vaccine.
3132,After that it would be interesting to know what the cases were like in those that were vaccinated.
3133,"Honestly with the way this thing spreads through LTC facilities 10 cases out of 220 is fairly good, and I‚Äôd assume some of those 10 were not vaccinated completely yet."
3134,Also remember these are the most frail in society and LTC facilities are notorious hot spots for respiratory illnesses as it is.
3135,Outbreaks of other coronaviruses and flu are common every year.
3136,If there aren‚Äôt any serious cases in the ones that have been vaccinated along with limiting the outbreak that‚Äôs a giant win for the vaccine
3137,That would require him raising money for the project and then spending it as intended.
3138,"I predict the first bit will happen, as for the money being spent on something other than Trump's legal fees or whims... only if he figures out a way to turn the library itself in to revenue stream."
3139,Awesome!
3140,Good to hear!

3162,"My father, for example, is someone who I‚Äôve always considered an intelligent man."
3163,"Over the last 4-6 years however, the discourse surrounding politics and general disbelief in science and such has swayed even intelligent people."

3167,Healthy skepticism is good but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here.
3168,Please don‚Äôt call your local pharmacy.
3169,Please use the scheduling tools online or via vaccine hotline.
3170,I work at one that just started giving them to the public.
3171,We are severely understaffed and unfortunately do not have time for hundreds of extra calls per day just to tell them we can‚Äôt help make appointment.
3172,We have been doing long term care and nursing home since vaccinations started.
3173,We cannot make appointments over the phone.
3174,There are no extra doses.
3175,There is no waitlist.
3176,"If for some reason a dose is about to expire that was allocated to someone who missed/canceled their appointment, it goes to the staff giving the vaccines."
3177,"I am so glad so many people want to get vaccinated, but we are only given so many doses."
3178,I‚Äôd love to be able to accommodate everyone that wanted to get one.
3179,"Not only is there a shortage on doses, we have been warned by corporate that there are shortages on the syringes now as well."
3180,There‚Äôs no evidence of this.
3181,"People want to think this is the flu because it makes it easier to understand, but it‚Äôs not the flu."
3182,It‚Äôs a whole other thing.
3183,And the vaccines are more effective against covid than flu shots are against flu.
3184,"And we already have corona viruses that cause colds each year, which are not particularly deadly compared to flu or covid 19."
3185,"We don't really know that yet, it's just observational data."
3186,"Kids aren't dying as much or reporting as many long covid symptoms, but it's too early to be so blase and dismissive about potential long term impacts of catching this in childhood

This virus infects all sorts of organs including the brain, who knows what that will lead to."
3187,The Dakotas didn‚Äôt have any significant Covid restrictions and still saw their curves decline as the holidays were happening.
3188,Just viral seasonality at work.
3189,The fuck are you on about with the conspiracy shit.
3190,I think it was chosen to speed up the trials just like with Oxford at the beginning.
3191,That‚Äôs how I read it as well.
3192,"Edit: And given how it was worded, I doubt the state sues them."
3193,Seems pretty intentional.
3194,And it makes sense.
3195,Places like Abilene have less need of a mask mandate than Austin or Houston.
3196,Good to hear.
3197,Had my second dose today of Pfizer.
3198,"Arm is immensely sore but otherwise ok, and haven't died of covid19 so its going well overall."
3199,Thanks.
3200,I've camped my computer for over an hour every morning checking for anything for the last week and a half and no luck.
3201,"I honestly don't think they'll risk running Trump again, though whether he tries something insane or not remains to be seen."
3202,"&gt; get treatments covered

Are there any effective treatments already?"
3203,"Lol the reason you haven‚Äôt gotten the flu is because people around you have gotten vaccinated, not because you‚Äôre lucky or immune."
3204,Do your part.
3205,"What else is in this bill, what did they hide this time?"
3206,These are all nurses I‚Äôm talking about
3207,I was wondering when you'd lose your cool and resort to name calling.
3208,It seems like a common theme in your comments.
3209,"You do make a good point that there are some people can continue to stay at home, but I'm not going to bother responding to that since you've decided to be impatient and disrespectful."
3210,Agreed I'm perfectly at peace waiting my turn.
3211,Those in front of me need it much more than I do.
3212,You should contact your state about that.
3213,Are you on the state and country portals?
3214,Or perhaps it just isn‚Äôt time for yours yet.
3215,Valid and I totally appreciate that.
3216,I never told you your opinion was wrong.
3217,I certainly gave you space for yours.
3218,I'd say that what I'm doing is akin to doing something about it.
3219,I'm talking about it in a public forum.
3220,You're doing the exact same thing.
3221,Appreciate the thoughts- this is probably going nowhere so feel free to take the last word on this.
3222,"We may have to agree to disagree, but fundamentally I'm sure we aren't that far apart and we are both glad it might be ending soon."
3223,Take care
3224,&gt;and right now in its 7-day average.
3225,"You didn‚Äôt say cases, you said deaths."
3226,The US is higher.
3227,"Israel does more testing, so finds more cases."
3228,Both countries have about the same confirmed cases per million over the entire pandemic despite Israel having 40% the number of deaths.
3229,Also as more people are vaccinated cases aren‚Äôt as much of a predictor of deaths.
3230,Younger people in Israel are congregating more now that those at risk are largely protected.
3231,"[In Shift, Vast Majority of New COVID Cases in Israel Below Age 39](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/75-percent-of-new-covid-patients-in-israel-below-age-39-report-shows-1.9537307)"
3232,"I totally agree that it is not fair that it's like The Hunger Games to get a vaccine, and people shouldn't have to be traveling far and wide to get a vaccine."
3233,"I think the thing with [vaxxmax.com](https://vaxxmax.com) is of course that it isn't always updated until a few minutes after somebody has gotten the appointment listed, but also that there are lots of people refreshing it waiting to jump on any appointment that shows up."
3234,I still think it's truly worth a shot.
3235,"It took many tries, but you should be able to get appointments with it I think."
3236,I think registering at mid-michigan county health departments is also worth a shot since they seem to have more.
3237,&gt;Im not saying the second dose isn't needed.
3238,But is it needed within 21 days.
3239,We can agree that was probably done to speed up the phase 3 trials.
3240,You appear to be repeating a conspiracy theory about the manufacturer's intent to provide maximum protection for everyone.
3241,Was it clear enough that there were years of evidence as to the selection of 21?
3242,21 is a very odd number in the world of vaccines for a second dose.
3243,Going beyond 21 days is significantly dangerous if there is no serological confirmation of post-immunity.
3244,We just going to pretend Florida is reporting accurately?
3245,Are you wanting to have a discussion?
3246,"If so, your last sentence makes me question if I should even begin with you."
3247,You should look at it that at least it's not the virus itself.
3248,"&gt; Only real issue are some very muscular guys but they are fairly easily accounted for as not being ""fat""."
3249,There is also an issue with very tall people who can be overweight/obese by BMI but actually at a healthy weight.
3250,But just like very muscular people there just isn't enough of them to change much on a population level.
3251,"Yeah, it‚Äôs a shitty situation."
3252,I don‚Äôt blame her though - a lot of people are very afraid of any Covid risks so it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that some of her clients wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable knowing she has maskless sessions with others.
3253,‚ÄúHelp researchers‚Äù - excellent point.
3254,"I mean, if you don't want to play by society's rules and show basic human decency and compassion for the people around you then you're more than welcome to give up your truck/phone/internet/beer and go starve to death in a cave."
3255,You can even be mask free while you do it!
3256,Yay freedom!
3257,I can relate...
3258,The problem is that it spreads a lot.
3259,"The more B.117 spreads, the more chances it has to mutate into something even worse, maybe into something that renders our current vaccines almost useless."
3260,"Okay, but the GQP‚Äôs answer to all of those problems is to run the same guy who caused them."
3261,That won‚Äôt play well in 2024 when things are so much better than they were in 2020.
3262,Social media savvy people have been getting people the extras at the end of the vaccination clinic day.
3263,Start asking around and try to free up your day from 4:30-6:00 to get to a site.
3264,Yep- this exactly.
3265,The government has done a splendid job at making the bogeyman people who are making the vaunted SIX FIGURES.
3266,"There is grotesque wealth being hoarded by a select few, and yet the sights get set on people making $100-200k."
3267,It's so interesting watching people contort themselves to the belief that they wouldn't be a teensy bit frustrated in my shoes.

3368,Go smoke your bowl and have a good night!
3369,"This is exactly how it is in Arizona, and while spending some time there, I saw exactly zero shouting matches over mask policies."
3370,"The only difference I saw between Arizona and my mandated home state is if you went to a non-chain retail store in a municipality without a mandate, there was a chance that they'd have no mask policy."
3371,"So unless you spend a lot of time at small liquor stores and gas stations, it's really just like living in a mandated state."

3379,When Pfizer and Moderna testified recently they said 120m/100m doses respectively by the end of March.
3380,Moderna supply hasn't increased a single bit so far.
3381,I don't see how moderna gets anywhere close to 100m unless there's a huge surge forthcoming for the last two weeks of the month.

3383,Seems like in most states the biggest delays are in actually making their way to the sites.
3384,It sounds like to me most appointments released are booked very quickly.
3385,Idk if maybe this isn‚Äôt the case in some states though.
3386,Can only speak to my experience in NJ and family/friends in Boston and Florida

3406,"Considering all the posts about Ford, sorting by popular in Canada, what with all the shenanigans it's nice to hear some good news."
3407,Israel should show why this type of thinking is shortsighted.
3408,We need to wait and see how it plays out.
3409,Lots of good signs but we won‚Äôt know for sure until we get through these couple of months of mass vaccination.

3473,Surprisingly I know half a dozen friends all sub 30 and vaccinated.

3475,Seems weird that 70 million Americans have had their first shot and some states are only starting on the 50+ age range now.
3476,Seems a lot of younger people jumped the queues
3477,I don't dispute that at all.
3478,I think what I was saying with the number of vaccines completed in Ohio the state is definitely nowhere near done with their 60+ population and as the number of vaccines being given every week greatly increase with time there won't be the bandwidth to be trying to reach the high risk populations.

3499,Did you have a similar reaction to the first dose?
3500,I am getting my second dose soon and I am kind of scared .
3501,No June or July is probably much more likely depending on how people who are unsure about getting vaccinated pan out.
3502,"Middle to end of May is when production capacity will be near 100 but we know there is a delay between manufacturing, shipment to states, and eventual administration that takes anywhere from 2 weeks to a month."
3503,On top of that immunity of some sort takes about two weeks to kick in.
3504,But that information upsets people in this subreddit
3505,HEB has been doing a great job at mask enforcement.
3506,Have you considered reddit isn‚Äôt representative of the population that watches him?
3507,Reddit is largely white liberal men.

3527,"Sorry, the high horse of having informed opinions?"
3528,Montana where I‚Äôm from is doing exactly this.
3529,Our new GOP governor lifted our mask mandate before even Texas did (we just somehow didn‚Äôt get credit for being the first) but left the option for counties and cities to keep their‚Äôs in place.
3530,Now our state Congress is about to pass a law to outlaw local mandates and they have a veto-proof majority in both chambers.

3558,"That coupled with the fact that Evangelicalism preaches family above all else, it's a lot more serious when you're repping grandpa instead of internet theories."

3560,Not to pick sides but the same can be said for those who fear the virus that much.
3561,Plenty of jobs that allow you to work from home and plenty of delivery services to provide you with all the things you need.

3564,"CDC is still recommending not to travel, so just continue to be safe üôè"
3565,"Yeah, if there isn‚Äôt a very significant increase in numbers a week or two after the opening then people need to see that this is ineffective."
3566,You can talk about the idea that people will wear masks anyway and that individual places will keep having mandates and etc.
3567,but that doesn‚Äôt contradict the fact that statewide mask mandates being removed hasn‚Äôt been shown to make things worse.

3581,"That big govt thing:  ""more police will fix this!"""
3582,Florida has been in this situation since September.
3583,Counties and cities came up with their own mask ordinances regardless of no ability to fine people for violating them.
3584,Businesses required masks to enter.
3585,"At least in the area I live in, I've never seen someone without a mask at the grocery store or gas station."

3589,Good.
3590,Fuck the system.
3591,That is fucked up beyond comprehension.
3592,It does not surprise me one bit yet it is still very much fucked up.
3593,Several places I know are throwing the last &lt; 10 doses out at the end of the day.
3594,"They are usually the community sites (for the local neighborhood) where they get relatively few doses in the first place, and don't advertise that they have vaccines on the internet."
3595,"Walgreens, CVS, and state-run places are more efficient at making use of their doses."

3608,&gt; But opposing mask mandates?
3609,"That's nothing more than stupid, selfish dick-waving."
3610,These Governors are taking a gamble.
3611,The vaccines are being rolled out.
3612,A lot of people were already infected which brings them some level of immunity even without vaccinations.
3613,And between March and early June of last year the southern states really didn't see any major outbreaks.
3614,The weather they have now promotes going outside and we know being outside in the open air doesn't really promote the spread of the virus.
3615,These Governors are banking that by the time June rolls around enough people will be vaccinated and the infection rate will be so low that the spread is almost non-existent.
3616,This way months from now they can walk around and brag about how they opened up and dropped the mask mandates well before any other state.
3617,Plus for Texas is a distraction from the shit storm of a situation they were in a few weeks ago.
3618,Im from NJ.
3619,Its a lot easier here if you keep trying.

3625,"Yet another strike against the narrative that Russia is Mordor, Russians are orcs and their vaccine is just polonium mixed with Putin's jizz."
3626,"Unfortunately the pushers of that narrative are not capable of feeling shame, so it doesn't really matter."
3627,So what you're telling me is we can stop 1% extra deaths by wearing a mask?
3628,Sounds amazing.
3629,I'm in.
3630,Can you linke to a mask selling website?

3653,"It says ""number of offenses""."
3654,"This number is made complicated by the population of each state, what culturally people will report, and what people will report considering if they think the police are appropriately staffed / will respond / care."

3660,"we shouldve locked the country down, hard, 12 months ago, but we didnt so it is what it is"
3661,Can one go to another state to get a vaccine?
3662,"Theoretically yes, but stricter governors will keep finding excuses to stay closed and be as cautious as possible, even with real-world evidence that reopening doesn‚Äôt cause a surge in cases."
3663,"They may be the first state-wide to offer the vaccine to all adults, but some states have offered the vaccines to anyone in specific cities, usually low-income minority-heavy cities."
3664,"For example, Rhode Island has opened the vaccine to anyone in the city Central Falls: https://www.centralfallsri.us/coronavirus"
3665,This thing should be open to gen pop
3666,We should have done challenge trials 9 months ago.
3667,Did everyone clap for the screamer after too?
3668,I'm guessing at least another year
3669,A gap for even Pfizer is currently backed by real world data in the UK for up to 2 months.
3670,This is where data on other aspects of the immune response is used to fill gaps.
3671,Mild infection invokes solid nAB concentration for 4-6 months before decline begins.
3672,"Doesn‚Äôt mean as soon as decline begins you‚Äôre all of the sudden 100% susceptible, just that you start getting more susceptible."
3673,4 months between shots should leave you without any nAB decline until you get your second shot.
3674,"But given the supply ramp up, most Canadians probably won‚Äôt have to wait 4 months for a shot."
3675,"30-32M eligible people in Canada, and let‚Äôs say 90% want a shot."
3676,"That‚Äôs 28.8M at a maximum, 27M on the lower bound."
3677,"36.5M guaranteed doses by June 21st apparently (cumulative from December till then), so if 90% of eligible Canadians take a shot, there will be supply to vaccinate approximately 7.8-9M of them with a 2nd dose by the end of June."
3678,"Obviously, this doesn‚Äôt include any supply from J&amp;J, Novavax, or AZ, so that number could grow."
3679,"4 months from today is July 9th, so I don‚Äôt think the 4 month limit will be hit in most cases."
3680,My larger worry is people getting 1 shot and seeing no need for the second shot because they‚Äôre fine.
3681,They won‚Äôt understand how much better their (longer-lasting) cellular immune response will be after the second.

3689,thats how science works
3690,I just assume everyone suggesting people call their pharmacy or loiter around stores in hopes of obtaining extra doses have no concept of the limits of staff.
3691,They see things simple - there's a dose there's an arm and we all get vaccinated faster.
3692,They miss the fact someone has to answer the phone and hundreds of calls add up very quickly.
3693,It's a minor inconvenience to the individual who calls around asking about waitlists but can be a massive disruption to the pharmacies they are calling cumulatively.
3694,The real magic number that most health experts are quoting is getting below 100 deaths a day.
3695,"It‚Äôs a little arbitrary, but 100 deaths a day is about how much the flu typically kills a day precovid times."
3696,"The thinking is that by the time it‚Äôs as impactful as the flu typically is, we can go back to normal."
3697,It's not a conspiracy theory.
3698,It was the playbook for the Trump Administration's COVID task force.

3715,"There was no order, just no more mask mandate."
3716,Texas made it clear cities like Austin can still have their own mask mandate.

3747,"&gt;Counties and cities have the right to create and enforce mask ‚Äúmandate‚Äù laws locally, the lift of the State mandate means that the State will no longer ‚Äúprosecute‚Äù mask policy at a State level."

3754,"Although it was only after one dose, so the effectiveness of both vaccines after two doses could be different."
3755,Instead of empty words UK could put this to rest by publishing a list of number of vaccine exported to whom and when.
3756,To me the only difference between blocking an export and not exporting something is language.
3757,The net result is vaccines being produced and kept within the borders of the producer.

3803,"other studies have previously shown pollen increases viral infections   

**Pollen exposure weakens innate defense against respiratory viruses**
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31512243/

&gt;Results: Pollen significantly diminished interferon-Œª and pro-inflammatory chemokine responses of airway epithelia to rhinovirus and viral mimics and decreased nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factors."
3804,"In mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus, co-exposure to pollen caused attenuated antiviral gene expression and increased pulmonary viral titers."
3805,"In non-allergic human volunteers, nasal symptoms were positively correlated with airborne birch pollen abundance, and nasal birch pollen challenge led to downregulation of type I and -III interferons in nasal mucosa."
3806,"In a large patient cohort, numbers of rhinoviruspositive cases were correlated with airborne birch pollen concentrations."
3807,"&gt;Conclusion: The ability of pollen to suppress innate antiviral immunity, independent of allergy, suggests that high-risk population groups should avoid extensive outdoor activities when pollen and respiratory virus seasons coincide."
3808,The study here was to see if there was an increase in covid19 infections related to pollen as well.
3809,"138 for the US, 101 for France, that's quite a bit better."
3810,"And I suspect Covid19 should spread more easily in France than in the US (much higher population density, much higher use of public transportation vs individual cars...)"
3811,"&gt; The conclusion is that rich people have more wide-ranging connections than those at the lower end of the income scale, and they have the means to maintain their social lives, despite lockdowns."
3812,This increases their risk of infection.
3813,"&gt; A previous study showed a higher percentage of upper socio-economic groups live in cities, which have higher infection rates than elsewhere because of population density."
3814,"&gt; And because the rich have larger houses or apartments, and many have second homes, they have been able to continue hosting friends at home, despite recommendations to limit social interactions, especially shared meals, which have been shown to spread the virus."
3815,"&gt; Even working from home has not protected the wealthiest, as many can afford outside childcare, which could also explain increased infection rates."
3816,"The real difference is that the wealthiest have taken lockdowns as vacations and curfews as an opportunity to invite friends over for the night, and have not behaved as if there was a pandemic."
3817,The wealthiest all fled to the seaside and the nice parts of the coutnryside during the first lockdown.

3821,i'm sensitive to chemical fragrances so will be wearing them indoors even after I get vaccinated  when I have to be around one of those people who felt the need to douse themselves with the whole bottle or I have to run the gauntlet at a store of reeking scented candles or rushing down the laundry aisle to get the unscented detergent etc.

3964,"Vaccines are the real metric to prove the virus degree of mutation, it was always the goalpost, just see this subreddit, it's 90% about vaccines."
3965,"So, don't speak about moving goalposts..."
3966,What an asshole
3967,"It would be punishing them for taking shots away from those at higher risk, resulting in needless extra deaths."
3968,"Actually, any adverse reactions typically happen within the first hour or two."
3969,This is why they make (or should be making) you stay for 15 minutes or so after administration so that you are monitored and in a place that can deal with reactions should they happen.
3970,"Severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis can be treated very easily if/when it happens and the patient is in a hospital/pharmacy/doctor's office, etc."
3971,"Benadryl/epinephrine/dexamethasone can be given if needed airways can be maintained, and CPR and access to defibrillators can treat dysrhythmia or cardiac arrest."
3972,"People that have had severe allergic reactions to any vaccines in the past or those with severe drug allergies should inform the staff giving the vaccine of their history, if their physician has been over the risks/benefits with the patient and ordered the vaccine they will know to watch for these signs/symptoms."
3973,"If you're referring to side effects hitting much later then those side effects would be arm soreness, fatigue, fever, headaches, etc, and they aren't life-threatening and pose no problem for driving at any time really."
3974,"Those side effects are actually preferred and a good sign your immune system is spinning up a response, which is the aim of the vaccine to begin with."
3975,"Those are good signs, and most physicians are saying to take that a step further and NOT treat those symptoms with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and other anti-inflammatories and fever reducers."
3976,Let your body do what it is supposed to and was supposed to do in the first place.
3977,I'm an RN but only in NICU and Pediatric ICU so we aren't vaccinating children yet obviously but my husband is an ER physician and has been taking care of Covid cases for over a year now and hasn't seen one single anaphylactic reaction at all.

3984,I wonder what would happen if they actually divided though.
3985,Can you eat money?
3986,‚ÄúThe great back pedal‚Äù
3987,Yeah this post title feels antagonistic.
3988,"The governor isn‚Äôt outlawing masks it‚Äôs just letting local government, businesses, and people choose to."
3989,We didn‚Äôt have vaccines last spring and summer.
3990,Now we do.
3991,"And surprise, the vaccines work!"
3992,They both reduce the risk of transmission and reduce the severity of COVID if you do get infected.
3993,That‚Äôs why the Christmas surge will be the last one.
3994,"If there is a new ‚Äúsurge‚Äù that occurs over Easter, then it‚Äôll be nowhere near as big as the one we had last Easter, and hospitalizations and deaths won‚Äôt increase alongside the case count (because the people most at risk of getting a severe case of COVID were given priority for vaccines, and again, the vaccines work)."
3995,lol does they mean they will feel like going back to work?
3996,In lab tests they found a significant reduction in antibodies generated.
3997,"Moderna claimed a ""six-fold"" reduction and Pfizer claimed a ""2/3"" reduction."

4003,"Probably not the same culture that brought Joe Rogan here, which I only now realized."
4004,"And there are plenty of people here that wish it had not become such a hip cool place to live, or at least gained it's reputation for such, for the exact reasons you mention."

4010,Ahh.
4011,Gotcha.
4012,The wording on your other post was a bit confusing.
4013,I also need more caffeine today lol.
4014,"But, I agree with you."
4015,"I remember the U.K. variant was dormant for 3 months or something, like quietly spreading then caused a bunch of cases."
4016,I wonder how long the media will latch onto ‚Äúscariants‚Äù before finding something else to talk about.
4017,We need Biden to do something stupid on Twitter for these articles to stop
4018,[removed]
4019,or you live in Georgia
4020,I just read that Pfizer said it was 1 week after the second vaccine.
4021,Pretty sure it's actually close to the best ratio we've had.
4022,Early on we had twice as many distributed as administered.
4023,Keep in mind that there are data lags as well so probably more has been administered than has posted yet.
4024,Everything is continuing to ramp up.
4025,"&gt;Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V vaccine appears to be gaining acceptance in the¬†European Union, as the head of Germany‚Äôs regulatory authority publicly praised the Covid-19 jab and Italy could become the first European country to produce the vaccine from the summer."
4026,"&gt;Thomas Mertens, the head of Germany‚Äôs standing commission on vaccination, described Sputnik V in an interview on Wednesday as ‚Äúa good vaccine that will presumably also be approved in the EU at some point‚Äù."
4027,"&gt;‚ÄúRussian scientists are very experienced in vaccines,‚Äù Mertens told Rheinische Post."
4028,‚ÄúSputnik V is a very clever construct.‚Äù
4029,That's good to hear!
4030,I hope more people have experiences like yours than like her family's!
4031,And lockdowns.
4032,"In the peak of El Paso being one of the deadliest cities for Covid (at the time), the local state judge ordered a lockdown where sketchy franchise owners sued to end."
4033,The Governor jumped on this for political points &amp; TX ~~sleazebag~~ attorney blocked the lockdown.
4034,Deaths increased and I lost family &amp; friends to the virus because the political party trumps human lives.
4035,Are you assuming that the clinics are open 24/7 in that calculation?
4036,Thanks for the update.
4037,"So little is known about this little virus, yet also so much :-)"
4038,Excellent!
4039,I‚Äôm so happy and relieved to hear this.
4040,Their community has been hit so hard and were ignored.
4041,"Yup, exactly what I'm saying."
4042,The anti-maskers people love to see on social media &amp; dunk on have nothing to do with how long this is taking.
4043,"Other countries have had terrible spikes, it's definitely not a uniquely American thing"
4044," No, I'm not stupid."
4045,The context around that is absolutely biased.
4046,Read the entire thing.
4047,"The interview mentioned only contributes a minor point saying that the person interviewed simply can't give enough information because COVID is a dynamic thing and so different in each situation, so to say Florida or California is right is misleading."
4048,"I would encourage to always be healtlhy...to take their vitamins, drink plenty of fluids, exercise, eat healthy and try to reduce stress."
4049,That's general positive information.
4050,You sound like a really upset individual who looks strong on the interwebs but would crawl into a ball in real life if you had an actual situation to confront.
4051,"It's ok, I know it's hard to find out that you're not as big and bad as you think you are."
4052,Dumb title.
4053,How is the need to be 16 or older not an eligibility requirement?
4054,"Even worse is all the ""pre-COVID!!!!!!"""
4055,interjections that nobody asked for.
4056,"Like, you can give someone a restaurant recommendation without also letting us know that you haven't personally eaten there in a year."
4057,"As long as your illness isn't severe, you're good."
4058,"This is talking about children, but the same applies to adults: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/visit/sick-child.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/visit/sick-child.html)

Don't take a pain reliever before the shot."
4059,There is some very limited evidence that they might reduce the initial immune response.

4067,You will almost certainly be able to get a shot next month if you want one.
4068,Everybody is underestimating how fast this is going to go now that production/delivery is really ramping up.
4069,"This is fair, but we're being driven apart by a media that likes to weaponized drama."
4070,Your analysis is missing a few key details.
4071,J&amp;J reported efficacy at 4 weeks post-inoculation.
4072,"This was likely way too early, as antibody levels don't peak until about 50 days."
4073,"The 2-dose trial is also spacing out the shots 8 weeks, not 12 weeks."
4074,"Given that we know vector resistance is a legit issue (giving a 2nd dose too early for the Oxford vaccine actually LOWERED efficacy (55%) compared to just letting one dose build up (70%), it's very possible that we could see J&amp;J go from 66% to 80+ since they will have allowed antibody levels to peak before giving the 2nd dose."
4075,That's why I'm asking.
4076,Why put the statistic 3/5 voters if there is no correlation with whom they voted for?
4077,It might help to understand the basis of or the source of the information for which they are making these decisions.

4088,"Masks aren‚Äôt needed

4089,The variants are causing a temporary plateau because they spread faster but the end game is still the same - vaccines work
4090,Sounds awesome.
4091,Hope the attendees have fun!
4092,"Wow, that's amazing!"
4093,Did you know that over 70% of Americans are classified as obese or overweight.
4094,"So basically, you're not proving anything."
4095,"Nevertheless, because old people are also dying at a much faster rate, then we should tell them to stop being old."
4096,That will fix it.
4097,So I was looking at the NY Times vaccine data by state and noticed that a lot of the states ranked near the top in % of population given at least one dose were cold weather states.
4098,I pulled the data into Excel and cross-referenced it with the avg temperature for each state and the correlation coefficient is -0.53 (meaning the colder the state the higher their vaccination rate is expected to be).
4099,"In statistical terms -0.53 is only a moderate correlation, but it still means there seems to be some correlation right now."
4100,I would've thought this would be reversed given the challenges colder states have faced with snowstorms considering the vaccination process has taken place entirely during winter months.
4101,Anybody have any theories what's causing this?
4102,[removed]
4103,Distribution is greatly outpacing administration.
4104,Lower the age threshold
4105,"[As someone over there said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx9RUQpLHbo), the Florida counties do their own thing."
4106,Always have.
4107,DeSantis ordering a facemask mandate would've been null as counties decided beforehand to either enforce it &amp; lockdown or hold off on it (which led to [pictures of beaches where it is packed on one side &amp; empty on another)](https://fox40.com/news/jarring-photo-shows-difference-between-open-and-closed-florida-beach-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/).
4108,My whole family in Texas is up in arms about it and I feel bad because I think several of them are deeply upset by it.
4109,They're also all vaccinated and none work outside the home.
4110,The masks will come off at some point.
4111,Im not going to wear a mask when there's no mandate and I'm vaccinated just to prove.....what?
4112,I dont know!
4113,not sure where you are seeing conflicting data.
4114,everything I've seen points to 2 weeks for all the vaccines.
4115,I'd go as far as to call it insulting.
4116,Many colleges have treated students *terribly* over the last year.
4117,This is in addition to charging full rates and limiting access to almost everything the students' tuition money is supposed to pay for.
4118,Side note...
4119,I think COVID might be the thing that pops the higher ed bubble.
4120,I'm asking this without knowing the answer at all: Is 30% (roughly) more distributed than administrated better or worse than what we're used to?
4121,If a large number of people are hesitant then it‚Äôs the states job to open up eligibility.
4122,Appointments should not be going un-used.
4123,"While this is sad, one person out of how many vaccinated?"

4127,"&gt; The EU politicians really shot the EU in the foot long term by putting in place an export ban, only time will tell its actual affect."
4128,There is no export ban.
4129,"There are export controls, which means authorization is required for vaccine shipments to be exported."
4130,"But other than the one shipment of AZ vaccines that was scheduled to go from Italy to Australia (250K doses), all exports have been cleared to proceed."
4131,"And the fate of those 250K AZ doses is yet to be determined and may still end up going to their original destination (they've not been confiscated, they were just blocked from being shipped out for the time being)."
4132,"True, although infection rates are still important until the majority of folks are vaccinated and some sort of herd immunity takes hold."
4133,Hospitalizations also remain an important indicator.
4134,Some places are definitely managing better than others.
4135,"Especially when those choices can kill people, right?"
4136,That just tells me we all need to work together to make this whole civilization thing work.

4149,"I think the point of the article is that they'll keep masking and distancing while the pandemic is underway, not after."
4150,They're saying that despite governors making these decisions they're still going to listen to the health experts.
4151,"I don't think listening to data and sound science is virtue signaling, whatever that's supposed to mean in this instance."
4152,Our Governor eliminated the mask mandate as of today.
4153,"Before today, businesses could require masks be worn in the stores because the powers that be said so."
4154,Now it‚Äôs on the stores to enforce it because the mandate has expired.
4155,"Stores don‚Äôt want that burden, because in many places that has turned violent and they don‚Äôt want to put their employees in that position."
4156,"Some stores are still (loosely...) enforcing masks, like Target and Kroger, but others are simply requesting customers wear them and leaving it there."
4157,So yes.
4158,"As of today, you can walk in Market Basket without a mask and nothing will happen."

4164,"Instead of opening for everyone, at least in TX, they should rethink the dose allocation so major cities receive more doses and smaller county with less demand receive a bit less, once we get close to 70% of all 1b vaccinated (those who wants it) I feel it should just open for all, no need for another 1c category."
4165,Their rules make no sense.
4166,No travel for fully vaccinated people?
4167,It‚Äôs total rubbish.
4168,Missouri is having issues.
4169,Rural areas got too many vaccines while cities were ignored.
4170,Our governor is an idiot.
4171,Or evil.
4172,Or both.
4173,Honestly the nerve of [The NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/technology/vaccine-misinformation.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) to ask why black and latino communities are getting the vaccine less.
4174,The reason people aren‚Äôt getting it is because of orgs like them and NPR.
4175,I say this as someone who consumes both every day but my god I heard about the Tuskegee Experiment like 4 times a week listening to the two of them.
4176,By highlighting reluctant people and giving them a megaphone they put that fear out there and made it seem normal.
4177,The problem is that you cant tell *why* by looking at doses used.
4178,"Your number of 65% could be because the state is a clusterfuck and cant mobilize to use the doses they have received, or because  a large number of people have been hesitant to get the vaccination, or any other reason."
4179,"If anything, people not following the rules has made the pandemic shorter here in the US."
4180,Immunity from prior infections will help us reach herd immunity faster.
4181,"I don't disagree that behavior had a lot to do with the spread of COVID, and I don't think anyone can say for sure what the numbers would look like if we had an X% increase in mask wearing, or a X% decrease in parties, etc."
4182,"my point is, I don't think there's any realistic change that could've happened that would get us to a restriction-free 2021."
4183,"(I keep saying ""realistic"" because there are some people who want legitimate widespread police enforcement of strict social distancing and no one leaving their house unless absolutely necessary - regardless of opinions on that approach, there's no way it's realistic in the US)

In a hypothetical approach where the US did see an increase in mask wearing and social distancing, and a decrease in ""non-essential"" interactions, let's say cases would be 30% lower than what they have been in the US."
4184,"30% fewer cases and deaths would have been amazing, no doubt about it."
4185,But the thing with that is that we *still* would be following those restrictions around this time.
4186,"As soon as people stopped being as diligent about masks and distancing, cases would immediately rise again."
4187,"If cases were 30% lower than they ended up being, I still couldn't go to a concert in March 2021, because that would be the type of thing that doesn't happen in this hypothetical world."
4188,"And that's my point - no one ""prolonged"" this pandemic."
4189,"We could've taken more actions to prevent more deaths, but that inherently involves *more* restrictions, and as soon as we drop those restrictions, cases will shoot back up."
4190,"Meaning even in this hypothetical world, we'd still have to wait for a vaccine, just like we had to do now"
4191,I got both doses of the Moderna vaccine.
4192,How long til I'm at maximum immunity after the second shot?

4236,Stop stretching the truth.
4237,"No argument that being unhealthy in any form, whether it's obesity, smoking, alcohol, stress, etc all contribute to risk factors for COVID."
4238,"So if I find a study showing that hypertension increases COVID deaths, then we should tell everyone to never have a stressful interaction, so no work or no disagreements, because it could lead to COVID death."
4239,Your logic is so poor that's is not even worth the time to write this.
4240,"I write it, because you and the rest of the people upvoting your other comments need to know that you're hurting others with your insistence to ignore science and the truth."
4241,&gt;The EU didn‚Äôt impose an export ban so vaccine manufacturers chose it as a manufacturing centre.
4242,Most of those facilities already existed.
4243,A more likely explanation is that EU bureaucrats tried to be cheap on the vaccine contracts and that put them at the back of the line.
4244,But hey they are paying a lot less for the vaccine per dose than the US is.
4245,Feel free to actually make an argument against its contents.
4246,"And they might better be able to do that now with hospitalizations having gone down but there is not a ton of this drug probably available and where it's available is probably a major secondary limitation and it's delivered by iv, so it's still quite likely people get sent home until it's too late for administering this drug."

4252,&gt;I am low-risk and could probably attend a super spreader event right now with no risk to myself.
4253,"I don‚Äôt want to kill anyone, though, so I don‚Äôt."
4254,Do you attend those events outside of COVID times?
4255,"Half of all flu cases are asymptomatic, so you could be passing that on to others without even knowing it."
4256,That kills the elderly *and* kids.
4257,This is the problem with acting as though people are nothing more than disease vectors.
4258,Town with Population 100 in bumfuck texas.
4259,That‚Äôs how they did it.
4260,Think you‚Äôd get the same results in Dallas ISD?
4261,[removed]
4262,No shit man can I get this for my kids?
4263,They're too old to breastfeed and too young to get vaccinated.
4264,"Also, can you just drink antibodies?"
4265,"Healthy, retired 40 year olds are about the only thing that isn't covered."
4266,"&gt;So far, health officials don't believe that this new variant strain causes more severe illness or reduces the effectiveness of vaccines

Frankly this is all I needed to hear."
4267,Infection rates aren't as important as they used to be since the vulnerable are being targeted by American vaccination efforts.
4268,"Obviously it's terrible for countries with lacking vaccination efforts, and I do hope it doesn't spread significantly outside of the United States, but domestically I don't think this will do a great deal to increase deaths and hospitalizations."
4269,And?
4270,They will deliver 4 million every 2 days to the EU in Q2.
4271,Biontech and Pfizer really have an unstoppable supply chain!
4272,It's also some serious whataboutism in this context.
4273,"&gt; IMO, at this point, there is a legitimate debate about whether it is best to focus all the efforts on elder, or whether it is more effective targeting certain vectors of transmission."
4274,All the other nations have done these calculations (including the fact that young people have much more life to live) and still come to the conclusion that the old should be prioritised because the chance of serious illness and death is so vastly higher.
4275,"Considering hundreds are dieing every day in Spain, the vast majority of them in this group, it is obvious that they should be prioritised."
4276,"Spain's hesitancy is simply because they do not yet accept the data on efficacy in the elderly, not because of some strategy of theirs to prioritise those most likely to be exposed."
4277,"127.9 Million doses have been Distributed

2.0 Million Administered today

4.7 Million Distributed today

only 74.8% of total doses are Administered, think its time to lower the age limits..."
4278,"True, some rural counties gets more doses per habitants than others, major cities have lack of doses and people are driving hours and hours to counties that have a lack of local demand."
4279,It is incredible how the majors cities in TX are having such a hard time but if you are willing to drive you can easily get it elsewhere.
4280,They should just rethink the allocation of doses.
4281,"For real, I'm deployed right now."
4282,"Maybe we'll get it sooner than later thanks to J&amp;J's vaccination storage requirements, but I really don't get why we would need it faster than anyone else."
4283,"Plus in our case, if we catch it, it's 10 days paid quarantine and if there are any long-term/permanent ill-effects from it, we'll probably get serious disability pay for life."
4284,Indeed.
4285,"Nohynek's (the health official) vaccine comments can at least be explained by the fact that so few finns have been vaccinated for now, it's sort of similar to what Fauci and CDC said a while ago."
4286,"Of course, this kind of messaging undermines vaccines and leads to confusion when they eventually have to backtrack and acknowledge the facts about the vaccines."
4287,"She kind of goes into this in the article I linked, but the media jumped on the scaremongering part."
4288,"The PM's comments meanwhile are irresponsible beyond belief, especially since the people are loosing it over the current curfew plans"
4289,I haven‚Äôt made any claims.
4290,"Cool, well I‚Äôd rather you give me $10,000 than wear a mask around me."
4291,It‚Äôs gonna do a whole lot more for me and everybody if you did that instead of wearing a mask around me
4292,"If we weren't idiots 10 months ago, we wouldn't be having this problem."
4293,Australia and New Zealand have gone completely back to normal without any masks because they took it so seriously
4294,I think it‚Äôs a political poll that includes coronavirus stuff.
4295,Not a coronavirus poll that includes some voting demographics.
4296,"But yes, you are not wrong."
4297,Just not logical.
4298,So edgy bro
4299,Same difference but most places have an option for phone for those unable to do online.
4300,It's almost like the government has very little interest in saving as many lives as possible.
4301,"I'm 100% sure at this point our leaders think ""as long as most people survive it's no big deal"""
4302,Definitely an interesting experiment in herd immunity
4303,Missouri's governor doesn't have a college degree...
4304,"Because when people try to go to normal too early, we end up in lockdowns."
4305,Australia handled it so well and they're back to normal right now.
4306,But go off
4307,I've been working on getting appointments for people at my company.
4308,We're all essential grocery employees without the ability to work from home.
4309,The vast majority of us just want a vaccine.
4310,Many I've talked to find the 'one and done' of JnJ very appealing.
4311,"Since the mass vax sites in our area have been using JnJ, we have rapidly increased our percentage of staff who have received their full vaccine schedule."
4312,Try KN95s or KF94s that typically are designed for smaller faces.
4313,"I feel like if we hit the brakes every time a new variant is announced, restrictions will never end."
4314,This reads like an emojipasta lol
4315,"Where I am in Chicago, pretty much everyone follows rules."
4316,I've seen maybe two people in stores etc wearing masks below their mouths in the past *year*.
4317,"I don't know, the advice of people who devote their entire careers to studying viruses and microbes should be taken more seriously than my aunt on Facebook advising the opposite."
4318,"Our government is listening and making recommendations at the behest of experts, along with nearly every other country's govt."
4319,What nonsense.
4320,The military has had a plan in place [for months](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/article/2440556/dod-announces-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-plan/).
4321,Vaccines are being distributed abroad.
4322,The only real issue is the [high refusal rate](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/thousands-service-members-saying-no-covid-vaccine-n1258214) so the DoD is [debating whether to mandate once fully approved](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/military-may-revisit-making-covid-19-vaccines-mandatory-after-fda-grants-approval.html).
4323,Tuesdays are always slow... it‚Äôs gonna pick back up
4324,"There are some antibiotics they quit making because they couldn't make money on them, you know, no patent and easy to make so it's dirt cheap."
4325,Other old antibiotics could be reinvigorated by combining them with peptins.
4326,"Signed up last night with about 890,000 people already signed up."
4327,It's currently at almost 1.2 million so it seems like people are signing up fast.
4328,"It sounds like this list has been going on since January, but is getting a lot of exposure now and accelerating."
4329,Hopefully providers sign up to it since there aren't many using it right now.
4330,"That may be true for some manufacturers, but not all of them."
4331,"Sinopharm, I think, has 50% efficacy without the second dose"
4332,Come onnnn Maricopa County...
4333,why the fuck aren't we putting everything into getting people vaccinated yesterday?
4334,so sick of people apologizing for this mess of a rollout.
4335,San Diego
4336,"I think the reason is because for awhile if you mentioned doing anything or posted a picture everyone would freak tf out like where was your mask why are you doing this right now etc

When it was something from the past 

So it prompted everyone to start having to interject that they did so pre covid"
4337,I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson on Monday and had the tiniest bit of soreness the next day.
4338,Two days later I can barely feel any soreness.
4339,My mother-in-law in Sicily got her first shot of AZ today.
4340,I'm so happy for her and hopefully her parents can get it like they're suppose to at the end of the month.
4341,"While I would never encourage any illegal or unethical conduct, CVS has not been validating anyone who requests a vaccine."
4342,[removed]
4343,"In the beginning of all this, experts said 60-70% of the world population would catch it without vaccines."
4344,Flattening the curve with restrictions and mask mandates prolong the pandemic to protect hospital capacity.
4345,If the virus was allowed to just rip through the population the pandemic would be over a lot faster.
4346,"&gt; I don't think people are dumb, I think they are emotional and the pandemic had caused trauma that they want to get rid of

people who are going through trauma can make stupid choices too."
4347,"The random lady on the bus doesn't realize its not just their life they are putting at risk for their little bus ride of escapism from reality, pretending the pandemicis better now."
4348,They hurt other people by doing this too.
4349,Sure the government may have failed them but passing the blame onto others is what got us this far into a pandemic.
4350,"Blame China, blame Karens, blame our government."
4351,Everyone has someone to blame these days but a huge portion of the population refuses to accept the important part we all play in this pandemic.
4352,"If you don't follow the restrictions you are part of the problem, there is no exception to that."
4353,"mfw eric feigl-ding talks about how schools in the UK üá¨üáß  *must* be shut because of covid üò® but flies his own kids to a 'mountain retreat' 
‚õ∞Ô∏è in austria üá¶üáπ to receive in-person schooling after 3 months of online because it is ""abhorrent"" to spend so much time in front of a screen üì∫"
4354,He may have historic approval levels by year end due to ending the pandemic in the US but he needs a plan for the rest of his term over the next 3+ years 2022 to 2024.
4355,If he runs for a 2nd term in 2024 he can't just run on ending COVID in the US like he was able to this past election.
4356,Because we‚Äôre not doing this based on your feelings.
4357,It's utterly nonsense.
4358,"The USA ban is from December, you simply don't change your supply chain in a month ffs."
4359,"The EU became a manufacturing center because others, most notably the USA but also UK, refuse to allow export."
4360,"Manufacturers simply fill orders from available plants, which are those located in the EU."
4361,Looks like we‚Äôve hit an upper limit of how many doses we can administer with the current resources.
4362,We need to open up more sites and skill up more people to put jabs in arms.
4363,It also shows that we can still get the virus after both vaccines.
4364,Not even accounting for the variants.
4365,What‚Äôs the point of getting the jab then ?
4366,It actually is though.
4367,Your mom needs to lie IMHO.
4368,She needs the vaccine ASAP.
4369,"At last where I live, it is all the honor system."
4370,You just sign a form saying you are eligible.
4371,I would bet that no one would actually turn her away.
4372,"Try facebook, look for a vaccine hunter group."
4373,they will help you.
4374,Shows that vaccinations lowered the IFR in the meantime unless the group they selected was specifically younger than general population.
4375,I work in a theme park and this mask thing has made it very obvious to me that the same people who don‚Äôt wear masks are the true jerks in life.
4376,"They are the same ones who do other annoying or rude shit in the park like cut in line, be rude to staff, other obnoxious behavior."
4377,"It never fails that when I see some of that pre-pandemic bad behavior, I will notice they also have their mask down or will a few minutes later."
4378,Masks have just made it obvious who who toxic people are.
4379,"I was gonna say, feels pretty good to me tbh"
4380,The CVS near me had a wait list you could sign up for.
4381,Should be a staffed information desk just inside the store.
4382,First I hate fucking masks.
4383,But until I know from the CDC stats that over 70% of the adult population has been vaccinated there is no way I'm taking off my mask in stores.
4384,I get my second one on Friday and even though it's seems pretty good at stopping the spread and what not I am the dude that gets all the weird shit.
4385,"I have had two cases of chicken pox, I've gotten shingles at 32, I've gotten HFM from my kid from his daycare and he didn't get a damn thing."
4386,I'm not taking that god damn chance with my health.
4387,Yikes
4388,By the end of May every adult American who wants a vaccine will have at least received their first dose and at least half will have received both doses (or 1 dose of J&amp;J).
4389,I would bet money on this.
4390,Production will continue to accelerate as well as distribution/scheduling/injections.
4391,"At some point during May, a 4th vaccine (Novavax) will also likely be approved in the US."
4392,We're on track for a normal Summer and no amount of fearmongering about VaRiAnTs or CHiLdREn will change that.
4393,Im not sure i understand.
4394,So you are agreeing that the development of amounts of positive tests in texas is going in a good direction?
4395,I think they're running out of people.
4396,"I think some tiers are opening up to combat this, my fiance got a notification yesterday that he's now eligible and he's in 1B tier 2, so maybe the ball is just starting to roll again there."
4397,There were tons of slots and he got to even choose what shot he wanted.
4398,The demand with current eligibility doesn't seem to quite be keeping up.
4399,I think Newsom setting the March 15th start date for 16-64 with health conditions was about 1-2 weeks too late.
4400,Let's keep those jabs flowing...
4401,"Because there's been plenty of lab tests, they all the same."
4402,"Which is great, but what people want now - and ultimately matters - is real world tests."
4403,I work at Target.
4404,"My state is allowing grocery workers to be vaccinated now, which includes me."
4405,I got an email from my health district (which was through my employer) offering appointments for the J&amp;J vaccine.
4406,I got mine Monday.
4407,Went to work tuesday and learned our CVS had the vaccine.
4408,"From what my supervisor said, they were prioritizing people 65+ and employees could get it on standby if they had leftover doses."
4409,Also found out that Target is paying workers to get vaccinated (2 hours per dose but language was ambiguous regarding one dose vaccines) and paying for Lyft rides to vaccination sites.
4410,Overall I‚Äôm pretty impressed and pleased with my region‚Äôs and Target‚Äôs efforts.
4411,Can anyone update me with what Walmart is doing?
4412,"I used to work there and it was awful, especially compared to Target."
4413,I‚Äôm curious if they‚Äôre doing anything for their employees with respect to the vaccine.
4414,"It's likely 100% at keeping you alive, fear not"
4415,"As a DFW resident, I'm not rooting for it to fail."
4416,But I wish the capacity were limited.
4417,I want full crowds at sporting events as much as anyone.
4418,"In fact, it's my own personal marker for ""normal."""
4419,"But according to Dr. Jha, we're so damn close to ""normal"" it'd be best to just push through these last few weeks."
4420,"We've survived a year without full crowds, we can make it at least a few weeks into the regular season."
4421,"And where I am, they're going to START vaccinating 90+ March 15th."
4422,Yay Canada.
4423,I‚Äôm really hoping our Friday numbers can break into 3M and next week we see a 2.5-3M 5/day avg over the weekdays.
4424,I‚Äôm guessing after tomorrow it‚Äôll be hard to get an appointment as that‚Äôs when the 50-59 year olds can finally start making appointments.
4425,"Relax, chicken little."
4426,I‚Äôm still waiting for the super bowl surge.
4427,I want to know too.
4428,"That's the one I am getting at the end of this month and I can barely find any information on it, other that it's 50.4% efficient in Brazil and 70% in Turkey."
4429,But my country is so close to Brazil that I would be concerned.
4430,well unfortunately the next goalpost to be moved will be that.
4431,"Not an epidemiologist, but the effects of increased vaccinations in Israel are definitely being seen in reduced bad outcomes."
4432,Younger people are probably being riskier and therefore getting sick.
4433,"I'm eager for things to happen, and it feels like it takes forever if you check every day."
4434,But if the R0 gets below 1 then eventually the cases disappear.
4435,More vaccinations make it happen quicker!
4436,"Usually when you buy something, you take ownership of it at some point."
4437,We have more demand than supply.
4438,"The more we buy, the more supply we will get."
4439,The less chance people will have to wait for appointments.
4440,The websites they have to sign up for your appointment are absolute garbage.
4441,"Buggy, require a ton of demographic information and CAPTCHAs just reach the end and find out the particular site is fully booked then it is back to square one for the next site."
4442,"Yeah, why would they ban export of components?"
4443,That would only hurt themselves (aka Pfizer might export less to the UK without them).
4444,If the EU would ban exports to the UK and the UK stops the components.
4445,"Then the EU could say: ""well, then you will get them even later""."
4446,But that would be very childish (from both sides).
4447,"To sum it up: The UK doesn't produce much vaccine to begin with and has a ""small"" overall market compared to the EU (66M against 440M)."
4448,Stopping all exports to the UK would not help the EU significantly.
4449,It's a sad state.
4450,Theoretically the EU should be at least as prepared as the US to tackle the vaccination with all the factories and know how they have.
4451,Little bit of bad luck that they mostly bet on Sanofi and AZ...
4452,[removed]
4453,Yeah same here in Washington State.
4454,They are throwing out vaccine on the daily over in Eastern WA because of lack of interest.
4455,Meanwhile people are rabidly seeking vaccination over on the Western side and there's way less opportunity to do so.
4456,We're never getting past this huh.
4457,[removed]
4458,I go to a state school in NY and we have to wear masks while walking around campus outdoors.
4459,Especially on a gorgeous day like today it‚Äôs just fucking dumb.
4460,Even more contagious yet our 7 day case avg has been dipping since February 3rd.
4461,Just keep wearing a mask and get your vaccine when possible.
4462,"Maybe, but do they even need it?"
4463,Alaska is actually doing fairly poorly in distribution based on doses used vs doses received.
4464,It sounds like they are doing a good job getting doses to remote places but their throughput is not great.
4465,And my state has had to pause vaccine clinics due to lack of supply in late February.
4466,I live in Seattle and my county has used 93% of our doses as of yesterday and we get new supply on Sundays.
4467,"So yes, distribution is definitely being throttled due to low supply in some areas."
4468,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

4473,Makes sense since older adults (65+) are &gt;60% vaccinated?
4474,Between 1 and gazillion % deadlier.
4475,fEaR tHe roNa
4476,"Idk, I think 3.04x10^64 is kind of an unreasonable age limit."
4477,I got the first shot on 2/28.
4478,I had a few days of arm soreness but after that nothng.
4479,True
4480,Yeah until recently I felt like you had to either lie or be in a very select group to be vaccinated.
4481,My parents are both now partly vaccinated and teacher friends are too.
4482,Wider availability seems imminent (weeks rather than months).
4483,oh.
4484,yeah that would be a big problem for sure :P
4485,"Yeah, there was a *NY Times* article about a few cases of weird blood disorders following vaccination: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html)"
4486,"Not only will supply go up, that will solve our biggest current issue."
4487,"If we received a million more doses per day, we would be injecting a million more people a day."
4488,At some point we could hit a bottleneck of sites or needles or personnel but we are far from that today.
4489,I assumed 1.6 million people had already been infected (so twice their confirmed case count).
4490,"But of that 1.6, I assumed a bit more than half (1 million) had ALSO been vaccinated, so there's only .6 million added to the ""some protection"" total"
4491,Its right in the sense that is what the companies said they would deliver.
4492,But note that there is about a 2-3 or so week delay between what the company considers delivered and what gets into the arm.
4493,"So pfizer + moderna say 220m doses by end of march, that doesn't mean 110m people have their first dose by end of March."
4494,That would probably happen time by 2nd week of April
4495,China got to make some money out of its mess.
4496,Convenient
4497,"If supply is no longer an issue, we should REALLY be expanding vaccination sites and hours, as well as thinking about offering doses to all."
4498,It's getting really frustration having 30-40% of the  current eligible population refusing the vaccine while the rest of us are staying home and being responsible until we get it.
4499,I know what you mean.
4500,"If the referendum was tomorrow, I'd struggle to justify voting to remain."
4501,It means 2m doses have been reported as administered to the CDC since yesterday's update.
4502,Most of those doses were actually administered a few days ago.
4503,"&gt; and both our mothers said the mRNA are linked to early abortions and other child deficits

Please try to convince them to lay off the Fox news and/or Facebook news, because this is just straight up propaganda."
4504,"Like, its genuinely harming our entire society having this type of lie spread."
4505,"(I had to repost this comment and edit it because overzealous mods thinks two words put together makes an entire post ""purely political"")"
4506,That's fair.
4507,Do you know if there's any public data that compares the general mortality rate of the public to mortality rates of vaccinated people?
4508,"I mean, it seems more likely that this was just a horrible coincidence, but I also understand why her family is convinced that the vaccine killed her since they are probably trying to rationalize her death."
4509,I guess I'm just somewhat concerned that we will outright dismiss stories such as this because it's important to get the vaccine out there.
4510,My neighbor Frank makes his own vaccines from moldy banana peels and bleach.
4511,You're saying that's just as effective?
4512,The messages you were sent are unwarranted but leaving reviews over this is kinda cringe.
4513,"For one, you are welcome to not patronize these establishments."
4514,"Two, an exposure is at least 15 minutes of close interaction with an infected individual."
4515,"Your risk is your own to manage, not to impose on others."
4516,"Businesses have these rules in place to protect their own employees, not you"
4517,"It wasn‚Äôt really the Super Bowl itself, it was the festivities surrounding it."
4518,I remember seeing pictures of packed streets in Tampa where almost no one had masks on.
4519,Uh yeah.
4520,100% a massive cause of the anti-vaccine sentiment in minority communities (Black especially) is caused by the media and the Tuskegee Crime.
4521,It‚Äôs causing a huge distrust for a vaccine that is extremely safe and efficacious.
4522,It‚Äôs preying on ignorance by replaying for clicks an experiment that started almost 100 years ago and is one of the few things like it.
4523,"How many people have safely received smallpox, Chickenpox, Shingles, MMR, Covid vaccines?"
4524,"NYT, NPR should be ashamed of themselves."
4525,Minorities need to trust the system now.
4526,Not be spooked by something that wasn‚Äôt even a vaccine 100 years ago.
4527,"Same, my mom's 59, isn't doing Chemo any more, but is still being treated with immunotherapy for lung cancer, even has a prescription for the vaccine, she can't get an appointment yet."
4528,"Northern Texas, in the panhandle."
4529,Surely complicating it by doing this will actually slow down the rollout/cause problems?
4530,"Keep it simple in my opinion

Edit: you would also have to vaccinate a very large portion of the population in these border areas to establish any kind of localised her immunity."
4531,Would suck for everywhere else where the vulnerable aren't fully vaccinated
4532,lol why would Pfizer want to offshore manufacturing and production overseas?
4533,"Have Pfizer self-manufacture, create and grow it's homegrown, American-made coronavirus vaccine in plants right here in the U.S."
4534,They're underrepresented and more susceptible.
4535,Basically a vulnerable group.
4536,Thanks for this reply.
4537,This is reassuring
4538,And maybe also where the distributors are located.
4539,Seeing a lot of people in the Minneapolis area driving an hour or two into more rural areas to snap up appointments.
4540,Seems like some places have more supply than they need while others can‚Äôt get enough.
4541,"This is all anecdotal, of course."

4543,"I'd hope the end goal is to stop the spread, eliminating all symptoms and transmissability because that's the only way to truly eradicate this."
4544,If we only stop the symptoms then we put ourselves at risk of leaky vaccine.
4545,"Right, I‚Äôm not disagreeing, just saying that abandoning priorities for really fucking sick or disabled people and throwing everyone into an age pool no matter their health status is going to lead to people dying who didn‚Äôt have to."
4546,There‚Äôs a great opinion piece on this in the Post today.
4547,AZ fucked us to the tune of about 40 million fewer doses delivered in the 1st quarter.
4548,And then they kept exporting doses produced in Europe instead of honoring their contract with the EU.
4549,"Compared to that, getting 4 extra million doses is great, and Pfizer should get praised for it."
4550,"I would buy everything from Pfizer and make AZ pay for it, but not like Trump made Mexico pay for the wall."
4551,Time for Balto 2: Electric Boogaloo
4552,glad i glanced down before reading your wall-o-text to see this all boils down to YOUR OPINION ü§£ü§£ü§£
4553,Interesting.
4554,I had not heard of J&amp;J doing a trial in young children.
4555,According to the NY Times [link] (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-testing-children.html) J&amp;J will do a trial in 12+ then a trial with younger children.
4556,So it'll still be a while before the trial for young children starts.
4557,"But, it's still good news!"
4558,"Despite his repeated efforts to obscure the death toll, DeSantis managed to be handed a vaccine just after deciding to open nursing homes back up."
4559,Did the death toll rise?
4560,Yes.
4561,Dramatically.
4562,Did he make Flirida the premier spot for rich tourists to come and take the spot in line from locals needing the vaccine?
4563,"Yes...  Just like he spent millions of taxpayer dollars vaccinating the richest, whitest, and least at risk populations first so long as they donated hundreds of thousands to his reelection fund."
4564,Did he manage to be saved by the timing of the vaccine?
4565,It's impossible to tell yet since he's still got someone working full time to UN-certify registered covid deaths and drag out the official accounting for those that are added by weeks or longer in a transparent ploy to make the death toll look like it's constantly improving.
4566,"...  Just exactly like Rebekka Jones said he would right before he demanded she be arrested on an ever shifting premise, then sent state agents with AR-15's to her house as her family was held at gunpoint despite it being a complete sham since the logs they needed were already found on the state server anyway, and Florida law forbids forced entry to a domicile for the sole purpose of retrieving a computer without mitigating or exigent circumstances."
4567,Past tense.
4568,"They realize now long haulers are a thing, not psychosomatic."
4569,"I didn't read it as ""daily"" growth rates, just overall."
4570,It is definitely daily compound growth rate?
4571,That would add up a ton!
4572,You claimed it‚Äôs not normal ANYWHERE.
4573,The fact that some large chains mandate masks does not mean that some areas of the country have not gone back to normal.
4574,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard as well.
4575,I saw data that it is more common.
4576,Too bad the administration isn‚Äôt placing any priority on the US military personnel (especially those overseas) receiving the vaccine.
4577,Yeah I read several accounts from one of the Florida sites where some people where were medically eligible could not get a note from their PCP (if they had one) in time.
4578,I agree it is better to remove documentation requirements.
4579,Ah ok. Just checking for context.
4580,Agreed.
4581,Edit: also I‚Äôm sitting in a coffee shop and everyone still has masks on.
4582,Nothing changed where I am
4583,I hope they straighten that mess out for you.
4584,"It seemed like that here in a state next to you at first, then it suddenly started moving."
4585,"I hope that's the case with all of you, and they start getting it widely available fast."
4586,&gt;lol what does that even mean?
4587,we should inoculate an entire population based on a glorified hunch?
4588,This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhunch‚Äù.
4589,We know for a fact that [longer intervals ](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2AJ1WZ) makes the AstraZeneca vaccine *more* effective.
4590,"Canadian researchers found the Pfizer and moderna vaccine after one dose to be extremely effective, the only thing we don‚Äôt know for sure is how long the immunity after one dose lasts for."
4591,"The medical experts note: 

‚ÄúSkowronski and De Serres cautioned that there may be uncertainty about the duration of protection with a single dose, but said the administration of the second dose a month after the first provided *""little added benefit in the short term."
4592,"""*‚Äù




&gt;you know how many vaccines including HIV vaccines had ‚Äúencouraging data‚Äù but fell apart during a proper trial?"
4593,Well good thing these vaccines have passed a proper trial.
4594,*We literally have a 20 million person [case study](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/single-shot-of-astra-zeneca-pfizer-vaccines-cut-hospitalizations-u-k-says-11614619961) for longer intervals in the UK*.
4595,The fact of the matter is delaying the interval *will* save more lives.
4596,The rewards outweigh the risk in my opinion.
4597,Yeah you‚Äôll notice a big decrease later today probably
4598,and I am making sure that people are not looking at these numbers as an indicator of the wisdom/stupidity of the governor's new rules (or lack there of)
4599,"exactly this, but the school tests are the rapid ones not the same as test centres so its actually false data that is not the same."
4600,"Typical the govt would do this, any way to lie/ mislead to make something look better"
4601,[removed]
4602,I don't have a problem with people (any age) getting the vaccine if they need it - but only if they get permission from their doctor.
4603,"Right now, there are many states (i.e."
4604,"Georgia, South Carolina, Texas) where anyone can claim to qualify (cheat!)"
4605,and no when will ever verify it.
4606,That's not fair to those with underlying conditions... or people over 60.
4607,So interesting.
4608,My first jab arm hurt like a mother.
4609,Couldn‚Äôt lift it over my head for 24 hrs lol.
4610,Second it hut a bit less but I had more whole body symptoms
4611,That just makes it available to rich people.
4612,Social media influenced anxiety is a very real thing.
4613,It goes both way for either Covid deniers or Covid extremists.
4614,"I'm in the middle, I realize that this thing isn't just another flu but I also realize that it's not a death sentence like Ebola."
4615,"I think a majority of people are like me and take it seriously for what it is, it is just the people on the farest ends are the most vocal."
4616,The public messaging and political nature throughout this whole thing has been terrible and I'm sure that hasn't helped.
4617,Plus leaving the EU has really helped the UK in terms of vaccines.
4618,It's like were in bizarro world where every bad decision accidentally becomes a good one.
4619,What's the opposite to the monkeys paw?
4620,I think that‚Äôs more common with the second dose.
4621,Walmart also posts their new appointment slots for the following week at midnight each day.
4622,"That's not a voluntary export ban, that's: we made a contract first, get it fulfilled

The EU are just throwing shit, losing friends and alienating people"
4623,My company made sure all employees got the hot Johnson injection.
4624,It's been a thing since the vaccines were first made available and still is.
4625,A lot of places don't have residency requirements so people come in from out-of-state.
4626,"&gt; First of all, they are much more interested in returning as many people as possibly to flying and traveling."
4627,"And even more than that, *like almost every corporation*, they are interested in staying out of the red and turning a profit."
4628,There is no glorious humanitarian goal to simply get people travelling and flying for their own benefit.
4629,"&gt;  If United charges a lot, people can switch to Delta or JetBlue or American."
4630,"And what Delta, JetBlue and American will do is raise their prices to 75% of what United does."
4631,"They're still competitive, and they're still making money."
4632,"&gt; I would literally pay $100 to just fly like I did before the Covid without the quarantines, required testing there and here, etc."
4633,And that's probably what they're hoping for.
4634,"They charge you *only* $25 extra for that supposed benefit, then you're happy about 'saving' $75 and they're happy that they've squeezed $25 more out of you."
4635,"Just look at the performance and cost of airline travel in the last 30 years: we've gone from 2 free carry-ons and 2 checked pieces of baggage plus an illusion of customer service and in-flight meals on flights greater than 3-4 hours.... to paying for any carry-on larger than a small purse plus any checked baggage, apathetic customer service more akin to cattle herding, and having tiny boxed lunches and sodas hawked in many flights."
4636,And this wasn't just one airline doing it.
4637,"The forces of competition within the industry may exist, but they are not as restrictive as you would believe."
4638,Reality of low numbers 30 to 100 percent seems scary at first glance until you realize the ACTUAL death rate is probably .05 percent with the covid classic.
4639,"I mean, it‚Äôs not."
4640,You‚Äôre acting like the EU is on a high horse generously giving away vaccines that are rightfully theirs.
4641,"The reality is the EU are just another customer in the queue, who happen to have production facilities in their region."
4642,"All this talk of vaccine nationalism is a blame game to distract voters from their failure to act decisively, quickly, and with unity."
4643,Problem is managing the appointments.
4644,"If everyone becomes eligible at the same time, it will be impossible to find appointments for many (particularly the non tech savvy) and they may become discouraged from trying."
4645,I remember a Vice video about the damage antibiotics had on a village in India that had a lab that dumped antibiotics into their water supply which in turn created antibiotic resistant superbugs and other problems for the local population.
4646,"The video is a few years old and even then they discuss the dangers of overusing antibiotics, shame that we've learned nothing."
4647,Hopefully nothing bad comes of this.
4648,I strongly doubt I‚Äôm the only American who appreciates working from home.
4649,Not quite.
4650,More complicated than that.
4651,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/12/05/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-in-south-dakota-caused-covid-19-coronavirus-outbreak-in-minnesota/amp/
4652,"I don't know why this ""at the same time"" stuff keeps being said."
4653,Duh!
4654,I know they won't all catch it at the same time.
4655,But as we've seen with our own eyes that as many as 200k a day will... if not more.
4656,That's enough to totally slam things.
4657,Especially if much more folks are getting it this time.
4658,"okay but how much longer are we going to be expected to wear a mask ""for the good of society"" (yuck)?"
4659,I feel like your comment is kinda proving that the masks are more a symbol of compliance and morality at this point rather than an actual tool to mitigate the virus.
4660,[deleted]
4661,Are you joking?
4662,"Good time to remind people that most of the vaccines (idk with astrazeneca) are all generally really good at reducing severe illness from covid, even if less effective at preventing infection."
4663,Get your shots when you can folks.
4664,FUCK AZ !!!!
4665,!
4666,"Also, I never said that JnJ is a bad vaccine."
4667,"All I said in my comment was that JnJ being a single dose vaccine is not ""an advantage""."
4668,It's a trade-off.
4669,Other vaccine's first doses are as efficacious or better.
4670,My point is that I don't like how one's immediately critisized if one points that out.
4671,There is no excuse for that.
4672,"It still gives a lot of protection and it's a GOOD vaccine, I just don't like bs,  that's all."
4673,Hopefully that makes sense.
4674,"If you want to die on the hill saying that restrictions and lockdowns are not harmful or at the very minimum an overreaction after May 2020, that's your choice."
4675,We're allowed to have  our own opinions.
4676,"Do take whatever vaccine you can, if you‚Äôre at risk."
4677,"If you‚Äôre not, though, waiting to see which vaccine is more effective against the African strain is a good bet."
4678,There was a study in South Africa that AZ is only about 10% effective and no data on the rest of the vaccines.
4679,"That strain is currently in Greece, Croatia and is likely to be all over Europe soon."
4680,What are you even talking about?
4681,There is zero misinformation in my comment.
4682,If you‚Äôd really like to get technical - every country should have shut down ALL international travel from the second we learned of the virus from China.
4683,WHO should have suggested this the second they were denied access to China to investigate.
4684,I‚Äôm sure we would all have a had a leg up had that happened.
4685,I‚Äôm mot ignoring it.
4686,"I‚Äôm pointing out a failure of America that is unique to countries of its size, wealth and influence."
4687,Brexit is irrelevant.
4688,"I suspect big box retailers like Walmart, Costco, etc will follow Disney World's move and require masks until 2022 at the very least."
4689,Florida is low key a free for all too.
4690,A lot of sites aren‚Äôt requiring medical documentation for 18+.
4691,"Once we got the oldest people vaccinated, requiring paperwork and making strict criteria only seems to slow things down, especially as more supply comes in."
4692,[removed]
4693,but that 14% are a huge portion of people getting hospitalized or dying from Covid.
4694,"So while it‚Äôs 14%, that knocks out like 90%+ of hospitalizations/deaths."
4695,Maybe don't go to the grocery store then?
4696,"Copied from the article:

The EU has conceded that the UK did not ban vaccine exports, as Boris Johnson waded into a row with Brussels by publicly ‚Äúcorrecting‚Äù the European council president over his claims about British policy."
4697,"The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that Charles Michel, the council president and a former prime minister of Belgium, had been wrong to allege the UK had imposed a prohibition on vaccine exports."
4698,"Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe can also be proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid response, including the ¬£548m we‚Äôve donated to Covax."
4699,"I, therefore, wish to correct the suggestion from the European council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports."
4700,"Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components."
4701,‚ÄúThis pandemic has put us all on the same side in the battle for global health.
4702,We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms.
4703,"I trust all sides of the house will join me in rejecting this suggestion and call on our partners to work together to tackle this pandemic.‚Äù

On Tuesday, Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders and helps direct policy, provoked an angry reaction in Whitehall after stating in a newsletter that the UK had ‚Äúimposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory‚Äù."
4704,"When asked about the claims, on Wednesday, a European commission spokesman confirmed there was no such ban."
4705,He declined to comment directly on the claims made by Michel.
4706,"‚ÄúWe know that different countries have got different measures in place ‚Äì that doesn‚Äôt concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,‚Äù the spokesman said."
4707,Officials nevertheless pointed to the lack of vaccine exports from the UK as compared to the EU as proof of the value of the European council president‚Äôs intervention.
4708,"‚ÄúWe need some transparency on that,‚Äù one said."
4709,"In his contentious newsletter, Michel had sought to compare the EU‚Äôs exporting record to that of the UK and other countries, including the US, in response to suggestions that the bloc was verging on protectionism in barring a recent export of vaccines from Italy to Australia."
4710,"Two weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, had also suggested that Britain and the US had blocked the export of Covid-19 vaccines."
4711,The EU has been seeking to defend its export authorisation mechanism ‚Äì which forces companies to secure approval ‚Äì against accusations that it is damaging vaccine supply chains.
4712,The UK has regulations to stop profiteering on medicines and medical items such as masks but does not impose a ban on vaccine components or completed doses.
4713,"In a sign of the testy state of relations Michel‚Äôs claim about a British export ban was on Tuesday denounced by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, as ‚Äúcompletely false‚Äù."
4714,The EU‚Äôs ambassador Jo√£o Vale de Almeida was summoned to the Foreign Office but he was in Brussels.
4715,"Instead, the EU‚Äôs charge d‚Äôaffaires in London, Nicole Mannion, the Irish deputy head of the Brussels delegation to the UK, was received on Wednesday morning by Sir Philip Barton, the permanent under-secretary of the Foreign Office."
4716,Barton is understood to have conveyed the government‚Äôs irritation about the claims.
4717,"A UK government spokesman said: ‚ÄúThis morning a senior representative of the EU‚Äôs delegation to the UK was summoned to a meeting with [Barton] to discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications.‚Äù

Michel tweeted on Tuesday night: ‚ÄúGlad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports to EU and [other] countries."
4718,"Different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines.‚Äù

EU officials declined to comment further on Michel‚Äôs tweet."
4719,"While there is no export ban or authorisation scheme in the UK, the government did ensure that vaccine doses produced by Oxford/AstraZeneca at the sites in Staffordshire and Oxford were directed in the first instance to residents in Britain."
4720,The EU has been angered by the refusal of the Anglo-Swedish firm to redirect doses in the light of production shortfalls from European facilities.
4721,"UK sources said the government had suffered supply shortfalls as heavy as those experienced by the EU, with AstraZeneca only delivering a third of what was anticipated by the end of the first quarter of 2021."
4722,"‚ÄúThe UK taxpayer paid for the development of this low-cost vaccine and has exported the knowhow, on a not-for-profit basis, to set up manufacturing capability all over the world,‚Äù a source added, referring to its contract with AstraZeneca."
4723,"Germany‚Äôs ambassador to Britain, Andreas Michaelis, called for an end to the sparring between the EU and UK."
4724,"Michaelis, a former head of Germany‚Äôs diplomatic service, said the relationship had to improve in the wake of disputes over vaccines and the Brexit withdrawal agreement."
4725,"‚ÄúIt should not continue like this,‚Äù he tweeted."
4726,‚ÄúWe have important things to do.
4727,Jointly!‚Äù
4728,Are you arguing that large chains haven‚Äôt put out very public newsletters announcing their mandates?
4729,"This isn‚Äôt anecdotal, I can back up my claims with evidence unlike your dubious tales."
4730,[removed]
4731,"I've been a little confused about this, officially we're in phase 1a and 1b and are starting 1c soon."
4732,However; everyone I know who has registered has received their first dose regardless of what group they're in.
4733,When will new york lift travel restrictions?
4734,"I feel like they could start opening up soon, daily cases are going down by a lot"
4735,"Yeah, city limits make Atlanta look like a medium-sized city when in fact it‚Äôs one of the largest metros in the country."
4736,Completely arbitrary
4737,Did you apply for access in VAMS within the last 3 days?
4738,"This looks like the email they send when your application is confirmed, but someone could be spoofing it with a fake link"
4739,[removed]
4740,Cannot freaking wait until my state opens up eligibility for all.
4741,I'm very grateful to be young and healthy and I definitely believe that those more at-risk should be prioritized... but I want the damn shot!

4772,"Yup, family med!"

4776,"Yea, I think the positive cutoff for our test is either 37 or 40."
4777,But either way its difficult to grow a culture of the virus with a CT over low 30s so I shouldnt be infectious.
4778,This is an important point.
4779,You're at 75% effectiveness 15 days after the first shot.
4780,"If you never got a second shot, you'd peak around 83% after 35 days."
4781,Getting the second shot after 21 days gets you to \~95% effectiveness two weeks after that second shot.
4782,"So while you shouldn't ""walk out of the pharmacy after the first shot thinking you have a magic shield"" as someone else put it, two weeks later you will have substantial immunity."
4783,"This is why some public health experts were advocating getting as many people first shots as possible rather than holding back doses for seconds, to get to herd immunity quicker."
4784,"Yeah, absolutely, but if someone's anxiety is keeping them hunkered down either with the vaccine (or making them refuse the vaccine, thereby keeping this going indefinitely for them), they need several appointments with a therapist."
4785,"I'm not being flippant, either."
4786,"If their anxiety has gotten to that point, there is \*nothing\* that is going to help them feel comfortable in the outside world again beyond time and therapy."

4798,Fatigue.

4801,"Someone says ""I have more headaches than I used to."""
4802,have their dietary and sleep habits gotten worse during the pandemic?
4803,"I also think a lot of these studies that are headlined like ""Long term symptoms in 30% of covid infections"" when a huge portion of those are things like ""anxiety"" are disappointingly trying to further a hopeless narrative because panic sells."
4804,"Moderna has 100% against severe cases, where Pfizer is at 95%, though

4824,"At 2mil doses per day, That's only 1mil people vaccinated."
4825,"1 million x 30 days is 30 million, not 60 million vaccinated in 1 month."
4826,If you walk into any Publix in Atlanta you are met with a mask mandate.
4827,Why are you still arguing like it is normal anywhere?
4828,Got my first Pfizer dose last Friday.
4829,No side effects whatsoever.
4830,I don‚Äôt think there is a single cause/a clear reason - but why are some people feeling under the weather?
4831,I‚Äôve read on this thread that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a sign I have a strong reactive immune system‚Äù which I don‚Äôt disagree with.
4832,But wouldn‚Äôt a better response be no side effects?
4833,Just a body that takes vaccine and manufactures copies of spike protein and antibodies without side effects?
4834,Yeah the 2 week average from data reported Monday or Tuesday would have been the first major spike after snow cleanup.
4835,"Now that we‚Äôre more than 2 weeks past, numbers are back down"
4836,"&gt;Alaska makes vaccines available to those 16 and older, becoming first state to remove eligibility requirements 

Those younger than 16 may see things differently."
4837,"Yes, Earth is a small island."
4838,Let US stop the misinformation and denial now.
4839,"As in, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave yet!"
4840,We‚Äôre waiting for the vaccine!‚Äù
4841,"Not sure I agree with ""selfish."""
4842,As every EU poster has gleefully pointed out here for the past year... the US covid situation is a complete shit-show.
4843,"The US has by FAR the highest case count of any country in the world, and likewise by FAR the highest number of deaths."
4844,"No matter how you slice it, the US at the moment has a tremendous need for the vaccine."
4845,I don't think it is selfish at all for the hardest hit nation in the world to use their vaccines.
4846,"You can dress it up in semantics all you like, it remains an export ban"
4847,For once it‚Äôs paying off being cozy with big pharma
4848,I'm gonna try and get one of each for maximum protection
4849,"Yeah, it was just a wild guesstimate with the huge assumption that the lab results will translate 1:1, not meant to be taken as a serious attempt to calculate efficacy against the SA variant."
4850,"Also ""29% reduction in efficacy"" needs the before and after numbers for context."
4851,"In Novavax's case, a reduction from 89% to 60% is huge as that's a decrease in efficacy of almost 4x (risk increases from 11% to 40% compared to unvaccinated)."
4852,Whereas a reduction of say 70% to 40% would be a decrease by 2x (30% to 60%).
4853,And the SA trials were proven incredibly fallable as they only included younger participants.
4854,"AZ believe it prevents 100% of severe cases of the SA variant

https://www.smh.com.au/national/astrazeneca-boss-says-vaccine-effective-against-variants-20210307-p578id.html"

4858,"Other than dworld and universal, I don't think florida has any restrictions"
4859,"It *does* resist vaccine immunity, everyone's tests have been consistent on that."
4860,The mitigating factor is the double shot mRNA that are most of the USA vaccine drive were intended as overkill because we didn't know what was needed.
4861,So they have a lot of room to give before becoming ineffective.
4862,They likely still work better than we had hoped from the beginning.
4863,"The only vaccine that appeared ineffective against South Africa was AstraZeneca, which isn't approved in the USA anyway."
4864,"Don't forget the UK said it will donate its spare doses, once we finish vaccinations, to the poorer parts of the world."
4865,The UK ordered 400 million doses of vaccines.
4866,Assuming all adults have 2 doses.
4867,That's ~300 million spare doses
4868,&gt;	Nipping this in the bud would have literally taken 3 weeks last March if this society wasn‚Äôt filled with egotistical morons.
4869,There is absolutely no truth to this.
4870,Herd immunity through either a vaccine or mass infections was the only way this was ever going to end.
4871,Some people test positive months after being infected.
4872,They would have just spread the virus after the 3 week lockdown.
4873,"It lives up to the stereotype, that‚Äôs for sure."
4874,wondering if they really did have a sneezing contest there...
4875,Yay!
4876,Wonderful news!
4877,Keep it up!
4878,"If you look at the graphs https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact their cases/hospitalizations are mostly in the young and unvaccinated, the numbers have been dropping steadily among the fully vaccinated 60+."
4879,"Israel also reduced restrictions and opened up some of their economy in the past month, which may have slowed their decline in cases."
4880,"To confuse things further, they also increased their testing in the past month, from 5-6k/100k population to about 7k/100k."
4881,just an opinion :)
4882,Morocco offered Sinopharm to conduct their own clinical trials and they approved their vaccine.
4883,Also they had an early agreement with Astrazeneca since one of the top scientists/executives has moroccan origines.
4884,"The national ID system also facilitated the vaccination process, you send a text message and if you're eligible you receive the date and time of vaccination."
4885,Also Morocco opted for those two vaccines since they're less logistically challenging to manage.
4886,"""could be"" there will always be multiple possibilities until there aren't

so 50% drop isn't sufficient considering 50% vaccination?"
4887,texas is going to texas no matter what anyone else says or does.
4888,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/israel-severe-hospitalizations-age note the dramatic decline in hospitalizations among those of an age where they got the early vaccines
4889,Doubt the UK received 9m doses from the EU according to the last news.
4890,Lipids for Pfizer are made in Canada actually.
4891,How should this not happen?
4892,"When a worker speaks above the powder, lots of large saliva droplets land on it."
4893,These have been shown to contain up to 1000 infectious doses per droplet.
4894,"Lab results showed weeks of survival of infectious virus at room temperature at high protein content, probably China has better data on saturated fat as well."
4895,The only question is wether there is a large conversion factor from outside aerosol inhalation to food throat and chewing aerosol infection.
4896,"It's certainly plausible, but no one has made decent tracing experiments public to nail this down."
4897,Spoken like someone who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about.
4898,I know quite a few 30 somethings in Texas that got vaccinations just because there were surplus that needed to be used during the snows.
4899,"I haven‚Äôt been commenting in here but I can tell you why personally, I‚Äôm done with them."
4900,My daughter has eczema under her nose and on her chin due to wearing a mask all day at school.
4901,My son has chronic dry eye that causes a nasty bloodshot eye that‚Äôs seems to be permanent.
4902,It‚Äôs been two months and it hasn‚Äôt gone away.
4903,I have zits/blemishes behind my ears due to the strings irritation for the time I wear mine.
4904,"I‚Äôm not ‚Äúanti-mask‚Äù I‚Äôm ‚Äúpro-something else, please God anything else."
4905,"Can we figure out another solution here?‚Äù

Also despite wearing our masks religiously for a year, my family still got COVID."
4906,"So from my experiences, I‚Äôm worn out by them, already contracted the virus, and want to move on with our lives."
4907,My family has sunken into a depression.
4908,Our mental health is slipping.

4944,This isn't how that works.
4945,These lab tests don't fully reflect the human immune system or how much the efficacy will be effected in the real world.
4946,The only way to gauge the efficacy would be to conduct a trial in South Africa or wherever this variant is dominant.
4947,Only Johnson &amp; Johnson has done Phase III trials in South Africa so far.

4960,Why the EU should do that?
4961,But none of that matters as long as elderly and vulnerable are vaccinated.
4962,New cases begin to become a meaningless statistic.

4974,[This makes me think of a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NwP3wes4M8) ... Just replace the word anticipation with speculation...

4976,The farthest one still has plenty of appointment openings for today and tomorrow.
4977,"Here in Houston, people who qualify are still having trouble getting appointments, so I‚Äôm kinda confused... like... do people out there not want vaccines?"
4978,Or do they just not know they exist?

4994,"Did you mean Phase III trials (IIRC, Novavax's efficacy was ~90% against original + UK variant, and ~60% against SA variant)?"
4995,"Yep and in the agreement between AZ and the UK government, the first 100m doses out of the production facilities in the UK the UK paid for will go to the UK."
4996,Any pharma company could setup shop in the UK now and export 100% of the vaccines they make worldwide.
4997,There is no law or restriction that would stop them by doing so.
4998,"There is no export ban, the UK expects AZ to make their deliveries out of the production facilities based in the UK and for them to honour the contract by doing so (aka buying something and expecting it)."
4999,Abbot and Adler are both idiots but this description is spot on.

5006,With the haphazard way our covid response has been and how it basically encourages people to travel from areas under stay at home orders to green zones.
5007,Yes I very much had my doubts that this would be achieved to quickly.
5008,"I live in FL, and yes, we def have our share of dumbasses (the King Dumbass being our Governor), but bikers come down here from all over the country to party for a week."

5010,It's not just FL being FL.
5011,most studies show that the majority of criminals don't qualify as mentally ill.
5012,"They are jerks, to put it mildly, who enjoy being jerks."
5013,in case of violent anti mask I figure this too holds true until proven otherwise.
5014,The problem is now there are elements of society egging certain beliefs on  so they feel emboldened enough to act out publicly and even proudly film themselves committing crimes.
5015,I agree with avoiding 'em.
5016,"If people can't mask up in public buildings &amp; encloses spaces during a pandemic, why should I trust them in other circumstances?"
5017,All times people wished for warning label on whom to avoid - well these people have literally unmasked and revealed their true nature.

5021,As an American I'm hopeful by Mayish we'll know if international travel is possible at all this year.
5022,Finally someone mentions the foundational differences wrt climate.
5023,The virus thrives in cold dry environments.
5024,"Florida is the opposite of that, the worst conditions for the virus."
5025,Florida had its worst numbers during the hottest part of the summer which is when people stay inside the most.
5026,Other states couldn‚Äôt replicate this because...they‚Äôre other states.
5027,true but they are very different vaccines.
5028,If both moderna and pfizer have said the vaccines should still work then they still should.
5029,unless they are lying.
5030,"Yeah but still, cases down could also be en effect from the lockdown."
5031,New hospitalisations and new ICU admissions are still high and dropped less than 50% from the peak middle of January.
5032,Despite the fact that Israle started to vaccinate risk patience and old people first I wondering and worried why it does not drop faster!
5033,I think the numbers from Israel really showing you should NOT open up to early (as they do now in Texas).
5034,The problem is these things don‚Äôt remain outdoor events.
5035,You‚Äôll have people flooding bars and restaurants.
5036,I can‚Äôt wait for large events but it‚Äôs still a little too early.
5037,Novavax had a 30% efficacy decrease during Phase II trials BTW.

5064,"Point being, if you were above 100 a day, I'm not advocating for extreme restrictions."
5065,We obviously want to level things off as we approach that number.
5066,That number is more to signal a point when all restrictions could reasonably be lifted.
5067,"Honestly, many public health experts recommend much stricter standards for completely opening up and unrestricting everything."
5068,I'm sticking with the 100 deaths a day because it seems reasonable.
5069,14 days ago only 53% had gotten at least one jab.
5070,Everything that's happened since then won't affect infectiousness yet.
5071,"If 1 million people who haven't had at least one dose have some immunity from prior infection, then you're still talking only 64% of the population having some immunity today."

5186,Why?
5187,"I think BionTech/Pfizer is better than Sputnik, and Moderna is better than Sputnik."
5188,Because mRNA is better than vector.
5189,"However, Sputnik is better than AZ, which is also vector, because Sputnik uses two vectors to solve the problem that immunity built up against the vector after the first innoculation can render the booster shot useless."

5193,"And then, if we get more vector vaccines against different diseases in the future, at what point will we have (partial) immunity against all the available vectors?"

5286,"[Per the CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm), mask mandates were associated with 0.5% less cases over the first three weeks, growing to 1.8% over a longer period."
5287,These are daily rates so the effect is exponential over time.
5288,"There are other studies that show similar effects across a large number of jurisdictions over longer periods of time, so there is no need to look at Texas at this particular time point to learn about the mask mandate effect, it is pretty well-known."
5289,"Given the rate cases have been dropping in the US, if that holds up, removing the mask mandate would not be enough to make cases grow and spike in Texas."
5290,"If cases are dropping at 2+% per day, even at it's maximum, the mask mandate effect of -1.8% is not enough to cancel that."
5291,"So, a spike is not expected based on mask mandate removal."
5292,What is expected is that the drop would slow in Texas.
5293,Whether that's acceptable in other places will depend on current strain on health care system and other local context issues.
5294,What federal authorities are worried about is the growth in share of variants.
5295,"If that causes cases level off across the US, removal of the mask mandate could push the growth into positive, especially over time."

5403,Good!
5404,Personally I think remote workers have a detachment from reality.
5405,City economies are shit right now.
5406,From what I saw the meathead was just trying bring to light the devastating reality of lockdowns on small businesses.
5407,I don't think the average remote woeker understands what that means.
5408,All while the state governments let essential corporations remain open.
5409,It's pure hypocrisy.
5410,Super bowl surge??
5411,?
5412,I think it should be until everyone over 40 is able to *access* the vaccine.
5413,"Inevitably, some over-40s are going to be rabid anti-vaxxers, so we wouldn't want them holding things up in the event we have a rule saying ""masks until everyone under 40 *gets* the vaccine""."
5414,"If instead we focus on access, we put the onus on those who make a conscious decision not to get the vaccine and put their own health at risk, without hassling everybody else."
5415,A Danish study about people in Long Term Care facilities who caught COVID post vaccination that's being discussed in /r/COVID19 (scientific) is a little more cautious.
5416,They found very little immunity until 7 days after the 2nd shot: https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1dwk2/vaccine_effectiveness_after_1st_and_2nd_dose_of/
5417,Bruh I am 18 and I've been vaccinated for a month.
5418,The last of my classmates got vaccinated yesterday (in a week they can join).
5419,Alaskan here.
5420,It's mostly due to our tribal health organizations who got their own supply of vaccines as Indian Health Service facilities (same with New Mexico).
5421,They did a great job with distribution to rural communities since they're already experienced with providing medical care for them anyways.
5422,Austin is a cool place.
5423,Can‚Äôt wait to go back
5424,Imagine passing a law and the people right outside your building don't even respect your stupidity.
5425,Nah I dont have money but I get to live in a nice neighborhood with a roommate in Dallas (in a house).
5426,In Austin I paid the same price for a 3 bedroom duplex with no backyard and 2 roommates.
5427,I guess quality city can mean a lot of different things but Austin is far more expensive than Dallas with worse infrastructure.
5428,"I hate to be the ""Austin used to be super cool"" but a lot of what made is special has been commercialized and is so congested."

5444,It takes 2-4 weeks for the vaccine to be effective.
5445,"This is how *all* vaccines work, because that's how long it takes the human body to properly memorize how to fight the virus."
5446,"Also, getting the vaccine does not mean you are immune from being exposed to and spreading the virus to others, so unless you're a selfish pos, you should still take precautions until the pandemic ends."

5480,Exactly what history are you evoking?
5481,"Texas: I'm no longer going to impose a statewide mandate

Austin: I choose to impose that mandate within our city."
5482,So fucking what?
5483,Nobody is saying Austin can't have a mask mandate.
5484,Your history looks pretty negative and slightly racist to meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
5485,It isn't despite Greg Abbott's order.
5486,Counties were always free to set their own mandates as they saw fit.
5487,"It would be like the Federal Government saying, ""We're no longer going to make marijuana illegal,"" but a state saying, ""We're still going to criminalize marijuana possession."""
5488,A larger government lifting a restriction and a smaller one continuing it isn't a slap in the face of the larger government.
5489,Every county and city in Texas is still free to impose whatever mask or occupation restriction they deem fit.
5490,All Abbott has done is give that power to the more local governments.
5491,Why is this bad?
5492,"Right after my first dose, my arm was a bit sore and I developed a minor headache."
5493,The headache went away after about 24 hours but my arm was mildly sore for about 3-4 days after vaccination.
5494,Not bad at all.
5495,"For my second dose, right after vaccination - same symptoms as the first dose but the next day my arm was extremely sore (couldn‚Äôt even lift it over my head), I also had a pounding headache, and I was fatigued."
5496,These symptoms lasted about 24 hours but the following day I woke up feeling great and my arm also felt a lot better.
5497,"I was a bit nervous about the second dose, too, but don‚Äôt be."
5498,Any symptoms you get are a sign the vaccine is working and your body is making the antibodies it needs to.
5499,Plan to rest the day after your second dose and curl up with a good book or some trash TV.
5500,Hang in there and good luck!

5559,This much more likely option is more of a grey area regarding the ban.
5560,This isn‚Äôt a prison state
5561,I think they should let appointments for like 10+ days in advanced only be booked by the highest priorities.
5562,Everything 9days or less in the future can then be booked by the least priority.
5563,This way everyone who should have gotten a vaccine already a month or two ago can easily find one.

5636,Why should AZ export from the UK to fulfill their other obligations when they haven't even fulfilled their obligations to the UK?
5637,Not too hard to allocate 10 Mio doses for the entire first quarter.

And likely other places too, but it's hard to find a central list."
5650,"Admittedly only the first 4 on the list are actually ready and producing vaccines, but the others will be coming online soonish."
5651,"Also, the UK licensed it to AZ in a way that means it has to be sold *at cost*."

5653,EU are *objectively telling lies* about the UK in all this.

5655,But that's [absolutely false](https://www.croda.com/en-gb/news/2020/11/pfizer-croda) because the UK supplies the Pfizer factories in the EU with chemicals needed to make the vaccines.
5656,"[Pennsylvania](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Vaccine/Pages/Vaccine.aspx) and Philadelphia (technically a separate vax district from PA when it comes to fed allocations) are both still offering it to healthcare workers, 65+, and those 16-64 with specific conditions including obesity and smoking."
5657,"Some groups like teachers are finally getting vaccination appointments, but officially it hasn't expanded there yet."
5658,The problem with PA is they went from healthcare workers to 65+ and young 'high risk' people with zero proof of being high risk.
5659,"I know a good number of people who openly booked an appointment with the reasoning of ""you just have to check off a random condition like smoking and you can get it""."
5660,Add in how difficult some sites are to secure an appt\* and it has been open season for younger people while older people who aren't technologically adept struggle.
5661,"Would have been way better to open it to 65+ for a few weeks, then add some of the more very high-risk conditions w/doctor's note (can even be doctor's send out form letter to all their high risk patients), then add the other conditions + frontline workers."

5669,awesome thank you!
5670,Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
5671,"Remember, though, that each individual represents a larger percentage of the population in Alaska, so Alaska could hit thresholds for priority groups much faster."
5672,"For example, if both states wanted 75% of nursing home residents vaccinated before moving to residents age 75 or older living independently, each Alaskan moves them significantly closer to that threshold than each Californian does since CA has 54 times as many residents."
5673,"It‚Äôs not that Alaska threw away the playbook, it‚Äôs that with a smaller population and a large indigenous population getting a separate supply of vaccines, they‚Äôre able to speed run things easier."
5674,"I‚Äôm with you in that I can‚Äôt wait to see open access, it‚Äôs just going to take a bit longer in states with large populations."
5675,"If everyone hits their Q1 and early Q2 production targets, we‚Äôre probably not terribly far off."

5684,"Yes, I have heard this talking point a million times already, but the average person about 7 months ago did not know this, so being condescendingly told it in the beginning like we all had foreknowledge of how vaccine development worked was insanely annoying."

5698,Time for testing wasn‚Äôt a concern either because this virus spreads SO easily that they were able to track success and differentiate between the vaccinated group and control group.
5699,So do we take Oxfords IP rights back too?
5700,"And what about vaccine components, that we currently export to the EU's Pfizer factories?"
5701,I think the EU would be way more upset if we actually created the ban that they claim we have.
5702,Unless you're Palestinian living under Israeli occupation.
5703,Kind of odd that we don't calculate Israel's vaccinated % with everyone that lives under Israeli control.
5704,Worse than that.
5705,DeSantis actually made it illegal for local municipalities to institute more stringent Covid measures like mask wearing.
5706,This is the way...
5707,Lol here we go
5708,So we the people are stuck in a dryer and government is step bro?
5709,Did NYT take the case/death data off the front page of their site or only on mobile?
5710,"I killed chickens at a perdue farms for few years, all the waste from the kill room and evisceration, get pumped in a drain with fast moving water that's filtered out into a tanker farm, and we sold it to a dog food plant."
5711,Don't ever eat it again.
5712,There's chickens that come in on the trucks that's been dead a while and they're purple.
5713,Ugh.
5714,'There isn't a ban so there isn't a ban'.
5715,Sounds right to me.
5716,However much EU shills try to obfuscate.
5717,Even sinovac?
5718,At least in Florida the state has made it so local government can not punish people for not wearing mask.
5719,So essentially it‚Äôs an honor system which obviously doesn‚Äôt work.
5720,And can‚Äôt we all just agree mask work?
5721,Make people wear mask and we‚Äôll get through this with less fatalities
5722,"i rly hate this whole trolley problem game they‚Äôre playing with rolling out the vaccines, they should just test the poo in different counties and roll it out based on which areas have the highest cases."
5723,"they‚Äôre trying to make value judgements over who deserves the vaccine first, of course people gonna feel left out"
5724,[removed]
5725,As they should.
5726,The governor of Texas is so stupid for trying to require a no mask state.
5727,Doesn't need knowing the fucking coronavirus is still going on
5728,All available evidence shows you to be wrong.
5729,"Either you have some sort of underlying reason for being anti-mask (usually it‚Äôs political affiliation, but I don‚Äôt know what your particular malfunction happens to be) or you‚Äôre failing at grade school-level scientific thinking."
5730,Probably the former.
5731,‚ÄúWe refused to lock down!‚Äù is not evidence that lockdowns don‚Äôt work.
5732,It‚Äôs evidence that you don‚Äôt we don‚Äôt give a shit about our fellow man.
5733,OP mostly posts on Serbia so is picking data to suit their agenda.
5734,I know a lot of younger essential workers‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîwho have recently gotten it.
5735,"I do not know healthy young randos who have gotten it, nor where they would qualify."
5736,"Its not despite, that is exactly the point of the order."
5737,Stop politicizing the virus.
5738,[removed]
5739,I know plenty of people who latch on to any positive story and hold on for dear life.
5740,It's much easier to be a pessimist and be pleasantly surprised.

5743,Was in ICU in AZ with COVID.
5744,"After some close calls, I improved and got discharged."
5745,"On my way out, a nurse in the desk area asked if I was."
5746,"COVID patient... when I said yes, she dialed a number and went ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a COVID patient going home!‚Äù so music starts playing ‚ÄúHere Comes the Sun‚Äù from the speakers."
5747,"Apparently they didn‚Äôt get very many COVID patients make it, so when someone beats it, it‚Äôs still a novel thing."
5748,I don‚Äôt get emotional over much but that one hit me hard.
5749,"HCWs in AZ will probably have as much PTSD as the patients, tbh."
5750,Except everyone has tried to villainize groups of workers like Teachers.
5751,Several Mayors and Governors have called teachers unethical for wanting safe face-to-face working environments and vaccines.
5752,Absolutely berated them.
5753,Parents enter board meetings for districts and go off about how teachers lives are not as important as the lives of the kids.
5754,The abuse being hurled verbally right now is absolutely unreal.
5755,"Prosecuting people for ""line jumping"" would only give these abusers ammunition to actually start screwing with teachers lives in more tangible ways than just expecting them to get sick and possibly die for daycare."
5756,"... and before you try and say we aren't essential..... yea, they forced us back face to face in the southern states (which don't have the right to strike) with little to no proper precautions or safety measures."
5757,"Teachers, parents, and students are catching and dying of Covid left and right."
5758,"I mean, I'm vaccinated, and will probably get whatever COVID vaccine is offered to me barring catastrophe in the coming months, but a lot of the companies who developed vaccines have had shady things happen in their pasts, and the vaccines *were* developed quickly."
5759,"Of course, that could mean nothing, but people being called 'anti-vaxxers' for questioning in the beginning what is being put into their bodies is ridiculous."
5760,"The onus is on scientists to tell us and prove to us it is safe, which it seems so far they likely have, but average people shouldn't have to blindly just accept it."
5761,"All that said, idk about Berenson lol."
5762,[removed]
5763,That's exactly right.
5764,"&gt;In the COVIDVu study, participants were randomly selected from a U.S."
5765,Postal Service database and sent invitations to provide samples.
5766,"More than 4,600 people completed surveys and returned samples to a central laboratory by mail."
5767,Happy for you and as they should be if vaccinated!
5768,Hopefully one day the UK can be open again.
5769,I'm literally vaccinated and can't do shit still ü•≤
5770,Chicken pate.
5771,Only the best
5772,I fear that's a pretty accurate explanation on both sides yeah.
5773,"Moderna is on track to meet its delivery requirements, unlike AZ"
5774,"Vaccines don't get ordered from countries, they get ordered from companies."
5775,Loads of countries ordered AZ vaccines and AZ would use the UK production plants to fulfil those orders if it was allowed to.
5776,"But it seems, it isn't."
5777,AZ in fact put UK production facilities on the EU contract as part of the primary production line for the EU.
5778,Crazy how different things are for us.
5779,Here in Texas I am fully vaccinated and everything is wide open and booming.
5780,Truthfully it has been wide open and booming for months here.
5781,4 million doses extra by March means that they are already producing almost 10% more than estimated.
5782,Pfizer/Biontech has been a blessing to the EU!
5783,Why do Americans fetishisize companies so much?
5784,"This will undoubtably increase spread, sacrifice front line workers and in this thread people are defending a billion dollar company like its their deadbeat dad."
5785,What kind of dog food?
5786,Also wondering why it‚Äôs particularly relevant if they‚Äôve had a second dose or not.
5787,We know by now the vast majority of protection is given from a first dose and only a minor increase is given from the second dose.
5788,Much more important to look at first doses.
5789,Better to have 50% of the population vaccinated partially than 25% done fully.
5790,Shorthand brother
5791,"None, because they already have a ""voluntary export ban"" thanks to agreements with AstraZeneca (first 100m doses produced in Britain will stay in Britain)."
5792,Grapperhaus saying 'people are getting used to the curfew' was devilish.
5793,How do people put up with the lying?
5794,"Curfew, first thing to go!"
5795,Yeah right.
5796,"Lol, okay, so I take it you're saying people do call it bear."
5797,That's crazy.
5798,"Technically, I suppose, Texas is a modification of a Spanish word that was a modification of a Cado word."
5799,So I guess you've got a point.
5800,We just butcher everything.
5801,Don't get me started on Manchaca.

5822,What on earth is the point of having a nanny over Zoom?
5823,"The governor is out of line, completely ignoring the medical professional."
5824,He simply did that to distract people from people and the media on how so many Texans were without power or screwed over with a ridiculously high utility bill.
5825,But guess what?
5826,The government house is still closed for tours due to COVID!
5827,Lol he‚Äôs a selfish piece of shit
5828,I am quite overwhelmed.
5829,I live in the UK and all I see is how they keep coming up with BS to make the lockdown even further.
5830,I'm in fear that we won't ever be out of lockdown here as it will keep getting pushed back.
5831,It doesn't help when I read comment sections on websites such as daily mail as people say we will never get out of this as they have a new world agenda to push.
5832,I know it sounds like bs but in a way it feels somewhat true with the constant narrative they are pushing.
5833,"It was all about the vaccine at first and how we would return to normal but now they have a vaccine it's ""risk of 3rd wave and we can't be to sure, etc."""
5834,I'm just tired of this gloom and doom perspective over here tbh.
5835,Just needed somewhere to rant as I really don't know how much more I can take of living like this.
5836,It's depressing and we've been living like this basically for a year now.
5837,Anyone can help me with some positive insights?
5838,"They are in their third wave now, maybe because of variants spreading faster."
5839,Lockdown is not lifted as far as i know.
5840,A friends extended family is in Florida for the winter.
5841,"Even though they live in different condos,   one cousin got infected from going out to karaoke while drunk."
5842,"Prior to being diagnosed, he infected his sister and her husband, who are positive."
5843,Yesterday two more people in the family who live in a third apartment both woke up with symptoms and are waiting for results of their tests.
5844,People in Florida aren‚Äôt using any protection no doubt more people will get infected at Daytona too.
5845,A number of them may have been infected already so maybe they have some amount of immunity.
5846,What else is new.
5847,"&gt;#Report: Sturgis Motorcycle Rally May Have Caused Over 250,000 Coronavirus Cases
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*The report estimated that the rally generated about $12.2 billion in public health costs, which is based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case."
5848,"*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;THERE IS ""STRONG evidence"" that a motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that drew hundreds of thousands of people could have been a coronavirus superspreader event, according to a recent report."
5849,"&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Over 400,000 motorcycle enthusiasts gathered for the annual rally from Aug. 7-16, and it was reported that social distancing and mask wearing at some of the events was not observed."
5850,"&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The rally was officially linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across more than 10 states and at least one death."
5851,"But the study that relied on cell phone data to track movements estimates that over 250,000 reported coronavirus cases from August 2 to September 2 are due to the rally ‚Äì nearly 20% of the national cases during that time period, according to Andrew Friedson, one of the authors of the report."
5852,"&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Counties with the highest numbers of rally attendees had roughly a 7-12% increase in cases when compared to counties without rally goers, according to the report from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, an independent economic research group."

5855,I don‚Äôt know what made me do it but I regret everything
5856,"First of all, I don't care who a murderer is."
5857,And as far as COVID stats - they're being taken by a project that I personally built using a USA University source of data.
5858,"And being 'gullible' about China stats, well..."
5859,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but China is an authoritarian state that doesn't have a lot of international travel outside of HK."
5860,I am pretty confident that they would be able to minimize and contain this virus much more efficiently than almost any other country in the world.
5861,Do I think they have higher numbers than reported?
5862,"Probably, but who fucking cares?"
5863,"And I agree, we should all be able to choose what's best for us - but the reality is that there are a FUCKTON of stupid people out there that need guidance (aka government) - and without it, we'd ALL be fucked."
5864,So a vaccinated person needing a mask?
5865,WTF are you talking about?
5866,You're flinging out new arguments that I never mentioned and have no reason to address.
5867,"Moderna should be the same, but it looks promising."
5868,Meanwhile my country is registering only 70+ and will open up to 60+ next month.
5869,Sad that they have to write an article about why it is 'actually great'.
5870,All these vaccines are great!
5871,"There might be some advantages and disadvantages when people compare, but this should be avoided as it's like comparing apples and oranges."
5872,Anyone know people who just fight good news?
5873,I‚Äôve been seeing people who genuinely don‚Äôt think things are improving and that a spring break surge is on the way and that Texas is going to absolutely collapse since removing the mandate...like calm down
5874,The deaths were finally falling after the second wave... and now we are back to almost 400 a day.
5875,:(
5876,It will be interesting to see how this works out in the UK.
5877,Secondary school pupils (age 11-19) and staff are currently being tested twice a week with rapid tests.
5878,They went back on Monday.
5879,Moderna actually wants to increase from 5 to 10 by actually increasing the product.
5880,Now quite the same thing.

5889,"And send an assassin to kill Bolsonaro, please!"
5890,There was literally a thread here last night where the [OP was trying to brand all teachers as lazy pieces of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1msh5/los_angeles_teachers_union_tells_teachers_not_to/).
5891,"It's almost like teachers are not a monolith, and many of them want to get back to the classroom after being vaccinated."
5892,My mother hates Zoom teaching and is happy to go back as soon as she gets her second dose.
5893,Maryland's tiers are confusing and I can't be assed to figure out what tier I'm in so I'll get it when it goes to gen-pop.
5894,Or fly to Alaska.
5895,"Just to give an idea on how big impact the vaccination program can have: Norway averaged 7 deaths per day in the beginning of January, now they are at 1, just by vaccinating nursing home and 85+."
5896,I fully expect covid to be around for a long time but vaccination will turn covid into a whole different animal.
5897,"Some anecdotal advice that may help others in states that are still only giving the vaccine to specific groups of people:

I am currently living in TX in a major city where even the eligible are having a nearly impossible time getting their well deserved doses, (whether it be lack of availability or poor management, I am not sure) but I heard many people in my area who did not meet the requirements had gotten their first shots."
5898,"While Texas reopens dining to 100% capacity and removed the mask mandate, many of my coworkers and service industry friends are left looking for any way to get the vaccine so we can safely continue to work while being left to fend for our own health and safety."
5899,"With a little help from a friend, my boyfriend and I were able to schedule an appointment after days of checking back on various websites for availability."
5900,Some offered waiting lists and asked how you were eligible and to provide proof upon arrival once the appointment was secured.
5901,"However, once available appointments opened up (mind you, we drove 2 hours away just to get there, so this was not something we were able to get locally in our city) we were able to schedule and receive the first shot no questions asked, no proof necessary."
5902,"I advised my mother who lives in another state (CT) to do the same; just check back every website you can find that is offering appointments and wait for something to pop up, grab the first available appointment as soon as you can."
5903,"If there are available appointments, available vaccines, and no questions asked about whether or not you meet requirements upon scheduling, I don't see why they would waste their time refusing you service when that vaccine could potentially go unused for no reason."
5904,"Obviously some places will be more strict on following guidelines, only giving the vaccine to those who meet requirements, etc."
5905,But it is not completely impossible for others to find a way to get in line as well.
5906,"So, fellow service industry, grocery store employees, ""essential"" workers who have been put on the front lines to keep our country running while making our ever stagnant minimum wages, don't stop *looking* for an appointment; at least there is a chance of finding one that will allow you to get the shot regardless of age or health or profession."
5907,"An available vaccine is an available vaccine, and is best *used* rather than wasted because not enough eligible parties had been scheduled for those spots."
5908,Try CVS?
5909,They ask in their intake form if this is your second shot.
5910,"Asians, Africans, and Oceanians fought the virus."
5911,North Americans South Americans and Europeans fought each other.
5912,So stay at home.
5913,No ones forcing you to attend these events.
5914,Let adults make their own decisions.
5915,Tway1998 isn't a reliable source either apparently...
5916,"Yup, and sorry ‚Äúexperts‚Äù i‚Äôm not shutting down my life and going back to this nightmare of masks and restrictions for 3 months+ every year."
5917,"Sorry, but it won‚Äôt happen and if you don‚Äôt like it well then cry about it."
5918,My uk nhs record shows I have had shots and when they were done and which type they were and its available on my phone with a secure login.
5919,In theory we already HAVE an electronic covid passport.
5920,"The question isn't whether masks are effective, it's whether mask *mandates* are effective."
5921,States with strict mandates are doing basically the same as states with little/no mask enforcement.
5922,It‚Äôs like comparing drinking half a cup of bleach with a full cup.
5923,Bleach is bleach.
5924,Covid is covid
5925,I had it offered a while back....bit more than a month....due to my apparent essential worker status.

6012,"It won't be compulsory nationwide, but I could see high schools requiring it the way they do already with vaccines for the measles (or it being added to the slate of vaccinations that all doctors recommend at certain ages)

I could also see it being made mandatory if you work in a hospital, nursing home, or any other job where you interact closely with the elderly and immunocompromised on a regular basis."

6026,Sturgeon is actively harming her country with these ridiculous guidelines.
6027,Perhaps because the thread begins with the words ‚ÄúThe combination of COVID and Trump‚Äù?
6028,It may be simply the advantage of lower population working there.
6029,"The logistics of sending, dispensing, and injecting 500K doses rather than ten million is likely significantly easier."

6090,Is anyone wearing a mask because of an unenforced mandate?
6091,"And when people talk about how people will still wear masks, that‚Äôs fine."
6092,That basically proves we don‚Äôt need statewide mandates.
6093,It‚Äôs not like Florida isn‚Äôt fine right now.
6094,I'm sure Abbott agrees with that considering he lives there.
6095,"He just can't say anything about it else absolutely no one will call him out on his hypocrisy, nonsense, and complete disregard for his constituency."
6096,Don‚Äôt really understand the point you are trying to make here.
6097,"Taking the US for example, Do you think there would be a more rigid response of a foreign state or terrorist group were executing 1-3000 people a day?"
6098,"Who are those assholes to say their right to congregate or shop without a mask is more important than the lives of elderly, or those at risk?"
6099,"Or you know, maybe realizing that viruses can and do mutate, and every regulation that is relaxed puts us at more risk of a new strain that wipes out all of our vaccine progress?"
6100,"The UK and South Africa strain already merged, so there‚Äôs that, and it‚Äôs believed to become the dominant strain, given its more contagious and more vaccine resistant (the vaccines are still effective just less so) 

So yeah, people that are only thinking of themselves and can‚Äôt handle a little personal sacrifice to save lives are assholes."
6101,"The economic piece is much more complex, and I won‚Äôt claim to have the answers for that, but I do know the US had the means and the resources to protect people, keep them from being homeless, and save businesses and did a half ass job of it, so we now have millions more in poverty as a result."
6102,"The risk of dying of a virus in summer 2021 is likely lower than it has been for thousands of years in the past, and certainly lower than it will be for the coming decades."
6103,And yet I am selfish.

6109,That's good some of the smaller states are getting there.
6110,"Honestly, I have no problem with those states getting it done quickly since that is definitely one of the benefits of living in a more ruralized state - fewer people."
6111,"The flip side being that there's also less medical resources, so it's fair enough to consider them priority."
6112,"I'm just aware that the states with huge urban centers are at at the highest risk for next wave infections, so my feeling is that those should have some prioritization simply for likelihood of disease spread."
6113,"They've characterized it as multiple waves in the Northeast, but in all honesty, it's been more like one continuous wave that's ebbed and flowed in size and breadth."
6114,"If you have a BMI of 30, which is most adult Oklahomans, you're eligible."

6117,"Frontline is done, but I qualify for the 2B requirement (in progress now) for health conditions and occupation."
6118,I have been told by all application sites that I don‚Äôt qualify because they are focusing on over the age of 65 people for now.

6129,"As far as I know, the plan where I live is to open it up to everyone once they're done with 65+, essential workers, and those with preexisting conditions."
6130,"And I think your timeline is probably right, based on how fast vaccine production is ramping up."
6131,"That is 1.5 people per state, per second."
6132,The average state has over 350 Walgreens and CVS stores.
6133,"(There are ~19,000 total in the US)."
6134,"If each of these stores vaccinates 2 people every 5 minutes, that would come out to 2 people per state, per second, which is more than what we need."
6135,"Now, that rate is a little high (but given that this is literally our highest national priority, could be achievable),  but it doesn't count any of the other pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics."
6136,"There is absolutely no reason that this should not be achievable, and we need to continue hold the government's feet to the fire to make sure it happens (though the trend right now looks good)."
6137,Don't know how you got that I don't care about the health of society and others because I said carrying a card is archaic.
6138,Everything is moving to digital.
6139,"You are going to have to have a vaccination passport, is that going to be on paper too?"
6140,"Many venues, sporting events, and mass gatherings are going to require proof of vaccination."
6141,Is everyone going to show a paper card?
6142,All of this is going to be in a CR code that is scanned and linked together.
6143,This was just a rushed way to show proof of vaccination.

6300,*
6301,Deaths lag by a lot and the number is going down slowly.
6302,Get it in every retail pharmacy and clinic and doctors office and forget about mass vax
6303,"Being further north, they probably got Starlink early."
6304,"A year during a pandemic, with insane unemployment, gyms closed, harder to get a dr appointment for any help, etc."
6305,"wouldn‚Äôt exactly be the easiest year to lose weight, would it?"
6306,That‚Äôs not even considering people who are overweight d/t thyroids issues and whatnot.
6307,I‚Äôm not obese and already vaccinated but what a ridiculous sentiment hahaha
6308,The problem is the non standardized system.
6309,You lock down an appointment 30 mins away a week from now.
6310,Then all of a sudden you find an appointment 5 minutes away tomorrow.
6311,The guy at Walmart told me even if the person calls and cancels their slot the appointment doesn‚Äôt go back I to the system
6312,https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article249830218.html
6313,Better than the 1 in 3 it was just a month ago.
6314,Seems people are becoming more accepting as time goes on which makes sense
6315,It‚Äôs our case count from the day before....
6316,"Joe claims he‚Äôs very liberal, but thinks all of Texas operates the same."
6317,"And other comedians played a part in convincing him to move there, and he likes the city."
6318,"I don‚Äôt think the way the city stands politically was much on his mind, just more that he‚Äôs in Texas."
6319,Exactly.
6320,"Nobody is doing single doses of anything but Jansen, until that becomes a two dose."
6321,About 23 million first doses and 1.2 million second doses done in the U.K. so far.
6322,üòÇüòÇ
6323,I had the first Moderna shot 2 weeks ago.
6324,Will get my second in 2 weeks.
6325,I felt SLIGHT pain in my arm and nothing else.
6326,"I know people say the 2nd is worse, so I'm prepared for it."
6327,But I did the same for the first shot that I did for the flu shots: relax my arm so it's practically limp when I get the shot;  down an entire large bottle of Gatorade once I'm out; drink 6 bottles of water before bed; pee a ton.
6328,There are plenty of people still social distancing from what I understand.
6329,"Also, a lot of the transmission is probably happening with people who visit and go back to wherever they came from."
6330,"They keep saying more vaccines coming, and more vaccines seem to come... I‚Äôm not sure what your point is."
6331,The data hardly ever speaks for itself.
6332,Data without context is meaningless.
6333,"In this case, Texas was shut down for a few weeks due to a storm, which likely decreased cases/decreased testing."
6334,"The increase in cases now could be due to increased testing after the state repoened, or the fact that it decreased more than it otherwise would have during the storm, OR potentially due to decreased mask wearing (although the new mask rules only went into place today)."
6335,My company has very little in the way of essential workers but they are allowing us to take a half day paid to get the vaccine as well as reimbursements if needed.
6336,It think it is what all companies should consider in order to make it an easier option to get more shots in arms.
6337,It‚Äôll catch up
6338,Had to be the Pfizer.
6339,There was 0 natural immunity or vaccines back then
6340,The supply has already outpaced our ability by a very large margin.
6341,Helps when your entire state population fits into Denver I suppose.
6342,"Hey, could also take it as a challenge.. if you're at a 23-24 BMI, take it as a binge challenge to get past that magic 25!"
6343,Not lying then.
6344,"Maybe, and that's a point to consider, except I think the outdoor/mask combo is probably 95% of the success factor."
6345,I think V stands for Vodka.
6346,The idea that rural areas have less interaction is pretty inaccurate.
6347,Remote Alaskan villages of 200+ are very very communal.
6348,"They have to rely on each other to survive during the winter, so when a single case gets into one of these remote towns, it can quickly spread to EVERYONE inside of it."
6349,Getting the villages and remote groups vaccinated has been a key priority of many of the Native Corporations.
6350,Absolutely.
6351,And we mitigate risk as well...
6352,Unless your point is that you think we shouldn‚Äôt have traffic laws.
6353,Is that what you‚Äôre getting at?
6354,"Fuck traffic laws, fuck the FDA, fuck laws in general?"
6355,Life involves risk... We can‚Äôt tell you if your food has poison in it or if this pill kills 10% of people who use it.
6356,"Life involves risk... I‚Äôm sorry that man shot you, but we don‚Äôt want to infringe on his freedom to shoot a gun, you should be careful and mindful when you leave your house."
6357,I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre a troll or a special kind of stupid.
6358,"Yeah, good point."
6359,I‚Äôll not be an asshole and stay honest though.
6360,Maybe I can get one of these ‚Äúleftover‚Äù shots people are talking about...
6361,It's been posted all over the place.
6362,Supply is increasing weekly.
6363,"That might be true, but Europe still has a huge lead."
6364,[https://www.vaccineseurope.eu/about-us/the-eu-vaccine-industry-in-figures/](https://www.vaccineseurope.eu/about-us/the-eu-vaccine-industry-in-figures/)
6365,The mRNA technology is going to be a game changer.
6366,Europe has some of the top companies in the field and a complete supply chain.
6367,"Moreover, since these vaccines are synthesized they can be industrially scaled up and there is less of an incentive to off-shore production to low-wage countries in Asia."
6368,"For everyone here concerned about life not returning to normal, I hope my experiences today can give you some hope."
6369,"I got go out to eat at Whataburger (for those not from Texas and the South, it‚Äôs a very highly respected fast food restaurant here) and there was a ‚Äúmasks only encouraged‚Äù sign on the doors."
6370,Got to walk in no mask and enjoy my meal.
6371,On top of that the Texas Rangers are having 100% capacity for opening day.
6372,Stay strong everyone.
6373,The end is near or extremely close.
6374,Life is coming back!

6382,"It doesn't matter what contracts were violated, the EU said they wouldn't block vaccines to other countries and then they did that."
6383,"Astrazeneca is not an EU state company, it's not the EUs place to determine where every single vial they produce goes, especially when they've told the world they would not do that."
6384,"Other countries like the UK didnt ban exports, they just sign contracts with all the local producers stating first preference."
6385,It's a export ban via a back door.
6386,Pfizer isn‚Äôt on time AT ALL.
6387,They just had the decency / had enough logistics expertise to figure it out and give some heads up about lower-than-promised deliveries (a few weeks upfront).
6388,Now they promise to make it up starting April onwards.
6389,We‚Äôll see how it goes.
6390,"But no, not a single vaccine (I‚Äôm following Pfizer, moderna, AstraZeneca) is being supplied in quantities they were planned/promised in."
6391,"Ugh, Georgian here and seriously everyone I know qualifies to recieve it now because they are all obese."
6392,I hope it moves quickly.
6393,"I, like everyone I am sure, am so sick of being at home."
6394,thats not really the same thing is it though?
6395,They are blocking shipments outside of the country because AZ hasn't meant their delivery timelines that they are obligated to.
6396,Phizer was meeting all their deadlines in the US and are now delivering faster.
6397,SO.. Its not the same.
6398,The US blocked the vaccines from leaving the US even though the contractual obligations are being met.
6399,Walgreens puts out new appointments at 6am every day if you have access to them.
6400,"yes, if 300 years ago 15% of babies died at birth and now it is 0.3%

isnt that a great indicator?"
6401,Vaccines from COVAX represent less than 1% of vaccines needed to inoculate every Canadian.
6402,No vaccines will be shared until every Canadian is inoculated.
6403,"You can pretend that Canada is benevolent or generous or something, but Canada's Minister of Procurement Anand very clearly stated that Canada will not share *any vaccines until all Canadians are inoculated*."
6404,So congrats on actually doing the exact thing Canadians are accusing the US of doing.
6405,I am not sure we can say there is still no supply issue.
6406,I do think that it is time to start getting more tier of folks open.
6407,"As far as I know (state hasn‚Äôt given good guidance) those people will only be eligible to get a vax from a doctor, and not go to any public site."
6408,So that is really limiting to that tier.
6409,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they said 50-64 can start on Monday too.
6410,This weeks numbers are just unacceptable based on how many doses we‚Äôve gotten.
6411,"Some are satisfied, there are inconsistencies and irregularities that people are not happy about."
6412,Ok?
6413,Retail pharmacies are already doing it all over the place.
6414,Let‚Äôs get it in every retail pharmacy.
6415,I can walk to like 7 retail pharmacies and I live in Alaska.
6416,First shot moderna I was fine.
6417,"Had my second shot in the morning, and that night I was feverish and chills trying to go to sleep and I woke up at 5am with bad head and body aches."
6418,"Mostly gone after 24-30 hours, just some light arm pain"
6419,In regards to the vaccine being optimistic has paid off.
6420,"I don't know how many times on here you heard ""the vaccine is at least 2 years away""."
6421,"Followed by ""well okay, yeah the vaccine is available...but I won't be able to get it until August at the earliest"" or ""my state (fill in state name here, I've heard every single one of them) it won't be available until Fall""."
6422,"Currently it's ""okay but I still won't get it until June""."
6423,Of course next month when there is no excuse because everyone will be able to get it if they really want it.
6424,"Well, I would hope they could get through their dozens of citizens faster than the rest of the country."
6425,"https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization

I use the HHS website directly."
6426,I‚Äôve been using it for a few months.
6427,Should have never done priority groups to begin with
6428,"We were also told that B.1.1.7 was much more contagious and would lead to a new spike in cases, which appears to have been [complete bunk](https://twitter.com/phl43/status/1369093371835322368)."
6429,I'm taking these variant fears very skeptically from now on.
6430,My grandmother has the vaccine too but she is terrified of anyone seeing her because not only is she worried about visitors getting sick she‚Äôs worried about getting sick because of the variants.
6431,"It‚Äôs getting extremely frustrating, she clearly wants to see and talk to people but she‚Äôs been seriously scared stiff."
6432,All that stress is not doing her any good.
6433,Coincidentally the selling at cost price of the AZ vaccine ends some time in july...
6434,I doubt they would have exaggerated so badly.
6435,I keep looking for updates and not seeing anything.
6436,It's far along enough in March where they are going to know what they can do by end of March.
6437,Why shouldn't they ignore it?
6438,"As I see it, there are some eight billion people in the world and not enough vaccines."
6439,Does it really matter who gets which one?
6440,"Unless the issue caused stocked vaccines to spoil or prevented the company from investments into more production facilities, it shouldn't matter whether the U.S. bought it or some other country did or Russia just used it all domestically."
6441,% of population 65+ with at least one dose is at 61.2% in US.
6442,"Once that gets to around 80+, this should be over on a national scale."
6443,you're right.
6444,I looked quickly and slipped a decimal.
6445,Queue Michael Bolton office Space reference...
6446,Still seems like a huge stretch like you said.
6447,But this ‚Äúde facto ban‚Äù you keep referring to only exists because the EU didn‚Äôt properly plan or fund their own AstraZeneca plants in Europe.
6448,"The vaccine shortage is not caused by UK action, but EU *inaction*."
6449,Why should British people have to suffer for longer because of the EU‚Äôs incompetence?
6450,If the AstraZeneca vaccine had been a failure then the UK would be in exactly the same boat as Canada and other countries who don‚Äôt have their own manufacturing facilities.
6451,Uhhhh what?
6452,Can someone give me some insight here?
6453,Why would any country take 7-15 months to get to normality?
6454,Is Italy that behind on the vaccines?
6455,Covax is about pooling money to buy/fund vaccines for poorer countries.
6456,As part of that they can access 20% of the vaccine that their money bought .
6457,They have put in over 500 million into the pool and are pulling the vaccines they are alloted to under the contracts.
6458,.
6459,They are not donating vaccines to covax.
6460,Covax is using its purchasing power to buy the vaccines and pooling them.. Canada is pulling the vaccines the are allowed to while still effectively providing  400 million in total fund for covax to buy vaccines for other countries.
6461,we have 300 millions vaccines purchased.
6462,The one we don't use will be sent/donated to other countries.
6463,"This is good to see, but in Georgia vaccines are expiring everyday."
6464,"Publix and Kroger pharmacists are walking around the stores every evening to find people to take the vaccine, no restrictions."
6465,"If you want the vaccine now, its easy to call around and see if they have a list for cancellations."
6466,"This isn't keeping others from getting, or line cutting, because these doses will be thrown away."
6467,This is especially true in rural stores.
6468,you're right.
6469,"It is 9M per week, I fixed it."
6470,"Still, huuuuge gap."
6471,As long as the vaccine gets in people's arms who cares?
6472,I thought J&amp;J was having manufacturing trouble.
6473,&gt;I think mask wearing will be more common in the US than it was pre-Covid.
6474,"Which could be ""I've seen one person in the last year with a mask on"" level for the bulk of the country."

6480,Higher than Oklahoma?
6481,Wow
6482,My bad
6483,"My dad got his vaccine yesterday and my mom today, I'm so happy I literally cried, where I live they were giving out the Sinovac vaccine (which after doing my research i found out it's 100% efective against deaths and hospitalization and the 50% was because the study only used healthcare workers directly working with covid and not average people so I'm okay with them getting them and I feel like the best vaccine is the one that reaches your arm), they told them barely anyone is getting vaccinated there and they have tons of extra doses, my country is full of covid deniers and anti vaxers so that sucks tho."
6484,"I hope everyone's family members who are over 60 years old are already vaccinated and if not I hope they get it soon, I get being scared for them all the time."
6485,I'm only 25 so who knows when I'll be able to get it but I'm not too worried about myself and I'm so happy I can feel a little more relieved now.
6486,I work in IT for an entertainment company.

6496,"Remember, for a majority of people, COVID is *already there*‚Äîit might feel like a cold if they have any symptoms at all."
6497,&gt;Not saying you arent right but do you have any scientific sources for that opinion because I would love if that was a fact.
6498,This is really just how viruses work.
6499,"Basically, they spread more easily and become less deadly."
6500,"That's because a virus that kills its host can't reproduce, so it dies off."
6501,"Add in immunity acquired either through infection or vaccine, and the effects are even more muted."
6502,This is what a lot of the reporting seems to be missing either through deliberate fearmongering for clicks or simple ingnorance.
6503,COVID isn't going to suddenly mutate into some kind of airborne Ebola/AIDS hybrid.
6504,That's just not what viruses do.
6505,Retail pharmacies have the space to do one person at a time.
6506,Then they have to observe for 15 minutes in case of a bad reaction.
6507,They did mass vaccinations in my city and didn't have or check any requirements whatsoever although the state did have some.
6508,"I think they should have just done that everywhere; there have been too many vaccinations gone bad, and way too many to give out to just make appointments at doctors' offices in many places."
6509,IDK why more medium to large cities haven't done mass ones but it worked really well here.
6510,Yeah it's Philly Fighting COVID.
6511,"Dude is like 21, 22 and I'm shocked that no one did any more digging into the company beforehand."
6512,"We basically put all our distribution efforts into that shitty ""company"" and they ran off with the vaccines they received."
6513,"My parents are from Cleveland, fortunately my mom works in medical so she got hers back in January, but my dad says he hes been having trouble scheduling it."

6521,It includes overweight as well.
6522,79% of Georgia's adult population is overweight or obese.
6523,"If they are going to cast such a wide net, just remove the net entirely."
6524,"As is typical, Kemp is just responding to pressure in the absolute worst way possible."
6525,"Rather than lower the age limit to 55+ and give it some time, or even do 45+, he just opens it up to pretty much everyone (fine) except for some arbitrary non-science based exclusions (not fine)."
6526,That you for helping the trial happen.
6527,"I believe it's because they're still doing trials on the vaccine's safety/efficacy for those under 16, so it's not FDA-approved for those people yet"
6528,SF requires you put on a mask outdoors if you're passing someone within 6ft.
6529,Otherwise as far as I can tell it's just recommended.
6530,Easier said than done.
6531,Either way people make decisions and get rewarded or punished.
6532,"For the sake of everyone who isnt doing dumb shit like a motorcycle rally, i hope everything turns out fine."
6533,"the thing is, the trials weren't run head-to-head, and the J&amp;J was run through its trial after there were many more cases and variant circulating."
6534,it is possible that the J&amp;J is actually better.
6535,"a friend of mine used to work in vaccine development at Pfizer and they want the J&amp;J, if that means anything."
6536,Had a choice between Moderna and J&amp;J but actually opted for J&amp;J.
6537,"They had a bit more rigorous data on the variants of concern, and I'm young and healthy so the lower efficacy, if it does end up remaining a single dose, isn't that much of a concern for me."
6538,"I'm in healthcare, so I'm in the first phases."
6539,It will absolutely happen in most European countries.
6540,"When numbers were low, most things were open in Europe - heck even Disneyland was open."
6541,"Last year infections started increasing in September again, but around September absolutely everyone that wants to be vaccinated will have at least one shot (and probably 2 shots too) so there will be a great level of immunity in the population."

6556,That's my theory.
6557,How the vaccinations going in france?
6558,"Oh I agree that there's a definite downside to the situation, but a bump now means the end comes faster."
6559,"I‚Äôm confident, but I‚Äôm wondering why we were so close to 3 million a day but then it plummeted to less then 2 million and now we‚Äôre only back up to 2 million"
6560,we know from Brazil that people can and do still get covid in high numbers after having it once.
6561,"the real thing does not create as strong of an immune response as the vaccines, in most people."
6562,Get your place in line and hunker down until you get it.
6563,So you think European governments will just let Covid run its course?
6564,That won't happen any time soon.

6570,üòÇüòÇüòÇ I totally get you now hahaha.
6571,You should definitely look forward to it.
6572,It's a great vaccine and they're conducting that 2 dose trial for a reason.

6574,Awww that's so great hahaha so happy for you.
6575,Vaccine jealousy is a real thing haha.
6576,Are you in a priority group perhaps?
6577,Maybe older?
6578,Not sure where you're at in terms of vaccination priorities right now in the US.

6580,I'm glad they're expanding eligibility.
6581,"The criteria, however, is garbage."
6582,"It's basically now an unadulterated free for all.. except for the 15% of the population that is considered ""low risk"" (regardless of age)."
6583,79% of Georgia's population alone is overweight.
6584,Add in another 5% that has at least one of the other conditions listed.
6585,That's ~85% of the population eligible.
6586,"What's the point of restricting at that point, other than punishing adults who take care of their health?"
6587,"Especially when a ""low risk"" (by the definition) 50 year is old still much higher risk than a ""high risk"" 25 year old."
6588,"\- Signed one of the 15% of the ""low risk"" adults in Georgia per the criteria provided."
6589,"Once 60+ and other risk groups are vaccinated, hospitalization numbers will plummet too."
6590,Within a couple of months these groups should be vaccinated.
6591,"The worst of the pandemic in most countries is behind us, and as vaccination productions around the world gradually accelerate, things will turn for the better quickly rather than slowly."
6592,"I can't say whether or not I've ever asymptomatically infected someone with the flu, but I exercise common sense precautions to make sure I am doing everything I can possibly be doing to not infect someone with the flu."
6593,"Now, COVID is (a) much deadlier than the flu, and (b) much more likely to spread asymptomatically."
6594,This is pretty settled science by now.
6595,"So, I am much more likely to accidentally infect someone with COVID than I am to infect someone with the flu."
6596,The only reasonable risk-mitigation strategy here is avoiding superspreader events altogether.
6597,"And why is this the ""social end"" of the pandemic?"
6598,"Only about 10% of the population is vaccinated, we're nowhere near herd immunity."
6599,"What happened to mark this ""social end""?"
6600,The fact that it's spring and everyone wants to go out and party?
6601,"I'd expect this kind of reasoning from a toddler, not a grownup."
6602,"it's not necessarily lower efficacy, though."
6603,the different timelines of the studies meant that J&amp;J had a more difficult trial.
6604,"J&amp;J, being rotavirus, might end up being better against variants in the medium-term."
6605,my friend who retired from Pfizer (doing vaccine development) wants the J&amp;J.
6606,"Fuck her and the entire government, their failure to handle the vaccination rollout is criminal and they all should be held accountable"
6607,13% of the 18+ demographic which is what we really should be looking at.
6608,"Ah, so I'm in one of the states."
6609,"Oddly enough, though, my closest target is across the street from a mass vaccination center, so not going to make a dent on distance around here, unfortunately."
6610,Yes but sadly there is a lot of this bullshit going around.
6611,"Here in Finland they are planning for a curfew and when asked about it, the PM just said that this will go on for years because of ""vaccine-resistant virus""."
6612,Where can I find us hospitalization totals now that the covid project is over?
6613,Excuse me what?
6614,You think im into conspiracy by my comment?
6615,"LOL

Ofc the US is going to sell them, most countries are desperate to contain the pandemic, and the US will use this as a business."
6616,You think countries can just buy directly from J&amp;J?
6617,They will struggle with the demand of rich countries alone.
6618,"I actually had a laugh on how oblivious you are on the situation, reworking the vaccines into 5g chips (good one)"

6626,I owed in 2019 so I didn't get anything so I get the paper check.
6627,I already filed 2020 but still haven't got my return this year so who the hell knows right now for me.
6628,Also both the prior two took me forever to get the damn check in the mail.
6629,am i the only one who doesnt like that word.
6630,a jab is a punch.
6631,kind of a negative word to use lol
6632,"Likely because CA has started sending doses to priority counties/zipcodes, leaving many other counties scrambling to cancel appointments even for second doses as the supply chain has dried up."
6633,"Meanwhile, other states are opening to 55+."
6634,Totally bizarre.
6635,Congrats!!!!
6636,How did you find out about that surplus?
6637,Trying to get lucky myself lol

6640,"Good, all states next."
6641,Sick and tired of waiting on old people outside of care homes who don't go anywhere anyway taking first priority.
6642,The people who are out and about and actually participating in society should be protected first.
6643,"In PA, no records required."
6644,Not necessarily because we still have no idea of longterm effects in previously healthy populations.
6645,"We know a significant number of people are struggling with ""long covid""."
6646,It's not without its downsides.
6647,"It is still ideal to not get sick in the 1st place, especially when so close to a vaccine."
6648,"Aka, wear masks, keep up social distancing measures, maybe reduce unnecessary trips out in light of a more infectious variant."
6649,Most of us are only looking at 2 to 3 more months until a vaccine is accessible.
6650,"As my insurance has now ceased to waive covid related fees any longer, it has once again become too expensive for me to get sick, and I'd rather save my paid time off for the potential of an actual vacation this summer or fall."
6651,I will probably try to get it now.
6652,I'm not young and half at least two of those conditions so I qualify.
6653,"In my country, Canada the timeline for vaccinations was to have everyone who wants one vaccinated by September."
6654,"This only rested on using numbers from approved vaccines at the time, Pfizer and Moderna."
6655,So they made a prediction and formulated a timeline based on available data at the time.
6656,"Since then, the timeline has been moved up a lot based on other vaccine approvals, and will continue to be moved up after even more approvals."
6657,"It looks like this prediction in this article was only made using hard data available at this time, like the Canadian governments timeline only being based on two approved vaccines"
6658,Meanwhile California has 4 million doses on shelves and is restricting 40% of the doses for only people in a small set of zip codes and 10% for teachers.
6659,"Yay equity, let‚Äôs all collectively suffer!"
6660,You‚Äôre awesome.
6661,Ty.
6662,And they are breaking their literal asses to correct that horrific situation and have been for over a month.
6663,It‚Äôs improving every day.
6664,Hang in a little bit longer.
6665,Texas is fine.
6666,"They mostly just hurt themselves with their stupidity, unless you were born with with non-reflective skin."
6667,"If you have more than a slight hue it‚Äôs not a great place to be, but still better than Alabama and the rest of the South."
6668,It really will be.

6670,From today: [Health Ministry said planning more easing of restrictions as pandemic ebbs](https://www.timesofisrael.com/health-ministry-said-planning-more-easing-of-restrictions-as-pandemic-ebbs/)
6671,What trial?
6672,I [don't have](https://covidvax.org/covid19-vaccine/Janssen/Ad26-alone-or-with-MVA-boost-Janssen-Johnson-Johnson-Beth-Israel-Deaconess-Medical-Center-Harvard-Me) actual phase 3 study data from Janssen...
6673,"I have data [from the FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine), though:

&gt; There were 66 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination and 193 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group during this time period."
6674,"Starting 14 days after vaccination, there were 14 severe/critical cases in the vaccinated group versus 60 in the placebo group, and starting 28 days after vaccination, there were 5 severe/critical in the vaccine group versus 34 cases in the placebo group."
6675,"5 is more than ""not a single""... that's 5 out of 66, so 7.5%."
6676,&gt;Please don‚Äôt call your local pharmacy.
6677,Please use the scheduling tools online or via vaccine hotline.
6678,Do all places have that?
6679,I have a friend that got hers from a waiting list at walgreens but she had to call to get on it as she couldn't find a way to do it online.
6680,And I don't think all walgreens do it.
6681,Yea.
6682,We‚Äôre currently number 2 in COVID cases in America and our Governor decides to open back up.
6683,It‚Äôs pretty much to get on people‚Äôs good side after the winter storm power outage and hope it distracts them from that.
6684,But it‚Äôll probably see a rise in cases and create a new disaster we have to deal with.
6685,"Also, our Lt Governor said last year *the elderly were willing to die of COVID to save the economy*."
6686,The ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù and ‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù Republicans seem so willing to kill people: https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-says-senior-citizens-willing-to-die-to-save-economy-for-grandkids

6689,Call your county health department.
6690,This worked for me.
6691,"Dude, they‚Äôre fucking pumping them out."
6692,"2 of the vaccines are being made here in Michigan, I believe around the clock but I‚Äôm not positive."
6693,"It was a giant logjam here for shots, but it broke open this weekend and they‚Äôre absolutely humming right now."
6694,I totally understand the frustration and I‚Äôm not putting you down.
6695,I believe it‚Äôs about to break open in a lot more places.
6696,"Literally on Friday I had no hope of shots, but four days later I‚Äôve received the first dose, scheduled the second and have been turning down daily notifications from other places I signed up for."
6697,My group wasn‚Äôt due to start until 3/22.
6698,There is hope.
6699,Interesting.
6700,This is a 2% fatality rate of infected (and vaccinated) people.
6701,And a 9% hospitalization rate.
6702,And an asymptomatic rate of 81%.
6703,Are you in the US?
6704,"If so, J&amp;J is now available/approved and is one shot."
6705,I should clarify im talking about the delivery of 140 million delivered in 5 weeks.
6706,Not the overall doses administered
6707,"You are forgetting that last time a city in texas tried to set a mandate for the pandemic, the same state came after them because health mandates are only allowed to be set at the state level."
6708,So which one is it?
6709,I don‚Äôt care which vaccine I get.
6710,Best of luck.
6711,It‚Äôll be all over very soon!
6712,I‚Äôm in the Midwest and I get my first dose on Friday.
6713,I‚Äôm saying the OP has clearly made up his mind.
6714,I‚Äôm not sure where you got the rest of that from.
6715,You should also mention that Florida on average is way older than California.
6716,Depends on your state.
6717,Kentucky has been doing great so far- headed down to 2a soon
6718,"I've always heard Austin is a really cool city, its only flaw is that it is surrounded by Texas."
6719,That's really good to know.
6720,I'm surprised I haven't heard that before.
6721,Oh that's pretty reassuring!
6722,Thank you for the tips!
6723,Definitely going to hydrate up.
6724,"Remember that more doses are available, but there‚Äôs only so many hands to inoculate people at certain time periods to avoid over crowding."
6725,Which is why pharmacies in the private sector are receiving vaccines.
6726,"&gt;Wow, the mask worshipping mob

Aka, people who understand and respect experts, science, and most importantly, eachother."
6727,Feels good to be a better person than those who don't.
6728,I wonder if the restrictions on who can get it are slowing things down.
6729,"Even unintentionally, people who are eligible may not know they are."
6730,Anyone who gets within six feet knows I've set my phaser to cleanse.
6731,Nine feet if you're not wearing a mask.
6732,Because it seems like a great way to return to normal travel as quickly as possible?
6733,"Compared to everything else that international travel has traditionally involved, getting a vaccine is a small price to pay."
6734,Why is your entire profile devoted to this??
6735,It's actually really fucking alarming
6736,Joe Rogan is gonna fucking cry
6737,There are only two genders.
6738,That‚Äôs not an opinion.
6739,It‚Äôs science.
6740,It‚Äôs fact.
6741,Ontario.
6742,I don't know how much vaccines will help Brazil if the [President of Brazil thinks vaccines turn you into crocodiles](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20201218-brazil-s-bolsonaro-warns-virus-vaccine-can-turn-people-into-crocodiles).
6743,"I don‚Äôt know that risk is cumulative in the way you describe it, but of course the more social contacts you have the more likely you are to be exposed."
6744,"At the same time, having the virus and being infectious is essentially a 0 or 1 type of risk, you either are or you aren‚Äôt, thus any contact is potentially risky for you or the people you see."
6745,"Low-risk in the CDCs case refers to low-risk in the sense of patient outcome, afaik, not the chance of having been exposed to Covid."
6746,Might as well blame the administration for not letting the kids be there.
6747,It makes absolutely no sense to lift mask mandates either.
6748,The economy will run a lot smoother if people who are vulnerable or have vulnerable relatives actually feel safe leaving their house.
6749,Just did a cursory read of the actual executive order.
6750,Where does it state that cities cannot have a mask mandate?
6751,We‚Äôre going to have to corral these people soon.
6752,Can‚Äôt just allow them to kill off the human race because they‚Äôre unintelligent and believe in haints.
6753,It‚Äôs a non story story.
6754,Difference in effectiveness between Moderna and Pfizer is less than 1%.
6755,I would prefer the Pfizer but I'm scheduled to get Moderna in 2 days because I would have to wait another week to get Pfizer.

6761,What percentage of teachers are working in schools?
6762,they told me the recommended time for the second dose but did not arrange or schedule one.
6763,It wasn't at a standard pharmacy but a sort of pop-up clinic at an assisted living facility i occasionally volunteer at
6764,It doesn‚Äôt matter what any of us think a human life is worth.
6765,The government has already done the math and it‚Äôs about $10 million.

6770,The J&amp;J is one shot but it's only 66% effective.
6771,Moderna and Pfizer are 94% and 95% effective.
6772,If you can get it then it's much better to get the Moderna or Pfizer.
6773,"Also note the CDC advises that you are not considered fully vaccinated until after 2 weeks after the second shot, and there are still travel restrictions and you should still wear the mask and social distance when in public or around those who are not vaccinated."

6776, 40-60 year olds still have to get vaccinated.
6777,Which total over 70 million individuals.
6778,There‚Äôs around 20 million individuals for each 5 year age group up to 65.
6779,If the demand slows for that age group then of course they will accommodate younger individuals.

6799,[removed]
6800,California hasn't really enforced its restrictions.
6801,Outside of the Bay area and LA county the locals refused to enforce the restrictions.
6802,We have gyms and restaurants open for indoor dining for months all over here with no mask required.
6803,Nothing happens to them.
6804,What about the Chinese one?
6805,"No, an EUA would only be revoked if the treatment in question was proven to be not effective or somehow harmful safety wise."
6806,"In theory these vaccines can have an EUA forever, but in reality the phase 4 trials will end in a couple years, and the FDA will more than likely grant full approval, unless a better safer treatment becomes available"
6807,They're cutting the quarantine in half.
6808,That's the smart move at this point in time.
6809,If things go well with the 7 day quarantine I'm sure it will be cut back even further.
6810,remindme!

6813,It‚Äôs ridiculous.
6814,[removed]
6815,The best part of all of this is that Austin the state capitol so they dont have to go far to scream at each other.
6816,Does anyone smarter than me have any theories as to why vaccine administration hasn't exploded thus far in March the way we anticipated?
6817,We're now sitting on a 30 million difference between vaccines distributed vs. vaccines administered to citizens.
6818,Did we overestimate our capacity to administer?
6819,"Is 2 million or so per day the ceiling for what we're capable of, logistically?"
6820,We have AstraZeneca here with a similar situation.
6821,"Anyway, I know US people who'd be delighted to be vaccinated ""in 3 weeks""."
6822,lol
6823,"Yes, of course it's not actually 100%, I'm just repeating what the trial data said."
6824,The fact that it's close enough to 100% for not a single hospitalization to show up in the trial (or the trial for any other approved vaccines) is more than enough.
6825,Did you try your healthcare provider or your counties website?
6826,That‚Äôs where we found the most available appointments.
6827,Weekend data dump.
6828,"No worries, I said the wrong thing so I totally get the misunderstanding."
6829,I‚Äôm very much on the side of ‚Äúkeep the masks and save lives please‚Äù
6830,Oh!
6831,My apologies for misunderstanding.
6832,The entire last month in Texas has been crazy.
6833,Sorry to hear that but right now the only place J&amp;J is being distributed is within the US so my comment is with regards to there.
6834,"Does Texas have ""home rule""?"
6835,"In my state of IL, larger metro areas have ""home rule"" provisions that permit local management of things like, say, a pandemic, as long as it is not less restrictive than statewide management of things, which explains why where I live the regulations are stricter than the state, and businesses are getting fined for breaking them, yet about 50 miles away it's a completely different story."
6836,Distribution and ready for patients are likely different things.
6837,"Hospitals get them, then need to goto clinics, then appointments made, then administration."
6838,So there us generally a lag between administration and distribution
6839,I get my first dose on Friday!
6840,Can‚Äôt wait!
6841,!
6842,"Look, it's not ""100% against hospitalization and death""."
6843,This is a myth that was created by the fact the interim results of trials didn't *have* enough COVID cases in the vaccine arm (good!)
6844,to meaningfully determine the percentage that would end up in hospital or a grave.
6845,"Of course, they are still very effective, but making this kind of flawed argument isn't helping anyone, especially every time there is a new ""oh no, outbreak in a nursing home, including people who were vaccinated!"""
6846,headline (there was one just now).
6847,"If you make people think the vaccine is 100% effective against hospitalization and death, then they'll think it has stopped working."
6848,Not a great idea.
6849,"Let's take a *big* study, now that we have data from actual populations that have taken the vaccine... [The study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765) is from Israel, the country that has vaccinated the highest percentage of its population (mostly if not fully with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), and published in the New England Journal of Medicine:

&gt; In the follow-up period starting 7 days after the second dose, the vaccine effectiveness for documented infections, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, and severe disease was 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95), 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98), 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100), and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively."
6850,"The follow-up after 7 days from the second dose is considered the ""final"" one."
6851,"You can see that while those are good, high values, they are not 100%."
6852,"It means people who got the vaccine have died, and people have been hospitalized."
6853,"Seldom is anything ""100%""."
6854,"If the numbers for J&amp;J are different, that makes a difference."
6855,Most places don‚Äôt consider cigar smokers as smokers.
6856,"Sure, I could lie and say I qualify but that‚Äôs not how I roll."
6857,I‚Äôd gladly take an unused dose that had to be used or else destroyed.
6858,But I‚Äôm not about to jump ahead of those who actually qualify since it‚Äôs easier to hit for a ps5 than get an appointment in pa
6859,Umm so why are the case numbers so high today as compared to just 2 days ago?
6860,I don‚Äôt disagree.
6861,Considering no one died in the trials or were hospitalized - I wouldn‚Äôt call that markedly different.
6862,"J&amp;J created a product that is cheaper, easier to distribute, and is easier to store while maintaining the efficacy required by the FDA to be granted emergency approval."
6863,This is a huge win.

6875,Chicago is planning to use the other sport stadiums as mass vaccination sites in the future
6876,And yet every number we have so far points to Pfizer and Moderna having a superior vaccine design.
6877,"Remember, these are all blinded studies that compare efficacy to a control group - so the rates of COVID transfer in the community are already factored into the percentages."
6878,"New data can always emerge that changes our scientific understanding, but until that happens, there is substantial evidence in favor of the mRNA vaccines being more effective based on what we know so far."
6879,"All of the vaccines can serve a place in our vaccination program as long as we are supply constrained, and a single dose vaccine has advantages if it convinces some otherwise-hesitant people to opt for a vaccine."
6880,"But if your goal is to get the highest protection available, the mRNA vaccines are currently far and away your best bet."
6881,You‚Äôre delusional.
6882,When do we stop?
6883,"Sorry, I misspoke."
6884,I didn‚Äôt mean the governor.
6885,I meant Escott and the Austin City Council.
6886,I agree with everything you‚Äôve said.
6887,That‚Äôs not a good reason...
6888,"Plus near impossible to escape crappy jobs,"
6889,What Netanyahu ‚Äúmeant‚Äù by saying the pandemic was behind them was exactly nothing.
6890,"It‚Äôs just bullshit political posturing 

Truth is Israel has vaccinated only about 50% of its population with one dose and only about 30% with both doses."
6891,"The pandemic *will* be behind them, but not yet, and it‚Äôll be behind them much sooner than other countries"
6892,"I'm from Poland, its approved in EU."
6893,"It's similar to the J&amp;J one, but they recommend taking two doses."

6900,Should be noted that Austin is the state capital of Texas.
6901,Thats why.
6902,I felt absolutely nothing.
6903,"I even did a double take because I was like, did the nurse actually put the needle in my arm?"
6904,I felt ZERO.
6905,And I have never gotten any type of shot where I felt nothing.
6906,I had Moderna too.
6907,[removed]
6908,Ah.
6909,That explains it.
6910,Never heard of such a thing
6911,"I mean the study already controls for differences in age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, location and date of infection."
6912,I can't think of too many reasons that these results wouldn't be applicable elsewhere.
6913,"I‚Äôm a libertarian, so there‚Äôs no hypocrisy here."
6914,The U.S. is just flexing on the rest of the world at this point
6915,"lol, seriously, this 95 year old woman is almost certainly already dead (or close to it) if she didn't have the vaccine."
6916,It would be good to have an effective treatment as well as a vaccine.
6917,Oh totally agreed about needing to look outside your county.
6918,"My GF and I have been able to secure appointments for people in our life who need them and are eligible, but we've had to search outside of our immediate area."
6919,"Conversely, I know family who live in a rural area and they were able to go schedule one right away."
6920,"I had to tell them they were eligible though, they didn't realize they were but my state's guidelines clearly defines ""food and agriculture"" and they're farmers."
6921,He wasn't asking about that.
6922,Bickering between political factions will prevent the US from finding effective solutions to nuanced problems probably for the rest of our lives.
6923,I am getting mine today and have a lot of driving to do tomorrow.
6924,Should I make alternative plans or was it bearable?
6925,I‚Äôm not denying it at all.
6926,Covid is very real.
6927,Three percent death rate is concerning.
6928,But that rate is incredibly skewed.
6929,"If you‚Äôre under the age of 50 and healthy, you‚Äôre very very likely to live."
6930,"So no, it‚Äôs not as dangerous as the fear mongers claim."
6931,"Now that a large percentage of elderly have been vaccinated, if youre young you really should be going about life as normal and be careful around elderly if you plan on seeing them."
6932,The US is much more authoritarian than China and it didn't work
6933,"Death is only so much of it, many people are having long term health effects 6 months After having it , even if not hospitalized."
6934,I wonder if this will lead to J&amp;J recipients rushing to get in line for one of the other options.
6935,"Can't admit vaccinated people can do what they want just yet for the ""good of society' or whatever

lies are good I guess"
6936,Mandate was pointless anyway - here in VA we have one and nobody listens because its not being enforced..as in no punishment against those that don't wear them.
6937,Till you start making examples its a pointless situation!
6938,Thanks.
6939,I'm actually immunocompromised/immunosuppressed and participating in a study to try and find out if one vaccine works better than another with different drugs and conditions.
6940,"Doctors are giving the best advice they can, but right now they don't have data to inform this."
6941,"(Safety data exists, the study is looking at efficacy across vaccines while on a variety of immunosuppressing medications)."
6942,Alaska : Already done
6943,Old people collapse from small fevers and dehydration.
6944,J&amp;J has been linked to a 74% decrease in asymptomatic transmission.
6945,"Can't link the source (tried, automod deleted it because it was a wedmd article talking about FDA documents), but easily google-able."
6946,"At least for me, that's pretty damn good."
6947,"Got my J&amp;J an hour ago, and in 4 weeks im considering myself done (though good with masking up in public if that's still recommended by the state)."
6948,"Fuck no, we have the best healthcare in the world, give it to the counties who need it most and then to the countries who need it least."
6949,People are people no matter what country they live in.
6950,Let's work together instead of hoarding it for ourselves.
6951,You probably shouldnt get the vaccine then...sounds like there's no point to it.
6952,/s
6953,"I can't find any link showing he said that, can you provide a source so I can read it?"
6954,For us it was a combination.
6955,"Some folks we just hand-held... or texted them ""CVS has an appt here on Thursday at noon, go to the website now!"""
6956,Others we actually gathered all their info and did it for them.
6957,Depended on the individual and how capable or motivated they were.
6958,"Some of the folks in my circle were super-motivated, others needed more ""determination"" injected into them by our constant pushing."
6959,:)
6960,"Since you can‚Äôt read...

‚ÄúOfficials at Focused Care at Brenham said Tuesday that nine of the 17 residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 were fully vaccinated, while the remaining eight had received only the first of the two doses.‚Äù"
6961,"As a healthy person with an in-person job that doesn't qualify for any job-based priority that I know of, but narrowly qualifies for April under your proposal, I approve of your plan!"
6962,"So much for the concept that virus mutations are less harmful, like flu /s"
6963,But it would be unfair for young people still waiting for a shot /s.
6964,Florida is screwed thats obvious.
6965,If 300k are going that means 300k most likely without vaccinations so yah.
6966,"you think the Super Bowl was bad, add in the variants (most of which has been seen in Florida btw) and wow its gonna be terribad."
6967,Keep away from Florida people.
6968,"In honesty the smartest thing that could be done is stopping travel from florida to your state, thats the only thing to mitigate the spread After this events infected start showing symptoms."
6969,You know what else stops death and hospitalization?
6970,Being part of over 99% of the population.
6971,And you don‚Äôt have to inject yourself with something that‚Äôs ONLY approved for emergency use (this means untested and unapproved) to do that
6972,https://www.covidvaccinetexts.com/ will let you know when a pharmacy in your area has an appointment.
6973,That‚Äôs not why.
6974,"It‚Äôs not a shy voter thing, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgod, that dip was going to vote this year, really?‚Äù Thing."
6975,Normally the vaccine producers are selling doses per quarter.
6976,So if a producer have some spare capacity in one quarter it will sell that as a new transaction and not just improve an existing one.
6977,"That‚Äôs why the EU have been ordering so many doses of Pfizer, to get those extra doses in Q2 and Q3."
6978,Nah keeping everything to yourself is absurd.
6979,let's be real the countries with worlds best healthcare need the vaccines last.
6980,"That's why EU is giving away vaccines, people are people no matter what country they live in."
6981,So give it to the people who need it most.
6982,[removed]
6983,[deleted]
6984,Understood.
6985,Still completely disagree with the number though.
6986,"If you compare the sheer number of people vaccinated between all the countries on the planet, the U.S. is by far the leader."
6987,"China is about half of what we've done, and we don't really know how good their vaccine is or anything."
6988,Also you can look at percentages of the population but the only real countries that have a very high vaccination rate per capita tend to be corrupt middle eastern nations that probably paid extreme amounts for the vaccines and have very small populations.
6989,I got the J&amp;J vaccine Monday.
6990,"kicked my ass yesterday, felt like I had the flu fever and all."
6991,I feel back to normal today.
6992,Science be like that.
6993,"You can't just say ""it does because duh"", you have to show your work."
6994,But that isn't a Texas-specific issue though.
6995,It exists everywhere.
6996,"I've faced workplace discrimination outside of Texas, never inside, but I know there are people who've faced it from Texans as well - just saying my experience was different."
6997,I just hate to see Texas getting bashed on because of the few loud assholes here when basically almost an equal number of us condemn discrimination.
6998,"while true, it would also require people to use more than two brain cells at a time, something that's been shown to cause issues.."
6999,that reminded me of last year when someone hacked my college's email database and sent out a mass email to every single college student about trying to protest to get refunds back for that semester.
7000,It went about as well as you'd expect.
7001,That's why pfizer will finish last as they are trowing away potential customers so they can be nice to US government :)
7002,"Imagine a nobody making assurances over something like that and getting upvoted, yikes"
7003,Do they have residency requirements?
7004,If not I suspect the flights from Seattle and Portland will be full of wealth folks.
7005,"I feel like a lot  of states are gonna have an increase in cases due to how much snow the country got in February, and the fact that a lot of people were stuck inside and that to a degree curved the spread."

7011,"In a perfect world I would agree, but what you're suggesting can be easily abused by  many that are healthy and working at home."
7012,We're seeing that now in Georgia.
7013,Many people I know are pretending to be qualified to get the vaccine early.
7014,It's not fair to many in their early 60's and 50's with health issues that don't want to cheat to get it.
7015,"And, it's just too hard for workers to verify if someone qualifies or not - and that's causing a lot of people to skip the line."
7016,"Actually, at this point, what you ""can't say"" anymore is that there is not an educational gap between conservatives (undereducated) and liberals (normally educated)."
7017,That's definitely what the pandemic has proven
7018,"Scientist here, this is denial territory."
7019,"If the virus actually had a death rate of 3%, we‚Äôd be in a much wider world of shit...it‚Äôs concerning you think you could theoretically shrug your shoulders in that case."
7020,"Also, flu and other viruses don‚Äôt lead to these kinds of heart impacts."
7021,:/ that really sucks.
7022,"My parents live there and I‚Äôm from there, not that Alabama where I currently live is much better but still üò™

I just looked and wow the other states ramped up while GA basically stayed static"
7023,90 million people already received at least one dose and there's evidence that the first dose gives enough protection from the virus
7024,But Justin Trudeau tells me one dose is totally fine and it‚Äôs definitely not political ...
7025,"Oh, Florida..."
7026,Anyone get the J&amp;J shot?
7027,How they feeling?
7028,My point is that covid is not very harmful to children.
7029,Children pose a risk of spreading covid but if the adults are vaccinated then it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.
7030,I was using the flu as an arbitrary example.
7031,Literally just to virtue signal against conservatives
7032,"Side note: 

During the recent [Two Sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Sessions), the CCP Committee Secretary for Sinopharm claimed that their vaccine are effective even after a year since [""four of Sinpharm highest members had received vaccine at March 2020""](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-03-04/doc-ikftpnnz1947486.shtml)."

7036,I like that.
7037,"Yet here we are again, beach shaming and biker rally shaming every tourist that goes to FL."

7039,It‚Äôs not accumulated costs either.

7041,It is a value metric.
7042,"More like total estimated economic losses for each death and/or illness, hence why it‚Äôs much higher than what you expect the cost of covid treatment."

7084,But basically it's just how reddit processes popular trending posts and thus makes them more visible to more people.
7085,"&gt; For other reasons its hard to say, but verifiable proof of being an essential worker is needed to get a vaccine."
7086,This is kind of what I was wondering about.
7087,I know some people have lied about being a healthcare worker and I was wondering if it could ever come back to bite them (like if they make some note when you vaccinated of your false occupation).
7088,But it doesn't seem like it.
7089,Masks in public.
7090,Maskless around vaccinated people/people w low risks (most private settings).
7091,Masks aren‚Äôt bad at all I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so eager to get rid of them.

7096,Da Cheat is vaccinated
7097,As opposed to the SD biker super-spreader event which did kill family of mine?
7098,They could have done that but they could have also failed like many others have.
7099,&gt; I mean the only reason the US has so many vaccines is because of a vaccine fellows by a GERMAN COMPANY funded by GERMAN TAX MONEY.
7100,Well this is not the only reason the US has that many vaccines.
7101,"Pfizer, JnJ and Moderna are US owned companies."
7102,"Biontech is part of the reason that the US has this many vaccines, but not the only reason."
7103,"The US pays exorbitantly more for drugs than the rest of the world, this is a contributing factor."
7104,"That is the ""logical"" approach."
7105,But sometimes real-life doesn't work exactly as we would predict.
7106,Hence why I'm curious to see how things work out in places where they very rapidly went from a tier system to a free-for-all.
7107,Like Israel and now Alaska.
7108,they have also tested 20% more than the US and have a lower confirmed case per capita than the US so that will also play into both any decreases and any herd immunity discussions
7109,Duh
7110,it's a piece of cloth that can protect people against someone who has the vaccine and is a carrier.
7111,You're making a mountain out of a molehill
7112,ZERO percent hospitalization rate for those who tested positive for Covid and took Fluvoxamine
7113,The rollout in phases seems logical and fair (especially for the 65+ population) but it does come with drawbacks.
7114,It's tough to manage demand and some areas are going to have more demand than others.
7115,Glad they are using some common sense and getting vaccine in arms!
7116,Avoid off topic political comments.

7128,There is absolutely no need to have a guarantee of when you can get a second dose.
7129,"The first dose will give you nearly maximum protection for at least a couple of months and a second dose 12 weeks after the first, as is now being done in the U.K., may give better long- term protection than an early second dose."
7130,"Also, as time passes, the vaccines will be tuned to deal better with variants."
7131,"While reading your comment, I had to compare your two spellings about three times before I spotted the difference."
7132,My brain kept telling me they were both spelled ‚ÄúPerdinales‚Äù.
7133,Real world data and clinical trial data was different.
7134,"Clinical trial data: British Medical Journal reported that Pfizer's first dose was 52% protective at two weeks, see [https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826)

Real world data: Israel's research found almost no protection at 2 weeks, but around 90% protection at 3 weeks."
7135,"""After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21."
7136,**Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off.
7137,"** The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection."""
7138,"[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1)

The most likely explanation for the gap: the trial volunteers did as they were told, behaved exactly as if they didn't get a vaccine, and saw steady rise in protection."
7139,"The real life vaccine recipients dropped precautions too soon, saw an increase in infections from day 0 - 8, between day 8-14 the vaccine and the risky behaviors cancelled each other out (resulting in zero effect), and after 21 days the vaccine won."
7140,"Since you removed it, I can review my decision or even look anymore at what I removed FYI."
7141,So I can't restore it.
7142,Where did you ask this?
7143,Three out of five people haven‚Äôt been wearing masks anywhere I‚Äôve been in Upper Michigan ever.
7144,Not unless in a national chain store that requires it.
7145,Otherwise it‚Äôs 1 out of 20.
7146,"&gt;AUSTIN, Texas ‚Äì The number of COVID-19 cases is climbing again in Texas."
7147,"&gt;Data from Johns Hopkins University on Tuesday showed the two-week rolling average of new cases in the state has increased by 500.3 per day, or 10.1%."
7148,The uptick came as the state prepared to lift its masking mandate Wednesday.
7149,"&gt;The state health department on Tuesday reported a little over 4,800 new confirmed or probable cases, bringing the state‚Äôs pandemic total to almost 2.7 million, an estimated 128,614 of which are now active."
7150,"Texas hospitals had 4,702 COVID-19 cases on Monday, the most recent day available, 373 more than on Sunday."
7151,"&gt;The 167 new COVID-19-related fatalities reported Tuesday bring the state‚Äôs pandemic death toll to 44,650."
7152,The answer is in the article.
7153,He‚Äôs buying it as a backstop in case there are production issues that causes Pfizer or Moderna to miss deliveries.
7154,"Presumably, if that doesn‚Äôt happen then this just goes back into the pot of vaccines the US will donate to other nations (Canada and Mexico, in the first instance)."
7155,"I agree with you on that part, it‚Äôs just  ‚ÄúKicks in‚Äù is where I‚Äôm nitpicking."
7156,"That seems more stark than the situation calls for, at least in my reading of it."
7157,"‚ÄúVaccination effects not fully phased in until day 15..‚Äù or something could get us there with less room for confusion, I think."
7158,Believable results.
7159,Obvious political tilts.
7160,For instance the optimism on vaccine inventory timing by party lines is flipped now.
7161,3 in 5 sounds great...it‚Äôs 60%.
7162,Not exactly overwhelming.
7163,Don't forget star alliance and skyteam.
7164,If I had to guess it was a condition of Merck coming on board that the US would up their order to make it worthwhile
7165,&gt;Don‚Äôt get me started on the long term complications bullshit.
7166,It literally doesn't exist as a scientifically proven medical condition.
7167,The vast majority of these 'long haulers' never test positive for COVID or the antibodies...ever.
7168,It's entirely psychosomatic.
7169,Could be talking about percentage of eligible population.
7170,"16 and under aren't elegible, and really don't need it anyway."
7171,"Seriously, thru the entire ordeal many, many people refused to wear a mask without consequence."
7172,I saw tons of requests by employees to customers who flat out refused and walked right by.
7173,"There never was a ""mandate"" anywhere"
7174,Stop framing this as a uniquely American problem.
7175,"If you look at the figures for COVID vaccine hesitancy, the US is average in attitudes towards the shot, and the numbers of people willing to get a vaccine keep growing with every new poll."
7176,I will DM you my source (cos this subreddit won't just let me post it.)
7177,So 79m are allocated.
7178,"2 more weeks of allocation left in March (22nd, 29th)."
7179,Assuming same numbers that puts them at 92.316m.
7180,Short of the 100m they said **BUT** I assume there is a delay between what the CDC allocates and what moderna says is ready.
7181,"If you assume a 1 week lag time, you would have to go to the April 5th allocation date to cover everything moderna has ready."
7182,"So if you add another week - 6.6m, you are right around 99-100m (I did some rounding and Im sure Moderna is going to say 100m if they are at 99.2m)."
7183,So actually looks like they are right on for their numbers - there just is much more delay in getting doses from Moderna to the states then I believe people realized (myself included)
7184,That's my problem with how DeSantis is handling this.
7185,His 'let the sick and old stay at home while everyone else lives like it's 2019' plan is a problem.
7186,Allow me to explain.
7187,"I am not a senior, but I do have co-morbidities that put me at risk of severe illness and death."
7188,"I am not even close to being able to get one of the vaccines yet, however, due to the amount of seniors we do have in the state."
7189,"That being said, before Covid, I was able to travel, go out and about, go to heavy metal shows and rock out...so you see, I've got underlying conditions, but I'm far from ""deaths door"" when it comes to my health, apart from Covid."
7190,I used to have a very active life.
7191,So...all the governor had to do was enforce distancing and masks to allow people like myself to have some semblance of a normal life.
7192,But he hasn't.
7193,"He not only lifted all restrictions, he barred all local governments from enforcing their own mask mandates, and although stores can set their own mask requirements, they choose not to enforce them to protect their employees' safety."
7194,So for a year now...I've been stuck at home except when I drive my car around each week just to keep it running well and keep the battery from dying.
7195,What do I see when I drive around?
7196,Maskless people.
7197,Loads of them.
7198,No distancing.
7199,All the behaviors that do not need to be happening during a pandemic and that keep people like me safe.
7200,And he keeps encouraging big events that make it even more unsafe for me to leave my home.
7201,It was so simple.
7202,He could have opened everything ...but maintained distancing and masks.
7203,He didn't.
7204,"My choices are to stay home or die, and it didn't have to be that way."
7205,Avoid off topic political comments.
7206,"&gt; The USA has a ban on exports

false"
7207,I‚Äôm pretty sure that theory is urban legend.
7208,Never heard an infectious disease expert say anything like that.
7209,I have heard lots of Redditors claiming it though.
7210,They seem to base the idea on the assumption that if a disease is deadlier it kills its host too fast to spread.
7211,So therefore they should mutate to less deadly variants.
7212,"The problem is, that doesn‚Äôt work with pre-symptomatic spread."
7213,"If a virus can spread effectively before you even feel ill, it‚Äôs lethality isn‚Äôt a factor."
7214,There are many viruses that are just as deadly now as they ever were.
7215,You forget that Europeans on the internet have an unhealthy obsession with proving that the place they live is better than the USA
7216,"Eh, I'd like to comparisons across other countries."
7217,"Tennessee's 1C covers all sorts of conditions, so they should have no shortage of elgible people."
7218,"Obesity is probably 35% of the state by now, hypertension is another massive block."
7219,Living with a pregnant person is one I haven't seen in many places.
7220,It might just take a bit for people to realize they are in 1c since it's so expansive.
7221,Thank you!
7222,That article has absolutely **nothing** to do with the vaccine.
7223,And is **completely irrelevant** to the discussion here.
7224,So I'll repeat the two questions I've asked over and over it's a simple yes or no for each and you refuse to answer.
7225,* Do you think the vaccine is safe?
7226,* Do you think the vaccine will prevent suffering and save lives?
7227,"Yeah, and not all states have good roll out of the vaccine."
7228,"In my state, the governor just now started to allow pharmacies to give Vaccine shots."
7229,"I had to travel two hours from my city to get my first shot, and I will have to do it again to get my second shot."
7230,"He decided to prioritize rural areas over urban ones, but there wasn‚Äôt as much demand in rural areas."
7231,He is just now starting to wake up and hold enough mass vaccination events in urban areas so that the appointments don‚Äôt instantaneously vanish.
7232,"Congratulations on living in a state that didn‚Äôt screw up, not everyone is so lucky."
7233,Avoid off topic political comments.
7234,There is no way he‚Äôd announce it if not.
7235,"If he did, it‚Äôd be the same bs we experienced for the previous 4 years years."
7236,Merck is supposed to help manufacture the J&amp;J vaccine.
7237,This is his first prime time national address as president.
7238,I‚Äôd go as far as saying he‚Äôs going to define what the real finish line looks like and how we get there.
7239,It‚Äôs a chance to actually define it and stop letting every doctor that taps 140 characters make up their own definition.
7240,This is his presidency.
7241,If we‚Äôre still arguing about masks in January his presidency could effectively be over.

7244,"&gt;Nanette Riedell-Mendez said her 95-year-old mother, Francine Riedell, received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine Jan. 28."
7245,She said she got a call March 1 from the nursing home telling her that her mother had tested positive.
7246,She said her mother collapsed Sunday and had to be hospitalized.
7247,Yup.
7248,We‚Äôve not lost our minds to the extent that Americans have.
7249,Shame.
7250,Avoid off topic political comments.
7251,"Wow, that sounds awful!"
7252,I am glad that you made it through okay!
7253,"Thank you for the information, maybe if I take some ibuprofen, and, like you said, don't work the next day, it will be ok."
7254,small but very concerned about your genitalia
7255,Do not spread misinformation.
7256,Agreed.
7257,I was referring more to total geographic land area.
7258,It‚Äôs not as spread out as other large cities.
7259,Yes but they could have implemented a law like the USA to block any exports at all.
7260,"Or they could have negotiated contracts like the UK that promised all the production until the contracts were fulfilled,  and get to cynically claim that there are no export bans just like the UK can."
7261,Weird that is not the feeling I have gotten at all since moving here in 2010.
7262,The posh part of dallas is up near Frisco where as north Fort Worth seems to be the rich suburbs everyone commutes to Dallas from.
7263,Plenty of job openings in Dallas right now for my profession but I'm struggling to find anything close to Keller.
7264,"You're getting downvoted, but it is generally the truth."
7265,The conversation has become too much as if Pfizer plant in Belgium has/or should be basically expropriated by the EU opposed to the private company and facility it is.
7266,"But EU does have the ability to keep Pfizer from exporting it's products, and have chosen not to, likely due to both diplomatic reasons and longer term considerations of investment."
7267,You would think we'd see allocations really ramp up soon.
7268,"On February 23, the companies said projected [a combined 140 million doses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/23/vaccine-distribution-pfizer-moderna/) to the federal government by March 31."
7269,"Since that date, the federal government has [allocated](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Pfizer-Allocations/sxbq-3sid) 25,564,500 Pfizer doses and [allocated](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Moderna-Allocations/ke78-phpe) 20,298,200 Moderna doses, or a combined 45,862,700."
7270,"That's for the weeks of 3/1, 3/8 and 3/15."
7271,"If you add in the week of 2/22, it's 59,362,740."
7272,"If that's true, we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-90M doses short of where we expected we'd be at end of March."
7273,"However, I'm not sure if this includes federal pharmacy program allocations or doses specifically for LTC, which could change the math slightly."
7274,And it's important to note that doses allocated by the feds doesn't exactly mean doses delivered to the feds.
7275,"But still, it feels like things are pretty far behind where we might've expected them to be at this point."
7276,"Unless we're sitting on an absolute tsunami of doses, hard to see how we're anywhere close to the projections by end of March."
7277,To what end we already bout enough vaccine to vaccinate everyone
7278,"People on this very sub are still spreading ""Yes you still need a mask after a vaccine otherwise you're spreading the virus and could kill someone"" nonsense."
7279,You can't just say no like a child and expect to be right
7280,"Ohio is to Phase 2 now (60+, teachers, public service workers, pregnant women, etc)

Looking forward to 45+/widespread vaccines and I won't be picky!"
7281,"Can somebody explain to me why Biontech/Pfizer can suddenly, by signing some papers and throwing some huge wads of money around, deliver 4 million extra dosis in matter of weeks?"
7282,"I thought production was the main problem, where did the 4 million come from?"
7283,Is the rest of the world getting less vaccines the coming weeks or what?
7284,Sorry but when I‚Äôm stuck in hours of traffic being harassed by multiple homeless people it does feel like a ‚Äútown‚Äù.
7285,Austin is not anywhere close to feeling like a town lol
7286,Pfizer.
7287,Saving europeans in more ways than one!
7288,"From the article:

&gt; Seventeen residents of a Brenham nursing home contracted coronavirus after being either partially or fully vaccinated against the virus with an inoculation created to prevent people from developing a severe illness."
7289,"&gt; Officials at Focused Care at Brenham said Tuesday that nine of the 17 residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 were fully vaccinated, while the remaining eight had received only the first of the two doses."
7290,Avoid off topic political comments.
7291,I 100% agree.
7292,"For me personally, it‚Äôs hard to just ‚Äútrust‚Äù that a for profit company who stands to make a lot of money is in it solely for the greater good."
7293,There are so many times where these companies put out a product they knew was unsafe but decided after doing a risk benefit analysis that they could still make more money by keeping the product out and paying out any damages.
7294,I‚Äôm all on board with getting a vaccine that I feel is safe and ending this pandemic but I shouldn‚Äôt be shamed for not having blind faith in ‚Äúthe science‚Äù after knowing the past actions of these companies and even certain governmental agencies.
7295,It‚Äôs my own personal belief that an informed public questioning the methods and data behind ‚Äúthe science‚Äù is what will hold these pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies accountable and ensure the safety of all.
7296,"The people of Vietnam, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere have known we're assholes for quite a few years now."
7297,Likely they received a lot more.
7298,"Seems to be common in quite a few states where small towns get a lot, while big cities are behind."
7299,"Sorry, but no."
7300,Good luck to you.
7301,"In my opinion, every day is safer and safer."
7302,Less people are getting it and being hospitalized.
7303,"Those patients will be getting better treatment and soon, by the end of the month we will almost have an over supply of vaccine."
7304,"I just don't see how people can be negative, but that's just me...."
7305,I think they they are just retooling a Sanofi plant.
7306,"I think what the poster you are referring to is more long term investment by the Pharma industry inside the EU, not just for Covid vaccines."
7307,And that's obviously a key consideration.
7308,Pfizer invested in it's Belgium plant with the plans for it to be a global workhorse.
7309,EU not interfering in those plans will reaffirm Pfizer's decision and make them more confident in future investments.
7310,"If the EU steps in and stops Pfizer from being able to fullfill its contracts with other countries with an export ban, than Pfizer and other Pharma companies very well may divert future investment elsewhere."
7311,Because it is still not so deadly and can be transmitted before showing symptoms.
7312,People say virus mutates to be more mild one but it is just speculation.
7313,"Yet another example why I tell people ‚ÄúAustin is an oasis of normalcy, amongst a sea of Texas.‚Äù"
7314,"A $1.9 trillion covid stimulus, and we can't find the money to build a wall across the 150 miles across northern Florida, and physically separate the asylum from the rest of the country?"
7315,Not surprising Texas had so many deaths over the past few months.
7316,Don't spread misinformation.
7317,Also comparing tuberculosis to coronavirus is asinine.
7318,"TB can lay dormant for your entire life, but is treated with antibiotics."
7319,We screen everyone coming from an infected area.
7320,They make you video in every day when you take your antibiotics.
7321,We have almost no cases every year because of our strict policy.
7322,"If you go into a TB ward or are around active TB infections, you bet your ass everyone is wearing a mask."
7323,Cases may uptick slightly but it‚Äôs virtually impossible to surge like we‚Äôve seen in the past given how many people have had covid and have had vaccines
7324,"The point of a vaccine is to strengthen your immune response to it so that when you catch it, your body will know how to defend against it."
7325,"That's literally like the definition of a vaccine, which I'd strongly suggest you inform yourself on before spreading both disinformation and ignorant presumptuous safety dismissal."
7326,"It's true that vaccines have been noted to significantly reduce transmission but its important to observe the word *reduce*, not eliminate entirely, we aren't there yet, and while it can still be transmitted, we have to stay safe until we really are in the clear."
7327,"Otherwise, people like you, who are far too jumpy to toss their masks and stop washing hands and pretend like life has gone back to normal for lack of patience will keep this shit spreading and we will have to stay in quarantine and mask usage even longer, because, as it turns out, you dont have to actually *contract* the virus to spread it, all you have to do is shake two peoples hands, it's not rocket science, despite what a lot of people try to make it out as."
7328,"Also keep in mind the CFR(case fatality ratio) is 3%, which includes early cases with treatments that killed people."
7329,"The IFR (Infection fatality ratio) is much lower, but impossible to tell."
7330,Since those extra people would have never tested positive.
7331,I walked my dog without a mask today.
7332,"Granted, people maintain a 16-20 feet distance from us anyway because of him, but I felt so weird and guilty, and I had a constant thought in the back of my head wondering if I should still wear a mask!"
7333,Pic related: https://i.imgur.com/ArcGLK6.jpg
7334,I think its all terminology and wording and what each step means.
7335,"For example, on the CDC vaccine counter, they use ""delivered""."
7336,"I assume thats different meaning then your above link, which uses allocated."
7337,"So question is, when do allocated doses become delivered doses?"
7338,"For example, are March 8th allocations being delivered this week?"
7339,Or is it March 1st or March 15th doses?
7340,"If we assume its March 8th, that would mean the CDC doesnt have the vast majority of those doses delivered yet."
7341,they have moderna at 60m delivered.
7342,"So that would mean 3 full more weeks, ~20m more, plus whatever is left on this week."
7343,That would put them close to the 100m they said.
7344,"Yeah it's really unfortunate, but if you live near a more rural southern city, there's often no shortage of appointments in that city."
7345,"I live in Raleigh and friends have told me it's basically impossible to get the vaccine here without waking up at the crack of dawn and having incredible luck, but you can wake up late and still find ~25 reservations in nearby Greensboro."
7346,Who is getting these doses then?
7347,So we‚Äôre just going to forget the Super Bowl happened
7348,"Hush now, you're getting in the way of the indignance."
7349,"Hypothetically if the J&amp;J vaccine was the first/only vaccine, it would have probably have been a universally joyful celebration as a path to exit the pandemic."
7350,"Because all of them are that, LOL."
7351,"The US is fortunate that we can end it sooner without waiting for J&amp;J production to fully ramp up, but other countries are going to successfully exit the pandemic mostly thanks to the J&amp;J vaccine."
7352,"Ah, that makes sense."
7353,You get what you give.
7354,Seems like it's better generating viral load.
7355,"So it's not evolved separately to become more deadly and more infectious, but has evolved in a way that increased symptoms and increased transmission are both side effects."
7356,"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e1.htm

-only 51 direct cases from that, in Minnesota"
7357,Not at all.
7358,Try to examine the top posts before posting yet another duplicate.
7359,"Yes, until a few days ago teachers still were not part of the priority group."
7360,"He‚Äôs been more focused on buttering up seniors, a more reliable constituency for him."
7361,"I mean, it's not bad."
7362,I would just assume the fall to be much bigger when you consider how many folk already got one shot and how many already went through the virus (confirmed+unconfirmed).
7363,It's just confusing when you keep hearing about how effective even one jab is.
7364,"From the article: "" The B117 variant is not believed to cause more serious illness than other variants""

From a study published in the BMJ today: "" Infections with the new variant VOC-202012/1 (as measured by S gene negativity) were associated with an increased risk of death (P&lt;0.001) in people testing positive for covid-19 in the community."
7365,"The increased hazard ratio between 1.32 and 2.04, higher than for other variants, translates to a 32% to 104% increased risk of death, with the most probable hazard ratio estimate of 1.64, or a 64% increased risk of death. """
7366,"[https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579)

It's just for public transportation, schools and city buildings."
7395,I thought it was more than that.
7396,The deaths in nursing homes are outrageous since the vaccine has been given.
7397,Removing a state mandate is anti-life?
7398,Y‚Äôall do realize like half the south doesn‚Äôt have a state level mask mandate right?
7399,It‚Äôs not just Texas
7400,"If you want to [read their rationale, you can...](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/fully-vaccinated-people.html)"

7419,Thanks Abbot.
7420,Thanks Trump.
7421,I kind of thought this was a given.
7422,That's the case in most states with a similar makeup.
7423,"The cities support the rest of the state, and the rest of the state will physically assault you for saying that."
7424,&gt; ~~unfortunately~~ fortunately they legally can‚Äôt enforce penalties for not wearing masks.
7425,DeSantis signed an executive order last year banning local municipalities from enforcement
7426,"You're right, but statistically, there is no difference."
7427,8th of December...
7428,Most businesses all over are keeping mask mandates.
7429,You cannot definitely say that they would be dead if schools were closed either.
7430,Maybe.
7431,"But as someone living in one of the ""better"" states for handling COVID (California), beaches, malls and restaurants have been jam packed here since summer 2020."
7432,"You mean like keep schools closed ostensibly because of fear of COVID, but then go on airplanes with no social distancing?"
7433,With so much of the population living in urban areas most are taking COVID seriously despite the state level stupidity.
7434,Compare this to entirely rural states where the virus runs rampant because small towns refuse to wear masks.
7435,"It's not that it's different in Texas, no States are actually enforcing mask mandates in small towns, so at that point it's just the ratio of urban to rural."
7436,"It sucks for the cities that are actually trying, but they're all being hurt similarly regardless of state."
7437,I‚Äôm curious what other Texan cities that are keeping *their* mask mandate.
7438,You clearly do not understand the state of America‚Äôs public school system and the day-to-day life in a school.
7439,"I see 130 11-14 years olds in a small, not well-ventilated room for 8+ hours a day without proper PPE such as masks, gloves, plexiglass shields, and disinfectant because the state won‚Äôt fund it for school districts."
7440,Show me a job that isn‚Äôt teaching with similar circumstances that ISN‚ÄôT virtual.
7441,There isn‚Äôt one.
7442,I disagree that the loss of life isn‚Äôt more significant and detrimental to society than student regression.
7443,You are not an educator and do not understand child development.
7444,A majority teachers are not vaccinated from what I understand.
7445,Show me your sources that a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of teachers are vaccinated.
7446,I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs less about education than the personal freedoms the general anonymity of city life affords people that makes cities more liberal.
7447,Small towns resist change because everyone knows one another and can tell when a person has changed drastically.
7448,Where as most people in a city have no clue who you were yesterday and have no expectation on you tomorrow.
7449,Plenty of educated assholes and regressive types are out there.
7450,And plenty of uneducated liberal folks.
7451,"Education plays a part because of the experiences it can open doors to, but I genuinely believe that the freedom to express oneself and change rapidly without communal judgement is a major driving force in the liberal nature of large urban environments."

7486,It won't really change much.
7487,Plenty of places weren't really enforcing the restrictions anyway.
7488,You are trying to imply that they'd still be alive if schools were closed and you most definitely cannot say that.
7489,I'm glad to hear your parents had such a good experience with the system.
7490,Hopefully D.C doesn't goof it up.
7491,Our rollout so far hasn't been the best.
7492,I‚Äôm curious to see what your experience was like?
7493,"Yep, I‚Äôm of the personal opinion that Biden‚Äôs request didn‚Äôt do much in that particular situation, since states were already in the process of improving distribution and eligibility requirements before that."
7494,"By late January, most of those issues were resolved - you are correct, and I have/had no intention of rewriting the situation for political purpose."
7495,My apologies if my wording made my answer slightly confusing.
7496,The difficulty in scheduling an appointment is still a major issue.
7497,"It‚Äôs gotten better now, with some centralized websites for making an appointment, but it‚Äôs honestly still pretty abysmal."
7498,I hope it can be improved before vaccine access expands to the general population.
7499,Senior FOMO.
7500,My parents wanted to wait and see until summer.
7501,Everyone around them got the vaccine and were fine.
7502,They got their first shot 2 weeks ago!

7513,which is funny because people from all of the country are moving here like crazy.

7543,In his defense on the latter being a half baked multi multi millionaire whose primary jobs are reacting to fights and sharing his opinions is bound to lose touch to some extent.
7544,"In the US, 1.6M vaccines administered, 55.6k new cases (according to worldometers)."
7545,That's a dumb statistic.

7549,Walgreens has an option to schedule your second dose.
7550,Don't know if you can schedule it a month in advance (normally they are three days out for dose one and scheduling dose two at the same time) but worth checking.

7553,"The definition of ""severe covid"" here doesn't necessarily involve actually going to the hospital."
7554,&gt; Yes.
7555,I would rather my students learning suffer temporarily than lose my life permanently.
7556,I love my students and I value my students but not over my existence on this earth.
7557,Tons of people have been going to work in-person throughout the pandemic.
7558,Fucking McDonald‚Äôs workers have.
7559,Is there a 100% chance you‚Äôll die if you teach in-person?
7560,No?
7561,Well there is a 100% chance kid‚Äôs will have stunted lifetime learning.
7562,&gt; Sorry...not the 2.7 million people that have ceased to exist?
7563,"....ok

500,000 mostly older Americans dying is a depthless tragedy."
7564,But the long term effect from students losing a year of learning is going to be worse.
7565,Especially when you consider how poor and minority children will suffer even more.
7566,&gt; Where have ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù been vaccinated in this country?
7567,My state has had one of the largest federal allotments of vaccines and has vaccinated just 7% of the adult population in 3 months and teachers were only added to the list of eligibility two days ago.
7568,I was referring to the majority of teachers.
7569,I don‚Äôt know where you live but all states have equal shares of vaccines per capita
7570,"&gt; I believe so, yes."
7571,"This is an answer to the above question:

&gt;When that happened didn‚Äôt Biden send a request to states to expand eligibility?"
7572,What are you talking about?
7573,The issues you are describing were gone by late January.
7574,You're talking about December/early Jan stuff.
7575,"&gt;States opened up eligibility and opened more vaccine sites, which is how we‚Äôve gotten to 1-2 million doses per day."
7576,We had a rolling 7 day average of 942k on Jan 21st.
7577,We were right there at the edge of 1M.
7578,"I'm not trying to start a Biden versus Trump fight here, I'm just saying that you've got a serious re-write of history going on."
7579,"When it is still bloody hard for an elgible person to get an appointment, it's not eligibility that's the problem."
7580,Will do!
7581,Fair enough!
7582,I appreciate that.
7583,Send Bill an email that you need an xbox.
7584,He already has the shipping address.
7585,Fair enough.
7586,At a certain point it does always come down to actions over words.

7590,So you California muh Texas!

7592,"Yes, and how many teachers work in your district?"
7593,Perspective is important.
7594,"Yep, any potential benefit that would come from vaccinating a 41 year old and not a 35 year old would be more than offer by the bottleneck it causes on getting a vaccine."
7595,"We need to get to the point to where you can walk into any pharmacy and get vaccinated without an appointment, just like a flu shot"
7596,That‚Äôs why Austin is lame
7597,JT has clearly said repeatedly all adults who want one will be offered one by September.
7598,Purposefully vague.
7599,Now it turns out supply may get us to how you believe but unless it happened today  A dose by Sept was the plan.
7600,Hopefully it doesnt matter whose interpretation is right.
7601,And it says 5.168% has received ‚Äúat least one dose‚Äù.
7602,"Some have received one, and some have received two."

7613,"After many of the plant fires in 2019, some environmental groups began to suspect that Ken Paxton starting suing these plants and other non-compliant facilities using the Attorney General‚Äôs office (cases are processed through the TCEQ, then referred to the AG‚Äôs office in certain cases)."
7614,"By accelerating the AG‚Äôs prosecution and being very lenient with return to compliance actions (small penalties), Paxton‚Äôs office could prevent Harris County prosecutors from suing with a stronger case and having stronger penalties."
7615,"It also re-directs settlement money to the state rather than the county, even though it‚Äôs the populace of Harris Co that is negatively affected by these events."
7616,Agreed - I also feel that any and all general practitioners should also be able to get their hands on vaccines to administer to their patients.
7617,I imagine the large influxes of people lining up at the mega hubs would diminish significantly or more people would get vaccinated if private avenues opened up as a means to get  inoculated.
7618,I am fully vaccinated lol.

7625,Henry said that all staff and residents at the home were offered immunizations and that there was very high uptake of the vaccine.
7626,She said some of the cases were among people who had received two doses of the vaccine.
7627,This is the bottom line: vaccinated people can (with low probability) become infected.
7628,If they do they will almost certainly have only mild or no symptoms.
7629,"But what's key is: *they can likely still pass the infection to others* - for example, to UNvaccinated people who *could* have severe to fatal symptoms."
7630,"AFAIK, there has not been official CDC or other statement that this (vaccinated person transmitting the virus) is or is not possible, but it certainly seems like it could happen."

7666,"Additionally, there are ‚Äúpredatory journals‚Äù that will publish anything, however Scientific Reports does not fall into that category."
7667,"Imo, vaccine hesitant people should be our last priority."
7668,"If someone chooses not to get the vaccine they‚Äôre eligible for, that then becomes their conscious decision."

7788,Its new subscription service and its future theater release revenue is highly dependent on production which has been shut down on some projects as well as delayed or made far more expensive on others.

7876,I wonder how Mississippi is getting so many.
7877,You can sign up online for Kroger or Walgreens and get a shot tomorrow.
7878,I signed up last night and rolled in this morning to my local grocery store and got a shot along with my groceries.
7879,I'll never forget the Facebook post about a high school friend who died suddenly.
7880,"He was in his twenties and healthy, and he died overnight because he thought he would just get over the flu like a cold."

7883,"6.5mil adults, 933k people that's not vaccinated nor recovered adults left, 10% of the general population, 14% of the eligible."

7885,It's almost not worth it for them to try.

7921,My only symptom was slightly sore at injection site.
7922,Absolutely nothing else.
7923,"9 people an hour is a lot though for vaccinations, at least in the US."
7924,Having proof of prior infection will not resolve the issue of associating the symptoms with psychosomatic problems.
7925,"In some instances, it'd be the exact opposite."
7926,"If you have confirmed proof that you had an infection, as an upgrade from merely suspecting it beforehand, that actually has fair odds of exacerbating psychosomatic symptoms."
7927,However...
7928,"In those with psychosomatic symptoms who were not previously infected, if they believe the result -- that they weren't previously infected, it might result in some miracle cures of psychosomatic symptoms."
7929,"But more importantly, being able to sort those who were confirmed to be infected versus those who were not will help researchers dig into all the various causes and effects, both psychosomatic and otherwise."
7930,I had a trip scheduled for that week in Arizona to see some baseball games and a concert.
7931,"One by one they were all cancelled, and then grocery stores were getting ransacked."

7935,"I don't watch basketball but that caused me to think ""Ummm."""
7936,"I'm in Jersey, so we got hit first--I was sent to work from home the following week and have been really anxious since then."
7937,"Yea, I was expecting a lot more downvotes, but it seems there are people here that appreciate my question."
7938,And so far everyone has been really cool about it.
7939,"However, if you read the thread, you will notice that no one has an answer and it is frustrating."
7940,Maybe someone will come along and share a reference or something.
7941,"So far, all that is being said is that there's a Phase 4 Trial that needs to be conducted to gain progress towards a FDA Approval."
7942,I asked for details about it and if there's anything else and there was no follow up to that.
7943,"Maybe by the time I'm eligible (I'm in the low risk pool), a vaccine will be FDA approved and I don't have to worry about it."
7944,"That's what's I am hoping for, but I believe that won't be the case."
7945,I believe I will be eligible before a vaccine is FDA Approved and I will just have to ask my doctor to explain what tests are missing and how they have no bearing on my health conditions.
7946,"If the doctor can explain that intelligently, then I should be able to trust him and hold him accountable for that decision."
7947,"the funniest thing is as an american i would say the same, like the line *America first* but you are comparing apples with pears."
7948,every country should've closed their country to stop the spread from country to country.
7949,imagine China wouldn't lie that much and would've closed before it started to get out in the world.
7950,world wide pandemic?
7951,no!
7952,"it would be a great job from america if they produce and share with the world, even 90% america and 10% to afrika would be ok but *america first* is just selfish, it is what it is"
7953,&gt; There should be zero more days of under 2M vaccines administered with the supply we have.
7954,"&gt; 
&gt; 

Remember these numbers are really posting for the weekend."
7955,They will always be lower than they should be regardless of what happens because some places will be closed and some reporting areas will also be closed
7956,"We had two days under 100 over the weekend here in the UK , the first two-digit days since early October."
7957,Things are getting better.
7958,"We need to stay vigilant, but there's real hope now."
7959,"Well, he pretty clearly was saying that the dip in cases over the last few weeks was temporary and we'd be back up to our December highs, or worse."
7960,His analogy was fine...if it was anything close to accurate.
7961,But he was woefully wrong.
7962,I think it depends on where you are!
7963,I‚Äôm in portland OR and I know a lot of crazy anxious people about it lol.
7964,"Not me, but a lot of people."
7965,I can explain it.
7966,It's not true.
7967,US has a higher death rate per capita both over the course of the pandemic and right now in its 7-day average.
7968,that's fair.
7969,a lot of people can't work from home.
7970,However there are people who take few to no precautions.
7971,"no masks, no avoiding social gathering, etc."
7972,I'm sure their rate of infection is higher.
7973,As of now the virus is hopefully running out of easy targets.
7974,close to 40% of the country may be immune and the other 60% may be one's who are able and willing to take precautions to slow the virus down.
7975,"Okay, For All Those Sleeping."
7976,"I was on a trip in Europe that ended with a cruise that included stops in Egypt, Israel, and Cyprus in early March and there were some doubts about whether or not some of the countries might let us get off the boat."
7977,In Egypt we had doctors come on board and take our temperatures before they let us disembark.
7978,"I had also been in Venice early in the trip, where unbeknownst to me at the time, the big outbreak in Northern Italy was starting."
7979,I only heard about that whole thing happening a few days later and then became super paranoid whether or not other countries would let me in since I had been to one of the early hotspots.
7980,"Not too long ago, someone I know got their flight back but nothing from the place where they were staying (Couldn't even change to a different day), despite the fact that they canceled was because there was a funeral"
7981,That fee goes straight to the government not the airlines.
7982,The thing is a lot of that money doesn‚Äôt even go to the TSA or anything flying related.
7983,"This is currently happening in my country (Serbia) we have secured a lot of vaccines already, when I say a lot I mean around 2.5 million or more(bought 14million and population is about 6million) and we have a problem, only 1.6m people have registered for it so far and the numbers aren't on the rise."
7984,"Nobody else wants to take it, there's actually extra vaccines that we have and we have already given away some to our neighbouring countries."
7985,"Country is starting a wider campaign so that they can vaccinate people who are living in rural areas but the main issue is that people won't take it, especially poor areas (6% have opted in, while richer areas are at about 50%)."
7986,"We have this problem now, cases are on the rise because people don't care about preventive measures anymore due to ""we have vaccines, you guys take it i won't"""
7987,I feel bad for Israel too.
7988,They have admin.
7989,100 doses/100 people and STILL have cases plateauing
7990,Still...everything must remain shut down and schools closed and anything else is completely irresponsible
7991,"Osterholm knows that once this whole pandemic is behind us, nobody will pay attention to him anymore."
7992,Category 5...or more!

8005,Then I went back the next day and started getting paper goods and other essentials.
8006,"My partner thought I was cuckoo, haha, but I was like ""we need to stock up!"
8007,"what if we get sick and we need to quarantine inside for two weeks?"""
8008,"Sad thing is now I've checked this reddit once a day, every day for over a year."
8009,"Hoping that in April, I'll feel like I can check it less frequently as cases continue to decline and vaccinations increase :)"
8010, Got the vaccine today.
8011,"The National Guard gave mine and she was really good with that needle, lol!"
8012,They gave us the Moderna which is 94% effective against the strains and it is an mRNA vaccine so it works differently and uses the genetic code of the virus instead of dead virus cells to trigger an immune response.
8013,It is supposed to last longer because of that.
8014,They made us wait 15 minutes before we could leave in case there were any side effects.
8015,No one fell over flopping.
8016,I didn't have any immediate side effects but I will let you know if that changes.
8017,"Anyway, I weighed the risks and thought I should get it but it has to be a personal choice."

8109,Hang in there brother!
8110,"You‚Äôve been strong enough to make it this far, which means you‚Äôre strong enough to finish off this final leg."

8115,Damn... that‚Äôs really unfortunate.
8116,Hope she changes her mind/perspective going forward.
8117,Makes sense.
8118,Is licensing a 1-time thing or will it need a separate license for each age category?
8119,I think letting them see everyone else getting it and not suffering 5G side effects will help.

8128,Yeah good luck with that.

8140,"Member states can buy the vaccine individually, some already did."
8141,Deaths should be way way down due to vaccine targeting  most likely to die.
8142,Then hospitalizations will go way down.
8143,"Eventually the number infected but ""healthy "" will go down."
8144,Morbidity will still be a thing until vaccines are high enough.
8145,"All assuming the opening of states doesnt lead to increased mutations until we get one that is deadlier, or doesnt work against vaccines"
8146,This is India.
8147,"There are 100,000 vaccinators part of the campaign and I think 10,000 vaccination centers - if each person vaccinates 9 people an hour for 8 hours a day - you can vaccinate 7 million people."
8148,"That said there's other sources of dropoff - scheduling, logistics, social distancing etc."
8149,I had earlier mentioned that India has a vaccine manufacturing capacity of 70 million a month.
8150,At 2 million a day we have already started to eat up our domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity without having much left to export.
8151,Our domestic manufacturing needs to be scaled up significantly before we can support such high vaccination rates.
8152,yeah it took me and 3 of my educator coworkers 15 min each to snag an appointment.
8153,the key is to eschew gov sites and just go to safeway pharmacy website or equivalent
8154,So long as you're willing to take a medical treatment for which the developers have been exempt from liability.
8155,"On the other hand, the current Hungarian government at least seems to have seen the fiasco with the EU vaccine purchasing scheme early on."
8156,"And being the pariahs they already are within the union, at least made the most of their status, and were the first to break the ranks and also order vaccines elsewhere."
8157,"Which is an amount of common sense that one would wish others had had as well, a few months back."
8158,So the current situation in Hungary might be unfortunate: but putting them on the same level as (for instance) Brazil is pushing it quite far.

8169,Disagree.
8170,I want the one that keeps me from getting infected with covid at all.

8181,Yeah exactly.
8182,Why even get tested.
8183,Its better just to be sort of ignorant if you know you are going to have to break the rules.
8184,Taking precautions is good but people can't be expected to live such covid centric lives
8185,From everything I've read it seems the most effective across the board.
8186,"Not to say the other two aren't effective, it just seems from the info I've seen Pfizer is my preferred choice, but like I said I'll happily accept Moderna or J&amp;J."
8187,You may not get any side affects from second dose.
8188,"Cases of serious symptoms after 1st dose indicate that you've had COVID before, just hadn't noticed it, or thought it was the flue."

8194,"Acevedo is very politically motivated himself, trust me."
8195,Mask mandates should remain until everyone has been offered a vaccine.

8197,Heard immunity is great!
8198,"True, but I can tell that the people hesitant about taking the vaccine are not the ‚Äúthey cause autism!‚Äù crowd (and likely hate them as well)."
8199,It just needs to be emphasized that we made this vaccine with all the knowledge we‚Äôve had about corona viruses since SARS which was almost 20 years ago.
8200,"Uh oh, better get to your fainting couch!"
8201,Someone compared two leadership positions in the limited context of a very basic subject that even most children are able to comprehend!

8203,Then at 9 am they give our wristbands with an appointment time on them.
8204,I would go sit in a camping chair for 3 hours for my grandma if needed.

8245,It may not help against Covid but over all it is helpful to your immune system
8246,Are either of them medical professionals?
8247,This is reddit where people don't know how to read basic balance sheets.
8248,so we talked about the study that said in places with masks mandates the cases went down but my dad just showed me it and the downfall was like 2 percent max.
8249,Am I reading this wrong that's like nothing.
8250,How many people that got it had taken the vaccine?
8251,This is kind of important.
8252,And since the LTC homes have been taking vaccines we have had 0 deaths these last few days.
8253,Kind of a big deal.
8254,And as a greater percentage of people have this first dose how much will that slow things down?
8255,I understand Pfizer said 21 days but was any if that based on science or just trying to speed of the phase 3?
8256,Why should we care about case rates?
8257,If deaths and hospitalizations are under control ( as in low ) then what else are we as a society going to do?
8258,"The behavioral modifications ( masks, social distancing ) have probably penetrated as much as they are going to and barring a variant of the disease that escapes the vaccine protection and also is more contagious, we will simply need to move forward with life."

8260,Lmao thanks for the laugh
8261,It's a Republican governor making a stupid decision directly against medical advice for political reasons.

8291,"Here's the data from Table 3: Adjusted  odds ratios for confirmed case by interval after vaccination for both vaccines, vaccinations administered since 4th January 2021, age &gt;=70 years

8308,If someone is getting money it makes no difference to me.
8309,You're right about that.

8312,I didn't know I forfeited the right to an opinion?
8313,I'm not complaining about people getting RELIEF.
8314,"In fact, I've been a vocal proponent of relief since the second this started."
8315,I'm complaining about the money being spent now (the pandemic is fundamentally ended) and given to orgs/people etc where it's providing no measure of relief.
8316,It's just cash being handed to someone.
8317,It is demonstrably true that people are saving more than ever this past year.
8318,It is true that people's financials were BETTER in 2020 than in 2019.
8319,You're right- I make more money than an average individual.
8320,I am certainly aware that I'm blessed.
8321,But to reduce it to a place where I'm not allowed to formulate an opinion on it is asinine.
8322,"My income will probably see a 15-20% reduction this year because of covid and around me, people who are seeing NO reduction are being handed cash."
8323,It's not a little bit screwy to you?
8324,one shot or two?

8367,"He is also already 78 years old, making him 8 years older than the previous record holder for oldest president at inauguration."
8368,The presidency is rough on you (if you do the job) and I would actually be surprised if he wanted to do it a second time -- I'm not entirely certain he *wanted* to run this time as much as prevent the country from suffering a second Trump term.
8369,"Yes, this is how government is supposed to work at the local levels."
8370,I‚Äôm stunned at how many people are so taken back by this.
8371,"Yes, but if one has less chance of having a moderate infection, less chance for postviral syndrome."
8372,And I wasn't referring to side effects from the vaccine itself - I have yet to see any reports on incidence and severity of all infections post vaccination.
8373,I think there's huge danger in people thinking they're individually equally adequately protected.
8374,These decisions are only to save the hospitals.
8375,I'll be happy to see how this plays out.
8376,"Yeah dude, it's kind of *the entire point of governments* to look after their own citizens interests."
8377,What state if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
8378,"My state is the worst of our neighbors and we‚Äôre hitting around 77,000 people a day."

8381,Not a single one of those from from the 1.5 million tests done on the 8th.
8382,That guy is right though
8383,Me too.
8384,I was sick for seven days after first Moderna shot.
8385,I would for sure.
8386,It's better to endanger a relationship than to endanger their lives.
8387,Because most people sleep at night.
8388,And 65% &gt;&gt;&gt; 0%.
8389,What's your point?
8390,"Like I said, the trials exclude people who would have been in and out of hospitals before vaccination due to their pre-existing poor health."
8391,These are the people who are most likely to be hospitalised if they catch Covid.
8392,I actually find it hard to believe.
8393,"For example, I live in Missouri and it's a fucking shit show right now."
8394,ESSENTIAL WORKERS are still waiting to be vaccinated.
8395,"And people are losing their patience and lying (I know far too many people doing this) about this eligibility to get the shot because apparently, they are going off of the honor system."
8396,"Basically, I'll believe it when I see it."
8397,"Over here all the regular hospitals have no appointment and it's really just walgreen/duane reade, but walgreen/duanereade have such complicated process and their website even glitched."
8398,"So if you tried all the eligibility options, you still get rejected"
8399,Assuming we keep going in this direction and everyone can get a shot I have no clue what the legit argument against fully opening up would be.
8400,The probability of getting covid is (vaccine efficacy) * (probability of exposure).
8401,Getting a more effective vaccine lowers the first term.
8402,Telling everyone to get the vaccine lowers the second term.
8403,"If there is a risk, the risk might still be outweighed by the decreased probability of getting covid."
8404,I volunteered to help get people registered and checked in at a clinic and was given the vaccine.
8405,"&gt;Lead author, Dr Michael Chourdakis, from Aristotle University, Greece , said the analysis avoided the methodological limitations of previous studies by only using recent data on vitamin D, and did not only include subsets of the population, for instance, people in nursing homes."
8406,"In a recent review, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) agreed, finding evidence for vitamin D supplementation with the aim of preventing or treating Covid was still lacking and that further research was needed."
8407,"‚ÄúWhat we lack at the moment is really a definitive trial which demonstrates a cause and effect relationship,‚Äù said Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, who is leading such a study."
8408,That‚Äôs awesome.
8409,Up here in Canada for the most part they just started the 50 to 75 age group (prioritizing the 75) so as a 37 year old I‚Äôm expecting to have a chance around June maybe?
8410,"I don‚Äôt k ow, we have 4 vaccines approved now and my province is doing pretty good in terms of administering the doses we‚Äôve received."
8411,"I have him his sources he asked me for, and he deletes his comments after I provide them lol"
8412,Six for Florida.
8413,And our restaurants have been at max capacity since last summer.
8414,"If I‚Äôm vaccinated and the vaccine is available to anyone who wants it, I‚Äôm taking off the mask."
8415,Simple as that.
8416,"If you want to keep wearing the mask, that‚Äôs fine but if anyone is worried about getting it and spreading it, they should get the vaccine instead."
8417,If primary care Dr's had access to shots they could just call their doctor and make an appointment.
8418,As soon as it hit several countries outside of China I knew stopping the spread in the US would be impossible and thought everyone would get it (luckily I was wrong as I underestimated how quickly the vaccine would be developed).
8419,However I sort of shrugged my shoulders at that because I just never thought a few months decrease in life expectancy was a massive deal.
8420,"As for when I realized it would cause massive social and cultural changes: When the NBA and college basketball were ‚Äúpaused‚Äù, and when all restaurants and bars in NYC were closed."
8421,I wouldn‚Äôt have previously thought either of those things were imaginable outside of the total collapse of civilization.
8422,Well starting tomorrow in my state all the anti mask donkey nuts are going to spreading their privilege all over so sorry if I‚Äôm a little pessimistic.

8447,"No doubt we'll get one eventually, but eventually much later than it should be."
8448,It's not for lack of trying on our part.
8449,Just it's more worrisome since restrictions are being lifted.
8450,We've extended our search radius to 50 milies so far.
8451,But not reasonable to make much further trip than that.
8452,Vaxxmax.com is not accurate.

8454,Go back to vaxxmax.com and still shows appointments available.

8522,I find it odd how many people are completely ignoring how successful Florida has been with some of the least restrictive mandates in the entire country.
8523,Any governor seeing their state fall apart probably looks at Florida and thinks that it‚Äôs the right move.
8524,"The WHO, CDC, and Fauci change their directives on a monthly basis."
8525,"They‚Äôve been on both sides of just about every controversy in the last year, so I can totally see why the governor would just blow all of them off and tell their own citizens to be responsible and that he‚Äôs not going to handcuff them anymore."

8541,I'm not saying leadership is not a part of it; as Cuomo is getting less inspiring by the day.

8548,Right?
8549,The problem is not having a mask mandate will make some who were on the fence about wearing a mask to not wear one (and put others in danger).
8550,It encourages people to think that the pandemic is over when in reality it is not.
8551,"I‚Äôm with you - a lot of people seem resigned that covid will always be around, but it seems eradicate-able to me."
8552,We never had a 95% effective vaccine against the flu before.
8553,If/when we do that will be a game changer too.

There has existed an mRNA vaccine against MERS since 2017."

Only the pandemic provided serological insight into the need for the second dose to be administered before the ramp-up of the immune system to avoid the primed immune system from rejecting the vaccine."
8699,"After 21 days, the human immune system starts to ramp up and beyond 28 days the efficacy of a single dose is pretty solid."
8700,"You see, in 18 years of attempting to create a vaccine against SARS and  MERS, what we learned is immunity and cross-immunity is our greatest obstacle."
8701,"If a single-dose was provided to a candidate who had some form of immunity already from a recent cold, the vaccine produced zero reaction."
8702,That window of opportunity for the second dose is short.
8703,"If the second dose is not done to the manufacturer's recommendations, it can be wasted."
8704,Pfizer is currently attempting to determine the best window for a third dose to provide over 96% efficacy against variants.
8705,The window for a third dose from the second dose is looking like 9 to 11 days.
8706,"All done with scientific evidence, not tinfoil hats."
8707,Dude we spent 6T to bail out junk mortgage bonds and nobody batted an eye.
8708,Pfizer
8709,"That's probably actually what they want them to do though-- I don't think the concern is ""don't get covid at a party"" as much as it is ""don't party elsewhere and bring new variants back to the broader community."""
8710,"I'm personally not as concerned about variants, but it's clear that people are petrified of them in my community as a whole based on the reaction to college students bringing the British variant back to the local campus after the holiday breaks."
8711,"I imagine it'll be next month, but at worst May"
8712,Doubt it.
8713,We just need to get past the initial exposure.
8714,The flu killed untold millions the first time it spread.
8715,Now it‚Äôs (mostly) just a nuisance we live with.
8716,We just need to get the population past that first couple exposures.
8717,If anyone is acting like a spoiled brat it is yourself.
8718,I think many of us who were excluded from the stimulus and who are still in the middle class (and the ones paying the bulk of the taxes that fund it) have every right to have an opinion and express frustration.
8719,You don't know everyone's situation or the impact to their lives from COVID.
8720,This is such an 'eat the rich' mentality that is still targeted at the middle class.
8721,"Also, the federal government doesn't pay your bills, it simply collects and redistributes wealth."
8722,Tax payers pay the bills of those who can not.
8723,Whoops!
8724,"Mods, I can remove my post if it's too redundant."
8725,Two.
8726,About 90% have one
8727,From what I have been getting most nursing homes if not all of them are doing regular testing to catch outbreaks and contain them.
8728,"Been trying to convince my mom but nope, she wants a Johnson and Johnson... Moderna is in every pharmacy and she‚Äôs eligible but nope."
8729,Shame that its still not released to kids
8730,Yeah welcome to the club.
8731,Did they have mental health services in the health plan before?
8732,I find it hard to believe they didn‚Äôt have any at all
8733,typically side effects won't hit you till much later.
8734,so long as your drive isn't hours long you should be good to go :)
8735,"people say money changed him, it's the DMT lol"
8736,"Bobby Lee‚Äôs Tiger Belly, Your moms house with Tom Segura and Christina P, King and the sting with Theo Von and Brendan Schuab if you just want to be in a better mood."
8737,"Tom segura and Bert kresisher came out with 2 bears 1 cave, I‚Äôve been into that lately"
8738,"I know but this one was lockstep with the teachers, didn‚Äôt even come up with a reopening plan."
8739,"And I‚Äôve herd the same thing from teachers as well, including on this platform"
8740,Toilet paper.
8741,"Last I checked, people sitting at the bar and at a booth aren't wearing masks."
8742,You can continue to wear one...that's your choice.
8743,This is exactly what Missouri has been doing all along.
8744,"There has never been a mask mandate in Missouri, but there is one in Kansas City and St. Louis."
8745,"2nd article on google when I typed in ""j&amp;j vaccine vs others""

Although the Johnson and Johnson vaccine trial showed a lower efficacy rate in preventing moderate to severe cases, it was very successful in stopping serious illness, and 100 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations or death."
8746,"https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/how-effective-is-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-j-and-j-efficacy-rate-chart-what-vaccine-is-best/65-1c6c9ebb-c3e1-48ee-ab5a-202cf2c1ffd7

Honestly I'd argue that people are saying the J&amp;J vaccine is WORSE than it is - the efficacy rate in the US was 72% (66% was world wide)"
8747,"How about we take pictures of them with their names, post it online, and attach it to their bios."
8748,Have you considered that he‚Äôs been acting like such a moron that sometimes even other morons can recognize it
8749,Nice to see some sanity coming out of Texas.
8750,Though I'm sure we will soon see stories of anti-maskers screaming and threatening some poor store employee's who are simply trying to enforce store policy on mask wearing.
8751,"For society to function then yes, making one's *safety* other people's responsibility is perfectly reasonable."
8752,"Examples: You cannot drive drunk, speed, or leave your seat belt off."
8753,"Each of those actions not only endanger you, they put others at risk."
8754,Covid is no different.
8755,Wearing a mask is meant prevent the spread of a new disease we're still learning about and will be for years to come.
8756,"So people who say, *""Your health isn't my responsibility."
8757,"My body, my choice!"
8758,"""* are being well and truly ignorant."
8759,"""I didn't even drink that much."
8760,"I felt totally in control"" after you killed someone with your car."
8761,"""Geeze, I'm sorry."
8762,"I didn't think I was going that fast"" after you hit someone's kid in a residential neighborhood going 45 in a 20 zone."
8763,"But hey, your body, your choice, right?"
8764,So it's OK if you feel fine but are asymptomatically spreading a disease to people.
8765,"And the thing is, the above actions are crimes."
8766,Not wearing a mask isn't.
8767,Wearing one is such a simple act of logic and compassion to help *everyone* get out of this as soon as possible.
8768,We've been patients at UCHealth for about a year.
8769,They sent out messages about 3 weeks ago saying that all UCHealth patients are automatically registered for the vaccine and would receive invitations to schedule as they became eligible.
8770,"I got my invitation to schedule on March 5th and was able to schedule my first dose for March 6th, second dose on April 3rd."
8771,Seriously?
8772,I lost total respect for that guy
8773,Illinois has twice as many nursing home residents per capita as Florida.
8774,Of course a greater portion of deaths would be in nursing homes in Illinois.
8775,"But frankly, 34% is abysmal considering Florida has one of the lowest rates of nursing home usage of any state."
8776,"If you're putting a *rag* on your face, then you're just disrespecting yourself, my dude."
8777,Side note: Do you wear clothes outdoors?
8778,"If so, what's the difference between ""No shirt, no service"" and ""No mask, no service""?"

8896,"Driving drunk is two conscious and optional actions, (1) getting drunk outside your house and walking distance (2) not having your friends or Uber/taxi pick you up."
8897,"Restrictions/recommendations range from extremely reasonable(wash hands, if sick stay home, if medically vulnerable take additional precautions) to extremely authoritarian measures where you cannot exercise or leave your house as a normal person."
8898,The timeframe is also measured in months/years rather than a day.

9321,"Austin - the haven for Texans who love Texas, but hate republican culture."
9322,Please share all the young kids dying from covid.
9323,It‚Äôs literally always been left leaning.
9324,So much crying in the comments ü§£
9325,Q anon conspiracy theorist Karen‚Äôs lmao
9326,I like the Dallas City Hall building.
9327,Murals of our 19th century settlers massacre-ing Indians line the halls.
9328,"As a person of Austin, I would like to live thank you."
9329,Thank you to everyone in Texas who‚Äôs going to continue wearing masks despite our idiot governor üíï
9330,Also traffic
9331,"Has there ever been a disease, or is it even theoretically possible, for a disease to be asymptomatic and also extremely deadly?"
9332,"Federal government: does something liberal  
Abbott: How dare you, you can't just drag texas along on your liberal agenda, we deserve our own autonomy!"
9333,"Austin: does something liberal  
Abbott: How dare you, you're a part of texas and you can't just do your own thing, you have to do what I tell you!"

9335,your lies will deceive you a lot of the time.
9336,trust the process
9337,Small but also big brother
9338,Got some links I can study?
9339,Good job to Alaska!
9340,I would love to hit up Alaska right now.
9341,This is more or less it.
9342,(Probability is hard to explain!)
9343,It might help to explain how the vaccines are tested in a little more clear detail.
9344,"Vaccines are trials where they recruit a bunch of people with similar demographics (age, location, health history, etc.)"
9345,and then split them into two equivalent groups.
9346,"Group 1 gets a fake vaccine, and group 2 gets a real one."
9347,"At the end of the trial, they check to see how many people in each group got COVID."
9348,They compare Group 1 to Group 2 to see what the difference is.
9349,"Let's say a trial recruits 30,000 people, and has 210 cases of COVID across all participants."
9350,"Of those, 200 of the cases were in Group 1 and 10 of the cases were in Group 2."
9351,"Because all the people were recruited the same way and randomly divided up, we'd expect roughly the same number to be exposed to COVID in both groups."
9352,"So if the vaccine didn't work at all, we would have expected another 200 cases in Group 2."
9353,"Instead, we saw only 10."
9354,Looks like the vaccine is helping!
9355,"Because the vaccine has prevented 190 of the 200 cases we were expecting to see, we can say it showed 95% efficacy."
9356,It's just as useful to look at what this doesn't tell us.
9357,"It doesn't tell us anything about your chances of catching COVID overall, and it doesn't tell us anything about masks/social distancing/etc."
9358,"What it says is that once you were going to get COVID anyway, for whatever reason, the vaccine had a 95% chance of stopping that from happening."
9359,"So if you have a 72% efficacy vaccine like J&amp;J, it means that out of 100 times you were already going to get a moderate case of COVID-19 because the rest of your defenses had failed, 72 of them will be prevented."
9360,"I wish that people were more concerned about contracting it, instead of chalking it up to ""do I die or not""."
9361,"In that sense our focus on mortality has essentially told people ""you're 99% likely to be fine"" which they interpret as ""just the flu"" and has led to a lack of compliance."
9362,So our framing was fucked from the start and largely to blame for the shitshow.
9363,But also I just wish our vaccine people focused on transmission more than symptoms.
9364,"I mean, I'm not a virologist so maybe they didn't understand it enough at the time to do anything other than target the spike proteins."
9365,"But I get the impression they could have tried different approaches instead of all aiming at the same, apparently insufficient, goal."
9366,"Fun fact: Austin also has a far lower rate of obesity than the rest of Texas, which has some of America's fattest cities..."
9367,Don‚Äôt kids have a higher chance of dying from the flu?
9368,"If you weren‚Äôt worried about them going out during flu season in the past, you shouldn‚Äôt be now once all adults are vaccinated."
9369,"Yeah I was raised Republican in Texas tbh 

Recently had to actually choose who I was voting for 

I‚Äôve come to hate the republicans around me Even if some are family (especially the ones quoting bible verses and don‚Äôt actually got to church) (and their beliefs of conspiracy theories without any proof)

Some of them are good people like my manager // means well expects a lot but a bit out of touch // good for management really

Tbh we are the most powerful country in the world and I expect more protections in place set up by our Governemnt intervention if shit starts to hit the fan (like recently) Not turn it up another setting and like the house of fire


We have building codes for civil engineers don‚Äôt we?"
9370,Shouldn‚Äôt we have checks and balances for our economy?
9371,"I mean instant ones not something we can argue about for 9 months 

Look at the republicans right now 

Especially How none of them want to help their constituents at all 

Sad really"

9380,Checking on the updated vaccination plans across the country in Canada should cheer you up!
9381,It‚Äôs amazing to think this time a year ago was when things began going off the rails.
9382,"Just yesterday I got my first dose and by the looks of the numbers, things are getting better."
9383,What a difference between mid-March 2020 and mid-March 2021.
9384,As much as they want until they have vaccinated their population.
9385,"Lol you must not be familiar with Vidor, TX."
9386,One day in the future mask wearing will come to an end and we will see smiling faces again.
9387,Not sure why you are being downvoted.
9388,Can someone reply with any sort of rational argument?
9389,"Except, when Dallas got a FEMA vaccine clinic up and running, the State government withdrew their vaccine distribution from the county, reducing the supply to the big cities."
9390,Austin is also one of the most liberal city in Texas.
9391,I'm seeing a correlation here...

9397,Legally they can refuse service for non-compliance
9398,All he did was lift the mask mandate.
9399,He‚Äôs not ordering people to not wear masks.
9400,"If history is any indication, Greg Abbott will take this personally and he will lead a charge to have Texas' Congress pass legislation that says cities aren't allowed to mandate masks."
9401,boy I sure am glad political posts aren‚Äôt allowed in here!
9402,otherwise this subreddit would be just another /r/politics echo chamber!
9403,üôÑ
9404,I‚Äôm so sick of the follow science to the point of not using your eyes.
9405,Are little kids dying from covid?
9406,No.
9407,He met with him.
9408,Doesn‚Äôt mean they are besties and are over all the time.
9409,Don‚Äôt believe everything you read on Reddit from random comments.
9410,Everyone wants to go full partisan and tribal all the time.
9411,"A whole mess of people, which explains why the numbers may be so high."
9412,"we dont know that tho, i mean its probably true but the whole point of the safety process is to make sure lol"
9413,&gt; Viruses always threaten humans and we have to learnt o live with them.
9414,"I'm glad you brought this up because hardly anyone mentions a resoundingly horrifying consideration about this: no, we have not been here before."
9415,"When you had outbreaks in ancient civilizations, people could develop herd immunity (after such pains) because the populations were relatively minuscule back then."
9416,A city *and region* in ancient Greece at it's peak might host a few hundred thousand people.
9417,Now the metropolitan area of Athens alone has nearly 4 million people.
9418,"Mutations happen as a percentage, i.e."
9419,"maybe 1 out of 10,000 replications results in a new mutation (it's an example number, I don't know what the actual rate of mutation is on average)."
9420,"So in the region surrounding Athens (Attica), of the maybe 300,000 people, you'd be dealing with 30 mutations."
9421,"And of course most mutations are harmless, like a person developing heterochromia (eyes with separate colors)."
9422,So you'd say maybe 1 in 500 mutations actually make the virus more virulent or dangerous.
9423,Meaning an outbreak in ancient Attica was unlikely to produce a mutation that changed the game.
9424,Now of course our cities alone are so large that each urban region can host it's own mutations.
9425,But *worse* we live in an interconnected world with airplanes and ships where we effectively have one large region known as Earth.
9426,Where one virus can spread to every corner within weeks and months.
9427,As it did just one year ago.
9428,That means that we're going to see more mutations than we've **ever seen in human history**.
9429,It doesn't help that the coronavirus is particularly known for mutating.
9430,"If these mutations keep popping up and developing features like more infectivity or vaccine resistancy, this virus **doesn't go away**."
9431,"This is why public health officials are urging us to not only vaccinate and slow the spread in our own countries, but to get the rest of the world vaccinated ASAP too - for our own good."
9432,"Even if everyone in the United States was vaccinated sufficiently against the current strains, if the virus is rampant in Malawi and breeds a strain that happens to be resistant to our vaccine, it's going to reset all of our efforts."
9433,We've got almost 8 billion people on this planet now.
9434,And projections expect it's going to take us several *years* of concerted effort and loads of money to get the world vaccinated.
9435,That means we're going to see new mutations pop up over and over.
9436,**Unlike anything we've ever seen in human history**.
9437,Natural herd immunity does not work here.
9438,Just look at Brazil and what P1 is doing to them.
9439,"To be honest, I'd much rather be in Israel's position."
9440,They are sticking to a process that is supported by scientific evidence.
9441,"Canada, on the other hand, seems to have arbitrarily decided on a 4 month gap."
9442,"Is there any data to suggest that, specifically, the 4 month gap is a better option than the 21/28 days suggested by the manufacturer, or 90 days as used elsewhere?"
9443,I am talking specifically about if human body is better equipped at fighting covid with 4 month interval than 28 days
9444,Some estimates put it around 4-8 times higher.
9445,There‚Äôs nothing in this vaccine that‚Äôs gonna hurt healthy cuts.
9446,Huge old fat fucks take it with no problem.
9447,And we already know this virus is more lethal to older people lol
9448,[removed]
9449,it does make sense tho.
9450,"immune systems work differently with age, and while young immune systems are typically stronger than old immune systems, some viruses are actually more lethal to the young and healthy, namely the spanish flu"
9451,Yes.
9452,I was a little tired right after.
9453,I got home and experienced more fatigue and a gnarly fever at night.
9454,But i was able to drive home.
9455,"Prisons are a high risk population due to the how close people are and lack of masks, coupled with a lack of proper healthcare (inability to go to the hospital when needed), and I do not have faith in Texas treating its population well."
9456,Decisions like this certainly do not give me faith in the institution to properly maintain safety.
9457,"&gt;Although TDCJ has received tens of thousands of doses of coronavirus vaccine, the agency has not yet chosen to vaccinate its inmate population."
9458,"&gt;So far, 628 inmates in TDCJ have been vaccinated, only because a freezer failure last month prompted a rush to get thawing doses into as many arms as possible, the agency reported."
9459,"The inmates were all in the state‚Äôs vaccination phase 1B, in which older people and those with chronic medical conditions are eligible for the vaccine."
9460,Dallas and Fort Worth are essentially a buffer zone to protect best Texas from Oklahoma.
9461,"God, fuck gregg abbott."
9462,"Him and so many other of Texas' ""leaders"" are the reason myself and so many other texans are moving out the first opportunity we get."

9469,I don‚Äôt mean purely semantical.
9470,You mentioned that it tends to be a right wing talking point so I‚Äôll use an example that tends to pop up in left wing circles‚Äî‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù.
9471,"Although by definition, it‚Äôs referring to the largest pharmaceutical companies...there are hints of disdain in the expression."
9472,"It tends to be used to describe pharmaceutical companies that are so big with so much influence and market share, that their objectives tend to be more aligned than with those of smaller pharmaceutical companies."
9473,‚ÄúThe media‚Äù is used to represent the same sort of frustration with the amount of power wielded by so few.
9474,"because of their stranglehold on the news, the major news companies have the luxury of selling news to a single consumer base."
9475,"The WP for instance, would be reluctant to post a story painting the right wing in a positive light."
9476,"Fox, on the other hand, would collapse if they started posting left wing stories lol."
9477,‚Äúthe media‚Äù is those giant news companies that have the luxury of playing politics first.
9478,"Soooo I‚Äôm totally cool with, at the very least, these pseudo monopolies having to put up with a nasty little word grouping...for any company in an industry dominated by a select few"
9479,"It's my second time, so I know exactly what you mean."
9480,Yah but the old people that are protected won‚Äôt die.
9481,That‚Äôs the whole point.
9482,And what plataue?
9483,"I watch a little bit of basketball, but this is the same for me."
9484,But only because it was paired with the news that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had tested positive.
9485,"I don‚Äôt pay much attention to basketball, and I don‚Äôt follow celeb news all that much, but I think paired together those 2 things made me realize it was going to get serious."
9486,thats the opposite of counter productive tho.
9487,"if theres a limited supply of vaccines, then it makes no sense for people who are minimal risk to get it compared to people working day in and day out at grocery stores or at other essential jobs."
9488,"obviously if there are available doses but nobodys getting them, then let anyone get them, but as long as supplies are limited, it makes total logical sense to prioritize people who are at risk"
9489,This is one of those statements thst you just **know** was made up in the spot.
9490,"Video games, fitness, movies, music, computers, comedy."
9491,Anything in that realm would be awesome!
9492,Impressive numbers imo.
9493,Compare to europe.
9494,[removed]
9495,And stop making dumb rules that fully vaccinated people still can‚Äôt do shit
9496,Watch all the people that are anti government involvement be fucking stunned people who disagree with them aren't doing what their government wants.
9497,"&gt; That said, getting back to school should be the first priority and providing additional mental health services second."
9498,"I think taking care of people's health is more important than making sure school starts a few weeks sooner....but you do you, man."
9499,"Obviously, we aren't going to agree."
9500,"It killed 0.15% of the US population in the span of a year, even when the country bounced into (and out of) restrictions."
9501,How is it not dangerous?
9502,This shit makes me laugh.
9503,Wasn't it liken last week American redditors were jerking each other off because they were 'winning' in terms of citizens vaccinated.
9504,Doesn't matter when you have absolute morons running certain states.
9505,March 11th.
9506,I remember it distinctly as the night Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive and the NBA suspended it‚Äôs season.
9507,It was shortly after that that my work shut down.
9508,Most of the damn county can't pronounce Bexar correctly anyhow.
9509,Wow over 25?
9510,That‚Äôs crazy.
9511,I‚Äôm a small person on the high end of normal.

9524,But this time dont ‚Äú throw him over the side ‚Äú
9525,I just weighed the pros and cons of each one.
9526,"It was a matter of weighing possible long-term, severe side effects against a possible effective treatment of the condition."
9527,"When I examined the different possible side effects, what I thought I could live with played a huge role."
9528,Under what metric?
9529,"Here in Indianapolis, people are receiving their vaccines at the Indy Motor Speedway."
9530,Recipients can drive into the infield with their car where they‚Äôre giving the shots.
9531,Parents just got theirs yesterday.
9532,Ok fine you made me laugh
9533,Anyone have any luck getting a shot in Alabama who is under 65 with no pre existing conditions?
9534,Not sure where to call or who to talk to to see if there‚Äôs any leftover for my partner.
9535,She should be locked up.
9536,Basically assault
9537,Not exporting something doesn't mean it's banned from being exported.
9538,The EU has a legal instrument to block exports and has used it.
9539,The UK has no much mechanism at its disposal.
9540,What do you mean about the kids?
9541,Aw man üòÇ She sounds like fun lol
9542,"All the same, by your own logic, the government are murderers if they don't outlaw tobacco."
9543,But you don't see it that way.
9544,Why not?
9545,Why don't you consistently apply your own reasoning to other things?
9546,"Where is your vitriol for ""cowardly"" politicians who don't outlaw something that kills 480,000 people each year?"
9547,Or here's another question.
9548,Why don't you blame Joe Biden for not implementing a federal mask mandate?
9549,He's been President for over a month now.
9550,Why doesn't his failure to issue a nationwide mask mandate make him a murderer?
9551,Yep it desensitizes people from the idea.
9552,It becomes less appalling and more digestible.
9553,People should really stop making jokes about things that are appalling.
9554,It doesn‚Äôt help.
9555,"Since it technically wasn‚Äôt your turn, did they mention your second dose or is there some concern you won‚Äôt be able to get your second dose on time?"
9556,Alaska just announced that anyone above the age of 16 can get vaccinated there.
9557,Hopefully more states follow their lead and just do away with these arbitrary vaccine phases.
9558,The vast majority of those vaccinated for COVID were seniors.
9559,This man used to be chief in Austin (I live in the area) and was outstanding and still is.
9560,He has always been the type to refuse to cower to politicians and what is often the status quo of just being quiet.
9561,He calls out injustice and discrimination and has always been just.
9562,I have allot of respect for him.
9563,I think he would make an outstanding governor of Texas.
9564,What im saying is dont lie to get a vaccine because if you do under the guise of having health issues that could come back to bite you financially.
9565,insurance would get wind of this and either kick you off for lying about your real or fake health issues or would dramatically increase your premiums.
9566,"Getting a vaccine based on having an illness that your insurance is aware of or thats actually true wont change your premiums unless you are trying to deceive insurance on what medical issues you actually have, which is fraud anyway."
9567,I got it and had pretty bad reactions but survived and would get it again.
9568,"First time I‚Äôd ever gotten a rash, EVER, had to take benedryl."
9569,Definitely had a decently high fever but has to work the next night so didn‚Äôt bother checking it.

9571,(And I get migraines).
9572,"Nausea, no appetite, and couldn‚Äôt get warm."

9590,Logistics here can be complicated so we‚Äôre all pretty good at logistics.
9591,Also we‚Äôre pretty good about holding the plane for something as important as the vaccine.
9592,And the doses going out to the middle of nowhere aren‚Äôt being restricted.
9593,"Show up in town, inoculate everybody, and move along."
9594,That a lot easier to do in towns of a couple hundred people than big cities.
9595,"The big cities, specifically the Anchorage area, are where the vaccine rollout is actually going the slowest."

9628,The obvious thing to do at the start of the vaccination campaign was to focus on healthcare workers and the elderly.
9629,"After that, the science is less clear so politics will take over."
9630,And I have no political use to Californian politicians.
9631,I‚Äôm not wealthy enough to bribe these corrupt assholes but I‚Äôm also privileged in many other ways so I‚Äôm worthless to them for anything other than taxes.

9633,"If you care to read--which I know is difficult for people like you--please take a look:

9635,yeah me too
9636,Just go get your own N95.
9637,Most people will continue to wear masks in settings for the foreseeable future but at some point this needs to end.
9638,If you want to protect yourself even more there is an option for that.
9639,Cloth mask theater is going away though.
9640,So has NY.
9641,All 12 Alaskans rejoice.
9642,How is the guy credible when he Tweets conspiracy theories?
9643,People that wanted it to be dooms day are mad everywhere.
9644,Are they vaccinating out of state residents there?
9645,I just assume everyone who wants full back in office instead of a hybrid option is that annoying over eager coworker that everyone hates lol
9646,Good for you.
9647,That was a very smart decision.
9648,You could damn well have saved your life because of that decision
9649,I thought that the vaccine distribution was proportionate to population
9650,"True, but I don't think it takes a degree in rocket surgery to administer a vaccine shot."
9651,Presumably citizen volunteers could be trained quickly to deliver the vaccine.
9652,"Perhaps not ""mix"" it as is needed with Pfizer, but at least trained enough to be able to jam a syringe into someone's arm and depress the plunger."
9653,"Frankly, if they could get the vaccine into auto-injectors like an epi-pen... literally any idiot could do it themselves."
9654,"In the mean time, there is plenty of capacity at pharmacies, clinics etc to handle it."
9655,This is a great idea.
9656,I spend a lot of time driving through very rural areas and often a Dollar General is the only chain business for miles in these rural areas.
9657,"Seems like a perfect place to deploy the J&amp;J vaccine, since their existing refrigeration capabilities would handle the vaccine and they wouldn't need to manage return appointments."
9658,"You do realize California(full lock down, panic masking) and Florida (very little lock down no panic masking) have similar numbers."
9659,Almost like lock downs didn't do shit except hurt people
9660,Sturgeon and the SNP will do anything as long as it isn't what Westminister is doing in the hope that every now and again one of their decisions will prove to be better so they can totally *own* the English.
9661,"Covid hasn't changed this and has probably made it worse

I hope the SNP get their arse kicked at the next elections but the sad thing is they won't because of their strong independence policies"
9662,How many doses do we think we can realistically expect by the end of March then?
9663,"'Georgia Walby, from the Long Covid Wales support group, said: ""These one-stop-shop clinics are needed because people do not have the energy or resources to go back and forth to their GP and be referred to different clinics."
9664,You need to go to one place and be treated.
9665,"""You give up - if you are not being listened to by your GP, you just give up."
9666,"You put off ringing because it takes too much energy, and that phone call becomes a battle.""'"
9667,The experience of most people with chronic health conditions not just long covid.
9668,Are there any studies about reinfection in children?
9669,Spouse and I are almost fully vaccinated.
9670,Baby had COVID a few months ago.
9671,I‚Äôm wondering how long we have that we are all considered immune/safe.
9672,I never said they would break contract with the EU so why are you asking me that?
9673,So it‚Äôs still less than 1%.
9674,I‚Äôll take my chances.
9675,Public masking is impossible to enforce as we can literally see from the past year.
9676,I have to drive my dad 130 miles away from where he lives to get his vaccination in NY.
9677,I think it definitely is a British thing
9678,I have two issue with everyone referencing NZ and Australia.
9679,1.
9680,They are islands and don‚Äôt have open boards like the US.
9681,"We had hundreds of thousands of people cross the border in 2020, if only 5% had covid it would cause spikes were ever they went."
9682,2.
9683,The US for some stupid reason will not report the data regionally.
9684,NZ and Australia do.
9685,They lock down regions when needed not the whole country.
9686,Why has the US not created regions so we can control the spread or at least reported on data state by state.
9687,Literally when the US was at peak surge 20% of the country was coming off their peaks and were approaching record decline but cause 2 states were having surges (CA and TX) they overpowered any decline by a factor of 10.
9688,"People were held in restrictions for something happening 1,000s of miles away."
9689,That's a pretty moronic way of looking at it.
9690,"""We've had no worse impact"" doesn't mean you haven't had an impact and that any decisions made weren't wrong."
9691,Look at the cases...they went up for Vegas right after opening up.
9692,"That's factual, simply look at the graphs."
9693,We don't hear about you because we hear about \*everyone\*.
9694,This has been a shitshow for all.
9695,Whether you personally like the mask mandate or not has no bearing on the science behind it.
9696,"It's factual that if you remove the mask mandate, numbers will go up."
9697,I hope no one disagrees with that because you'd be completely wrong in that regard.
9698,"So the only question is if you do that, how much does it increase it and what do you really gain by letting people prove their 'American spirit' by buying oversized bags of potato chips from Walmart without a mask?"
9699,I got my first shot on Feb 26 (Phizer) at some point this weekend I got the virus.
9700,"Been having trouble catching my breath and feel like i have the flu, but my vitals all stable and I wonder how much worse I'd be off if I hadn't gotten at least one shot."
9701,"In Alaska it was all honor-system based anyways, there was no eligibility screening or proof required."
9702,[removed]
9703,A ton of anti-mitigation people here now.
9704,"They can't accept some things sucked before, we have to 100% go exactly back to how life was pre-pandemic, and that should happen immediately, including going into the office 40+ hours a week, sitting next to the exact same people who end up hating each other and seeing them way more than your loved ones and friends, and the 10 hours of commuting time."
9705,I know the US is doing well with vaccines.
9706,Which other countries are moving at our pace?
9707,Hoping to travel internationally this year or early next year.

9716,I usually get my flu shot at target so I was wondering when they would get in the game here.
9717,They definitely have the infrastructure in place for it already.
9718,"Gotcha, thanks for the help!"
9719,I am very happily wearing a mask during a pandemic.
9720,I will not wear them during non-pandemic times.
9721,Interesting.
9722,I didn't know they had more locations than Walmart.
9723,"If they can reach more of the rural population, that is great, but with only refrigeration capacity, wouldn't it be limited to just the J&amp;J vaccine (at least for now)?"
9724,"I know the perception is that it has been politicized and that Republicans are more anti-mask, but I have a feeling that the younger demographics who have been going to clubs/bars and having parties without masks are more likely to be Democrats, meaning it is likely less politicized than we think?"
9725,"I think wearing a mask is a small ask, but I wouldn't say zero burden."
9726,"If it were zero burden, I'd happily wear it every year during flu season as a precaution, but I'm sure most people won't be doing such a thing."
9727,I think this is a questions that's a bit hard to get right on a survey.
9728,I'll wear a mask and/or socially distance (stay home) when I'm sick but on a day to day basis I would hope to pack into the trader joes after work again.
9729,US Supreme Court has said that such public health measures can be enforced by health departments.
9730,"why would AZ break contracts with the EU, if they could be sued out of existance for breaking the contract?"
9731,Really?
9732,No one is getting turned down in NY/NJ if you sign the attestation that you qualify.
9733,"Businesses largely self-enforce and people who respect the severity of the pandemic also abide by it, especially when they fear potential repercussions."
9734,Lol stop it already.
9735,They're getting the vaccine rapidly and you won't kill a local grandma anymore by showing up there.
9736,I heard some pharmacies aren‚Äôt bothering with residency because they have vaccines and appointments and no one using them.
9737,You can probably call one and see if they care or not.
9738,Why not Pfizer or partial order from both?
9739,"Places like New York City have gone out of their way to prioritize access of the vaccine to these communities from day one, and still they are having a hard time convincing them to get the vaccine."
9740,Providing photographic evidence of a person's I.D.
9741,on a phone often doesn't work when proof of I.D.
9742,"is necessary, so I'd get a physical copy too."
9743,They aren‚Äôt stopping deliveries of Pfizer also because Pfizer his on track with its schedule and they‚Äôre not doing last minute cuts in deliveries
9744,What's that got to do with whether the UK has a de facto vaccine export ban?
9745,Why does Canada get doses manufactured in the EU and not from the UK?
9746,Feel free to wear them as much as you like.
9747,"If you have to leave the house when you have the flu then sure wear them, but hopefully this virus helped change the hero culture at work."
9748,Ideally people start using sick days now.
9749,What does that mean?
9750,"I agree that a second dose is needed, but the first dose efficacy level after 21 days is fantastic."
9751,"I agree, but it also seems to jive with ""excess"" death figures so it is in the ballpark."
9752,You‚Äôre more than welcome to mask up as you see fit.
9753,Just don‚Äôt try to force it on others.
9754,Some of us hate masks and don‚Äôt want to wear them.
9755,"Not a good trajectory to be on, is it?"
9756,Which route are you talking about?
9757,I don't really understand your post.
9758,I absolutely agree.
9759,Especially hearing about vaccine sites turning down people because of some minor discrepancy in their eligibility.
9760,"It‚Äôs counterproductive really, if there‚Äôs someone there to get vaccinated, vaccinate them!"
9761,That‚Äôs one less person that will contract covid so in hindsight it still protects the old peeps.
9762,"But then again, Fauci knows more blah blah, just doesn‚Äôt make sense not offering vaccines to everyone right now."
9763,"The more people vaccinated the better, no matter the age because the virus is still gonna circulate."
9764,My sister was vaccinated yesterday and only asked for ID and if she was there for professional or medical.
9765,No proof of her comorbidity.
9766,We've unfortunately spent the last year telling ourselves that wearing a mask is literally zero burden.
9767,It's a really divisive issue that's become extremely politicized unfortunately.
9768,"Avanti was bought by Croda in July 2020

9769,CNN is sweating.
9770,Exactly.
9771,The mandates are stupid - we don‚Äôt need them.
9772,The invisible hand works.
9773,"Just like people go down the road to another if they don‚Äôt need a mask, others won‚Äôt go to that business if they don‚Äôt feel comfortable."
9774,you know breaking a contract can get you sued right?
9775,"if AZ cannot show they did their best efforts to fulfill the EU contract, whilst maintaining other contracts then the will be massively sued."
9776,add in huge possible punative damages for causing deaths AZ might not survive.
9777,so can you explain why AZ would take this route?
9778,I'm not really sure if we're still talking about the same things??
9779,You asked who had wanted to get vaccines from the UK plants.
9780,And the whole conflict between AZ and the EU of Januar/Februar was that the EU had hoped to get exactly that.
9781,If you look at my earlier replies I don't even contest that the UK is in their right to not allow exports from their AZ plants.
9782,"Just that I see it as the same thing as an export ban because it has the same result as a ban would have, you apparently think it's very different because it's not officially a ban and because theoretical, non-existing  vaccines would be allowed to be exported."
9783,Let's agree to disagree.
9784,"Anyway, was a good procrastination during my work day."
9785,"I really, really don't think we have the research to say that's the case."
9786,It's believed that it extends the immunity but we really don't know that.
9787,"It's pretty well known that it increases the immunity, but it's really not by that much."
9788,I hope it really extends the immunity because otherwise we're not using those second doses as well as we could.
9789,Alaska has a very key advantage.
9790,"Native American reservations receive their own special vaccine allotments from the federal government, and Alaska‚Äôs Native American population is the highest per capita in the US."
9791,So they‚Äôve done incredibly well but keep that in mind before giving somewhere like Wyoming flack

9793,Yes.

9798,I got my first Moderna dose over the weekend and I had terrible pain whenever I slightly moved my arm.
9799,"Couldn't sleep overnight, kept waking up in pain."
9800,The CDC says taking pain relievers is OK after the shot (not before).
9801,"Tylenol made it go from painful to sore, and it felt normal sore without Tylenol by the next night."
9802,But I haven't heard of anyone else with arm pain that bad so it's probably pretty unlikely!
9803,I'm a rock climber so I'm wondering if it's related to having a lot of muscle in that area.
9804,"I think while vaccine supply is increasing, healthcare nurse workforce isn't, at least in some EU  countries, maybe that is the case in USA also?"
9805,This is just my guess.
9806,Since we citizens cannot shoot ourselves up with the vaccine.....
9807,"This is so dumb, I‚Äôm in SC and have an appointment next week."

9814,Why not?
9815,People have to pay less than a dollar for it.
9816,Would be great to have all those locations.
9817,"Just be aware, if your state is taking a longer time to lower eligibility requirements, that may also be a good thing."
9818,It might mean your state has much lower vaccine hesitancy
9819,A metaphorical yet effective example of divide and conquer.
9820,"Such as lipids used to make the Pfizer vaccine, no one mentions that though!"
9821,We wouldn't have any of these problems if the last president didn't politicize facemasks.
9822,"The fact that the biggest argument is not wearing a facemask when the pandemic is still ongoing is akin to saying ""seatbelts or shoes inhibit our freedom."""
9823,And the worst part is that most already forgot about the failing of ERCOT.
9824,"The governor &amp; his party already washed their hands of doing anything to the electric grid, &amp; the plan is to throw ERCOT management under a bus &amp; call it a day."
9825,I can safely bet that the grid will fail in another natural disaster before 2032 as it failed in 2021 &amp; on 2011!
9826,"And people will either die or lose personal property (burning furniture to stay warm, or burn down their house as a result)."
9827,Got the J and J vaccine last night.
9828,Woke up this morning and I got bad chills body aches and a headache.
9829,But before I even got the vaccine I felt like I was coming down with a cold or something.
9830,I had mild body aches and a headache.
9831,Is it possible that a previous cold intensified my side effects?
9832,Thanks

9870,Not to mention considering a year ago it was considered a vaccine was 12-18 months away- and year later today we are approaching a quarter of all eligible Americans being vaccinated with three highly effective vaccines available.

9887,The fact is though that the current Pfizer production line relies on lipids and a few other things coming from the UK.

9936,Ah shit.
9937,Here we go again.
9938,but like the previous 2-3 days  there were no deliveries seems like it that 7 million is a bulk drop off not a consistent daily routine
9939,The supermarkets around me stated they'll follow the governors orders to stop mask wearing mandates.
9940,And then people wonder exactly why the US became full of vehement anti maskers?
9941,"It's shit like this, reopening plans that have no mention of removing masks and distancing, that drives people to conspiratorial thinking."
9942,Where is Amarillo?
9943,"My government didn't put trades/construction on the essential list for vaccines, but we were essential the whole time for working."
9944,And somehow data and telecom as well as finance made it on there... fuck me is guess lol
9945,"&gt; a very high native population

..OK?"
9946,For which one?
9947,And seals and killer whales.
9948,This is exactly what Canada is doing.
9949,Uncanny parallel.
9950,But Pfizer are using Croda for lipids amongst a few other things as the contract states.
9951,"Go to Amarillo, it's open availability."
9952,No residency requirements.
9953,Would be a good way to lose business IMO.
9954,"Once case numbers are way down and everyone who wants a vaccine can have one, people are not going to want to go to stores anymore that require masks"
9955,What states?
9956,"Florida has a huge elderly population, but it actually ranks 36th in nursing home residents per capita."
9957,"Nursing homes are, of course, where the most deadly spread has been."
9958,"When you account for that and consider they were relatively unscathed in the first wave before anyone knew how to treat it, Florida's mortality numbers are honestly pretty bad."
9959,"Not as bad as Arizona, though."
9960,I feel like we need to stop loosening restrictions with all theae new variants.
9961,All states should do this.
9962,Remove the barriers.
9963,Those who are in the high risk groups should already be on a waitlist and thus will still be ahead.
9964,But America has no centralized database so how do they have any idea how many people with conditions are left to be vaccinated that want to be vaccinated?
9965,"Answer, they don't."
9966,So at this point open it up.
9967,"&gt;""That's three, four hard months now: March, April, May, June,"" Merkel said in a public digital conversation with aid and crisis line workers."
9968,"After that, the effects of vaccination will become clear, Merkel said."
9969,"""Then it will get significantly better, but right now every day is difficult."
9970,"You can see that in everyone's face."""
9971,"Spring makes some things easier, she said, but also makes people feel the restrictions more."

9973,I mean things like business travel and things.

9975,Hopefully this can be the end of the EU spouting shite.
9976,Nightclubs?
9977,"X

9978,"X

9979,X Banned from Scotland till the end of time.
9980,Canadians have their own version of the vaccine.
9981,This has been a stressful time
9982,Good old Pennsylvania.
9983,Highest taxes; worst infrastructure.
9984,We‚Äôre on Balto 4 at this point.
9985,They made some (terrible) sequels already.
9986,Fly out to Amarillo.
9987,"It's got open availability, just walk up."
9988,Yeah but it‚Äôs not as drastic of a difference as people act like.
9989,60% had systemic side effects with does 1 whereas 80% had them with dose 2 IIRC.
9990,"We should have seen a 50-80% drop in CFR and HFR by now from having vaccinated most of the elderly, but we have not."
9991,"Seasonality and strain differences could account for some of this, though some of it is that we can't determine CFR very precisely for recent infections."
9992,Deaths lag far behind cases.
9993,"If B.1.1.7 is 40% of Florida cases ""now"" then that's as of 2 weeks ago."
9994,"But the deaths we're seeing ""now"" are from infections of 4 weeks ago, when B.1.1.7 was only 10% of cases."
9995,Vaccinations were also lower then of course; tracking CFR over time can't be done without accounting for the difference in timelines.
9996,yeah maybe we should start giving more to other states instead of to alaska seeing as they are way ahead of everyone else
9997,After all these years I now finally get the movie fight club

10010,Meeting the 10 mio doses for an entire quarter just isn't anything to boast about.
10011,AZ underdelivered but they were initally promising 90+ Mio.
10012,We all are going to have to stay inside for longer because of the idiots going to these events and morons like Abbot removing restrictions too early.
10013,Ok but why don't they just deliver more equally to the countries who have already ordered enough for everybody?
10014,"I doubt any of their ""costumers"" would mind getting their dosis earlier."

10019,Which is a fact.

10021,Get the vaccine.
10022,He's absolutely right just like he has been about everything regarding COVID.
10023,"Again, just because the facts are challenging doesn't make him wrong."
10024,It just means you don't understand or reject facts for feelings.
10025,It's been really heartening to see nursing home deaths plummet in countries all over the world regardless of their cases.
10026,"I read somewhere that even in Sao Paulo, with all the misery going on throughput Brazil at the moment, nursing home deaths have fallen by something like 70% in the last month."
10027,"&gt;I can't disagree with that premise, but the opportunity for the US to do that was in January 2020."
10028,"Arguably, it was too late even by then."
10029,It's likely COVID was widely circulating [before most people had even heard of it](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/01/940395651/coronavirus-was-in-u-s-weeks-earlier-than-previously-known-study-says).
10030,There was no way COVID was staying out.
10031,Right.
10032,I get all that.
10033,"I am just saying, I don't think a regular guy on the street knows or cares about the details."
10034,All they care about is vaccine producers in Europe are exporting vaccines while there are shortages in Europe.
10035,I wouldn't be surprised if some sort of unrest happens.
10036,I hope not
10037,I was gunnu make a smarmy joke about how no one lives there but I'm more educated after checking and for 730k+ population that's pretty cool

10042,"&amp;nbsp;

For example, the AIDS epidemic is often described as wiping out ‚Äòan entire generation‚Äô of gay men."
10043,Because in places like The Village in NYC it basically did.
10044,I don‚Äôt understand why those who chose to live an unhealthy lifestyle are priority for vaccines.
10045,Sensationalizing that the vaccine goes from not effective to fully effective suddenly 2 weeks after the second shot causes mistrust and more confusion.
10046,Just tell it to people straight.
10047,Vaccines start to demonstrate effectiveness a few days after the first shot and build toward peak effectiveness two weeks after the 2nd.
10048,It is not that complicated or difficult to communicate.
10049,"It looks like the places that have the lowest vax rates and the highest percent positive and new cases are predominantly Arab, Bedouin, and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas."
10050,"So likely it's vax hesitation combined with low adherence to mask wearing and social distancing, whether voluntarily or from large families in small apartments due to poverty."
10051,It‚Äôs great that you did that for him.
10052,Yet the EU didn‚Äôt sign a contract giving them the rights to those vaccines.
10053,And now are clearly regretting their actions.
10054,"Right, when people are super vocal about how they're not scared of covid and they aren't worried about getting it what I hear is ""I'm not worried about giving it to others""."
10055,Because worrying about getting covid is kind of the first prerequisite to worrying about giving covid.
10056,They've got nothing to export since the entire tiny supply has been purchased
10057,Is it possible that the demand for the populations it's currently available to is lessening?
10058,Perhaps they need to extend it to more people now because the US has more than enough doses to go around daily
10059,"i think he means that he‚Äôs living with someone who is an anti-vaxxer, who thinks that bill gates put nanobots into the vaccine"
10060,The private sector.
10061,I don‚Äôt understand what the hold up is.
10062,Why isn‚Äôt everywhere that administers flu shots also administering this vaccine?
10063,They‚Äôve ramped up from 0 to millions of doses in under a year.
10064,It‚Äôs one of the most impressive manufacturing efforts ever.
10065,Acting as if bottlenecks are some unexpected thing makes no sense.
10066,Austin‚Äôs population boom is incredibly recent.
10067,Also most people don‚Äôt realize how big San Antonio is because it doesn‚Äôt have sky scrapers.
10068,Omg üòÖ
10069,"It's still crazy that in around this time last year (NBA being suspended, Trump's stupid rant, School closures) we were hopeless."

10071,He is just following the recommendations of basically every doctor.
10072,Yes.
10073,Frankly that sounds more like a reporting lag than an administration lag to me.
10074,It's so much higher than the average administration lag that I might say I find it unbelievable.
10075,Because they are more likely to die from it.
10076,The vaccine isn‚Äôt a reward or a punishment.
10077,Misleading title.
10078,There are still eligibility requirements.
10079,You have to fly your bush plane 150 miles to the nearest provider and wrestle the bear guarding the shots.
10080,He thinks the government is tricking us to grab power for something he claims is more like a cold than the flu.
10081,At least that‚Äôs the current thinking.
10082,Before it was just that masks are for pussies.
10083,"If everyone wore their masks without question, stopped partying like idiots, we would not be in this big of a situation."
10084,It is literally basic multiplication.
10085,I am hoping that Israel ends up as an outlier with their case rate despite high % of vaccinations.
10086,"Also hope it drops soon, it is just meandering down."
10087,Hire a fucking army of them and you'll be the next Bezos!
10088,"Eh, I think we‚Äôre getting very close to the point where this outlook is just being needlessly overcautious."
10089,Just a month or two ago I would have wholeheartedly agreed with you.
10090,"Saying that the vaccine reaches ""full effect"" is not exactly the same as what you're describing."
10091,"I think you are overreaching a bit on the messaging angle here, no offense."
10092,"Also, we're better off advising people too strongly to hold off for 15 days, versus not having strong enough messaging."
10093,"""Wait 15 days"" is an actionable thing."
10094,"""You are gaining a bit more immunity each day until full effect at day 15"" is really more likely to confuse people and doesn't tell them how to act on the info, even if the accuracy is higher."
10095,14 days is the point at which the vaccine and placebo group data points began to diverge.
10096,There is no noticeable difference before that.
10097,"Therefore, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that there is some protection at 14 days, but not safe to assume there is ‚Äúa lot.‚Äù Varying sources and data suggest that at the 4 week mark protection could be as high as 92%, though not necessarily."
10098,"Edit: diverge, not converge"
10099,"If those plants are so plentiful and manufacturers have their choice, how come they produce so little ?"
10100,Have you by chance already had Covid?
10101,"I ask because I've read that for people who have, the first shot is the one that really kicks your ass."
10102,"If not, maybe reach out to your GP?"
10103,"They keep saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to ramp up, it‚Äôs going to ramp up.‚Äù Still slow as balls"
10104,Dear European Regulators and Public: Look to the UK.
10105,They have vaccinated millions with hardly any issues and with great results.
10106,Truly a stellar product.
10107,Dear AZ: Now deliver the vaccines you promised to the EU.
10108,Between 30 and 100 per cent?
10109,That broad a range doesn't inspire much confidence in the study.
10110,I dont think people can do it anymore.
10111,Or rather they dont want to do it.
10112,"I think  numbers are going to surge, and nothing will happen legislatively."
10113,Yeah but apparently only 458k total j&amp;j have been administered despite 3.6M delivered
10114,30 to 100% is a big range.
10115,"&gt;In the UK study, published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, infection with the new variant led to 227 deaths in a sample of 54,906 COVID-19 patients, compared with 141 among the same number of patients infected with other variants."
10116,"&gt;‚ÄùCoupled with its ability to spread rapidly, this makes B.1.1.7 a threat that should be taken seriously,"" said Robert Challen, a researcher at Exeter University who co-led the research."
10117,I'm going to hire an Eastern European wet nurse who's been vaccinated.
10118,It wouldn't shock me if that was the case either because some different measure was used or I misremembered.
10119,"You say yes would have both cases (assuming it was indeed widely drunk by all then)

My understanding was that it was always close between the two countries in particular but one of the issues London always faced was disease becoming critical around those numbers."
10120,Anyone wanting to get vaccinated where eligibility is still restricted might want to check with the local organizations performing the vaccinations to see if they're offering appointments for extra/unused doses.
10121,"Where I live, the organizations doing the vaccinations are having daily ""extra"" appointments and encouraging people of any group to sign up for them so that the dose isn't wasted."
10122,I haven't read that but it doesn't really matter tbh.
10123,2 weeks after dose one you already get like 85% effectiveness.
10124,people worrying too much about the tiniest of details.
10125,How can you make an analogy that is so completely fucking disconnected from reality that it's more like a fairytale than anything else.
10126,The EU's contract was signed over 6 months ago now.
10127,"According to your dumb little story, that's enough, yet AZ still only managed to give 10% of the order."
10128,"I don't care what blame you shove onto the EU, but don't for a single second try to convince me that AZ is a reliable company."
10129,First thing that came to my mind lol
10130,"I imagine the problem right now is that there aren't much vaccination centers open, there are quite a few testimonials on this sub that senior citizens are still unable to get the shot, so the demand for that age group is certainly still there, just need to expand and have more people involved so more and more can get vaccinated."
10131,"The USA is getting 4 million a day, they should at least do 3 million on average by now"
10132,A second really low day for CA vaccinations in a row.
10133,137K doses.
10134,Wonder what's up.
10135,"I'm not saying this is a good idea because it's frankly a complete and total guess, but I wonder if pharmacies and other administration sites could address this by saying ""If you show up past appointment hours and we have thawed doses that went unused, we'll give them to you."""
10136,Then the people who get them could have their second dose scheduled then and there.
10137,That could introduce its own problems but I'm wondering if a direct and broadly planned use of unused doses could help.
10138,It also depends a lot on area in the state.
10139,My grandparents in rural northern WI were fully vaccinated before my wife's grandma near Madison could get her first shot.
10140,Here in Pennsylvania we had one of our biggest snowstorms on record in early February with 2-3 feet of snow in many areas.
10141,Vaccine appointments got delayed a few days but otherwise it was business as usual.
10142,"""American big pharma""."
10143,The world's leading vaccine was developed by a European company.
10144,&gt;We need it now.
10145,You'll wait your turn.
10146,Stay locked down forever buddy.
10147,"Can't find links in English for now, Google translate should work decently:
https://www.hs.fi/hyvinvointi/art-2000007851762.html (vaccines won't change anything)
https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000007851320.html (PM's comments)"
10148,so how does that change the fact that they get more per capita and theyre ahead of everyone else?
10149,shouldnt the state start getting less because of these two reasons
10150,distribution numbers are a lot harder to find.
10151,"We should see about 80-90M more in the month of march, which would be distribution average of ~4M per day."
10152,"We are still lagging a bit in administration, since 7 day moving average is less than that, and a lot of JnJ was administraered last week."
10153,"It isn't that big of a deal today, but if it continues to lag next week we should be screaming about it."
10154,explain what you mean by this
10155,&gt;J&amp;J reported efficacy at 4 weeks post-inoculation.
10156,"This was likely way too early, as antibody levels don't peak until about 50 days

That's not a rule."
10157,4 weeks is when the efficacy after the first shot is plateuing.
10158,Pfizer data from Israel showed that.
10159,"In any case, that's data we have, but as a general rule, it usually doesn't take more than 4 weeks for efficacy to approach its peak."
10160,That's definitely the impression that these viral vector vaccine publications give.
10161,"&gt;The 2-dose trial is also spacing out the shots 8 weeks, not 12 weeks."
10162,Didn't know that.
10163,I read somewhere that it was 12 weeks.
10164,Okay.
10165,They're still postponing the second dose and you only see that with viral vector vaccines.
10166,"&gt;giving a 2nd dose too early for the Oxford vaccine actually LOWERED efficacy (55%

That's actually really weird."
10167,AZ's results amd cohorts were broken by too many variables for any of them to be statistically significant enough.
10168,"Given the results from AZ, where the second dose even after 12 weeks barely had any effect (76-&gt;81%), it's only right to *assume* or *expect* that the second dose of the JnJ one won't have much effect."
10169,Maybe even the reason they opted for a one dose regimen to begin with.
10170,"After all, Sputnik V is being praised for its design for a reason."
10171,"AstraZeneca agreed to examine using one of Sputnik V's shots for a second dose for a reason (or for the first dose, I think)."
10172,It's just the reality of viral vector vaccines.
10173,Ohio drops to 50 tomorrow
10174,Went to mall a few days ago.
10175,"Nobody gives a shit, it was full everywhere."
10176,Hope I dont get covid.
10177,*cough*
10178,"Yes, but those will be delivered very late only."
10179,They're not in play yet.
10180,Tell that to Ireland you melt.
10181,If nobody ever died 4 days after taking the vaccine you could be immortal just by taking the vaccine every day.
10182,"Whoa Black Betty

&gt; two antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab"
10183,Probably novavax first.
10184,Mexico seconds this.
10185,"Essentially, yes."
10186,"Because that's the thing with restrictions - once they're lifted, there's going to be a rise in the ""risky"" behavior that caused the restrictions in the first place."
10187,"Maybe if we were dealing with a virus that wasn't so easily transmissible it'd be one thing, but when you consider how much COVID spreads in households or at workplace environments, I don't think there were any parties or large gatherings in the world that impacted the length of the restrictions"
10188,This is why I use PPO.
10189,"In the past, the DoI has been considered a guiding parameter for the Constitution."
10190,"But, one only has to look at the Preamble of the Constitution to find that it secures the right of liberty:

""""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."""
10191,"And, no the right to liberty is not less important than the right to protest nor go to church."
10192,"It is a fundamental right that when violated by the government, the court's view said violations under strict scrutiny."
10193,"Thus, when a court finds that a law infringes a fundamental constitutional right, it may apply the strict scrutiny standard to nevertheless hold the law or policy constitutionally valid if the government can demonstrate in court that the law or regulation is necessary to achieve a ""compelling state interest""."
10194,"The government must also demonstrate that the law is ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve the compelling purpose, and uses the ""least restrictive means"" to achieve the purpose."
10195,Failure to show these conditions may result in a judge striking down a law as unconstitutional.
10196,"*

As most law students know if a court uses strict scrutiny language in the decision, it almost assuredly means the court is about to strike down that law."
10197,Court's very rarely finds instances where the government has a compelling state interest and has narrow tailored the law to fit that state interest and that there is likely less restrictive means to achieve that purpose.
10198,*I fully admit I pulled this from Wiki because I am too lazy to type out the answer.
10199,Good theory I‚Äôll look at that instead
10200,I know you‚Äôre right.
10201,"I think here in Florida, the media reports on the problems and hic ups so much that it creates an impression of so much incompetence that the vaccine is trickling out."
10202,I understand what that you're trying to make an analogy.
10203,I just don't think it's a relevant analogy to the discussion at hand.
10204,Who is Canada in your analogy?
10205,I got the pneumonia vaccine earlier this year.
10206,My arm literally fell off and I had to staple it back on.
10207,"Not really, but it was so sore I could not move it for 1 week."
10208,"That said, it beat the pneumonia I had twice in the past 2 years."
10209,"The point is that 4 million is not a lot for Pfizer to produce, regardless where it's going."
10210,"Much of the deal with Alaska is that tribal health organizations get their own vaccine allotments regardless of what goes on at the state level, and they've been well prepared to received and distribute those to the population with by far the largest native component of any state."
10211,Same in Mississippi it‚Äôs the Wild West.
10212,Smoking is a pre existing condition so everybody I know who has smoked in the last 3 years is trying to get one.
10213,I got my first does and got asked zero questions about anything and it was free to boot.
10214,I think it is important to note that California has been having data latency issues in updating for the past two/three days so these counts are probably short by a couple hundred thousand.
10215,Still indicative of a need to lower limits but something to keep in mind.
10216,i guess i'm not nihilist to think that our actions have no impact on the virus
10217,i.e.
10218,the town itself is a social distance bubble.
10219,And if someone had traveled and gotten infected half the town would have gotten it.
10220,There‚Äôs nothing you can do as far as I‚Äôm aware.
10221,From experience it‚Äôs best to get the shot on your non dominant arm.
10222,Tbh it‚Äôs barely above last Wednesday.
10223,"1.9M vs 2.0M

Supply is increasing exponentially."
10224,What is it going to take for administration to keep up?
10225,Link?
10226,[removed]
10227,"That depends entirely on the state, I think we'll see some lower it this and next week."

10242,Except the requirement of being older than 16...
10243,"Seriously, headline writers, do you even stop for a moment to consider what you've just written?"
10244,I disagree.
10245,A 1% rise in 65+ group is only a 0.25% rise in the total population.
10246,It would take 400 days or well over a year to administer a single shot to everyone at that rate.
10247,We need to have that be in the 100 day range.
10248,And the resurge begins.

10257,"they have cleared 275,000 off their waiting list in a month, the total population of the county is 1 million."
10258,"of those about 230,000 are too young for the vaccine so you're looking at them knocking out 33% of eligible people in a month not counting anyone who was vaccinated before that so i'll say it's pretty much a moot point whether you get it with the group this week or when they open things up in a few days"
10259,"This is almost definitely a correlation with some other factor, most likely age."
10260,"Because kids aren't even authorized to take the vaccines yet, federal allocation of vaccine doses is based on state's adult population rather than total population, which means a state with more minors will receive a smaller share of vaccines as a ratio to its total population than a state with more adults."
10261,"Colder states tend to be more northern, and more northern states tend to be older (fewer parent-aged residents) and have smaller family sizes."
10262,I would look at % of &gt;=18 population with at least one dose instead of % of total population and see how much that changes your calculation.
10263,Exactly.
10264,But what does our media report?
10265,"""'Jaw dropping' increase: 17% more died in NC in 2020 over 2019."""
10266,The media LOVES bad news.
10267,It generates way more clicks than good news.
10268,"If I didn‚Äôt care about mild covid, long covid, or the small but real risk of being genetically vulnerable, I wouldn‚Äôt have altered my life so much over the last year."
10269,The unstated assumption in the CDC guidance for vaccinated and unvaccinated to hang out maskless indoors is that it‚Äôs ok for low risk people to risk contracting covid as data about risk from the vaccinated continues to be gathered.
10270,That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt advise high risk unvaccinated people to do the same.
10271,They don‚Äôt have the data yet.

10278,Both.
10279,Neither have released US results yet.
10280,We have a democrat governor in WI and there's also a shortage in the cities (that vote blue) compared to rural areas.
10281,I don't think it's fair to assume a governor is favoring rural people for political reasons via vaccine distribution.
10282,It seems to be common across at least a handful of states regardless of governor.
10283,The variants are learning and becoming resistant to the vaccines /s
10284,Well that's Pfizer.

10291,"That‚Äôs interesting to know, I‚Äôm going to check and update my info accordingly."
10292,The Baltimore Sun (a week ago) stated that slightly less than a quarter of the 2 million people who are currently eligible (phases 1a&amp;1b) have been vaccinated/received first dose.

10329,"&gt;EU is just a customer, and one without exclusivity or priority, who were late to the game."
10330,"The EU signed the AZ contract a day before the UK did ‚Äì the EU signed its APA on 27 August 2020, the UK signed its own Supply Agreement for AZD1222 on 28 August 2020."
10331,"If you're going to argue that ""Sure, but the UK entered into negotiations earlier"" ‚Äì maybe yes, maybe no."
10332,But the EU contract did not happen in a day either.
10333,"And if you're going to go with ""but the UK funded AZ plants on its soil"" ‚Äì yeah, sure."
10334,"But AZ already had manufacturing capacity in the EU, and it's not like they are a start-up that requires funding, they're a multinational pharma company with billions of dollars in revenue ‚Äì anyway, their contract with the EU pretty much says that all the doses are to be delivered at no loss to AZ, meaning that the EU was willing to cover unexpected additional costs."
10335,"If you're going to argue that the EU contract is based on ""best efforts"" ‚Äì so is the UK contract."
10336,They both contain the same language.
10337,"The payment terms are redacted in the UK contract, but we know for a fact that the EU paid nearly $400 million for its doses, including 66% within the first 5 days from signing the contract to ensure stockpiling."
10338,"We also know that AZ promised delivery of 80 million doses by the end of Q1, then applied late for approval, then just before the approval happened they cut down the initial delivery plan to 31 million, and they fail to deliver even that."
10339,"And yeah, the EU is a customer."
10340,"AZ got money in advance for producing a vaccine to be delivered by a given date, and their ""best reasonable efforts"" clause says that they are supposed to do whatever a company their size, standing, position, and with similar assets would do in this situation."
10341,Meaning - they can buy it from SII or outsource production to deliver what they were paid for.
10342,"It doesn't mean that they can just cross their arms and claim ""guys, we're really trying, but we have problems"" ‚Äì while they do not have problems stockpiling 50 million doses for the US, which did not even approve their vaccine‚Ä¶"
10343,90+ million doses administered in the US alone.
10344,"Yes, sometimes someone is going to die after getting the vaccine."
10345,Just as someone might die after watching TV.

10351,"I can only speak for Missouri because I'm here, but look at the map of where vaccines are available: https://www.vaccinespotter.org/MO/

The areas around Kansas City have a few locations with appointments available, but they are typically swooped up quickly."
10352,St. Louis has essentially none.
10353,And then all over the rural areas there's available appointments.
10354,"And it's not just that there's a few available appointments, there's a LOT of available appointments."
10355,"Take for instance this Walmart in Mount Vernon, MO."
10356,"Here's the available appointment list there: https://i.imgur.com/Tje47LE.png

There's essentially time slots available all day."
10357,But we have the urban areas like KC and STL who have bare bones shots available and are filling up all of their slots.
10358,The state needs to a) Open it up to anyone who can get a shot and/or b) Re-allocate the location of the shots to places where they are being used entirely.
10359,"It's just really frustrating to see that I could drive 1.5 hours to Chillicothe and get a shot tomorrow if I was in this tier, but I'm restricted from going and they aren't filling up there slots."

10398,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
10399,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

10403,That's fair.
10404,I guess I should have clarified that there have been other instances where they have and still concluded that the vaccine played no role.

10419,"In science, there are no absolutes."
10420,How can you definitely say drinking water won‚Äôt kill you two days later?
10421,"However, we did do clinical trials that showed the death rate between placebo and vaccine groups was fairly similar."
10422,We can also compare the general mortality rate of the public to mortality rates of vaccinated people.
10423,"Again, this will give evidence that the vaccines don‚Äôt increase deaths, not that an individual‚Äôs death was definitely not caused by the vaccine."
10424,"There‚Äôs a good argument to be made that because the US had such awful COVID spread, we were able to gauge the effectiveness of the vaccines faster, and thus, approve and release them faster."
10425,I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs fair ‚Äî I basically think there‚Äôs no way to do this fairly.

10438,"Corruption and people involved in politics and those in charge of conducting the trial were given money from China and gave themselves 3 doses of sinopharm's vaccine:

A news reporter got the preliminary data for vaccine efficacy of Sinopharm's and everyone called it fake news."
10439,"Then, the head responsible for the trial said it was true

I'm going to translate this for you:
Esto luego de que un programa local se√±alara que, seg√∫n el estudio de la Universidad Cayetano Heredia y de la San Marcos, la vacuna de la cepa de Wuhan tiene solo el 33% de eficacia y la vacuna de la cepa de Beijing tiene el 11.5%."
10440,"This commentary is after a local news station reporter that, according to Cayetano Heredia University's and San Marcos' vaccine study, the inactivated Wuhan strain only had 33% and the inactivated Beijing strain only had 11%(which is actually the other way around)."
10441,"Then, after public health ministers and congressmen, who had already received the vaccine back in September, said it was fake, the head of the clinical study said it was true."
10442,"https://gestion.pe/peru/upch-sobre-ensayos-clinicos-de-sinopharm-la-informacion-difundida-es-preliminar-upch-coralith-garcia-nndc-noticia/

And there's the bombshell that the people in charge of that study knew the low efficacy and had a third dose as early as the end of November:
https://convoca.pe/agenda-propia/vacunagate-quienes-son-las-40-personas-que-recibieron-tres-dosis-anticovid-19-fuera

Pretty much, the whole thing is corruption."
10443,Sinopharm's chinese embassador served as an agent to sell the vaccine to Peru and they hired media to prop up.

10458,Grim and aggressively wrong!
10459,Trying to definitively say anything about it makes no sense since they haven‚Äôt done an autopsy yet.
10460,Getting my first shot later tonight.
10461,"Really looking forward to it of course, but at the same time not just because I had covid already and it seems like the first shot really kicks your ass if you already had it"
10462,Jesus.
10463,Your argument is correct but you are forgetting the fact that people still aren't wearing masks.
10464,I am not talking about isolation or lockdown at all.
10465,"I live in a Hotspot where when I ride the bus not everyone wears one, they are all fucking brainless."
10466,"Where I work, the managers are constantly berating the employees for removing their masks and not respecting social distancing, this happens everywhere still."
10467,"Even if everyone still wore their masks we would still be in this situation, just slower like you said but if everyone was equally as strict."
10468,It never would have gotten as bad as it is.
10469,The fact that there is still an argument whether masks are effective or not just fucking proves that people are too stupid to survive a global pandemic.
10470,Then there's the people who literally just don't care about it and break the covid guidelines regardless.
10471,"this attitude is not going away anytime soon, and neither is covid thanks to them."
10472,Detroit will be utilizing Johnson and Johnson in their next wave of vaccines.

10480,We should see a sharper fall in deaths with vaccine rollout.
10481,Either the most high risk are not being reached (possible) or something is happening to make it deadlier (also possible).
10482,"EDC Vegas in mid May is still on, last I checked"
10483,"&gt;If J&amp;J follows a similar pattern, it means the one-shot would likely approach mid 70's after two months."
10484,Mid 70's is imaginable.
10485,80% is as well.
10486,That's all I'm saying.
10487,4 weeks definitely is enough.
10488,50 days is really excessive.

10642,This is something I wonder about too.
10643,We all know a person or two who are hyper paranoid about the virus and I honestly just can't envision them ever not being afraid of it even if a single person on earth still had it.
10644,I too would like to know how low cases would have to be for everyone to forget about the whole thing and carry on with normal pre-pandemic life.

10648,Then they changed it to 75.
10649,Then to 70... Fucking snail's pace.
10650,TX on the other hand will vaccinate smokers and obese people (that has to be like 50% of adults) and I still see a few slots open every so often.
10651,I would expect 40 of 50 states to not have any eligibility requirements by April 15.
10652,There‚Äôs a lot of nuance in these numbers.

10654,Reasonable people know what Texas is doing is not safe.
10655,I‚Äôm also seeing widespread skepticism that the government and the pharma companies will actually deliver on vaccines in the numbers promised ‚Äî respondents likely expect to continue masking and social distancing for many more months because they don‚Äôt really believe they‚Äôll be vaccinated before then.

10793,"&gt;It's likely to show increased efficacy

That's speculation."
10794,They are testing out a 12 week interval (within which no one in the real world will get the second dose.......).
10795,That tells you that they are designing the study similarly to AstraZeneca.
10796,AZ's second dose increases efficacy by only a few % points (76 -&gt; 81%).
10797,Ramasay et al mentions the idea of immunity to vectors being the reason for the second dose's low efficacy.
10798,"That is very likely to happen to JnJ as well, because, just like AZ, their second dose would use the exact same vector as the first dose."
10799,We're lucky to have multiple vaccines to compare data and design.
10800,Sputnik V uses two different vectors and has efficacy of 92%.
10801,The doses are given 3 weeks apart.
10802,AZ and JnJ most likely opted for the 12 week regimen precisely because of the immunity to vectors - it goes away (to a small degree) after 12 weeks.
10803,"When deaths drop to 100 per day, which is roughly the rate for the flu."
10804,"You still take precautions for the flu, but you don‚Äôt stop living."
10805,I think that‚Äôs the turning point.
10806,I think they are not approved *yet*.

10808,The EU?
10809,Remember Februar?
10810,Yeah the governor of MN thought we could see it be open to everyone in maybe 6 weeks or even quicker depending on the supply.
10811,Many medical experts in Canada are advising against it.
10812,It is generally considered medically unethical to go against the dosing instructions from pharmaceutical developers in order to look better politically ...
10813,Just got a notification that a show (Impractical Jokers tour) I was supposed to attend this August has been moved to April 2022.
10814,By the time I can go I‚Äôll have had the tickets for over two years!
10815,It‚Äôs insane.
10816,They were originally booked for August 2020.
10817,But we should be fine by next April and I‚Äôd much rather enjoy a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù live show.
10818,If you want it badly enough make an appointment with a rural pharmacy in a state with thats open to more than the elderly within driving distance
10819,I got it yesterday morning.
10820,My arm was absolutely fine
10821,"Sorry, yes I said donate but I wouldn‚Äôt have expected it to be a donation to Canada."
10822,We are talking about the same thing...opening up production for Canada and Mexico.
10823,There isn‚Äôt a single study suggesting that you get the *full* effects of the vaccine 14 days after the first dose.
10824,That‚Äôs when you would expect to *start* seeing an effect.
10825,Thanks.
10826,I always thought the news ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù so to speak was the most reliable.
10827,Bad assumption on my part.
10828,Lol how is that at all what you got from their comment?
10829,This sub is weird man.
10830,"People are just being cautious and want to ask questions, yet it somehow turns into ""YOU LOVE BEING LOCKED DOWN"" or ""WHY DO YOU WANT THE VIRUS TO WIN"""
10831,"Not gonna lie... it felt good donating all my old ""fat"" clothes."
10832,Plus I'm too cheap to buy them again which should help me keep the weight off.
10833,It makes logistics a bit harder as I probably will be in another state before flying up to Alaska.
10834,I wonder how stores will manage people with masks and people without masks now
10835,"Honestly, I know a lot of bikers."
10836,My dad is/was one and used to play music at biker rallies.
10837,"That makes up a good portion of that crowd, but less than you'd probably think."
10838,Plenty of retirees in what amounts to weekend cosplay.
10839,Keep Austin weird...and safe!
10840,It's almost here folks.
10841,"I'm sure once states start opening up the vaccine line it will be a cluster, but it's going to be the countdown to the end and I AM HERE FOR IT."
10842,&gt;  I live in the UK and all I see is how they keep coming up with BS to make the lockdown even further.
10843,What rule has changed recently?
10844,I think once the vaccine is available to everyone the CDC will finally say no masks needed and that will signal the end.
10845,Circa June.
10846,Does distribution mean it actual mean the virus is at the site to administer the shots or does it mean the state or local government has possession of it?
10847,I don‚Äôt know the answer to that.
10848,I think the real question is are we over allocating to these smaller states?
10849,Like ideally I think all states would be on the same progression timeline because vaccines would be divided by population each state has in each phase.
10850,Screenshot?
10851,Wow!
10852,That's a lot of weight lost!
10853,"At least with requirements expanding quickly, you might still get the vaccine sooner rather than later."
10854,"dude this tone is like the exact reason people make such a big deal out of masks

like, i can‚Äôt hear people when we‚Äôre outside cause they‚Äôre voice are muffled."
10855,not seeing facial expressions is weird as hell.
10856,"Masks suck, it‚Äôs not just a piece of cloth, it‚Äôs bullshit, it matters, and i think it‚Äôs fair to hope that they‚Äôre not normal for healthy feeling people as soon as possible"
10857,But there‚Äôs also hundreds of villages off the road which they are getting vaccine to.
10858,Adak Alaska is over 1000 miles from anchorage
10859,&gt; Good!
10860,Not a single dose should be wasted.
10861,"While well intentioned, the tier system most states have in place make less sense when vaccine supply is rapidly increasing."
10862,You can just rapidly reduce the duration of the tiers but one thing is people take a while to respond.
10863,It's an interesting problem mathematically because you don't want a tier to become idle.
10864,Note though that we're moving so fast ANYWAY that covid won't be able to rebound in a shorter window so it might just not matter.
10865,"My thinking on the subject is that we do one large tier of front line workers, anyone with medical issues, and 50 up, then open it to everyone."
10866,But we don‚Äôt have to argue about this.
10867,We can just agree to disagree.
10868,Have a good one and stay safe

10878,Ah so they did it *with* masks.
10879,How very Texas.
10880,"what do you call it when they are not allowing export of any vaccines until everyone in the US is vaccines, even though those manufacturers had contracts with many different countries?"
10881,Would you say if the EU blocked all exports of vaccines until the EU was vacintatione wouldn't be a ban?
10882,The way i see it is that the US is being selfish in a time when the world needs to come together as a hole to vacinate the country.
10883,"If the northern us power grid was knocked off, should the Canadian provinces ban exports and make sure the other provinces have power regardless of contracts?"
10884,During 9-11 Should Canada rejected all the flights blocked from landing in the US and have them all crash instead?
10885,I don't get the mentality here.
10886,I‚Äôve had both Moderna shots.
10887,They both made my arm hurt enough to wince if I tried to raise it or yelp if my husband accidentally touched it.
10888,I couldn‚Äôt sleep on that side like I usually do.
10889,Hot showers and those rice packs you put in the microwave helped a ton.
10890,Moving it as much as you can helps.
10891,"I drove home with my left arm when I usually drive with my right, etc."
10892,but the problem will be when you sit down or sleep.

10894,"12-18 hours after the shot will be the worst probably, but for everyone I know it was nearly back to normal 24-36 hours later."

10899,"&gt; if we're talking about people who are skeptical of the vaccine, should every right leaning rural pastor keep his mouth shut too?"
10900,"Honestly, yes."
10901,I think every public figure or role model who acts in ways that promote vaccine hesitancy is being deeply irresponsible.
10902,"I don't want to really say anything specific about LeBron as some sort of *racial ambassador* because I know that isn't fair to him, but I am disappointed that he is not using his power as a public figure to encourage vaccine uptake and I hope he changes his mind."
10903,Well when I ate my wife's leftover pizza she had saved for lunch the next day...my life was most definitely at risk!
10904,Remember two months ago.
10905,Early January and we were finally starting to come down from an insane surge in the US.
10906,Vaccines were only for healthcare workers and nursing homes and it was a complete mess.
10907,We were hoping to have all American adults vaccinated by the fall.
10908,Just two months later and cases are plummeting.
10909,We are hitting record vaccine numbers.
10910,Over 18% of the US population has received a dose.
10911,The first state just opened vaccines up to the general population.
10912,We will have enough doses for all US adults by the end of May.
10913,Think about what life will be like two months from now.
10914,Then think about summer.

10952,This.
10953,Based on new variants getting a little tough.
10954,It‚Äôs not just that.
10955,Look at the snapchat map and go to some medium-sized cities in the midwest or south.
10956,"Guarantee you‚Äôll see some packed clubs, live concerts, large gatherings, crowded restaurants, etc."
10957,Even when I looked in Atlanta last week there was a nightclub with hundreds of people jammed in there.
10958,It could just be a side effect of those two minority having lower life expectancy and thus lower representation in the group eligible for the vaccine.
10959,Sounds like a personal problem
10960,"Ya gotta love how the year it's been ""hahaha stupid fucking Americans"" and now that the rest of the world is failing on vaccines it's ""pwease gib us vaccine"""
10961,"As someone who has been extremely cautious during this entire pandemic, I can tell you that once my two weeks are up after I receive my second dose (or first shot if J&amp;J), the pandemic is over for me."
10962,I expect this is true of just about anyone like me.
10963,"Don't get me wrong, I'll still wear masks as long as there are mandates in place, but I'm going to do all of the things I haven't in a year - see my friends/family, travel, dine indoors, go to comedy shows, etc."
10964,i dont understand this mentality.
10965,new zealand appropriately locks down entire regions if a single case is detected.
10966,"outside of the occasional lock down every couple of months, nz is basically back to normal."
10967,"if other nations responded appropriately, we might be in similar positions."
10968,"but now because everyone was too worried about economic failure, we're juggling both record excess mortality and debilitating economic downturn."
10969,the whole idea that following guidelines to stifle infections is harmful or unnecessary is why we are in this terrible position.
10970,strange anyone would still wanna die on that hill.
10971,"&gt;We did shut schools for swine flu

Only 700 out of 130,000 schools closed for swine flu."
10972,"&gt;brain infection from flu is a lot rarer than covid

We didn't know that at the time, but we kept the vast majority of schools open anyways."
10973,It‚Äôs not lax - the system is.
10974,It‚Äôs (criterion) so strict that most people I know are in 1c yet many are already vaccinated and many more are signed up to be.
10975,My state is still in 1b.
10976,Thats not a problem of criterion- the opposite in fact.
10977,The sign up systems are a hot mess.
10978,"If this was just about timing or eligibility, he could have said that he will get it later."
10979,"If he needed to talk to his publicist first, maybe he should have done that *before* he was asked because he knew this was going to come up."
10980,"Vaccines started being administered in *December* after all, he's had plenty of time to think about this and come up with a response."
10981,What do you think would have prevented him from saying something like this?
10982,"""I plan to receive the vaccine in a few months when it's available to me."
10983,I do not plan to jump the line in front of other Americans who deserve it just as much as I do.
10984,"I encourage everyone who can to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible."""
10985,"Almost assuredly, what prevented him from saying that is he either is still on the fence about getting the vaccine right now, or he has already decided he doesn't plan on getting it, and either way he isn't encouraging other people to get it, or even to ask their doctor about it for advice."
10986,"It's basically the same response I got from my elderly neighbor who I offered to help sign up for open vaccination appointments - ""Oh I still have to think it over."""
10987,"Month and a half later, still hasn't gotten it despite ample opportunity."
10988,"She doesn't want to, but doesn't want to argue about it or get judged for it."
10989,"Which, fine, I'm sad she's putting herself at risk but she's a private mostly anonymous citizen who can make her own decisions, and so I'm going to respect her private matters and I'm *not* going to judge her or argue with her."
10990,"But that is not the person LeBron is, nor the person LeBron has said he wants to be in the past."
10991,The only way to create demand for new antibiotics is to overuse the ones we have or stop making the inexpensive ones that still work.
10992,Are there any documented cases of people developing severe disease or dying of covid after receiving the vaccine?
10993,I want to put this warning into context.
10994,My initial point (in my first post) is that people don't need to be rushing out to get some other vaccine on top of their J&amp;J dose because ENSEMBLE II is coming.
10995,To which you responded with issues with that.
10996,The same issues that would come up with the top level posts idea.
10997,So it puts us in the same place: People aren't going to be rushing out to get a dose (or two doses) of some other vaccine after having received their first dose of J&amp;J.
10998,I would hold off on laminating the cards since there are a couple extra spaces on there for more vaccine doses.
10999,I have a feeling those are reserved for potential booster doses

11003,Jansen is the developer of the medicine and is EU based.

11005,The UK does not have an expert ban.
11006,They have a tiny production capacity and their small order was enough to use up all of that capacity.
11007,There are no doses to export because they've been bought.
11008,"Again, doesn‚Äôt include JNJ vaccinations"
11009,Back up plans are fine.
11010,In EU we are using back up plans since AZ offered a third of expected doses....

11015,While that is higher than the EU average (about 9.6%) it's still woefully insufficient from the distribution we need to prevent spread.
11016,"We probably need about double that (\~40% vaccine coverage), bearing in mind that vaccines are less useful against the South African variant and the UK variant is more transmissible."
11017,A couple of weeks more of restrictions could be the difference between a 4th wave and a near elimination of cases.
11018,"Worried about that, but it'll be worth it in the long run."
11019,Luckily I work from home so I can take breaks/naps/work from bed if necessary.

11096,It‚Äôs gotten to the point I hate the game and stopped playing.
11097,So this is quite an achievement and you deserve congratulations.
11098,Herd immunity doesn't require 100%.
11099,Just enough so that any infected person is unlikely to encounter someone who isn't immune and therefore can't spread it.

11114,how fast before the chills come?
11115,There was a small data dump in Minnesota yesterday too.
11116,About 1000 cases and 138 deaths that were backlogged.
11117,Talk to your state?
11118,How does one go about doing that?
11119,"If they rapidly approve the vaccine for use in kids, those 100M doses would be useful before the fall school year."
11120,It would at least calm down the people who insist we can never send kids back to school.
11121,[removed]
11122,That was my thought too!
11123,It sounded like this 100 million wasn't part of the total due by June.
11124,It sounds like it's for the backlog for kids come September.
11125,"The vast majority of Covid cases has always produced very mild symptoms, especially in young and healthy people."
11126,You're experiencing exactly what you should expect to experience.
11127,"The issue with the pandemic is exactly that, it's a pandemic."
11128,Even if only 5% of people get very ill that's 15 million Americans hospitalized if everyone got it.
11129,"You as an individual, can rest pretty certain that you'll have no more than flu symptoms."
11130,"I've resigned to the fact that deaths from COVID-19 and its variants are an inevitability (although I do strongly believe that we'll have the ability to develop boosters that decrease the rates of severe disease and death), and I have no faith in our testing and contact tracing efforts to bring down the spread."
11131,I further have no faith in the international community to control spread and therefore further mutations.
11132,"Basically: it **will** spread, it **will** mutate, and we'd either government measures indefinitely, closed borders indefinitely, significantly ramped up testing and tracing infrastructure, etc."
11133,And I don't think any of those are feasible or even any guarantee.
11134,"I'm just walking through this logically after a year of making no progress, outside of the vaccine front."
11135,I think a lot of people over 50 (most vulnerable) will still be trying to get it in April and I don't think it's fair to open it to everyone until they get their shots.
11136,"And, arbitrary restrictions is exactly what we did from Dec to Feb and it's working out really well for those at the highest risk of hospitalization and death."
11137,It wasn't counterproductive at all.
11138,Normal will return to a country when all of its residents have had ample opportunity to be fully vaccinated and either accepted or declined the offer.
11139,"Once that has happened, there will be little to no risk of hospital overloads even if the disease spreads unchecked among the unvaccinated, and the vulnerable will be protected by their vaccines."
11140,The US is projected to have enough vaccine for everyone by the end of May.
11141,Add six weeks for it to take effect and you're looking at sometime in July.
11142,"Of the six members of my extended family who are local, three have had both shots and two of us have had one."
11143,"Once again, this is false."
11144,"They are not allowing Pfizer and Moderna (and now J&amp;J) to sell doses ordered by the US to the highest bidder, which is not the same thing at all."
11145,Second dose had me on my ass for a couple days.
11146,"I think once vaccines are available to all we‚Äôll have things organized as vaccinated people only for a couple months, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get the CDC to declare victory."

11151,Pause the video then you can mouse-hover any protein for interactions.
11152,The operation of the spike protein is truly awesome.
11153,NZ and AU have several things in common.
11154,Small populations.
11155,They are islands.
11156,They cut off ALL travel in or out.
11157,These display massive differences from other countries- it wasn‚Äôt just the lockdown that helped control the virus.
11158,Funny I just deleted an earlier post I made with the identical story.
11159,The numbers and the headline are misleading because the rolling average of two weeks goes back to include the days of low reporting when Texas was in the deep freeze.
11160,Everything was delayed then including testing snd reporting.
11161,"&gt; what do you call it when they are not allowing export of any vaccines until everyone in the US is vaccines, even though those manufacturers had contracts with many different countries?"
11162,I'd call that misinformation.
11163,"The Executive Order doesn't say no vaccines can be exported, it says vaccines ordered by the US cannot be sold to other countries (to the highest bidder for example)."
11164,"This is a contractual obligation, not a ban."
11165,"Nothing in that ED forbids, bans, or disallows Pfizer and Moderna to expand their capacities in the US and sell to other countries as long as they maintain their contractual obligations to the US."
11166,&gt;Would you say if the EU blocked all exports of vaccines until the EU was vacintatione wouldn't be a ban?
11167,That's different than what the US has done.
11168,&gt;The way i see it is that the US is being selfish in a time when the world needs to come together as a hole to vacinate the country.
11169,"If the northern us power grid was knocked off, should the Canadian provinces ban exports and make sure the other provinces have power regardless of contracts?"
11170,During 9-11 Should Canada rejected all the flights blocked from landing in the US and have them all crash instead?
11171,I don't get the mentality here.
11172,"Canada has done the same exact thing you're accusing the US of with regards to vaccines, so guilt-tripping tactics won't work here."

11179,What if they sent some to an unfriendly country to improve relations?
11180,My mom got the Pfizer and couldn‚Äôt lift her arm much for a few days.
11181,My dad got the moderna and couldn‚Äôt feel a thing.
11182,Both did the same amount of movement in general.
11183,Enough doses _available_ by the _end_ of May.
11184,But you still need to wait up to a month before the second dose.
11185,And a couple of weeks to take full effect.
11186,all 4 of them
11187,"Best effort clauses were there, and it's no secret that the biological process is risky."
11188,"Nah fuck em, just saying there is too much hype on this ‚Äústory‚Äù ."
11189,Hum yes you can.
11190,The us banned the export of all vaccines even though contracts were signed.
11191,"Restrictions were sufficient to keep infections level from early December to mid-February, but now British variant has become dominant and existing restrictions are not enough any more."
11192,Good.

11197,"I never said don‚Äôt get the J&amp;J vaccine, but I said *I* didn‚Äôt want the J&amp;J vaccine citing concerns of long-term effects and I got called anti-science, anti-vax, selfish, stupid, all sorts of crap."

11206,The State of Texas simply gave up the authority to mandate masks to county and city governments.
11207,Why is this a bad thing?
11208,Dallas City Hall was the OCP headquarters in RoboCop.
11209,"So they'd rather not vaccinate people if some of them are the ""wrong"" people?"
11210,This seems wrong.
11211,Just turn away ineligible people at the door.
11212,"California is so obsessed with ""fairness"" that it's counter productive at times."
11213,"Even the name of the program ""My Turn"" is patronizing."
11214,"I'm pretty anti-government, but I'd rather have a local government enforce a mask mandate than a state or federal government."
11215,The only people I see upset are government simps who want the state and federal government to usurp the power of more local governments with their dictates.
11216,They're pissed the more broad government isn't imposing its will on the local governments.
11217,Anywhere colonized has a history of slavery.
11218,"Also, Oregon was suppose to be a state for white utopia."
11219,Sundown towns were everywhere.
11220,Jim Crow laws were practiced in almost every state.

11222,Connecticut has a rich history of racism.
11223,That is not the south.
11224,The us blocked contracts from being full filled in Canada.
11225,"I‚Äôm our province has 50 new cases per day so the situation isn‚Äôt dire, but 20 million doses would cover the adult population as we will have 8 million soon 

The shitty part is we are slaying second doses of all vaccines up to 4 months so that everyone can get a first doses faster."
11226,If you have a surplus of 30 million doses not being injected why not make 5 million available here?
11227,The us border will not be open i till all of canad has their second dose I figure.
11228,It would buy a lot of goodwill after the past 4 years multiple frivolous trade wars.
11229,I just described the situation.
11230,"Everyone can have his own opinion, about who and how many dead or with permanent damaged health we can accept."

11232,Our country has survived worse than a few month of lockdown.
11233,"The thing is, the virus doesn't care about our feelings, about how tired or just bored we are."
11234,"If we make decisions, because we feel that it is enough and we must move on, the pandemic will not just end."
11235,It can easily get way worse.
11236,I'm doing it as hard as I can but bad things keeps happening.
11237,I don't understand
11238,I‚Äôm feeling with you.
11239,I‚Äôm a German in the US and haven‚Äôt seen any family member since 14 months.

11241,"Visiting them might not be feasible for another few months, especially since my brother and his wife won‚Äôt be vaccinated before the fall, so I still wouldn‚Äôt risk transmitting covid to them even when vaccinated earlier."

O'Roak stressed that even against virus variants, current research suggests the COVID-19 vaccine is still effective in preventing severe cases of the disease and death."
11257,"As health officials strive to achieve herd immunity, O‚ÄôRoak said the most important takeaway from their recent discoveries is the importance of staying the course, following COVID-19 safety protocols including wearing masks in public."
11258,[removed]
11259,Most counties in Texas are continuing mask mandates already.
11260,I don't see why Abbott lifting the state mandate is such a big deal.
11261,All he's done is give the power to the local governments.
11262,Why is this so bad?
11263,Yes we can kinda of (and I am mean *really* kind of) estimate that the mRNA vaccines will at least have efficacy in par with J&amp;J‚Äôs vaccine against B.1.3.5.
11264,"given that they had notably higher efficacy against the wild type

Also a quick search revealed that last years influenza vaccine was 45% effective, in other words; even J&amp;J‚Äôs 64% is loads better"
11265,More like the reckless when it comes to STD's and especially HPV.
11266,We actually have it good here in Houston.

11270,Pico's might be first.
11271,"Look, if somebody says that Trump is the sole reason for the covid deaths in US, then that's of course not true."
11272,Most countries have failed to deal with covid and if the US had a different president it would probably still not do so great.
11273,It's also not true to say that every country did equally bad and that government's or Trump's actions don't matter.
11274,There are huge differences between the countries and a lot of that comes down to the actions of the governments.
11275,The way Trump dealt (or rather didn't) with the problem is really reprehensible and certainly made the situation in US worse.
11276,The countries that did well with covid are countries that took it very seriously right from the beginning.
11277,"They tested a lot, did an intensive tracing, mandated mask wearing or limited high risk activities."
11278,In contrast look at what Trump did.
11279,He said many times that it's not a problem at all and that it will just disappear.
11280,US had the luxury that the covid started spreading there later than in Asia or Europe but did not use this advantage at all.
11281,"You were very slow with ramping up the testing, very slow with adapting mask wearing and overall very slow in reacting."
11282,The travel ban came at a point when it had little effect since at that point covid has been spreading a lot in US.
11283,What else has Trump done?
11284,The only reason why things did not end up much worse is the actions of state governments.
11285,"Most European countries have also failed, although here I think the story here is a bit different."
11286,"A big problem in Europe is that the countries are very interconnected, but governed separately."
11287,"Since EU has very little powers in health care, the response to the pandemics has not been coordinated much across EU and each country has acted individually."
11288,"This then makes it very difficult to contain the disease, although some countries have still succeeded."
11289,"Germany has in my opinion been one of the countries that dealt with the issue much better than others, but in the end they still failed to large extent."
11290,They did fare much better than US though.
11291,"Overall, I would say that Europe has also underestimated the problem both in spring and then again in the fall when the second wave came."
11292,"Last year, the kids came back to college after spring break and they came back with covid."
11293,"Eastern TN, eg, was hit by it, near Greeneville, TN."
11294,Yeah this mask ordinance lift was a direct response to the winter storm fiasco.
11295,"He had to shift the conversation away from his fuck ups, with a potentially even bigger fuck up."
11296,Moderna and Pfizer too.
11297,"I haven't seen them put a percentage to it, but it still appears to work even better than past infection with a different strain."

11333,"Because to me as a layperson, it looks like almost no states have even reached the 50-65 bracket yet, and there's something like 25 million people in that range."
11334,Sturgis was a superspreader.

11371,my county only had three.

herd immunity is not some magic number where no one ever gets sick again."
11385,"see data on chicken pox, for example"
11386,&gt; it's also important to remain at a distance from people and wear masks even after you get the vaccine to reduce risk of spreading it even still.
11387,"Sorry, but no."
11388,That goes against every other study.
11389,"Stupid question, I dont have much knowledge but I was wondering why I dont have symptoms like others, no fever, cough or anything except runny nose and super sore throat."

11392,"Like me and many others not vaccinated, I‚Äôd still just wear a mask."
11393,And anyone could see a mile away that most big businesses were going to enforce it so it looks like they care and they get their name on the news.
11394,And?

11411,I keep wearing my mask and social distancing because I just don't like interacting with people or smiling...
11412,I'll be damned if some cunty politican is gonna take that away from me

11455,No.
11456,Prioritizing healthcare workers and nursing homes and elderly is a great move when done right.
11457,The issue now is we need more distribution sites and to start opening more eligibility...two things states are starting to do.
11458,Funds from the new stimulus bill will help.
11459,"Yea I think we mostly agree on this, but they already take that into account for future allocations."
11460,When planning ahead they would need to consider not just past performance but also projected participation and need/demand.
11461,"Since they have approved the J&amp;J vax for emergency use, and estimate to have enough vaccines to distribute all americans by end of May, I think planning for future allocations will change pretty drastically."

11466,Lack of ICU beds is a part of it.
11467,We have like 200 in the whole state.
11468,Rural areas have no ICU beds and need very expensive medevacs to either Anchorage or Seattle.
11469,The sooner these rural areas without critical care access get vaccinated then there‚Äôs less of a chance of them burdening Anchorage or hospitals in other states.
11470,This is how it cycles each week.
11471,Today is still the highest Wednesday for vaccinations.
11472,"They do need it, eventually."
11473,If covid is still circulating among the children at a high rate for much longer it increases the risk of a mutation that renders the vaccine ineffective.
11474,"We will be able to open up before then since they are at low risk of serious illness, but we should want all kids to be vaccinated, and soon."
11475,We got 4 million.

11559,Interesting article.
11560,It has a new title.
11561,"So the other info in the article is interesting as well, but this is what I found most interesting:

# Vaccine row: EU has exported 34m doses ‚Äì including 9m to the UK

 **Internal figures leaked amid tit-for-tat with Boris Johnson over claims UK had export ban in place** 

 A total of 34m doses of coronavirus vaccine have been exported from the EU despite shortages for people living in the bloc, including 9m sent to the UK and 1m to the US, which has a ban on sales abroad."
11562,...
11563,But officials said Michel wanted to know how many exports had been made from the UK as they highlighted the role of EU-based production sites in the global effort.
11564,"‚ÄúWe know that different countries have got different measures in place ‚Äì that doesn‚Äôt concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,‚Äù a commission spokesperson said."
11565,"‚ÄúBut we know as well that we, the EU, are a very, very active exporter of vaccines and that this is not necessarily the case of all our partners.‚Äù

According to the latest figures seen by the Guardian and accurate as of 9 March, of the 34,090,287 doses exported from the EU to 31 countries, 9,106,162 went to the UK, 3,917,640 to Canada, 3,134,204 to Mexico, 2,720,210 to Japan and 1,368,900 to Saudi Arabia."
11566,"Other beneficiaries of EU exports included Hong Kong (1.3m), Singapore (967,030), the US (953,723), Chile (942,825) and Malaysia (751,140)."
11567,"The majority of vaccines exported from the EU to the UK were made by Pfizer, which distributes globally from its European production sites, it is understood."
11568,"The EU has blocked only one export request under its controversial authorisation mechanism for vaccines, a shipment of 250,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses from Italy to Australia."
11569,...
11570,I feel so bad for her daughter.
11571,A thorough investigation needs to be completed.
11572,"Not just by the hospital, but moderna as well"
11573,I was told I would still get it.
11574,Likely be asymptomatic and spread to others.
11575,something something variants that vaccines are significantly weaker on
11576,Georgia is letting people 16+ get the vaccine beginning on April 1.
11577,I'd be doing u-turns in the booth like I was Boris Johnson
11578,slow but a bit better.
11579,The issue is that there is no more measures because politics know that people are nervous and to protect the economy.
11580,"hospitals in Paris are saturated and so they externalize sick people to China, removing our nurses job !"
11581,"...and in a galaxy not too far away in a time not too far off, someone will reference a reliable sub as source for this."
11582,"Come on, I read it on r/Coronavirus, they're very strict on facts!"
11583,Two weeks.
11584,"After two weeks-which is 15 days, you‚Äôre considered fully vaccinated."
11585,I‚Äôm not sure where your confusion is coming from.
11586,More like not rewarding laziness and making healthy people go even longer without being able to interact with the world.
11587,Merkel said today that we need to expect three to four more though months before vaccines start making a difference.
11588,"That would put us at early July, eight continuous months of lockdown (or rather, restrictions on everyday life beyond mask orders and occupancy limits)."
11589,I'm not really talking about people going into houses or dealing with customers.
11590,"But both finance and telecom have large backend infrastructure, so people working in offices with their coworkers."
11591,Managers in offices etc.
11592,"Thats my issue, and I only take issue because trades have been excluded."
11593,"Just think of the amount of trades, home repair companies etc that go into over a dozen houses with complete strangers every month, sometimes more."
11594,I believe it goes by obese rather than overweight.
11595,What percent is obese?
11596,I hear a spin-off of Gilligan's Island theme song coming ...
11597,Weird
11598,Arent they one of the states that already lifted their mask mandate though?
11599,But the pharmacies are handicapped more by restrictions.
11600,"For example, CVS in Virginia can only administer to 65+ and school teachers."
11601,But the state run ones have more people such as high risk individuals

11629,Oh Gosh.
11630,Heavens no.
11631,I do not think it‚Äôs a purely cultural discussion.
11632,Quite the opposite.
11633,I think there are significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare and that is the primary explanation for the vaccination rates.
11634,You can look at any health outcome and blacks/Latinos will underperform whites.
11635,There is no cultural reason why blacks and Latinos would not want treatment for heart attacks or cancer or any other medical condition.
11636,Yet we see those communities have poorer health outcomes.

11638,It is largely an access to quality health care issue.

11641,I'm low risk but I got the shot at Walgreens because they were looking for people to get it.

11643,"I don't doubt the competence of Russian scientists, although there are ethical concerns with how the trials were pushed through."
11644,The US export ban (or inability to produce enough to export) as well as the EU's failure to also produce enough is giving both Russia and China a huge geopolitical victory.
11645,Chile (Chinese vaccine) and Serbia (SputnikV I think) are vaccinating at a much better pace than most of the EU countries.
11646,"As Hungary and Slovakia are also buying SputnikV, they're also able to push ahead."
11647,This isn't great for the soft power of western nations.
11648,"I don't fault Hungary and Slovakia for going outside the EU purchases to get SputnikV, both have massive outbreaks and the EU has failed to deliver on the vaccines so far."
11649,"Without knowing enough, it seems to me like Russia sacrifices their citizens in order to get this win though."
11650,At what pace are they vaccinating and are they able to produce enough both for internal use and all the exports?
11651,"So far it's just a few countries, giving at least a show of being a better ally in this than the EU or the US."
11652,This last part is just speculation on my part though.
11653,You can just call and ask.
11654,They'll tell you.
11655,Yes.
11656,I'm a teenager and when I had the flu I couldn't go to school for about a week.
11657,Why should I needlessly miss school for a week and feel ssick if it is avoidable?
11658,Are appointments really just sitting untaken in other states.
11659,Like that boggles my mind.
11660,Here in NJ almost all appointments are taken in a matter of 10-20 minutes.
11661,The only time appointments stay open more than a coupe hours is county specific sites and those always eventually go or private appointments that are sent out to specific individuals from the states but I would wager almost all those eventually go to I just can‚Äôt see them.
11662,Seems crazy to me that so many states are dropping the ball in the last week or two.
11663,Hopefully they can get it together soon
11664,We have the same expression.
11665,"Usually it's something like ""you can breathe easy now""."
11666,"Yeah, both my parents got Pfizer and my grandma and neither got Moderna."
11667,My wife and I are getting J&amp;J as we're the youngest (20's).
11668,I'm ready to get.ome as soon as I'm eligible.
11669,"I can wait my turn though, I'm healthy, young and working from home."
11670,I just miss outside.
11671,I agree with the tier system but as the supply ramps up it should quickly start to expand who can get it.
11672,I'm hoping by April I can at least be able to sign up
11673,No.
11674,Because you made a claim about the whole state that isn‚Äôt true universally.
11675,"Masks do in fact work, whether or not you want to wear one is another story"
11676,"Good point, in CA anyone can get ID regardless of status but that doesn‚Äôt mean all do."
11677,Also many in those areas are weary of vaccines/medical intervention and many have natural immunity to Covid already.
11678,Who said they were healthy?
11679,My point is that they are home.
11680,They are vaccinated.
11681,And they are still not leaving their home.
11682,No one in their home is leaving.
11683,The number of people that can catch covid from is zero and the people they can spread it to are zero.
11684,Literally.
11685,"A single dose would go a lot farther with someone who is healthy, but catches it at work and can't afford to stay home, is precontagious, OR is asymptomatic spreading it to others."
11686,"For instance, I come in contact with countless people all day long."
11687,One of them may give me covid.
11688,"And I will, at minimum, spread it to some, if not all, of my pod."
11689,"Plus, the employees."
11690,"If you add in spread to other classes and family, I think it's quite obvious where a single dose would go farther."
11691,Lol- I haven‚Äôt worn anything less than an n95 since august.
11692,I‚Äôve actually bought a lot extra and I‚Äôve kind of become the n95 apostle.
11693,I carry them around and if I see someone who looks at risk and like they are taking this seriously I‚Äôll offer them one.
11694,They make me feel safer but I still feel really surrounded by teens who are Petrie dishes and like at some point I‚Äôm going to get unlucky.
11695,"If this was about my country, I may change my behavior, do more outreach to family, etc."
11696,"Since it is Hungary, I will think of how sad it is and hope it improves but there is little I can do."
11697,NC is rapidly expanding eligibility.
11698,A month ago this seemed like it would drag on until fall.
11699,Now I think we have everyone done in 2 months here.
11700,Seriously impressed.

11703,You did your part.
11704,I can't wait to do mine!
11705,It is referred to as a benchmark in my world.
11706,it is but an indicator.
11707,"The real ""Proof"" is what happens in the following months."
11708,God I would hate to live in texas right now..
11709,Has France ever had a low in their waves
11710,"Appointment on Friday, 3 days to go"

11712,but thanks for your concern!
11713,:)
11714,It is referred to as a benchmark in my world.
11715,it is but an indicator.
11716,"The real ""Proof"" is what happens in the following months."
11717,And also the most leftist city in the state.
11718,Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not turned into a political thing on both sides.
11719,Food service worker and former Austin resident here.
11720,Why do you want public-facing Austinite workers to die?
11721,If your kids are at high risk or you don't feel comfortable then please stay home.
11722,But if things continue as they have been recently then the rest of America is going to be letting off some steam this summer.
11723,"Kids are extremely low risk, schools are opening up, and mask mandates are going away."
11724,"For most people there probably won't be much, if any additional risk by summer."
11725,"By the time schools would‚Äôve reopened, there would‚Äôve been like 2 weeks left."
11726,At that point it was worth it just to move the rest of the year online
11727,It‚Äôs just a little prick
11728,"The powers that be, and the CDC"
11729,Thanks for your comment.
11730,"This seems much more rational, even if I want a vaccine as soon as possible, I have a few months to wait at best."
11731,I can only imagine pharmacies with phones ringing constantly with people all asking the same question.
11732,Am I the only one still worried about the long ter effects ?
11733,"Just suspend it, that measure has been a disaster from the beginning, it was working much better with the self quarantine at home."
11734,Depends on what you mean by long term.
11735,They overlapped the trial periods to accelerate getting approval.
11736,"Trials began in early February 2020, so there were about 9 months of trial data on tens of thousands of people before they sought emergency approval from the FDA."
11737,[removed]
11738,Efficacy was under 60% for South Africa with the J&amp;J vaccine.
11739,"Better than AstraZeneca, by a long shot, but not as high as was hoped."
11740,The article literally said they were investigating if the vaccine was linked.
11741,"Thats not proof, so either youre bad at reading or just pushing an agenda."
11742,Who‚Äôs they?
11743,I was fine with that one or Moderna and I was thrilled to manage to get a Pfizer vaccine!
11744,"Please - get vaccinated with whichever one you are offered, as soon as it is available to you."
11745,I work at my local testing center full-time.
11746,I have yet to be offered a vaccine.
11747,The number of people who don't take this seriously is a slap in the face.
11748,Our government relaxed restrictions today.
11749,Can't wait to see where we'll be in 14 days /s
11750,Is Moderna one or two shots?
11751,My fianc√©e is deathly afraid of needles (a nurse collapsed a vein in her arm drawing blood when she was really little) and is hoping to get a single dose vaccine.
11752,"She'll take two if it's what's available at the time, but I'm trying to keep an eye out for a single shot vaccine spot if I can."
11753,Texas: *hold my beer*
11754,Yeah and I'm sure their reporting accuracy is top notch üòÇ
11755,The difference here is that I can wear a surgical mask while I wait for my N98 mask.
11756,"Then, when the N98 arrives, I can use it."
11757,"If I get the 65% effective vaccine, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm vaccinated."

11765,Wow.
11766,The math on this is so much worse than I originally thought.
11767,They propose two months worth of weeks tests for everyone at a cost of approximately $68 per person.
11768,So a mere $13.5 billion dollar program.
11769,"Even if the money was payable tomorrow, it would be (at the most generous) months to get something like this off the ground."
11770,To say nothing of the massive amount of resources and logistics to get it done.
11771,"Resources that could be better focused on making, distributing, and injecting vaccine."
11772,"The last sentence is not really accurate, at least in the point that your chances at higher than 65% you will never get COVID."
11773,"The  65% effectiveness for J&amp;J is not based on getting COVID, but decrease in moderate to severe cases."
11774,Your chances for catching COVID can still be high depending on environment and variants exposed to.
11775,"However, what the vaccine offers is a much higher protection level that a COVID infection stays asymptomatic or less severe, which is more than a good enough reason to get it."
11776,"There is also emerging evidence out of Israel and UK that the vaccines also helps lower transmission of those who do become infected who have the vaccine, probably due to lower viral load."
11777,"This is also a good enough reason to get the vaccine as it hinders the ability for COVID to spread in the community, and helps us get back on track to normalcy."
11778,Twitter doesn't have the proper means to report misinformation.
11779,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01270-4 shows that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is capable of targeting the key features of the South African variant.
11780,"While they are testing an updated version of the vaccine as insurance, the current expectation is that it will not be needed."
11781,"Note that J&amp;J's study in the US, where the variants were not widely circulating at the time, only achieved 72% efficacy - these results are directly comparable to the &gt;90% results Pfizer and Moderna achieved."
11782,"Florida is barely expanding eligibility, only recently adding law enforcement and firefighters over 50 as well as hospital staff with direct contact with patients"
11783,Abington idiot somebody's tickets wheelchair away from him
11784,"Is that 50 over the ""normal"" weight or 50 over the threshold for obesity?"
11785,If the latter you probably should be doing something about it.
11786,"It‚Äôs mostly improved to around 70%-80% of what it used to be, but the smell of cooked onions ‚Äî which used to be delicious ‚Äî now smells like putrid feet."
11787,Many foods just aren‚Äôt the same as a result.
11788,Other smells like lavender are just completely weak.
11789,And I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the best authority on when the kitchen trash needs to go out.
11790,"Still, I‚Äôm very fortunate compared to many others who‚Äôve ended up even worse."
11791,"Teachers are in the classrooms, just like in my state where idiots think they do nothing when actually they teach hybrid in person while also teaching remote."
11792,Are all districts in person?
11793,"Probably not, but thats up to the school committee and state education committee."
11794,Might as well blame the kids for not being there.
11795,"We may have increased domestic capacity, but we still haven't solved the problem."
11796,Decoupling from our over-dependence on China is going to take years.
11797,"That wasn't originally the point of the flair, especially as it means the pandemic is still raging."
11798,I feel sorry for your tiny brain.
11799,"So, it's a job and a vacation week man."
11800,I remember people going off at teachers who buy vodka at the store or wear sweatpants around town.
11801,"It might be a rewarding job, but it's still just a job."
11802,No one gives 2 shits if I wear sweatpants...
11803,Doing first come first serve is far more efficient for rolling out a vaccine than groups and sub dividing those.
11804,People who want them should get them
11805,J&amp;J works with most of the different variants anyways
11806,There are some states such as California that allow those who volunteer in vaccination sites to get their vaccine but I agree.
11807,The above comment does sound like BS
11808,I'm getting the desire to buy a Zune: think my shot was expired?
11809,Doesn't mean it's good news it's needed?
11810,That's probably because it's not even listed as a vaccine on the moderns website.
11811,They call it gene therapy.
11812,"Im in my late 20s, got astrazeneca yesterday , got the most terrible fever and some aches 12 hours later, but slept it off and just took some painkillers for the aches in the morning."
11813,"Now I feel pretty fresh, with just sore arm now."
11814,I wish it did.
11815,I want to be spiderman.
11816,With most places you either schedule appointments at once or when you get to your first vaccination appointment.
11817,For me I was scheduled upfront for my second appointment when I scheduled the first.
11818,But will some still allow you to get heart/lung issues?
11819,"If so, I'll wait for Moderna, tks."
11820,I never knew the word for that is nocebo.
11821,I get that shit all the time and it's the worst.
11822,Hope I don't freak out when I get my vaccine
11823,"Well, when 50 senators vote no that makes it hard."
11824,Im getting my first tomorrow
11825,"So fucking pathetic when going below 1,000 is newsworthy, while a strict mask mandate would have nearly obliterated the deaths early on."
11826,What the fuck??
11827,?
11828,So sad that I thought you were talking about the PS5 at first.
11829,Had November flashbacks.
11830,there were a lot of moments back then but it's hard to put a date on any of them.
11831,"one that sticks out in my mind was asking a friend who has US military connections (husband is an officer, etc) whether i should go out and get a weeks' worth of food."
11832,her reply was that she was told to get a month's worth.
11833,I‚Äôll take corporate encroachment over government encroachment any day.
11834,Corporations haven‚Äôt operated gulags in several hundred years.
11835,You are right of course.
11836,Especially here in the US where nobody seems to care about privacy.
11837,Nothing gets my blood boiling more than the ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide‚Äù idiots.
11838,&gt;Time to expose those who aren't in it for the kids.
11839,It would be crazy to think that some of them might just be doing their job in the exchange for wages and health care like the rest of us.
11840,That will not do!
11841,Don‚Äôt they take a vow of poverty and obedience or something?
11842,This dude really cares more about his steaks being well done than human lives lmao
11843,"Good, fuck those line cutters!"
11844,"Unless you want to offer to pay the bills, he needs to go to work."
11845,Just make sure he uses a good quality mask.
11846,How did you make your decision in the end?
11847,BREAKING NEWS!
11848,"REDDIT USER u/Loseem84 SAYS COVID VACCINES USELESS, ALL VACCINE MANUFACTURERS HAVE STOPPED PRODUCTION"
11849,"Yah, good luck dealing with the fallout from THAT one."
11850,No governor in the country would be stupid enough to risk re-election on that one.
11851,Pfizer and Moderna do a better job of preventing actual illness though.
11852,What was your disease?
11853,If you don‚Äôt mind sharing
11854,"&gt;I mean, if you don't want to play by society's rules...   ...then you're more than welcome to give up your truck/phone/internet/beer and go starve to death in a cave."
11855,100% This!!!!!!!
11856,If you want to go get yourself 40 acres in Montana or Wyoming and mule and become a subsistence farmer have at it.
11857,"I'll support and defend your right to do whatever you want all day long, every day, and twice on Sundays."
11858,"But as you choose to interact with society, society has the right to set pre-conditions on that interaction."
11859,"Retail workers are ""heroes"" the same way soldiers are, you praise them but don't bother to pay them more or expect them to survive."
11860,"No, by the end of September was everyone that wanted one would be offered at least 1 shot."
11861,"But that was also before the new dosing schedule, so the majority of those people would still be fully vaccinated."
11862,They haven't really updated their 'goal date' since the change in dosing schedules.
11863,But I do feel they should be able to get everyone fully vaccinated by the end of September now.
11864,Thank god for India
11865,Oh most definitely
11866,"I don't agree with the poster above, but this is how it works given that Merck is producing large quantities of the J&amp;J vaccine."
11867,"It doesn't pre-suppose it, but in practice there's about a 99% chance it will."
11868,Corporations and the government aren't ones to pass up an opportunity to further encroach on people's privacy.
11869,Those assholes are literally grownup toddlers.
11870,I'm not even kidding.
11871,"At some point around age 7 these people basically stopped developing emotionally, and they simply see the world in terms of ""mine!"
11872,""", ""I'm telling"", ""why can't I have what he has"", foot stomping, etc."
11873,"Maybe when the cold reality of the grownup world started hitting them in the face, they reverted to acting like a spoiled brat each time and found not only comfort in it but their very identity."
11874,How is everyone finding vaccine appointments?
11875,"All slots are full for cvs, Tom Thumb, etc whenever I check
I tried checking at midnight too"
11876,Its never going to be 100% unfortunately.
11877,Theres always a small amount of people that wont take the vaccine
11878,So does being fit abs but obese
11879,UV light has been used for disinfecting for decades
11880,I did that and was able to get my first does of the pfizer.
11881,"Second dose is entirely up in the air, however, so that's an entirely separate point of stress."
11882,They keep talking about 2-3million a day but like nobody I know can actually GET ONE
11883,Road trip for Covid vaccine and edibles?
11884,"Well, if I have to..."
11885,Yeah I'm calling BS on this one.
11886,"As far as I am aware, no state has that group in the eligible pool yet"
11887,"+1 for remembering the reapportionment act is a thing, I feel like a broken record explaining again and again that it‚Äôs half the reason we are fucked"
11888,"I don‚Äôt want to minimize the long haulers and those with tough symptoms, but case numbers become meaningless when the people at risk for hospitalization and death have been vaccinated."
11889,The restrictions were always about managing hospital capacity.
11890,"Staff should follow those assholes out to their cars, write down their license plates, post them online, and let the Internet do the rest."
11891,So once they hit 100% what's their next excuse for teachers not returning to class?......
11892,"Just a heads up, spring break is coming soon, keep a look out for teachers at the beach."
11893,Time to expose those who aren't in it for the kids.
11894,"I don't have specific event names, but Crains has been writing up the event and convention industry frequently, though most of the site is behind a paywall."
11895,"This is a recent, publicly accessible article if you want a sense of the shape of the industry here."
11896,"[https://www.chicagobusiness.com/private-intelligence/when-will-it-be-safe-hit-convention-circuit-again](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/private-intelligence/when-will-it-be-safe-hit-convention-circuit-again)

If you want a take from the exact opposite end of the political spectrum, the Chicago Federation of Labor has been vocal about the issue and shared some information from the a state senate meeting recently, 

[https://twitter.com/chicagolabor/status/1367520407557914626](https://twitter.com/chicagolabor/status/1367520407557914626)

Recently, two major events cancelled: one was scheduled for late May and has moved to May of 2022, while the other is in August and is moved to March 2022."
11897,"The signal here, and in the Crains article, is that 2021 is off the table for conventions."

11899,Thanks man!
11900,Appreciate it.
11901,"I‚Äôm happy for y‚Äôall who are able to get your shots, we all deserve some relief after this year-long nightmare we‚Äôve gone through and eventually we‚Äôll all have our turn."
11902,"Things could most certainly be worse with how vaccines are moving in Canada (they‚Äôve adjusted the schedule between doses to 4 months, which is a whole other issue I dunno how I feel about, and are predicting everyone will have one shot at least by the summer) but they could be better, too."
11903,Restrictions are quite a bit more heavy here too and it won‚Äôt be awhile before we‚ÄôIl have fans at hockey games and no-mask gatherings even with vaccines but I‚Äôm looking forward to the day every second!
11904,I got Moderna today.
11905,I specifically chose a location with this or Pfizer.
11906,I didn‚Äôt want the J&amp;J one due to the lower efficacy.
11907,the author of spy novels?
11908,"Probably, it's a strange translation, I'll edit it."
11909,My dad refused to give statements for his department.
11910,Was to busy doing actual work to do that.
11911,Figured they could find the information from people actually paid to give statement.
11912,Austin is more liberal so they are focused on protecting their residents.
11913,I just wish the republicans would stop this anti-life movement.
11914,Hey Maryland I hope you are paying attention
11915,Supply increase might be hearsay.
11916,She got it in the form of a letter.
11917,"She is in the over 60
Group and that‚Äôs not a positive sign."
11918,I had COVID last March and got my second Jansen dose I.
11919,The trial this week.
11920,The first was 54 days before that.
11921,I felt pretty bad after the first shot but the second is definitely better.
11922,My arm still hurts like I got hit with a hammer but the rest of me is fine.
11923,I couldn't understand her.
11924,"I'm not American so not familiar with the dialect, but it sounded as though she had a potato in her mouth."
11925,And the words I could make out didn't make sense.
11926,"What I got was she did a bad thing, feels stupid, but doesn't know how to say I'm sorry so lashes out due to stunted emotional development."
11927,And then lyft banned her.
11928,I with there was a Covid idiot registry.
11929,Should have called in the head nurse.
11930,Sorry I couldn't help it.
11931,RIP.
11932,"If we can truly hit that 70% rate in that group in another 10 days or so, it'll be monumental."
11933,(I'm a US expat in Germany.
11934,My best shot is to visit home this spring/summer and get vaccinated there because the EU fucked up so bad.)
11935,Yeah basically the EU isn't reopening until 2025 or so.
11936,But it's not a de facto ban.
11937,They are completely free to export if they so wish.
11938,"Just because something isn't happening, it doesn't mean it can't happen."
11939,"&gt; I don't see that happening

And I never said it would happen."
11940,Of course you can lie.
11941,"You could have lied previously under our ambiguous ""adult caregiver"" category."
11942,It's an honor system.
11943,Always has been.
11944,Working their butts off to educate the country‚Äôs future you say?
11945,"That‚Äôs weird, seems like they‚Äôre working their butts off to keep the very institution which educates the country‚Äôs future closed."
11946,"If you‚Äôre a teacher and believe that online school is an effective replacement for in-person learning, you are, in fact, not only a lazy piece of shit, but also a selfish and dare I say anti-science piece of shit at that."
11947,Let the downvotes flow baby.
11948,"Wow that chick is aggressive as fuck, who the fuck does she think she is?"
11949,A man?
11950,"Luckily the guy didn‚Äôt hit her back, but she really tested the waters and could‚Äôve gotten herself and her friends into some deep shit."
11951,She‚Äôs a fuckin bully for sure.
11952,Supply is increasing.
11953,That sounds like hearsay.
11954,This lady is such trash.
11955,She looks mentally unstable too.
11956,The pepper spray was basically assault on the driver.
11957,"Yes, but with both vaccine and the absence of symptoms the probability of having been infected is low enough that quarantining as a precaution does not make sense."
11958,"It's a cost-benefit analysis, not an absolute certainty."
11959,The thousands of people dying every day would suggest otherwise.
11960,"We don‚Äôt know it was long, but it was definitely hard."
11961,"I keep thinking just that, honestly."
11962,This is how it should be everywhere.
11963,"After the most vulnerable (healthcare workers, elderly, comorbidities), everyone should be eligible for the shot."
11964,"There are two reasons for why Alaska is so far ahead of other states, in terms of its roll out."
11965,The Native Corporations have been on-fucking-point with their administration of the doses they've been aloted.
11966,They have a slick and fast system for getting it done.
11967,The second point is that getting Alaska's remote villages and towns vaccinated has been a very high priority due to the danger of it spreading in them.
11968,"Their remoteness can mean that if even a single case gets into a village, then the entire village of 200+ people will become infected."
11969,So they've been prioritized heavily.
11970,&gt; people should have to right to make the decision of whether they want to risk catching Covid or not.
11971,But they don't have the right to then go spread it to someone else.
11972,"I mean, sure, you make the decision to go to a Rangers game, and then you get sick, you're the one paying for it."
11973,"But what if, in the five days between the game and when you start feeling symptoms, you go to the grocery store, where I'm also shopping?"
11974,"Newsom just said in an interview, a green tier where businesses can fully reopen would be created once the state gets to 15-20 million vaccinations."
11975,California is at 11 million right now.
11976,Huh.
11977,Thanks I had wondered.
11978,Ohio seems to be going by age.
11979,Wow.
11980,So what caused Europe to be so behind on vaccines?
11981,\&gt; This is where we have some  disagreement.
11982,"First off, I'm not saying someone should go to a rave and  then go hang out with their unvaccinated grandparents."
11983,"That's dumb, so  let's get that out of the way."
11984,Isn't that what this super-spreader event is all about?
11985,Forget about unvaccinated grandparents - what about the unvaccinated high-risk grocery store cashier?
11986,The unvaccinated high-risk daycare worker?
11987,There are plenty of unvaccinated high-risk folks around.
11988,Should someone go to a rave and then infect them?
11989,"\&gt; What I *am*  saying is that people have been dealing with this for a year, and  they've lived the numbers."
11990,"People have gotten this, seen others get it,  and they've determined there's more to life than just disease avoidance."
11991,"Like I said, we all make these calculations differently."
11992,"That's all fine and good, but do you have the right to make these calculations for someone else?"

12075,"According to Pew 85% of those 65+ plan on getting, or have already gotten, the vaccine."

12100,I'm expecting to get vaccinated in the next week or so.
12101,"&gt;So far it's just a few countries

It's actually dozens of countries that they export vaccines to."
12102,It's 6 (maybe 7) countries that I can think of in Europe alone.
12103,"Then a bunch of countries in Africa (I think 10), almost whole of South America is using Sputnik V and several countries in Asia."
12104,Mexico too.
12105,In total 49 countries approved it for emergency use.
12106,Tied for first place with AstraZeneca (if AZ hasn't been approved by some other country in the last couple of days).
12107,I think that the US and EU are yet to understand just how big of a vacuum they left for Russia and China to fill.
12108,"I have to say, I find it a bit hypocritical when some media outlets, but also government officials, try to critisize Russia and China for engaging in vaccine diplomacy."
12109,"""They are trying to present themselves as friends to those countries"" well, duhh."
12110,That's how it works.
12111,"How can them trying to help other countries and those countries accepting help, when the west is NOT helping, possibly be a bad thing?"

12115,I've no idea.
12116,Could be the infrastructure and profit margin.

But that's not true."
12147,"Even back from the very first wave we saw the massive difference in death rates between a country locked down, Finland, and one that isn't, Sweden."
12148,"&gt;We know lockdowns slow the spread but by a very low percentage, which explains why the first point is true."
12149,It's a lot more than a very low percentage.
12150,That's why we've seen next to no flu outbreak this year.
12151,The lockdown strongly prevents spread.
12152,It's multi-faceted.
12153,We did need to expand the eligibility criteria.
12154,This was just knee-jerk and the wrong way to do it.

12160,I don't understand why everyone in this thread is focusing on same day distribution and administration numbers.
12161,We know there's reporting lag and distributing on one day doesn't mean it can go into the arm that same day anyway.
12162,These numbers will likely catch up in the next week as these higher dose numbers are administered
12163,&gt;I exercise common sense precautions to make sure I am doing everything I can possibly be doing to not infect someone with the flu.

12167,"&gt;Now, COVID is (a) much deadlier than the flu, and (b) much more likely to spread asymptomatically."
12168,This is pretty settled science by now.
12169,"So, I am much more likely to accidentally infect someone with COVID than I am to infect someone with the flu."
12170,No arguments here.
12171,&gt;The only reasonable risk-mitigation strategy here is avoiding superspreader events altogether.

12173,"Only about 10% of the population is vaccinated, we're nowhere near herd immunity."
12174,"What happened to mark this ""social end""?"
12175,The fact that it's spring and everyone wants to go out and party?

12247,&gt;The perception that some vaccines may be better than others has to do with the topline numbers from efficacy studies.

12275,I don't know who it was that had them remove it but that was the end of any semblance of required balance.
12276,"Now all there is, for the most part, is news with an angle made for a specific audience."
12277,"CNN, fox, they all do it."
12278,"It's just a matter of how much, and in which direction."
12279,"That said, of any of them says something that's true - nobody's opinion on the matter... matters."
12280,"Whether or not you hate them, objective truth is just that, truth."
12281,My last point is about your comment earlier on why CNN is allowed on this sub.
12282,"If they report that some guy said some thing, and he did say those things, then like them or not it is what it is."
12283,"And in this case he said those things about COVID, in a currently relevant area of conversation (Texas + masks)."
12284,"Anyways, don't waste your energy on CNN, they're not worth it!"
12285,Please do keep the healthy discussions going though - even if they run counter to what's popular in a sub.
12286,"Otherwise everything is just a  spiraling echo chamber and that, ultimately, does no one any good."
12287,Yep.
12288,The second shot is important as an immunity booster that provides longer immunity and resistance against potential mutations.
12289,"From a public health perspective, it makes sense to get the first shot into as many people as possible."
12290,"But in practice, so many people would neglect getting the second shot which would end up being the equivalent of stopping your antibiotics once you feel better."
12291,Basically we can't do the first-shot strategy because people are stupid.
12292,Got my first shot yesterday!
12293,"The National Guard gave mine and she was really good with that needle, lol!"
12294,They gave us the Moderna which is 94% effective against the strains and it is an mRNA vaccine so it works differently and uses the genetic code of the virus instead of dead virus cells to trigger an immune response.
12295,It is supposed to last longer because of that.
12296,They made us wait 15 minutes before we could leave in case there were any side effects.
12297,No one fell over flopping.
12298,I didn't have any immediate side effects but I will let you know if that changes.
12299,"Anyway, I weighed the risks and thought I should get it but it has to be a personal choice."
12300,I am just hopeful we can put this damn virus behind us because it has done a lot of damage.
12301,So sorry he‚Äôs not (D)ifferent.

12304,I think a lot of people just didn‚Äôt expect it to be available already too.
12305,I was in the clinical trial so obviously I was going to be obnoxious about it but I have been all over people.
12306,"Got my mom in early, sent all my friends the sign up link, put my husband on all the waiting lists ect."
12307,"I‚Äôm very much looking forward to being able to see people this spring, although of course now it‚Äôs been so long since I got my vaccine I feel like I need to be cautious until we get good data on how long it continues to be highly effective."
12308,ok
12309,"One of the biomed podcasts that I listen to, some doctor said something to the effect of ""like the r0 in the Macro world, there is a rate of transmission inside of one's body as well""."
12310,"Not every part of the body has the same number of antibodies actively attacking the viral load that is coming to invade to body, and if the vaccine immunizes one to recognize the virus, there may be a ""vaccine side effects"" level of response, a fever, feeling tired, etc...  That accompanies a later exposure to the virus."
12311,Once I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm done with masks.
12312,"If a store wants to kick me out for not wearing one at that point, I guess they won‚Äôt have my business anymore."

12316,"They are ok with out of state folks getting the vaccine, and they have a lower vaccine rate than Georgia"
12317,[removed]
12318,"Well the UK variant doubles its proportion of cases about every 10 days (it was about 10% proportion on February 26th, so it's probably closer to 20% now), so it will be the predominant strain later this month based on existing case data."
12319,"As for the South African strain, I agree the data has been all over the place, but this (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017) is a pretty good study from the New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrates a 2-3 times poorer antibody response that should still be sufficient but maybe not as good."
12320,"I agree with you that the restrictions are frustrating, but if we can get an adequately vaccinated population before reopening then the virus won't have the opportunity to mutate and there won't be other problematic strains."
12321,It seems like a common problem in a lot of states was distributing way too much to rural areas.
12322,The difference in appointment availability is pretty stark.
12323,FYI 7 day average is back to 800 today.
12324,This is  where is was 19 days ago.
12325,"So effectively we saw massive drops, and then R=1 for the last 19 days."
12326,The EU was pretty late to the party with public funding.
12327,"The US, UK and plenty of others were funding the developments whilst the EU was being sketchy on price."
12328,Received dose 1 of Moderna today here in Kentucky.
12329,So happy to finally be included in the daily count.
12330,Bro I don‚Äôt believe these manufacturers at all.
12331,They keep saying ‚Äúmore vaccine coming‚Äù for months and it‚Äôs still a snails pace.
12332,I‚Äôm guessing gen pop in august
12333,I assumed at first that the small and far away places got bigger shipments because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to send them weekly shipments
12334,I never said they decreased already by that amount so let me rephrase that - it would knock out 90%+ of *potential* hospitalizations and deaths.
12335,Any potential surge in the future doesn't really matter with the most vulnerable being vaccinated now and the possibility of another surge happening dwindles each day as millions more are getting shots.
12336,Because they don‚Äôt check for underlying health issues.
12337,"My mom is 63 years old in good condition, but has an underlying health issue that puts her at extreme risk."
12338,"She looks very healthy, 5‚Äô3‚Äù 110 pounds looks like she is 45 on her worst days."
12339,She checked into her appointment the pharmacist asked why she qualified.
12340,"My mom had her note ready from her doctor, and my mom just said underlying issue and the pharmacist said ok. Didn‚Äôt bother to look at note or anything."
12341,That she's not on oxygen really makes me think it's not covid related.

12356,"Well, we do have a constitutionally protected right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress."
12357,"We don't actually have a constitutional right to ""have fun""."
12358,"That said, I couldn't care less about the biker rally."
12359,I feel for anyone that might die from it though.
12360,my point is you‚Äôre an idiot and it hurts.
12361,"For some of us, it's not ""virtue signaling"", which I think is an incorrect assessment anyway."
12362,I think people say they will continue to wear masks and some will actually continue to wear masks for two reasons.
12363,"First, people have lost a lot of trust in the FDA and CDC."
12364,"The FDA has had trust problems for years, but the CDC was sacrosanct until Trump got a hold of it and the doctors in charge of it lied to people to either keep their jobs or for a political agenda."
12365,"I'm not saying the CDC never lied, withheld or skewed the truth before, but this time was exceptional in it's breadth and the harm it caused."
12366,The second reason is people are scared.
12367,Some of us have underlying conditions that mean we have to be more careful.
12368,"Until we are fully convinced the pandemic is actually over and there aren't variants out there that will refuel it in spite of the current vaccine, we can't afford to take any more chances than we have to."
12369,I will be wearing a mask for quite a while.
12370,"Yes, it's inconvenient and I won't like it, but I'll do it."
12371,"In case you doubt me, I currently have not left my house for a full year except to go to the doctor and walk in an area where no one else goes."
12372,"When I do have to come in contact with another person, I wear a P100 chemical mask, which is far more uncomfortable than an surgical mask or N95 mask plus you get a number of people looking at you like you are crazy."
12373,"I'm not crazy, I just can't afford any more health problems."
12374,Not really tho?
12375,"This comment from [ozimp5000](https://www.reddit.com/user/ozimp5000/) says it better than I ever could...  


One day, the United Kingdom was very hungry and went to the butcher's."

12377,"""Sure"", said the butcher, ""but as these are the very latest sausages, nobody has 100 million yet."
12378,"I can get you 100 million, but you'll need to pay for them as well as invest in creating a new farm to rear pigs, and a new factory to turn them in to sausages."""

12428,Got my first dose of Moderna yesterday!
12429,My partner was eligible as an essential worker and made the final appointment of the day at Walgreens.
12430,I went with him in the hopes that they'd have extra.
12431,They said that 5-10 appointments don't show every day and they're often looking for people to poke.
12432,Might be worth calling pharmacies that are offering vaccines after 5pm to see if you can come take an extra off their hands.
12433,"I got Moderna, couldn't even feel it."
12434,No problems at all.
12435,I get that.
12436,"&gt;So when NPR or CNN or whoever say it's an advantage that it's one shot, they're not wrong."
12437,They are definitely not referring to that.
12438,"They are trying go get people to get vaccinated and that's obviously very important, but I feel like they're presenting JnJ's vaccine in a very misleading way, as if it were AS EFFICACIOUS as other vaccines."
12439,"Now, I know why they're doing that."
12440,"If they talked about the existing differences and shortcomings, that would result in fewer people getting vaccinated."
12441,I still just don't like bs.
12442,"I get their motives, but I just like when people stick to facts ans are frank."
12443,"Unfortunately, many people *would* decide not to take JnJ's vaccine over one of the other ones."

12451,Our number of tests coming in at the lab absolutely tanked following Thanksgiving and never recovered.
12452,&gt;**Don't lie to people** if you want them to listen.
12453,The headline is misleading.
12454,"The headline may be poorly written, but it is 100% factually correct."
12455,The **FULL** effect doesn't occur till \~15 days after the second dose.
12456,If that headline is the ONLY thing the average joe-schmo reads/understands...then I think that is a good thing.
12457,Companies used EU and its member states public funding to develop and kickstart vaccine production in the EU.
12458,Same companies which are shipping elsewhere without meeting their obbligation with the EU.
12459,The major failure was not to ban exports when others when others were doing so.
12460,&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't this show that the vaccines are helping suppress the symptoms and not eliminate the spread?
12461,"That seems to be what this article is saying: 

&gt; Dr. Pedro Piedra, of the Baylor College of Medicine, said vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection, but they work hard at stopping people from getting seriously ill.


&gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt preclude you from getting infected, but the risks are considerably lower,‚Äù Piedra said."

12469,Metro Times is a shit rag.
12470,"This headline is helping push the ""well it isn't 100%"" crowd even further towards not getting the vaccine."
12471,Get your shot and ignore this publication.
12472,Yah but you can bet the actual cases from covid even the UK variant is grossly undercounted.
12473,Deaths are closer to being right but are also undercounted.

12481,"I guess I'm just reacting to all the Canadians and Europeans on here calling the US ""selfish"" for the past week."
12482,They can have mine when I am notified.
12483,Im a senior who has no fear of dying.
12484,well unfortunately we don't have the numbers yet.
12485,Although it's thought to be correct and we know we have no where near the amount of adults vaccinated to drop masks totally.
12486,Once we have 200 million adults it will be easier to say that but people will say they've had the shot when they haven't.
12487,I hate the damn mask but until the case number drops a bit more and we have a large portion of the population done I will wear it in stores and work.
12488,[deleted]
12489,"Yeah, except then he'd be replaced by the lieutenant governor, and he's at least as bad."
12490,I've never heard anything other than two weeks.
12491,The UK paid for the setup of a production line in the UK with the condition that the first 100M doses from that production line went to the UK.
12492,Some people want to call that blocking exports primarily as a way to justify how the EU has been acting.
12493,"&amp;#x200B;

The reality is that if someone were to produce vaccines using a different production line in the UK they could export from the first dose, and if doses from the factories in question were to be exported there would be no legal method for the UK to prevent those doses from leaving the country."
12494,"The UK could sue for breach of contract afterwards though, and I imagine the penalties would be stiff."
12495,"After the 100M vaccines are produced there's no change in export regulations, vaccines made in those factories can go anywhere else in the world without breaching  the contract."
12496,"&amp;#x200B;

The biggest differences between the EU and UK was that the UK was up front about the plans from spring last year and the companies involved planned around that, made sure that there were solid legal protections to ensure the supply, while the EU advertised that they were going to export vaccines from the start and only changed that a month ago."
12497,"I mean, you claim you didn't call it a bad vaccine."
12498,But you also didn't explicitly call it a good vaccine in your initial post either.
12499,"This quote also carries a pretty heavy implication that you probably didn't intend:

&gt;Define ""done""."
12500,Like think about if you did air quotes when you said that out loud.
12501,"""Yeah, you're 'done'""

""Sure, it's a one and (airquotes) ""done""""

Puts it in a pretty negative light doesn't it?"

12507,Some of them were waiting on a call from their hospital/doctor...
12508,I had to burst their bubble and tell them to get proactive and help them in many cases.
12509,I think the big problem is many people think someone will call them up out of the blue.

12511,"Keep dreaming, Fauci."
12512,"The point of my comment (which you obviously missed along with a few others) being US not sending vaccines to Iran has absolutely nothing to do with US sanctions, as suggested by the article."
12513,"They aren't sending vaccines to *any country*, and won't be until probably at least close to the end of the year, at the earliest."
12514,Yup.
12515,"Clerk at the gas station this morning was wearing a mask, as was the other dude in there."
12516,"I'm sitting here at work with the ""Please wear a mask"" sign on the front door and my mask close at hand."
12517,People who didn't wear masks before aren't wearing them now and those of us who did wear them are continuing to wear them.
12518,"Yeah, pretty sure we'll want to get them to Mexico first and South America after."
12519,The point behind the restrictions has been because the benefit to those higher age groups is significantly more than to the lower age groups so they had to be prioritized.
12520,It‚Äòs not about there being enough people in each group to satisfy demand.
12521,"Technically there were too many 65+ year olds to get vaccines at the beginning, so by your approach we should have started at 100+ and worked our way down year by year."
12522,The point is to allow access to groups with similar risk levels at the same time.
12523,It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people are in each group.
12524,The risk to everyone below 50 is similar enough that they will most likely all be opened up to everyone at once.
12525,It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people that is.

12531,"I can origami/staple a surgical mask to fit because it's so flexible, but it's less filtering and I can't figure a way to alter these N95s in a similar fashion."
12532,They should have just kept the mandate for 2 to 3 more months.
12533,We're so goddamn close to the end of this.
12534,Georgia and Maryland have been a mess.
12535,I feel bad.

12538,"Instead of joining the world effort, you seem to be greedy"
12539,"I think it will be quite uncommon, and unnecessary for the vast majority of people, but I could see this happening."
12540,Just look at how effective masks are against the flu - a cloth mask for a few months could save many lives of the elderly or immunocompromised if they choose to wear one.
12541,"Do you mean they swab inside the nostril vs the deep nasal ""brain"" swab?"
12542,"Or they're using the smaller nasal swabs vs the deep nasal ""brain"" swab?"
12543,Explain having fewer deaths per capita than Texas?
12544,I hate people who make this sort of stupid argument (post above yours not you).
12545,It‚Äôs just fully dishonest.
12546,"His source is talking about a different state than where the rally was held, it‚Äôs not some conclusive study that says bike rallies kill 1 out of every 450k people."

12550,That's still bigger than Wyoming and Vermont.
12551,Alaska is simply doing an excellent job.
12552,My Dad is in the same boat as your mom.
12553,I think it's scary for some people being among the first to be vaccinated.
12554,"In a month or so, so many more will be vaccinated and living their normal lives."
12555,I'm sure people like my dad and your mom will get on board as more and more people get vaccinated and resume normal life.
12556,I got my first Moderna a week ago.
12557,It hurt for a few days but not debilitating and went away.
12558,Yesterday I got a rash and big itchy welt and knot right at the injection site.
12559,This guy is getting really annoying.
12560,"I agree, kind of."
12561,"Age is a big factor on who dies (91% over 55), so it definitely should be considered."
12562,"And, it's also the easiest way to verify."
12563,"Also, getting everyone over 55 vaccinated shouldn't take that much longer... probably by the end of April."
12564,"But, you're right."
12565,We also need to find a way to get others vaccinated that meet certain criteria.
12566,Do you have a link for this?
12567,I‚Äôd like to share it
12568,"To reach herd immunity, yes (unless you can convince 100% of adults to get vaccinated)."
12569,"Also, even mild Covid in adults is associated with long term health effects -- I don't think it's been ruled out for kids."
12570,Death rate isn't the whole story.
12571,It's been in use in the uk for months now.
12572,It's been shown to be effective and it's safe.
12573,Why would it not be approved.
12574,Probably not till June because we need eQuItY
12575,source?
12576,Word
12577,My mom is over 65 and diabetic.
12578,She got a call from Kaiser 2 weeks ago to set up an appointment.
12579,My dad is 63 and has no comorbidities.
12580,He hasn‚Äôt gotten a call from Kaiser yet.
12581,We‚Äôre pretty sure Kaiser is using a cut off that is exactly 65 or almost exactly 65.
12582,CA is still in Phase 1B so they‚Äôre rolling out to those over 65 and those in certain essential jobs.
12583,Haven‚Äôt heard much of the bypassing in CA other than in the initial rollout disaster at Stanford and other hospitals
12584,The private sector should take over 95%.
12585,These doses would be administered in a few hours flat
12586,time to hop on Vaccine Finder dot org and see if you can get one sooner than waiting on a list
12587,"I heard, maybe on here, that because they don‚Äôt need to be kept at a specific temp and it‚Äôs one shot, the J&amp;J will be used to go ‚Äúdoor to door‚Äù so to speak and bring vaccines to people that may not be able to get to a vaccination site."
12588,"Maybe not all 100M, but it‚Äôs a good thought."
12589,BMI over 30 is included.
12590,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

12595,"i don't think US approval for AZN is a ""when"", but very much still an ""if"""
12596,People hear the news that others are getting vaccinated and immediately get relaxed and over-confident.
12597,Pfizer are way behind just like the other vaccine manufacturers.
12598,reason 7: Money
12599,People who live in nursing homes aren't the ones who are ending up in the hospital.
12600,Because every single person over 50 hasn't had the opportunity to decline a vaccine yet lol.
12601,fuck these politicians
12602,"Right, nothing is known until it's known."
12603,I do think it was smart for J&amp;J to trial the 1-dose first instead of the other way around.
12604,"It lets them get the vaccine approved faster, and by the time people would need the booster their 2-dose data will likely be out and possibly even approved."
12605,I'm slated to get the J&amp;J this Saturday and am fully expecting to get a 2nd shot of it this summer lol
12606,"I'm glad you didn't even include DC, because they are doing a piss poor job too"

12618,Disease.
12619,It's been terrifying watching how many people are willing to run head first into the first airborne blood disease that society has faced.
12620,Someone said the same thing to me in this thread.
12621,Do you have actual source or no?
12622,Curious myself.
12623,"Word, my 92 grandma just wants them to reopen the senior center so she can see all of her friends again instead of being locked in her apartment."
12624,(My state has already vaccinated the elderly).
12625,"From the virus itself, to the handling of patients and nursing homes, to the side effects of isolations, senior citizens definitely got the short end of the stick with this pandemic."
12626,Could be.
12627,Another possibility is to have more J&amp;J doses on hand in case their 2-dose regimen trial underway yields positive results.
12628,They might make a second dose available to people who had already gotten the first dose.
12629,"If the effectiveness can be bumped up from 70 to 80+% (like Astrazeneca 12-week delay 2-dose regimen shown in UK), then a second dose of J&amp;J is probably warranted."
12630,"Although the 1-dose J&amp;J is basically 100% effective against hospitalization and death in trials (like Pfizer/Moderna), if we could halve the remaining likelihood of becoming ill or very ill with the J&amp;J it would be nice."
12631,"Covid-19 is still highly infectious and it would just be nice not to have to lay in bed for 1-2 weeks if people get sick with it, or possibly pass it on to others."
12632,"&gt;I do in fact experience flu symptoms pretty reliably, even when vaccinated."
12633,"Those are the times you *know* you've had it, though."
12634,It isn't all or nothing.
12635,You can't say for sure whether or not you've ever asymptomatically infected someone.
12636,*No one* can.
12637,"You‚Äîor I‚Äîcould very well have killed someone by unknowingly spreading a disease before now, but that's *not your fault*."
12638,"That leads me to my next point...

&gt;No, people are not just disease vectors, but they are disease vectors when there is a contagious disease about."
12639,...which is that there are *always* contagious diseases spreading.
12640,That's just part of being human.
12641,It's all about risk management.
12642,"Every day, we make choices that could kill us or those around us."
12643,"In fact, the people being referenced in the original post are likely in *way* more danger from their motorcycles than they are from COVID."
12644,"My life isn't your life isn't their life, though, so we're all making these calculations differently."
12645,"This is what people were talking about when they mentioned the ""social end"" of the pandemic."
12646,We're there.
12647,Everyone has a point where they decide there's more to living life than just avoiding death.
12648,"For some, that was last March."
12649,"For others, they'd be content to live this way indefinitely."
12650,"Neither is ""right"" or ""wrong."""
12651,"As I said, the one and only thing DeSantis did right was to lock down the nursing homes."
12652,The rest of his strategy was based on lies and withholding information...  and taking care of political donors at the expense of public health.
12653,Did he luck out in that vaccines were rolled out right after he opened up the nursing homes?
12654,"Possibly, but luck is not a strategy, and the death toll is much higher than it would have been under competent leadership."
12655,How much better is impossible to tell in part because he has been so consistently dishonest in reporting and has sought to punish everyone from data scientists to school districts who dared to report actual unmolested data.
12656,Defend that bullshit all you want.
12657,Thousands if deaths or more in FL are directly attributable to his disinformation and lack of leadership.
12658,We'll see how many in a month or two when (if) they finally get counted.
12659,That‚Äôs just sad.
12660,We are all humans and the US and other countries shouldn‚Äôt ignore the Russian vaccine.
12661,"We are all in the same situation trying to get out of this pandemic, give them a shot."
12662,Yeah they just got up and running sooner in the EU because countries like Britain ordered early.
12663,I think the saddest yet most amusing line in her whole livestream about it was ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was Asian!
12664,"I thought he was Indian.‚Äù Then says how she loves Asians, and that she always calls people what she called him."
12665,Like she actually thought she was justifying something there.
12666,I have asthma and am trying to find information on high-risk adults.
12667,I live in Nebraska and they used to have high-risk adults regardless of age in group 1C.
12668,Now group 1C is for people in congregate living residences.
12669,"I checked CDC's website about half an hour ago and it said the same thing, 1C was for people in congregate living residences."
12670,Nowhere on either rollout schedule did it mention anything about adults with high risk medical conditions.
12671,I tried searching for news articles about the change in the rollout schedule and couldn't find anything.
12672,"Now when I go back to CDC website I checked half an hour ago it is back to the original schedule, having high risk adults in 1C."
12673,The website no longer mentions anything about people in congregate living situations.
12674,"&amp;#x200B;

12675,"&gt; and i do understand it is a better, more global indicator

A week is a better indicator than a month?"
12676,Yes sure!
12677,Because of the vaccinations death is down to a third of what it was beginning of January.
12678,Infections in nursing homes is 15% the level of end December 2020.
12679,"Once the risk groups are vaccinated there might be precautions to keep infections lower, but we will see a much more normal daily life."
12680,"Slowly, we‚Äôre getting to a better place."
12681,"It very well could be, in which case that 20x/day quantity makes a lot more sense."
12682,I hope you both wore your masks and had the windows open for that drive.
12683,"&gt;could be the best single shot

Could be."
12684,Hopefully they do a follow-up analysis like AZ.
12685,"&gt;That said, I'm like 99.999% certain they will recommend a booster after the new data drops, if for no other reason than increasing duration of immunity."
12686,Definitely agree.
12687,"Sure, argue about semantics all you want."
12688,"Meanwhile, how many doses have been exported from the UK?"
12689,How many from the EU?
12690,"If there were UK vaccine exports, the British press or the government would point to it in their statements."
12691,"Like they would say, look, we have exported 10 million doses to Chile or wherever."
12692,The fact that they haven't done that seems to imply strongly that no such exports have been made.
12693,"All they're saying is ""we don't ban exports, that's outrageous""."
12694,"But the proof is in the pudding, as they say."
12695,"The UK has, via prohibiting contracts or political pressure, enacted a de facto ban on vaccine exports."
12696,Everything else is just semantics.
12697,Right.
12698,We‚Äôre essentially agreeing.
12699,"Yes, give us that fear-mongering, AZ-hating German media."
12700,Now that's quality.

12704,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worthwhile to redistribute surplus due to logistics issues as you have said.
12705,I do think it would be a good idea to shift future allocations based on demand.
12706,Regional shortages are a state issue but big disparities in per capita dose allocation are a federal issue.
12707,[removed]
12708,And if we don't manage to vaccinate enough people we'll be right back in lockdown by November 2021.
12709,Joe Rogan did exactly this.
12710,All his friends got covid and then they lost power because the grid froze.
12711,He still hasn't changed his tune and is now convinced the virus was made in a lab.
12712,Womp womp.
12713,Very nice
12714,"Thing is, I agree with you that the one-shot is a bit not a gimmick, but not because of efficacy."
12715,"The one-shot is more than effective enough and given enough time to measure sure, could be the best single shot."
12716,"That said, I'm like 99.999% certain they will recommend a booster after the new data drops, if for no other reason than increasing duration of immunity."
12717,Reddit is an American technology company based in California.
12718,"If you‚Äôre here on an American-centric website, it‚Äôs usually implied that the geographic location being discussed is the United States unless stated otherwise."
12719,"i do understand that

and i do understand it is a better, more global indicator

if you are a pessimist, surely you try to avoid wanting to find or appreciate positive trends,

but thats not my Problem"
12720,But does it loose it's edge that fast?
12721,In one year?
12722,Not saying you arent right but do you have any scientific sources for that opinion because I would love if that was a fact.
12723,Thanks.
12724,I've been to Georgia on quite a few occasions.
12725,"They definitely have no shortage of obese people, that's for sure."
12726,This was from my EMS hospital rounds from some months back.
12727,The infection graph took a sharp turn and flattened out between the 7-10 day mark.

12729,Read the article.
12730,Do you even stop for a moment to read beyond the headline?
12731,Meanwhile in New York by next month it will expand to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts and TD Bank employees but only for those with E in their shoe sizes.
12732,I don‚Äôt think so.
12733,"The 60+ group was 900k and this next group (50+ and type 2) is around 1.5 million, so that is almost 2.5 million becoming eligible within 2 weeks."

12738,"if y'all had to guess, when do you think we'll see other states dropping restrictions?"
12739,I think we'll be seeing most adults be elligble to get the vaccine by the end of the month.
12740,My city keeps dropping the age limit and requirements to get it since they seem to have a ton of vaccines.
12741,I agree that another surge will occur but its not to think nothing will be done is wrong.
12742,"Once hospitals fill up again, there is no other choice whether theres public support or not."
12743,i say let the morbidly obese die that would save billions a year
12744,"Wow, 32 million of doses just sitting on shelves?"
12745,A third of what has been administered?
12746,Time to open this and no need to withhold second doses anymore.
12747,The supply will be there.
12748,"But if it's spreading in the less vulnerable population, since it can't get a toehold in the vulnerable due to vaccines, then it is effectively inoculating the population that can't access vaccines at the moment, thus closing the gap to herd immunity even faster."
12749,"Not an ideal situation, but a more-infectious but samesy risk variant might actually be helpful now that we're in the endgame."
12750,Yeah.
12751,I was ready to post snarky comments till I actually looked up the town.
12752,It is 49 min drive to downtown Ft. Worth.
12753,There is NO WAY there aren't a large portion of the folks living there commuting.
12754,"Not to mention according to the article the school district has 1,400 students...which clearly means they draw from a wider area."
12755,900k per *day*?
12756,Where are you seeing 900k per week?
12757,This is like watching a bigrig jackknife 10 cars ahead of you.
12758,"It's probably not gonna hit you directly, but damn if it isn't gonna fuck up your day."
12759,"&gt;This could also explain why J&amp;J was 85% effective against severe disease at 28 days, but increased to 100% after 49 days

Okay, that is a solid argument."
12760,Hopefully they do a follow-up with same participants then.
12761,AZ did.
12762,&gt;Perhaps I should word it differently.
12763,Giving the second dose prematurely stalls/limits the increase in efficacy.
12764,"It doesn't literally reduce efficacy in a mechanistic sense, it prevents it from reaching what would be a higher efficacy if the first dose were allowed to reach its peak."
12765,"The end result essentially being the same as ""lowering""."
12766,Nope üòÇüòÇ.
12767,I understood what you meant.
12768,My explanation was for that haha.
12769,"I give you my word, that's not how the immune system works."
12770,It's almost definitely just a result of a wide CI.
12771,"Yeah there are a lot of steps in the pipeline:

\- Moderna tells CDC doses are ready

\- CDC tell states doses are ready

\- States order doses

\- Doses delivered to states

\- States administer doses

There's a non-trivial lag in every step."
12772,I hope other countries are taking notes on what is creating bottlenecks and planning for a smooth rollout.
12773,"Like if I were Canadian and once vaccine starts pouring in, if the scheduling website crashes under load and they're all like ""there was no way we could have foreseen this much demand"" and it takes them a couple weeks to fix it I would be pissed."
12774,Guess what all those stores have in common?

12776,I‚Äôm not sure exactly what you want me to do with your ‚Äúadfontesmedia‚Äù article.

12780,"I signed up my dad on February 21 and it said he's 192,275th."
12781,But it's probably highly location-based and depending on sites to sign up to get people in.
12782,Do you think we have the infrastructure capacity to ramp up to 4-5 million shots per day?
12783,I've been assuming the supply is going to outpace our ability to deliver shots.
12784,Some form of return to normality in 7-15 months?
12785,"Here in the Netherlands they will start easing the lockdown next month and gradually open towards the summer, along with most other European countries."
12786,This is pure fear mongering propaganda.
12787,First to offer vaccines.
12788,First to offer universal basic income to all Alaska residents!
12789,They really need to open up eligibility.
12790,I have never seen it so easy to make an appointment these past few days.
12791,Either they need to advertise better or move on.
12792,The town is 49 minutes drive (had to look it up) from Dallas/Ft.Worth area that has 7.5 million people.
12793,There is no way a town that close to that area doesn't have a large portion of commuters.
12794,[removed]
12795,Only about 50% of the population got flu shots last year and that's for the entire flu season.
12796,"The US have not done a massive vaccination feat like this in recent times and I don't trust the government, distribution and medical sites not to fuck up and create a bottleneck."
12797,"In the next day or two, we'll hit 25% of adults having at least their first shot."
12798,"By May 1, I think that should be 50%."
12799,Just got an email today from my employer (local government) that all employees who want a vaccine will now be considered in group 1b.
12800,Woohoo!
12801,They sent us a link for an employee waitlist.
12802,I hope I get called soon!

12804,Fungal spores or wind pollinated trees.
12805,"IMO, I think in the next days and weeks we‚Äôll see more stages go the Alaska route and just open up it up to everyone."
12806,It‚Äôll be more enticing as they realize opening it up to everyone might mean opening up quicker than anticipated.
12807,"And furthermore, the more days we pass, the more supply we get it which makes it more likely they‚Äôll open it up to everyone."
12808,[deleted]
12809,But county rules supercede state rules in Illinois.
12810,"For example, I live in DuPage County."
12811,"While I qualify based on state rules, the county has chosen not to expand."
12812,"The premise is that certain areas of the state have excess vaccine, and need to expand."
12813,However the more populated areas don't have the same issue yet.
12814,It's a little frustrating.
12815,Perhaps I should word it differently.
12816,Giving the second dose prematurely stalls/limits the increase in efficacy.
12817,"It doesn't literally reduce efficacy in a mechanistic sense, it prevents it from reaching what would be a higher efficacy if the first dose were allowed to reach its peak."
12818,"The end result essentially being the same as ""lowering""."
12819,"On the note of J&amp;J, it isn't just behavioral."
12820,"They measured efficacy at 28 days, but we know from the previous phases that antibody levels for J&amp;J don't peak until about 50 days."
12821,"This could also explain why J&amp;J was 85% effective against severe disease at 28 days, but increased to 100% after 49 days."
12822,"It'd be nice if the allocation was more dynamic, though."
12823,"""Oh your county blew through its allocation?"
12824,Have some extra.
12825,Oh your county is sitting on so many doses you had to open up eligibility?
12826,"We're going to pull back a bit on your allocation."""
12827,"Doses administered, as of March 7:

United States 90.4 million 

United Kingdom 23.3 million"
12828,"So that is with an assumption of 240,000 vaccinations per day."
12829,"Later in the article they mention how the expectation for April is 400,000 a day, 500,000 a day in May, and 600,000 a day in June."
12830,Why even give a prediction that rests on an assumption that we already know is not correct?
12831,I'm convinced some of these health officials are literally dumb as rocks.
12832,"I‚Äôve only had the first shot, my arm was sore for a day but nothing else."
12833,"My husband has had both, he was fatigued for about 24 hours after both."

12844,What are the odds a spray tan ingredient would be toxic vs a vaccine?
12845,Occam's razor ...
12846,Let me start by saying I really do appreciate this discussion despite the fact we disagree on quite a few things.
12847,"That said:

&gt;These types of comments and articles were buried in the media."
12848,"They were met with derision and false accusations, especially on this coronavirus sub."
12849,I agree the media is terrible at reporting and I personally try not to rely on the media to decide anything.
12850,There's the old saying about reading the news paper about the thing you're an expert in and you'll see that they have no idea.
12851,To cut down on the media I think we can simply look at the excess death rate over the past 52 weeks and see something's clearly killing a lot more people than normal [(Source)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm).
12852,The excess death count is actually higher than the covid death count.
12853,So clearly something is very wrong and people are dying in greater numbers.
12854,"So even if someone had covid and was in a car accident and we called it a ""covid death"" we know for a fact over the past 12 months a ton of people have died."
12855,If it's not covid what is it?
12856,"Did the lockdowns really kill 500,000 people and covid zero?"
12857,I'm sure the lockdowns did in fact kill people but if it killed enough to affect the excess death count in this way then that would be instantly noticeable in a way the media could not hide.
12858,If Covid was a non issue it'd show in these numbers in a way the media couldn't lie about.
12859,"""Something"" is killing a lot of people and it started exactly when covid started."
12860,If it wasn't covid what is it?
12861,Secondary I know it's anecdotal but if we're not trusting the media I have to trust what I can assuredly trust and that's my friends who are nurses in several NYC hospitals.
12862,They went through hell in march.
12863,"If nothing else, to me personally, I have an undeniable confidence that many many many people died in NYC due to covid who wouldn't have died."
12864,My friends saw dozens if not hundreds with their view own eyes.
12865,I've known them for over 20 years I know they're not lying.
12866,"While it may not mean anything to you (after all, I'm just some guy on the internet, I could be lying), it means something to me personally."
12867,"Unless covid deaths were 100% funneled only to my friends and the rest of the city/nation didn't really deal with it, I can make a leap to say what my friends saw at their hospitals was wide spread across the city, and as reported across the nation."
12868,"&gt;When my wife and I went to the doctor to discover if he needed surgery, I was prevented from going back with him because covid measures."
12869,"Later this year, I will be the only one who can visit my son in the hospital after his surgery because of covid measures."
12870,I get it it's very very hard.
12871,"Almost a full year ago my father was in a serious accident, we didn't know if he would make it."
12872,"This was just as the lockdowns started, getting anyone to talk to us from the hospital was very hard."
12873,He wasn't conscious for two weeks and it was basically a hell to go through.
12874,We weren't able to see him for THREE MONTHS due to a lengthy hospital stay followed by a rehab center - all closed to visits.
12875,"Also due to covid several surgeries were ignored, his arm and leg will never be the same and that was preventable if the hospital staff wasn't completely inundated dealing with covid."
12876,He suffered a stroke as a result of the accident and hasn't been the same since.
12877,Absolutely shitty year.
12878,What I don't see is how this affects the vaccine?
12879,I already think the lockdowns went too far.
12880,"My friends who were nurses never caught covid, they literally wore fucking garbage bags to work due to a lack of PPE and reused ""one time use"" masks for WEEKS."
12881,And that was enough to protect them.
12882,"So it's shitty my mom couldn't visit my father even though we owned serious masks with respirators and eye protection while nurses were literally finding things on the floor to use for PPE and managing to not get sick (also quite a few nurses did get sick, my friends did get lucky overall)."
12883,But the vaccine should be spread far and wide and should be as encouraged as possible.
12884,It's how we get out of this.
12885,My family are immigrants - they all believe in all sorts of crap and many don't want the vaccine due to irrational fears (like covid came from space?
12886,"Even if true wtf does that have to dow with a vaccine, but my Aunt won't take it since covid came from space)."
12887,These same people will inject themselves with random stuff given by a literal witchdoctor (I wish I was joking).
12888,&gt;Has it been held to the same rigorous evaluation of previous vaccines?
12889,No.
12890,I mean I have a serious point here and it's that: By what mechanism could a vaccine do harm?
12891,What I mean from this is I really haven't heard of anything with as low quantity as a vaccine having a delayed effect.
12892,"If it doesn't kill you fast, or hurt you fast, how would it have an effect 3 months later?"
12893,"A vaccine works by making your body create antibodies, but the vaccine itself is out of your system quickly."
12894,I'm not sure exact time but it's only days maybe 1-2 weeks before your body expels everything.
12895,"What's left over are antibodies not ""vaccine""."
12896,So how could a vaccine harm you 3 months from now?
12897,We've also given the vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people and we're not seeing any issues 3 months down the line.
12898,"I'm not depending on the news solely, I've sought out information on the vaccine to see possible harm it can do and I can't find anything."
12899,"Only things i can find are potential immediate-effects, and maybe interactions with certain types of conditions (autoimmune disorders for example), but for a healthy person there is zero mechanism for delayed harm, and immediate harm we'd know about already due the millions of doses given."
12900,"I think it's good to be skeptical of things, I got my first dose already and I sure as hell looked up information because I agree it seems rushed."
12901,But in my research I couldn't locate anything that said this could be harmful EXCEPT for immediate onset issues within days of taking the vaccine.
12902,"Given the fact millions of others already got the vaccine before me, I felt okay knowing the only real risk is anaphylaxis - I have a deadly peanut allergy so I carry an epipen with me anyways."
12903,"I would've hesitated to take in December, maybe even January, but by now i have confidence we'd know if it wasn't safe."
12904,[deleted]
12905,"As I understand it, the data was not available in August, so back then the Russian data was called insufficient in Western media."
12906,The data was then publicized only after the Western media attention had already moved on to different topics.
12907,And their numbers sounded too good to be true until Pfizer and others came out with similar numbers.
12908,"Add in the amount of politicization of Sputnik V in Russia, the well-known shenanigans and propaganda pieces of Russian government, and add in a bit of Russophobia, and there you have your cocktail."
12909,"I‚Äôm going to Orlando next week, can‚Äôt wait!"
12910,Abbott is an absolute shitstain of a governor.
12911,You are literally diminishing their harms and actions so they aren‚Äôt seen as in such a harsh light.
12912,That‚Äôs defending them.
12913,It is the third option.
12914,We don't even have all our most vulnerable people vaccinated yet.
12915,Shareholders would panic sell and the board would all get shit canned
12916,Yellow fever is a thing.

12920,They‚Äôre just recycling headlines from last year at this point
12921,In about a year.
12922,It'll kill more than the civil war before it's done.
12923,That's one deadly hoax.
12924,It‚Äôs someone trying to use a legal establishment for law enforcement as punishment to harass persons of color because the perpetrator feels that he has more power in the situation due to his skin color.
12925,That fucking matters.
12926,That is never ok.  That should be talked about.
12927,It isn‚Äôt the first time.
12928,Just like police are used to harass persons of color so is ICE and the public should have to recognize that and think about it.
12929,My mom‚Äôs going to Florida to visit my aunt next week.
12930,"They‚Äôre both vaccinated, and they‚Äôre just going to hang out in the pool the entire week."

12937,That does sound really frustrating.
12938,"A lot of doctors are condescending like that, especially about mental health but also about physical health."
12939,In my experience - yes and no.
12940,"I talked to my doctor about some physical health concerns, mentioned some mental health concerns (it wasn't my main focus), and she took it pretty seriously."
12941,"She offered to put me on antidepressants, actually."
12942,I was surprised how readily it was offered.
12943,She also referred me to my health care provider's mental health office.
12944,I've tried calling them to make an appointment and they're pretty obviously underfunded and understaffed.
12945,It's disheartening.
12946,And a little disorienting to me that therapy is turning out to be way more inaccessible for me than meds.
12947,I always sort of thought it would be the other way around.
12948,"‚ÄúAppears‚Äù is the same as speculation, so there isnt any proof whatsoever (which was what i was alluding to at the start)."
12949,So do yourself and everyone else a huge favour and stop spreading bs crackpot theories.
12950,&gt;Arizona is the same.
12951,No state wide masking requirement but individual cities and counties could create one.
12952,Might as well list every single state while we're at it.
12953,It's like this everywhere.
12954,"Early on in the pandemic, Texas banned cities and counties implementing their own restrictions."
12955,They were all invalidated by the state.

12963,"Well its not republicans, they're against easier access to birth control and better sex education, both proven to lower the rates of abortions."
12964,"The issue is, they want people to be forced to have children."
12965,"More kids means future soliders, consumers, voters and or fonder for the private prison system."
12966,"Its not about saving babies or children, if it was they would be passing way more child health laws and programs for struggling families vs draconian abortion laws that do more harm than good."

13004,Well good thing nobody asked you because that's a very high death rate.
13005,That's over ten million in the us alone.
13006,But I'm glad you know better than everyone else.
13007,I‚Äôm in the Jansen 2 shot trial and I had a sore arm and symptoms of a mild cold for a few days after the first shot.
13008,Just had the second and the sore arm is back but just a bad headache this time.
13009,I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôve had the vaccine now but I‚Äôm due to be offered one in the next month so I‚Äôll be unblinded then anyway.
13010,Got the J&amp;J on Friday.
13011,I was really sick Friday night and Sat.
13012,"Temperature, chills, headache, etc."

13017,Nice!
13018,Remember two months ago.
13019,Early January and we were finally starting to come down from an insane surge in the US.
13020,Vaccines were only for healthcare workers and nursing homes and it was a complete mess.
13021,We were hoping to have all American adults vaccinated by the fall.
13022,Just two months later and cases are plummeting.
13023,We are hitting record vaccine numbers.
13024,Over 18% of the US population has received a dose.
13025,The first state just opened vaccines up to the general population.
13026,We will have enough doses for all US adults by the end of May.
13027,Think about what life will be like two months from now.
13028,Then think about summer.
13029,üòä
13030,I live In Southamerica and looks like were gonna get the Sinovac one cause Pfizer/Modern/Oxford are all reserved for Northamerica-West Europe.
13031,Is Sinovac good?
13032,i dont know if i should wait till till Pfizer-Moderna-Oxford is full available in my country better.
13033,My parents dont wanna take the chinese ones cause they dont trust chinese products =/ but im gonna try to force them cause my aunt is right now battling covid in the icu.
13034,This virus is so dangerous  üòû
13035,And Austin is the highest quality city in the state
13036,Vaccines lead to time traveling powers some may consider‚Ä¶unnatural.
13037,We‚Äôre all moving on with our lives:) keep telling us the end is near.
13038,You blew your credibility after the Super Bowl surge mess

13056,"Sounds like Missouri, where the state is playing games with the vaccine rollout and not distributing to urban centers"
13057,Does anyone know why cases are increasing in Italy?
13058,I scheduled shots for my employees and clients and out of 15 people only 4 of us got them i was genuinely surprised
13059,Are there any records maintained that indicate why you were eligible to receive the vaccine?
13060,"(age, at risk, healthcare worker, etc?)"
13061,"I have a limited view of Florida since I don‚Äôt live there but from what I‚Äôve seen, masks are a rarity in the Orlando and surrounding areas."
13062,March 16th was the last day in the office for me.

13065,Some folks have returned to working in the office practically every day but I'm going to hold out a bit.

13067,"I‚Äôm all for reopening relatively quickly, but I don‚Äôt understand why people are so eager to get rid of mask mandates until we get the death rate down to 100 deaths a day."
13068,Mask mandates don‚Äôt do anything to impede the economy and keeps transmission down.
13069,It‚Äôs a win win.
13070,Keeping businesses shut down and restricting capacity is way more of an issue.
13071,"Any one who read up on the history of vaccines (MMR, Polio ect..) would know that this was obviously true."
13072,Anyone who read up the mRNA vaccines would have know this is true.
13073,Anyone who followed all the controversy around giving one dose to get more people vaccinated would have know this is true.
13074,"With the over whelming evidence we have so far ""Duh"" seems like the appropriate response."
13075,Are there enough people in the US as a whole who are actually getting the vaccine to even think about getting here immunity?
13076,I keep seeing sporadic news reports about vaccines going to waste because only a minority of eligible people are actually getting vaccinated.

13082,We just set records for annual flu shots administered a few months ago.
13083,So what about other peoples grandparents or people with health conditions who aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet?
13084,"Um... Not to be that guy, but isn't ""16 and over"" an eligibility requirement?"
13085,It depends on where you are.
13086,Appointments are hard to come by in a lot of places.
13087,"In those areas the bottleneck seems to be availability of providers, not vaccine doses."
13088,"We've been doing about that amount of people in the stands at NFL games for almost half a year, and so far no outbreaks."

13090,Look at the CDC studies coming out.
13091,It‚Äôs a virus.
13092,The CDC has self interest to say restrictions work and even by their estimates the interventions are single digit percentages on the overall trend.
13093,"500,000 extra deaths in a year is no big deal?"
13094,I spent half a day running to a hospital in another town to get my records and they didn‚Äôt ask either.
13095,"Really, the providers just want to immunize everyone."
13096,"As long as no elderly folks are being denied, I think more shots in arms is the main goal."
13097,Curious about the smoking.
13098,Did you need it on your medical records or did they just take your word for it?
13099,"Maybe other states are different, but the eligible ‚Äúessential workers‚Äù in my state include the obvious healthcare workers, teachers, law enforcement but also anyone who works for a manufacturing company (even if you are an office worker), engineers (also office workers), and IT professionals."
13100,At this point it just seems silly to keep creating new essential categories and would be easier to just do it by age.
13101,The expression is 'a moot point'.
13102,"I think a lot of people felt frustrated because it really stalled out at the start, missing the original promises."
13103,"Not only that, I saw healthy 16 year old part time workers on the news getting vaccinated before my 62 and 64 year old parents."
13104,I recognize it's couldn't be perfect but boy was it hard early on when it didn't feel remotely like they were prioritizing well based on actual risk.
13105,"Now I feel like pretty much all essential workers and older folks are able to get it, which really puts me at ease."
13106,"I'm not high risk, I can wait my turn."
13107,I think we may need to loosen requirements in some areas now or within a week.
13108,"In CA Newsom recently allocated 40% of our vaccines to select low income zip codes, where there are tons of essential workers, but few senior citizens."
13109,It‚Äôs probably slowing us down.
13110,"&gt;The Oxford vax losing efficacy when given the booster prematurely DOES make sense, given the effect of vector resistance."
13111,"This is why Sputnik V uses 2 different adenoviruses, to circumvent this."
13112,This should also hopefully mean the 2 dose trial for J&amp;J shows a good increase.
13113,"Not just because it'll have a booster, but because they're giving the first shot 8 weeks instead of 4."
13114,"Okay, most of what you said here makes no sense üòÇ."
13115,I swear to god I'm not trying to sound condenscending üòÇüòÇ even though it probably sounds that way.
13116,Efficacy dropping after the second dose doesn't make any immunological sense.
13117,Just take my word for it haha.
13118,Your having antibodies to the vector will only help neutralize the vector from the second dose.
13119,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are not impacted at all.
13120,They cannot be.
13121,The most that anti-vector immunity can  do is make it so that anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity doesn't improve.
13122,It cannot hinder it.
13123,It's just mechanistically not possible.
13124,You just won't get additional Spike proteins in your circulation.
13125,Worst case scenario - it's as if you didn't get that second dose at all.
13126,"In that scenario, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity is not engaged in any way."
13127,"Sputnik V then uses a different vector to prevent the vaccine from being neutralized, to allow the vector to infect our cells and to allow our cells to then produce the Spike protein."
13128,"That spike protein then stimulates the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity and intensifies proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive B and T cells and ramps up germinal center reactions, allowing for prolonged immune memory and also higher affinity antibodies (more potent antibodies, not just increased number/titre)."
13129,Hopefully I explained it well.
13130,"Edit: Again, JnJ didn't measure it prematurely."
13131,"Efficacy HAS to increase over time, but that is mostly due to placebo group people being way more likely to get infected over time."
13132,A lot faster like in South Africa or Manaus?
13133,There's a lag between newly available supply and more administration capacity opening up.
13134,Generally providers only open appointments for doses that they know they have.
13135,Somehow I knew you were a stickler for the rules.
13136,Before this pandemic I saw the world (or at least the US) as existing in a left/right dichotomy.
13137,"I was, and still am, firmly on the left."
13138,What's really surprised me is the emergence (or at least the revealing) of the authoritarian/libertarian divide.
13139,"It's certainly eye-opening to see BLM supporters, for example, go hard for further state and police intervention into society when it comes to COVID."
13140,"Fear flushes the chumps, I suppose."
13141,"Anyway, have a safe and healthy day!"
13142,"[https://www.turbovax.info/](https://www.turbovax.info/) \- There's 50,000 appointments in NYC available right now."

13149,"At least for me, I had no idea I would get a vaccine."
13150,Just a pleasant surprise when they said circle your name if you want one and we'll do what we can.
13151,"Maybe for a week, but when those big centers all get up and running it probably won‚Äôt be too hard."
13152,It is actually opened up in TX.

13154,Vaccinated or unvaccinated?
13155,Administration is when the shot goes into an arm.
13156,Distribution is when a medical provider gets doses in the mail.

13170,It has manufacturing plants in UK and the EU.
13171,It needs to fulfill its contract with Canada.
13172,It chooses to deliver only from the EU.
13173,Why?
13174,"Because the UK has, via prohibiting contracts or political pressure, enacted a de facto ban on vaccine exports."
13175,Everything else is just semantics.

13180,1.6 thousand?
13181,&gt;How many days in a row are we on where distribution is twice as high as administration?
13182,It's somewhat misleading to look at distribution numbers from Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
13183,"About half the distributions for the week are reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and almost all of the remainder is reported on three other days, Thursdays through Saturdays."
13184,"So, it's two days in a row that the reported distribution number was double the administrated number."
13185,Last week it was also just two days in a row on Tuesday and Wednesday.
13186,"That said, the reported distribution figures (averaged over the prior 7 days) has been around three million a day for two weeks, and the 7-day average of administered doses has been about 70% of that total for the past week, so there's probably significant room for improvement while demand exceeds supply."
13187,Unless the person administering the vaccine injects it into the sinovial tissue of the joint causing [SIRVA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347325/).
13188,Apparently it‚Äôs pretty unpleasant.
13189,What do you think they're doing in Kalamazoo

13192,Is there a source for this somewhere?
13193,I got the first dose of the Pfizer shot a few days ago.
13194,My friend wants my help in moving into an apartment this weekend.
13195,I will be on day 8 after the first dose by that point.
13196,"I still intend to wear mask and try to social distance, but I'm worried that I'll still have a chance of catching the virus."
13197,It makes me hesitant in helping my friend.
13198,Do we have any sources on if there's any immunity after a week?
13199,I know i've met you on here before and I like you man.
13200,If you're ever in NC I will get you a beer.
13201,It depends on the state.
13202,"I work in the emergency department and in the beginning, only the people I know in healthcare had it, so in my family it was my mom and I first... then my 95 year old great-grandmother, then my 70+ grandparents, and now my dad can get it because Ohio just opened it to 50 and over."
13203,Which feels like a good representation of how it‚Äôs slowly getting opened to wide availability
13204,I don't understand I am in Nashville and it seems like everyone is getting vaccinated.
13205,My question is: Why has the US taken a blind eye on the Sputnik V?
13206,It‚Äôs super impressive and in hindsight has had much more data to prove than the other 3 vaccines.
13207,It‚Äôs been approved in Russia since August so think about that.
13208,as someone that had a measles scare march of 2019 and has a child that is vaccinated against it too I was pissed.
13209,Initial diagnosis was Measles and we as parents were fuming.

13221,"oh I'm not sure, I just know it's not the case in Maryland where I moved from"
13222,Vaccinations seem to be moving forwards in all states at full speed still.
13223,I'm glad the US vaccination effort is going far better than the initial pandemic response.
13224,You linked a hearsay article from a local TV station reporting on the reports of someone else.
13225,Yet you are unable to produce the original reports from the universities.
13226,Do these original reports exist and if they do are they reputable?
13227,Who knows?
13228,What is clear is that you can't produce them or you would have.
13229,A search for your terms in English showed Lanclet articles about the scandal where the president took the vaccine first but there was absolutely no mention of 11% efficacy.
13230,"The question becomes: why would the president take a worse vaccine in a scandal, when they could've picked any vaccine for the same scandal?"
13231,"Your own health ministry contradicts this: https://elcomercio.pe/lima/sucesos/vacunacion-covid-19-minsa-dice-que-la-efectividad-de-la-vacuna-de-sinopharm-es-de-7934-segun-ensayos-en-emiratos-arabes-unidos-coronavirus-nndc-noticia/

They note that it is impossible for efficacy to be judged right now, as the blinds have not been lifted yet so you don't know who actually has the vaccine and who doesn't."
13232,Meanwhile Lanclet published a globally reviewed paper that I showed in my previous post that showed 99% neutralizing antibody seroconversion for the vaccine (generally correlated with immunity) as well as multiple sources reporting 80-90% phase 3 efficacy rates from multiple other countries.
13233,"So do I believe hearsay from a small, newly founded privately owned TV station without original article corroboration, or the results from multiple countries and a major independent medical publisher?"

13243,"Comparing two weeks ago booking an appointment for a relative to today, the exact same pharmacies went from like 6 slots per day, to dozens, like 12 hours every 3 minutes."

13247,While the overall effectiveness is lower it doesn't matter if the symptoms are reduced to nothing more than mild sniffles.
13248,"Right, but my point is that it isnt as simple as as looking at stats and deciding to change things up."
13249,"When vaccines first became available to the states until very recently, one of the vaccines required very specialized transport and storage, making logistics very difficult and making virtually impossible to re-distribute a present surplus in one area to another area with a greater need."
13250,"As production and availability has increased, so has our options."
13251,"Alaska is probably one of the more challenging states due to how remote people are, so usage statistics from first availability is probably not a very useful stat."

13314,"Look, I get making sure people aren't buying their way into early doses, but we didn't need a panel that held up rolling out ANY doses whatsoever until they agreed upon a fair rollout plan."
13315,"I mean, populations we knew were susceptible--elderly and health compromised, and direct health care workers--weren't getting the vaccine when they should have because a committee was debating how to handle rollout in general."

13428,"If someone doesn‚Äôt want to get the vaccine, that‚Äôs their problem."
13429,"It‚Äôs my view that a lot of people who are anti-vax or on the fence will come around in due time, likely when it becomes easier to get a vaccine."
13430,Absurd article with the averagely awful quality of the british media.
13431,They are.

13433,These articles are getting annoying.

13460,"no, those who die will be 100% more dead"
13461,"&gt; best healthcare in the world

EU healthcare varies wildly depending on which country you are in, less so in what's available but definitely in terms of beds and infrastructure."
13462,"As an example one of the poorer countries Portugal has a national healthcare system that was nearing collapse in certain regions *before* the pandemic hit, anyone who could afford to go private went private (and got excellent care)."
13463,One of the universal correlations is that the poorer the country the worse their health service.

13465,MO definitely has this problem.
13466,An 80 year old family member in an urban area there has been trying to get a vaccine appointment since January while rural counties are holding vax events that are 50% booked or less in many cases.
13467,It‚Äôs ridiculous.

13476,"However, if it wanted to it could build new facilities and make vaccines for whoever and the government wouldn't be able to stop them."
13477,Only had my first shot so far.
13478,I had some chills probably 8-10 hours after the shot and they were gone the next morning.

13493,&gt; Focusing on a single days numbers is not super useful since reporting is nowhere near perfect.
13494,"Sure, you have to look at the trend."
13495,"Unfortunately, the CDC only shows totals and individual days, they don't compile the distributed trend."
13496,"RIght now, we are averaging just under 2M a day over 7 days (will top 2M again this week)."

We vaccinate enough Americans that the virus can no longer effectively spread through the population, and it becomes very rare, with only occasional cases coming in from unvaccinated countries and then fizzling out."
13503,"This is ""herd immunity""."
13504,"We vaccinate everyone who wants it, but that leaves enough people for the disease to circulate in indefinitely, but at a much lower level than current levels."

13518,I worked at a restaurant in the summer outside in 90+ degree weather with a mask.
13519,The mask sucked and I removed it when i was alone and had the chance.
13520,"I complained, but i still fucking wore it, because there are worse things in the world than wearing a mask."

https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/az-nets-396m-downpayment-for-300m-plus-eu-vaccine-doses

US paid $1.2 billion, EU paid ‚Ç¨336 million on top of previous ‚Ç¨750 million from Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands."
13527,So amounts seem similar and timeframes as well.
13528,What's your basis that the EU hasn't funded the vaccines?
13529,"Clearly there has been investment in production, since they are having to produce not only their own supply, but also enough to export tens of millions per month."

13536,"61.1m vaccinated now, there are 255m total adults in the US."
13537,"That would mean we need 193.9m more people to get vaccinated, to do it for the next 3 months (92 days to June 10) at 12 hours per day would mean about 49 per second, not 76."
13538,It's not that hard to see it going up with supply.
13539,"So, my mom currently has one dose."
13540,She received it two weeks ago.
13541,"I am potentially going back into school next week and I was wondering, if I were to contract covid and spread it to her, would the disease still be severe even though she only has one shot?"

13567,It absolutely infuriates me that people keep saying it.
13568,"If we all wore masks, that doesn't mean COVID would have disappeared and we'd be back to normal."
13569,Know where everyone wore masks?
13570,"Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, and France."
13571,All of them had a spike in cases just like America.
13572,"When we decided to move the goalposts from ""keep hospitals from being overwhelmed"" to ""reduce COVID cases until there's never a chance of hospitals being overwhelmed even if the R-value spontaneously quarduples"" we guaranteed that this wouldn't end before a vaccination rollout."

13597,"And while some antibody evasion has been observed, fully vaccinated individuals appear to illicit a robust T cell response against all of the circulating strains."
13598,&gt;We identified a reduction in antibody neutralization against the VOCs which was most evident in the B1.351 variant.

13637,Not even the capitol of Texas wants to lift mask mandate.
13638,Texas is quasi-unique because it‚Äôs one of few states that blocked cities from enforcing their own local mask mandates.
13639,"As you mentioned, Florida has a similar rule, but it also never had a statewide mask mandate."
13640,They are?
13641,I wonder when they come to Sweden then.
13642,"Yes, read the article

&gt;It said the increase in dose  deliveries this month is due to successful expansion of manufacturing  capacities in Europe, which was completed by mid-February."
13643,"&gt;  
&gt;A BioNTech spokeswoman said the  additional doses were a result of an ‚Äúimprovement in efficiency‚Äù, adding  that volumes to be delivered in the second quarter remained unchanged."
13644,"Unhealthy is definitely correct, if they feel the need to make fun of another country's COVID response."
13645,The kids won‚Äôt get vaccinated and were still at risk
13646,"Other countries have anti-maskers, jerks, murderers, terrorists, genocide, rapists, etc."
13647,It‚Äôs unproductive to think this is because of just being American.
13648,If we‚Äôre going to blame something I think we need to blame the tensions and feelings of inadequacy that are brought about by large wealth inequality and being constantly fed images of people living fantasy lives.
13649,That‚Äôs good news.
13650,Thanks for explaining.
13651,It‚Äôs a local source so I thought they were more accurate.
13652,Guess I was wrong.
13653,It wouldn't be surprising if globally the world lost 5 trillion due to covid restrictions.
13654,Their aim was to use it as a treatment not a vaccine or inoculation.
13655,In that sense it failed.
13656,We already had several vaccines being created at the same time hence the need for treatment rather than prevention.
13657,I hope we can put this behind us.. but don‚Äôt want to have false hope today if tomorrow everyone will turn around and say ‚Äúnever mind everyone go back and sit at home again‚Äù
13658,"But without the ability to pit groups of people against each other by deeming those with superior lobbying power more ""worthy"", how will politicians add value?"
13659,And then children need to be covered as well as any potential boosters.
13660,The bottleneck will be vaccinators and support staff
13661,"It‚Äôs measuring statistical cost, rather than estimating true public healthcare cost to treat a covid patient."
13662,Value of a statistical life is the value society places on avoiding a death or infection of covid.
13663,"So it‚Äôs not meant as a measure of direct healthcare cost; rather it‚Äôs a lost opportunity of consumption of goods and services/income, etc.."
13664,Yes the article directly states the mask mandate ends Wednesday.
13665,This is about where the state stands right now.
13666,"You can keep denying it, but UK &amp; US are (one way or another) blocking exports to other countries while EU is supplying a lot of countries, of which some are close neighbors to the US."
13667,Whether or not blocking exports is justified until your own people are vaccinated is while blocking other countries from getting vaccines is another topic.
13668,Every country has a responsibility towards it's own inhabitants in the first place and I think you can defend that providing vaccines for other countries has a lower priority compared to vaccinating your own.
13669,What I thought was quite unbelievable is that the EU got a lot of flak for the resolution that enabled them to block exports and then some more when they actually enforced this export ban.
13670,Especially when you consider that a lot less doses were deliverd compared to what was promised citing production problems but exporting doses outside of the EU at the same time (looking at you AZ).
13671,"Those numbers refer to overall efficacy, and aren't referring to the prevention of severe cases."
13672,"As I stated before, there's no way yet to compare on heart/lung damage specifically."
13673,But all of them have been shown to prevent hospitalization and death at near 100 percent.
13674,J&amp;J is having production issues.
13675,"It is not ""who"" will receive, but ""when"" can they manufacture that many doses."
13676,"If it takes 3 months, the reality is that they (probably) will not be needed anymore in the USA."
13677,"Barring a disaster, by may/june every adult willing to be vaccinated will already be served."
13678,It‚Äôs more.
13679,They get the same as already bought and they get +4million
13680,Yes that and also a lot of people are literally addicted to doom and gloom at this point
13681,82% of that backstop is covered by the people that won't take it anyway.
13682,"Pfizer has yet to fulfill their initial order of 100 million, correct?"
13683,"So if we had bought more Pfizer, we'd have to wait until the original 100 million were delivered and then we'd get the extras?"
13684,He announced the deal to produce more Pfizer vaccines and that won't really get delivered until June which doesn't help the US with the first round of vaccinations.
13685,Don't expect J&amp;J to pull vaccines out of their ass.
13686,What do you mean?
13687,I fully support the EU setting up manufacturing for these vaccines.
13688,I‚Äôm shocked they haven‚Äôt done so.
13689,"Why haven‚Äôt they gone to j&amp;j and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll manufacture 100 million extra doses within the eu that we‚Äôll then use?‚Äù

We NEED more manufacturing of the vaccines."
13690,"Yeah, and it rightfully got flamed because they didn't do the same for any of the other neighborhoods around."
13691,How does it feel to be cheering for a virus?

13702,"There was some possible evidence that people coming out of quarantine in NZ and Australia had tested positive despite 14 days clear, but that could just be that more and more people travelling from the UK were positive in the first place and therefore a couple of outliers got through, and I couldn't find anything one way or another."

13708,Supply will likely be released to other countries during the lag between adult vaccinations and child vaccinations due to the lack of urgency and ability to keep manufacturing.
13709,"There will, however, be a push to vaccinate in the summer due to schools resuming in the fall in the US."
13710,"I'm sure if the US had failed on the vaccine front, there would be scores of people making fun of us there too."
13711,it doesn't tho.
13712,that jump 2 weeks ago was due to the delay in reporting the week before that (winter storm).

13723,And the new BioNTech plant in Marburg delivering first does in April!
13724,Confused about this: everyone is talking about sending remote employees back to work &amp; putting pandemic behind us by the summer when everyone is vaccinated.
13725,But all the studies are showing moderna/Pfizer vaccines which most people have gotten are not effective against the South Africa variant currently spreading in the US (where I am).
13726,Wouldn‚Äôt we all need a third vaccines for it to be safe to open up without a fourth wave?
13727,Or am I missing something?
13728,Feels like all the politicians and corporate employers are ignoring this
13729,Agreed.

&gt;For the record... the overwhelming majority of Uber drivers are driving uber as a second job to earn a bit of extra money

I imagine most of these people have dependents and would qualify for some form of relief regardless of how much over the threshold they were for the main check."
13735,"As a single person living in the DC Area making just under $80k gross (thus getting a reduced check) with no kids, I have never felt that I had to drive Uber to put food on the table or keep the lights on."
13736,If I took an extra it would be to get extra money to invest.
13737,The herd immunity threshold is not number where infections stop completely and once and for all.
13738,"It is the number at which enough people are immune to bring effective reproduction number R below 1, i.e."
13739,"each infected person infects less than one new person, and the epidemic will eventually die out."
13740,But it can take a while to happen and you can end up with more cases than the threshold - known as overshoot.
13741,"So, cases in Israel are coming down, so they could have reached the threshold."
13742,"The threshold as a single number is also simplification, assuming complete mixing of populations."
13743,"In real life, there are different subpopulations with different levels of immunity and different levels of natural R. This seems to be the case in Israel, with young people socializing a lot and getting infected, and older people protected by the vaccine."
13744,Of course.
13745,That‚Äôs the usual US and it‚Äôs fine if the US does it.
13746,"However, what would happen if the EU would do something like that?"
13747,I mean the only reason the US has so many vaccines is because of a vaccine fellows by a GERMAN COMPANY funded by GERMAN TAX MONEY.

13791,I know the trial data had pretty good effectiveness for one shot: but I‚Äôve also heard some saying that since it wasn‚Äôt the end goal for the trial to research that it should be taken with a grain of salt.

13894,"For paywall:

For Sinopharm, China‚Äôs biggest vaccine developer, coronavirus offers a shot at a future that had been out of reach."
13895,The state-backed company is betting that the urgent need to inoculate billions of people across the world will finally allow it to establish its credentials as a global supplier.
13896,"Its first Covid-19 vaccine was approved by Chinese authorities late last year, handing the company the lion‚Äôs share of a national immunisation programme that started in earnest in January."
13897,Its second was approved last month.
13898,"Whether Sinopharm can use this as a springboard to roll the vaccine out beyond its vast domestic market, however, depends on a combustible mix of politics, trust and supply."
13899,"Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow for global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the still-limited supply of vaccines based on the pioneering mRNA technology ‚Äî used in the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna jabs ‚Äî is running in its favour."
13900,"‚ÄúI do think you‚Äôll see many of the other regions of the world that have not secured early doses from more proven players turning to vaccines like the Sinopharm vaccine,‚Äù he said."
13901,"A sprawling company that had revenues of more than Rmb500bn ($77.7bn) last year, Sinopharm‚Äôs operations span the development, sale and distribution of most major medicines, including traditional Chinese treatments."
13902,"Its subsidiary, China National Biotec Group, has developed the vaccines."
13903,"While the country‚Äôs biggest jab maker, CNBG still only accounts for a fraction of Sinopharm's revenues."
13904,"&amp;#x200B;

# A handful of nations  

So far only a handful of nations including the UAE, Bahrain, Pakistan, Egypt, Serbia and Hungary have authorised Sinopharm‚Äôs first vaccine, which the company said had an efficacy rate of 79 per cent in phase 3 trials."
13905,The vaccines are made using a decades-old technique in which a virus is chemically inactivated and then injected into a patient to prime their immune system.
13906,The second uses a slightly different strain of the virus.
13907,"According to Chinese state media, countries had placed orders for at least 140m doses of the two by the middle of January, far shy of the total for the likes of Oxford/AstraZeneca."
13908,"However, if Sinopharm grows its order book substantially, it would vindicate Beijing‚Äôs ambition to develop state-backed companies with globally competitive technology."
13909,The reputation of Yang Xiaoming would also be burnished.
13910,"The chairman of Sinopharm‚Äôs vaccine business since 2015, Yang is one of the public faces of China‚Äôs Covid-19 research."
13911,"A doctor and immunologist, he spent five years in the late 1990s at the US National Institutes of Health and previously led national projects to develop rotavirus and Sars vaccines."
13912,The pandemic offers Sinopharm its best chance in decades to prise open the global market.
13913,The group‚Äôs efforts to do so date back to when Deng Xiaoping was in power.
13914,Sinopharm‚Äôs vaccine business was founded in 1989 to house a string of research institutes dotted across China.
13915,Its international ambitions reached a milestone in 2013 after the World Health Organization approved its jab for Japanese Encephalitis.
13916,"Sinopharm holds a controlling stake in six publicly traded entities ‚Äî two listed in Hong Kong, including Sinopharm Holdings, and four on the Chinese mainland."
13917,"Despite limited uptake so far outside China, Sinopharm has wasted little time in expanding its ability to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccines."
13918,"The company, which employs more than 150,000 people, expects to be able to produce 1bn doses this year, after investing Rmb2bn."
13919,"&amp;#x200B;

# A question of trust  

But for the vaccine to become a serious contender on the international stage, scientists said Sinopharm needs to make a fundamental change: stop relying on Beijing to give its jabs credibility and instead be transparent about the trials and the data they generated."
13920,"‚ÄúIt will be heavy lifting for \[Sinopharm\] to establish its brand and reputation overseas,‚Äù said Jin Dong-Yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong."
13921,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a question of trust, especially as China is starting from nothing, having never before exported vaccines.‚Äù  

Jin said Sinopharm should release an explanation of the efficacy rate while also sharing comprehensive data with international regulators as quickly as possible."
13922,Doing so would mark a radical departure for a company that remains the supplier of choice for China‚Äôs state-subsidised vaccination programmes.
13923,"It is controlled by the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission which sits under the State Council, China‚Äôs cabinet."
13924,"Sinopharm directed requests to comment to the Communist party, which did not respond."
13925,"With governments jostling for a finite supply of vaccines, the race to inoculate billions is a bruising and highly political one."
13926,Beijing has made little secret that Sinopharm‚Äôs jab doubles up as a foreign policy tool.
13927,"In February, Sinopharm‚Äôs deliveries, some donated by Beijing, included 500,000 for Pakistan, 600,000 for Cambodia and 300,000 each for Peru and Laos."
13928,"Late last month, Hungary became the first EU nation to start using the vaccine, with prime minister Viktor Orban declaring it was his preferred choice."
13929,"That Sinopharm has been embraced by the likes of Hungary is stirring concern in Europe for those who see it ‚Äúas a geopolitical contest‚Äù, said Anthony Dworkin, a senior research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations."
13930,"‚ÄúOthers say we‚Äôre short of vaccines and any vaccine that is legitimate we should be interested in.‚Äù  

But with most western nations steering clear of its vaccines, Sinopharm‚Äôs best hope of adding to its list of buyers lies in Asia and Africa."
13931,"&amp;#x200B;

# Covax hope  

The company in January submitted an application for one of its vaccines to be included in the WHO‚Äôs Covax scheme, which aims to ensure populations of low-income countries are inoculated by combining procurement efforts."
13932,"China‚Äôs pledge of 10m jabs to Covax is a fraction of the 2bn doses the initiative, which has struggled to secure support from wealthy nations, hopes to distribute in 2021."
13933,"Covax has signed deals with BioNTech/Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax and Sanofi."
13934,"The bulk of Sinopharm‚Äôs overseas orders have been negotiated directly with countries in the developing world, where its vaccines face intense competition from the likes of Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V and Oxford/AstraZeneca."
13935,"Establishing its vaccines outside China would be a much-needed win for Sinopharm, whose domestic grip is under threat from privately owned competitors."
13936,"The company only makes a quarter of vaccines in the private market, which accounted for 47 per cent of total sales in 2020, up from 23 per cent in 2013, according to the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control."
13937,The same rivals are also eating into Sinopharm‚Äôs lead on a Covid-19 vaccine.
13938,"Last month, Sinovac‚Äôs two-shot vaccine received conditional approval in mainland China and emergency approval in Hong Kong."
13939,CanSino was granted conditional approval in China last month after interim phase 3 results put the efficacy of its jab at just over 65 per cent.
13940,"Like Sinopharm, neither company has released detailed data from their trials."
13941,That absence is no deterrent to some.
13942,"G42 Healthcare, Sinopharm‚Äôs distributor for the Middle East and north Africa, said the Chinese company had a record for developing inactivated vaccines and met requirements for timing and delivery to the UAE."
13943,"Securing overseas orders, however, is merely the start for Sinopharm."
13944,The company needs to produce and deliver the jab ‚Äî a process that has proved fraught for most pharma groups.
13945,"It has been lauded in Pakistan for delivering 500,000 vaccines without charge, but senior government officials told the Financial Times that the number of jabs from Sinopharm actually administered is modest compared with rivals."
13946,"‚ÄúThe bulk of the vaccines I think will come from other sources‚Äù such as Oxford/AstraZeneca and Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V, said one Pakistani official."
13947,"And although Sinopharm has increased its production capacity, and vaccines from Sinovac and CanSino have also been approved, the rollout of its jab at home has lagged behind targets set by Beijing."
13948,"If that persists, achieving its international ambitions is likely to become even harder."
13949,Show me a country that isn't an island or authoritarian that had lockdowns work.
13950,"And I'm not an anti masker, nor am I a republican."
13951,"Well, the flu is pretty much non existent."

13962,"We would have to go to a 6 day work week, with none of the Wed/Fri afternoon off, but it's doable."
13963,Pfizer did specifically say that recipients of their vaccine have maximum immunity 1 week after the second dose.
13964,I guess that's no longer considered true?
13965,Probably.
13966,That seems typical of any country.
13967,But seriously though the slips were better.
13968,They should do both.

13984,"Nope, not at all."
13985,I live here in Orlando and pretty much all businesses require masks.
13986,*infinite jabs
13987,‚ù§Ô∏è my son just turned one and hasn't met most family yet.
13988,"At least there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if that doesn't help right now."
13989,Congratulations.
13990,üòä
13991,Doing it by age doesn‚Äôt make any sense unless the person is severely at risk.
13992,"If all essential workers have been vaccinated, the next group should absolutely be whoever is the biggest spreader of the disease."
13993,That way we are actually optimizing how fast we stop the spread.
13994,Not exactly.
13995,Florida doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe exact same thing‚Äù mainly because it never had a statewide mask mandate.
13996,That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.
13997,They are not approved for children but JnJ is doing a trail for kids under 5 which is the only company I have hear is doing an ‚Äúinfant‚Äù trail.
13998,The one shot and done is ideal for large mass vaccination site in the fall when it‚Äôs time for the children to go back to school.
13999,Aka the school nurse just jabbing all the kids 1st day back.
14000,"Eh, you prioritize people most likely to die."
14001,Simple as that.
14002,You are correct.
14003,I was thinking of adults only.
14004,A lot of them are Boomers.
14005,So could be vaccinated.
14006,Most people that are getting the checks are using it to put food on the table.
14007,What I do with my check is none of your damn business.
14008,Are you donating your check?
14009,No?
14010,Then STFU and stop worrying about why others are getting it.
14011,I can give two shits that people who make more than me are mad that I'm getting a check.
14012,If I wasn't getting a check then I wouldn't be on Reddit crying about how those making $50k are even if I was disappointed.
14013,No one said it‚Äôs another wave just that numbers are higher.
14014,Even that increase in case numbers is based on the low numbers reported when Texas was frozen  solid in immobility a couple of weeks ago.
14015,"Perhaps, but the double entendre works much better with Pfizer."
14016,I feel you... you might already be doing this but n95s are now cheap and plentiful.
14017,Not only online but just this week I‚Äôve seen them in both Walmart and Home Depot.
14018,"And you limies started this mess with Andrew Wakefield, so it's actually a British problem."
14019,"Or is it a uniquely French problem, with them having the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy in the poll I sent you that you probably refused to read?"
14020,We can play jingoist fingerprinting all day here.
14021,"And even if the US helped popularize it, what does it say about the countries that fell for it, exactly?"
14022,We don't have a monopoly on facebook idiots.
14023,By that point they had realized it was primarily airborne and that being outdoors due to the lack of air being recirculated is over 10x less risky.
14024,"i would hope a full dose of any of these vaccines would make collapsing due to covid.... uh, not a thing that happens"
14025,The flu is more dangerous to kids than covid though
14026,I trust more the German industry vaccinating their own employees than GPs doing that.
14027,"Holy moly, that‚Äôs wonderful."
14028,Sounds like their plan worked well.
14029,That‚Äôs great news.
14030,Thank you for explaining.
14031,SA is bigger than Dallas too.
14032,No you don‚Äôt.
14033,"Just because they‚Äôre opening vaccines earlier (given their low population), I doubt you‚Äôd want to actually live there just for that."
14034,lol you are clueless
14035,I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the pessimistic people in my circle are people who haven‚Äôt been keeping up to date on things.
14036,For instance my friend was saying how Virginia won‚Äôt go back to normal until early 2022 because we‚Äôre in the bottom for vaccinations.
14037,We were when the rollout first started but we‚Äôve since been consistently in top 15 or so for the vaccine rollout.
14038,Maybe higher.
14039,However my friend only saw the one bad rollout headline and never moved past that
14040,Won‚Äôt it take at least two weeks to show what effect removing the mask mandate has on numbers?
14041,Saying Texas is having another wave this soon is premature
14042,"&gt;Only because that was a condition of the UK for them, not because of their golden heart."
14043,"They could have just not taken up the deal and tried to develop one for profit, like many other pharmas have attempted (and some succeeded)"

14051,Not to mention the average age of a biker that goes to this type of thing.
14052,It's mostly mid life crisis and up.
14053,A good chunk of them have access to the vaccine now.
14054,That paper says those were accounted for in the UK.
14055,"The op of this thread and I are discussing other nations, which were not accounted for in that study."
14056,"As a houstonian, no we‚Äôre not."
14057,The mayor wants too but cities can‚Äôt legally make those mandates and as far as I know Sylvester has not decided to flaunt that yet.
14058,I‚Äôm guessing Austin is just sticking it to the state and making them fight them over it.
14059,"Good for them, but legally it‚Äôs a losing battle."
14060,"I'd rather he buy too much than pull an EU and order too little, then whine about all of the other ""selfish"" countries."
14061,My school is closing on Friday because over 100 teachers are getting their second dose that day.
14062,Never thought we‚Äôd have this problem.
14063,"Higher Ed students are entirely capable of maintaining distance, wearing a mask properly, and classes are limited to an hour or two, a few times a week."
14064,Elementary and Middle?
14065,Oh lord.
14066,It‚Äôs all day.
14067,"In an hour with smalls, I once counted reminding kids on masks more than 50!!"
14068,times.
14069,Multiply that by seven hours.
14070,"They have no sense of personal space, very little self-awareness, and the attention span of, well, small children."
14071,It‚Äôs a completely different kettle of fish.
14072,75$.....wow...what an incentive...after charging an arm and a leg for tuition.
14073,I am thinking critically and I addressed this above in another comment.
14074,How many 98 year olds do you know can use technology?
14075,I had a hard times navigating my sites sign up system.
14076,There are articles on the concept which i cited.
14077,Hospitalizations did go up for the first time since mid January.
14078,I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something worth worrying about
14079,Thanks!
14080,!
14081,hasn't only 20% of the population gotten the first shot?
14082,I'm getting a full check.
14083,Glad to hear your hypocrisy is alive and well and you have no problem getting a check despite it being to put food on the table.
14084,(That's not what it's ever been about.
14085,I'm not sure that was even a stated mission by the government for the checks.
14086,"We don't need to lie to ourselves about that)

No one in this thread has said anything about a single mother/needy person getting a check."
14087,Not a single person in this thread has had a problem with that.
14088,You created that argument out of thin air.
14089,Everyone in this thread has vocalized support for people directly impacted by the pandemic getting cash.
14090,That is an idea that basically has 100% bipartisan support.
14091,"If anything, people are frustrated that WE (me &amp; you) are getting checks."
14092,"People who had no impact to income, and make well above a living wage."
14093,There isn't really a defendable reason for us to get checks and them NOT to get them.
14094,"Neither party is hurting, but one doesn't get free money because the government drew a random line in the sand"
14095,I gotcha.
14096,Thanks!
14097,"The thing is, the companies that are now exporting are those that are also meeting their schedule."
14098,"As long as they deliver what was promised, no objection from the EU."
14099,If I was the president I would have personally vaccinated the whole country by now.
14100,"Austin is a target for ""elite liberals"" who literally help drive the economy"
14101,Did Florida ever become the worst death toll in the country?
14102,Asking for a friend.
14103,"Don't agree with the sentiment, but reluctant upvote for the excellent pun."
14104,"Well, I just completed Mario Kart on hardest difficulty."
14105,This is like having a designated pee area in the swimming pool.
14106,But what if one person over 50 had to wait an additional week for their vaccine because tech literate young people signed up first?
14107,Think of the boomers!
14108,much better to give out less vaccine instead.
14109,/s
14110,I‚Äôm from this town.
14111,We have exactly TWO outbreaks at nursing homes since the pandemic hit and they were in the very beginning.
14112,The state was called in to help control them .
14113,"To date, we have a little over 3,000 cases total and 83 deaths."
14114,75% of those deaths are from those two previous outbreaks.
14115,We only started vaccinating the second week of January and now it‚Äôs open to anyone getting  it.
14116,What concerns me is that the CDC has given permission for people who have had the shot to go with out masks and gather - even though the vax does not prevent contracting C19 nor stop it from spreading.
14117,I‚Äôm sure we will see much more of this.
14118,The vaccines haven‚Äôt even been delivered yet.
14119,The ink on the contract probably isn‚Äôt even dry yet.
14120,All the vaccines we have received have been used or are already earmarked.
14121,"Dude, chill out."
14122,I don‚Äôt know Austin sucks if you‚Äôre poor too it‚Äôs an expensive ass city compared the rest of Texas.
14123,I think we‚Äôre close.
14124,MN just opened two other phases yesterday.
14125,Governor Walz thinks mid-late April is when the general public will be able to get it here.
14126,What part of the message do you think is mixed here?
14127,The anti- vaccine movement is worst in America amongst developed nations.
14128,It is a predominantly American problem that has been exported from America around the world.
14129,Isn‚Äôt he anti mask?
14130,I actually was awoken about 1:30am last night to an extremely sore body and just felt cold and super icky.
14131,It was really hard to sleep because of the aching.
14132,"This morning, I still feel fatigued."
14133,Especially in my joints for some reason.
14134,It's hard to make the argument that those differences weren't controlled for if you read [the paper itself](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579).
14135,"That's fair, I suppose."
14136,"I generally err on the side of pessimism and caution, but I think I'm just fatigued and exhausted at this point at being in a constant state of doom and gloom."
14137,But I suppose I could understand why other people are preparing for the worst.
14138,"Up until now, preparing for the worst has (unfortunately) turned out to be the correct mindset to have because this past year has been the worst we could have imagined and then some."
14139,:(
14140,We don‚Äôt know how many people will ultimately turn down the vaccine.
14141,I do not trust the media hype on this subject.
14142,And we have already seen surveys showing a decreasing trend in folks who claim they won‚Äôt get vaccinated.
14143,[removed]
14144,"I still disagree that one Covid case has $48,800 in costs associated with it, but even so, the article tag says it's public healthcare costs."
14145,"You may very well be correct that the data is based on the total accumulated cost of a case, but the article (I believe purposefully) is meant to give the impression that the $12.2 billion is solely public health costs."
14146,What state?
14147,I've been active on the Ohio Covid group here on reddit and have heard this same story from many people... at least two of which I was able to find appointments for within 30 seconds of finding out their approximate location.
14148,"I totally get that 81 year old granny may be waiting for a call from her doctor, but their younger and (clearly) tech savvy grandkids need to start getting a little proactive."
14149,"Between my wife and I, we have been able to get every single eligible person we know scheduled."
14150,"Took quite a bit of hustle, but we made it happen."
14151,"Good, The more (and sooner), the merrier."
14152,Absolutely.
14153,This is kind of like trying to get accurate statistics on homelessness or illegal drug use.
14154,"They're all populations that tend to be more ""underground"" and difficult to accurately measure."
14155,"This is welcome news but 4mil as much as it is a huge amount, the population of the EU is massive."
14156,"Those extra doses are being produced by BionTech not Pfizer

14157,[removed]
14158,I don't know if we're swimming in doses (at least in the US).
14159,"If 70% of adults want the vaccine, we have about 118m adults that want the vaccine but haven't initiated vaccination yet."
14160,"We're getting about 16m combined doses between Pfizer and Moderna each week, but important to note a good portion of those are for second doses."
14161,And J&amp;J hasn't really stepped up production *yet*.
14162,So realistically we're doing something like 12m first doses each week for at least the next couple weeks.
14163,"If we go free-for-all now, we're looking at ~10 people vying for each first dose."
14164,"If we can limit to more vulnerable populations, we can probably cut that competition in half, lowering frustration for people trying to get appointments and focusing efforts to people who will have worse outcomes."
14165,"Whether that can be efficiently done is up for debate for sure, and given how age is a big predictor of outcome I like the idea of making the rollout more age dependent to simplify things, but not sure about opening it up to *everyone* at this point."
14166,My argument isn‚Äôt that he shouldn‚Äôt be wishy washy.
14167,that‚Äôs his personal choice.
14168,"However it was published publicly and for a demographic that is already very skeptical of vaccines to see one of the most famous black people say he doesn‚Äôt know he will take take it, it could just add fuel to the fire"

14174,At the rate my state is vaccinating people I'm sure they will be needed.
14175,I was placed at the back of the line and my state has no prediction of when I'll be allowed to get vaccinated.
14176,My family and friends that are essential workers or with medical conditions that are currently eligible are having no luck finding appointments to get it.
14177,Missouri is messed up.
14178,That's fine with me.
14179,I'll take whatever one I can get at this point.
14180,Does it protect well against covid related hospitalization and death?
14181,Then good enough for me.
14182,"Yes she did, but I'm just saying, they are already manufacturing in Europe and they are expanding to Sanofi and other manufacturers + new plants in Poland, but it's just all very slow and late."
14183,Dude calm down.
14184,It‚Äôs not relevant to my comment.
14185,I‚Äôve said nothing about bodies piling up.
14186,I didn‚Äôt even say anything negative.
14187,I support opening things up more.
14188,I‚Äôve made that point clear many times before.
14189,"Mate, you need to go chill somewhere."
14190,Yeah.
14191,"I'm in Texas, and my boss is of the opinion that we could have beaten this thing if we had kept masks and restrictions in place for 'just another 2 months'."
14192,"But now that we haven't, we are going to still be dealing with this in August later this year."
14193,"I can't tell if some people are really that pessimistic, or deep down they want this to continue?"
14194,My Dad also seems to be in a similar boat.
14195,"I know my Dad well enough to where I don't think he wants this to continue, but I think he's been so much of a shut in, that he's genuinely scared to go out back to normalcy and is coming up with reasons why the rest of probably can't."
14196,"He got his second dose a couple weeks ago, and still thinks he won't be comfortable going to restaurants in July."
14197,I'm hoping as more people get vaccinated and numbers continue to show a positive trend that these people will change their tune in a month or so.
14198,"By May, I just can't imagine why anyone would still be pessimistic about the situation in the US."
14199,Currently lying in bed recovering from second Moderna shot‚Äîgot it last night and holy fuck these side effects are kicking my ass.
14200,"But I‚Äôm done now, and this just reminds me how much worse it could be to actually have Covid."
14201,[deleted]
14202,Yes for sure.
14203,Typical.
14204,Just like they underpay people in in-demand jobs and then get confused when they lag behind in those industries.
14205,I‚Äôve just been using Bloomberg‚Äôs tracker.
14206,They include the % used of all doses provided to the state.
14207,And compared to other states GA is really sucking.
14208,I‚Äôm hoping with their mass vaccination sites opening that it can start to ramp up
14209,**It will be close to 30% in 4 weeks** after those that have already received a single dose get their second shot.
14210,It's not 4 million doses.
14211,"It's 4 million doses this month alone, which is also an indicator, that they might be able to overproduce in the following months."
14212,"In any case, having 4 million doses is better than not having them."
14213,once Alaska is finished their supplies can go elsewhere.
14214,that'll be nice
14215,The US also has a less susceptible population considering we've had at least 2x the number of infections over the course of the pandemic.
14216,I don't know what's so hard to understand.
14217,Most of the new cases are young people who haven't been vaccinated.
14218,Well it's better than the term I've been using.
14219,"""let's get to Stabbin"""
14220,Seems Brazil is doing/going for what all my Covid denying right wing social contacts wanted us to do from the get go to ‚Äúsolve this thing by just getting it over and giving people access to the cures (whatever cocktails they are promoting this month).
14221,Yet their curve is a blob and they seem to have a way bigger hole to climb out of.

14227,You ever seen a 50 year alcoholic and chain smoker still kickin at 75?
14228,The body does pretty incredible things to keep yourself alive.
14229,What trolling?
14230,Republicans usually leave govt and Americans in worst shape than when they started.
14231,It‚Äôs accurate.
14232,What is this?
14233,You know.
14234,I think you may be on to something.
14235,I've been pondering this as well.
14236,"In the aggregate, I wonder if we'd be curbing the spread faster if we targeted those who are most likely to SPREAD covid first, rather than those at greatest risk."
14237,Presumably those at greatest risk are much more motivated to self-isolate and mask up at all times.
14238,"I don't know the answer, but it is an interesting thought experiment."
14239,I haven't heard anything about houston maintaining a mask order.
14240,Do you have a link to a source on this?
14241,I did a cursory search and didn't see anything about it.
14242,Hidalgo tried way back in the beginning and was shot down by abbott.

14247,"HIV, in the absence of medication, kills almost everyone who contracts it within about three years."
14248,You should delete.

14251,"But until then, they need to stop declaring everything as Long covid."
14252,"The covid subs here are filled with posts that are like, ‚ÄúI coughed in November 2019 and now I have anxiety, so clearly I‚Äôm suffering from Long covid!‚Äù

14285,Been following the CDC tracker and it seems pretty flat: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Moderna-Allocations/ke78-phpe.
14286,Don't they have to aggressively increase production to meet their timelines?
14287,Booked a trip to Italy for July as an American back in December when vaccine rollout began.
14288,"Fuck it, everything is refundable"
14289,I'll be honest.
14290,"I don't care about death, but I care about infection."
14291,"If a vaccine doesn't protect us from infection, then it's not good enough."
14292,The reduction is death will not bring life back to normal as long as people insist on tracking positive case numbers.
14293,"In reality, if people are vaccinated, then the number of positive cases can still continue to rise, but people just won't be dying."
14294,I want a vaccine that brings things life back to normal.

14299,"&gt; BRUSSELS ‚Äî The European Union exported 25 million doses of vaccines produced in its territory last month to 31 countries around the world, with Britain and Canada the top destinations, just as the bloc saw its own supply cut drastically by pharmaceutical companies, slowing down vaccination efforts and stoking a political crisis at home."
14300,25 million shots exported in a single month is a lot.
14301,"&gt;And while the United States kept doses for itself, the E.U."
14302,"shipped 651,000 vaccines to the United States last month and made vaccines that immunized its neighbors: The second-largest recipient of E.U.-made vaccines was Canada, which received more than three million doses last month, while the fourth-largest was Mexico, receiving nearly 2.5 million vaccine doses produced in the bloc."

14312,My conservative mother just spewed out all this nonsense on how bad the mRNA is vs J&amp;J. I don‚Äôt know my information or did any research but it our decision to get vaccinated(Mid January-Pfizer) was we get the risks of the Vaccine our weight the risks of getting COVID and there complications
14313,You're not wrong of course.

14502,"For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized."

14509,"In the [Pfizer trial](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download), for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group‚Äî**which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent."

14551,"Some of the trials didn't have many or even any people in the **PLACEBO** groups die or end up in the hospital, so it's not really significant data that they didn't when getting the vaccine either."
14552,I try to give the best summary on all the studies I read.
14553,I can stop though.
14554,Its like 85-90% at ~14 days.
14555,The 50% is the total between day 0 and day 21.
14556,For the first 14 days people who got the shot and did not get it got covid at pretty much the same rate.
14557,Be civil.
14558,"Let's see, husbands are working from home, adult kids moved back in...yep"
14559,This gym doesn‚Äôt require it.
14560,But I am going to still wear it for a month until a few more people are vaccinated.
14561,&gt; I think it's like 14 percent.
14562,Per WaPo vaccine tracker its like 50% of the prioritized (65+) population.
14563,"Kids can't get vaccinated for now, so they don't count, and hospitalizations are highest with old people, who are close to being mostly vaccinated."
14564,Semantics are important.
14565,The EU are claiming there is an export ban and that is an outright lie.
14566,Sure the UK isn‚Äôt currently exporting but that‚Äôs due to contractual arrangements and the fact that the only reason there is any production facilities in the UK is due to government funding.
14567,It still does not equate to a ban.
14568,"The USA has a ban on exports, the EU has the ability to block them but the UK has introduced no such measures."
14569,The UK has no similar measures in place and the moment AZ meets its contractual obligations to the UK it can export without the Uk govt doing anything.
14570,You can claim it‚Äôs just semantics all you like but you and the EU are the ones twisting the facts to fit your perceived view of it.
14571,[removed]
14572,Be civil.
14573,"I‚Äôm imagining how crowded it‚Äôll be, and it‚Äôll be awesome."
14574,"That's so odd, why wouldn't they do higher ed teachers at the same time?"
14575,They interact with the same number of people...
14576,And you think they don‚Äôt?
14577,"Actually, millions of younger people have received the vaccine."
14578,I'm 34 and just received my first shot yesterday.
14579,I watch my special needs nephew quite often and told my primary I'd like to get a shot.
14580,"Since our availability of vaccine in WI keeps growing, I was scheduled for yesterday."
14581,I'm spreading study information.
14582,"[DHS study summary](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/st-master-question-list-covid-19), page 13 (=PDF page 15):

&gt; Environmental Stability ‚Äì How long does the agent live in the environment?"
14583,"&gt; SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity."
14584,Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans.
14585,"&gt; In the absence of sunlight, SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks."
14586,"If that was the agreement, what's the problem?"
14587,"&gt; OP mostly posts on Serbia

Yeah."
14588,I live in here.
14589,That's why I'm posting on /r/serbia.
14590,&gt; so is picking data to suit their agenda.
14591,"So, living in Serbia now means you have an agenda?"
14592,"What if I was from Israel, posting in /r/Israel sub?"
14593,Would you think I still have an agenda?
14594,Do not spread misinformation.
14595,At some point governors are going to have to let life and the economy normalize.
14596,Fauci‚Äôs training is in strict virus mitigation.
14597,Hence why he doesn‚Äôt actually make the decisions.
14598,Not everything is covid.
14599,"No, as in that's not acceptable at all."
14600,"If that's true, then what was the point of the vaccine?"
14601,Fortunately all research indicates that vaccines DO significantly reduce transmission.
14602,"Once I'm fully vaccinated, every mask I own goes in the garbage can."
14603,"Cool, now imagine the greedy ass companies can actually deliver the promised amounts they signed contracts for."
14604,I so badly want to punch that guy in the face.
14605,Didn't they withdraw their sponsorship from Sturgis last year?
14606,Wear it if the gym requires it but if there's no requirement in the gym I'd say you're good to unmask
14607,All the vaccines are great except the Oxford one which is a dud
14608,"Americans, kicking goals!"
14609,So I have a question on Pfizer/Moderna efficacy based on days.
14610,"From what I could tell, efficacy 14 days after the first shot was about 50%, and the more time it passes, the higher it goes (especially true after the second shot)."
14611,"However, let's just take the first 14 days."
14612,Is efficacy something like this?
14613,"|Day Post Shot|Efficacy|
:--|:--|
|0-13|0%|
|14|50%|

Or is it something like this?"
14614,"|Day Post Shot|Efficacy|
:--|:--|
|0-2|0%|
|2-4|0%|
|4-6|7%|
|6-8|14%|
|8-10|21%|
|10-12|28%|
|12-14|35%|
|14+|50%|"
14615,That's not the point at all.
14616,The question at hand is whether immunized individuals who aren't sick can transmit the virus.
14617,Your comments suggest it's possible which is false.
14618,Vaccinated people can get sick and they can spread it when sick.
14619,No edited titles.
14620,Also unexpected pdf.
14621,This isn‚Äôt proven.
14622,One time I tried one of my dogs jerky treats and it was surprisingly good
14623,if you‚Äôre inside there are a lot of factors like how big the space is and how good the ventilation and filtration is.
14624,You can breath out virus particles or sneeze or cough.
14625,So those particles can float around further than 6 feet and also stay in the air for awhile.
14626,With 6 feet it‚Äôs more likely to disperse and maybe fall to the ground or on another surface.
14627,But it‚Äôs not guaranteed.
14628,Outside it‚Äôs likely to disperse fairly quickly hence being safer outside.
14629,I won‚Äôt be dining inside until far more people are vaccinated  including myself.
14630,I just order out or eat at places with outside seating.
14631,"I‚Äôve heard jab before, but it always sounded British to me (I‚Äôm American fwiw)."
14632,"Not sure if that‚Äôs true, though."
14633,"Somebody else mentioned ‚Äúshots in arms‚Äù and I think that just sort of took off from people yelling it online when the rollout was slow early on.... ‚ÄúWE NEED SHOTS IN ARMS!‚Äù

Although I have heard shot in the arm in the context of giving someone a jolt or reinvigoration, so I suppose it‚Äôs not a brand new saying, just sort of exploded on Reddit and Twitter."
14634,You do realize that Bibi does not get to decide that?
14635,"Bibi is in coalition with B&amp;W (Ganz), his political opponent, and both have to sign up on a lockdown for it to happen."
14636,Not to mention that every lockdown has been driven by healthcare officials s first.
14637,"I do realize that there's a lot of disinformation on the subject, but still."
14638,What do you mean no?
14639,"Even vaccinated you can still spread things like covid, unless you're just denying masks like a twat"
14640,"Women have felt more anxious, depressed and lonely than men during the first year of the pandemic, according to Office for National Statistics data."
14641,"Women spent more time on unpaid childcare and housework over the past year then men, and were more likely to be furloughed."
14642,More men than women have died with Covid-19 in England and Wales.
14643,But men were more likely to be unconcerned by the effects of coronavirus on their lives.
14644,"When asked how anxious they felt, women's anxiety levels have been much higher than men's since March 2020, something also seen before the pandemic."
14645,"During the first peak, loneliness was the biggest cause of anxiety - and women were more likely than men to feel lonely."
14646,"&gt;""The purpose of this $75 grant is to encourage UC Davis students not to travel during spring break and provide them with alternative activities to do during the week,"" Ms Blouin told the broadcaster."
14647,"Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement on Thursday that ‚Äúspring travel can lead to another surge that frankly would be almost impossible to tolerate.‚Äù However last year, Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order allowing bars and restaurants the right to remain open at least 50 per cent capacity and preventing authorities from fining people not wearing face masks."
14648,"When you get to the end of that article/study it basically says ‚Äúyeah, we can‚Äôt prove it."
14649,"We‚Äôre guessing‚Äù
It‚Äôs amazing how we can‚Äôt figure out if a medicine works inside of 6 months but when it comes to propping up a narrative somehow we have multiple studies ready to go with a week."
14650,So
14651,It is assault and battery and she admitted to it.
14652,"&gt; But if you are vaccinated, let's get back at er."
14653,How would I be vaccinated?
14654,It's 1A and 1B groups only right now.

14669,And it‚Äôs great that J&amp;J is now available in these cases But stop criticizing people who want a vaccine that -on the individual level -is more effective at preventing you from getting sick and serving as a COVID vector.
14670,I don't think you're understanding.
14671,We're not giving the vaccine to not-old people yet and that's who I'm talking about.

14680,"Graduated from UT, class of 99."
14681,Austin has its points.
14682,"You hear about the liberal attitude, great food, great music scene, the bars, college town atmosphere in a big city."
14683,But frankly it's overrated.
14684,"Urban sprawl, bad (no, awful) traffic, high rent, low income families were forced out of the central part of the city long ago, especially east of I35, which is rapidly gentrifying."
14685,"One of my favorite hole-in-the-wall Tex-Mex places, which was basically a converted house turned restaurant, is long gone, replaced by condos."
14686,Plus it has one of the worst homeless problems in the country.
14687,Every time I go back the above problems are worse and worse.
14688,Austin is not quite the liberal utopia people make it out to be.
14689,Makes sense to keep these a bit longer in large cities.
14690,"I do like that we're leaving it up to local governments to decide, though."
14691,Some tiny town in Texas doesn't need the same restrictions as Austin or Houston.
14692,My fiance and I had our second on the same day.
14693,"She had nothing, I had a 102 degree fever, chills, aches and pains, headache, and diharea."
14694,"100% fine 24 hours later, it was crazy."
14695,25 million doses exported in February is almost as much as the EU received for themselves that month (about 28 million).
14696,It seems the contagious period is about 10-14 days
14697,And I don't think you are understanding.
14698,"If you have a vaccine, hospitalizations are almost eradicated."
14699,Therefore no organ failure.
14700,Go get vaccinated and the majority of this discussion / argument goes away.
14701,The consumer distribution channels seem to be getting vaccines out better than my health care providers.
14702,Biontech are already working with Sanofi in Germany to set up a new site that will open in Q3
14703,Maybe Austin will one day secede from Texas...
14704,"If you don't already have packed hospitals, packed ICUs, and lots of virus still going around, that approach makes sense."
14705,"But if you do, you need to prioritize the demographic that's stressing the medical system."
14706,This is absurd; the US and UK do not allow doses produced in their territory to leave the country.
14707,"&gt;10% of US population has received both shots

Good job!"
14708,"I'm also collecting COVID mementos such as little slips of paper with  codes to retrieve test results, pattern for homemade mask, info  sheet about vaccine side effects."
14709,I'm neither a retail worker or a teacher so I'll be one of the last to get the vaccine.
14710,"My wife is a teacher and she hasn't seen a clinic, more of a black Friday style rush to try and schedule her own vaccine through CVS, and that's in Massachusetts"
14711,"Well they can't use the US facilities, because the US is blocking exports."
14712,I'm glad we're not doing the same in the EU.
14713,Hopefully this will help Pfizer (and others) decide where they want to plan future production capacity in order to be able to meet global demand.
14714,"Yes, I do know that."
14715,At a much lower percentage rate.
14716,I'm assuming you don't drive a car because there is chance you will die right???
14717,I was all for staying at home and canceling school.
14718,Now that we have the vaccines.
14719,Everything has changed.
14720,There is no good reason not to start open up and beginning our lives again.
14721,If you are at risk then stay home.
14722,"But if you are vaccinated, let's get back at er."
14723,You need to post the actual title.
14724,The risk of having too hospitals that were overflowing was why we shut down last year.
14725,Look at the percentage of hospitalization by age.
14726,"It's a lot higher for the elderly, who have been/are being vaccinated."
14727,"No, the pandemic's not over and those younger can still get sick or pass away."
14728,But getting the most at risk vaccinated means we can start to move away from restrictions.

14730,"I posted this in another comment, but is there any way to see the J&amp;J efficacy data just for South Africa?"
14731,The data from Israel and the UK (with literally millions of participants) show that the mRNA vaccines are much more effective than J&amp;J for the UK variant.
14732,"So the question becomes, how much of J&amp;Js poor results are from South Africa?"
14733,And how much is because it‚Äôs just a less effective vaccine overall?
14734,A world where you clearly lack reading comprehension skills.
14735,I never said 80k was considered rich.
14736,No one uses that expression in real life anyway.
14737,Seems to be more prevalent among Fauci and the media.
14738,&gt; Why is UK broken out in your highly editorialised title?
14739,Clearly UK is following a different strategy of splitting doses so is not meeting your 'fully' but is doing very nicely thank you.
14740,"I just wanted to highlight differences in that strategies with concrete numbers, because criteria of ""fully vaccinated"" is not something that is product of ""my agenda"" (btw really?"
14741,why so paranoid?).
14742,It's medical term and we will see how Britain's strategy will work out compared to all other countries with high rate of fully vaccinated population.
14743,"Also it should be mentioned that Israel and US used 2 doses of Pfizer, while UAE and Serbia rolled out mostly 2 doses of Sinopharm vaccines to their population."
14744,"&gt; For those interested in non agenda based data, the doses per 100 pop is available on the same site."
14745,"This is not agenda based data, it's *just* data of different public information, same as data for doses per 100 pop."
14746,Czechia here.
14747,"We have almost the same number of daily cases (15196 yesterday), even though we only have a fourth of the population."
14748,Crazy.
14749,British variant hit us like a freight train.
14750,I had mild Covid through Christmas and I am not sure if my natural protection works against this new variant.
14751,I dodge people in the street as if they were walking landmines.
14752,Dude I‚Äôm 22 and got my first dose almost 4 weeks ago stop being weird and just go loiter around your local pharmacy
14753,"I've registered with the state, Walgreens and Rite Aid and I keep checking CVS and would go tomorrow if I could get the Covid vaccine - any one."
14754,"However, in my state (NJ) only people who are over 65 and/or have comorbidities, and/or work in certain front-line professions are eligible to get the vaccine at this point."
14755,What world are you living in where 80k a year is rich?
14756,Call your local government office and ask if you can volunteer.
14757,You never know.
14758,In NY we are short on volunteers at some of the more rural/out of the way locations on weekdays (M-F).
14759,Young people still die of covid you know.
14760,More worryingly we have no idea if there is long term organ damage done by just having gotten the disease.
14761,People could lose 10 years off their lives just by having a major organ weakened so it can give out in 30 or 40 years time.
14762,I don't know if we would have noticed that by now.
14763,Right.
14764,"But in major cities, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward to set up distribution of the mRNA vaccine."
14765,We're already seeing it.
14766,We started seeing it in early January.
14767,The case rate started dropping like crazy then and only a tiny fraction of the population was vaccinated.
14768,My mom has had her vaccine for months now (first responder) and she is volunteering.
14769,She obviously didn't get her shot from volunteering.
14770,What she does get is the ability to make phone calls to anyone close enough to run down in the last half hour they're open to use up any vaccines left over from people who didn't show up for their appointment.

14775,*
14776,It‚Äôs stupid that people need to still advocate for it.
14777,I know a really big dude (gout as well) that won‚Äôt take the vaccine (I‚Äôm trying).
14778,I told him that if he tests positive before waiting to see how his symptoms he needs to start calling and demanding monoclonal antibodies because of his huge risk factors.
14779,"I know 2 people who were sent home, symptoms increased and they were hospitalized and told it‚Äôs too late."
14780,At this point if you are over 65 or obese and you test positive they should just send you to get them.
14781,It would cut down severe outcomes in so many cases.
14782,I mean that's fine because it still has a higher likelihood of preventing death and hospitalization.
14783,"By the time that we're around the fall of this year, they're more than likely going to have the booster for this and it will only be one shot."
14784,Congrats!
14785,I got mine Monday.
14786,It felt great to finally take a step forward.
14787,WrongüòÇ
14788,The lack of nurses is definitely a problem.
14789,"We lost a lot of healthcare workers to Covid, and the ones who are still alive are working 70 hours a week keeping the hospitals running."
14790,Finding people who know how to administer vaccines and have enough free time to work the clinics is a challenge.
14791,"Source: My mom is an RN who works an office job at a hospital, and worked a lot of Covid clinics."
14792,Real Neanderthal hours
14793,They have the same effectiveness.
14794,The studies done were not powerful enough to establish one as clearly more effective than the other.
14795,The difference between the two was within the studies' margin of error.
14796,"My concern is that ""serious disease"" is vastly underestimated if only hospitalized cases counted."
14797,Cases outside of hospital are not trivial.
14798,Chronic disease is real and I look after them.
14799,"And here in Canada they've decided to push the second shot to 4 months at the earliest, likely compromising vaccine effect even further."
14800,We cant just look at the next 3 months and think it's over.
14801,I'm worried behaviours will relax prematurely unless our experts have a longer view.
14802,I have a major heart condition.
14803,"If I get COVID, I am at a high risk of dying."
14804,"That article atributes long COVID to an aggressive immune response, which any vaccine would mitigate"
14805,if we cant get $15 minimum wage then at least we can get a free vaccine for our toils
14806,So basically precisely how Gov Abbott prescribed from the beginning - that the state wouldn‚Äôt be the one to mandate it but wouldn‚Äôt prevent others from choosing to do so.
14807,Did Adler announce this from a resort beach in Mexico while sipping margaritas?
14808,No better than Cruz.

14810,Alaska is vaccinating everyone now.
14811,They're obsessed with us.
14812,It's really bizarre.
14813,It feels very similar to having a stalker ex.
14814,"CDC said yesterday if you get the shot you don't need a mask when visiting others at home, and you don't need to social distance in this case."
14815,I really wish they wouldn't say shit like this when there's zero evidence that a vaccinated person is no longer able to spread to others.
14816,"Could be another wave situation with all the kids going back to school, many states no longer requiring masks, businesses opening at full capacity, and people thinking they're invincible because they got the shot."
14817,Wouldn't be surprised if all that's included in the exhibit.
14818,Using COVID as a cover?
14819,"Based on their behavior lately, definitely wouldn't put it past them."

14865,Now it's entirely possible that this was a non covid virus in December which triggered the Diabetes however it is also since been suggested that covid cases could have been seen as early as this and data suggesting a link between covid and diabetes onset.
14866,"At the end of the day it wouldn't change much either way, she would still be diabetic and she just got her 1st vaccine dose yeaterday (which she has reacted to with slight fever, slightly more likely if you have already been exposed but again not proof) but it would be interesting to know or be able to find out."

15104,"In comparison, Missouri is right at 16% too (bit higher I think) with a much higher population."
15105,"Since vaccine numbers are by population, this is pretty good especially given we are all pretty spread out."
15106,"As for the lack of moving through tiers, I know some areas are ready to go, and it's a tough decision but I understand why they don't want certain areas to move forward."

The staff at places like this is getting burned out 

We need to get all the pharmacies and other avenues for vaccination running and get more manpower harnessed"
15132,What happens in Texas is the state does something stupid and Austin opts out.
15133,That upsets Master Abbott quite a bit so he calls an emergency session of Congress to pass a law forbidding Austin from opting out.
15134,"Similarly, Austin will pass a law that makes sense sometimes."
15135,Master Abbott will again call an emergency session and pass a law to make the state law the exact opposite.

15143,And I‚Äôm as rules following as anyone can be.
15144,And I‚Äôm still waiting my turn.
15145,But my state prioritized teachers over everyone.

15148,"And even though as a 39 year old with three serious health conditions including damaged lungs, I am not up for a vaccine."
15149,And I have to watch 22 year old phys Ed teachers get mass vaccinations because our governor owes the teacher union.

15156,It‚Äôs only natural for deaths to be falling as well.
15157,"Only concerning thing is, cases almost hit 100k in a single day despite being roughly around 60-70k for a weekly average for a little bit."
15158,"If cases start going up again, expect deaths to follow afterwards"
15159,"Wouldn't this mean that tests and cases are reported independently from one another, so we never know the actual test positivity rate for a given day?"
15160,"Hey, can you explain why you think lifting the mandate is preventing sickness and death?"
15161,I'm extremely curious to understand your take on this controversial topic.
15162,"Given that less than 10% of people in Texas are vaccinated and a majority of the rest seem to think this is a hoax, lifting the mandate against the recommendations of professionals seems unlikely to be preventative."

15186,While people are getting vaccinated the stock markets have been booming keeping the top happy.

15297,They also haven't provided any additional J&amp;J allocations for next week.
15298,It's possible that many additional doses are being sent out through other programs?
15299,"CVS conducted this pop-up clinic, but they explicitly said a second dose would not be through them."

15323,80% of deaths are protected having vaccinated the right 20% of the people.
15324,By April 1st covid resembles a heavy flu that is geared towards the younger.
15325,By June 1st it resembles a cold.
15326,They could before the order though so that part of the order is all but meaningless.

15335,"No, I'm in the group that socially distanced and stayed indoors for the past year until both my wife and I received our vaccines."
15336,Are we going to start having to tweaking the formula for vaccine allocation depending on the differences in vaccine hesitancy between states?
15337,"Because some states it is damn near impossible to find an appointment for eligible seniors, while other states are opening up eligibility to 18 year olds."
15338,Fuck those people.
15339,"People are always gonna complain, we‚Äôve gotta do what makes the most sense."

15345,Absolute values aren‚Äôt that useful unless you adjust for population
15346,This might give a rough idea of when states will be open up to everyone.
15347,"Alaska is 25%, most states are slightly beloiw 20%."

15443,Just in time for all the spring breakers.... oh wait .... ummmmm
15444,Thank you for re-posting this.
15445,"You just made my day (week, month, year!!!!!)"
15446,The play is to scare people into distancing to avoid another lockdown
15447,There was some doubt pushed by a relatively small faction who talked about variants as if they were poised to be evasive to the vaccines.
15448,"This is back a few weeks ago ofcourse, when variants were more of a ""Mystery X-Factor"" type of thing."
15449,100% on board with getting whichever vaccine I‚Äôm offered in my area.
15450,I will get the first one they offer.
15451,"But let me explain why I don‚Äôt like this narrative, even though I subscribe to it."
15452,What is really happening with this messaging is that the government is trying to get as many of us as possible to a place where we won‚Äôt need hospital care or result in a death.
15453,Fine.
15454,Makes a ton of practical sense.
15455,But they are intentionally omitting the hard fact that J&amp;J is an inferior product.
15456,It just is.
15457,No debate.
15458,So my problem is watching them try to blow smoke up my ass again.
15459,"I‚Äôll happily take the inferior product to contribute to the greater goal, but don‚Äôt fucking sit there and adamantly insist that I‚Äôm not receiving a lesser vaccine."
15460,Because I am.
15461,The vaccine is not only given to black people.
15462,The comparison doesn't even make sense.
15463,The vaccine is being given to everyone all around the world.
15464,"Current COVID Cases:

‚Ä¢ California: 3.6m
‚Ä¢ Texas: 2.7m
‚Ä¢ Florida: 1.95m
‚Ä¢ New York: 1.7m"
15465,"It's important to note here that vaccine escape could still happen, which is why it's unspeakably dumb to do what Texas is doing and try to ride the knife edge of disaster."
15466,Well I'm excited to see how all that plays out.
15467,Coo coo coo
15468,"too bad texas is so gerrymandered, austin is part of the [10th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas%27s_10th_congressional_district) district and isn't represented by anyone on its own right, in fact it's all so split it up that it's technically 'republican' even if the city isn't"
15469,"&gt; I can't stay up to midnight to book

If one is having to stay up to midnight to book, then expanding eligibility ain't gonna do shit for increasing the number of vaccinations."
15470,People with weak chins/ugly teeth love masks too.
15471,welcome to the good side
15472,"No can do, we're busy spending $135m on the National Endowment for the Arts, $135m on the National Endowment for the Humanities, and $200m on the Institute of Museum and Library Services, all in the Covid relief bill."
15473,Just can't find the $210m required for tests anywhere.
15474,Big shocker
15475,Austin's reputation for being liberal really is an exaggeration.
15476,It's liberal in the sense that Democrats and Republicans both represent liberalism as a political ideology.
15477,Austin votes blue for the same reason as any urban area; it's where you find the more education population.
15478,"It has some progressive social attitudes, but because it lacks progressive economic attitudes, it doesn't really amount to much more than an aesthetic."
15479,"Right, to that point there‚Äôs not a single place that should be throwing stones."
15480,You got that source?
15481,Being Canadian and reading this makes me want to cry.
15482,"I‚Äôm not angry at or jealous of Americans to the point where it makes me bitter, but I have a lot of family down there I haven‚Äôt seen in now almost two years and my mental health is in a steep decline, I would do anything to be able to live life normally again and it makes me tear up and get emotional just thinking about being able to feel normal and not scared and not shitty."
15483,"I can't disagree with FDA's application of the EUA, I'm not an expert."
15484,I have to trust their judgement.
15485,"But as long as the vaccine is not approved, I would like my doctor to explain to me why it's not approved, what tests are missing, and to let me know that the missing data has no bearing on my health conditions."
15486,"Really amazed with China pulling off 3 successful vaccines with this, Sinopharm's, and Cansino's."
15487,The whole sub is full of farm animals.
15488,I don't see any human beings with an ounce of objectivity or critical thinking.
15489,Please go and get whatever vaccine you can get your hands on and do the gene pool a favour
15490,It is crazy to think that someone will be the last person to die from covid.

15507,I stand corrected.
15508,Apparently they are prepared for a court case.
15509,I have no idea if the governor has the power to override them but they can't both be right.
15510,I hear ya.
15511,The original question was does AZ work for over 65 year olds...and that answer appears to be a very confident yes.
15512,I don‚Äôt know why the person then needed to throw in....and it‚Äôs performing better than Pfizer.
15513,"That is pushing the boundaries of a single study, beyond the limits of intent from study (and under the usage of Pfizer...ie one shot...that most countries are not even following)."
15514,This is pretty much what I expected.
15515,Hogan will likely lift the mask mandate in May by my estimate.

15517,"Sorry, no."
15518,The standard isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwell you won‚Äôt die!‚Äù given the fact that even mild/asymptomatic patients have shown lasting lung damage.

15529,"I think once the second wave towards the end of the year really started to get bad, I realized the only way out of this was a vaccine."
15530,I'm so thankful that medicine is so advanced that we are able to get a vaccine as quick as we did.

15540,"I booked a trip for out West (Colorado) for early August and I still feel fairly confident I will be vaccinated by then, and I'm pretty much the last tier to be vaccinated (which is fair, I telework and have no underlying issues)."
15541,"I mean technically I feel like travel has become a free for all anyway (looking @ u people I see on Instagram) but responsible quarantine-free/vaccinated travel I feel like mid June, incorporating the time you need for the vaccine to be effective."

15545,"I never told anyone how to handle anything, just called out misinformed ways of interpreting data."
15546,"Not a single sentence in my post was me telling anyone how to handle health

The vast, vast majority of mild/asymptomatic cases don‚Äôt result in any long-term damage, and there are absolutely no scientific studies that claim otherwise

Waiting more than a week or two to get a vaccine that‚Äôs only slightly more effective against asymptomatic disease (and takes longer to get to peak efficacy) is the equivalent of driving a hundred miles because gas is 2 cents cheaper"

15548,Serious question
15549,How the fuck are they being allowed to export?
15550,would you tell your family and friends that you have covid after you invited them to get lunch in your house?
15551,Having the flu for 9 months isn't a viable option for me which is why I am concerned about any symptoms as opposed to just death and hospitalization.
15552,https://www.livescience.com/long-covid-19-most-common-symptoms.html

Are there Vitamin D seasonality measures for the States?"
15558,Perhaps this would show something.
15559,[deleted]
15560,It‚Äôs an interesting point.
15561,Morally it is a more challenging issue.
15562,Risk to patient vs rights of people to have employment despite a medical condition that makes them unable to get vaccinated.
15563,What in gods name is an article from April 2020 doing here
15564,"Nationwide, CDC is showing 123 million doses distributed and 94 injected -- so that means 29 million doses are ... somewhere."
15565,How is it not the same with covid?
15566,By not following guidelines and taking precautions you're putting others at risk as well as yourself.
15567,Much like impaired driving.
15568,Not at all.
15569,The biggest point of the vaccine is herd immunity.
15570,You'll be far less likely to catch covid 3 months from now even with no vaccine since so many people around you will have already got one.
15571,Getting a 65% effective vaccine now versus a 95% effective one 3 months from now isn't as simple as comparing 65% and 95%.
15572,Getting the less effective vaccine earlier is likely to reduce your overall risk more.
15573,I guess if you want to be technical those people won't have covid-19 they will have some other disease.
15574,There is hope though.
15575,Thus coronavirus does not mutate as much as the flu.
15576,The vaccine could wipe it out.
15577,"Additionally, mRNA vaccines are a game-changer and could have far-reaching impacts on how we protect ourselves from viruses and could even be used to protect against the flu and colds."
15578,I do see what you are saying.
15579,I prefer to have an optimistic view though.
15580,Why?
15581,If everyone who wants it is vaccinated by July and hospitalizations are super low it doesn't seem needed to me
15582,There's really not going to be that many people in this state that aren't eligible now.
15583,"Anyone with a BMI over 25 is eligible, and we aren't exactly the slimmest of states."
15584,[removed]
15585,"Can we not flag this as ""good news""?"
15586,There are a lot of opinions about when mask mandates should be lifted and shoehorning your bias into the flair isn't conducive to good conversation.
15587,"And once again, Canada hides its face from embarrassment."
15588,"I had already taken that into account, their official toll is 160k deaths and from the news on their local newspapers I think they may have had a 50% underreporting at most, so they would be at 240k deaths at max but nothing more"
15589,Soreness at the spot of injection.
15590,passed within few hours.
15591,That's cuz the Pfizer vaccine has extra Bill Gates chips in it.
15592,"Maybe you should look at the ""easy read"" since apparently the dashboard is too difficult: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read

15593,"Now, tell me how many people had a positive test result reported on 8th March 2021?"
15594,"Thing is, we don't know if the vaccine prevents long haul covid."
15595,"But it would seem logical that if the virus is subdued rather quickly, then it won't have an opportunity to cause much damage."
15596,Plus some of these moderate cases vaccinated people are getting could just be in innate immune response (Similar to the vaccine side effects) and not by the virus itself.
15597,"All that being said, I'd rather those at high risk get the mRNA vaccines."
15598,"I'm 45 and I""m pretty sure I'm getting the JJ one next month, and I'll be very happen when that's done."

15608,Rural for us is a good couple hour drive considering we live in center of Metro Detroit.
15609,Not a reasonable feat for many.
15610,Half of seniors not vaccinated is not something that is just some few scarce cases.
15611,"Right, but you didn't answer my original thought."
15612,"SOME people are hurting but a demonstrable and provable number of people are saving more than ever before, and paying down more debt than ever before."
15613,There is a SIGNFICANT portion of people between 60-100k lets call it who have not been impacted in any tangible way by the pandemic and are already saving more than ever.
15614,That's a good thing- I'm glad that's happening.
15615,But why are they getting an influx of money in the waning hours of the pandemic?
15616,What's the point?
15617,My salary will probably be reduced by 30-40k as a direct result of Covid (I sell to office space/hospitality etc).
15618,"I already pay an exorbitant sum of money in taxes, so where's my help?"
15619,Where's my extra cash?
15620,I am being directly impacted by this but some person who is way richer than me randomly decided that I don't need it?

15721,"It‚Äôs quite clear where your bias lies, but he‚Äôs  using state and national constitutions for his decision making."
15722,"That‚Äôs why we have never seen a federal mask mandate, because it‚Äôs simply unconstitutional."

15727,So to be clear it‚Äôs 2 percent everyday?
15728,I thought it might be cumulative for every few weeks it was not clear
15729,I think you‚Äôre looking at the wrong numbers.
15730,I believe the 5.12% number includes the fully vaccinated while Bloomberg is separating it out!
15731,Check what the time period the growth rate is being reported for.
15732,2% daily and 2% total are rather significantly different end results.
15733,When can young and healthy people get one?
15734,As far as I know we are still on 1a.
15735,This really put a bee in your bonnet.

15739,The side of people who want to spread diseases and sicken people?
15740,Worrying about the important issues I see.
15741,The only thing that could throw this off is that basically 10% of Hawaii's population is active duty military and who knows how many retirees from the military.
15742,"The DoD and VA are taking care of those shots, and they'll probably be completely done by the end of this month."
15743,"When you have an extra ""shadow"" 10% of your population vaccinated that aren't being reported by the state, that's going to have an effect on the numbers, too."
15744,A big effect.
15745,"Hawaii has been a pretty decent place to weather the storm...except for all those jobs lost from comparatively no tourism, of course."
15746,Screaming matches here we come.
15747,I'm going with May 11.
15748,Let's hope I'm wrong in that it's earlier than that.
15749,"I don't know how it works in America, but here you can buy insurance for that."
15750,One is a governor who has advisers reporting Covid information to him.
15751,He is responsible for the well-being of a state and statewide mandates.
15752,A chief of police does not have anywhere near this information coming into him and just has his own opinions.
15753,"I can surely understand that the governor releasing a state wide stranglehold is going to cause conflict among areas that still could use mask mandates, but the chief of police has no business going on national ‚Äúnews‚Äù to discuss the medical side of Covid."
15754,He‚Äôs just some random Joe with an opinion.
15755,I guess this is more of a slam on CNN being desperate for their narrative than anything else.

15774,"That's where the whole ""the cure is deadlier than the virus"" mantra came from - the idea that having to wear a mask and social distance would somehow drive people into madness and that the amount of resulting suicides would dwarf the amount of people who would die from Covid."
15775,"Now things are getting better and we actually can let some restrictions go, but there's sort of a ""crying wolf"" type effect going on where the idea that people who say that mental health justifies easing restrictions are in the wrong has been engrained into people's minds so hard that they're now stuck in that mindset."

15790,It's weird when people act like every state just got the same amount lol.

15792,"That said, [Alaska did get a slightly bigger than proportionate amount.]"
15793,"(https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/02/04/alaska-vaccine-covid-remote/) Still not enough to downplay their achievement, though."
15794,It looks higher because we do batches but in Iowa we're down to real per day deaths of only 0-2 people.
15795,7 day death total is 11 down from 32 at the monthly high in February.
15796,The winds of change are definitely blowing and the end of the pandemic is on the horizon thanks to the vaccines allowing us to expedite building up immunity in the population while protecting the vulnerable
15797,Thank you.
15798,I guess we will know soon which predictions are accurate.
15799,This will be.
15800,In June or so.
15801,I know how it‚Äôll sound but if you say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a pill for it now‚Äù supply would be gone in a few weeks.
15802,You need to release this with a lot of supply and low cases due to a vaccine.
15803,Name one what lmao there is no point to comparing states unless you normalize the metric to account for how many people are within that state
15804,It seemed like there were bars not requiring this though.
15805,I just saw a few clips on my city's subreddit which showed clubs carrying on like normal.
15806,"Basically I think if you wanted to find things to do where restrictions weren't being enforced, it was possible."
15807,"Why is it the case that on both a national and apparently state level in Texas, that the blue areas are the ones driving the economy?"

15812,As written the title suggests they are challenging the biotic origins of life and the germ theory of disease in one go.
15813,What did they do?
15814,Abbott's EO only bans jail as a punishment for local pandemic-related ordinances.
15815,"Cities enacting ordinances that aren't negated by the EO (such as a mask mandate) can still issue other penalties, such as fines."
15816,"Seriously, people need to stop opining before they've actually [read the damn thing](https://open.texas.gov/uploads/files/organization/opentexas/EO-GA-34-opening-Texas-response-to-COVID-disaster-IMAGE-03-02-2021.pdf)."

15822,Freedom.
15823,"It's the smell of freedom that does not exist in Austin, Texas."""
15824,How much we already knew that no one cares about society safety as much as individual quality of life.
15825,I kind of hope this gets removed as spreading disinformation.
15826,"You're defining ""lower efficacy"" as .9% lower, which is easily within a standard deviation."
15827,"For the SA variant, the vaccine's still have a ""robust but lower"" effectiveness (12.4 times less effective for Pfizer, 10.3 times less effective for Moderna."
15828,I'm not a statistician and don't even understand what these calculations mean).
15829,After your first shot you will have the majority of the coverage.

15832,Was there any basic precautions in place?
15833,The absolute 180 that this country made on teachers during this pandemic from the start to now was whiplash-inducing.
15834,Is it really that big of a deal?
15835,"Different strokes I guess, if I bother with going to a bar, I‚Äôm fine as long as there‚Äôs a drink in my hand."
15836,"I volunteered and due to that, I got my two shots even though I'm just a college student!"
15837,We needed to fine people for violating the mask mandate.
15838,Frankly the priority tiers should be on the honor system...
15839,"I'd rather we focus on administering shots at this point, not vetting every person."
15840,Priority was more important at the beginning when supply was extraordinarily low and no one was vaccinated.

15842, 2.

15856,The level of uncritical praise Fauci has seemingly been showered with despite him smugly telling the country he deliberated lied to them about masks during what we now know was a rather critical period is frankly very disturbing.

16038,Source for the fact that a lot of people have chosen to stay home or take lower risk vacations over the past year??
16039,I'm not sure if a vague statement without a specific percentage needs a source.
16040,I was mostly considering family and friends' experiences.
16041,The people I know who love travel all stayed closer to home or voluntarily quarantined for two weeks after returning home.
16042,My point was just that a lot of people are excited about traveling longer distances without worrying or quarantining because of vaccines.
16043,"But this is a comprehensive article:
https://www.ustravel.org/toolkit/covid-19-travel-industry-research"
16044,"If that's how you want to phrase it, then yes, I do think it's a good idea."
16045,"It's been known for months that the risk is in *extended* face-to-face contact, not fleeting interactions."

16050,"Even in them, there are unofficial loopholes where people who really want to get one can get on a waiting list or wait outside and they then give people who technically don't qualify what's left over for the day."

16055,I think we should be wearing them during cold and flu season in perpetuity.
16056,Anti-Covid restriction have completely shut down influenza.
16057,I think the timelines will move up as the states get more supply.
16058,But OR is getting completely shafted in the distribution ‚Äî AK has received 78% more doses per capita than OR.
16059,It seems like the states are getting praised and blamed for distribution but the ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù states are frequently receiving 20%+ doses than the ‚Äúfailing‚Äù states.
16060,OR seems to be a good job using the doses they have received with 83% utilization (NYT).

16066,"Central Oregon checking in.... ""general population""

16067,This is impressive.
16068,The weird thing about Israel is that they've been really stressing getting people double doses.
16069,"So even though they're near 100 doses per 100 people, they only have 55% given at least one dose."
16070,"It looks like in retrospect it might've been better to try to prioritize getting everyone the first dose, like Canada is trying to do."
16071,Also there is correlation with rural areas and higher 65+ demographics (some more rural states are over 50%).
16072,Likely with 1A/1B jobs as well.
16073,For instance there's much more manufacturing/energy/housing construction jobs in rural areas and less gig economy jobs.
16074,It does feel a bit like punishment though considering more urban areas have much more social interaction.
16075,Do we really need to be vaccinating those who may routinely not see anyone outside their household because their neighbors houses aren't even in sight over those who can't walk outside without seeing dozens of people even if the former is higher risk?
16076,Right?
16077,"Florida is a mystery to me.. no covid restrictions since September, awful decisions made by state government at every turn, huge elderly population, tons of tourist traffic."

16081,Yes!
16082,the point of these vaccines are to get us out of the pandemic and prevent deaths.
16083,That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing.
16084,Only thing that somewhat bothers me about J&amp;J is that you can still contract the virus (60-70% efficacy) and have moderate disease from which I‚Äôve heard that a lot of people get long hauler symptoms.
16085,That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to avoid and hopefully it‚Äôll get addressed soon.
16086,Yeah seems like the numbers we hoped for aren‚Äôt happening.
16087,Pretty disappointing TBH.
16088,Starting to lose the faith and thinking June is much more likely to be the month where we reach very high levels of vaccination like 60-80 percent full vaccination

16142,It would be interesting to see them do this poll every month till May.
16143,My guess is as weather I the NE gets warmer less and less people are going to mask by May it will be nice enough everywhere to be outside and people will start to feel more pressure to put the mask down.
16144,Warm weather but the inevitable CDC guideline saying the vaccinated don‚Äôt need masks and peer pressure will flip and people will feel the need to be unmasked.

16275,"Thats ok, just, It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with age there are people who can't get vaccinated in any age."
16276,"I mean, that's just discussion."
16277,Wearing a mask is good.
16278,Not wearing a mask is bad.
16279,It‚Äôs not an opinion.
16280,It‚Äôs science.
16281,It‚Äôs fact
16282,Oh you are right.
16283,That is a big drop from yesterday.
16284,Not out of our ass never said that.
16285,Have a good day dude.
16286,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm.
16287,This is the study itself.
16288,Its actually half a percent but is daily...so it adds up.
16289,"TBH I think as much as we talk about masks and have quotes from Fauci that masks are more important than the vaccine that you would presume they did more, but the data show what it shows."
16290,[removed]
16291,You have your opinion and I have mine.
16292,Ageism is wrong.
16293,And yet covid still exists....
16294,You obviously didn't read what I wrote.
16295,"I didn't say that no Californians were moving to Texas, I said that no one wishes they were in Texas."
16296,Lots of people are moving out of California because it's so increasingly popular that it's getting too expensive for some to live there.
16297,"Also, you're trying to make a single incident sound small."
16298,That single incident was massive and people didn't have power for several days because of rank mismanagement by the texas government.
16299,Have a good one!
16300,RemindMe!
16301,3 months
16302,&gt; Why are you so bothered by it?
16303,"Because it makes therapy more difficult, and I don‚Äôt want to find another therapist after I‚Äôve been working with this person for the last 5 years, and they‚Äôre the only good therapist I‚Äôve ever had."
16304,Sorry it‚Äôs not more plainly obvious why talking with another human being in a very emotionally intense context is harder to do while wearing masks.
16305,"I also don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre approaching this in good faith, so eat my shit."
16306,"I‚Äôm glad it keeps you from dying or going to the hospital, but I prefer to not get sick at all."
16307,I imagine if you catch it even with the vaccine it will still feel like the worst flu like symptoms of your life.
16308,"Too bad the ""free press"" has been spreading misinformation about how some aren't effective."
16309,Never.
16310,"We were open for about a month before they closed everything then later came up with this for the second ""opening."""
16311,That 10 percent is the most vulnerable though
16312,None of the things you mentioned are detrimental to other people's health.
16313,I always liked his anti-lockdown posts but the anti-vax stuff earned an unfollow from me.
16314,"Don't know what the actual numbers are, but the more people get the shot the better."
16315,There are some people who said they won't get it when it's available but I think when the chips are down and people realize that vaccines aren't making people spontaneously buy microsoft products I think there will be less skeptics than we might think.
16316,But I'm also just some rando idk
16317,That‚Äôs perfectly fine and I would feel the same way if I lived in that area.
16318,I‚Äôm more talking about those who hope it fails to prove a point
16319,Yeah come around back at the Walgreens tonight and ask for Julio.
16320,I believe appointments can already be booked in OH.
16321,I know my mother lives in OH and is in the 50-59 age group and set up her appointment as soon as they announced Thursday they'd begin administering to a younger group.
16322,Is there any indication that she did?
16323,Why do you care if you are getting vaccine ?
16324,We've been in the neighborhood of 75% administered nationally for the past few weeks.
16325,It fluctuates over time as big deliveries come in.
16326,"This is not unexpected given that weekly deliveries are going up in size, but if we don't see administration start to catch up to distribution in a week or two it'll be quite concerning."
16327,"Coach Z, you jerk!"
16328,I‚Äôve been listening to Jha.
16329,He‚Äôs great.
16330,The problem is I don‚Äôt think anybody honesty thinks after ‚Äúa few weeks‚Äù the government is going to say it‚Äôs all clear.
16331,Although that seems to be what he‚Äôs implying.
16332,"Yeah, having watched them roll it out, I definitely agree with you."
16333,Kind of fumbled the start.
16334,"I‚Äôm a healthy 20 year old, but I also work around a lot of covid (especially when it was really really bad and it felt like every patient was there for covid) so I felt slightly bad, but at the same time Ohio was slowly opening it up to elderly people and was vaccinating everyone in nursing homes, which was a good thing."
16335,"I‚Äôm grateful my dad can finally get it, it‚Äôs promising that they‚Äôve already opened it up to 50+ since so many older people have already gotten theirs!"
16336,"I mean, you could just say you're doing freelance work in finance or something."
16337,I don't think anyone's checking.

16340,My MIL is eligible in Ohio and is considering driving down there to get it.
16341,"Yeah, but all that vacation time..."
16342,Agreed.
16343,"Means to an end.Given the choice between being rigid for the sake of consistency or being flexible so we can protect more human rights, I hope we always choose the latter."
16344,"It's not like the ones we're fighting have any principles to speak of, it seems silly to play the game with one hand tied behind our backs with people who have no qualms about using anything and everything in their power to keep us down."
16345,"Time to do away with the filibuster, pass election reform and see how Republicans really fare when they can't cheat anymore."

16352,Yeah it doesnt seem like theres much for them to do in that situation.
16353,Luckily i think their main priority is getting needles in arms vs strictly enforcing the phases.
16354,I‚Äôd imagine the number of people doing that are not great enough to warrant any serious investigations into that.
16355,Def more likely to die from being a fatty than from Covid tho.
16356,Good for You
16357,Get that shot in as many arms as possible and hit herd immunity ASAP
16358,Do you think there will be any kind of breaking point that signals to the vast majority of people (or possibly everyone) that the pandemic is over and we can congregate without masks without fear?
16359,"I feel like the only real breaking points there have been (and by breaking point, I mean a sharp shift downwards in risk/situation) is when the Moderna vaccine was announced to be highly effective, and then when each of us personally gets vaccinated."
16360,I really can't think of anything else in the future that can be objectively considered a breaking point where even the most anxious among us will have no problem being in public.
16361,"It seems like as vaccinations proliferate, Covid numbers will gradually go down (with small rises at times I'm sure), but that would make there be no clear-cut time where we're all like ""Ok, we're good now."""
16362,"I understand that the virus will never go away of course, but that's not really what I'm talking about."
16363,"We had a new record of this year in Poland, they're saying it will stay this way up to May."
16364,What a joke... F\*ck this government.
16365,"Not doing anything to stop this, putting in measure of lockdown that go in to effect 10-14 days after announced."
16366,What is the point?
16367,Do it RIGHT AWAY!
16368,"The big study (1.2M people) in Israel from a few weeks ago supports basically ""full"" immunity (92%) at 7 days after the second shot."
16369,"The study cited in this article is a different on with a somewhat group, but it's saying you get 89% protection in the 7-14 day window after your second shot."
16370,It's a pretty minor difference.
16371,"I'm ok with vaccinating seniors first, they make up a larger portion of COVID deaths and it's easier to check for eligibility based on age."
16372,"Adding professions and deciding teachers are more important than a bus driver, or a Publix worker, or a sanitation engineer is making it too complicated."
16373,I feel bad for the pharmacists trying to keep up with who is eligible and whatever random forms/documentation are supposed to be provided.
16374,Yep.
16375,Gov.
16376,Abbott is an ass
16377,Mask mandates weren't removed until 12:01am this morning.
16378,Try harder.
16379,Ohh well if thats the case since so many are 2 shot vaccines then yes we will probably hit 200m
16380,Did these people learn anything from the initial messaging about masks?
16381,Guess not
16382,[removed]
16383,I‚Äôm positive that there are 200M adults who want a vaccine.
16384,The issue is state restrictions for eligibility.
16385,"I‚Äôd get one today if I could, but I probably won‚Äôt be able for at least another 2 months."
16386,[deleted]
16387,So anyone else about to fly to Alaska to get vaccinated?
16388,I don't think thats going to slow anything down at all.
16389,Most people I know that want a vaccine would prefer J&amp;J because its only 1 shot.
16390,There's just no talking to some people.
16391,I see people on Twitter still convinced the US is botching the rollout entirely.
16392,Of course they won't look at the data from other countries or anything.
16393,We‚Äôre not all stupid down here....
16394,Never assume local sources are accurate in Texas.
16395,"There are two flavors of media here at the moment:

1:  We like the reopening and we're going to post positive

2:  We don't like the reopening and we're going to spin accordingly"
16396,"I was looking at the entire USA... we can go state by state, and I'll find plenty more examples that are the exact opposite of MD."
16397,"Now, if this entire discussion was solely based on MD, then my bad."
16398,Europe and the US have one massive difference that will NOT allow for the 4th peak in the US.

16440,It's likely to show increased efficacy and we will likely be at a point where we can just start using all of the J&amp;J vaccine to provide second doses to everyone who got that one.

16507,Luckily my 94 year old grandfather who lives there was able to get his already.
16508,It all was a publicity campaign but the result is definitely a positive story regardless.
16509,People that will lie about being vaccinated are already going out anyway.
16510,"So nothing will change, other than vaccinated people wearing masks when they don‚Äôt need to."
16511,The only logical reason to continue to wear a mask is that all the jerkoffs who are anti-vax would also stop wearing masks and just claim they got the vaccine when asked.
16512,What people need to understand that the arm pain is not caused by the vaccine injection but because of the antibodies starting to react to the vaccine.
16513,So depending on your inmune responde your arm may mildly hurt for 1-2 days.

16547,"That being said, it's the only symptom I've experienced thus far."
16548,did the hospitalizations drop that significantly during their other lock downs?
16549,their last lockdown started december 24 and within three weeks the case count had doubled are you going to blame the lockdown for that also?
16550,it ended first week of feb and within three weeks after that the numbers dropped precipitously...so why would you think the lockdown caused cases to drop but not causing cases to rise?
16551,"Alaska is a state within the US and doesn't have the ability to circumvent federal policy and donate their vaccine stock to ""other countries."""

16554,I feel like they will.
16555,Everywhere I look number of doses delivered is significantly more than doses administered on a day-to-day basis.
16556,Hence why so many states are expanding eligibility so rapidly.

16573,"""Door verbeterde effici√´ntie kunnen we sneller leveren onder de bestaande overeenkomst"", zegt een woordvoerder van Pfizer tegen de NOS."
16574,"""Er zijn zodoende geen 'extra' doses, ze vallen binnen de overeengekomen 500 miljoen."""
16575,&gt; De 169.000 coronavaccins die Nederland de komende weken meer geleverd krijg dan eerder was afgesproken zijn dus een versnelde levering van vaccins die al eerder besteld waren.
16576,"Eerder vandaag zei voorzitter van de Europese Commissie, Ursula Von der Leyen, dat de EU extra vaccins heeft onderhandeld, zo staat het ook in het persbericht van de Commissie."
16577,&gt; Na vragen van de NOS bevestigt Europese Commissie dat er geen extra doses worden geleverd.
16578,"Een woordvoerder zegt dat Von der Leyen bedoelde ""extra bovenop de leveringen in het eerste kwartaal."""
16579,I got the J&amp;J about 16 hours ago (super happy to receive any of them!)
16580,"and I woke up with a small headache, chills, and aches, but it's manageable."
16581,"LOL, why not continue to politicize a crisis??"
16582,It's not like more than half a million people are dead or anything.
16583,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm in Pennsylvania, and our governor is f*cking up vaccine distribution so badly, Democrats are starting to turn on him because 2022 is also a gubernatorial election for us, and they don't want him messing up the Democratic candidates chances."
16584,(We term limit after two terms here.)
16585,Our distribution is something like...44th in the nation?
16586,And we're the fifth most populous state.
16587,"Worst, they can't even tell us WHY it's this bad."
16588,"Philadelphia is one of the largest cities in the US, and it's not getting the product it needs to vaccinate well."

16596,I‚Äôm interested to see how this goes.
16597,Being outdoors reduces the risk of transmission by a lot.
16598,"If they are able to enforce the masks, then things should go ok. Nobody should be hoping for it to fail."
16599,You‚Äôre essentially rooting for the virus at that point.
16600,"Nice, gonna hit 100M on Friday."
16601,"One thing---I read 120m doses would be distributed in March, but it seems we're lagging that a tiny bit?"
16602,I personally believe I had it in March of last year when it started to become a main stream problem.
16603,"Roommate went to a convention in Chicago with his friends, and two of them (including him) got sick and had to take off work."
16604,I had what seemed like a cold just for one day and then felt fine.

16612,Meanwhile....in Texas.
16613,"Residents awaiting this headline, ‚ÄúTexas #1 cause of new coronavirus surge."
16614,Statewide shutdown.‚Äù
16615,Narrative?
16616,"I thought I was adding to the joke, but sometimes I have a weird sense of humor."

16620,"You're concern trolling, which is against the rules."
16621,"Try facts, mate."
16622,so you have to understand two things here.
16623,First is that isolation is just not possible for certain industries.
16624,Second is that any prevention measure short of complete isolation does not have 100 percent effectiveness.
16625,"Even if we all wore masks without question, this disease would still spread exponentially, just slower."
16626,"Which would make the pandemic last longer, but with a lower peak."
16627,"Which is what we call ""flattening the curve""."
16628,It's basic math if you actually understand that prevention is not equal to 100 percent stopping of all spread.
16629,That just is not possible or feasible.
16630,"Ideally, sure, but it doesn't work practically in the real world."
16631,They never were.
16632,We knew they would be lying about all of this from day 1.
16633,"And they continue to lie to the WHO, who we continue to waste tax dollars on."
16634,"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/world-health-organization-blame-pandemic-coronavirus/609820/

China will continue to lie about this."
16635,And their bots &amp; shills will continue to downvote anything critical of mother China on reddit as well.
16636,This is no surprise.
16637,Opening day is about 4 weeks away so hopefully vaccine distribution gets ramped up even more by then.
16638,"They also are going to have some social-distance sections, but not on opening day for some reason (money I assume)."
16639,Does anyone mind explaining how we can *definitively* say that the vaccine didn't cause her death?
16640,"I'm not anti-vaxx or anything, but just curious as to how we can say that the vaccine didn't cause organ failure in a supposedly healthy person"
16641,"This is like saying ""there's no way to guarantee that people won't drink and drive so we're not going to do anything to curb it""."
16642,"It's absolutely something we can control much better than we have, and there's every reason to believe that it only got this bad because our political leadership was actively spreading disinformation."
16643,Now that we're getting back to potentially being a leader in combating CV there's every reason to believe that we'll get other countries to follow suit.
16644,"Honestly, they kind of have to if our numbers really do keep dropping."
16645,No one is going to want to visit or do business with countries that do nothing to contain the virus.
16646,"And again, what you're saying goes against what the experts are saying about this and every other virus."
16647,Taking every reasonable precaution to slow the spread is absolutely the right move and will pay dividends.
16648,"Failure to do so means we might as well forget about the human race, because this *will* not be the last Coronavirus to impact humanity."
16649,Do actual mandates exist for that scenario?

16657,"Sorry, did my bracketed disclaimer not make it clear enough for you that I was joking?"
16658,People who got the pfizer did you feel any effects?
16659,I can‚Äôt speak for other states but NJ is doing a much better job than the federal retail program (about 80-90 percent for state sites verse 50 percent for federal retail programs.
16660,That being said most doses are in state facilities).
16661,The average daily vaccines distributed is just under 3 million.
16662,It was about half of that just a few weeks ago (before storms).
16663,The average daily vaccines administered at that time was about 1.6 million a day.
16664,No excuse not to be over 2.5 million a day now.
16665,CONGRATS!!
16666,!
16667,&gt;Is there any data about protection offered by one Moderna shot?
16668,Esp.
16669,at 14 days?
16670,"One study suggested something on the order of 75% efficacy at around two weeks after the first shot, which would be on the same order of protection that you would get from a single J&amp;J dose."
16671,The original Moderna trial also showed vaccine recipients over 90% less likely to be infected than the control group between two weeks after the first dose and receiving the second dose.
16672,"However, I would take this with a grain of salt - the sample sizes are *really* small here and the data gathering wasn't necessarily as rigorous as the post-second-dose Moderna trial that resulted in approval, so all I would personally take from this is ""it probably provides very good protection but we're not sure *exactly* how much or how long""."
16673,&gt;Should I be concerned that I didn't have any reaction to the shot?
16674,No.
16675,"Lots of people do not have side effects, especially after the first shot."
16676,"&gt;Related to question 2: I've been taking ivermectin weekly since November, including a few hours after I was vaccinated (I took it because I was in the company of several dozen people at the vaccination site, with decent distancing *most* of the time but no noticeable ventilation)."
16677,You probably shouldn't be taking invermectin unless a doctor recommended it.
16678,&gt;Would a serologic test reveal whether the vaccine has had an effect?
16679,"Serology test is [not a reliable way](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/variants-vaccines-and-what-they-mean-for-covid19-testing.html) to tell if the vaccine is protective (""People who have been vaccinated may be interested in getting a serology test, to see if the vaccine ‚Äúworked,‚Äù but a vaccinated person is very likely to get a negative result from a serology test, even if the vaccine was successful and protective."")"
16680,so will not provide much value to you.
16681,Well we're gonna see how it plays out.
16682,I really hope it goes well so other things can come back
16683,"In addition, they‚Äôll be changing the stadium name to Globe Death Field."

16719,Hope so.

16721,"Whatever the cdc say, is what I want to follow"
16722,"I found that the FDA.gov site does expect a median follow up time of 2 months of safety data for the EUA, but I can‚Äôt find a source on 6 months for full approval."

16728,Read this article and notice the extreme attention it is paying to ensure people understand the deaths may not be attributed to the vaccine though they did have the vaccine.
16729,"The media has gone through hoops to ensure the vaccine is safe, to the point of obfuscating science and reports otherwise."
16730,"I'm not saying it is unsafe, however it leads to conspiracies to form when you unabashedly hide the details of a Florida doctor who died after getting the vaccine."
16731,"On the flip side, the New York Times hosted a full page of names that died to covid."
16732,The 7th name was a gunshot victim.
16733,Another was found with twice the lethal limit of alcohol in his blood.
16734,Yet listed as covid and published in the paper.
16735,Where was the care to ensure the public knew they might not be attributed to covid.
16736,The circles I'm in noticed these types of stories.
16737,"It led to conversations and jokes (gallows humor) that they died ""with covid"" and not ""caused by covid""."
16738,The article I linked above with the details of people showing to emergency rooms with significant and late diagnosed problems is not new.
16739,These types of reports have been circulating since June of last year.
16740,"In April of last year, when the pandemic was in full panic mode and everyone was staying home to keep hospitals safe, it was [reported that hospitals were furloughing staff](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/49-hospitals-furloughing-workers-in-response-to-covid-19.html)."
16741,These types of comments and articles were buried in the media.
16742,"They were met with derision and false accusations, especially on this coronavirus sub."
16743,"To be completely clear, I've worn my mask."
16744,I am working from home when possible.
16745,And all my friends live across country so I socially distance them with online games.
16746,"However, when my grandfather was sick and died last year, I was prevented from seeing him due to covid measures."
16747,"When my wife and I went to the doctor to discover if he needed surgery, I was prevented from going back with him because covid measures."
16748,"Later this year, I will be the only one who can visit my son in the hospital after his surgery because of covid measures."
16749,"So, you see, at this stage of the game, I don't believe the media."

16751,This sub is all in on the fear porn.

16754,Hopefully.

16760,"I have no concerns with vaccines like polio that were created many years ago, have proven safe, and the creator forfeited the patent for the betterment of all."
16761,I do however have a problem with pharmaceutical companies who face no liability and tons of profit pushing one out this fast.
16762,"At the end of the day, we need facts presented in fair and equitable means and we need to let people make their own responsible choices."
16763,Is the vaccine a microchip?
16764,No.
16765,Is it purposefully designed to cause harm?
16766,No.
16767,Has it been held to the same rigorous evaluation of previous vaccines?
16768,No.
16769,"There's also unfortunately going to be a split in that more Black and Hispanic people get the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine while (up to now) more white people got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, because of the overlap of race and economic disparity related to the fact the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need more expense ultracold storage and the J&amp;J is easier to distribute."

16774,"No, you're still missing key details here."
16775,"Yes, 4 weeks is where they set the endpoint, but as I said that was likely premature."
16776,You can't say Pfizer plateaued at 4 weeks and apply that to J&amp;J. Pfizer is M-rna and J&amp;J is adenovirus.
16777,Adenovirus vector vaccines appear to take longer to reach their peak.
16778,AZ lowering efficacy with the booster too early isn't weird at all.
16779,It makes total sense when you take into account vector resistance.
16780,This is why I say J&amp;J set their endpoint too early.
16781,"Keep in mind, the numbers you're using for AZ are from new data."
16782,"It seems like you're mixing up numbers from the initial AZ data with the recent, as well as numbers from J&amp;J and AZ."
16783,One dose of AZ didn't reach 70+% until about 90 days after inoculation.
16784,90 days vs 28 days for J&amp;J.
16785,Not at all comparable.
16786,"AZ numbers 
2 doses, 6 weeks apart = 55.1%
1 dose after 9 weeks = 76%
2 doses 12 weeks apart = 81.3%

If J&amp;J follows a similar pattern, it means the one-shot would likely approach mid 70's after two months."

16856,the lists are not the same.
16857,"I have three on the 2nd list, but can't get a vaccine."
16858,"I mean maybe I shouldn't get a vaccine now, but it irritates me that someone who just registers to work for instacart can get one, and I can't."
16859,"hypothetically speaking, if people stopped ""partying"" and wore masks at some certain percentage rate, if they followed social distancing at some reasonable level (you can make all those determinations) what would the case count graph have looked like throughout the last year?"
16860,"i never suggested we go maskless or lick doorknobs (or microphones, looking at you gobert), what i'm trying to figure out is what level of infection was inevitable and what level might have been impacted by behavior had messaging been better or adherence or ""personal responsibility"" etc."
16861,"i think it's relevant since when people look at the cost of lockdown versus virus they typically add up one side and the other and compare, but if some certain amount of virus was not changable then the calculus changes, it's not lockdown versus virus it's lockdown versus 80% of the virus total or lockdown versus virus minus 50,000 cases per day or whatever (completely making up those numbers)"
16862,We're virtually guaranteed to get 20% of Americans fully vaccinated this month.
16863,"I don't think we'll hit 30%, we're just too far into March for it to happen."
16864,"That said, I do think that if this month is the biggest acceleration for initiating vaccination, April will be the biggest acceleration for full vaccination."
16865,"If the United States is able to expand eligibility and administer around 80% of the distributed doses, we'll hit a majority of adults initiating vaccination this month."
16866,That would mean a majority of adults completing it at some point next month.

16870,The only error he's ever made is by stepping out of line regarding mask usage a year ago.
16871,He's incredible!
16872,I‚Äôll give it a shot.
16873,I don‚Äôt think we have had time to see and report the hospitalizations and deaths yet.
16874,"Yesterday I read 42% of our cases now are the UK variant, and that that is a recent and sharp increase."
16875,We are expected to surpass 50% by next week.
16876,That‚Äôs how fast this variant moves‚Äîmuch faster than the wild type.
16877,"Wouldn‚Äôt it take time for someone to catch the UK variant, about a week to go to the hospital, another couple of weeks to die, then who knows how long to be reported?"
16878,Maybe we will see the hospitalization and death count go up in a month or so to reflect what has happened over the last few weeks?
16879,"EDIT for hope: maybe the vaccines will also prevent some of the expected deaths, and we won‚Äôt see a huge spike!"
16880,It‚Äôs really not a mystery.

16883,"Shutting businesses just kills the economy, not stops spread."
16884,&gt; I felt like celebrating after getting my first dose of the vaccine.
16885,THIS so very much.
16886,NGL I'm a grown ass man and I cried after getting the call to come in to get my first shot.
16887,My wife asked me why I was crying because it was good news.
16888,I said that they were really tears of joy since this pandemic has destroyed my already fragile mental health.
16889,In that instant when I got that call a huge weight was lifted.
16890,I finally felt like I could relax and breathe finally.
16891,"I think I made the persons day on the phone as well as I thanked her profusely over and over and let her know that she just didn't
""Make my day"", she made my year, literally."
16892,"I know it's not over yet and I'm still going to be diligent, wear a mask and take the general precautions but I don't have to be overwhelmed by it any longer after being fully vaxxed."
16893,"Of course, it's Alaska, they don't need additional equipment to store/transport those vaccine in low temperature"
16894,They have faced production constraints.
16895,Like every other fucking manufacturer.
16896,They‚Äôve delivered millions of doses.
16897,Too slow.
16898,We should be at 3 million.
16899,"Right now, many states are still mostly at the over 65 stage for vaccines."
16900,"If a demographic has a lower life expectancy, a lower percentage of the demographic is represented in eligible group."
16901,For example 13% of white people are over age 65 vs 9% and 8% for black people and Latinos respectively.
16902,Most of the articles are saying the lower numbers bare due to hesitancy which does play a part.
16903,But equity in distribution could be playing a bigger role.
16904,"The most notable difference, in my mind, is that mandates in Florida generally don't usually extend to outdoor areas like they do elsewhere (unless you're in Miami, where it did at one point)."
16905,But inside?
16906,"Mask wearing is nearly 100%, and I'm not one to worry about the one or two maskless people tbh."
16907,"I do also see people outdoors, alone, and wearing masks pretty often."
16908,"That I will never understand, but to each their own at this point."
16909,Thank goodness.
16910,Let's hope Brazil can speed up their hopelessly slow vaccine rollout - I understand they're having significant issues with supply on top of all their other current misery.

16920,"How about, ""just fast"", the faster the better"
16921,The EU didn‚Äôt impose an export ban so vaccine manufacturers chose it as a manufacturing centre.
16922,"Just off top of my head, lets say each vial has at least 1, but at most 6 doses."
16923,"The rite aid I went to said they could only open/administer 20 shots a day, setting aside the fact 20 is not divisible by 6 which effectively guarantees wasted doses, even a single shot at the end of the day leftover is 5% waste imho that's still too high."

16929,His only message at this point needs to be that you have zero excuse not to get vaccinated once it's available to you.
16930,But there‚Äôs so many of them.
16931,Imagine all of them in the US just doing 10-30 a day.
16932,I got mine at Walmart yesterday.
16933,The process was great.
16934,And they‚Äôre scheduling was so much easier than the state

That most certainly *is* the plan."

16969,"We can't lock down forever, and we especially can't lock down just our older/immunocompromised citizens forever, so it was clear very early on that the vaccine was our only path to normalcy that didn't involve just completely giving up."
16970,"Every single thing that's happened between last March and this March certainly has not been inevitable, but there's no realistic scenario in which we would all be maskless and licking doorknobs in the US right now if it weren't for people being ""irresponsible"""
16971,"The NYT article says results from their US phase 3 trial are expected in April, which would likely mean EUA in May, and full approval several months later."

16998,So why didn't those measures eliminate covid if they eliminated the flu?
16999,[removed]
17000,I don‚Äôt think NYC has gone out of its way.
17001,They only started to address the problem in February.
17002,And their solution was to retool the website and open up vaccine locations in more areas.
17003,"There are no reports of widespread vaccine excess at the new locations, so that would suggest that  its working."
17004,"And while retooling a website may be effective, it doesn‚Äôt really address issues of lack of access to broadband."
17005,"So it‚Äôs too early to expect results, given that NYC just started these initiatives and I‚Äôm not convinced those solutions alone is enough to break through the significant barriers (eg languages)."
17006,"And of course, NYC is only but one city."
17007,"It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt have enough, it‚Äôs that they haven‚Äôt been properly allocated."
17008,Failures are at the state level so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have any power.
17009,Because of too strict eligibility requirements and too many shipments being directed towards more rural parts of GA we‚Äôre last among all 50 states for doses used (65% according to NYT).
17010,Assuming someone is eligible and lives outside the Metro Atlanta area it‚Äôs surprisingly easy to get an appointment.
17011,Grade school level math proves you wrong.
17012,"The important bits:

&gt;So far, health officials don't believe that this new variant strain causes more severe illness or reduces the effectiveness of vaccines, but it poses a health threat merely by spreading faster."
17013,"&gt;To break all that down further, Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said that the New York variant accounted for approximately 39% of all cases in the most recent week, up from 31% the week prior; the B.1.1.7 strain increased to 12% of all samples, from 8% the previous week."
17014,&gt;That means the New York variant is circulating at three times the level of the UK strain
17015,Not necessarily true because many of the previously 'held back' second shots are being administered now to people that got doses in February.
17016,In reality Pfizer/Moderna have never had any delays in the US (besides the freak snowstorm) so it's rather silly to keep 32 million doses in reserve when they could push forward faster and if there are production issues then slow appointments a bit.
17017,But given the US has 3 big manufacturers now it's nearly 0 likelihood that all 3 will experience delays at the same time.
17018,If tomorrow Pfizer announces big issues and a drop in production then shift new appointments to the other vaccines and use the reduced Pfizer shipments as second shots until things stabilize.
17019,"The US doesn't need 32 million doses in reserve, that's just poor management."
17020,Sandwich baggie
17021,Azithromycin?
17022,I read in my local media yesterday that the UK variant now accounts for 42% of positives in Florida.

17030,"According to the NYT MD is pretty middle of the pack on both % of fully Vaccinated, and % with the 1st shot."
17031,You know this pandemic is almost over when they're already clickbaiting for the next one.
17032,Exactly.
17033,And to be honest I‚Äôm not really sure why were listening to Chris Murray in this case.
17034,He basically trying to use a crystal ball here.
17035,Being the go to guy at predicting deaths and hospitalizations is very different from what basically amounts to trying to tell the future.
17036,I can go to my physician and ask what he thinks will happen in the next year.
17037,Why not publish an article on that?
17038,Now I‚Äôm not criticizing Chris Murray as a health professional.
17039,But this article should have basically had a disclaimer on the top saying something to the effect ‚Äúthis article is not based on currently verifiable data.
17040,It is the current beliefs of doctors of the IHME based on data that is currently being gathered and changing‚Äù
17041,The vaccine is free.
17042,But people don‚Äôt work for free.
17043,There is reimbursement from a number of programs for the injection of the vaccine.
17044,"But part of the deal, I believe, is that a special Medicare is covering it for everyone who doesn‚Äôt  have any other coverage."
17045,yeah when i was there i noticed that.
17046,masks everywhere inside.

17048,"Like they would say, look, we have exported 10 million doses to Chile or wherever."

17128,I live in Texas and it's a bit annoying how dramatic out of state family and friends are about this.
17129,It's not going to change anything.
17130,My city is keeping its mask mandate and when I went to get my vaccine today in a small town everyone in the store was still masked up.
17131,"I think once the vaccine is accessible to everyone this will change, especially with the new CDC guidelines that came out yesterday + more vaccines on the way."
17132,I think people are so addicted to bad news at this point that they're aimlessly projecting.
17133,I have friends in Minnesota checking on me but they're always at friends houses maskless and unvaccinated soooo like what's the difference?
17134,"&gt; True, but I don't think it takes a degree in rocket surgery to administer a vaccine shot."
17135,"P

You need some training to do it, and I suspect certifications in many locations."
17136,"But we aren't talking RN here, we are talking techs."
17137,2 mil plus for CDC
17138,"And you guys are about to get a fairly large influx of seasonal workers, who may or may not be vaccinated, so there is no reason to not open it up."
17139,"are you saying that the outcome was inevitable, that no matter whether there were masks or restrictions or not that everything after march 2020 was predetermined?"
17140,"I have a question:

I got my second dose(of Pfizer) on Monday and only had a sore arm as a side effect."
17141,"Today, it seems my boyfriend(who gets vaccinated this coming Monday) has a cold(or at least a sore throat) and anxious old me thinks I have one too."
17142,"I know I was told not to take advil, so my body could produce the immunity response it needs for the vaccine but would a cold have any affect on the efficiency of the vaccine?"
17143,"And if I take, say, cold medicine, would that affect anything?"
17144,The Walgreens out in Wisconsin have open vaccine times like 12 hours out sometimes through the app...
17145,It's definitely state-by-state but i was able to hop into a same-day appointment with really no issue.
17146,I'd recommend looking at locations in more rural areas (if you live in a city) because they're more likely to have extra (or at least less demand for) doses.
17147,"Even more impressive, the 60 to 55 and 55 to 50 drops were within two days of each other"

17152,The EU should have gotten off their bums and ordered more earlier.
17153,I‚Äôm pretty sure that is the case in FL now.
17154,Not sure if it‚Äôs been like that the whole time or not.
17155,I travel to Florida on business sometimes (even recently) but don‚Äôt live there.
17156,None of the vaccines are approved for under 16 yet.
17157,My mom got the first Pfizer dose last week and all she had was a sore arm.
17158,However the second shot is apparently a lot worse with side effects.

17161,Not really.
17162,Smart people have spent a year avoiding normal life so they wouldn't get or spread COVID.
17163,A few weeks more to get the better vaccine isn't a mental illness.
17164,It's just someone being smart.
17165,When they ask to see your driver's license you are gonna be screwed.
17166,So what are you arguing?
17167,We are delaying the dosing intervals for AstraZeneca too.
17168,Are you ok with that?
17169,I LITERALLY gave you data from the UK and Canadian experts regarding delaying Pfizer.
17170,Can you read?
17171,Tennessee opened to high risk 16+ this week.
17172,The list of high risk conditions is broad and the pharmacy where my husband got his shot didn‚Äôt even ask which phase he was in.
17173,He has some very mild hypertension which was enough to qualify him.
17174,Unfortunately I think so of this is because a lot of people in the earlier phases are just not getting it but a lot of my friends and family were able to get their first doses this week so I was thankful for that.
17175,What's going on in April?
17176,"This is getting really nuanced and nitty gritty, but, if you're an American, it's still an advantage (from a personal perspective) as a single dose regiment for Pfizer/Moderna has not been approved."
17177,"Leaving efficacies at the door (because they are irrelevant to the point I'm making), you're not ""fully vaccinated"" with a single dose of Moderna so all guidelines and regulations regarding what ""fully vaccinated"" people can do are not applicable to you."
17178,"If they roll out vaccine passports three months from now and you're sporting a single Moderna shot for whatever reason, you're not getting on that plane unless the FDA approves a single dose regimen, which is unlikely as Moderna hasn't applied for it as far as I am aware."
17179,"So when NPR or CNN or whoever say it's an advantage that it's one shot, they're not wrong."
17180,&gt;My point is that I don't like how one's immediately critisized if one points that out.
17181,You're not as long as you give it it's proper due.
17182,"And what actually gets you in hot water (notice how you're at positive points) is when you say something like ""I'm not getting that shit J&amp;J vaccine."""
17183,People rarely talk about the reduced efficacy without the implication that it's a bad vaccine.
17184,In Florida or Texas?
17185,That is true in Texas
17186,"So you aren't an American, not in America and don't read/follow news but you can make broad strokes stereotyping people as conspiracy loonies?"
17187,"To rephrase you: ""All X are *Insert Strawman* I hate"" then ""I know zero about X and *Inserted strawman* but I'm going to flap my gums about it""

I get that correct?"
17188,Yay lets gooooooooo AK (got my 2nd dose early Feb).
17189,"It was the only death ever linked to the rally, I‚Äôm not misrepresenting data."
17190,At least she‚Äôs giving you the month of April off.
17191,"No, only for the purpose of getting international travel back for the time being."
17192,"You can just say ""yah I was wrong, I didn't know we closed schools for swine flu anytime someone was infected until they figured out it wasn't that bad""."
17193,"Look, swine flu is primarily a respiratory disease, like all other flus."
17194,"We've known covid-19 is a systemic disease, and unlike other coronaviruses, for a long time."
17195,"More than a year ago, doctors were saying holy shit this thing doesn't act anything like what we expect."
17196,And it hasn't gotten that much better!
17197,Seems like all the effort is just on keeping people alive.
17198,"Great job on figuring out steroids work and people need to lay on their stomachs and all the other observational shit about what seems to work and what doesnt, but that doesn't mean it's now ""just the flu bro""."
17199,Brain infection just isnt that rare with this thing.
17200,Losing smell and having brain fog are like the number one symptoms.
17201,"How does that not scare you, especially if it's your kid we are talking about?"
17202,People shrug off potentially incurring a much higher chance of having all sorts of neurological issues later in life because you had covid when you were 10.
17203,"Unless I‚Äôm mistaken though those cities are not allowed to enforce those mandates with fines or arrest, so they‚Äôre kind of toothless"

17225,The point was laid out clearly and I didn't mislead anyone.
17226,You are starting a new discussion about efficacy in preventing severe disease and JnJ POTENTIALLY being a two dose vaccine as well.
17227,Not what I was talking about at all and does not have anything to do with my point.
17228,"Interesting things to talk about, but not a response to my point."
17229,It would be a good argument in defense of JnJ if I had called it a bad vaccine.
17230,I hadn't.
17231,I was talking about its one dose regimen being presented as an advantage and I explained how it's absolutely not and how it's a trade-off.
17232,"Well no, Florida never had a state-wide mandate but they allowed individual cities to have their own."

17241,They have both of their vaccines already.
17242,Hopefully my dad and I can convince her.
17243,I disagree.
17244,Many people who get M/P are not going to want to wait 2 weeks to do things when they compare the level of protection they have the day they get the second shot to the protection offered two weeks after JnJ  Don't lie to people if you want them to listen.
17245,The headline is misleading.
17246,[removed]
17247,I have a question for you.
17248,Any idea why healthcare professionals are against the vaccine?
17249,Our major local hospital offered vaccines to all staff and only 59% got one.
17250,Why???
17251,It‚Äôs baffling to me.
17252,Yeah cause they got the new cowboys practice stadium and a new skyline going.
17253,Lol  you obviously have more feeling invested then me I give two fucks so have a nice one.
17254,The pain for me isnt that bad.
17255,Its just like having a bruise.
17256,You will be ok.
17257,You want vaccine passes for domestic travel and daily life activities?
17258,This opens the door for government to have access and the right to view  health information
17259,"From what I read, last Wednesday they did lift some restrictions for those Americans who are vaccinated."
17260,Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't this show that the vaccines are helping suppress the symptoms and not eliminate the spread?
17261,I've been sent down the leaky vaccine rabbit hole recently and I've been hoping that fully vaccinated people wouldn't be able to contract covid thus eliminating the possibility of leaky vaccine.
17262,If it‚Äôs so ‚Äúcrappy‚Äù then why does the EU keep having tantrums about not getting enough of it?

17280,Focusing on a single days numbers is not super useful since reporting is nowhere near perfect.
17281,I could take days for a person to be reported as receiving a vaccine while distribution numbers might get reported faster or even slower.
17282,"Look at everything as a whole, where the CDC says they have distributed 120 million and given 90 million."
17283,Seems perfectly reasonable to me with some vaccines being held to make sure we don't run into supply decreases and can give second doses on time

17325,This [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56339188) hasa pretty good breakdown on it.
17326,Regarding the UK it is probably not a classic export ban but more of a condition in the contract with the manufacturers that the first x million doses produced in the UK should go to the UK.
17327,"In any case, there have not been any exports from UK to EU, but there have been the other way around."
17328,"Now I am not saying that the UK shouldn't do this and I think EU was naive not to negotiate a similar contract, but reproaching the EU of protectionism / vaccine nationalism is hypocritical."
17329,Doses aren‚Äôt being ‚Äúsent‚Äù to the UK.
17330,"They are being produced *in* the UK, using plants paid for by the UK government."
17331,"In exchange for this funding, their contract with Astra Zeneca stipulates that the first 100 million doses must be set aside for UK residents."
17332,Hot take.
17333,"Explain to me in what universe it makes sense for the hardest hit country in the world, with the highest number of infections, and highest number of deaths... to begin exporting vaccines before they have enough to stem the tide?"
17334,"It's an increase from 0.25% to 0.41% among people diagnosed through community testing as opposed to in hospital (so a lower risk cohort, hence the relatively low IFR)."
17335,The headline literally uses the word ‚Äútreatment‚Äù which implies its use on patients that already have the disease.
17336,"Don‚Äôt see how this is misleading at all, but perhaps the use of the phrase ‚Äúhospitalized patients‚Äù would have been slightly better as that is what they actually said."
17337,"If you are sick enough to put in the hospital, this treatment is not of much use - you have already fallen off the cliff."

17408,I‚Äôm sure California has a lot of essential workers in the agriculture industry that are undocumented.
17409,I know some undocumented immigrants that are refusing to get it and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of ID requirements.
17410,I‚Äôm not sure how they get around that unless they drop ID requirement.

17413,Thank god I don‚Äôt live out there then
17414,I do feel hopeful but I will keep wearing my mask for quite a while!
17415,Even though I‚Äôm vaccinated.
17416,I just feel icky not wearing a mask in public these days.
17417,But now I‚Äôm craving a burger so thanks a lot üòú
17418,Anyone have an idea of when would be an appropriate time to call pharmacies to see if they have leftover vaccines?
17419,[removed]
17420,Yeah I noticed that too.
17421,2 weeks to flatten the curve.
17422,Old people are vaccinated.
17423,There's a 0 percent change that hospitals will be overwhelmed now.
17424,This shit is over.
17425,I don't mind getting the sniffles for a few days.
17426,"Yup, most timelines in Canada have already moved to ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù case of 1st dose for everyone by June 20th (May 18th in some provinces), and then 2nd dose vaccinations begin after that."
17427,Two more weeks
17428,May I ask a doubt.
17429,Can someone help me.
17430,"AstraZeneca said their vaccine is ~60% effective if spaced 4 weeks apart, and ~80% effective if spaced 12 weeks apart."
17431,Yet it's ~72% effective after 90 days of a single dose according to pre-published results.
17432,How does this all add up?
17433,"My question is, if a single dose is effective 72% after 90 days, then why does a second dose drastically drop efficacy so much?"
17434,"In India's phase 3 tests, it dropped to around ~50%."
17435,"The problem is till now apart from studies, no government has mandated a gap of 12 weeks between doses."
17436,So I'm scared to ask my parents to wait for a greater time.
17437,"In the end, I only want them to be safe from hospitalization."
17438,I hope even the 2 doses spaced 1 month apart does that
17439,Congratulations!
17440,"Yes, this has work in our favor!"
17441,"The Native Corps were able to go through their tiers quicker, then expand to whole families (with at least one registered Alaskan Native), and then the general public to receive their extra doses."

17451,"In India's phase 3 tests, it dropped to around ~50%."
17452,oh yeah.
17453,there were some twitter posts as well (from her IG) where she was trying to justify the whole thing.

17455,oh well!
17456,"Don't be shy, show the per capita stats"
17457,"That's literally the point, you take first and give later."
17458,More for me
17459,"&gt;Doctors say a 69-year-old man died of COVID-19 last year after exhibiting a bizarre and extremely rare side effect of the disease, which they described as a three-hour erection."
17460,"&gt;The U.S. patient was suffering from priapism, which involves a persistent erection that outlasts or has nothing to do with sexual stimulation, according to the case report published in the January edition of the American Journal of Emergency Medicine."
17461,&gt;Experts took a look at the man and ran ultrasound scans.
17462,"They ultimately determined that he was suffering from ischemic priapism, an urgent and potentially dangerous condition during which blood cannot leave the penis."
17463,"The condition was likely triggered by a blood clot caused by COVID-19, according to the case report."
17464,Am I in a weird fever dream where it‚Äôs still 2009 and real human beings still talk like this?
17465,"&gt;They had a bit more rigorous data on the variants of concern

Oh, that's very very good thinking."
17466,"&gt;I'm in healthcare, so I'm in the first phases."
17467,"Oh, I see."
17468,Very important to get vaccinated then.
17469,"You'll really be able to breathe more easily (a saying in Serbian, don't know if you have it in English lol, means to worry less)."
17470,"Oh, I didn't know you guys got to choose your shot too."
17471,Here in Serbia we get to choose which one we want.
17472,"I signed up for Pfizer and Sputnik V, hoping to get vaccinated in the next week or so."
17473,Not remotely accurate.
17474,Federal retail program is going much worse than a lot of state programs.
17475,We saw this same thing with states that signed up for long term healthcare through local pharmacies or state programs verse federal retail programs.
17476,"The local and state programs were much quicker than the programs run by the feds and private businesses like cvs, rite aid, etc."
17477,Because the private market can‚Äôt hire tons of people for a program that barely makes them a profit or even can run a loss and is only gonna be largely temporary.
17478,I read an article yesterday in which some random doctor (I wish I remembered his name) was saying that now that vaccines are out that will give virus what it needs to mutate and bypass the vaccine protection so people getting vaccines is a bad idea.
17479,There will ALWAYS be people who insist on turning a good situation into a bad one even with illogical arguments.
17480,Because now you‚Äôre less likely to die.
17481,That doesn‚Äôt make it a reward.
17482,I'm in a major metropolitan area and the CVS and Walgreens here still don't have the vaccine.
17483,They have dozens upon dozens of locations in the city that could be distributing it and aren't.
17484,"Checking online, it looks like a third of the country still doesn't have regular retail pharmacies distributing."
17485,How this wasn't planned for and still hasn't been fixed is beyond my understanding.
17486,This is clearly a logistics and distribution problem.
17487,Appointments are still booked within minutes.
17488,Most if not all of those stores still enforce them.
17489,At least around DFW they do
17490,I mean...
17491,There's only like 10 people and a penguin living in Alaska.
17492,They have enough vaccines for everyone
17493,"Yeah normally my opinion would be from a public health standpoint instead of moralizing it, but we've known for a *year* that obese people need to lose weight or they are much, much more likely to have complications."
17494,"They've had a whole, freaking year to lose the weight."
17495,That's what I'm angry about.
17496,Good for them!
17497,Pandemic is over.
17498,Time to move on with life.
17499,Get folks back to work.
17500,Get our sanity back.
17501,The EU's actions don't factor into this at all.
17502,I am not even necessarily arguing that the UK should export vaccines to the EU.
17503,But why isn't the UK exporting to other countries?
17504,"Even though the EU botched the planning of vaccine production, or whatever you're arguing, they're *still* exporting vaccines to Canada."
17505,The UK did a better job with the vaccine production.
17506,"It has more vaccines per person, so it could export at least some of them to Canada."
17507,They don't.
17508,You know why?
17509,Because they're following the US in a UK-First strategy and made vaccine exports impossible.
17510,I‚Äôm not sure how that makes what I said incorrect.
17511,"For what ever reason a lower percentage of black people and Latinos are younger, that is still a lower number of eligible people when going by age."
17512,When showing the disparity people often look at the state‚Äôs overall demographic assuming it will hold true regardless of age which isn‚Äôt the case.
17513,"So if a state is 20% Hispanic and only 7% of those in the current 65+ phase are vaccinated thus far are Hispanic, is it hesitancy or should more factors be investigated?"
17514,It‚Äôs seems easier to say it‚Äôs all cultural than to admit there are some structural barriers that contribute to lower vaccination numbers.
17515,My 81 year old parents got their second shots in Ohio already a few weeks ago.
17516,Can't wait to get mine!
17517,[removed]
17518,"Right... but the higher price won‚Äôt be applied to doses already on order, and most countries who can afford to buy vaccines have already ordered two, three or four times as many doses as their own populations need."
17519,Just give it to CVS and charge like $10.
17520,Those doses will be gone in no time.
17521,Yeah and the media has been keeping shut about this to put a false front that covid is dying and we'll be out going to Blink 182 concerts maskless in the summer.

17525,I got my first Moderna shot 10 days ago.
17526,Questions!
17527,1) Is there any data about protection offered by one Moderna shot?
17528,Esp.
17529,at 14 days?
17530,"I *am* going to get the second shot, but I'm curious about whether there's evidence of protection before I get it."
17531,2) Should I be concerned that I didn't have any reaction to the shot?
17532,"Related to question 2: I've been taking ivermectin weekly since November, including a few hours after I was vaccinated (I took it because I was in the company of several dozen people at the vaccination site, with decent distancing *most* of the time but no noticeable ventilation)."
17533,3) Would a serologic test reveal whether the vaccine has had an effect?
17534,"If so, how long should I wait before trying to get the serological test?"
17535,Thanks VERY MUCH for your response(s)!
17536,"I think the fact that they're blatantly lying about the vaccine and pandemic trajectory (the EU rollout is slow, but now that slow) is worse than the actual policy itself."
17537,You and I both know Florida didn't have the largest death toll in the country.

17543,Nah
17544,"Don‚Äôt mean to be a downer, but I‚Äôm super worried about getting the second dose of Pfizer

I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last Saturday and while I felt fine that evening the next night I started to have heart palpitations and my heart was also racing."
17545,The day after that my body felt really worn out and there were small instances in which I had a fuzzy feeling in the left side of my face.
17546,"I‚Äôm just worried because I know the first dose is supposed to be the easy one whereas the second is the one that is rougher on the body, and I‚Äôm concerned about the effects it will have on my heart."
17547,"I‚Äôm not trying to dissuade people from getting the vaccine, just expressing my own experience so far."
17548,Has anyone else experienced similar side effects from the first dose?
17549,"Have you received the second one, yet?"
17550,I suspect thats where the Dollar General/Target/CVS announcements are coming from today - counties and states have realized they're maxing out on their administration and are starting to collect doses that they can't give as fast as needed.
17551,in my state they havent even gotten to normal people yet.
17552,if alaska is getting more vaccine per capita AND they are ahead of everyone else then they absolutely dont need more vaccine

17574,They don't ask for a verification of 1a/1b.

17597,Lol the plan worked.
17598,Got everyone scared shitless
17599,Jesus Christ lower the age limit across the board
17600,How many days after the second jab?
17601,From Israel's experience it looks like it takes 2 weeks after the second dose to develop full immunity
17602,NY lowered it to 60 today.
17603,And those businesses can't legally stop any maskless person from entering /s
17604,"It was 12 last year, I think we're down to 9"
17605,I just looked.
17606,The case rate has dropped 77% in the last 90 days.
17607,Hospitalizations have dropped 71% in the same timeframe.
17608,Finally
17609, &gt; I'm glad we're not doing the same in the EU.
17610,"Australia would like its 250,000 vaccines back in that case."

17615,"Exports are or have gone to 21 countries - including the US, UK, China, Japan, Canada and Australia."
17616,so much for that
17617,So I live in Texas and I signed up for my local county‚Äôs vaccine waitlist (Collin County).
17618,After a certain point the list was transferred over to an organization called the Curative Medical Association and last week I was given a code that allows me to schedule an appointment.
17619,Collin County also says they plan on finishing all vaccinations from that waitlist by the end of this week.
17620,"Thing is, I‚Äôm 25 and I have no underlying health conditions, meaning I don‚Äôt belong in either groups/phases currently getting vaccinated."
17621,Should I still try and schedule an appointment?
17622,"I can‚Äôt imagine every person on that list qualified either (there was about 270,000 people who signed up)."
17623,Plot twist: she actually had a cough because of the common cold/s
17624,"&gt; The level of bureaucracy needed to screen out in eligible people on a tiered system is pretty high

Which is how you know people who support it don't actually believe in small government or any of that, they just want to punish people who don't ""deserve"" help."
17625,Guilty.
17626,Just because Fauci says wear a mask when gathered with the unvaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to when a couple people are over the house.
17627,"So yeah, totally guilty for putting some aspects of life or ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù over prescriptive extreme risk avoidance."
17628,I know in Ohio they are prepping a bunch of big vaccination centers that will open next week.
17629,"The age gets lowered to 50 on thursday and, my assumption is next week it'll drop again once all of these centers are opened."
17630,"It's not that hard to get an appointment, at least in columbus."
17631,"In the colder states 6 inches of snow is an inconvenience, not an emergency."

17633,When they hell are we gonna see lower age limits?
17634,Or maybe offer Canadian seniors the vaccine.
17635,"While I agree with your sentiment the issue is those obese folks can catch COVID and will very likely need to be intubated if they have a severe case, that will lead to hospitals overflowing causing a repeat of 2020."
17636,We need to avoid that so the people with pre existing conditions have to be vaccinated first.
17637,"3 in 5 voters located in New York, Maryland, azul states, etc."
17638,"It's about 1 in 100 for the rojo states of Texas, California, Tennessee, Florida, etc."
17639,/s
17640,&gt; Is COVID not as bad ad the media portrays?
17641,Not even close to as bad as the media portrays.
17642,"&gt; Or are these people just insane, and a bunch of them are going to die?"
17643,Do they not care?
17644,"I keep seeing huge gatherings like this, and no mask mandates, and things fully open the entire time."
17645,They don't care about the minimal level of risk of getting sick living their lives.
17646,They're not insane.
17647,&gt; In Toronto we have been in lockdown for 5 months now.
17648,"We are literally acting in opposite ways, so I an genuinely curious what it is like in Florida?"
17649,Free.
17650,Life is normal other than mask wearing in some places.
17651,There's no better place on the planet to be right now.
17652,fewer Texans in 14-21 days
17653,Sorry - Novavax.
17654,Oxford is a viral vector vaccine right?
17655,Those are also quite a bit newer than protein subunit vaccines.
17656,A lot of people say ‚Äúthe research started a long time ago‚Äù and that‚Äôs true but in comparison to protein subunit vaccines they‚Äôve been in way fewer arms
17657,"No, *you* can stay home if cases start to rise."
17658,"With vaccination well under way, there‚Äôs no reason to continue lockdowns."
17659,Because covid outcompeted the flu.
17660,Just like when there's a new flu strain the old ones often disappear never to be seen again.
17661,Cool.
17662,Thanks for the additional explanation.
17663,Agreed on points A and B as well.
17664,Hiring someone to UN-count deaths ALRRADY certified and trickle the remaining ones back into the numbers often a month or more after they were reported to the state is a long way to go to allow clueless internet pundits to tout fake numbers.
17665,...  though likely still not as fake as his other trick of purposefully miscalculatimg the positivity rate so that someone who takes 20 tests and is positive 100% of the time officially counts as a 5% positivity.
17666,"So long as you don't care about being lied to or the implications for public health of sharing fake numbers and imprisoning those who share the truth, then we're doing great."
17667,...  or not.
17668,There's no way to tell with him going so far out of his way to consistently hide the data.
17669,"Agree, guess I should have said ""before"" instead of ""in"" January 2020."
17670,Wow another horrible day for California vaccinations.
17671,I do wonder if it‚Äôs that we are hitting a plateau and that‚Äôs why our numbers have been so low.
17672,Hopefully in a few days when more people are eligible the numbers go back up.
17673,What are you even talking about?
17674,Why are you bringing up bats?
17675,What does that even have to....oooooh.

17681,I don't believe in your old man's Facebook feed giving you all your information.
17682,"If you want to discuss facts, we can."
17683,"If you want to discuss Fox News articles and random DailyMail 'truths,' then you're best spending your time elsewhere, like searching where to buy more bottles of bleach to drink since we all know you don't want the microchip the vaccine has in it."

17696,"Your first comment:

&gt; are you saying that the outcome was inevitable, that no matter whether there were masks or restrictions or not that **everything** after march 2020 was predetermined?"
17697,‚ÄúEverything‚Äù after march 2020 is an entirely different context than ‚Äúwhat caused the pandemic to be prolonged‚Äù.
17698,"‚ÄúEverything‚Äù includes mortality rates, mental health issues, vaccine development, etc."

17770,Or is this in the last 24 hours?
17771,I guess a good question is whether it is an administration capacity issue (not enough openings provided) or an administration filling issue (lots of unused openings)?
17772,"I don‚Äôt know the answer, could be both depending on area as well."
17773,I think it's somewhat predictable that there would be a lag between the dramatic manufacturing acceleration and a proportional administration acceleration.

17797,"The Oxford vax losing efficacy when given the booster prematurely DOES make sense, given the effect of vector resistance."

17959,"You do realize that people are stupid and have been not following the mask mandate as soon as they realized they wouldn't have to, right?"
17960,The only reason that there is no ban currently in the UK is that AZ committed to fulfill their UK contract first from their UK supply chain.
17961,It‚Äôs reasonable to believe that a ban would be considered if AZ decided to send ‚ÄúUK‚Äù doses to Germany (Just as an example).
17962,"There was no export license requirements in the EU either, before AZ axed the EU deliveries."
17963,"Funny, lets deduce your point then as you're clearly incapable of doing it yourself."
17964,Your first point states that the situation is clearly not good because she has been hospitalized.
17965,This point is mute because a small fall can hospitalize an elderly person and isn't a major sign of something super serious.
17966,Your follow up comment states the vaccine should stop old people from collapsing and other comments suggest you think she was tested for covid after being administrated to the hospital.
17967,This is proof your entire argument is based on the title and you've not actually read the article as she was diagnosed with covid 6 days after the collapse which you'd know if you read the first paragraph of the article.
17968,It never states what the cause of collapse is so any comment you have on that is your opinion and not based in anything factual.
17969,"It could of been covid related, it might not have been."
17970,We don't know as it's not stated.
17971,So the idea that the vaccine should of stopped this is just speculation based on nothing.
17972,So your second point is also mute.
17973,The only facts we have are she was hospitalized and since being in hospital has shown signs of minor symptoms after a positive test with nothing appearing to be life threatening.
17974,Have a nice day.
17975,FYI: resorting to insults just makes your position look weak.
17976,It's worth pointing out that part of the Pfizer vaccine production line in the EU depends on a component from the UK.
17977,Which it freely allows to be delivered to Belgium.
17978,This is why the EU backs off every time the UK calls the EU out and is also why they will never stop a delivery of Pfizer being delivered to the UK.

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms."

18167,We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread.
18168,Why?
18169,"We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well."
18170,In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus.

18234,Many businesses are still keeping their mask policy.
18235,"I saw a new webpage and I think this gives more clarity:

[When You‚Äôve Been Fully Vaccinated | CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) 

&gt;What‚Äôs Changed  
&gt;  
&gt;If you‚Äôve been fully vaccinated:  
&gt;  
&gt;You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask."
18236,"&gt;  
&gt;You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks, unless **any** of **those people** **or anyone they live with** has an [increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)."
18237,"&gt;  
&gt;If you‚Äôve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms."
18238,"&gt;  
&gt;However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don‚Äôt have symptoms."
18239,"So again, I'm not an expert and I don't know the answer for sure, but I think the CDC is saying:

1."
18240,"Your fully vaccinated husband can visit with fully vaccinated people, without precautions."
18241,2.
18242,"Your fully vaccinated husband can't visit with a single unvaccinated household with low risk members without precautions, because he lives with you, and you are not low risk (pregnancy)."

18247,Didn't they remove their sponsorship from Sturgis last year?
18248,Interesting.
18249,If it reduces the incubation time it will be easier to control and do tracing.
18250,Do you know if it has brought down the average incubation period which previously was 5.1 days since infection.
18251,"Intriguing, I wonder what data they saw to support the one shot method."
18252,I know there have been some advocating that the 2nd probably isn‚Äôt necessary but didn‚Äôt seem like enough data from my research to make that public policy.
18253,[removed]
18254,You hit the nail on the head there with pre-symptomatic spread.
18255,It is entirely in the realm of possible for any virus to mutate both to be more transmissible and deadlier.
18256,It can also happen as separate steps in the mutation cycle.
18257,Your hope is that a less deadlier variant spreads much faster and thereby builds immunity within the community before a deadlier variant gets a chance.
18258,Very misleading headline.
18259,This clearly reflects nothing more than the artificially low case count during the deep freeze fading out from the rolling 2 week average.
18260,"Per the NYT tracker, yesterday's case count was down to 5,409 vs. the prior Tuesday's 7,240."
18261,We still don‚Äôt have enough supply.
18262,"Nope, it's one of those figures that includes individual governments."
18263,&gt; Because Texas was the first major state to announce it.
18264,No.
18265,They were the first major state that had one recently and then rescinded it recently.

18276,The mRNA vaccines were the only option until last week.
18277,Everyone rich and poor who has been vaccinated has gotten one.
18278,The J&amp;J vaccine is being targeted at more rural areas especially (but not exclusively) which tend to be lower income.
18279,But that has to do with storage transport and preparation.
18280,Not class.
18281,Yeah.
18282,To be fair to you guys so far we've only had hospitals and designated government mass vaccination sites running so far because our supply has been much lower.

18292,do you have a source showing some dramatic effectiveness immediately after one shot?
18293,Thats all very nice and I'm not denying that the UK doesn't have an **official** ban.
18294,Even the US doesn't have an official ban.
18295,They have an executive order that forces pharmaceutical companies to prioritise American citizens.
18296,"But in the real world we are living in, where Pfizer did not airlift any factories to the UK, nor is it planning to."
18297,"Exports from any actual, non-theoretical, vaccines are not allowed."

18307,"Yes, it is."
18308,Might j&amp;j be ok under 16?
18309,Do.se.have under 16 doses covered?
18310,Or as said donate them close by if oversupply.
18311,"Only because that was a condition of the UK for them, not because of their golden heart."
18312,"For 99+% of people, yes, but there is a percentage who last longer than that."
18313,Even if the entire world did a true lockdown for 3 weeks last year this still wouldn't be over.
18314,Mask Be Upon Him
18315,lol she literally collapsed and had to be hospitalized.
18316,doesn‚Äôt sound that mild to me.
18317,...what the hell?
18318,I'm also Serbian and this is pretty ridiculous.
18319,"Sharing a graph with the percentage of people fully vaccinated which happens to show Serbia in a good light for once means ""having an agenda""???"
18320,The acquisition and distribution of vaccines is literally the one and only good thing our corrupt and criminal administration has done.
18321,And this graph is nonbiased.
18322,"Yes, efficacy is high after even a single dose of most vaccines, but we still consider a person to be fully vaccinated after 2 doses."
18323,And yet the CDC is now saying that fully vaccinated individuals can gather together at homes with other fully vaccinated individuals two weeks after their second dose and two weeks after their one dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.Unless one of the fully vaccinated individuals is high risk.
18324,[removed]
18325,"While they're there, the rest of us can erect a fence around Florida and declare it an international dipshit refuge."
18326,Time to open the vaccines to everyone over 16 now and stop it with the dumb groups and categorizations.

18328,"&gt;	Good ~~job!~~

Good *jab*!"
18329,False.
18330,"Gotcha, yeah I think there is no global list like this here so it‚Äôs up to people signing up for lists in pharmacies or hospitals and what not."
18331,Still preference for those in current groups or next groups but it‚Äôs always better to stick someone than no one.
18332,"This is the difference between having a national health service and not, realistically."
18333,Canada is a failure of a country.
18334,They‚Äôre giving half doses with the second dose not available until at least 4 months later.
18335,Absolutely sickening.
18336,We‚Äôll be the reason for the world having some weird COVID variant that is susceptible to people without booster shots.

18338,It was one of Trumps executive orders that Biden has kept.

18340,Because Texas was the first major state to announce it.

18342,So naturally the media is going to stick with this story.
18343,I haven‚Äôt noticed any significant changes.
18344,Everyone is still wearing masks.
18345,Retailers are still requiring masks.
18346,"About the only change I see is some increase attendance at the cinema, but still below the original capacity constraints."
18347,"And a busier Friday/Saturday night restaurants, but those were pretty packed before."
18348,Your production output is dependent on materials from some of these same countries.
18349,Who knows?
18350,Probably they were able to produce more vaccines than expected.
18351,"Nothing weird, considering they are expanding capacity and a new factory has recently opened in Germany."
18352,9 month = long term?
18353,&gt; The us blocked contracts from being full filled in Canada.
18354,No.
18355,False.
18356,The article says her mother is doing well and not on oxygen.
18357,That's a good sign that the vaccine is offering protection against severe cases.
18358,So LeBron is apparently wishy washy about getting the vaccine and then Stephen A Smith says on his show that he (SAS) is getting the vaccine while mentioning LeBron but doesn‚Äôt try to talk about how bad of messaging it is about one of the more famous African Americans not wanting to take the vaccine and how that can resonate more than SAS getting it.
18359,There's confidence in knowing that 60% of the population has a brain
18360,"The subreddit seems divided between people that think every person over 50 should get the opportunity to refuse the vaccine before frontline workers can get it at all, and people with common sense."

18363,"Yeah, I should have said ""State"" instead of county."
18364,What about when 6 people show up?
18365,That‚Äôs realistically what they are doing in these places as well.
18366,The waitlist is when people no show.
18367,Which happens everyday.
18368,Just like they overbook flights because people no show for flights everyday.
18369,The waitlist will obviously be preference for those who are in current groups but from what I gather that doesn‚Äôt always work out.
18370,Close the border!
18371,we as a world need to scrape some Pfizer together and send the UN in and start stabbing.
18372,I don't trust their government to give it to them that way.
18373,We need to put pressure on the virus and not allow it to mutate even further
18374,"Sounds very cool, but out of a population of over 30 million, they'll hopefully have more traditional means of transportation for these vaccines too."
18375,The drones would apparently account for 2 - 3 million doses over the next year.
18376,Encouraging for the hard-to-reach locations but we're Ghana have to do more - though of course if you vaccinate the most vulnerable 10% of the population that's still a great achievement.

""Back to normalcy once the elderly and at-risk are vaccinated""

18388,I'm sick of moving goalposts.
18389,Good stuff.
18390,Wondering if anybody can clarify: they say they are quite confident that it covers all strains (variants) in the US but then say they are studying an additional treatment for Brazil and SA variants.
18391,"Do you all interpret this as it should work against them, but not quite as well (similar to the general consensus on vaccines), or are they saying it works against the dominant and soon-to-be-dominant variants in the US, but not Brazil and SA (though they are technically in the US as well)."
18392,Thanks!
18393,"No, the EU are not blocking Pfizer as they are delivering what they are promised, in fact they just offered another 4 million to the EU."
18394,Why should the EU block Pfizer when we are getting every single dose we have ordered?
18395,Thank you!
18396,Avoid off topic political comments.
18397,The us is basically manufacturing for j&amp;j now through Merk.
18398,I can assure you the EU won‚Äôt be getting any of those doses until the us is sure they have enough themselves.
18399,"Mask mandates (outside of medical facilities, of course) have only one singular purpose, to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed."
18400,The threat to hospitals had been diminishing for weeks now due to the vaccinations.
18401,I stand corrected.
18402,"Those 200 million will not catch it at the same time, the same way that 330 million Americans did not catch the virus last year even though there were no vaccines a very little natural immunity."
18403,"Saying that those 200 million people did not caught it is insane, if that were true everyone in places like here in Mexico or Brazil with barely any restrictions would‚Äôve already caught the virus and would have herd immunity."
18404,Plus you forget that many people will still take individual precautions.
18405,&gt; That‚Äôs wrong.
18406,Low risk can still suffer severe disease.
18407,It‚Äôs unpredictable who the virus will effect and who it won‚Äôt.
18408,"There would still be enough folks getting severely sick to overload hospitals, worse than what we saw at the peak of things this last winter."
18409,That is true from an individual level.
18410,From a policy making level we do know by now around what percentage of people across different age levels will go to the hospitals and how many will die.
18411,Big government is the new small government
18412,No vaccines should be exported until every EU citizen that wants to be vaccinated gets both doses.
18413,"But the messaging is roughly the same: After roughly two weeks after the second dose, you're fine."
18414,"But yes, honestly the only messaging that makes sense is ""Two weeks after your second dose the virus does not present a danger to you anymore than other illnesses do to people vaccinated against those pathogens."""
18415,"Yesterday, Spain had already received 1.169.800 doses, and had used 689.136 (roughly 60%)."
18416,"[(source)](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Informe_GIV_comunicacion_20210309.pdf)  After a sluggish start, they are catching up and soon they will be using doses within the same week they are received."
18417,I do not see why the urge.
18418,"The doses are being used to vaccinate colectives highly exposed, which may help to control de spread of the desease."
18419,"IMO, at this point, there is a legitimate debate about whether it is best to focus all the efforts on elder, or whether it is more effective targeting certain vectors of transmission."
18420,They start to be effective ~10-12 days after the first shot.
18421,This is just saying they don‚Äôt reach peak effectiveness until 15 days after the second
18422,"I understand why Native Americans get prioritized, but can‚Äôt fathom why killing people should be rewarded with more access to life saving vaccines."
18423,Seems ironic?

18487,My entire family (mostly elderly) is in Germany.
18488,None of them have received a shot yet.
18489,"My 80 year old great uncle is eligible so I guess he doesn't count, but due to a surgery he hasn't been able to get it."
18490,Contrast that with here in the US.
18491,Every single eligible person I know has gotten at least their first shot.
18492,"Of course most everyone I know/hang out with is either old, a doctor, or a teacher."
18493,Hopefully getting the vaccine doses into the hands of the Hausarzte will help.
18494,"Have you read the news, they are delivering ahead of schedule and still increasing production."
18495,[removed]
18496,"The us also has so many vaccines because of vaccines (Moderna, J&amp;J,  soon to be Novavax) developed by AMERICAN COMPANIES funded by AMERICAN TAX MONEY."
18497,"European leaders failed to hedge properly, negotiate good contracts, etc."
18498,and it‚Äôs showing.
18499,Stop blaming the us for your problems.
18500,"It's largely health professional leadership that's making those decisions on a state level, it's not at all politicians in washington deciding who gets the vaccines."
18501,"No, it stupidly got flamed by people who are just angry and bitter that some people have things they don't have."
18502,Setting up in a clubhouse of a gated community of old people (only giving shots to those 65+) is awesome.
18503,You immediately reach a bunch of people who at risk with little cost and expense.
18504,Expecting that the state will then somehow ask nurses to drag their shit to every house in the state because there might be an old person there is ridiculous.
18505,Eligibility requirements are going to drop a whole lot faster than what people are expecting.
18506,Supply constraints will give way to administration constraints in the next 3 weeks if I had to guess.
18507,Manufacturers are ramping up capacity and the FDA is laser focused on the facilities that are coming on line.

18510,My point is the mixed messages from different sources isn‚Äôt going to help people‚Äôs confidence in the process.
18511,Isn't this what WHO is complaining about ... vaccine hoarding by rich countries
18512,Proud to be a young person thats vaccinated.
18513,Glad my state understands the value of essential workers instead of focusing solely on the elderly.
18514,"There were 7,000 vaccinated healthcare workers and 15,000 others at the game, I believe"
18515,It seems like EU was too concerned about costs earlier on.
18516,People haggling over a few euros in the midst of a pandemic.
18517,Better too have too many doses than too few.
18518,Easy to have them sent to other countries if you end up not needing the vials.
18519,General population is definitely getting ‚Äústuck with‚Äù the J&amp;J
18520,We‚Äôre having issues getting vaccinators here.
18521,We have all the support staff spots filled though.
18522,My personal theory is this: people who are able to vaccinate are already people who have been vaccinated by this point.
18523,"Whereas those who are filling up the support staff positions are people who are trying to get vaccines by volunteering, so those spots are super sought after by the general public."
18524,They need to start offering incentives for the people who vaccinate to fix this
18525,I think it‚Äôs time to open up vaccination to everyone.
18526,Soon we‚Äôre going to be swimming in so many doses (and arguably already are) it‚Äôll be illogical to reduce the eligibility age by 5 or 10 every few weeks.
18527,The US media has blown Covid completely out of proportion.
18528,"I used to think it was dangerous, but there were a lot of protests going on last summer that did not result in a huge spike in cases and deaths."
18529,"During that time even some public health experts completely flipped their stance and went from saying, ‚ÄúStay inside, don‚Äôt go anywhere!‚Äù, to ‚ÄúGo out and protest!‚Äù  That‚Äôs when I knew that all these lockdowns and stay at home orders were just a bunch of bullshit."
18530,Good jorb!
18531,&gt;Are you going to donate your entire stimulus check?
18532,Nope....I'm going to invest it into the economy.
18533,"But I'm also not on Reddit throwing a temper tantrum because some single mother making 30k is getting a full check and I'm not even though ""I pay more taxes""."
18534,Most people making the argument that too many people are getting it are just salty that their income is too high to qualify.
18535,I'm sure if you were getting a check then you wouldn't care how many other people were getting it as well.
18536,People like you come off as cry babies who are jealous of those in lower financial brackets so its pretty hard to take your POV seriously.
18537,I suspect many countries will use IATA Travel Pass
18538,"I feel super hopeful too (and a little bullet proof, I‚Äôll admit!)"
18539,after getting the vaccine.
18540,I didn‚Äôt realize that I was pretty anxious all the time until I started to feel Hope again
18541,J&amp;J getting a lot of bad press and people talking about it like it's second rate.
18542,Those people are the new anti-maskers from my POV.
18543,I think the vaccine is unnecessary.
18544,Safe?
18545,Most likely.
18546,Prevent suffering and save lives?
18547,Maybe.
18548,You wish to boil things down to binary yes/no good/bad.
18549,Life is not binary and response to risk is not binary.
18550,"For example, you think the only discussion relevant here is the vaccine."
18551,"You do this because you think it gives you a superior argument, not because it's actually the only thing relevant."
18552,"If I had a safe and effective vaccine to deaths by milk jug drownings, do you think it would be relevant to discuss the number of deaths and vulnerability to milk jug drownings?"
18553,"Of course it would, it would be asinine to put everyone through a vaccine for something that might happen to only 2 people a year, no matter how safe and effective it is."
18554,"If you are unwilling to discuss the role the covid response measures have had in comparison to the damage covid itself has done, then there is no discussion you be had."
18555,No matter how safe and effective the vaccine may be.
18556,If wearing a mask is a life ruining experience for you I dunno what to tell ya.
18557,Why does this sub have one post daily that goes to at least 20k upvotes while the rest of the posts struggle to get more than 500 upvotes?
18558,"If ""enjoying being a jerk"" isn't a mental illness, it should be."
18559,Interesting.
18560,And Blackhawks fans!
18561,Most of the risky people going to this have probably had covid by now.
18562,Also hopefully some are fully vaccinated.
18563,Biontech will deliver 4 million on top of what they already have promised.
18564,Does not seem like they are currently having any issues.
18565,Where do you see that it's meaningfully spreading in the US?
18566,It seems very likely that it's gotten here too late to cause a true surge.
18567,"Also, it's not that the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines are not at ALL effective against the SA variant, it's that they're not AS effective against them relative the other strains."
18568,"That's an important difference, and studies are being done now to figure out exactly how much the effectiveness is diminished against that strain."
18569,"Not to mention, J&amp;J still seems to work against it, and Moderna is working on boosters to allow for variants."
18570,"There is still every reason to believe that the active pandemic will be behind us sooner rather than later, SA variant or not."
18571,Yeah it‚Äôs just common courtesy at this point.
18572,Better to have extra than to not have enough.
18573,"If all goes well, we can give the spare doses to other countries."
18574,No we won't .
18575,We may get enough vaccines at that point to do that in theory  but our system of getting shots into arms is a mess .
18576,"i'd bet on the 2nd one being closer to being right but the actual right answer should be exponential, whatever growth rate goes from 0-50% in 14 days

(napkin math follows)

1.3224\^14 = 50 so starting at 1% effective you'd add 32% each day (1, 1.32, 1.74, 2.3, etc till you hit 50)

another way to look at it is you'd have to double about 5.5 times and using the rule of 72 you'd end up with somewhere in the vicinity of 30% growth rate"
18577,Why is it such a bad thing we now have a surplus of vaccines the next three quarters?
18578,Why do you think it‚Äôs so guaranteed that every single delivery will be on point for our first two vaccines?
18579,Yeah.
18580,I saw that!
18581,Even folks in Data/IT/Finance make the list.
18582,That combo pretty much covers me.
18583,In fact I can't think of a single person I know who doesn't fall under one of the categories in OK.
18584,They have.
18585,Just not enough.
18586,Seems like more is coming online soon though.
18587,I‚Äôm not rooting for the virus by any means but I certainly don‚Äôt want to go back to the office!!
18588,!
18589,Don't call it a fine.
18590,Call it a fee for the privilege of jumping the line.
18591,There was serious consideration of auctioning vaccine to people with greater means and converting the profits into admin and distribution capabilities of the vaccine to the at-risk.
18592,"It would destigmatize ""line jumping"" and also dissuade a black market of vaccine."
18593,I thought Pfizer was effective 7 days after the 2nd shot
18594,Are you going to donate your entire stimulus check?
18595,"""This isnt designed to pay your bills, its designed to help keep food on the table"" (That's a quote from you)

Then you say that you have no worries keeping food on the table."
18596,Sooooo.....why are you getting a stimulus check?
18597,That's everyone's point but you can only find empathy for one side.
18598,"(Yes I know it sounds radical to have empathy for someone with a high salary)

We can't claim our stimulus is to keep food on the table when a large percentage of people getting it will demonstrably use it for savings/frivolous purchases."
18599,That stuff is fine to drive the economy forward in the midst of the pandemic but the shit is over.
18600,"To me the chief problems are unpaid back rents, and service industry workers who have no been able to find other work/other jobs affected directly by covid."
18601,Your job doesn't sound like it changed much due to covid- neither did mine.
18602,"The stimulus is just a redistribution of taxes, so yeah I can see the point from the people who pay the highest percentage of taxes"
18603,That‚Äôs development though.
18604,"The US is not preventing anyone from manufacturing US developed J&amp;J, Moderna and (partially) Pfizer vaccines elsewhere."
18605,The restriction is purely on exporting doses manufactured in the US.
18606,Nursing home residents get sent out to hospital all the time.
18607,Also ‚Äúcollapsed and was hospitalized‚Äù but isn‚Äôt on oxygen at the hospital raises a flag for me that she could be in the hospital due to the collapse and not directly as a result of the COVID.
18608,Fall injuries are one of the top causes of hospital send outs in nursing homes.
18609,Was the Super Bowl wasn‚Äôt full capacity?
18610,Honest question ‚Äî I don‚Äôt follow sports.
18611,Theres nothing wrong with that
18612,I understand that the production of the lipidic capsule that contains the mRNA is very difficult (nanotechnology) and they could have encountered problems in scaling up the output to meet a massive demand.
18613,"since there is no mask mandate in texas anymore, austin can do whatever they want"
18614,"Yea, but like you said Florida has the exact same thing and it hasn‚Äôt resulted in any worse outcome than most of the states with mandates"
18615,That driver is so done with this shit
18616,Yeah it happens.
18617,Hopefully this is it for you.
18618,I had a friend whose father had mind symptoms and my friend went to get tested and he tested positive without any symptoms
18619,So will Alaska remove the pre-flight Covid test requirement soon?
18620,Maryland is far behind because it's effectively open to everyone now.
18621,"They're just prioritizing elderly, essential workers, people with health conditions in hospital or outpatient treatment and liars."
18622,"The commonly cited figure from Airfinity (I think that was its name) does not, as it would be only slightly higher than what the German and the French government alone have spent."
18623,I don't know about other figures but it's usually just that one that gets repeatedly cited all over reddit.
18624,"What's your source for claiming otherwise, then?"
18625,But it is relevant because some of y‚Äôall are acting like this is unprecedented and will result in bodies piled up the streets.
18626,That simply hasn‚Äôt happened in other states without mask mandates.
18627,Does that mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúmultiple threads get locked daily because people keep advocating throwing caltrops at motorcycles or running people off the road‚Äù season already?
18628,"Like fuck these mental giants for doing this dumb shit, but I remember people were arguing that they are basically enemy combatants."
18629,It was disgusting.

18640,I‚Äôve been trying to get a job as a vaccinator in my state and it‚Äôs been difficult!
18641,I would think it would be easy to find a place.
18642,Hoping it gets easier as more and more places open for administrating vaccines.
18643,Are you in the United States?
18644,New cases the past few days are lower than this time last week.
18645,"I mean just for perspective, US cases are down 86% over the last 60 days and they haven't nearly the per capita level of vaccination of Israel."
18646,"The EU didn't, international companies with international contracts did."
18647,Depending on where you are 80k for an individual could be a very good salary or a lousy one.

18650,Unless it serves Bibi somehow.
18651,Is there any way to see the J&amp;J efficacy data just for South Africa?
18652,The data from Israel and the UK (with literally millions of participants) show that the mRNA vaccines are much more effective than J&amp;J for the UK variant.
18653,"So the question becomes, how much of J&amp;Js poor results are from South Africa?"
18654,And how much is because it‚Äôs just a less effective vaccine overall.

18663,"Covid has caused a huge problem for fishermen and scientists who work in Alaska for stretches, but don't live there."
18664,They are also eligible for the vaccine right now.
18665,Which is good because they are often isolated in groups for stretches with limited medical access
18666,No.
18667,COVID is not living for long outside the body.

18674,"But 3 million to Canada and 2,5 to Mexico is crazy when they could just use the US production facilities."
18675,Show me on the doll where they touched you.
18676,I hate how much misinformation there is out there.
18677,"There are essentially zero risks  in any of these vaccines, other than mild flu-like symptoms (which means they are working as intended) for a short period of time."
18678,China is still trying to push the narrative that the virus was imported into Wuhan.
18679,The ‚Äúkicks in‚Äù is what makes this garbage.
18680,‚ÄúVaccine doesn‚Äôt reach peak effectiveness until weeks after second shot‚Äù would have been more accurate and still stupidly sensationalized.
18681,"How about ‚ÄúWhy we still need masks - Vaccine protects partially in days, fully 2 weeks after 2nd jab‚Äù?"
18682,"I suspect your right wing social contacts view Bolsonaro as a hero, and support his view of coronavirus as nothing more than a little flu."

18684,"Good for you guys, then."
18685,"A lot of other developed countries (most of them, in fact) aren't doing that well."
18686,Some will but most won't.
18687,Stores can't even really enforce these mask mandates(Too many people and often too dangerous).
18688,Encouraging these people who cannot be policed is why this is so dangerous.
18689,My labradoodle thinks so.
18690,I‚Äôd agree more if you said once it‚Äôs available to all adult Americans.
18691,We aren‚Äôt keeping all this in place to wait until kids can get the vaccine since that seems a year plus away for those under 12.
18692,Every adult should have it by mdw where restrictions get lifted.

18703,GA is one of the worst as far as the percentage of doses used and to me that‚Äôs one of the top indicators of success.
18704,People will argue all day long about who should be a priority but in the end shots need to be in arms.
18705,And GA is absolutely failing at that compared to other states.
18706,People are desperate to get the vaccine but can‚Äôt make appts because GA is doing such a poor job.
18707,They‚Äôve had since last July when vaccines were being tested to start coming up with a distribution plan and clearly their failing.
18708,People are rightly furious with Kemp
18709,"Well England data showed Pfizer to be 57-61% efficacious for preventing infection after 1 dose, which is the biggest sample size."
18710,"So it's actually better after 1 dose according to that trial, on par(ish) with 1 dose of AZ."
18711,People ignore and protest bad rules all the time.

18716,Damn i wish i lived there now ;-;
18717,Hmmm so it is the same as up here.
18718,"Just up here we have to lockdown until our hospital cases fall, (we did) then our ICU (we did), then when our RT value goes down (it has), THEN when all variants are gone."
18719,Apparently.
18720,They keep changing the reason to keep us in lockdown.
18721,To be fair we do have a shit ton of old people here...
18722,A politician not delivering what they promised?
18723,Inconceivable!
18724,Exactly.
18725,It should have been age and patient facing healthcare workers.
18726,"Otherwise, you get the mess some states are in by trying to work equity into an issue where the opposite side (the virus) doesn't care."
18727,"To get further on your point, lawyers in many states are considered essential."
18728,I guess because they have to go into jails to meet prisoners.
18729,I am lawyer and I never been in a jail to meet a client - ever (now bailing out friends is another story).
18730,I worked from home 80% of the time before COVID.
18731,"I can do Zoom, phones, etc."
18732,I am under 50 and okay shape (could stand to lose a few pounds like most lawyers).
18733,My chances of dying of COVID are minimal - like less than dying in a car accident.
18734,There is no reason at this point for me to jump the line in place some 72 year old woman (like my mom who is still trying to get vaccinated).
18735,"Early in the pandemic doctors got on tv and said they don‚Äôt work , the same people that now tell you to wear two."
18736,The whole messaging was fucked since the beginning.
18737,"My point is, we can and and should still wear masks and this crazy obsession over everything mask is nothing more than a red herring ."
18738,We know they work but it‚Äôs one piece in a much larger puzzle.
18739,Scientists have acknowledged that private gatherings have long propelled the problem.
18740,It's how you deliver it I suppose.
18741,"I still think ""hey, AZ failed us and were worried about deliveries around the world so we're going to increase their manufacturing capacity""."
18742,"But then I suppose that adds the question, why the fuck didn't you do that before?"
18743,"All in all, I do have to wonder, why didn't they do that before?"
18744,It feels like the Western countries have placed their eggs in too few baskets and tried to do it on the cheap.
18745,More worried about having wasted capacity than a speedy rollout.
18746,Hindsight is a wonderful thing though.

18753,"In fact though, the proposal in the study would have the cost at over a million per life saved."
18754,Which they tout as cheap.
18755,"But for a million dollar per life saved, there are better ways to spend that amount and save way more than 15,700 lives."
18756,The UK has had 2 serious months of lockdown.......
18757,"As opposed to Canada's plan to give everyone one shot first, Israel really doubled down on trying to fully vaccinate people."
18758,"Therefore, even though Israel is at  98.5 doses of vaccine per 100 people, they ""only"" have 55% of people with at least one shot."
18759,Their positivity rate is equal to the US' right- with only 18% getting one shot.
18760,"Also, I'm guessing the demographic making plans for a spring break in Cancun aren't the sort who care what the US Embassy has to say."
18761,"Just remember to keep up your normal precautions for at least two weeks (and ideally a week after the second dose) before starting to meet up with vaccinated people, etc."
18762,"- it takes about that long to really start working, according to the data."
18763,"No one said they were healthy, but it isn't life or death diseases they have."
18764,"They are locked up in their house though, haven't left since March 2020 because they don't have to."
18765,Their spread and likelihood of infection is close to zero.
18766,"Meanwhile, I am in a classroom with sick kids all day long."
18767,I could easily infect fifteen kids and all their parents by going to school before I get symptoms.
18768,"If you only had one dose, do you give it to the overweight thirty year old who doesn't leave their house or do you give it to someone who has reach into the community?"
18769,And now say I work in a supermarket or restaurant?
18770,My reach increases exponentially.
18771,I'd give it to the person working in the restaurant.
18772,It will do far more good.
18773,"I believe so but if we have to write news about the vaccines being in use that means the pandemic is still raging so by your definition, it‚Äôs not a good use of the flair

Do you see the flaw in that thinking?"
18774,"Austin choosing to require a mask is good news because, just like the vaccine, it is going to help stop the pandemic"
18775,"Looks like the feds will allocate about 9M Pfizer doses next week, up slightly from this week."
18776,"https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg

I thought Pfizer was aiming for something like 13M a week by mid-March?"
18777,Or am I misremembering?
18778,"Yup, ""September 11th Security Fee: 11.20 USD"" on a $200 flight."

18785,I described my frustration with the lack of guidance for people who live alone during this and my exhaustion with how mental health concerns seemed to be ignored by public health officials as I felt more and more tired and depressed over the course of the past year from not being able to socialize much (I live alone and work from home).
18786,"His response was ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt see people but why don‚Äôt you just do more zoom calls with your friends?‚Äù, as if my concerns were silly and small."

19080,"Starting 14 days after vaccination, there were 14 severe/critical cases in the vaccinated group versus 60 in the placebo group, and starting 28 days after vaccination, there were 5 severe/critical in the vaccine group versus 34 cases in the placebo group."
19081,"5 out of 66 hospitalized (severe or critical) isn't ""no one""."
19082,It's 7.5% of the cases.
19083,Let's hope they can meet their contracts.
19084,If not I am glad there is a backup plan and it's not the best thing maybe but I feel at east knowing that at least there is something there just in case.
19085,This is incredibly complicated.
19086,States all have different stages and timings and prioritization.
19087,Some states are behind and some are doing well.
19088,It is tough to say where each state should be.
19089,Also we are on an upward trajectory.
19090,Should some states be further along yeah probably.
19091,But opening it up to everyone right now would likely be a little much.
19092,It‚Äôs weird this post has so many fewer upvotes than all the bad news on this sub.
19093,This is a huge deal

19111,Sure!
19112,"I expect masks to be rare by summer, personally."
19113,"This is terribly 1 dimensional logic, it's assuming the only thing that matters in the world is whether people get the virus or not."

19125,"Let‚Äôs put it this way, if the oldies don‚Äôt want to get it or are just taking their sweet time, the dose sitting in a vial won‚Äôt help them, but a dose in their neighbor‚Äôs arm will help them as it‚Äôs one less person that will get them sick."
19126,thanks coach z
19127,It‚Äôs interesting that you are blasting their opinions - yet there is less than a year of data about the vaccine and its efficacy.
19128,There is only less than 4 months of real world data and like naturally derived antibodies- they have NO idea how long the ones spurned by the vaccine last either .
19129,That's how my my healthy 57 yr old mother got hers and my brother is signed up to volunteer in UT so he can get his.
19130,We are very excited that our 1 year old may soon be able to see people who aren't me or dad.

19133,"I was responding to your comment, not the comment above you."
19134,I quoted you so...
19135,There are multiple states removing their mask mandates and/or capacity limits every week.
19136,"Also, I visited the rural plains last summer."
19137,No one cares at all there.
19138,Technically they had some restrictions at the time but they weren‚Äôt being followed.
19139,I remember eating in a restaurant in North Dakota where social distancing wasn‚Äôt even a thing they bothered to consider.
19140,"I'm in VT (population of 623,989 as of 2019) and they've opened up to 16+ with comorbidities, so obviously not everyone, but they way they've been going I don't think it will take too much longer."
19141,I got ‚Äústuck with‚Äù j&amp;j vaccine yesterday and I‚Äôm happier than I‚Äôve been in weeks.
19142,It wasnt!
19143,The CT on my PCR test was very high (37) so the doctor recommended a retest which came back negative.
19144,Guess I was still just shedding virus lol.
19145,"Not sure if it had anything to do with the vaccine, because i've had negative tests in between getting my shot and the positive one."

19171,Poland and the Czech Republic are screwed.
19172,They screwed everyone financially through their half-assed virus mitigation measures and they are still in dire straights from the health crisis.
19173,I believe one (or both) of these countries will be the first to experience a revolution as a result of the pandemic.
19174,I would suggest stocking up on essentials if you live in those nations because the civil unrest and violence in a full blown revolution will hit hard and fast.
19175,Why would you do it for 35+ but not 20-35?
19176,The risk is for all intents and purposes the same for all those ages.
19177,It would be much more beneficial at that point to open to everyone so they can maximize throughout.
19178,Creating those arbitrary restrictions would be counterproductive.

19194,Still havent heard anything about EU suing AZ since the contracts were released either.
19195,"So the UK for once thinks ahead to this likely outcome, pays a private company to setup vaccine production facilities and gets it in writing that the first 100m that go out of those facilities goes to the UK."
19196,"The UK in all of this have not stopped pharma companies setting up production facilities in the UK, no export bans have been made (we even ship out some components for Pfizers vaccine to the EU) we are just getting what is contractually obligated to us from a private company."
19197,"The EU on the other hand set itself up as a vaccine hub that would be exporting globally, what it failed to do was look after its own citizens."
19198,Thats why you see Italy blocking exports of vaccines that other countries have paid for.
19199,"Contractually the UK is in the right, morally the UK has been one of the hardest hit countries in Europe and using the Italy argument that puts us in the right as well."
19200,Also we are actually using the vaccines being produced instead of storing them in a warehouse because of petty bureaucracy (Germany).
19201,"So yeah the EU can do one on all fronts, this is shit flinging to find a scapegoat for the poor performance of the EU vaccine commission."
19202,The UK makes a nice target after Brexit hence the amount of statements coming out of the EU government.

19221,"Id argue that with the traveling to different cities NBA players expose themselves more, and at the end of the day there is only 300 players, we probably throw out more doses than that."
19222,Pfizer and AZ are being administered in a one dose regimen in the UK and efficacy in preventing severe disease was 86% for Pfizer (identical to JnJ) and 94% for AZ.
19223,Even in that metric JnJ is not superior.
19224,"It's as good at best, inferior at worst."

19308,Nothing wrong with that.
19309,I never claimed or alluded to it being less.efficscious in preventing severe disease.
19310,"JnJ has 85% efficacy in preventing severe disease, which is also lower compared to the 4 vaccines I mentioned."
19311,It is withing the CI?
19312,Sure.

19318,Everything I said was factual and fair and complete.
19319,"As of right now, JnJ is being administered as a single dose vaccine."

19340,Your article doesn't dispute anything.
19341,Its specific in saying there were **at least** 86 cases in Minnesota 5 days after the rally and they admit a likely undercount because of the voluntary nature of the investigation.
19342,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations."
19343,"First, despite in-depth epidemiologic investigation, the findings represent an underestimate of the motorcycle rally‚Äôs impact in Minnesota and did not capture the impact within South Dakota or other states."
19344,"Case interviews were voluntary, and patients could choose not to respond to certain questions."
19345,Ten patients reported having close contacts but refused to disclose additional details regarding these contacts.
19346,"Therefore, it was not possible to identify all contacts of patients who attended the rally."
19347,"Second, attendees and their contacts might not have been tested for SARS-CoV-2."
19348,Two rally attendees indicated that their contacts had COVID-19‚Äìlike symptoms but did not plan to be tested.
19349,"As such, the findings underrepresent the number of cases, close contacts, and secondary and tertiary cases."
19350,"Finally, only 52 specimens were received at the MDH Public Health Laboratory because many testing laboratories do not retain or store specimens long-term."
19351,"Among these specimens, only 38 were successfully sequenced."
19352,The lack of whole genome sequencing data from all cases hindered establishment of complete genetic relatedness for epidemiologic investigation.
19353,Not count cases?
19354,That‚Äôs our trick!
19355,Unexpected deaths?
19356,"Heart attack, or aneurism- don‚Äôt even test for Covid, and, like magic, no Covid deaths!"

19363,"30 million vaccinations per month, not 60 million."

19627,I don't think it's that much different from other states even in our political beliefs.
19628,Those of us in bigger cities generally tend to vote blue and smaller towns tend to vote red which is the same thing that happens in most other states regardless of whether they end up red or blue.
19629,"Thing is, gentrification is a huge issue here which makes it hard for the growing number of blue voters to make as huge an impact as we deserve to make given our voting rights."
19630,"Short answer: all of them technically can still allow it,  none are 100 percent."
19631,Chances of it happening with any of the vaccines are much lower than if not vaccinated.

19648,I do think think there‚Äôs a lag between doses being labeled as distributed and doses actually arriving at their administration site.
19649,Doses are considered distributed when they are shipped to the state.
19650,"they still need to arrive at the state, be allocated to the vaccination site, sent to the site while appts are made and then administered."

19660,"And hopefully by then its less difficult to get the vaccine (in terms of searching for appointments) and more people will have gotten it, both of which may help her come around."
19661,Best of luck to you both.
19662,I hope she does end up getting it.
19663,"I mean, was there any doubt?"
19664,Partly because there was forced integration in the south.
19665,The north stayed largely segregated and still are.
19666,&gt;Disney's fiscal year ends in September.
19667,"So while the company was growing in revenue (55B, 59B, 69B) and then dropped to 65B for 2020, almost half a year of that 65B was pre-pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic will be much more apparent on 2021 fiscal reporting."
19668,"&gt;  
&gt;Net Income  went from 11B in 2019 to -2.8B in 2020, again though the bigger impact from the pandemic will be in 2021 reporting."
19669,It's not apples to apples either.
19670,Disney closed its acquisition of Fox in May 2019.
19671,Obviously a $71 billion deal is going to increase top line revenue.
19672,A mathematical model in some crap open access journal lmao.
19673,Stop posting fake news!
19674,"If the choice involves endangering other people‚Äôs health, then yes."
19675,I think they will build up a small surplus for those who had covid within the last 90 days and for the Children being able to get the vaccine so when they're able to get it they dont run into the issue now like the adults are.
19676,"But otherwise, yes I believe the USA will be one of the biggest helpers in the world once they're finished with their people."
19677,Exactly.
19678,"When I was hospitalized, I was bombarded with antibiotics."
19679,I had secondary infection that actually screwed me more than covid... Today (9 months later) did all sort of tests because I am worried if all those medicines screwed up my kidneys or liver.
19680,It sucks but perhaps that what saved my life back then
19681,Making a live virus therapy for billions instead of millions is a new manufacturing problem.
19682,Every two dose series only reaches peak efficacy after the second dose.
19683,The only variable is how long after the second dose.
19684,At what point is the UK variant not ‚Äúnew‚Äù anymore?
19685,Come on clickbait
19686,Our governor here in Texas is doing the same thing.
19687,I keep urging people to sign up in rural counties where you can sometimes get a vaccine within days.
19688,"Hmm, AD says something different."
19689,"There are 4 million extra doses being ordered, but also that the extra doses next week is just a result of Pfizer being able to produce quicker."
19690,"So, I read it as 2 different things."
19691,I can be wrong ofcourse.
19692,"Yeah, she definitely looks like your typical Trump voter üôÑ"
19693,"Agreed, I was just kidding by saying how well the states has handled vaccination procurement"

19695,Generally virus mutations are less harmful.
19696,Evolutionarily this helps the spread.
19697,I think the asymptomatic spread makes it more difficult for that rule to apply though.
19698,With vaccine drives and boosters the most likely scenario is that covid will mutate to be less harmful.
19699,If covid mutates into more of a common cold illness then covid vaccines wouldn't be as much of a need unless you're vulnerable.
19700,Thus that strain surviving.
19701,"It's not optimistic knowledge, it's knowledge based on prior knowledge of viruses."

19705,The people assaulting Asians in the street are almost always not white.

19717,We had a close family friend (80 year old) die of covid a few weeks ago.

19725,"I'd imagine a lot, if not most, of these doses won't go into American arms."
19726,"Biden plans to have enough doses for all American adults by May, and I just can't imagine Johnson and Johnson manufacturing an additional *hundred million* doses on top of what they're already planning to make within a couple months."

19728,"Considering a hundred million Johnson and Johnson doses would vaccinate almost half of American adults, and we'll have enough doses to initiate half of adults by the end of the month, I just don't think even half of these doses being ordered could end up in American arms."
19729,I was working in finance... until the school/preschool closed.

19735,The US government stepped in a day or two ago with the DPA for the manufacturers of raw ingredients for the vaccines.
19736,This should speed up some of the backlog for both the Pfizer and the J &amp; J vaccine.
19737,What people don‚Äôt realize is that throughout this pandemic the US has continuously been exporting raw materials and ingredients as well as other components for all of the Covid vaccines.
19738,My household will be joining them by the end of the month!
19739,Allowing Pfizer and Moderna (as well as Johnson and Johnson) to export vaccines (that Canada has purchased) from US production lines isn't donating those doses.
19740,It's allowing exports.
19741,Canada is currently getting it's doses from Pfizer and Moderna through their European Supply chains.
19742,The EU isn't 'donating' those vaccines to Canada.
19743,Canada purchased those vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.
19744,"We don't need donations, we do need vaccines."
19745,We have them purchased already.
19746,US simply allowing exports from production lines inside of the US would be more than enough for Canada.
19747,Because even he knows that liberal areas have a higher quality of living
19748,"Redditors always get mad about the US being so cozy with big business, then gets mad about the US enjoying the perks of that relationship."
19749,I‚Äôm surprised he hasn‚Äôt started arresting anyone wearing a mask.

19760,Restaurants and bars are absolutely packed.
19761,You do still see lots of people (80%+) wearing masks in stores but we will see if that continues after today.
19762,Yes in the city I live in now.
19763,"It's already causing superbugs in hospitals and in the wild, but it's not as simple as saying ""well never use antibiotics for covid-19 patients"", because one of the unfortunate aspects of covid-19 is it often is accompanied by secondary bacterial infections, which can easily cause serious and deadly issues for those patients."
19764,"It's understandable for a doctor to see something that looks like it could be a secondary infection and to treat immediately, instead of waiting til it gets out of hand to make sure."
19765,Explain California then.
19766,The only way this was possible is if the supply exceeds the demand.

19786,"Day after, felt like shit but still totally usable."
19787,I was not unable to perform any tasks that I would normally do.
19788,IE lifted 20 lbs of charcoal and was able to reach above my head to close the hatch on my car etc.
19789,Jealous.
19790,"Can't wait until my state does the same, I'm itching to get this vaccine."
19791,Not yet.
19792,The death rate for even 60-70 is much higher than 40-50.
19793,"A lot of those people want the shot, and should be prioritized."
19794,"Most people below 40 are respecting the honor system, but everyone wants the shot."
19795,They can afford to wait another month while we prioritize older Americans.
19796,Please explain
19797,I live in Texas.
19798,My opinion is that people who weren't taking it seriously to begin with will continue to not take it seriously.
19799,I have more friends who are being cautious and they will continue to wear a mask and only go out occasionally until they are likely vaccinated.
19800,I honestly think the only thing that will change is that you'll have several instances of customers getting mad at employees at businesses that still choose to enforce masks.
19801,"I really think once we get to April and it's clear that the situation in Texas isn't all that bad, more businesses and states will start to ease up."
19802,My mom got it yesterday and has had very little side-effects
19803,I really don‚Äôt think many people are going to continue mask wearing and social distancing after the pandemic.
19804,They say the will do it for a little while longer just to virtue signal and some might wear masks and social distance for little longer but eventually people are just gonna revert back to the 2019 normal without masks or social distancing.
19805,"They could but you do that and the one down the road that doesn't, gets the business."
19806,See its pointless to give a mask mandate if you are not punishing people for not wearing and by that I mean having a law.
19807,The mandates are just ignorant to have if not enforced and only serve a political purpose.
19808,"Here's what it says in the article

&gt;vaccine effectiveness reaches 96 percent on the fifteenth day after full vaccination."
19809,"From days 7 to 14, it is 89%."
19810,I think Pfizer just began counting cases in their trial after 7 days and Moderna after 14 days.
19811,"That's just how they designed their trials, I doubt there'd be a huge difference between the two during that week period."
19812,They're basically the same.
19813,Sometimes the real world results vaccinating millions of people will turn out slightly different than their trials too.
19814,"I couldn't have driven a lot yesterday

I'd say you should have a backup plan."
19815,"Most people I know have just felt like they had a hangover though, I think I had one of the worst reactions."
19816,All the people..
19817,Leeroy Jenkins!
19818,You not liking the truth doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true.
19819,"I read the poll, I‚Äôm talking about the reasons why Americans don‚Äôt want the vaccine."
19820,"It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre anti-vax , second only in the world to South Africa."
19821,More than Any developed nation.
19822,US are no.1 for anti vaccine by your own data mate.
19823,"I have yet to find a solid source for what the actual difference is between the threshold for an EUA and a full approval, with proof/citations to boot."
19824,Everything I‚Äôve found is super super vague.
19825,Can anyone link me to anything?
19826,"If the safety endpoints are the same for an EUA, why can‚Äôt they just give a full approval?"
19827,Well done for putting yourself in for the study.
19828,Hope it goes well for you.
19829,"Yeah, its all happening so fast the data still has to catch up in some places"
19830,Reporting is weird.
19831,"The feds shipped 3.6M doses last week but only about 460,000 have been reported through yesterday - lots of room to grow."
19832,"I expect a lot of those doses have been administered but not reported

That said, J&amp;J is going to be snail's pace for a little while and won't have a large impact on the numbers, unfortunately."
19833,They're only delivering 400k to the states next week.
19834,Good way to describe it!
19835,My grandparents got their second Pfizer doses yesterday and that felt good.
19836,A few weeks I‚Äôll be helping my mom register!
19837,Wish I could find a spare dose for my husband but one thing at a time.
19838,At least I know he‚Äôs safer now that I‚Äôm vaccinated.

19846,"Columbus has the second largest city population in the midwest, but as a metro it gets outclassed by Detroit, the Twin Cities, Milwaukee, and even way smaller cities like Cleveland or St. Louis."

19855,"If it weren't for the Hancock County Health Department, eastern Tennessee would be totally effed."
19856,"All my life, I thought Hancock was the most backwoods, least sophisticated county in the state of Tennessee, but COVID has proven the good folks of Sneedville to be the real deal with the lowest COVID rate in the state and what has to be the highest vaccination rate per capita."
19857,"Before it's over, Hancock will have definitely vaccinated more people than live in that county if they haven't done so already."

19944,that's not how any of this works.
19945,[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1sj8m/daily\_discussion\_thread\_march\_10\_2021/gqg3dv0/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1sj8m/daily_discussion_thread_march_10_2021/gqg3dv0/?context=3)
19946,""" not allow exports from their AZ plants""

What does this even mean, the vaccines have been bought and paid for and being actively used immediately?"
19947,Where are the orders to AZ from these plants from other countries demanding vaccines from the UK production plants?
19948,The UK had virtually no vaccine manufacturing capability as of 12 months ago.
19949,"We paid for facilities to be created for domestic production, after the first 100m doses they can then start exporting."
19950,"You talk about ""non-existing vaccines"" but you just dont get it."
19951,Nothing stops anyone from exporting vaccines.
19952,"Even the EU have since backed down now with these claims, hopefully they can learn to stfu in the future."
19953,I just read a CNN article that said exactly that in the headline lol.
19954,"Part of the Pfizer vaccine is produced in the UK, all of that is exported

The knowledge to produce the Oxford vaccine (at cost) was exported, people went to India to help them set up for example

I did post a link but as a result my post was deleted"
19955,How about Gaza
19956,[removed]
19957,"Tbh shots in arms are a good thing, I'm less concerned about ""tourism"" than I am about the states that fumble it so bad that they drive people to go to other states."
19958,"I'm in Illinois, if people from Indiana for example would rather come to a mass vaccination site here it's because there's nothing decent near them."
19959,The federal government really needs to make sure sites are available everywhere if they want to make sure tourism doesn't happen.
19960,Or they‚Äôre inept.
19961,You can tell which by using a vaccine tracker to see the percentage of doses used (GA for instance is about 65%)
19962,"Part of the Pfizer vaccine is produced in the UK, all of that is exported

The knowledge to produce the Oxford vaccine (at cost) was exported, people went to India to help them set up for example

I did post a link but as a result my post was deleted"
19963,Probably less than a few months!
19964,You could be looking at a vaccination in late April.
19965,So what's going to happen when everybody that wants it over 50 are vaccinated?
19966,Shouldn't we open up then since the disease is not even close to as dangerous for young people?
19967,Depends so much on what you mean by normal.
19968,The extreme side - never talk about or mention covid again outside of the past tense?
19969,We need to wait for kids to be able to get the vaccine which wont be until early next year.
19970,"So the ""end"" by a health professional point of view will be next summer."
19971,"The ""social"" end?"
19972,That will happen this summer.
19973,"Once all adults who want a vaccine can get one (by May the latest on that), everything will go back to normal."
19974,"The ""personal"" end?"
19975,Thats when you get the vaccine.
19976,The only thing thats up in the air is what schooling looks like next fall.
19977,Specifically - are there masks?
19978,"I doubt we see hybrid model, but I could see some over the top parents still keeping kids remote but in really small numbers."
19979,"I think school will be normal and kids will be kids again, but never underestimate the power of school age parent-Karens."
19980,Just to clarify if anyone is wondering the UK are doing a two dose regimen for both Pfizer and AZ but are administering the second dose 12 weeks after the first.
19981,"Sure, it won't change anything."
19982,"**Except for the 4 million extra people getting the shot, which might actually save their lives."
19983,"**

Which you might realize if you pulled your head out your ass."
19984,Go visit a hospital and see how many people their are just old people who have fallen out of bed...
19985,Doubling down on your naivety just makes you look stupid.
19986,Has anyone else gotten their second COVID dose and found that they are sleeping way too much?
19987,"I got the COVID vaccine last Tuesday and I typically sleep 5-7 hours a night, I've slept 12 hours three out of the last seven nights and I'm a little worried."
19988,What freedoms?
19989,Freedom of movement and association?
19990,"Not to mention the fact that millions of people around the world are still essentially on house arrest, perhaps indefinitely?"
19991,"No, I believe my boss did though"
19992,It's only 9.6 percent.
19993,Turns out I was wrong.
19994,And the data you have given is incorrect as well.
19995,Hospitalizations have most certainly not decreased by 90 percent.
19996,Nor have deaths.
19997,"I like wishful thinking as much as the next person, but claiming we're done with covid is just delusion."
19998,"If people keep ignoring this, we will liky see another surge."
19999,"Large chains have infected even less populated areas, they are everywhere."
20000,Name a place that has gone back to normal and I can give evidence that proves you are wrong.
20001,&gt; I don't think I am.
20002,I was talking about efficacy in preventing disease.
20003,Obviously.
20004,"Seeing as how you never used any of the terms about what efficacy you were discussing, it would not be obvious to everyone."
20005,&gt;I never claimed or alluded to it being less.efficscious in preventing severe disease.
20006,"Well, no, you didn't discuss efficacy at preventing severe disease at all."
20007,"Which is why calling it ""complete"" is a joke at all."
20008,"Without the knowledge that there are different efficacy rates for different categories, then people could assume that the 72% applies to prevention against death as well."
20009,"If you'd like proof that people make this mistake, it would be inconsequential for me to find someone making the assumption that the efficacy rate for symptomatic cases applies to prevention against severe illness or death."
20010,"So, yeah, you're glossing over stuff even before we get to the discussion regarding ENSEMBLE II."
20011,I'm DED!
20012,ü§£
20013,By then it‚Äôs already too late and then no one needs the crappy Astrazeneca anymore.
20014,Then we will have enough German biontech.
20015,We need it now.
20016,Where do Davis students even go for spring break?
20017,Tahoe?
20018,"I got the vaccine in tampa, FL and they didn‚Äôt ask for ID or insurance."
20019,"But it was through a hospital where I‚Äôm already a patient, so maybe that‚Äôs why."
20020,It can‚Äôt hurt to call and ask what documentation is needed.
20021,"Did she imply that she would have shot the guy, and that her actions were actually very reasonable in that light?"
20022,Say what?
20023,"It‚Äôs a bold strategy Cotton, let‚Äôs see if it pays off."
20024,Bill Gates?
20025,If you have a BMI of 40+ you qualify on the 15th in California.
20026,It‚Äôs one of the qualifying health issues.
20027,"Yeah, besides mask mandates in private businesses, South Carolina is pretty darn normal."
20028,Bars and restaurants have been packed and essentially maskless for months.
20029,Nobody is even mentioning social distancing anymore.
20030,I‚Äôd expect private businesses to start dropping mandates by Memorial Day or so.
20031,"I‚Äôm expecting this summer to be 99-100% normal here (it‚Äôs already about 85% normal at the moment, I‚Äôd say)."
20032,WTF?
20033,Of course they do.
20034,As long as ALL vaccines must first be sent to UK people before they the UK is done with vaccination than it‚Äôs a ban.
20035,No matter what kind of semantics the UK tries to use there.
20036,Pathetic.
20037,[deleted]
20038,"I stated the medical experts opinion, it‚Äôs literally in that paragraph."
20039,What‚Äôs wrong with me stating my opinion on the matter?
20040,If you actually read what I wrote you would see what the medical experts had to say.
20041,Not really sure why this isn‚Äôt getting more coverage.
20042,This is excellent news
20043,UK variant scare has been going on for some time in the US.
20044,And crickets.
20045,Steady decline in nation wide cases.
20046,18.3% with 1st dose is absolutely fucking massive.
20047,"Consider that it's picking up the pace, there just won't be much room for the 4th peak."
20048,"Now, if it turns out that Pfizer and Moderna are not effective against the South African variant (no real proof so far), then we're fucked regardless... Fortunately, reports on it are awful, some say 10 fold less effective, some say 10 percent."
20049,"10 percent is nothing to worry about, we're nuts to think 85% or so is not extremely effective."
20050,"A couple more weeks of restrictions, then another couple of weeks... then another variant, so another couple of weeks."
20051,It's just not going to work.
20052,[removed]
20053,Meanwhile MD will still be 65+
20054,WTF?
20055,Of course they do.
20056,As long as ALL vaccines must first be sent to UK people before they the UK is done with vaccination than it‚Äôs a ban.
20057,No matter what kind of semantics the UK tries to use there.
20058,Pathetic.
20059,"For the moment, yes."
20060,"Once the UK has received the first 100 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine produced within its borders, the country will start exporting/donating to Covax."
20061,"including overweight, smokers, people with heart conditions (without specifying what conditions quality), is very lax."
20062,The essential worker categories are also extremely broad.
20063,"In most if not all states, when it opened to anyone with conditions and essential workers, ANYBODY can twist themselves into a pretzel enough to qualify."
20064,"Combine that with messaging that if you're eligible go get a vaccine, and we're not checking to be sure to you qualify under our extremely lax criteria you have a system overwhelmed because everybody is trying to sign up."
20065,And yes its CRITERIA plural.
20066,I had to go to Destin last winter.
20067,I was usually the only person wearing a mask anywhere.
20068,Those ones pulled out of their asses weren't sterile and had to be thrown out.
20069,lebron can be as wishy washy as he wants.
20070,he lives in LA so a healthy (checks google) 36 year old won't have to decide for another couple months.
20071,presumably he won't want to deal with side effects during the season/playoffs so that gives him till june to make a decision.
20072,"in order to get his vaccine completed before the olympics he'd have to get the first dose by june 17 (assuming they will arrive in tokyo a week ahead) 

(checks google again)

well damn, the finals end july 22 so if he makes the finals he's not going to the olympics anyway i guess, either way his earliest first dose won't be until that's all over so either july 23 (4 months from now) or in august"
20073,Blue anon strikes again.
20074,Too soon.
20075,I would rather they do it by age.
20076,50 and older now and then 35 and older sometime in April.
20077,"In May they can open it to everyone but now is too soon, in my opinion."
20078,Bro the vaccine works well against the SA variant.
20079,What crowning achievement of your life would you like to brag about instead?
20080,We'll be fine by the summer.
20081,"Worst case, if we are not fine we can always readjust our plan, but IMO that seems highly unlikely."
20082,[deleted]
20083,oooo.
20084,Good idea.
20085,I love laminating stuff.
20086,"Others having this same problem -- use this: https://www.vaxxmax.com/riteaid

You will 100% be able to find one if you're willing to drive a little bit and check a couple times a day."
20087,I am too.
20088,Libertarians certainly don't support local government regulating everything.
20089,I don't know any that don't value the constitution or that are ok with giving a dozen people the ability to have another go at slavery.
20090,[deleted]
20091,"With him, it's more about what he *wasn't* able to say, because he was muted."
20092,He's said plenty about it now.
20093,"And when the CDC Director is pretty much saying ""our numbers then were garbage because the administration wouldn't allow us to tell the truth"" maybe you should pay fucking attention for a change."
20094,Not as well as your immune system
20095,Was able to see four friends this weekend.
20096,We all tested negative before getting together and all have been WFH and very cautious.
20097,"They skied, and I stayed at the house otherwise."
20098,Was so nice to realistically make plans for the summer.
20099,"I don't see them very often, and saw them even less with COVID, so we literally planned something for every month starting in May."
20100,He is a social activist who cares about pubic policy issues and knows what he says is important and influences people.
20101,"He also has had months to talk this over with his family, to consult with doctors, scientists, public health officials, activists, to inform himself so he can come up with what he thinks is both the best thing for himself and for the public."
20102,"At this point everyone knows ""I'll be talking it over with my family before deciding and you should too"" means a) he's hesitant about taking a vaccine himself, and b) he doesn't really intend for his words to encourage people who look up to him to get vaccinated either."
20103,"At the end of the day he is an NBA player and not a doctor so I'm not going to harp on this too much for getting this wrong, but it's clearly an irresponsible decision."
20104,Totally agree.
20105,I feel like I've been in the 99.9th percentile of Covid caution and am really not sure when I would be good with eating in a restaurant or not wearing a mask in places (without knowing that every single person in there is vaccinated too).
20106,"With the risk of resistant variants, trumpies, and developing countries as reservoirs due to not being able to vaccinate enough people, I feel it'll take a lot more to get over the hump for the 100th percentiles than even the 99.9ths."
20107,Hmmm good point.
20108,Idk though I'm all for sharing everything and just forgetting about borders.I know it's a Utopia but a man can dream.
20109,Because you could also make the point that just because a country did take necessary precautions they shouldn't be punished for it.
20110,Also as long as Hungary won't bring back democracy they can cry all they want about not getting help from the eu but maybe they should fix their own problems first.
20111,Aaaaaaaayoooooooo!
20112,"Cool, Let's ignore the data that says nearly 70% of Americans - AGAIN, on par with most countries - don't buy into this crap in any form in the first place."
20113,Let's ignore that Russia outpaces both SA and the US in hardcore anti vaxxers.
20114,"Let's ignore that the bulk of vaccine hesitants - like most of the developed world - are concerned about side effects, ineffectiveness or are simply complacent about the disease."
20115,Let's just ignore all that and claim a country with average enthusiasm for the vaccine is somehow a bulwark of anti vaccine sentiment because you have a raging jingoist priapism.
20116,"I mean, facts didn't matter when Brexit was voted on, so why the hell should it matter here?"

20126,What they are is random.
20127,"With a competitive bias for ones that spread faster, which means attacking the host more effectively."
20128,And a longer term bias for keeping the host infectious for as long as possible.
20129,"Since dead hosts stop being infectious, that eventually selects for non-lethal."
20130,"The catch with that is ""eventually"""
20131,I don‚Äôt think this will be true unfortunately.
20132,Western Pharma has been pulling out of Europe for over a decade in favour of the USA and it‚Äôs likely that it will be AZ or Russia/china‚Äôs vaccines used in the long run for developing nations.
20133,"Yeah, it's opposite if anything, but truth is more complicated."
20134,I'm getting the vaccine and hoping the trump idiots don't cause too many variants.
20135,I'll be returning to my normal life once the vaccine I got is at full effectiveness next month.
20136,I don't care what the CDC or fauci says after they knowingly lied about masks.
20137,The email just said it was due to ‚Äúthe ongoing public health crisis.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if either the tour promoter and/or the venue postponed because they had no idea what restrictions would be in five months.
20138,"I live in PA, one of the more conservative states as far as restrictions go."
20139,Right now we can only have 15% capacity at indoor events.
20140,But I think you‚Äôre right in a way too.
20141,"The argument then usually turns to international travel, ignoring that Florida sees more international tourists than New York."
20142,Florida escaped the earliest surge because of our weather.
20143,It‚Äôs gorgeous in the late winter/early spring.
20144,People don‚Äôt stay inside.
20145,"That‚Äôs why our first surge happened in the summer, when it‚Äôs actually fucking miserable outside."
20146,[removed]
20147,Racists in San Francisco?
20148,You don‚Äôt say...
20149,No change today.
20150,Honestly not a single thing has changed.
20151,"In major cities (Austin, Houston, Dallas) 90+% comply in stores, and indoors."
20152,In small towns that can dip down to like 30-50% compliance in stores.
20153,I think this week and next we will see a drop off.
20154,Maybe 10-30% fewer people complying.
20155,And I imagine smalls towns in a few weeks will start to look pre pandemic.
20156,"I know a couple people in Texas and the main issue to them is restrictions, not the virus."
20157,As soon as mask mandates lift they'll never wear a mask again.
20158,I'm sure it depends on your social circle though.
20159,To some people it might seem like everyone takes it very seriously and to others it might seem like nobody gives a shit.
20160,"It depends who you hang out with, like-minded people tend to attract eachother."
20161,&gt; I also have confidence in our ability to turn out boosters.
20162,Confidence is NOT the same thing as depending on something that is completely unknown.
20163,This is where you keep repeatedly getting it wrong.
20164,The state of CV today *will not* be the state of CV in 6 months.
20165,"There are plenty of unknowns and several positive pieces of news, but every expert I've read and listened to says that this is absolutely NOT THE TIME to fuck around and find out."
20166,"Again, the link I posted would explain all of that to you if you chose to listen."
20167,"&gt; Further, I don't think zero COVID is or should be the goal."
20168,"Of course, that's the goal, but it's not attainable anytime soon."
20169,"It may never be attainable because in all likelihood, CV19 will be around for a long time."
20170,We fucked up and let it spread far too much.
20171,There's no putting the genie back in the bottle with viruses.
20172,They either do or do not kill themselves off.
20173,The goal is to get the infections down to a level where the vaccines are able to essentially stop community spread.
20174,We're extremely lucky to live in a time where we can actually vaccinate against an mRNA virus.
20175,That's huge and will probably save millions of lives.
20176,"But as the CDC director said in that interview and in other places, if we don't keep the rate of spread down (the R0 number) it *will* mutate."
20177,This is what viruses do.
20178,Every additional case that exists means a roll of the dice to see if a new mutation will happen.
20179,"Over time, viruses *tend* to become more contagious and less (directly) deadly as it does not behoove the virus to kill off its host until it can replicate."
20180,"But the problem is that there's no negative to killing off the host *after* the fact, and lots of places the virus hides and can potentially resurface later."
20181,"This is why the ""99% of people survive!"""
20182,thing is absolute stupidity if you know anything about viruses.
20183,Google Post-polio syndrome if you are unaware.
20184,"This is an extreme example, but what if CV19 mutates to become even more infectious, has more asymptomatic spread and then does long-term lung and organ damage to a large chunk of our otherwise healthy population?"
20185,THIS is why experts are telling people to be patient just a little longer.
20186,My goal is to get things under control and they are NOWHERE near that now.
20187,"If nothing else, we need to give our already overworked healthcare professionals and first responders a break."
20188,"This is a great resource:
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html

Also, since the conditions that spawned our last few pandemics haven't gotten any better whatsoever (specifically, animal wet markets) there's every reason to be concerned about the *next* Coronavirus happening while we're still battling the first one."
20189,Is that *likely*?
20190,"No, but it absolutely could happen and isn't that *unlikely*."
20191,I haven't been following along closely to the new studies so I don't know if they've gotten anything that has a little more resolution because the initial studies had so low N numbers it wasn't really able to be compared against the J&amp;J vaccine.
20192,Texas works also.
20193,We have multiple places where you can walk right in and get it no questions asked.
20194,They are begging people to show up.
20195,This 4th of July will be the best July 4th since 1776.
20196,Tons of people gathering without masks and watching fireworks together.
20197,It‚Äôll be our first 100% normal major holiday since New Year‚Äôs in 2020.

Wow thank you for the insight genius."
20203,My statement was a clear generalization based on polling of the reddit userbase.
20204,"We get it, hating joe rogan is a personality trait of yours but to your dismay, he‚Äôs not going away anytime soon."
20205,to be clear i am very pro vaccine and think everyone should get it - but when Dr Fauci and the manufacturer of the vaccine is telling you ‚Äúplease follow the proven dosing regimen‚Äù and you ignore it because you botched a vaccine rollout... that gives me major pause.
20206,"and yes, people should absolutely be able to choose which vaccine they are putting into their bodies."
20207,Well I can't speak for them as i'm not there and I tend to stay out of US related news etc.
20208,"But I had a chuckle at retiree's in weekend cosplay, it made me instantly think of your LARP at the Capitol a few months back..."
20209,Yes I put a comment up and had the same thing.

20211,I was a little worried tbh
20212,Taking a hot bath helped me.
20213,"Yes, they have residency requirements."

20215,[removed]
20216,"yes definitely boosters, J&amp;J is in the midst of their two dose trial which might prove it gives enough benefit to ask people back or it might proved needed to fight variants of concern."
20217,they cna always donate or giveaway any extra but if they don't lock it in now others will be in front of the line.
20218,Better to have a surplus we can share than not have enough.
20219,Why's he mentioning Trump in a thread that has nothing to with him?
20220,Ice and movement for sure.
20221,I'm looking for pointers concerning the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.
20222,I just don't think that'll be it at all (and June is way too early).
20223,I'm really thinking about people who are so incredibly anxious that they won't even feel comfortable right now seeing other people who are vaccinated even when they themselves are (and there are a lot of people like this).
20224,"I think a major issue is that when the CDC announces things that suggest we can lighten up in certain ways (such as cutting quarantine time from 2 weeks to 10 days or saying that vaccinated people can see each other without masks), there's always the thought that they're trying to make it so that at least we will still follow some basic principles."
20225,"Basically, what I mean is that when Fauci says that over christmas, he highly recommends that people limit their gatherings and wear a mask when you can, he really means that of course no one should get together at all and you should never see you don't live with without a mask, but since way too many people are incapable of following basic science, he rather they do something rather than eschew all protections."
20226,"Essentially, there's been very good reason over the course of this pandemic to believe that the CDC's guidance has not been the objective best advice to follow if you're a capable, rational person."
20227,"There's also the major, major concern that once mask guidance is lifted, that there will still be countless trumpies who never got vaccinated and will still be around to infect us."
20228,"I don't know, I'm probably predicting the worst, but I just really don't know what it'll take for the general consensus to be that of comfort if there's no full-on breaking point."
