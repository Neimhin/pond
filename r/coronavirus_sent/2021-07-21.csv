27,Lol very true!
28,"Yep, but I have to say I have a lot of friends, family &amp; business associates who are a little reluctant to take the vaccine here in NZ when it does become readily available."

56,"I would like to get vaccinated but I am extremely afraid, I have OCD/health anxiety."
57,"Yes, I realize people are going to say that if I have OCD/health anxiety then not taking the vaccine makes no sense because I should be more worried about getting Covid."
58,The difference in my mind though is that getting the vaccine is a 100% thing.
59,I 100% will be putting the vaccine into my body if I make the choice to go get vaccinated.
60,Dying from Covid 19 is more of a gamble.
61,"So, it makes it a really hard decision to make for someone who is scared to take antibiotics even at times."
62,"I know the vast majority has very mild reactions/side effects, but I am a health paranoia person so it's those more rare cases that I am worried about."
63,It also scares me that this vaccine is very new and created quickly.

237,"But if you think your thin cloth cheetah print mask protects you from the deadliest virus in our lifetime, then hey, you can think that!"
238,&gt; For those who don't understand : vaccine doesn't necessarily prevent you from catching or spreading the virus.
239,"It makes it weaker if you catch it, essentially

That's not exactly correct and yet I hear people saying this all the time."

""Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19."""
241,"However, vaccines (in general) don't work for 100% of recipients."
242,"The efficacy of a vaccine in preventing disease indicates how much more likely a fully vaccinated person is at avoiding disease compared to an unvaccinated person, and that was approx 95% for Pfizer and Moderna for the early strains of Covid-19, and is lower for more recent variants (100% would be perfect immunity)."
243,"For instance, for the delta variant it appears the efficacy in avoiding disease is [around 88% for Pfizer](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891)."
244,"Your overall point is correct, however; because we don't get 100% efficacy from vaccines, we should be assuming that we can still catch and spread Covid, especially the new variants that are surging."
245,"And because of that, we should be taking precautions to help protect everyone who isn't (or can't get) vaccinated."

252,"Even stores that had been very disciplined, weren‚Äôt enforcing masks among employees, which even seemed to violate CAL-OSHA rules."
253,"In short, it was getting sloppy given the spreading Delta variant."
254,"I realize many parts of the country just don‚Äôt care about masks, but many parts of Los Angeles had been pretty disciplined‚Ä¶and then it wasn‚Äôt."

335,"If reports say that if youre vaccinated theres a very low chance of you getting the virus once youre vaccinated and a very low chance of you transmitting the virus, why would you still wear a mask?"
336,I don't get it.

The flu also can cause neurological and psychological problems [Source](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/flu-season-and-the-links-between-mental-health-and-infectious-diseases-public-health-watch ), why wasn‚Äôt this a concern then?"

379,Go science!
380,And remember the mutations that can appear thanks to the anti vaxxers idiots around there
381,"First, so happy your dad is ok!"
382,Now‚Ä¶this is what I‚Äôm worried about!
383,All of the unvaccinated morons consuming resources people non-Covid related illnesses need.
384,I‚Äôm also heartsick for the healthcare workers who have to treat these fools knowing the vast majority of the cases they‚Äôre seeing could have been prevented.
385,Shit is fucked up.
386,Delta is coming for them.
387,I got Pfizer for my first dose but I'm not in a position to receive it as my 2nd dose.

405,No.

417,"My college is requiring vaccinations with proof, so the situation isn‚Äôt really a 1:1 comparison."
418,"If I had a professor specifically and personally request masks in their classroom, yeah, I‚Äôd comply."

426,Exactly this.
427,But... not only this.
428,"I'm vaccinated,  but I still choose to wear a mask."
429,Mainly for 3 reasons tho.
430,1.
431,I don't want to get it.
432,Even tho I'm vaccinated I can still get it.
433,"It won't kill me or even put me in the hospital (well, for at least 99% of those vaccinated), but it doesn't mean that I won't get any of the long term effects."
434,And I don't want those.
435,2.
436,"If I did get it and didn't know (cuz, let's say that I got a mild case and didn't know i had it), I can still spread it to those who can't get the vaccine (Children and the immunocompromised."
437,The people we should have no qualms about trying to help protect!).
438,3.
439,I do NOT want to help pass this virus along so that it becomes a mutated variant that becomes non-responsive to our vaccines.
440,(Which is what it is going to do.)
441,"I know people will say, ""Well,  if you are saying listen to science and the CDC says that vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask."""
442,Then I say...well...see above.
443,My county has a fully vaccinated rate of around 40%.
444,"Maybe 10% of people i see at the grocery store, etc., are wearing a mask."
445,"Therefore, unvaccinated people are either being responsible and not going out or, more likely, are just not being responsible."
446,"Therefore , I will continue to wear a mask."
447,And...if it matters...I'm a doctor.
448,"After the histrionics by US congresspersons, I find this quite hilarious."
449,[deleted]
450,Never stopped wearing masks indoors.
451,At will employment.
452,Are vaccination choices a covered class?
453,What are your sources?
454,"I gave you a source that is just over 24 hours old that says LA county is the only county currently mandating it 

Here‚Äôs an additional source that is 7 hours old stating that LA county is the only county with a mask mandate and the cities of Pasadena and Long Beach saying they would follow LA‚Äôs lead 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-21/do-i-need-to-wear-a-mask-indoors-rules-vary-across-california%3f_amp=true

As for your 2/3 comment, the source I quoted above states it‚Äôs 1/3

Edit: since you want to ninja edit your comment stating that you are being downvoted for speaking facts."
455,I have shown that you are not speaking facts and are willingly spreading misinformation
456,I‚Äôm doing it.
457,My kids brought home an awful cold and I‚Äôm 32 weeks pregnant.
458,"It‚Äôs been 2 miserable weeks of congestion, coughing, head pressure, exhaustion, etc."
459,and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I don‚Äôt even want mild covid.
460,Nope.
461,No thanks.
462,After this I‚Äôll have a newborn and the risk gets even higher.
463,"So, whatever."
464,I don‚Äôt even care.
465,Masks aren‚Äôt a big deal and don‚Äôt bother me much at all.
466,"Please do you have any sources, I need the perfect source to show my boss and explain this to her"
467,"We don't only use AstraZeneca, it's only used for over 40s so it's almost 50/50 split between AZ and Pfizer."
468,Effectiveness against hospitalisations is really good for both vaccines.
469,The problem is the unvaccinated.
470,"I'm guessing you're from the US, if so you guys have a bigger problem with antivaxxers and Delta is already causing issues because so many states are also pretty much open anyway."
471,Ffp2s?
472,"&gt;""a Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted July 13-15 and released Tuesday shows that 37% of unvaccinated Americans think vaccines are riskier than COVID-19""

Okay, given that belief they're making a rational decision."
473,But what about the 63% of unvaccinated Americans who think the vaccine is less risky than COVID-19?
474,Why aren't they getting vaccinated?
475,"Had my second dose at the beginning of January, very interested in hearing about boosters."
476,Lol ... me too.
477,I imagine their already on thin ice with some of their donors over what happened January 6th.
478,"Now if their anti-vax rhetoric causes local leaders to reinstate NPIs like mask mandates and capacity restrictions, that's economic damage to potential donors."
479,"Unlike what some in this sub think, mask mandates and capacity restrictions do have negative economic effects on many small businesses like restaurants, live entertainment venues, gyms ect."
480,"Considering tourism and services drives local economies in many areas, that's bad news for many of the businesses interests that fund the GOP."
481,"Also, I doubt even many non-services businesses probably aren't anxious for reinstituting mask mandates for their office workers as they transition back from remote work."
482,If you wear glasses they help a lot.
483,"Just curious why this is though, wouldn't you expect something as big as modernas vaccine to also have lots of studies coming out for it ?"
484,I‚Äôm not who you‚Äôre talking to but you‚Äôre being downvoted because they are right.
485,A recommendation is not a mandate.
486,L.A county is the only county (in the entire nation) with a mandate as of now.
487,"I'm a high risk professor at a uni that's not requiring students to wear masks, vaccines or no."
488,Is wearing a mask in the classroom really ruining the college experience for you?
489,Is this discomfort worth the risk to people like me?
490,"I am tempted to say that if masks alone are ruining your experience, then you're in college for the wrong reasons."
491,"The other stuff I get, like zoom classes (they suck), and no socialization."
492,That sucks.
493,But you can still do that now that you're vaccinated.
494,All I hope for is that my students are nice enough to wear masks in the classroom so they don't kill me.

Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)

confidence interval \[CI\], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha

793,I think the gist of this is correct.
794,"However, I'd like to point out that mRNA does not really instruct white blood cells to do anything - RNA is translated to produce proteins."
795,"The mRNA instructs your body to produce the spike protein, which when recognised as 'foreign' would generate an immune response (e.g."
796,antibodies against that spike protein are produced).
797,I want to add that  Viral Vector vaccines (Astra and JnJ) use a modified Adenovirus as a vector to delivier DNA  into your cells.
798,Our cells transcribe the instructions into mRNA which again prompts our cells to produce the spike protein.

819,"I‚Äôm looking at recent hospitalizations for children in the Netherlands, and by far they are the group at the lowest risk of a severe outcome, even without vaccinations."

829,"If you tell him that he puts people at risk, he also doesnt care, literally doesnt care, because in his view you are the bigger ignorant and threat if you keep driving your SUV or fuel based car in general."
830,"(Or if you simply act like you dont care about climat)

He literally said that he wont take the shot, because the other people deserve to get the virus as long as they act ignorant towards climate change, because in his view covid will be the minor problem."

847,Seems like so long ago‚Ä¶
848,Only a chem grad so take with a grain of salt.
849,The spike protein does change.
850,The delta variant spike binds more readily to the same receptor so that's why it spreads more easily (takes less viral load.)
851,But ultimately it's still similar enough that your immune system recognizes it and this is a relatively small change.
852,"I suppose it could become specialized enough that the vaccine antibodies are slightly worse at holding onto them, but I doubt it will lose effectiveness as long as it targets the same receptor."
853,"As for moving to other receptors, that seems a pretty big stretch."
854,These are still pretty specific surfaces to bind to and remember it's one unit of protein for every three DNA bases.
855,It would take a lot of evolutionary pressure to cause that many changes that stick all at once.
856,"And you can't really go piecewise with just a few changes at a time to a new receptor, because again, the strongest binds will often spread and those small changes will probably only be very poor attempts to match the receptor."
857,"So, it COULD happen, but it's not likely and even then it probably wouldn't stick around and spread."
858,I think I read similar news a year and half a year ago...Why do we need to learn from experience and history if it just repeats again and again?
859,Effective is doing a lot of work here.
860,"Anything I've read seems to state the risk of severe outcomes, death, or hospitalizations  among kids  with delta haven't changed"
861,"&gt;Masitinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of mast cell tumours in animals, specifically dogs."

863,"It has been available in Europe since the second part of 2009.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masitinib"
864,If the genome sequence of the virus encoding the spike protein changes enough without affecting the virus' ability to enter the hosts cells the vaccine will definitely be less effective.

871,"Nope, I live in ventura county; no mandate here as of yet"
872,Look at the comment upthread.
873,About 17% of those who tested positive in the last week were vaccinated.
874,A double shot is about 88% effective against Delta compared to 96% with the Alpha version.

884,Not only do they usually give doctors and nurses a hard time after being told they have covid but they also take up valuable icu space that could be used for people with other major medical issues  for a disease that for the most part hospitalization cools have been almost 100 percent avoidable.
885,The umvaccimated made their choice long ago.
886,I was speaking for the country where the vaccine is available for all.

And I know for a fact this is false."
947,The vaccines reduce your chance of severe disease including death by [about ~half](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success?utm_medium=email).
948,"The regular hospitalization rate was 10%, so you're looking at about a 5% hospitalization rate for those who *do* manage to contract it but are fully vaccinated."
949,Not .014%.
950,&gt;It is **highly highly highly highly highly highly** unlikely that you will get COVID from your groceries so it‚Äôs reasonable not to wipe them down.
951,"As a doctor, stop spreading sensationalism."
952,"""As the WHO points out, it is difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of inhaled droplets and contaminated surfaces, because people who have come into contact with potentially infectious surfaces have generally also been in close contact with infected individuals""

""Poor hand hygiene was associated with increased risk for infection among health care workers, and daily use of chlorine or ethanol cleaning products in the household was associated with decreased risk (54, 70)."""
953,"""However, it is not clear what proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are acquired through surface transmission""

""Fomite transmission is difficult to prove definitively, in part because respiratory transmission from asymptomatic people cannot be ruled out""

""Case reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people by touching surfaces an ill person has recently coughed or sneezed on, and then directly touching the mouth, nose, or eyes 3, 4, 5."
954,"Hand hygiene is a barrier to fomite transmission and has been associated with lower risk of infection 6."""
955,"""In cell culture studies, SARS-CoV-2 has been described to remain infectious on stainless steel and plastic for three to four days, on glass and banknotes for two days, on wood for one day, all with a decrease of viral infectivity with time""

As you can see the science here is far from settled and CDC has based their guidance on 2 meta-analyses, far from definitive."
956,"Question: Hello all, good redditors."
957,I have an online gaming friend in Arizona.
958,"I talk to her sometimes about covid, I'm in the UK so we got Delta first and so I know how freaking transmissible it is."
959,Yesterday I mentioned I got my 2nd jab finally (yay!)
960,and she obviously asked about side effects - she watches Fox and Oan.
961,"She's a really nice, creative person but has lapped up all the BS."
962,I said about how it's 200% more transmissible.
963,"Delta multiplies 100x as fast as Alpha, so can spread like wildfire in a community before anyone knows they have it."
964,"I sent graphs showing how being vaccinated in the UK has helped against Delta; deaths from covid are down to 0.16% of infected (2%+ before), hospitalisations are now 2% (10% before), but never say overtly ""You should get the vaccine""."
965,"She always ends the convo saying ""I've got a heart condition (mid 50s), so getting a jab is high-risk"" and I tell her to stay away from people indoors."
966,Every time.
967,"I don't even say ""See a doctor about that"" because it won't work."
968,"Anyone have data, on people with heart conditions getting the vaccine?"
969,"I won't pry and ask which condition she has, but any data would be nice."
970,Thanks!
971,I agree.
972,I just don't feel bad for people who refused a vaccine and are now sick.
973,[removed]
974,It's just one study and it conflicts with other studies.
975,To say something has been proven based just on that makes you no better than antivaxxers who cherrypick one study to support their narrative.
976,We need to stay vigilant.
977,&gt; I honestly do not feel bad for these people at all.
978,Even so we should still do everything we strategically can to vaccinate the unvaccinated.
979,"Besides the possibility for more variants, if and when things blow up they end up harming the innocent, overwhelming both medical personnel and our healthcare system in general, infecting those who can't get vaccinated like children and immunocompromised."
980,"Oh, their brains have shut down long before they got to the hospital!"
981,"If they *truly* believed in and respected God, they would make better use of the amazing brain he put in their heads!"
982,Similar - I have a 2 year old and I‚Äôm pregnant.
983,Would continue to mask for the 2 year olds sake but even vaccinated I‚Äôm considered high risk since I‚Äôm pregnant.
984,Unfortunately in some areas it would take having a loved one die from this disease.
985,And I‚Äôm not even sure that would do it.
986,Biden didn‚Äôt tell them to do it and the only indication is that they did it to encourage vaccination.
987,It wasn‚Äôt political.
988,The least vaccinated age group is making up a lot of the cases?
989,I‚Äôm shocked!
990,"The vaccine is awesome, but it doesn't protect you with 100% certainty."
991,When you catch the virus from someone there's still a 37% chance you'll have symptoms.
992,"And a 7% chance that it might hospitalize you (depends on your age, fitness, immune system, ... 93% effective is an average)."
993,"I'm fully vaccinated and still wearing a mask (though it's by law in my country, so everybody does)."
994,"Personally I'm not that concerned about catching the virus now that I'm vaccinated, but I'd still prefer if I could avoid it."
995,"But idiots on this subreddit keep on making it all about politics, which is playing a role obviously, but I nevertheless find it fascinating that the most liberal age demographic in the US is also the least vaccinated."
996,"It makes sense when you consider they‚Äôre also lower risk than older folks, though."

1015,I was given to understand that the vaccination prevents infection.

the goal is to not overload the hospitals/reduce deaths and you can do that by getting vaccinated."
1023,"You are basically saying that vaccinated have to babysit the people who dont believe in covid, really?"

1061,Perhaps never having to deal with a pandemic before made them very scared about overstepping and do what‚Äôs needed?
1062,I know I read an article once where it said in the 60s or 70s the CDC warned about a pandemic that ended up being a nothingburger and ever since then the institution has been very shy to react to absolutely anything.

1097,If he is vaccinated why would you need to be worried?
1098,Many of these nursing homes are privately owned for profit.
1099,"Just curious if a loved one dies due to unvaccinated staff, would that open up possibility of civil lawsuits against the companies."
1100,That seems like a sure fire way to light a fire on these companies ass to mandate vaccination for employment.

1131,They both have 70-75% of the total population with at least one dose.
1132,"20-25% of 6 million people who are still unvaccinated leaves a lot more total people who can still get infected vs 20-25% of 600,000 people."
1133,It‚Äôs like LA- sure 60% are vaccinated.
1134,But that means 4 million people still aren‚Äôt.

1251,Same.

1281,There's not always good data for this either.
1282,Right now probably a good idea to keep tabs on things and just aim to keep those around you safe.
1283,"Usually  symptoms generally present within 14 days after exposure, and the tests are generally pretty easy."
1284,"You might also have some quarantine requirements imposed by your local government for exposure (for instance, where I live, we're legally required to quarantine for 14 days if we receive notice of contact and haven't received our second dose)."
1285,Always a good idea to check in with your doctor or health practitioner for advice (some areas have lines to nurses that can provide guidance as well) - a lot of them do tele-sessions or phone calls now and can offer a lot of guidance specific to your AHJ without having to wait in a public queue.

1290,I don‚Äôt agree with your view on the outcome and what the good and bad endings are.
1291,I‚Äôm finding a strange paradox with many people‚Äôs reasoning.
1292,"On the one hand, people are arguing that, due to vaccine inequity, countries should further restrict borders, implement ‚Äúsuppressive measures,‚Äù and add more border restriction and and hurdles for people entering a country."
1293,"I would argue that having a more open world grants a higher degree of equity, in general."
1294,"If someone cannot survive well in the place that they live, they should have the opportunity to venture into other countries."
1295,"And furthermore, these people should be able to get vaccinated in those countries as well."
1296,"If we want more world equity, the answer is not stricter borders and additional hurdles for free movement."
1297,"In fact, implementing those policies does the exact opposite by keeping those with privilege further in privilege."
1298,"The good scenario is one in which things open as much as possible, while severe cases are kept down."
1299,The good scenario is one in which the world gets vaccinated.
1300,The vaccines work.
1301,"Unless you have hard evidence that there efficacy has been decreasing, you are posting mere hearsay."
1302,Test and test again has shown that the mRNA vaccines are above 90%+ effective against severe Covid symptoms if infected.
1303,That‚Äôs amazing.
1304,We are lucky that the internet and other technologies enabled a scientific triumph at such a record pace.
1305,We have evolved as humans since the Spanish flu.
1306,"They didn‚Äôt have massive database sharing, dna sequencing, and so forth."
1307,"Put simply, it‚Äôs a completely different ball game now."
1308,"In short, it‚Äôs important for countries and places to open as quickly as possible and to reduce restrictions and other burdens as quickly as possible."
1309,"The pandemic has affected underprivileged people more than privileged, mostly because they can not endure the hardships imposed upon them in the form of lockdowns and so forth."
1310,They simply cannot financially withstand that.
1311,Masks never helped in a pandemic because a troll says so?
1312,OK bud.

1334,And I am so fed up.

1419,"This will never be over unless we mandate masks, stop events, test before crossing state lines and getting on planes, setup quarantine areas like what New Zealand has done."
1420,FFS it would only take 45 days of taking this pandemic seriously and we would be done with it.
1421,or we can spend the next 10 years dealing with variants and booster shots while it whittle away at our 45+ population.
1422,"I‚Äôve gotten vaccinated twice, I‚Äôve worn a mask the whole time, and I‚Äôll continue to for the foreseeable future, but I‚Äôm immunocompromised."

1598,The Desantis worship down in Florida is all too real.
1599,He won't even do much for the red tide issue we have going on either.
1600,I think his laws and mandates say it all.
1601,"Actually, yes, you do because those vaccines offer sterilizing immunity."
1602,Herd immunity only occurs one individual vaccination at a time.

1609,Fucking goddamn duh.
1610,I'm so tired of this open up and then inevitably realize it was the WRONG MOVE and then try to contain the situation.
1611,Is there NO ONE in leadership who has any fucking foresight?
1612,This is some ridiculous excuse making for pisspoor behavior.
1613,The fact that you‚Äôre affronted really speaks to how you must treat people you view as ‚Äúthe help.‚Äù Can‚Äôt imagine how much spit you‚Äôve ingested over the years.

1622,I read the article and then watched the interview video.
1623,"Fauci *thinks* he's answering her questions clearly and unambiguously, but he's *really* not."
1624,"In fact, you can even see it in the comments here."
1625,There are two completely opposite interpretations from the same quotes thanks to them being taken out of context and the actual sentences being truncated.
1626,I think the real root of the issue is he's used to talking to lawyers and other PHDs who actually take *exactly* what he says *and the order that he says it in* into account.
1627,Applying that same method of communicating to what amounts to a public statement for your average layperson results in people being able to take his 'qualifying' (clarifying) statements out of context.
1628,That combined with the *very* careful wording that he's using to try and get the message across without causing a panic or undermining trust in other organizations means that there are a LOT of these qualifying statements.
1629,The reality is that we are getting different results: less people are getting severely ill and less people are dying.
1630,"Less death and severe illness was always the goal, not getting rid of COVID."
1631,"Disrespectful sure, but the western world can't ignore its obesity problem and its effects on health for much longer."
1632,I‚Äôm 100% ok with that
1633,"DeSantis, it is a year and a half too late to change stances now."
1634,"In fact, saying this is going to do dick-diddly about changing people's minds since the conspiracy theories are already drilled into people's brains."
1635,You have no one else to blame for these cases but yourself and the people who rode the crazy train with you.
1636,I'm not.
1637,I'm saying that based on the results of the double vaxxed pfizer group less than 1% contracted covid.
1638,"So why would that number be any different in the real world; so long as your sample size was large enough to reflect the general population, which it seems to be here."
1639,So I would expect among doubly vaxxed people in the real world that less than 1% would contract delta.
1640,But their results suggest that 12% will.
1641,"I know, I caught it earlier and was properly ashamed."
1642,I‚Äôm on mobile!
1643,Someone please explain to me why this is even a debate?
1644,Those that refuse to get vaccinated are not going to be swayed by mask wearing policy.
1645,Trying to convince vaccinated Americas to start wearing a mask again completely counters their message on returning to normal life once vaccinated and gives fuel to the anti-vaxers.
1646,Vaccinated Americans are not going back to mask wearing.
1647,It is not going to happen.
1648,You gotta love the utter lack of distancing in that picture.
1649,The risk of death for the 20-40 crowd is somewhere between BASE jumping and mountaineering in the Himalayas.
1650,For 20 and under it's like driving 7500 miles in a car.
1651,"I can understand why it's difficult to get younger people vaccinated, despite having access to a simple solution."
1652,With the way people drive nowadays the 7500 miles seems daunting to me.
1653,I would always dread driving home from work at 2-3 am.
1654,"Now, the distracted driving on the way there scares me more than early morning driving."

1668,"In this week alone we have had Scalise, Hannity, and now DeSantis/Rubio all come out swinging to get vaxxed."
1669,These are all popular names within the party and hopefully this combined with the increase in bad outcomes we are seeing in unvaccinated areas will encourage more folks on that side of the aisle to get the shots.
1670,"&gt;at what point do we just tell unvaccinated people, You had your chance, you didn't listen, go home and die."
1671,We have responsible patients to treat.
1672,"Obviously, that's unethical."
1673,"But more to the point, would you ONLY apply this to COVID/Vaccinations?"
1674,Or is the fat person also not going to receive treatment?
1675,How about the guy who waited until 52 to get his prostate exam instead of 50 and has cancer?
1676,"Yeah, a lot of very old and frail people will probably risk succumbing to a common Cold at some point."
1677,They were also vaccinated about six months and their anti bodies might have waned a bit too much.
1678,People really can't wrap their heads around the fact that other people die every day.
1679,"Obviously, we should try to prevent death when we can, but you can't save everyone."

1681,My husband and I have been holding our breaths until our girls can get theirs.
1682,I hope you never have to decide whether you're going to die from an autoimmune condition at home or risk dying from Covid in the hospital.
1683,I can tell you from personal experience it isn't pleasant.
1684,He‚Äôs been way more vocal about trashing Fauci and masks and suing cruise lines and hiding data.
1685,I think anything positive he has said on vaccines is drowned out by his very loud public communications on trashing the virus and wearing masks.
1686,Which is evidenced by Florida being the largest contributor to COVID cases nationally.
1687,I don‚Äôt give him any credit here at all.
1688,"At KU Medical Center , they are turning away up to 5 transfers a day even though they are the main trauma 1 center in the region."

1692,"https://youtu.be/sXnIb5su2TE

1693,"&gt;Also, a new mask mandate would literally only punish people who already followed the rules while simultaneously doing nothing to stop the spread of covid."
1694,"This is poor logic and should sound false even to you, geesh."
1695,"Masks reduce the particles passing from breath to and from the air, ie reduces inhaled transmissions to healthy people and filters exhales from sick people both."
1696,"It's the easiest solution for the community, not just your own self."
1697,please do not take news headlines seriously without seeing the study.
1698,"please understand there are efficacy numbers against:

1700,"&gt;strategies that work
What legal strategies does the US have in its arsenal that's going to force people to get vaccinated?"
1701,"After the vaccines are FDA approved, what's the next step?"
1702,Exactly.
1703,"I'm tired of constantly getting downvoted when mentioning kids can't be vaccinated, and getting comments saying they aren't really at risk."
1704,"We insulated them this past year +, now we are loosening restrictions before most of them can be Vaccinated."
1705,Masks and social distancing mean lower viral loads when they do get it.
1706,I really worry about the upcoming School year in places like mine that won't require masks in Schools and have loosened social distancing requirements in half since most of last year.
1707,Youtube should just ban him like they did President Trump for spreading misinformation.
1708,Time to stop playing cat and mouse with the misinformation and just completely ban anyone doing so.
1709,There is definitely a false sense of security.
1710,I live in the north east US and my state/area has a high number of vaccinated people.
1711,Barely anyone wearing masks and little to no social distancing.
1712,Vaccinated can still pass the virus along right?
1713,Plenty of vaccinated people are still getting covid here.
1714,Someone realized he's losing voters
1715,So far these have been generally (and I say generally because with immunology nothing is absolute) relegated to those who got COVID while unvaccinated.
1716,"Generally, any serious COVID effects for vaccinated people have been the exception, not the rule."
1717,They're a much smaller company that doesn't have the manufacturing expertise that Pfizer does
1718,Can anyone confirm if this is because of unvaccinated people?
1719,"Ad Hominem, a logical fallacy."
1720,This is misleading.
1721,Powecom KN95s have over 99% filtration efficiency as confirmed by the US Gov and they have a way to check if they are real will a scratch off code.
1722,Their official distributor in the US is Bonefide masks.
1723,This is like saying that people shouldn't get N95s because there are plenty of fakes.
1724,"People should get them if they would like to, they just need to be careful about sourcing."
1725,Though I personally mainly recommend KFs and N/Ps for other reasons.

1732,"There are more rational countries than the US, where people understand that mass death and critical illness are not the only bad outcomes to be avoided"
1733,"Sure, but the ones who died were on hospice care, so they were likely going to die real soon with or without Covid."
1734,The WHO is saying adult vaccinations should take priority.
1735,"The US has a different problem than most of the world, hence different recommendations from the CDC."
1736,We have vaccinated almost every adult who wants to get vaccinated and have plenty more vaccine.
1737,"They should gift the vaccine to needy countries, like India, since we are literally wasting vaccine."
1738,"I am sure we will overproduce for child doses too, come this winter--plenty of parents will refuse to vaccinate their children."
1739,No thank you.
1740,Our immune systems need to fight off bacteria and viruses.
1741,It needs practice to be effective.
1742,Living in a sterilized world will just ravage immune systems.
1743,"Yes, if delta weren‚Äôt as virulent, that difference would be minor."
1744,"Before delta, case rates were pretty low, so one‚Äôs chances of actually being exposed were also low."
1745,But...
1746,The chief purpose of vaccination was to reach herd immunity so you would have the twin protections of both the efficacy of the vaccine AND low odds of encountering the virus in the first place.
1747,"But with delta surging as much as it is, and with so many unvaccinated individuals still out there ready to be infected, the likelihood of exposure will probably soon become a near-certainty, effectively nullifying that part of the vaccine‚Äôs protection."
1748,So a breakthrough case rate of 1 in 10 is still going to be a lot of people.
1749,"Using additional protective measures again for a while (masks, avoiding crowds, etc.)"
1750,just makes sense.
1751,"Pfizer came out first in the US, so there is simply more data as those people are around 6mos out, whereas the Moderna are about 3-4mos out."
1752,"Think of Pfizer data being a whole month or two ahead, but also maybe reaching a point that they need a 6mo booster."
1753,"If you look at Isreal, one of the early ones catching India's delta variant, they were getting Pfizer a bit before Americans were doing first responders with it."
1754,"When the vaccinated IMF were catching it, as well as nursing homes, their full vaccinated data spelled some alarms about Pfizer and breakthroughs, and they estimated 64% was the new efficacy for Pfizer in these near clinical trial situtaions of everyone dosed up."
1755,"All that said, I know of plenty Moderna and J&amp;J breakthroughs, and I don't think anyone is really talking about it or comparing cases in the news yet."
1756,Here's what we can do.
1757,Anyone who hasn't been vaccinated by choice gets placed at the bottom of the priority queue and are the first ones to get turned away for COVID issues.
1758,Society shouldn't have to pay for anti-vaxxers choice to not take preventative measures.
1759,"Sadly here in the southern US, even that doesn't do it."
1760,They still can't seem to make the connection.
1761,"They chalk it up to ""Well, it was just their time to go."""
1762,I don't force my lifestyle on others.
1763,I got the j&amp;j months ago and initially refused to go massless indoors (including eating) until more people had the opportunity to vaccinate.
1764,"Now that it seems like most people who will get the vaccine have, is it necessary to wear a mask indoors for my own health or can I go back to attending parties, going to dinners, etc?"
1765,And 3 new variants
1766,"im no doctor but if variants are already better (even slightly) at evading the existing vaccine antibodies than original covid, I think the possibility exists that it could eventually mutate into something unrecognizable to the vaccine antibodies."
1767,"it would still technically be the same virus though, wouldn't it?"
1768,I can‚Äôt confirm this but I remember reading a report saying it was around 66-75% effective against Delta.
1769,The whole of reddit has been like this for the past couple days.
1770,"It isn‚Äôt though, is it"
1771,I don't follow this sub too closely.
1772,LA is largely vaccinated though.
1773,Cases don't matter much if they rise in highly vaccinated populations and few people are symptomatic.

&gt;Testing people who have been vaccinated and have no symptoms could extend this pandemic forever."
1776,"That‚Äôs because a PCR test, which still remains the gold standard of testing (over antigen-based testing), can detect just a few virus particles ‚Äî or even just one."
1777,"Those small amounts of the virus are not enough to cause transmission, according to studies in the Journal of Infectious Diseases and the Lancet."
1778,"Indeed, such small amounts of exposure can boost immunity in the vaccinated while causing no ill effects."

1799,A working group of the Ministry of Industry and Trade has facilitated supply of pigs raised in the southern province of Dong Nai to Ho Chi Minh City.
1800,"Between 7,000-8,000 pigs would be supplied each day, partly meeting the city‚Äôs demand for fresh pork."
1801,"Total supply of fresh groceries, to HCMC and other localities hit by Covid-19 is sufficient, but partial shortages, which result in higher prices of groceries, occur from time to time in some places in the city, according to the two working groups."
1802,"Reasons behind the partial shortages include food producers having difficulties in implementing the stay-at-work mode during Covid-19 outbreaks, and slaughterhouses facing shortages of workers who live in locked-down or quarantined areas."
1803,"Besides, meat-carrying vehicles have to go through many checkpoints along routes to HCMC."
1804,"HCMC‚Äôs three wholesale markets of Binh Dien, Thu Duc and Hoc Mon, along with many traditional markets remain closed to prevent Covid-19 from spreading."
1805,"When operational, these markets meet over 70 percent of the city‚Äôs demand for agricultural products."
1806,"Over the past three days, the two working groups have collaborated with relevant city agencies as well as goods producers and distributors to ensure supply for HCMC and other localities stricken by the pandemic."

1840,"The current 15-day social distancing period under Directive No.16 that started on July 9 will end on Friday (July 23), but the city is still seeing an increase in new COVID-19 cases and the number has yet to reach its peak, according to M√£i."

1885,"If enough take it, then maybe you don't even get exposed to it that year, because it can't spread quickly enough to turn into a pandemic."
1886,"I guess there might also be some spillover protection from one year to another (especially in the population itself, thanks to both vaccines and everyone who has immunity from having already had certain strains of the flu recently)."
1887,"Also, maybe you just got very mild versions on some years."
1888,It literally says that word for word.
1889,Go read it again.
1890,"And no, just because you're vaccinated does not mean you're 100% in the clear and you've done your part."
1891,This is where you're wrong.
1892,The Delta variant already has mutations on the spike protein that make it harder for antibodies to bind to it.
1893,"Fortunately the existing antibodies still do work, but not quite as well which is why Delta is better at infecting vaccinated people."
1894,"The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak in HCMC is yet to reach its peak and the numbers could keep rising in the coming days, the municipal CDC warned Thursday."
1895,"Within just 12 hours starting 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the southern city had recorded 2,433 new Covid-19 cases, according to the Ministry of Health."
1896,"In the fourth coronavirus wave which hit Vietnam in late April, HCMC has recorded over 43,700 cases so far to become the heaviest hit locality in the country."
1897,"Despite the rising case count, several positive signs have been seen, including the fact that no new cluster has been detected and almost all detected cases have been in quarantine zones and other locked down areas, the HCMC Center for Disease Control (CDC) said."
1898,"Going forward, the city has prepared several scenarios for following up on the 15-day social distancing order imposed since July 9."
1899,"The most appropriate option would be to continue social distancing measures, even ramping them up in certain areas, according to Phan Van Mai, deputy secretary of the HCMC Party Standing Committee."
1900,"Stricter social distancing for another 7-10 days would help curb transmissions in the city and the infection count could peak, he said."
1901,"The ongoing social distancing order in HCMC, issued under Directive 16, requires residents to stay home and only go out for basic necessities such as buying food or medicines, or to work at factories or businesses that are allowed to open."
1902,People must stay at least two meters from each other.
1903,"No more than two people can gather at public places apart from workplaces, schools or hospitals."
1904,I agree.
1905,Not fair to vaccinated teachers either.
1906,"If you're vaccinated, the CDC says it's safe to go without masks."
1907,This decision isn't scientifically based.
1908,"It's based on not wanting to deal with teaching kids not to bully other kids, which is supposed to be part of your job if you're an educator."
1909,This is great.
1910,There is almost no benefit from vaccinated people masking up.
1911,"The problem isn't the guidance, it's the enforcement of the guidance."
1912,"Hopefully they stay the course with this, but implement ways to check and enforce the rules."
1913,He‚Äôs been succeeding.
1914,It‚Äôs more important to show the democrats wrong than to care about health.
1915,"All the other things you listed either take a long time to fix or require a decent amount of money (actually, eating healthy is expensive too)."
1916,"The vaccine, meanwhile, takes less than an hour to do and is free."
1917,True about McConnell.
1918,He had childhood polio.
1919,"He sucks so incredibly much, but he‚Äôs correct on this issue."
1920,If this keeps up he won't have anyone to buy his fauci-ouchie t-shirts and masks-keep-me-from-drinking mugs.
1921,At least you could ask the question when scheduling your services.
1922,"If their answer is ""No, we cannot guarantee our staff are vaccinated."""
1923,Then a few responses come to mind from there that could at a minimum make them question their incredibly questionable 'medical' policies.
1924,Idk...or at least it would make me feel morally superior for 30 seconds...lol
1925,It is way too late to have any real impact on their current wave.
1926,"With the leadtime at some 6 odd weeks from shot one to full effect from shot two, they will have likely peaked and started to plateau off or drop back down in cases."
1927,The time to have acted was two months ago.
1928,"Then again, the second best time to plant a tree is today."
1929,Hmm now he‚Äôs gonna ‚ÄúFauci‚Äù all these people??
1930,?
1931,This was me.
1932,I caught covid and was lucky it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.
1933,"Everyone seemed to agree that if you caught it already, you would have some immunity for about 90 days."
1934,So I waited for a bit literally out of pure laziness.
1935,Got my first poke yesterday though.
1936,I‚Äôve had to get tested twice but that is why they don‚Äôt have the data because it‚Äôs not people tested it‚Äôs total tests done
1937,I was referring to the historic final few sparks on the way to eradication.
1938,I'll change last to final now for clarity to future readers
1939,Some countries are also single vaccine.
1940,New Zealand is Pfizer only and we have centralised health here.
1941,4 million eligible people is a good sample size for any company.
1942,"(When we get there, our vaccine program is just now ramping up)."
1943,"Have you seen anything in the last year to make you think just saying ""personal responsibility"" will make people do the right thing?"
1944,You completely missed the point.
1945,"If you would've stopped there, sure."
1946,But you drew false parallels to CureVac just because they're both Mrna vaccines.
1947,"That's like comparing covid to the common cold, since both are from the coronavirus family (well, some common colds anyway)."
1948,"It's disingenuous, because as clearly stated by multiple people already, not only are Moderna and Pfizer nearly identical (which CureVac is not), but in every study so far, including those testing against Delta, Moderna is even better."
1949,Moderna is essentially just a bigger Pfizer dose.
1950,"That's why it's reasonable to assume nearly identical efficacy rates, because they're nearly identical vaccines."
1951,Why should I wear a mask?
1952,I have done my job in the economy and got both Pfizer vaccines.
1953,The people who are unvaccinated should be the ones to wear a mask.
1954,[removed]
1955,There are also lots of people who live in one state and work in another.
1956,Like people from NJ or CT working in NYC.
1957,I have had to have two teeth drilled and filled.
1958,Neither time I had any anesthetic apart from the jelly they put on.
1959,The first time we played around for probably 45 minutes trying but I'd forcibly push away the orthodontist.
1960,Eventually just gave up and let it happen without.
1961,The second time we didn't even bother - just go for it.
1962,Oh.
1963,My.
1964,God.
1965,I swear every nerve on the right side of my head short circuited when they drilled the tooth with no shot!
1966,I have never felt pain like that before.
1967,"My ear, jaw, eye , side of head and upper chest on that side just ... ouch!"
1968,I didn't even feel either covid shot.
1969,For the first one I told them I was very bad with shots.
1970,They distracted me while talking about the weather (was a very nice day for March) and then just jabbed it in and did it.
1971,I honestly didn't feel anything other than the alcohol prep pad.
1972,The second one I said lets just try it and see what happens.
1973,I was still wincing and the person giving the shot asked me why I was wincing so bad.
1974,*Just waiting for the shot*.
1975,"Her response  - *You know we already gave it to you, right?"
1976,*
1977,That hospital food must be worth dyin' for.
1978,"I think it‚Äôs funny how many places insist on civility when talking about people who, if you were on fire, wouldn‚Äôt even piss on you to put it out."
1979,"Like they couldn‚Äôt possibly care less about any of that, and here we are self-censoring/being told to self-censor to avoid offending the worst kind of people."
1980,It's not really...S&amp;P is flat for the week...and still at an all time high...
1981,Even then I would doubt it.
1982,Enough people aren't going to see these hospitals overflowing with patients.
1983,COVID still isn't that lethal.
1984,Heartbreaking to see this downvoted.
1985,Then maybe the headline should be different.
1986,"&gt;Yes, lifting restriction when we had a highly transmissible variant present is what caused the surge."
1987,"So, lifting restrictions was ultimately the problem, thanks for proving my point."
1988,The surge in the UK started prior to restrictions lifting.
1989,You haven't acknowledged that.
1990,&gt;And your link points out that the vaccine is notably less effective against the delta variant.
1991,It absolutely does not say that.
1992,It give you the exact numbers.
1993,"It's notably lower for 1st dose but for fully vaccinated individuals, a drop from 92% to 85%, or 90% to 89% is not in any way notable."
1994,"&gt;Also, kids are less protected against this variant."
1995,There's been 0 data I've seen to suggest this.
1996,Please feel free to point any of that out to me and I'll review it.
1997,"&gt;And again, I'm sure you're smart enough to understand this but I'll say it anyway: the vaccine helping to reduce spread is not the same as stopping the spread."
1998,The spread is near 0 for vaccinated individuals.
1999,"Again, all of the studies I posted above, which I highly doubt you were able to digest in the 11 minutes between my post and yours, show that vaccines are not only effective at preventing COVID, but spreading it."
2000,Highly effective.
2001,Damn near miracles.
2002,**Vaccinated people are not responsible for this spread.
2003,"**

&gt;All of this points to us needing to be more responsible, and not cry and moan when we are expected to do our part in taking this pandemic, which is still very much a pandemic, seriously."
2004,Fully vaccinated individuals have done their part and are not responsible for any of the recent surge.
2005,Full stop.
2006,"Feel free to provide me data, peer-reviewed studies, of CDC statements pointing out otherwise."
2007,But there aren't any.
2008,At all.
2009,So what is your opinion on this based off of?
2010,"I think they also realize that the deaths are likely going to skew republican, which isn't good for their careers."
2011,It‚Äôs their red voters who are dying.
2012,"I hate to be that dark, but I think it‚Äôs a reason for their 180."
2013,"I work at a private primary school, and we required masks for everyone last year, along with other mitigation procedures."
2014,We had no spread of coronavirus on campus.
2015,"Hanoi (VNA) - A total of 6,194 new COVID-19 infections, including 6,164 domestic and 30 imported cases, were detected on July 22, the largest ever number in a single day."
2016,"It brings the national tally to 74,371, including 72,242 locally-transmitted and 2,129 imported cases, since the first positive patient emerged in January last year."
2017,"But there were 1,450 people given the all-clear from coronavirus, a record number of recoveries in a 24-hour period."
2018,"The total number of recoveries now stands at 13,421."
2019,"Of the new infections on the day, 5,164 people were already in quarantined or locked down areas."
2020,"Ho Chi Minh City, the country‚Äôs current largest pandemic hotspot, saw 4,218 new cases."
2021,"The rest were found in Binh Duong province (679), Long An province (432), Dong Nai province  (210), Dong Thap province (117), Tien Giang province (68) , Ben Tre province (65), Ba Ria - Vung Tau province (63), Hanoi (50), Can Tho city (45), Vinh Long province (38), Da Nang city (27), Binh Thuan province (26), Phu Yen province (21), An Giang province (15), Hau Giang province (12), Kien Giang province (11), Tra Vinh province (9), Soc Trang province (8), Bac Ninh province (7), Dak Lak province (6), Binh Phuoc province (5), Khanh Hoa province (5), Quang Nam province (5), Binh Dinh province (4), Hai Phong city (3), Son La province (2), Quang Binh province (2), Vinh Phuc province (2), Dak Nong province (2), Hung Yen province (2), Thua Thien-Hue province (1), Kon Tum province (1), Lao Cai province (1), Quang Ngai province (1) and Ha Tinh province (1)."
2022,The total number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 has now reached nearly 4.4 million.
2023,"Of those, 4,042,984 million have received one shot and 324,955 people fully got two jabs./."

2026,"Ok, so punishment then."
2027,I personally prefer the method in which fewer people die.
2028,But you do you.
2029,DeSantis has always been pro-vaccine but anti-lockdown.
2030,He was never inconsistent on the subject of vaccines.
2031,"However, his pandemic semi-denialism does make it seem like he is very accommodating of those who do not want to get the vaccine for political reasons."
2032,"I didn‚Äôt think any of the menstrual irregularities were scientifically proven to be related to the vaccinations, were they?"
2033,"Seemed to be anecdotal, and sort of a spin off from the infertility misinformation."
2034,I think you‚Äôre right.
2035,There needs to be a push for vaccination from multiple high profile celebs and social media influencers.
2036,If some of them kick the bucket that would be even more convincing.
2037,They are our only hope for reaching these people.
2038,Red -&gt; Dead -&gt; Redemption?
2039,The way to combat bullying isn't to make everyone the same.
2040,"If a kid gets bullied for wearing glasses, the solution isn't to make everyone wear glasses."
2041,The solution is to teach kids not to bully.
2042,Same with masks.
2043,"If you're vaccinated, you don't need one, and shouldn't have to wear it if you don't want to."
2044,We need that as an incentive to get more people vaccinated.
2045,Schools have access to kids' vaccination records and will know who is and isn't required to wear one.

2052,A low vaccination rate cannot tell anyone anywhere that vaccines don't work.
2053,"To show effectively that they work, you need a high vaccination rate."
2054,"If countries with high vaccination rates still had high death rates in their vaccinated population, that would tell us that vaccines don't work."
2055,"But countries with high vaccination rates have lower death rates than countries with lower vaccination rates (like Russia), which strongly suggests that vaccines work."
2056,That's now how you calculate vaccine effectiveness.
2057,The state did it horribly wrong.
2058,There are a lot of comments in this thread explaining it.
2059,"99.999% effectiveness means if you had 100,000 unvaccinated people and all gave them covid, all of them would die."
2060,"Do the same for 100,000 vaccinated people and only one would die."
2061,That's what the state is essentially saying which is absurd.
2062,Vaccine effectiveness is based on the improvements of vaccinated vs unvaccinated not the overall chance you have of dying from covid if your vaccinated.
2063,Sunk cost.
2064,"They‚Äôre invested so deeply, if they get vaccines now they‚Äôll feel like they‚Äôve lost."
2065,"If you're vaxxed, yes you've done your part."
2066,"It's essentially *over* for you basically, but not quite 100%."
2067,You must try to look at the bigger picture.
2068,We are all rowing the same boat.
2069,I won't blame you for not rowing anymore.
2070,"But for many of us, going another *extra mile* is still in our best interest."
2071,Every paddle that we can keep in the water will help get us *ALL* to where we want to be sooner.
2072,It's a small price many of us are willing to pay.
2073,"Ah yes, because we should take advice from an EYE DOCTOR on a virus"
2074,The priority is responsibly managing effective health policy instead of creating policy that is less effective by coddling a minority of non compliers instead of regarding the needs of the compliant majority.
2075,Paydays incentivizes the majority to delay their response.
2076,[removed]
2077,Were they vaccinated?
2078,Just curious
2079,We have plenty of anti vaxxers here - the big difference is we don‚Äôt have elected officials and network news telling you not to get vaccinated.
2080,Also I feel like the people who sre refusing the vaccine don't care what Biden says.
2081,So while Biden is just being a leader I would like to see IDK Ted Nuggent or some shit tell us to.
2082,Maybe that dude who used to play the Fonz could do a PSA
2083,Were they vaccinated?
2084,"Just curious

I hope they feel better"
2085,Uhh it's 64% in Israel for symptomatic infections not hospitalizations which is actually what the OP and myself were referring to.
2086,A case that is just someone tests positive which of course is going to be way up for the Delta varient but what obviously matters most are bad cases and deaths.
2087,Numbers that aren't actually the same keep getting compared.
2088,The vaccine does absolutely nothing for exposure.
2089,So it's 0% effective for that.
2090,For the original varients moderna reduced cases by about 66% so with Delta that would be even lower so it's basically the least effective at preventing a technical case.
2091,This makes sense because someone can get the virus in their system and test positive before they fully get rid of it.
2092,Then there's the effectiveness based on having at least one symptom which it is more effective for though again less effective for the Delta varient.
2093,Where it really holds up and is the most effective for is with hospitalizations and deaths.
2094,Though because of the lack of statistical significance to find those rare hospitalizations and deaths in the original studies there was a narrative that they they are 100% effective against those when that wasn't the case since with a big enough sample size (enough people infected) you'll get those now thankfully much rarer cases of people getting hospitalized or even dying.
2095,Now that rate has increased slightly with the Delta varient.
2096,While Delta is dominant in the US nearly all the hospitalizations and deaths are unvaccinated people.
2097,"While of course there will be plenty of positive tests and relatively mild cases, even ones that aren't great but still not life threatening."
2098,"But of course, if someone has risk factors they might want to still take additional precautions if they don't want to take the now still much lower risk."
2099,"When looking at effectiveness numbers is important to look at what is being measured at there are massive differences between a completely asymptomatic case, a mild case, a bad case, and death."
2100,"The vaccines are less to more effective in that order, which is great and totally makes sense based on how they work."
2101,&gt; Not the people who are fully vaccinated and still locking themselves into their homes while double-masking?
2102,"Funny, but no one is actually doing this."
2103,This idiot is actively trying to kill his fanbase.
2104,It‚Äôs frustrating because people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated have made their choices and won‚Äôt change their minds.
2105,[removed]
2106,He didn‚Äôt think those emails were going to leak?
2107,He volunteered them when they were requested for public record

2114,I see what you did there.
2115,Yes.

2120,Lol
2121,And I don't blame them a bit.
2122,If I had to care for these people during wave after wave of COVID within a system that doesn't ensure my safety potentially requiring me to reuse PPE or improvise by wearing a trash bag I probably would have left a long time ago.

2125,"Looks like they are taking this seriously and hitting them in the wallet:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The new rule makes being unvaccinated a competitive disadvantage this year, all part of the league's push to get players and staff inoculated ahead of the coming season."
2126,The NFL has also said that any team that vaccinates 85% of its players and staff can relax their safety protocols and has applied looser rules to vaccinated players.
2127,"&gt;  
&gt;""If a game cannot be rescheduled within the current 18-week schedule and is cancelled due to a Covid outbreak among non-vaccinated players on one of the competing teams, the club with the outbreak will forfeit the contest and will be deemed to have played 16 games for purposes of draft, waiver priority, etc."
2128,"For the purposes of playoff seeding, the forfeiting team will be credited with a loss and the other team will be credited with a win,"" the NFL memo sent Thursday states."
2129,"&gt;  
&gt;**In addition, if a game is postponed and cannot be rescheduled, players from both teams will not receive their scheduled salary."
2130,The memo also states the team with the outbreak will be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by the opposing team.
2131,**
2132,"It‚Äôs a morbid thought, but I guarantee that they have just now woken up to the fact that a souped up version of the virus we have dealt with the past 18 months is already starting to target their voter base like a heat seeking missile."
2133,Yeah I live in the UK right now and every time I go to the gym it's so terrifying.
2134,People don't care about your personal space.
2135,And I know that some people go to the gym even after being tested positive with covid.
2136,I just want to stop being afraid
2137,Me too.
2138,I made my bf watch Contagion with me like the first weekend of the pandemic (I'm a psycho) and ever since I've thought about how people would've reacted differently had it been that fast-acting and serious.
2139,The right especially is so primed by Fox News to react to fearmongering and seem slightly more likely to be preppers/survivalists- there is a different timeline where I could see them taking things the *most* seriously
2140,didn't Israel say 64%...
2141,"Teams will be winning and losing either way, so the NFL is set."
2142,It's the individual teams that care a lot more about whether or not they win or lose.
2143,Delta is really going to have a field day.
2144,The only bright side is that it will be quick.
2145,At least teachers are vaccinated (if they want).
2146,Young kids will be in for a rough ride.
2147,600k people already dead isn't a gigantic wake call?
2148,"He says he wants it, but doesn't want to deal with the punishment from his mom."
2149,"Honestly, it's a lost cause-he probably already had it or will be contracting it before he turns 12."
2150,His best friend just had it and got really sick.
2151,"Thought that might change my ex's view but instead it turned into ""See, he survived, so our son doesn't need a vaccine"" But then again, this is coming from a lady who proudly exclaims on Facebook ""Marjorie Green Taylor is my IDOL"""
2152,See above.
2153,"No vax = no indoor dining, no cafes, no flights, no trains, no museums, no amusement parks etc etc."

2180,The only thing that is really different now is that I wear a mask when I‚Äôm at work and when I go into public indoor spaces.
2181,"Oh no, the horror."
2182,"I‚Äôm not going to the grocery store to fucking socialize, so what‚Äôs the issue?"

2187,"I'm the meantime I am still going to the gym trying to avoid peak times and people altogether, but people do not seem to be trying to avoid me... 

How did other pandemics end ?"
2188,Because to me it seems we can't deal with this pandemic socially (i.e.
2189,"masks and social distancing) and medicinally it doesn't work that well (yes you are right, they didn't end up in a hospital, but still had a pretty tough time...)"
2190,You do bring up a fair point.
2191,"Pre-covid these were normal, completely nice people."
2192,"There's a lot that went on with a certain politician getting an almost cult like following, lockdowns from the opposite side that has really forced a lot of people to the extremes."
2193,I definitely give myself my distance now with a lot of things (And I don't mean physical social distancing) with this group of people.
2194,"With that said, the whole Covid situation and political climate has caused me to reevaluate myself and my view points as well."
2195,"Pre-covid I was a right leaning libertarian, post-covid I'm a left leaning libertarian."
2196,"I don't necessarily want a large government, but I will acknowledge that shutdowns and mask mandates saved a LOT of lives."
2197,And the government was able to pretty effectively roll out vaccines to MANY people!
2198,Don't pin this all on education.
2199,Schools can only do so much when kids go back home to shitty parents and a blaring tv full of propaganda/misinformation/lies and a computer with social networks of doing the same if not worse.

2214,Businesses mandating will be big but the biggest IMO will be your medical insurance denying claims or dropping you for not getting the vaccine.
2215,They thirst to not pay out claims.
2216,[deleted]
2217,So you're saying the efficacy is a function of the delta (no pun intended) between the rates of infection in the vaxxed versus unvaxxed group?
2218,"So it's not 16,000 generated 122 cases, which is less than 1% infection rate."
2219,"Rather, it's 122 in the vaxxed got sick which is 90% less than the 1220 in the unvaxxed that got sick."
2220,"I'm still unclear why that's the way they assess efficacy, though."
2221,Isn't 99% protection still a valid conclusion to reach?
2222,And watch people use those 43 as an example as why the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work smh.
2223,What's sad is it's been 20 years and these restrictions are still in effect.
2224,I don't think tragedies should change the world forever.
2225,We should be able to heal and go back to how things were before.

2232,I was going to mention this.
2233,What a cool program.
2234,Looks like they are looking at the root causes of why people are hesitant and creating special programs for the issues that they can control.
2235,I'm legitimately curious...
2236,"Given what you say, doesn't the fear of getting Covid outweigh any fear of the vaccine?"
2237,The number of people who've had negative reactions to vaccines is so incredibly minuscule compared to the number of people who have died of Covid.
2238,In any case the vaccine won't *give* you Covid.
2239,You may feel some flu-like symptoms for a day because your immune system is doing what it's supposed to.
2240,"But the alternative is to have your immune system trying to fight the virus, which I guarantee you will be a lot worse."
2241,So am I the asshole?

2352,"We went with 6 to 8 week intervals (even 16 weeks for awhile) between doses out of necessity, but also because the data showed a better immune response with a longer interval between doses."
2353,Wonder if there‚Äôll be fewer breakthrough cases than Israel/US where I think many (most?)
2354,got their second doses at 3 weeks?
2355,And it doesn't help with anything.
2356,Those that never wear the masks are gonna do the same thing and make a scene where it's required and vaccinated people are going to be the ones following those rules again.
2357,"But even in the vaccinated crowd, we're getting tired of on and off messaging having to wear masks again or not."
2358,What's the point of encouraging people to get vaccinated when they see no difference in quality of life?

2382,You've caught one and you survived but you don't have antibodies for the other three at all.
2383,Each time you contract it you're less likely to make it out ok.
2384,There absolutely are reports of people catching covid two or more times.
2385,"Not getting the vaccine isn't merely rolling the dice, it's more akin to russian roulette."
2386,Asymptomatic spread can happen.
2387,"""Incredibly unlikely"" is really vague, but vaccinated people are found to be around 70% less likely to contract the virus, and 60% less likely to spread it once infected."
2388,"No idea if you can combine those numbers, but I guess it would mean an infected vaccinated person is 12% as likely to spread it to a vaccinated person, as a non-vaccinated is to spread  to a non-vaccinated."
2389,"From PHE data, it's estimated that a vaccinated person if infected is 30% as likely to be hospitalized as a non-vaccinated person 

Which would bring the risk of an infected vaccinated person hospitalizing another vaccinated person down to around 3.6% the chance of an infected non-vaccinated person hospitalizing a non-vaccinated person."

2491,My arm hurt for two days after the shot.
2492,I'm from California...
2493,I don't see the correlation.
2494,Typical media ‚Äúsensationalism‚Äù‚Ä¶..controlling the narrative from their less than objective perspective.
2495,Precisely why I avoid the news regardless of the source
2496,How would this impact people who can‚Äôt get vaccinated for medical reasons?
2497,Would it place any kind of discrimination on those individuals?

2501,FYI I‚Äôm vaccinated but the rhetoric from friends that aren‚Äôt isn‚Äôt as out there as many would assume.

2521,I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre in this position.
2522,:(
2523,While I share your anger towards people who are doing us all harm by not simply getting vaccinated.
2524,I‚Äôd say we should be expanding healthcare coverage and not limiting it.
2525,"If you don‚Äôt pay for his healthcare because he‚Äôs an idiot, somebody else could not pay for yours because you do or don‚Äôt go to church or eat meat etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the can of worms worth opening IMHO."
2526,The good news is that Tort law in the United States is based on what a reasonable person would do and it‚Äôs pretty clear that reasonable people get vaccinated.
2527,While I don‚Äôt see insurance companies suing people over spreading the disease after refusing to be vaccinated.
2528,"The legal hurdle is to prove there was a duty of care, and it was breached."
2529,"This is tough in normal day to day situations with communicable disease, but when the reasonable thing is to get vaccinated in a pandemic, now we have a level of care that is easily proven in court, and breached by not getting the vaccine."

2532,Yes.
2533,It literally can‚Äôt *not* end.
2534,The question is just how soon.
2535,In most countries it's supply.
2536,"The more vaccines available, the faster you can get your second dose."
2537,We have no restrictions and a large number of unvaccinated people.
2538,"If a team forfeits, then deduct all the ancillary costs from the contracts of those players that refused to get vaccinated."
2539,It's just mind boggling how people believe this vaccine bullshit of it being harmful.
2540,Half the country has it.
2541,How many complications have we had?
2542,This is so stupid.
2543,"Yes my anti-vax aunt who works at an animal rescue believes that you should only vaccinate for rabies if your dog is ever outside unsupervised, and that otherwise they should remain completely unvaccinated."
2544,They need to approve booster shots for the vaccinated.
2545,2 shots isn't enough for this virus.
2546,"also intubation fucks up your throat a lot, not everyone survives it, people needs to be put into induced coma because the body wouldn't be able to withstand the pain"
2547,"Some people, you'll never change their minds, they're way too far gone."
2548,"They just won't listen, even when it happens to them."
2549,Fortunately I believe that is only a small minority.
2550,"Others can be persuaded, especially when they see someone close to them that gets infected and goes through a severe case."
2551,"To be fair, Trump had what I considered a ton of ammo against him in 2016 and yet‚Ä¶."
2552,I'm sorry about your friend in the hospital
2553,Can't speak for other countries but in the UK they prioritised getting as many people as possible their first dose with the idea that a lot of people having some protection is better than a smaller amount of people with better protection.
2554,The time between vaccines has dropped as demand has died down.
2555,"When I had my first dose in may I was told to wait 10 weeks, but it then got reduced to 8."
2556,"I had my second as soon as I got to 8 weeks, but people I know who had their second after me somehow got their second well before mine (all Pfizer) so I don't think they're stopping people having it earlier."
2557,So even the 12% could have symptoms but not bad symptoms?

2582,You don‚Äôt wait until the enemy has you flanked to start a defense in ANY war unless you‚Äôre super keen to be a prisoner of that war.
2583,"The 1918 flu epidemic was far deadlier than our current situation, but we‚Äôre not done, so the jury‚Äôs out yet."
2584,"The flu was primarily spread via troop movements in WW1; it originated in the US, in a military unit in Kansas in March 1918, and quickly spread."
2585,Deployment to Europe brought the virus to the continent where it went wild that spring and summer.
2586,"Let‚Äôs be honest, wearing masks in combat situations probably doesn‚Äôt work."
2587,"At the time, it was more akin to a seasonal flu: really nasty, but not as deadly as it would become."
2588,The flu was thought to be winding down toward the end of the summer when‚Ä¶.
2589,It mutated into a more contagious and highly deadly variant.
2590,"Does this ring a bell?, because it should."
2591,We are lucky.
2592,There isn‚Äôt a world war going on with hundreds of thousands of troops moving.
2593,"We have a far better understanding of viruses, better facilities, better ways of treating (can you imagine how many could have been lost this time without the drugs and ability to intubate patients to keep them alive?)."
2594,"We have easy access to important means of prevention: vaccines, masks, the internet, that has allowed many to work safely."
2595,"If you don‚Äôt think masks have an important part to play or aren‚Äôt effective, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll never convince you."
2596,"I know it‚Äôs hard, I know you‚Äôre tired of it."
2597,We all are!
2598,"You do you, but I‚Äôm a fighter, and I‚Äôm ready to protect myself and my family any way I can."
2599,"I‚Äôve been tired before, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm so special that the world is going to make an exception for me because I don‚Äôt want to do the hard stuff anymore."
2600,"I‚Äôve lost a husband to cancer, so I know how desperately it hurts to live your life without someone you love‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not going back down that path or put my kids through it just because ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard.‚Äù"
2601,They need to approve booster shots for everyone.
2602,"Ah, makes sense now."
2603,"Sort of like... vit D levels are high in June but low in Dec and so they might confound protection rates... the vaccine when combined with vit D levels may be more effective than when vit D levels are low (but since vit D levels will be the same for vaxxed and unvaxxed, the group comparison gets rid of those confounding variables)."
2604,"That being said, though, the hard truth of how protective the vaccine really is, is probably somewhere between that 88% and 99%."
2605,It's just to hard to get that fine a measurement though and ascribe exactly what variables are adding up to 99% protections beyond just the vaccine.
2606,The US just pushed that back to the 21st I think
2607,"Outside of neurodegenerative disorders, of course."
2608,"Nah, plenty of painters and woodworkers have been doing that for years."

2635,Not the people who are fully vaccinated and still locking themselves into their homes while double-masking?
2636,The mental gymnastics here are incredible.
2637,I'd love to see any of these people that ya'll say exist.
2638,Who tf is advocating for staying inside and double masking once fully vaccinated?
2639,How did what I say come even remotely close to that?
2640,"For real, all I see is people saying, ""Hey guys, since a significant portion of the population can't get vaccinated could we still use masks in places like grocery stores?"""
2641,"and every single one of you replies with, ""I'M FULLY VACCINATED WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY HOME!?!!"""
2642,"I just want to take my, again, *high risk* kid to the grocery store in my plague rat infested area without having to worry some armchair scientist scared of ""officials"" asking them to do something."
2643,"You also completely ignored my main point:

2644,I'm not going to ignore basic facts about viruses just to justify continuing on like normal.
2645,"You know vaccines don't stay effective, right?"
2646,This one isn't going to continue to keep you protected.
2647,At any point a mutation could come along and fuck everything up again.
2648,My point is that you all are projecting your fear of change onto the rest of us.
2649,Which is the exact same myopic bullshit that got us in this mess to begin with.
2650,Doesn't take mental gymnastics to reach that one bud.
2651,"Answer the question tho, **what would it take for you to put your big boy pants on and follow restrictions?"

For clarification since you'll probably need it: I'm not talking about *right now*."
2653,"I'm asking how bad would things need to get for you to think to yourself, ""Hm, maybe masks and distancing wouldn't be such a bad idea""."
2654,When would that thought appear on the spectrum of 'things are a tad worse' to 'bodies piling up in the streets'?
2655,What if I got a Pfizer boost last week after getting J&amp;J in March?
2656,I see lots of people recommending a single booster but not many commenting on whether people should go ahead and get the full course of a mRNA vaccine as a booster.
2657,They automatically made me a second appointment at the pharmacy but I'm not sure whether I should take it.

2734,18-24yo in ireland are only starting to get their first doses this week.
2735,"The 25% fully vaxxed stat for that cohort is mostly made up of the immuno-compromised, risky pre-existing conditions and healthcare workers in that age group vaccinated early."
2736,The percentage of fully vaccinated in the 25-49yo cohort is 46% because its dragged down by all the yet to be vaccinated 25-30yo and the single dose vaccinated 30-40yo.
2737,The 40-49 cohort is pretty much done at this stage but we don't have stats for 40-49 specifically.
2738,I imagine that vaccine uptake will drop as one goes down the age cohorts but not to a massive degree.

2767,Vaccine hesitancy and low rates of vaccination among black and Hispanic communities are caused by different reasons than white communities.
2768,"""The"" anti-vax movement is one thing, and that's what this article seems to be about."

2789,It's quite a bit past time.
2790,Some people getting vaccinated today won't hit full immunity before the disease gets to them.
2791,It lines up with being antivax for a single vaccine that came out recently.
2792,Not universally antivax.
2793,Yes the majority of Covid deaths since the pandemic started would be Alpha since Delta is a new strain and Alpha‚Äôs been here since late 2019.
2794,Yes we can arrive at conclusions as to vaccine efficacy related to Delta.
2795,Are vaccinated people catching Delta at higher rates?
2796,Are they getting hospitalized and dying?
2797,Those are not difficult data to come by.

2806,Get tested at cvs.

2808,It was easy as hell.
2809,I can‚Äôt exactly blame India for not wanting to starve its citizens to contain this.
2810,Infection control does genuinely need to meet economic demands- this a core principle of public health.
2811,And not a single mask in sight.
2812,So stop testing
2813,You can get the better vaccine when it comes out.

2824,Ok.
2825,"If half the people refuse to get vaccinated - the percentage of just the half that are not vaccinated, who would require medical intervention at a higher rate than those vaccinated; will STILL overwhelm hospitals in various areas."
2826,That is not acceptable for a myriad of reasons that should be obvious.
2827,"Beyond that, those vaccinated, who for the most part will have clinically defined ""mild"" infections if a breakthrough occurs; also shed demonstrably less virus."
2828,Which would help control spread.
2829,Which may perhaps save someone else's life...
2830,So the whole idea that those not vaccinated live in this bubble where their actions only cause harm to themselves and anyone vaccinated cannot be affected by their choice - is incorrect.
2831,That's just two logical reasons a person who is personally vaccinated may care.
2832,I can think of more but I wonder if you asked a question in good faith or were just being sarcastic...
2833,I‚Äôm not a doctor in any way and I‚Äôm saying the same thing.

2845,It really is exhausting.
2846,My dad calls his neighbor every day to try to convince him to get the vaccine.
2847,"His neighbor has a family member who‚Äôs been in the hospital for four months with Covid, and the guy still won‚Äôt take it."

2854,The vaccines were designed something like two days after China released the genome of the virus.
2855,"A prototype was manufactured early February, and in early trials by March."
2856,The manufacturing and design of a new booster could probably happen on the scale of a week to a month but trials would take longer.

2908,No one is going to ground you.
2909,Want to know why?
2910,I had a whole post here digging up the why but the mods auto removed it.
2911,Moderation is protecting the people causing the disinformation problem.
2912,"Ah, gotcha!"
2913,Excellent point!
2914,Also kids.
2915,"Sure their death rate is much lower, but kids still die from it"

2917,"In their words, ""if it don't affect me, it ain't real!"
2918,"'Murica!"""
2919,I think it‚Äôs also important that double vaxxed folks are aware of the transmission risk to unvaccinated folks and assess their day to day lifestyle and manage their risk accordingly.
2920,Many vaccinated people have children and elderly parents and don‚Äôt realize that they can still catch and transmit covid to the latter.
2921,"&gt; Reinstating a mask mandates puts a burden on service industry workers

2923,That doesn't put the burden on any service industry workers.
2924,"In any case, a mask mandate puts as much of a burden on employees as a vaccine mandate, if it is enforced."
2925,I feel that people overestimated how quickly vaccines would end the pandemic (or if they‚Äôd end it at all).
2926,"To be clear, if delta never arose and we were still dealing with covid classic, the pandemic would likely be over already."
2927,With the vaccine hype though I‚Äôm wondering if companies just didn‚Äôt want to invest in even more testing now thinking vaccines would make it irrelevant by now (which clearly hasn‚Äôt panned out).
2928,"Sounds like ""two more weeks!"""

2947,"I know this can be confusing, but you just do not know how to read the chart you are posting."
2948,"It lists:

COVID RELATED DEATHS."
2949,"PNEUMONIA RELATED DEATHS

PNEUMONIA + COVID RELATED DEATHS

PNEUMONIA OR COVID OR INFLUENZA RELATED DEATHS."
2950,"You are focusing on the pneumonia column, that data is important for people studying this, or to show people we are tracking pneumonia separately or to track trends."
2951,Not everyone that has COVID dies due to pneumonia.
2952,"People do not die due to influenza, people do not die due to COVID itself."
2953,"They die of symptoms that are caused by, or exacerbated by an illness."
2954,People with a health heart can have a heart attack due to the severity of the illness as it is both Vascular and Respiratory.
2955,The COVID column is just COVID deaths.
2956,"The COVID + Pneumonia Column informs you of 598,000 people who died of COVID, 294,000 also developed pneumonia as the primary cause of death."
2957,"They would inform you only 50% that get COVID die of pneumonia, the rest die of other causes."
2958,"That said

2959,"241,000 pneumonia deaths is also higher then expected for the year."
2960,Like I stated.
2961,"Prior to COVID the per capita for Pneumonia related deaths was 14.9 per 100,000."
2962,"For America that means roughly, of pneumonia related deaths 50k people die."
2963,"That means of those 240k, 190k are unaccounted for."
2964,"Furthermore due to masking flu deaths are down as well, which the primary cause being pneumonia."
2965,I'm sure you can see where this is going.
2966,"REGARDLESS at the end of the day, COVID deaths are closer to 900k not 600k(Though even higher now, as we are at 630k deaths officially, official number is probably 1 million now)."
2967,The pneumonia related deaths are relatively high that are not attributed to COVID.

2997,"Very few of these people are going to take the vaccine given any amount of time, so the second we stop masking, we will be immediately back to where we are today."
2998,"Since most people do not want to mask forever, we are just delaying the inevitable."
2999,"The reason I said that their question is reasonable-ish (instead of reasonable), is that children are still not eligible, and I think it is reasonable to keep masks around until they are."
3000,"After that, the unvaccinated should be on their own."
3001,"I feel bad for the immunocompromised and people with allergies to the ingredients in the vaccines, though."
3002,They will likely need to be wearing N95s for a long time.

3025,Large pockets of the US population are much less well protected than that.
3026,To measure the danger of a virus you have to combine the fatality rate with its transmissibility.

3028,I can understand being worried about long term side effects from the vaccine.

3065,But only 2/1000 vaccinated people got sick and 2/4 unvaccinated people got sick.

3079,"But we cannot say that it is the ""best data available"" right now."
3080,Yet another example of vaccines work.
3081,"While the information I have read lately, [like this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01442-9), suggest that antibodies production due to infection remains after 11 months, one caveat I find is that these might not be as effective towards covid variants as vaccines (which can be the reason of some people getting reinfected several times)."
3082,"Furthermore, and this is based in anecdotes I have find in this sub and similars, some symptoms of ‚Äúlong-haul covid‚Äù appear to improve or disappear after vaccination."
3083,"What I really want to know is, how likely am I going to infect my unvaccinated kids if I pick up Delta while fully vaccinated?"
3084,Clearly the virus is spreading in the nursing home but it‚Äôs no biggie since thankfully they are vaxxed.
3085,So if I came home with Delta despite being vaccinated am I likely to infect the kids and any other unvaccinated people I know?

3207,That part clicked for him
3208,Getting your shot cut your chance of covid substantially.
3209,"But more importantly you also did your part to create a vaccinated population in which when we hit sufficient levels, covid cannot circulate."
3210,"You have less chance of getting covid from an infected coworker if you are vaccinated, but even less chance if your coworker does not have covid because they are vaccinated and because the person they would have caught it from was also vaccinated."
3211,"In our world a person who gets off a plane with covid can infect a lot of people, in a vaccinated world even if they still somehow brought it back from their trip they likely infect one person or no one at all, so they don't start a new circulation."
3212,What are you talking about?
3213,"No, we are not."
3214,"We remain at Level 1, no restrictions and there are no community cases."
3215,"You're literally inferring what YOU want to hear, bc you're throwing a hissy fit over not getting your way."

3244,My family saw it coming about two weeks ago and picked the mask back up.
3245,The trend is bad and we fully believe that the vaccine protects us but none of us want to get mildly to moderately sick if we can avoid it‚Ä¶no vaccine is perfect.
3246,So illness is still possible and undesirable.
3247,The mask is no big deal in comparison.
3248,"Most people are not anti-vax, though, and a sizeable fraction of people won't eat out without a mandate if cases are high."

3270,There is also one other significant difference - Israel measures any infection while UK study is for symptomatic infections.
3271,Not many aerosolizing procedures going on in classrooms so droplet protection should be fine
3272,"So to me, that says it‚Äôs more about pushing the vaccine than it is about the spread of Covid‚Ä¶

3450,But I think it does change significantly the risk calculus.
3451,"In particular, it was once believed that vaccinated people exposed to covid would be unable to asymptomatically carry and spread the virus."
3452,"Given the clustering of breakthrough positives, that prior belief seems to be either mistaken or overstated."
3453,"The fully vaccinated Texas politicians were originally three positives and are now six, and they were able to spread it to another fully vaccinated individual during a subsequent meeting in DC."
3454,"If fully vaccinated people can asymptomatically spread the virus, it's a very bad idea to have relaxed the mask guidance."
3455,Because it‚Äôs my body and get to do what I want with it
3456,"Some of us are willing to wear masks until the pandemic is *over* over, not just ‚Äúrecently vaccinated and they aren‚Äôt calling for booster shots yet‚Äù over."
3457,"If that takes a few years, I really don‚Äôt mind continuing to wear a mask even if hardly anyone else is wearing them."
3458,"The other states are some of those that are doing as badly as CA and should have mask mandates, but do not - examples of the ""much of the nation""

A whole bunch of other CA counties joined LA in the last 24 hours, now covering something on then order of 2/3 of CA population, thus the ""much of California""

3502,I have two young nephews that are missing out on vital social experience.
3503,I want them to go back to school but it's just not safe to do so.

3526,"It has also started spreading outside of a localised area, which is never good news."
3527,I think the panic comes from the lack of options or control.
3528,"States are passing laws saying that schools can't require masks, and can't ask about vaccination status."
3529,Anyone with kids can tell you a school environment is germ city.
3530,If it can be passed around it will.

3550,"Better to spread rumors based on suggestions, fear, and innuendo."
3551,God damn the vaccinated numbers are spectacular!!!
3552,It's unreal how effective these vaccines are!
3553,"Since we're talking about herd immunity, natural immunity also counts."
3554,"So, one way or another, the kids will likely acquire immunity too."
3555,Ofc I'd prefer it being from vaccines.
3556,"Well, to be honest I always thought anti vaxxors felt that way in part because of vaccines successes they didn‚Äôt see the suffering of mass infection."
3557,"However it‚Äôs right in front of their faces now and they still don‚Äôt see it, so I don‚Äôt get it honestly."
3558,Just people are bad at comparing relative risk rates (risk of getting vaccinated versus risk of getting a horrible disease)?
3559,All around it‚Äôs been basic public health messaging 101 failures.
3560,We have really shown our asses to the world with this thing.
3561,Nobody wants to be like America anymore.
3562,Yeah I fucking faithfully wore a mask until I got vaccinated.
3563,I‚Äôm done.
3564,Those dipshits that aren‚Äôt taking the vaccine are on their own.
3565,I have zero sympathy for the unvaccinated except for children who are obligated to be around idiotic adults.
3566,This.
3567,Bought a box of kid masks in preparation for school starting up and have boxes for myself already.
3568,Mask up people.
3569,The virus doesn't care if your vaccinated.
3570,It's going to infect everyone it possibly can and that's more chances to mutate.
3571,I wish people would stop with the whole seatbelt analogy/comparison.
3572,It just makes it sound like you want masks to be a permanent thing like seatbelts.
3573,It's *very* similar.
3574,"They use the same sequence, just different formulation of the nanoparticle."
3575,He should pick up the bill for his stay in the hospital instead of having everyone else pay for his choice.
3576,"&gt;	Seems like delta is much better at reproducing, which means you need a mightier immune response that some people (vaccinated or not) simply can't execute and it also means viral loads being shed are higher."
3577,This is true.
3578,But concrete numbers help us understand the magnitude here.
3579,"[Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891)

&gt;	With the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant."
3580,So the vaccine that was 93% effective before is now 88% effective.
3581,A drop in effectiveness?
3582,It sure seems like it.
3583,But just about the smallest possible drop that could be detected.

3757,America has only ~ 50 % vaccinated and zero shortages of vaccine.
3758,So this isn‚Äôt really about developed versus undeveloped countries.
3759,!remind me 80 years
3760,"Damnit, not again."
3761,I‚Äôm a mile from the Missouri state line‚Ä¶
3762,People who arent vaccinated should be put in unvaccinated camps like how the gov moved the japanese into camps in ww2
3763,"Tbf to the girl up front, there are only so many nurses, doctors and rooms available."
3764,Hard to imagine her gossiping cost your dad much time!
3765,The system isnt great (obviously) but idk what the answer is.
3766,"USA already has very well serviced and provisioned ICU space compared to most of the world.that‚Äôs why we absorbed such a ridiculously high COVID load for so long without the system breaking (only, in some spots, bending) - if Ontario had the same ICU census as we did in January, it would have been many many times over capacity."
3767,"Here, some areas were definitely under strain, but for the most part it was 120-130% levels - i.e."
3768,surge capacity.
3769,And if you don‚Äôt tap surge capacity during a once in a generation pandemic what‚Äôs the point of having it?
3770,I live in New York and in March/April it was an absolute catastrophe.
3771,"I know a lot of ICU doctors and nurses who were there the whole time, and of course I myself remember hearing sirens blaring non-stop for several weeks."
3772,"I am sure that if non-essential procedures weren‚Äôt postponed it would have been even worse, but *even in New York* the capacity held up."
3773,The field hospitals/navy ship were basically empty.
3774,"Fortunately, in the context of US hospitals (in urban areas at least) COVID turned out to be a ‚Äúbend but not break event‚Äù."
3775,"I also distinctly remember in March the predictions publicized by Cuomo were that - even accounting for mitigation measures like lockdown - hospitalizations would leak in NY at ~100,000."
3776,"Happily, turned out to be more like 20,000."
3777,Death toll absolutely horrific of course.
3778,Anyway my point isn‚Äôt that your dad didn‚Äôt have to wait extra bc of COVID patients.
3779,"I obviously have no way of knowing that, and no reason to particularly disbelieve it."
3780,Just want to flag that should be careful before assuming any issue with the American healthcare delivery system is due to strain from COVID.
3781,The system had PLENTY of issues in 2019.

3788,exactly that.
3789,"I stopped coaching and playing sports, my kids home schooled and gave up sports, we worked from home, wore masks the rare times we went out and go figure none of us got sick when normally we have a rolling cold/flu from mid september until march or april..."

3808,Really demonstrates how different Covid is from the flu
3809,"Disappointing to see influential people worried about the unvaccinated being discriminated against, especially in potentially packed venues that will become super spreader events."
3810,He should be careful at his age.
3811,The more I learn about Eric Clapton the more I despise him as a human being.

read the studies about the vaccine before just saying stuff."
3817,"we are seriously so close, we just need to keep getting people to get vaccinated."
3818,they won‚Äôt if you keep on spreading blatant misinformation
3819,"Obviously misinformation is playing a role in cases rising, but it‚Äôs also true that cases previously had decreased tremendously ‚Äúduring misinformation.‚Äù"

3834,China has only given half its population sinovac (or one of their other vaccines).
3835,And I have no doubt they'll get mRNA boosters to go follow up.
3836,&gt;thats not at all selfish.
3837,I think being selfish is demanding people wear a mask because someone who is a cancer patient might be grocery shopping at the same time as you even though you're already vaccinated and the risk of transmission is extremely low.
3838,"Everyone saying ""what about immuno compromised people!!!"""
3839,is just a BS excuse to mask shame people who did their job and got vaccinated.
3840,"You start with the sentence, ""thats \[sic\] not at all selfish"", and then go on a selfish rant."
3841,I can only shake my head and assume this is satirical?
3842,They actually did say all of that at various points.

3854,Even if cases started to rise.
3855,Most if not the vast majority of new cases are among the unvaccinated.
3856,There‚Äôs no upside in mandating masks for vaccinated people.
3857,Plus it gives little incentive to the unvaccinated to get vaccinated.
3858,Give it a month.

3880,Wondering how this is all going to play out..
3881,"Good thing I avoid my shitty family members 
 
I got covid and they never got sick."
3882,"Empathy is required for many - if you live with firmly anti-vax household members, through poverty or domestic abuse, you can't easily get vaccinated against your hosts wishes."
3883,"Plus not every uneducated person is a bigot, some truly are more afraid of the vaccines than covid, due to aggressive disinformation campaigns."

3885,Ffs this guy lol
3886,It's also still largely mandatory in my country.
3887,Vaccininated or not.
3888,Thanks.
3889,I got the Moderna vaccine.
3890,The current CDC guidelines cover that: unvaccinated people should wear masks (most places) inside.
3891,Requiring fully vaccinated people wear masks as well is just another reason to NOT get vaccinated.
3892,And I'm not talking about myself here .
3893,.
3894,.
3895,I am not going to indoor restaurants and I'm *usually* wearing a mask in public indoor places.
3896,"But I'm under no delusion that me wearing a mask indoors is reducing virus spread; I don't have the virus, I'm not likely to get the virus, and I'm even less likely to be spreading the virus."
3897,"At this point, we really have to ask ourselves tough questions."
3898,Do we even want to reduce the spread of the virus now?
3899,What is that even accomplishing in an environment where so few vaccines are being used that they are expiring?
3900,"If you think it's bad now, you ain't seen nothing."
3901,There are only two possibilities for this winter: either the Delta variant will be dominant or it will be something *even more* easily transmissible.
3902,Can you imagine going through the 2020 holiday season with the Delta variant?
3903,"This year, the vaccinated population will be a barrier to transmission to a certain extent (vs 2020), but it's still going to be bad in a lot of places."
3904,Every person who gets the virus now is a person who probably won't get it in December or January.
3905,"You're starting to see more and more ""experts"" come around to the idea that everyone is going to get it sooner or later."
3906,"If we start to get data that children under 12 are at higher risk than we think, then I can see changing the strategy, but from what we see now, the CDC and other public health officials seem to be fine letting the virus run rampant in the unvaccinated community ."
3907,.
3908,.
3909,because it will sooner or later.
3910,Heck yeah.
3911,I know I rushed right in.
3912,His track record is not good.
3913,No need to waste any benefit of the doubt in this case.
3914,the 95 in n95 stands for 95%
3915,[removed]
3916,"&gt; but 99% protection is 99% protection, regardless of what happened in the control group."
3917,"Using this logic if they did a test on an island with no covid present the vaccine would offer a 100% protection, which isn't a super interesting figure."
3918,What's more useful is to know your relative likelihood of getting covid versus someone who wasn't vaccinated.
3919, Don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs taking a stance as being anti-Vaccination.
3920,"Just lazy or ‚Äúwell, I was fine the first time, I didn‚Äôt get it, so I‚Äôm not worried‚Äù."
3921,So frustrating.
3922,Still better than how Australia's doing.
3923,How do you know this?
3924,so...source?
3925,"Good luck in ever receiving them, Moderna are millions behind here."
3926,how many more people with PhD's and peer reviewed studies do you need to understand the vaccines work better than masks and people who are vaccinated are not spreading the virus?
3927,Its completely selfish to do security theatre.
3928,Mask mandates aren't coming back on a national scale.
3929,Ever.
3930,"I thought it meant some county prohibit the requirements of proofs to enter, and I was gonna applaud"
3931,"I‚Äôm too tired to read through every comment (I tried, but this is rightly active!)"
3932,so apologies if this has been asked or addressed already.
3933,I see the New York Times‚Äô today saying 49% of the US population is fully vaccinated now.
3934,"Now Delta is tearing through and for those who survive, they will have developed varying degrees of native immunity."
3935,"Also, those who‚Äôve already recovered from having had Covid and aren‚Äôt vaccinated also add to what I‚Äôve read is called ‚Äúhybrid immunity‚Äù (a mix between vaccinated immunity and acquired immunity via contracting the disease)."
3936,"Do we know at what point we consider the entire population of both vaxxed and Covid survivors, combined, sufficient enough to make the community feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù (a relative term and measured against each person‚Äôs own health)."
3937,It seems like the message has been along the lines of (correct me if I‚Äôll wrong) ‚ÄúIf 80% of the population is vaxxed we can consider this under control‚Ä¶‚Äù or something to that extent.
3938,"Is it impossible to have it under control (as in, new variants may arise but aren‚Äôt easily spreadable and if they are, aren‚Äôt very potent/deadly) with this ‚Äúhybrid immunity‚Äù‚Äîor has that idea been proven wrong?"
3939,"I can‚Äôt find anyone talking about this right now, but maybe haven‚Äôt searched hard enough."
3940,what kind of justification for wearing a mask is ‚Äúit may help show other people it‚Äôs not weird to wear a mask‚Äù?
3941,masks were mandatory for &gt; a year during the worst of the pandemic.
3942,"if someone wants to wear one, they will."
3943,"if they don‚Äôt, they won‚Äôt."
3944,With a dash of criticism for police having patterns of being selective about which laws and rules they actually enforce and which they don't.
3945,Yes.... China and its innocent facade....
3946,you can also still get AIDS if you wear a condom so don't have sex.
3947,this sub is full of people who absolutely never want the pandemic to end.
3948,Even if its completely safe.
3949,Ding ding ding!
3950,That‚Äôs exactly why CDC said vaccinated don‚Äôt have to wear masks.
3951,To encourage a bunch of people who were never gonna get vaccinated anyway to get the vaccine.
3952,Idiotic move.
3953,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and returning to my normal life, yet that makes me the scared one?"
3954,Not the people who are fully vaccinated and still locking themselves into their homes while double-masking?
3955,The mental gymnastics here are incredible.
3956,We don‚Äôt need ‚Äúsuper scientific risk assessments‚Äù in order to return to normal.
3957,"If you‚Äôre fully vaccinated and not immunocompromised, you can choose to live your life."
3958,"I, as well as many other people in this country, am not interested in having ‚Äúofficials‚Äù tell me where I can go and what I can do as a vaccinated person."
3959,"The virus poses very little threat to me, if any."
3960,It‚Äôs been long enough.
3961,"I get that your situation makes you cautious, but that‚Äôs your own choice."

3966,"Older people are more likely to have weaker immune systems, and vaccines can be less effective for them."
3967,"A ~30% breakthrough infection rate is still very much in line with studies of COVID vaccine efficacy in people of all ages, just a bit lower since you're dealing with a population that's less protected by vaccines."
3968,"This is why it's incumbent on the younger people around those older residents to be vaccinated, since the vaccine is more likely to produce a stronger effect on them, and more likely to keep them from being infected or infecting the older folks they're around."

4005,They need to mandate the vaccine period or get with the program in implementing a vaccination passport.
4006,"I think of it less by duration and more by, ""will I be around people, particularly indoors?"""
4007,That's when I mask up.
4008,"But like you, I did have the thought that masking upsets some people because it's a very visible symbol of the pandemic."
4009,"And also like you said, COVID seems to be sticking around for a bit, so it's only counterproductive to pretend it's gone."
4010,Unfortunately these sort of nuggets of hope that stuck in our brains do not apply to the Delta.
4011,"Even, ""Kids are unaffected"" is still around, which I hope is true but already had a ten year old boy die in my town who was positive last week and hospitalized (official death cause won't be determined for some time)."
4012,I just hope that kids are still largely safe from this variant as with Alpha.
4013,I still can't believe just weeks ago I thought vaccinated people very likely were not going to spread it but I know several people just today that are fully vaccinated and positive.
4014,They will be okay and that is awesome but what the means for kids is the next question.
4015,You should be scared.

For what it's worth I get it and of course no one enjoys pessimism including myself."
4047,To be honest the line between pessimism and realism is very narrow with regards to this.
4048,It's pretty tough to think things will turn out better this winter when you can see that the overwhelming majority of people don't have much foresight or willingness to listen to those who do.

4053,Healthcare worker here.
4054,These are some of the things I've heard.

4058,"(Yeah hi hello, everyone else who tested positive today thought the same thing)

4061,"It's not covid, it's a sinus infection."
4062,4.
4063,"It's not covid, it's the normal bronchitis I get every year."
4064,5.
4065,"It's not covid, it's the flu."
4066,"(Literally have not seen a single positive flu test since March 2020)

6."
4067,It's probably covid but I thought I was immune because I had it Nov 2019-Feb 2020.
4068,"(there are a ton of people who had a nasty resp illness and chalked it up to early pandemic covid)

7."
4069,I don't care if I get covid because I'm young and healthy and I'll be fine.
4070,Yes like lockdowns for the rest of our lives.
4071,Give me security or give me death.
4072,I don‚Äôt understand his motives and it makes me reconsider him and his politics.

4074,If I have a 3 year old in a mask then I'm masking up with her.
4075,I always feel weird when we're in the store with Dad and he's not wearing a mask though haha.
4076,We're both vaccinated of course.
4077,In California all public schools have a mask mandate for indoor spaces.
4078,Interprovincial travel within Canada was banned for a good while.

4085,Masking for short trips drive me crazy.
4086,Like masking between my front door and the trash chute in the hallway.
4087,"Masking to get downstairs and out of the apt building, which takes 2 minutes and I rarely see anyone."
4088,Masking in restaurants if you go to the bathroom.
4089,Masking for an entire shopping trip is fine because I‚Äôm not messing with it constantly.
4090,And I think I might mask on the bus forever.
4091,I used to get so many colds.
4092,I think masking upsets people because it‚Äôs a obvious symbol that things aren‚Äôt normal and we are desperate to move on.
4093,Covid seems pretty comfortable so we‚Äôll just have to deal with it.
4094,Lol nah
4095,"It's reddit, conclusions will be rushed."
4096,Jokes on you.
4097,I never stopped wearing a mask even after I got vaccinated.
4098,I've already made a determination that I'll wear my mask for the rest of my life.
4099,Covid is never going away and I'm determined not to get virus from the unvaccinated.

4103,Delta is a torrential downpour.
4104,&gt;And the Delta variant is 10-times more infectious than the original SARS virus.
4105,"To put that in real terms, back when I got infected in March 2020 with the original virus, you would have to be in a closed space within three or four feet of someone for about 10 minutes to be assured of picking up the infection."
4106,"With the Delta variant, all you have to be is in contact with them for about one minute, maybe a little less, and you‚Äôll pick up this virus."
4107,"I don‚Äôt think the public has quite understood that yet, but we‚Äôre finding out in a real way."

4109,Do you smoke a lot of weed?
4110,Healthcare worker here too and I feel the same way.
4111,Especially since these people tend to be hostile and childish.
4112,"If restrictions were still in place, LA would be in California's strictest tier."
4113,"Restaurants are closing due to employees testing positive, with anecdotes of them working for days while presenting mild symptoms."
4114,"I have no problem requiring anyone handling food to wear masks, even after this is all under control."
4115,I was gonna say.
4116,Someone either can't drive or doesn't understand what a percent is.
4117,"If you get in a wreck even once in 3 years, assuming you drive EVERYDAY, that is a safety rate of 99.99908685%."

4126,All the research I've seen on past virology/pandemic history  indicates shouldikeepitup is probably right.
4127,"Most historical flu pandemics burned out by the second full year, though, so I'm optimistic about that."
4128,I am increasingly seeing this.
4129,"People are confusing vaccination for cure, when they are two completely different things."
4130,Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre being downvoted.
4131,If people have a problem or are compromised by all means stay home and wear a mask.
4132,But if you‚Äôre vaccinated who gives a fuck.
4133,Have fun and enjoy the summer.
4134,I have been going to bars and never wore a mask after vaccination.

4144,"I know it's just an expression, but it's not really that unreal that the vaccines are effective."
4145,Most vaccines that we produce are just as effective.
4146,"People think that since this vaccine took a shorter period of time to create, it should be less effective."
4147,"But the vaccine was built over years of knowledge, but too mention significant research funding last year."
4148,"This new ""of the unvaccinated"" talking point messaging is garbage."
4149,Vaccinated people can still catch and transmit covid to to others.
4150,This needs to stop.
4151,You are not alone.

4165,"Germany has very recently allowed people to get the vaccine without appointments, and enabled everyone to push appointments up from a mandatory 6 weeks to 3 or 4 weeks, for Pfizer and Moderna, respectively."
4166,[They still have 15% or about 15 million delivered doses that haven't been injected yet](https://impfdashboard.de/) because people either cancelled their appointments or don't seem to want it.
4167,"These are all pointing to the conclusion that vaccine saturation has been reached in Germany, and we need an exit strategy."
4168,"Once everyone who wants the vaccine has had a chance to get it, all restrictions to life should be removed."
4169,COVID won‚Äôt completely mutate around the vaccine because all the vaccines target the spike protein.
4170,If you‚Äôre vaccinated COVID is no longer a novel virus for you and you‚Äôre already in a much better place.
4171,In 2017 I was rushed to the ER here in the UK while having a dual-bilateral pulmonary embolism.
4172,I got right in without waiting courtesy of arriving at speed on a stretcher.
4173,Then I spent about five hours there being attended to while they figured out what to do until finally I got a bed on the ward sometime in the late evening.
4174,"I did feel bad for being there so long, but weirdly time passed quickly for me because I was having pure oxygen blown into me, making me feel somewhat high."
4175,Turns out I have a genetic predisposition to blood clots.
4176,I honestly don't understand how people can gamble with covid.

4188,"(It's also why I picked Moderna, for the bigger dosage.)"
4189,I've seen enough stories like this that I'm still wearing masks indoors in public.
4190,I don't consider it hard or particularly unpleasant.
4191,The only unpleasant thing is wondering if somebody's going to be a pest and fake cough around you or do some other passive-aggressive baby move.

4199,Randomized clinical trials show no statistically significant reduction in transmission of influenza and other upper respiratory viruses from wearing medical/surgical masks in a community setting.
4200,"It's more likely that influenza was almost non existent because of sharply curtailed international travel, social distancing effects, and viral interference."
4201,How is that political though?
4202,Sounds like bad strategy to me.
4203,I am lucky in that my county and state are ahead of the game with about 70% fully vaccinations.
4204,We are lacking in Hispanic and Black communities however.
4205,Me and my mom work in healthcare.
4206,I don‚Äôt know the numbers of fully vaccinated people who are testing positive but I know my healthcare company has had one and my moms facility has had one.
4207,We are still required to wear masks at our workplace despite not working with patients.
4208,That's a fair point.
4209,I'm not being facetious then do vaccinated people (with no unvaxable dependents like kids or immune suppressed) literally just dgaf and carry on mask-less?

4278,This is not an issue that can be mitigated effectively by the USA right now.
4279,The truth is that the USA is among the more heavily vaccinated nations on Earth.
4280,Most adults here have been vaccinated.
4281,"Abroad in mot places, vaccines remain rare and the vast majority of the population is unvaccinated, with many of the few who are having received far less effective vaccines."

4403,"&gt;every breakthrough case is a opportunity for COVID to learn how to mutate around the vaccine

You're not wrong, but where the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer are concerned, I'm not sure if it's even possible for Covid to mutate its way around them."
4404,"My understanding is that the Coronavirus has a spike protein that acts like a key and allows it to latch onto cells in our body and hijack them, which is how it reproduces."
4405,"The mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, are instructions using messenger RNA (hence the name) that are able to do what regular vaccines can't, which is specifically tell white blood cells to target cells with that exact spike protein."
4406,"So in order for a Covid cell to mutate around that, it would have to either change the spike protein or lose it altogether, which should then mean that the issue resolves itself because the virus no longer has the skeleton key that let it through in the first place."
4407,"TL;DR: In order for Covid to mutate around mRNA vaccines, it would either have to become an entirely different virus or just lock itself out of our bodies altogether."
4408,Edit: Someone feel free to correct me if I'm understanding it wrong
4409,Get a Brita pitcher filter.
4410,The filters are cheap and last for months!
4411,That not how the immune system works.
4412,A vaccine doesn't put a physical barrier in your nose.
4413,The viral anitgens still enter your body and try to replcate.
4414,"Your immune system, having either circulating IgG antibodies or B memory cells producing antibodies then mount a response to kill off the virus before it has a chance to replicate sufficiently for you to exhibit symptoms."
4415,"Now consider that various people have different strength immune systems, with some more compromised than others."
4416,"Also, different people produce different antibody titer levels in response to the vaccine (seroconversion)."
4417,Now it should be clear why it's only 95% protection (and much lower for delta variant) and why vaccinated people can still exhibit viral shedding (being contagious).
4418,That‚Äôs why their mask mandate is idiotic.
4419,I bet 90% of non-household transmission comes from restaurants and bars.
4420,[removed]
4421,Im sorry to hear that.

4427,"I think you misunderstood the doctor, they are saying the vaccine is not a cure and cannot help them now."
4428,They are trying to help them breathe and survive.
4429,If they survive the ordeal they will have a natural defense against covid.
4430,"But a vaccine is not a cure, it is an instruction for the body to give it the tools to recognize an invasive and dangerous virus."
4431,"If the body is in full battle mode, the virus has already been overwhelming  the body."
4432,All its defenses already knows of the virus.
4433,And can recognize it.
4434,"A vaccine works by showing the body the virus, there are different ways of doing so."
4435,Often slightly changed virus is used to instruct the body so its defenses can be updated to recognize the enemy.
4436,The virus used in vaccines is made weaker and way less dangerous.
4437,But you should not give the body a vaccine when it is already trying to handle the invading virus.It is like telling the good soldiers who the enemy is by allowing more of them in the country that is being overwhelmed already.
4438,Like having to take a class on the enemy flag while in the middle of fighting them.
4439,"The class is not completely useless but it is 
extremely bad timing and the effort could cost you the war."
4440,So giving people that are in serious trouble because of an viral infection a vaccine is a terrible idea.
4441,It could make it way worse if there is any effect at all.
4442,"All the doc can do is assist with oxygen, some supportive medication and care."
4443,So its not about telling them ‚Äúthis is on you‚Äù this is about explaining to the patient what is happening and the limitations on what can be done.
4444,The covid
4445,Incredible.
4446,So you‚Äôll say confidently you don‚Äôt trust the CDC Guidance that is based in science?
4447,Literally every expert.
4448,They didn't use those terms but that's what it boiled down to.
4449,"You can get it, but you'll almost certainly be fine."
4450,Just like if you catch the flu.
4451,Or a cold I suppose if you prefer that comparison.
4452,"I used the flu because you CAN still die from it, it's just unlikely."
4453,Gosh this isn't a hyper hybrid killer bot.
4454,It is a virus.
4455,People gain immunity and fight it off.
4456,Nothing indicate that this isn't the case.
4457,You are just scaremongering
4458,Same thing happens with common cold infection.
4459,When someone has a cold and insists on coming to class/work and you're exposed to them for a few minutes you might feel off for a bit afterwards.
4460,"You have been infected and now it's a race between your immune system (immunity, cross-immunity, innate immune response) fighting it off and the virus avoiding your immune system and replicating as far as whether you get sick or not."
4461,"Btw, your out of thin air numbers are drastically low and exaggerated numbers are propaganda and not constructive."
4462,Absolutely agree.
4463,The issue was and is about children spreading covid to those more vulnerable
4464,Probably so they could not be blamed when they are not delivering.
4465,Sputnik has massively oversold their vaccines.
4466,It seems like a great vaccine but their production is no where up to scale.
4467,And entitled!

4512,"To be specific, 90 of that 95% number we've heard so much about was the blocking of contraction of the disease at all."
4513,"Most of the time, it bounces right off of you."

4515,"What was a 10% hospitalization for the general unvaccinated population, becomes 5% for the vaccinated population."
4516,Add the 90% from blocking contraction (90+5) and you get 95% efficacy.
4517,"This is important because with all the outbreaks we see in some vaccinated pockets, it is clear that this virus can and does spread among vaccinated people."
4518,"Certainly at a much slower rate than unvaccinated people, but still it's a thing."
4519,"And if cases in the whole community are really high and there's just a lot of it floating around, even vaccinated people should take practical measures to not unnecessarily expose themselves."

5053,The Ministry of Health (VWS) is appealing a recent court ruling on the Open Government Act (Wob).
5054,The judge ruled that the ministry's modus operandi during the coronapandemic was not in accordance with the law.
5055,"Arnout le Clercq21 July 2021, 22:16

Wob requests must be considered individually, the court ruled at the end of June."
5056,"In doing so, the court overruled the ministry's crisis working method."
5057,"Under penalty of a fine, the ministry must comply with the Wob requests quickly (within a few months)."
5058,"In a letter to the House of Representatives, however, outgoing minister De Jonge writes that the court's ruling is ""not enforceable."
5059,The ministry also has no intention of fundamentally changing its working methods.
5060,"The ministry will appeal, with which De Jonge goes against the majority in Parliament that previously determined that he must comply with the court ruling."
5061,Professor of Constitutional and Administrative Law Wim Voermans (Leiden University) finds it 'remarkable'.
5062,'Actually the minister is saying about the ruling: we're not going to do this.'
5063,"According to Voermans, it is typical of the 'resistance attitude' that the government has towards the Wob."
5064,"'But it's not a service, it's a civil right.'"
5065,"Since the outbreak of the corona crisis, the ministry has adopted a new way of dealing with the Wob."
5066,This law normally enables citizens to request documents from the government.
5067,"In practice, journalists in particular make use of the Wob."
5068,But because of the crisis there would not have been time to deal with all Wob requests individually.
5069,Or as De Jonge put it in a parliamentary debate in April 2020: 'I'm not going to ask the fire department to get behind the computer.
5070,I want the fire department to be out there putting out fires.
5071,"Portions, chosen by the ministry, of corona policy information are instead made public once in a while."
5072,"'A traditional approach would result in the requested information being made public later and in a fragmented way,' De Jonge again defends his policy in the Parliamentary letter."
5073,"Waiting more than a year
The judge ruled otherwise."
5074,"According to the law, Wob requests must be handled and answered individually."
5075,The alternative method used by the ministry does not meet this requirement.
5076,"The current affairs programme Nieuwsuur, among others, brought a case because its editors had been waiting for more than a year for a Wob request to be granted."
5077,De Volkskrant also recently went to court over a Wob request that had been outstanding.
5078,"In his letter, De Jonge states that the workload of the more than 200 Wob requests currently being processed by the Ministry is too great."
5079,"Five million documents have been collected, of which two million remain after ""cleansing""."
5080,These still have to be assessed as to their content.
5081,The Ministry will not be able to meet the two-month deadline imposed by the judge.
5082,"The penalty payment ignores 'the great efforts' that have been made, according to De Jonge."
5083,"'They have done nothing for a year and a half,' says Voermans."
5084,'This is overdue maintenance.'
5085,"The government is trying to shift the problem to the submitters of the Wob: they are saddling the ministry with extra work, is the minister's thought."
5086,"And that is not the intention, says Voermans."
5087,Suppose you go to the library and you want to have Hermans' Never sleep again.
5088,The librarian doesn't say: 'But do you know how many books we have?
5089,Journalists' questions just have to be dealt with.'
5090,At the moment thirty lawyers are working on the Wob requests.
5091,"In the coming period, fifty more lawyers must be recruited for the job."
5092,"During a technical briefing, a senior official said that the goal is to eventually 'harass' the journalists who have submitted a Wob with information."
5093,It should be known in September when exactly that will happen.
5094,"With the appeal, the issue 'could last for years' Voermans estimates."
5095,'I call it sabotage of the law.'

5127,"Most people who haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine probably don‚Äôt believe the virus isn‚Äôt real ‚Äî there are probably some people who believe that, but it‚Äôs largely a straw man."
5128,"They‚Äôre a mix of people who think the virus isn‚Äôt so serious (or isn‚Äôt likely serious for them ‚Äîyounger demographics have worse vaccine uptake), who still have concerns about the safety or efficacy of a vaccine, and who sort of will get vaccinated eventually if the situation calls for it but have very little motivation to actually get it done."
5129,"I don't blame her, there is a lot of conflicting information about mask for the vaccinated out there."
5130,Because a third shot wouldn't necessarily improve immunity that much.
5131,"On the other hand, you risk triggering auto-immune reactions because you've hyped the immune system up so much but it has nothing to attack."
5132,"It's unclear how many would benefit, how many would have no reaction, and how many could go into auto-immune activation with a third shot."
5133,"The ""flu-like symptoms"" people were having with the two-dose vaccine regimens were the immune system activating."
5134,Not sure you wanna subject a ton of people to a third dose as the symptoms are only going to escalate (when given a short amount of time after the other shots.
5135,"If immunity does wane over time, then one could plausibly give successive doses."
5136,But we don't have that data yet.).
5137,"Additionally, for people who are immuno-compromised or do not otherwise generate a good immune response with the vaccine, another dose won't fix that."
5138,These people depend on herd immunity to squash the spread of the virus.
5139,That's why the rather significant portion of the population that isn't getting vaccinated is so concerning.

5176,MIT technology review says the data is unclear.
5177,"Another suggests 0-27% of children (echoing the ""unclear"" sentiment) have at least one symptom after 6 months."
5178,That's of the small percentage who develop any illness at all.
5179,"If you have reliable/peer-reviewed data to the contrary, I'd be happy to take a look."
5180,I mean the vaccine is available to every adult American.
5181,Nearly everyone could be vaccinated but they choose not to because often because of the horse shit they ingest from conservative media and social media.

5226,"Then Delta started creeping into our state and I keep up with the news on the virus and was hearing about what it did to India and what it was starting to do to thoroughly vaxxed Israel, and back on my mask went."
5227,"It doesn't bother me and makes me feel pretty good that with two Modernas and an N95 I'm pretty damn well protected when I'm out surrounded by strangers, most not vaccinated as my county isn't even 40% vaxxed."
5228,I've been looking for work out of state and the complete negligence and stubbornness against vaccination in my region of the country has me looking at areas where people are a little smarter.
5229,"You don't have to go anywhere particular to find that, such behavior is everywhere."
5230,Yep but delta will burn through and that‚Äôll be that lol

5240,Only half of the country has been vaccinated and the vaccinated can still spread it.
5241,The CDC just sacrificed kids for politics
5242,Basically double digits cases for the last year.
5243,"I don't know why this is surprising to anyone, whenever there's an outbreak somewhere they have the military welding doors shut and patrolling the streets and building on demand quarantine hospitals outside the city limits in a week."
5244,"They test aggressively and often, the population are used to wearing masks, they have an infinite supply of domestially manufactured vaccines and medical supplies, of course they have low case numbers."

5253,"When they ran out of beds during the height of the pandemic,  they picked and choose who lived and who died based on age, family status etc."
5254,This hospital ran out of beds so they will need pick and choose who is taken care of and who is sent home.
5255,Do you intake a child with a traumatic head injury that needs monitoring over night or a someone who didn‚Äôt bother to vaccinated  and is covid positive while having trouble breathing

5272,We are shooting our selves in the foot again.
5273,This just gives more ammunition to the anti vax crowd.

5275,I will not wear a mask again - I did my part and got my vaccine.
5276,I‚Äôm tired of protecting others.
5277,"Everything he said in your quotes were from a POLITICIAN, not a medical expert."
5278,He told us NOT to wear masks because he was afraid everyone would hoard them like they did toilet paper.
5279,The facts: people are too f#cking stupid and stubborn to follow doctor advice when they can listen to redneck uncle Jimbo or some nut on OAN.
5280,Rituals and everyday habits arr frankly more important than your neighbor's life.
5281,Your rituals are more important than ur family's life.

5324,Whatever happened to ‚Äúherd immunity?‚Äù
5325,Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 (coronavirus) are very different types of viruses.
5326,If everyone got their god-send of a vaccine we could put this whole thing in the rear view.
5327,Unfortunately because national vax rates are &lt;50% this poses a very real risk of vaccinated folks becoming unknowing vectors for the virus or getting mild cases.
5328,The real trouble begins when unvaccinated idiots get it and turn into a mutagenesis factory while fighting the infection.

That happened one time total in New London CT."
5353,It was a highly qualified older applicant and the department didn‚Äôt want to hire someone older than 40 since they feared they‚Äôd leave sooner than normal after the cost of training had been paid.
5354,That kind of reasoning age is discrimination and is illegal.
5355,So they sorted through his packet and found he scores highest on the IQ test out of all applicants.
5356,So they denied him the job for being too smart since being intelligent isn‚Äôt a protected class.
5357,It went to court and the town lied straight faced to the judges and they won since their stated rationale wasn‚Äôt illegal.

5413,"The viral load from an infected vaccinated person is significantly lower, as I understand it."
5414,I make my own kids mask on the rare occasions we go out.
5415,And mask up with them to make them feel less alone.
5416,"I keep hearing we need to mask up ‚Äúfor the kids,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not so sure."

5424,But they‚Äôve stopped caring for those who willingly don‚Äôt want to protect themselves .
5425,"It sounds nice caring for everyone, but realistically I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to care so much about people who don‚Äôt want to help themselves."

5450,Me and my husband have been fully vaccinated and we still wear a mask and face shield when we go out here in SEA.
5451,Could it be the difference in the variants.
5452,Alpha you were less likely to pass on than delta
5453,"As a health care worker, I agree."

5455,I think it's also important for those of us vaccinated to use the environment around us to make decisions.

5457,"If you see that no one in town, in a store, etc is wearing a masks, and you know that only 36% of your county is vaccinated, then you can reasonably deduce that it would be a good idea to continue wearing one."

5459,Teachers are incredibly melodramatic about the difficulty of their jobs and how people treat them.

5467,15 minutes is often not enough time to stand in line at the checkout counter of a grocery store.
5468,30 minutes (everyone masked) makes a huge difference.
5469,And not all cloth masks are created equal.
5470,The ones with double or triple layers filter better.
5471,Some also have a metal nose piece for better fitment.
5472,As you see from your chart proper fitting (proper seal) is crucially important - proper donning and doffing procedure.
5473,"Even if it needs another dose, it‚Äôs no big deal they‚Äôve got tons of it."
5474,"Who knows if it even dose, I mean it seemed widely used (or at least as widely used as it was) in this area and there really is no evidence of it being statistically any worse than any of the other vaccines."
5475,All this does is fuel anti vaxxers.
5476,For under 12 kids the risk from covid is lower than the risk from the normal flu because of some science reason having to do with the way covid interacts with the body.
5477,If kids are able to be out during the flu season without masks in a normal year there's no reason they have to wear them now unless they're in a country with slow vaccine rollouts where they might transmit the virus to someone at risk.

5492,Part of me was surprised but at the same not really.
5493,Vaccine is readily available everywhere but from my understanding some of the harder hit areas tend to have the lowest vax rates.
5494,A few of my coworkers didn't want to get it because they already had it and no big deal.
5495,But one already got it twice and was gone for months the second time and now considering getting it.

5498,To be fair this was back in May and I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs changed his stance since.
5499,"Regardless though, the same can be said about most RNA viruses."
5500,They mutate often.
5501,It‚Äôs not exclusive to COVID-19.
5502,So should we mask up forever to save us from these ongoing mutations from not just COVID but other viruses?
5503,"I don‚Äôt think so, because thankfully, we have a vaccine that still currently holds up against this particular virus‚Äôs most advanced mutation - and I hope this continues."
5504,I'm not upset.
5505,I'm annoyed with your illogical arguments.
5506,"Again, this isn't hard."
5507,Vax gives you 80% against infection (even asymptomatic but still transmissible) versus Delta.

5529,"Ok, no need to get upset."
5530,I wasn't saying you shouldn't wear a mask.
5531,You can do whatever you want my dude.
5532,"All I was asking was, given that protection for yourself while wearing a mask is negligible compared to the protection it gives others from the you (the wearer), if you deem it prudent enough to wear out to gain that small boost of protection to yourself, wouldn't it follow logically that you would wear it all the time to get the much larger boost of protection from giving it to others?"

5560,All the media scaremongering doesn't change the science.
5561,Just because all the antivaxxers are finally paying the piper doesn't mean things are actually getting worse.
5562,Deaths and hospitalizations are way down and vaccinated people are at about as much risk as they would be from the seasonal flu.
5563,"Case numbers mean nothing in this context, the only thing that matters now is vaccine number and serious illness, which are both improving."
5564,The cases happening now are not from vaccinated people.
5565,Over 98% of covid hospitalization are unvaccinated.
5566,Fauci was warning the vaccinated that there's still that chance they might catch it.

5568,So what was your point?
5569,You should see these same people in my clinic.

5581,&gt;It‚Äôs not exactly a big burden.
5582,"It shouldn't be, but in some places people have gotten shot over asking people to wear masks."
5583,There are different levels of caution.
5584,Most people by now aren't wiping down groceries.
5585,My understanding is that there is little evidence to show that COVID is transmitted through contact.
5586,So it makes sense to stop wiping things.
5587,One could argue that it doesn't take that much effort to continue wiping down groceries.
5588,I think here the main frustration is that the CDC essentially said vaccinated people are done with the pandemic.
5589,"It seems irresponsible, as it is hard to walk back."
5590,"Mainly, it is just confusing."
5591,The last time I was in the grocery store everyone was wearing a mask except for the employees and a man in scrubs.
5592,I just don't think this bodes well for a strong collective response to the pandemic.
5593,"Seeing our low vaccination rates though, this might already be out the window."
5594,"Largely, I just ask people around me, especially employees, if they would prefer I wear a mask."
5595,I agree it isn't a big burden to wear a face mask.
5596,"I am more concerned about implications for close gatherings, number of close contacts, staying 6 feet, etc."
5597,Exactly this.
5598,"I had an older person in FL today tell me he was 99% sure he wouldn‚Äôt get it, so that may be another reason as ridiculous as it is."
5599,"We have been riding on a full covid wave since December, we never had the chance to decrease our daily cases to less than 10k or less than 500 deaths daily since then..."
5600,No
5601,What I don't get is why people are being weird about this.
5602,Even if it was an overabundance of caution what's it matter to you?
5603,The whole world just went through a pandemic we knew little about.

5663,"In regards to people sweating, breathing heavy, touching equipment regularly thats true but for those who take precautions:

(wear a mask, wipe down every part of the aforementioned equipment you will use and then if you somehow get the virus exposed on your hands it does nothing unless you bring it up to your eyes to scratch them or your nose to inhale it or mouth) but again either way you shouldnt be doing that at the gym in the first place lol."
5664,You wont get covid.
5665,"I've been going for 6 months and have been covid free taking precautions, wearing a mask, keeping a distance with people, washing every part of equipment with the spray the gym provides, making sure not to touch my face, eyes, or mouth after touching the equipment."

I have an 18 month old son at home."
5703,I also have an at risk sister (vaccinated mid 30s) who takes care of a 93 year old woman refusing the vaccine and my in laws (over weight mid 60s) all vaccinated but living outside the home.
5704,"However, they do watch my son so I can work and keep him out of daycare (for now its becoming too hard and he starts in 2 weeks)."
5705,We all interact on a daily basis basis.
5706,My son's pediatrician reccomended me and my husband continue to mask up even though we are vaccinated due to delta (we are in Florida) surging and our low community vaccine rate.
5707,"We only do outdoor activities in areas with less crowds (playground in the morning, zoo when it first opens and keeping distance)."
5708,Nothing indoors for the kiddo yet.
5709,"We were taking him to the store when it's less busy, but our pediatrician said to stop."
5710,"My in laws, even though they are vaccinated (Pfizer and Moderna) do a lot of high risk activities."
5711,"No masks, parties, travel by plane to other high surge areas, ect."
5712,"After I told them my pediatrician told us to mask up for their grandsons sake, they claim to have gone back to masking."
5713,My sister always masks as well and never stopped because she watches my son.
5714,My husband is an essential employee (mechanic) he wears a mask at work.
5715,We try to do curbside pick up whenever possible.
5716,I'm going back to teach in person at a university that has no mask mandates or vaccines.
5717,I will be upgrading to Kn95s.
5718,We forgo house parties and because of it have lost a lot of friends.
5719,We never get invited anymore.
5720,Which most are unvaccinated.
5721,We try to cut down contact with other non vaccinated individuals outside of work.
5722,Honestly this is the best we can do.
5723,Considering where we work and live....I dont know.
5724,I feel for you.
5725,I felt that way too until I saw the coviv19 positive Reddit where fully vaccinated people are suffering from Covid too.
5726,Now I‚Äôm worried for everyone.
5727,The strategy is so close to optimal that I have not been contacted about an appointment and neither has my wife.

5755,Since when do politicians give a shit about what we think
5756,"&gt; Infection numbers don‚Äôt matter 

Every expert in the field disagrees with you."
5757,"I agree that its important to see how many people are dying and how/why they are dying, but to pretend infection numbers don't matter during a pandemic is just being willfully ignorant."
5758,either way what does that have to do with other people being vaccinated?
5759,if he had a bad reaction how does that effect literally anyone else?
5760,"people are acting like hes taking some legitimate stance against something when its really not the case at all, hes just being a dimwitted asshole because hes eric clapton and coincidentally has always been a dimwitted asshole"

5765,Just seems like human nature to me.
5766,"Well, apparently there are some known cases wherein fully vaccinated people contract the virus but remain non-symptomatic."
5767,Masks might still be wise in some special situations.
5768,"Lockdowns are unfair and far too extreme because they affect everyone regardless of age, vaccination status and personal health."
5769,"Also domestic vaccine passports will be kept even when the threat of covid is pretty much nil, they‚Äôre a bad idea."
5770,Might be assuming too much for Texas there.
5771,Don't think we get that type of information in Florida either.

5778,Right now we've been doing okay in upstate NY and the restrictions on visitors have been dropped.
5779,My father just spent two months in the hospital due to a few different infections.
5780,"While I do believe a lot of this was caused by the hospital being terrible, he wouldn't be with us today if this happened during Covid or if the hospital was very full."
5781,NY didn't have any visitation hours for a year.
5782,"If we were not allowed to visit him, we wouldn't have discovered that he had a 106\* fever or that he has aspiration pneumonia."
5783,We wouldn't have noticed his neurological decline.
5784,They would have just let him die from the infection.
5785,"While it's bad it happened ,I 'm glad it didn't happen during covid restrictions or if the hospital was overwhelmed and gave him even *less* attention."
5786,Same.

5791,I think it's going to have to affect each of them individually before reality sets in.
5792,I've had Covid and I've had the flu.
5793,They felt very similar.
5794,I was asked how it FELT TO ME.
5795,I was not saying they are the same at all.
5796,There are a lot of adults who have grown up obligated to be around idiotic adults and still are.
5797,"When your entire peer group thinks something is bad, human nature is to not do that thing, regardless of what your rational nature may say."
5798,This is a failure of conservative voices to put health above partisan politics.
5799,"Had Trump won, these vaccines would be a moonshot miracle that he made happen and they would be full steam ahead, but now that vaccines are associated with Biden, they would rather turn their plebs against him."

A lot of people made the same mistake when comparing Pfizer and Moderna to JnJ when their numbers originally came out."
5805,Their definitions of 'efficacy' were different from the beginning!
5806,lol
5807,I guess the crux of my question is what activities do you feel ok doing while living under the same roof as them?
5808,Like would you go to an indoor concert if you wore a good mask and kinda stayed back from people?
5809,There is not a ‚Äúgood chance.‚Äù Masks alone are far worse than vaccines alone in terms of spread.
5810,I‚Äôm not afraid enough of colds or the flu to keep wearing a mask.
5811,I don‚Äôt think I ever once changed my behavior in life out of fear of the flu so I don‚Äôt see why that would change now.

1."

5822,2.

5882,Depends on the individual case but in general the American Heart Association recommends that people with heart conditions get it.
5883,"&gt; 
&gt; On January 15, 2021, the American Heart Association released a statement urging all eligible individuals to get vaccinated to keep themselves, their family and their community healthy and safe:
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúAs a science-based organization committed to health equity, we are heartened that COVID-19 vaccines have been approved to protect individuals, their loved ones and their communities from the pandemic."
5884,"The American Heart Association ‚Äì which has been carefully tracking COVID-19 and its disproportionately negative effects on older adults; people with underlying medical conditions; and Black, LatinX and American Indian/Alaska Native people ‚Äì strongly encourages everyone to get vaccinated with any approved COVID-19 vaccine as it is available."
5885,"&gt; 
&gt; In particular, **people with cardiovascular risk factors, heart disease, and heart attack and stroke survivors should get vaccinated as soon as possible because they are at much greater risk from the virus than they are from the vaccine."

5888,Fauci and crew need to give a rest!
5889,The nervous just aren't as loud as the idiots.
5890,Ohh *Now* he's being honest about masks.
5891,By that logic the best thing you can do is social distance actively.
5892,Far more effective than a mask which probably has very little efficacy if no one else is wearing one.
5893,How would it work?
5894,How could the vaccine impact fertility?
5895,It‚Äôs the same in Spain.
5896,I had to fly home to Germany to get vaccinated.
5897,Getting an appointment if you are not in the system is a massive pain.
5898,Until they open walk in clinics many ppl will not be able to get vaccinated.
5899,"Ehhhhh‚Ä¶ mask culture is not that uncommon in Asia, particularly East Asia where it‚Äôs pretty much encouraged to mask up during the polluted air season (Jan-Apr)."
5900,Maybe that‚Äôs why we never really had the issue of anti-mask politics when COVID-19 first arrived.
5901,he‚Äôs been a sack of shit since the 70s
5902,Elderly people will not have fun with that.
5903,That's why  under 50s need to do the right thing.

5906,I'm sorry that happened to you
5907,"Oh I know that, but I what I mean is most people know if say you get bit by a bat that may have been exposed you *can* get the rabies vaccine and it will have some efficacy."
5908,That just isn‚Äôt true for other things and I think people may be conflating them.
5909,I think any federal mask mandate at this point would be another blow to the effort to vaccinate as well as pure theatre.
5910,I think (maybe I‚Äôm being naive)  the administration knows that as well and I could see a ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù similar to Fauci‚Äôs particularly for those who are compromised or older to take the extra step..but I doubt CDC will reverse guidance for vaccinated people.
5911,I think some more localities will implement masks again.
5912,That‚Äôs not how vaccinations work.
5913,We don‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose to lessen our risk‚Äù of getting measles or polio by getting individually vaccinated.
5914,We vaccinate 90%+ of people and the collective effect protects us.

6050,"So many people in these articles apply the math completely wrong, quite possibly on purpose to make the vaccines look better (and they don't need to, the vaccines are already great!)."
6051,Calculations should not use breakthrough cases over the number of vaccinated individuals as most of these individuals have not been exposed to COVID.
6052,"Attempting to calculate efficiency this way is essentially computing a cumulative risk that can only increase over time, which is not a very good trait when trying to measure efficiency."
6053,The proper way to calculate efficiency is 1 - (breakthrough cases/vaccinated population)/(unvaccinated cases/vaccinated population).
6054,"However, to do this, you need to know the number of breakthrough cases and unvaccinated cases in a timeframe where the number of people vaccinated is relatively stable."
6055,"Instead, all of these articles tend to give the total number of breakthrough cases of all time, which complicates calculating the actual efficiency."
6056,"Once you have efficiency, the other key is the formula:  
risk = (1 - efficiency) \* prevalence 

In other words, an increase in prevalence increases the risk to vaccinated people."

6142,You can *feel* however you want but I'm looking at the actual data and following the CDC guidelines.
6143,The CDC guidelines as they are now recommend to wear a mask if you're vaccinated only in high exposure areas and the delta variant for the vaccinated is not highly contagious or that serious in most cases.
6144,For us it now is comparable to the flu or a cold.
6145,The flu or cold can also cause long term damage or even death but again I'm not going to wear a mask and avoid social gatherings in fear from that.

6148,Charge lots of money for kooky stuff and let people claim that vaccines are against their religion truthfully (and capitalistically).
6149,Is it me or is everyone changing their tone now.
6150,If these type of people are finally encouraging vaccination then that is a huge win!

6175,It was still more likely to be due to masks that don't filter and/or seal well (if they were masked 100% of the time).
6176,The amount inhaled would still be way more than the amount from a surface that then gets into a person's system in the way needed to get infected.

6178,"Of course, surfaces can still be in issue for pathogens but it's easy to mitigate that risk with hand sanitizer and washing, especially before eating."

6183,"Our Schools are generally very crowded, and many have reduced or eliminated social distancing requirements."
6184,Masks and Social distancing help reduce viral loads.
6185,"I'm not arguing that kids aren't at lower risk, but the concern is the relaxing of Social distancing and mask wearing among unvaccinated people, combined with new variants could lead not only to more spread among kids, but more serious cases."

6232,He didn't have much rebuttal.
6233,"Thats not an assumption, it should be possible for a mutation to occur in a vaccinated and immune person (especially if they developed a poor immune response), however it is significantly less probable than someone without a vaccination who has no sort of immunity."
6234,It's a time and numbers game when it comes to mutations.
6235,"If you're vaccinated, there's less chance for a mutation occurring because your immune system will target the non-mutated variations it recognizes and neutralize them  before they get a chance to replicate."
6236,Less viruses replicating and doing so for shorter time periods reduces the chance/opportunities of a mutation occurring that your immune system doesn't recognize.
6237,"For unvaccinated people when the virus enters you're basically going to be an efficient factory pumping out replications, some of which will have mutated (many harmless, some reducing their transmissibiliy, some increasing their transmissibility)."
6238,"If you're vaccinated, you're a factory with a security team that identifies the intruder and quickly kicks them out."
6239,The intruder may have pumped out a few copies of themselves but they did it far fewer times before they were neutralized.
6240,"Less replication, less chance of mutation."
6241,"Now multiply those little mutation factories for every person unvaccinated and you see how one of those replications just might, through evolutionary processes, create a slightly varied version of itself that all our vaccinated immune systems are currently targeting."
6242,"Vaccination isn't a silver bullet to this, no, but it's a bazooka at least."
6243,"It's less likely but it's possible, yeah, especially if new variants come about because they need allowing COVID to circulate."

3.- the needles for the covid shots are actually smaller than the average, just try to look away, I'm pretty sure most of US are anxious about needles

4.-it sucks that You still have to use masks indoors I thought that didnt happen un the US anymore, Buy some cookies or chips with those $10 idk lol, if it helps as a perk, here in M√©xico I'm still not eligible for the shot but I'd drive hours to get the shot, you have easy access to something billions want around the world"

6807,The Spanish flew and covid are not 100% comparable like that.
6808,First the Spanish flu had a much higher mortality rate killing off its victims rather than letting them spread it as easily as covid.
6809,With covid many young people barely feel symptoms and can spread it for days/weeks without ever knowing.
6810,And secondly travel was much more limited in 1918 than it is in 2020/2021.
6811,People can hop all around the world in less than a day now keeping covid from ever truly going extinct naturally.

6830,"Poor Argentina, they have had such a rough go of it."
6831,You would hope the strong advice of the medical community would be more than enough.
6832,You wear masks to protect others that haven't been vaccinated (you can still spread it if vaccinated!)
6833,and to protect yourself against the small possibility of a bad response to exposure to Delta.
6834,You do know the next excuse is the FDA answers to the pharmaceutical industry and shouldn‚Äôt be trusted?

6843,Yes.
6844,Yes it is.
6845,Or you forget all those vaccines you have to take to go to school.
6846,I'm team mandatory masks - which has been my point of this whole convo.
6847,"Probably because of 3 reasons:

* Decreasing of suppressive measures (masks, restrictions, social distancing, etc.)."
6848,* Not having herd immunity (the unvaccinated play a role here).
6849,* Increasing amounts of delta variant.

6851,One really big problem is that Florida is a tourist destination.
6852,The state has low vaccination rates in several regions and as a result many tourists from places that are not vaccinated are getting the Delta variant and bringing it back home.
6853,"It's a non-virtual feedback loop that is causing many deaths and suffering

In fact, an audit really needs to be done and how much Covid spread was caused in the early days from travelers going to and leaving from Florida."
6854,"Some Florida officials like Di Santis like to brag that their strategy worked the best and keep comparing it to states like California, but they discount the multiplier effect from tourism in a state that paid no attention to masks, business closings, beach closings, etc."
6855,The tragedy brought on by denial of this virus and the vaccine to protect against it is almost too hard and large to comprehend.

6862,"I have read though that if you are vaccinated and asymptomatic, transmissibility goes way down."
6863,Can anyone confirm or at least heard the same thing?
6864,r/nottheonion
6865,"I've never heard of a doctor giving an exemption, I heard of people ""saying"" doctors told them not to get vaccinated, but they never have anything to show for."
6866,Mysteriously doctors don't want to write anything about it.
6867,"But if it was a legit exemption, justified for real medical reasons, then sure."
6868,"If you are allergic, there are alternatives."
6869,"If you are so immuno-compromised that you can't take a shot, you shouldn't be talking to me in person."
6870,Sigh‚Ä¶.idiots like these make me cringe‚Ä¶he ought to opt for an above middle school level education first‚Ä¶
6871,Because antibodies naturally decline over time.
6872,The beauty of the immune system is once they do if you‚Äôre infected again your B and T Cells remember how to form a response to it and signals the production of antibodies to combat it.
6873,With Delta it reproduces extremely fast so by the time antibodies have been produced it can be too late and symptoms occur.
6874,"Unfortunately some people, for a multitude of reasons - be it age, a compromised immune system, medications, don‚Äôt have a strong T Cell response and the virus reproduces to such an extent the scale tips and the virus takes over."
6875,"Luckily most of the time your body is able to gear up it‚Äôs response rapidly and there‚Äôs only mild symptoms, if any."
6876,"It‚Äôs not a failure of the vaccines, it‚Äôs this variant is robust as hell."

7046,I think the mRNA technology is a pretty amazing scientific advancement.
7047,The effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines is higher than the J&amp;J single dose - I figured if I was going through the stress of having a shot I might as well go all out and get the most effectiveness out of the stress as possible.
7048,Even if it meant twice.

7130,I would say only mandatory vaccination or the kind that France did where all public gatherings require vaccination proof.
7131,But in a country as federalized as US where states have their own say even this may not help as federal government is limited in it‚Äôs ability to drive vaccination efforts.
7132,The other method is financial penalties.

7265,Ok - what you are defining is finding sensationalist articles or opinions you already agree with.
7266,The CDC cites multiple long term studies backing their decision making and I can find hundreds of articles from scientists also backing that.
7267,That is the consensus - not reddit comments and opinion clickbait articles on CNN.
7268,I can also find a scientist or a doctor who have written an article about how good hydroxychloroquine is at treating COVID - that doesn't make it relevant.
7269,"As for breakthrough cases, they are rare and 98% are clinically irrelevant."
7270,Here is a study proving it.

All of the known studies and data shows that vaccines are overwhelmingly effective (also against delta) - so really what you are arguing is the CDC should lie and make people wear masks for no point in order to convince unvaccinated people to wear masks."
7272,I don't know how you don't see that as absurd.
7273,If you take that route you go down a rabbit hole in where you could also argue if the CDC says vaccinated people need to wear masks the public loses trust in the vaccine.
7274,The CDC is implicitly saying that vaccines are not effective - this is 1. untrue 2. a bad idea as it proves many of the fears of unvaccinated people.
7275,The CDC should tell the truth - vaccines are effective and reward people who get them.

7498,And part of the problem is the the immunty is not evenly distributed.
7499,I believe a lot of people are sorting their social circles by vaccination status.
7500,My family are only seeing friends who are vaccinated.
7501,I presume that the friends who are not vaccinated are seeing each other.
7502,"So instead of a single social circle where 60% of the people are vaccinated, we have two social circles, one 100% vaccinated and one almost 0% vaccinated."

7534,How can you calculate efficacy if you don‚Äôt know the number of fully vaccinated people that were exposed to Covid and didn‚Äôt get an infection?
7535,That would be the only way without having a control group of non vaccinated people that went about the same behaviors as the vaccinated group.
7536,"Additionally, we have no idea how many in their unvaccinated population may have antibodies from a previous infection."

7720,I recall debates in this sub a few months back on whether or not a vaccinated person could even get to the point of having enough of a viral load to be contagious.

7794,Maybe the CDC shouldn't have made their dopey statement about not needing masks if you're vaccinated which opened the door to the honor system which meant that everyone stopped wearing masks including the unvaccinated.
7795,And now we're here.

https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-data-insights/covid-19-cases-by-vaccination-status/"
7922,There was an extremely slim chance of catching and spreading the original strain once you were vaccinated.
7923,The Delta variant is more contagious and spreadable by vaccinated people than the original.
7924,There are different rates for different categories of protection.
7925,Delta chance for asymptomatic transfer to a vaccinated person is ~60%.
7926,Symptomatic transmission protection seems to be over 80% and protection from severe illness is still over 90%.
7927,These numbers are still being pinned down but it's a gist.
7928,"When you hear a study or person talking about rate of protection, it's important to distinguish what type of transmission."
7929,Hospitals in Little Rock already warned that elective surgeries are going to have to be postponed or canceled.
7930,This problem is too big and too systemic to shame away.
7931,It‚Äôs not just a few antivaxxers.
7932,A LOT of people don‚Äôt want the vaccine for any number of reasons and I think the current efforts are making people even more resistant to the shot
7933,Is this due to lack of supply of vaccines or uptake?
7934,Or are a lot of people awaiting second dose?

7957,"And likely being made available publicly if someone wants to get it, not behind a paywall or requiring institutional access."
7958,"What it isn‚Äôt useful for is the general mainstream media to report on, when most people will see the headlines, do minimal if any analysis, and freak out thinking the vaccines do not work."
7959,"But it's different when an official ""news network"" reports it."

7964,Hum as a Brazilian I'd say gamma is at least as transmissible as alpha.
7965,Alpha didn't stand a chance against gamma here.
7966,I assume it's to do with the gap between jabs.
7967,UK did 8-12 week gaps between jabs for both Pfizer and AZ.
7968,whilst Israel only did 3-4 weeks.
7969,It could very well be that the British gamble with longer gaps actually paid off in long run due to higher efficiency against new variants.

8049,I don't think Singapore has this idea.
8050,Although I did see a BBC article trying to say they do.
8051,It is determined to get cases down to 0 as it has been made clear to them that this is the only way to create a travel corridor with China and Hong Kong.
8052,Which is majorly needed for their tourism sector and the rest of their economy.
8053,Also Singapore has a lot of money to spare.
8054,The UK is in massive debt and has super high taxes with a poor population compared to Singapore.
8055,They can't really take the hit of funding lockdowns that last months or building new hospitals in just a few weeks.
8056,The UK also fails to enforce masks well.
8057,Whenever I see Boris Johnson in the news he has no mask.
8058,And the footage from the football tournament showed so many people without a mask .
8059,Singapore continues to have masks everywhere.
8060,And large gatherings are still restricted.
8061,Also their track and trace app is very effective and obeying the rule to self isolate is a legal requirement.
8062,The UKs is not.
8063,Finally Singapore isn't letting in tourists or letting its own people travel for leisure.
8064,The UK is not.
8065,I personally think there are parallels to the computing era - when we shrank the pc from a tool of lightbulbs to be desktop sized where people started seeing them on their office desks or at home - was the catalyst for our computer era.
8066,This vaccine process and the changing of demand from being for small quantity experimental drugs (big ole computers taking up a whole room) to now being able to produce billions if not tens of billions of mRNA doses a year (computer in every desk) is going to have a monumental impact in healthcare over the next 20 years.

8090,"Sorry for the ignorant question, from what I've understand the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use some new kind of vaccine technology that makes it easier to create future vaccines faster and safer."
8091,My question is how quickly can scientists create a new vaccine specifically for new variants (like Delta) and how quickly can that vaccine reach the general public?
8092,Does it still have to go through a year of testing and trials?
8093,Do other states have scannable QR codes for vaccination records like California does?

8145,Is there a reason why?
8146,Except lockdowns were extremely short and people could have normal lives outside of them.
8147,I'm former.
8148,It will definitely be mandatory.
8149,There is no doubt in my mind.
8150,The military does not play.
8151,"The only vaccine I received in the military that was ""optional"" was the anthrax vaccine, and it was only optional because:

a) It was an experimental vaccine that had never received a full suite of clinical trials, nor FDA approval, AND

b) There was no specific expectation that we would actually be exposed to anthrax during the war."
8152,Note that BOTH of these reasons were important.
8153,"During a slightly earlier time, when the use of anthrax against U.S. troops was considered a real possibility, the vaccine was mandatory, or practically so."
8154,"(That is what I was told by some who were there at the time, anyway-- that they were not given an option to forego the anthrax vaccine."
8155,"Whereas when I came through, as a U.S. Marine in the mid-2000s, while we were not given a specific, explicit opportunity to opt-out, it was generally known that you could refuse it without consequence, and a couple did."
8156,"On a side note, that particular vaccine caused some nasty acute reactions in some of the Marines who took it."
8157,"I never had any trouble, but one staff sergeant in particular had his injection arm swell up like a balloon for a few days.)"
8158,The lack of social life  would probably be more damaging than Covid for them to be honest.
8159,I feel like I have landed at a new normal.
8160,I go to stores wearing a mask.
8161,I eat outside at restaurants.
8162,I socialize with people outdoors.
8163,"I won‚Äôt do a lot indoors with people outside my bubble (I have had some people I know and trust in the house unmasked though), eat in a restaurant or go on public transit."
8164,I was just on the verge of expanding more and now Delta makes me worry that I‚Äôm doing too much.
8165,I‚Äôm vaccinated but my kids are under 12 and I‚Äôm terrified of spreading anything to them.
8166,I also remain worried about the long Covid risk.
8167,Is anyone else feeling like the Delta variant is slowing down the return to normality?
8168,Right now I‚Äôm terrified of being asked to return to the office because we are not requiring everyone to be vaccinated.
8169,Being locked down is not brilliantly.
8170,Until everyone gets vaccinated it‚Äôs not over.
8171,Locking everyone in for a year and a half and still doing lockdowns is not brilliant.
8172,Translated title: OPINION: Macron is now coercing the French into getting vaccinated ‚Äì and it seems that they like it
8173,"Eventually, if it turns into a new wave, they're going to scream endlessly about how useless Biden is."
8174,"If enough die, it will backfire on them in future elections."
8175,&gt; Choosing to ignore distancing and mask wearing and spreading the infection to non-vaccinated individuals who go on to experience hospitalization is tantamount to manslaughter IMO.

8199,Hopefully this means numbers will start dropping soon

But what goals can there be beyond vaccines?"
8201,"The only thing beyond that is masks and distancing forever, which simply does not work."

8212,We tend to just consider the 90+% efficacy rate and not the small percentage of vaccinated people who fall into the smaller percentage.

8257,"There are however fatalists on both sides of the decision to personally vaccinate who are doing the best to sabotage that plan: those who won't vaccinate but also those who did vaccinate but have given up on the very achievable goal of most of us not getting covid at all, because they'd rather people including their fellow vacinees keep dying, than that they have to personally suffer any further inconvenience."
8258,"Yeah, but anybody who tried to say that was also straight attacked on this sub in particular...."
8259,Blood is already on DeSantis‚Äô hands.
8260,"He obviously has no concern for his so-called followers, because they are the unvaccinated."
8261,"He‚Äôs been on their side all along, too."
8262,They only died because they got infected with the toxic vaccine of someone else.
8263,^^^^^/s
8264,Cops are very conservative and NYPD is one of the worst major police departments in the country.
8265," yes, but much rarer to transmit"
8266,No point to going to a bar in la right now sadly.
8267,What‚Äôs the point of going to a bar and not being able to socialize with anyone outside of your party?
8268,Might as well just have friends over for drinks and save money.

8270,I was directly responding to you claiming much of California imposed a mask mandate.
8271,What counties outside of LA county have implemented a mask mandate?
8272,All I can find is other counties recommending it.
8273,A recommendation is not a mandate.
8274,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kcra.com/amp/article/more-california-counties-recommend-wearing-masksdelta-variant/37052022

You mention Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri for some reason."
8275,As of now none of those states have any sort of universal state mandate regarding masks.
8276,"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/facing-your-face-mask-duties-a-list-of-6779936/

Edit: fixed a spelling error"
8277,Now it seems that Arkansas positivity rate is topping off but it is still at 11%

8279,"In a confined space a cloth mask adds 5 minutes of protection in terms of the time it takes for an unmasked person person to breathe in an infectious dosage of covid aerosols from an unmasked person (15 minutes).An N95, not fit tested, will add over 2400 hours to the time needed to inhale an infectious dosage."
8280,This is from aerosol biology reports issued by the top authorities in the nation in the field about a year or so into COVID-19 having had time to run its course.
8281,Dr Osterholm reported this on his podcast.
8282,No thanks‚Ä¶
8283,[deleted]
8284,"It clearly won‚Äôt catch on in the US, besides some outliers."
8285,People should be charged with aggravated assault for walking around with no mask while unvaccinated.
8286,Why is that ok?
8287,Vaccine passports are the way to go.
8288,Is a photo picture succulent?
8289,The card not being wallet size was a big mistake!
8290,All employers are required to enforce masks.
8291,So where do they go get a new job at within a week?
8292,Pickup and move to Phoenix?
8293,The Vegas market as is pretty specialized too.
8294,A casino dealer can't leave one casino over a mask mandate and go to another.
8295,They all are enforcing it because we don't want our economy to die... again.
8296,It's mostly unspoken lies in their attitude and the way they say what they say.
8297,"For example stuff like ""sure it's fine if you want to mask, by all means do what you feel you need to do to make you feel safe."""
8298,"That's basically saying ""hide under your bed if you need to, you're over reacting, it's not really needed."""
8299,Totally ignoring the real epidemiological functionality of masking etc.
8300,As if it only helps calm scared peoples fears.
8301,Their ignorance is infuriating to say the least.

8304,Australia.
8305,We are 6-12 months behind you guys with vaccinations so I guess we'll be having these same discussions in due course.
8306,"Glad I never stopped wearing mine in public despite being a) house fully vaxed w/ Pfizer, b) age 35 &amp; relative good health, c) work from home, &amp; d) living in a city without a major outbreak &amp; has decent (but could be better) vaccine uptake."
8307,"There are now times I go into stores and I am the only person with a max on, including staff."
8308,I think wearing a mask when going out has just become a habit of mine like putting on headphones before every time I go out alone.
8309,Breaking the habit will feel weird whenever I do get around to it.
8310,I don't want to get sick?
8311,"If there's a highly contagious bug around Im wearing a mask because I don't want to get sick, doesn't matter about hospitalization."
8312,Lockdowns would make little difference at this point because the unvaccinated people who are spreading COVID like wildfire amongst themselves wouldn't follow restrictions anyway.
8313,A mask mandate however is very visible and easy to enforce in businesses.
8314,Easier than say keeping people from congregating privately which is not possible.
8315,I suppose not.
8316,There are worse things to happen than having to wear a face mask when I'm around strangers.
8317,How exactly is this his fault?
8318,Looks like your messages are getting deleted.
8319,I get that but I'm saying that undergirding all of this is what I consider to be a broken value system.
8320,"The reason the lockdowns work in Australia is that culturally we are, in general, happy to take a hit for the greater good even though we will grumble about it."
8321,"Our government is also somewhat more socialistic, with healthcare and welfare being important and well regarded institutions (relative to the US)."
8322,"More government spending would ameliorate many of the things you mentioned - economy (through stimulus), mental health (lessen fear of poverty without work), education, supporting people and businesses."
8323,etc.
8324,"The money is there, the US is the richest country in the world."
8325,Just tax the biggest corps and redistribute.
8326,But the politics of it are impossible because of the culture.
8327,Culturally yes it's an uphill battle.
8328,"Political tribalism, anti-intellectualism, obsession with 'freedom', romanticised narratives of violent uprising, distrust of government institutions, rampant inequality, etc."
8329,"You're right, even with better public health policy you wouldn't be able to fight that."
8330,"To your final question, yes it is smart to make policy based on the hope that people have unlimited patience, if you can assume that a large majority of people would a) be ok with being patient if it means other people won't die, and b) be willing to accept evidence-based public health policy."
8331,Neither of which are values that most Americans hold.
8332,[removed]
8333,So basically there is no end game for you?
8334,[removed]
8335,"Im curious about this, when has the CDC said we can start treating covid like a flu/common cold?"
8336,"I don't see them saying it anywhere yet the anti-maskers here who spout they ""follow the science""  treat it like that"
8337,I am in Texas.
8338,"I forget the exact date the mask mandate was lifted, but there were plenty of people in stores well before this ignoring mask mandates."
8339,I remember going into my local stores and noticing people(like probably 20 or more) just walking around with no masks and none of the workers said anything.
8340,"I don't blame them, I wouldn't either."
8341,Big sign on the door saying masks required but it wasn't enforced at all.
8342,"But covid has been over here for a while, it's going to get real here when school starts back up."
8343,"Seems like delta is much better at reproducing, which means you need a mightier immune response that some people (vaccinated or not) simply can't execute and it also means viral loads being shed are higher."
8344,"So you need a more agile army to fight it, and delta sends armies (viral loads) that are bigger than the armies against which the vaccines' efficacy rates were tested against and measured."
8345,The CDC absolutely dropped the ball here by jumping the gun on mask mandates.
8346,It was boneheaded messaging completely out of touch with the way the ignorant masses would receive and act on it.

8355,So the Israeli study likely overestimated protection?
8356,"I had to do this several times as a frontline worker after possible exposures, before my family got vaccinated."
8357,"Our protocol was for me to stay in a different level of the house, with windows open for air circulation."
8358,I wore a mask and kept 10 ft away whenever I needed to be in the common areas.
8359,"I either ate my own food, or washed my hands and waited for them to leave the house before using the kitchen."
8360,I also used a different bathroom from everyone else.
8361,I‚Äôm not saying this is the most appropriate course of action for your situation - that‚Äôll depend on your family‚Äôs risk tolerance and resources - but that‚Äôs how we made it work.
8362,&gt; It'll spread out of control and over run hospitals.
8363,Leading to more lock downs.
8364,Lockdowns are not at all likely.
8365,Almost 70% of those 18+ are vaccinated.
8366,Almost 80% of those 55+ are vaccinated.
8367,These are the groups that traditionally have ended up hospitalized.
8368,"There are still a lot of people who can get sick, who will stretch our hospitals to the limit, and who will die."
8369,It's not at all good.
8370,But we aren't going to lock down again.
8371,"""The Q-Virus"""
8372,And this sub needs to stop with this asinine comment every time a new article is posted.
8373,Do you honestly believe that fully vaccinated people are driving this current wave?
8374,All evidence points to it being an unvaccinated problem.
8375,"Even before this wave started, there was constant articles pointing out there would be an upcoming wave amongst the unvaccinated."
8376,"Mask mandates don‚Äôt fix that, vaccines do."
8377,"Did everyone suddenly forget that we‚Äôve spent the past year bitching about people not abiding by mask mandates, those same people now don‚Äôt want to be vaccinated."
8378,"Again, a mask mandate doesn‚Äôt fix that problem."
8379,The unvaccinated were never wearing the damn mask to begin with.
8380,Absolutely.
8381,There needs to be a more in you face campaign to get people to realize the horrors of reality instead of some conspiracy about the vaccines.
8382,"eh, the vaccinated constitute 0.5% of deaths."
8383,That sounds like a fairly good indicator of immunity.
8384,They're not just exposing themselves.
8385,They're exposing others for which vaccination is not a choice.
8386,Not to mention the vaccine isn't 100% effective either.
8387,Not getting vaccinated if you are able to is a supremely selfish decision.
8388,There is a way through the Apple Health app.
8389,"I have my vaccine provider's mobile app (MyChart) installed, and the MyChart app links data into Apple Health."
8390,"Some time after my shots, I noticed that the provider's data was in Apple Health in the following location: go to Browse &gt; scroll down to Health Records section &gt; then Immunization section &gt; and found the Pfizer vaccine record including all other vaccines I've received like the influenza."
8391,"&gt;Vaccines were always billed as the way out, let‚Äôs not move the goalposts."
8392,The virus is a moving target whether we like it or not and Delta has changed the rules of the game significantly.
8393,"It's very disappointing, back in early May it was actually looking promising that Israel and the UK were on track to soon reach numbers that would have been contact traceable to zero before Delta cases took off."
8394,"Countries have different risk tolerances and I'm not advocating for any particular restrictions anywhere, however it's crazy to expect that goal posts will never be moved given how unpredictable the virus is; the possibility of vaccine-resistant variants emerging is going to be an ongoing concern."

8434,"I think it‚Äôs a combination of Delta, fears about a twindemic as we inch closer to the Fall, fears that another mask mandate or lockdown could be coming soon, Republicans finally beginning to change their tune, and people wanting to see relatives on holidays safely."
8435,Are you reading the data correctly?
8436,"Were there 4122 breakthrough infections *between* July 7 and July 13, or were there 4122 *cumulative* breakthrough cases *as of* July 13?"
8437,I thought it was the latter.
8438,Oh we're getting there.
8439,Some people have just chosen the harder way to get their antibodies.
8440,So is this vaccine more about not feeling sick?
8441,I still can catch and pass along the virus but I just won‚Äôt feel it?

8461,I can only guess it's related to this which basically says what we've known for a while.
8462,Antibodies from vaccines are less effective against delta variant than they were against the original strains.
8463,A five to six fold decrease sounds scary but it doesn't necessarily correlate to the same drop in real life protection.

8469,Should we be concerned (USA) for another possible quarantine or even a lockdown?
8470,"Or maybe not that, but schools resorting back to online or social distancing as well as stores?"
8471,"This Delta variant seems dangerous spreading like wild fire and literally getting the vaccinated sick, makes no sense."

8475,You've got an extremely low chance of catching it at all once vaccinated.
8476,"You are very unlikely to get it, but the point is that even STILL, if you DO get it, even then, you are even LESS likely to have any kind of serious illness."
8477,"Being vaccinated against COVID, you shouldn't be scared any more."
8478,"But if you want to prevent yourself even more from potentially getting a mild illness (incidentally, more so than just COVID) then wearing a mask as well will certainly reduce your chances even more."
8479,"Fauci should trust the science

-anti maskers spamming this sub the last month"
8480,It's one of the very important parts.
8481,"However, it's also very important to know how effective vaccines are at preventing a vaccinated person from spreading Delta covid-19 to other people, even if their case is mild."
8482,I don't think we know enough about that yet.

8500,"No, the point is we need to get everyone vaccinated to avoid selective shutdowns of particularly riskier activities and mask requirements."
8501,Much of California is forced to reimposing them now because vaccination rates are not sufficient to stop the renewed onslaught.

8503,"So long it becomes a ""consideration or recommendation"", I'm fine."
8504,"If it becomes the mandate again, we'll have problems."
8505,Well if you get tested weekly you also have a risk of spreading covid.
8506,What they are balancing is the risk of being infected while vaccinated is similar to the risk of being positive while unvaccinated but tested.
8507,"Either way, they're telling the workers you can either go in for weekly testing (which is inconvenient) or you can go for a vaccine and save that effort."

8531,"Being individually vaccinated in an unvaxinated population is 5-10x better than not being, but the real protection we can rely on comes from getting there together as an entire population."

I got covid and was sick for a week."
8636,This delta variant stuff kinda concerning and im considering getting vaxx again with pfizer.
8637,Is that ok?
8638,Or is J&amp;J and the antibodies from getting covid is enough?
8639,Not trying to get covid again.
8640,That one week i was sick was hell
8641,"To quote Groundhog Day, ""sometimes people just die."""

8659,Most colleges are requiring vaccinations.
8660,Which is why it would be asinine and frankly unfair of them to also require masks.

8669,why are *those* people not vaccinated?

But the answer to your question is actually twofold."
8775,"First, I should tell you that someone let me know that there is actually a certain margin of error in which mutations could supposedly change the makeup of the spike protein without actually losing its effectiveness as a skeleton key."
8776,"However, I'm not aware if either Delta or Gamma actually have that particular kind of mutation."
8777,"And like I was saying, there's still only so far that the virus could take that mutation before it completely loses the usefulness of the spike."
8778,"Second, you have to remember that normal vaccines don't have the same advantage as the mRNA, because they usually only take dead virus cells, inject them into our body, and try to get the white blood cells to recognize them as an intruder."
8779,Whereas mRNA can be a bit more targeted.

8886,I contend that not only is it right to call them out but that it‚Äôs the unfortunate next step we all need to take to pressure people to get vaccinated.
8887,We aren‚Äôt afforded the luxury of letting them remain ignorant and unvaccinated.
8888,"Too many people are dying and as hard as it is for me to say, the next wave is going to be the young‚Ä¶ and all because someone wouldn‚Äôt get a vaccine?"
8889,Be careful not to poke the pooh

8892,But I hope people understand that every breakthrough case is a opportunity for COVID to learn how to mutate around the vaccine.
8893,Darn the anti-vax but unfortunately their problem is also ours.
8894,"(So double darn them tbh)

Note: anti-vax, not unvaxable
Edit: used more civil language thank you auto mod"

8904,There's always that 5% chance of an accident.
8905,I have vulnerable people around me also and wondering if 95% safe is a reasonably risk like driving daily?

8928,Not as big as actually catching the virus and missing the competition entirely
8929,That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying.
8930,At all
8931,I've kept wearing mine as well.
8932,I'm usually the only person in a mask everywhere I go but my state is leading the country (again) in new cases and the Delta variant is more easily transmissible so I'm keeping it on.
8933,The government was just wiping it's hands and passing on the responsibility to smaller governments.
8934,I keep saying this.
8935,"Vaccinated people can still catch, carry, and transmit the virus to others."
8936,That‚Äôs why I still wear my mask everywhere.
8937,I have a 6 year old daughter who can‚Äôt be vaccinated.
8938,She wears a mask everywhere too.
8939,Israel has a strong vaccination rate for adults and they still have the virus spreading there.
8940,UK too.
8941,The vaccine isn't enough to stop delta completely.
8942,Wearing a mask and going back into the world are not mutually exclusive.
8943,I think vaccinated people staying in as hermits is going way overboard.
8944,But nothing wrong with wearing masks with how things are going right now.

8964,"I understand that and don't knock you for that, but there's a good chunk of people here and on other websites that are acting all holier than thou on people who are vaccinated and resumed their lives."
8965,"This type of stigma can really suck especially when some of us did everything we needed to do for a year and got vaccinated and are just now feeling safe enough to go back into the world, my mental health needs it."
8966,"Yes, but it‚Äôs *extremely* unlikely unless you are in the highest risk groups (very elderly or immune compromised) and didn‚Äôt build up a proper immune reaction to the vaccine."
8967,"Most breakthrough infections are asymptomatic, most of the rest are mild to moderate."
8968,"Very few end up hospitalized and again, those are typically people with multiple underlying health issues."
8969,The endpoint (beginning point actually) they use here is really problematic and makes it impossible to actually interpret what this means.
8970,"People who were reported to have died in February would have been infected in January, when virtually no one had access to the vaccine."
8971,"Also because of the lag in reporting, most people reported to have died in March would have really died in February and have been infected in January."
8972,"We can probably go even further out - it takes 5-6 weeks from first shot to be ‚Äúfully‚Äù vaccinated (wait for the second shot, then two more weeks)."
8973,There‚Äôs no doubt that the vaccine reduces deaths from infections - quick look at UK‚Äôs cases to deaths ratio shows that as clear as day.
8974,"But it makes no sense to include February/March deaths in the calculation, because very few people were vaccinated then."
8975,"Since early June, when most people would have had access to the shots and the reporting lag is accounted for, there have been ~2,000 total reported  deaths."
8976,That‚Äôs the better reference period.
8977,"That still shows very effective efficacy, so stretching the truth by including the inapplicable winter numbers is just unnecessary."
8978,I‚Äôm so sorry
8979,Who were fully vaccinated with an MRNA vaccine prior to infection?

9013,31% in my county.
9014,"I counted 5 people wearing a mask including myself, at the grocery store this week and my coworkers are already mocking people that wear masks in buildings."
9015,Masking up is the new religion here.
9016,Tldr; old people should definitely wear masks in public.
9017,"I think the vaccine‚Äôs powers have been a bit overstated, in the eagerness to sell then the public."
9018,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they are absolutely fucking miracles of modern medicine."
9019,"But they aren‚Äôt literal magic, they have limitations."

9024,"If an older person isn‚Äôt digging into the literature and just following the news, then they could easily think they are totally safe."
9025,I feel like they been misled‚Ä¶ but on the other hand so many people who dismissed their risk factors through the entire pandemic.
9026,"Friends tell me, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm young and healthy‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyou have elevated blood pressure, you‚Äôre obese, and you have allergies."
9027,Plenty of stuff for Covid to exploit.‚Äù
9028,"It's also not much of an ""extra mile"" if, like me, you don't really mind masking up that much, and forget about it most of the time."
9029,"I'm overjoyed to be vaccinated (I had a big ol' grin when I got my second shot), and I feel very well protected by the vaccine."
9030,"But the mask may increase that protection by a bit, and it would also help protect others from me in case I unknowingly get a breakthrough infection."
9031,"And since it doesn't take that much effort on my part, I'm happy to keep doing it."
9032,My mother went into the ER with stroke symptoms and was immediately seen before everyone else.

9038,"Workplace spread might improve with masks, but nothing else imo"
9039,&gt;We‚Äôve done our part and we‚Äôve done our risk assessments.
9040,Say you're assuredly super scientific risk assessment is wrong.
9041,What would it take for you to put your big boy pants on and mask up and follow restrictions?
9042,The only one's who sound scared here are people like you.
9043,We all want it to end.
9044,"You all love to pull out the ""iF yOu'Re ScArEd, StAy InSiDe"" as if we actually want this shit to continue."
9045,I've been stuck at home for nearly a year and a half with a high risk 4 yo.
9046,"Trust me, I want out."
9047,"However, viruses aren't going to stop doing virus shit just because I'm about to have a breakdown."
9048,I'm not going to ignore basic facts about viruses just to justify continuing on like normal.
9049,I've only ever seen people on this sub advocating for mask mandates to continue until kids can be vaccinated.
9050,"Which, even if you don't agree, is still a reasonable position for someone to take."
9051,"Yet every single damn time all you people ever hear is ""IWANNASTAYINSIDEFOREVERHOLYSHITI'MTERRIFIED"" and say we're scared."

9063,Yep.
9064,Like .0005% if my memory serves me correct.
9065,It was just on Reddit the other day with actual sources for the statistics.
9066,What's the point of emphasizing it though?
9067,"Like, ""Hey, here's a fact that would never make your day!"""
9068,Are you worried that people are in denial about covid?
9069,Does this justify not taking anymore precautions?
9070,We learn to live with the flu by vaccinating people to get some herd immunity on top of previous antibodies from other flus.

9088,"I have had both my shots of Pfizer, living with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and weighed up the risks over getting covid."
9089,I didn‚Äôt want to get any sicker from covid and consider the risk of contracting further illness even long covid was greater than getting the vaccine.

India just reported almost 4,000 deaths in a single day."
9117,Estimates go as high as 15x on reported vs actual deaths.
9118,To say that Delta has come and gone in India is simply factually false.
9119,Because it's almost as if social distancing and masks work?
9120,"Don't think of it like a whatever, think of it like this is proof that doing these things will stop the spread of covid, a much much worse virus.."
9121,"The flu went away with all the lockdowns, masks, social distancing, covid did not, covid went haywire and spread dramatically compared to the flu, killing millions while the flu killed nearly no one in comparison, imagine if we did non of these precautions, covid would have wreaked 100 times more death."
9122,"Thus comparison should absolutely shoe you how covid is not ""just the flu"" and why we should be taking it more seriously than we are at the moment."

9133,"Not sure why you're catching flak, it isn't an unfair question."
9134,Our understanding up until this point was that being fully vaccinated meant you were highly unlikely to catch it and almost no chance of dying from it...
9135,That sounds exhausting.
9136,It will never be over
9137,That's not really accurate though.
9138,That's like a general sense on average but you can get covid in a few seconds in the right situation.
9139,"And there is a wide range in masks, even commercial cloth ones."
9140,Covid doesn't care if you're ready to move on.
9141,"Just because you're fully vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch covid and pass it on to others, and not just those who refuse to get vaccinated."
9142,"We all want it to be over, but it's not and won't be for awhile."
9143,Let me tell about the little shithole where I live.
9144,There's a small city around here with about 36% uptake.
9145,"The rural municipality (roughly equivalent to a county, I think) that surrounds it has an uptake of 20%."
9146,"Probably everyone here knows someone who's been badly affected by COVID, which somehow crystallizes their ignorance."
9147,"People in this area have been quoted saying, ""suffering is an accepted part of life,"" without a hint of empathy for their fellow human beings."
9148,"Patients here have denied that COVID even exists, on their death beds, with their literal dying breaths."
9149,"To incentivize uptake, the provincial government has tied a number of reopens to proof of vaccination."
9150,How did people in this area respond?
9151,A hundred or so packed up and moved to Mexico and Central/South America.
9152,"More are expected to follow, because apparently whatever tinpot dictatorships they'll be under is somehow better than... just getting a vaccine."
9153,"Rumors of magnets, microchips, and biological time bombs (everyone vaccinated will die in a few years) are rampant."
9154,A number of people in the area originally immigrated from these areas to where they're returning and they don't have as much as a high school diploma.
9155,The scientific illiteracy is shocking and there's basically nothing anyone seems to be able to do to dig them out of the hole before the fourth wave hits in a couple of months.

9164,Mina argues that the real ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù should be the sick not the infected.
9165,There needs to be a mask mandate in schools.

9169,I have only been out to eat a few times and rarely go anywhere else indoors besides work a couple times a month.
9170,Case in point - they're still spreading it :)

9182,&gt; Lockdowns would make little difference at this point because the unvaccinated people who are spreading COVID like wildfire amongst themselves wouldn't follow restrictions anyway.
9183,"Yeah, for that to work the US would first need to introduce some sort of organization that would enforce laws and regulations in their area of jurisdiction."
9184,"Until then, though, the problem would remain."
9185,This is why those scare tactic headlines are so effective.
9186,They can make a front page story out of a pretty mundane quote.
9187,"I feel you, it's a bummer."

9203,"I trust the science, which is why when I read that 3 White House staffers, members of Congress or their aides, and cases beyond that have contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated, I wear a mask to protect my unvaccinated child, in case of a breakthrough infection that gets to me, even if I only get what amounts to a cold."
9204,I don't want my toddler to get sick.
9205,Again.
9206,It's not about me.
9207,It's about others.
9208,Nobody said masks stop pandemics.
9209,"They do, however, lower the risk that you catch it, lower the amount of virus you breathe in, and reduce symptoms if you catch it."
9210,"Edit: most importantly, it does this for the other people around you if YOU have it and are wearing a mask."
9211,"It‚Äôs primarily to help other people, which makes sense why so many people refuse to wear them in my country of selfish people."
9212,"In other news, wearing a seat belt won‚Äôt stop you from having a car accident, or even from dying in one."
9213,So I suppose you don‚Äôt wear those either.
9214,"Great, give me the numbers on the ""very low risk"" and whether that's for Delta and this would be settled."
9215,"The thing is most of those people are fully vaccinated, yet are spreading the anti-vax misinformation."
9216,You want to get your first dose or two now so that you can get a second dose of the next gen vaccine and have a great immune response to it.
9217,You really can‚Äôt judge immune response to the vaccines by what side effects are triggered.
9218,This is one of those things that should be brought up with her medical team rather than a subreddit.
9219,Her doctors may be able to order an antibody test (you need a certain type to help determine post-vaccine immunity.)
9220,Looks like we gots ourselves a reader!
9221,"&gt;There's good advice out there, and they rejected all of it."
9222,"The few sources they follow religiously spew dangerous, unending lies, and have shown little inclination for changing their plans."
9223,Therein lies the problem.
9224,They're brainwashed.
9225,"They've been indoctrinated and they believe fully and confidently that the ""liberal media"" is lying about it."
9226,"They are not bad people, they have been misled."
9227,"The only federal mask mandates are/were in what they control - transit via DOT and interstate commerce clause, and (when/where in effect) federal buildings/property."
9228,The rest was and is guidance for the states to do something.
9229,"Or often as not, to whimp out of doing anything in time."
9230,But they're reporting severely low transmission rates with the vaccination.
9231,As low as as contracting rates.
9232,It's also effective against the delta variant.
9233,So we trust the science.
9234,Weve been feeling anti maskers that from the beginning why would we go against the science now?
9235,I think they thought by dropping the mask mandates it would incentivize the holdouts.
9236,Silly CDC for thinking stubborn people would change their minds.
9237,The term is disinformation.
9238,The media needs to start using it.
9239,Thanks for sharing that source.
9240,I've been looking for a health dept that was tracking breakthroughs.
9241,"It's very interesting that based on raw numbers for breakthroughs found at your link under ""Post-vaccination Infections Overall"" it looks like there are a little over 4,000 breakthroughs for the 7 days ending July 13th."
9242,Didn't see a good dashboard so I had to download the [raw data](http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/) and aggregate the communities for LA county for each date.
9243,"(if you wanna check my math use the Data tab in Excel, then pick the subtotal function using change in ep\_date and sum for ""cases7day"")... Glad I did...

For the same 7 day rolling average ending 7/13 it looks like there were 15,000 cases."
9244,A little quick math 4k/15k = 26% of the 7 day rolling average positive cases were breakthroughs...
9245,"Which is down a few points from July 6th -  2822/9693 at 29.1%

There's a ton of folks in LA that are rocking a mask now too from what I understand."
9246,That seems like a really high breakthrough rate.
9247,I agree with your sentiment.
9248,But we're all in the same boat.
9249,I agree you can stop rowing the boat.
9250,You've done your civil duty.

9255,The risk of death for children is small.
9256,Risk of death.
9257,Keep that in mind.
9258,"They have been pretending there‚Äôs only two outcomes to this disease - death and you‚Äôre 100% totally fine, right?"
9259,Right?
9260,I doubt you‚Äôll believe me so I‚Äôll be brief - covid is a pulmonary disease that thickens your blood and causes damage in nearly every organ of the body - especially the brain which is nothing but tiny blood vessels - and it causes brain damage.
9261,Even in kids.
9262,"They won‚Äôt tell you until next year, and they will pretend they didn‚Äôt know."
9263,"It‚Äôs not, like, a secret - you can find stories of kids with long covid all over the internet - but white people are all pretending it‚Äôs not real, so here we are."
9264,"If you deliberately give your kid covid and they have lifelong health problems, they‚Äôll probably blame you for it and leave you to rot in an awful nursing home."
9265,Just sayin.
9266,"Perhaps, but it's good to put it out there for those who may not fully understand how the vaccines work."
9267,There's a lot of people who think it's 100% protection.
9268,Majority of the deaths occured before April 15.
9269,Only 3500/9000 deaths occured after mid April.
9270,And it's not like you die instantly after catching covid.
9271,April deaths probably caught it the virus in March.
9272,"So unless you got your first vaccine late Feb, the outcome wouldn't change much."
9273,Yeah but probably 15% due to masks and 85% due to gathering restrictions.
9274,Masks undoubtedly help but they pale in comparison to distancing and basically limiting interaction with others.
9275,That percentage is how much of its own stash of vaccines the NYOD has administered.
9276,Some cops may have gotten the shot elsewhere

9281,"If you're fully vaccinated there's a very low chance of you getting hospitalized or dying from it as opposed to someone who is unvaccinated who has a high chance of one or both, esp with the Delta variant."
9282,"If you got one of the mRNA vaccines the efficacy rate is anywhere between 80% upwards to 95-99%, depending on the variant, your age, health, etc."
9283,If you got the J&amp;J one it's somewhere around 70% and both prevent you from getting hospitalized or dying.
9284,"In other words if you're vaccinated you have very little to worry about, but it would behoove you to keep your ear to the ground as to what variants are being discovered."
9285,I also mask up indoors mainly for others who can't get vaccinated.

9314,This is new territory.

9348,"The only other thing I do indoors is office work, and I stopped wearing a mask in June, but it's a small office, I open windows, and everyone is vaccinated and it's northeast US with high vaccination rates."
9349,"It's easy to wear a mask though, and I have unvaccinated children."
9350,"""Long covid"" sounds terrible, so I treat the current situation as if it's peak flu season where I shouldn't be inside around sneezing people anyway."
9351,I hate masking also.
9352,Hate all the measures.
9353,But they need to realize we are *ALL* in this together.
9354,We are all joined at the hip.
9355,Sure I agree the vaxxed are not obligated to mask now technically.
9356,"But if they can see the bigger picture and do a little more rowing, we can get to the other side with minimal complications and get back to normal somewhat sooner."
9357,That's how I look at it.
9358,I'll help row the boat some more.
9359,I'll mask even though vaxxed.
9360,"I‚Äôm sure it varies by location, but I got my first dose as soon as I possibly could and that wasn‚Äôt until almost the end of April."
9361,"The only people here (mid-sized town in east Texas) I knew who got it sooner were either immunocompromised, elderly, caretakers of at-risk individuals, healthcare workers, or those who lied about about being one of those."
9362,Well that‚Äôs the thing about being a scientist is that you change your views when the evidence supports it.
9363,"Well, to be fair people were perfectly fine with mass death prior to covid."
9364,US has been at war for over 20 years and it doesn't seem to bother anyone.
9365,I honestly thought we'd be in a better place by now too.
9366,It's so maddening that we are still having these conversations.
9367,Which puts the lie to someone not being vaccinated being a choice.
9368,"Also Sept is not remotely a guarantee, that would be great but it's more optimistic than the other guesses I'm seeing."
9369,You sound EXACTLY like the people who refused to ever mask up because in February 2020 the cdc recommended against mask due to a shortage in ppe for hospitals.
9370,Things change.
9371,Science changes.
9372,Covid is getting worse again.
9373,Stop being a whiny baby.
9374,If you don‚Äôt wanna wear one you don‚Äôt have to but stop stomping your feet and saying ‚Äúbut whyyyyy‚Äù as governments start considering mandating them again.
9375,Things change.
9376,Of the 9000 deaths only 3.5k occured after April 15 which is approximately when first dose was widely available.
9377,And it's not like you catch covid and die instantly.
9378,So they probably caught it before late March.
9379,Not to mention you need at least 2 weeks after the first dose before you see the benefits.
9380,So yes you should feel somewhat sorry for these guys.

9390,A combination of Japan's byzantine beauracracy and their strange internetphobia.
9391,These is no shared one database of vaccination sites.
9392,You have to call each individual pharmacy to see if they have the vaccine and when you can get it.

9423,"I still wear my mask, too."
9424,Vaccinated but immunocompromised
9425,Just don't cover Covid treatments if somebody is anti-vax.
9426,Let insurance companies send their goons to dig through social media and other evidence.
9427,Use one evil to fight another.
9428,Bonus: maybe that will give conservatives a reason to support a better healthcare system.
9429,I like wearing a mask on public transportation.
9430,All kinds of people ride the buses and rail so it's smart to mask up.
9431,Plus where I'm at the rail line goes to the airport so a lot of out town travelers use it and who knows what they may be carrying.
9432,"Yes, many vaccinated people have caught the Delta version."
9433,The is an old age home near me where 13 vaccinated people have caught it but no serious symptoms so far.
9434,So that's good.

9442,"Not anti-vax, just don't care"
9443,Can someone explain the numbers to me?
9444,"(in the study results someone linked below)
...for the 2 dose pfizer, you had nearly 16,000 people and only 122 developed delta cases."
9445,Wouldn't that mean there was 99% protection against delta... yet the paper concludes only 88% protection.
9446,What am I missing?
9447,"So what's the current Chinese covid-19 situation ie: cases and whatnot, best we can tell?"
9448,Anyone know?
9449,Nice!
9450,In 7-10 days you'll likely be slightly better off than had you gotten it 3 or 4 weeks after your first.
9451,Everyone needs to get on board at this point.

9453,Why the sad face?
9454,Are you worried about waiting 6 weeks?
9455,Also &lt;12 year olds and immunocompromised people.
9456,And anyone who can't get into the ER for other reasons because it's full of unvaccinated COVID patients
9457,The initial story was misleading.
9458,The 43% is from the departments own vaccination program.
9459,"If the cops got the shot at any of the NYC mega sites, which many did, or if they got the shot with their families upstate in the suburbs where they live that doesn‚Äôt count in the numbers."
9460,This was just stat manipulation to drive clicks.
9461,"I don't feel bad for them, but I do feel bad for everyone who has to deal with the side effects of their idiocy."
9462,Such as the people suffering from full hospitals
9463,That‚Äôs because Arkansas is full of idiots and now there are no hospital beds left‚Ä¶
9464,Imagine being such a hypochondriac that you're trying to take an extra vaccine which has no scientific evidence for benefiting you at all when there are countries in the world desperately waiting for their shipments from Moderna to arrive.
9465,"No don't get it, this shouldn't need to be said."
9466,Honestly wish he wasn‚Äôt so vague and i worry that it‚Äôll be too late for a mask mandate if shit goes down like last year.
9467,"I spent a year + isolated with my immunocompromised partner, barely getting by, and I was kinda forced to work for an office job again so we could pay bills and I didn‚Äôt hear of the delta variant two months ago when I applied."
9468,"So now my whole office has been open to the public and some masks, but my office mates aren‚Äôt wearing them."
9469,And my manger and regional manager took theirs off when I had my interview because we were all vaccinated and I had the option to keep mine on.
9470,"But now I‚Äôm in the office, one co worker isn‚Äôt vaccinated and no mask."
9471,"We‚Äôre not healthcare, but we deal with people every day and lots of old people too."
9472,My manager said my co worker can remain maskless if they sign a consent form and have their temp taken every day.
9473,Which I feel like isn‚Äôt going to happen and it doesn‚Äôt protect me or the other people coming into our office.
9474,"I felt good about going back to work being vaccinated, but the delta variant is making me nervous with an immunocompromised vaccinated partner at home."
9475,I don‚Äôt know how to start wearing a mask at work and we have maybe a staff of six in an office and we see about 15-20 people a day.
9476,"I have social anxiety so this whole situation is killing me, but covid could actually kill my partner."
9477,"If Inslee would instill a mask mandate, then I don‚Äôt have to be the ‚Äúparanoid one‚Äù at the office."
9478,I don‚Äôt know.
9479,"I‚Äôm going to look for n95s on amazon, but I do have the surgical ones at home in which I use it for everything excluding work."
9480,"For you to test positive for COVID, the virus has to be present in sufficient concentrations; people don't test positive right after they've been exposed, but after the virus has started to use their cells to reproduce."
9481,"For a lot of breakthrough cases, what's really happening is more that people who don't have good immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine."
9482,"To one extreme, imagine someone with basically no immune response; since the vaccine just prepares your own immune system to fight it off, if there's nothing to prepare, it won't do anything."
9483,So a lot of the breakthrough cases have happened with the elderly and the immunocompromised.
9484,"People who didn't get as much benefit from the vaccine, even though they got it."
9485,"(and so they're depending on everyone else to be vaccinated so that they're much less likely to be exposed to the virus since they may not be able to get the benefit from taking the vaccine personally)

9486,Why would u take more shots than you need to
9487,Are you in the United States?
9488,"If so, I wouldn't worry about school going virtual"
9489,"What I don‚Äôt get is how people who are not vaccinated make up majority of the people to contract COVID-19, but if they don‚Äôt care about it why are they getting tested for it in the first place."
9490,I can‚Äôt see how some redneck in Arkansas is going to the clinic to get tested in the first place if they don‚Äôt believe the virus is real
9491,That's great!
9492,"I believe the positive cases would be higher because some vaccinated people will get sick and it'll be barely a cold, like an allergy and they won't get tested at all."
9493,Efficacy is a fancy word they use in trials where they get to pick and choose whose in the study and what the denominator is.
9494,Effectiveness in the real world is what matters and unfortunately effectiveness is not as promising as what efficacy is.
9495,"For anyone not from Australia, Victoria went into hard lockdown 1 week after people from Sydney seeded the outbreak, and about 2 days after we found out it had started to spread."
9496,"NSW on the other hand has taken much lighter measures, which has resulted in the virus spreading to 4 other states."
9497,Even Adelaide is now in lockdown because of someone catching it in Sydney.
9498,I'll consider it as much as the unvaccinated consider getting the vaccine tomorrow.
9499,The CDC guidance was a blunder because it disregarded living with others who can't get the vaccine or immunocompromised.
9500,Is that even the case statistically though?
9501,I don't have time to research and run the numbers so I defer to the CDC.
9502,I've gotten sick twice this year and lost a couple of weeks of time but neither were COVID (I got tested both times).
9503,I'm fully vaccinated and I stopped wearing a mask.
9504,"I don't want to be sick either, the last time really set me back, but I'm also not going to wear one forever to avoid any and all illnesses."
9505,If you're not making that decision from the science and the CDC guidelines what is it based on?
9506,They clearly got shots elsewhere.
9507,The Javits center was letting cops get shot without an appointment from almost day one.
9508,They just administered the no show shots to any cops that wanted one.
9509,The original story is highly misleading.
9510,you ever learn to sneeze into your sleeve when you were a kid?
9511,"Not that we should either panic or get our science sources from news articles, but no useful pandemic research will ever be peer reviewed."
9512,"That process takes many months, by which time the research will be outdated."
9513,"And peer review itself can fail, of course."
9514,"It's not some sort of ""gold standard""."
9515,The vaccines function by priming your immune system to recognize the spike protein (the one mutating) and mount a rapid innate immune response to the virus because it has been exposed to a harmless or decoy version of it before.
9516,All the published studies stated 95% efficacy against becoming infected at all.
9517,This was pre- delta variant.
9518,So still 5% chance of getting infected.
9519,"Due to the aforementioned priming of the immune system, your body is drastically more capable of eliminating the virus with no or mild symptoms."
9520,That isn't to say while infected you can't spread it.
9521,"Especially to those who are unvaccinated such as children or older and immunocompromised individuals who a ""mild"" case might be life threatening."
9522,"So while you yourself are probably safe, those people who get infected and have very symptomatic cases cause they are unvaccinated (fuck these ppl) are the biggest threat to this virus springing a mutation that bypasses our current vaccines and fucks us all back to square one."
9523,I am in America FYI.
9524,I will never consider that
9525,Thanks for your permission.
9526,It was clear we were in this shit for the long haul the minute people started bitching about masks.
9527,I saw this bullshit on the NBC nightly news tonight and wanted to throw my dinner at the TV.
9528,All this is doing is increasing vaccine hesitancy.
9529,It's not.
9530,"They go whichever way the wind is blowing, philosophically."
9531,"They'll try to mitigate ridiculous statements by saying ""well I HEARD The shot doesn't prevent you from getting sick"" and then say It's defensible because they just heard someone else say it."
9532,Now there's more objective evidence in local commmunities  that severe covid disease is occurring in the unvaccinated.
9533,"So now they are saying ""well, I never said vaccines were bad, it's just a matter of personal choice but it's a good idea"""
9534,Agree and the poor medical staff who are already burnt out.
9535,Damn prayer for me y‚Äôall üôèüèª I be drinking lake erie water so maybe I‚Äôm okay lol
9536,It's getting really hard not to feel this way..
9537,"I know this would never fly with medical ethics, but I find myself asking... at what point do we just tell unvaccinated people, *You had your chance, you didn't listen, go home and die."
9538,We have responsible patients to treat.

9575,"Ughhhh im probably gonna catch it üòû feel so powerless üòû   

Guess double masking is all I can do."
9576,You getting the vaccine helped both you and others.
9577,Wearing a mask  really depends on how many unvaccinated people you are around.
9578,"Also, if you live in a home with anyone who is vulnerable or can't be vaccinated, it doesn't hurt to mask up when you go places where you will be indoors around people, assuming you don't know their vaccination status."
9579,Common sense told me to keep my mask on no matter what.
9580,"In fact, I went back to using my p100 respirator for extra protection because people are now shopping everywhere without mask thanks to CDC."
9581,The one time you don't want words to evolve.
9582,Everyone medically able to receive the vaccine should be mandated to take it.
9583,"It's not more effective, that's the thing."
9584,"Wearing an N95 mask in public for a short amount of time, while being fully vaxxed, is significantly more effective at preventing my kid from getting it from me or my wife than it is for me to *not* wear a mask in public but one around the kid."
9585,It's really not that hard.
9586,"The others just recommended masking, they did not require them like LA County did."
9587,"Pasadena may or may not require them, but as of now LA county is the only place in the entire nation mandating masking indoors...and based on what I've seen so far compliance is iffy at best."
9588,Number 1 killer of LEO is coronavirus according to this site https://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2020
9589,"On an individual level, don't worry about the variants of concerns such as Delta If you are fully vaccinated."
9590,"Obviously there are some exceptions such as individuals who have received solid organ transplants, have primary immune deficiency, elderly, etc"
9591,This is an amazing analogy
9592,[removed]
9593,you can be young &amp; normal weight and not die but you might end up a long hauler.
9594,"i know of plenty young, athletic people who are currently suffering the effects of covid over a year from infection."
9595,If were those deaths in the last couple of months that might paint a different picture ...
9596,"Going back to February when we (the US) had an absurdly effective vaccine against the dominant strains (alpha, etc.)"
9597,is disingenuous because the real test is when delta came on the scene.
9598,Checking the Texas dept of health website it doesn't look like they have vaccinated fatalities data available.
9599,"I haven't stopped with all of the potential risk at the locations I have to go, including my domicile station."
9600,"As soon as they heard that most states said you don't need to wear a mask (which they barely bothered practicing until HQ sent out a letter) the masks haven't been on in the office section for a couple of weeks now, I'm in and out of there as soon as I find the parts I ordered."
9601,I still don‚Äôt have access to authentic medical grade masks that fit well.
9602,"Lots of websites claim to be legit, but how can one tell really?"
9603,It would seem self protective masks are a permanent staple of American life now.
9604,Excellent masks should be cheap and plentiful and yet they are neither.
9605,What‚Äôs going on here?
9606,"&gt; Don‚Äôt know who told you that, but they‚Äôre wrong."
9607,"To somewhat defend (as that seemed an honest question), the original phrase II/III study from the clinical trial, at least for Pfizer-BioNTech, only monitored for symptoms (and so would pick up anyone that needed hospitalization), it didn't involve checking participants to see if they were infected but not showing symptoms."
9608,"So when the study came out, the researchers correctly said that they were able to show a significant reduction in symptoms and in hospitalizations, but it didn't mean that the study had shown that people weren't getting infected."
9609,"Unfortunately, a lot of bad media coverage represented that as ""the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting infected"" rather than ""we don't have data yet on if the vaccine prevents you from getting infected""."
9610,"Later studies *did* look at this and show that infection rates also drop significantly, but the confusion often stems from bad coverage early on because the researchers didn't claim more than they could prove, and ""infected by asymptomatic"" and ""not infected"" couldn't be distinguished in the initial wide clinical trial."
9611,But I get why they'd be cofused on this.
9612,Are you more concerned with your daughter getting COVID or being the only person wearing a mask?
9613,"She will be ostracized if she does virtual school, she might not be ostracized if she wears a mask."
9614,I‚Äôd say send her to school and let her mask up.
9615,"At this point masking has become a cultural thing, similar to religious garb worn in schools."
9616,"This all sounds pretty equivocal:

&gt;Coronavirus infections leading to long-haul Covid-19 in fully vaccinated people are **probably** very rare, experts say."
9617,...
9618,"But for many Covid-19 long-haulers, it was a mild infection that set off their lingering symptoms, leaving many to wonder whether a mild breakthrough case in someone who is fully vaccinated could do the same."
9619,.
9620,"..  Dr. Natasha Altman, a cardiologist at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, agreed that **it may be too soon** to understand the vaccines' effects on long-term Covid-19 symptoms."
9621,"...  **It is possible that down the road we may discover that maybe the vaccine only delayed the inevitable**,"" he said."
9622,The sources quoted seem to be hedging pretty heavily.
9623,Obviously we hope it's true.
9624,Long term symptoms is proof of strength!
9625,[deleted]
9626,"When will the Delta variant ""pass"" in the US?"
9627,"And by that I mean this: it first showed up in India in April, but now Delta cases are getting low over there."
9628,"It took them 3-4 months for Delta to ""pass"" over there."
9629,"Now the first thought I had is that it will take that same amount of time here in the US, but you can't really compare India to the US."
9630,So you think we'll be out of the Delta storm in September or something like that?
9631,Or is it gonna be longer than that?
9632,No.
9633,Because that's a dumb argument to make.
9634,"I can wear a mask for the 14 hours a day around my child (I work from home, have for years) or I can wear a mask for the.."
9635,"I dunno, 30 minutes I'm in a grocery store or 5 minutes I'm at the sandwich shop?"
9636,"An N95 is remarkably effective against particles, which with my full vaccination is basically bulletproof versus COVID, so why would I choose to wear a mask around my child at home but not one in public?"
9637,We've seen that breakthrough infections are happening with the Delta variant far more than with the previous strains.
9638,"Again, third time: it's not about me."
9639,It's about others.
9640,I'm all for masks if it seems like the delta variant is getting out of control but I dont think we should lock down again.
9641,"1) the vaccines we have are effective against delta to lesser but still substantial degrees

2) we have much better understanding of the progression of the disease and thus treatments at various stages

3) it was bad for people's mental health to be in lockdown."
9642,It was a necessary evil but at a certain point people who are unvaxxed and are partaking in risky behavior are doing so at their own peril.
9643,I don‚Äôt have the slightest understanding of how vaccines work.
9644,I‚Äôm no medical professional and this pandemic has made me very anxious about my health.
9645,I‚Äôm gonna ask every question I can think of because how else can I become better informed?
9646,It‚Äôs alittle unsettling to be called suspect for trying to engage in a positive way and being honest about my ignorance and concerns.
9647,"In the U.S., pretty much anyone can get a vaccine so why still push it so hard?"
9648,I agree with the overwhelming of the hospitals but that still seems like a lame excuse at this point.
9649,"We are a year in a half into this, if you haven't yet been scared into getting a vaccine that is not going to change now."
9650,"If this virus is as bad as you guys think, these unvaccinated people will eventually encounter a experience where someone they know gets it bad which could scare them into getting vaccinated."
9651,"All this pushy propaganda and cult like slogans like ""trust the science"" make people less likely to get and not want to get it out of spite 

I want as many people to get vaccinated as possible but I believe its a personal health choice that no one else needs to know"
9652,Ventura too.
9653,The comment you‚Äôre replying to is not very good.
9654,"You technically could still catch it, but it is highly highly unlikely."
9655,Once you're fully vaccinated.

9657,What science are you following?

9659,Read the title it says 43 who died were unvaccanated

9677,"In the lab experiment, researchers compared a small number of blood samples from 10 people who had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and 17 people who had received either the Pfizer or Moderna shots."

9792,I‚Äôm vaccinated and have done my part.
9793,Under no circumstance will I wear a mask to protect someone who is too lazy or ignorant to get vaccinated
9794,Welcome back to the gym.
9795,I love working out without the mask and am back on it too.
9796,I‚Äôm in alliance with you.
9797,There‚Äôs absolutely no way I‚Äôm putting on the masks again.

9799,I agree!
9800,"And largely, I have moved on in my life -- things are getting better!"
9801,I'm just taking a small step to protect my child who can't be vaccinated yet.

9822,yeah friend at my job was vaccinated and just recently got it.
9823,def wasnt asymptomatic either.
9824,i never stopped wearing a mask or double masking (i'm the only one in my family who can get vaccinated because of different auto immune conditions or age) but i'm guessing about 30% of people i see are masking right now (up recently due to the spike in cases).
9825,I live in the Keys and we‚Äôre done here.
9826,Couple folks still do it but that‚Äôs about it.
9827,Note: I am one of the people who is done
9828,Vaccines work by familiarising your body with a virus and preparing it to be able to fight it.
9829,"Your body will still actually have to fight off the virus if you become exposed, and that process isn't always immediate."
9830,"In many cases it happens before the virus would even be detectable in your system, though."
9831,Always has been
9832,"The UK has used more Pfizer than Moderna, so they have more data."
9833,"Also, I bet Pfizer has its own army of analysts aiding in these studies."
9834,"Moderna was just a few hundred people in an office park before all this, so they probably don‚Äôt have as many resources to help with this kind of analysis."
9835,100% agree on how skewed peer-reviewed can be skewed.
9836,"I can say `The paper looks all right to me', which is sadly what peer review sometimes seems to be."
9837,"Or you'll be pouring all over the paper, asking for raw data, repeating analyses, checking all the references, and making detailed suggestions for improvement?"
9838,Which is rare.
9839,"I‚Äôm assuming you are vaxed, it is OKAY to move on with your life."
9840,You don‚Äôt have to live in last year forever.
9841,Things are getting better.
9842,It‚Äôs going to be okay
9843,It's crazy because none of this is new information.
9844,We always knew breakthroughs would be possible and variants would be more likely to do it.
9845,But I guess we didn't shout it from the rooftops.
9846,I think we‚Äôll be in a better place once kids can get vaccinated.
9847,Doubt that will be by September but it shouldn‚Äôt be too far off.
9848,"Why ""consider""?"
9849,"I'm not American, but it seems commonsensical to continue wearing masks."
9850,How difficult is it to put on a mask?
9851,"But during that time, can‚Äôt you still give it to someone else?"
9852,Aren‚Äôt you mainly contagious right when you get the virus?
9853,Some lady gave it to my girlfriend.
9854,She was asymptomatic for like 4 days before showing symptoms but she gave it to me during that time frame.
9855,Wouldn‚Äôt it work in such a way where you can still give it to someone while your body is fighting it off.
9856,"I assume a lot of it is people going to the doctor for what they think is just a flu and they just test everyone who comes in as part of the check up, rather than people specifically going out for the purpose of getting tested."
9857,But I noticed you never described what ‚Äúover over‚Äù means.
9858,My state is a top vaccination state and we‚Äôve had our hospitalizations drop to near nothing despite being mostly maskless for months.
9859,To me that is ‚Äúover over‚Äù and I‚Äôm wondering what you would think of when you decide it‚Äôs ‚Äúover over‚Äù someone else critiques that if COVID isn‚Äôt 100% eradicated.
9860,I‚Äôm just trying really hard to stop the 2020 approach of the necessity of viewing Covid as a moral test where you can judge someone by seeing how much they changed their lives to stop the Covid spread.
9861,"Back then people staying home and wearing mask was basically the best we had, so we needed Covid to be a moral issue."
9862,"The game is changed though, with the disease spread all over the world it‚Äôs all about expediting the rollout of the vaccine globally and strengthening vaccine mandate laws."
9863,"My vaccinated mouth wearing a mask might visually seem like I‚Äôm helping extra, but scientifically it‚Äôs really nothing compared to hurrying up the vaccines everywhere."
9864,"For that matter, I think the biggest failure of this country right now is that we haven‚Äôt yet approved the vaccines for under 12."
9865,"I understand that it‚Äôs fast tracked as it is, but I‚Äôm not sure what people expect from waiting for September."
9866,"Either a vaccine we‚Äôve known is safe for months finally gets approved after dealing with months of bureaucracy, or the vaccine doesn‚Äôt get approved for them."
9867,"I‚Äôve yet to hear a plan for what people think is going to happen if under 12s aren‚Äôt approved to receive the vaccine, so I‚Äôm assuming (which is something I hate doing) that people basically view the vaccine as safe and only a matter of time, which again begs why not release it now if not for bureaucracy."
9868,"‚Äú MISSION, Kan. ‚Äî COVID-19 cases nearly tripled in the U.S. over two weeks amid an onslaught of vaccine misinformation that is straining hospitals, exhausting doctors and pushing clergy into the fray."
9869,"‚ÄúOur staff, they are frustrated,‚Äù said Chad Neilsen, director of infection prevention at UF Health Jacksonville, a Florida hospital that is canceling elective surgeries and procedures after the number of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients at its two campuses jumped to 134, up from a low of 16 in mid-May."
9870,‚ÄúThey are tired.
9871,"They are thinking this is d√©j√† vu all over again, and there is some anger because we know that this is a largely preventable situation, and people are not taking advantage of the vaccine.‚Äù

Across the U.S., the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases rose over the past two weeks to more than 37,000 on Tuesday, up from less than 13,700 on July 6, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
9872,Health officials blame the delta variant and slowing vaccination rates.
9873,"Just 56.2% of Americans have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
9874,"In Louisiana, health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday ‚Äî the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020."
9875,"Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since mid-June."
9876,"Utah reported having 295 people hospitalized due to the virus, the highest number since February."
9877,"The state has averaged about 622 confirmed cases per day over the last week, about triple the infection rate at its lowest point in early June."
9878,Health data shows the surge is almost entirely connected to unvaccinated people.
9879,"‚ÄúIt is like seeing the car wreck before it happens,‚Äù said Dr. James Williams, a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at Texas Tech, who has recently started treating more COVID-19 patients."
9880,"‚ÄúNone of us want to go through this again.‚Äù

He said the patients are younger ‚Äî many in their 20s, 30s and 40s ‚Äî and overwhelmingly unvaccinated."
9881,"As lead pastor of one of Missouri‚Äôs largest churches, Jeremy Johnson has heard the reasons congregants don‚Äôt want the COVID-19 vaccine."
9882,"He wants them to know it‚Äôs not only OK to get vaccinated, it‚Äôs what the Bible urges."
9883,"‚ÄúI think there is a big influence of fear,‚Äù said Johnson, whose Springfield-based church also has a campus in Nixa and another about to open in Republic."
9884,"‚ÄúA fear of trusting something apart from scripture, a fear of trusting something apart from a political party they‚Äôre more comfortable following."
9885,A fear of trusting in science.
9886,"We hear that: ‚ÄòI trust in God, not science.‚Äô But the truth is science and God are not something you have to choose between.‚Äù

Now many churches in southwestern Missouri, like Johnson‚Äôs Assembly of God-affiliated North Point Church, are hosting vaccination clinics."
9887,"Meanwhile, about 200 church leaders have signed onto a statement urging Christians to get vaccinated, and on Wednesday announced a follow-up public service campaign."
9888,"Opposition to vaccination is especially strong among white evangelical Protestants, who make up more than one-third of Missouri‚Äôs residents, according to a 2019 report by the Pew Research Center."
9889,"‚ÄúWe found that the faith community is very influential, very trusted, and to me that is one of the answers as to how you get your vaccination rates up,‚Äù said Ken McClure, mayor of Springfield."
9890,"The two hospitals in his city are teeming with patients, reaching record and near-record pandemic highs."
9891,"Steve Edwards, who is the CEO of CoxHealth in Springfield, tweeted that the hospital has brought in 175 traveling nurses and has 46 more scheduled to arrive by Monday."
9892,"‚ÄúGrateful for the help,‚Äù wrote Edwards, who previously tweeted that anyone spreading misinformation about the vaccine should ‚Äúshut up.‚Äù

Jacob Burmood, a 40-year-old Kansas City, Missouri, artist, said his mother has been promoting vaccine conspiracy theories even though her husband ‚Äî Burmood‚Äôs stepfather ‚Äî is hospitalized on a ventilator in Springfield."
9893,"‚ÄúIt is really, really sad, and it is really frustrating,‚Äù he said."
9894,"Burmood recalled how his mother had recently fallen ill and ‚Äúwas trying to tell me that vaccinated people got her sick, and it wasn‚Äôt even COVID."
9895,I just shut her down.
9896,"I said, ‚ÄòMom, I can‚Äôt talk to you about conspiracy theories right now.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ You need to go to a hospital."
9897,"You are going to die.‚Äù

His mother, who is in her 70s, has since recovered."
9898,"In New York City, workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or get tested weekly as officials battle a rise in COVID-19 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday."
9899,"De Blasio‚Äôs order will not apply to teachers, police officers and other city employees, but it‚Äôs part of the city‚Äôs intense focus on vaccinations amid an increase in delta variant infections."
9900,"The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April."
9901,"About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated, compared with about 60% of public hospital system staffers, said system leader Dr. Mitchell Katz."
9902,"Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials say the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence."
9903,‚ÄúWe have got to deal with it aggressively.
9904,"And in the end, there is also a thing called personal responsibility,‚Äù de Blasio said, urging inoculated people to raise the issue with unvaccinated relatives and ‚Äúget up in their face.‚Äù

Back in Louisiana, New Orleans officials strongly recommended that people resume wearing masks indoors."
9905,Mayor LaToya Cantrell stopped short Wednesday of requiring masks.
9906,"She said the new advisory ‚Äúputs the responsibility on individuals themselves, rather than having the city enforce a mandate.‚Äù"

9913,This misconception needs to die.
9914,This is not a vaccine resistant strain.
9915,Depending on your vaccine you could break through.
9916,Most resent studies out of Israel/UK still show the vaccine being 88% effective at preventing illness and 93% at preventing severe sickness or death.
9917,This is amazing data via vaccines.
9918,The WHO requires vaccines to have a 50% effective rate.
9919,When we started the hunt we only expected the vaccine to be 60% effective.

9946,"I think there is a general assumption that vaccinated people are less likely to pass it on than unvaccinated people, irregardless if any of the unvaccinated people already have the antibodies from previous exposure to the virus."
9947,The underlying assumption being that antibodies generated by the vaccine are somehow superior to those generated from the body's natural immune system.
9948,"There appears to be considerable pressure put on researchers to avoid investigating questions such as ""what percent of the unvaccinated people entering hospitals had previous exposure to the virus (ie."
9949,they got the virus and then recovered from it).
9950,Such questions will most likely get a researcher banned from receiving any more funding.
9951,"In this current climate, making a differentiation between unvaccinated people with antibodies and unvaccinated people without antibodies will most likely get you branded as an antivaxer."
9952,"Great piece on the inner workings of immunology, including COVID."
9953,The second to last paragraph needs to be shouted from all rooftops everywhere.
9954,"No matter how many mask restrictions or any kind of restrictions we implement, COVID will be with us forever."
9955,"&gt; In a world with endemic covid, you might catch the virus, or get vaccinated, as a kid, then get a booster with your flu shot every year."
9956,"There will probably be covid seasons, like flu seasons, in the winter; every few years, as new variants accumulate, a season might be especially bad."
9957,"You will probably get covid once every few years, too."
9958,"Sometimes it will be mild, and you‚Äôll cough and feel tired for a day or two, as with any common cold; these brushes with the virus will strengthen your immune resistance."
9959,Sometimes an infection will be worse.
9960,"Maybe you skipped your booster shot that year, or there‚Äôs a new variant on the rise; maybe you were exposed to a lot of the virus when you spent time with a friend or co-worker who was sick."
9961,"Whatever the reason, some infections may put you in bed for a week or more."
9962,"As you get older, and your immune system weakens, the chance of complications will increase, as it does with the flu."
9963,"If you grow more vulnerable, you might consider becoming more cautious about travelling or going out when a bad covid season is in full swing‚Äîyou might even wear a mask."
9964,"(Perhaps the pandemic will have inspired you to wear one to avoid the flu, too.)"
9965,"The virus will stay with us, but widespread immune resistance will have dampened its worst effects."
9966,I did the ultra-quarantine as well.
9967,I was fully vaccinated by the end of February.
9968,"I lived freely again for almost 4 months, but yesterday I put my mask back on."
9969,I‚Äôm in Louisiana and our local numbers are skyrocketing.
9970,Young unvaccinated adults in our community are intubated and dying.
9971,"Vaccinated people are getting sick, (but mildly compared to their counterparts)."
9972,I have children too young to be vaccinated and I‚Äôm so scared for them.
9973,"I kept them home last year, but I feel that two years in isolation is too brutal."
9974,We have one month before school begins.
9975,Maybe this 4th wave will have run it‚Äôs course by then.
9976,I digress.
9977,"What I came to say is that people in my community are starting to mask up again, and that‚Äôs a really big surprise considering all the whining and crying they did over mandates last year."
9978,"The same thing as ""flatten the curve"", it's dead and buried."
9979,The media can't possibly acknowledge the fact that things are improving and there has to be an endgame because then people will stop reading their shitty clickbait articles and actually go outside again instead of refreshing google news all day.
9980,Nothing will ever be good enough as long as there is a new variant with a scary name or a single anecdote about a fully vaccinated 95 year old who dies of the virus to report on as if we were living through the second black plague.
9981,That's so awful.
9982,He did all the right things.
9983,I'm fully vaccinated but I'm still taking things slow in terms of returning to normal.
9984,Which vaccine did he get by the way?
9985,"I have in the past, for a close friend."
9986,Larger question: is cancer contagious?
9987,Just asking.
9988,"I mean, this isn‚Äôt hard."
9989,"As a Canadian, this leaves me scratching my head??"
9990,?
9991,Hope was that if they told people they could completely return to normal then people would get vacinated.
9992,"Too many selfish people thought, ""why bother getting a vaccine if I still have to wear a mask!"""
9993,"You can see them regularly on this subreddit all the time, too."
9994,They're staunchly against going back to masks after they vacinated.
9995,Since this test goes against the results of the larger scale phase 3 in its results on beta variant I‚Äôm taking it with a grain of salt.
9996,"It‚Äôs too limited in too many factors (lab, not real world, small sample size etc.)"
9997,"Even putting these results forward is not good because it gives anti vaxxers fuel which may not even be true, and discounts this vaccine which is likely perfectly fine and is easy to administer."
9998,&gt; Vaccine hesitancy and low rates of vaccination among black and Hispanic communities are caused by different reasons than white communities.

10009,"Of course, it still wouldn't feel good to know you were the carrier."
10010,The risk is relatively low as a fully vaccinated person.
10011,What you want to do with that information is up to you.
10012,"I think a lot of people forgot that the CDC gave out that information before Delta became a problem here, otherwise they probably would have held off."
10013,"I know you‚Äôre just venting but please keep masking in public for the sake of kids and immunocompromised people and those in other parts of the world who don‚Äôt have the same access to vaccines, it‚Äôs the least you can do to prevent spread."
10014,"Yes it is very tiresome to protect others when there are so many people out there who only care about themselves - just think of the healthcare workers and essential workers and you‚Äôll feel a bit better about doing your part, I know it helps me."
10015,Yes.
10016,That‚Äôs the quick answer.
10017,Your doctor can guide you in the correct direction.
10018,Do you shave your head in solidarity with people going through chemo?
10019,It isn't preventable.
10020,Unless you mean with vaccines.
10021,"Roughly 25% of the population has a first dose now, so that's good."
10022,"Brazil is vaccinating *extremely* fast now, and their Gamma cases are cratering as a result."
10023,Then isn't the issue is that certain people just won't listen to scientists and they're the ones causing the problems?
10024,This is tough because fresh research out of Israel is showing that while there a breakthrough infection there are fewer breakthroughs with the natural immunity vs vaccine.
10025,With that said nobody who previously got covid and had the jab has gotten the delta so I think that‚Äôs enough reason for me.
10026,"If it makes you feel safer I support that, just don't pass judgement on vaccinated people for following the guidelines about not wearing masks."
10027,"I'm not accusing you, but similarly I've seen a lot of redditors doing that as well."
10028,We don't need lockdowns.
10029,Just crackdown on unvaccinated people.
10030,Require vaccines for everything.
10031,"Busses, school, etc."
10032,Get us up to 80% and we will have herd immunity.
10033,Christ almighty.
10034,Do the math.
10035,A properly fitting N95 mask + double vaxx in public essentially makes you bulletproof.
10036,"This is fact, even against the Delta variant."
10037,"Taking the small extra step to wear a mask for, at most, 45 minutes a day is a small inconvenience (especially in a part of the country where voluntary indoor mask compliance is extremely high, so I feel like it's also a sign of solidarity) doesn't seem like a big deal, and it's something I'm happy to do."
10038,"I acknowledge and trust the science which is why when I read that the Delta variant might only be 80% or 70% effective against infection when you have a double Pfizer (versus 98% with the previous strains), that I'm going to mask up in public to protect unvaccinated loved ones."
10039,So why would I wear it at home instead?
10040,This isn't hard.
10041,Didn't Britain just say that the MRNA vaccines actually more effective at keeping people from getting sick enough to end up in the hospital.
10042,As for the unvaccinated?
10043,I hate to say this... but they're doing this to themselves.
10044,"I'll do it if I can get a more compelling reason to do it besides ""you should care about people who refuse to vaccinate."""
10045,I stop caring about people who have had more than a year to prove they cared about anyone else but themselves.
10046,&gt;Good friends who are sick?
10047,"Avoided

Isn't this what most people do?"
10048,Most people aren't rearing to throw parties if they're stuck in bed with a fever.
10049,"Furthermore, influenza spreads best 24-48 hours before people start showing symptoms, so consider yourself lucky."
10050,More and more that seems incorrect.
10051,"It sounds like you are less likely to pass it on, but if you're going to pass it on to anybody, I imagine it would definitely be your kids, cause of all the prolonged close contact."
10052,The CDC established masking guidelines and recommendations.
10053,Almost every state followed those.
10054,Now the CDC is recommending that masks are not necessary for vaccinated.
10055,And look at all the mandates lifting.
10056,See the problem there is assuming that people who share my point of view don‚Äôt care .
10057,"A lot of us got vaccinated because we care, and we helped those we love get vaccinated because we care, and I know a lot of us even volunteered to help others get vaccinated ."
10058,But care can only really go so far.
10059,You can‚Äôt help people who don‚Äôt want your help.
10060,"We can only wish them the best, and continue to live our own lives."
10061,Behavior driven by being determined NOT to catch a respiratory virus was definitely the core of it.
10062,What?
10063,Yeah that‚Äôs going to be a no from me
10064,"&gt;things are improving

Are they?"
10065,Everything is going up again due to the Delta variant.
10066,55-64 was only like 55% vaccinated last time I checked and everyone above that was 72%.
10067,Yes you‚Äôre right that younger ages are the issue but it‚Äôs still pretty poor overall.
10068,Won't happen.
10069,"Be the paranoid one and don't be afraid of that, but also rest easy knowing that both you and your partner are vaccinated."
10070,"Even if they do become sick with covid, they likely will not get severely I'll."
10071,You will be alright.
10072,I pulled up Worldometer's global daily death graph.
10073,I would consider everything before October 2020 'wave 1' because the mid-year local maximum wasn't higher than the prior one and the valleys between May &amp; October 2020 are roughly the same.
10074,I'd consider wave 2 starting in October 2020 but does it end at the next big valley in mid-March 2021 or the valley in early July 2021?
10075,Considering a wave 2 ending in mid-March 2021 discounts countries like India who were already starting their 2nd wave by then.
10076,Maybe the waves are better described by continent/region?
10077,This would allow for continent X to already had 3 waves while continent Y had 2 in the same time range.
10078,I guess we'll see someday after this is long over what are considered waves or if the word will even be used anymore in epidemics.
10079,"Do you think a place like that has many people that get tested, even if they're sick?"
10080,I'm worried because my university is allowing Sinovac that has only 50% efficacy.
10081,"Okay, time to dust off the old P1000 respirator"
10082,"You also have unhealthy older people with respiratory illness like copd, that are almost there and any disease is likely to tip them over the edge."
10083,"Not yet, but it is an inevitability."
10084,"Israel, for instance, is looking into a 3rd booster shot."
10085,The unvaccinated will create a new variant that is more resistant to current vaccines.
10086,This on top of the efficacy of vaccines against the Delta variant having already dropped.
10087,"&gt; Wednesday's study found that two doses of Pfizer's shot was 88% effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, compared to 93.7% against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as previously reported."
10088,"&gt; Two shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective against the Delta variant, up from 60% originally reported, and 74.5% effective against the Alpha variant, compared to an original estimate of 66% effectiveness."
10089,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-doses-pfizer-astrazeneca-shots-effective-against-delta-variant-study-finds-2021-07-21/
10090,Not cool bro.
10091,There's like a .2% chance you're done for!
10092,Are people still seeing masked kids?
10093,I can‚Äôt remember seeing any since the mask mandate was lifted here.
10094,I went today to grab some groceries and saw a ton of kids who appeared to be under 12 and not a single one was masked.
10095,"This is NOT to say one way or the other about the vaccinated and their masks, I‚Äôm genuinely curious about what others are seeing."
10096,Not sure what would be considered significant numbers.
10097,"Anecdotally, I've heard of way more cases of breakthrough infections since delta started cropping up."
10098,That just makes sense given the variant is much more effective at replicating.
10099,A more effective virus changes the baseline.
10100,"Before, the vaccine was pretty good at keeping you from getting sick at all."
10101,Now it's about staying out of the hospital.
10102,"If that's the new baseline, even vaccinated people can be reservoirs that spread covid (unwittingly)."
10103,I‚Äôm not sure I even care about ammunition for those anti-vaccines people.
10104,"If the mandates will protect the kids and unable to be vaxxed people, it‚Äôs worth it to me and I‚Äôm happy to do it for them."
10105,I‚Äôm just done with the anti-vaxxers.
10106,Who cares?
10107,"They can just keep freaking out and spreading lies, nothing makes them stop and they‚Äôre just crazy."
10108,It‚Äôs not fair to vulnerable people to let their crazy impact safety.
10109,We all need to grow up a little and suck it up for the masses.
10110,"There's a viral pandemic, you can make faces at people, and it helps with allergies."
10111,"I wish I could disable this, I'm tired to seeing this shit"
10112,Nice of America to keep it closed for our Canada's sake tbh
10113,It's 50/50 according to intelligence experts in the article.
10114,Nature has a good summary.
10115,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01529-3
10116,When we had actual mandates we had compliance.
10117,"Even compliance of the disinclined, because enough store managers and community leaders and other shoppers were on board that the mandates actually mandated."
10118,And because there were no exceptions there was nowhere to hide.
10119,"Some people wore masks badly, but it was rare to see even a single person without."
10120,Honestly before being vaxxed I worked in retail sales all year and was exposes 4 times and lived with it in my loft for 10 days and never got it so my already natural some how immunity plus this vaccine I‚Äôve just been living my life.
10121,"the misinformation being that if you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask?"
10122,because vaccinated people absolutely can and will spread the virus to other vaccinated people
10123,This isn't the kind of answer where nuance is appreciated or helpful.
10124,"You said it yourself: people want ""yes"" or ""no."""
10125,Make it easy.
10126,It's the one part of their day where they get to interact with all the people they hate with nicer cars.
10127,"They're not going to miss out on putting their shopping cart in the middle of the isle and deciding on pasta shapes for 10 minutes, pretending not to notice they're blocking the guy standing next to them waiting for them to make up their mind."
10128,How are they going to posture effectively with a mask on their face?
10129,"Yep, I‚Äôm doing it for the employees who have no choice but to be out in public everyday."
10130,I‚Äôm doing it for the kids of single parents who don‚Äôt have any option but to take their too-young-to-vaccinate child into the store with them.
10131,I‚Äôm doing it for the healthcare workers who have to deal with the sick people everyday and are really freaking tired.
10132,I‚Äôm doing it for the immunocompromised and elderly who might not have good immunity.
10133,I‚Äôm doing it for the people who don‚Äôt know that they have a health condition that predisposes them to severe Covid.
10134,"I‚Äôm doing it for my kids who can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet, and everyone else‚Äôs kids."
10135,I‚Äôm doing it to set a good example.
10136,I‚Äôm doing it so I can see people I love with more confidence that I won‚Äôt spread it to them.
10137,I‚Äôm also doing it for myself because I don‚Äôt want to get it again and feel weird for 10 months afterward.
10138,Gunshot wombs is the most tragic and not funny error I've ever read.
10139,It's based on the fact we don't know everything about covid yet and im taking common sense caution when it comes to a new highly contagious virus.
10140,I'm not going out of my way to get it because the CDC said it was ok to.
10141,Nothing worse than a crisis of people‚Äôs own making.
10142,"but 99% protection is 99% protection, regardless of what happened in the control group."
10143,"Unless they are saying that the vaccine itself doesn't deliver 99% protection... rather, it's around 88%, but then other protective factors (which are shared by the unvaccinated group) bump it up to 99%."
10144,"I'm just trying to understand how you have a double vaxxed group where 99%+ didn't get covid, and that somehow equtes to 88% efficacy :)"
10145,"I had a glimmer of hope when we were vaccinating 3 million people a day, but the crash has been rough."
10146,You are totally in the right here in feeling this way.
10147,Especially with the confusion and so many of the people preaching continued mask wearing and distancing breaking those rules themselves!
10148,Don‚Äôt listen to the people on here calling you a whiny little baby for feeling this way and acting like it‚Äôs nothing.
10149,It‚Äôs incredibly passive.
10150,Was that an XKCD reference?
10151,"You know, it‚Äôs not fucking us who needs to wear the mask."
10152,It‚Äôs the people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated.
10153,Our masks are less effective at protecting us than other peoples masks are effective at them not infecting us.
10154,I am curious to know how many breakthrough infections of Delta end up passing themselves on.
10155,Please read the posts from the number of vaccinated people who are infected with symptomatic Covid over at /r/covid19positive.
10156,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as low as we want it to be.
10157,I never stopped.
10158,Not having a cold for a year has been awesome.
10159,[deleted]
10160,&gt;If we‚Äôre honest I‚Äôll still get sick the moment I step back into full time office work though.
10161,And this is why I mask up at work as well.
10162,Maybe not forever but certainly a long time.
10163,I do not care what others think.
10164,"&gt;for what reason should vaccinated folks keep following these measures, to not get infected?"
10165,Then i have some bad news for you if you think you can avoid getting infected.
10166,"The goal is to help keep the spread low among the unvaccinated, not to stop the vaccinated from getting sick."
10167,"Unfortunately, I think that's a lot of where the confusion comes in."
10168,"The only way to completely avoid COVID is to basically check out of public life, but why do that when you can simply just wear a mask in public?"
10169,"The perspective is that vaccinated people are about as safe as a person in a normal flu season, and such a low chance of risk doesn't merit extraordinary action."
10170,"It's a valid argument, although the other side has merit too."
10171,Always has been.
10172,Aren't vaccines given out for free in America right now?
10173,I certainly considered it.
10174,Then after much deliberation I decided against it.
10175,"I mean, those of us keeping track kept telling people to take precautions and then get vaccinated precisely so we wouldn‚Äôt have to do all this stuff anymore, and so we wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with community-impacting resurgences from variants."
10176,People whined like toddlers that they would inevitably be told to keep wearing masks forever for no good reason and refused to take precautions or get vaccinated.
10177,Now they‚Äôre acting like this wasn‚Äôt the self-fulfilling prophecy we told them this behavior would cause ages ago.
10178,"I will mask up on  trains and in airports the rest of my life, no question."
10179,I‚Äôll probably wear them for most grocery/pharmacy runs now too.
10180,May as well.
10181,I like not being sick.
10182,If we‚Äôre honest I‚Äôll still get sick the moment I step back into full time office work though.
10183,But that‚Äôs what Covid was like for most people before the vaccine.
10184,Cases are rising rapidly in blue areas as well.
10185,"Think of it this way: you might have the virus in your body, and it might be mutating, but if you aren‚Äôt coughing and sneezing because your immune system is kicking the virus‚Äô ass, then it is very unlikely that it will spread further."
10186,"Yes, I'm beyond saddened and frustrated at what my neighbors are doing in this city."
10187,I wish there were a better way for us to distribute the unused vaccines to countries that wants them.
10188,:/
10189,"&gt;In Louisiana, that state‚Äôs Health Department reports 711 patients were in the hospital as of Monday, July 19."
10190,"&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Jonathan Eaton, a critical care doctor at Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport, said they have a plan in place in the event beds start to overflow."
10191,"‚ÄúIt was almost a year ago this week where we relocated all of the women and children off of the main King‚Äôs Highway campus and St. Mary‚Äôs campus to create that surge capacity in the event the numbers continue to rise.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Other Louisiana hospitals are cracking down in response to the rise in hospitalizations."
10192,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBeing a Level I trauma center, we have patients coming in with gunshot wombs, stab wounds and motor vehicle accidents daily that are also requiring those ICU beds,‚Äù Eaton said."
10193,"‚ÄúSo while the ICU may not be just full with COVID patients, the ICUs are staying full with sick people.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;His main concern during this latest surge in COVID-19 cases is the new age group being impacted."
10194,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe best thing we have is being vaccinated."
10195,Don‚Äôt think because your 30 to 40 years old you‚Äôre invincible to this.‚Äù
10196,Vaccination doesn't prevent infection.
10197,It prevents *serious* infection.
10198,"However, when you're 90+ years old and already on deaths door, *any* infection can be serious."
10199,You could kill yourself sneezing too hard and falling over at that age.

I don't believe there are mask mandates in California outside of LA county."
10244,I know people in CO that havent gotten their second dose.
10245,Common thing i hear is lost vax card and general unsureness about how to go about getting a second dose and still be considered fully vaccinated by the state.
10246,That could also potentially be a reason for missed doses but thats doubtful to be any real amount of those people.
10247,My guess is most had a bad response to the first dose and decided to not do the second.

10259,"&gt;  
&gt;Hospitals are far from the critical point they reached in January, when some 3,000 people were being treated at one time, but the fast-spreading Delta variant threatens to worsen the situation barring a rapid increase in vaccinations, said Dr. Donald Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association."
10260,[deleted]
10261,We've always been at war with Maskasia.
10262,I largely agree with you.
10263,I just think the primary reason the flu was basically non existent this past year was because of people isolating from others much more than masks.
10264,"In a world where everything is fully normal except people wear masks in public, I would expect the flu to be much higher than winter 2020,  but still less than say winter 2019."
10265,Masks are a great tool in a pandemic for the exact reason you stated but in my opinion it was people‚Äôs behavior which really drove the flu down this past year specifically.
10266,Because muricans want to be free

10268,&gt;The state‚Äôs largest hospital is at capacity with COVID-19 patients.

10271,"According to UAMS officials, 56 patients are in the hospital fighting the virus."
10272,Twenty-five of those patients are in the Intensive Care Unit and 14 are on ventilators.
10273,Health officials warn that could happen at more hospitals in the state if the trend continues.
10274,"‚ÄúIt's real and it's dangerous and if you're going to take something seriously, this is the time to, maybe, be a little bit more open minded about it,‚Äù said Dr. Benjamin Davis, director of surgical and critical care."
10275,"‚ÄúIt feels like we're already to the level of how we were during the surge last year."""
10276,The battle against COVID-19 is far from over and doctors are UAMS said the hospital is at capacity.

10278,Is anyone talking about how common breakthrough cases are with people who have had COVID *and* the vaccine?
10279,I had Covid in December 2020 and got my second dose of Moderna in March.
10280,I wonder what my risk is like.
10281,I agree - do you really want to get COVID from the grocery store?
10282,Like is it worth the 15 minutes of not wearing a mask in the grocery store?
10283,Like who gives a fuck....not like it is some big imposition.... if you are going to risk getting COVID (while vaccinated) risk getting it for something fun.
10284,All these people who are just way too inconvenienced and angry to wear a mask while shopping.... why?
10285,WTF are you missing at the grocery store with a mask on??

10294,Fauci seems great at explaining points like this.
10295,"It would be helpful to have some guideposts to help me evaluate the risk, as I can't do this without expertise advice."
10296,Maybe rank 1-5 level of risk based on vaccination rates and positivity rate in each county.
10297,This would be more in line with having a clear message as well as incorporating some nuance.
10298,"Right now, overall I just feel like I am getting unclear mixed messages: the CDC currently doesn't recommend vaccinated people wear masks, but you may want to."
10299,What?
10300,Maybe part of the problem is that the science isn't clear yet on whether vaccinated people wearing masks has a significant impact on the spread of Delta variant.
10301,I get we are learning more information as time moves along.
10302,But to me it just feels like the recommendations just suddenly change without any clear communicated criteria for the decision.
10303,"The sudden announcement that vaccinated people are done with the pandemic will be near impossible to walk back, should the need arise like possibly now."
10304,The political push back doesn't help.
10305,I suspect mostly I am angry at the news sensationalizing any science report into click bait.
10306,I remember a while back all the articles coming out about particle physics where scientists measured neutrinos moving faster than life.
10307,The headlines asked if this was physics beyond the standard model and relativity.
10308,The paper essentially begged the community to figure out where they made a mistake in their calculations.

10315,"However, they won't diagnose or advise specific treatments."
10316,"More accurately, they won't disclose their diagnosis to the patient."
10317,"They may strongly suspect, for example, that a patient has coronary artery disease or diabetes, based on what they can observe, and a few pointed questions."
10318,"They will tell that person, with more or less urgency, that they should see a doctor."

10369,"Abstract

BACKGROUND

The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom."
10370,The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear.
10371,"METHODS

We used a test-negative case‚Äìcontrol design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating."
10372,Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status.
10373,Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients‚Äô vaccination status.
10374,"RESULTS

Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines."
10375,"With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant."
10376,"With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant."
10377,"CONCLUSIONS

Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses."
10378,Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose.
10379,This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations.
10380,(Funded by Public Health England.)
10381,"Reports of people asking for the vaccine as they‚Äôre hospitalized is somehow an entirely new level of ‚Äúwow, our education system has really failed people‚Äù and/or these people are just beyond clueless."
10382,"That‚Äôs not how vaccines work, southern states."
10383,This post appears to be about vaccines.

10391,Yep.
10392,People thought I was paranoid at work for continuing to wear a mask.
10393,I knew a case blowup was imminent.
10394,"Now they're all wearing masks, at least."

10402,"However, none of these sources claim lockdowns are preferable to vaccines."
10403,"Back in the day, vaccines weren't readily available."
10404,"Yup, covid is the leading cause of death in 78/165 deaths, or 47%."

10409,And now they‚Äôre ordering her an antibody test so they can see if she should go get a third shot to boost her immune system.
10410,Someone else that I know that had a heart transplant got the vaccine.

10414,Reminds me of the Y2K experience.
10415,"When the calendar switched from 1999 to 2000 and the projected problems turned out to be minimal, this crowd said, ""See, there was nothing to worry about!"
10416,"It was all hype!"""
10417,"Forgetting, of course, that the issues were minimized *because* of all the pre-emptive work put in by so many in anticipation."
10418,"They're ""not antivax"" because they got vaxed as children when they had no say in the matter but now that they're adults and do have a say, they're refusing to get them."
10419,I'd say that lines up with being antivax for themselves.
10420,Can you contact them to clear it up?
10421,Good point!
10422,!
10423,"Ultimately it's about the public's health, not whether they deserve free stuff or not."
10424,The small mercy being that they saved the two babies.
10425,It caused some stock market jitters too.
10426,"Even without government imposed restrictions, people will be less willing to go out and spend money if they're afraid of getting sick."
10427,My sarcastic point was that she can have ignorantly anti-vax attitudes precisely because her parents spared her the horror of some nasty diseases by vaccinating her against them when she was a child.
10428,"Because she's never felt the brunt of life altering preventable disease, being antivax seems like a lifestyle choice on the order of buying organic,  going vegan, or banning ""screens""."
10429,"Nah, my kids will wear masks and get vaccinated."
10430,why doesn't your wife's boyfriend just get vaccinated?
10431,You mean in real life or in her head?
10432,I remember it being an eastern country but I can't remember and don't care enough to Google.
10433,Have a good one
10434,Oh I agree that the vaccines certainly appear to reduce the length of the symptoms and people do recover a lot quicker.

10589,Life will always have some risk.
10590,"The vaccine mitigates much of the covid risk, the remaining risk falls in line with other diseases of normal life."
10591,Exactly this.
10592,"I don't worry about catching Measles since I am vaccinated for it, but like, I could still theoretically catch it."
10593,I believe the CDC is tracking hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people so try checking the dashboard on their website.
10594,Otherwise you can check individual state health department sites; many have just started tracking it.
10595,"We were literally running a mass vaccination center out of a local large church, with full support and promotion by the pastor."
10596,Still didn‚Äôt make a difference.
10597,"It also says a lot about the dismal failure of public education when people clearly don't know what a vaccine is, despite the whole world talking about it non stop for the past year."
10598,It would be pretty pointless to do that as the US isn't an island and hasn't banished their own citizens in other countries
10599,"Please note, the title of the article has been updated to:  

**NYPD Has Vaccinated 43% of Its Service Members Against COVID-19**

10600,Since when is one ‚Äúmuch‚Äù of anything?
10601,But once you‚Äôre vaccinated what more can you do?
10602,The vaccines are more effective than the masks.
10603,"At this point, most of the people who aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated have the option to do so."
10604,Now they‚Äôre paying the price for their decision.
10605,"If that‚Äôs not right, is the solution to go back and place restrictions on us again?"
10606,"The virus will never go away, so should we just mask until everyone is vaccinated?"
10607,"But many people don‚Äôt want too, so we‚Äôll never reach 100%."

10630,Where can one find the number of hospitalizations that are fully vaccinated folks?

10632,"It will depend some on the degree of interaction with the host community, and disease dynamics there."
10633,And also both formal and informal interaction with other schools.
10634,A very practical goal may be to turn the mask requirement on or off based on the trends they're seeing.
10635,Many of them will wish they had *wanted* it after it's too late.
10636,Pick your risk at this point.
10637,Vaccines are far less of a risk than catching covid cooties unmitigated.
10638,Especially when most people were only wearing poorly fitting cloth masks.

10650,"If the folks who are ending up in the hospital are mostly unvaccinated it not only proves that vaccines work, but it also explains why there are most positive cases than hospitalizations."
10651,[removed]
10652,Exactly this.
10653,In my state only 56% have had one or more shots and yet I see maybe 10% of people wearing one (none in rural places) and I never trusted that all those people got even one shot.

Don‚Äôt know who told you that, but they‚Äôre wrong."
10679,The vaccine absolutely does reduce the chance of contracting Covid-19.
10680,"Basically, viral particles enter your body and your immune system recognizes and eliminates them faster than they are able to start reproducing."
10681,No reproduction -&gt; no build up of virus -&gt; no illness -&gt; no shedding of virus -&gt; no chance to spread it to others.
10682,Some people don‚Äôt respond as strongly to the vaccine.
10683,"Their immune system doesn‚Äôt identify the virus as quickly, allowing it to start to reproduce."
10684,"If the immune response is sufficiently slow and weak (and the amount of viral particles you‚Äôre initially exposed to is sufficiently high), this can result in your innate immune system responding, which are the symptoms you experience like fever and coughing."
10685,If it continues to reproduce without being stopped you might have sever enough symptoms that result in hospitalization or death.
10686,[removed]
10687,Asking for the vaccine when you're already in the intensive care unit is like asking for a sprinkler system to be installed in your house while your house is already on fire.

10701,"Eh, no."
10702,"When left to it's devices, COVID spread exponentially in East Asia."
10703,Just look at the spread within the Shincheonji cult early last year.
10704,Korea went from one or two cases to thousands in a matter of two weeks.
10705,"The virus was brought under control through nearly universal mask wearing and aggressive contact tracing, as well as limited social distancing policies (closing of churches and gyms)."
10706,"In Japan, you also have intense mask usage, which seriously reduces the rate of reproduction, along with stay at home orders when case growth becomes exponential."
10707,What the case of East Asia tells us is that mask wearing and a more aggressive testing and tracing regime could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives if implemented earlier in the US and Europe.
10708,Seems like some colleges are going to be mandating vaccines and keeping up with testing in hopes they don't have to maintain the masks.
10709,Though any plan is ultimately contingent on trajectory of the epidemic.
10710,"Actually, there's active research into a [universal coronavirus vaccine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-universal-coronavirus-vaccine-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic1/) as well as a [universal flu vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_flu_vaccine)."
10711,"Neither is likely to be ready in the next year or two but if the research goes well, possibly in the 5-10 years timeframe (although maybe I'm being overly optimistic here)."

10722,"The study did not, for example, consider the potential differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated people, Shalit said, who might differ in their willingness to get tested for Covid-19 or adherence to public health guidance like social distancing or mask wearing."

10781,This.
10782,Though we might need to get that number a little higher depending on how sneaky variants are and if we do or do not do boosters.
10783,"If there's a reformulated booster I hope holdouts can get that as their first shot - anyone holding out is likely to be living a riskier lifestyle with fewer precautions as well, so strongly taking them out of the spread game would be a huge win."
10784,I'm glad too.
10785,And I hope they can make them widely available to the poorest people fast.
10786,That was early data of a *single* shot against *symptoms*.
10787,They are saying from February to now.
10788,So it's possible that a chunk of these people didn't have a chance to get vaccinated.
10789,When did the rollout start in the US?
10790,Discriminating against people based on skin color...
10791,"Turning away unvaccinated patients at an at-capacity hospital and prioritizing patients whose issues couldnt have been prevented by a free, easily accessible vaccine.... Yeah, totally the same thing."

10803,We're fine.
10804,90% vaccinated
10805,Clearly taken out of context to make it look like the vaccine lowers your defenses.
10806,Fortunately this one is bad so people will notice it's incomplete.

10829,"Shits second nature to me now, idk why vaccinated people are acting like its such a burden lately."

10831,I keep hearing dumbass millennials and Gen Xers go on about ‚Äúthe side effects of getting the vaccine‚Äù as if being out your ass for a few days is somehow worse than covid.

10845,"Many people get the rabies vaccine pre exposure if the risk-benefit ratio makes sense, like zoo and vet workers."
10846,Glad to hear!
10847,"Stay healthy, friend!"
10848,"I remember when the vaccine came out there were a lot of idiot comments like ""heh, so all of a sudden there's a cure now after the election?"
10849,"I am very smart"""
10850,Just got home after receiving the first vaccine dose (pfizer)!
10851,Finally!
10852,I would say comical.
10853,It‚Äôs like we are living in a current long running episode of the thick of it
10854,Question: Is it true that the vaccines influence fertility?
10855,What information can you give me about the Pfizer vaccine?
10856,"Canada, only after first dose."
10857,Not enough data for two doses: https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-covid-vaccine-effectiveness-protection-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-2021-7
10858,"Message contained in mRNA and enclosing of that mRNA also affects efficacy of the vaccine (I think, I am not a professional)."
10859,And probably there are lots of other variables as well that‚Äôs what I was trying to point out.
10860,Too bad these people can‚Äôt put their energy towards positive things to actually help their communities.
10861,They are obviously searching to be a part of something.

10863,we just came back from Barcelona where covid cases are the highest in Spain.
10864,"I am fully vaxxed, but I still remained cautious (masking indoors, using hand sanitizers, properly washing my hands regularly) luckily my buddy and I did not contract covid."
10865,Vaccinations and precautions are your safest bet.

10886,You were responding to my thread in this post.
10887,Figured I should point that out.
10888,"The Israeli data was posted multiple times over on this sub over the last few days, so everyone saw that and assumed it was a reliable study."
10889,But they have yet to explain why their results are completely different from literally every other one.
10890,At some point we have to start treating the Israeli study (which isn't even really a study to begin with) as accurate and stop assuming we need to compare every other one with theirs.
10891,Reaping of the mentally sleeping.
10892,I think photos and videos would help just like it did for Vietnam War.
10893,"People saw children in iron lungs dealing with polio firsthand, sadly it will take seeing children coughing or choking to death from lack of air to get it through their skulls."
10894,Private companies deciding to make it mandatory to hold a job.
10895,Provides the illusion of free market making the decision
10896,Apparently the HSE vaccination centre near where I live requires the cell phone to be turned off in the place it is given.
10897,Has this medical reasons or is this related to crazed antivaxxers?
10898,I use my cellphone to speak when stressed (situational muteness) and medical situations stress me out...
10899,"Hey, no worries!"
10900,It's easy to fall into and that's why it works.
10901,"In past few years, I've taken to not believe anything as full truth until I'm able to independently source the information from somewhere else."
10902,"It's super easy to Google things these days :)

My rule of thumb with news is, if it's scary it's probably at most only half true!"
10903,Because there are too many and it doesn‚Äôt paint a full picture.
10904,I work in a high-risk position.
10905,Several of my friends do as well.
10906,We‚Äôre all vaccinated.
10907,"A few of them have tested positive due to regular mandatory testing, but they never had *any* symptoms and neither did their families (many of whom are unvaccinated minors)."
10908,"They did their 10-day isolation, tested negative, and went back to work."
10909,It doesn‚Äôt really matter if those kinds of breakthrough cases happen because it just stops the chain.
10910,"No passing on covid, no symptoms."
10911,That‚Äôs what we want vaccines to do.
10912,We want the vaccines to fight off the virus so effectively that we never show symptoms and don‚Äôt pass it on.
10913,"That being said, there‚Äôs a difference between a 30yo childcare worker who tests positive, remains asymptomatic, and doesn‚Äôt pass it on to her family, compared to an 80yo with a breakthrough case who has symptoms and now needs to be hospitalized."
10914,"We‚Äôre trying to stop the latter, but the former was pretty much the goal."
10915,"This may be weird to say but I legitimately think people don‚Äôt understand you need to get vaccines PRIOR to exposure (in most cases, you think about things like the rabies vaccine which you get post exposure but I don‚Äôt think most people realize that it does mean there‚Äôs a chance it doesn‚Äôt take...)

I think we earnestly need a basic education campaign around a few things: 1) vaccine must be had prior to exposure or it won‚Äôt work."
10916,"It‚Äôs not a treatment option, it‚Äôs a pretreatment option."
10917,"2) many immunocompromised folks or folks with existing medical conditions are able to get the vaccine, especially the MRNA version."
10918,3) it‚Äôs free freeeeeeeeeeeee.
10919,"They will believe that until their last strained, clawing gasp."
10920,"You can show them this article and explain that their immune system will have to go through this long process with the delta variant and any future variant,  potentially losing valuable time and letting the virus take a deadly hold."
10921,"With vaccines, they verify that the antibodies you are getting work with each new variant, and if they don't work with a variant, they tweak the vaccine antibody and give you a booster for that variant."
10922,You don't know if the antibodies your body specifically came up with will be effective against variants.
10923,There is no control on what possible antigen target your natural immunity is using.
10924,There are hundreds of possibilities and they can all mutate at any time.
10925,My concern with the breakthrough infections (the patient will likely be fine) is that every infection is a chance for a vaccine resistant mutation.
10926,"It starts out unlikely, but once you get into 1 million cases/week the odds start to stack up."
10927,Okay.
10928,"Good answer, I guess."
10929,"Thankfully, the odds are still quite low for kids to get sick from it, especially with transmission rates suppressed by the vaccine."
10930,"For my own family, masks just aren't worth it anymore, especially considering the grief we get for them living in an area that is not exactly majority in favor of masks."
10931,But I respect your decision too.
10932,There should be one hospital in every reason where covid patients aren't allowed so procedures can happen and heart attacks etc can be treated.
10933,People shouldn't have to be exposed to covid because they need dialysis.
10934,Full FDA approval would help a lot I think.
10935,Plus once the vaccines have full approval schools and businesses can start making them mandatory.
10936,[removed]
10937,Silly to downvote.
10938,But my understanding is that Moderna and Pfizer use the same type of mRNA technology.
10939,They used primed mRNA.
10940,CureVac has a technology using native mRNA.
10941,"They somehow got around the problem with using native mRNA some other way (that I don't understand), but not good enough it seems."
10942,Yeah I'm mostly worried bc of the kids
10943,I‚Äôm not sure.
10944,I thought I heard somewhere that they did experiment with two doses but eventually scrapped the idea when it made little difference (at least at the time).
10945,Also I‚Äôm pretty sure J&amp;J finished development later than AZ.
10946,AZ got major authorization for use in December 2020 while J&amp;J didn‚Äôt until February-March 2021
10947,Is there any study about delta variant though?
10948,"Is so please, share."
10949,I hope it is effect≈üve don‚Äôt get me wrong.
10950,But I won‚Äôt assume anything.
10951,Mom here.
10952,I would worry
10953,I'm so tired of that argument that the unvaxxed weren't wearing their masks to begin with.
10954,Might be the case in the deep areas where the government and leaders never got behind the mandates - but it is absolutely untrue in areas like LA county where even the anti-vax people complied to get in the door.
10955,That shit made a difference.
10956,"Fauci is saying masks are *unpopular*, not ineffective."
10957,Reading comprehension for the win.
10958,"So, basically a lockdown without declaring one?"

10976,I thought that was what Kansas and Missouri were.
10977,"Yup, I quit wearing a mask for about 3 weeks and put my mask back on 2 weeks ago when the numbers started surging in Florida."
10978,It sunk in that nobody else was going to get vaccinated.
10979,I'm going to be wearing a mask for the rest of eternity while my fellow Floridians keep passing different versions of the same preventable virus back and forth FOR YEARS.
10980,It will never end because of them.
10981,I think you should read what OP said again.
10982,On what grounds you can assume Moderna and Pfizer should have same results?
10983,I got a vaccine for that.
10984,My job is done.
10985,[removed]
10986,Honestly I'm at a point where I don't care any more.
10987,I took covid seriously because I cared about society before.
10988,After the past 4 years and especially after 2020...
10989,I don't think I do any more.
10990,[removed]
10991,Because Moderna's use is heavily concentrated in the US; and more recently in Canada but there isn't enough data yet to draw conclusions from.
10992,"Pfizer meanwhile is essentially the world's vaccine of choice, so it's no surprise that there's more data looking at it."
10993,We were notoriously bad in MO at the beginning.
10994,We were sending 1000s of vaccines to places that had like 100 people.
10995,Some had to drive across state 4 hours to and from home to get the vaccine.
10996,It‚Äôs just about sorted out but can see why some may have given up or were just fed up with all the vaccine availability.
10997,I loved seeing all the people at what was once called Edward Jones Dome getting their first shots along with me a few months ago.
10998,Hopefully we keep doing this every time we need to update our shots.
10999,"People are hysterical here, and aren't being objective about the real numbers."
11000,"They're stuck in damage control mode, and while that's understandable, it's also sad."
11001,&gt; Why combine it?
11002,To try to make a bigger scarier number?

11012,I feel like it's too late for us in Alabama.
11013,We are right at the beginning of the totally preventable surge in cases and even if people get vaccinated (which they aren't) the virus still spreads faster than the vaccine takes to reach immunity.
11014,The kids are going to suffer here because the stupidity of adults.
11015,It's based on being overly cautious.
11016,And that's it.
11017,"And that's fine, for some people."
11018,For my own part I need data first.
11019,"I still trust the experts on this, and right now the people who study these things say the risk is incredibly low."
11020,"IF the variants actually start demonstrating widespread vaccine resistance, I'll change my own behavior again."
11021,"But right now things can be normal, and I will enjoy it while it lasts."
11022,"I don't mean to sound insensitive, so forgive me if I do."
11023,"But I think the vaccine is definitely doing its job and a lot of this ""covid resurgence hype"" is, while technically true, largely a product of traditional news media trying to cling to the last big wave of covid fear for clicks and views."
11024,"If you want to put your mind at ease, simply google the hard covid numbers now and compare to any time last year."
11025,Also see that like over 95% of hospitalizations now are from unvaccinated people.
11026,(I don't know the exact stat but you can probably Google it.
11027,It's crazy high).
11028,"Also transmission rate for vaccinated people is super low

Hope this helps!"
11029,Yeah that ‚Äúwear a mask for others‚Äù business is bad advice now.
11030,I stopped wearing cloth masks last summer when I was able to find *self* protective masks.
11031,"We all need access to affordable, self protective masks."
11032,Delta wont be the last.
11033,"Work, food, etc are all necessities to survive."
11034,Going to the gym is a recreational thing.
11035,"Also, people at the gym are sweating on equipment, breathing heavy, and running around touching equipment that others touch regularly."
11036,Puts a higher risk of infection imo.
11037,"Yup, I'm still wearing a mask because my 10 year old can't get vaccinated."
11038,My family has an unnamed clotting issue.
11039,We clot really fast.
11040,My cousin's 12 year old kid died of Covid because he ended up with a ton of clots everywhere.
11041,I'm forced to face the risk that even a mild case of Covid could kill me if it's enough to trigger that clotting issue that Covid already causes on its' own.
11042,"Sweden just passed 75% of adults with at least one dose, and will soon pass 50% being fully vaccinated (currently 47.6% of adults are fully vaccinated)."
11043,Polls show that up to 90% of eligible population intends to get vaccinated.
11044,Everybody 18+ can now get vaccinated since a few weeks ago.
11045,Vaccinations will open for 16+ as well as 12+ with comorbities in August.
11046,Age distribution can be found at https://www.svt.se/datajournalistik/corona-vaccin/ (in Swedish).
11047,Sure look guilty
11048,"I'm not saying I agreed with it, just that it was a reasonable argument."
11049,Personally I don't think lockdowns make sense at this point but believe we should keep mask mandates.
11050,"We went through this last year, can't stomach it again :("
11051,"Require proof of vaccination/negative test to do things like go to school/work, shopping, eating at restaurants."
11052,Make it well known just how contagious the Delta variant is.
11053,&gt;And the Delta variant is 10-times more infectious than the original SARS virus.
11054,"To put that in real terms, back when I got infected in March 2020 with the original virus, you would have to be in a closed space within three or four feet of someone for about 10 minutes to be assured of picking up the infection."
11055,"With the Delta variant, all you have to be is in contact with them for about one minute, maybe a little less, and you‚Äôll pick up this virus."
11056,"I don‚Äôt think the public has quite understood that yet, but we‚Äôre finding out in a real way."

11097,[removed]
11098,Research (e.g.
11099,from anti-smoking efforts) shows that humans react more to social cues.
11100,I.e.
11101,"don't scare, but shame them."
11102,"Social conventions would also help: no entry into public spaces(including offices, malls, etc...) without vaccination certificate."
11103,"&gt; some truly are more afraid of the vaccines than covid

I've never seen someone truly afraid of the vaccine."
11104,"Its full blown conspiracy theories and ignorant, not someone who is legit afraid of the vaccine."
11105,They don't want Bill Gates to control them.

11111,"Only some of the people I work with are elderly, but most are at risk."
11112,A lot of people don't realize how severe mental illnesses and severe physical health issues go hand-in-hand.

11115,I got vaccinated early on due to my career.
11116,No one will anymore they don‚Äôt care
11117,doesn't seem very scrupulous
11118,Immunity is a trial and error process as this article describes.
11119,"Like learning a new skill from someone who knows how, vaccines let immune systems learn from others, rather than through trial and error."
11120,The time saved saves lives.
11121,Vaccines are created by researching existing cases of illness and immune response to find the keys to fighting new invaders.

11133,That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs different about these vaccines.
11134,The flu also uses the spike protein.
11135,The spike protein looks kind of like a penis.
11136,"With the flu vaccines, we targeted the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the spike protein."
11137,That changes rapidly.
11138,"With the covid vaccine, we targeted the shaft which is much less likely to actually mutate."
11139,"This has also led to advances of the flu vaccines as we originally thought it would have been significantly more difficult to target the shaft, but thanks to covid we know it can be done."
11140,"In summary, the part of the protein we targeted is different."
11141,"When an organism‚Äôs immune system encounters a foreign molecule (typically a protein) for the first time, specialized cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells capture the molecule and begin breaking it down so that it can present these antigens to B cell lymphocytes."
11142,"Once Antigen Presentation to the B cell lymphocytes has occurred, a process known as Somatic Hypermutation allows the B cell to begin coding for a new antibody that will contain a unique Antigen Binding Site in the variable region that is capable of binding specifically to an epitope from the antigen."
11143,Each B cell lymphocyte produces one unique antibody against one unique epitope.
11144,"Once antibodies with sufficient specificity to the epitope can be encoded, the B cell begins to release antibodies into the bloodstream."
11145,These antibodies then bind specifically with the foreign molecule and allow the immune system to eliminate the molecule from the system.
11146,"In some cases, these antibodies can disable pathogens such as viruses directly due to the binding action."
11147,"In other cases, such as with bacterial pathogens, these antibodies bind to surface proteins on the bacterium‚Äôs surface, thereby signaling to the rest of the immune system that the pathogen should be destroyed."
11148,"After the foreign molecule has been eliminated, B cells remain in the bloodstream ready to produce antibodies if the antigen is encountered again."
11149,"From the perspective of developing a custom antibody against a protein antigen, the immune system captures the protein, breaks it down into individual epitopes and presents these epitopes to the B cells so that development of antibodies specific to those epitopes can begin."
11150,These antibodies can then be collected directly in the serum or by isolating the individual B cells that produce antibody against the epitope of interest.
11151,"With a full-length protein antigen, there will typically be multiple B cells generating antibodies against multiple epitopes from different regions of the protein."
11152,"I don‚Äôt go that far, but on occasion have been known to call a six page unit test a ‚Äúquiz.‚Äù ;)"
11153,At this point the pandemic will be among the unvaccinated.
11154,The vaccinated have done all they are going to do to keep the anti vaxxers safe.
11155,They will get their antibodies the old fashioned way.
11156,But these people didn't care about you the entire pandemic.
11157,"They weren't the ones staying home, social distancing and wearing masks."
11158,Why should we protect these people?
11159,Anyone who wants a vaccine can get it at this point and these people have decided not to.
11160,So again why should we protect these people?
11161,I'm so sorry you had to go through that after giving birth.
11162,I didn't say it wasn't working.
11163,The majority of the cases are tested at testing sites where symptomatic people go.
11164,The majority of the symptomatic people tested are fully vaccinated.
11165,"I can't find an English option for the Icelandic articles, but this site has a lot of good data:

https://www.covid.is/data"
11166,Anti-vaxxers don't care if the virus mutates around the vaccine since they had no intention of getting it in the first place.
11167,"I heard someone say the other day that it's better not to get it because the vaccinated people will get whatever variant bypasses the vaccine, and the anti-vaxxers will get the normal covid that they don't believe is dangerous."
11168,They literally think they can kill off liberals by letting the virus mutate.

11175,I also got it after moderna.
11176,I was weak as hell with a fever for 4 days.
11177,But no drainage or lung issues.
11178,My thing is if you are going to tell these people to go the extra mile give them the right fucking information.
11179,If these vulnerable people go out in their cloth masks it isnt going to do shit for them in the current no-mask environment with an even more infectious Delta Variant.
11180,These people need N95's now as the infected are all largely unmasked.
11181,Otherwise you are giving them a false sense of security by telling them just to use a mask to feel safe.
11182,I feel it will be better solely due to the existence of vaccines.
11183,"Even though the delta variant exists, it‚Äôs been shown that you have a better chance with the vaccine and your body fighting the variant than having no vaccine and your body fighting it."
11184,I‚Äôd rather have something similar to those side effects I had when taking the shot than struggling to breathe in an isolated hospital room possibly thinking to myself that this is the end.
11185,I‚Äôm feeling we‚Äôre entering a similar stage to what we usually did with stuff like the flu where most people probably take the shot every year or so while some don‚Äôt.
11186,"Sadly with Covid, we probably don‚Äôt have the luxury of being so hands off like we do with the flu as with the flu there‚Äôs Tamiflu that can be given to you if detected early."
11187,Perhaps when we reach that point we‚Äôll truly be in ‚Äújust like the flu‚Äù scenarios.
11188,This on and off until most people just suck it up and take the vaccine will probably be our lives for the next couple of years until better treatment comes.
11189,"If this is how mixed our response to the vaccine is now, it can only be assumed it will continue."

11195,There are no published journal articles on it.
11196,That‚Äôs my point.
11197,Your Facebook browsing doesn‚Äôt count.
11198,I honestly am not sure if that will ever happen.
11199,One thing about this virus is its uncanny ability to mutate.
11200,I think at a minimum we will have to take yearly boosters and seeing as how we have pretty shit turnout so far.
11201,Not everyone is as upset about a piece of fabric as you are.
11202,But he‚Äôs not.
11203,"88% have 1st dose in UK

69% have 2nd dose."
11204,"Our infection rate is rising, but deaths lagging significantly relative to previous infection spikes."
11205,The infection rate was approximately the same as it is now on 1st Jan 2021.
11206,"However, death rate was 600 daily average versus 50 daily average now."
11207,Basically less than 10% the previous mortality rate thanks to vaccination.
11208,Astonishing that places in the US have such poor vaccination.
11209,I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted.

11216,I saw the results of the current COVID-19 season.
11217,Didn‚Äôt seem to do the trick did it?
11218,Which one are we talking about.
11219,Also pretty sure lockdowns played a part in low flu numbers.
11220,Hard to get sick if you‚Äôre working from home and kids are learning from home

11238,Went from mostly my sinuses to my lungs today.
11239,Got tested a couple of days ago after my daughter brought it home.
11240,"I'm in the same boat here, vaccinated with unvaccinated kids."
11241,I'm not exactly sure why this lady wearing a mask would have had diffierent outcomes.
11242,"The CDC made the decision back in May which was pretty much game over for masks.Had this lady wore a mask it would have most likely been a cloth mask which is basically useless at protecting you from infection, especially Delta."
11243,The science around masks was you wore it to protect others from you.
11244,If you are the only one in the store wearing a cloth mask it isn't doing shit to protect as the infected people are all around you unmasked.
11245,Its just a useless security blanket at that point.
11246,"In the current unmasked environment we are in now with a more infectious Delta variant, unless you are using an N95 or respirator your cloth mask is useless and just theater plain and simple."
11247,"&amp;#x200B;

We have the CDC and anti-vaxxers to thank for this current round of the shit show we are in now."

11252,We all knew that people would take advantage of that.
11253,Absolutely disgusting and selfish human beings.
11254,"Not that it exists, but that it STILL exists to this degree and is allowed to mutate and grow stronger in this country."
11255,The saddest Reddit stories are the healthcare ~~people~~ heros who tell stories of people coming into the ER who insist covid is a hoax.

11257,You can change languages in the top right corner.
11258,Maybe one day people will stop and think about how they politicized a pandemic that killed millions of people and be a little self conscious on how they took simple steps to prevent the spread so personally.
11259,"If we know one thing, it's that Clapton would never put a needle into his body or insufflate chemicals of unknown effect."
11260,The only people getting this bad are unvaccinated.
11261,It‚Äôs something like 99%.
11262,The only reason to vax would be to show solidarity or something dumb.
11263,"The more unvaccinated ppl, the more the virus will mutate."
11264,We now have the deadlier delta and lambda variants bc of this issue.
11265,"Some ppl can‚Äôt get vaccinated: cancer patients, HIV ppl, children, etc."

11274,"That depends on your definition of ""end this particular pandemic."""
11275,Do you mean ‚Äúone dose‚Äù as in one dose of a two dose vaccine (partially vaccinated) or do you mean ‚Äúone dose‚Äù like J&amp;J.
11276,If it‚Äôs the former 57% against Delta is rather high for partially vaccinated compared to other findings I‚Äôve seen in the past.
11277,"If it‚Äôs the latter, well that would be unfortunate"
11278,How long should the 2nd dose side effects last?
11279,"I‚Äôm almost at 72 hours and my fever has calmed down a bit, but my chest muscle pain has moved to both of my forearms and it‚Äôs so painful."
11280,"I‚Äôve heard the side effects should only last 1-2 day, so now I‚Äôm starting to worry a bit."

11295,It‚Äôs just I‚Äôm not sure how good PCR Tests are at differentiating between COVID-19 that‚Äôs been completely neutralized by the vaccine‚Äôs antibodies and an asymptomatic breakthrough infection
11296,"I mean, Florida dropped the mandate a while back."
11297,The only difference is the vaccinated had the choice to drop their masks.
11298,KF94/N95 protect the wearer with near 100% efficacy.
11299,To be honest before the vaccine came out I figured 80% would be on the lower end at this point.
11300,Very unpleasantly surprised that my state is stalling out around 60% and that‚Äôs actually really good compared to some others.

11348,Ok this makes sense!
11349,"No vaccine is 100% perfect, But by giving people better protection against it, so if enough people have say 80% protection from the vaccine (just throwing a number out there."
11350,Not sure how you‚Äôd quantify protection from a vaccine) eventually the probability of spread/illness becomes so low that it‚Äôs a negligible risk?
11351,Already seen breakthroughs with all vaccines..... don't believe the news... especially if from the companies themselves
11352,NY does.
11353,They used it for events for a little bit but then they just opened everything
11354,I live in a place where health care is socialized and I still don't ask my doctor but EVERY health decision.
11355,"I remember one time a nurse looked at me funny for not having asked my doctor about something and I'm like bro I don't work in a hospital, my doctor has limited time I'm not gonna pester them"
11356,It takes 2 doses and a high percentage of the entire population that can be infected.
11357,Same where I live and mine has stayed on too.
11358,Yes a little bit of common sense and a dash of collaboration and this really would be mostly a thing of the past.
11359,"I realize most of the lack of Desire to collaborate comes from one party and states dominated by that party but the White House has been messaging this is over for some time and has embraced lifting restrictions at all levels, including re-opening schools."

11361,"Yeah, in my city every chain drugstore (and some supermarket drugstores) are offering vaccines."
11362,I walked by one drugstore today and they were offering free vaccines and there was noone there.
11363,Sad freaking story before masks were a thing this guy came into work with a mask it irked me so hard and I teased him about it then lo and behold a month later we all were wearing masks lmao

11366,It's fascinating to observe smooth-brain logic!

11372,Must be such a wierd feeling to be so self absorbed.
11373,In Asia they were masks all the time to be considerate of people around them and to keep them from getting sick.

11375,"Hopefully you learn some empathy in college, you're going to need it."
11376,Then why didn‚Äôt they stop wearing their mask after they were vaccinated?
11377,He continued wearing his mask despite being vaccinated - despite the CDC recommendations.
11378,Unless they have a legit reason to not get vaccinated for health reasons - it‚Äôs highly - highly - unlikely a person that voluntarily chooses not to be vaccinated would still wear masks.
11379,Why bring up New Zealand?

11381,Can I ask why?

11406,My worry is that WHO might be saying this so J&amp;J people don't go around taking up additional shots from people who need them.
11407,This is similar to who the US Government told us early that we don't need masks because they're worried there would be a mask shortage in hospitals.
11408,But I live in America where there's currently a surplus of vaccines and if I take an additional jab it doesn't prevent someone else from getting one.

11417,"If colleges that require vaccines should be masking, when will we ever be done with the masks?"

11420,"The full interview of Fauci does give more context to it, but the headline is so floppy that it is misleading."

11422,"Imagine asking a person out on a date, and they say back to you, ""I might want to consider going a date with you."""
11423,Those people who didn't get the shots are the same people who complained about masks and every other precaution imposed on them.

11429,You literally might see one person in a supermarket wearing one now.

11431,The unvaccinated REALLY need to consider vaccination.

11433,Do tell ‚Ä¶
11434,It's not 100%.
11435,"The more people who are vaccinated the lower your chances are of getting it,  hence the term Herd Immunity."
11436,One vaccinated person exposed to a room full of unvaccinated people who are coming and going among others who are not vaccinated is by no means home free.
11437,"But the more of the people in that room that are vaccinated, the less likely that one person is to catch it because each person vaccinated is at lower risk."

11580,"[Update](https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202107210015)

Taipei, July 21 (CNA) The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Wednesday said Taiwan recorded 25 new cases of COVID-19 and that 1.21 million people have made appointments to get their first COVID-19 vaccine shot between Friday and next Thursday."
11581,"Of the new cases, 16 were domestic infections and nine were contracted overseas, Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said at the daily CECC press briefing."
11582,"Nine of the domestic cases were reported in Taipei, five in Taoyuan and two in New Taipei."
11583,"Nine had known sources of infection, four had no apparent links to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases, and three were still under investigation, Chen said."
11584,"When asked about the potential lowering of the nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert, which has been in place since May 19, when northern Taiwan was grappling with a sudden surge in cases, Chen reiterated that it will happen if case numbers remain stable."
11585,"The CECC will release guidelines regarding lifting COVID-19 restrictions under the Level 3 alert in the next two days, including easing the ban on indoor gatherings of more than four people and outdoor gatherings of more than nine people, Chen said."
11586,"Of the nine imported cases reported Wednesday, three involved Philippine and Taiwanese nationals who traveled recently to Taiwan from the Philippines and Indonesia."
11587,"The remaining six cases were four Indonesian nationals and two Burmese nationals who are suspected of having been smuggled into Taiwan, Chen said."
11588,"Acting on a tip-off, Coast Guard officials seized a Taiwanese fishing boat in waters near Tainan early Tuesday morning and found eight people illegally aboard the ship, according to the Tainan City government."
11589,"Six of the eight people tested positive for COVID-19, while the other two and three registered crew members on the ship tested negative."
11590,"Prosecutors are looking into the case, and the vessel's fishing license has been revoked, according to the Fisheries Agency."
11591,"To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 15,478 COVID-19 cases, of which 14,011 are domestically transmitted infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic."
11592,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 778, with all but 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data showed."
11593,"Also on Wednesday, the CECC said that of the nearly 1.53 million people who are eligible to make an appointment to get their first COVID-19 shot from July 23-29, 1.21 million, or 79.3 percent, have done so."
11594,"The rest have until Thursday noon to make an appointment, either through¬†the government vaccination system, the national health insurance (NHI) app, or by going to a convenience store or pharmacy contracted by the NHI, according to the CECC."
11595,"To date, 5.52 million people in Taiwan have received their first COVID-19 shot, which translates to 23.5 percent of the population, while 154,493 people, or 0.6 percent, have received the two doses needed to be fully vaccinated, CECC data shows."

11726,&gt; Right 'cause we're totally gonna be 60k cases a day forever.
11727,**This was not your standard.
11728,"** You said,

&gt; Why even risk the possibility of being sick or spreading it to someone else?"
11729,That is a possibility when there is even one case per day.
11730,Pick a standard and say what it is.
11731,You haven't done that.
11732,&gt; Too many Americans are selfish oversized children who don't understand the meaning of shared sacrifice.
11733,Yes.
11734,But don't gaslight the vaccinated.
11735,The oversized children are the people who refuse to get vaccinated.
11736,We don't need to sacrifice at all--we just need to require vaccines.
11737,&gt;  Masks cause no harm and are not a big deal.
11738,"I still wear my mask, but one harm (for example) is that mandatory masks are not logically consistent with indoor dining."
11739,"I am very against punishing businesses, employees, and people who like dining out just to protect those too selfish to protect themselves by getting vaccinated."
11740,Sure but most people are not ending up long haulers.
11741,We need to be more honest about this.
11742,We don‚Äôt have a crazy amount of statistics on this but one Israeli study suggested only about 5 percent of patients had symptoms 6 months later.
11743,On top of that we have a lot of reasons to believe long haulers will be less likely after vaccines given long term symptoms are much more common in severe cases and vaccines reduce severity.
11744,At a certain point risk is a part of life and the risk posed by covid to most healthy vaccinated adults is not crazy high.
11745,"My dude, the truth is society has accepted the risk."
11746,Maybe you haven‚Äôt and should bump it up to N95/Kn95.
11747,"No, others aren‚Äôt responsible to subsidize your risk tolerance, only you are"

11749,My NYPD cousin-in-law is vehemently anti-vax.
11750,"He's actually choosing not getting the vaccine over seeing his elderly grandmother, because she won't let him visit until he gets it."
11751,"I asked him what it'd take for him to feel comfortable getting the vaccine and he said he never would, he doesn't trust it."
11752,"That's my secret, Fauci."
11753,I'm always masked.
11754,[archive link for anyone who has trouble accessing the article ](https://archive.is/2021.07.22-002845/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/health/coronavirus-olympics-testing.html)
11755,That‚Äôs what I thought.
11756,Anti lockdown is way different then anti vaccine.
11757,The confusing part.
11758,Is get vaccinated and mask up and lockdown.
11759,I got vaccinated so I wound not have to lockdown and mask up.
11760,Right?
11761,Or is this wrong?
11762,I really don‚Äôt know anymore.
11763,Yeah.
11764,"I just joined a community knitting group (I'm mid 30s and everyone else is 70+) and I'm attending meetings fully masked because even though I'm vaccinated, I go to the gym and have somewhat daily interactions where I'm putting myself at risk and I don't want to get those sweet grannys sick because of my lifestyle choices."
11765,I believe that both are pretty similar in that they contain the full length sequence of the spike protein with a small substitution to increase stability of the resulting protein.
11766,"The sequences are also similar but may vary more in the up and down stream sequences which are regulatory sequences, not translated, that determine stability and other factors."
11767,"At some point in the near future, we'll be hearing more and more stories about vaccinated people with medical emergencies dying unnecessarily, not getting timely treatment because the hospital is flooded with unvaccinated Covid patients."
11768,"Once these stories are in the national spotlight, will that be a tipping point where we see a harsh backlash against the unvaccinated?"

11772,Biden talked about it in high regard the same day the CDC made the announcement.
11773,Of course the CDC talked about this with the Whitehouse.
11774,"Did Biden order it, personally?"
11775,"No, but he was definitely spoken to about it, (he's the head of the federal government) and talked it up along with them."
11776,It was part of his road to 70 percent plan.

11783,I can understand how it feels this way.
11784,I truly do.
11785,I think this is a demographic we do not yet understand.
11786,How do we help someone like this?
11787,Can we truly help them?
11788,This particular patient seems to have an old fashioned mentality.
11789,"The one where you go to the hospital, lay in bed all day and get served."
11790,We now know that bed rest is one of the worst things a person can do for their health.
11791,Even a week of bed rest is associated with poorer prognosis.
11792,You can only truly help a person as far as their personal ideas of health will allow.
11793,"I‚Äôm sure he got education about why it was better to do the breathing exercises, get up and walk, etc."
11794,He declined.
11795,I‚Äôm positive his long term health will suffer for his poor decisions and he‚Äôll have to live with that.

11797,"I'm not anti-vaxx, but deathly afraid of needles."
11798,"Generally, I avoid flu shots and other minor vaccinations because needles stress me out."
11799,I genuinely will pass out cold if I get a shot.
11800,"I watched my grandmother die a few years ago in the same way that many people die from covid; lungs infected, full of fluid, on a ventilator."
11801,It's terrible.
11802,Not a way I want to go.
11803,"The difference is, my grandmother was able to die with her children holding her hands and the rest of her family there in the room."
11804,"When you die from covid, you're in the room by yourself or maybe you have a nurse who you have never met in the room with you."
11805,"Remembering that and not wanting any possibility of it, I was in line for the vaccine as soon as I could be!"
11806,I had a few close calls and luckily was able to avoid it.
11807,"In fact, after my second close call I stopped going anywhere but work (which is pretty well ventilated) until I got my shot."
11808,A month after my second vaccine I finally went to a small house gathering.
11809,Someone had covid and spread it to everyone there.
11810,One person ended up in the hospital.
11811,Only one person didn't get sick (me).
11812,A vaccine is more effective than a mask at reducing spread.
11813,The problem is the unvaccinated not the vaccinated not wearing masks.
11814,Vaccinated Health care workers aren't quitting in droves in advance of the massive Delta Wave due to fear for their own physical health.
11815,"They are quitting due to fears for their mental and emotional health because they know shits going to get real bad and emotionally taxing having to deal with masses of people struggling to breath and coding on them every day again like how it was for months at a time in previous waves.....but to make matters 10 times worse, the majority of those people catching it from the Delta Wave will be the anti vaxxer loons, so the health care workers will have to deal with the emotional pity for the 50% of them showing despairing regret and the emotional rage for the other 50% of them who are still denying Covid is real, spouting CT nonsense and abusing staff all while they take their last breaths."
11816,"All the virus needs to do,is change the spike."
11817,It's one mutation.
11818,It's totally possible.
11819,The vaccine taught our cells how to destroy the spike protein that attached the virus to our cells.
11820,"The fact that delta can make us sick with the vaccine, tells me that the spike has already changed a little bit."
11821,Apparently Blue Lives don't matter that much to Blue Lives.
11822,"I think it was a gamble, I know several people who got vaccinated because they could stop wearing masks (including those with young children)."
11823,"I think we underestimated variants, and it‚Äôs going to come back to bite us."
11824,Also as a devils advocate I don‚Äôt think the article mentions that they know for sure the vaccinated adult brought it first.
11825,It could have been the kids getting it first.
11826,Why would someone fake cough in front of a person wearing a mask?
11827,"Would make more sense to fake cough in front of a person not wearing one, to scare the shit out of them"
11828,Never stopped wearing masks everywhere ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11829,Fully vaccinated people living with family members who are at risk (one is very obese the other is a 60 year old diabetic) and not vaccinated: what if any precautions are you still taking?
11830,"I'm not looking fot an answer from anyone not in this situation, as I already know that if I was just a dude on my own that I'd have absolutely no reason to worry about the virus after my shot."
11831,My question stems purely from the carrier risk for them.
11832,They dropped it at 15k a day with Delta waiting in the wings.
11833,We had just shy of 60k cases yesterday and people still running around talking about how the CDC was right.
11834,[removed]
11835,[removed]
11836,Never stopped.
11837,The science says : vaccines are 95% protective.
11838,So that means 1/20 exposures will get me infected.
11839,Masks are 80% protective.
11840,Which means 1/5 exposures will get me infected.
11841,Combined they are 99% effective.
11842,It's been already 5  and a half weeks.
11843,I'm getting it asap.
11844,But I 'm worried.
11845,"r/nonononoyes

Is this the first time you‚Äôve had any variant?"
11846,"Yeah, good point, might be a GDPR thing."
11847,I choose to trust the scientists at the CDC.
11848,"They say vaccinated don‚Äôt need to wear a mask, then that‚Äôs good enough for me."

11850,I am fully vaxxed and currently covid positive.
11851,"Im doing okay, relatively speaking."
11852,I am quarantining in an isolation hotel.
11853,Pretty sure I caught it going maskless at ‚Äòvaccine only‚Äô event.
11854,I feel stupid for assuming I was safe.
11855,Edit* PLEASE get vaxxed if you are able.
11856,Might be the reason I‚Äôm still able to type this out.
11857,"From what I've read about the Israel study is that they're rigorously surveillance testing everybody, even those completely asymptomatic or with mild sniffles."
11858,"In most other countries, if a vaccinated person gets the sniffles for a day or two, more often than not, they believe it's a cold and dont think anything else of it."
11859,A lot of times people arent like OMG AM I A BREAKTHROUGH CASE
11860,"Same, it is only a minor inconvenience and might actually help, even if it's a very small impact"
11861,I'm sorry to be so blunt in the event that people you care about fall into this category...
11862,But isn't it pretty much just Darwinism at this point?
11863,"Excluding the small percentage of immunocompromised, etc?"
11864,Who?
11865,"Yeah, except they're not isolated from the rest of the country."
11866,I'm guessing the parent comment was referencing leper colonies?
11867,Maybe some islands in Alaska or something?
11868,They can create their utopia of perfect freedom from vaccination and whatever else they think is oppressing them.
11869,And here I'm thinking that everyone would learn that the only way past this is getting people immunity.
11870,Though vaccination or naturally.
11871,Despite a few insane people pushing to go the natural way initially we realized that would cause massive amounts of deaths and put society on hold for a year until we have vaccines.
11872,Now we're there and have vaccines.
11873,Vaccines better than most scientists ever hoped for.
11874,And vaccinated the most at risk part of the population as soon as we could.
11875,It's not a question of mad.
11876,That would be stupid.
11877,It's a question of frustration.
11878,Of sadly realizing that you can't save everyone.
11879,Don't you feel that when you read some of the stories here?

11955,&gt; Should Children Get COVID Vaccines?
11956,"What the Science Says

Short answer: **Yes."
11957,"**

From the article:

&gt; Data show that children and particularly adolescents can play a significant part in coronavirus transmission, says Catherine Bennett, an epidemiologist at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia."
11958,And concerns about transmission by children and adolescents are growing as new coronavirus variants emerge.
11959,"It‚Äôs possible that more-transmissible variants will develop a way to push through whatever it is in a young person‚Äôs immune response that makes them more resistant to infection, says Bennett, making it all the more important that they are vaccinated."
11960,"Dark, but effective."
11961,I know.
11962,"I feel like my family member should have been more selective about who they hang out with, and told her friends they couldn't hang out indoors together until they got their shot."
11963,"Especially since they have a kid under 12, who has also now tested positive."
11964,Insane is right.
11965,Lotta mask wearers don't trust the science showing vaccines to be very effective.
11966,"Well, 98.x% vaccine effectiveness against death and \~50% vaccination rate means that if 20000 people would die from Covid without the vaccine, then \~10000 are vaccinated and \~10000 aren't, but of those vaccinated, you would still expect 100-200 to die anyways."
11967,The low number of 43 out of nearly 9k actually suggests that vaccines are &gt;99.5% effective against death.
11968,I know :( hang in there.

12310,It‚Äôs as good of a time as any to drop the mask mandate and the cdc has honestly earned a lot of goodwill from me.
12311,That's not the important question...
12312,Does the effectiveness drop over time?
12313,"Is it 70% for the first 6 months, then drops as the vaccine wears off?"
12314,"If so, the people who already had their shots need to plan for regular boosters."
12315,"Sorry to hear it, I am also a long hauler and it totally sucks."
12316,"I see comments how there just ""isn't that much risk"" but you'd think in the midst of a pandemic where a highly infectious strain has emerged and where we are still studying the data that people would at least err on the side of caution."
12317,"Okay thank you I‚Äôll make sure to do one, appreciate you."
12318,"Do you think that my sisters have it, because they‚Äôve got a positive result from the government and a negative self test result and are showing symptoms?"
12319,One of my sisters even napped in my bed which would increase the chance of them giving it to me as well
12320,Had a dangerous cancer removal surgery (head) back in December.
12321,It was somewhat botched by the surgeon and I had to have emergency plastic surgery within 18 hours.

12325,"One thing I have noticed and I am wondering if other people have noticed this too, is that mask mandates often bring back completely voluntary restrictions by private businesses."
12326,Even if they don't have to and even though no one even recommends them to.
12327,"Things like dressing rooms being closed, capacity limits, and other ""minor"" restrictions which just ruin the experience."
12328,"What was supposed to be ""just a mask"" has the potential to be more than that."
12329,F U Fauci‚Ä¶.
12330,&gt; No vaccine?
12331,No job.
12332,This is already legal so there is no need for the Senate to approve it.
12333,Companies just have to decide that they want to do it.
12334,There is a significant segment of the population who would favor shopping at stores that mandate full vaccination for all* of their employees.
12335,"Similarly, there is a significant segment of the population who would prefer to work for businesses that mandate full vaccination for all* of their employees."
12336,"Market forces will help push the world toward more vaccination, but market forces alone won't be enough."
12337,"*: ""full vaccination for all"" allows for those who are legitimately  medically unable to receive the vaccine to remain unvaccinated, but IMO there should be no other exceptions"
12338,Agreed.
12339,People acting like what the CDC did was completely unjustified are overly simplifying the equation to act dramatic.
12340,"I think there were pros and cons to making their mask rollbacks when they did, and I think their decision was the more justifiable choice."
12341,Telling people they need to continue to wear masks after being vaccinated would have been a horrible idea.
12342,"Of course we will never see the alternative, but I'd bet our vaccine rates would be even lower than they are now."
12343,"Not only would people avoid the vaccine because the CDC's messaging would make it seem ineffective, but they would likely have started to revolt against masks anyways."
12344,&gt;A mask requirement might as well be a return to last year for me because I would rather stay home than go try to enjoy some place with a mask on.
12345,Bingo.
12346,Lmfao this thought process is wild.

12351,The elderly are the highest vaccinated group in Florida by far.
12352,"Just take a look at Sumter county

At 8000 new cases a day, the answer to the title is probably all of them"
12353,I feel like this is way too late.
12354,"Not too late because a lot of people have died or gotten sick, but rather they have pushed people beyond some point of no return."
12355,They are too invested in all of these lies.
12356,"Anti masking, antivaxxing, etc."
12357,changing their minds now is going to take a Herculean effort.
12358,Darwins revenge for stupid people being able to survive in a modern world without critical thinking skills.
12359,I know a first hand of a few cases where retail stores had over 90% of their employees get covid despite wearing a mask.
12360,"They had a break room that they went in and took off their masks and ate by themselves and whether it went through the climate control or what I don‚Äôt know, but they all definitely got it."
12361,We surpassed 50% for people with at least one dose in late May and are currently at about 49% of people with who are fully vaccinated (56.5% currently have at least one jab).
12362,"It's worth noting that these numbers are a percentage of the *total* population, including young children who might not be eligible to receive the vaccine."
12363,"Indeed, the &lt;18 demographic is far and away the least vaccinated (10.7% fully vaccinated compared with the second least (18-24) which is 42.6%)."
12364,So I think it's safe to say that a majority of U.S. adults have been vaccinated for a little while now.

12379,"This ""they rolled back the masks too soon"" argument is so annoyingly simple."
12380,The virus will be circulating and mutating for a generation.
12381,The risk will never go away.
12382,I think this more of a problem with misinformation and propaganda.
12383,We need to look at the Baltic countries for examples on how to deal with this as they have been fending off misinformation campaigns by Russia for decades.

12388,We‚Äôre going to be dealing with this shit well into 2022
12389,"Cloth is generally not that effective unfortunately, because it relies on physical filtration instead of an electrostatic charge."
12390,So filtration of the hardest to filter particles will be 10-50% with 50% or close to it being very rare.
12391,Plus they tend to have less breathability for the same reason.
12392,The difference between 50-99% (many N95s actually filter 99%+) might seem close to double but the amount of time you can be around someone who is infected without getting infected actually grows exponentially.
12393,"Of course it's still better than no mask, but the public has largely been mislead by lumping all masks together often."
12394,"I would link to sources, but the mods who spread misinformation themselves won't let me."
12395,"&gt; One was a coworker with my sister, he was 81 and in India when he was infected and died."
12396,How does that count as an NJ death if he was infected and died in India?
12397,Yes they said 50% is required
12398,In India there's 100 million+ people that are completely undocumented.

12419,People don‚Äôt know how to reconcile the fact that this virus will be mutating and flaring up in unvax circles for a generation.
12420,They think you can just say ‚Äúsee the CDC rolled the masks back too soon!‚Äù As if waiting another 2 months would have any impact for a virus that will be a normal part of our health concerns for 30 years.

12422,You don‚Äôt have to wear mask in USA if u are vaccinated ?
12423,Like u take vaccine and next day u are immune?
12424,"In my country u have to wait 2 weeks after u get full vaccination (depends which one u get as most are 2 shots )then you can visit restaurants , gyms and workplace without negative test but still have to wear mask and we do have like 120 cases daily for last month and half"
12425,I've been fully vaccinated (Moderna) since May.
12426,In June I joined a gym and have been going twice a week to high-intensity group exercise classes.
12427,"Now with cases surging, I'm questioning whether I should be doing this."
12428,"A fully vaxxed family member tested positive for COVID, with symptoms."
12429,"They weren't terribly sick but definitely had a full week + of congestion, coughing, lost taste &amp; smell, and feeling crappy."
12430,"Mind you, they live in an area with a low vaccination rate, and were knowingly hanging out with unvaccinated friends (who had to be hospitalized)."
12431,"It's hard to get a good sense of the risk because on one hand, I live in an area with a high vaccination rate."
12432,I think I can safely assume that most people in my classes are vaccinated.
12433,"On the other hand, this new variant seems sooo much more contagious."
12434,"I know it's probably not the end of the world if I do get a breakthrough case, I just hate being sick and would hate to get it after being careful for so long."
12435,"It was a probe, not first phase probe."
12436,Why did WHO conclude before get all the info needed?
12437,No country would like a second third fourth probe.
12438,You got vaccinated so you wouldn‚Äôt die of Covid or spread Covid.
12439,I did anyway.
12440,"The reasons don‚Äôt matter though, if Covid is still virulent enough in society to overtax the hospital system society must act accordingly, which means attempting to limit the spread which can only be accomplished by limiting human interaction with the virus."

12465,"There is a highly contagious virus spreading around right now, and even if you're vaccinated, you can still get sick and experience long-term side effects, so many people are continuing to be cautious about getting that virus even though they received a vaccine that would lessen its severity if they did catch it."

12491,Immunity is the ability to resist an infection.
12492,"Vaccine effectiveness can be measured by comparing different ""endpoints"" between comparable vaccinated and unvaccinated groups."
12493,"These endpoints could range from infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, all the way to death."
12494,"In clinical trials of COVID vaccines the top line effectiveness that's been reported was typically against symptomatic disease, meaning some of the people for whom the vaccine was deemed effective may have gotten infected without knowing it, but you can find the effectiveness against any of these endpoints."
12495,"Studies have found that the vaccines, particularly the mRNA vaccines, are also effective at blocking infection entirely."
12496,Contracting a virus is synonymous with being infected.
12497,"In common usage people think of immunity as being impossible to be infected, but no individual can ever be absolutely certain that they won't be infected with any given disease after exposure."
12498,Even vaccines that provide very effective lifelong immune resistance are not 100% effective.
12499,It would be accurate to say that the COVID vaccines make one immune to the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
12500,IANAD but I imagine the immune response generated by memory cells would neutralize the infection before it has a chance to wreak too much havoc.
12501,If that's true then why is there a second shot?
12502,Yeah my vaccination place let you use phone but no selfies due to privacy concerns.

12507,"I work in an animal  shelter doing adoptions and have been without warning bear hugged twice in the last week by happy adopters, which is just not cool even with out covid concerns."
12508,I plan on starting to mask up again when I go back next week.
12509,I also feel like vaccine break thru infections are way under counted.
12510,"I have a slight sore throat from some post nasal drip,  maybe a slight cold or allergies,  what the point at which you go for a covid test for the sniffles if your fully vaccinated?"
12511,"Ok my bad, not a good chance but there's a very small chance my bad on that."
12512,"But still breakthrough cases are popping up more and more and I don't want to just take a risk I just hate the part when they say ""the pandemic is over for me"""

12521,"Once you are sick, it is already too late."
12522,I got COVID about a month and a half after my second dose.
12523,So I was right in the middle of the height of immunity.
12524,Why not have only the vulnerable and the ones that want to stay in their home isolate while the rest of the world carries on?
12525,People like to say that because they think it won't affect them and then a loved one gets sick and maybe dies.
12526,The amount of time would almost certainly go down as people are expelling way more if the virus and it multiplies faster.
12527,"And you can just look at the UK if you want proof, mask mandate ended three days ago and it's looking very likely a new lockdown will be coming in five weeks (assuming anyone in the Johnson government is sane and can do math)."

12603,"The problem was that people wore chin straps, random pieces of cloth, or nothing at all, and then got surprise pikachu faced about how they got covid or flu."
12604,Lots of deleted comments by bots probably
12605,It not possible but people can't understand that.
12606,Can these facilities be sued?
12607,Does anyone know.
12608,So can you show proof that that is even possible with the vaccines use in the US?
12609,There would have to be a dramatic base protein change for any variation to get through the vaccine.
12610,Lose a little effectiveness at stopong mild cases yes but not full break through.
12611,This kind of baseless fesr mongering is why we got here in the first place.
12612,"The vaccines work well and will keep you out of the hospital and death, with any variation."
12613,"Why is this even news I listen to Sean hannity on the radio 3 days a week average and he has been   Say in since the beginning 
 Every time I hear him he says that you should take the vaccine but he is not a doctor he is not a medical professional he got his shot"
12614,"
I agree."
12615,"And it‚Äôs not as if he‚Äôs anti-vax or into conspiracies, nor extremely political."
12616,Cannot figure this out...
12617,Let's not mask kids hahaha.
12618,Sickening.
12619,Ya bunch of wierdos!
12620,!
12621,Now do the number of fully non-vaxxed people that didn‚Äôt make it and explain efficacy rates.
12622,And maybe stop scaremongering with bad headlines.
12623,"And school starts in less than two weeks where there will be no mask requirements, social distancing, etc."
12624,The CDC has made our kids sitting ducks for Delta.
12625,"At some point, you get creative."
12626,"First, it's important to realize that being safe does NOT mean foregoing seeing loved ones."
12627,You can always visit outside if needed; that's what my husband and I did throughout the lockdowns.
12628,"We'd have people over and sit around the fire outside, socially distanced, and it was fine."
12629,"Yeah, it sucked not to hug people, but it's not like we just never saw anybody again."
12630,I don't know what the solution is.
12631,I thought the solution would be vaccination because I was stupid enough to think that everyone who could get vaccinated would.
12632,"(How dumb am I, right?)"
12633,"But I've been hospitalized with severe pneumonia and other lung issues, and it's a lot easier to be extremely strict about this stuff when you've spent time lying in a hospital bed gasping for air, scared for your life - and that wasn't even COVID."
12634,Remembering that makes it an easier pill to swallow.
12635,How can you debunk something that was never asserted in the first place?
12636,The efficacy studies showed ~95% reduction in disease.
12637,Last I checked 95 is not 100.
12638,"What the vaccines do accomplish is dramatic reductions in chances of dying, getting severe disease, showing symptoms, and getting infected, in that order of reduction."
12639,"Obviously if some people show symptoms they can still transmit, but the vaccines make that much less likely."
12640,I don‚Äôt see why this is so hard to understand.
12641,Nothing has changed in this regard.
12642,It's reasonable to wear a mask indoors if you suspect most of the other people are unvaccinated.
12643,"I have been asking how, if the 10x number is a thing, that Florida hadn't reached herd immunity."
12644,Now perhaps we know.
12645,It was all optimistic bs.
12646,"it's a lot denser, boston has a higher population than the whole state of vermont."
12647,yeah good point
12648,Definitely.
12649,"The more unvaccinated people we have *world wide*, the larger the breeding ground for variants (mutations) we allow,  and the more likely we could arrive at a mutation that existing vaccines aren't effective against."
12650,It also speeds up the mutation process because more mutations can occur and propagate.
12651,It's not purely probabilistic but it provides a good framing to look at things.
12652,"Moral of the story is that the large unvaccinated population isn't just a danger to themselves (and a small percentage of the vaccinated population), they're a danger to everyone until we stop the pandemic and reduce the opportunities for virus to get another shot at us."
12653,For the short term they're largely only a danger to themselves.
12654,"For the long term, they can be a danger to everyone."
12655,"allright, good to hear!"
12656,"Idk why that is, but last month my daughter caught covid, her dad got it and I didn't."
12657,He has had Pfizer and I had Moderna.
12658,"Now there are many other factors that could have affected this, but it was interesting."
12659,But still his was like a bad cold with a mild fever.
12660,He felt crappy for like 4 days and is now fine.
12661,"He is also overweight, so I was worried."
12662,No thanks
12663,It was a very stupid from the CDC.
12664,When i have no concrete number to work with i find low-balling a good solution.
12665,It should illustrate the point of low chance still mattering in greater mass.
12666,"I could've guessed a number but it probably would've been to high, which wouldn't help somebody who's already scared."
12667,I also clarified that the real number isn't that low.
12668,i also don't understand how propaganda fits in there?
12669,You may need to elaborate.
12670,"The anti-vax crowd is ALSO the crowd that resists masking, social distancing, and any other mitigation measures."
12671,"I don't know how they're envisioning getting through this pandemic and containing the damage; they just want people to die, I guess."
12672,"Wait a sec, how do you do the math to get to 93% ?"
12673,"I would think that (4,800,000-49)/4,800,000 = 99.999917% effectiveness."
12674,Am I not doing the math correctly?

12903,I would expect many more documented cases of long Covid after vaccination if it was occurring.
12904,"In studies where healthcare workers were regular PCR-tested regardless of symptoms and compared against a similar unvaccinated group, you see a 90% reduction in total Covid cases for the vaccinated group."
12905,Many people have equated 90% to total invulnerability against ever even contracting Covid.
12906,"For me, 90% is excellent but it‚Äôs still 9 out of 10."
12907,Unlikely but not insanely rare.
12908,"Long Covid for fully vaxxed people has so few reports, I really suspect it‚Äôs 1/1000 or 1/10000."
12909,Especially when I consider my own fortunate age and health status‚Ä¶ the risk is not worth continuing the isolation and misery of 2020.
12910,I‚Äôm opening to change my priors and behavior with new data.
12911,"The government, schools, and employers can all legally mandate vaccination."
12912,It‚Äôs not complicated.

12914,Does anyone know if the 1918 pandemic also had such rampant misinformation?
12915,How was it combatted?
12916,I know there's no social media back then but there was people spreading rumours still right?
12917,What is it 70% effective against?
12918,"Infection, symptomatic illness, or hospitalization/severe disease/death?"
12919,"Because in the former two cases, these results are still good."
12920,The latter would be more than a little concerning.
12921,I personally believe until kids are Vaccinated.
12922,"Not necessarily everywhere, but places you might be around them indoors."
12923,We don't take our kids many places indoors around anyone we don't know is Vaccinated.
12924,It works both ways in my opinion.
12925,Parents need to be responsible with their kids.
12926,"Restaurants aren't really a great place to bring unvaccinated kids right now, and not necessary for them socially, and not taking them there alleviates the mask burden from others."
12927,"I'm more worried about maskless kids who may have been exposed by unvaccinated parents being packed into crowded Schools with less or no social distancing, than I am about adults in public places that are less necessary for my kids, or anyone's to be at."
12928,**[citation needed]**
12929,Lol why?
12930,This is ridiculous.
12931,Canada needs way more protection from Americans now than we do from them.
12932,They passed us up with vaccination rates last week and will keep climbing.
12933,Awesome!
12934,Don't forget to still be cautious until shot No.
12935,2.
12936,So do most deaths in the unvaccinated.
12937,Ban smoking then.
12938,Ban fast food.
12939,These are bigger killers than Covid?
12940,"Yes these are a ‚Äòchoice‚Äô, but also going outside and socialising potentially catching a flu or Covid is a choice."
12941,"We‚Äôve never ever had to force people into vaccines before, nor should we"
12942,"In order for the vaccine to be 99.999% effective in preventing deaths given a vaccinated death rate of 1 in 100,000, it would have to be the case that, if they were not vaccinated, everyone would be dead by now."
12943,Think of it this way - imagine a disease that kills unvaccinated one person in a thousand who are exposed to it.
12944,"A thousand people get vaccinated, and then are exposed to the disease."
12945,One such person dies.
12946,Is that vaccine 99.9% effective in preventing disease?
12947,"No - the number of deaths is the same as we would have gotten without the vaccine, so it's 0% effective!"
12948,"Now, obviously, the numbers for the covid vaccines are much, much better than that."
12949,"They *are* very, very effective at preventing death."
12950,But they are not 99.999% effective.
12951,That's obviously nonsense.

12996,"it was 1% in one study, but cant compare it cause only 10% got recovered vs 60% that was vaccinated vs 40% unvaccinated, so obviously since the recovered are less they were less in the delta infection numbers."

13009,I'd argue it's different because obesity is not a contagious disease.

13212,I've gotten the flu after being vaccinated... and good news was that it was super mild.
13213,Lasted about three days.
13214,(Also took Tamiflu).
13215,I've had the flu shot for the past 15 or so years.
13216,Florida resident.
13217,I was so excited to travel to see all my kids and grandkids at a birthday gathering in may.
13218,"I was really looking forward to visiting at least 3 times a year, but the thought of being in an airport, standing in a security line, sitting on a plane with people who are pulling their masks every time the flight attendant turns around‚Ä¶.uh, no thanks."
13219,Guttermuppet.
13220,Right.
13221,"Again, you‚Äôre contradicting what Pfizer said, which was repeated just about everywhere."
13222,Pfizer said consistent across age demographics.
13223,"Not, consistent until 85 years old, or 80, or 75."
13224,"All that aside, we‚Äôre seeing breakthrough cases at *way* higher rates than what Pfizer originally said anyway."
13225,chicken $h!+ surrender
13226,Can confirm.
13227,I'm on the Novavax trial and we fill out a daily diary where we monitor our temperatures and monitor symptoms.
13228,"If we have symptoms for more than 2/3 days, we are supposed to collect samples and they come pick up the samples after 3 days."
13229,"There are no random tests, we were only tested during a couple of the visits around the time we got the shots."
13230,I had three vaccinated friends all catch mild cases from the same event.

13267,"This is true, and I‚Äôve seen it speculated the the summer spikes are related to people particularly in the south and west spending more time inside in air conditioning in the peak summer heat."
13268,Part of the reason for seasonality in any disease is that people tend to spend more time indoors.

13283,"There is a large swath of people who didn't get the vaccination, but aren't ""antivax,"" and grouping everyone together under that umbrella pushes those people further from getting vaccinated."
13284,&gt;Yong: I‚Äôve never thought of it that way.
13285,We‚Äôre used to thinking of anti-vaxxers as sowing distrust about vaccines.

13290,Here in the north of the UK we had some of the early Delta cases and it spreads crazy fast.
13291,Despite high vaccine levels it spread.
13292,But the majority admitted to hospital are under 40 and unvaccinated.
13293,"Deaths have risen but not nearly as much as previous spikes, again mostly believed to be down to vaccination levels."

13298,"Show them what a hospital bill looks like, that‚Äôll scare them straight."
13299,I wish people would care about what was actually said and the context things were said in with all sides of politics.
13300,"Lots of things could work, but most of them would be challenged in court."
13301,"The one that comes to mind is jacking up the cost of health insurance for those who refuse to get vaccinated;  If not getting vaccinated costs someone $100 or so a month, that will cause an immediate uptick in vaccination."

13325,This is an amazing statistic that I read about a few days ago as well.

13338,"Covid notwithstanding, not getting sick over the past year+ has been amazing, and having bronchitis and a subsequent sinus infection is shit that I do not care to repeat any time soon."
13339,Then are you disagreeing with their interpretation of the data?
13340,"If you believe the data, then I think it should be pretty immediately believable to say, retroactively, that the vaccinated people were ~7% as likely to die as the unvaccinated people."
13341,Of course there can be reasons for that-- maybe people who are more likely to die are also more likely to get vaccinated.
13342,Maybe vaccinated people had a party where they went around kicking door knobs.
13343,"To some degree though, its not possible to control all of those factors."
13344,"The data that we record, like that in this article, will be our truth for how effective the vaccine is."
13345,"Controlling for age is simple enough,  and other groups like the PHE do this, but we will probably never be able to parse out how people's risk appetite influences their likelihood to get vaccinated, and how people's vaccination status influences their risk appetite."
13346,"I think its fine to say that in this data set, the vaccine appeared 93% effective at preventing death, as long as you also are looking at the other data sets where it appears 99% effective."
13347,That variance is a part of the actual world will play out.
13348,"Yes, the vaccines were developed, trialed, and authorized on the basis of their ability to prevent symptomatic disease, not infections."
13349,"(It was more like 93-95% in the original trials, not 97%, just for clarity)."

13351,He once got a visit from the Secret Service after posting a video claiming he would be happy to execute President Obama personally after he was found guilty of treason in a court of law (for not being an American).
13352,"He certainly does believe that taking the vaccine is much more risky than catching Covid-19 would be (and I believe he's not far off 60 years old), but much of the resistance must come from his complete contempt of anything that the government tells him he should do, which is why no tests and no masks either."

LITTLE ROCK, Ark."
13527,"‚Äî According to the Arkansas Department of Health, there have been two total pediatric COVID-19 deaths in Arkansas."
13528,"The first was reported to ADH at the end of last year, but took some time for officials to confirm."
13529,"""The only details we can release are that the deaths occurred in children under 18 years old,‚Äù the ADH spokesperson said."
13530,Arkansas's cases have surged in recent weeks because of the delta variant of the virus and a low number of people getting vaccinated.
13531,"On Wednesday, July 22, the department of health reported 13 new deaths, putting Arkansas's total death count at 6,020."
13532,"Arkansas's vaccination rate remains one of the lowest in the country, with a little over 35% of the state being reported as fully vaccinated."
13533,"Per the CDC, kids aren't really at risk from COVID and in regards to long COVID [there's very little evidence of persistent symptoms in children](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782164)."
13534,it's part that and part Fox News getting sued for violating the Consumer Protection Act by advocating for no vaccines.
13535,"These politicians are skating on the thin ice artificially made by Fox News (other, newer outlets aren't that popular yet)."
13536,"I would love to know more of what's causing the shift, but I'm sure the suit is a factor."
13537,It is inconvenient because morons refusing to get vaccinated - not because I am vaccinated and will no longer wear a mask.
13538,Sorry that is too hard for you to understand.
13539,"^

When you're more worried about the optics of a hypothetical future scenario than the actual emergency at hand."
13540,This isn't a guess or a theory.
13541,We KNOW incentives work.
13542,"So,  what's your priority?"
13543,"Punishing people for being antivaxx,  or helping as many people as possible get vaccinated?"
13544,Feels or reals?
13545,Here we go again!
13546,Here we go again.
13547,FFS.
13548,The breakthrough infections are more noteable with the covid vac.
13549,"Also, a lot of people think they have a cold when they have the flu."
13550,There's a lot of overlapping symptoms.
13551,"I know the flu can be much worse than a cold obviously, but if you don't have that bad of an infection you might just think you have a cold."
13552,"The mutations are in the spike protein itself, which is why the vaccine is slightly less effective (it provides protection against the vast majority of the spike protein, minus the part that has mutated, compared to all of the spike protein in the original strain)."
13553,Way more than no masks?
13554,"For real I did everything they asked me to do, I set up a bubble of only 5 people, canceled Thanksgiving with the family and when cases got out of control we ordered groceries for pick up."
13555,I even had a bandana to cover my face on hikes.
13556,Let me live a little!
13557,"Wow, that‚Äôs far more people infected after vaccination than in the US."
13558,Aren‚Äôt they using the same vaxx as the US?
13559,"Not afraid, just not doing it."
13560,"If you wanna, go ahead."
13561,"But I'm vaccinated, I'm young and in perfect health, so anyone that tells me to mask up can piss off."

13563,"&gt;  haven‚Äôt been sick in a year and a half, with the exception of having COVID

I'd say...that's a pretty big exception."
13564,Exactly.
13565,I'm in L.A. County where they just reinstituted a mask mandate.
13566,One of my still-at-home kids works the register at a bakery/cafe.
13567,"Her grandmother, my mother, is vaccinated but is 86 and has COPD and was hospitalized with pneumonia a couple of years ago that started as a simple cold."
13568,So my kid is still diligently masking up at work and never stopped.
13569,"We can't risk a breakthrough, and cases in L.A. are really surging."
13570,"Around 19% of L.A.'s cases last week were breakthroughs and other locales are reporting similar rates (Marin County, Lexington, KY and Boston)."
13571,I'm not sure what the messaging around this will be but they need to get on it fast before the propagandists start running away with it.
13572,1: I had the Moderna.
13573,1st shot nothing.
13574,2nd shot I got the chills for a day.
13575,I planned on taking working off for both shots.
13576,Didn‚Äôt need to take off on the first shot.
13577,But did on the second shot.
13578,2: took me 15 minutes from checking to getting the shot.
13579,I gave my nurse a $25 gift card.
13580,3: I faint at the eye doctor.
13581,Lol.
13582,So I know how you feel.
13583,Either close your eyes or if possible ask yourself doctor if you could get an anti anxiety prescription for getting your shot.
13584,I told my doctor and now I have a prescription for when I go to the eye doctor or dentist.
13585,I didn‚Äôt faint this last time at the eye doctor!
13586,"4: Although I‚Äôm still cautious and wear a mask at the grocery store, I am no longer worried about the virus wreaking havoc on my organs if I do get infected."
13587,His advisors aren't just looking at whole state data.
13588,They are looking at county data and historical election data.
13589,"If you look at those, it is clear the panhandle and other republican strongholds are lagging way behind in vaccinations regardless of age group."
13590,"For the record, I‚Äôm completely pro-vax and got vaccinated back in February."
13591,"I agree getting those shots into arms is important, but it feels like the horse has left the barn at this point."
13592,"Given how long it takes for full efficacy from the vaccines, this variant will have burned through huge swaths of the country before they would even be effective if someone rushed out and got one today."
13593,"This is going to be a huge public health catastrophe, and it lies squarely at the feet of the people that have been actively spreading all this disinformation."
13594,Sure.
13595,"I woke up and started getting ready for work and I had a dry cough, stuffy nose, and just generally felt ""sick."""
13596,I also had fatigue and just felt cold.
13597,"I didn't have a working thermometer at the time, but I'm guessing I probably had a fever."
13598,I drug myself to work and got through my shift.
13599,A couple days later I was at work and my sense of smell had totally disappeared.
13600,I had taken a COVID test the day before but I hadn't received the results yet.
13601,"On my lunch break, I went to a pharmacy and bought a rapid test."
13602,I tested positive on it and my job sent me home.
13603,"I never got really sick, but it was still pretty uncomfortable."
13604,I usually don't get sick either.
13605,I hadn't had any colds or flu in at least 5 years before this.
13606,Something that is strange is that I got a canker sore about two weeks before getting sick.
13607,I looked it up and supposedly when your immune system isn't too well you can get canker sores.
13608,I hadn't had a canker sore in at least a decade.
13609,"A couple days after taking the rapid test I got my lab results, which were positive."
13610,Currently working in a hospital and had a co-worker who was vaxed with pfizer get corona.
13611,He just came back after being out for 2 weeks.
13612,"We‚Äôve also been told out of the 20+ covid patients we have, 45% of them have been vaccinated prior to getting it."
13613,Do we have any number for Moderna?
13614,I ask because I‚Äôm one if the few people here that got moderna back in January while the majority of the population here got pfizer.
13615,70 and 88 percent in one day!
13616,What an error bar üòÇ
13617,&gt;You need to smarter than that.
13618,"You got vaccinated to protect you in case you caught COVID, and you can still very much catch it and pass it in to people."
13619,Here's data from [Alberta](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#vaccine-outcomes) stating the vaccines are 85% effective against symptomatic COVID and [Here's data published from the UK](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891) stating vaccines are 88% effective against symptomatic Delta.
13620,"Also, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oma9yf/vaccination_with_bnt162b2_reduces_transmission_of/) a study showing that the vaccines are around 80% effective at reducing transmission."
13621,"So not only are you substantially less likely to develop symptomatic covid (Asymptomatic COVID patients barely transmit and I can like the studies showing that as well), you are substantially less likely to spread COVID."
13622,"&gt;I get that you want the world to go back to normal, so do the rest of us."
13623,But we are still in this pandemic and it was the lifting of restrictions way too early that started this new surge.
13624,Utter nonsense.
13625,A highly transmissable variant that spread through the UK **before** they lifted restrictions is responsible for this surge.
13626,Not mentioning the fact that there's a more transmissable variant that effects vaccinated folks significantly less when discussing this surge is oversimplifying an incredibly complex issue to the point that its not worth talking about.
13627,&gt;Why would you lose it if somebody brought up immunocompromised or kids?
13628,What do you mean by this?
13629,Are you saying you don't care about those groups of people?
13630,"If they catch it and die, then that's fine by you?"
13631,As long as YOU got to act like the world is normal?
13632,What are you trying to say here?
13633,"Yes, I'm sure they're saying that they don't care if kids die üôÑ."
13634,Come on dude.
13635,"Kids, per the CDC and every other reputable scientific organization, aren't really at risk from COVID, and yes [even in regards to long covid, they aren't really effected](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782164)."
13636,Maybe you need to do a little more research?
13637,Vaccinated folks aren't responsible for any of the recent surge and its not our responsibility to fix it.
13638,"If you're fully vaccinated then you're unlikely to get COVID, and unlikely to spread it, as evidenced by the studies linked above."
13639,[deleted]
13640,That‚Äôs why the headline is important.
13641,"With THAT headline, I presumed the article would be anti vax which is incorrect."
13642,"Next time, everyone will wait for a payday before vaccination."
13643,I disagree.
13644,"These people don't even understand ""germs make you sick"" anymore."
13645,[deleted]
13646,I have read info from multiple state‚Äôs hospital systems and State Health Departments stating ICU admissions of children and children on ventilators is higher than it has ever been in any point in the pandemic.
13647,"I read this in a local FL paper and saw similar information from Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama."
13648,I don‚Äôt know if it is because of higher viral load or higher transmissibility of delta or both.
13649,I cannot find any study in the US of this rapidly emerging data and one article indicated most hospitalized children were at a vaccine eligible age - so 12 year olds not infants.
13650,But it does sound concerning and I am sure someone will compile all these articles and Health Department announcements somewhere.
13651,It doesn‚Äôt sound like a dramatic increase yet - but the highest it has been with probably the worst yet to hit with schools about to start and this variant taking off.
13652,"Not debating that, but to say we basically got rid of the flu solely to masks and not mass stay at home orders, cancelled events, and restricted travel is disingenuous."

13658,I‚Äôm in Orlando and I don‚Äôt see much that indicates support.
13659,Most people seemed supportive of Demings challenging his hands-off approach.
13660,It is really easy to spread misinformation when people can‚Äôt tangibly see the lie.
13661,"Once everyone in the red areas starts knowing more and more people hospitalized, disabled, and dead from this disease, the bigger the risk they start to wake up to the fact they were lied to about it."
13662,"It's likely exponentially more, similar to the amount of time it takes to debunk a lie."
13663,Good for him to power through.
13664,"It's true, I don't really understand, since I have no fear of needles."
13665,Maybe there is some anti-anxiety medication that can help?
13666,"Even taking some pot (I don't use pot, so not sure about that)."
13667,Yep.
13668,It's the hill of dung they built that they have to die on now.
13669,being vaccinated should not be the only countermeasure to this pandemic.
13670,We've been lied to.

13673,What do you think the vaccine does?

13675,It is not selfish to say that your health is your problem.
13676,Masks are annoying and i shouldn't have to wear them when i have gotten the vaccine.
13677,Wrong.

13688,&gt;if a person is processing the virus (I.e.
13689,infected) they are able to spread it.
13690,"If masks prevent the spread, especially of a strain that‚Äôs twice as transmissible, it makes sense."
13691,Correct.
13692,"However, vaccinated people transmit anywhere from 70%-95% less virus than non-infected people."
13693,And that's if they transmit at all.
13694,There's been studies done (as the Washington Post article points out) that show that COVID-positive vaccinated people don't actually have live virus to transmit inside them.
13695,"Also, remember, that obviously vaccinated people are much better protected should they be exposed."
13696,"So we are now in a situation where there's materially less transmission in a population where even should transmission happen, statistically you will not get sick."

13698,A whim?
13699,A possibility?

13704,I feel the same way.
13705,Glad we can agree on this.
13706,&gt;Something to consider is that Israel vaccinated its way to herd immunity and delta changed that in a big way.
13707,Ehhh not really.
13708,They're still barely getting any hospitalizations or deaths among their vaccinated population.
13709,Also what no one talks about is that a lot of Israel is insanely dense.
13710,Like Manhattan on steroids dense.
13711,I'm talking families of 6-8 people living in 2-3 bedroom apartments in apartment buildings.
13712,The concept of personal space does not exist in Israel.
13713,I have family there and have been there multiple times.
13714,I'm sure this cultural difference also adds to their increased transmission and case numbers.
13715,Probably new information they have gotten that they aren't releasing to the public just yet.
13716,Politicians love to act like they didn't know anything after some shit goes down.
13717,Was this a local pharmacy or big chain like CVS?

13810,Sad...
13811,Thank you.
13812,Honestly it wasn‚Äôt that bad I was just surprised by it.
13813,Crazy world out there.
13814,My Father-in-law is the same way.
13815,Nearly died from covid.
13816,Taken out of his house on a stretcher in the middle of the night.
13817,A week in the icu and 2 weeks in a rehab ward.
13818,Still anti covid vaccine.
13819,"These people need to be saddled with the extra, unnecessary costs of their own stupidity anyway."
13820,"Seems like they‚Äôd agree in principle with the free market, anti-socialism approach."
13821,I work in TV and have been trying to get a nightly show following the lives of people with covid for over a year.
13822,No one wants to produce it.
13823,They don't want to do a follow-drama.
13824,They don't want to do a special in a hospital.
13825,They don't even want to interview the families of people who died.
13826,"""No one wants to hear about covid"" is what all of the networks tell us."
13827,"I don't give a shit if they want to hear about it or not, they NEED to hear about it IMO."
13828,"If we had the sick and dying in everyone's living room each night, opinions would change rapidly."
13829,"Instead, it all happens behind closed doors, out of sight and out of mind."
13830,[removed]
13831,My other comment was removed but I applaud you for putting this hermit in his place.
13832,I love you
13833,"The reality is that most people in MA are vaccinated, that's not the case in Alabama so the chances of a young healthy person getting intubated are MUCH higher."
13834,"Vaccinated people in MA have done what they're supposed to do and most people there also wear masks as well; if you want to fearmonger, stick to the subreddits for the southern states."
13835,"Yeah, surprise, we vaccinated folk aren't exactly that willing to endure punishment for the poor choices of the unvaccinated."
13836,"When kids get a vaccine sure, but the most recent study I've seen says about 9% of kids infected have long term impairment to their health."
13837,I'm hoping that's only for symptomatic infections so overall it's a smaller percent.
13838,Even still that's a relatively high chance for problems.
13839,I don't think people realize the probably of most injuries and fatalities.
13840,So some will be considered too important to deserve protection from infection.
13841,The sweet irony...
13842,"""It wont happen to me"" is one hell of a drug here in the states."
13843,I may take flack for it but I believe they are about 90% placebo.
13844,It‚Äôs to make you and others feel safe and does little to nothing to curb actual spread and will do even far less with Delta.
13845,When mask mandates have come and gone there have been few changes in actual weekly case loads.
13846,It‚Äôs so you go about your business without interruption.
13847,"Shutting down and holding accountable publications that spread vaccine misinformation, ie Fox News, OAN, et al."
13848,The pandemic should be treated as war-time.
13849,People‚Äôs lives are at risk and those publications knowingly went against the CDC during a pandemic on no scientific basis.
13850,Then they will think the video is a deepfake designed to trick them

13860,My man is being sent to reeducation ‚Äúseminar‚Äù
13861,Yet another reason I'm glad I got vaccinated the moment I was eligible last spring.
13862,I'm really really fond of the lungs I grew myself and would hate to lose them.
13863,"Oh, I never stopped."
13864,Good thing since I live in Missouri
13865,"&gt;I just don‚Äôt understand why vaccinated people are worried then

Me neither."
13866,If you're vaccinated you're not going to get sick.
13867,"You can still ""get"" the virus and somewhat participate in spreading it, but much less so than unvaccinated people, and again you cannot get sick so why should you care."
13868,"Everyone has the opportunity to get vaccinated, it's not your burden of responsibility to protect other people that are too ignorant to get vaccinated."
13869,Interesting thanks!
13870,Take an upvote.
13871,I don‚Äôt know why people feel the need to downvote a simple inquiry.
13872,This is exactly what people are missing.
13873,Mild and moderate are clinical and can have symptoms lasting for months
13874,That's the south for ya.
13875,"Damn, I haven't opened this site since Feb."
13876,"I just checked my county and we're back to December numbers, which wasn't as bad as most places considering I'm in the bay area, but it's definitely not good."

13883,you're getting downvoted but this is the reality.
13884,Ochsner in NOLA is waiting until the FDA approval goes through.
13885,The guy in the video is a dick btw
13886,"By ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù do they mean young adults, or under twelve?"
13887,"I‚Äôm worried about the fact that the FDA is being very conservative about approving a vaccine for children under twelve, and school will be starting soon with no vaccine available for younger kids until mid-winter."
13888,I've been using both of these sites for the past year.
13889,Wish more people would see this.
13890,"But the majority of people who need to see it are those who won't understand it, won't believe it, or won't care."
13891,[removed]
13892,I was part of the lucky 12%.
13893,Yep and n95s are about a buck a piece now.
13894,I wish Oklahoma cared enough about us teachers to require masks.
13895,Our governor actually made it illegal to require them.
13896,"Someone in the sub put it really well‚Ä¶ a vaccine is like a raincoat, in a light drizzle you don‚Äôt get wet, but when it‚Äôs pouring you do."
13897,It comes down to how often a person wants to test their vaccine.
13898,Even mild/moderate cases have symptoms that last for *months*
13899,Good for Atlanta!
13900,The risk of a healthy child dying of COVID isn't high enough to get these people to give a damn.
13901,I keep seeing comments stating that catching Covid is fine if we're vaccinated because it will nearly always be a mild case.
13902,"This article discussing masks for the fully vaccinated addresses that point and many others, with links to existing evidence: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/fully-vaccinated-masking-delta/619532

""[M]ild illness still isn‚Äôt desirable illness, especially given the threat of long COVID, which reportedly can happen in vaccinated people, though researchers aren‚Äôt yet sure how widely."
13903,Masks slash the risks of all of these outcomes.
13904,"Breakthroughs are more common when the immune system faces a ton of inbound virus‚Äîwhen there‚Äôs an ongoing outbreak, or when the people around me aren‚Äôt immune."
13905,A mask reduces my exposure every time I wear one.
13906,"Some variants, including Delta, might be more transmissible, but they‚Äôre still thwarted by physical barriers such as cloth."""
13907,"deaths are median age of 77 and 96% have at least one underlying condition, with many more then 1. hypertension is the most common, followed by diabetes."
13908,i think its safe to assume these are generally unhealthy people.
13909,the vaccines makes sense for high risk people.
13910,however we do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine.
13911,seems silly to put young healthy people at risk for vaccine damages.
13912,"there is always the risk of long covid, that is a risk you have to weigh."
13913,"I mean that's how pandemics in the past ended, isn't it?"
13914,It's not like the Spanish flu kept growing endlessly.
13915,"I'm just saying lots of people, along with scientific papers, have taken an approach that without lockdowns the virus will grow until basically every nonvaccinated person gets sick."
13916,There was a prominent paper last year that modeled 95% of Europeans getting the virus without any restrictions
13917,Too little too late
13918,"Absolutely, get vaccinated."
13919,&gt; A ‚Äúmild‚Äù case absolutely does not mean sniffles.
13920,It just means you didn‚Äôt have to be hospitalized.
13921,"So, if you want, mask up."
13922,But that level of risk won't get me to mask up as I'm fully vaccinated and ready to move on with my life.
13923,I‚Äôm an intensive care doctor and medical director of an ICU.
13924,I worked the frontlines of this pandemic since it started.
13925,When new covid cases come to me I ask point blank about vaccination and reasons they aren‚Äôt getting it.
13926,So far everyone who I‚Äôve seen got their medical information from Facebook or television.
13927,"When I ask if they‚Äôve spoken to a doctor about the vaccine, they often get defensive."
13928,"As tragic as this pandemic has been, it is now nearly completely preventable."
13929,"After more than a year of this nonsense, PTSD and counseling for myself and many of my staff, I‚Äôm all out of empathy for these people."
13930,"I‚Äôll still do my best to treat everyone who comes to me, but I‚Äôve stopped losing sleep over the lives lost."
13931,"Well gosh, I guess it‚Äôs finally an issue when you realize your constituents could die from this."
13932,&gt;I don't have a problem with vaccine mandates after the vaccines have full FDA approval.
13933,1.
13934,"That's not legal
2."
13935,You don't know when that will be.
13936,Vaccines are still far more effective than masks so why aren't you already advocating mandatory vaccines instead of the less effective mandatory masks?
13937,"Trump actually had been urging people to take ""the Great American vaccines"" but nobody has been paying attention to him."
13938,First saw it a few months ago.
13939,"Big failure of the press: they were ready to amplify all manner of messages, but not this one."
13940,I think it's simply that he wasn't on twitter so they didn't see it.

13971,"Now, their efforts might be too little too late."
13972,Dumb is not right.
13973,It's like religion.
13974,They have been totally indoctrinated like from religion or military basic training.

13976,"More important is the 36% from single dose

13977,As it should be.
13978,What else is there to do?
13979,"So I‚Äôm curious, I personally had covid a few months ago."
13980,Should I still get vaccinated even if I had it?
13981,Or are my antibodies enough?
13982,"Not that I should be seeking medical advice on Reddit, but when my test was positive the doctor just said to quarantine for 14 days and that was that."
13983,"I can't speak for Trek, but I share the same sentiment."
13984,"It seems to me that rather than snidely telling people things like ""If you didn't get vaccinated, then you shouldn't be allowed to use the hospital,"" an open discourse that seeks to understand their view and overcome any misunderstandings would be more effective in raising vaccination rates."
13985,"Absolutely there are people for whom there is no hope, but the point of the article is that there are many whose minds might be changed if we weren't demonizing them and pushing them away."
13986,You seem to be underestimating just how dense and stubborn these people are.
13987,They‚Äôll never learn.
13988,"Masks primarily work by protecting others from the wearer, not the wearer from others, so they tend to be ineffective unless everyone is wearing them, hence mandates."
13989,But I‚Äôm guessing you already knew that.
13990,The only wake up call they will get is in the ICU and even then they'll still deny that its Covid.
13991,It's incredible to see that misinformation is so much more powerful than real information.
13992,I've looked for data for % of long covid post vaccination but can't find any.
13993,That and loss of sense of smell etc.
13994,Wear masks a bit longer.
13995,"Yes, even you."
13996,"No, it won't kill ya."
13997,"If we were in a more sensible situation, those who haven't gotten vaccinated would get their shots ASAP while observing all the pre-vaccine pandemic protocols (masks, social distancing, avoiding groups, etc)."
13998,"But if they weren't willing to do those things before, they won't now."
13999,It's very discouraging.
14000,That's not true.
14001,Our news was interviewing Covid patients at one of our hospitals and this dude straight up said he wouldn't get vaccinated because it's 'too risky' ....while on oxygen in a hospital bed.
14002,Just let the stupid ones die off.
14003,"‚ÄúTechnically true‚Äù‚Ä¶ even if vaccinated people are largely not affected by Delta, that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt take precautions."

14013,"In everything I've seen so far, yes."
14014,I think it‚Äôs moreso a known weakness that is repressed(i.e projection).
14015,"For example, an individual that has a history of being deceived or manipulated is more likely to doubt the intentions of others especially when it comes to being asked or required to make some kind of perceived concession."
14016,"Couple that doubt with the ego‚Äôs default desire to view itself as reliable and credible and suddenly, rather than maintaining a humility towards their judgement, they act as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù of reality."
14017,"Worst of all, their weakness is easily exploited by conmen since all you have to do is trigger that insecurity and then close the loop by affirming their distrust of others."
14018,It‚Äôs the whole Three Stooges gimmick of slapping the distracted guy and then pointing at the other dude when he looks shockingly at you.
14019,"Nail the look of concern on your face and somehow, they won‚Äôt question your direction and will lay into the dude who has no involvement at all."
14020,This was done purposefully.
14021,It‚Äôs years of dismantling funding for schools and paying so little that people can‚Äôt make ends meet.

14030,It's very good.
14031,I'm not arguing that at all.
14032,"People saying things like ""it prevents death"" or it's ""99.999% effective against death"" is misinformation."
14033,"Death is possible and at 5% the rate of unvaccinated would put us at 5% of 600,000 - so 30,000 people would have died."
14034,"A *much* better number, but certainly not zero."
14035,Up until about a week ago all of his statements about the vaccines were neutral to positive.
14036,Then he went and said weird stuff about kids getting vaccinated.
14037,I live in a very poorly educated region.
14038,I‚Äôve heard every excuse from government trackers to mind control.
14039,I‚Äôm guessing he hasn‚Äôt seen his medical bills yet.
14040,I completely disagree and think governments issuing lockdowns when health departments see an upcoming surge is required to prevent hospitals exceeding ICU capacity which is when deaths start to pile up and tough decisions need to rest on doctor's shoulders on who lives and who dies.
14041,"People will eventually make the decision, but generally well past the point that they should have which causes a ton of unnecessary deaths."
14042,Yep!
14043,70% is in Israel where they vaccinated with Pfizer in Dec/January.
14044,"UK Started using Pfizer in April so the antibodies are more ""fresh."""
14045,"As they wane, UK will see more infection starting in likely September/October."
14046,"Sorry to hear that, was hoping he had at least one doctor (or anyone else) he might listen to."
14047,"I hope he changes his mind soon, for both your sakes."
14048,Are you vaccinated?

14055,Lots of skiing.
14056,My friend has spent the past few weeks in Provincetown.
14057,A few of his housemates (all vaccinated) tested positive but he has tested negative repeatedly.
14058,"Yeah our numbers are 60k, but agian cuts all unvaccinated idiots, vaccinated account for a very small number as the efficacy for them are like a percentage point lower, so yeah your comment is nothing but fear mongering‚Ä¶"
14059,"No, the reason is slow bureaucratics: Germany follows the ECDC rating, which is determined each Thursday, based on the incidence within of the last two weeks."
14060,They change their rules accordingly the day after.
14061,We had to wait from Tuesday two weeks ago until today we had to wait for the obvious daily count to lead to Germany changing its rules.
14062,Apparently vaccination rates are going up a bit again.
14063,So maybe they are.
14064,Israel is studying the effects on real population.
14065,They're at stage IV trials which is studying it's effectiveness in real world population.
14066,All other data are studies.
14067,"(i think UK also released real world results,i am not sure.)"
14068,Results in Studies do well over the real world results coz the population they choose for the study can be manipulated.
14069,"In a study, They can select a bunch of educated responsible and healthy men and women for studies, but a population consists of wide range of people who may have comorbidities and are constantly exposed to infection due to their work."
14070,They're at higher risk and these are actually considered a better indicator of effectiveness than the controlled trials.
14071,Thank you for what you do and thank you for sharing this.
14072,I wish the people who refuse to vaccinate or wear a mask would waive the right to medical care when they catch it
14073,These are the same idiots who proclaimed that the virus was fake and now they wanna tell there community to get the shot.
14074,I'm not American so I'm not fully familiar with your insurance plans.
14075,Are there fancy plans where hospital stays are 100% covered?
14076,We need to remove COVID coverage from the people that refuse the vaccine.
14077,Then they can get a double dose of their own beliefs.
14078,COVID and a medical bill.

14083,I alone know 8 breakthrough symptomatic infections in the past 6 days.
14084,"It might be 88% in the UK because they gave the pfizer shots late, but the waning antibodies have trouble preventing infection against delta."
14085,An updated shot will be needed or we will see a bunch of (mild-moderate) infection in the fall/winter.

14236,"I understand, but that is still impressive."
14237,"I feel safe with that percentage myself, but my risk tolerance is going to be higher than others and I understand that."
14238,These vaccines are definitely  severely reducing the link between cases and deaths.
14239,"True, they are not as good as true PPE masks, though some are very close (kN95‚Äôs)."
14240,"That said, they do provide great protection."
14241,"If you and I are in a room, both masked, I benefit from my mask AND  yours, both preventing airborne virus from escaping into the air, and for lowering my risk of breathing in any that does get through."
14242,"In every circumstance we‚Äôve seen so far of groups of people, especially unvaccinated (like every kid under 12 in a school), gathering without masks usually leads to a fairly large scale outbreak among those attending."
14243,And each one of those infected will likely pass it on to more than one other person.
14244,The new delta variant has been studied and shown to produce over a thousand times higher viral load in infected people.
14245,"Simply put, you have and are shedding far more virus, making it far more likely you‚Äôll pass it on."
14246,"Additionally, this variant has changes in the spike protein that makes it easier to stick to cell receptors, allowing it to enter."

14250,What if we ship them a giant sack of espresso beans?
14251,Pretty much the only thing that would get people vaccinated at this point is if they're inconvenienced by their decision.
14252,"The ""I trust you to wear a mask if you're not vaccinated"" rule is a huge failure because we know people are both willing to lie, and willing to underestimate the damage the virus can cause to themselves and others."
14253,"I presume that vaccines were required to attend large-scale public events, we'd see a big uptick in vaccinations, but few people in the US are going to touch that because certain factions and the alt-health movement have somehow successfully convinced enough people that ""vaccine passports"" are a bad thing."
14254,"Hopefully when the vaccine achieves full approval, organizations will be less likely to balk at requiring proof of vaccination."
14255,"It's likely not going to, I think support might help more."
14256,"But if it helps, I""m all for it"
14257,I think the official suggestion is 6 weeks post infection.

14352,Some said their doctors convinced them because they were higher risk because of health conditions.
14353,Others got it because of their employers offering incentives (i.e.
14354,"get a whole extra day of PTO just to get the shot that takes 30 seconds, cash bonuses, etc)."
14355,"This is all those state lotteries, CT bars offered free drinks for proof, etc."
14356,Some people mentioned they got it because restrictions were lifted for vaccinated individuals.
14357,So businesses and the government requiring proof of vaccination for things like flying will encourage people to get it.
14358,"France just issued a mandate required proof of vaccination or negative covid test to enter public spaces, and two *million* appointments were made within 48 hours."

I can‚Äôt imagine how shit it must be to get covid and a huge bill along side it."
14402,It took me being approached by my cousin who is a nurse.
14403,Her mother is batting cancer.
14404,Her post-op floor is being converted back into a covid floor as we speak.
14405,I did it for my cousin.
14406,So that she can sooner than later be able to visit her sick mother again.
14407,And a half ass realization that Our healthcare and first responders shouldn‚Äôt be on the front lines of a (Dare I say) civil war.
14408,Are you seriously this angry over a piece of cloth?
14409,It‚Äôs an important distinction but also demonstrates how important it is to vaccinate.
14410,Could be the difference between showing minimal symptoms and hospitalization and death for many people.
14411,Hows he doing today otherwise?
14412,"The number I remember hearing is 1/10 get long COVID, which is very high."
14413,"My mother was close to going to the hospital, but didn't, and she has some symptoms over a year later."
14414,I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôll rethink that when he gets the bill.
14415,The shot‚Äôs free.
14416,I would recommend an oximeter.
14417,That way if someone is sick they can monitor their oxygen level - which if it is dropping you need to get to the hospital asap.
14418,They are cheap and will also be a nice thing to have around in the future post covid.
14419,They are when the uvaccinated people are their family members who can't get the vaccine.
14420,Yea the overall numbers didn't change but anyone looking for nursing home deaths would find the data to be inaccurate.
14421,And the numbers were changed by Cuomo's aids to show fewer deaths occurred in nursing homes and they had been changing the numbers for months.
14422,Why would there be a need to change the numbers from how they were first reported?
14423,"This is something that people often get wrong, they assume it's all republicans who refuse to get vaccinated but if you look at the states which are reporting demographics with vaccination data in most states the 65+ and white crowd have extremely high vaccination rates, like 85%+."
14424,"In the case of Florida: 

https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/florida

55-64 = 70%

65-74 = 88%

75-84 = 83% 

Considering some doctors are advising against vaccination for people with heart issues, cancer patients, and select diabetes patients those rates in those age groups are about as high as they'll ever get even with a federally mandated vaccination."
14425,Hispanics and blacks have a 33% and 21% vaccination respectively but if you didn't look into the data you would never know it.
14426,I sure as hell didn't until a friend asked me to volunteer to to increase the local vaccination rates since I'm fluent in Spanish.
14427,I must have knocked on at least 600 doors as of today but it's done very little they don't trust the vaccine and largely want no part of it.
14428,"A few have legitimate reasons such as worrying about their immigration status, not realizing it's 100% free, or issues with transportation and after being informed on things or being an offered a ride they're more than willing but that's such a tiny percentage."
14429,The issue is pretty much the same with the black population they don't trust it or are worried about the unknown long term side effects.
14430,"Most governments have always been shady and corrupt, that is inherent to any government ever."
14431,It's just more obvious now that they've given themselves even more power than before.
14432,"A lot of them may not care about logic, sympathy, empathy, and compassion‚Ä¶ but then again, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that outside of logic, the same is true for the pro vaccine people."
14433,"They‚Äôre not all out getting vaccines for altruistic purposes, they‚Äôre doing it to protect themselves."
14434,The societal benefits are just a side effect.
14435,Their attitude toward unvaccinated people proves this.
14436,Also‚Ä¶ A history with anti-vaccine people isn‚Äôt relevant.
14437,"Read the article, these aren‚Äôt necessarily your traditional anti-vaxxers."
14438,I think it‚Äôs important to draw a distinction between those and the ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù with regards to COVID.
14439,You can absolutely change the minds of an unvaccinated person.
14440,And no one is saying that hospital staff deserve to suffer so I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant.
14441,I agree that people shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for others‚Äô mistakes and in fact *that‚Äôs exactly my point*.
14442,"People aren‚Äôt always ignorant by choice, a lot of times ignorance is perpetuated by failed systemic issues."
14443,It‚Äôs why you see the poor and minority communities disproportionately affected.
14444,"It‚Äôs a county law, if I go 30 miles to the next few cities over they don‚Äôt require it."
14445,No ones gonna read your entire trash post tho.
14446,First few words are worthy of a downvote
14447,&gt;Your comment is utterly irrelevant.
14448,I don't think that he was trying to argue for lumping them together.
14449,I don't think that's allowed under the ACA act.
14450,And that's a good thing.
14451,"Sure, in this case, we wish it was, but for the vast majority of cases, the insurance companies would abuse it."
14452,"Oh, you are overweight?, then it must be your fault, no insurance for you."
14453,"Oh, you are into rollerblading?"
14454,"Your fault, no insurance for you."
14455,"When you start attributing blame to people for their health issues, you start down a dark, dark road."
14456,Then why would they cover costs for a person who smokes or does not wear a seatbelt when they get hurt?
14457,Not to mention school starts soon.
14458,I report back in person for fall prep in one and a half weeks (university level).
14459,My friends that are high school teachers report back second week of August for prep.
14460,School starts for students in less than a month for some.
14461,Going to be interesting.
14462,People that are vaccinated can still get Covid and spread the disease to vulnerable people.
14463,Vaccinated people are just better protected from serious illness.
14464,Cant fix stupid
14465,"My thing is, since under 12 can't be vaccinated, and not nearly enough 12-17 year olds have, there is probably going to be constant interruptions to so many kids learning because in most states, if you aren't wearing a mask, or vaccinated, and you are exposed, you have to qaurintine."
14466,"The one's that don't require those who are exposed to get tested, or in some cases, not have to qaurintine if they test positive, are just nuts IMO."
14467,This post appears to be about vaccines.

14471,"Yes you are certainly not invincible if you take a vaccine but 30,00 a year should be in line with the flu if I am not mistaken."
14472,"From 630,000 deaths to around 30,000 beats my expectations I had last year."
14473,I thought it was going to be 60 percent effective or so.
14474,[removed]
14475,"No, people expect vaccines to protect against death from diseases they are vaccinated against."
14476,"People really don‚Äôt like masking or precautions now, which I don‚Äôt really mind for people without kids or whose household is all vaxxed, it just irks me how often people are like ‚Äújust get the vaccine!‚Äù‚Ä¶ not all my family can."
14477,It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still masking and being careful.
14478,It‚Äôs nice of others do but I‚Äôd also happily take everyone being vaccinated over lots of mask usage.
14479,The unvaccinated by choice are idiots who are playing with more than their own lives.
14480,"We could have been in a place with so few cases and such high vaccine rates people with household members who can‚Äôt get a vaccine cold relax more - my hope was by now my wife and I would be vaccinated, most people would be (they are, where I live), and rates would be way down so I‚Äôd worry less for those who can‚Äôt vaccinate."
14481,&gt;Easier than say keeping people from congregating privately which is not possible.
14482,There was a fun study published recently showing how easy it was to tell who had birthday parties last year by tracking the timing of COVID cases amongst families.

14490,No psych issues beside depression from chronic long term pain... and I've always been a loner even when I was partnered.
14491,I loved the lock down/  shutdown!
14492,Quiet solitude!
14493,Not a soul out while I went for walks to the coffee shop in the mornings.
14494,Both roommates were essential so I had the house to myself and all the neighbors were holed up in the homes.
14495,Aaaah the peacefulness.
14496,Can't wait for covid-21!!!
14497,/s for the humor impaired.
14498,Bigly for some folk.
14499,Studies I've seen have shown that vaccines give you a more robust immune response than a normal infection.
14500,[deleted]
14501,I was against getting covid Vaxed.
14502,On Sunday my cousin who is a nurse reached out to me letting me know she knows where my husband and I stand (stood) but to reconsider.
14503,"Letting us know we are on the brink of a gawd awful wave and young, healthy people are dying."
14504,I then read a post here in Reddit from a medical professional giving their experience or what‚Äôs currently happening.
14505,And then reading a reply from a nurse that she had resigned in the wake of this next wave.
14506,I got my first round vax Tuesday.
14507,I did it so that my cousin hopefully gets to see a light at the end of a tunnel before all our first responders have break downs.
14508,It took someone I know and loved in the medical field to reach out to me directly.
14509,What do you want them to do?
14510,They can‚Äôt hold people down and force them to get the shot.
14511,What else is there to do?
14512,"The stock market started to turn with articles blaming covid in the air, so they about faced super hard to save something that has already begun to die (literally)."
14513,"The UK, Canada and Italy have all released real world data with a large and diverse sample."
14514,Their figures are way higher than those of Israel.
14515,Exactly.
14516,This is what's pissing me off as a parent.
14517,I wonder if people would change their minds about the vaccine if they were exposed to images of people on vents struggling to breath while alone in a room on monitors?
14518,Telling them they have choices.
14519,They can try to prevent the disease or they can try out a ventilator and hope to survive it.
14520,And risk becoming a long hauler and deal with long term organ damage.
14521,Honestly it breaks my heart seeing the children who are suffering through no fault of their own.
14522,"So was my sister, annoying as her Dr. wouldn't even test her initially because he said it was so rare he didn't want to waste her money."
14523,Gross.
14524,[removed]
14525,The mechanism for infection is still the same vaccinated or not.
14526,Masks reduce the number of infectious particles a person is either exposed to or expelled.
14527,The more masks the less infectious particles in the environment ... it's math.
14528,Less is better.
14529,I go back in person in one and a half weeks to teach at my university.
14530,"The moto there is ""covid is over"" because if Desantis and his legislative actions."
14531,"I cant ask students to wear masks, many are unvaccinated, etc."
14532,In one and a half weeks!
14533,I'm nervous because I'm scared I'll bring home something to my under two year old son.
14534,"My university, according to emails and meetings, is ""full steam ahead for a fall with 2019 normalcy""."
14535,Not much we can do because of the laws.
14536,"We can‚Äôt staff our unit, why would they put up tents?"
14537,Oh it's politicized here too.
14538,"Doug Ford in Ontario, and Alberta's leader have made sure of that."
14539,"It's definately based off what you follow online, or in the news."
14540,"If you're wary of the government,than that was kindling for this fire."
14541,"Canada, we don't have as much focus on our own politics, so maybe people are easier to inform?"
14542,Though there's a tutor down the road.
14543,I heard him talking today.
14544,"I'm don't know for sure, bit seemed like virus talk."
14545,"""There are those that believe in it, and then those like you and me that don't."""
14546,That's what I heard him say.
14547,Them and their neighbors have ignored the household only rules the entire pandemic.
14548,"The had a birthday party for their kids in the summer, that included kareoke."
14549,One mic.
14550,Mouths right on the mic.
14551,"I think the main factor in the US though, is that you guys cling to the word Freedom too much."
14552,"As soon as a sentence starts with  ""you have to"" or "" you're required to"" it seems like they feel personally attacked."
14553,Social stigma is good.
14554,Refuse to invite unvaccinated to family/friend group events.
14555,"&gt; We are trying to decide which one to get, which one will be safest

The Pfizer and Moderna are basically the same."
14556,They both deliver the vaccine antibodies using the same process (mRNA).
14557,"I got the Moderna, because it was the only one available."
14558,I would've gladly taken the Pfizer (or vice-versa).
14559,I went to the story looking to see age demographics of the hospitalized people.
14560,Left disappointed.
14561,"I believe stupidity should be punished, severely."
14562,"I don't know what they do to control variables, but I believe the PHE does this when they report their numbers."
14563,"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report

If there is a source somewhere that lists out hospitalization status and age group and vaccination status, you could do the calculation in the page you linked for each individual age group, and that would let you control for age at least."
14564,I think it's more that they haven't acknowledged it publicly.
14565,They have definitely taken Q influence.
14566,I have some other friends who I've stopped communicating with completely over the Q stuff.
14567,They've lost it completely.
14568,"Full blown into the conspiracy with the pedophiles running the government, Chinese troops over the Canadian border."
14569,"Before Covid hit , one of them almost had her kid taken away because she refused to vaccinate, the school couldn't allow her in and she couldn't afford to home school."
14570,It just seems like a really strange way to go about life.
14571,Unfortunately it's also claimed some relatives of mine.
14572,"While I'm not the most religious person out there, I thought it was good that they were starting to get involved with a church."
14573,It really helped them get a sense of community.
14574,Their kids were excelling with everything having friends.
14575,"But within the last two years, the Q influence is strong in their church and they've all gone down this rabbit hole."
14576,I certainly won't associate with them.
14577,Same with my 86 yo diabetic mother who lives with me.
14578,Going back to the office in September and I'm actually terrified.
14579,"Yes, we are vaccinated but what if a mild case of the delta varient virus isn't so mild for her?"
14580,Employer requires masks kept on at all times for the unvaxxed but all managers work remote so who's going to enforce that bullshit requirement?
14581,I got called dramatic here the other day.
14582,"At this point, what is more dramatic than death or long term permanent damage?"
14583,Let cities and states deal with it.
14584,... was over... delta is changing the dynamics.
14585,"The goalposts have moved, but it's not people moving them."
14586,It's inconvenient but the cold hard facts of viral spread don't take convenience into consideration
14587,It did.
14588,"Alberta Health posted what's likely the best real-world [study](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#vaccine-outcomes) to date, and it shows extremely high efficacy."
14589,I'm not sure why you're trying so hard to defend a highly questionable data set whose methodology still has not been disclosed.
14590,"Most conservatives are not against the vaccine or masking, they are just against forcing it or mandating it."
14591,It should be up to the individual.
14592,Yes but they also have a 99.995% survival rate...
14593,"Lady at my moms church denies covid is real, then her mother in law died from it and she said the hospital killed her."
14594,Now her sister is on oxygen and the church is on lock down lol
14595,"There's some great info [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859) from the Mayo Clinic, one of the top academic medical centers in the country."
14596,I think its really important to remember that across the world **2.45 billion people** have gotten the vaccine.
14597,"And only a handful of people have had serious side effects, thats extremely extremely good odds that you will be okay."
14598,Essentially a 0.00000002% chance.
14599,"Compare that to the chance that you'd COVID- much much higher especially with the Delta variant being so contagious (1,000 times more than the OG strand)."
14600,Funny you said that.
14601,I actually had to take him to get the MMR and DTAP vaccines behind her back years ago.
14602,Actually brought a smile to my face remembering her just going absolutely bat shit when she found out lol.
14603,"But yes, if the school mandates them, then I will take him, and just hope she doesn't find out."
14604,"Fortunately, few of my acquaintances have had a coronavirus."
14605,And even those who were sick suffered mild covid.
14606,My neighbors and I also chip in for [Disinfection Services](https://murawaymoving.com/our-services/disinfection-services/) of our residential property.
14607,You never know what can happen.
14608,Better safe than sorry.
14609,This is a fake quote
14610,Shit.
14611,I guess that you just have to focus on what you can do.
14612,Keep masked and limit unnecessary interactions as best you can.
14613,"Best of luck to you, sorry there this is all I‚Äôm able to say."
14614,I spoke to someone that I work with who traveled to Florida back in March.
14615,They were ridiculed for wearing a mask.
14616,We aren‚Äôt quite that bad up here in Michigan (yet) but our mask wearing population is really dropping off.
14617,&gt;&gt;you would hope the strong advice of the medical community would be more than enough.
14618,Bud.
14619,That‚Äôs the whole reason people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated.
14620,It isn‚Äôt enough.
14621,"Folks who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated yet and are able to aren‚Äôt doing so *because* they don‚Äôt trust medical professionals, and that is amplified by the propaganda they see online and on Fox News."
14622,Already have your sense of smell back?
14623,I'm afraid this is the answer.
14624,All the folks I know who aren't on-board with the vaccine fall back on the percentages.
14625,"*Oh, 99.8% (or whatever the fuck) will survive, so it's not that bad."
14626,I'm not getting a vaccine for something that isn't that deadly.
14627,"*

The worldometer site puts the US death total at 650k (ish), which is still less than a percentage of the population."
14628,People will rationalize and rationalize until that number is something like 10%.
14629,"Even then, who knows."
14630,Lockdowns affect people's lives too
14631,Does this mean it could be the Detroit Lions year?
14632,But outbreaks between vaccinated players will see the teams are compensated.
14633,That‚Äôs weird.
14634,I go to Cobb County Schools.
14635,We are going optional.
14636,We should be going masks but Karen‚Äôs are suing.
14637,At least I‚Äôm pretty sure thats why.
14638,"I hope his idiocy only kills him, if anyone."
14639,I‚Äôm not a legal scholar so I couldn‚Äôt tell you.
14640,All I know is I wouldn‚Äôt want to be sued over something I have absolutely no control over.
14641,[removed]
14642,You do not understand how free speech works.
14643,"Man, Aug 5 seems early to me."
14644,"When I look at them as just a number, I'm yeah, one less Trump voter."
14645,"When I stop to reflect on how they felt as they were about to be intubated, I feel compassion."
14646,"And when I think about the pain his family felt about losing their dad, I feel sad."
14647,"Narrator: ""It wasn't."""
14648,Same and 11 of my friends as well.
14649,All vaccinated.
14650,All COVID positive.
14651,Florida.
14652,Everyone totally fine with mild symptoms no issues whatsoever.
14653,Wait they aren‚Äôt all vaccinated yet?
14654,What the hell are they waiting for?
14655,Ouch.
14656,Let's hope for a school mandate I guess.
14657,Or is he also unvaxinated for measles and polio and all the other stuff already legally required?
14658,"Nah, cuz the truth was right there the whole time and they wouldn't listen"
14659,not wearing them and plan to spend accordingly based on business policies going forward.
14660,"I won't complain, make a scene, make any employee feel bad."
14661,I'll just walk away and move on to the next store.
14662,"I'm done, but I'm not gonna be a dick about it."
14663,"He supposedly took it as a preventative measure, which clearly didn‚Äôt work."
14664,Ask them about that too.
14665,But are these laws constitutional?
14666,In the week before any symptoms I was at an MLS match (took the metro rail there) and 3 days later at a concert.
14667,No one has been wearing a mask since the CDC gave it the ok and everything seems to be open at full capacity now.
14668,Thanks for the update - I'm sure soon you will be getting a call to come to the White House for your Presidential Medal of Freedom.
14669,Keep up the good work.
14670,This is incredibly racist and ignorant.
14671,The majority of people not getting vaccinated are minorities which the NFL is primarily dominated by.
14672,[removed]
14673,What??
14674,The guy literally said he's vaccinated and is realizing he can still get it.
14675,"I asked ""that's how vaccines work?"""
14676,Because I didn't realize you could get sick still after vaccination either.
14677,Only 60% of eligible voters voted in 2020.

14699,how many mrna vaccines have come before this one?
14700,There is no excuse for this anymore.

14704,It's my turn to be selfish and live my life.

14708,Who knows what their school year is going to be like.
14709,"Take a trip to the states and get your 2nd, they're plentiful here right now."
14710,NPR did a report on a study about immunocompromised people getting the shots for Covid and IIRC most of them showed basically zero antibody production from the vaccines.
14711,Pfizer is testing reduced doses for children.
14712,Hopefully they work very well.
14713,"ok, and what about ebola, let's try?"
14714,I'm glad they explained the logo.
14715,I had no idea that was supposed to be a man in jail.
14716,I think that's a fair point.
14717,"How about if someone drives a little to fast on occasion, or has driven when they are too tired?"
14718,That can be dangerous to others.
14719,Should they not get care because they made a bad decision that can harm others?
14720,I'm seeing a fundamental misunderstanding here with some folks.
14721,"A vaccine doesn't mean you don't get infected, in means you don't (usually) get _sick_ from the infection."
14722,"If you're infected, you're a carrier, and that means increasing the spread and putting others at risk."
14723,"You're a smaller risk because your count is low and you're not coughing on people, but you're still a vector."
14724,"Everyone's anxious for the pandemic to be over, but it won't be if we keep helping spread it along with the misinformation."
14725,"The only time I've ever had a fever that high was when I was a child, and I was hallucinating in a way similar to how this article describes: ""When I would close my eyes, rather than my vision darkening, I saw a strange world of vivid colors."
14726,"It felt as though I were dreaming, even though I was awake -- as though I were in the middle of a hallucination."""
14727,But instead of seeing colors I was moving/flying through scenes that had slow moving shapes in them that were slowly trying to crush me.
14728,"I was mostly lucid while experiencing this, so I could open my eyes and ground myself back into reality by focusing on something near me."
14729,"But I really had to my focus, else if I'd let myself relax I'd start getting sucked back into the hallucination."
14730,As you can imagine it was not fun fighting this on and off.
14731,That's definitely not something I ever want to experience again.
14732,"As an adult I once had a fever of maybe 102.5, and that had me feeling pretty dissociated from reality."
14733,"Like I was there, but viewing from it from a ""space"" I could only as describe as a few feet from behind eyes."
14734,"So yeah, I'm glad I got my shot!"
14735," I just happen to live in Maine, right in the middle of the hot zone."
14736,"Fortunately, I'm fully vaccinated."
14737,State the statistics of erectile dysfunction in younger men who contracted covid.
14738,That should be a huge talking point.
14739,"Eh, no."
14740,That makes me the opposite of anti vaxxers.
14741,I look at numbers and science.
14742,Anti vaxxers and you look at some random things you want to believe in.
14743,"The world is what it is, you can't will facts into something they are not."
14744,"The point is that, kids not going to school, not being able to do sports is a several magnitudes worse problem overall than the extremely few young kids that get very ill from COVID."
14745,Exactly!
14746,This really pisses me off that people who refuse to be vaccinated expect their insurance to cover the hospitalization costs.
14747,Or they expect taxpayers to cover it.
14748,How long until insurance companies say sure but your rates will be X% higher if you‚Äôre not vaccinated.
14749,"

An MD that I listen to said that GBS is commonly caused by the flu."
14750,"He said despite peoples fear of the flu shot and GBS, he would go as far as to say that the flu shot is an effective way to prevent GBS."
14751,No real need to be concerned at all.
14752,Covid is statistically less of a threat than the common flu to them.

14759,J&amp;J is not a traditional inactivated virus (like I believe novavax is?)
14760,"I got pfizer so no dog in the fight, just curious"
14761,That is an extremely small percentage of people though fortunately.
14762,I think antivaxers will call you an asshole but this is becoming a very common sentiment regarding people who refuse to get their shots.
14763,&gt; No one is telling you to wear a mask.
14764,I live in Southern California.
14765,LA mask mandate is back and I'm nervous about where I live following suit.

14775,Do you have a source?
14776,I mean you say that till you see a human being dying in front of you because they were fooled by misinformation.
14777,But it does affect them
14778,I agree that a vaccine is pretty much the easiest thing in the world.
14779,I'm so pumped to go back to Canada.
14780,So glad you guys aren't a bunch of fucking morons so I can take my (vaccinated) family to BC again in August.
14781,We'll pay for their care regardless.
14782,Health practicitioners are required to render emergent care.
14783,I'm not so sure about health care and insurance.
14784,We can refuse them access to public areas and situations though.
14785,This is a serious concern.
14786,We can‚Äôt afford to lose what little staff we have left.
14787,I understand you‚Äôre passionate about this but wanting to charge people with manslaughter over not getting vaccinated is a bit much.
14788,"The problem in Florida is there aren't many options, at least from what I see."
14789,"I have to out my son in daycare (we picked a private school that is strict but still), but I could bring it home because of the shit show that is sure to happen on campus."
14790,My friends who work high school who have kids same thing.
14791,Virtual school is gone also.
14792,"I called today and unless I have a medical issue that the university approves, I have to be in person."
14793,No exceptions.
14794,Its insanity.
14795,It did not diverge from the scientific community.
14796,The CDC waited for evidence to show that vaccinated people have a low likelihood of transmitting any virus - which is true.
14797,They then gave policy to say that vaccinated people do not have to wear masks in indoor places - following the above evidence.
14798,That is the CDC's job.
14799,The CDC's job is not to try to play psychology games with the public and think if they do this than a certain contingent of the population is going to use this as an excuse to not wear masks as unvaccinated individuals.
14800,Things are going step-by-step towards that direction.
14801,Vaccine mandates aren't new.
14802,Students are already required to be vaccinated before attending school or living on a college campus.
14803,Some employers require the flu vaccine (e.g.
14804,"healthcare facilities)

CDC approved of vaccine mandates on cruise ships."
14805,Colleges and universities are mandating that students on campus get vaccinated.
14806,"Music festivals are requiring proof of vaccination, so are late-night shows like Stephen Colbert."
14807,I think it's only a matter of time before we start seeing these mandates in other arenas.
14808,This has a different feeling than other vaccine mandates because of the politics and the rhetoric used.
14809,"But it's just the same as saying, ""all students must have the MMR vaccination"" because it makes everyone safer."
14810,"We're starting to see that in the Bay Area, CA."
14811,The counties are urging businesses to require vaccines for employees.
14812,Lots will happen this summer.
14813,"Of course every school has a process, but how effective is it?"
14814,I‚Äôm under the impression that bullying is an issue that schools really want to solve but can‚Äôt.
14815,"Zero tolerance, suspensions, etc aren‚Äôt effective, as bullying is still an issue."
14816,"I‚Äôm just saying that having all kids to wear masks isn‚Äôt a bad idea, and it would reduce bullying."
14817,"This isn‚Äôt like the glasses thing, as this is a politicized and highly charged issue."
14818,Glasses aren‚Äôt.
14819,"phew, that would make it worse."
14820,"As I said, I don't use marijuana, so I really don't know anything about it."
14821,I see.
14822,Thanks for additional info.
14823,Obviously more nuance to this.
14824,Do you have a better visualization?
14825,Matt Gaetz territory.

14830,"Even on an anecdotal level, Long COVID just doesn't seem to be happening with vaccinated people."
14831,Almost every person I've seen talking about their breakthrough infection almost always mentions recovering well with no long-term symptoms.
14832,All I know is that the Arkansas Stare Senator Trent Garner who sponsored a law banning mask mandates has said the death rate would have to be ~30% before he would support repealing the ban.
14833,"Source:

https://www.nwahomepage.com/knwa/potential-parent-led-lawsuit-would-challenge-state-ban-on-mask-mandates/

It‚Äôs too soon to know what the death rate will be with Delta."
14834,Ok but the headline is a little misleading and clearly intended to alarm.
14835,That and the virus being deadly can both be true at once.
14836,Yeah I think people are confusing his stance.
14837,[He has always supported people getting vaccines and Florida has done a fine job of making vaccinations available quickly to the most vulnerable and was one of the first states where all adults could get a vaccine.
14838,"](https://www.flgov.com/2021/01/09/governor-ron-desantis-provides-update-on-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-efforts/)

But he has also very much been against any govt actions that would ""push"" reluctant people to get vaccine by making restrictions that apply to unvaccinated people."
14839,And he's been very much opposed to masking and lockdown type stuff.
14840,"I personally don't consider that ""anti-vax""."
14841,"To me ""anti-vax"" would be telling people they shouldn't go get a vaccine because covid isn't dangerous, or saying that they should worry about taking vaccine because the vaccine is dangerous."
14842,Things are going opposite of what I expected.
14843,I thought after everyone is vaccinated things will start opening up.
14844,The wwe are getting public in the stadiums.
14845,Yet I check the airlines and things are even more strict than last year.
14846,I wanted to visit home after a long time.
14847,Last year you needed a per test.
14848,This year many countries are downright banned.
14849,Is it the fear of delta virus?
14850,The vaccines aren't effective against delta?
14851,They don't even have to say they were wrong (though they were).
14852,"They could say, you guys aren't following the rules and masking up if unvaccinated so now we all have to go back to masking."
14853,The [CEO of Newsmax issued an editorial stating what a great job Biden is doing and everyone should get vaccinated.
14854,](https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/1417545910037458953?s=21) One of their anchors was still spouting anti-vax stuff this week and they issued a statement that he does not represent the network.

14865,*abandoned masks for vaccinated with no way to track who was actually vaccinated
14866,That's... not how the Greek alphabet works.
14867,"That‚Äôs the point, you can go out and do things but just use the proper protection."
14868,Man: I want to become iron man.
14869,Monkey paw genie: Wish granted!
14870,Man: *wheeze* not like this...
14871,No.
14872,Anything under 95% is not very very good.
14873,Do you know if the Israelis published their study in a paper anywhere?
14874,I've been wanting to read it but google just returns tons of news articles
14875,"There's overlap in those groups (and you're overestimating vaccinated a little bit), and immunity from neither is totally perfect.."
14876,The math is either disappointing or hopeful - current immunity is not enough stop a wave of infections but we're getting there.
14877,And current vaccination levels already keep hospitalizations and deaths lower per infection.
14878,Yeah all fine and good until a variant comes out we don't have a vaccine for.
14879,We are thoroughly fucked.
14880,I swear it changes multiple times a day it‚Äôs effective it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs effective it‚Äôs not and we wonder why people get pissed
14881,Well look at weld county‚Ä¶ you may have pockets that are vaccinated like probably Boulder and ft Collins but it‚Äôs too spotty everywhere rural to be effective.
14882,The only thing I can think of is diminishing effects over time.
14883,They were pretty early getting everyone vaccinated
14884,[removed]
14885,"in malawi, everyone was vaccine hesitant, until they ran out of vaccines."
14886,the second shipment from the covax program has been delayed for months due to india hijacking the production.
14887,Biden just needs to announce that vaccine program may end in the fall or winter and people are going to spazz the fuck out and rush.
14888,I think one or two of the identifying proteins that the vaccine trained your immune system to quickly recognize and attack as foreign have been altered to a significant degree in the Delta strain.
14889,There are multiple spike proteins but Delta has significant mutations in a few.
14890,This is enough of a change to slightly slow your immune response since these proteins are no longer an exact match and allow the virus to gain a foothold.
14891,"Also, the mutations cause the virus to bind to target cells in your body with a much greater affinity."
14892,This is why it is much more transmissible than the alpha strain.
14893,Tighter binding means more cells turned into virus factories and a higher viral load inside of you.
14894,Just ended around a little over an hour ago but is still up in its entirety on the PBS NewsHour YouTube channel.

14916,We did a lot as a society to isolate kids despite their resilience.
14917,This to me gives a dangerous sense over confidence in kids resilience to this.
14918,"The data may look very different after they have spent a few months in Schoools, unvaccinated without masks, and more limited or no social distancing."
14919,"Those things help limit the viral load, minimizing the severity of the illness for many."
14920,Without those mitigation measures things may look different.
14921,Can you imagine that Phd student shitting their pants right now praying that China doesn't let WHO investigate further...
14922,Yes.

No it isn't."
14928,"The original vaccine testing was done against the original virus, it doesn't mean the efficacy declined to 88%."
14929,"vaxx up

it's gonna be a bad winter"
14930,The death part of covid didn't really concern me but hearing about long term damage is what has me still being cautious.

14944,How many?
14945,The article is just a bunch of vaccination rates for the general population
14946,Early data from Israel in the spring seemed to suggest that it cuts transmission by a huge amount but I don‚Äôt remember the details.

14967,Every year a booster based on last years variant.
14968,It‚Äôs probably lower than a symptomatic infection of the same variant.
14969,But it seems like the viral load with delta is enough where asymptomatic spread is not *de minimis* as assumed.

14971,What if you got the second shot after 9 weeks because Ontario Canada?
14972,"Yes, yes but at a percentage only you can still get it but your chance of hospitalization is decreased dramatically."
14973,Also there's not enough data I would say to determine what the % of effectiveness is with vaccine and delta unless someone knows

14994,"Maybe they continue to get better, maybe they don't, but there will be large numbers of people with some effects which linger for months, years or forever.... all because they got conned into not getting the vaccine."
14995,Israel has to be counting asymptomatic infections AND traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the system that‚Äôs been neutralized by the vaccine (but may still run a positive test).
14996,There‚Äôs no way they know something the everyone else doesn‚Äôt (especially with how hesitant they are to go into detail on how they got their results)
14997,Possibly we could scrutinise thesis: 'someone has released virus in China'.

15010,It does make a difference.
15011,"However, I do agree with you that cases probably spread to a small degree at the protests."
15012,It‚Äôs just that with all the other modes of spread of the United States the spread from protests probably appeared as a statistical drop in the bucket.

15058,The only reason the Pfizer trials were 3 weeks is because they were racing to get approval.

15152,"It's totally possible that someone could get tested as a contact of an infected person, test positive, and then attribute a scratchy throat, slight fatigue, or something like that to the infection."
15153,Whereas the clinical trials had very specific criteria about what standards had to be met to be classified as an infection (normally required multiple symptoms).
15154,"That said, these numbers are likely based on the same test-negative methodology as their numbers from April/May that showed 95% efficacy, so I'd be inclined to think they're somewhat accurate regarding what's happening in Israel."

15335,It's been debunked misinformation nonsense for over a year now (an April local gov't news conference from Minnesota I think is what set people off) -- and people will still cite that same source.
15336,Even though the individual who spoke has come out a million times since to say it's misinterpreted.
15337,"But yeah, in their mind, the death toll isn't any worse than the flu, it's just a ton of people who would've died otherwise are counted as Covid deaths."

15364,Free case of White Claw with vaccine shot.
15365,Has anyone tried that yet?
15366,Hi there!
15367,I also avoid less urgent needles because I‚Äôm also prone to passing out.
15368,Nearly fainted after my first jab so I spent the four weeks researching as much as I could about why it happens.
15369,"It‚Äôs called a vasovagal response, and we pass out because our blood pressure drops in that moment."
15370,"Most docs and nurses will tell you to ‚Äúbreathe and relax‚Äù to try and help, but that‚Äôs actually the opposite of helpful."
15371,"You‚Äôre better off knocking out some jumping jacks before a shot, then relaxing just your arm but keeping your legs and as much else tense in order to fight that drop in blood pressure."
15372,I tried some techniques the second time (no jumping jacks though lol) and had zeeeero issues for the first time in a long time.
15373,Hope this helps!
15374,Edit: The part I left unsaid: My ‚Äúfear‚Äù of needles was actually a fear of how my body reacts to needles.
15375,Having a feeling of control over how my body react has helped ease the anxiety of a shot considerably.
15376,"I can‚Äôt speak to your specific fear, but again I hope this helps a bit!"
15377,Exactly.
15378,"Even if the vaccines are less efficient now than they would have been if the delta variant never came to be, getting a vaccine is the best one can do to limit the severity of this pandemic."
15379,At the moment it seems that vaccinations of everyone above 12 years old (in Denmark) will be needed to possibly reach herd immunity.
15380,"That's not going to happen so herd immunity is out of the question, but if a society gets close to herd immunity, outbreaks will still be very limited in size and much easier to control as they grow much slower even if nothing is done to control them"
15381,I‚Äôm shocked

15413,"&gt;In addition, if a game is postponed and cannot be rescheduled, players from both teams will not receive their scheduled salary."
15414,The memo also states the team with the outbreak will be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by the opposing team.
15415,"Oh boy, it's on."
15416,This is really going to intensify the fractions between the players who do and don't want vaccines.

15540,I had no idea the vaccines were so easily available in the US.
15541,"Of course, we are Covid free here but with delta we all know it's a matter of time before we have another major outbreak and for us it's a question of what will come first, the virus or the vaccine?"
15542,They don‚Äôt want to be responsible if this ever reaches the courts.
15543,They see their election misinformation is already going to trial and that things they say have consequences.

15550,"His mother has been in a nursing home since before the pandemic, and they rightly require face masks and a negative test before visitors can enter the premises."
15551,He hasn't seen his mother in 17 months because he will not wear a mask and he will not get a Covid test.
15552,So another academic report that goes against Israel data... Really makes you wonder what's different over there...

15559,"Vaxxeds shouldn't have anything to fear being close to non-vaxxeds (only infectologicaly, I mean)."
15560,So it‚Äôs pretty much time to get vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt already it seems?
15561,Am I seeing this correctly in that the variant is causing more severe and deadlier cases in the unvaccinated?
15562,&gt; That's what winning looks like.
15563,I think this narrative is potentially dangerous.
15564,There's good evidence that some who have mild cases will still experience long-term effects on major organs (especially the heart).
15565,"It's great not to end up in the ER gasping for breath, but I don't think we want people getting Covid even if they are vaccinated."
15566,I certainly would prefer not to get it.

15568,Where are the free chicken tacos?
15569,"Well, that is definitely concerning."
15570,:|
15571,I don't personally know anyone who has not been fully vaccinated.
15572,Which is why I am unlikely to (knowingly) spend anytime with anyone who is not vaccinated.
15573,I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs very hard for them to keep up.
15574,"Thanks to MRNA technology, boosters can be created in just hours."
15575,I think the bigger issue is trying to figure out the need/demand for such boosters.
15576,Up until just a couple weeks ago boosters weren‚Äôt really a high priority with the Alpha variant.
15577,Now that Delta has taken over (the western world) and is evading vaccines to some degree I think we‚Äôll see Pfizer and moderna both bust out boosters really fast.
15578,It helps that the FDA is saying boosters won‚Äôt need to go through phase 3 trials again - just quick phase 1/2 trials similar to what flu shots deal with yearly.
15579,"I think we‚Äôll get boosters extremely fast -  if Pfizer and moderna both start working on one, they‚Äôll be competing with each other to get theirs to the market first."
15580,I‚Äôm going to bet Pfizer gets there first!
15581,What do y‚Äôall think?
15582,I am curious about the 43 who were vaccinated and died.
15583,"What were their ages, what vaccines they had and if they had any comorbidities?"
15584,Would still suck if you did everything to protect yourself but still got it and died.
15585,I don‚Äôt know what to do about my vaccination status.
15586,"I‚Äôm in Mexico where, around April-May, all teachers got the opportunity of being vaccinated with the one-dose CanSino vaccine (from China)."
15587,I was teaching at the time so I got it.
15588,"In August-September, vaccination will be available to my 18-30 age group and, due to the trend in my city, I think they‚Äôll use the AztraSeneca one."
15589,"I want to also take this vaccine due to the CanSino one being only 65% effective towards infection prevention with a decline to ~50% after six months (with wild type covid, to my knowledge there is no data about its effectiveness with variants) and the fact that Delta is starting to surge in my area."
15590,"Another issue I have is that I might be moving to the US in January-February 2022 to study there and neither CanSino nor AztraSeneca are under the FDA‚Äôs eua status, so I fear that I will need to take another vaccine after to enter there."
15591,What do you think is my best course of action?
15592,Should I wait and pass the AS one and see if I got another vaccine if I move?
15593,I honestly have no idea.
15594,"More evidence of the amazing efficacy of these vaccines, but by the time a significant number of Texans had been fully vaccinated, the second wave was pretty much over and since then community spread of the virus has been low."
15595,"So if Texas suffers a third wave of cases as large or even larger than the previous wave (see the UK if you don't think that can happen), that 43 death toll among the vaccinated is still going to grow significantly, likely several times over, at least."
15596,"I repeat, vaccinations are great, and provide excellent protection, but it's not perfect protection, and any large wave of cases is going to cause enough breakthrough infections to put significantly more vaccinated people in the ICU."
15597,"Of course, their numbers will continue to be dwarfed by the mass of unvaccinated people lying alongside them."
15598,Under 12s seem pretty bad at spreading it but over 12s appear to spread it just fine.
15599,So there is the reason to vaccinate 12 to 18 year olds.

15707,At my Gym especially nobody is wearing a mask.
15708,Whenever I go to the target or walmart nobody is wearing them either.
15709,At the hospital theres a small percentage who dont wear them either.

15718,What do you fear about the vaccine?
15719,My personal (optimistic) take is that there‚Äôll be several weeks of continued panic in the US until it‚Äôs evident that deaths and hospitalizations aren‚Äôt significantly increasing.
15720,"The current ‚Äúwave‚Äù will either reach a high plateau, or decrease as we reach a suitably high level of immunity."
15721,"We‚Äôll see another wave in November-January, following seasonal patterns, and there may be a booster given to vulnerable populations; but the panic won‚Äôt be there unless something weird happens."

15724,Would be nice but it‚Äôs just not that easy for everyone.
15725,Lol this is such a shit show
15726,I am not an anti vaxxer.
15727,I am not a democrat or a republican.
15728,I do not blindly believe anything that is presented to me without additional research using very specific search criteria.
15729,"If there were a Venn diagram with a tiny intersection point, that‚Äôs where I live."
15730,"I am not completely opposed to getting a vaccine, just not yet."
15731,Something smells rotten‚Ä¶
15732,Living in Florida we‚Äôre in a real shit situation.
15733,Thankfully my family of three is all fully vaccinated.
15734,"We saw the same thing happen‚Ä¶vaccinated can go without masks, everyone rips them off immediately."
15735,All things equal we would all still be wearing masks everywhere particularly with the delta variant running rampant.
15736,Problem is my daughter (16) has to go back to school this year (she was virtual all last year) and of course there will be no masks in schools.
15737,Brings me to the shit situation where I want my daughter who lives with anxiety to be as comfortable as possible when she goes back to school.
15738,"Not only has she been out a year, she‚Äôs not stupid and knows the current situation is a disaster so our options are to force her to be virtually the only one in her 1500 student school wearing a mask, go out now without masks with her to help her acclimate to begin without one (what we‚Äôre doing), or pull her out of her school completely to do virtual school that isn‚Äôt associated at all with any physical high school."
15739,The last one isn‚Äôt an option as her mental health has to be a priority.
15740,"So, here we are in a position as parents to have to do something that we know is picking the ~best~ of the shitty options."
15741,"All of that said, I can‚Äôt express how lucky I feel that she is old enough to be vaccinated."
15742,We have millions of kids too young to be vaccinated going back to school in the fall and all I see is those kids getting sick and carrying Covid home to their unvaccinated families.
15743,Don‚Äôt give a fuck about the adults who choose stupidity but I do care about the health care workers having to care for these morons and the limited hospital capacity for those who need non-Covid care.
15744,Fuuuuuuuuccck.
15745,Haven‚Äôt put on a mask since I got on my vaccine and many others in my city haven‚Äôt either.
15746,"Stores and bars are back to normal, not a mask in sight."
15747,So much for that ‚Äúforever masking‚Äù.
15748,"The U.S. land border will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least Aug. 21, according to a renewal order issued by the American government Wednesday."
15749,And the lack of vaccinations.
15750,People are going back to normal without a care in the world about Covid.
15751,"I think there will be more restrictions in some states, but not an actual lockdown."
15752,I would assume they would separate those categories
15753,The case fatality rate for the flu is around 0.1%.
15754,"If my calculations are correct :

5723 breakthrough cases x 7% = 402 hospitalized cases

402 X 0.8% = 3 deaths

3 cases out of 5723 is 0.05%."
15755,So the fatality rate for fully vaccinated people appears to be half of that of the flu.
15756,Assuming they did die from Covid and not something else.

15772,They're just too stupid to get it.
15773,Moderna is 72% effective against the delta variant after 1 dose.
15774,They do not have enough data for 2 doses but presumably it is higher than 72%.
15775,"Edit: Just to compare, Pfizer is 56% effective after 1 dose and 87% after 2 doses."
15776,"They think that Moderna is still highly effective after 2 doses, but the percent will be slightly lower against delta than the other variants."
15777,I follow the CDC‚Äôs guidelines.
15778,"As a fully vaccinated person, I‚Äôm not required to wear a mask in most circumstances, so I don‚Äôt."
15779,"In the circumstances that the CDC recommends still wearing a mask even when fully vaccinated, I still wear a mask."

15800,I‚Äôm masking up in stores and buses but not in restaurants.
15801,Also masking in my building since we had a recent case‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only directly meeting with vaccinated people although sharing air in with strangers a restaurant might make it a moot point.
15802,"I am avoiding all contact with the unvaccinated, those acquaintances have ended."
15803,"I did the whole thing for a year ‚Äî strict pod, only one contact outside my household and they didn‚Äôt have other contacts, no indoor dining, very limited outdoor dining, of course masking, no travel (duh), seeing friends outside in the cold parks sitting 10 ft apart‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm tired."

15824,You are right.
15825,I'm gonna cross my post.
15826,Thank god.
15827,Right now the reasoning around recommendations for the under 12 set are very confusing for people.
15828,On the one hand the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending kids mask-up in schools.
15829,"On the other hand, they've been saying since the start of the pandemic, even before the vaccines, that kids should be in schools because the risk to kids from COVID is less than the harm caused by them not being in school."
15830,The low COVID risk to kids under 12 is one of the reasons vaccine approval has been slow in that age group.
15831,Even with masks and NPIs last year (e.g.
15832,"masks, cohorts only attending two days per week, closing schools in the middle of the week for cleaning), schools still had outbreaks."
15833,I can't imagine that wouldn't get even worse if the Delta variant really is as more transmissible as claimed.
15834,Same here.
15835,I‚Äôm in a training class for a new job.
15836,Thankfully I should be working from home til mid next year in a few weeks.
15837,But 2 weeks ago this vaxxed dude starts coughing a lot.
15838,The cough got worse as days went on.
15839,I‚Äôve never heard anyone coughing like this in my life and this guy is 27.
15840,He‚Äôs still coughing a week later but not like that.
15841,And he‚Äôs vaxxed so he doesn‚Äôt wear a mask.
15842,Even during his weeks of coughing.
15843,Our teacher made him put one on one day when his coughing was out of hand.
15844,He hasn‚Äôt worn one any day before or since.
15845,Ever since he started coughing other people in the class have been coughing.
15846,Seems like someone new is coughing everyday.
15847,"A lady who sits in front of me today sneezed and said ‚Äúomg idk whats been happing but I have been sneezing and feeling off last few days.‚Äù  

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME."
15848,people are so goddamn selfish and stupid I am so angry.
15849,I never want to be around people I  don‚Äôt choose to be around again.
15850,"If this job doesn‚Äôt stay remote after the program ends next spring I‚Äôm quitting and looking for something else, despite the amazing benefits."
15851,I cannot be around strangers anymore.
15852,At least not for 40 hours a week.
15853,I‚Äôm freaking out I‚Äôm gonna catch covid now.
15854,I‚Äôve been double masking everyday this week and plan to continue.
15855,Cough boy was sitting near my desk the other day and I put gloves on and wiped the whole table down with like 40 Lysol wipes.
15856,I‚Äôm so tired y‚Äôall üòû
15857,Was it the wonderlic test?
15858,You should get your toddler a flu shot because the flu is a bigger threat to kids than covid
15859,I don't think we can guarantee that at all.
15860,"Certainly we don't know what future ""variants"" there will be."
15861,"But in the current Delta pandemic, we could easily bring things down to a high baseline (10k-100k daily cases) heading into fall, then see large case spikes just as we did last fall when the weather gets cooler."
15862,"Until really a large number of people are either vaccinated or have caught delta, it's not going to go down to baseline endemic levels."
15863,I honestly do not feel bad for these people at all.
15864,They drank the koolaid despite having every opportunity to decline and multiple people begging them to do so.
15865,Yeah I agree.
15866,It gets a little overblown around here.
15867,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget it can still send you to the hospital‚Äù There is no acceptable risk when it comes to Covid to some people.
15868,"The vaccines were it for me, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine."
15869,Delta is going to push us back another year.
15870,"And while we are focusing on that, the unvaccinated (including those without access to a vacxine) are going to be variant factories."
15871,Who knows what those other variants will be like...
15872,It's never going to be over.

15884,"&gt;At one memory care facility in the Grand Junction area, 16 fully vaccinated residents were infected and four died, according to a CDC slide provided to The Associated Press."
15885,"The residents who died were described as being in hospice care, with a median age of 93, indicating they were particularly frail."
15886,"&gt;The CDC has not released the findings of its investigation publicly, but said it plans to publish the results in an upcoming Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report."
15887,"The slide was shared with the AP by a person involved in internal deliberations, who requested anonymity because they did not have permission to release the data."
15888,"&gt;Of the 16 fully vaccinated residents infected at the memory care facility, CDC found that 13 developed symptoms, described as mild in most cases."

15912,No not going to
15913,The virus is literally going to mutate ad Infinitum.
15914,It‚Äôs never going to go away.
15915,We have to choice but to learn to live with it.
15916,The early Israeli numbers indicate that it's 40%ish chance of getting infected with the vaccine against delta.
15917,That includes asymptomatic cases.
15918,We're seeing more vaccinated cases with serious disease too.
15919,Much lower rates than unvaccinated but if you have any health risks then it's prudent to distance or mask inside.
15920,Thanks for the kind words.
15921,Hopefully soon this will be something we won't have to argue about and we can have lunch with whomever without vaccination being our first thought.
15922,"Wow, that's incredible."
15923,I can't even imagine how frustrating it must be that the vaccines are so easily accessible and yet so many are choosing not to get them.

15932,Just because Israel used Pfizer and I believe Pfizer and Moderna are more prevalent in the UK.
15933,I think all of us will be very happy if the vaccines are effective at reducing the number and severity of cases.
15934,"However, recent signs in the last few weeks seem at least worrying and worthy of a closer look."

15940,Also I don't want to get a cold or even a mild case of COVID.
15941,Wearing a mask has never bothered me so I figure why not keep wearing it til this damn pandemic is over.
15942,It's easy to mask up and makes me feel less worried about catching any virus.
15943,I got laid off because of the pandemic and I'm busy job hunting.
15944,I don't have time to get sick.
15945,"I've legit been saying this the entire time, but no one will listen to me!"

15961,This is a big one for me.
15962,I work with adults living in RCFs and I have been wearing masks anytime I've left home since January 2020.
15963,"Recently (despite the beginning of the surge in cases in my area--Springfield, MO) I had staff telling me ""You *do realize* you don't have to wear masks in here anymore, right?"""
15964,I asked her if she realized how many facilities I work with and how easily I could be a carrier between the care facilities.
15965,"She just shrugged it off... What's even worse is that 90% of the RCF staff are unvaccinated around Springfield, Ozark, Nixa, and Branson."

16005,The only whiny baby is you.
16006,99% of people in the hospital for Covid are unvaccinated.
16007,99%!

16024,It's all a game of probabilities like anything else in life.
16025,"Where in one maskless interaction with someone who is infected, your chances of catching the virus might be (as an example) 80%."
16026,"If you wear a mask, it might drop to 50%."
16027,"If both of you wear a mask, it might drop to 25%."

16043,No deaths since February.

16188,The problem here is that you need at least a  month to get fully vaccinated - meaning you'll be vulnerable to Delta for a while just as it's gotten bad enough that you've changed your mind.
16189,Kinda odd that the gop and conservative media is now saying get vaxxed
16190,I'm Canadian too.
16191,(Ontario).
16192,So when I found out about this CDC change I was curious what the situation was like for us.
16193,They dont make it easy to find this stuff!
16194,"But you can find this .pdf on the PHO government site where it defines ""breakthough cases""."
16195,(Cases after being vaccinated).
16196,"https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/covid-19-epi-confirmed-cases-post-vaccination.pdf?la=en

&gt;In order to identify cases with a symptom onset date after receipt of vaccine (i.e."
16197,"post-vaccination cases), vaccine uptake data extracted from the Ontario Ministry of Health‚Äôs (MOH) COVaxON application was linked to case data extracted from the MOH‚Äôs Public Health Case and Contact Management Solution (CCM)."
16198,So that's how it starts.
16199,"But notice it says ""cases with a symptom onset date""?"
16200,"So what about cases with no symptoms - ""asymptomatic cases""?"
16201,A little further down it mentions asymptomatic cases.
16202,&gt; since the timing of infection (i.e.
16203,"date of infection, approximated by symptom onset date) relative to vaccination (i.e."
16204,"date of dose administration) is unclear for asymptomatic cases, it is possible that asymptomatic cases were infected prior to vaccination and may not be post-vaccination cases."
16205,"And then it defines what a ""breakthrough case"" is in fully vaccinated people."
16206,"&gt;Breakthrough (i.e., fully vaccinated) case: **Cases with a symptom onset date** that was 14 or more days following receipt of the second dose of a 2-dose series COVID-19 vaccine or 14 or more days following the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine

So it seems that asymptomatic cases are just not counted as ""cases"" after you have been vaccinated, in the way they are if you *havent* been vaccinated."
16207,All this changing criteria really makes it difficult to make any comparisons with the data!
16208,"Ok, that sounds promising."

16294,Perhaps they were referring to a single dose of AZ?
16295,&gt;PHE had previously said that a first dose of either vaccine was around 33% effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant.
16296,Any plausible explanation as to why there's a big gap between partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated in states like California?
16297,People just forgot to get their second dose?

16473,I‚Äôm on the Board of Education in a state that has been very aggressive with its COVID protocols.
16474,"The schools especially have been extremely tightly managed throughout the pandemic, with every precaution taken."
16475,"Interestingly, the Superintendent in our District and our regional Department of Health have already announced that they currently have no intention of requiring masks in schools this a September, even for unvaccinated persons."
16476,"Of course, anything can change, but given the current spike in cases in our state due to Delta, I was truly surprised by this."
16477,I was also surprised in the massive change in overall attitude in such a short time.
16478,"I think the simple fact is that whereas last year fear and overall caution drove decisions with respect to schools, this year decisions are driven by an overwhelming desire to ‚Äúget back to normal.‚Äù  I cannot tell you how stringent this state has been until very recently."
16479,[removed]
16480,Their problem.
16481,It's hard to feel sorry for people that get extremely sick but chose to not get vaccinated.
16482,Especially when other countries WISH they could get vaccinated as easily as we can here.
16483,I only feel bad for people that can't get it due to medical issues.
16484,"As I recently told a friend of mine, I was the first in our group to adapt to the covid threat and I‚Äôll be the last one to ‚Äúgo back to normal.‚Äù I never stopped wearing my mask indoors with strangers."

16489,Yes.
16490,"No vaccine in history has been that, no."
16491,"This is one of the most effective ever made, but not perfect."
16492,In the US the efficacy rate is well over 90%.
16493,It also does prevent spread by a similar amount.
16494,Any virus can mutate from any one individual.
16495,It's just an extremely unlikely possibility; that possibility goes up as more people are infected because the dice is being thrown more times.
16496,"If you are vaccinated, and you contract COVID and develop even mild symptoms, you are an extreme minority."
16497,"Your chances are higher of numerous other bad things, like severe flu, a car accident, etc."
16498,"It's the closest thing to ""protected"" possible that we have right now."
16499,"Though like I said, a mask can also help."
16500,How much so depends on the mask.
16501,It's up to you really - I personally stopped worrying about myself as soon as I was fully vaccinated.
16502,That'd be enough for me to pack my bags and go somewhere else.
16503,Im in Indiana and just got my first jab last week.
16504,"I‚Äôm currently pregnant and my OB recommended waiting until my 3rd trimester, which is why I waited to get mine."

16506,If this is the life I am going to live until we hit zero COVID then it's not a life I want to have.
16507,"Our university is planning to open for the fall, all students are required to be vaccinated."
16508,I hope leadership sees that forcing us to stay home to protect people who would never step foot on our campus is not the right way to do this.
16509,I think there is just more data on Pfizer and AZ.
16510,56% vs 60% is lagging behind?
16511,90% of eligible adults have had at least one shot in the UK and 2/3 have had both doses.
16512,They haven't been approved for minors yet but their adult population vaccination rates blow ours out of the water.
16513,The amount of ‚Äúcome on guys - what‚Äôs wrong with wearing masks and socially distancing forever‚Äù on here is driving me mad.
16514,Makes me think they‚Äôre trolls.
16515,The reality is we are already precariously close to autumn as it is.
16516,The wave of infections needs to happen now.
16517,"It's not an ideal plan, but the reality is it's the least bad option."
16518,Ultimately everyone will get COVID at some point in their life.
16519,"One dose is enough to ward off severe illness so, given we've offered a single dose to every adult, this is a good enough time to build up immunity through infection."
16520,I'm also going to have to celebrate my birthday alone again.
16521,But it's perfectly fine with me.
16522,Even though I don't like it at all.
16523,Physiology is mysterious.
16524,Could be the activation of your immune system led to some homeostatic changes that led to a chain of effects that altered your brain function somehow!
16525,I mean we still don't know what dreams are and how they work.... bodies are weird lol
16526,"8,000  three  straight days with today being 8,900 new cases."
16527,There‚Äôs a county in Florida that only has 20% fully vaccinated lol ( yea I know it‚Äôs small but still ).
16528,It took me about 6-8 hours to start feeling it after my second Moderna.
16529,It protects you from getting the virus but it doesn't completely protect you from getting the virus though.
16530,It's been true for all of them.
16531,"States that need it like Missouri and Florida won‚Äôt do it under any circumstances, while states that don‚Äôt currently need it like CA, Oregon, and the Northeast region are probably already considering it."
16532,I hate it here in Florida.we start school too in 2 weeks.
16533,Yay!
16534,/s
16535,"If you and your friends are fully vaccinated, you would be fine to have your party."
16536,I understand the hesitancy though.
16537,Probably easier to get then a fake ID
16538,i would rather put up with side effects from the vaccine than worry about complications from covid.
16539,"Nah fuck that parade, but how quickly we forget DJT's own statements (a couple weeks before the 6th and the Twitter ban, maybe?"
16540,"IIRC) basically saying ""[America] you can Thank Me for The Vaccines!!!1!"
16541,"Operation Warp Speed, blah blah blah."""
16542,"As much of a shitstain upon history as he is, I'll give some credit where it's due."
16543,"Broken clock, 2x/day and whatnot..."
16544,"I think they meant even the unvaccinated ditched their masks, despite the guidance only applying to fully vaccinated individuals."
16545,Does it?
16546,[removed]
16547,I never stopped
16548,[removed]
16549,"I can see the logic in planning it during a strategic part of the year, but going from 100 to 0 the way we did seemed foolhardy."
16550,Why let so much of the population get exposed at once?
16551,"Staggered reopening, while difficult, would have still given us the benefit of time to get more people vaccinated."
16552,"Yep, that is the ongoing myth..."
16553,Got it.
16554,We're on the same page then.
16555,this has nothing to do with racism.
16556,i was more than willing to cut my grandmother from my life if she didn‚Äôt listen to her doctor and get the vaccine.
16557,"she‚Äôs immune compromised, having survived colon cancer and has diabetes, plus she‚Äôs in her nineties now."
16558,she was very distrustful for the vaccine at first until we had to convince her to get it.
16559,[removed]
16560,England focused on first doses AND just opened up vaccinations to young people recently.
16561,We are much better than them on vaccinations.
16562,US isn't the whole world... the fourth wave will hit the poorest countries the most.
16563,"Got to stick it to the libs even if it means a million dead, ya know?"
16564,(tragic sarcasm too real)
16565,"You‚Äôre afraid of injecting ‚Äúforeign chemicals‚Äù in yourself in the form of a lifesaving vaccine, yet you‚Äôre totally cool with injecting foreign chemicals and steroids in yourself for the sake of vanity and powerlifting."
16566,"Lol, what a fucking joke you people are."
16567,Fully vaccinated Canuck here - you betcha.
16568,Some folks in my province are raising a stink about vaccinations and I can guarantee their social circles will shrink to an echo chamber.
16569,Extremely unlikely.
16570,Not worth losing sleep over.
16571,"As far as I understand it, there were 4122 cumulative breakthrough cases as of July 13."
16572,1300 new breakthrough cases between July 7 and July 13.
16573,7707 total new cases between July 7 and July 13.
16574,I am guessing that these people probably fit the profile of elderly/immunocompromised/ unhealthy people that also die of things like the flu.
16575,It can reduce your risk 20 fold but there is still some risk for the very infirm.
16576,"For younger people I would think that the risk of dying while vaccinated is so small, it approaches 0."
16577,"The whole world is currently ""backsliding."""
16578,The Delta variant is a whole new ballgame.
16579,Considering it‚Äôs endemic it never will.
16580,You say it like they were foolish to drop their masks and should have known better - but we have been told to listen to experts and the science.
16581,"We were told to not see family for holidays, wear masks and social distance by them before the vaccines - why fault people for listening to them when they say it‚Äôs safe?"

16588,"Ok well we are only a couple of weeks behind England, and they are spiking pretty severely."
16589,Hospitals are already filling up again and cities are going into the red zone.
16590,I know it's not college kids Forte to make responsible decisions but erring on the side of caution will not harm anything.
16591,"The only thing I could see masks affecting in the college experience is making out with randos, not your learning experience."
16592,I work in a industry where you are very social and depend a lot on relationships with people and a mask hasn't had any negative impacts unless some Qtips come in and start freaking out.
16593,"It's a piece of cloth on your mouth and nose, not a blindfold."
16594,It blows my mind that US cities aren't locking down with so many cases.
16595,"Here in Adelaide, Australia we had 1 (1!)"
16596,case and a couple days later the city went into 7 day lockdown.
16597,"Weeoowww
*Owen Wilson voice*"
16598,I'd say vaccine is about reducing a lot symptoms (or preventing any symptoms) and reducing contagion risk a lot.
16599,"Probably best if a health professional could chime in, I feel I'm spreading a shitty message."
16600,Basically : you can feel safe with the vaccine.
16601,But haven‚Äôt you guys heard they put a tracker in you and it makes you magnetized üòí.
16602,Just over the stupidity of people get vaccinated if you‚Äôre eligible.
16603,This new surge is all on those eligible that haven‚Äôt got the vaccine.
16604,You can walk into any grocery store and get it free.
16605,I did a quick update to my original post with what might be the research he's talking about.
16606,[removed]
16607,"I mean, is this not also largely a 4th of July spike?"
16608,"Numbers were a tad higher after June 15th but they didn‚Äôt really start shooting up until the week after the 4th, and the trend is pretty much universal across the us"
16609,Smh
16610,Absolutely!
16611,"I‚Äôm so glad that all of my inner circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è got the vaccine üíâ 

One of us came up positive but thankfully was fully vaccinated and his symptoms have been mild"
16612,We've lost.
16613,All of us redditors are losers.
16614,Our voices were not heard by Her Majesty the Queen or the President.
16615,The world's social media warnings were not heard by those who desire the games.
16616,The Olympics will be held.
16617,"They ignore the many deaths, tears around the world, and are laughing."
16618,The games are just a show for political stability for elections.
16619,"Political corruption, donations, status, favoritism of friends."
16620,We got Only $900 once so far.
16621,That's the price of life.
16622,People can not raise their voice.
16623,Why?
16624,We know demonstrations will be arrested.
16625,And the mainstream media's TV and Twitter has been hijacked by the government.
16626,The election system is already dead.
16627,Where is this country?
16628,Welcome to Japan.
16629,This reads like something you made up.
16630,At best it's just an anecdote but people hate cops on reddit so you'll get your karma!
16631,It seems to me like the science does back the claim that the vaccinated don't need to wear masks.
16632,Common sense on the other hand seems to say that there are a whole lot of people refusing to get the vaccine who wouldn't wear a face mask even though they were supposed to because they've been against face masks pretty much this entire time.
16633,So my vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% bullet proof shield against the virus?
16634,But it DOES help my body not catch it.
16635,So in theory it does help the spread stop and the mutations stay lower because my body is better at fighting it off in the first place?
16636,So it never even enters my body for me to spread?
16637,I just assumed he meant lower than before you got it.
16638,"But yeah, maybe it‚Äôs edited to appear that way."
16639,"&gt;If it is mostly unvaccinated at this point who cares, if they didn't get the vaccine that is their problem."
16640,You should care.
16641,[removed]
16642,I don‚Äôt think you are an idiot.
16643,Anxiety and fear are real things.
16644,I‚Äôm going to say you should be vaccinated of course but talk it over with your healthcare provider.
16645,"For me, I was surprised at how simple everything was with the vaccine."
16646,The setup is well organized so it isn‚Äôt confusing or difficult.
16647,Maybe someone can go with you?
16648,That might help.
16649,"I had mild side effects (sore arm and i fell asleep for 12 hours) but my sister was ill after the first shot for 24 hours, but fine the second shot."
16650,It‚Äôs just unpredictable so far.
16651,(My sister took Advil or Tylenol and drank fluids and slept for a day.
16652,She was fine about 24-36 hours after her vaccine.)
16653,With this more contagious variant like delta it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to avoid getting infected.
16654,"If you do get infected, you will have a better outcome if you are vaccinated."
16655,It‚Äôs being proactive to get the vaccine.
16656,Honestly it‚Äôs more understandable to me that people with anxiety would have issues around the vaccine than the people who still think it‚Äôs a hoax.
16657,[removed]
16658,"Measles has not been erradicated, but it has been made a non-issue in the US."
16659,It only flares up where anti-vaxers have created enough undervaxination that a travel case lands in an unprotected population where it can take hold.
16660,"That happens in certain areas of and around NYC with certain insular groups, and it's dangerously poised to happen in some rather affluent private schools where parents with no experience of debilitating contagious illness think that because they've  never personally seen it, state officials writing mandates are worrying about things lost to history."
16661,I never stopped wearing masks.
16662,L.A. Times is the best source for this.
16663,I usually keep another browser open for paywalls.
16664,I clear history.
16665,[removed]
16666,Also Canada allowing fully vaccinated Americans to visit also motivates people who want to visit.
16667,"You are absolutely correct, my giving the Israeli study more weight is simply because they are farther along in terms of vaccination and Delta exposure."
16668,The country with the best vaccination rollout I would imagine would present us with the upper bounds of the benefit from the vaccine.
16669,"I honestly hope it's a fluke, but they are coming out saying that if anything, they are overestimating the Pfizer protection against Delta due to sample bias."

16688,"He‚Äôs literally spoken out against vaccination, for fucks sake."

16690,The article says Pfizer is 88% effective against symptomatic disease.
16691,"That is very effective--much more effective than anyone thought any of the vaccines would be against even the wildtype, and more effective than other approved vaccines (e.g."
16692,J+J in the US) were found to be in their clinical trials.
16693,It's more he's refusing to play the venue unless they take the safety bars off the windows that keep people who lean on them in a crowd from accidentally falling out.

16696,"Also let's not forget that the variant is changed to be more infectious, not lethal."
16697,This is actually the next stage in wiping out viruses.
16698,When they mutate to be more infectious it's actually a sign that infection rates are going down which.
16699,I wouldn't be surprised if we get an omega variant that has much higher communicability but has a .001 percent of severe cases and the media will still say it's a pandemic.
16700,"Or he lied, much more likely"
16701,Lol
16702,They‚Äôve made it part of their personality.
16703,The one who I replied to was talking about symptomatic efficacy

16705,[removed]
16706,"I would not call going about your business doing everything you would normally do but with a mask on when indoors with others because you're not pretending the pandemic is over ""living in fear""."
16707,"Mask are the simplest, easiest, least invasive, most effective thing you can do."
16708,"Covid can absolutely still hospitalized you if you get a large enough dose of it, vaccine or not."
16709,"It can still cause you serious, long term complications, vaccine or not."
16710,And there is still a lot of it out there.
16711,"Nothing will ever make you truly safe, and that applies to pretty much everything in life."
16712,"We do our best to mitigate the risks, but somewhere you also need to make a risk assessment and decide if you are ""safe enough""."
16713,"But yeah, it is good to point out that you are not 100% protected as you say, as it is good to be aware of."
16714,yeah that's the one.
16715,This virus has made me realize 1.
16716,How fucking dumb a lot of the people in the US are.
16717,2.
16718,How much I can hate other people including some of my family members.
16719,There were so many times someone made a stupid remark about MuH fReEdOm and I just wanted to go off.
16720,"I've considered it, but it's not for me."
16721,At this point only a death in the immediate circle of friends will get the remaining people to vaccinate I think.
16722,It‚Äôs ironic that there‚Äôs a story about misinformation on the front page but people still buy into this woman‚Äôs ridiculous story.
16723,[removed]
16724,Quick question: Did you wear a mask your entire life during flu season?
16725,(Prior to covid)
16726,no
16727,One big difference is that the vaccine side effects respond very well to OTC treatment.
16728,Pfizer dose 2 was kicking my ass until I took some Tylenol and things got very better very quickly after that.
16729,"Yes, that‚Äôs why nurses and doctors in the covid ward get a vaccine and then walk around maskless."
16730,It‚Äôs magic.
16731,But the vaccine does in fact make you safe - that‚Äôs why you should get it
16732,Ya same vaccinated and I wore a mask up until after my 3rd week for my second dose no way in hell I‚Äôm going back no point it‚Äôs only the idiots that don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated in the hospital now so good luck to them
16733,"You have a study showing worse outcomes, not just  increased  transmissability  for kids?"
16734,Ah... not many.
16735,"Definitely going shopping, but not indoor concerts, nightclubs, sports venues, etc."
16736,"I only had my 2nd dose on Tuesday, so I'm still not fully vaccinated yet."
16737,"Case numbers are rising extremely quickly here in the UK, as Delta is 200% more transmissible that Alpha."
16738,I WFH so I only really go to the supermarket for food/drink.
16739,"I wanted to rent a room in London this summer (rates are low, as many moved back to Europe because of Brexit and the service industry has been losing so many workers), as I'm from there and in summer it's pretty delightful."
16740,"*If*  I do so (feeling a bit cautious, still), then I'll enjoy the art galleries, museums, and maybe concerts because I can go back to a house with other people who aren't frail."
16741,"Alternatively, I could stay a few days with my brother who's near London."
16742,"He and his wife have been working in public every day all the way through, and aren't poorly in the slightest."
16743,"Is there anyone you can stay with, for a few days after you might've been exposed?"
16744,"I guess it's too early to say you definitely won't give it to them, if you got a mild dose."
16745,"I've been reading of people getting a mild dose and not passing it on to their partners, but I think there might be a risk."
16746,"Frustrating, but it is what it is."

16751,Now his chances of surviving the next five years drops to 50%.
16752,Sounds like moderna.
16753,I had the same.
16754,It was rough but it only lasts 24 hours.
16755,Hope you feel better!
16756,Sadly that‚Äôs just not reality.
16757,"Before the virus was being produced in smaller quantities, and actions were being taken to protect the kids."
16758,"Now production of the virus is way up, it‚Äôs way more transmissible, and there are little protections in place for our kids."
16759,It‚Äôs bad.

16837,"It's very easy to look at a glance and go - ""oh look obviously New England is doing bad""

The actual cases per 100k is very important here (and I wish is was more easily accessible)."
16838,"Mass is technically up 101% and FL is only up 57% (i used 7/14 vs 7/21 so my numbers are slightly different than theirs)

HOWEVER

MA went from 2.4 per 100k to 4.8 per 100k in the last week (7 day daily average per 100k)

FL went from 24.1 per 100k to 37.7 per 100k in the last week."

16843,instead they keep on jamming their dicks right into the same bear trap over and over again expecting different results.
16844,Yeah that's not how calculating effectiveness works.

16853,??!!
16854,WTF ?
16855,"I may kill him myself so there‚Äôs that , jk !"
16856,But really am hearing this a lot from the 30-something group.
16857,"We, my family, are contemplating an ‚Äò intervention ‚Äò...."
16858,"&gt;All of the deaths were people over age 50, with 30 of them over age 80."
16859,"Thirteen of the deaths were people between the ages of 65 and 79, and six were between the ages of 50 and 64, Leusner said."
16860,"&gt;Of the 27 deaths of people with underlying conditions, 17 had cardiovascular disease, seven had diabetes and nine had cancer or other immunocompromised conditions, she said."
16861,"Five had chronic lung conditions, three had chronic kidney disease, one had chronic liver disease and five others are listed as ‚Äúother chronic diseases.‚Äù Some of the people who died had more than one underlying condition."
16862,.
16863,"&gt;‚ÄúThat means vaccines are about **99.999% effective** in preventing deaths due to COIVD-19.‚Äù

Bolding mine."
16864,[This UK study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891) shows that symptomatic efficacy for double dose Pfizer/BioNTech has decreased from 94% (Alpha) to 88% (Delta).
16865,"It is definitely a decrease, but it is still pretty damn high."
16866,"Remember a year ago, when we were hoping for a vaccine with at least 50% efficacy?"
16867,Looks like you were right according to CNN!

16878,Instead we have hospitalization data.
16879,Having more than  98% of patients being unvaccinated is already a pretty significant data.
16880,No
16881,My brother in law works at a hospital in New Orleans and he says most of the nurses there are refusing the vaccine
16882,What if message contained in mRNA is different?
16883,That would cause your body to produce slightly different spike proteins and that slight difference could cause difference in efficacy.
16884,That‚Äôs what I am trying to say.
16885,You shouldn‚Äôt assume anything.
16886,There are lots of variables.
16887,Everyone here apparently thinks there is one kind of mRNA on earth.

16890,"Yeah, vaccination is the only long term solution."
16891,[deleted]
16892,It's probably out of concern for people's medical privacy.
16893,A lot of vaccination centers are set up in a way so you can see other patients and the center doesn't want people photographing each other.
16894,You can call ahead and let them know you use your phone's text to speech function (or whatever you use) to accommodate a disability and they should be able to make sure you have that option.
16895,I guess I should have been.
16896,I was a little freaked out by the whole situation and really just wanted the police person to leave

16898,"The risk for kids is really miniscule, that is what all numbers say."

16906,"Maybe it's for patient privacy reasons, to ensure that people are not recording or taking photos with people getting vaccines?"
16907,...or that its not Covid they caught but the spike proteins from the vaccine shedders have given them Covid.
16908,At least its making some of the most crazy actually mask up in public.....to protect themselves from the 'vaccinated'.

16931,It's that family birthday party you attended at your cousin's house.
16932,Mask mandates didn't stop the massive case spike last December and January because the problem was people exchanging the virus over the Christmas dinner table.
16933,"In my own family, my uncle was scrupulously careful about masking in public, but ended up catching COVID because he went over to a friend's house for dinner and caught it from the friend."
16934,"Public mask mandates aren't that helpful unless they also come with a ban on visiting other people's homes, but that's not going to happen."

16939,I'm back to wearing a mask even though I'm vaccinated.
16940,Not worth the risk

17402,So it will take a lot of analysis to be absolutely certain that the vaccines will be safer for children than getting Covid.
17403,"If you read the article it says that all inmates are being offered the vaccine, they're just not taking it."
17404,I suspect the subset of people that get themselves incarcerated intersects quite heavily with the people who make bad life decisions.
17405,Including not getting the vaccine.
17406,The problem is that no one can just rationally explain a nuanced subject anymore.
17407,People don‚Äôt understand it.
17408,They understand extremes only.
17409,"They read this article and their brains hear this ‚Äî *Fauci demands everyone wear a mask in their own homes even if alone*

People don‚Äôt get that there are exceptions that don‚Äôt apply."
17410,Or that exceptions aren‚Äôt the rule.
17411,Our world is not black and white.
17412,We exist primarily in gray areas.
17413,Nothing is 100%.
17414,Every person with common sense understands this.
17415,Can you do that with mask on?
17416,Treat it like a masquerade party.
17417,Or a place where everyone is wearing racing helmet.
17418,This is why I still wear a mask.
17419,"This is why when the mask mandates ended, I said (and you can look at my history here to see this is true) that we should wait for children age 2-12 to be eligible, then wait 6 weeks and drop the mandates."
17420,"But that is an actual standard, and a standard I‚Äôve been consistent about."
17421,You are just making scattered arguments and changing your goalposts in response to any pushback.
17422,"In any case, the people who refuse to get vaccinated are a much, much bigger problem than the vaccinated people who don‚Äôt mask."
17423,It‚Äôs not even a close call.
17424,"And if we want to mandate something, it should be vaccines."
17425,"My alma mater is continuing masks and distancing indefinitely, while also requiring the vaccine."
17426,The university is not giving current students a reprieve on anything.
17427,"Get vaccinated, but also work on your weight and health generally."
17428,"While he and his family have my sympathies, this man was morbidly obese and could have dropped over from a heart attack at any minute."
17429,We have known for over a year now that there is a high correlation between obesity and bad covid outcomes.
17430,"We've been told--shamed, even--for over a year to stay home to save lives, particularly of the vulnerable."
17431,Less harshly pressed has been the need to get in shape and save lives.
17432,Some of us have lost a lot by having society shut down.
17433,That sacrifice needs to be reciprocated.
17434,"Covid has proven decisively that no, you can't be healthy at any size."
17435,"Take care of yourself, for everyone's sake."
17436,"Get vaccinated, but also give up the liquid calories, drop the snacks deep fried or wrapped in plastic and go for some fruit instead, and start moving around at least by going for a good walk."
17437,So that would mean a mere *0.00075%* of the severe breakthrough cases are in people under 65.
17438,Exactly.
17439,I gladly take the downvotes to spread this awareness.

17444,"Taiwan has received about 9 million doses to date of Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc¬†(AZN.L), including almost 6 million doses donated by Japan and the United States, enabling it to speed up its inoculation programme."
17445,"Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng told reporters that the new order for Moderna vaccines, which comes on top of 5 million already ordered, was signed on Wednesday."
17446,"""This number is slightly more than the 30 million doses we had originally expected,"" Lo said, though he declined to say when they might start arriving."
17447,"""We must strive for smooth delivery according to the scheduled time."""
17448,"Speaking later on Thursday, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said the order consisted of 1 million doses for delivery by the end of this year, 20 million for next year, and 15 million for the year after that."
17449,Moderna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
17450,More than 20% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one dose in the two-shot vaccine regimen.
17451,"A domestic outbreak of the coronavirus in Taiwan is now well under control after cases spiked in May, and the government is considering whether to lower the alert level."

17454,I go off of the total reporting so that's why the numbers I was looking at were different.
17455,"&gt;The argument is that, with vaccinations, you can choose to lessen your risk, and that a big chunk of potential illness-vectors are removed."

17464,I had to have a sit down with my mother in law yesterday.
17465,She watches my kids sometimes.
17466,She thinks covid is over and goes everywhere maskless.
17467,"It was a difficult conversation, she was not happy that I very kindly asked her to continue to wear a mask in public or my kids can not come over."
17468,"She pouted, screamed about her rights, I showed her articles like this one, she finally agreed to it."
17469,Later she called my husband to complain that our house is messy and my kids have too many toys and the living room is never neat so I'm damaging my children's lives.
17470,"Whatever lady, she can scream all she wants as long as she takes simple steps to protect my children or else she's not going to have access to them."
17471,&gt;That‚Äôs why their mask mandate is idiotic.
17472,I bet 90% of non-household transmission comes from restaurants and bars.

17478,"If a president has an initiative (like getting vaccination rates to 70 percent) in order to make his mark, and the CDC goes with it, all while sacrificing many lives (due to giving antivaxxers now having a free pass to not wear masks) ..."
17479,"Yes, you are sacrificing safety for political capital."

17504,"While I agree that masks for elementary and middle school are understandable due to the fact that students there lack access to vaccines, my concern is that individual governors and districts will gloss over this, and lump high schoolers together with the rest of primary education."

17565,"The worst real world numbers on vaccine protection are ~90%

17685,"For me it's now the pushback of the second point after the CDC mentions you don't have to wear a mask if you're vaccinated, in which, it states to follow local guidelines, which includes mask mandates."
17686,People are so stuck on point one that point two either doesn't compute or they think it's all show.
17687,I think it's too late to do anything useful.
17688,You need to work on your social discourse and media consumption as well as government structures until the next crisis... please
17689,"Well there is a difference between the hesitant, antivaxers, and voiced antivaxers that I think is quite important."
17690,The hesitant are easier to fix.
17691,The antivaxers are possible to fix.
17692,"But the vegans of vaccines, the loud antivaxers who won't shut up about it, are nearly impossible to fix."
17693,I'm sure all of us at some point in our lives have gotten into an argument and realised part way through that we were wrong but still stuck to our guns to save face.
17694,"Can you imagine the culpability of being wrong about something that could kill you, and spreading that misinformation potentially killing others that you care about?"
17695,That's the everyday reality of many antivaxers.
17696,Totally unwilling to entertain the possibility that they were wrong about something that matters.
17697,"As long as there is a shred of ""evidence"" that can let voiced antivaxers escape personal culpability for the danger they put people in, little can be done."

17700,Paying people $100 seems to be working where I live.
17701,Then I think you're exacerbating the point made in the article.
17702,"If PCR tests have a 9-30% false negative rate, think of how many people actually are positive for COVID yet are living completely normal lives."
17703,That 24 year old was also overweight and not particularly healthy.
17704,Wearing a mask in closed spaces?
17705,I really don't understand why wearing a mask is a problem for anyone.
17706,"I haven‚Äôt stopped wearing my mask, I don‚Äôt trust anyone."
17707,Sometimes stupid goes right to the bone.
17708,The most important thing I‚Äôve extrapolated is that vaccinated = less chance of getting infected and better odds of surviving than unvaccinated.
17709,But that‚Äôs ignoring the fact that mutations typically take the form of more infectious and less deadly due to evolutionary pressures to keep spreading and replicating without killing off their host.
17710,"That being said, I‚Äôm not an idiot and won‚Äôt say a virus has never ever mutated into a more deadly strain, because it‚Äôs definitely possible (and has happened in the past), just that it‚Äôs tougher, again due to the natural evolutionary pressure."
17711,"Testing is the most important piece, currently, to this puzzle."
17712,Continuing to make testing free and easily available is how you accurately monitor and track its spread and mutations.
17713,I classify losing sense of smell as a severe effect.
17714,"Either way, we don't make public health policy based out of exceptions like these."
17715,"Driving cars can result in death, but we don't ban cars, right?"
17716,mRNA vaccines are not the only kind of vaccines out there.
17717,"Large parts of the world used AZ, for example."
17718,"I am hopeful that mRNA vaccines will protect against further variants, but I would much rather not have to worry about that at all."
17719,"But that's up to the unvaccinated, unfortunately."
17720,"Just as an example, H1N1 caused far more serious outcomes in children than COVID."
17721,By a magnitude of 5x or so.
17722,Right now 18-39 year olds are hovering around 50% vax rate.
17723,The 65+ population is at 90%.
17724,It‚Äôs the 18-39 year olds that will need to move the needle.
17725,"It‚Äôs a weird dynamic as the boomers have done their part for once, it‚Äôs the Reddit population that has not"
17726,"This seems opposite to what I've read in the past, which suggested protection remained stable even after 6+ months."
17727,[removed]
17728,Still ain't fair.
17729,Also I'm pretty sure NJ and/or the NEA requires teachers to be vaccinated?
17730,Yup they have programed their base but good.
17731,A rule of thumb for a parent: the amount of time it takes to break a child's bad habit is directly proportional to the amount of time the bad behavior has been exhibited.
17732,"Not me, but last month my neighbor‚Äôs daughter (9) had mild symptoms and tested positive."
17733,"The parents and teenage brothers, all fully vaccinated never got sick or showed any symptoms."
17734,"They didn‚Äôt isolate their daughter to her room, so she was among the fully vaccinated family."
17735,[removed]
17736,"I think it really all starts with the ""individuality/freedom cult"" mentality that has taken over US culture."
17737,"They are highly invested in this notion, and think that they are really much more exceptional individuals than your average bear."
17738,"They knowingly take bullshit positions on this or other issues to express this idea that they love to nurture, while trying to convince themselves they are some sort of martyr for liberty."
17739,"So it is grandiose nonsense in the extreme, and clinically presents more or less as mental illness."
17740,"It‚Äôs funny to me I‚Äôve taken the flu shot every single year for 21 years straight, or so, and only once got flu and that was a year I got shot in sept and got flu in late April, so I am sure it just kind of wore off, not that it didn‚Äôt work."
17741,So I see these it‚Äôs only 50-55% effective but it‚Äôs always been 100 for me.
17742,And everyone in my family that gets the flu shot.
17743,I don‚Äôt know a single person in real life who‚Äôs gotten flu after being vaccinated for it.
17744,But these vaccines with the 70-90% it‚Äôs breakthrough left and right.
17745,It‚Äôs weird.
17746,To be clear I‚Äôm not saying anything negative about any of them it‚Äôs just wild to me the difference in contracting while vac between the two with much much different % protection.
17747,"There's a lot of interest in using mRNA for flu, too"
17748,A lot of people are quick to forget that they're just lucky and that luck eventually runs out.
17749,My manager pats himself on the back for they handled covid stating that we haven't had a lot of positive cases in the last year.
17750,Maybe that's because of the work being done to sanitize the building or maybe it's because we only require testing from people who admit that they're sick.
17751,"Was just about to post an article I found about Pfizer being 88% effective against Delta, when I saw this."
17752,They also have like 10% of the population of the United States (there‚Äôs less people in all of Canada than in the state of California) and 90%+ of that population is concentrated in the southern region of the country.
17753,Not quite the same.
17754,"That's like, the highest number I've seen out of Israel, lol."
17755,"You've got Israel claiming 60-70% in all of their data, UK saying 80-88% in all of theirs, most of the rest seem to signify lower 80s or something similar."
17756,Does he have a doctor he trusts that is willing to talk the risks over with him to help convince him to get the vaccine?
17757,Is it just me or is this mask thing only a big argument in the united states?
17758,Its either political or a fucking attack on freedom.
17759,"The government should be decisive about this, wear masks or not."
17760,"And people should should just stop being brats, its just a fucking mask.. just wear the damn thing."
17761,I'm fully vaccinated and I'm back to wearing a mask in public areas.
17762,That's a minor inconvenience.
17763,In two weeks I go back to work testing children in a public school setting.
17764,My glasses fog up and don't sit right on my face making protocols difficult to read.
17765,Phonological testing is out because both of our voices are muffled.
17766,Some of the tests require a lot of talking and I wind up quite breathless.
17767,"And since tests aren't normed with masks etc, the scores are suspect."
17768,But the state requires we meet all time lines.
17769,"I'll still do it and I 100% think it's the correct thing to do and a better option than Covid, but it's not correct to say it's a minor inconvenience."
17770,"So the research I was referring to was this: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891

A little more credible than cable news outlets I think and judging from the methods I don't think this one was in-vitro."
17771,"Because the mRNA vaccine attacks the spike protein, if the virus was to mutate to completely evade the vaccine it would either."
17772,"A) somehow mutate to become a different type of virus  

B) Mutate to evade the vaccine but now no longer be able to infect human cells."
17773,The efficacy from wild type covid to Delta only went from 95% to 88% which is really not all that significant.

17778,"Well, that's not fair for high-schoolers."
17779,I‚Äôm definitely going to wear a mask in crowded indoor spaces at the very least.
17780,I went out with some friends a couple weeks ago and immediately got super sick for over a week.
17781,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated but I‚Äôm not entirely convinced it wasn‚Äôt the Delta variant since my symptoms lined up exactly, but my doctor said they weren‚Äôt too concerned about testing me (still a little peeved about that, but whatever)."
17782,"I‚Äôm perfectly fine now so it didn‚Äôt linger, but either way I‚Äôm gonna start wearing the mask just in case."
17783,"I was initially in the camp of ‚ÄúI did my part, I got vaccinated, I really don‚Äôt want to wear it again.‚Äù But after being brutally sick for a week, and not being sure what it was, I‚Äôm ok with returning to some extra precautions."
17784,Well this is obviously **not medical advice** but I think WHO is concerned not enough data has been studied on mixing vaccines.
17785,People kept saying Pfizer and Moderna were identical because they were mRNA but there was another mRNA vaccine that had terrible efficacy (can't think of the name).
17786,I know countries like Canada have been mixing because of shortages but I don't think it's the ideal situation.
17787,Not sure why this is downvoted.
17788,Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
17789,The mask is not a cloth.
17790,"It‚Äôs an inhibitor to concerts, restaurants, bars, plays, and many other things that people live for."
17791,"If you‚Äôre unvaccinated by now and you don‚Äôt have any legit reason for not being vaccinated, you should live with the consequences."
17792,Right?!
17793,"How hard would it be to start the article with ""out of the 4931 deaths since December, 49 were unvaccinated"" there's no perspective in this article."

17797,Even mild cases can result in long COVID or the long term effects mentions above.
17798,People who have been vaccinated and infected have reported lose of smell.
17799,The vaccines are amazing.
17800,Everyone should get vaccinated if they can.
17801,Nope.
17802,Some capitalist and mega donor realize they were losing money because of shut downs.

https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/manatee-county/gov-desantis-praises-manatee-countys-vaccine-rollout/"
17812,Fyi while this was somewhat true for most people with the alpha varient the Delta varient has symptoms that are much more flu-like.
17813,"With the influx of people wanting mask mandates again regardless of vaccination status 
I‚Äôm curious if there is any data on how much more protection does masking give to vaccinated people?"
17814,I‚Äôm a staunch supporter of vaccinated people not wearing a mask and will remain that way unless something completely out of left happens but I am curious to know of any data that‚Äôs out there.
17815,Yeah...there is definitely something going behind the scenes that we know nothing about (right now).

17834,We‚Äôre used to thinking of anti-vaxxers as sowing distrust about vaccines.
17835,"But you‚Äôre arguing that they‚Äôve also successfully sown distrust about unvaccinated people, many of whom are now harder to reach because they‚Äôve been broadly demonized."
17836,Exactly.
17837,This is why I don't necessarily see the Biden administration fast-tracking full approval of a vaccine as a good thing.
17838,"The anti-vaxxers are going to spin this as ""being rushed"" and then that is going to turn off people who mistrust the government for reasons that have nothing to do with vaccines."
17839,"I've got to the point where I dislike the term ""vaccine hesitancy""."
17840,"One, it presumes that the main reason people don't get vaccines is because they are hesitant, rather than because of some other barrier."
17841,"Two, it presumes that people who are hesitant must be because they dislike vaccines, when in fact they may be hesitant people in general."
17842,Cringe.
17843,I honestly feel like this is the most likely answer.
17844,Republicans aren't getting vaccinated and as a result are 99+% of the deaths right now.

17888,I have to just link this aggregate article since some of the studies are PDF.
17889,"Study 1 shows Moderna produces more antibodies against Delta than it does against Beta, which  shouldn't be a surprise since literally every other vaccine has shown the same thing."
17890,Study 2 shows Moderna has 72% efficacy against Delta with ONE DOSE.
17891,"IIRC, Pfizer only had around 33% with one dose and AZ around 30%."
17892,"In every other comparison we've seen, Moderna typically slightly edges out Pfizer, but we have never seen a drastic drop in efficacy from Moderna compared to Pfizer."
17893,Assuming Moderna and Pfizer are the same Ballpark is not blind guesswork.
17894,It's making the assumption based on the two basically being the same exact vaccine.
17895,I provided my studies and proof.
17896,"Now, can you show me any single study that shows Moderna performing wildly different, or even worse at all, than Pfizer?"
17897,"""STUDY 2

A¬†lab study¬†on the Moderna vaccine showed that the vaccine was capable of providing protection against the delta variant and other variants tested, even though it was much more reduced compared with the alpha variant."
17898,"But the most interesting finding was that the vaccine was far more effective in producing antibodies against delta than it was against beta, according to the data, which has not yet been peer reviewed."
17899,"‚ÄúAs we seek to defeat the pandemic, it is imperative that we are proactive as the virus evolves."

17922,This is all a great experiment to test the efficacy of lockdowns.
17923,The vast majority of the US has no restrictions whatsoever and will not implement any.
17924,"If you believe lockdowns are the only way to stop COVID, then you would expect cases to rise until basically every single unvaccinated person gets COVID, right?"
17925,Especially given how contagious Delta is.
17926,"If this surge goes through the normal life cycle we've seen surges go through and subsides in a few weeks without even getting close to infecting every unvaccinated person, though, then that is a strong reason to accept the null hypothesis and conclude that lockdowns do not do much to alter surges at all"

17937,And once Pfizer and Moderna finish the vaccine for children he'll say that there's still 0.001% of people that can't get it because of a medical condition.

17939,Is feeling extremely disappointed because you're a fair-and-square vaccinated high-schooler who's being treated like an elementary or middle-schooler in terms of mask policy a good thing?
17940,Or does that put me in the same box as those mask bashers from before the vaccine?
17941,"And, in your hospital, where did the patients suspected but not confirmed go?"
17942,"Where I worked they went to regular units while awaiting test results, which was usually at least one shift (early on in the pandemic) and their caregivers weren‚Äôt even given N95‚Äôs."

17950,Because masks are honestly annoying and it would just be better if everyone got a vaccine instead.

17959,HIPAA regulates health data privacy in regard to specifically defined personally identifiable information.
17960,"Even then, it's just largely forcing business to follow policies that they define themselves, and must meet certain standards."

17962,"I mean in theory we don't need them, sure."
17963,We're much less at risk of catching and also likely much less at risk of spreading it.
17964,"But delta is so contagious and THE POOL OF UNVACCINATED PEOPLE SO BIG, that even a moderately contagious asymptomatic and vaccinated person can create a bad outbreak."

17970,The way I was gathering it was a 70 year old has the same chance of dying from covid as they do from mountain climbing and that a teenager driving 7500 miles was equal to dying from covid.
17971,In actuality it meant that their chances of dying from covid is the same chance as dying from driving 7500 miles which is extremely low.
17972,[removed]
17973,"Dude, easy on the üòÅ"
17974,I can agree with that.
17975,But vaccinations are so accessible at this point that I feel like everyone who wanted a vaccine got one and those who don't will NEVER get one.
17976,We're never going to change their mind.
17977,"All of those children go home to family, some of whom are unable to get the vaccine or who have been manipulated by the lies told by people like DeSantis."
17978,Honestly‚Ä¶ better educational systems and support networks period.
17979,"I know that‚Äôs not a quick fix, but the numbers pretty much show that it‚Äôs typically rural, low income, disproportionately minority areas that are the least vaccinated."
17980,"We all can name plenty of middle class or affluent people who are resisting it and should know better, but by and large it‚Äôs the people who have kind of slipped through the cracks of our society."
17981,This sounds like it totally could be challenged in court tho and easily won.
17982,If you play with shitty ideas long enough you‚Äôll end up with shit on your hands.
17983,They thought they could play around and get away with it but it‚Äôs pretty obvious that all the doubt they have sown will disproportionately impact their base.

17985,"&gt;The messaging keeps changing

The virus keeps changing."
17986,Advice given before Delta became a factor has to be updated or changed due to Delta.
17987,You mean the information anyone has been able to see for months?
17988,It's not really surprising that vaccination of the early adopters does not end a pandemic.

18004,I completely lost my sense of taste and smell (unrelated to congestion) but I've got about 80% of it back a week later.
18005,That seems to be a much shorter duration than people I know who caught it before vaccinations were available.
18006,So glad I was vaccinated before catching it.

18019,"I know Virginia posts those statistics for their state, but I couldn‚Äôt find the country as a whole."
18020,It‚Äôs been about a year in Miami.
18021,A lot of people don‚Äôt care and that‚Äôs on them.

18031,Why does this need to be explained?
18032,[removed]
18033,Seems like the pivotal point was about six weeks ago when people would have needed to start getting vaccinated in order to be protected in time for this wave.

18038,I actually started worrying about it quite badly during July / August of 2020 when they were publishing favorable results in the phase II studies.
18039,"I knew the vaccines were necessary, I knew I should (and would)  get one when available but I was stressing out hardcore about it for 7 months because I just do not want to deal with needles."
18040,[removed]
18041,"Well you brought up the most on point example of what I was inquiring, but mRNA is still within that same field imho - at least philosophically speaking."
18042,You are artificially instructing your body to produce a specific piece of a thing.
18043,"You don't even use a real virus with this tech, you just need a piece of information to enter your system and that's it."
18044,What happens if we instruct our bodies to produce other stuff?
18045,"Maybe more dangerous, maybe potentially toxic, stuff that might have a cascade effect that scientists weren't aware of when they first tried it."
18046,"Thing is, science is trial and error, it's like religion but with numbers."
18047,"You hope to get it right at first try, but if you don't then you try changing variables until you get what's likely to work for most people, but no one will be there to tell you that you won't end up resenting your present choices, especially when you engineer this kind of technology."
18048,"You're right that we can just hope that it won't end up in disaster and there's not much we can do about the whole, we can just take our decisions and influence the people we can influence to not go the evil route... but like you said, nothing is ever 100%."
18049,"And we need to keep being critical, always, otherwise we might end up resenting what we wished for."
18050,We don‚Äôt know the effects of Covid long term in children.
18051,Even one death is too many.
18052,No child should die of a potentially preventable virus.
18053,The kids need this vaccine.
18054,It‚Äôs true for most large insurers.
18055,Some insurers offer the waivers (maybe not as many as I thought).
18056,The majority of the rest are ACA compliant which still would limit out of pocket maximums to a reasonable amount (no higher than like 3-4k typically).
18057,5% of insurers are not ACA compliant so those people would have little coverage.
18058,"Also, out of pocket maximums and waivers don‚Äôt apply if you get treatment out of network."
18059,"So I guess Id change my answer above to say that the majority of people are covered up to a reasonable amount (and some completely), but it is possible for others to still fall through the cracks."
18060,Medicaid and medicare both operate differently too.
18061,"If the mask mandate is lifted in my school (which I'm not sure will happen anyway), I'm not wearing one out of my own volition."
18062,"I'm fully vaccinated, and [the vaccines are still effective against the Delta variant](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/564288-study-pfizer-vaccine-88-percent-effective-against-delta-variant); why should I?"
18063,&gt;The unvaccinated are going to continue to ignore both calls.
18064,"I know a lot of vaccinated people who are [rightly] going to ignore the call to mask up again, too."
18065,Lucky me
18066,Yet Americans have a free vaccine and won‚Äôt take it .
18067,I think the world has the right to hate us
18068,Side effects vary.
18069,"I think the weirdest part for me was knowing I'm not sick, but feeling sick if that makes sense."
18070,It was like a bad hangover.
18071,First shot I had soreness in my arm that went away in a day or so.
18072,"Second shot I woke up feeling sore, thought ""guess I'm good."""
18073,"About 18 hours after the shot, it hit me like a truck."
18074,"I started to feel like I was getting sick, then an hour later I was in bed shivering."
18075,"I rested for the day, and was up and moving around 8 hours later."
18076,"Now that most people who wanna be vaxxed are vaxxed, it shouldn't take long."
18077,"You get the shot, they hold you for 15 minutes, and you go off on your way."
18078,I don't like needles either.
18079,Look the other way and let the nurse do their thing.
18080,Number 1 perk is when I got my first allergy attack.
18081,A year ago I stressed over the smallest sneeze.
18082,"Post vax, I said ""crap, allergies are bad this season!"""
18083,Also seeing people and not worrying.
18084,I saw friends last year when numbers were very low and stressed for 16 days after.
18085,I wouldn't hug or go near my mom.
18086,I worked outside under a tent and ran an air purifier.
18087,I was driving myself nuts.
18088,Now I don't even think of it.
18089,"Truth be told, and not to sound dystopian, biggest perk is that I think it's going to be very very difficult to do and enjoy things‚Äîfrom a mental AND sanctions from private companies and different countries standpoint."

18092,paywall
18093,It's being looked at yeah.
18094,I'm just saying that people automatically shut something down as an impossibility when it's like ... no that's entirely possible.
18095,Women aren't necessarily making things up or being dramatic or whatever.
18096,Covid-19 has different effects for men than women.
18097,"Men, for example, end up with more severe cases and so on."
18098,"The difference between men and women is hormonal, however they both have an endocrine system of course so yeah it's an area of interest within the scientific community."
18099,"That being stated, these are anecdotal but being just write women's claims off for some reason whereas it's kinda like
... No that's possible?"
18100,Why wouldn't it be?
18101,"So my point wasn't that it's been proven, or wasn't anecdotal."
18102,My point was basically that the guy was using incorrect terms and thinking within a box that made his argument absolutely correct.
18103,But the lymph node issue that I had has been proven and a known side effect of vaccines for years.
18104,Plenty of mammograms came back with bad results as well.
18105,I wasn't the only person to have an unnecessary biopsy.
18106,"I'm not a scientist, so I can't be like yeah missed/early period is related to the vaccine,.but it's possible wtf."
18107,People shut that one down all the time.
18108,Alternative title: covid patient in Louisiana cant admit he was wrong.
18109,"I would argue there is not enough photos or videos, remember when everyone wanted to storm icus because they thought they were empty and people are out of their god damn minds?"
18110,We saw a lot of video out of nyc at first then I feel like it was radio silence.
18111,"We need videos and testimonials and PSAs , idk what else to do"
18112,Do you think Georgia should institute a second mask mandate?
18113,"Also, wouldn't it be easy for high schools to implement vaccine requirements, which is what most colleges are doing?"
18114,Probably monetization.
18115,Like actual money for shots.
18116,You get JJ?
18117,200 bucks.
18118,You get moderna or pfizer?
18119,100 per shot.
18120,Cash is always useful.
18121,"Bingo

There is a reason faux news is doing a 180 (besides fucker tarlson)

They are losing their base"
18122,You are correct I should have read it.
18123,When I clicked through to the article all I got was a white screen so I shouldn‚Äôt have assumed.
18124,That being said in my state there really was this whole uproar about not wasting shots on prisoners.
18125,Not in my state.
18126,"Their rates here are equal to the white community, both of whom are vaccinated more than the Hispanic community and less than Asians."
18127,"the narrative that the unvaccinated in florida are all old dying republicans needs to stop, because it frankly isn't true."
18128,Those above 65 have done a phenomenal job getting vaccinated in florida.
18129,"The younger age brackets need to get on the bandwagon (regardless of political affiliation), the younger groups are the laggards and refusing to vax because they don't think it will impact them."
18130,https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/florida
18131,"Real surgical masks tend to have a layer with an electrostatic charge, just as N95s do so the material itself can filter well but the fit and therefore actual filtration can vary drastically."
18132,They can be modified with certain techniques to improve the fit and therefore filtration all the way up to a similar level as an N95.
18133,Various governments in Europe and Asia don't allow cloth masks and do allow procedural/surgical masks for this reason.
18134,They are also more consistent when it comes to the level of protection as cloth can vary quite drastically and starts at 10%.
18135,I would link to sources but the mods won't get me.
18136,Even though they are fine with stating misleading info about masks themselves and offensive stuff as well.
18137,A well fitting respirator is generally the way to go for decent personal protection plus they directly and indirectly reduce the spread to others.
18138,[removed]
18139,"&gt;I'm not anti-vaxx, but deathly afraid of needles."
18140,I am also afraid of needles like this and I held out on getting the vaccine until last month.
18141,"I still wore my mask everywhere because I'm not a fool (still wearing my mask for the same reason, honestly), but I had hoped vaccine adoption would be enough that I could treat the COVID vaccine same as I do the flu one: optional."
18142,"I've had some experiences in the last year though that have put me in a ""fuck the future, only living for today"" mood and that's why I decided to get the vaccine."
18143,"The future is uncertain, we don't know how long we'll have left to do normal type stuff before shit starts gettin' really real and I'd rather not have to worry about long COVID during whatever ""good"" time we have left."
18144,I got my second dose on Monday.
18145,The big thing though that convinced me is everyone said that syringe technology has improved significantly since the last time I got a vaccine (meningitis around 2011) and it was true.
18146,This was the first time I got a shot and didn't cry.
18147,It wasn't bad at all!
18148,For real (as opposed to that lying shit people tell you and then it turns out to be just as bad as you thought it would be because they were LYING).
18149,I would say it's about on par with getting a shot in the mouth after they've tranqed your jaw out with Oragel first.
18150,"You know it's happening, but it's not alarming at all."
18151,"So if you're holding out for that reason, I encourage you to do it."
18152,I liken it to that old thing about when you have sex with someone you‚Äôre having sex with everyone they had sex with and everyone they had sex with and so on.
18153,The vaccine is the condom in this example.
18154,We don't know that for sure.
18155,Not discovering a way yet does not mean there is no way yet to be discovered.
18156,"1) we are never going to reach 80% vaxed

2) this virus will be circulating for a generation and mutating that entire time."
18157,"People pushing this ""they rolled back masks too soon"" narrative need to realize that eliminating the virus or stopping mutations was never an achievable goal."
18158,The CDC?
18159,"Also that‚Äôs not ‚Äúa preponderance of epidemiologists, it‚Äôs a preponderance of those who responded to the survey (which is also implicated by who was asked to take the survey)."
18160,"Much of the media, population, business community and federal politics were never on board with seeing the virus as a problem."
18161,Let the vaccinated people live..lock the unvaccinated people down.
18162,Let's goooooo.
18163,I dont like him either but you can believe in vaccines and respect the rights of others not to.
18164,"It is NOT a position I agree with, but it is possible to be sympethic to people who for example have religious objections to vaccines or claim to while still wanting one yourself."
18165,A postion that masks are effective but should not be manded is another example of a legitimate position.
18166,Again I disagree and see many holes in that choice but I think some of the politicians on the no manade side hold this position.
18167,It is not a simple binary mask= true or false
18168,Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
18169,Stating you got 2 J&amp;J shots without any further explanation only causes confusion (and rightfully so).
18170,"To be fair, if he's not dead, he just got his vaccine."
18171,He's probably pretty protected now until another variant comes along.
18172,"But it doesn't make the guy any smarter, that's for sure."
18173,These people are programmed and would need a complete reformat to change their thinking at this point.
18174,Isnt it amazing to think about?
18175,This whole field of science (which I am absolutely ignorant of) is amazing.
18176,Anti Vaxxers astonish me in this regard.
18177,"To me, its like being handed the most recent top of the line computer and going ""Nah, I think Ill stick to stones and sticks thank you very much!"

18179,"Ouch, that was brutal!"
18180,[removed]
18181,Probably very similar.
18182,Antibody count with Moderna was even higher than Pfizer against delta.
18183,I‚Äôm in a high spread area and wear my mask.
18184,If questioned I say ‚ÄúI trust the 98% effective vaccine but I don‚Äôt trust the public‚Äù.
18185,In my area only 38% are vaccinated.
18186,Feel comfortable in your decision.
18187,They chose denial as a way to cope with the magnitude of a worldwide pandemic.
18188,Also SARS-COV-2 is gaslighting everyone with it's roulette way of killing people.
18189,"For a lot of people, they can't comprehend something they have never seen in their own lives."
18190,"America's previous mitigation efforts shielded them from seeing the true toll Covid is taking, imagine a Covid denying American actually being in Peru, Italy, India, Mexico during a wave?"
18191,Would their cognitive dissonance stay intact?

18202,Honestly I think this narrative is very overblown.
18203,"They had two choices: 

1) Announce that masks are no longer required for the vaccinated."
18204,2) Say that even vaccinated individuals need to continue wearing masks.
18205,Both had their pros and cons and they chose 1 and I honestly think it was the right choice.
18206,"But even if you don't, acting like it was completely unjustifiable and something they're ""crying"" over now is ridiculous."
18207,Going with 2 would disincentivize individuals to get vaccinated.
18208,It also provided a mixed messaging for people who *already* got vaccinated.
18209,"Remember, this was still when we weren't completely sure if you could still *get* COVID with the vaccine, still spread it, etc."
18210,"I fully support them taking the scientific stand and saying ""this vaccine works."
18211,"If you want to be protected, get the vaccine""."
18212,"There really isn't a middle ground where they could have said ""we want people to keep wearing masks but we acknowledge the vaccine works""."
18213,"Furthermore, the reality is this vaccine will be circulating and mutating for a generation."
18214,"A lot of people around here seem to be willfully hoping if we just wore masks for another month, then this virus would have stopped mutating and we wouldn't be seeing delta outbreaks."
18215,There are going to be outbreaks in unvaccinated populations for the next 30 years.

18225,Mine you I do not have any issues with needles so I did not have a need to seek alternative methods but I have not seen any information promoting this as an option (I understand it's on city news but no radio ads or TV ads).
18226,Thank you for this information!
18227,I'll be sure to pass it on to anyone who may have these concerns.
18228,End result is the same.
18229,They are going to find something wrong with any information that comes out about the vaccine regardless of the headline.
18230,Germany released some recommendations for this.
18231,If I had J&amp;J I would absolutely go get an mRNA vaccine.
18232,(Not medical advice just my opinion!)
18233,I agree.
18234,I'm surprised people are making such a big deal of it.
18235,The question wasn‚Äôt specific to the US.
18236,"People here are just going to suffer further, with a good number more of us dying."
18237,But at least we will get to be propagandized to about why this is actually better than countries without this rolling disaster.
18238,Same thing as happens with gun violence and our privatized healthcare system.
18239,That's a faulty comparison.
18240,Efficacy is reduction in outcome rate compared to control group.
18241,Flu has r0 of 1-2.
18242,Delta variant is 5-8 with much more severe disease.
18243,"A loss of efficacy for a much more infectious and severe disease is not ""great"" in any sense."
18244,"Vaccinated populations will experience worse outcomes than before, and the entire pandemic will worsen."
18245,All of this is magnitudes worse than the flu.

18247,"When I had covid I took Tylenol for the fever/headache, melatonin to help combat the sleep disruption, and vitamin D just in case."

18249,You had to get a tetanus shot from a rug burn?
18250,Is this something I should know about?
18251,I had a decent rug burn a few weeks ago.
18252,It healed over the course of about 1.5 weeks.
18253,I never even considered going to doctor let alone a tetanus shot.
18254,Should I have?
18255,7500 miles seems a little on the low side unless you‚Äôre driving a race car with no experience while texting.
18256,VERY cool
18257,It's 95% across the population.
18258,Not 95% across any demographic.
18259,Vaccines work *with* your immune system.
18260,"If your immune system is already weak, the vaccine does less."
18261,"A guy on facebook said ""that is the cost of freedom, we are willing to pay""."
18262,I just could not find words to respond to that!
18263,This is a useless comparison.
18264,No country ever went into lockdowns because of the regular flu.
18265,"The baseline for flu vaccines a pretty low bar to beat, and doesn't really tell us anything."
18266,This comment should have multiple awards and stickied to the top of every discussion thread.
18267,Are you talking about the US?
18268,That is a highly regional thing here.
18269,In several states mask mandates have been prevented by the legislature and night clubs were fully open last summer.
18270,Even in serious states you have counties who refuse to implement mask mandates.
18271,"So vaccinated people will likely wear masks in LA, but I doubt they are in my city since we can't even get unvaccinated people to wear them."

18309,That article is from February and is talking about a theoretical potential risk of delaying second doses and leaving people at greater risk of breakthrough infection and whether that could potentially lead to mutations in those with only partial vaccination.
18310,A recent preliminary study actually suggests that the virus is less likely to mutate in vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people (and there is of course less risk of vaccinated people getting infected at all as well as less risk of a vaccinated person infecting others).

18320,A mask requirement might as well be a return to last year for me because I would rather stay home than go try to enjoy some place with a mask on.
18321,&gt;Why do you think vaccinated people would be against mask wearing?
18322,Because I'm one of them.
18323,I've done what I needed to protect society and myself from the virus and am willing to take my chances with that protection.
18324,"I'll wear a mask if I feel sick and just have to go out for some reason, but to wear one just in case I'm unlucky enough to get it despite vaccination and then even more unlucky enough to both be asymptotic and have a high enough viral load to spread it to others is a bit too much theater for me when the people I'm being expected to perform this theater for are a bunch of people who refuse to do what's right."

18410,We have data on this stuff too.
18411,It seems that the vaccines are fairly good at preventing infection too - typically 5-10% less than the efficacy for symptomatic disease.
18412,And you are right - there is a big grey area on what constitutes an actual infection when someone tests positive since the test find virus - the vaccines can obviously not prevent someone from exposing you and thus taking virus into your body.

18464,It seems like a lot of /r/coronavirus readers are endorsing mask wearing again everywhere but one thing I didn't like doing was wearing the mask TBH.
18465,I'd rather take a breakthrough case of COVID over wearing a mask.
18466,I might be in the minority here but I took the vaccine specifically to avoid mask wearing.
18467,I masked up during the pandemic but the idea of needing to wear them forever is disconcerting IMO.

18488,Isn't that a good argument against restrictions?

18851,"The flu kills 2-600K people globally, per year."
18852,Global COVID deaths were 3 million plus in 2020.
18853,A COVID vaccine that was only as effective as the flu vaccine would still mean 2 to 6 times more death as occur from the flu.
18854,"&gt;‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre not going to be hospitalized, you‚Äôre not going to be in the IC unit, and you‚Äôre not going to die,‚Äù

Not quoted in this story is Biden also saying  ""You're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations."""
18855,"https://mobile.twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1418017801437073411

An unfortunate mis-statement because obviously breakthrough infections are occurring, even if the symptoms are generally mild."
18856,"But this quote is already being jumped on by antivaxxers and now we're going to hear ""Biden lied!"""
18857,until the end of time.
18858,Many of us didn't see family or friends for over a year.
18859,"Gyms were closed, I didn't go to bars or restaurants, and haven't seen a concert in over a year."
18860,I postponed my wedding and lost thousands of dollars.
18861,"I know reddit attracts a lot of introverted people who felt like the past year and a half wasn't that bad because they don't care about concerts or bars, but I'm shocked that so many people are downplaying the sacrifices we all have made."
18862,"Yes, our lockdowns weren't full fledged ""don't leave your house"" lockdowns, but the mental health effects  of damn near zero socialization or social events can't be offset by an afternoon in a park for **a lot** of people."
18863,[deleted]
18864,The percentage of one side that plans on getting vaccinated is around 96%.
18865,The other side is around 47%.
18866,It might not be old people but it's clearly proportional towards one side.
18867,"That's my theory, yeah.."
18868,Dude.
18869,You can‚Äôt just ‚ÄúBlabla‚Äù kids in the ICU.
18870,It makes you sound as bad as the anti vaxxers.
18871,found it: https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762
18872,Can you imagine the culpability of knowing you are wrong about something that is killing people but still spreading it to millions of people for some agenda known only to yourself.
18873,"I'm looking at you, Tucker."
18874,It's a really tough situation.
18875,"If it were anyone other than your dad, I'd just cut him off."
18876,We won't allow anyone who is eligible for vaccination and declines to see our 3 year old son.
18877,Thankfully all of our close relatives have been vaccinated so it hasn't been that hard of a choice to make.
18878,I think the advice to have him talk to a medical professional he trusts is very good.
18879,I was just wondering the other day at who the 65+ people getting vaccinated (in the USA) now are.
18880,My wife said she just read an article that a lot of them are coming from vaccine hesitant people being convinced by their primary care providers.
18881,Sad but true.
18882,"And Fauci ""might want to consider"" telling the truth to the people who pay his wages and stop calling Senators liars."
18883,"He damn well knew what would come of his policies, which is why he stopped reporting daily covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths."
18884,"It's also why he went hard on Rebekah Jones, the whistle blower who revealed that Desantis wanted to manipulate the numbers."
18885,"Bet their latest reported numbers are fudged as well, and way worse than what's being reported."
18886,If you wear it right and the mask isn't homemade you won't catch the flu.
18887,"Well you can't fix stupid, and it breeds like rats."
18888,Come on killer comets!

18890,Something like 99% of cases and deaths are amongst the unvaccinated.
18891,A quick google search will get you valid sources.
18892,"&gt;I'm not anti-vaxx, but deathly afraid of needles."
18893,"Generally, I avoid flu shots and other minor vaccinations because needles stress me out."
18894,They have a nasal spray for the flu shot too.
18895,You just have to ask for it.
18896,Sometimes they have to order one and it takes a few days to get there.
18897,"And also for anyone afraid of needles, I literally could not feel the covid shot needle either time."
18898,I legitimately was worried they had like...missed my arm and only felt better when my arm was sore the next day.
18899,"Too true, there are some who cannot be reasoned with and, even when faced with reality, will claim otherwise."
18900,"For those few, I doubt anything will change their minds."
18901,It must be a sad life.
18902,It's almost as if they keep collecting more and more data and adjusting the results based on the new information.
18903,For most people all their vaccines are forced and  finished when they are children.
18904,Aside from hpv and shingles there isn‚Äôt anything a normal citizen can get that they aren‚Äôt already inoculated against.
18905,I also suspect at that point they are desperate and mixing it up with all their miracle cures.
18906,"I‚Äôm not sure what kind of hospital you work in, but the ones I have worked in only had a handful of rooms built as negative pressure rooms."
18907,"Most units didn‚Äôt have any, the ICUs had 2-4."
18908,"And when COVID was at it‚Äôs peak, people certainly weren‚Äôt turned away (as you suggested), because those rooms were full."
18909,I agree that's the best solution.
18910,I think they realized shit was going to get BAD with delta.
18911,"Like, they are not completely dumb, they have now come out against restrictions, lockdowns, and effectively vaccines."
18912,"They are stuck with super low vaccinations, and a variant that's going to tear through the place."
18913,At some point it's going to be hard to hide the deaths.
18914,It‚Äôs awesome information keeps changing during this pandemic.
18915,/s        I know COVID-19 is new and we don‚Äôt have all the answers yet but    Wah
18916,"Yeah, I almost got taken out by the flu (that went into a mycobacterium pneumonia + complications) when I was 17."
18917,"It‚Äôs been years, but I still get my flu shot every fall and have had no issues in following the health guidelines and then some."
18918,Lungs not doing that whole ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù thing for a while sticks with you.
18919,You might get your wish.
18920,The Delta is said to be deadlier.
18921,And that damn thing is mutating still
18922,Anti vax people that are dying are their voters.
18923,Simple as that
18924,Nobody is asking for your sympathy
18925,Israeli news just reported 39% against being infected and 91% against serious illness.

18946,I got sent home from my college and had to day goodbye to everyone I knew.
18947,That was the last time I saw my lover who has since disappeared from my life because of lockdown exhaustion.
18948,I lost contact withe everyone and have been left without a support net.

Dynamics of the virus?"
18959,This is a perfect example of how the messaging for the past 18 months has been lacking.
18960,It's such a vague and esoteric message so as to be practically useless.
18961,"As the authority on the matter, he should commit to a blanket recommendation one way or the other."
18962,It's ok to be overly reductive in communicating guidance to the masses.

18964,Dead people don‚Äôt vote
18965,I recently got Moderna and I had covid back in June 2020.
18966,"I just had redness, soreness, and itching on my arm and a really bad headache that lasted for a couple of hours."
18967,The person who vaccinated me told me that those who have had covid before usually react worse to the first shot unlike those who haven't had covid reacting to the second shot.
18968,Headache and arm soreness were my only side effects.
18969,"&gt; if not for the vaccine, 

You'd probably be dead."
18970,"We don't know if that's true, but there is nothing wrong with mentioning that out loud."

18976,I think is time for the current government to stop pretending the previous government is not trying to push the antivax agenda.
18977,Is time to make vaccines mandatory and ban all type of antivax propaganda.
18978,Is the only way to put a stop to the pandemic.
18979,Also vaccinated people should be given a certificate which should be required to attend any public place or air /sea traveling.
18980,Almost none of those have been reported with kids
18981,Yeah they thought they would get away with riding the anti vaccine wave.
18982,because the sane part of the country was getting vaccinated = GOP reap the benefits of other people‚Äôs sacrifice without contributing.
18983,Looked like they were going to get away with it this spring.
18984,Cases were going down because of the moderate vaccine rates.
18985,Now they see with the delta variant is pushing the need for vaccinations way higher.
18986,they are not having their cake and eating it too anymore.
18987,If they don‚Äôt get their base vaccinated it will either die off or we will need further rounds of shutdowns that are bad for business.
18988,Israel 64% is vs infection.
18989,This 88% is efficacy vs symptomatic infection.
18990,Two different things they are measuring.

18993,They were the ones that thought we can trust anti vax to keep masks on.
18994,Complete dumbasses.
18995,That‚Äôs what the pivotal point was.
18996,I think we need to offer money compensation in exchange for the vaccine.
18997,I believe paying people $200 to get the shot would be enough to convince a large portion of people to get it.
18998,"Because if China says no they can't get into the country, the WHO can't conduct an investigation in China if the Chinese government doesn't want them to."
18999,They can refuse to give them visas and arrest them if they do it anyway.

19003,"I am sure they know the carnage it could cause to that population, even with the community vaccinated."
19004,70% of hospitalizations and deaths from breakout cases are part of the 65+ age group.
19005,"For people that show compassion and care in one of most emotionally-challenging jobs, it is really difficult to fathom how vaccination rates are so low."
19006,"I'm glad this one is more accurate than some other maps (looking at you, CNN) that portray VT as having some big surge."
19007,"Our cases have technically increased, but an increase from 5 a day to 10 really shouldn't count as a surge."

19022,"He's taken covid seriously because he doesn't want to die from it, though."
19023,I‚Äôll delete my response.

19025,not sure if that would be allowed under the Affordable insurance act.
19026,Wouldn't that be like a pre-existing condition?
19027,Short of publicly beating the shit out of anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers?

19044,Biden and Trump (and a few others) on the same stage giving the same message that people should get vaccinated.
19045,"The leadership of both parties agree that the vaccines are good for us, so just have them say it together at the same time."
19046,"It's a few outlying crazy voices that are scaring people and they get to say ""It's only the other side that wants you to take these drugs."""
19047,Break that by having a unified message.
19048,Make it a party with a few musicians doing performances.
19049,Celebrate the vaccine properly.
19050,It'll never happen but I think that would break some of the last pockets of resistance.
19051,"Do you think Fox news is going to say Trump is wrong, the vaccine is still bad?"
19052,"I lost a year and a half of my life, I‚Äôm back to normal and you should be too."
19053,Stop moving the goalposts and move on.
19054,Are you that dense?
19055,Not supporting compulsatory vaccinations doesn‚Äôt make you anti-vaccine.

19057,Not forgetting accompanied by an image that invokes a subconscious prejudice
19058,Fair point.
19059,I'll swear for you
19060,It's a moral question.
19061,Are you willing to accept that you might spread the disease to an unvaccinated person and they might die?
19062,I certainly am.
19063,They have had their chance to protect themselves; if they get sick at this point it's on them.
19064,"And virtually everyone who doesn't get vaccinated is going to end up getting sick at some point anyway, no matter how many masks we wear."
19065,Other people disagree with that moral framework and are free to wear masks to mitigate that risk.
19066,"Cities may require masks in certain settings to help mitigate the healthcare burden, and you should comply with that regardless of your beliefs."
19067,But you don't have to wear it if you don't want to.
19068,"You also have lots of people who got sick with Covid, was a mild case, and now won't vaccinate because ""they're already immune"""
19069,My aunt almost died from it (coma for 30 days) and her daughter and son in law refuse to get the vaccine.

19079,There's no sudden epiphany or awakening of their conscience.
19080,The GOP's big data scientists are running their statistical models and concluding their voter base is (or will be) shrinking as a result of not vaccinating.
19081,They used to believe siding with anti-vaxxers would result in more votes.
19082,"But now they believe promoting vaccinations will result in more votes, so now they're promoting vaccinations."

19098,"Nothing more i bet, they don't give a shit about anyone lol"
19099,"I agree with all your stats but not your overall conclusions, probably due to different priorities."
19100,"From last summer, I haven‚Äôt really been worried getting sick from Covid."
19101,"I‚Äôm 33, perfect bloodwork, perfect blood pressure, non-smoker, no significant allergies (although I am allergic to latex, I get a rash from sustained exposure), no autoimmune conditions (even something like mild eczema) and healthy weight (asterisk here because I gained about 15 lbs in the last year so I‚Äôm just over the threshold for overweight BMI)."
19102,"Prior to the vaccine and my weight gain, my most probably outcome from a Covid infection was an unpleasant cold-like illness."
19103,"(And I was WFH with plenty of PTO, so no financial risk either.)"
19104,This is true for my boyfriend as well.
19105,We locked down hard due to the moral concerns about transmitting Covid to someone who would be harmed.
19106,Our concern has always been participating in a transmission chain that killed anyone down the line.
19107,"Basically we were trying to prevent the death of someone 10 links down the chain, whose death we would never know about."
19108,All my efforts and sacrifices have been for other hypothetical people and not my own health risks.
19109,The lockdown had a worse impact on my physical and mental health than the most probable Covid outcome.
19110,I did it because it was the right thing to do.
19111,"So, from that perspective, a 12% transmission risk post-vaccination was still significant in that moral framework."
19112,"We slowly eased up on my household restrictions until about mid-June, when we really relaxed our behavior."
19113,The reason we waited until mid-June was to give  everyone in the US time to get vaccinated.
19114,Vaccinations became widely available without an appointment by early May throughout the US.
19115,You didn‚Äôt have to refresh or drive for hours anymore.
19116,You could walk into a random CVS and get jabbed.
19117,"At this point, the _vast_ majority US residents who are harmed by a Covid-19 have chosen that outcome by not getting vaccinated."
19118,"My moral responsibly for domestic unvaxxed is basically zero, I don‚Äôt care."
19119,"I still believe in precautions to prevent international spread ‚Äî I isolate and get tested before flying, to avoid participating in an international transmission chain."
19120,"That aside, I think you have many older and vulnerable people who are at-risk for moderate or significant illness and don‚Äôt realize it."
19121,My boyfriend‚Äôs dad is 78 and had a previous heart attack.
19122,He is no longer taking any precautions because he got vaccinated (with J&amp;J).
19123,A bad flu would enough to harm his health‚Ä¶ I think he‚Äôs overestimating the protection from his vaccine.

19166,Thank God.
19167,I think that‚Äôs pretty good.
19168,"So If we wanted to adjust it for the ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù of 60% vaccine efficacy against infection and assume that everybody infected transmits it efficiently (which we know is almost certainly not true), then it would be 16% benefit?"
19169,Is that right?
19170,I suck at math.
19171,So then we can conclude that it‚Äôs somewhere between 4 and 16% added benefit?
19172,Good.
19173,Keep the focus on vaccines and not masks.
19174,Vaccinated people not wearing a mask is not a threat.

19197,"This is a post about the governor of florida, how can it not be political?"
19198,Good work overcoming your fear of needles for the coronavirus vaccine!
19199,Vaccine companies are or are about to start conducting trials for boosters that target variants specifically.
19200,Because vaccines aren't 100% effective?
19201,Good.
19202,No special treatment for the morons who won't get their shots.
19203,iMHO its important not to rub it in.
19204,Let them have a narrative where Trump funded development and they personally waited for clear evidence to see past a situation clouded by the next administration's bumbled rollout.
19205,Let them have a conclusion that now is the smart time to be getting the shot.
19206,All I care is that they get it.
19207,"We can fight political battles in the domain of politics, not worry about keeping score over public health."
19208,Israel has claimed as recently as this afternoon that the vaccines offer only 41% protection against symptomatic infection.

19211,no.

19219,Viet Nam is also producing Sputnik V for Russia.
19220,"Everyday Israel seems to be lowering the reported efficacy, but I can rarely find the reports."
19221,Is this just on tv in Israel or what?
19222,Still waiting on actual studies from the reports that it‚Äôs 64% from 2 weeks ago.
19223,"Once again, the US is very regional."
19224,There are going to be many places that will not or maybe even can't implement a mask mandate.
19225,My state is one of them.
19226,You might already know that but the amount of people I encounter here who don't would surprise you.
19227,Obviously low quality masks with thin material are not going to work.
19228,To say that there are few/little studies on cloth masks or surgical masks is foolish and ignorant.
19229,"Just follow the CDC guidelines for masks in school, it is as simple as that."

Why do surgeons use them in surgery if it's ""hard to tell?"""
19231,I was just hoping you were from there and could spill the tea
19232,The market went down and the money men told the party to cut the shit.
19233,So it‚Äôs basically worthless.
19234,Whole point of getting the vaccine was to be able to finally stop wearing masks and socially distancing.
19235,"You don‚Äôt see the polio vaccine saying, ‚Äúmay reduce chances of death/paralysis but you‚Äôll still get sick‚Äù 

Plus it‚Äôll still mutate if you get it, vaccinated or not"
19236,"‚ÄúAnother pivotal point‚Äù, yet they come out and brush off boosters and drop mask mandate too early which is now blowing up in their face."
19237,Is delta more deadly towards younger people?
19238,"Before the vaccine there were all ages being hospitalized, now they are nonstop with the ‚Äúyounger people‚Äù  is it only because the majority of 50+ are vaccinated so therefore all that‚Äôs left is younger?"
19239,Or is delta like the Spanish flu and the second time around it wrecks the younger demographic?
19240,It‚Äôs hard to tell.

19268,"Then I shared facts and figures on how everything he's saying is wrong, hoping he let his guard down hearing from more informed people on the subject."
19269,He thought the articles I shared were insightful and made a narrow list of the vaccines he would consider if he did get it after clicking some in-article links that broke all the options down.

19309,&gt; I'm wondering what can improve vaccination rates.
19310,I think the only way is to reward people who got vaccinated or punish people who didn't.
19311,"You could give everyone who has gotten vaccinated money, the higher the amount, the better it will work, or you make being vaccinated mandatory for certain places."
19312,[removed]
19313,Yeah-whatever kid.
19314,It‚Äôs not ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù the entire point of getting the vaccine was to not get infected at all.
19315,‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs fine you‚Äôll just be a little sick‚Äù oh you mean I‚Äôll still be infected with the virus that‚Äôs causing blood clots and long term effects?
19316,I‚Äôll still have to take unpaid time off work?
19317,This man doesn't live in the same reality you and I do.
19318,He might as well be on another planet.
19319,"Also, curious what his insurance company will think of his statements should he need to be re-hospitalized (even if he is a total moron, I hope that doesn't happen.)"
19320,[removed]
19321,"True, if a population is under-vaccinated it would be fair to raise their rates."
19322,Well...fair might be a huge overstatement when it comes to insurance.
19323,None of it is fair.
19324,But my perspective is different since I am Canadian.
19325,"Using location however would kind of defeat the purpose, since it wouldn't affect specifically the non-vaccinated."
19326,I remember when the USA had to euthanize pigs.

19330,The less the negative decisions of some affect the rest- the better.
19331,"Unfortunately, even in a fictional scenario where an individual like this man is saddled with the entire cost himself, the likely inability to repay those charges as well as the limited resources of hospitals and the physical, mental and emotional tax it has on healthcare workers cannot be avoided."
19332,"Not to get all philosophical here, but there is a solid argument to be made that the protection and ‚Äúconsequence absorption‚Äù made by society in cases like these increases the likelihood that people like this man live into adulthood and propagate- thereby steadily increasing the negative impact people like this have on a given society."
19333,What if we‚Äôve neared the point where the percentage of idiots surpasses a 50% threshold and begin to dictate the democratic direction of an entire populace?

19353,It‚Äôs largely pointless.
19354,-Unvaccinated population is least likely to wear a mask.

19390,I'm a break through.
19391,Cognitive dissonance is real and very hard to wrap our heads around.
19392,People are unable to sit with two opposing feelings and views a lot of the time.
19393,"On the vaccine hesitant side, they can‚Äôt reconcile the fact that, while there are rare risks and side effects from the vaccine, that it‚Äôs their best option to reduce death and long term risks, despite lack of long term data."
19394,"Conversely, people who are zealots for vaccines above all else can often time dismiss and refuse to acknowledge that there is a non-zero level of risk for vaccines for some people and that we have an overall lack of long term data which might cause hesitancy."
19395,Those for vaccines should at least recognize this as everyone has a different medical history.
19396,Working to be transparent about overall risk and combat misinformation with accurate data is the best way to show people their need.
19397,So far this has sort of been done but there‚Äôs definitely room for more.
19398,"Otherwise I mean, yeah, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to convince my cousin‚Äôs ex wife‚Äôs family to get the vaccine when they 100% refuse because it‚Äôs being pushed by Joe Biden and to them, all Biden bad, all trump good."
19399,Some people dont ask for that.
19400,What country?
19401,they do them 3 weeks apart here.
19402,May the odds be ever in your favor.
19403,"I'm not really talking about reaching herd immunity, I'm saying that even without lockdowns the surge will end without getting close to infecting everyone, which should be strong evidence that lockdowns don't do much at all to blunt transmission"

19413,Would suck when all the unvaccinated take all the room at the hospital and you couldn‚Äôt get the care you needed for a common livable emergency‚Ä¶ the vaccine was only ever a tool to get through the pandemic not the answer to it.
19414,"What I'm saying is that it is likely that even without lockdowns this surge will die fairly soon, as all previous surges have."
19415,"I think this will be very strong evidence that the lockdowns have very little effect, if any"

19427,"Yes, but it‚Äôs a very non-specific symptom that could also be explained by any number of other viruses, seasonal allergies, or poor air quality, which is happening in a large swath of North America right now, because the west coast is on fire again."
19428,Set your mind at ease and get a test.
19429,"I‚Äôd settle for not seeing any more ignorant comments implying that the unvaccinated deserve COVID, or that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù or ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù or anything else of the sort."
19430,But ideally we would stop attacking the weakest members of society and have a more compassionate attitude.
19431,"That said, I realize that‚Äôs kind of an abstract answer, but I wasn‚Äôt making a comment advocating a concrete policy."
19432,"Just pointing out that the general attitude toward the unvaccinated seems to be one that is both ignorant and unhelpful, and quite possibly counter productive."
19433,I'm not talking about vaccines for school.
19434,I'm taking about mandatory vaccines for everyone.
19435,Courts have already upheld vaccine requirements for school and I'm 100% in favor of that.

19466,Only Israel was giving those low values of ~70%.
19467,"Should have stayed ""unchanged"" before the last change."
19468,ü§î
19469,Kind of wondering the same.
19470,"Last Thursday i was super stuffy, had a low grade fever for a few hours."
19471,Friday and Saturday I could literally not keep my eyes open.
19472,Fell asleep multiple times watching a movie during both afternoons with my wife.
19473,Monday basically back to normal.
19474,I live in an area with VERY high delta numbers and no one masks.
19475,Had me wondering...
19476,[removed]
19477,Delta variants and lambda variants causing cases to surge
19478,There is no lack of supply at all in the USA.
19479,Even the poorest marginalized communities can get the vaccine and the most rural.
19480,There is no excuse and no systemic issue anymore.
19481,You see words are like bullets
19482,[removed]
19483,The fact that you don‚Äôt find him credible brings your data sources into question.
19484,You need to smarter than that.
19485,"You got vaccinated to protect you in case you caught COVID, and you can still very much catch it and pass it in to people."
19486,"I get that you want the world to go back to normal, so do the rest of us."
19487,But we are still in this pandemic and it was the lifting of restrictions way too early that started this new surge.
19488,Why would you lose it if somebody brought up immunocompromised or kids?
19489,What do you mean by this?
19490,Are you saying you don't care about those groups of people?
19491,"If they catch it and die, then that's fine by you?"
19492,As long as YOU got to act like the world is normal?
19493,What are you trying to say here?
19494,As a RRT these are the people I know I be tubing and they will die.
19495,I tell them if they don't I will be the last person they see.
19496,"Cool, but the assholes who aren't vaccinated aren't wearing masks."
19497,You can make them wear masks again.
19498,I'm basically being asked to endanger myself every time I go into a public place because you decide you don't want to do civil work anymore.

19505,You just can't reason with some people.

19507,[deleted]
19508,&gt; Edit: looking at the numbers elsewhere I realize what i just said is based on deceptive data.
19509,"They are all increasing, but it‚Äôs increasing from incredibly small numbers so it makes the % jump look huge when in fact it‚Äôs nothing compared to Alabama and Florida."
19510,My bad.
19511,"Yeah, my county has gone from a 0.5% to slightly over 1% test positivity rate over the last few weeks, which is a little concerning."
19512,"In comparison, some counties in Alabama are over 20%."
19513,"Our daily new cases have doubled to 15 per 100k people, while in Alabama and Florida you're talking about 200-400+ per 100k people per day."
19514,"Except for the whole ‚ÄúIn the presence of a large number of hosts, viruses mutate and get more efficient at infecting them.‚Äù

Delta is the fourth identified variant."
19515,"The vaccines were tested, for the most part, against the wild virus, the alpha."
19516,You also don't know if it's raw data or matched by age cohort.
19517,"Raw data is going to make efficacy for vaccines look much worse, because it's comparing the older and sicker vaccinated population with the younger and healthier unvaccinated population."
19518,"Matched by age is major, because you don't want to know how well 70 year old vaccinated people are doing against 30 year old unvaccinated."
19519,You want to know how well they're doing against other 70 year olds who are unvaccinated.
19520,"&gt; I'm not afraid of needles, but seriously you barely feel it."
19521,That doesn't help most people with phobias (rather than a simple aversion to needles).
19522,It usually isn't about the pain or feeling at all.
19523,Nor even seeing it; the knowledge of it is usually enough to trigger the phobia.
19524,I've got a friend who has a phobia of needles strong enough that it's close to actually interfering with his life at times.
19525,"And the way he describes it too, it has nothing at all to do with the pain."
19526,"For him specifically, it's something about the thought of the needle piercing his body."
19527,And at that point it doesn't matter if he can see it or feel it; simply knowing it is about to happen makes him completely lock up.
19528,"Afterwards he's completely fine, but the lead-up is as he describes it horrible."
19529,He's got his first dose recently though despite his phobia.
19530,I feel your pain here.
19531,My son is too young to receive it as well do we have family members who refuse to wear it.
19532,Really shitty situation.
19533,"I'm thankful that I'm in a part of the country with little activity, but I can't help but to worry that it'll make its way here eventually."

19535,[removed]
19536,May I ask what the experience was like being sick with covid while vaccinated?
19537,Did it feel like mono?
19538,Or is there anything you can compare it to?

19549,"Ethics committees get involved, institutional review boards."
19550,Saying they are the same is definitely inaccurate.
19551,Education for everyone was meant to prevent problems like this.
19552,Except our exceptional American education system has failed so exceptionally that we now find people who outright denies medical science popping up in every part of the country.
19553,Excess death studies by statisticians have proven that covid death totals are likely underreported in the US
19554,"Gotta love that ""freedom""."
19555,We should also take some time to applaud the Amercan educational system.

19626,What kind of masks are you wearing?
19627,I've eliminated glasses fog by wearing kf94 masks that fits snug on my face.
19628,And they're pretty okay to breath in too
19629,I never said that.
19630,I said *I‚Äôd* move.
19631,I know not everyone has that option for various reasons.
19632,Depends on the R0 of the virus.
19633,Higher the R0 the more people we need.
19634,Initial estimates ( and realize they are just estimates ) were 70-80%.
19635,Exactly.
19636,I think in this case you could let the market decide.
19637,I'd certainly would prefer to patronize an establishment that enforces vaccination.
19638,I'd feel safer shopping or eating there.
19639,And then you could have establishments that don't and let the idiots who refuse to be vaccinated hang there and spread covid to each other.

19699,Heck at our hospital we even have family members get angry/confrontational at the nurses and intensivists that they didn't save their relative or give them the right meds to fix the Covid.

19706,But that also would need to factor in proportions and percentages based on population rates and I'm not smart enough to do all that math.
19707,I live in Florida and I'm alright with cases hovering around 600-1000 statewide.

19790,&gt; This is happening primarily in states that did not expand Medicaid to cover more people.
19791,"That's hilarious (in a ""laughing because you'd otherwise cry"" way)."
19792,"Missouri voters actually voted to expand Medicaid, but the state government decided not to enact that decision."

19820,This should really be the number 1 comment.
19821,It‚Äôs abhorrent that this is broadcast.
19822,There absolutely will be people who see this and choose not to be vaccinated because of it.

19826,"The numbers don‚Äôt support it though, maybe not quite 90% placebo, that‚Äôs an exaggeration to a degree on my part but based on the numbers they‚Äôre probably more like 30%-40% effective and that was with the less contagious variants floating around."

19829,I personally vaccinated over 150 people in a two day span with the Pfizer vaccine.
19830,"In those two days, we had no anaphylactic reactions (serious, life threatening allergic reactions which we would expect up to 20min after the vaccine), and the most common immediate side effect was a sore arm."
19831,Most people will get a sore arm.
19832,"Few people will display flu-like symptoms (body sore, fever, fatigue), but those will recover within 48hr of the onset of these symptoms."
19833,"The flu-like symptoms are not COVID, but are basically the body's way of showing you that there's an immune response to the vaccine, that it's doing its job essentially."
19834,I have recommended Pfizer and Moderna to all of my family members.
19835,My Mother is now fully vaccinated as well as my Grandma and brother after I recommended it.
19836,I would not recommend it to you if I didn't believe in it myself.
19837,I am also fully vaccinated as is my husband.
19838,The benefits far outweigh the risks for us.
19839,"Whatever is available in your area, Pfizer or Moderna, make an appointment and get your first dose."

19845,To resist the urge to confirm your own biases is to resist nature itself.
19846,I think we certainly should start rolling out new vaccines that target the delta variant.
19847,It is now the main variant after all.

19870,Will it be a universal mandate?
19871,No.
19872,Will your life become progressively harder to live without a vaccine as the days past approval go on?
19873,Absofuckinglutely we live in a capitalist society who's main goal is to protect profit.
19874,We just lucked out that currently protecting profit also means protecting people from a pandemic.
19875,Very soon after approval vaccine pushes will start going from incentives to requirements in many places.

19893,"This is the myth I am dealing with in my family:

‚ÄúThis is not a vaccine."
19894,This is a mRNA packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell.
19895,"It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator.‚Äù, Martin says."
19896,"&gt;‚ÄúYou are getting injected with a chemical substance to induce illness, not to induce an immuno-transmissive response, in other words nothing about this is going to stop you from transmitting anything."

19901,"the problem is we're not allowed to talk about who's avoiding the vaccines without being called a racist

19926,I would like to see the efficacy by age group and medical conditions.

19928,"Theoretically, if we only vaccinated people who were on death's door, and calculated it the way that person did, the results would indicate the vaccine increased likelihood to be hospitalized 

Since the UK vaccinated rate was so varied based on age group, it's something you can't ignore for them."

19939,There are too many variables otherwise.
19940,Ie.
19941,99% in June does not equal 99% in September.
19942,A control group allows you to compare apples to apples.
19943,Efficacy tells you how protected you are compared to someone who is not vaccinated.

19957,I'm glad there's been no masks off mandates in my city despite vaccination rates because our numbers continue to fall and I feel safer in public.

19970,29m I waited to get vaccinated until this month before my birthday.
19971,I hate talking about it because everyone stigmizes this issue so much that I receive weird looks so I actively avoid the conversation.
19972,So with that being said I know I have some unpopular opinions that I am willing to share now.
19973,But first I am willing to accept that initially I was being a hypocrite when the vaccine first came out because I found it outrageously stupid that it was essentially mandated that to go maskless you needed a vaccine.
19974,On top of that my work was collecting information on people and their vaccination status and reporting it for California.
19975,"This made me uneasy and uncomfortable because I preached to follow the science and here I was getting the erge to go against it just to ""fight the man""."
19976,I also take ADHD medication that affects my heart and no doctor could tell me the effects of the vaccine mixed with my medication.
19977,I've looked it up and tried to find studies.
19978,Obviously this is new so none have really been done.
19979,I'm not gonna pretend I knew without a shadow of a doubt that there would be new variants and the vaccine would become useless but I did believe there would eventually be a mutation that the vaccine would be less effective against.
19980,Nothing in the news really changed my mind except for the effectiveness of the vaccine againt the most prevalent strain.
19981,Along with me finding out that myocarditis and my medication is not as prevalent then I thought.
19982,I got covid in Jan and lost two family members to it.
19983,Not because they didn't believe it didn't exist either.
19984,Someone else just broke the circle of trust and got exposed and decided not to tell anyone.
19985,Lastly and probably the one I'll get the most hate for is I have accepted the fate of this pandemic will bring upon us.
19986,The last time we faced this was the Spanish flu and looked how that turned out?
19987,Exactly the same politized BS that's happening now happened then.
19988,So I'm not gonna sit here and pretend that things will ever get back to normal.
19989,Here I am with a mix of AZ and Pfizer wondering how well that actually is.
19990,Because breakthrough infections are very unlikely to become new outbreaks.
19991,"That's the whole reason the CDC lifted mask guidance for the vaccinated was because data came back indicating robust antibody presence in the mucus membranes (eyes, nose, throat, genitals) that would reduce shedding if an infection breaks through the vaccine's general protections."
19992,Don't be completely passive during the waiting period.
19993,Keep trying/asking to get the second shot.

As to other preparations... map out the fastest route to the closest emergency room, buy a good air purifier, and whatever your parents might need if they're not able to leave the house for a bit."

20002,"I totally get that some people have a legit reason, but I am sick of this dragging out because a minority of our country is stupid."

20019,"Oh, and two of them were already on the ASD spectrum before the vaccines, so there's that"
20020,Different countries gave the vaccines at different intervals which changes its effectiveness so different countries will have different end results against delta as it seems to strain immunity more.
20021,Israel‚Äôs data has been criticized since no one knows how they arrived at those figures and they‚Äôre outliers generally speaking but also unless you‚Äôre in Israel or you got your vaccine at the same intervals they did they probably aren‚Äôt going to be super relevant to you anyway.

20036,No point in wearing them like chin diapers.

20039,"if all the people who are dying are choosing not to get vaccinated, i don‚Äôt see the problem here personally"
20040,"Lol, everyday they come up with these numbers but don't publish the actual data"

&gt; You can feel however you want but I'm looking at the actual data and following the CDC guidelines

I'm saying the CDC is still saying that people with pre-existing conditions, which is most people in the U.S., *should* be wearing masks, so the implication that someone wearing a mask isn't following ""science and the CDC guidelines"" is wrong."
20088,It kind of sounds like you just want to point fingers at everyone wearing a mask and accuse them of following their feelings over science even though the majority of them probably *are* when you look at how many pre-existing conditions there are.
20089,"&gt; I can agree we could use more data before drawing a solid conclusion maybe, but I don't see how you then extend that to assume the data we do have is actually wrong and judge others for not making the same assumptions."

20091,I never said the current science was wrong.
20092,"I said: 

&gt; I haven't seen enough data on it to say anything like this so confidently...my point being we don't have hard data about this, so maybe let's not make confident declarations about it yet."

20150,You are right.
20151,No one seems to want to take charge and do what is necessary end the pandemic.
20152,We keep going forward and the having setbacks because people are not cooperating.
20153,Employers here can only ask if employees are vaccinated.
20154,They cannot ask for proof.
20155,One of our county who‚Äôs covid numbers are really rising has put a mask mandate back on vaccinated or not for certain types of business for the employees only.
20156,Customers are encouraged to mask up but not required.
20157,No official is ready to take the step to go back to statewide mask mandate.
20158,I really don‚Äôt see how making selected employees wear masks is going to help when the customers far out number employees.

20202,Internal polling?
20203,Maybe it finally hit them that the population doing most of the dying now (rural/Southern/unvaccinated) are predominantly R voters and they can't afford to have the party shrink any more than it already has.
20204,Nate Silver also made the point that this is likely to be an issue voters care about in next year's midterms.
20205,Most Americans adults (and thus a majority of likely voters) are at least partly vaccinated -- and may not feel too kindly towards the unvaccinated folks who are dragging out the pandemic.
20206,Especially when so many are refusing the vaccine on political grounds.
20207,My grandma has Alzheimer's and is in a home.
20208,One of her nurses admitted to breaking public health orders and visiting her sons in a town multiple hours away (inter-regional travel was banned at the time).

20210,"She didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with that, despite the residents of her workplace not even being allowed outside, and heckled my parents for not doing the same to come visit me."

20227,How do you know that though?
20228,"You are using your assumption as evidence, how does that work?"
20229,There are many factors to take into account for ending a surge.
20230,People just deciding that the hospital overflowing is enough of a reason to lock themselves down would also end a surge without a lockdown being needed.
20231,"Generally surges don't just end on their own without the general population making some type of adjustment, even in 1918 people knew the importance of masks and self isolating in areas hit hard by the Spanish flu."

20272,Don‚Äôt you think that some of these issues- many of which have directly affected quality of education and educational opportunities- have contributed to the disproportionately low percentage electing to get the vaccine?

Unfortunately this is not realistic and really never has been, for a variety of reasons - https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2

In terms of transmission as we were discussing, ""'Herd immunity is only relevant if we have a transmission-blocking vaccine."
20386,"If we don‚Äôt, then the only way to get herd immunity in the population is to give everyone the vaccine,' says Shweta Bansal, a mathematical biologist at Georgetown University in Washington DC."""

20395,"I sympathize with those trying to protect the immunocompromised and have no problem at all wearing a mask, however I also feel it's unrealistic to expect Americans to do this long term (again, not myself as I honestly couldn't care less if I need to wear a mask)."

20404,It is related to an ongoing research project tracking the public's attitudes and experiences with COVID-19 vaccinations.
20405,"The article has a section ""Why Some Adults Remain Unvaccinated""."
20406,"Quoting from that section:

&gt; When those who remain unvaccinated were asked about their main reason for not getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the most commonly offered reasons are around concerns about side effects (21%), followed by concerns that the vaccine was too new, too unknown, or not tested enough (16%)."
20407,One in ten (12%) offer they haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated because they don‚Äôt think they need the vaccine.
20408,"Smaller, but still significant shares, say they haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated because they just want to wait and see (7%), they don‚Äôt trust the vaccine and don‚Äôt normally get vaccines (7%), have a medical condition which prevents them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (7%), or think COVID-19 is not that bad or that the vaccine is worse (7%)."
20409,I recommend going through the entire article as well.
20410,It has all sorts of information on people's attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines.
20411,"For example, it takes a look on how people feel after taking the vaccine."

20514,&gt; Conclusions: The mandatory mask use policy substantially increased public use of masks and was associated with a significant decline in new COVID-19 cases after introduction of the policy.
20515,This study strongly supports the use of masks for controlling epidemics in the broader community.

20546,The obvious one is anyone who is eligible for a vaccine should get it.
20547,Additional precautions like masking up and social distancing in public spaces (especially indoors) would also help.
20548,At a fundamental level - this is a battle of human psychology.
20549,"Almost everyone is exhausted, anxious, and desperate for things to return to normal."
20550,"However, the longer we delay on taking these steps to mitigate infections; the more we will see a rise in infections and the higher potential of forced rolling lockdowns."

20968,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
20969,*
20970,^ tag this guy using RES.
20971,He's oddly obsessed with politics in the US for a guy who isn't even in the US.
20972,"Want a good laugh, go to the beginning of this idiot‚Äôs post history."
20973,So wrong about everything covid and 600k dead Americans later THIS is his attitude.
20974,Absolute sociopath.
20975,Quite the contary.
20976,I go to the gym and wearing a mask is burdensome.
20977,I play indoor basketball and wearing a mask is also tiring.
20978,I like to go to entertainment places and not wearing a mask improves my comfort significantly.
20979,"I vaxxed up, and I took every precaution for the last 12 months."
20980,I'm not concerned anymore.
20981,"For kids, they're going back to school already."
20982,If they're really concerned they can stay at home and do virtual learning.
20983,There's a balance and we've reached it.
20984,"Wearing masks while vaccinated only serves to pressure the unvaxxinated to put on their masks, and they aren't going to get pressured."
20985,Despite there being a glut of vaccines.
20986,I guess incarcerated humans are throwaways in this country.
20987,Right.
20988,'Cause under 12s are being selfish.
20989,Gotcha.
20990,Except he admits to already having peripheral neuropathy.
20991,They symptoms he describes are exactly those from a health issue he already has.
20992,No you're being pedantic.
20993,I was referring to the current climate of 60k cases a day and major hotspots around the country.
20994,You're being intentionally obtuse to make a point I wasn't making.
20995,The CDC lifted the mask mandate too early.
20996,And we're reaping the rewards of that.
20997,"""we just need to require vaccines""

Once the FDA fully approves them you have a point until then requiring masks is much simpler."
20998,"If it wasn't a lab leak, is there really any way to identify it's origins?"
20999,(Genuinely asking)
21000,But I thought they were all immune and couldn‚Äôt catch it?
21001,Well according to some on here anyway
21002,"You're right, the honest reply would be ""womp womp"" sad trombone"
21003,&gt; people would lose their shit.
21004,How?
21005,"Historically, a lot of them pretty much burn through the population and die out."
21006,"A few evolve into something less dangerous (becoming endemic), and a few we‚Äôve controlled but not eliminated through vaccination (think polio, which we pretty much abolished, or measles, which is airborne and infectious at a similar level to Delta, but is rarely seen nowadays in first world countries outside of antivaxxers)."
21007,"Smallpox is about the only one we killed outright with vaccines, and that process involved literal hold-people-down forced inoculation, which, well, not exactly likely to happen nowadays."
21008,And it wouldn‚Äôt work anyway.
21009,We can‚Äôt do to coronaviruses what we did to smallpox or polio or measles.
21010,It evolves faster and is kept alive in wild animal host populations that we can‚Äôt realistically vaccinate.
21011,The goal is to get enough people some immunity either through vaccine or infection that we get to a point where people aren‚Äôt dying.
21012,We‚Äôll likely get hit with variants every few years (think a bad flu season) and we‚Äôll probably have to have periodic vaccine boosters.
21013,"It will be around, but it won‚Äôt be anywhere near as common as it currently is because nearly everyone will have some level of protection."
21014,"And yes, I think we‚Äôve done the public a disservice by not thoroughly drilling it into everyone‚Äôs heads that even mildly symptomatic infection from this virus SUCKS."
21015,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a cold or flu‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really explain that from a medical perspective, moderate illness still means pneumonia and even mild illness can still knock you on your ass for several days."
21016,You know how sometimes you get on a road and end up hitting every damn stoplight on red?
21017,That‚Äôs where we are right now.
21018,"We‚Äôre almost out of this stretch of road and onto the open highway; we can see it from here, but we‚Äôve just reached yet another light that turned red as we approached it."
21019,"Hang in there, get that second shot, and know that you‚Äôre headed towards better days."
21020,It may just take us a bit longer to get there.
21021,39% means the virus is basically immune to... at least Pfizer.
21022,And probably Moderna since they're similar enough.
21023,But yet everyone tells me if I'm vaccinated I'm fine.
21024,When did that happen?
21025,[deleted]
21026,"I'd say something about how a chicken burger doesn't sound like it'd have much taste anyway, but instead I'll say I hope you turn a corner very soon."
21027,I imagine it's frightening.
21028,Just wait until we have to start using the hurricane name list.
21029,"""Tropical storm Susan is sweeping across the south brining high winds, flooding, and a new wave of covid"""
21030,same here!
21031,it makes me feel really good about going back to the office a few times a week and grabbing lunch with my colleagues.
21032,I don‚Äôt believe calcium carbonate is removed with carbon filtration
21033,I'm getting my second shot in about two weeks.
21034,I hardly see anyone around me wearing masks.
21035,It's surreal.
21036,So now I'll have another two weeks of people looking at me like I'm a moron when I wear a mask to the store.
21037,FAAAAN-tastic.
21038,Thanks.
21039,"I mean 6 people a week in a vaccinated population of what, 5-6+ million people?"
21040,"(8 million total)  High percentages of those dying are still people that are older, too."
21041,This doesn't seem to sound nearly as alarming as a rough figure of 39% makes it sound.
21042,"If 20-50 year old vaccinated people start dying in counts of hundreds per week then we have a major problem, but I just don't see a cause for vaccinated people to panic right now."
21043,Not even top 10
21044,Your paragraph was short but very informal.
21045,Simple and to the point.
21046,Thank you
21047,"I was part of the lucky 1 in 120,000 for myocarditis from thie pfizer shot."
21048,shitty lottery to win but it is what it is.
21049,I meant ‚Äùthe risk *from* Covid‚Äù.
21050,As in the risk of serious illness/long term symptoms from getting it.
21051,Badly phrased.
21052,"I mean, their Rt over the last month has been higher than at any other point in the pandemic, so their cases are going up fast:

https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-04-09..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Reproduction+rate&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~ISR

Now, it can be a bit messy to calculate with low case levels because one outbreak can double your cases on its own when you're averaging 20 a day in a whole country, but the trend is pretty clear with their cases doubling every 10 days or so."
21053,"And of course, that's 39% efficacy against a person getting infected."
21054,"The vaccines still likely reduce spread in breakthrough infections which will reduce Rt, and that combined with their mask mandate and the fact that a portion of the unvaccinated have immunity from infections, could account for their current level of growth."
21055,No Vermont is
21056,In my county they are literally giving away monoclonal antibody treatment for free and complaining there are not enough takers!
21057,"Incidentally, it's the only treatment proven to work at preventing a mild/moderate case from becoming a severe one."
21058,it still does protect you to some extent since you wont be touching your face as much.
21059,i presume OP doesnt want to take his/her chances with delta.
21060,"personally i also wear mine whenever i'm indoors except when im with friends and family who I know are vaxxed, or i'm at work (where we were required to show our vaccine cards to HR and the handful that arent vaxxed are required by HR to wear masks)."
21061,"mainly because i have a 2 year old son that i'd rather not give covid to, so it gives me some hesitation about going 100% back to normal."
21062,Florida cases are [surging big-time.
21063,](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/florida/).
21064,"They hit 12,000+ new cases today, which is the highest daily total since February."
21065,"At this pace, they might exceed the caseload from the very first wave."
21066,Hopefully their death toll doesn‚Äôt follow.
21067,I‚Äôd be super pissed at the antivaxx crowd if I lived there.
21068,"He won't do shit though lol, he will fall in line."
21069,Just being a child about it.
21070,Problem is what happens when you have multiple divergent variants that are somewhat different than the original Wuhan / Italian strains.
21071,"I would hope a booster shot would take problematic spike mutations into consideration (L452R/Q, E484K/Q, P681R, etc.)"
21072,to help boost it further too
21073,Yeah definitely pre delta.
21074,"I don't know if they were testing asymptomatic in their original study, but in [this interview](https://youtu.be/pepCHanoMBo) from 4 months ago, Pfizer's CEO confirms a 94% efficacy of preventing asymptomatic infections, **based on yet another Israeli research**"
21075,[removed]
21076,yeah Pfizer came out a couple weeks ago sounding the alarm and the FDA and CDC told them to sit down and shut up lol
21077,What about 3 Pfizer shots?
21078,The lower half article has nothing to do with increased intubations.
21079,"upper half has no numbers, and same emotional story in other outlets about patients last horror as they die that ""it's too late to get the shot""."
21080,"Irresponsible propaganda, obviously driving the how to force more people to vaccinate disccusion here."
21081,#switchbait #politics
21082,"Yeah, incentives are something we need to look into."
21083,As much as it pains me to 'reward' lollygaggers I'm more concerned that this is dragging out far too long.
21084,Bite the bullet and offer something that gets people excited about getting their vaccinations.
21085,Sorry dude but thats how it rolls.
21086,"They have little say and for something like a vaccination that protects the whole ""hive"" they shouldn't."
21087,People are too close and this can run like wildfire through a prison.
21088,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/post-abc-poll-biden/2021/07/03/54e95b6e-db43-11eb-8fb8-aea56b785b00_story.html

This article gives the percentage of party members who said they are likely to not get vaccinated."
21089,Seconding this; my husband and I caught it back in November and the pulse oximeter was a great tool for peace of mind.
21090,"Neither of us were hit hard, but I worried less being able to verify we stayed over 90."
21091,Well worth the price even if we never use it again.
21092,Wow you got instantly downvoted !
21093,I can‚Äôt beleive how that also  prove your point :/
21094,Vaccine hesitancy.
21095,A lot of ignorant and stupid people out there that prefer to listen to some guy on YouTube than the experts.
21096,It‚Äôs absolutely shameful that we are sitting on a stockpile of vaccine that is set to expire all because demand is beginning to drop despite a large chunk of the population lacking a first dose.
21097,I wear an N95 to protect myself and others.
21098,The delta variant spreads more easily and is more aggressive.
21099,While the vaccine works there are cases of fully vaccinated people getting it.
21100,Everyone in my family is high risk so I‚Äôm not taking a chance on bringing it home to them.
21101,Once again I‚Äôve reduced my trips out to once a week.
21102,Only about 38% of my county of 40k people are vaccinated.
21103,And of the 38%?
21104,Seniors.
21105,70% of them are vaccinated.
21106,That means about 1 in 10 people are vaccinated?
21107,I suck at math.
21108,I don‚Äôt think people realize that not being vaccinated puts everyone at risk.
21109,Texas has had 9k deaths since February with only 43 deaths of those were vaccinated.
21110,That could only be the beginning of them.
21111,I was right about the risk of covid in January 2020.
21112,I don‚Äôt want to be right about the risk of this.
21113,But I didn‚Äôt want to be right 18 months ago either.
21114,Good.
21115,100% support this.
21116,You are free to make your own decision.
21117,And Santa Clause is free to not include you in any reindeer games.
21118,"Honestly, I think it‚Äôs less about the crash, because I don‚Äôt think they really rich people have money in the stock market."
21119,"Very few companies are publicly traded anymore; they owned them but I think they are realizing that they could end up losing a lot of money if they have a COVID-19 attack in their supply chain, their factory, whatever it is they‚Äôre dollars come from"
21120,"I‚Äôm really concerned that we just don‚Äôt have the data yet to accurately talk about this, but at least when it comes to PARTIAL vaccination, one dose of Moderna outperforms Pfizer in preventing hospitalization/death by nearly 20%."
21121,Unless something else is driving that difference- possible.
21122,Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization or death caused by all studied VOCs was generally higher than for symptomatic infection after partial vaccination with all three vaccines (Table 3).
21123,"In particular, against Delta, vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes after 1 dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 was 78% (95% CI, 65‚Äì86%), 96% (95% CI, 72‚Äì 99%), and 88% (95% CI, 60‚Äì96%), respectively."
21124,It would be weird to me if Moderna is this much better after one dose yet the difference disappears after two.
21125,But we‚Äôll see with way more data as we go along.
21126,Still if I were a J&amp;J person wanting a booster I‚Äôd go for Moderna.
21127,"How would they know, seeing how they've stopped collecting this data?"
21128,"[CDC: COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Case Investigation and Reporting](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html)

&gt; As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause."
21129,"It would only be exploding if they were doing wide scale testing, assuming that most vaccinated were asymptomatic they would not be going to get a test."
21130,"You could still spread it to someone you know who's unvaccinated, better to stay safe then risk someone's life."
21131,Just working with the information I have at hand
21132,"Idk, you can‚Äôt force people to stop talking about something."
21133,"You could may be start mandatory vaccination for certain things like travel, school and working in specific fields."
21134,Certain people should have never politicized it to begin with because now it‚Äôs gone too far where people may never get the vaccine because of how stubborn they are with their views.
21135,It‚Äôs hard to feel a ton of sympathy for a group that‚Äôs shooting themselves in the foot but I feel for all their families and loved ones that suffer from association.
21136,[deleted]
21137,Agreed.
21138,Pay upfront or no service.
21139,They are driving all our costs up.
21140,It should be illegal indeed.
21141,That's insane

21146,McConnell has been pretty pro-vaccine the entire time.

21148,I'm looking forward to the Whiskey variant myself
21149,Jesus...it's worse than I thought.
21150,yeah but the bad news is that would mean our elderly and vulnerable here in the US should be a bit concerned as they were getting shots in December.
21151,This explains the recent rumblings regarding the booster shots here in the US.

21157,"The ER doc told me to go home, go to bed, drink as much liquid as I could, and trade off aspirin and Tylenol on a four hour basis."

21163,Lazy man's vacc lol don't worry all the vaccines now will be useless in 1 year.
21164,The virus will mutate over and over again until we're forced to push out a vacc every 6 months.
21165,"&gt;People here want this to go on indefinitely

I mean, is it really THAT much hassle?"
21166,"If wearing a mask in social settings, getting one or two shots and getting tested is really that inconvenient, I fear society will very quickly collapse when the actual bomb drops (e.g."
21167,"deadlier virus causing pandemic, refugee crisis because of climate change etc.)"
21168,I really fail to see the issue.
21169,I currently live life very much like pre-pandemic.
21170,"Go to restaurants, meet friends."
21171,I don‚Äòt even notice the mask anymore.
21172,&gt;A mask quite frankly is unnatural.
21173,We are social animals and were born well maskless.
21174,So are glasses.
21175,And clothes.
21176,And vaccines.
21177,And surgery.
21178,And medication.
21179,And seatbelts.

It's not advocating for *actively* killing people."
21184,"It's saying, if they want to be idiots, who am I to stop them."
21185,They know what's up and do what they do anyway.
21186,Do you people actually listen to yourselves?
21187,This person is just misguided but you are actually a psycopath.
21188,But how are you going to avoid getting exposed indefinitely?
21189,"Unless you want to wear a mask for the rest of your life, you'll have to stop wearing it at some point, and COVID will be waiting for you when you do."
21190,Getting an asymptomatic or mild case is the best outcome you can hope for.
21191,The vaccine is the best we have.
21192,Masks made a lot of sense when you were delaying your exposure until after you were vaccinated.
21193,"If you're fully vaccinated or have decided to never be vaccinated, now's a good time as any to pull the bandaid off."
21194,"Nah that dude has doubled, tripled, quadrupled down lmao"
21195,‚ÄúPut the you know what in the you know where‚Äù

21199,It's still plenty politicized here...
21200,No they divided by zero
21201,I noticed mine but the fear of needles is completely unrelated to the pain.
21202,"I have no fear of the pain of needles, but I do have a fear of a metal stabby thing being inside my body."

21204,"True, but unhealthy lifestyles are spread by social vectors that are infectious to the mind."
21205,"No one is saying medical care should be denied, just that maybe the irresponsible folks should be paying for some of it."
21206,"Smokers have to pay a premium on a lot of health insurance policies, why not antivaxers?"
21207,Re: kids: low kids is not no risk.
21208,It depends on how infectious the breakthrough cases are.
21209,Like if it's 39% effective at preventing infection but vaccinated people have lower viral loads (as seems to be the case) you might see a moderate increase.
21210,Thanks!
21211,I found a Twitter thread that gave me the broad strokes but might check out the video itself too.
21212,&gt;Don‚Äôt care really.
21213,"Lol, cannot recall ever seeing such a low key ""meh"" attempt at red pilling people."
21214,Or the DeAndre Hopkins Twitter in the last hour
21215,That is also a good point.
21216,If waning immunity is playing a role in an efficacy drop this bad then Pfizer really needs to consider making their booster as strong as possible.
21217,There‚Äôs no reason a vaccine should fade away and require a booster for that reason in less than a year.
21218,You‚Äôll easily lose future willing participants that way.
21219,Most people are fine with getting a new shot every year but I don‚Äôt see many people being ecstatic about getting a new one every 6-8 Months
21220,"I can understand having guards at the doors in case people try to leave, but from what I've read they mainly seem to be bringing parcels/takeaways to the rooms."
21221,"Now they'll have to have two men at a time to chaperone each other, when they could just hire some women surely (for room service type stuff) or use the hotel's staff."
21222,I was alarmed to read that guards have keycards to all the rooms!
21223,There's just no need for that.
21224,Unfortunately not enough time or studies to confirm.
21225,"Only projections: Years to lifetime, with the caveat that the virus doesn't mutate substantially.. Well guess what it did and will continue to do so, ultimately only being as long lasting as the virus maintains its current spike protein form."

21227,We're fu*ked.
21228,[removed]
21229,I wouldn't rely on a single negative test result as evidence they didn't have it.
21230,There are countless people who test negative a few times before a positive test result.
21231,My MIL tested negative 3 times but had lingering issues and symptoms.
21232,Her 4th test showed positive.
21233,Historically it was good enough.
21234,Flu vax was 40-60%.
21235,Why is it not good enough any longer?
21236,I appreciate you doing these a little more often as the current spike has happened.
21237,It is a glimmer of hope.
21238,"Vaccines offer 80-90% protection, which is amazing."
21239,"It's not 100%, though, so case numbers matter - 90% less than a small number can be ignored, but 90% less than a huge number can still be too much."

21278,I saw a news article from Boston that they‚Äôve had over 5000 breakthrough cases.

21280,Covid is never going to be fully eradicated and even the ones who choose to be vaccinated will be unlucky and still get it.
21281,Fortunately it‚Äôs not a real threat with vaccine protection however so thankfully we can go back to life as normal in areas where vaccines are widely available.
21282,Would be nice if everyone got vaccinated though
21283,literally nobody here can tell you that.
21284,Depends how many asymptomatics are at the game and around you.
21285,"Yup, Cooper kinda ruined my day yesterday, lol."

21287,I'm trying to say a vaccinated population is insufficient to stop the spread of delta and other variants.

21289,If you're vaccinated?

21380,None of the vaccines will give you the Delta variant.

21441,"At this point I am just expecting the worst, either death or at best hospitalisation."

21447,&gt;Are the side effects bad?
21448,I am doing things pretty much all day and I am worried a sore arm would make it hard to write/type and headaches will make it unbearable to do daily activities.
21449,Are side effects that bad and how long do they last?
21450,I can only speak for myself here.
21451,"My first Pfizer shot (in March) presented the following side effects:

* Sore arm - not a normal sore arm though."
21452,My arm was super heavy and the pain woke me up at night.
21453,The arm soreness was still there the next day but it had decreased in intensity noticeably.
21454,My arm soreness was completely resolved in about 2 and a half days.
21455,* Vivid strange dreams.
21456,Like Incredibly vivid.
21457,"Second Pfizer shot:

* absolutely zero symptoms....none."
21458,"*in preparation for these doses, I took the day off following my 1st and 2nd shots."
21459,I didn't need to though.
21460,I easily could have gone into work with little to no discomfort.
21461,"*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How long is an average appointment?"
21462,"I have a pre-booked appointment at a pharmacy store location that isn't that busy, so I don't think lines would be a problem."
21463,But how long is the actual appointment time duration?
21464,* I waited behind one person.
21465,The shot itself was 1 second and painless.
21466,Waited the required 15 mins and was out the door for both jabs.
21467,&gt;I am kind of scared of needles.
21468,"Not to the point of fainting, but to the point of being hesitant and queasy when getting shots."
21469,Any tips for this?
21470,* I'm not sure I can help you here.
21471,I guess just dont look.
21472,Shots like these don't bother me.
21473,They are painless to the point where you don't even feel it.
21474,&gt;What are the perks to being vaccinated?
21475,"Obviously protection from serious COVID, reducing the chances of getting others sick, etc., but since I have no risk conditions and am young I don't think the first part applies to me (but protecting others is important though)."
21476,"In my area, masks are required indoors regardless of vaccination status, and there are no reward or incentive programs anymore from the state, but the store is giving away $10 coupons for each dose so that's something."
21477,Are there any other perks to being vaccinated that I am missing?
21478,* This is an important question.
21479,Everyone wants to know 'what's in it for me?'
21480,* No one likes getting sick.
21481,It sucks.
21482,Even a fairly mild case of this virus could lay you up for a week plus.
21483,"* If you were lucky enough to be asymptomatic, that's even scarier."
21484,Now you're carrying a viral load large enough to spread the virus without even knowing it.
21485,"You could be spreading it to someone who is not able to be vaccinated or someone who has serious comorbidities that could land them in the hospital, ICU or morgue."
21486,"* You're doing the right thing for yourself, your family and your community."
21487,* You get $10!
21488,Go get a six pack and celebrate the fact that you are a good person!
21489,* Go get it done for the people you love and the people you don't know.
21490,What about a Pfizer  and Moderna mix like most of us in Canada got?
21491,People not getting vaccine due to unknown long term effects but ignoring long term effects of covid
21492,"Vaccine immunity wouldn't need to cause a single generation or single copy of the virus to ""learn""."
21493,It's just that vaccine-resistant progeny of that generation of the virus would reproduce more effectively than vaccine-susceptible progeny when they end up in a vaccinated host.
21494,"If they end up in an unvaccinated host, the vaccine-resistance mutations probably wouldn't be beneficial."
21495,They might even be detrimental.
21496,Mask mandates suck for those who have to enforce them which are underpaid retail workers.
21497,Any masks mandates will probably be unsuccessful because cashiers and customer service people aren‚Äôt going to even try to enforce it.
21498,People who are anti-mask are awful and treat those people like shit.
21499,The point of the vaccine was to prevent serious illness and death.
21500,"Asymptomatic spread wasn't even studied in the trials, it was just a bonus."
21501,I assume you do pay more for insurance if you are any of those?
21502,Maybe they will do similar and just charge more if you are not vaccinated.

21505,"Hey, let's hope for the best."
21506,Does not excuse not getting vaccinated.

21509,"Yeah, I don't fully agree."
21510,"If a large number of people are ending up in hospitals, it isn't going to be over."
21511,"Interesting, mine was not what I‚Äôd say mild but I didn‚Äôt go to hospital or anything."
21512,I always took the flu vac but after having flu I‚Äôd get it twice if I could!
21513,I don‚Äôt think the US health care system can handle that option with this variant.
21514,"Next paragraph:

But Dr. Zucker testified to lawmakers in early August that the department was still auditing the numbers and could not release them."
21515,"State Senator Gustavo Rivera, the chair of the health committee, suggested during the hearing that the data was being withheld to improve the governor‚Äôs image."
21516,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a problem, bro,‚Äù Mr. Rivera told Dr. Zucker."
21517,"‚ÄúIt seems, sir, that, in this case, you are choosing to define it differently so that you can look better.‚Äù

I guess no minds are being changed here."
21518,Shouldn't we not use words like intubated?
21519,I mean we're trying to convey information to people in Alabama right?
21520,The level at which children have been affected by the virus isn't high enough to convince COVID deniers---not worldwide and definitely not in the US.
21521,"The fact that children's hospitals have not had any major outbreaks is nothing short of a miracle and I don't want a bunch of kids at say, St. Jude, dying just to serve as a moral lesson to some anti-vaxx creeps."
21522,I think they suggest monoclonal antibody treatments for people with comorbidities but you have to get them in you pretty early in the process.
21523,Certain corticosteroid treatments seem to help also keep people off the vents.
21524,"As far as I know, vents are the last step of remediation."
21525,I don't have a problem with vaccine mandates after the vaccines have full FDA approval.
21526,I'm not sure what your point is here.
21527,"ACA only allows for 4 conditions for determining premium cost: age, location, family size, and smoking."
21528,So it would take new legislation to add vaccination status to be treated like smoking (which is typically a +50% increase in premiums).
21529,"Alternatively, they can just use location."
21530,We all know the areas where people are unvaccinated.
21531,Can you give a quick synopsis?
21532,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt care‚Äù

That is one of the biggest problems dealing with this pandemic."
21533,People dont see beyond themselves and wonder why Covid is still rampaging.
21534,"‚ÄúI dont tell people how to live their lives‚Äù

If only consequences stayed to the individuals making the decisions."
21535,I don‚Äôt believe you
21536,Because it keeps you out of the hospital.
21537,Right now almost all of the hospitalizations are unvaccinated people.
21538,Herd immunity is only a concept within the context of vaccination.
21539,"""Natural"" herd immunity isn't really a thing, but plenty of armchair virologists on reddit seem to think they know what they're talking about."
21540,It‚Äôs good she‚Äôs still taking some precautions.

21555,It is related to an ongoing research project tracking the public's attitudes and experiences with COVID-19 vaccinations.
21556,"The article has a section ""Why Some Adults Remain Unvaccinated""."
21557,"Quoting from that section:

&gt; When those who remain unvaccinated were asked about their main reason for not getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the most commonly offered reasons are around concerns about side effects (21%), followed by concerns that the vaccine was too new, too unknown, or not tested enough (16%)."
21558,One in ten (12%) offer they haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated because they don‚Äôt think they need the vaccine.
21559,"Smaller, but still significant shares, say they haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated because they just want to wait and see (7%), they don‚Äôt trust the vaccine and don‚Äôt normally get vaccines (7%), have a medical condition which prevents them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (7%), or think COVID-19 is not that bad or that the vaccine is worse (7%)."
21560,I recommend going through the entire article as well.
21561,It has all sorts of information on people's attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines.
21562,"For example, it takes a look on how people feel after taking the vaccine."
21563,"Did you have strong response (fever, fatigue, etc) to one or both of your vaccine doses?"
21564,Encourage vaccinations as much as possible.
21565,That‚Äôs all.
21566,Thanks!
21567,I'd like to think so too :)
21568,I‚Äôm just waiting for FDA approval.
21569,Wow
21570,"Just curious, what are your symptoms?"
21571,Are you struggling right now?
21572,"If one death is enough, then why are you not against the vaccine, which has led to deaths and multiple injuries to children?"
21573,U wot?

21612,I haven't seen enough data on it to say anything like this so confidently.
21613,"It's inferred from the CDC not changing their guidelines and what the experts have kept repeating for the last few weeks on tv, news articles, etc."
21614,"Depending who you ask/which hospital 97-99% of hospitalizations are now the unvaccinated, likewise those 3-1% of vaccinated folks who do go to the hospital are statistically less likely to have a severe case and die compared to that 97-99% group."

21622,"PASADENA, Calif. ‚Äî Los Angeles County‚Äôs new mask mandate is infuriating officials in the sprawling region, leading to angry denunciations as some irate local leaders demand resignations and threaten to cut ties and form their own public health departments."
21623,"‚ÄúThe county cannot handle our current situation,‚Äù said Councilman Tony Wu of West Covina, a town of about 110,000 in the eastern part of the county."
21624,"‚ÄúWe are absolutely not going to enforce nothing about this BS.‚Äù

The municipal mess reflects the growing national tension over how to respond to the coronavirus‚Äôs new delta variant, which has led to a sizable rebound in cases and caught many government officials and business leaders by surprise."
21625,It is reviving tensions about vaccination levels and mask rules at a moment when many Americans had thought the virus was behind them.
21626,"This particular uproar underscores the volatile politics around the pandemic even in liberal Southern California, where patience has worn out in some quarters with new demands from health officials."
21627,"Barely a month after state officials lifted nearly all pandemic restrictions ‚Äî and even as the White House continues to insist that vaccinated people need not wear masks ‚Äî the nation‚Äôs largest county clamped back down this past weekend, announcing a new requirement for everyone to wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status."
21628,"Online activism is spilling into the streets of Southern California, sparking a post-Trump movement

The backlash was immediate."
21629,"While dominated by the city of Los Angeles itself, L.A. County is home to around 10 million residents spread across 88 distinct cities separated by hundreds of miles."
21630,"And in some of these places, local officials have had it."
21631,‚ÄúWe have had enough of these policies!
21632,"We demand that you stop this one-size-fits-all approach to health and health outcomes,‚Äù elected officials from a half-dozen towns including El Segundo, Torrance and Manhattan Beach wrote this week in a letter to their local county supervisor."
21633,"‚ÄúWe implore you to modify this recent order, engage with us, and set a policy that better reflects the unique context of our area.‚Äù

Torrance and West Covina ‚Äî and even tony Beverly Hills ‚Äî are among the cities that have either launched or are exploring efforts to break away and set up their own health departments that would not be beholden to the county‚Äôs dictates."
21634,"No such effort has been attempted in decades, as far as the officials involved are aware, but they are pushing ahead, setting up talks with county and state officials and directing their city attorneys to examine how to move forward."
21635,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been advocating for Torrance to detach from L.A. County‚Äôs health department for months now,‚Äù said Torrance City Council member Aurelio Mattucci."
21636,"‚ÄúThis latest mask mandate is really going to have a terrible effect on businesses, it‚Äôs really going to instill more fear in shoppers and patrons and that‚Äôs where I think we need to draw the line.‚Äù

Mask mandates make a return - along with controversy

Beverly Hills Mayor Robert Wunderlich said he viewed the county‚Äôs new mask mandate as ‚Äújustifiable‚Äù given rising cases, but asked, ‚ÄúDid they pick the optimal way?"
21637,"I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù

His city is in the process of enlisting an expert to help officials understand what setting up a public health department of their own would entail."
21638,"The argument for doing so, Wunderlich said, would be ‚Äúto have things in our own hands, for us to be in the position to be decision-makers about requirements and rules.‚Äù

In announcing the new mask mandate, the county pointed to a sevenfold increase in new cases since the state reopened June 15, driven by the highly transmissible delta variant."
21639,"In a written response to questions, the L.A. County health department‚Äôs communications office defended the department‚Äôs move and suggested it would be unwise for cities to try to create their own health departments."
21640,The agency did not directly respond to calls for the head of the health department to step down.
21641,"‚ÄúCities can only establish their own health departments with state approval and demonstrated capacity to perform essential public health functions,‚Äù the county health department said."
21642,"‚ÄúGiven the alarming increase in cases and hospitalizations across the county and the increasing circulation of the more infectious delta variant, we urge city managers and elected officials to support this sensible public health measure as this is a relatively non-disruptive action that can help slow the spread of the virus."
21643,"At this point, working together is the most sensible path forward.‚Äù

But some local business leaders questioned how a mask mandate imposed by L.A. County would do anything but create chaos and confusion, especially since residents in some areas of the county could drive a block and go shopping or out to eat in places like Orange County or Ventura County, which have imposed no new mandates."
21644,"Health: You got a coronavirus vaccine, but you still became infected."
21645,How did that happen?
21646,"‚ÄúWe really want L.A. County to remain aligned with the state because it does create confusion,‚Äù said Nancy Hoffman Vanyek, president and chief executive at the Greater San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce."
21647,"‚ÄúYou could literally go into a neighboring area and it could possibly have a different set of restrictions.‚Äù

Vanyek and other critics of the county‚Äôs move questioned whether it would end up being just a first step back toward the kinds of capacity restrictions or even outright closures that hammered businesses in the early weeks and months of the pandemic."
21648,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the big concern,‚Äù she said."
21649,Supporters of L.A. County‚Äôs move say it‚Äôs just the opposite ‚Äî an effort to ensure that case rates don‚Äôt get so high that the county does have to look at going back into lockdown.
21650,"That includes Ying-Ying Goh, head of the public health department in Pasadena which ‚Äî along with Long Beach ‚Äî is one of two cities in the county that already has its own public health department."
21651,"Although Pasadena is not bound by what L.A. County does, it is imposing a mask mandate similar to the one that already took effect elsewhere in the county."
21652,"Despite very high vaccination rates in Pasadena, cases there have increased 240 percent since July 1, Goh said."
21653,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that public health is going back and forth with this restriction and that restriction, it‚Äôs because we are in a different situation‚Äù with the delta variant, Goh said."
21654,"She asked the public for patience but also to ‚Äúunderstand how we are trying to keep our economy open with just a small restriction.‚Äù

And even though Pasadena has its own health department, Goh questioned the ability of other cities to follow suit."
21655,"In Pasadena, the health department is 129 years old and predates the county health agency."
21656,"Public health departments are responsible for much more than making decisions about what kinds of coronavirus restrictions businesses have to follow, Goh noted, which is the issue that seems to animate officials in other cities that are exploring the move."
21657,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much more than permitting restaurants,‚Äù she said."
21658,"In some ways the debate over cities trying to create their own health departments resonates with other secession efforts that have rocked California over the years, including arguments over whether the San Fernando Valley should secede from the rest of Los Angeles, or whether the state should break itself up into two or even three pieces."
21659,Supporters argue that far-flung cities with lower infection rates shouldn‚Äôt be bound by one-size-fits-all rules handed down by the county.
21660,"But if the point is to create more certainty for businesses and residents, the result might be to produce even less, since the outcome could be a haphazard patchwork of different rules and regulations across Southern California, opponents say."
21661,"‚ÄúBreaking away won‚Äôt be a solution to things like this ‚Äî it further fragments the approach to ensuring we have healthy communities,‚Äù said Maria S. Salinas, head of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce."
21662,"Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who represents Torrance, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach and other aggrieved municipalities, said she would prefer to see the county act in concert with the rest of California, ‚Äúbut in this instance they just felt like the cases in L.A. County were increasing so rapidly that they just couldn‚Äôt wait.‚Äù Cases have been surging elsewhere in California, too, and other counties have also begun recommending indoor mask-wearing, but Los Angeles County is the only one so far to impose a new mandate."
21663,"As far as cities trying to stand up their own health departments, ‚ÄúI do believe most people will probably not take that across the finish line,‚Äù Hahn said."
21664,"She added, however, that she herself is the target of a recall effort over her response to the pandemic."
21665,"If you listen to the TWiV (this week in virology) podcast, something Dr. Griffin always says that I think makes perfect sense is: low risk does not mean no risk."
21666,So act accordingly.
21667,"If your husband takes precautions like masking indoors, it‚Äôll be less likely he will be exposed to a large viral dose."
21668,If he does get infected the vaccine should make it very unlikely he gets seriously ill.
21669,"If he has a breakthrough, then mask and/or isolation will limit risk, etc."
21670,"If he needs to be out there nothing to be done about that, so it‚Äôs just risk mitigation."
21671,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being paranoid, I think you‚Äôre being prudent."
21672,Feeling disappointed is fine.
21673,"Life sucks sometimes, and I‚Äôm sorry to say it doesn‚Äôt get any easier on that score once you‚Äôre an adult."
21674,"That said, try to remember that this virus is new, that science doesn‚Äôt always mean we come up with the right answers the first time, and that for a lot of people, protecting those under 18 is literally the most important priority."
21675,Are they being overcautious treating vaxxed high schoolers like unable to be vaxxed elementary students?
21676,Maybe‚Ä¶jury‚Äôs out still in my eyes because Delta is so much more contagious and we don‚Äôt have good data yet on whether or not it‚Äôs more severe.
21677,"We also have very little data yet on long covid after vaccination, and as someone who has similar disabling symptoms from autoimmune issues, I *really* hate to see kids coming down with that, especially so young."
21678,"The best virologists and epidemiologists in the country are still somewhat divided on whether or not going unmasked after vaccination makes sense, but more of them are on the pro-mask side."
21679,Asking all kids to stay masked shouldn‚Äôt be surprising when you look at the bigger picture.
21680,We‚Äôre taking part (unwillingly) in two of the biggest experiments humankind has ever seen with this pandemic and climate change.

22186,We shouldn't leave it up to the market and we shouldn't allow mass-congregation of unvaccinated people.

22201,"‚ÄúWell, I still don‚Äôt think COVID is dangerous, but I really want to do X, so I went ahead and got the vaccine.‚Äù

I‚Äôve also heard that some people are hesitant because they fear to miss work due to side effects."
22202,Businesses or the government could step up to offer support in such cases.
22203,I feel like offering a few hundred dollars in case you have lost wages plus a FMLA-style guarantee that you can‚Äôt have adverse employment consequences if you take off for side effects would help.
22204,The latter is really simple; I believe the odds are that almost everyone who is vaccinated would miss 0-2 days of work.
22205,But it would help assuage the fear at practically no cost.

22222,"In order to be contagious, the virus has to be replicating in your body so much that you start to shed it (spewing it out of your nose and mouth)."
22223,"If your immune system is tuned to the virus, either through prior exposure or vaccine exposure, it can eliminate the virus before it has a chance to replicate enough for you to start shedding."
22224,Of course there are many factors that play into this.
22225,If your immune response isn‚Äôt sufficiently robust the virus may have the opportunity to replicate enough for you to shed some viral particles.
22226,"Because the delta variant of this virus is more infectious it takes fewer particles for someone to become infected, so a small window of shedding that wouldn‚Äôt be enough to infect someone with the original strain may be enough to infect someone now."

22306,The unvaccinated should not even be admitted and told to stay home.
22307,"There's an 88% chance you have no symptoms at all, therefore no spread (assuming mRNA)."
22308,Unless you're going for covid zero which is a laughable goal (see Austrailia and NZ) we shouldn't have any sort of restrictions on normal life for that remaining 12% chance.
22309,Especially because it's so incredibly unlikely you would ever give it to another vaccinated person.
22310,And if you did they would be absolutely fine except for some sniffles.
22311,This is all for vaccinated people.

22318,"Yeah, the internet is not representative of reality."
22319,"I'm assuming that in the place you live, masks were either reimplemented or never lifted to begin with, since you said you had to wear them to the gym and so on."
22320,Making a vaccine mandatory requires a certain amount of political will.

22330,This.
22331,"If a mask mandate or something comes back, it better come with a vaccine mandate."
22332,I don‚Äôt want to get into a cycle of mask mandates and cases rising and falling if we‚Äôre still going to have a population of unvaccinated by choice people with no natural immunity who will be susceptible to Covid which isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon.
22333,"My quality of life has noticeably approved since my highly vaccinated state dropped mask, and while I was glad to wear them in 2020, I certainly won‚Äôt be happy to wear one in 2021 because other people didn‚Äôt get vaccines like they were supposed to."
22334,"Basically, the government better find a way to mandate vaccines."
22335,"If you don't mind me asking, how long after the 2nd does were you infected?"
22336,Do you know where / when you were infected before you started showing symptoms?
22337,This looks like waning immunity as Israelis were first vaccinated in Dec and January.
22338,Have to admire someone that stands by their guns.
22339,It definitely can.
22340,UK is pretty far along in their Delta surge and hospitalizations are nowhere near previous waves.
22341,"CDC reported Florida number for today it's 12,647 new cases which is an increased of 3,659 from yesterday's report which was 8,988."
22342,"In the last 6 days Florida has been reported 54,157 new cases according to CDC

22344,I got my J&amp;J in early March and regret not waiting for Pfizer.
22345,Just had a friend who also got J&amp;J be hospitalized with Covid this week.
22346,I called several pharmacies and they all tell me that they follow CDC guidelines and don't allow mixing vaccines or giving Pfizer after J&amp;J. I don't feel comfortable going in and lying about having had a shot already.
22347,Canada and other countries are telling their citizens to get an mRNA shot after a AstraZeneca or J&amp;J. I wish that CDC would update their guidelines.

22355,"And yeah, you might not know but hey - it doesn't hurt to ask."
22356,My guess is that the mild infection in vaccinated cases is the time it takes for bone marrow vaccine response to kick in after circulating antibodies have diminished?
22357,I discussed this in another thread and somebody said that insurance could not deny coverage to vaccine refusers under the affordable care act.
22358,Not sure how the legalese works but maybe that will come up to Congress eventually.

22364,Why would you wear a mask if you're vaccinated?
22365,"It only helps protect others from you, not you from others."
22366,Exactly.
22367,There is an obviously huge overlap between antivaxers and antimaskers.
22368,A lot of people were only getting the vaccine so they didn't have to wear the mask.
22369,"Then they tell people, if your vaccinated you don't need to, even though we aren't at our target goal yet, and we won't enforce anything so unvaccinated people said, whatever, and did neither."
22370,"Now you have genius Governors and School Boards sending 25-35  unvaccinated kids into a classroom that is in a school with hundreds or thousands of unvaccinated people, without a mask requirement."

They found 1000x viral load though, which might explain some of the increase in hospitalization and death rate (some studies found around 2x for those)

22492,7 weeks now
22493,The relative risks of each age group haven‚Äôt changed.
22494,"Holding vaccination status constant, the older you are the more at risk of negative outcomes you are (the exception being newborns and infants who are at slightly higher risk than older children)."
22495,What has changed is vaccination coverage is much better in the elderly than in the young (and of course is close to zero in under 12s) so more cases are appearing in unvaccinated younger people relative to the more vaccinated older population and some unlucky individuals have very serious disease courses.
22496,"From the link you posted,  
""**EFFICACY**  

The first primary end point was the efficacy of BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in participants who had been without serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after the second dose; the second primary end point was efficacy in participants with and participants without evidence of prior infection."
22497,"***Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification‚Äìbased testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test)***""."

22510,"For example, [this one](https://mrmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-6958-9-57) is about respiratory viruses in general, including coronaviruses."
22511,"[Here's one](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388645v1) specifically about the new coronavirus, and [here's a really promising clinical trial](https://www.marinomed.com/en/news/marinomed-biotech-ag-shares-positive-clinical-trial-results-for-iota-carrageenan-nasal-spray-in-the-prevention-of-covid-19-1) that suggests 80% protection, although with a high margin of error."
22512,"Masks also work, but I don't think the evidence for the effectiveness of cloth/non-medical masks is any better than the evidence for nasal sprays."
22513,"Honestly, if you just stop giving a fuck and go back to normal there's a 99.9% chance you'll be fine."
22514,‚ÄúCan do!‚Äù - COVID
22515,"This is how every single person I know sees it as well, thank God."
22516,Then you come on reddit and you'd think everyone in the country is scared to fucking death or something.

22526,"In concert with vaccinations, it seems at some point we won‚Äôt have to be slaves to its dominance as a global health threat‚Äîat least at the level we are now."
22527,"NFL is a billionaire dollar industry, they're not gonna let personal opinion fuck with their profits."
22528,Why would you wear a mask if you‚Äôre vaccinated?
22529,That‚Äôs so dumb.
22530,It's not obvious that the virus would have higher viral load.
22531,"The virus could have spread faster because it could survive longer in the air, it could make people cough more, it could exist inside people's body for longer without presenting symptoms, etc."
22532,Heightened viral load is what seems to be the actual answer though instead.
22533,"&gt; Unvaccinated individuals should be wearing a mask period

I would assume they're making a comeback because unvaccinated people aren't wearing a mask, and we don't have any kind of vaccine passport system in place for businesses to verify who's vaccinated and who isn't."

22545,"The proposal is to treat covid like any other medical expense, not create a slippery slope."
22546,"Now, my proposal does have quite the attack on lower income groups because it says for medicare/caid to treat covid differently by not covering unless vaccinated, but this is not really an evil insurance company thing."
22547,"As far as slippery slopes go, it would not be surprising at all for lack of vaccine to give higher insurance prices (like smoking) once vaccines are fully approved."
22548,I could feel mine.
22549,The second hurt a little more than the first.
22550,But my mom was joking with me that I must have got a placebo after my second shot because I had pretty much no serious adverse reactions where as everyone else in the family (minus my 94 year old gran) was just wiped out after theirs.
22551,I did get a golf ball sized lump a few days after the shot (totally normal and it didn't hurt) and it was just a little tender when touched and went away after a couple more days.
22552,"Not to minimize the point (which I read as ‚Äúwe should take Delta seriously‚Äù), but hospital capacity doesn‚Äôt start from zero."
22553,They‚Äôre usually pretty full.
22554,Are there other reasons the non-COVID baseline could be higher this time (such as pent-up demand)?
22555,Most people in the south can‚Äôt.

22589,"yes, THIS."
22590,We have no idea if breakthrough cases can lead to long covid.
22591,I was listening to an interview with founders of a support group for long covid and they had a mild case of Covid that resolved quickly.
22592,The problems started several weeks after.
22593,So the fact that the vaccine prevents serious cases is not necessarily that reassuring.

22686,This is what I think is going to spark the surge in cases.
22687,I know more people in the past week who are all vaccinated that have COVID than I did none vaccinated people last year.
22688,"Obviously could just be a lottery fallacy and my experience is just extremely rare, but seems odd."
22689,"Not saying they don‚Äôt, but you‚Äôre flippantly disregarding human life."
22690,Each and every number you see if a person.
22691,You‚Äôre advocating more infection in the community which equals more death.
22692,This is a bad take dude.
22693,And don‚Äôt forget the crippling medical debt!
22694,So true.
22695,I‚Äôm still wearing my mask when I go to the supermarkets etc.
22696,I don‚Äôt give a ** what people think there.
22697,"So, a couple of things here."
22698,"&gt; however we do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine

This illustrates a lack of understanding of what the vaccine is and how it interacts with your body\[1]."
22699,mRNA is a well-understood biological construct that we have worked with for decades.
22700,"All that the vaccine really is, is strands of mRNA encased in a fatty sac to prevent the mRNA from being denatured before it is delivered into your cells."
22701,"The mRNA then teaches your cells how to create the spike protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to attack your cells, which triggers an immune response."
22702,Your body then remembers how to identify the foreign protein in the future so that it can neutralize it before you get a full-blown infection.
22703,"After the mRNA is used by your cells, it is broken down and disposed of in the same way that your cells breakdown the mRNA that they produce naturally."
22704,All traces of the vaccine are are flushed from your body within days of receiving your shot.
22705,&gt;  seems silly to put young healthy people at risk for vaccine damages.
22706,"there is always the risk of long covid, that is a risk you have to weigh

The long term risks of a COVID infection are much greater than that of vaccination."
22707,"Also, by not getting vaccinated you risk spreading the disease to loved ones unwittingly and risk being the petri dish for a more virulent and deadly version of the virus."
22708,Get vaccinated.
22709,\[1]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html
22710,"&gt; A vaccine doesn't mean you don't get infected

It means the danger of infection is small enough to be negligible."
22711,You're spreading misinformation by inferring otherwise.
22712,If you can't accept that the risk of vaccinated people not wearing masks is minimal enough than you'll never accept any risk level above literal 0% which will never happen.
22713,"In my area our rate of infection is so low, that if applied nation wide we'd have around only 3000 deaths a year in the entirety of the United States."
22714,And that's still not enough for some people.
22715,It never will be.
22716,You don't want it to be over
22717,"The Israel data is literally not a study, it is not published anywhere."
22718,It is a bunch of slides in a government presentation.
22719,I don't think they've examined their methodology or showed their data.
22720,Thank you!
22721,Oh for sure.
22722,I had a family member come down here for business from up north and they all bullied him for wearing a mask.
22723,Mind you these people were in their 40s 50s.
22724,Its sad.
22725,They even raided that lady's house.
22726,"Oh for sure, but he died directly from Covid."
22727,"NTA, he put everyone around him at risk and effectively dug his own grave."
22728,"He deserves pity at most, not sympathy."
22729,Dangerous idiots should be scorned.
22730,Masks work both ways if used correctly.
22731,former coworker had a friend making fun of the virus up until he was put on a ventilator.
22732,Pretty much.
22733,"39% is not effective at all, they would be in a completely out of control situation if this was the case."
22734,[deleted]
22735,"Why is it so hard for the US to just mandate vaccines for all who are eligible, barring religious or medical reasons?"
22736,Did they carry the 1?
22737,I have a breakthrough case.
22738,"I was fully vaccinated with pfizer in April, and right now I have the symptoms of an extremely mild cold."
22739,"Somewhat sore throat, achy, lots of fatigue, sneezing, mild cough."
22740,I guess this is still the vaccine working but it still feels pretty weird and unexpected!
22741,I'm trying not to let this shake my confidence in things and I know the data is there but it does feel really unsettling.
22742,"It's this, 100%."
22743,The outbreaks aren't happening in areas where it hurts the other side.
22744,"I'm guessing in a toss-up state like FL, if a significant portion of his supporters get sick and/or die, it could flip elections."
22745,So many variants we went through the entire Greek alphabet and had to start using the US Military Phonetic alphabet.
22746,Amen to that lol
22747,DemonSantis really trying to kill his state
22748,This.
22749,"If we were able to independently review what they've done as far as analysis goes, then maybe this was worth looking into."
22750,"But given that their data doesn't fit with a single other study, and that we have no idea how they arrived at their conclusions, means that I'm not inclined to believe them at this stage."
22751,From what I heard hospitalization are still down even though cases are up
22752,"Yeah, I mean I know many protestors wore masks, but considering that masks aren't as effective as social distancing it was annoying for see no one report on it."
22753,There's no way you can get me to believe that when covid was running rampant that there was no increase in case rates when large groups of people got together in every major city across the US and also in many other cities in the world.
22754,Masked or not.
22755,"If so, then that doesn't align with social distancing and the reason we shut the country down in the first place."
22756,"All in all good news, I'd say."
22757,Glad you're feeling better!
22758,Thank God the mutations are tailored to make the virus more infectious and not more lethal.
22759,Imagine the chaos that would ensue...
22760,I‚Äôm assuming the initial 94% metric was made Pre-Delta?
22761,"If so, were they testing asymptomatic vaccinated people at the time?"
22762,"All those countries vaccinated more recently though, so antibodies are likely higher."
22763,And Canada and the UK used longer 8-12 week intervals which also likely produces a better immune response.
22764,"Based on this article, Israel is saying that efficacy varied dramatically depending on when the person was vaccinated, which would tend to point towards waning immunity:

&gt;The figures also show that among those who were vaccinated in January, there was only a 16% effectiveness against being infected, compared to 44% of those vaccinated in February, 67% of those who received their shots in March, and 75% for those vaccinated in April."
22765,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/health-ministry-says-covid-vaccine-is-only-40-effective-at-halting-transmission/

The good news is, the protection against hospitalization still remained fairly robust, at 88%, with little drop off in the people vaccinated in January (it was about 86% for them)."
22766,some of us have jobs.
22767,enjoy the ubi i pay for
22768,&gt; This is the highest 7 day avg since 7/7.
22769,Nice to see the rate going up.
22770,I think lots of the still unvaccinated have thought they could just coast by on the backs of us vaccinated all the way to Covid zero.
22771,"Delta variant came along and have pretty much destroyed that idea, getting infected seems unavoidable now."
22772,Especially if you are going to try and live a normal life.
22773,Also looking at a minimum of 70% vaccinated to even touch the transmission rate
22774,So here‚Äôs my question with all of this Israel data stuff‚Ä¶ how many of these breakthrough infections are asymptomatic?
22775,I saw another study that said the Pfizer vaccines are 88% effective against symptomatic delta variant infections.
22776,"I‚Äôm no scientist, but when you have the vaccine it doesn‚Äôt put up some magical force field that repels the virus, it simply means your body has the immune response ready to attack and reduce the viral load when you get infected, reducing the severity and the chance you can spread it to others because the viral load is less."
22777,"If they‚Äôre including asymptomatic cases, wouldn‚Äôt it be fair to assume that it‚Äôs close to irrelevant because even if you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre still going to ‚Äúhave the virus‚Äù for even a brief period of time?"
22778,"If that‚Äôs the case then who really cares, you won‚Äôt get sick and you won‚Äôt go to the hospital and the viral load will likely be reduced to nothing in a shorter period of time than unvaccinated people."
22779,Headlines like these cause such ridiculous panic‚Ä¶ I want to see the methodology otherwise it just reeks of Pfizer wanting to push the data in the way that encourages the world to buy another round of their booster shot.
22780,Aren‚Äôt they named after the Greek alphabet?
22781,Not the phonetic alphabet.
22782,"Or we can just learn to live with a certain number of (mostly unvaccinated) people dying each year, just as we do with the heart disease and diabetes epidemic, which is largely a preventable set of diseases."
22783,Are we shutting down McDonalds or demanding healthier food for the public good?
22784,"No, we're not, because we accept this grim reality and just deal with the consequences in service to corporate profit and unhealthy lifestyles."
22785,Covid will just have to be integrated into this sub-optiomal condition.
22786,"It sucks for the immunocompromised, elderly, and obese/unhealthy population, but such is life, it's not fair."
22787,Shhh.
22788,We don‚Äôt use common sense here.

22799,I just ask that you also don't judge me as a vaccinated person for not doing so.
22800,This is where so much of the confusion is coming from.
22801,"They say ""effective"" in the headline but then bury what ""effective"" means in the article which 90% of people aren't going to read anyway."
22802,"I really want to know more about sinovac too, my country has mostly used that one :/"
22803,They are messing up somewhere.
22804,"For Zen 4 architecture microchips :D

Being public person and all, it's really hard for them to take vaccine now when they rejected it for so long."

22810,Tax credits.
22811,You got a shot?
22812,Take 10k off your taxes.
22813,Find the right number and you'll get the jabs.
22814,The CDC are the ones who announced all vaccinated people to be able to go maskless prompting nearly every state to immediately follow the CDC guidelines.
22815,Did they actually think that the honor system was going to work with unvaccinated people continuing to wear masks as required.
22816,The minute my state followed suit with the CDC recommendations almost everyone went maskless.
22817,Now we have another wave of illness and a more dangerous one at that.
22818,The horse has left the barn.
22819,It going to be pretty hard to get people back to masking again.
22820,It looks like the CDC don‚Äôt want to back peddle and officially recommend masks again.
22821,Florida has a decent vaccination rate though.
22822,It‚Äôs the same as the national average
22823,Yea hopefully Florida will going back to they way they were reporting their data.
22824,This is slightly more egregious as instead of having purposely inaccurate data there will be no data.
22825,That‚Äôs why I said when it gets full approval.
22826,But if you want people to get the vaccine maybe don‚Äôt act like such an asshole to people who want to wait for approval.
22827,"If you want there to be hesitancy, keep telling people you hope it‚Äôs forced upon them."
22828,It‚Äôs a winning strategy for sure.
22829,lol no1curr.
22830,Are the anti-COVID vaccinators also owners of un-vaccinated cats and dogs?
22831,Or do they get shots for their pets and refuse shots for themselves?
22832,"But would asymptomatic suggest a lower viral load, regardless of variant?"
22833,We need mandatory vaccination policies in as many places as possible.
22834,"Employers, flying, going to school, etc."
22835,It's the only thing we can do to combat the effects of the misinformation.

22870,&gt; and now Desantis.
22871,He was never against vaccinations as far as I could tell.

22874,"They finally realized what's been pretty obvious, that COVID19 is now killing mainly people who haven't been vaccinated, which at this point are the 30%-40% of the population that make up their voting base."
22875,"Most left and moderate voters have gotten vaccinated, it's just their base holding out now."
22876,"With both House and Senate control up for grabs in 2022, they can't afford to lose voters, either to death or disillusionment."
22877,So now they have to make a major mea-culpa and do a 180 on their vaccine and COVID skepticism.
22878,Who's going back to masking?
22879,Some will only question how healthy these young people were in the first place.
22880,"Wow, thanks, didn't know that."
22881,"I don't mean to sound harsh (truly) but your friends believe in Q-Anon conspiracies and let those delusions influence life-or-death decisions (i.e., getting a life saving vaccine)."
22882,You are downplaying the influence of Q-Anon here and that is dangerous because Q-Anon is dangerous and should not be normalized.
22883,I hate wearing masks.
22884,"I wore KN95s 8 hours a day at work for a year and despite what people say on here, it‚Äôs very uncomfortable."
22885,Being at the gym with a mask is also horrible.
22886,"It‚Äôs very hard to understand what others are saying when masked and social aspects are gone, you can‚Äôt do mimics and interactions feel colder to me."
22887,I obviously didn‚Äôt whine about it to anyone and wore it for so long.
22888,I personally would take the risk of a breakthrough case if it means going maskless at a gym or a night out or special event with friends.
22889,"I‚Äôm young, don‚Äôt have children, and the risk-benefit of a cold vs enjoying my youth and wanting to work out at a gym to become more fit is set in my head, but that‚Äôs just me."
22890,"Unless you are wearing something good like a well fitted KN95, your mask won‚Äôt protect you anyways, especially with Delta."
22891,"I'd then do something like the cruise ships like ""tuition for unvaccinated students:  1 million dollars"""
22892,Oh you're in the navy?
22893,Good fucking luck refusing it because the second it gets FDA approval all branches of the military will mandate that shit.
22894,Your body belongs to the state now you don't get a say lmao.
22895,Also continuing to refuse it past your arbitrary demands of approval being met is just childish.
22896,Try telling that to your commander lmao.
22897,THIS!
22898,ABSOLUTELY THIS!!
22899,I have been having similar thoughts.
22900,I picture some who had had COVID-19 AFTER the vaccines were released and the insurance companies will have something SIMILAR to the ‚Äòpre-existing‚Äô clause‚Äô deny coverage or increase your rates!
22901,Plus a patient can‚Äôt hide it from their medical record.
22902,Solid upvote to you!
22903,I don't think it's killing enough to make a difference in elections and they certainly don't care about their voters outside of that.
22904,Yup.

22920,"But I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll convince everyone to take it, even when it‚Äôs FDA approved, proven to be safe, etc."

22989,Keep in mind we are chugging along in the US at half a million per day.
22990,That's not a huge number but it's steady.
22991,Thank you!
22992,"Oh so every insurance company allocated $ to the pandemic flat out, regardless of their clients in hospital or not?"
22993,I see.
22994,So going forward maybe insurances just cover their clients and back to regular ?
22995,I know my insurance company waived my copay for my weekly therapist because it was in pandemic.
22996,The point of the vaccine was to prevent serious illness and death.
22997,"Asymptomatic spread wasn't even studied in the trials, it was just a bonus."
22998,My friend works at Google in California.
22999,I figured she would have an amazing health care plan because of who her employer is but she still has to pay $50 every time she or her kids goes to the family doctor.
23000,"&gt; vaccines that have defeated diseases don't fully block transmission

Right, but there's other ways to 'defeat' a disease outside of herd immunity."
23001,'Herd immunity is only relevant if we have a transmission-blocking vaccine.'
23002,"- you're saying that if tomorrow we find out that the current COVID vaccines only reduce transmission rates by 45%, those would still be considered ""transmission-blocking vaccines""?"
23003,I don't believe that's a proper interpretation of the message that mathematical biologist was trying to convey.
23004,And that's not even mentioning all of the other points that the article raised.
23005,"So either way, herd immunity isn't realistic."
23006,"I'd also be cautious in comparing COVID to other diseases that have been ""defeated"" in the past."
23007,"Unless you want to suggest specific examples that we can directly compare, it's a pretty apples-oranges statement to make."
23008,&gt;The FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
23009,(applies to others out there).
23010,"They're being intellectually dishonest if they say stuff like ""oh, well that's not FULL approval"" blah blah blah."
23011,No doubt.
23012,"Out of curiosity, do you live with anyone?"
23013,"If so, did they ever end up catching it?"
23014,"Yes, my wife and I are both double vaccinated with AZ."
23015,190 units per ml after 10 weeks of the second jab seems really low compared to Pfizer.
23016,It will be interesting to see here in the UK how the efficacy of AZ relates to hospitalisations in the next couple of months.
23017,I can‚Äôt understand why people are down voting you.
23018,"Children under 12 can‚Äôt get vaccinated, yet, so you‚Äôre absolutely right."
23019,What a garbage human being.

23026,The FDA already said variant specific boosters won't need to go through a full trial.
23027,They will rely on past safety data and just need to determine efficacy.
23028,Moderna has been studying a new booster for a while now.

23031,Delta is spreading quickly among the unvaccinated.
23032,Hospital workers and others are suffering as a result.
23033,What is it that you actually want?
23034,I just don‚Äôt understand why vaccinated people are worried then?
23035,If everyone is vaccinated couldn‚Äôt they still catch the delta variant thus the need to wear masks?
23036,If you need the rabies vaccine due to possible exposure you get a human immunoglobulin injection along with the first vaccine dose.
23037,Your body takes a few days to begin producing enough of its own antibodies so the immunoglobulin injection provides some protection while your body ramps up.
23038,And then you still need three more vaccine doses.
23039,These repubs speak poison from their forked tongues.

23063,"Also
&gt;A doctor in Alabama said one of the last things her patients do before they are intubated due to Covid-19, is beg her for the vaccine, but she has to tell them it's too late."
23064,"I was always under the impression that if it‚Äôs time to be intubated, you probably aren‚Äôt well enough to hold a conversation."
23065,This is false.
23066,The death toll is accurate as can be.
23067,The controversy is over whether the deaths should be hospital deaths or nursing home deaths.
23068,Imagine having a completely avoidable third wave though.
23069,That's how efficacy has been reported from day 1.
23070,A civilised society should seek to protect the weak and the vulnerable.
23071,"So what he's really saying is: ""ive botched the messaging on this so catastrophically, and i have no finger to the pulse if American public life, so I'll softly advise this buy won't mandate anything out of fear""."
23072,This is the guy who is supposed to be the top dog.
23073,His word *should* be the foremost word of wisdom when it comes to how to deal with this.
23074,Unfortunately the public health experts have so cataclysmically botched their messaging that they've cried wolf too many times.
23075,"Their sketchiness and inconsistencies have forced them into this corner, they *want* to recommend things but know its so damn untenable because theyve been crying wolf (with varying levels of validity, some of which i agree with, mind you) for over a year."
23076,"These people dont care about your job, your mental health, your family life, they have 1 top concern that they weigh against nothing else and its slowing COVID."
23077,"But unfortunately for them, US life has mostly moved on from COVID as a Centerpoint."
23078,"So even if this Delta nonsense had even a shred of a threat to vaccinated individuals, his word (which should still be meaningful, isnt) is invalid."
23079,He spent his validity in the eyes of many Americans long ago with back tracking and misrepresentation.
23080,"So what's really happening here, is he'd *like* to have enforced some unnecessary stuff to maybe sorta possibly somehow minutely decrease spread between statistical outlier populations, and to do so would require group effort on the part of the vast-mega-majority."
23081,But he knows there's zero traction there.
23082,Best I can do is no mask mandates and making it illegal to require vaccination status at public venues.
23083,Fuck Ron Desantis.
23084,"Too little, too late."
23085,"I just saw a post earlier that said he was encouraging Floridians to get vaccinated, and now I see this."
23086,The only result I can see from this is a whole bunch of little kids getting sick.
23087,"‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù

Have you been to many political sites?"
23088,Republicans hate Democrats and liberal leaning states.
23089,Democrats hate Republicans and conservative leaning states.
23090,You mean 2 thirds
23091,I hope someone's told you this already but I'm so proud of you!
23092,Then just be for vaccine mandates for school.
23093,"No reason a mask mandate should ever happen again for covid19, it should only be vaccine mandates."
23094,Yup.

23098,One step forward 3 steps back.
23099,What made you get 2 shots instead of j&amp;j.
23100,How did you fare during shots.
23101,I tried to sign them up for every single trial and I would take them right now if I could.
23102,I considered fudging my 11 year old‚Äô sage (12 in Dec) but felt wrong doing it.
23103,It‚Äôs like shooting your self in the foot instead of the head.
23104,In your imaginary scenario - maybe.
23105,Thankfully that is not an issue in Colorado.
23106,Lmao I c u ron
23107,all states really need to do this.
23108,It‚Äôs a super helpful and honestly relieves a bit of concern for many vaccinated people when they see that it‚Äôs still primarily unvaccinated being hospitalized.
