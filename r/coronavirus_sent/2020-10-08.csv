111,I can understand why governments have been reticent to lock down now - the populous is over the whole idea and just wants things to return to normal.
112,It's been six months FFS.
113,"However, the fact that they need to lock down now is BECAUSE they fucked up locking down in April-June, when everyone was still 'pulling together' (except the americans) and it was easier to get people to comply."
114,"Had they got the numbers down to zero then, they would be able to have normality now."
115,So now they have to use what they can do.
116,"That means closing down bars, restaurants, etc."
117,"because they HAVE to obey, and fining people who meet in homes etc."
118,"It's all they have to get control - and the situation isn't going to get better UNTIL they eradicate the disease - first in defined regions, then everywhere in the country."
119,"And with the news that antibodies are only lasting 3 months, coupled with the certainty of mutations, even vaccines are unlikely to be the solution (and won't arrive to mid next year at the earliest) - you HAVE to get rid of the disease from the population."
120,"Portland was the last show on like March 16, and Eugene was slotted for the following night"

172,Learning from their former colonials across the pond.
173,&gt;	The error in the estimate here that you’re talking about is a measure of all of the times that the flu actually contributed to someone’s death in any way.
174,"When a doctor has reason to blame a death as being due at least in part to Influenza, they write it down as such."
175,This is also true of COVID-19.
176,Comparing the verified death counts is a much much more valid comparison.
177,&gt;The flu estimate isn’t merely to catch everyone who died while infected with the flu but didn’t get tested for it.
178,It uses every bit of relevant data we can think of to adjust that actual death count upwards.
179,"It tries to capture the full extent of the disease’s burden, every last bit of it."
180,"It even considers deaths where, for example, the flu worsened someone’s pre-existing condition and then they got over the flu but later died of that pre-existing condition."
181,It is a fundamentally different measure than the raw death count.
182,"Again, I’m not using the covid death count."
183,I don’t know why you keep talking about that when I’ve repeatedly explained what I’m referencing as the covid deaths.
184,"&gt;	~55,000 people died on average each week in 2019, for a total death count that year of ~2.85M people."
185,And that was before coronavirus.
186,"So far this year we are averaging ~62,000 deaths per week, on pace to hit ~3.24M deaths by the end of the year if that average holds true."
187,"So, 390,000 more deaths by the end of the year, assuming the rate stays around the average."
188,"&gt;	Which means 62,000 / 5,300 = 11.69 is a roughly calculated limit on the maximum error factor that a COVID-19 estimate could have."
189,"There is plenty of room for its estimated death count to be double, if not triple, the verified death count, or more."
190,This is an absolutely insane calculation.
191,"Sure, if you assume that **literally everyone who dies this year, died from covid**, you can get 11.69x the official count."
192,That’s a terrible way to figure out what the real error bars could reasonably be.
193,"The real upper limit is the number you calculated earlier (390,000) once we reach the end of the year."
194,"&gt;	No, of course there are not hundreds of thousands to millions unaccounted for deaths, but as this disease rages on it is undoubtedly leaving in its wake thousands if not tens or even hundreds of thousands of unaccounted for causes of death."
195,"No, this is not happening."
196,See above.
197,"There are very likely tens of thousands, but the chances of hundreds of thousands of unaccounted for deaths are vanishingly small."
198,There have not been enough **excess** deaths this year for that to be true.
199,&gt;	Just because you test someone for COVID-19 who is dying and they come out negative does not mean that COVID-19 did not contribute to their death.
200,"To get an idea if it did, much like we do with the flu, you need to take external data into account, like what DID they die from, what are the chances they ever contracted COVID, and what are the chances that it exacerbated any pre-existing condition or created a new preexisting condition that ultimately led to their demise down the road, long after their COVID infection subsided."
201,This is how the flu estimated is calculated and this is why comparing it to COVID’s verified death count is so misleading and faulty.
202,That’s why I’m not comparing those two numbers.
203,"I’m comparing the number of additional deaths that occurred this year because of covid, as estimated by the excess deaths, vs the estimated number of flu related deaths per the CDC."
204,The rest of your comment is just treading the same ground.
205,Hopefully you understand what I’m saying now.

260,"And keeping distance from strangers wouldn't hurt either, pandemic or not."
261,"The lack of basic respect and care for their fellow citizens people have shown this year is just disgusting and frankly deeply disappointing, I thought we would be better than this."
262,"I didn't think we would be great, but just not *this* bad."
263,Was this the state that fired their health directr
264,"Sure, with different shows and higher ticket prices because all the theaters will need revenue."
265,"Yeah, people can't be surprised that the general public won't be happy about the literal biggest restrictions on our freedoms in our lifetimes, even though it is for a good cause."
266,Especially as it was originally sold as a one time deal that'd last 2 months max.

391,"That was the point of this, a debate, which has been accomplished."

441,Keep in mind though that the Flu Season death numbers are estimates based upon a sampling as opposed to COVID-19 numbers which are based upon an actual count of actual cases and deaths.
442,Which makes it even more absurd that people are waving flu death numbers in our faces as some sort of evidence against COVID-19.
443,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What methods are used to estimate the number of influenza-associated deaths in the U.S.?"
444,The **methods to estimate the annual number of influenza-associated deaths** have been described in detail elsewhere (1-2).
445,**The model** uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations **in order to estimate the total influenza-associated deaths** from the **estimated** number of influenza-associated hospitalizations.
446,&gt;We first look at how many in-hospital deaths were observed in FluSurv-NET.
447,The **in-hospital deaths are adjusted for under-detection of influenza** using methods similar to those described above for hospitalizations using data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing.
448,"Second, because not all deaths related to influenza occur in the hospital, we use death certificate data to **estimate** how likely  deaths are to occur outside the hospital."
449,"We look at death certificates that have pneumonia or influenza causes (P&amp;I), other respiratory and circulatory causes (R&amp;C), or other non-respiratory, non-circulatory causes of death, because deaths related to influenza may not have influenza listed as a cause of death."
450,"We use information on the causes of death from FluSurv-NET to determine the mixture of P&amp;I, R&amp;C, and other coded deaths to include in our investigation of death certificate data."
451,"**Finally, once we estimate the proportion of influenza-associated deaths that occurred outside of the hospital, we can estimate the deaths-to-hospitalization ratio."
452,"**

&gt;**Data needed to estimate influenza-associated deaths may lag for up to two years after the season ends."
453,"When this is not yet available for the season being estimated, we adjust based on values observed in prior seasons (e.g., the 2010-2011 season through the 2016-2017 season) and update the estimates when more current data become available."

607,Furlough (which this is a form of) is different from typical redundancy because you are still at least partially employed with the supposed intention that you will return to full employment at a future date.
608,You usually get paid at a reduced rate if you are an employee.
609,"Contractors, Freelancers and other temporary staff are usually not paid at all."
610,"Redundancy is typically final and you are entitled to 0.5, 1, or 1.5 (age-related: -22, 22-41, 41+) weeks pay (there are upper limits) per year of service but some companies offer more than this."
611,"There are a few non-typical redundancies about at the moment where companies have laid staff off into a ""retention pool"" with an agreement that any new jobs will be offered to that pool first before going externally."
612,If you are formally furloughed then you cannot work your employer but you can work elsewhere.
613,"The main difference between this new scheme and the others that we have had so far, is that it only applies to business forced to close by the government."

652,Holy smokes 2.9x!
653,We need to lockdown until a vaccine is distributed
654,yes...South America has the highest death rates per cap on a country level.
655,Worldometers.
656,Death rates in some US states are much higher - like NYC skewing NY State.

658,I hear many friends from smaller countries say that their government exaggerates the number of cases to receive aid.

661,Yeah though I suspect that you can probably start to safely rehearse before then
662,My particular political lens is a Biden voter who’s highly skeptical of the the covid response after May.

675,If you smoke as a underage person police inform maybe the Child Protection Service (depends on how young you are) also taxes increase each year or so.
676,"Some years ago smoking was allowed for 16 year olds after it was increased to 18 and in combination with taxes going higher and also that it s forbidden to smoke in Bars and Restaurants (also ""new"" law) the percentage of smokers decreased."
677,"If you smoke in a Restaurant, yeah i think the penalty is harsh for the Restaurant so they enforce it... Something like with masks and supermarkets here in germany - also harsh penalty."

679,99.99% of people wear masks here and nobody smokes in a Restaurant.

697,How many?

752,For the same reasons.
753,That is what I am asking.
754,Is treatment that much better?

762,These reported are deaths resulted from a positive covid test.

822,Who would’ve thought.
823,The helicopter pilot died of covid.
824,So 1/7th of the way there.
825,There’s the thing: chickens are much smarter than we give them credit for.
826,"According to research, they have demonstrated unexpected cognitive abilities (please see [Brainy Bird] (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/515cca87e4b0bca14d767b61/t/530d2250e4b0b60005707556/1393369680975/Brainy+Bird.pdf) published by Scientific American, and this 2017 [study] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1064-4) for a glimpse on this)
&gt;Chickens can count, show some level of self-awareness, and even manipulate one another."
827,"They also have very good episodic memory and can demonstrate empathy towards other chickens [and their chicks] (https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/animal-emotions/201103/empathic-chickens-and-cooperative-elephants-emotional-intelligence) subjected to unpleasant stimuli, among other well developed cognitive and emotional functions."
828,This [study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598708/) (“Chickens Are a Lot Smarter than I Originally Thought”: Changes in Student Attitudes to Chickens Following a Chicken Training Class”) shows how animal science and veterinary students’ perceptions of chicken intelligence and capacity to experience emotion and thus overall attitude to chicken changed after participating on a chicken training class.
829,Fish are also far from dumb and some species were found to outperform other animals generally regarded as more intelligent such as higher primates in some cognitive tasks.
830,"[This] (https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18224515-200-animal-minds-not-just-a-pretty-face/#ixzz6aJ24DyOF) is a very good article about it, but since it’s paywalled I’m posting the entire thing on my next comment."
831,"I don’t mean to overwhelm you with links, especially as such information is widely avaliable - I suggest you google “fish intelligence” (there’s even a Wikipedia article with this exact title with some nice scientific references) and “chicken intelligence” if you’re interested."
832,"Also take a look at [this] (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201406/fish-are-sentient-and-emotional-beings-and-clearly-feel-pain?amp), regarding fish sentience."
833,"One thing I don’t understand though, is why you base your moral code on intelligence, as sentience is what is really relevant when it comes to the question of ethics."
834,"Human babies are a lot less intelligent than many animals we eat, humans with intellectual disabilities same."
835,Is it your opinion that people with lower intellectual capacity are less worthy of our empathy and consideration than more intelligent individuals?
836,"Some animals may be considered less intelligent than others by our assessment, but they’re still highly capable of experiencing pain and suffering."
837,So don’t you think we should refrain from inflicting it on them?
838,There’s one thing my sister said to me when she discovered veganism (it was her who got me into it) that has stuck with me.
839,"As I told you, she has lupus and have been seriously depressed for a long time (she’s a lot better now)."
840,"She told me that she knew pain and suffering too well and that having learned what she did about the suffering of animals, there was no way she was going to continue to inflict it on them."
841,She said it was bad enough that she suffered herself and that she didn’t want to be the cause of the suffering of other beings.
842,I thought this was very admirable of her.
843,"I think that even if you don’t feel empathetic toward some animals, you can still understand how harmful consuming them is (to them, to you and to the planet)."
844,Empathy is just one route that leads you to take issue with animal suffering and decide not to take any part in it.
845,"It’s definitely not a requirement for veganism, and you can definitely get there through reason alone."
846,"Personally, I wouldn’t call myself an animal lover at all, but I understand that it’s wrong to subjugate and make other sentient beings suffer for my sake."
847,Their lives are not mine to take and their bodies are not mine to exploit.
848,I also understand the great harms of the industries based on animal exploitation overall.
849,I really don’t think there’s anything wrong in trying to show people that they should strive for veganism.
850,"Cause once they really get it, it stops being an outside demand and they realize for themselves that it’s the right to do."
851,"I think there are far too many people who will turn vegetarian or reducterian and be satisfied with that, especially if vegans and others that oppose to any kind of animal suffering keep reinforcing the idea by telling them that’s good enough."
852,I’m just trying to show people that they can and should do more.
853,"And I’m not trying to show this all at once to an omnivore, i’ve been replying to people who are already supposedly half-way through, but for their own particular reasons have settled for being there."
854,Again it's the same scenario.
855,"The allies were against the genocide (for obvious reasons), axis scientists were pro so they could get ethically immoral research."
856,The allies then adopted the newfound tech for selfish military gains that led into newer technologic advances.
857,"Yes it's hypocritical of the president to use that tech to help himself, but it's not that far off with what we already deem accepted hypocrisy."
858,"To me it's a certain group of people trying to bend the truth saying his cure was made from stem cells, but really it was another form of antibodies that used  that research."
859,"The title ahould be clear ""president uses new therapy based on stem cell research"" as opposed to lying"
860,"UofU hospital is in Salt Lake City, where there are several hospitals within a few miles of each other."
861,Removing critical information from the title seems like OP editorialized.
862,Reminder: He's already declared bankruptcy 6 times before to the tune of literally BILLIONS.
863,"If the American people had used their actual memories instead of just buying into The Apprentice hype they would have remembered what was already common knowledge throughout the 80s and 90s, namely that he is a fraud who excels only at going bankrupt."
864,Sad we had to hit a real health catastrophe costing hundreds of thousands of lives before SOME people started to gradually wake up.
865,Haven’t we seen this before?
866,Why are c0nservatives so fucking dumb?
867,I actually believe this one but without the hot take part of it

876,Immunity lasting for 12 months would certainly be unideal but it would not be impossible to surmount.
877,"Vaccinating a large proportion of the population each year would be doable I think, considering what is at stakes."
878,"I know that only a fraction of the population gets the annual flu shot, but I think it's pretty clear that this is not the flu and so the amount of pressure and incentive to get it done regularly would be enormous."
879,Sorry.
880,I am 74 and I am growing backwards using entirely natural and paleo means.
881,This of course won't last forever.
882,They'd have to be planning to accept the results of the election for that to matter.

890,"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/05/05/the-unreal-dichotomy-in-covid-19-mortality-between-high-income-and-developing-countries/

&gt;On April 30, the global death toll due to the coronavirus was 230,000."
891,That’s only about 1.5 times the number of deaths the world expects on an average day.
892,The number would not seem large were it not for the fact that it is highly unevenly distributed.
893,"Just five high-income countries (HICs)—the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France—account for 70 percent of global deaths."
894,Data quality seems to be the main driver of this.
895,"&gt;Data quality—accuracy, completeness, consistence, timeliness, and validity—is likely the main culprit why the true death toll is not reflected in the statistics."
896,"Where testing has been limited or untimely, data quality will suffer—as the experience in high-income countries has demonstrated."
897,"&gt;Death may be better measured than infection, especially in HICs, but even so there is ample evidence that COVID-19 deaths are being misattributed to different causes."
898,"By some estimates, reported death rates in selected countries could be underestimated by 60 percent."
899,It doesn't account for all of it though.
900,"With Arms Wide Open

 Cue some shitty 90s song"
901,This probably would have gone over better if I had removed the name “Trump” from the post title.
902,He seems like an apolitical figure.
903,But without that piece of evidence everyone's bashing on Trump can continue..
904,"If you got nothing, go ad hominem..."
905,Yes.
906,"If they are not following simple guidelines, its time to do it by force."
907,it does right now...just not in like 2024 lol
908,You don’t really mean to imply he’s a Manchurian candidate or a Russian double agent do you?
909,"When you realize that Trump is 100% sociopathic, professional bullshit artist."
910,"It’s always been true, but getting the message across is exhausting."
911,Wow!
912,That is fucking flawless.
913,Most of thats coming out of his mouth!
914,i agree the trump admin has totally failed in that regard but this can't be done forever.
915,"Yes I agree, we can have healthy debate about NHC's daily report numbers."
916,"I can present supporting evidence like how China has a testing program that test all individuals working in at risk professions every two weeks which allowed them to detect very quickly situations like the two asymptomatic carriers in Qingdao, or evidences like lack of cases from Chinese travellers going to other countries."
917,Other people can then refute these if able and we can have an intelligent discussion.
918,"That's why I asked the question [""are you aware of what sort of pandemic prevention measures China have put in place?"
919,"""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/j7ojcv/china_update_on_covid19_pandemic_situation_as_of/g860rbc/)

947,It lasted until Late May where they opened everything back up when they thought they were winning against the virus
948,agw = Global warming typo?
949,Thanks for the kind words.
950,I’m not an expert in epidemiology but I have some decent math/statistics credentials.
951,"Maybe I’m wrong on some minor points and I’m happy to be educated on how I’m wrong, but from my point of view it’s pretty crazy when you actually attempt to *honestly* compare COVID-19 to Influenza."
952,I live in NY.
953,"We got hit hard early, but there was a silver lining; people here take it seriously."
954,Mask usage has been almost universal since April.
955,"As a result, life is mostly back to normal."
956,"We still go out to dinner, even went away for a weekend in the summer (to CT state, also one of the safest), took a trip to the city, the usual fall apple/pumpkin picking and everything has been fine."
957,Brand new local businesses are even starting to open.
958,"Case numbers have (Predictably) risen very slightly since fall, but test positivity remains around or below 1%."
959,"Im fortunate to work from home, but I could honestly live like this For as long as needed."
960,"Life here since we got it under control has been just fine, even better in some ways."
961,There is no fucking way that closing gyms and bars that don't serve food while keeping all else open brought cases down like that.
962,"Compare our curve to Sweden's, they are very similar."
963,We have achieved a level of herd immunity here in AZ.
964,Concerts and traveling for concerts was my main release.
965,I literally see red rocks every morning driving my kid to preschool.
966,It's bitter
967,&gt; Death growing by 50 % compared to the day prior dosen't mean cumulative death is rising the same way.
968,If it's a pure exponential - aka rising from some tiny value by 50% per day - then it does.
969,"At the start of the pandemic this was the case when the disease first entered an area, but obviously now it's not."
970,&gt; I fail to see why Sweden could have stopped their deaths in general in mid march.
971,"Sweden's spread was much slower, but the way they would have stopped deaths was simply by protecting nursing homes."
972,A larger percentage of their deaths were in nursing homes than anywhere else.
973,"The implication is that with their system of personal responsibility, older people outside nursing homes did not catch it as much as younger people did, since they acted early to warn people."
974,But in nursing homes it still spread just as fast as everywhere else.
975,"Once they began testing they quickly put an end to nursing home outbreaks, and deaths quickly plummeted."
976,"Nursing homes are a tiny percentage of infections, but the mortality there is overwhelmingly high."
977,I admit I cannot back this up with any sources.
978,"But Tegnell has ""admitted"" mistakes a few times; you could see what he said about them."
979,Well also no one was going out in 116 degree weather.
980,Also a lot of us were travelling 😬
981,Are these the deaths that make you feel 20 years younger?
982,Asking for a dead relative.
983,Young people.
984,"If this were the U.S. IFR, then everyone in NYC would have to have been infected twice and we'd have 160 million infections country-wide already."
985,The prediction in the Bible regarding the anti-christ says that the antichrist will be delt a deadly blow...
986,But Satan intervenes and saves him.
987,"There's nothing wrong with an extra layer of protection, for hospitals and people"
988,nice talking point bot
989,Dallas went from over 1200 cases a day to only 600 two weeks after the mask mandate was put in place for Texas.
990,Its been dropping but lax enforcement and ETRs have been keeping it around 200 a day
991,I'm curious if this man wore a mask or not.
992,I'm assuming he didn't.
993,"If he didn't, was it voluntary?"
994,"If it was not voluntary, and mandated by, err...the president, then shouldn't that be some sort of violation of work safety?"
995,"I see, but the problem is that there's just no way to really *measure* how much enforcement is being done, and whether people are truly following precautions, besides speculation."
996,I feel like some actual quantitative analysis would be nice on some sort of relationship between enforcement of measures and covid conditions in a given region.
997,Furthermore I think just looking at case counts can be misleading.
998,This does not account for number of tests ran and daily reports on numbers of cases can include cases from tests that happened a week ago or sooner.
999,"It's more useful to put it into context with hospitalization trends, look at cases by specimen collection date, and note any trends in % positivity."
1000,Using raw numbers alone is prone to all kinds of inaccuracies.
1001,I guess that's a different topic though.
1002,And once again there's still nothing you can do about the at home transmission vector.
1003,"People get the flu shot, get the flu anyway, but still come home and infect multiple people in their house with the flu."
1004,Kind of just how it goes.
1005,"So, there will be spread regardless."
1006,Anyway...
1007,"I also feel that the hyper focus on masks can take away from other NPI's that matter such as physical distancing, hand washing, and staying home when you're sick."
1008,"When you only talk about masks, masks, masks, you kind of miss the other stuff too."
1009,"We can probably both agree though, that the messaging throughout all of this has been awful"
1010,I am surprised some maskless asshole has not called it anecdotal and told you to be quiet.
1011,Sorry for your loss.
1012,&gt; It isn't March.
1013,"They were trying to save lives with everything they had against a novel virus

They buckled under political pressure to approve emergency authorization when there wasn't any need to."
1014,The scientists and doctors could have continued to study it without emergency authorization.
1015,"It was only when the evidence from the rest of the world became overwhelming, did they revoke the approval."
1016,"Besides, by March, we had good idea of what works."
1017,"Masks, hand washing, social distancing, contact tracing, avoiding large groups of people, shutting down non-essential businesses."
1018,"But since the US government was against these measures, they were not rolled out on a large scale."

1123,"Wait...there wasn't actually any new ""mask science"" since the original advice was a lie by Fauci to mitigate PPE shortages, right?"
1124,What role does Trump play in the decisions made by individual states to mitigate the virus?
1125,Are the deaths in care homes in NY his fault as well?
1126,Does Cuomo bear no responsibility for the decision to fill those care homes with infected persons?
1127,It's fascinating how emotion can so warp a person's perception of events.
1128,Lot of questions there.
1129,Lets see if any of *them* get answered.
1130,I have a feeling the “high risk” group that gets vaccinated first is going to everybody
1131,Cus white America took their land
1132,"In  the movies, the only way the top brass and leaders are ever together to get infected or decimated is because of their enemy scheming to get them in that position; because the protagonists are too smart and moral otherwise to be that dumb."

1135,Everyone is commenting as if masks were the driving factor begins the75% drop.
1136,"What about: ""restrictions on public events and closures of bars, gyms, movie theaters and restaurants"""

1138,But I’m still triggered by this comment lol
1139,[removed]
1140,Take a chill pill and relax
1141,I... oof...
1142,I feel like a sin against nature but I’m a doctor and could not read that whole book.
1143,The ethical issue there is a more complex one than most (Tuskegee and Holocaust experimentation bad.
1144,"Obviously), and I really wanted to explore that, but since the author wasn’t in medicine, things that are normal (driving around to collect animal blood would have been possibly for early cultures), was equated by things that aren’t now (colored wards) and moral gray areas (if this tissue saves lives, is it ethical to keep it, but then is it ethical not to give the family a choice)."
1145,"About a third in, I gave up."
1146,[removed]
1147,"Prescott is pretty far to the right compared to most of Arizona's population, wife was up there recently made the same comment."
1148,Trump be like if he dies he dies
1149,"They could have stopped him in January, but chose not to even try."
1150,"The comment was ""If be surprised if it wasn't 85-90%."""
1151,That's what raised an eyebrow for me.
1152,I'm tired of people asserting things they can't possibly know about the virus and the vaccine.
1153,Like that they know that *because of what we know about the virus* that would mean any vaccine for the virus should be 80-90% that just doesn't make sense and I called it out.
1154,We need to be more humble about this thing.
1155,It's new.
1156,"&gt; I am terrified about the potential long term effects Coronavirus has on people though, like what if I can't have kids now or I drop dead 10 years from now?"
1157,I think with any worry it's helpful to think about what utility it might provide.
1158,If you're a smoker worrying about the effects of smoking then maybe that could be useful in giving you extra motivation to quit.
1159,"I still wouldn't worry all the time, but at least it *could* be beneficial."
1160,"But to use another example, I took a lot of MDMA (and other psychoactives) back in the day in a fairly stupid and unhealthy way."
1161,It's possible when I hit 50 or 60 that the damage done will mean I get dementia or other neurological disease.
1162,But I can't undo taking those drugs so it's not very useful to worry about it.
1163,So I don't.
1164,If you've already had it then all you can do is try to be generally healthy in your lifestyle (which presumably you would try to do anyway).
1165,So there is no value in worrying about it.
1166,You might say that you can't control that kind of thought but you can probably control the thoughts which lead to that thought or the actions/behaviours that triggers the thought chain.
1167,If watching the news on TV is leading you to be terrified (indirectly) then stop watching the news on TV for a while.
1168,Or get your news from other sources.
1169,"If it's a particularly negative person you know, tell them to STFU."
1170,On those specific concerns though there is no reason to think either of those things will happen.
1171,"I mean, you might as well dwell on the idea that the Coronavirus will make your penis larger, make you more handsome and raise your IQ by 30 points - those are ridiculous thoughts as well but you might as well be happy while being ridiculous."
1172,Unfortunately it’s not going to be a binary process once a vaccine is approved - vaccine rollout will take time (with some vaccine candidates requiring a booster one month later).
1173,"More importantly, it’s not guaranteed that a vaccine will have 100% efficacy - the FDA will approve anything with 30% efficacy or greater, because it would take a significant bite out of the percentage needed for true herd immunity."
1174,"But, if that were the actual efficacy, 70% of people who received the vaccine would still be vulnerable, and would since we don’t necessarily know who those 70% are, masks will still be necessary."
1175,"It’s unfortunate, but the fact of the matter is that it’s likely going to take multiple vaccine candidates and iterations to get to true immunity."
1176,The real debate will need to focus on what relative scaling back of restrictions is appropriate as a larger proportion of the populace gains immunity.
1177,Trump caused the death of more than 200k Americans through misinformation.
1178,He will kill 200k more if JUSTICE is not served.
1179,Republican leadership must stop encouraging wreckless behavior and start encouraging the use of sanitary precautions.
1180,They are accomplice to Trump.
1181,[removed]
1182,Yeah idk if the vaccine will work for a long time.
1183,Not sure.
1184,Reinfections happen with like 5% or something of cases.
1185,That's why new Zealand had no cases but after 100 days they started having new cases again cause of reinfections.
1186,Idk how vaccines will work but it might be a 3 months thing every time that we will have to take it until they can make a better one.
1187,Not sure.
1188,We will figure it out as it goes.
1189,"Wow, that really sucks."
1190,Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant but maybe it will be in some way interesting.
1191,If not skip to 'I'm not immune myself' for the potentially useful part.
1192,"If I have one critique for the environmental movement as a whole, it'd be that too much of the messaging demands serious lifestyle changes of people who have no interest in change, then basically shames them for not changing."
1193,"It's *so easy* to seriously cut down one's carbon footprint with simple choices *that don't in any way affect quality of life*- I mean things like using LED bulbs, throw up some solar panels, buy an efficient furnace, get a smart thermostat that backs off on the HVAC when you're at work, etc."
1194,I wish more environmentalists would focus on that message- you can improve your footprint simply and easily *without reduced quality of life*.
1195,"That's a message almost anyone can get behind, especially since it usually saves money."
1196,"Unfortunately too much of the messaging has been 'stop doing this, start doing that'."
1197,"Stop eating meat, start a smelly compost pile, stop enjoying hot showers, start taking fast cold showers, stop driving your nice car, start driving a crappy Prius with no acceleration, etc."
1198,"The result is backlash actions like 'rolling coal'- if you've not heard of it, it's where people with big engine diesel trucks take all the emissions control hardware out of their exhaust system, then crank the fuel injection all the way up, so when you floor it the truck produces a huge cloud of thick black smoke."
1199,"This is a form of [anti-environmental protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal) (wish I was making that up, but I'm not)."
1200,I think your husband's actions are sort of like rolling coal.
1201,And it's unfortunate.
1202,**I'm not immune myself.
1203,"**  
I fully support any and all environmental efforts, and I think climate change is going to seriously harm humanity (and it's our own stupid fault)."
1204,I also strongly rebel against anyone telling me how to live my life.
1205,"I buy the most efficient HVAC I can afford, and a smart thermostat to shut it off while nobody's home, but I still want to crank that thing up and sleep in a cold bedroom in the middle of summer, and I will strongly resist any effort telling me not to."
1206,Could I reduce my environmental footprint with lifestyle changes?
1207,Sure.
1208,"I could meet with people at my job only as a last resort, I could take quick cold showers, I could leave the HVAC off and be uncomfortable in my house, and yes, I could stop eating meat."
1209,"I'm not going to do any of these things, because I want to enjoy my life and these things all give me a better life."
1210,"Meeting people face to face makes me better at my job, which makes me more money, and the rest are just things that make life more fun."
1211,I like plenty of non meat foods.
1212,And I sometimes try to choose them over meat for environmental reasons.
1213,I want ethically raised meats and I try to buy organic as much as possible.
1214,My partner (who also cares about the planet but eats meat) sometimes suggests things like veggie burgers.
1215,"I've had a few, most taste like sawdust or paint thinner or both."
1216,"Closest I've had was the Burger King one, it tasted like a very overdone normal burger (IE more smoke than meat)."
1217,"And so when I get such a suggestion, my natural instinct is to poke fun at it- 'Have fun with the rabbit food, I'm going to have real food' type thing."
1218,I always (after a few jabs) admit that the veggie option is better for the planet.
1219,But I sometimes wonder why I make the jab in the first place.
1220,It's just a natural instinct.
1221,Maybe it's a 'resource guarding' thing- old brain emotion thinks the tribe's food source is being stolen.
1222,"Maybe it's an unjustified emotional reaction to all the PETA 'meat is murder' hypocrites, or the smug virtue-signalling types who personify the joke 'how do you know if someone is vegetarian?"
1223,"You don't need to, they'll tell you'."
1224,"Or maybe it's an internal struggle; I know eating meat (even in the best cases) is bad from a carbon standpoint, I should be actively seeking out meat alternatives and giving them every possible chance rather than continually referencing the nasty fake burgers I tried years ago... maybe I know that I should be the one subbing salads for steaks, and not making fun of the 'rabbit food diet'."
1225,Or maybe it's an ethical hypocrisy I fully admit.
1226,"I have had opportunities to go hunting, but I have no desire to personally kill an innocent animal so I refuse."
1227,"I think that's one of those things where the first time you do it is hard, then something inside you changes, and then it's easy; I don't want it to be easy, I don't want to become that sort of person."
1228,"And yet by my actions I am causing it to happen- I buy the steak, and because I (and those like me) buy the steak, the farmer breeds and raises and slaughters the cow, doing the dirty work of my meal that I hypocritically refuse to while I enjoy the undeserved result without getting my own hands dirty."
1229,"To be clear, I don't think killing (humanely treated) animals for food is necessarily wrong, but I do think it's hypocritical to eat the meat if you aren't willing to pull the trigger."
1230,"THAT ALL SAID, none of it excuses him getting emotional and insulting."
1231,"It may explain it, but doesn't excuse it."
1232,"Relationships need communication, compromise, and mutual respect- he should respect your dietary choices, and you should respect his."
1233,He should give your rabbit food (sorry!)
1234,a fair try and eat it from time to time if it's not totally unpalatable; you should be okay with him eating meat if he doesn't like the veggie dish.
1235,Or go back and forth- have meat nights and non meat nights where he can have pizza or something.
1236,"But no matter what underlying emotional issues there are, it does NOT excuse him getting pissed off and insulting over your dietary choices."
1237,"He may hate vegetarianism with a fiery passion, and he may rile against it all he wants, but he should love you more than he hates vegetarianism."
1238,"I doubt that all will be of much help for you, hopefully maybe a little..."
1239,Is there any study on the percentage of cases that have long term effects?
1240, Also many European countries are very small and dense.
1241,The US is massive and restrictions/testing varies wildly.
1242,"TBQH I wouldnt want someone to inject ""experimental"" drugs into my body if the guy paid me for it."
1243,80 miles is 128.75 km
1244,"Anti mask but pro life, it makes no sense"
1245,They can't admit the big man is wrong .
1246,"&gt;Look I really do not want to argue with you 

We're mostly discussing subjective matters."
1247,"It's nigh impossible for you or I to be wrong when it comes to subjective matters, even if we were on polar opposite sides, so there's nothing to argue about."
1248,"We're just having a respectful, rational, adult discussion about some slight differences in perspective."
1249,":)

&gt;I also do my own compost...

Why?"
1250,Theres lots of sources of ecologically responsible made compost.
1251,Which is usually of a much higher quality and much safer than what most people make at home.
1252,Most people don't get their homemade compost tested.
1253,And even fewer test what goes into it before its added.
1254,"We have to, and a lot of it has to be discarded due to heavy metal concentrations."
1255,"A fruit with a trace of arsenic isn't a problem to eat, it can even be beneficial."
1256,But a trace amount of arsenic in 500 fruits concentrated by composting can become wildly toxic and is uptaken by many plants and deposited in the fruit bodies.
1257,"Of course, despite knowing that, I still make my own compost and encourage those with the means to do so to do it as well."
1258,"But it could easily be justified as something people should be banned from doing ""for their own good"" because it carries numerous risks to the environment and consumer's health if it's not done correctly."
1259,"&gt;But I am really interested on your solution to the current level of meat production and its devastating impacts on climate, soil and groundwater."
1260,"It's likely the same as your solution to the problems with the current level of plant based agriculture and *it's* devastating impacts on climate, soil, air quality and groundwater."
1261,"I wouldn't expect you to have the solutions to those problems when they've so far escaped all of society throughout human history, and I don't claim to know how to fix all the problems either."
1262,"Well, besides killing off humans, which would very effectively solve a lot of the planet's problems, but would be an issue for us humans."
1263,&gt;I can't think of anything else but prohibition of big industrialized meat production as we have them here in Germany where I live.
1264,"In the US we tried it for about 13 years with alcohol, it went very, very badly."
1265,And we followed that with 90 years (and counting) of prohibition of cannabis and other plant derived intoxicants which has led to millions of shattered lives snd endless atrocities and injustices via the war on drugs.
1266,And intoxicants are far less ubiquitous and revered than meat.
1267,You might as well try banning sex or religion.
1268,"It could be done, but it probably would not make for a more peaceful, benevolent society."
1269,"Quite simply, Prohibition simply does not work."
1270,"You either just move production to a less regulated location or you create a robust, unregulated black market and all the associated societal problems that come with it."
1271,"Really, the only viable solution outside of killing off humanity or imposing a left-leaning flavor of facism is to keep doing what we're doing and hope it all comes together to make a positive difference."
1272,"Keep researching and educating people on healthy eating habits, provide better access to the financial resources needed to make ecoresponsible choices viable for more people,  keep improving effeciency and agricultural innovations to continue making farming less harmful, improve plant based food effeciency, shelf life, and logistics to make them more accessible and affordable, invest in improving conditions in less developed areas so well regulated industry is more socioeconomically feasible, keep working to create affordable human satisfying alternative meat and meat-like products, keep working on renewable powered farm machinery, keep developing better reclamation and remediation methods etc, etc."
1273,So can we finally agree that tre45on weasel is a mass murderer?
1274,&gt; My industry definitely would have been up earlier if cases were lower and testing were more accessible.
1275,"Testing was harder, but cloth masks could've been there since like March... it's depressing to think how much was ruined by an inept response."
1276,And happy to do so
1277,Does anyone know the effects of taking dexamethasone (a immune suppressor) after taking regeneron (a immune booster)?
1278,Wouldn't that just cancel each other out?
1279,so what?
1280,"If this loosely style lockdown works we won’t see case number like this everyday, good luck tell everybody to stay inside regardless their risk, socioeconomic situation."
1281,"The truth is this kind of lockdown doesn’t work, and instead let it ruin everyone’s lives, just ask the vulnerable to quarantine so that everyone else can move on as usual."
1282,I know.

1294,Trump was never a Republican.
1295,Remember he used to fund democrats and was friends with the Clintons.
1296,"When he ran, he knocked out all the Republican candidates; but he knew that he didn't have enough to win by himself so he needed the Republican base to do so."
1297,He went to the RNC and told them to get behind him or lose the election and have Democrats control everything.
1298,"Since Trump knocked out every single Republican candidate, they had no choice but to support him."
1299,"Trump was useful to them, and the Republican base and party was useful to Trump; but they were never on the same side."
1300,The base and the party forgot that and took Trump on as their leader when he never meant to represent them.
1301,"They forgot who they were dealing with, and for that, they stuck with him through this disastrous Covid-19 debacle when he is leading the country and the Republican party to certain ruin."

1317,Agreed!
1318,It's unfortunate that lots of people and politicians don't see it as such.

1328,::shocker::
1329,25th states that the cabinet would have to decide he is incapable.
1330,So we would need a new amendment for what you suggest.
1331,Actually I disagree.
1332,Most people are not talking about filling stadiums to the brim.
1333,They are simply asking to be allowed to sit/stand at a low capacity in an outdoor stadium.
1334,"We’re not talking about 90K at Wembley, but perhaps a few thousand."
1335,"The social distancing in a stadium would be much larger than any indoor space, grocery stores Included."
1336,I haven’t heard anyone asking for full capacity stadiums.
1337,I think you're too focused on the chance of death.
1338,What about the weeks or even months you could spend in the hospital?
1339,"Or the well documented long term effects from many who recover -- severe fatigue, racing heartbeat, blood clots, brain fog."
1340,Meanwhile you're thinking about Covid like it's a blip on a percentage of dying.
1341,But you're toying with a large amount of suffering possible that doesn't even have to include dying.
1342,"If you can avoid it, better to just ride it out until the vaccines arrive."
1343,Then you need to change the constitution to allow for federal mask laws.
1344,People are dying because of this.

1356,Confirmation bias guys
1357,I read the article...it's literally just a tweet of Trump whining that the FDA isn't going fast enough.
1358,They're not going to speed up the approval process just because he complains about it on twitter.
1359,I'm still not seeing any real purpose behind Harris's comment.
1360,"If I were her, I would make it clear that Trump has nothing to do with the vaccine (because he doesn't) and that it doesn't matter at all what he says...to me, that's quite a bit different from saying ""I won't take it if he tells me to..."" Well, he IS going to tell you to, that's the thing."

1408,"&gt; Well, except for the part where they had to lock themselves inside again, because it came back."
1409,"But we'll get to that...

Their 'lockdown' consisted of restricting group sizes to 100 for 1 month in most of NZ."
1410,Auckland had a stricter restriction of 10 people for 2 weeks.
1411,"You might want to educate yourself on NZ's actual measures before commenting on them:

https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/alert-level-2/

https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/alert-level-3/

&gt;Erm...

Not sure what you're trying to prove when Finland has a far lower case/deaths per capita than Sweden."
1412,They've also been largely reopened since May without much issue.
1413,Have you looked at their daily cases per capita compared to the US?
1414,&gt;Um....
1415,Refer above.
1416,&gt;Ahem.
1417,You want to call that normal?
1418,"OK, I guess we can define it down (at least they aren't protesting the police state anymore, amirite?)"
1419,Their spike in July was like ~100-150 cases daily for 2 weeks for a country of 7.5mil.
1420,"That's like the US having ~5.5k cases in a day, which is far below the threshold the CDC (or even Fauci) has said is needed to reopen safely."
1421,What's your point?
1422,"Also, they've had than 20 cases daily since then."
1423,That's the whole point of flattening the curve and keeping it that way via mask mandates/social distancing guidelines - it makes tracing new clusters and thereby containment much easier.
1424,"&gt;I don't believe anything China reports, but OK."
1425,"If you believe their cases are truly at zero, then I have a bridge to sell you."
1426,"But I can't prove otherwise, because, you know...communist state media."
1427,I have friends in China who say that their movement restrictions are largely gone.
1428,Do you really think China would do that if their outbreak has not been contained?
1429,&gt;Are you kidding?
1430,They shut down Auckland again for over a month over a grand total of 29 cases.
1431,Auckland was literally at level 3 for 2 weeks (and then level 2 in which things were reopened) while the rest of NZ was at level 2 for the month.
1432,"&gt;Even a tiny island nation with closed borders

Your land borders and visa office have been closed since the start of the outbreak."
1433,It's virtually impossible for most non-residents to travel into the US.
1434,What's your point?
1435,"Also, if there is no coordinated plan on a *federal* level to ensure that the whole country can open safely at the same time, then that's on your terrible federal leaders, Trump included."
1436,"&gt;Their ""Level 3"" lockdown is about as severe as what New York did in the spring."
1437,"Everything was closed, travel was restricted, and most people stayed home all the time."
1438,No idea why you would link to something then proceed to lie.
1439,"That link literally states:

&gt;You can travel within your local area, for example going to work or school, shopping, or getting exercise."
1440,Public transport can continue to operate with strict health and safety requirements.
1441,Were schools and workplaces open in NY?
1442,Were businesses that didn't require close physical contact be allowed to stay open?
1443,About as severe though!
1444,"Oh yeah, this was also only for 2 weeks out of 5 months since May."
1445,"But yeah, poor NZ, so clearly oppressed."

&gt;(oh, and by the way?"
1447,New Zealand didn't require chin diapers anywhere other than public transit.
1448,Guess they didn't know about The Science (tm)).
1449,NZ requires masks when there is community transmission.
1450,"They have no restrictions, masks or social distancing, when they have zero community cases."
1451,I'll let you connect the dots.
1452,"&gt;Yeah, it sure looks like hell over there."
1453,They're obivously all completely miserable.
1454,I'm glad daddy Cuomo has kept us all safe from that hellish existence!
1455,If only more people weren't so selfish and could abide by social distancing guidelines in NY.
1456,"Sweden, and all the aforementioned countries, have had looser restrictions because their citizens can abide by the rules, which then keeps their countries reopened safely."
1457,It's practically common sense - making *small* sacrifices by wearing masks and follow social distancing whenever possible for the much greater good.
1458,Yet there are people like you still fighting against that.
1459,"&gt;Yeah, people like me, with our pesky sources and facts, spreading all of our scary propaganda."
1460,"We're the worst, right?"
1461,What facts?
1462,Everything you've posted has been debunked.
1463,"Even at NY's lowest, your daily cases per capita far exceeds any of the countries that have been largely reopened after their lockdowns."
1464,The reason why is rather obvious and it's too bad the whole state is held back by idiots who want things to be kept open while refusing to abide by the necessary measures.
1465,Rip me :/ ain't no fortunate one.
1466,No.
1467,"They are using surveillance data for the flu, not confirmed flu deaths."
1468,"In our state, we had 109 flu deaths this year and over 2,100 covid deaths."
1469,We don’t have surveillance data for covid.
1470,The closest measure would be excess deaths.
1471,No  they won't.
1472,"They have shown no willingness to, nor do they have the means to, nor have they built their fleet for invasion."
1473,"""Invasion"" is what Taiwan wants Americans to believe so America will keep sending ships there."
1474,"America,  for its  part, uses ""threat of invasion"" as a pretense to be in the region."
1475,Remember what a carrier is: a floating US military base.
1476,"China wants to invade Taiwan as badly as Taiwan wants to declare independence; which is to say, neither sides want any of it to happen."
1477,"Despite all their rhetoric, look at Taiwan's official name."
1478,"Taiwan, ROC."
1479,ROC = Republic of China.
1480,America's threat to enter the invasion to defend Taiwan is not what is stopping China.
1481,China has more than enough firepower from inland to repel a US fleet based attack.
1482,What they don't have is an invasion fleet.
1483,The only country that has a massive invasion fleet is the USA.
1484,Not sure if killing off your own electoral base sounds is a winning strategy.
1485,"2022 is the next gubernatorial election but Ducey can’t run because he’ll have already served 2 terms, so god knows who the Republicans will select instead"

1497,It's people like them that's making me embarrassed for my fellow countrymen.
1498,I can agree with this.
1499,"First, let me just say I'm not defending his actions, I think it's absurd what he is doing right now, and it's people that behave like he is now that have played a large role in turning COVID-19 into such a horrible pandemic."
1500,"The number of infected officials is now at 18 last I saw, all of which occurred in less than 2 weeks."
1501,"It's likely this cluster originates from a single official, which shows just how quickly it spreads when proper precautions aren't taken."
1502,"The fact that our president is walking around after testing positive, when many americans have had to die almost completely isolated in quarantine, is shocking, and many of his comments describing how easy it was is just a slap in the face for the hundreds of thousands of families who have lost loved ones to COVID-19."
1503,"I am simply explaining why, legally with the laws as written, it is not possible to charge him."
1504,The reason that spreading COVID-19 is different is because you are unintentionally spreading it.
1505,"The most common way AIDS was spread at that time was through ""intentional"" acts, such as sex, blood-to-blood, etc."
1506,"Even then, the law was primarily enforced on people either intentionally trying to spread it, or people being VERY negligent."
1507,"It's also easy to tell generally when someone gave you AIDS, as the requirements for transfer can be placed on a certain date."
1508,"The infected person donated blood, injured themselves, or had sex on this specific date."
1509,COVID-19 is different though.
1510,"It's an airborne disease, meaning just the act of breathing means you spread it."
1511,"The extremely varied incubation time, with actual symptoms showing a few days to weeks after exposure, means it's very difficult to determine exactly when exposure occured."

1807,"Mass majority of people do rather be back to their normal lives in Florida when given the choice, back to work, school and retail business."
1808,"Hospitals there were never even close to be overwhelmed and still see virus case flattened, did not experience fall surge of virus, many of the regions that force business to close or draconian measures are the ones seeing the biggest surge."
1809,Florida is the inspiring leader for many western regions to follow of how to handle this situation best to minimize overall negative impact.

1829,So I'm Australian (living in Sydney) and while I appreciate your support of Australia and our pandemic response I disagree with the idea the we didn't 'get hung up on protecting civil rights'.
1830,"I'm proud that as Australian's we acted as a society, and collectively made sacrifices for the good of those around us, and said society as a whole."
1831,Civil rights is not the opposite of societal action.
1832,And I for one LOVE that I now have the freedom to go about my life in NSW with a very limited risk of contracting COVID-19.
1833,A freedom enjoyed by very few countries right now.
1834,That's not too say it has been perfect or easy (my heart goes out to my friends and family in Melbourne) - but the lockdowns only worked because Australian's believe in and support the wider society that we live in.
1835,"The thing is, and this was clear from the beginning, it if it was going to be a silver bullet against SARS-2, it would not have been a relative failure for the other viruses it was tried against in the past."
1836,The mechanism of action is exactly the same.

1884,"Then he demanded that we re-open and cases surged off the charts, to the worst state in the country."
1885,He eventually relented and the day after all of the various democratic mayors of the major cities passed mask mandates.

1999,We made proges in this direction in germany.
2000,Standards are high (pun intended) but for cancer (i think) and other severe illneses you can get a medical recpit BUT only if all other treatments don t work.
2001,Insight: Punishment is widely different in the country.
2002,In Berlin you can have i think up to 30g (but it s calculated strange like the % thc not the raw Smoking stuff but what i know also not raw thc... at best use the 30g rule for raw stuff) for self use and punishment is therefore not as severe (Citation is maybe the right word?
2003,only problems with driver license is a big problem + money you have to pay... You smoke?
2004,Hah you are not able to Drive or do you have it from a doctor then it s ok if you smoke.
2005,only don t drive after smoking).
2006,This changes drasticly for example in bavaria.
2007,6g is the max for self use.
2008,"Im Berlin more then 30g or bavaria more then 6g and you are a dealer and get a hefty Punishment, maybe jail."
2009,"Also the people react different, in Berlin lf you smoke and police sees you they maybe say ""Boy stop it and go away"" or look in a different Direction."
2010,"in bavaria on the other hand you kiss maybe the ground, get cuffed and have real problems like flat searched etc."
2011,"and god forbid that you have more then 6g you Filthy Criminal scum junky.... 

With more or less no trouble you can have in Berlin i think some g in bavaria on the otherhand it s around 0,6g (not that they don t Search your Flat for it but you mostly should get no Punishment moneywise, driver license is always in danger lf they found something)

Lesson: don t smoke in bavaria or only with advice from some local to be mostly safe."
2012,In Berlin don t be rude but it s much easier.
2013,Tldr: don t smoke pot in germany on a vacation.
2014,If you really want to do it do it in Berlin not bavaria (for your own safety).
2015,Drive to NL and enjoy the coffeshops and some chocomel.

2196,She tested positive for the virus five days later but only made her diagnosis public on Oct. 2 after informing the president that morning.
2197,A person close to her said she attempted to reach the president sooner but was unable to talk to him.
2198,"&gt;For 36 hours after her diagnosis, the RNC made no attempt to inform donors who had attended the extended, indoor fundraiser with McDaniel."

2218,"Additionally, once nursing home outbreaks were established as a risk, precautions were implemented and adhered to across the country."
2219,Exposing people to the virus has been met with scorn and shame.
2220,All of these behaviours make transmission of ANY communicable disease much less likely.
2221,But our relatively mild climate throughout winter also helps.
2222,"There are few countries who can say that their citizens live in the same context and act accordingly, and that’s why I think that northern hemisphere nations should indeed be very concerned about winter and influenza outbreaks."

2228,"Good luck with that when the culture here is all about ""freedom""."
2229,And how long?
2230,It's probably bearable for 2 or 3 months but this virus is not going anywhere.

2252,"As for this reckless behavior I think if you or I or anyone else behaved the same, going out while still positive, not wearing a mask, creating a huge cluster at top level of the government...we would be prosecuted immediately."

2290,He really screwed over the restaurant industry over the summer by first allowing them to open indoors with a huge laundry list of requirements to maintain social distancing and then he shut down all indoor dining right after the restaurants spent a ton of money to meet his original demands.
2291,I think it would be OK to open Disneyland the same way Disney World was opened up in FL.
2292,"If it were really that dangerous, the hospitals in Orlando would have been completely overwhelmed by now and the general public would have took notice, in spite of whatever attempts that DeSantis would have done to cover things up."
2293,Personally I’m staying away from amusement parks until this pandemic is over.
2294,There’s just too many people for me and I would get fed up with having to wear a mask there for the entire day.

2302,I would recommend you self-isolate right away and reach out to your close contacts from the past two weeks to get tested.
2303,"Loss of smell is a highly specific indicated to Covid, more reliable than other symptoms, see https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/j4joco/loss_of_smell_a_highly_specific_indicator_of/ if it helps research also suggest that this particular symptom is associated with a milder disease course."

2319,People will also be eating and drinking at the park.
2320,You can’t guarantee they wash their hands.
2321,They then touch their mask constantly throughout the day.
2322,They then touch everything they come in contact with at the park.
2323,"People will be screaming and yelling on rides, and plenty of people have shitty masks."
2324,"The virus can travel much farther than 6 feet, especially if someone is screaming."
2325,I’d say the biggest issue will be bathrooms though.
2326,You have thousands of people all using the same small spaces- and lines for bathrooms were already an issue before this.
2327,"You also have to figure- a winery is going to be mostly adults, sitting in one location quietly."
2328,"A theme park will be entire families, most of which will have children."
2329,Children aren’t exactly known for their hygiene.
2330,"Children under the age of 2 aren’t even required to wear a mask, but that doesn’t mean they can’t spread it."

2346,"This is deeply saddening, especially when the best responses to this pandemic have been from female leaders (ex."

2348,"Also, quite a few public health agencies that are doing exceptionally well are headed by women."
2349,It's not safe to do so.

2351,I think they made the *right* decision.
2352,"1,184 cases from yesterday for a 5 million population, really bad."
2353,There were not human fetal stem cells anywhere in the process of this medication.
2354,"The company does other stuff with human fetal stem cells, but quite frankly there's nowhere to use them in this kind of treatment."
2355,You've been misled by people who have accidentally or purposely mistook the company using fetal stem cells to mean they were used in THIS treatment.
2356,"This treatment uses antibodies extracted from recovered covid patients and genetically modified mice, with pluripotent adult skin cells and chinese hamster ovaries as stepping stones."
2357,I'm kind of having USSR flashbacks
2358,We can help neighbouring countries with beds.
2359,Sure but a lot of people can work from home.
2360,Sending everyone home that is able to work from home seems like a pretty good solution
2361,just an additional 50% more to go!
2362,also how long does COVID immunity last?
2363,"It appears that if you have rising community spread and have any hope of retaining any K-12 in classrooms, you need to give up bars and eat-in restaurants."
2364,"(Of course if we’d united as a country by, say, May on observing public health protections, we’d likely be able to have kids safe in classrooms by now.)"
2365,Schools are going back in weeks.
2366,"I lost my mom in November in a nursing home to a ""mysterious lung illness"" that presented as pneumonia and the flu combined."

2371,Please use critical thought.
2372,So Sputnik IV huh guys?
2373,I live in Green Bay and am an essential working.
2374,I got covid back in July.

2377,People here are incredibly ignorant and refusing to wear masks.
2378,"Bars are packed, restaurants full..."
2379,I feel hopeless.
2380,Wait.
2381,"Tile does not tell the actual results which say:

&gt;... would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term."
2382,More deaths long term?
2383,Why??
2384,"Because:

&gt;  It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as **opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable** members of society 

And maybe because of this assumption in the model:

&gt; To predict policymaking, it is assumed that these interventions are implemented when demand for ICU beds reaches a particular “trigger” level."
2385,"So, if you do not protect vulnerable people, and you do not take action until too many people are sick, you will get more total deaths."
2386,"In Switzerland I only know like one person who died, and she was like 85 years old, the virus is extremely overrated and I myself and 14 other people I know catched it and we were sick for only a day or two

No one I know cares about covid, we do still wear masks though, as expected, which is a good idea, surely better than another lockdown"
2387,And who's fault that PPE was limited?Many countries did not have this issue.
2388,And Ebola still a big issue in Africa.
2389,Or are you saying that because it is mainly limited to Africa then it is not a big deal?
2390,"The lethality of covid is constantly being downgraded and there are plenty of infectious disease more deadly than Covid, Such as TB."

2497,"If you disagree with that, you disagree with health experts."
2498,But that doesn't seem to be what you have a problem with.
2499,Your larger point appears to be driven by your lack of education in how to interpret large datasets.
2500,That's not an insult by the way; most people don't spend their entire career having to make sense out of huge sets of data.
2501,"I have, so I'll explain WHY case counts are important."
2502,This new surge started at the last week of August.
2503,"Hospitilizations, per our health experts, lag about 2 weeks behind new cases, and deaths lag about 4 weeks behind new cases on average."
2504,"That means, that the hospitilizations and deaths because of the Utah County surge have only just begun."
2505,"Conversely, Salt Lake County's hospitilizations and deaths are largely driven by the surge we saw after Memorial day."
2506,"That is, if you look at OVERALL numbers, you're comparing a surge that has already come under control to one that is still rapidly developing."
2507,This developing surge will obviously affect the numbers for both counties.
2508,"When you look at this data, you should see new case count as a predictor for future hospitilizations, and new hospitilizations as a predictor for deaths."
2509,"You're looking at those and saying ""well yeah, but we WERE doing so good!"""
2510,And I agree.
2511,"Up until the surge in late August, Utah County had been doing pretty good!"
2512,"It wasn't because they were wearing masks because by all local accounts, they weren't, but there was relatively little community spread."
2513,"Now, however, there is uncontrolled community spread and those that are worried because of the high daily case count are fearing what hospitilizations and deaths will look like in the coming weeks."
2514,"And lastly, I don't care about your club arguments because literally no one is condoning that behavior."
2515,Literally no one is starting fights on airplanes over that behavior.
2516,Literally no one is claiming that not going to the club is causing them to pass out.

2520,"True that I'm stating some opinions on WHY I think Utah County was susceptible to a spike in cases, but that's largely besides the point (hence the fly shit in the pepper comment)."
2521,"The point is that they have a spike in cases that, if not taken seriously, is going to run the county into a huge increase in hospitilizations and deaths."
2522,Ignoring that because you've been relatively unaffected so far is just dangerous.

2721,I had a very similar experience going from the Bay Area to my mom's house in a rural Trump-loving area near Tahoe.
2722,There's a strong correlation between the two.

2729,"My dick will fall off."""
2730,I cannot believe this is real
2731,So there was no nationwide shut down?
2732,And no travel shut down between states?
2733,Therefore making staggered lockdowns pointless.
2734,You realize this isn't a vaccine right?
2735,This is a treatment.
2736,We're totally fucked if all 330 million citizens need this.
2737,I can certainly wear a mask out in public and socially distance from people indefinitely.
2738,So can everyone.
2739,People who act like it's difficult drive me nuts.
2740,"&gt; deaths are staying low for now

Maybe in terms of hard numbers, but you have to look at growth as well."
2741,"I don't know why everyone is satisfied that ""deaths are still low"" in NL when Oct. 6/7/8 saw 70 dead and the equivalent time in September saw 3."
2742,"This is not a good trend, and it is not improving."
2743,"Covid is a public health problem, and not some sort of biological attack."

2757,"It was though, plus people arriving from other European countries, clubs were open, the masks weren't mandated outside, people stopped social distancing."

2764,I mean your surrounded by water.... just need some good pumps and your good to extinguish any fire
2765,How in the fuck did that happen?
2766,Approved of a vaccine BEFORE the US.
2767,I’m not entirely sure what is going on with the FDA but it seems like they keep putting roadblocks in to prevent the vaccine from being approved of before the election ie whatever is happening with the Oxford one and why EU/Canada have a rolling approval.
2768,When theFDAshould just follow the science.
2769,"If the data is there approve it, if not don’t."
2770,"Ah, sounds like it’s very dependent on the type of positions."

2777,"Releasing numbers everyday, showing how many are in ICU, hospitals etc."
2778,"Overall, I'm very pleased woth my countries overall reaction to corona, compared to other much wealthier and more powerful countries."
2779,How did this happen?
2780,I thought they had a vaccine?
2781,/s
2782,We are.
2783,Testing capacity has just massively increased.
2784,Hospitals are fine.
2785,There's no strain on capacity.
2786,We're seeing the true number of infections in the data now.
2787,In March/April we only saw a fraction of the true number of infections in the testing data.
2788,100 000 true infections per day is manageable and society can stay open.
2789,Much more widespread than it would have been with proper access to mental health services.
2790,It's a shame you loners have no critical thinking skills.

2794,"I don’t know which of my claims you are referring to but there WERE provider shortages in NY, which is why my friend went."

2798,Better hope you never have a fire or medical emergency on that island.
2799,"Back in April/May, as I said, states locked down."
2800,In the US policy like that is made at the state level.
2801,"There's plenty of pro-lockdown posts who said we should've just shut the entire country down, if you can't hunt them down then you're clearly new here."

2849,[removed]
2850,Aww yeah!
2851,Im a healthcare worker.
2852,Inject me with that shit!
2853,This isn't true.
2854,There are many strains of the flue with new ones every year.
2855,But everyone getting the shot could possibly eliminate some individual strains.
2856,I guess you are conceding again that it’s not scientifically proven.
2857,But your question is a false dichotomy.
2858,"“Fur from the dead infected animals will be processed to remove any traces of the virus and then used for coats and other garments, according to Fur Commission USA, a mink farming trade group."
2859,"The U.S. produces more than 3 million mink pelts each year.”
Imagine seeing a guy in a full hazmat suit processing the limited edition 2020 Covid-mink fur."
2860,That’s not what op said
2861,"Reality is this has been going on for years and will continue to go this way for anything back office related to AP/AR, payroll, shared services is getting offshored to india, costa rica, portugal you name it."
2862,"The things that will not go away though are still going to be customer facing roles as well as roles that are more analytical in nature (even those that are considered ""back office"" support functions)."
2863,I can guarantee you they aren't outsourcing FPNA consolidations that are bound by GAAP and SEC filing requirements etc.
2864,"But I can guarantee you that all orgs are looking to outsource things that are deemed ""easy"" and repetitive."
2865,"There was an attempt to do this as well on the development side, but companies soon realized it took more time to fix the issues that were  arising because the offshore people can literally only do things based on a decision tree, don't ask them to analyze or make a call on something."
2866,I feel like some comments below contradict the rest of the thread.
2867,"On the one hand, people say it's highly contagious, on the other, they thing lockdowns were enough for China to get rid of the disease, even though it didn't work anywhere else."
2868,Why do we have to pretend that China's #s are accurate?
2869,"I have no skin in the game, but they are obviously wrong."
2870,Why can't we just accept it and move on?
2871,&gt;Men are hardwired to be expendable.
2872,Few people talk about closing the workplace fatality gap.
2873,25 certainly sounds more reasonable than 100 if the goal is to encourage test candidates.
2874,Okay ExplainittomelikeIamfive...cloth masks emit particles.
2875,Do the fibers stop being emitted after being washed?
2876,"Help please what is the takeaway for me, a cloth mask user?"
2877,In BC they did.
2878,"Masks are ""encouraged"" for elementary kids, heavily suggested if not mandatory for junior high and highschool."
2879,My sister and a friend both worth in elementary schools in different districts.
2880,The young children are not wearing masks.
2881,It's pandemonium.
2882,"My sister's been healthy so far (tiny country school on the Island), but my teacher friend (bigger school in a small city) is out for two weeks sick (tested negative) and a lot of teachers are falling ill too."
2883,They're so incredibly stressed out and it's only October.
2884,"Uncounted covid deads, i'm pretty sure."
2885,"A lot of deaths are being revised and added to the total log, like in my city Manaus that was one of the first cities most affected in Brazil, 100 deaths were added one day and the State didn't say anything until the media asked wtf happened."
2886,"We have a lot of deaths counted as SARS, because in the beggining we couldn't afford to test the already deceased, mostly because our healthcare collapsed in the first wave."
2887,"A source for those deaths in Manaus (in portuguese):
 https://d24am.com/coronavirus-no-amazonas/estado-omite-mortes-por-covid-e-fvs-admite/

Translation: ""The record log of deaths by Covid-19 by the Government of Amazonas from March to September was incorrect."
2888,"About 24% of deaths were not recorded correctly, says The Intercept Brazil."""
2889,Haven't they even moved to ban homeschooling?
2890,Ludicrous.
2891,Thought I had found Carmen Sandiego at first
2892,We barely remember....
2893,because they are bordered on 2 sides by a country currently run by a cult.
2894,And they were much higher in March/April in France or New York.
2895,It's just extremely hard to compare.
2896,"You gotta look at hospitalizations, that's a more reliable number."
2897,Half my sons elementary school was out sick 2 weeks ago for 2 weeks because of the flu.
2898,"They let the kids take off their masks in class, let them wrestle with each other, and let them go massless outside while wrestling around on recess."
2899,"I've told my son not to dozens of times, but unless a teacher is there to enforce it, he isnt going to stop."
2900,This is in Canada btw.
2901,"Even if there are, nobody cares about the EU elections."
2902,Same.
2903,I’m ready!
2904,"I suppose but I don't see why they couldn't have closed down today to sanitize everything since it's Friday, just to be cautious."
2905,won't happen in canada unless they 100% stop travel to the states.
2906,otherwise some canadian yahoo will visit his american family in florida and bring back fresh rona for you.
2907,Universities can do as they wish so it's not on the government.
2908,If high school students are adults they should be able to act like adults and go to school and take all the precautions without becoming a breeding ground for the virus just like adults do at their workplace.
2909,"No, we're fine."
2910,And the U.S. also tests *significantly* more than France.
2911,"If their per capita test rates were the same as the U.S., their number would almost certainly be much bigger."
2912,Is that like when they used dialysis patients to estimate 10%?
2913,"Yeah, there’s nothing magical about being in a classroom as a “learning environment.”  In fact, it sometimes worse because there are a ton of distractions."
2914,It’s the expectations the teacher sets and how they follow through with those expectations that’s effective.
2915,No kid would rather write sentences than play.
2916,"I really do feel for parents, as I said."
2917,I know this sucks.
2918,"But there are too many who just find it too hard to get their kids to work, so they don’t."
2919,"WH staff took care of the grass more than Covid measures, even if all they did was pay a landscaping company"
2920,You’ve literally brought nothing new to the table that hasn’t been contested elsewhere on both sides in terms of science and you keep calling it “murder” like animals care if it is or it isn’t.
2921,"You’ve made no actual difference by being a vegan, you just want to act like you are a better person then me because it makes you feel better."
2922,I’m done here.
2923,"You’ve accomplished nothing, and killing an animal so I can eat it isn’t murder, you just want to use that human-engineered term and apply it to the animal kingdom."
2924,"Animals are alive and then they are not, they don’t have a concept of murder."
2925,"Running over an animal with a combine is way more frightening to them then humanely ending their existence, I can guarantee you, because I’ve seen it."
2926,"But me trying to convince a vegan of this is obviously like trying to reach the moon with my own hand, so I’m just done."
2927,"The US is a big, diverse country, so it’s hard to make blanket statements about hospitalizations."
2928,Wisconsin is right now setting up a field hospital because their hospitals are filling up and I believe Idaho is sending COVID cases to other states because they have no beds.
2929,Clearly there are hotspots and a lot of hospitals will have a bigger problem once flu season is fully upon us.
2930,What I'm more concerned is the virus setting my stamina back.
2931,I've recently been running my best average time per mile and my goal is to do a triathlon next year.
2932,If covid fucks my lungs up im gonna be pissed.
2933,Its so fucked up here.

2941,I'm sure this won't be cherry picked for anti mask motives
2942,Hard to prevent the entire rest of the US from infecting them

2944,These findings seem to apply to HOMEMADE cotton masks.
2945,Not commercial masks.
2946,Bait.
2947,"I've had trouble re-finding the source (sorry), but 0.022% IFR for Seasonal Influenza is what I read - which would make COVID more than 20x deadlier."
2948,Maybe it was in the H1N1 data that /u/Compsky mentions below...
2949,What makes interactions at school so dangerous but not your own interactions?
2950,As I understand it schools are wearing masks and enforcing social distancing.
2951,Do you wear masks and socially distance when you have family dinners?
2952,Because if not then that actually seems like a more high risk scenario to me.
2953,"Do you understand the term ""selection bias""?"
2954,Is that a foreign concept to you that you don't understand?
2955,I can explain it if you want.
2956,"more vitamin D in that sense, huh."
2957,Have fun with rising sea levels.
2958,Those islands have limited lifespan
2959,"U.S. has a much, much higher testing rate than France, like almost twice as high per capita according to Statista numbers posted today."
2960,"If anything, France's numbers could be higher."
2961,the best time of Christie's governorship was the time he was out of state.
2962,"man, we have had a string of awful governors in my lifetime."
2963,Christie and Murphy are actually the 2 best we've had.
2964,Ever dookie and sneeze?
2965,"Which is bizarre to me because that very act is politicizing it, even as they keep saying they won’t let the science get politicized"
2966,"I'm living in an area that is more GOP leaning, so the ""recall Newsom"" posters are out en masse, and all over Nextdoor."
2967,"While I wouldn't go to Disneyland during this pandemic, I understand how ""the responsible"" people would like to reopen a beloved area to gather -- much like it has reopened in Tokyo and Florida."
2968,What *is* wrong is NOT having a set of guidelines that would allow for opening.
2969,"Without a set of published guidelines, Disneyland has no hope to reopen, and it's all at the whim of Newsom."
2970,"The fact that the Governor has been allowed this much power (see other states with this fight), should concern citizens of CA."
2971,"Disneyland and Knotts *want* to reopen, people *want* to go there, and others will simply avoid the areas altogether."
2972,"Newsom needs to publish a guide that would allow for these parks to have some hint of what it would take to reopen, both internally within the park, and externally in the city/county."
2973,What is the status of the Sputnik V vaccine?
2974,"It was approved months ago, do we have widespread data on safety &amp; efficacy yet?"
2975,Toxic masculinity ruins the party again.
2976,"On March 30th, NYS had 9,298 positive cases, but they also had a 49.9% positivity rate."
2977,There was about two weeks when the positivity rate was &gt; 40%.
2978,"Lots of missed cases, obviously, because of not enough testing."
2979,Cumulative numbers since the beginning is meaningless.
2980,Cumulative numbers last 14 days shows the trend and daily cases shows the current situation.
2981,We are now experiencing wave 2 so it is basically meaningless to include numbers from March.
2982,"Additionally, most every country is now on the same level of preparedness whereas at the beginning some were taken by surprise or didn't have efficient testing which skewed the numbers one way or the other."
2983,"(I realize many places are still fucking it all up)

100k is better than one million because that's how basically all official health institutions show case rates."
2984,"It's fine to use 1 million, but 100k is the norm."
2985,"Just saying, if you want a picture of the current situation, which I believe most people want, you should use 14 day or daily cases."
2986,I never understood the desire for testing.
2987,All that matters is if people are getting sick.
2988,"If you aren't sick, it doesn't matter if you are infected or not."
2989,The only thing that really needs tracking is your local hospital.
2990,"If your ICUs aren't full, there's no problem."
2991,"Somebody should nominate Putin for the Noble Peace Prize when the count reaches 20,000 per day, can't invade countries if all your soldier
are sick or dying - Peace ta da."
2992,One of the proposed guidelines that got leaked last week was a residency limit of 120 miles in order to attend.
2993,"I don’t think that’s an unreasonable restriction at all, although it definitely has hurt some people, so take it for what it is."
2994,"That said, the idea that travel would be allowed given this kind of a guideline, especially cents reservations would be required ahead of time, is technically a non-issue."
2995,"If you saw me wearing it, you wouldn't think cool."
2996,Those number look pretty low to me.
2997,[This](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32180-9/fulltext) meta-analysis of 24 different studies came up with 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) and [this](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/estimating-the-infection-fatality-ratio-in-england/) English study says 0.49% using one data source and 0.3% using another.
2998,"[Sweden](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/53c0dc391be54f5d959ead9131edb771/infection-fatality-rate-covid-19-stockholm-technical-report.pdf) reported 0.6%, and as of mid-August the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19) is still listing 0.5 - 1%."
2999,Seems like they don’t have a Mac mittens either
3000,"They didn't want to jam, so no slam"
3001,[removed]
3002,"It's closer to 0.03%, but yes, the idea is the same."
3003,Covid is about 1 order of magnitude more deadly than the flu.
3004,I'm confused.
3005,Is there any research that confirms that cotton masks do stop small particles?
3006,"If you reject my advice, you're rejecting *science*; that is, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Offit, that Spanish doctor on MarketWatch..."
3007,Sad for you :(
3008,1%?
3009,Where’d you get that fucked up number from?
3010,"Those “most at risk” just means they’re more than likely going to die if they catch it because I’m 39 with Asthma, I had it and did not need to go to the hospital, I pretty much coasted right through it."
3011,"My husband on the other hand, who’s 41 without Asthma, was in the hospital for 8 days, doing extremely poorly at one point, unable to get his o2 saturation above 80%."
3012,Then almost the exact same story as his with one of our female friends who is also 39.
3013,We can’t just protect those “most at risk.” It’s clear that everyone’s immune system acts completely different.
3014,Unless you’re Donald Trump.
3015,"Covid makes him feel 20 years younger, of course."
3016,"Corona related to your popular belief, in contrast to Russia most of the US needs to check their bank account before deciding to even go to a doctor when faced with mild symptoms."
3017,It actually looks like a very shrewd business move to me.
3018,"If their revolutionary technology works, what better publicity could you get than to open it up to anyone that wants to use it, helping broadly prove its effectiveness and acceptance and getting to play the ""hero"" of the pandemic."
3019,They're then maintaining rights to that technology for future vaccines so they can bank on that improved publicity and exposure to push them to the forefront for future vaccine purchases.
3020,I wonder if they'll \*really\* be enforcing this.
3021,Even in certain neighborhoods that have been flouting that rule since the beginning and recently had a protest about it?
3022,I'm doubtful tbh.
3023,"It's hard not to compare after months of ""lol stupid Americans, Europe already beat this."""
3024,"(I'm not saying we're doing a great job here, btw.)"
3025,"The Lancet is under no obligation to publish something like this, I'm sure there are a million opinions from a million scientists that they would refuse to publish, because they don't advance the discussion, or at least not an acceptable way, which this doesn't."

3201,This is why it’s important to not make up a stance for the person you’re talking to.
3202,Canada’s health care is ran on tax payers money.
3203,While we hear good things about vaccines the truth is we don’t know how far we are away from one.
3204,If we go through 2021 with the virus and shut downs that’ll be two years in a row the hospitals have lost money due to shut downs and that’ll effect 2023.
3205,Hospitals are currently fine since most Canadians were working in 2019 and paid taxes.
3206,However their budget for 2021 will probably be cut a bit since most people were out of work in spring.

3230,This does not seem convincing.
3231,&gt; This number was significantly lower than that during the same period in 2018 due to a reduction in coronial autopsy requests following sudden natural deaths (appendix).
3232,"We're taking a small subset of deaths and autopsying them, and noting that many fewer autopsies are being requested."
3233,And even then it's a sample of 67.
3234,Why aren't we doing this with every death in a target area and getting a representative sample?
3235,It would not be hard.
3236,"But nobody asked us (John Radcliffe Hospital, in this case) to do it so we aren't."

3274,There's enough of an increase in hospitalizations that it's starting to get concerning.

3277,Bob Chapek is an asshole.
3278,Everyone hates that guy.
3279,So you mainly wear a mask to prevent others from getting sick vs you wear a mask to not to get sick.
3280,So for the flu it should be ...alway?
3281,Regardless of how many deaths.
3282,If you have anything contagious or even potentially contagious you should wear a mask if staying home really is not an option.
3283,"I was sort of excited when this first started happening thinking at least the silver lining is that people are going to have leftover masks, so surely they will wear them then they get sick later."
3284,I now see this won’t be the case.
3285,My grandma died from the flu and would have been %100 preventable if someone had just wore a mask even though it was “just a silly simple cold”.
3286,Or just stayed at home honestly.

3289,I tried wearing one before when I was sick.

3348,They like Putin because they hate what American liberalism did to their country.
3349,It made them weak and poorer than dirt.
3350,"Unfortunately, their alternative to liberalism is the same as America’s: fascism."
3351,Communism isn’t on the menu anymore.
3352,ya i seen people spit into it before the pandemic no way im drinking from it during one lmao

3354,"&gt; 100mbps bidirectional 

We don't all work at OnlyFans."
3355,"Stop projecting dickhead, I have proof for my worldview, you clearly don't."
3356,The best is when they try to explain their “logic” for doing so.
3357,I do my best to allow the following sounds to just flow in one ear and out the other w/o making any pit stops along the way.
3358,Their idea of “freedom” is fundamentally flawed.
3359,"What it actually is is “selfishness.”  
They want to do whatever they please with no regard to the impact it has on others."
3360,We know what not wearing a mask does to others of course.
3361,These jerks believe that not wearing a seat belt will only serve to help them as they will be thrown away from the wreck.
3362,How about no - I’d rather not have a 150lb+ 50 mph meat bag slam into me from behind?
3363,Wow!!
3364,Nice work.
3365,That deserves its own post.
3366,Thanks for sharing.
3367,Looks like 'most cases' will be totally red pretty soon apart from Nevada which i guess is externally influenced.
3368,Putin's vaccine did not work after all
3369,Are you comparing covid-19 to the common cold?
3370,You sound like a Donny supporter.
3371,Yes.
3372,And many packed.
3373,Edit: and we have probably the last weekend of warm weather.
3374,There will be people throwing parties everywhere.
3375,Neighbors already setting one up.
3376,Will not be attending.
3377,"The risk of infection here is so trivial that for our purposes it’s basically zero, like yes technically there’s a chance but it’s so far below 1% that it’s not worth talking about"
3378,it's about slowing it down.
3379,lockdowns are not necessary until they are.
3380,Maskup
3381,They're packing the hospitals alright
3382,"I applied ""work ethic"" from my love of League towards getting a career and after 2 years got a break and never looked back

Specifically, I ended up going back to school (MBA) and then made friends and got a career."
3383,"Getting into a good program wasn't easy and required studying, persistence, and luck."
3384,"Additionally, getting in was only the first hurdle and I had to go way outside my comfort zone with many nights of self-doubt."
3385,I also had to learn to stop blaming others for my troubles.
3386,"I had a shitty, ultra-religious  upbringing that set me behind, but ultimately people didn't care - they saw me as I was."
3387,May be try drinking food?
3388,That can go down easier.
3389,"Stuff like  pured soups, smoothies or protein shakes."
3390,"Chugging that down is easier then eating a ""real meal"" but still can have good nutrition."
3391,"&gt; Btw, one of their accomplishments is helping to eradicate Polio in Nigeria."
3392,... and setting off a vaccine-induced polio outbreak too :)
3393,Russia isn't communist.
3394,It's run by a small number of insanely powerful oligarchs.
3395,Daily deaths approaching the same numbers that put us in a national lockdown originally.
3396,"I know a lot of people say we can't afford to have another, but I would not be surprised to see a full lockdown imposed again within the next couple of weeks."
3397,"Bro, you didn’t offer a counterpoint."
3398,You’re just telling people not to get their news from someplace.
3399,I understand that you’re one of the easily brainwashed ones.
3400,But you need to understand that not everybody else is going to be so simple-minded.
3401,"Please, state your argument."
3402,"Otherwise, take your brainwashing and go back with the window lickers."
3403,"Are you okay, dude?"
3404,Maybe some anger management?
3405,That's a proper Czech and balance.
3406,"Every time Evers has tried to do something sensible, the Republican death cult has done everything it could to stop him."
3407,"I hear the justification that ""I'm only hanging out with other young people"" all the time.... Like you can choose who gets ultimately infected if you're the one passing it on!?."
3408,They think it just stops with the other young people they hung out with.
3409,"Then the virus just disappears, no one else affected"
3410,Maybe.
3411,Look at India - pushing 90K cases a few weeks ago and no real bump in deaths.
3412,It's almost like 1K a month is the ceiling.
3413,And with the shit that’s gone on all summer what makes you think the US’s numbers are accurate at all?
3414,This made me chuckle.
3415,"They just had, 2 weeks ago, an F1 race with a full crowd."
3416,They did this despite the recommendation from the FIA to not do this.
3417,But Russia just had to pack the race track.
3418,That’s what happened everywhere.
3419,"And even knowing this, this will continue to happen."

3430,"Says ""we can't live in fear""."
3431,Lots of people in my area just doing whatever
3432,”Kids” is the wrong term.
3433,University students in Sweden (the ones they talk about here) are 20-25+ years old.
3434,"Yup, no verification needed."
3435,"14,000 “health experts” wouldn’t be that stupid."
3436,Well no kidding.
3437,Most older people are fully aware of the second part of that and are trying to avoid it.
3438,As someone who lives in Japan I'm concerned about what a sudden influx of Chinese tourists might do.
3439,"Numbers are still way up (especially in Tokyo), the health system is still strained and China haven't exactly been transparent with their reporting."
3440,Will be interesting to see how much the numbers fluctuate when this comes into effect.
3441,"&gt; voluntarily 

I see where it went wrong."
3442,Incredibly selfish of the D to allow this stuff to occur.
3443,No respect.
3444,"Ok, well 1.4 million dead is even easier then."
3445,Peanuts.
3446,I hear Joe biden wears a big-ass mask.
3447,You can see it a mile away.
3448,Funny how he hasn't gotten sick
3449,"Hmmm, infection rates going up, fatalities going down."
3450,Seems the weak have already succumbed.
3451,Time to start living normal.
3452,"Kids do not go to colleges and universities, you have adults there."
3453,Young adults but adults nonetheless.
3454,That’s like your average Florida day xd
3455,Good.
3456,Ive been going clubbing in china every week for 5 months and no one I know has gotten it
3457,Must be nice
3458,You seriously believe in the chinese figures?
3459,Woah that's crazy.
3460,"Same thing happening in UK - a confirmed case in a workplace, but the rules are everyone else carry on until you get symptoms."
3461,What's the point of even testing if you have direct long contact with a confirmed case/high suspicion and can't get a test before returning to work/the public?
3462,"At least where I live it's 1/3rd the number of people as Berlin, with wide pavements and forest nearby when I want to get outside."
3463,Hardly anyone wears a mask outside indoor spaces but there is space to keep distance.
3464,We have lots of parks and open spaces so while people gather outside I find it easy to avoid them.
3465,We are so lucky in that regard...I just cycle out of the city into nature and only interact with people when I go to the supermarket.
3466,"By the time I finish work in London I'm so ready to not have to deal with other people and their often bad decisions and look forward to the quiet and calm of my hermit life in Germany 🤦‍♀️

I hope you and yours keep safe through all of this!"
3467,Epidemiology says he got it from the Trump cluster if not Trump himself.
3468,"And the latter is possible, even logical."
3469,"Spain has one of the worst economies in Europe and are quite dependent on tourism, not good at all for the people right now and on to the future"
3470,Hey Bill.
3471,Really sick of hearing from ya man.
3472,Let’s stop giving this guy a platform to discuss our health shall we.
3473,He’s a POS...with more influence over our health than any one man should ever have.
3474,I meant to say arent.
3475,That's it?
3476,Funny how communist Russia behaves a lot like Trump's USA!
3477,Is seasonal affective disorder real?
3478,Oki
3479,"It says 12 and goes.. 


""China""

""and the other 11 include Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia""


That's 8 total - Where's the rest dammit you article!"
3480,/r agelikemilk
3481,A lot of European countries have been lying about their numbers.
3482,Just look at excess deaths.
3483,Figures.
3484,Probably an edgy teenager by the sound of it.
3485,I'm sure you know what's the context - the agency is useless and dangerous.
3486,Plenty of serology testing showing very high infection rates.
3487,"So while the CFR is high due to selection bias, the IFR is thought to be much lower then .5%

Also there is very good and a long trend of data on influenza."
3488,The IFR is pretty well known.
3489,If he’s not in an ICU by tomorrow then I think he’ll be fine.
3490,I read somewhere that COVID tends to hit hard around day 9.
3491,So if in a day or two he’s still running around I’m ok with believing he fended it off.
3492,all they had to do was wear masks during services and add some air purifiers and ventilate the rooms to cut the number of infections down.
3493,"&amp;#x200B;

but these people are selfish."
3494,I used to hate driving through their neighborhoods in the past.
3495,sometimes they would literally stand in the middle of the street talking to each other and blocking traffic like they owned the roads
3496,"It tends to be wealthier NYC-dwellers who mostly realized they didn't like being cooped up for months on end in tiny apartments...plenty of them moved out to Suffolk and Nassau on Long Island, where home prices are going for upwards sometimes of 50k above what homes in that area should be selling for."
3497,"I'm from the area, and my sister does mortgages for a financial institution in Suffolk, and it's insane what is going on in the LI home market."
3498,Agreed.
3499,It’s probably just a matter of time.
3500,"If you think the policy is retarded, just boycott the restaurant."

3510,"I really believe that with a vaccine program up and running, reopening Broadway at limited capacity in june is doable"
3511,"Could have sworn they had a vaccine that putin took......

&amp;#x200B;

So i take it they just didn't give it to their citizens or straight up lied?"
3512,The government number is official but the ONS is using tests outside of hospital settings to estimate the number of infections.
3513,"Not everyone has symptoms and even some with symptoms do not get a test, so there is an estimation requirement there."
3514,The official number of confirmed cases yesterday was 17540 up from 14162 on Wednesday.
3515,"The good news (if we can call it that) is the testing capacity is 10 times what it was in April so these numbers may look much higher than the ""first wave"" but more tests are being done."
3516,The numbers may have been a lot closer if we had the same testing capacity then.
3517,I live in a suburb.
3518,"Wearing a mask was a hassle the first week or two, now it's just habit."

3522,It is way way too hard for Americans.
3523,"Take HIV, universal testing, condom use and needle exchanges would eradicate it in the US (as would Treatment as Prevention and PrEP)... but its too much money and people have ""moral"" objections."
3524,I thought they announced it was approved back in August
3525,TBH the curriculum for my year is completely superfluous aside from a basic understanding of how the earth's systems work...they won't see that information again unless they decide to pursue geology/meteorology in college.
3526,"What they WILL need is the ability to cite evidence, find sources that are reliable and reputable, be able to defend a position that they take, and understand that it's OK to not have all the answers."
3527,"Also, I have the luxury of making that statement ONLY because my year does not go through standardized testing, and thus my job isn't dependent on them rote memorizing things."

3530,No shit?
3531,I know.

3535,Was that the context?
3536,Diseases hate this one cool trick.
3537,indeed.
3538,why is that remarkable.
3539,Surely death is death.
3540,Most of the people dying of covid  had co morbidities and are ederly.

Look at the two awards it was given too."
3564,They do that whenever the bought upvotes can’t counteract the organic downvotes

3592,"i live in the west, 10 minuets by car to Remscheid."
3593,i'm really worried about that situation.
3594,Remscheid was one of the first ones with more than 50 infection the last 7 days.
3595,i know a Single mother who lives with her girl(4years) in a smal flat.
3596,her kid is sick for a couple of weeks now.

3600,makes no sense for me.

3603,"they don't really have a plan to handle shit like this and they are not consequent at all...
stay save my friend😷"
3604,Or self immolation
3605,What happened is that it's a virus that is teaching a lesson to humans.
3606,"Western Europe tried to erradicate the virus on summer, unfortunately that's kind of impossible, they should've learned how to live with the virus instead."
3607,"But no, they locked down, restricted liberties, in a way to give the world a lesson on how they are efficient."
3608,"Well, there are things that we as humans cannot do, and fully controlling this virus is one of them."

3627,"The ""suspected"" was probably just an allergy."
3628,"To be honest, I don't know how similar an allergy can be to a cold, I just suspect they were because I had fever, cough, body aches, etc to varying degrees"
3629, A lot of the quality sucked and projects had to be scrapped and redone locally.
3630,"Many years ago, the prevailing conclusion was that it was better to just outsource testing and documentation."
3631,"However, in recent years the quality has been improving but so has the costs."
3632,This is causing outsourcing to different countries and the cycle is starting over.
3633,I'm in college in Ontario and my classes are split.
3634,I have stuff online which is great but I have other classes including a computer class and health and safety which are in-person.
3635,For the computer one it seems like a huge oversight that we need to be in class to use computers for work but at the same time our other classes are online because we have computers at home.
3636,"It doesn't help that when asked our teacher mentioned he asked for it to be in-person because it's ""just easier""."
3637,With younger students though I think the big reason most people aren't doing online is because of needing someone to watch their kids especially if they still work in an office.
3638,To combat that I think we'll see a jump in the number of people who use babysitters.
3639,If your 10 year old can't stay home alone for school and your next door neighbour in high school is doing class online too might as well just get them to babysit.
3640,You're mixing bubbles but it's not as bad as 30 students per-class times however many classes going on at once.
3641,"they are we just got locked down in Toronto, ottawa and Toronto peel area."
3642,I think Quebec is already shut down in Montreal
3643,They did shows in March though.
3644,Their last show was in Portland on like March 15th or 16th.
3645,So he performed with it or the symptoms?
3646,Not really.
3647,The most common co-morbidity for coronavirus is high blood pressure.
3648,"Over 75 years of age, more than three-quarters of that population has high blood pressure."
3649,"So yes, the people who died had co-morbidities."
3650,The people who lived also had co-morbidities.
3651,"Either way, by the time a co-morbidity affects most of the population then the average life expectancy isn't much affected."
3652,"I do feel like everyone who makes this argument is basically saying that by the time people reach the average life expectancy they're living on borrowed time, which is a wild take on statistics to begin with."
3653,"So people work all their lives to (maybe) retire at 70, and then... what?"
3654,"It's fine if they die, because they have less life to lose?"
3655,It's a weird stance.
3656,"Which reveal that people like the one you replied to are full of shit, a lot of western countries actually report numbers that are very close to what excess death statistics tell us."
3657,"Look at Germany for instance, the excess deaths match the coronavirus deaths almost perfectly during the first wave (the biggest difference was actually much lower numbers of deaths than usual before the country was hit with covid) and the RKI (the german CDC) was very honest with the public in part by using excess death statistics to figure out how accurate their numbers are."
3658,"This sub really needs to take off its aluminium foil hats every once in a while, clearly not every country is lying about their numbers."
3659,"Or maybe they just can't handle the fact that their own country fucked this up so badly, and now they're projecting."

3679,"I had great seats bought, 2 nights at a 5-star hotel (a total splurge) ... this Covid thing is a real bummer :("
3680,I'm in France and me and both my parents got tested positive.
3681,It sucks and my chest hurts : (
3682,Are universities open like in UK?
3683,"Double quarter pounder with cheese, large fries, and a large sweet tea."
3684,Two apple pies for dessert
3685,"maybe that's a blessing then, maybe the rich will finally try and help with climate change so they don't loose their island paradises."
3686,"Been there, done that three times."
3687,I'm happy in Germany these days.
3688,"US can top that, there are states with more than 2k cases daily."
3689,When every state had 4k daily cases it would be much higher summed up.
3690,"There was a statistically significant difference in mortality for patients on low oxygen though, a 70% reduction."
3691,Havent seen too much Empathy about American lives on Reddit dont know what youre talkimg about
3692,"Yea, my brain know it's plural but I can't come to terms with it."
3693,K shaped recovery incoming
3694,Not sure that you understand how this works.
3695,Thousands did get covid and still counting.
3696,Do you not think that Sturgis could have seeded the countless outbreaks in the surrounding areas?
3697,"Let's say, hypothetically, only 1 person out of the whole rally had covid while there."
3698,That 1 person then believes that this is a hoax and/or that real men don't wear masks.
3699,They then party on through the rally with others who feel the same way.
3700,Now we have a bar or two or three where the virus has been seeded and begins its long period of incubation.
3701,"At the end of the rally, that group of people then travel across the towns and areas to go back home after having a great weekend at the rally."
3702,"They don't believe in precautions, so they interact as normal with everyone along the way (i.e."
3703,"gas stations, diners, dive bars, food stores, maybe a parts shop or two)."
3704,"The people working at and visiting those same places have all now been seeded, and the cycle continues."
3705,"Now, due to the beliefs, ignorance, and selfishness of the original starting group, they are most definitely not going to cooperate with any form of contact tracing (because muh freedoms), therefor we have no actual data to work with."
3706,"In the absence of data, we look at what makes sense from a scientific perspective based on other available statistics."
3707,Does any of the above sound like an unrealistic scenario to you?
3708,"In my mind, that's the least worst case scenario of what most likely happened here."
3709,Yes automatically.
3710,"You can be part of the 72% that is concerned and still think the benefits of in person schooling outweigh the risk of corona, but any rational adult should recognize corona is a danger."
3711,&gt; The biggest issue would be hurricanes.
3712,True.
3713,That just adds an even greater fear about living on an island.
3714,I live in New York City but unfortunately I'm not wealthy and I have to stay.
3715,the reason New Yorkers have left New York is not because of living in apartments and being cooped up.
3716,Rich people have vacation homes for that.
3717,The city is riddled with violence and homeless people.
3718,It is not safe to walk on the street or take the subway.
3719,The Democrats of the city have ruined it.
3720,many companies have also decided that it is not safe for their employees to travel to and from the city so they have also decided to move away.
3721,Politicians want to blame coronavirus.
3722,But their policies have been putting the city in a downward spiral for a while now.
3723,Corona virus just fast-tracked it a little bit.
3724,And also gave them a scapegoat.
3725,"Even worse, bars are closed but can turn into an restaurant to stay open."
3726,Are dialysis patients representative of the population as a whole?
3727,You know that they are not.
3728,"What is your political bias, here?"
3729,Discos were opened for a month or so in summer and they shut them down around august 15th because of a few outbreaks.
3730,Not the smartest move to open them.
3731,"There once was a study that schools are safe, but can it be possible that there are asymptomatic who spread it?"
3732,Schools cannot be the only cause.
3733,Or forgetting it was men with guns who willfully licked Hitler's boots &amp; wanted to be good lil' nazi boys.
3734,"See this is what I don't get about you guys, if they're already lying about it why the hell would they publish numbers as high as this?"
3735,"If you're already lying, if you're already controlling the narrative that much, why not just report numbers that actually make you look good?"
3736,Makes no sense.
3737,"I am predicting at least one million new cases a day, worldwide, by Christmas."
3738,I live in downstate Illinois and virus is going through my workplace.
3739,"The funny thing was the first person who came down with it in April was treated like they had a death sentence - daily updates from the bosses, thoughts and prayers and the like."
3740,We've had like 50 people get it since then with most not showing any symptoms so now it's become boring and commonplace.
3741,The last one to get diagnosed on Wednesday was even asked to take a computer home and keep up with her workload from home.
3742,I find it interesting that perception can change so quickly in such a short time.
3743,This is the exact reason why it’s getting so bad.
3744,Take it up with my wife.
3745,She insists on it.
3746,"note: she's also ok with ""dump""."
3747,Yes.
3748,I did an experiment.
3749,I tried to shoot a can 6 feet away with a squirt gun.
3750,It hit the can and knocked it over.
3751,I tried again through a cotton mask and I didn't even hit th can.
3752,"Since there obviously aren't ""mask police"" to inspect everyone's mask the idea is enough people will use ones that are good enough to help reduce the overall amount of particles in the air and in turn help lower the overall transmission rate."
3753,"Yes, some people are wearing thin single layer fabric that isn't doing a great job."
3754,It's still better than nothing
3755,"The 10pm curfew, the masks in supermarkets basically replacing social distancing."
3756,To name a few.
3757,yes that is what i said
3758,"Yeah, definitely concerned here with my kids in daycare."
3759,"They're wearing masks and such, and it's not very deadly to kids, so I think socializing is better than no corona."
3760,Not to mention working from home becomes possible to be productive.
3761,They're still taking on significant risk of getting it though.
3762,It's a shitty situation for a parent to make the call though.
3763,It's very doubtful that it's 70% with social distancing as it is now.
3764,"But one out of every five people is immune, it's that much harder to spread to virus."
3765,"Especially since they're probably some of the most ""out and about"" people in the city anyway."
3766,NAD+ declines over time with age.
3767,Covid-19 appears to dysregulate it and decrease it.
3768,The hypothesis is that supplements might help.
3769,NAD+ is widely available due to its believed anti-aging function.
3770,"USA is rural too, especially the mid west."
3771,How do you explain Viatnem then?
3772,Rump is so cringe.
3773,[removed]
3774,The people elected 2-4 years ago are the ones setting/approving policies that are directly affecting the rate of spread in each state.
3775,"Ok, let me tell you this then, 

If you are trying to see if someone had the virus, the people most likely to jump through a bunch of hoops to see if they had the virus are people who have reason to think that they may have been infected."
3776,This is not controversial in the scientific community.
3777,It's also common sense.
3778,I don't understand why you can't understand with scientific consensus OR common sense.
3779,I remember just before Covid my daughter and I went to Chicago and saw Phantom.
3780,A lady was coughing her flipping head OFF through the whole thing.
3781,"I was annoyed just due to the noise, not really caring that much about getting sick from it."
3782,Just imagine ANY coughing in a theater during the pandemic.
3783,"I honestly think if they were to open, they should require STRICT mask usage for ALL, no drinking or eating, and improved ventilation of some kind."
3784,Canada has fewer total cases of coronavirus than America has *deaths* ya goof.
3785,So far i've only had to enter a building that wasn't my own home once since march.
3786,I had to go into work to restart a device.
3787,I went in around midnight and never saw a soul.
3788,I still have to run to the pharmacy to get medications though once a month.
3789,They offer curbside pickup.
3790,I pull up and call to let them know I'm outside and a pharmacist wearing PPE hands me the meds.
3791,"I've had to stop at the bank a few times (drive thru) to get tip money for grocery deliveries, I've had to do curbside pickup at grocery stores when there weren't slots available for delivery."
3792,I've had to drop off or pick up things for friends (toilet paper for example when that was hard to find) but that means leaving stuff outside their doors or in their mailboxes.
3793,I have managed to get a few conversations in though with a friend out on his balcony and me half way down his driveway (both of us still wearing masks) but other than that I've just been doing video chats and texting with friends.
3794,I did curbside voting before I signed up to have ballots mailed to me.
3795,I basically don't go anywhere.
3796,"On the plus side, last month was the first time since this whole thing started I had to get gas."
3797,France had 20k cases today and has less than half the population of Russia.
3798,Why is this not a bigger story ?
3799,France also has 1/5th the population of the United States.
3800,Imagine the media shitstorm if the US reported 100k cases in a day.
3801,I-Ooooh shit we’re fucked
3802,Until he survives and becomes more powerful than we can ever imagine.
3803,"In my company, on my team of 10, we had a head count add that was approved for this year that ended up going to Costa Rica, and a coworker who quit in the summer who also was replaced with someone in Costa Rica."
3804,We’ve also outsourced one development team to India.
3805,They never said that.
3806,They said they didn't have evidence of it yet - people like you need to learn how to read properly.
3807,This is a flat out lie and you have no data to back it up.
3808,Prove it.
3809,I dont think anyone in europe thought we had it beat.
3810,10% does not really seem very reasonable.
3811,Even the dialysis patient study that said that was from three months ago.
3812,The levels of cope around the world right now are just hilarious.
3813,"My wife insists on it, and who am I to argue?"
3814,It just makes sense.
3815,"Covid isn't an ""attack""."
3816,WTF msn
3817,Only greece left.
3818,They may do better because it is still very warm and sunny there.
3819,"Do you actually know that you are a bad person and embrace it, or are you completely ignorant of that?"
3820,I definitely prefer his name to be Rump.
3821,"In germany they allowed wedding parties up to 150 guests and soccer with guests, how stupid isn´t it?"
3822,Why?
3823,Infection is not a function of population size.
3824,Thanks for the restore.
3825,"I won't get tested, because of lack of trust of the current environment."
3826,I dont trust that the instruments are sterile or I won't receive a false positive.
3827,"I have spent most of my working career in some form of Healthcare,  and it has made me so freaking jaded and or paranoid."
3828,"Ford too, he was given $1.3bil to safely open schools and only spent $400mil."
3829,Teachers were fired and class sizes were increased too.
3830,He spent more time arguing about unions rather than just spending the money.
3831,He also said that after watching the positives trend upwards for the past 7 WEEKS that it was finally time to do something.
3832,No one gives up on their job for 7 weeks and keeps it in the end.
3833,Oh and all he ended up doing was put restrictions in a handful of cities.
3834,Big brain move getting people to go out of town to eat out and go to the gyms.
3835,"Also in all the daily tweets about new numbers they keep emphasizing the number of people under 40 who are now sick while ignoring that they're the teachers, students, essential workers and casino staff."
3836,They shame people for partying not the people who just need to go out and eat at a restaurant or the people who need to drive 20 minutes to run on a treadmill indoors for an hour.
3837,You can't try to be this bad at something yet here we are.
3838,[removed]
3839,"Doesn't change the fact that you're pushing the exact narrative that is currently being disseminated by the Alex Berenson/Phil Kerpen crowd, which thought this whole thing would end when we hit 20% infected btw."
3840,Lots of NAD+  plus products for sale.
3841,Google it or look on Amazon.
3842,Oh please please tell me you're being sarcastic.
3843,Because what a silly way to think.
3844,"Congrats, you done it."
3845,"Per capita, it would be equivalent to around 45,000 cases in the US."
3846,Their vaccine appears to be working wonderfully.
3847,Then what on earth is OZ locked down so hard for ?
3848,Their hospitals never came close to being overrun.
3849,They didn’t bring in refrigerated trucks like we did in my city
3850,Oh I totally agree!!
3851,It’s happened 6 times at our school already.
3852,It pisses me off each and every time.
3853,"Yes every record gets broken quickly, I´m not shocked if we see 10k cases in countries with less than 20 million population."
3854,Fuck.
3855,"Come on, USA."
3856,Step it up!
3857,[removed]
3858,"That's a pretty large gender difference, though."
3859,"If you expected worse, then you thought that med would be even more horrible than they are."
3860,jeeze.....
3861,The biggest issue would be hurricanes.
3862,"It's not true for the most part but I'll give you that in this context, most seems not to care enough about being hygienic and good mannered, if I may say."
3863,I'm sad that I lost my job but I'm happy tjay I don't have to deal with this anymore.
3864,Who are the people you interact with and are they at high risk for severe illness?
3865,You can totally take on that risk for yourself but I’d reconsider if I had loved ones in my life that are high risk.
3866,"Well, I disagree."
3867,Don't know what to tell you.
3868,I can say don't worry about it.
3869,It is inconsequential to your life.
3870,Many more things to worry about that actually have impact.
3871,"But, it is your choice to fret or rant."
3872,It's what discussion boards are for.
3873,"Unemployment figures are quite good considering the recession, small businesses get wiped out all the time, and come back pretty quickly, and mental health is not going to be improved by killing people."
3874,Pull your head in.
3875,"Dr. Fauci has called for masking of small animals, and is saying that all trees need to be separated by six feet."
3876,It's not summer here for another 2 months.
3877,"The cases were driven down throughout winter, with the peak occurring on the 30th of July."
3878,You can't blame the weather.
3879,"Look, I’m not minimizing it."
3880,6x more than the flu is a lot of deaths.
3881,If you’re trying to make people take it seriously the current tactic won’t work.
3882,It is like Reefer Madness.
3883,Telling exaggerated lies to make something seem much scarier than it is only makes people not trust anything else you say.
3884,"6x avg flu is bad, it is as bad or worse than pandemic flu of 1968 or 1957."
3885,It makes this the worst infectious disease outbreak since 1918 (not counting HIV).
3886,"No reason to make preposterous claims like flu kills 2k people, or Covid kills 100x flu"
3887,One light on.
3888,You know he is madly tweeting.
3889,It's not like Arizona was on the leading edge of Covid-19 containment.
3890,"We were among the worst in the nation for a while, governor douchebag saw to that."
3891,When he ALLOWED cities to pass their own mask mandates and shut down gyms and bars.. but not restaurants things got better.
3892,The reason cases dropped so fast is because it was allowed to run rampant from the start.
3893,Agreed!
3894,As has much going for it!
3895,"Plus I haven’t fact checked all he said but I don’t think the highest taxes is true, because of [reasons](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/) ."
3896,There’s a lot more to Az than just the bad.
3897,I mean I still meet friends it’s just that we’re really safe about it.
3898,I know many others my age who act like complete dumbasses though
3899,Today we hit a new daily record for deaths (485) and positivity rate (58%).
3900,"From what I've seen, models show we should be having 100k a day."
3901,"While the cases are slowly fading after months on Buenos Aires Province and Buenos Aires City (⅓ of population), cases and deaths in the rest of the country are spiking like crazy, where healthcare system is very poor and limited."
3902,And better not to talk about testing there.
3903,Many belive that Buenos Aires City is not that far away from herd inmunity (200k cases with 35% of positivity rate with 3M inhabitants).
3904,"But to be honest, people is more worried about the upcoming crisis."
3905,"Situation was bad already, and now with coronavirus and (bias alert here) goverment doing everything they can to destroy middle class and spend (and printing) money they don't have, the future seems dark (end of bias)."
3906,"I mean, economic crisis it's not a matter of IF but WHEN."
3907,Good catch!
3908,The first real country to hit such a mark.
3909,"Only San Marino has more with 0.12%  

Belgium is chasing with 0.087%."
3910,My boss uses that phrase a lot these days.
3911,Ducey met Pence today.
3912,Fucking asshole is about to be a super spreader.
3913,"On a plus side, he's friends with my asshole old boss who does nothing but fuck over anyone who has ever worked for him."
3914,I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
3915,Trump specifically requested Regeneron and he has a stake in the company.
3916,"It is not something anyone, even a president, would have been given as standard treatment."
3917,[removed]
3918,He needs to go and get a new human skin.
3919,That ones wearing out
3920,"Someone here mentioned the term ""prosperity gospel"" when talking about this, which I think explains a lot of this behaviour."
3921,"There's a Puritan-influenced idea that wealthy and successful people are being rewarded for virtue, and maybe favored by God; on the other hand if bad things happen to someone it's considered a sign that they weren't morally worthy."
3922,"This kind of thinking seems to be very entrenched in American values, and I think a lot of people subscribe to it on some level."
3923,Of course everyone thinks they're a good person so they'll think they have a place among the successful by this logic.
3924,I figure this is also why a lot of people don't care about protections against getting sick; they think they're morally good so misfortune would never strike them.
3925,No fargin way will I travel.
3926,It will be sharing the time via webex or microsoft teams
3927,Blame your governor!
3928,I hate what this administration is doing.
3929,I honestly hope the coronavirus does serious damage to trump.
3930,Not even to kill him but I want him to suffer.
3931,I would argue our moral position as a society is fluid and cyclical.
3932,A return to a more upstanding position is definitely possible in the future.
3933,"During the Gilded Age, robber barons ran our society amok."
3934,Inequality was at an all time high and people didn’t trust the media.
3935,"Later, we stumbled again: President Harding and his cabinet were basically a bunch of crooks."
3936,Extremely effective in making sure hospitals aren't overrun and the transmission rate is lower.
3937,That's fine!
3938,We just can't go on like this.
3939,"Keep certain things closed, wear masks, ect."
3940,But the world needs to start again or way more people are going to be in a worse shit storm than they would be if they caught covid and have a 99+% chance of living.
3941,Yes.
3942,The exact worse time!
3943,Spread of a virus is exponential.
3944,It could have helped if he didn’t lie to us!
3945,I know I shouldn’t believe everything I read online but I hope your story isn’t true.
3946,That’s unbelievably rude and trashy.
3947,Because somehow you genuinely believe that if the US just fully locked down for 4 weeks then the virus would have been eliminated.
3948,This is just pure fantady my friend.
3949,There is no eliminating this virus.
3950,"&gt; But we can't keep quoting the WHO as if they're an independent impartial scientific body, and at the same time concede that they are at the mercy of decisions coming out of Beijing."
3951,Being independent and having authority in China are two separate things in my book.
3952,"However, if that's how you define independence, then I guess there is no independent country, organization or person outside of China."
3953,"&gt; For example, did pressure from China lead to the WHO to delay confirming person-to-person transmission, or declaring a pandemic?"
3954,"Or, as they said it themselves, they simply reported what Chinese health officials told them."
3955,"&gt; I think it's important for us to know what, if any, effect did politics have in these early missteps."
3956,"And whatever power China has over the WHO, now that the US are out of it, China's influence over the WHO has grown."
3957,[removed]
3958,Coincidence?
3959,Yes.
3960,Masks are useless.
3961,"(/s, obviously)"
3962,...?
3963,Hahaha triggered.
3964,No fucking shit!
3965,"Interesting, if you follow the case counts and deaths, it always seems it’s right around 3%."
3966,Like what?
3967,!
3968,I don't disagree in principle.
3969,I just said I'd take that over eternal social distancing.
3970,To be honest eternal social distancing is the worst thing imaginable.
3971,Sad that the CDC is trying so hard to explained their incorrect recommendations.
3972,"We all know n95 would work, we all know cloth mask mandates increase deaths."
3973,I said in January that trump needs to suspend the CDC and FDA.
3974,All everything they did made covid so much more deadly.
3975,"they won't admit when he tested negative, i'm better it was several days before because his symptoms got severe much too quickly and their treatment got desperate much more quickly than one would expect with a Thursday diagnosis with daily negatives every previous day."
3976,Nerd alert
3977,Wow you’re cool
3978,This is false.
3979,"Cases dropped because most of the state already got the virus and since most people are asymptomatic, and those who got it don't get it again, cases obviously drop."
3980,"But yeah, cotton masks and polyester gators are the savior."
3981,Not really.
3982,"If I have the sniffles, I can barely smell anything and that’s not really that rare."
3983,"A proper Covid test is definitely more useful, otherwise everybody with a cold tests positive..."
3984,So...what exactly...about the science on masks that have existed for decades...has changed?
3985,Was he also mitigating a run on masks when he stated that they could do more harm than good?
3986,For one out of the last 7 months.
3987,Blocked you asswipe.
3988,That we're one of the worst in the world is undeniable.
3989,We're going to crush you lying fucks in less than a month.
3990,Captain Covid as Cuomo would say...
3991,"It’s hard to say since there seem to be sort of ebbs and flows of outbreaks, followed by stricter regulations (unless you’re Florida) and while it would take awhile to reach true herd immunity, the more people who are infected, the less people who can hosts to spread the virus."
3992,"Not an exact science, but even if we just let it run rampant, I believe we would have a vaccine before everyone was infected."
3993,"Well that was a close one, we can let our guard down now for the virus"
3994,I think they mean antigen.
3995,Its a translation error.
3996,Chinese did pooled PCR.
3997,CCDC says antigen tests are not sufficiently reliable.
3998,&gt; You realize recommendations and science change yeah?
3999,That’s literally how science works.
4000,So the science on masks has changed in the last 7 months?
4001,What *exactly* about the science on masks has changed?
4002,Yeah...Fauci says he lied about his mask recommendation because of PPE shortages.
4003,He lied.
4004,He's a liar.
4005,People didn't wear masks...and apparently people died because of it...so why is no one blaming him for 1000s and 1000s deaths?
4006,Why is the finger always pointed at Trump?
4007,Why when Trump claims that he under sold the danger of the virus to avoid a panic people crucify him...but when Fauci allegedly lies to avoid a run on masks no one says a word?
4008,Do you see the disconnect?
4009,It's one thing to say that masks aren't necessary to avoid a run on them...but to state that wearing them could do more harm than good is not at all about mitigating a shortage.
4010,It's far more likely it's the truth.
4011,That's the kind of statement that will stick with people long after your mitigation efforts are done.
4012,If it was a part of a mitigation effort it was deeply irresponsible and he should be held to account...which I NEVER see happen.
4013,"This may be true, but I still don't get what happened this week that changed everything."
4014,"Some stocks I've had that have been flat since May suddenly spiked 5-9% in a week, out of nowhere."
4015,"No news, nothing."
4016,"It's been likely 2 weeks since he contracted the virus

We haven't even hit the severe part of this if it's going to hit him"
4017,There are signs everywhere in my building to wear a mask in the common areas.
4018,The front office keeps sending email blasts reminding us to wear masks but nobody is except for me and two older ladies.
4019,Haven't been outside to see anyone else.
4020,My grandmother had to have surgery so I didn't go anywhere for 2 weeks to make sure I didn't catch anything.
4021,It's different.
4022,In most of US and Europe doctors and reporters can go directly to the media without going to jail.
4023,"For the US specifically, each state can report it's own numbers, and we've actually seen a major news organizations questioning the validity of CDC numbers."
4024,"I am not saying the numbers were wrong, but a healthy debate is needed to make sure these organizations are not skewing the reporting guidelines to favor one of the other political party."
4025,Sure.
4026,I'm just saying this isn't evidence of a Wednesday diagnosis.
4027,It’s also not physically possible in many places.
4028,"I live in Switzerland and our trains and buses are crowded, we don’t have more rolling stock to reduce that, so either you start another lockdown (which a lot of people will ignore) or ccc distancing is just not possible here."
4029,"In the US where everybody just has a car outside of the big cities, it would be easier."
4030,"Sorry, meant 50%, not 100%, don't know why I got that mixed up."
4031,Death growing by 50 % compared to the day prior dosen't mean cumulative death is rising the same way.
4032,"Either way, I fail to se why Sweden could have stopped their deaths in general in mid march."
4033,"Considering how long it takes for people to die of covid, Sweden was far gone."
4034,"Obviously some countries, such as spain, had a worse spread, but Swedens spread was fast."
4035,Look at the numbers from march to early april.
4036,Of course Sweden could perhaps have stopped the spread somewhat.
4037,But I have not yet seen credible evidence for it making a big difference.
4038,That’s weird.. almost as if science was right
4039,Georgian here.
4040,"No, they aren't."
4041,"Also, because the numbers are going down, people think this is good number to be at and we are doing well."
4042,It was worse a month ago and everyone was out living like nothing was happening.
4043,It's exhausting to live here and see the blatant disregard.
4044,Some parts of Atlanta take it seriously because of Mayor Bottoms.
4045,Outside of Atlanta mask wearing is less common and COVID deniers are rampant.
4046,Us Georgians are not okay.
4047,"Had a nice birthday party, many guests, indoors, not wearing masks."
4048,"This isn't a case of god getting them, as they put it."
4049,God gave them a brain.
4050,They chose not to use it.
4051,"Don't blame god, this one is on them."
4052,Poppers use to be used as deodorizers.
4053,Europe is losing it as well.
4054,Been back in an office since June and gotta say it's not THAT bad.
4055,"Wear your mask, wash your hands, keep a safe distance from everyone, use Microsoft Teams every chance you get."
4056,"Oh, this poor woman."
4057,That is so many from one family.
4058,Fauci told us not to wear a mask.
4059,He should go on trial for these murders!
4060,It's sad that what would have been obvious sarcasm is not these days.
4061,That's how screwed up USA is.
4062,What.a.shit.show.
4063,Only a matter of time till cases go back up in AZ.
4064,Scottsdale and I believe Sierra Vista lifted the mask mandate.
4065,We already getting too lax and flu season hasn’t even hit.
4066,I believe Maricopa was talking about possibly lifting their mask mandate as well.
4067,Only a matter of time....
4068,I know cause I live in Arizona 😱😱
4069,"I mean, it would be if it took him out."
4070,Dudes dangerous.
4071,You really think the mortality rate is better in India?
4072,You're not so bright.
4073,Stand at front of your house proudly.
4074,Rip off your mask.
4075,Say you fought the virus and won and walk inside so other people can share your joy.
4076,/s
4077,Give it another 3 weeks.
4078,"This virus is known for making people a little bit sick, then they get better ... then a couple of weeks later it hits in full force."

4080,"I guess it’s hard to tell in writing, i should have included an emoji."

4082,"Damn it, this will be just like the original Blade Runner movie, isn't it?"
4083,No more pets left - only high-tech imitations.
4084,:(
4085,Unfortunately he’s evil and smart as opposed to trump evil and stupid.
4086,10 day doubling would not hold consistent before awareness rose right?
4087,So before precautions were put in place doubling would have occurred much quicker?
4088,you post on politicalcompassmemes and are telling someone to educate themselves about the nuances of politics
4089,did no one notice days that hit that same number repeatedly?
4090,He’ll still celebrate it as his 30th appearance on Time’s cover.
4091,Indiana here.
4092,We are in stage 5.
4093,Only requirements are masks and health department approval of gatherings of 500 or more people.
4094,Everything else is back to normal.
4095,"Our cases are shooting up, of course."

4097,Trim that fat.

4105,Correction.. Dictators such as Newsom cumo etc have put around 100 million people into extreme poverty.
4106,The dictators did this.
4107,By SOP patients have to be tested negative twice with at least 24hrs apart.

4109,Hell yah.

4116,1.1 million deaths is not the right number.
4117,I don’t believe they gave an estimate of the number of deaths.

4132,People just have too big of egos on social media.

4170,Money and power.
4171,The dude talking is probably one of the most qualified scientists in the field .
4172,You look at who is most at risk for the virus and design precautions around that .
4173,Arizona didn’t ask Trump’s permission to have a mask mandate.
4174,More states need to be stepping up
4175,You wear it as long as you think it's best just don't expect others to do the same.

4177,Yes... but everyone knows about the bridge party.
4178,And it banalised the situation to a point that most people stopped believing in the pandemic.
4179,So many people say it’s a hoax or that it’s just a little cold (“chripecka”) and all of these kind of situations add to the problem.
4180,The problem is largely a mental one...
4181,"Wow, that’s absolutely insane."
4182,Do you feel that people on your side of the country are growing tired of the restrictions?
4183,&gt; makes no sense holding everyone hostage when we literally have the data.
4184,Care to share that 'data' with the class?
4185,Sororities literally can’t have parties.
4186,Men aren’t even allowed in sorority housing.

4188,"Decadron, or dexamethasone, is actually one of the few glucocorticoids that has hardly any affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor."
4189,"You actually expect an initial reduction in mineralocorticoid receptor activation, as suppression of the HPA-axis by dex leads to reduced production of cortisol and corticosterone, which do activate the MR. 

Water retention may occur (e.g."
4190,"by increasing glucose levels in the blood, a classical glucocorticoid receptor effect, which can increase thirst and fluid intake) and swelling of the limbs is a side-effect of dexamethasone, these are not mineralocorticoid effects (which would indeed be systemic, as the MR controls system water retention through water reabsorption in the kidney)."
4191,wait i thought it was free for all americans ?
4192,Ummm probably not lol
4193,Vaccines can lead to a better immune response that the disease though
4194,He has a PHD in molecular biology and is certainly very qualified as he worked on several vaccines before.
4195,"The health minister of Australia literally mispoke himself today and said 'adapt to the new world order'

But i'm a nutjob?"
4196,I know someone obese and roughly the same age as Trump.
4197,They caught the virus and recovered in about 4 or 5 days with no drugs.
4198,My uncle has complete left side paralysis from a stroke.
4199,He was asymptomatic.
4200,They only knew he had it because he was tested after his nursing home room mate died of Covid.
4201,Just because you have risk factors doesn't mean you're going to die or even get severely ill.
4202,Your political bias is gross to imply it's fake just because you're unhappy he didn't get more ill. Basically it's as bad as Trump's political bias.
4203,Fake news right?
4204,I work at a Cinemark in CA.
4205,"Last Friday when we opened, 600 people came within eight hours."
4206,Not our usual numbers but still good.
4207,people don't want to risk getting sick from a virus which has no available vaccine.
4208,stop acting stupid like you don't understand this.

4215,Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.
4216,&gt; We can literally look at the numbers and balance out safety with freedom.
4217,I'm curious what metric you'd use to compare these things... How much safety is 1 freedom worth?
4218,Would have cost the taxpayers less too.
4219,"Ok let's unpack this:

His doctors said he was tested and they found a lot of antibodies."
4220,"The maker of Regeneron said this is very likely due to the antibodies of theirs he was being given, as they've seen with other patients."
4221,"He wasn't producing his own antibodies when he came into the hospital, which was the impetus for this treatment, and his body likely isn't now either."
4222,He had his doctors sign NDAs and he's protected by HIPAA.
4223,They aren't allowed to divulge information without his permission and being the president he can have them say what he wants.
4224,"Hes currently on Dex, there was an article posted here yesterday and all kinds of stories about people who were on it, while having very serious, life threatening conditions, and they felt beyond amazing."
4225,"They acted exactly like Trump is acting now, completely confident they were fine."
4226,The Dex reduces lung tissue inflammation and stops the mechanism that causes what is basically like a massive allergic reaction in COVID patients.
4227,This is stopping the cytokine storm and lung inflammation that typically causes death.
4228,"It also trashes the patient's immune system, and since Trump isn't creating his own antibodies, when he's taken off of the Dex, what happens?"
4229,"Not entirely sure, but since he's not able to fight off the infection, it's possible all that bad shit happens."
4230,"His videos: The guy looks like a cadaver, his right side is drooping."
4231,"His voice is hoarse, he at times is obviously out of breath, he's completely off his rocker (even more so than usual, another side effect of the Dex, which may be the cause of him having to be taken off it before it's safe; he becomes psychotic)."
4232,"Given all of this, it's not at all cut and dry or assured that he's ok nor will he be ok."
4233,Commendable recommendation.
4234,Truly.
4235,One problem.
4236,"If you don't save yourself, who will?"
4237,"This is a proper question, because ultimately if you aren't expected to save yourself, then who is?"
4238,The taxpayer?
4239,"Okay sure that one can work, but only so long as everyone can work."
4240,Or at least has an income that can be taxed.
4241,Ultimately the doctor needs to be paid by someone right?
4242,So who does the paying.
4243,"Ultimately, it all comes back to you again."
4244,"Now don't get me wrong, I am all for combined efforts to make a better society for everyone."
4245,It's just that often people saying what you have said are actually still only really thinking about themselves or at best their loved ones.
4246,"Unless you are truly selfless, in which case you won't mind giving up your own well being for the betterment of others, right?"
4247,This is why society runs off entitlement and self preservation ultimately.
4248,This will never change until you can somehow change human nature itself.
4249,Good luck.
4250,I’ll reiterate again that trump does not meet the criteria for Expanded Access/Compassionate use.
4251,This drug simply should not be administered under this program because it’s not a medication of last resort - it’s instead being studied in patients with early stage covid pneumonia.
4252,Check our the expanded access program criteria on FDAs website for more info.
4253,Trump doesn’t meet the very first criterion.
4254,If they don't want to participate in vaccine trials (which is 100% their choice) how do they suggest vaccines be made to work better for them?
4255,Trumps a loser and his followers are even dumber for believing him.
4256,Followers = conservatives
4257,I guess there’s a good reason it’s called the ‘us’

4264,I am saying that if everyone sheltered in place for 4 weeks the virus would almost completely disappear.
4265,"I do not care that people are stupid, I do not care that people don't listen."
4266,"I'm not saying ""if we tried this and people didn't listen and still broke quarantine it would work"", that's absurd."
4267,"I'm not discussing possible means of enforcement or anything else you are trying to ""gotcha"" me with."
4268,"If I am completely wrong, please explain how a virus which typically lasts under 4 weeks will survive in great number if everyone shelters in place for 4 weeks."
4269,"Do not say ""but people won't do it."""
4270,That's not what I am discussing.
4271,I am discussing a scenario in which people actually do it.
4272,then why is WH blocking cdc contact tracing if it wasn't for fear Trump was patient zero?
4273,"And anyway, Trump brought a general infection to the WH, he gotta go for real and the place needs to be disinfected."
4274,"The worst part is the Utah LDS area presidency made a statement months ago about masks (https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2020-07-10/utah-area-presidency-urges-latter-day-saints-wear-masks-public-188836), the women's organization of the church coordinated the sewing/donating of millions of masks (https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2020-05-06/5-million-masks-video-projectprotect-relief-society-183360), and the top leaders of the church were all wearing masks this weekend at the semi-annual conference (https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fu5Y_dkgJ4ycHSJ1atrVaVHz0Zy4%3D%2F0x0%3A2370x1332%2F1200x800%2Ffilters%3Afocal(996x477%3A1374x855)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_image%2Fimage%2F67580623%2FScreen_Shot_2020_10_03_at_2.02.27_PM.0.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deseret.com%2Ffaith%2F2020%2F10%2F4%2F21500274%2Flds-mormon-general-conference-twitter-reaction&amp;docid=eHb-rxNbzH5Y_M&amp;tbnid=kzK-H7tFKq29xM&amp;vet=1&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)."

4277,"You may be comfortable with corpses being used for research, but that doesn't mean the family of that person is."
4278,&gt;You can be against abortion but still want the most good to come out of the act if it has already happened.
4279,Sure.
4280,But that has not been the stance of Mike Pence or any of the evangelical Christian Republicans.
4281,"Their stance has never been, ""well I'm uncomfortable with how these cells were obtained, but seeing as we have them, we should use them""."
4282,"It's ""no research using foetal tissue, including cell lines derived from aborted foetal tissue""

You may find reading up on Henrietta Lacks interesting."
4283,I believe the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a good overview.
4284,"It discusses a lot of these ethical issues, and whether scientific progress should trump personal agency"
4285,"Funny, the rest of the world figured out how to not fail so miserably at an inevitable pandemic."

4342,I know at least one study found that aerosols exhaled by breathing and talking can remain infectious for 16 hours.
4343,It would partly explain why it spreads so easily.

4352,I saw news articles about the elevator button and trash can but it was unclear if that was the result of finding virus on the surfaces or just an assumption based on contact tracing.

4364,Mask compliance reduces both the necessity and the length of lockdowns.
4365,"It boggles my mind how one can be anti-mask and anti-lockdown, and not be able to grasp how that is an epic failure in reasoning."
4366,It’s the same kind of flawed reasoning that brought us witch trials 400 years ago.
4367,But that was before the scientific method and before the enlightenment.
4368,Pretty scary how many Y’all Qaeda and Vanilla ISIS sympathizers we have in the US.

4496,What's funny is that Universal was open before Disney even opened as well.
4497,Disney hasn't closed down since reopening in FL and if opening disney was going to cause some explosion in cases we would have seen it by now.

4500,"Not even just in the USA, but maybe for other countries as well."
4501,I'm sure there are anecdotal articles and such maybe detailing some of this tracing but why no concise paper that lists multiple data points of this being an issue?

4892,"To me, the things that particularly benefit amusement parks in general, certainly in California, or that they are something that primarily are outside, and have controlled boundaries such that the park operators can know who comes in and out."
4893,"Also, particularly in the case of Disney, they are actually quite strict about enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing, certainly more so compared to your typical grocery store or other retail outlet."
4894,"Given what we actually know about the virus and how it spreads, we have to be willing to look at the activities that go on and what measures a business might be proposing in order to allow them to re-open to some extent."
4895,"For me, this is one of the keys that really irks me, Because if we are to actually take this idea that it’s about data, science, and evidence, then we have to be willing to update our views about what is acceptable and what is not when we learn new information about the virus it’s self."
4896,"To me, Feeling to do so is just as bad as what the plandemic an anti-maskers claim."
4897,Let’s also consider the fact that some amusement parks have already run events on their grounds that I would essentially call being “open“ to some extent.
4898,"In particular, Knottsberry farm and Seaworld have both run food events that have use the parks grounds for these purposes."
4899,"In a hypothetical situation where the capacity for these events remain consistent system and the rides were allowed to reopen, what is the essential difference here?"
4900,Why does it matter that the rides are not allowed to run here when people are allowed to attend a food event?
4901,"So long as capacity is limited, what is the difference?"
4902,"And maybe you say to yourself, well that wouldn’t be worth it to the parks, and maybe that’s true."
4903,But I think the state should let them make that decision on their own and put the ball in their court.
4904,"In addition to what has already been allowed for the parks, I think we need to take a critical look at what’s actually allowed to operate."
4905,"For example, to me zoos and aquariums have always had a similar grouping for me, mentally, as amusement parks."
4906,"If you’re not aware, the San Diego zoo is currently allowed to be open, and if you go to their website, they state that you should be ready for a 1 to 2 hour wait to simply get into the zoo itself during peak hours."
4907,What of course is the difference between the San Diego zoo and Disneyland From a functional perspective?
4908,Or consider that places with go carts and mini golf are allowed to resume operations.
4909,Indoor movie theaters in many places can re-open to some extent.
4910,And many other forms of personal entertainment and recreation have been open to some extent for a while.
4911,Even bars can resume outdoor operations in the orange tier and some indoor dining is even allowed as early as the red tier if I remember correctly.
4912,"While I don’t necessarily want to advocate for closing down businesses that have already reopened, I do think there needs to be some consistency here and I think it’s hard to make the case that, given appropriate precautions, some of these things are less of a risk than walking around an amusement park, outdoors, with a mask on."
4913,"And you may say about any of these, “well people don’t travel from around the country to go to these places,” something that you would be correct in stating."
4914,"However, in the guidelines that were leaked, there was a proposed 120 mile limit for any guest planning to enter a park."
4915,"While this rule irked some folks, I actually think it’s quite Reasonable."
4916,"I do think travel is a legitimate concern, and I think that this is a reasonable place to start."
4917,"As with many of the problems that people bring up, I don’t necessarily think the challenges they face are insurmountable, but they do require some creative thinking and a willingness to assess what is appropriate."
4918,"Perhaps one of the most important considerations is that keeping the parks closed is not only hurting the park operators, but it’s also hurting the employees, the cities, and the surrounding businesses."
4919,"I’ve heard many people make the argument that “going to Disneyland is not essential, so how can you possibly be arguing for this?“ And while I would agree that it’s not essential for people visiting, it is essential for quite a number of people who derive their ability to live and support their families based on the operations of the parks."
4920,"No matter what you think of Disney or any of these parks as companies, punishing them by staying closed is only going to end up hurting employees."
4921,"I would agree that Disney is kind of a shitty company and that there need to be some real reforms that are talked about, but at the end of the day, all we’re doing is preventing thousands of people from being able to stay in their current employment arrangements."
4922,Probably the worse situation here are for the cities and businesses that rely on these parks.
4923,"For example, some of the cities surrounding some of these parks, particularly in orange county, are facing massive budget shortfalls (like in the hundreds of millions of dollars) because they typically count on taxes revenue linked to tourism and park operations."
4924,"Without any assurance or ability to plan for the future, they may have to lay off people who work for the cities and also reduce certain civic functions like public safety and other basic government functions."
4925,"And unfortunately, at the moment, there’s nothing they can really do."
4926,"And as far as I’m aware, the governor hasn’t put forth any kind of plan to help out these cities and the people who live in them."
4927,So What are they supposed to do here?
4928,"In providing criticism, I always find it’s important to also provide some potential solutions."
4929,"For me, I think probably the most reasonable compromise would be having a tiered re-opening plan for amusement parks themselves."
4930,"In the purple tear, only concessions can operate; in the red tier, outdoor attractions may resume; in the orange tier indoor attractions may resume with limited capacity, and in the yellow tier; capacity can be somewhat increased for the park itself."
4931,"If you were at all aware of what the leaked guidelines were, I don’t disagree with anything that was on that list, except for the requirement that parks be in counties that are in the yellow tier in order to begin operations (where cases in a county are 1 per 100,000)."
4932,"Not only does that bring extreme uncertainty to these businesses, but it brings a hell of a lot of uncertainty to the employees, Cities, and businesses that rely on park operations."
4933,"Given that I don’t think that we will consistently be in the yellow tier until basically just before the pandemic is over, I think that this is an unrealistic, But I think it’s also a regulation that is put out not in good faith."
4934,"I certainly don’t think that what I propose here is what should go in to place finally, but it’s something that should be a starting point for actual discussions and negotiations."
4935,(Continued below due to length)
4936,This isn’t new information.
4937,We’ve known cats and dogs are dying from COVID since February.
4938,I don’t understand why people are just hearing of this now.
4939,"My cat caught it, there are hundreds who’s dogs and cats died after they caught it"
4940,What would you find?
4941,8 of the top 10 states for deaths per capita were blue.
4942,"It's debatable and unknowable at this point exactly what the outcome of the vaccine will be in regards to how much safety we gain (both from efficacy of the vaccine as well as reduction in general spread), but that is not really the point anyway."
4943,The point at hand is what peoples' behavior is going to be.
4944,"Peoples' behavior is not always well grounded in facts or science, and I'm sure /u/713_ToThe_832 is probably correct; people are going to be completely done with this by the time there's a widely available vaccine."
4945,It's not even going to matter if the vaccine is only 50% effective and covid is still a major problem.
4946,They'll be done with it anyway.
4947,"I believe the jargon for this idea is whether the pandemic will end ""medically"" or ""socially""."
4948,"If it ends medically, that means we beat the virus with vaccines and treatments."
4949,"If it ends socially, that the population at large simply decided they are done with it."
4950,"I think at this point most people, including experts, believe that this thing is going to end socially before it ends medically, regardless of how smart that may or may not be."
4951,I feel this.
4952,RIP hundreds of thousands more Americans.
4953,Not that we saw this coming or anything.
4954,i believe you're right.
4955,but i guess it's because everyone is doing it :)
4956,I’m not from the US but I’ve lived and worked in healthcare in the US for more years than I care to admit.
4957,I’m well aware of the costs.
4958,The reason it costs so much here has to do with healthcare being a largely for profit system.
4959,It shouldn’t be.
4960,But test development is a separate issue.
4961,And not all tests are developed in the USA.
4962,Much of the principles behind testing is an improvement on pre-existing methodology.
4963,"Just keep ""bad bot""-ing all the automods."
4964,Maybe we can get rid of that awful bot someday.
4965,"Kamala Harris just tweeted that the administration won't be halting fracking operations, during one of the hottest years in recorded history."
4966,And that's the DEMOCRATS.
4967,Science runs entirely counter culture to the US as a whole.
4968,"This isn't an R vs D matter, the whole country has been sold in bulk to corporations, and your children will have to live off the scraps."
4969,There’s also an old Nazi/American complex from that time in the Hollywood hills somewhere.
4970,There were lots of Nazis on the west coast before we went to war.
4971,"In the Netherlands it's because most people infected are much younger, so they don't spend as much time in hospitals and are less likely to die of corona."
4972,95% of infected people still have health issues after six months.
4973,"Lol,, so many down votes, sure the PRC slaves are working hard."
4974,Ugh.
4975,"I have been buying merchandise directly from artists and have been giving to MusiCares, but I have to admit I never even thought of the specialized event folks."
4976,This country has enough money that we could have paid you all to stay home through this.
4977,It would have been easy and I read the entire entertainment industry along with bars and restaurants could have been bailed out for a year for a small slice of what was allocated in the last COVID bill.
4978,I hope they get another one done soon and that it helps.
4979,It's just heartbreaking and so unnecessary.
4980,"Germanophone, was that a typo for germophobe?"
4981,Because there is no god and we're living in the worst timeline
4982,"In the article its 76 with no symptoms, 86 with no covid symptoms."
4983,Also only when they got tested doesnt say never got symptoms.
4984,Also also it was a sample of 115 people so not a huge study
4985,Well it has the largest population in Europe so... yeah?
4986,Because there is not the will to use NPI to starve out the virus like PRC or VN did and there is not the tech and legal requirements to TTI it close to baseline like RoK did.
4987,"By ‘pay the loss’, do you mean that they would simply be going into debt to you and have to pay eventually, rather the it actually being free rent?"
4988,"correct... BMI&gt;30 = death, 25-30 at least hospital."
4989,Skift is based out of NYC
4990,"Could you provide more information on this claim, with a link to data that proves this?"
4991,"Utah has only seen 66 child hospitalisations since the beginning of the pandemic, which against the mortality rate per hospitalisation for other States would suggest one or two deaths at most: [https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%2010.1.20%20FINAL.pdf](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%2010.1.20%20FINAL.pdf)

While it's important to take the pandemic and measures to limit disease spread seriously, it's equally important not to create additional fear and panic by misrepresenting the seriousness of the situation by claiming more people - particularly children - are dying than is actually the case."
4992,"Many parents are terrified for their children's health and safety and comments such as yours do not help this, particularly if your figures are exaggerated."
4993,"Your comment was reported for misinformation, and unless you can provide proof that the hospital your friend works in has seen 'several' children die from it, I have to uphold the reports that this misinformation as the available data does not support your claim."
4994,In the article OP linked in the comments it says 86% didn't have covid symptoms when tested but only 76 had no symptoms at all.
4995,Also it doesn't say if they developed any later on just not on the date of the test.
4996,I know a couple of people tested positive after getting a test because a friend/family member had symptoms or tested positive so hadn't got symptoms before the test but did develop them after.
4997,Yeah and they will definitely attack the US with their ICBMs because that will not backfire /s
4998,I found Bob Iger's account!
4999,Seriously?
5000,Test 100000 people.
5001,All positive.
5002,86000 people - no symptoms.
5003,The head of the NHS in England says hundreds of thousands of people could be suffering the effects of what's know as long Covid.
5004,Spitballing.....
5005,"But...

86% of people have little to nothing to worry about?"
5006,"The Counties themselves are at very different levels though, so I think people traveling from across the many different Cali counties to congregate at these parks, coupled with the fact that most likely the main demographic of people that would visit an amusement park amidst a pandemic are likely to be people that don't take the virus very seriously, seems like a setup to spread the virus more among the counties, as those visitors travel back to their communities."
5007,I do agree there is no consistency though.
5008,"We are told the protests are ok because the virus has a very low chance of transmission in an outdoor setting with masks, so then there should be no reason outdoor theme parks should not be allowed to operate, especially with limited capacity."
5009,I think Newsom's handling of this has been very poor and confusing.
5010,"I'm not a nurse, I work in nonprofits."
5011,"But, when I got my degree, I had complications, and ended up in three separate cohorts, one each year."
5012,So I got to know three years of graduating classes of social workers.
5013,"The most common type of person to be getting the degree was the woman who grew up well off, christian, believed in family and god before statistics, and that helping people was important."
5014,They thought helping people was important because it made them better people.
5015,Not because the people they were helping truly needed or deserved it.
5016,I have worked with 5 nonprofits.
5017,"This is something you come across often, and is a large part of why most people burn out of the job in two years."
5018,I think nursing has the same incentive that social work does.
5019,A lot of the people that go into it do so because they think they're supposed to to be a good person.
5020,They don't care about the studies or the actual needs of the people they're helping.
5021,"I'm not saying this to insult nurses or social workers, or anyone else."
5022,But it has been a prevalent problem.
5023,How do you say “duh” in conservative?
5024,"Yeah, pinkeye issue aside, I think it's possible that a chain of 1 or 2 persons from Trump's infection could still be in Pence orbit and possible even asymptomatic and have infected Pence."
5025,"Regardless, I bet you anything he was positive and ""felt fine"" and they just lied because they are full looney-toons Scott Atlas levels of in denial about this virus."
5026,"Like, in Atlas' world we are all going to get it, 80-90% of us, anyway."
5027,"So, might as well get it early so we can get that magic sweet herd immunity earlier instead of later."
5028,I think they probably believe that.
5029,"Enough time has passed for Pence to have serious symptoms, though, so maybe he does now."
5030,Trump is not well.
5031,No videos other than another lame quick one and with a greenscreen this time.
5032,His phone calls into Fox shows are bad.
5033,"He's coughing, manic and seems like he continues to struggle to breathe."
5034,"People with far lighter symptoms in this stage have died, in the end."
5035,"I swear, he's not well, I can't even believe anyone is trying to pretend he's all cured by now."
5036,Are you off your meds by any chance?
5037,[removed]
5038,"Where are the references, the data, anything but opinion?"
5039,These people consider themselves leading scientists???
5040,"This is getting old, death isn't the only potential permanent outcome"
5041,"Stupidity is by far the deadliest disease in America.&gt; 

Sadly an understatement."
5042,I knew it was bad after DT being elected but never realized how bad until Covid.
5043,"Don't tread on me, breaux!"
5044,Schools are completely shut down still in many states
5045,Turns out the deaths were from non-covid patients and I misunderstood.
5046,Turns out the deaths were from non-covid patients and I misunderstood.
5047,"I don't think it's so much ""better"" but just different."
5048,What should the governor do in your opinion?
5049,Probably has something to do with the flu season being only 13 weeks long.
5050,Yeah.
5051,New York hospitals back in March had to have outdoor dining as a result because so many people were just dying to try to get in.
5052,Totally normal and just business.
5053,Because there should not be strict restrictions for healthy people especially going forward.
5054,The highest we ever had in one day here in Sweden is 1698 cases in a day.
5055,We have about twice the population of Wisconsin.
5056,Hopefully most of the 3132 new cases in Wisconsin are younger people.
5057,that doesn't mean it can't be wrong.
5058,wakefield's study was on its books for 12 years.
5059,"and yeah, I know you'll probably tell me that it's the \*editorial board\* writing this- I don't know who's on that board, or whether or not all of its members agree with the interpretations of the lead author of the article."
5060,"South Korea, a country held up as a model for its response to Covid-19, has been struggling to contain a new nationwide outbreak."
5061,"At the forefront are a team of dedicated government contact tracers, who have the authority to isolate and test anyone who is suspected of having been in contact with the virus."
5062,BBC Korea joins South Korea’s virus detectives who battle long hours as they face their biggest challenge: gaining trust and cooperation from suspected carriers who are reluctant to provide personal information.
5063,With the northern states getting cold and being disease ridden we shouldn’t open Disneyland so they can fly down here and spread Covid.
5064,Not exactly a huge sample size of 115 people.
5065,damn you're a special type of retarded
5066,Restrictions and burdens on travel between U.S. states is illegal.
5067,Other states are not enforcing their fake quarantines because they can’t.
5068,California doesn’t need to play theatre.
5069,Is the damage caused by fracking greater than the economic value it provides?
5070,"Granted, I understand the long term sustainability issues and peak oil and all that."
5071,But is there a pressing need to end fracking urgently?
5072,Just saying that there is a pressing need to end COVID urgently.
5073,[deleted]
5074,Free my ass its paid for by charging us extraordinary prices on pharma or by govt money aka our money.
5075,"Shit title, how do they get to be patients without symptoms?"
5076,Does it mean cases maybe?
5077,do they not have symptoms at testing time or ever?
5078,Youve given those awards yourself with an alt account right?
5079,YA DON'T SAY
5080,"to be fair though, that subreddit's user base has soundly rejected this article for a variety of noted reasons."
5081,Unfortunately that sends to be the standard policy at a lot of hospitals.
5082,Reporting it may not have actually meant anything at her hospital.
5083,Or maybe she's selfish.
5084,Could be either really.

5091,"Also, how is this good news?"
5092,😂
5093,Yes I did ask that.
5094,You didn't answer it.
5095,In fact you further prove my point.
5096,"Do you remember the beginning of the outbreak, everyone was saying flatten the curve?"
5097,Flattening the curve meant slowing down the disease so that we could keep it at a manageable level.
5098,It was never meant to go away entirely.
5099,"Even with a vaccine, it would only be 50 percent effective."
5100,"This disease will be around for a long time, many more years, if not forever."
5101,"So according to you, we are all potentially lethal, so no one should be able to come in remote contact with anyone else for the next several years because 4 people in a thousand are dying."
5102,We should all live in isolation for the next five years.
5103,Is that what you are saying?
5104,That's the only option that you see?
5105,I was thinking the same.

5125,I contracted an infectious disease when I was in college.
5126,Back when I thought I was invincible.
5127,I got through it but it did take experimental (now used often) treatment to get rid of carrier status.
5128,This was 10 years ago.
5129,I just realized last year how many compounded issues had resulted from it.
5130,I was 22 and in good shape.

5146,"Which is concerning because all of the symptoms he had can be caused by covid, we have a real problem with tests being ineffective, and many people who experience these symptoms, have done so long after the virus was infectious in them."

* The use of face masks may provide a false sense of security leading to suboptimal physical distancing, poor respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene – and even not staying at home when ill.
* **There is a risk that improper removal of the face mask, handling of a contaminated face mask or an increased tendency to touch the face while wearing a face mask by healthy persons might actually increase the risk of transmission."

5514,"Fortunately unlike Russian opposition, trump does not have enemies who wish to kill him."
5515,So even if he take sick leave things should still be okay.
5516,Tide goes in tide goes out can't explain that
5517,"everyone needs to stay home and watch porn, or do something fun"
5518,He didn’t halt it enough though...
5519,Recent data says 2800 cases in kids under 18 in Utah.
5520,No deaths.
5521,"36 hospitalizations, 4 went to ICU."
5522,Most of the serious cases had underlying conditions.
5523,COVID is already serious enough without exaggerating.
5524,"Also, Utah has 7th lowest deaths per million in the US."
5525,Your doctor friend thinks it'll somehow be better anywhere else?
5526,it's what it's man
5527,"I guess our definitions of ""really bad"" are very different."
5528,"This is the death rate with lots of mitigation measures like social distancing, bans on large crowds, masks, etc."
5529,Other than Trump and DeSantis who is?
5530,Ah.
5531,I guess going to bars and movies is super important.
5532,/s.
5533,"If this is the worst thing we have to sacrifice, we got it easy."
5534,This is nothing compared to the 20s 40s and 60s.
5535,Wear a mask.
5536,"If you must see friends, make a bubble and set rules."
5537,It’s not hard.
5538,"Our group only orders groceries, never leaves, and we only see each other."
5539,It’s possible.
5540,I dont blame you for thinking that from the outside looking in.
5541,"I really have no interest in politics at all, but even to people like me who are very neutral it is clear as day the only people STILL calling for a lockdown are democrats, and their supporters."
5542,"The lockdown restrictions have severely hurt many aspects of my life, and my families life."
5543,Thats all lockdowns are doing at this point.
5544,"Sure, lockdowns are saving a few lives but at what cost."
5545,Thats why there is so much arguing and name calling.
5546,If you did live in US you would see it is NOTHING like the news would have you believe.
5547,The only thing keeping corona relevant is all the news stories and people talking about it.
5548,Dont be fooled into thinking corona is running rapid.
5549,I dont even know someone who knows someone who had covid.
5550,I have friends in many different states and its the same way all over.
5551,"Even if you do get it, 99% chance youre fine."
5552,Blown WAYYY out of proportion.
5553,"Yea but over the 100+ years we’ve known about flu, that disease has killed far more than Covid has."
5554,Check mate!
5555,Masks are for pansies!
5556,.../s
5557,Comparing a single day to a 7 day average doesn't make sense.
5558,"There's a lot more ""jews"" than these few... to my understanding specific neighborhoods are getting shut down because of high transmission..."
5559,It makes me want to scream that people want to do mental gymnastics to politicize a virus.
5560,"It's also worth noting that he knew he tested positive for covid before he went to debate Joe Biden, without a mask, in fact, hardly anybody on his side were wearing masks."
5561,Then he made fun of Biden for wearing masks during the debate.
5562,All while knowing he had covid.
5563,That's the type of asshole he is.
5564,That’s the first picture I’ve seen of trump with a mask on
5565,"Assuming that Trump loses in 2020, what will happen to the Republicans if Trump, uninvited, takes control of the Republican Party and becomes their presidential nominee in the 2024 presidential elections?"
5566,Other Republicans have been waiting years to run for President.
5567,"What if they all lose in the 2024 republican primaries, because Trump runs again after losing in 2020?"
5568,YA DON’T SAY
5569,Wow what a coincidence!
5570,!
5571,Made it sound like Bill Gates finally controlled the world and is injecting everyone with nanobots
5572,🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
5573,What facts do you want?
5574,Everyone is estimating even fauci and the cdc
5575,The videos were in front of green screens?
5576,"I see the overall points you're trying to make but Trump is a vain, narcissistic, idiot."
5577,That's why he has covid to begin with.
5578,"He's the most protected person in the whole world but he's so full of himself that he got covid because he refused to follow protocols, now he's willingly spreading it to service members, his staff, and planning on making public appearances."
5579,"He's a complete joke who is making everything worse, all to feed his ego/God complex."
5580,"Right... all that stuff was pretty much self-flattery, but when push comes to shove, nope."
5581,Hmm.
5582,I bet a dollar to a donut that he got the virus from the shithead-in-chief.
5583,Just a thought...
5584,Who would have known?
5585,"No, it’s fake news!"
5586,The mainstream don’t show you this - put bs research here -
5587,You mean we are going into cold and flu season?
5588,Go figure.
5589,How did we not see this coming when it happens every year?
5590,The problem isn't death.

5594,Lol @ “most countries”.
5595,Pretty much all of Europe would like to have a word.
5596,I generally see three or four shows a year (Brooklyn/NYC).
5597,One of the few things in life that gives me real joy.
5598,"Oddly enough, this March/April i had six shows lined up, was really excited to see some of my favorite new bands for the first time."
5599,I remember being at the beginning of March and just starting to wonder if I was going to go or not.
5600,What a strange time.
5601,"I can't imagine when I will feel safe to spend a couple hours in a dark, cramped space listening to some awesome music."
5602,I really feel for the performers and live music spaces and crews.
5603,2022 does seem like the earliest.
5604,Lol.
5605,Showing up and being admitted are two different things.
5606,"That may play some part, but CFRs are down across the board, similarly in countries with strong mask mandates and very little mask use."
5607,It has to be mostly something else.
5608,"When are we going to have our 1930's economic revolution, except instead of an angry economist writing about regulating companies, recession cycles &amp; stock market abuse in response to the great depression, it's about how SUSTAINABILITY and STEWARDSHIP = FUCKING GOOD ECONOMICS/BUSINESS?"
5609,"Its so painfully obvious that the better we take care of our people &amp; environment, that the better every business is able to operate."
5610,"So... painfully... obvious, but nobody seems to be getting the message because every institution we have is corrupted with giant unearned bags of money inherited by dimwitted boomers in the 70's &amp; 80's who grew up with too much latent radiation poisoning from nuclear tests dooming them to be terribly senile as they aged."
5611,"There was one with a dog who ""got"" covid but later finalized that it was just living in the nose and wasn't actually infected."
5612,Forgot which country it was from though...
5613,I guess mandating seat belts is a violation of human rights?
5614,I'm not very certain that our country is having 0 infection as informed because we dont implement wide public testing.
5615,Only significantly ill cases are tested for coronavirus.
5616,And we all know that majority of cases showed no symptom.
5617,Local tourism resumed but our tourist industry relies on foreign visit mostly.
5618,Restaurant are opening as usual but small ones are closing as they cant handle the rent.

5735,I work retail in a mall in a fairly rich and conservative city in California and the most jaw dropping thing I'm seeing is how many parents are bringing their kids out shopping with no masks on at all.
5736,I'm not talking once every now and then I'm talking a HEAVY vast majority put 0 mask on their kids and bring them to a crowded mall.
5737,"I once told a lady she couldn't bring her kid in the store without a mask and she flipped out, called me ""stupid fucking re**rd"" then demanded to speak to the manager."
5738,When I told her I was the manager she had her husband jump the security rope (we use it to make sure the store doesn't go over capacity) get in my face and demand my name and take my picture saying there would be legal action taken.
5739,These people are out every day and it's sad because it seems to me they care more about being right than their own childs safety.
5740,Accurate according to the USA.
5741,You mean this year.
5742,And I would like to see those scientific studies you claimed to exist which shows how covid19 death is completely preventable by social distancing and mask-wearing?
5743,If lying was a criminal offense we would have no politicians around anymore and most people would be in jail.
5744,Maybe not a bad suggestion in the end.
5745,It is 100% fair because the people who politicized it are the only ones who can change that.

5750,"&gt;[**The Great Barrington Declaration**](https://gbdeclaration.org/)

&gt;As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection."
5751,"&gt;Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people."
5752,Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health.
5753,"The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden."
5754,Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.
5755,"&gt;Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed."
5756,"&gt;Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing."
5757,We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young.
5758,"Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza."
5759,"&gt;As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all – including the vulnerable – falls."
5760,We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e.
5761,the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine.
5762,Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.
5763,"&gt;The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk."
5764,We call this Focused Protection.
5765,&gt;Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19.
5766,"By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors."
5767,Staff rotation should be minimized.
5768,Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home.
5769,"When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside."
5770,"A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals."
5771,&gt;Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.
5772,"Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold."
5773,Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching.
5774,"Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed."
5775,"Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home."
5776,Restaurants and other businesses should open.
5777,"Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume."
5778,"People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity."
5779,"&gt;_On October 4, 2020, this declaration was authored and signed in Great Barrington, United States, by:_

&gt;**Dr. Martin Kulldorff**, professor of medicine at Harvard University, a biostatistician, and epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety evaluations."
5780,"&gt;**Dr. Sunetra Gupta**, professor at Oxford University, an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology, vaccine development, and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases."
5781,"&gt;**Dr. Jay Bhattacharya**, professor at Stanford University Medical School, a physician, epidemiologist, health economist, and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and vulnerable populations."

5786,"depends on what you consider ""safe""."
5787,"Some countries use 3', some use 2m, some use 10'  Others have nothing at all."
5788,Is there evidence that physical separation from one another reduces the spread and load of the virus when an infected individual is present?
5789,Yes.
5790,Can you still contract the virus at distances greater than 6'?
5791,Also yes.
5792,Should you make the best decision for you and the people with which you're regularly in contact when it comes to whether or not you visit a space where you might come in contact with circulated air or be closer than 10' from other people?
5793,Also yes.
5794,Not that hard.
5795,I'm not sure if this can be called the second wave if the daily cases remain above 4k since May.
5796,Is this true?
5797,Please provide a source.
5798,"Worth noting that due to multiple false positives in the past combined with lack of symptoms, he may have just been waiting on a result to confirm a false positive, that never arrived."
5799,"I myself have had 4 false positives from different clinics in Miami, all negated by taking a 2nd test within the following 2 days."
5800,"However I must tell you on the 3rd and 4th I didn’t even social distance afterwards, because I had no symptoms and my experience with 2 false positives before."
5801,I kind of just assumed I would be right about them being false (3&amp;4) and I was right.
5802,Trump probably assumed the same and happened to be wrong.
5803,"That’s life, I wouldn’t shit on someone for that."
5804,He was also like 10 ft away from the nearest person at the debate.
5805,According to fauci that’s more than enough distance for an infected person to be out and about.
5806,"They’re one of a small handful of countries (including Mexico and Zambia) where Americans can travel without having to quarantine in place in 14 days, so I wonder if their goal is to bring in American tourists?"
5807,"No, it will not, because all the measures taken to prevent Covid also prevent the normal flu."

5820,Being a morbidly obese man with coronavirus in the hospital isn't a death sentence.
5821,Paul Waldron the morbidly obese county commissioner in Florida who voted against a mask mandate right before he went into the hospital with Covid-19 is out of the hospital and back at work.
5822,"Of course, there have been plenty of patients with that preexisting condition who did die."

6262,That's not how this works.
6263,The reduction in infections can be cause by many other things (instead of or in addition to) the mask mandate.

6359,"If Brazil, Mexico, the UK, Italy, Peru, Spain, and France all had 100% infection, that's 750 million people."
6360,Sounds pretty unlikely.
6361,Where are/were these 715 million cases?
6362,That's all I ask - is for someone to say that they believe that the actual totals are:India - 300 millionChina - 300 millionUSA - 100 millionand so on.
6363,So they tested and found 10% have antibodies in places.
6364,Great.
6365,That's local sampling.
6366,Show me the work - how can they extract that to 10% global infection?
6367,Tell me which countries make up the 700 million missing cases and I'll shut up.
6368,Is it 10% of every country?
6369,A couple of countries with large populations that hid hundreds of millions of cases?
6370,Are you telling me these hundreds of millions of cases were so mild that no one bothered to seek medical treatment for them?
6371,"If so, does that mean that overall, this thing isn't deadly at all?"
6372,Because the stats for places like New York state sure seem to imply that it's pretty damn deadly.
6373,"I'm confused - either this thing infected 700 million people and NO ONE NOTICED or Dr. Ryan is pulling numbers out of his ass, because he said ""10% infected globally"" not ""10% infected in pockets around the globe."""

6473,"I’d be shocked, if 10% of the entire world population has been infected."
6474,Giving a point estimate without a range is close to scientific malfeasance.
6475,The WHO needs to do a better job with their messaging.
6476,Still think that?
6477,"&gt;Or over zoom

lol"
6478,Not in my state.
6479,We’ve been smart.
6480,Our deaths per capita are way below the average and we have a lot of restrictions in place.
6481,We are doing it the right way.
6482,"As a California resident, this makes me both happy and sad."
6483,"Sad because of the layoffs but happy because I hope this will severly discourage out-of-staters from coming here until the pandemic is over, ESPECIALLY from the anti-mask states."
6484,I also can't help but wonder and be completely baffled as to why California hasn't enacted a 14-day quarantine policy for people traveling here from out of state like other states have started doing months ago; NJ for example.
6485,Oh more Houston level fake hysteria.
6486,I'm fucking shocked.
6487,"*Americans trying to flee to Canada*
""no, they expect to find one of us at the wreckage brother"""
6488,Basically 100% infection?
6489,"Honestly, that's completely normal."
6490,"It's an invisible enemy, and people aren't that smart."
6491,This is why a *mandate* is essential.
6492,"Here in Singapore, there was initially some uproar when a mask mandate was enforced (uproar here means people complaining but still doing it because we have an authoritarian government)."
6493,"Now, 6 months later with almost 0 community spread while other countries are unfortunately still sufferring, the strict actions taken (make mandate, social distancing measures etc.)"
6494,has turned non-believers into believers.
6495,What is the age distribution of that country and what does that mean for the expected death rate at 100% infection?

6498,"Idk, I've never seen a saggy snake before."
6499,I guess there's that flappy spitty Dino from jurassic Park... Maybe he's hiding his flappies?
6500,"After hitting send thought: he could also be Denobulin, and covering up his inflatable face with human face skin..."
6501,"Then the federal government needs to stop spreading misinformation, because they (Trump) obviously influenced the idiots of the country to be against masks, which in turn put pressure on governors not to enforce mask-wearing."
6502,Why didn't you wear a mask before 2020 then?
6503,Did you just not understand science?
6504,"Those are averages derived from statistical models, not actual reported influenza deaths."
6505,"In reality, the number of people that die from the flu each year is much lower."
6506,"Sadly, it's the opposite for COVID-19, at least for the next year or two."
6507,Please open your eyes and read the story.
6508,"Take off your blinders, gogels and get out of your echo chambers."
6509,Was sick prior to Sept 26.
6510,This is false.
6511,They accurately predicted the deaths in our state since March.
6512,Has that been a problem?
6513,The fats?
6514,At this moment our eleven biggest cities talk with Chancellor Merkel.
6515,"I predicted this happening back in June and got told""you're full of shit, stop spreading fear!"""
6516,Below 300 people got those mAbs and at this pace of the pandemic production is only possible for a tiny fraction of cases.
6517,"Sweden has a deathrate of 58 per 100.000, the UK 64."
6518,"It is not like, they are golden in sweden."
6519,"Also as already mentioned,  Swedish residents followed logical safety guidelines simply by being asked."
6520,Do you want the vaccine to stop all cases or just the asymptomatic ones?
6521,Berlin Neukölln has already incidence over 100.

6529,100% agree.
6530,Japan's response is basically like America's if people actually listened to the government and followed safety precautions.
6531,"The response has been minimal, overall."
6532,The government really hasn't done much from what I can tell.
6533,Testing really only occurs in the event of a fever... any other symptoms without a fever and they will turn you way.
6534,"The PEOPLE though wear masks everywhere, limit contact, use hand sanitizer, and somewhat social distance."
6535,"Also, people in Japan generally seem quite healthy, so maybe that has helped."
6536,"Because there aren't many guidelines, businesses, for the most part, have all remained open and malls continue to be packed on the weekends (even during rises in cases.)."
6537,"I'm honestly shocked things haven't been that bad over here (I'm in Osaka, Japan)."
6538,Walk around the city or a park on the weekend and you would never even know Covid was a thing...
6539,[removed]
6540,"Yup, Milwaukee county here."
6541,You'll get shamed if your not wearing one.
6542,Is that the one conservatives argued against last year because it used aborted fetuses or is it the other one?
6543,"Either way, you won't hear a peep from them about it this year"
6544,"&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line , people don't feel safe going out and about like pre corona days."
6545,They would if we lifted restrictions and stopped reporting about it.
6546,Flu season starts about a month or two after kids go back to school.
6547,Even in Florida.
6548,"Really hope the ban on mink farms in Europe will kill the fur industry, for the sake of these little guys."
6549,But Serbia is surrounded by countries with much infections.
6550,Only greece does still relatively well.
6551,Competent healthcare professionals are in high demand across all of Europe.
6552,"In case of a surge in covid cases, they will have to stop doing elective surgeries and concentrate on treating covid patients and emergiencies."

6555,"If there are 80% vaccines coming in six weeks, there should be 50% vaccines now."
6556,Get them approved.
6557,You can just calculate that from the last seven days of new cases
6558,"As long as they are paid by someone, they are never unbiased."

6563,"Dunno, the whole article is a bit weird, I first thought it was from Monday where Sweden is not reporting any cases but they clearly write Wednesday for Italy/Germany ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
6564,I agree with you on all fronts.
6565,The only thing I would like to see is maybe during flu season for ppl to start wearing masks.
6566,Or at least in certain environments.
6567,Restaurant kitchens for example.
6568,Or other places that can lead to widespread infections.
6569,I hate this.

6579,"Make sure nobody *eats* anymore, it might spread through food"
6580,So if the Whitehouse head of security dies of Covid-19 and then later Trump gets assassinated was it really just Covid-19 that killed Trump ?
6581,🤔
6582,"As far as I know from colleagues in China, they are already back to work and many are out and about travelling during their week of national day celebrations."
6583,I see pictures with people not in masks.
6584,"Yea, they can keep lying and suppressing information."
6585,But you can't keep a virus silent.
6586,"“China joining COVAX serves a dual purpose of filling the leadership vacuum left by the United States in terms of global public health, and in terms of securing a future vaccine for its population,” said Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia."
6587,"----

The United States, the world’s largest economy, declined to join under President Donald Trump, saying the alliance was “influenced by the corrupt WHO and China.” China has the second-largest economy in the world."
6588,Why don't you go find some if you are so sure we are lying?
6589,"Instead, you just sit around repeating what's been said a thousand times."
6590,Useless as ever.
6591,And older people should absolute get that one.
6592,But it will not help against Covid.
6593,Hm?
6594,Kids below 16 haven't lost a day of school.
6595,Good thing normal healthy people don’t die from COVID.
6596,Even trump handled it just fine.
6597,Look at the statistics
6598,&gt;And of course most of senior staff are old because it takes years to climb the ranks and make it to the White House.
6599,"That was in the before times, now with Trump heading things, you just have to vaguely know him, or have given him money at some point in your life, and you too can be the acting head of the NSA, CIA SEC, etc..."
6600,"Yes if it makes you happy, why not."
6601,Doesn't hurt us anyway.
6602,"Different groups getting infected, can be another reason."
6603,"First wave hit basically everyone equally, since worst spread happened before anyone was taking preventative measures."
6604,"It was made worse by lack of PPE and testing, so medical personel weren't able to stop the spread among vulnerables (care homes, hospitals)."
6605,Now the most vulnerable and medical personel are better protected.
6606,The slightly vulnerable are still cautious and the disease is mostly infecting otherwise healthy working age adults or school children.
6607,"Grandparents can't stay isolated for ever, but they are still avoiding big events and doing social distancing."
6608,I think Christmas will be the real test.
6609,So many people going home to their families.
6610,And I guess Thanks Giving for our friends in the US.
6611,"But also, this will be 3 weeks after election, who knows what this will bring."
6612,That's not good news.
6613,Rush the vaccine.
6614,Them making an attempt to stop it would be irrelevant.

6632,Second waves are inevitable with a virus this contagious.
6633,The science has been predicting this for months now.
6634,But do you want a second wave to start after the first killed $200k+ or much less?
6635,Also - lots of evidence we never left the first wave.
6636,Liberals making covid into a political issue was probably the most disgusting thing I’ve seen.

6676,We had so many deaths here early on (still worst in the US for deaths/pop) that our compliance is better.
6677,Nowhere near the number of Covid deniers.
6678,Many more who believe in science (which is something before this I never realized was not near universal in first-world countries).
6679,I wasn’t commenting on number of Covid deaths.
6680,"We’ve had way, way more."
6681,"I am dutch, but lived in Korea for the majority of this year and i'm deeply embarrassed by the actions of the dutch government."
6682,They knew it was coming and did not act until it was way too late.
6683,They made many wrong decisions and refuse to act for the people opposed to the economy.
6684,The Netherlands gathered more coronapatients in 1 week than South Korea did in the entire year.
6685,It really is appaling and i'm ashamed of my fellow countrymen
6686,"Sure, when they're doing something worth monitoring, the US has approximately 150 spy satellites, you really think they're capable of monitoring every ship at every moment."

6700,????
6701,how?
6702,Let's be *extremely* generous and assume that China's entire army invaded all at once (2.18 million).
6703,"Let us be further generous and assume that they have occupied the United States with zero resistance and took no significant casualties, as well as ignoring the fact that a very large percentage of those are support personnel and not ground troops."
6704,How exactly do you expect them to prevent the US population from organizing and arming themselves when you have a ratio of 150 civilians to 1 soldier?
6705,We don't have a lot of nurses and doctors to care for all those beds though.
6706,Berlin (Charite) voiced concerns about staffing today.
6707,"They warn that severe cases may need to be transported to other places in Germany if the situation worsens, possibly far away from Berlin."
6708,"They only have 38 Covid-19 ICU patients, which is 3.1% of capacity, but only 195 (15.9% of total capcity) of ICU beds are empty and available right now."
6709,"And I guess you want to have some of them available all the time, just in case a terrorist attack happens or Russian opposition politicians need a post-Novitchok treatment."
6710,So not a good start for the second wave.

6716,"Textbook exponential growth would be R = 2 (aka, every infected person infects two others)."
6717,"In the US, the current growth is just above 1 nationally, which means that while the pandemic is not spreading as fast as we feared earlier in the year when NYC took a hard hit, it's not going away either."

6743,"Cases are largely irrelevant as long as they resolve themselves without incident, especially because that brings us closer to herd immunity."

6746,"In my city, which the hospitals are already straining and cases almost doubling every 10 days, they cannot even dare talking about closing restaurants and bars."

6754,So?
6755,"If it does last forever (it probably will, I'm telling you), it lasts forever."
6756,You're just going to have to adapt to the new normal.
6757,Just like so many experts have been saying recently.
6758,All because of our collective impatience and inherent selfishness.
6759,We're screwed.
6760,Everybody made up their mind about what this virus is and the proper way to exist in March and they're not going to move off it.
6761,"It's not ""just the flu"" but it's also not airborne Ebola."
6762,"Good luck getting people to move to a middle ground on... well, just about any issue."
6763,Trump is a blind squirrel who found a nut when he said we need to learn to live with the virus.
6764,But one side wants to live *despite* the virus and keep doing things as if it doesn't exist.
6765,The other side takes the hardline stance that we can't even try to live somewhat normally until the virus is gone.
6766,There's no bringing those two sides together.
6767,"Better safe than sorry, if this goes wrong it will destroy the face of vaccins and many people will stop vaccinating putting lots of people at risk of otherwise preventable diseases."

6778,Make up your mind instead of just spewing whatever bullshit you think might stick.
6779,When asked about the polarization surrounding mask use.
6780,"&gt;A: Yeah, that's ridiculous."
6781,It's just an absurdity.
6782,We wear seatbelts.
6783,"We don't smoke in trains, planes or taxis anymore, or even restaurants."
6784,There's reasons for those things.
6785,I don't know.
6786,I feel like there's this twist on the idea of personal freedom where somehow freedom is you being able to walk into anybody's house and take a dump on their meal or shout ugly things at their grandma.
6787,That's not what freedom is.
6788,"Freedom is the ability to pursue your lifestyle, pursue what you want to do for your family, for your future, what education you want to get."
6789,"And with that freedom comes a responsibility to look out for yourself, for your neighbor, for your family, for everybody."
6790,So there are some compromises that come along with freedom.
6791,I'm not sure why that's so difficult to grasp.

6920,During lockdown you would get a swab only if you had a cough AND 37.5 temp.

6934,Movie theaters?
6935,Reopened jine 15th.
6936,It's because of the evil tourists bringing back the virus and italy reopening for money?
6937,Foreign travel allowed since june 15th.
6938,Public transportation and smart working?
6939,The state of emergency and smart working rules have been extended to jan 31st 2021 and they are the same as may 18th.

7114,They are claiming a lot of daily tests right now but not sure how reliable that is.
7115,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rapid-antigen-test-now-30-of-indias-testing-load/article32271183.ece
7116,isnt this feature belongs to most eu countries as well?
7117,"Absolutely, choices for WFH need to remain regardless."
7118,I don't even like hybrid now.
7119,... You think it's weird for an American news company to focus on American news?
7120,Okay.
7121,How kind of you
7122,No sympathy for anyone asking for sympathy.
7123,In other words you’re lazy and you don’t really care to ost the truth
7124,Awesome!
7125,"Thankyou, i will definitely check them out"
7126,Hard to swallow.
7127,Isn't authoritarianism awesome?
7128,"Strongmen, as it turns out, aren't so good for the people under their rule."
7129,They continue to choose strongmen as their leaders.
7130,You are not stopping you spreading of lies.
7131,That’s pretty obvious...
7132,[removed]
7133,"Sure but if you clocked the amount of time each patient needed a respirator it does shorten it, like I said if people are dying due to not having access to ventilator it would help a little, less promising then I was hoping for tho."
7134,I don’t care about wearing a mask.
7135,"Punishment is the complete ending of any cultural and social activities that take place indoors, being unable to mix with groups of people, the misery of unemployment and financial strain, ending freedom of travel, and living in a climate of fear."
7136,"Given that my chance of being on a ventilator is very, very close to zero, this is a punishment that is completely out of proportion."
7137,"Define “spiked” 

That word is literally meaningless without some numbers, it’s like when CNN says cases “surge”"
7138,"We don't administer it unless there's a compelling reason but still, 500 people died in the US of TB last year."
7139,That's 500 too many.
7140,"Just one life is worth it, right?"
7141,Laughs in hindi
7142,Can business like disney/movie theaters/etc survive being shut down for so long?
7143,"I'm not suggesting if they can't, that override health concerns."
7144,I'm more wondering what on earth the landscape is going to look like once we finally 'beat' covid.
7145,Regal just closed all their theaters for the rest of the year.
7146,I haven't gone to a theater since February and certainly will not be going any time this fall or winter.
7147,Can business like that survive a year of zero income and virtually all the same expenses?
7148,+44
7149,Where should I look for truthful and accurate info on the Virus?
7150,My roommate seems to be pretty anti-media info on the virus and states its blown way out of proportion and that masks don't do anything.
7151,He made a post saying the death rate is like .002% of people affected.
7152,"Arnold would’ve made a great president, if not for the whole natural-born citizen thing."
7153,&gt; It's a 10min video so I'm assuming you can summarize the issues discussed.
7154,His speech is a couple minutes in the beginning.
7155,You can watch it yourself.
7156,The rest is commentary that explains all your questions.
7157,You can watch that as well if you want.
7158,"It's only ten minutes, not two hours."
7159,Okay so what’s 70/178000.... .03%.
7160,"I don’t have a problem with masks, I have a problem with over reactionary lockdowns and draconian measures that destroy businesses, opportunities, quality of life, and future well being at a virus that most people who test positive for don’t even know they have and recover in a few days."
7161,How many people had it and didn’t even know or test positive?
7162,That 178000 should be a lot higher and the percentage even lower.
7163,Schools and universities fully operating.
7164,Government asking people to go to cinemas and pubs.
7165,Revoked permissions for working from home.
7166,"The common decency in most people is if your going out to get a service, you should tip."
7167,Most rational people know that this is how most of these workers make their money.
7168, You need 12 packs of toilet paper to wipe the fans clean?
7169,Uruguay is doing exceptionally well.
7170,"Lot's of factors help: they're small, relatively wealthy and generally capable of political unity in the face of the crisis."
7171,But they really are the only bright spot in South America.
7172,I hope it holds.
7173,"Edit to add: [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uruguay/) says 2,226 cases (640/million) and 49 deaths (14/million) So, by those metrics, right between Japan and Hong Kong."
7174,Those are rookie number
7175,"Let this sink it:

The virus is going to spread."
7176,You can slow it down.
7177,Hard lock downs can pause things.
7178,Masks may help in some limited situations but the idea that you can avoid the virus burning through the population is beyond asinine.
7179,Test-trace-isolate is a fantasy.
7180,Not happening unless you're an island that acted very early and sealed yourself off.
7181,Lockdowns only delay things.
7182,Masks in the real world are far less effective than talking heads will admit which is why for the last 100 years the experts all said masks were mostly ineffective.
7183,It was only in April that suddenly changed based on nothing.
7184,There is nothing special about Sars-Cov-2 that suddenly makes masks effective.
7185,The science didn't change.
7186,The only thing that changed is experts wanted to give people the idea that there was something they can do.
7187,It's a placebo.
7188,"Spain, Italy, LA, Hawaii, etc all show masks aren't doing much at all."
7189,How can you say that?
7190,How do you know that those wearing masks were infected?
7191,What if the opposite happened?
7192,Still in power last time I checked.
7193,[deleted]
7194,That was not a problem.
7195,The virus was defeated at this point.
7196,And I for one am glad I could enjoy a nice summer.
7197,The fuckup came with failing track and trace system afterwards...
7198,That's still like 50x less impactful on mortality than your age.
7199,"That's a good point, and an important distinction to make."
7200,One major codicil a case now isn’t the same as a case in March.
7201,"Testing was sparse in March, testing probably captured only 5-10% of actual cases, testing now probably captures 20-25% of actual cases."
7202,You need the confirmed case numbers now to be double the March numbers to represent approximately the same # of cases.
7203,"Yes, those ~numbers are very loose but the ordinality is correct."
7204,Which issues and what specifically about them is he agreeing on?
7205,It's a 10min video so I'm assuming you can summarize the issues discussed.
7206,"Also, why would that be surprising?"
7207,The majority of issues we all are concerned about are largely shared and likely broad enough that there is agreement on some aspect of the issue.
7208,The difference usually lays in how to confront the issue.
7209,... is it because they ramped up testing?
7210,If yes this headline gives off the wrong idea
7211,[deleted]
7212,read the article.
7213,"&gt;Dr. Gil Wright, Metro's Associate Medical Director of Clinical Service, said the state had contacted the city with the news."
7214,Dr. Wright said the first shipment will be received on November 10 with enough to vaccinate about 1/3 of first responders and high risk individuals.
7215,"&gt;The vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, have yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but Dr. Wright says they are expected to be safe and so far, there have not been many reports of side effects."
7216,There shouldn't be.
7217,"Vitamine D levels will raise about 1 month after starting supplementation, so it doesn't really matter how the dose is spaced out."
7218,We don’t lock down the country from TB because we already have a vaccine for it.
7219,&gt;Any sauce for this inevitable skyrocketing?
7220,I keep seeing cases stack up while deaths stabilize.
7221,"Again, this is what you guys said about the outbreaks in the US in June, then you scurried away when deaths spiked in July."
7222,I'm not playing your little games.
7223,You have zero interest in having an honest discussion.
7224,"Same in Portugal - schools opened 3 weeks ago, now cases (and hospitalisations) are spiking."
7225,"Okay then, the same was at Mugello unfortunately and I’m afraid it will be like that at Imola and Turkey unfortunately"
7226,It's been mentioned in several articles.
7227,I don't know anything about vaccines so for all I know the articles are wrong.
7228,I haven't hear any reason to believe they are false though.
7229,Do you have any data or sources to back up that claim?
7230,At this point it feels like China is just trolling Trump.
7231,It was fake news that he got the virus.
7232,"Look at him, how could he."
7233,Yeah.
7234,And just too much uncertainty and stress for them.
7235,Herd immunity will happen before a vaccine.
7236,Been saying it awhile and nobody wants to admit it.
7237,By the time a vaccine happens (ie it is widely available) the virus will have faded into the background.
7238,"The ""wait for a vaccine"" proponents have been living in fantasy land since this started."
7239,"this post, this literal fucking post"
7240,All human lives are so important.
7241,It's never right to hate a whole country is it?
7242,European countries are proving that masks in public space is not working.
7243,"At least in the Uk, it seems pretty blatant that they saw this as a golden opportunity to help push back the impending pension crisis by wiping out the pensioners."
7244,"That being said, hindsight makes things much clearer."
7245,Maybe they really did think that they were taking the best approach.
7246,"After all, their initial response was planned with the help of Imperial, supposed experts."
7247,Seriously... every single post about COVID brings up hundreds of vitriolic comments about the US and Americans.
7248,That guy is just an idiot for thinking that Russians are get critiqued as harshly on this thread.
7249,Most comments are quite civil.
7250,That's absolutely horrifying but I can't help but be distracted by that anime character in the picture.
7251,What's their story?
7252,"I don’t mean to sound like an asshole, but where is their vaccine?"
7253,The vaccine will come too late.
7254,No.
7255,The results of phases 1 and 2 are [published in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31866-3/fulltext#).
7256,"There have been [some criticism](https://cattiviscienziati.com/2020/09/07/note-of-concern/) of the results, however, but the paper isn't retracted as of now."
7257,"Yep, we are again discussing the very basics, something that even elementary school children understand."
7258,People who get infected don't die on day 1.
7259,They die later.
7260,Hence there's a lag.
7261,It's all very simple.
7262,Because of an antigenic shift that occurred.
7263,That has nothing do with this situation.
7264,The comparisons to this and the 1918 2nd wave are totally devoid of any factual comparison.
7265,"I’m sensing from the tone and number of replies you’re sending me that you’re in a rough spot and troubled, but I don’t appreciate being threatened or called a murderer by an internet stranger."
7266,Viruses have existed for billions of years and will exist alongside us for all of our lifetimes.
7267,They have claimed the lives of hundreds of millions if not billions over the course of history.
7268,When they become endemic like COVID-19 has in most of the world they are unstoppable without a vaccine.
7269,Trying to collectively halt social mixing over a prolonged period of time is an unprecedented measure that has never been attempted successfully in history.
7270,Suggesting that we shouldn’t have the arrogance to think we can turn back the tide (at enormous self harm to ourselves) isn’t murder.
7271,"Of course, if you think ever allowing the spread of a fatal disease is murder, then you have been a murderer every year of your life that you’ve socialised while a deadly flu has been in circulation."
7272,Dont feel bad for them.
7273,They are raking in cash and paying very little tax on it.
7274,Its a very good gig.
7275,It's too late.
7276,People don't care anymore.
7277,They want their life back (as people told me also here on Reddit).
7278,They want to go to parties and everything.
7279,And they are already doing it.
7280,Which is already spreading the virus at a much larger scale.
7281,Christmas will get very interesting.
7282,But for sure not surprising.
7283,Wait... ALL of Russia??
7284,Still not on par with Florida...
7285,"hmm are you saying a state with 0 pediatric deaths, if they move to the northeast?"
7286,Yeah i wouldn't be surprised how 0+1 cases would massively almost all everyone move northeast.
7287,"Being the sarcasm that I am, that sarcastically a possibility"
7288,"Yup, loss of smell is an early sign."

7423,I live in Southern Utah where the national  parks are and tourists  keep coming in.
7424,from all over the country.
7425,They think it is safe because it is a park or rural?
7426,It is crazy thinking because rural America lacks hospitals and doctors.
7427,"COVID or not, you do not want to get sick or hurt in some parts of rural America."
7428,"Our hospital had been hanging on , but with the surge of accidents from the national parks like ATV, Boats, and DUI;s those alone filled the ICU, forget about COVID that now has surged."
7429,My son had asthma and we drive over 800 miles to see a pulmantologist so why again would people want to be a tourists in a place with very limited pulmanology care during a disease like COVID.
7430,"Crazy yet, lots of people from CA are staying!"
7431,I will admit the economy is very good.
7432,"My high school aged child has friends making 40k easy this year , I can't image at 15 or 16 making 40k so there are tons of jobs  but no housing for people from CA or other states staying."
7433,It is turning into what ND was 10 years ago during the oil boom.
7434,"People sleeping in cars, or if lucky pay $800 to rent a bunk in a room."
7435,Some posted in another thread it is happening in MT too.
7436,It is not just bringing illness back and forth.
7437,"It is a whole community changing, real estate out of sight, homelessness issues for the first time and so much crime."
7438,"My daughter and I sat in the main shopping center off the freeway in the parking lot and counted the out of state cars, trucks and RVS and and in the last week we have seen every state, highest number is CA, but then NY and MA are next and they are 2,000 miles away."

7464,"You must be against licensing for medical doctors too, right?"
7465,"Why should we limits people's rights to attempt to perform medical procedures, just because they know nothing about medicine?"

7512,Masks just keep respiratory droplets from ourselves and helps keep spread down significantly.
7513,"With them and increasing adoption of the vaccine over the first few months of their release we should be able to have concerts and events at reduced capacity, no?"

If I may incline, I'm quite familiar with the situation working in similar situations."
7555,"In terms of ""didn't specify deaths were from covid"" would be something a doctor cannot disclose because HIPAA."
7556,"In terms of mortality:

[AAP's 10/1 most recent updated numbers in Utah:](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/)  5,435 peds cases, 66 hospitalizations, and 0 deaths."
7557,Here is some evidence to shed light on the situation given the difficulties of manuevering around  HIPAA laws.
7558,"Most importantly, you hit on something I cannot agree more and I cannot preach any louder."
7559,"With the kindness you have already shown, could you erase the child deaths related to this message altogether?"
7560,"During this time of increasing anxiety and confirmation bias, there's a highly likely to see literally ""2 children"" ""Covid"" and trigger more anxiety on accident."
7561,"&amp;#x200B;

While we should always acknowledge the priority of protecting our children and patients as the most important, it's quite easy to forget the caretaker that is caring for the patient."
7562,"Also, don't forget about the children's parents as well."
7563,"A situation with high emotions can be stressful amongst many players that the public reasonably forgets, given the many networks we forget."
7564,"&amp;#x200B;

As a caretaker, I personally know many who has dealt what you've alluded to."
7565,"As a minority, I personally know friends who has family members die from coronavirus."
7566,"As a son, I am also afraid of my mom and dad catching coronavirus."
7567,"As a caretaker, wouldn't it be easy to express our anxiety, fear, anger and project it on the wrong person?"
7568,say...
7569,If I yell at the kid?
7570,If I yell at their parents?
7571,If I yell at a nurse?

One thing as a moderator for awhile is hearing the words ""main point of doctors drastically affected from covid."""

7578,While it is truly important to remember the frontlines **humans** protecting other **humans**.
7579,"remember **you are human** and the public **humans** , everyone needs to remember what they are mad about in the first place."

7593,"As a Coaster Enthusiast from South Dakota, I have visited a few parks during the pandemic, and here are some observations:
Parks are enforcing masks, social distancing, cleaning, as well as providing hand sanitizer better than major retailers, restaurants, as well as any business in western South Dakota."
7594,"Enthusiasts know that parks are special and are willing to make personal comfort sacrifices (wearing masks, longer waits, digital queues) to enjoy the parks."
7595,"At a enthusiast event back in August at Holiday World in indiana, masks were only mandatory indoors, but not out on the midways."
7596,"When the park was open to the public, there was a stark contrast between the local ""general public"" and the enthusiasts, with most, if not all wearing masks in non required areas, social distancing in non virtual queues, and frequently using hand sanitizer."
7597,"What I am getting at, is not everyone who goes to the parks has complete disregard for the pandemic, and many are passionate and will have no problem taking the precautions necessary if it means they get to spend a day in the parks."

7725,"a real, live knuckle-dragger!"
7726,"In common parlance, the term ""exponential growth"" implies an accelerating rate of increase."
7727,A compounding effect.
7728,"It implies that the growth isn't linear, which is an important distinction, even when the exact details aren't known."
7729,"So I definitely wouldn't say that it ""literally means nothing"" without knowing the specific exponent - particularly in general conversation."

7797,However criticizing democrats in October 2020 is not going to deliver cleaner water or any other forms of environmental progress.

7799,We saw it in 2016 and we are seeing it now.
7800,&gt; The reason we can’t have nice things like universal healthcare and a basic living wage are because people seem to think we only have two options which are the status quo and are clearly not working in American citizens favor.
7801,Bullshit.
7802,The reason why we don't have those things is because of Neoliberal Republican policies from Goldwater to the present.
7803,We had a middle class without raging income inequality when Reagan took office in 1980.
7804,They played on racism and other various attacks on progress to get people to vote against their own interests.
7805,Hillary Clinton attempted to get universal healthcare in the 90s.

7822,"The chart I'm looking at says on July 24th USA peaked at 74,885."
7823,Off the cuff that was a pretty good estimate.
7824,"I mean, I think the drastic drop in heart attack, stroke, and other emergent patients visiting the ER that was seen back in March and April is a pretty decent piece of evidence that deaths likely increased there for a time."
7825,"I'll agree that we aren't seeing large amounts of delayed care for non-emergent situations killing people, but that's because it takes time."
7826,Delayed cancer screenings now are deaths in 2021 or 2022.
7827,The car accident example also doesn't hold much water.
7828,"In 2019, just shy of 39000 people in the US died in car accidents."
7829,"In May, [NPR reported](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859829779/as-states-locked-down-in-march-motor-vehicle-fatality-rate-spiked-by-14) that motor vehicle fatality rates only dropped by 8% - there were fewer cars on the road but more deaths per mile driven."
7830,"Even if we assume that the 8% drop holds true all year (unlikely, given that traffic has resumed to near 2019 levels), that's still only 3120 averted deaths."
7831,A drop in the bucket in comparison to the numbers we're looking at.
7832,The [excess Alzheimer's deaths](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/16/coronavirus-dementia-alzheimers-deaths/?arc404=true) alone more than make up for the decrease in car crash fatalities.

7848,Simple math.

7851,Every country in the southern hemisphere is declining as their summer approaches while countries in the further northern altitudes are getting much worse as winter approaches??

7994,70% is at this point appears to be a major overestimate.

7996,"And, infection rates will  overshoot the Herd Immunity threshold, the overshoot may be very large (~2x) if the outbreak is totally uncontrolled."
7997,A reasonable urban environment with even moderate protective measures should reach herd immunity at much lower levels (probably somewhere in the 20-40% range but again this can be overshoot).
7998,[1] Quatar migrant worker communities have also reached about that level of infection.

8051,The youtube video latest less than a week because it was clear these doctors had no idea what sampling bias was.
8052,So much for 40 years of medical work.
8053,"&gt;  In a rare statement late today, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine declared they “emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Messihi."
8054,These reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19.
8055,"As owners of local urgent care clinics, it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public’s health.”

8068,Hell if I know.
8069,The problem is people stopped following it.
8070,Keeping a lockdown isnt realistic after 10 weeks which is why weve seen almost no country go beyond it.
8071,Did you not look at the results?
8072,There is definitely a significant difference based on party affiliation.
8073,Are you going to deny that?
8074,That fucking visor (faceshield) is so dumb!!!
8075,"Like how is it even acceptable to wear that instead of a proper mask, especially the small ones that only cover the bottom half of your mouth?"

8141,"In many instances, only the worst are going to be found through testing, since many of those who are asymptomatic or currently pre-symptomatic will not have any testing performed."
8142,[deleted]
8143,Kinda why we need a national coordinated response.
8144,"Now we have states just really getting started on Wave 1, other states are (kinda sorta) stabilizing, others have gotten better, and others are looking at Wave 2."
8145,"But no, let’s get every state doing things differently and on different timelines."
8146,I’m suuuuuure the citizens of the US won’t travel to other states that have different restrictions.
8147,"I fully trust the people actually putting in the time and doing all the work, and I'm thankful for how many of those people there are."
8148,But I definitely dont trust the people at our institutions whose main contributions are PR stunts.
8149,"&gt; Traveling for work is not the same as travelling to gather in a amusement park, and 120 miles would allow people from different counties to travel and meet at the amusement park."
8150,The counties are on different levels from each other.
8151,People are traveling for more than just work though.
8152,People are crossing county lines to do all sorts of things from work to leisure.
8153,It’s not as though people are containing themselves to only doing things in their counties.
8154,"Also, I don’t know how familiar you are with Southern California, but trying to actually identify where some cities and counties begin and end is pretty difficult without a map."
8155,You can drive from one city to the next constantly surrounded by buildings and other urban developments never knowing what city you’re currently in unless there’s some kind of signage or you have a map on you.
8156,"Also, it’s not as though all leisure and recreation businesses are closed."
8157,"As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, attractions like the San Diego zoo are open for operations."
8158,And I highly doubt that all of those folks are simply coming from San Diego county.
8159,"To me anyway, There are a lot of similarities in the behaviors between zoos and amusement parks, so to me, this is one of the biggest discrepancies in the reopening plans."
8160,"Also, I don’t think it’s super uncommon in Southern California for people to cross county lines on a somewhat frequent basis to do you basic things like eat out, shop, or Other similar activities were undoubtedly there are local I can turn it is."
8161,"Realistically, you need to look at the larger “regions” within California."
8162,Southern California is basically one big “region” with a few smaller sub regions within it.
8163,"In general though, they are all pretty connected and there is a lot of travel between all of the different areas within Southern California."
8164,Orange county is kind of situated in the middle of all of that And has a lot of unique experiences because of its centralized location.
8165,"It already gets a lot of travel from other counties as it is, so I’m not sure that what you’re saying here carries a lot of weight."
8166,"&gt; I don’t think speculating “Well those people probably already travel across county lines for all kinds of things so this won’t make a difference” is a surefire analysis, and I think during this pandemic justifying any action with “Well this right here is being done so it won’t make a big difference if we do it here too” is not good."
8167,Two wrongs don't make a right.
8168,"People travel from far and wide to go to amusement parks, they are designed to attract people from all over."
8169,"I cannot say the same for malls, restaurants, bars."
8170,"As I stated in my other paragraph, I’m Not sure you necessarily understand the travel patterns and behaviors within Southern California as a larger region."
8171,It’s not as though these counties act as completely independent areas.
8172,They are fairly connected and this kind of critique does not really cold given what people are already doing in the area.
8173,"Additionally, as I’ve mentioned already, given how Southern California is set up, you certainly could have people traveling across counties for good distances to access things like restaurants or shops."
8174,"Especially when some people have nothing better to do, they may be OK driving a decent amount of time simply to get out of the house."
8175,"&gt; You say Disney is good at enforcing the rules, however I saw a ton of videos of people at Disney without masks yelling about how they have a medical condition that won’t allow them to wear the mask, including that mom daughter combo that livestreamed themselves without masks, talking about how the daughter felt sick and what not which got some media attention a while back."
8176,I would definitely be appreciative of a few links here.
8177,"I’m sure that these kinds of things have happened, but I think the key thing is how Disney responds."
8178,"Just because there are people who throw these fits, I suspect does not mean that they get to stay in the parks."
8179,&gt; I have not personally seen the leaked guidelines you keep referencing so I’m just playing Devil’s Advocate here.
8180,"I do remember Disney had a guideline in other states that said you must wear a mask except while eating, so everyone just walked around with a hotdog in their hand and no masks, but I think they changed that rule after."
8181,See [here](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/02/california-theme-parks-push-back-on-restrictions-in-states-draft-reopening-plan/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tw-ocdisney&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com).
8182,"The article doesn’t explicitly mention all of the guidelines, and excludes the obvious things like masks, social distancing, and reservations."
8183,"This isn’t where I got the information from, but it basically covers what I heard."
8184,Other folks have gotten the guidelines from unions and other trade groups that were discussing things with their members.
8185,"Also, you are correct that early on, Disney allowed you to take your mask off to eat, but they later revised this rule such that you have to be stationary to eat or drink without your mask."
8186,"As you mentioned, some folks were abusing it and would not have their masks on while “enjoying a drink“ for extended periods of time."
8187,"I’m not going to say that this proves that Disney is responsible, but I do think it at least demonstrates some willingness to change their rules in favor of more strict and less convenient actions."
8188,"&gt; I am still of the opinion that until we get everything mostly under control, nothing unessential should be opened."
8189,"LA County is still in purple tier and within 120 miles of the amusement parks, so people should not be allowed to travel there and attend."
8190,"I hate to break it to you, but we’re already passed that point."
8191,"Many nonessential businesses are allowed to operate, and at this point it’s really just theme parks in large gatherings like concerts, theaters, and sporting events."
8192,I think one of the things that really needs to be here is some consistency.
8193,"As I’ve mentioned, I think there are a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies that make it hard to reconcile what is allowed to operate and what is not."
8194,"In particular, I failed to see how the food events that are currently going on in Parks along with the operation of zoos and aquariums do you not at least provide some evidence to the contrary."
8195,"You may disagree with the fact that these places are open, but the reality is that they are."
8196,"Some consistency aunt to be given here and I think if Newsom isn’t careful, a lot of the tears and regulations he’s put in place are going to receive a lot of scrutiny and will end up tearing themselves apart because of these inconsistencies."
8197,They could not afford it ... probably costs more than their monthly wages.

8233,"Its everywhere in France now but, when it was just kicking off, the main vectors were people going to work and spreading around the office and presumably on public transport."
8234,I dont want to go to the office during a pandemic.
8235,Even if I dont catch it or even if I get only a mild dose I am still part of the problem by my physical presence crowding people on transport or wherever.
8236,I was able to work effectively from home but still have to come to the office every other day.
8237,That is how it spread.
8238,I do think about other people and I dont think I should use public transport or be in an office environment.
8239,But that is the way France is being run.
8240,There is not much I can do about it.
8241,But after the elections.
8242,No kidding.
8243,That was annoying me so much.
8244,I have no idea where I indicated anywhere that I don’t know how they worked or which of my statements led you to believe that.
8245,"We always were at about 80% in the MICU, where I worked."
8246,I am arguing with your statement that no one died of Covid due to resource shortages.

8273,You're forgetting that testing capacity has massively increased.
8274,We know the true number of infections now.
8275,100 000 per day now isn't the same as 100 000 per day before summer when only a fraction were tested.
8276,"In reality the true number of infections before summer was much higher and that's why hospitals were overrun, also cause so many older people were being infected."

8286,Social Security is solvent through 2037 and could be extend to 2100 (and beyond) by increasing the maximum tax and means-testing disbursement to the wealthiest.
8287,It's not rocket science to fix this...

8295,"I’m so fed up with people sharing misinformation about COVID, vaccines and face masks."
8296,"This one woman posted this article from Dr Mercola about how face masks are useless against Covid and how vaccines 

Then she says “be informed”  which means cherry pick bogus and scientifically invalid sources that confirm my own sources."
8297,And if you disagree you’re apart of the deep state
8298,Because I don’t believe *all* in person interaction is a huge risk?
8299,European people are no less or more stupid than American people.
8300,"Maybe the only difference is that we (I mean, most of us) don’t have leaders that are encouraging us to be more stupid."
8301,They have prepared by working out logistics.
8302,I think they will be prepared to move quickly.
8303,I can’t imagine anyone trusting any local or state officials with holding  unapproved vaccines and waiting to use them until the FDA approves.

8305,True.

8321,Same here.
8322,Even a cabin somewhere in the mountains sounds pretty nice.
8323,Other than it shows you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about?
8324,We already know outbreaks were seeded by large gatherings like a football match or a conference.
8325,Theme parks are similarly high risk.
8326,Is it possible you have allergies that you are mistaking for colds?
8327,Great explanation of positive predictive value.
8328,This is why this or the NYC antibody data from May would have been much accurate than say the April Santa Clara Study.
8329,Is anyone in control of France?
8330,I thought the Europeans were handling this well.
8331,"Are you afraid of quarantines, travel being disrupted, you being stuck in Padova before borders closed out of sudden, or because of closures and lockdowns making the experience so terrible that there is no point going to Padova anyway?"
8332,Those are good reasons you should consider.
8333,It will depend on the country you are at the moment mostly.
8334,Are you afraid of getting sick and dying?
8335,"First, it is very unlikely you have a much bigger chance of getting infected in the country you are at the moment that Italy, depending on where you are."
8336,"And you won't bring the virus from Padova to wherever you are, there is already plenty there."
8337,That is why border closures and travel bans are ridiculous.
8338,"Second, unless you have happen to be taking a master at the age of 80, nothing will happen to you unless you are unluck to the point of winning a reverse Euromillions lottery."

8341,And this is the kind of thing people are handwaving aside when they just want to say all these precautionary mandates and executive measures are unwarranted because 99+ percent survival rate.
8342,"I don't want to blow this off and end up surviving with permanent damage, and I don't want to blow this off and pass on an illness to other people who might end up surviving with permanent damage."
8343,&gt;Nope.
8344,and you're clearly too stupid to understand the difference between science formally declaring something and science simply having no statement on it because every bit of epidemiological evidence points away from it and it hasn't had a chance to rule it out yet.
8345,So you are saying we should just assume we know what the science is going say insteadnof actually doing the science and seeing the results?
8346,Hypocritical much?
8347,"&gt;it would be like you claiming that until science rules out that water is safe from COVID, you're not going to drink water."
8348,"They did in June, by the way but you would have died of dehydration before then."
8349,Nope.
8350,Put the straw man away and have an honest conversation for once in your ignorant life dude.
8351,Refusing to drink water is in no way comparable to wiping down items that you know have recently been handled by people of unknown health status.
8352,"One of those is guaranteed death, the other is a nearly free precaution that does not cause gaurenteed death."
8353,"If you want to have a conversation, take it seriously and knock off the bullshit."
8354,Stop proving yourself wrong and refusing to admit it.
8355,Stop propping up straw men or comparing obviously incomparable responses.
8356,Unless of course you are so dumb you believe that wiping down a few items is on the same level as intentionally dehydrating yourself to death over a nonspecific threat.
8357,"If that is the case, any further conversation with you is pointless because you don't believe in words having definitions in addition to not believing in math of science."
8358,&gt;I even pegged you as a person who wiped your groceries out of hysteria and you proved me right.
8359,"And yet again, before fomite transmission was understood, there was no reason to not take the precautionary steps."
8360,Why would you insist on behaving intentionally in a dangerous manner when there is no reason not to just behave safely?
8361,"Agreed, RNA would be a game-changer."
8362,Especially since this pandemic is probably a practice run for next one.
8363,Yikes I don't like those numbers.

 Two trials of AZD7442 will enrol over 6,000 adults for the prevention of COVID-19 with additional trials enrolling \~4,000 adults for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections

### US Government to invest ~$486m for development and supply of up to 100,000 doses and can acquire another one million doses

AstraZeneca’s long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, AZD7442, will advance into two Phase III clinical trials in more than 6,000 participants at sites in and outside the US that are due to begin in the next weeks."
8383,The LAABs have been engineered with AstraZeneca’s proprietary half-life extension technology to increase the durability of the therapy for six to 12 months following a single administration.
8384,The combination of two LAABs is also designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
8385,"The Company has received support of around $486m from the US Government for the development and supply of AZD7442 under an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense."
8386,"One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to 12 months, in approximately 5,000 participants."
8387,"The second trial will evaluate post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in approximately 1,100 participants."
8388,"AstraZeneca is planning additional trials to evaluate AZD7442 in approximately 4,000 patients for the treatment of COVID-19."
8389,"AstraZeneca plans to supply up to 100,000 doses starting towards the end of 2020 and the US Government can acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement."
8390,"Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement with the US Government will help accelerate the development of our long-acting antibody combination which has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating COVID-19 infections."
8391,"We will be evaluating the LAAB combination in different settings from prophylaxis, to outpatient treatment to hospitalisation, with a focus on helping the most vulnerable people.”

LAABs mimic natural antibodies and have the potential to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus, as well as to be given as a preventative intervention prior to exposure to the virus."
8392,"A LAAB combination could be complementary to vaccines as a prophylactic agent, e.g."
8393,for people for whom a vaccine may not be appropriate or to provide added protection for high-risk populations.
8394,It could also be used to treat people who have been infected.
8395,"Today’s agreement builds on previous funding of more than $25m from US government agencies BARDA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the discovery and evaluation of the monoclonal antibodies, as well as the Phase I clinical trial started in August 20201 to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy individuals."
8396,"**Financial considerations**  
The agreement is not anticipated to impact the Company's financial guidance for 2020 as the US Government funding is being offset by expenses to progress the clinical trials of AZD7442 as well as manufacturing process and upscaling costs."
8397,"Should the Phase III trials prove successful and AZD7442 become an approved medicine, the Company anticipates providing the medicine at commercial terms during and after the current coronavirus pandemic."
8398,"**AZD7442**  
AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8399,"Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and [licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19.html), the LAABs were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding."
8400,"The half-life extended LAABs should afford six to 12 months of protection from COVID-19.2-5 The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.6

In a recent [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2548-6) publication, the LAABs were shown in pre-clinical experiments to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.7

How inexpensive, at-home, COVID-19 screening tests (results in 15 minutes with a nasal or saliva sample) could be utilized to dramatically slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic (and open up schools etc."
8501,in a faster and safer way).
8502,The research of Harvard epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina and others has shown that COVID 19 test frequency and availability is much more important than test sensitivity (the ability of a test to pick up low levels of virus).
8503,See our previous MedCram videos that have featured Dr. Mina's research about COVID 19 testing and how quickly identifying individuals who are contagious (and who have high levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus) should be the primary focus.
8504,"Kyle Allred, Dr. Seheult, and MedCram have no financial disclosures related to this topic."
8505,We have a keen interest in curbing this pandemic and safely re-opening schools and our economy.

The journal headline is based off of the inference from Figure 1 of the red curve versus the green curve."
8801,"However, with asymptomatic spreading, I would contend that case isolation (CI) and household quarantine (HQ) interventions are undermined, and the more realistic comparison might look more like ""Do Nothing"" (purple curve) versus ""Place Closures (PC)"" (orange curve), which demonstrates an absolutely noticeable benefit for closing schools and public spaces."

8946,I get that.
8947,I just say that from the fact that the whole country is actually doing badly.
8948,Would be interested in seeing if it has any impact on overall deaths.
8949,E.g if you can clear hospital beds faster it still opens up resources for other cases.
8950,"Yes, the magical vaccine that is going to come save us all... unless trump is re-elected."
8951,Then it’ll just be rushed and not taken seriously.

8954,"Chris Christie spends his sixth day in a hospital being treated for COVID-19, current Gov."
8955,"Phil Murphy said Thursday his predecessor is ""the quintessential Jersey fighter.”

&gt;Christie’s exact condition remains unknown and it’s still unclear what course of treatment he’s receiving."
8956,"The 58-year-old hasn’t tweeted since Saturday, and doctors, family, and friends have not made any public announcements about how he’s doing."
8957,We’ll hit 400k eventually in the first few months of 2021.
8958,We’ll have a vaccine by then but it will take some time before it’s widely distributed.
8959,"Well, are mask guidelines the law?"
8960,I'd be pretty pissed if some guidelines came out about sunglasses or transgender hormones and the police took it upon themselves to enforce it at gun point.
8961,Are there LAWS that should be enforced?

8980,"His release from hospital doesn't establish that he's better either - and I suspect that aside from all the experimental treatments he left against medical advice, or that the doctors allowed it because there is a hospital in the WH and because of a combination of VIP syndrome and simping."
8981,I don’t think they can afford shutting down the entire country again.

8994,And anybody who thinks 2021 is going to be any better are delusional and not using common sense.
8995,Yes but people are suffering from quarantine fatigue and as we enter the winter months I suspect seasonal affective disorder making people depressed will contribute to less social distancing.

9070,"His workplace said that it didn't count as exposure because it was only for 10 min, not 15, even though the COVID positive person was not wearing a mask."
9071,My thought is that determining if it's an exposure or not based on my dad's recollection that it was 10 min rather than 15 is not a good idea.
9072,"I mean, 5 minutes is such a short period of time."
9073,"It would be so easy to get the amount of time spent wrong by 5 min, especially when asked days after the fact."
9074,But his workplace insists that he's not exposed and he has to keep coming in.
9075,"My mom and I think he should self-isolate, so we set up the guest room and guest bathroom for him yesterday, and brought him dinner on a tray to eat in the guest room."

9093,What shows do you like?
9094,This is why I think it is reprehensible for Americans to have decided its ok to allow another 200k people to die because they think waiting for a rigged election and a very unlikely inauguration Biden is the only acceptable solution to getting a real response to this pandemic.
9095,The first 211k is on the Trump administration and the rest will be on us and every single last one of those 200k people who die will have been in vain  if Biden does not win.
9096,Even in the unlikely scenario Trump isn't able to take over the country it will take the Biden administration several months to develop a pandemic response so thousands upon thousands more will die all because people are more interested in protecting a Constitution that has failed us every single step of the way since Trump took office than actually protecting their own people.
9097,"If you fall out a window and have covid, does that count as a covid death"
9098,Really depends on the age distribution.

9113,It’s a gray area with a sliding scale.

9148,"We do free pickup at Walmart, and have done instacart at Aldi once."
9149,"Lack of enforcement of mask rules drives me as a customer away, but I guess in their math they think they will make more money catering to Trumpanzees."
9150,We were actually on the right track but opened phase one and phase 2 too soon.
9151,If we had bumped the staggered openings by 4 weeks we would be in substantially better shape.
9152,"It's easy to say that now, but the data at the time of the opening were all trending down and looking great."
9153,The issue is that the lag in reporting test results and especially deaths allowed for decisions to be made on insufficient data.
9154,What’s up with all these china shills whatabouting to the US?
9155,As if the usual suspects would suddenly trust experts.
9156,"AFAIR only 25% of positives show up later in positive serology, but I might be wrong."

9160,And A?

9162,Not sure why this is so negative.
9163,Reducing a person's suffering and reducing the demand on health care through a shortened recovery (10 vs 15 days) is a good thing.

9177,Right.
9178,They keep complaining about all the measures that people are attempting to take to make up for the idiots acting like nothing is going on.
9179,They wouldn't have anything to complain about if they would just cooperate for a short period of time to help tone things down.
9180,They would get their economy back faster too
9181,That's a good way to do it.
9182,"It's way beyond the skill set of the average lab, however, and it carries a lot of risks of its own in terms of data security and backups."
9183,"Contemplating the risks of the two approaches, I think it's arguably safer and more productive to use Excel for most small database jobs that require a lot of data manipulation and querying."
9184,Both courses of action have their downsides.
9185,1k a day is not much considering the population density
9186,If we actually held people accountable for putting others in danger we could have saved most of the 211k who have died.

9198,"This is because many people in those areas regularly travel back and forth from the urban areas, they are exposed, and bring it back."
9199,They also know people who live in the urban area.
9200,"The vast majority of rural areas, including where I grew up in KY, do not have the same exposure or know the same number of people in urban areas."
9201,"You seem awfully defensive, but the reality is that you did not grow up in a truly rural area if it is that close to Cincinnati."
9202,"Maybe people acted country and had country values, but if you are that close to all the benefits of urban areas, including jobs and hospitals, then they were in a very different position than people who were in truly rural areas."
9203,"I grew up in an area in KY that was about 125 miles from the nearest large city, which was Louisville."

9240,If they don’t own them they can’t move them.
9241,They can add tariffs on goods from China or try to embargo but each has a problem.
9242,Higher costs just get pushed onto consumers and China doesn’t get hurt.
9243,Embargo won’t work because China is the worlds biggest buyer of world debt.
9244,When countries threaten at that level China threatens to call back its trillions of debt its owed from several countries.
9245,Also China builds many of its own factories and then companies pay them to build stuff.
9246,"Many companies , like close to 70%, don’t own the factories they have their stuff built in."
9247,Many regions that people propose to move chinas manufacturing from either don’t have the infrastructure to support the level of export needed or are unwilling to build factories because no one in that country has the money to build the factories.
9248,It’s hard for a company to say I’m going to pull out of China and move to India or wherever if there are no factories there that already make their goods and have extra bandwidth to take on additional work.
9249,It took more than 20 years for China to become this kind of manufacturing power house.

9260,"The USSR ran a dictatorial command economy where the rich oligarchy had everything and regular people had nothing, as far from communism as you can get."
9261,I'd argue a communist state has never existed for an extended period of time.

- Military personnel and RKI scientists available for hotspot counties to trace contacts and decide on countermeasures, starting at 35/100k/week."
9270,"- More masking and limiting parties by law at 50/100k/week, 10 days trial period, then further restrictions."
9271,"- No Schutzhaft for high-risk groups, but protection as much as possible."
9272,New rapid tests prioritized for care homes and hospitals.
9273,"That was happening here(the US), too."
9274,"Dead bodies were being tested as a means of deciding if staff had been exosed to the virus, not by default."
9275,This reminds me that I need to look into what eventually happened to the backlog of suspected covid deaths in my area.
9276,I'm not sure if they were ever added to the numbers.

9294,From what I’ve seen people in UK are not social distancing and wearing masks.
9295,Seen countless videos of packed pubs and nightclubs.
9296,Also travel is not as restricted.
9297,So go to Ibiza with thousands of people and bring home the virus.
9298,Can’t blame everything on schools.
9299,hooray for PUTIN.
9300,"From what I remember Australia and the US only wanted to investigate China as the origin of the virus, excluding every other country as possibility and that lead to the spat between China and Australia."
9301,China agreed once all countries were part of the investigation into the possible origin of the virus.
9302,What?!
9303,Are you implying that US media outlets lie and are complicit in US efforts to manufacture consent??
9304,Russia bad.
9305,MSNBC good.

9310,Those madlads posting real news
9311,COVID affects everyone differently.
9312,And trump has access to the finest medical treatment in the world.
9313,It was statistically likely that he would recover from this.
9314,"Also, life is just unfair sometimes."
9315,So many wonderful people have died from the virus.
9316,Yet someone dangerous and heartless like trump recovers.
9317,I wish there was an explanation too.
9318,Trump seems invincible.
9319,"He’s cheated his way through life, successfully."
9320,"He is old, has a poor diet and lifestyle (drug use) and the worlds most stressful job yet his heart is still pumping."
9321,I have a feeling this dude will live to 100.
9322,I don’t really get why people think it’s fake.
9323,"Like yeah, they’re capable of that, they lie all the time."
9324,But only for political advantage.
9325,This COVID diagnosis so far has only hurt Trumps campaign.
9326,"Unless there is some long term con here, like trumps already decided he’s going to resign before the election, and he wants to use COVID as an excuse to look like he’s heroically stepping down after battling a horrible infection."
9327,But I don’t buy that just yet.
9328,Place your bets!
9329,You’re a nut job lmao.
9330,New world order.
9331,"Yeah most foreign tourists will just go to Sydney and maybe a few other places like the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru or Melbourne."
9332,Aussies have all “been there done that” so exploring the rest of Australia makes sense.
9333,"He always had a greater chance of not having a major issue with the virus, even at his age."
9334,Probably 1/4 chance of being seriously ill and half of that of dying.
9335,Of course he could still deteriorate but it's more likely nothing will happen in the next week and he'll think he has the greatest immune system and that the virus is no big deal.
9336,i want no part of this fight
9337,Blaphemy!
9338,It should be 2020-10-08 20:00:00.0000

9340,"I mean, it does."
9341,I'm against murder but I don't mind the victim's corpse being autopsied and studied to advance Forensics or Pathology.
9342,You can be against abortion but still want the most good to come out of the act if it has already happened.
9343,I want my money back.

9345,I'm sorry dude.
9346,That sucks for you and your dad.
9347,"You know we are gonna get more surprise community outbreaks over the next few months, it's inevitable."
9348,"We might escape lockdowns, but I can't see us avoiding Level 2 again at *some* point in the next 6 months."
9349,So bragging about how we have no community spread just sounds a bit cocky to me.
9350,"We have won 2 battles, but the War is still raging out there..."
9351,I’m betting on late October the 1st vaccine wil be approved and early to mid November the 1st vaccine will start being administered.
9352,"Wait, was there another mask mandate?"
9353,I can't find anything on one after Douchey ended it in July.
9354,You are so correct.
9355,Millions of Americans have had six months without work or school due to the virus.
9356,Please tell us how you turned your life around.
9357,"I am in the exact situation that you were in before: a young man who lost everything because of lockdowns, and have only gaming (Elder Scrolls Online/Call of Duty/MMOs) to sustain me."
9358,Its the same in the UK with the Tory party.
9359,"My dad, who is a musician, has always voted tory."
9360,But he got a shock when the chancellor of the exchequer said everyone in the arts should re-train and get a new job.
9361,He was surprised when the scum he votes for stabbed him in the back.
9362,Yep only few parts of Australia get snow and there’s no massive amounts of suburbs there where people would be shoveling on a regular basis.
9363,There’s some houses but not enough to really cause a huge effect on a national scale.
9364,What evidence do you have for that?
9365,"Does working, getting educated or wanting to see the people closest to you for the sake of your own sanity class as “unsafe behaviour” for you?"
9366,The only people responsible for intense restrictions are the governments who impose them and the people supporting them.
9367,"😱

""No we must go on with our lives while protecting the vulnerable!"""
9368,Instead we just went on with our lives and then forgot that young people work side by side with the vulnerable every single day.
9369,The only way to protect them is to not spread the disease in the first place.
9370,Imagine that.
9371,"no, the U.S. has a much higher death rate per capita."
9372,And did his makeup extra heavy because he WAS looking pale the other day
9373,There *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.
9374,Hopefully Biden/Harris will make it happen.
9375,"In many ways this doesn’t go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly."
9376,By no fault of their own.
9377,It just happens.
9378,For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly.
9379,They can spread out into the communities and do this work.
9380,"As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified."
9381,This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump.
9382,These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.
9383,Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks — something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.
9384,"As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are “enemies” of this progress."
9385,"Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways."
9386,"But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification."
9387,"To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created."
9388,The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work.
9389,These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such.
9390,This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population.
9391,"Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress."
9392,"Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society — for the good of society, as well as for their own good."
9393,This will be dealt with humanely and fairly.
9394,Not at all like Nazis.
9395,These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being.
9396,All perfectly humane and fair.
9397,These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world.
9398,Once re-educated they can be returned to society.
9399,Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly.
9400,But this will be for their own benefit.
9401,"Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed."
9402,"This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole."
9403,Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism.
9404,This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.
9405,"So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm."
9406,Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash.
9407,"A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate."
9408,"With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist."
9409,So they can probably be done away with first.
9410,People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society.
9411,"But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good."
9412,Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.
9413,Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks.
9414,Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society.
9415,"However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society."
9416,There are other measures that will have to be taken vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie who have brought so much pain unto the country.
9417,But that can be tackled later.
9418,**The important thing is that it should 100% be against the fucking law to leave your house without wearing a mask.
9419,"**

Frankly they should require wearing them even when you are home and even when you’re alone."
9420,But for now it should simply be strictly outlawed in public.
9421,Anybody caught flaunting this very important rule will have to be dealt with very harshly.
9422,Penalties are not enough.
9423,"Imprisonment, of an indefinite period (at least a year, and up to five or even ten years) for first time offenders."
9424,"No exceptions, no appeals."
9425,Second-time offenders are sent to top secret camps permanently.
9426,These camps will be for degenerates and other repeat violators of these laws.
9427,For security reasons they will have to be off limits to all but a small group of security professionals with special clearance.
9428,Red Cross and other international organizations will not be allowed anywhere near their premises.
9429,This to make sure such harmful individuals are kept out of sight and out of mind.
9430,"It is only fair, correct, and proper that such measures are taken against people who willfully go out in public without masks."
9431,Look up that data again.
9432,It shows that for the majority of infections we *don’t know* where or how they happened.
9433,"Only of the known traces, the majority is infections at home and work."
9434,The data is incomplete.
9435,"“Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.” — **George Carlin** (the great)"
9436,Was just talking to a person that said they know the neighbor of the first person in town to die of covid.
9437,Said the neighbor is early 30s and got very sick.
9438,"Said she thought it was exaggerated at first, but not now."
9439,All this is easy to investigate.
9440,"I wasn't commenting on the article, I'm just speaking from experience."

9455,&gt; Are we certain a blanket global ban against ridiculous shit like covid denial and anti-mask won't actually be effective?
9456,"It’s the responsibility of public health agencies to adequately explain and make accessible information, data and evidence that supports their calls to action."
9457,It is not the responsibility of the public to just accept what they say and in fact would be incredibly irresponsible to do so.
9458,&gt; Why not demonize people who choose not to use logic and science?
9459,There isn’t enough data accessible by the public.
9460,"For example, can *you* even prove covid is real without deferring to another persons interpretation of the data or evidence?"
9461,"&gt; What is the worst that can happen

It damages the public’s trust in public health agencies and makes the necessary trust and cooperation between the public and the government, healthcare and public health impossible."

9480,IDK if he has any reliable data on reinfections.
9481,One of Israel's health insurance providers claims to have seen around 30 cases of people testing positive again.
9482,"If exposure was fully random, and if there was 90% long-term immunity, they should have had only about 5 by now."
9483,"Like with every virus disease, there are flare-ups in chronic cases, some rare false-positives, many false-negatives, and PCR tests sometimes detect a small infection that will be defeated by the immune system."
9484,"But most importantly, exposure is not random."
9485,"I'd guess that the first-generation muscle-injected RNA vaccines are protecting most people from severe disease, but don't prevent infectiousness."
9486,"Perhaps they'll reduce aerosol infections in the second phase of the disease, but it does not look like they will do anything against fomite transmission, as the virus still replicated in animals' noses and throats."

9583,SARS was a blip.
9584,It came and it went away.
9585,"Idk where this false narrative came from, but asians dont care about SARS that ceased to exist or 'flu season' 

They wear them because of their toxic pollution."
9586,Why wasn't Trump given Chloroquine and Demon Semen?
9587,Did he already have adequate amounts in him?
9588,"If so, how did he catch Covid-19?"
9589,"Sometimes, no amount of money can save you, but you're sure to have a much, much better chance of surviving with money."

9600,The false positive rate of the test his group used.
9601,To a lot of people America is the mighty juggernaut that everyone envies.
9602,Take a scary virus and pair it with the government's inept response you've got to face not only your own mortality but the shattered illusion that America can fail.

9613,Thanks for the kindness.
9614,This will be the first time in my life I won't spend Christmas with my entire immediate and extended family.
9615,"For other things until now we had tried outdoor gatherings at first, but no one respected social distancing even when constantly reminded so that's no longer an option."
9616,"I actually worked at the County Clerks Office in the Voters Registration/VBM (Vote by Mail)
So I know a bit about the difficulties faced here."
9617,We started wearing masks immediately and went skeleton crew right after the primary in March.
9618,I chose to take COVID leave then and an still on it because the work itself doesn't allow for proper social distancing.
9619,I just don't see how it's possible to hand people paper or receive paper from 6' away.
9620,"In my county, which is predominantly Republican, the mask mandate is largely ignored."
9621,"In germany we never had problems in schools, but i heard discos were opened in Italy?"
9622,A supersuperspreader rally event.
9623,The reason I think people would respond to a mailer is that they're concerned about covid and they are being offered a free and low effort way to see if they have anti-bodies.
9624,The researchers are offering something people want.
9625,But I'd imagine their is some phone contact too.
9626,And I've recruited people by phone for research that required an in person visit and I had a very high success rate.
9627,"They weren't random people out of the phone book and I was probably an above average recruiter, but participating in research is kind of interesting."

9645,Yes.
9646,Wishing anyone dead means...
9647,I agree we get pretty good overall mortality numbers...eventually.
9648,"The frustrating thing in the ""now"" is that those numbers are anywhere between ""challenging"" to ""non-existent"" in the short term."
9649,:(
9650,Except for East Asians....
9651,"You can´t blame bars and restaurants, they were opened since May."

9665,Sturgis Rally didn't do a damn thing.
9666,People claimed thousands are going to get COVID.
9667,Thousands.
9668,"Only ONE death, ONE could they even tenuously link to the Rally and the dumbass had health problems *before* he went."
9669,"So drop the blaming the Rally bullshit and look at the locations where they people live for your ""spread""."
9670,This is literally true if you have *any* route of potential transmission between households.
9671,Hopefully that won't be true for long.. come on technology.

9673,Time to hit the road!
9674,"The United States is a corporate oligarchy, not a democracy."

9677,Your anecdotes sound like everyone I know.
9678,It’s so draining.
9679,"My favorite is when they shout, “we don’t have it!” based purely on how they feel at that given moment."
9680,It’s like they truly can’t understand the concept of asymptomatic transmission.
9681,They only have empathy for their own.
9682,"People on reddit were cheering like crazy when it was only Wuhan affected (which feels like ten years ago despite being only ten months ago) and were already jerking themselves off over the supposed upcoming economic collapse of China, which didn't happen as we have seen."
9683,"ITT: everyone dismissing the article without engaging with any of the evidence in it, preferring instead to assume their gut is right, or examples in other countries definitively override the actual spread from US schools."
9684,I didn't down vote you....
9685,I guess the issue I have with 120 miles is it feels pretty arbitrary.
9686,"Whereas all of California has mask mandates, so presumably we will be more likely to follow the rules."
9687,I’m not sure how Disney would enforce any geography rule though- what’s stopping someone from staying at a local air B&amp;B and putting that as their address?
9688,"You would have to mail people their tickets to ensure they actually live there, which could be problematic given the current state of our postal service."
9689,That might have been disneys issue as much as the requirements themselves- that they would be enforcing something they have no framework for.
9690,There were actually three different scenarios which are still published in the FHM website [https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/publicerat-material/publikationsarkiv/s/scenarier--tre-smittspridningsscenarier-inom-regeringsuppdraget-plan-infor-eventuella-nya-utbrott-av-covid-19/](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/publicerat-material/publikationsarkiv/s/scenarier--tre-smittspridningsscenarier-inom-regeringsuppdraget-plan-infor-eventuella-nya-utbrott-av-covid-19/) that make projections for the development from September 2020 to September 2021.
9691,Scenario 0 was basically the original infection wave drops and doesn't repeat.
9692,"Scenario 1 is :  ""uneven distribution, illustrates a process with a relatively strong peak early autumn followed by a rapid decline and period of less dispersal before the spread increases again after New Year and generates a new peak."
9693,"The scenario shows one possible course in a situation where the infectivity increases rapidly due to people, for example, socialize more frequently, in new constellations and in larger ones groups."
9694,"In the scenario, it is assumed that the infectivity quickly decreases again when people become aware of the outbreak and follow recommendations on distancing."
9695,"After a couple months, there is a similar rapid increase and decrease."
9696,"How big the peaks will be  varies by region, depending on the proportion that is immune, susceptible and contagious when the increase occurs."
9697,"The values of infectivity used for each region, scenario and day are presented in separate appendices together with output data."""
9698,"Scenario 2 is: ""In Scenario 2, evenly distributed, we assume that infectivity increases gradually and persistently in all regions."
9699,"This results in eruptions that last longer and which in most regions become flattened without a distinct peak."""
9700,- a small peak in autumn followed by constant but gradual increase everywhere.
9701,O-H......
9702,The thing is the people pushing hydroxychloroquine are not moved by scientific evidence
9703,2021: any color any day
9704,The problem is how safe is to share a room with other 20 persons for 5 hours everyday with a surgical mask?
9705,I don think it's so safe.
9706,The same applies to workplaces.
9707,Good thing we are nearing flu season.
9708,All the idiots who claim the flu kills more than covid19 will have no excuse to not wear a mask.
9709,See Neil Postman's terrific book The End of Education.

9716,"Even in the U.S., look at Maine/Vermont."
9717,Testing is why my district won’t open.
9718,"CA guidelines state that in the red tier, 50% of teachers need to be tested regularly."
9719,It would close my district millions.
9720,"WFH has been terrible in a rural area where I live, after the first couple weeks so just went back to the office."
9721,Satellite internet is pretty non functional in that regard.
9722,"There are two lags, first it takes time when younger population infects older one and second many critically ill covid patients die after more 14 days, some really fight for a long time."
9723,"Economies may collapse and livelihoods shattered, but countless lives will be saved."
9724,"Honestly, the flu shot is nice I guess, but it doesnt work that well."
9725,"My family gets one because of dads copd, but we all still end up with the flu anyway."
9726,"I had a horrible reaction to it the first time, so I only ever got the one, but I got the flu shortly after anyway lol."
9727,"It's only like 20 or 30 percent effective, I'm not sure on the actual numbers, im regurgitating numbers I read someone else say so no need to quote me lol, I think it's actually much lower then that, but if it helps at should absolutely be doing it."
9728,"I actually thought this year would be amazing for the flu, everyone wearing masks and self isolating and social distancing."
9729,"Honestly, if we all stayed in isolation for a month, wouldnt the virus die off and stop spreading in the first place?"
9730,"I figured that there was a small chance that we would accidentally get rid of the flu this year, and we may have, if people actually followed the rules."
9731,Must of been that idiot I saw at Wally World not wearing a mask and sneezing everywhere.
9732,I will storm the parliament with a million other of my fellow citizenry and throw you out :)
9733,Vaccine
9734,Can you give me a reason why people who would answer an ad to see if you had covid and gave a 100-question survey and then sent in blood were not more likely to be people who thought that they may have been sick or exposed to the virus?
9735,Yeah the title was edited.
9736,So much for that caccine
9737,is seasonality based on cultural changes ?
9738,(staying indoor) or climate based (colder -&gt; immune system weak) or both ?
9739,Nope.
9740,Just a lifetime of insecurity and too much time on my hands.
9741,The coronavirus spreads in some kind of flu-like way?
9742,"I'd like to live in a country which gives a fuck about its people's lives and makes every effort to save them from a novel, infectious disease."
9743,"Unfortunately I live in a flawed ""democracy"" where people are free to spread novel pathogens and are free to cause deaths and suffering in the name of elusive rights."
9744,"Sad, isn't it?"
9745,So do I
9746,You would only need the island until late 2021
9747,Snitching never has a positive connotation.
9748,Dont edit titles.
9749,It’s a cardinal rule of the subreddit and it is misleading to this articles content.
9750,"&gt;Laboratory tests of surgical and N95 masks by researchers at the University of California, Davis, show that they do cut down the amount of aerosolized particles emitted during breathing, talking and coughing."
9751,"Tests of homemade cloth face coverings, however, show that the fabric itself releases a large amount of fibers into the air, underscoring the importance of washing them."
9752,The work is published today (Sept. 24) in Scientific Reports.
9753,They opened discos rly?
9754,"In germany most of infections came from wedding parties, discos in closed rooms is really bad idea."

9783,You have zero proof of that.
9784,It is a speculation.
9785,You cannot quantify exactly how many people are crossing county lines for leisure because it is not being tracked.
9786,"Opening a theme park will very obviously draw in people from all over, unlike a restaurant, bar, movie theater, etc which exist in almost every community."
9787,"Your response just regurgitates the same point over and over that people are crossing county lines constantly for all kinds of things, leisure being a major reason among them."
9788,Nobody that I know in Los Angeles is currently travelling across county lines for leisure.
9789,"Everyone I know is keeping to their small circle of family and close friends, work, and grocery store."
9790,"Contrary to what you believe, the majority of people are taking this very seriously right now, and still mostly keeping to their home/communities, outside of work."
9791,"Again, I think that outdoor activities with strict mask enforcement should be allowed to some extent, with masks strictly enforced, but another question is does the state have the resources to ensure that the theme parks are continuously enforcing this rule?"
9792,"There are major inconsistencies with the reopenings, I think indoor malls recently got the ok to reopen at 25% capacity or something which makes little to no sense to me, but I see good reasons as to why theme parks should not be open right now without contrasting it to other things that have been allowed to open that are similar or worse in transmissibility."

9813,You said that the vaccine is fail.
9814,A vaccine can be deemed a failure if it is established that it doesn't offer protection against the disease.
9815,"Until phase 3 of the trials is completed one can't draw conclusions about the efficacy one way or another So, once again, what gift of foresight gives you the ability to determine if it's a failure or not before the trials are completed?."
9816,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But russia claimed they were the first to have a vaccine 

First to *register*."
9817,"&gt;it wasn't mass produced 

I don't remember reading any officials or researchers claiming that it will be mass-produced and widely distributed by October."
9818,"So, how does the current situation contradicts the vaccine having a *limited use authorization*?"
9819,"By the way, CanSino's vaccine is authorized by Chinese military for emergency use and both of Sinopharm's vaccines have emergency authorization in UAE (can be given to healthcare workers)."

9848,/s
9849,Pshaw.
9850,"This is a hoax that will magically disappear on Wednesday, November 9."
9851,It’s not about the mandates but how serious the populous and enforcement agents enact it.
9852,And the more serious you make the mandates as well as possible repercussions you might face for breaking those rules then the more effective they become.
9853,"For example, Tennessee has more COVID cases than New York State despite NYC on its own having a higher population than the whole state of Tennessee."
9854,Differences are readily transparent between the two states.
9855,More effective masks protocol and a leader who is taking it seriously and trying to keep numbers down.
9856,"Masks are simply a part, a very important part that every individual can fully control on their own, of the preventative measures but there are others that also have to take effect in order for the country and world to get past this."
9857,The state has to do their part as well by making sure that rules put in place actually get followed.
9858,"As an example, NYC has pulled liquor licenses from businesses caught going against the rules."
9859,Also other countries have been doing that and they’re the ones who have been effective.
9860,Singapore can jail people for not social distancing and have revoked work visas of people caught not obeying rules.
9861,They’re probably the most Western and richest country in Asia.
9862,"Here’s a [list](https://www.8days.sg/seeanddo/thingstodo/who-s-been-charged-for-breaking-covid-19-laws-in-singapore-the-12891072) of what people have been fined, penalized and done to them."
9863,That's the situation in every latín american country almost.
9864,"Long lockdown fucks your economy, but fucking your economy here means you might not have anything to eat at the end of the day."
9865,"Also, goverments are extremely corrupt and they won't care about that."

9867,"I know this will get downvoted a lot, but seeing how the pandemic is evolving in Latin American, Brazil might end up being right in their approach for THIS context."

9871,Science teaches us it’s OK to change our opinions as new data becomes available.
9872,I cannot fathom how people can ignore the facts when it doesn’t conform to their worldview.

9879,You realize recommendations and science change yeah?
9880,That’s literally how science works.
9881,This was a recommendation in conjunction with quarantine to allow ppe to be available to workers needing them.
9882,Then we realized more about its travel and how it works and it became clear and quickly that we should all wear masks because Americans sure as shit weren’t going to stay indoors.

10056,What's the fatality rate W/1.1 million deaths @ 770 million cases?
10057,I see what you're saying.
10058,"I'm just wondering, how much compliance is needed?"
10059,"Compliance will never be perfect, and most people don't wear masks inside their homes even if they live with a lot of people."
10060,"Transmission will always occur in that setting, even if you threw people who didn't use masks in public into jail."
10061,How much compliance do you need to demonstrate significant effects on the course of a region/county/state/country's case curve?Because in this post the title asserts that AZ's cases decreased after masks were mandated.
10062,How much compliance do you really think was going on in Arizona?
10063,"So if masks were the cause of this correlation, can we prove it in other states or countries by observing the same thing?"
10064,"(to the rest of the world, each state is more comparable to a country anyway)  Can we demonstrate material difference in places that don't have mandates vs. those that do (and have high compliance)?"
10065,Do masks have an impact on hospitalizations in an area as well?
10066,How do we assess this degree of compliance?
10067,Whether a mask mandate was implemented or not?
10068,"Well clearly we've established that people often times flout mandates even if there are fines attached to not abiding by them, and a lot of law enforcement doesn't even enforce stuff like state mandates in the USA at least."
10069,"And clearly it's happening in other parts of the world as well, considering what you linked and quoted about Spain and France earlier."
10070,"&gt;If [redacted cuz mods] loses, I’m pretty sure that there will be a turn on anti-maskers and you’ll see the penalties increase to jail time."
10071,"Once again this ignores the fact that non-compliance and questionable guidelines are a prevalent thing in other countries, unless you think the above event taking place would spur other countries into jailing those who do not comply."
10072,34 at last count ?
10073,Not at all.
10074,It is a grave mistake to be looking at this as a binary question.
10075,That is not how immunity works.
10076,People generate antibodies and fight off the infection.
10077,"While those antibodies are still there, they do have some immunity."
10078,"When those antibodies disappear, and it is gradual process, they lose that immunity."
10079,"The important question isn't whether there is immunity after 4 months, the important question is whether there is immunity many years into the future."
10080,And all the available evidence.
10081,"points unequivocally in the direction of immunity not lasting much more than a year, two at most."
10082,"Which is functionally equivalent to no immunity, because we do not plan on the world ending 12 months from now, do we, thus me and everyone else gravely concerned about this talking about ""no lasting immunity""."
10083,"But that is not the same as ""no immunity at all even a week after recovery""

Then the question is why immunity does not last on the molecular level, which has enormous implications for the prospects of the various vaccines in development."
10084,There are lots of scenarios -- the optimistic one is that vaccines will be able to do better than a natural infection.
10085,But they may also not be able to do that.
10086,&gt;But the current Covid death count does include tons of deaths where existing conditions were exacerbated by Covid.
10087,"The vast majority of death certificates for Covid had major preexisting conditions, [...]

This is also true of the flu."
10088,"In fact, just like COVID-19, the vast majority of flu-related deaths are not deaths in which the flu is considered the primary cause of death."
10089,Except we already have over 10K verified deaths already where COVID has been deemed the primary cause with no comorbidities by physicians whereas for the flu that number is much closer to 0.
10090,You know this to be true based on your own life experience - people who die from the flu only very very rarely die from *just the flu.
10091,*  There are *almost always* comorbidities involved in flu-related deaths.
10092,&gt;and were counted as Covid deaths in a way that flu has never been.
10093,No.
10094,"Doctors make their best judgment in both cases and if they, in their best medical judgment, consider influenza as one of the causes of a death, then they write it as a cause of death."
10095,Likewise with COVID.
10096,Why would you think we all of a sudden started counting deaths due to viral illnesses differently?
10097,&gt;Over half the Covid deaths were in nursing facilities for example.
10098,"Again, what do you think that figure is for Influenza?"
10099,I guarantee it’s a higher percentage than COVID-19.
10100,"&gt;The two systems are not comparable, Covid testing is constant while flu is not."
10101,They are most certainly comparable.
10102,"I don’t even know how you could say they aren’t, lol."
10103,"Flu is “constant,” as well, whatever you mean by that."
10104,Doctors are constantly checking for both.
10105,"Not as many flu tests are being administered compared to covid tests, but when it comes to deaths, yes they are about the same in term of “constancy,” whatever you mean by that, particularly because the two share symptoms."
10106,Testing for the flu lets you (somewhat) rule out COVID if you get a positive result.
10107,"&gt;There is a central database for Covid used by all states, while the flu system is infrequently used."
10108,"This is false, why would you think the flu system is infrequently used, or that it doesn’t cover all of the states?"
10109,It gets data every week just like the COVID system does.
10110,"&gt;The flu reporting can take years, Covid takes days."
10111,Etc.
10112,"No, the flu *estimation* can take years because it is a *yearly* statistic that depends on, as I said before in a previous comment, a lot of other data."
10113,The flu reporting takes around the same time as COVID.
10114,&gt;It is just as easy to make the case that flu is vastly under estimated as an exacerbating cause of death (where do all those extra heart attacks come from in the winter?)
10115,than it is that flu is over estimated.
10116,"It really, really, really isn’t."
10117,"&gt;You seem intent on making the flu into something minimal, despite long established CDC reporting, so Covid can seem more major."
10118,"I’m not sure this is a good use of stats or a valid argument

And I’m really not intent on it."
10119,"I’d say the opposite is true, that you’re intent on making COVID into just another flu strain, since the word from public health officials considers this virus to be much more deadly than the flu, and yet you’re here arguing differently."
10120,"I went to the cdc website, I did some *BASIC ASS MATH,* and I made a graph."
10121,I read through 500 comments on that graph and listened to criticism and I educated myself more.
10122,I am just going with what the facts here tell me.
10123,I sincerely doubt it.
10124,Though maybe they just have a form filled out except for the date so the White House gets experimental drugs.
10125,&gt; There needs to be a federal law mandating masks right fucking now.
10126,Hopefully Biden/Harris will make it happen.
10127,I was thinking about this earlier; it's wishful thinking my friend.
10128,"I'm not sure what authority the Feds have to issue such an order, and even if they did, it's basically unenforceable."
10129,"If the Dems control Congress and the Presidency they might be able to get states to issue mask orders in exchange for Federal funding, similar to the drinking age and highway funding."
10130,"At a state level it's much more enforceable, but only if local law enforcement wants to cooperate."
10131,"Where I'm at in California, for example, law enforcement has said they pretty much won't enforce mask ordinances."
10132,"But I'm still alive, so who cares!"
10133,No mask!
10134,/s
10135,Pulled up to a store where they have an small indoor gym/CrossFit training.
10136,Packed and no one is wearing a mask.
10137,It's easy to eliminate the virus if you don't have many cases to begin with.
10138,That is bullshit censorship and ridiculous.
10139,Please elaborate on this decision.
10140,Mask mandate hasn't done shit for my town in Wisconsin.
10141,More than 50% of my customers at my has station do not wear them.
10142,I even had a cop come in and explicitly state that they would not enforce it.
10143,Our county is among the fastest rising in the state and our state is among the fastest rising in the country.
10144,A mandate with no enforcement is pretty useless.
10145,We've had the mandate since August and we've been trending increasingly upwards the entire time because no one puts one on anyways.
10146,Muscle is OK.
10147,"It is about the extra fat that causes metabolic syndrome (the same mechanism that causes hypertension, type-2 diabetes, fatty liver, high cholesterol, etc)."
10148,It causes low grade inflammation that weakens the immune system and the virus can set it on fire.
10149,"If you have no signs of metabolic syndrome, you are fine and exercise helps a lot with it."
10150,Admitting that you were wrong and taking the responsibility that comes with it is rare.
10151,Please delete your comment with misinformation.
10152,You are helping 'covid is a hoax'ers when you repeat bad and misleading information.
10153,Close to Rita Ranch/Vail.
10154,The only time I've seen people avoiding mask use is night time at Wal-Mart.
10155,PCR-tests are unreliable.
10156,They [pick up dead virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54000629) and [are positive when they pick up barely any virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html).
10157,They are more a measure of herd immunity levels than anything else.
10158,Nice
10159,What is the record for most per capita cases in a day for any country?

10360,"I've been out in the Rancho Cordova area a few times over the summer and it's like a different world from the Bay, barely any masks anywhere I went whereas here it's still pretty much universal in stores and businesses...even going to the gas pump you'll see people wearing them and that definitely isn't what I saw out there."

10362,"Like, at all."
10363,"You can't just take the total landmass of a country, compare it to the population size and call it a day, that's not how it works."
10364,"Most russians live in the ""small"" european part of the country where population density can be really high, while the rest of russia is basically empty."
10365,"I mean just take one look at the size of their cities, Moscow has a population of 12.5 million with a higher population density than most big US cities, the moscow metropolitan area clocks in at a whopping 20 million inhabitants and St Petersburg has 5 million."
10366,"That's way bigger and in part more densely populated than the biggest american cities and Moscow is arguably the biggest city in europe, so why on earth would you think it'd be easy to contain a virus in Russia?"

10376,"You are correct, though the only reason I pointed this out was simply because many folks who are demanding proof won’t except the US reopenings and (for understandable reasons) Don’t trust the contact tracing here."
10377,"That being said, the problem is that you would think that of the thousands and thousands of people that visited parks over the summer across the globe, at least one case would have led to some kind of large outbreak."
10378,"Even with the good detection methods of some of these other countries, you would still think a few would slip through the cracks and then ignite these large outbreaks."
10379,The problem I have is that no such data on that kind of event exists.
10380,"I can buy into the concerns about traveling and such, but if your main contention is that amusement parks on their own cause massive outbreaks, I think the evidence there is kind of lacking, regardless of the conditions."
10381,You should also be aware that amusement parks are still open in Europe even as the numbers climb.
10382,"To my knowledge, There hasn’t been any real evidence that the parks themselves cause any kind of outbreaks."

10399,And then school started in September.

Hospitalizations and death always lag behind new cases.. but I think we're also seeing younger people infected who don't always require hospital care."

10484,Plus the Lower Mainland is seeing cases fall.
10485,That the most densely populated metropolitan area in Canada.
10486,With very high transit use.
10487,"&gt;Stop stating the rest of Canada does not matter

&gt;Nobody said that, but playing the martyr card work fine I suppose?"
10488,That's basically what this headline implies.
10489,"""Canadians encouraged to stay home as second wave of Covid-19 worsens"" except BC is seeing cases decline and has been for a month."
10490,My company from what I know has been doing business as usual with just a few cases of people taking advantage.
10491,"Generally speaking, people have been happiest doing a mix of both and I am a lot happier."
10492,For my job I sometimes have a lot of downtime or periods of time where no work comes in at all.
10493,During those times it's great to be at home and have things like video games at your disposal (I never do anything I can't **immediately** pause if my email goes off however).
10494,"And I feel like my productivity sometimes dips but sometimes increases, overall balancing while in the office."
10495,"For others at my job, a metric fuck ton of us have long commutes."
10496,Almost everyone I speak to at my place has an hour long commute or more.
10497,So the increase of sleep and no more taxxing high way + inner city traffic I think has helped a majority of us.
10498,Colleges definitely are.
10499,Their vaccine hella trash?

10502,I’m also concerned about his lung capacity.
10503,it's called second wave &amp; get ready US.please send us Antony Fauci (he's useless to you)
10504,The reason that the flu vaccine is only that effective is because it has multiple strains and each of those strains has to be targeted with the specific sub-strain that is expected to be in circulation - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza\_vaccine#Annual\_reformulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine#Annual_reformulation).

10510,&gt; Without being able to build a relationship face to face with your manager and peers good luck advancing your career and getting promoted.
10511,This is a huge one that I see mentioned so rarely.
10512,Every time I read one of these threads on reddit it's full of people who love working from home and never want to go back to the office.
10513,"I love working from home too, it's comfortable and cheap and easy."
10514,But what about your *career*?
10515,I try to imagine if I just got hired at my company today.
10516,How the hell would I get anywhere?
10517,"Just learning the job would be a chore, much less absorbing any crossover knowledge from other departments that I'm now totally isolated from."
10518,And basically zero relationship with my coworkers or manager.
10519,How would I do any better than just quietly fading into the background and doing my job?
10520,"How would I ever get a promotion, especially in a decently brief amount of time?"
10521,"Hell, I've been at this company for years and I'm fairly high up now right beneath the C level, with a bunch of crossover knowledge and great relationships already built, and I STILL feel like my career has basically been on hold this whole year because of this."
10522,"Isn't that the term Hitler used to refer to Jews, and I am assuming you are talking about Dems?"
10523,Lol.
10524,I agree with you Spain data was not that reliable during the first wave.
10525,Yet I believe that nowadays data gathering is reliable.
10526,The correlation between cases and deaths expectarives as well as with mono (mortality by all causes) suggest there is no big mistake in the data in this second wave*.
10527,"* not sure if you know but one of the ""curiosities"" of Spanish data gathering is that we notify the cases by date of PCR collection, not by date of PCR  result."
10528,This leads to a very weird situation in which today you have 5.000 cases but in a few days today's cases will raise to 10k-12k as the labs go through the PCT buffer.
10529,"The biggest delay in PCRs is from Madrid, which has up to 10-14 days delay on lab result."
10530,Madrid situation is absolutely crazy.
10531,This is why if you check worldometer you will see a false abruptly reduction on cases on recent days that will be corrected as days go by.
10532,"**

** why??"
10533,No clue...
10534,It's the only country in the world doing it this way.
10535,"Yeah, just check out the numbers!"
10536,"Less dead, less excess mortality and 0 bankruptcies from healthcare costs!"
10537,Such an insane place that europe is.
10538,&gt;this was apparently a very sensitive test.
10539,We've seen that they can sometimes count people who have antibodies for ANY coronavirus (including the common cold) as positive.
10540,I can't tell from this if that's a problem here or not.
10541,"The potentially good news, if this is the case, is that there is research suggesting that these antibodies may still offer some protection."
10542,If you have COVID but fall out a window how do they classify it?
10543,The news is keeping that kinda stuff quiet.
10544,"&gt;Average age of death everywhere I've looked has been above life expectancy

That doesn't necessarily mean they were going to die soon."
10545,"This obviously varies by country, but in the U.S., the life expectancy of an 80 year old man is 88.7."
10546,There is actually no circulation.
10547,Gyms are not allowed to air conditioning.
10548,"As insidious as this virus is, it’s beautiful and elegant."
10549,I’d like it eradicated.
10550,Same!
10551,How am I to talk about masks when these fools don't even wear seatbelts when they drive cars?
10552,Except you need groceries to eat but going to sports is literally pointless and nobody will die if you don't do it
10553,"Well, they can basically keep outsiders out until there is a vaccine and live normally within their bubble."
10554,I'd trade for that
10555,How come reddit isn’t calling the French stupid like we called all Americans stupid?
10556,"Well, it won't matter."
10557,All they have to do is get over.
10558,Or get sent to Walter Reed.
10559,One of the two.
10560,I don't know if this is true or not but what I would like to ask is how you've come to that conclusion?
10561,"It feels that everyone I speak to they are prepared to make sweeping statements based on next to no substantiated ""evidence""

It's not a dig at you but this seems like another example someone has heard and repeated until it becomes a common opinion."
10562,I think saying the risk is minimal may be exaggerating.
10563,COVID is airborne so distancing from others may not matter if there is poor circulation at your gym.
10564,Well yeah the guy on the right has his mask on his chin...
10565,We only wear mask if we enter shops.
10566,"But in restaurants and bars, people didn't care anymore about social distancing."
10567,You say the government isnt making people stay at home and see no one but that's bullshit for some people.
10568,I'm a college student and our town for the past three weeks has put out public health orders that anyone aged 18-22 is not allowed to have any gatherings (defined as more than yourself) anywhere in town.
10569,The city itself said it would be ILLEGAL to drive your roomate to the hospital or go grocery shopping together.
10570,We cannot go out to eat at restaurants or go to friends houses or even see them outside without the risk of being ticketed.
10571,It is not propaganda just because it isnt affecting you.
10572,Owned!!!
10573,!
10574,I see that vaccine the said they already had is working very well for them.
10575,/s
10576,Call it a protest and we'll be done with it.
10577,"It's WELL past the point that a general lockdown should be in place, and fucking hospital numbers have nothing to do with it."
10578,You lockdown to get control and DRIVE THE NUMBERS DOWN TO ZERO.
10579,"And of course it would have a noticeable effect, because you can push the numbers down fast and hard."
10580,"The alternative is the numbers continue to rise, people continue to die, and significant numbers of the populous have long last debilitative health impacts."
10581,"Any saying 'nah, doesn't matter' is some of the most immoral crap you hear all too often this year."
10582,Dollar Tree sells bleach for $1.
10583,He could inject that.
10584,I wouldn't recommend it.
10585,But Trump would...for other people.
10586,"Not himself, of course."
10587,"For himself, Trump will take the experimental medicine developed from aborted babies."
10588,But Christie is other people so Trump would recommend the bleach.
10589,How do you know?
10590,The reason covid freaks me out specifically is because its been showing to have left people with long term conditions like the kind this person above is worried about.
10591,"It is not a normal flu, and we shouldn't be acting like it is."
10592,ohhh come on!!!
10593,that's so stereotypical!
10594,:P
10595,I don’t suppose there’s any way to do that sewage testing?

10603,Guess how many checkpoints to enter or leave Madrid ive seen on my way?
10604,0.
10605,This is another lie.
10606,Am not even surprised at this point.
10607,Yeh enjoy your karaoke
10608,Thanks a lot for fuelling anti-vaxxers over here Nancy.
10609,Unbelievable.
10610,Well there aren’t many more people left in the White House to infect — herd immunity!
10611,The drastically rising daily cases which caused shutdowns literally today are not an exaggeration at all
10612,"Also as an Aussie, this is 100% true!"
10613,Sibling rivalry!
10614,I'm not sure why so many people were buying into that argument.
10615,"As long as a substantial portion of the population are staying home and not interacting with society, you can't get a true sense of hard immunity"
10616,"I don’t think any of the European countries got it “right” per say bc cases are rising everywhere 

apparently except for 3 countries (Norway, Finland, Cyprus), they’ve all reached the tier by ECDC (?)"
10617,"which means they’ve all seen spikes hit at least a certain level to raise alarm 

so I’d say it isn’t Sweden but Norway that got it right lol + Finland and Cyprus 

don’t have the link for the source but i believe it was a BBC news article"
10618,Space cakes and FEBO 3 meals a day isn’t the norm?

10623,Sucks doesn’t it?
10624,I’ve already taken 6 tests.
10625,Not a chance
10626,Nope the current situation in Cali is absurd.
10627,And not much different from your weirdo fascist fantasy scenario.
10628,If you were a biz owner and a employee got sick (possiblity in the job) would you tell the public they got sick on the job?
10629,"Like the ol saying goes, hear speak, see no evil."
10630,"Assuming they followed the same standards as the RECOVERY trial, yes he got sicker than average."
10631,Is this true?
10632,Absolutely curious and wonder where a person could find that info for sourcing purposes.
10633,Thanks
10634,"Okay, now that I didn't know."
10635,I've been lucky and haven't had to leave my house here in Arizona very much.
10636,"I had to run into a couple stores this weekend and was super dismayed at how many people had their masks under their nose, under their mouth, or no where to be seen."
10637,Don't forget endangering national security too by sickening all sorts of people in the White House and related government agencies.
10638,This is why history is just as important to learn as math and science.
10639,Without historical context math and science can be used for terrible things.
10640,The FDA just did a big pushback against the white house for stricter standards.
10641,Thanksgiving is also very realistic with the timelines the companies have been talking about.
10642,The answer to how many people has actually been given and they expect 30 million in the US between November and December.
10643,Likely to be mostly healthcare workers with that number.
10644,Regular non high risk people in the US are likely looking at March-April for availability on the earliest timeline.
10645,Don't be surprised if it's a bit later.
10646,I feel so bad for all the healthcare workers.
10647,They don’t deserve this and are definitely not getting enough respect and cooperation from people
10648,Good job my friend fighting the good fight
10649,Not before I get that winning lottery ticket
10650,"I think we'll see the epidemiological recovery come in waves and vary from state to state, country to country."
10651,"The recovery won't be unified, just like the response wasn't."
10652,"So there could be many places that reach heard immunity by next near, while others do not."
10653,"That's my prediction right now, anyway."
10654,"The sentiment where I live (NYC) is that most people will unify to take it, but I'm not sure if the same can be said for let's say...Florida and Texas."
10655,"People will unilaterally want to go back to their lives by next Summer, but it will be a very pro-science / anti-science recovery."
10656,"The places that have returned to 'normal' but don't trust the science, will still have a problem on their hands of hospitals becoming overloaded."
10657,I'm not sure if there's really much that leaders in each state can do other than aggressively mobilize their vaccine education efforts for people to take it.
10658,"If they don't and hotspots keep popping up, they'll have some tough decisions to make such as requiring immunization papers to travel, attend events, school, work, etc."
10659,All his teachers have been really helpful.
10660,"Sometimes it's hard to do the therapies online and I'm sure some things are lost in translation by not being there in person, but they've all made it work to some degree."
10661,That might be an option I hadn't considered.
10662,His main case manager has been wonderful to work with (she's the one who proctored his MAPS and AIMSWEB testing online) and she has dropped off supplies for us so there might be a way to have the teachers come to us.
10663,"I feel terrible for them though, some are doing remote and in person teaching and then also running around to drop off supplies to families."
10664,I can't imagine they all feel comfortable with the various risk levels but they are doing what they need to do regardless.
10665,"I don't want to be a pain in the ass or make more work for them, I just don't want anyone risking anything more than necessary."
10666,We're waiting to hear back about the outside/masked &amp; distanced idea.
10667,"If they're ok with that then I think that's probably good enough, we just won't dawdle, and hopefully we can at least be present (not necessarily close enough to disturb the proceedingd, just enough to see what's going on.)"
10668,"For picture day they wanted the kids to go in alone and wear masks, but they could take them off for the photos (so everyone would be maskless for at least a few minutes in the same spot) and that just made me nervous."
10669,"I understand not letting parents in to keep vectors down, but I'd want to see what was happening."
10670,"Our son can do weird things like beatbox/spit,  throw himself on the ground and roll around or rub objects in his face when he's getting overloaded (which photo day can sometimes do) and during Covid times that just seems like it's asking for trouble for him and others."
10671,So we opted out.
10672,"Phone cameras are pretty good these days anyway, maybe we can get the ""real ones"" this spring if the situation improves enough."
10673,Hopefully.
10674,Doesn't mean you have a say in whether other people host or attend them.
10675,"Except both of those instances potentially transmitting something are rarer than  a medical professional having their hands on or in a patient, who odds are, thinks they have something."
10676,"And if there is Covid-19 on your steering wheel or keyboard, you don't need to be touching your face."
10677,Which people do all the time.
10678,"At that point, the mask is more of a barrier, than nothing at all."
10679,Thank you.
10680,It so often gets missed what death/pop figures are.
10681,"Top states are NY, NJ, MA, CT, LA, RI (roughly in that order)."
10682,Little RI was 5th until recently.
10683,"They have basically been confirming time and time again since April that ""there willl be no going back to the Old Normal""."
10684,"There are changes that need to be made, and they will be made."
10685,There is no going back.
10686,We were told.
10687,"I mean .. ""New Normal""."
10688,Right?
10689,Did you not catch that part?
10690,That's for the top courses at the top unis.
10691,There are a whole heap of fake institutions where people pretend to study.
10692,"The third largest group of students is from Nepal,  one of the poorest countries in the world."
10693,Obviously there is also the possibility for residency which is attractive.
10694,"It's not *just* about masks, it's about taking all the reasonable precautions."
10695,Symbolising masks as the be-all-and-end-all of it trivialises the situation.
10696,"Basic awareness &amp; precautions yes, but focussing on one aspect can be fatal."
10697,"Trump seemingly relied on negative testing for his unmasked Whitehouse bubble, with no other precautions."
10698,"You have a mix of outdoors, social distancing, masks and sanitising and you'll generally be covered for the gaps in your system."
10699,1... 0... -1... -2...
10700,Honestly look at Florida and Arizona's daily new cases charts.
10701,They're identical.
10702,"His whole treatment is the medical equivalent of his ""small loan of a million dollars"", which in actuality turned out to be $200k/yr he was getting from the age of 3, constant bail-outs by his dad, and eventually $400 million that he inherited."

10714,Buying time for what?
10715,You are never going to solve anything in that way.
10716,"Social distancing and masks can be good to limit the damage until a vaccine or a cure is found, otherwise they are useless in the long term."
10717,"To be honest at that point it would be better to do a proper hard lockdown for 4-5 months, to completely eliminate the virus (like zero cases)."

10787,We are not twisted we want what’s best for the people that live under the ccp sure they have good covid 19 response but that is because they are a distatorship
10788,And it’s also infectious.
10789,Maybe more infectious than COVID
10790,"Fuck, I guess I'll go get tested."
10791,"Dude at work got sore throat, I got it two days later, been coughing up shit and runny nose."

10809,"And then go out and live your life guilt free, knowing that your risk of spreading Covid to someone vulnerable is exceedingly low."
10810,Trump and Pence should have been separated to opposite coasts back in January to prevent any possible chance of both of them catching it at the same time.
10811,Pence should have been sequestered in to a bunker once Trump tested positive.
10812,"Even if he doesn't have covid, one slip could throw the country in to chaos."

10826,So we’ll never know how he’s really feeling.
10827,"Based on past history of lying and projection, I’d guess it’s been pretty bad for him."
10828,Except he won’t.
10829,All of these scum in the government need to be voted out.
10830,DC will never become a state.

10833,But because hey are a dictatorship they could respond to covid 19 doesn’t make them a good country
10834,Seeing that in other states as well.
10835,I mean .. *isnt it*?
10836,Back at the beginning we werent really good at testing.
10837,"Meanwhile every week for months you see articles saying ""Covid was flying around months before we knew about it!"""
10838,"or ""10x as many people have had Covid than we thought!"""
10839,"That is the truth, right?"
10840,And so now we are testing WAY more people than ever before.
10841,Doesnt it make sense that we would be finding a lot more cases than we were back at the beginning?

10863,It’s entirely possible though less common to die from Covid three days after a positive test.
10864,A healthy young man died that quickly in Texas; his neighbor tried to revive him via CPR.
10865,It was his heart that failed.
10866,Covid is a clotting dsorder.
10867,The young fit people who die from Covid are often killed by strokes — clots traveled to the brain.
10868,If you’re going to reply to yourself on an alt at least try to not make it obvious
10869,Need to define what a serious symptom means.
10870,"High fever, needing supplemental oxygen, being in ICU ?"
10871,Shorty because they get such good treatment that only billionaires can afford.
10872,They are tested almost daily and they results are not delayed.

10886,"What I’m trying to say is, the healthcare system will use it to extort people."
10887,Even such as CVS.
10888,They might offer it for free.
10889,"But you have to have a CVS card, and you have to go into the store."
10890,Perhaps a bit of information collecting along the way.
10891,Just driving through town yesterday I saw people walking into restaurants and gas stations with no masks.
10892,It's disheartening.

10910,Like the 1918 Pandemic.

10912,Mainly because they were in barracks in military camps.
10913,That started the spread.

10927,Actually we do know know how to control the pandemic.

10939,As a Canadian.... the US never had restrictions.
10940,Its been state by state since the beginning.
10941,So what’s your point then ?
10942,Masks do help Or don’t ?
10943,Or would you suggest to abolish any kind of human interaction?
10944,Myself and the family had it since February it’s not cool.
10945,"WOW, who knew this would happen?"
10946,..or no more potatoes!
10947,Given that those that survive do so with severe vascular and lung damage even in mild cases I'd say this metric is very important.
10948,"You end up turning a healthy and athletic 20 something into a 70 something who has never exercised a day in their life

This metric is a good way of showing how many people have a shortened lifespan and will need a ton of extra support to stay alive throughout it"
10949,"&gt;For a virus that mostly kills the elderly and unhealthy, as a total rate of population survivability of 99.8%?"
10950,Which is about 2-3x more deadly then the flu.
10951,I’ll take that over a hard lockdown.
10952,A few things here: the overall mortality rate is more like 1%.
10953,It’s only in the range of 0.2% for people under 60 (which is 1 in 500).
10954,"The equivalent mortality rate for that age group for the flu is 1 or 2 in 100,000."
10955,"So no matter how you look at it, COVID is substantially more deadly than the flu."
10956,"The other thing is that for flu statistics, they only count symptomatic infections."
10957,So the 0.1% mortality rate that people like to throw around doesn’t count people who are asymptomatic for the flu.
10958,So the difference between flu and COVID is even more severe than it looks like at first glance.
10959,"Actually, it might be the best thing for the country."
10960,The left doesn't have to worry about the next Trump-made disaster.
10961,"The right doesn't have to admit they voted for a loser a second time, because a corpse can't win an election anyway (except ""as a joke."")"
10962,Gyms closed and no lats and yoga mats.
10963,So is it possible to allow theme parks to develop plans to open partially with reduced capacity and increased cleaning?
10964,It seems like they aren't even given a chance to attempt to come up with a plan.
10965,I think a lot of parents are almost forced into that though...  we have been in this position with our daughter.
10966,We don't want her to suffer or starve and we know how hard it can be in the USA for people in poverty.
10967,"The fear that your kids will suffer if they don't get a good job ""with insurance"" is insane."
10968,You worry- what if they get sick?
10969,What if they can't make enough to cover their rent?
10970,These are all horrible positions to be in here.
10971,"Ever since our daughter was small we have always said ""get good grades, you need a good job ""WITH INSURANCE."""
10972,"Of course we aren't saying to be miserable, but we are saying that the USA doesn't have a lot of back up systems for people who don't have insurance, or rent money, or food..."

10980,"I mean, to each their own - but to me, Disney is hell on earth."

10983,"Instead, they opt for this nonsense."
10984,In the middle of a pandemic especially - you'd need your head examined to even consider it.
10985,What a baseless argument.
10986,Everyone that’s affected by something negative wants immediate change doesn’t matter if you’re young or old.
10987,I don’t agree the campaigns worked as well as you think if it takes 40 years to minimize drunk driving and people smoking.
10988,You expect long term social changes with things like education not things that harm society
10989,"France has several and often large “green” areas around the country with markedly lower incidence, places where mask wearing was enforced, etc."
10990,So not as uniformly out of hand as here.
10991,We have no such areas.

11001,"They're a fucking liar, and just making up shit so they can get more money from me!"
11002,Please provide us a source where our fucking agency spread the myth that young people can't get the disease and that schools are harmless.
11003,Perfectly fucking serious.
11004,There’s a goddamn pandemic.
11005,I canceled my honeymoon.
11006,Don’t travel unless it is actually essential.
11007,Don’t go to Disney Land.
11008,That's ridiculous.
11009,Just because you don't like an information doesn't make it low quality.
11010,This is a group of very serious industry leaders presenting the results of months of studies about COVID.
11011,How is that low quality?
11012,"Check the man's twitter, it's the latest video he's done."
11013,"I believe it’s a mixture of a couple things

-	**1) CDC on masks at the beginning:** Discussion on masks started to happen but there seemed to be some pushback on them as some felt they were more needed by healthcare workers than the common man (remember seeing some debates in this sub at the time)."
11014,"A month or so later, then masks started to become more accepted
-	**2) Shutdown effects:** At the beginning when stay-at-home orders were starting to be handed out nationally, they seemed to be accepted by most, but about a month or so out, the fatigue started to set in and then the unemployment numbers skyrocketed."
11015,This obviously pissed of some people and made them hate their governors for shutting down their place for “a little flu”.
11016,The greatest snapshot of this would be this [Joe Rogan Episode](https://youtu.be/8m4XEPgkVOM) that was supposed to be a fight companion but just turned in to a discussion about Covid.
11017,"Sad but so funny at times
-	**3) Early flu comparisons:** Around Feb/March, the comparisons seemed to be thrown out here and there, especially on Fox News that would create the seed of doubt for how effective Covid could really, eventually turning in to calling it all a shame or a hoax."
11018,Look up any anti-mask vid and most will just say it’s overblown or it’s not real.
11019,Sometimes some articles or videos check back in on those people a few months down the road and they do a complete 180 when they actually experience Covid for themselves or if a loved one did.
11020,-	**4) Trump constantly downplaying:** I’m sure you can find so many timeline videos from the beginning of January to now where Trump just downplays the virus so much.
11021,"It goes from It will never come here &gt; Only 15 people will get &gt; Only old people will get it &gt; It’s basically the flu &gt; it will be gone by Easter &gt; the summer will kill it &gt; It’s the flu guys, cmon &gt; At least 2.2 million people didn’t die &gt; Is there someway we can inject sunlight in to our bodies?"
11022,"&gt; We’re doing a good job handling it &gt; I have it &gt; I beat it, it’s nothing."
11023,The last part that we are in now is the most crucial as now his supporters will be emboldened to keep spreading it if nothing bad happened to their candidate.
11024,"They’ll even watch the Fox News phone interview with Hannity last night and think that he only got some coughs

Over these past couple of months, this is what I’ve pretty much observed."
11025,"I’m really thinking it’s just 2 and 4 that are keeping this thing alive, especially 4."
11026,"If you wear a mask and still get Covid, then a full face respirator isn't overkill."
11027,Wisconsin started a statewide mask mandate 2 months ago and we're exploding.
11028,"This is the equivalent of threatening to beat someone up on reddit; What you're saying is completely unverifiable, and therefore irrelevant."
11029,"Let's assume however,  that you're telling the truth: your wealth has given you the illusion of status."
11030,Congratulations on your hard earned victory.
11031,"As you've been able to retire early,  you might broaden your horizons, for example learning the *international* standard for writing dates?"
11032,"It's pretty amazing that you made your fortune without *ever* encountering such a widely used format, but hey good for you!"
11033,"This is false, though?"
11034,Universities and secondary schools were closed in spring.
11035,"The ""young people"" that supposedly do not spread the virus as much are primary school-aged children (and those schools have been open continuously)."
11036,"I bet this won’t cause any “accidental” side effects - medical corporations LOVE doing things for free, look at how they operate in the US!"
11037,"Well, at least it will save me some cash since my SO can’t go for awhile."
11038,"Also the Group that's had to work our grocery stores/ other essential businesses during the entire pandemic, go to in person classes, go do the shopping for their older parents/relatives/neighbors, etc."
11039,"Yes some of them are selfish, but most of them arent, and stop blaming us for keeping the economy going, without us, you wouldnt be able to get groceries, or even order things."
11040,I do think that most chinese people are better at following the measures taken against covid (at least compared to the people in my country.
11041,some people act as if wearing a mask is the apocalypse here).
11042,"But i do find it pretty hard to believe that china, a humongous country with 1.5+ billion people and multiple cities with well over 10 million residents, has had no local cases for almost 50 days..."
11043,Yes.
11044,All that is fine.
11045,You don’t need hyperbole to strengthen your case against Trump.
11046,It only weakens it.
11047,Did you miss the part about that they had a press conference saying the opposite?
11048,Geez.
11049,"Regarding the spread among students, Matilda Ernkrans also said: 

&gt;Ni måste skärpa er \[och ta ert ansvar\]."

11051,"I think the harsher tone is useful, as a lot of young people are behaving carelessly and might need direct message like this."

11053,I am so nervous thinking of Holiday shopping and Black Friday.
11054,"My employer furloughed me in March but is pulling me back now, not because the numbers are lower or they’ve implemented new safety measures, but because they’re sick of not making money off of me."
11055,They’re pulling me back because what I do is too profitable leading up to the holidays for them to miss out.
11056,I’m sure plenty of other companies will be making the same horrible call in the next couple months.
11057,Okay let me know when your insanely restrictive lockdown finally ends.
11058,"Oh, and also let me know when your gov swoops in a locks you down a *third* time once cases inevitably break out again"
11059,"Yeah, families should be discussing this."
11060,"Just to make sure everyone stays safe, and I really think families need to have a plan for the holidays."
11061,"The holidays are going to be tough, and if we saw case increases after Memorial Day, the 4th of July, and Labor Day, I can't imagine what it will be like after Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's."

11072,I knew I’d have to make sacrifices as a parent and that’s what I’m doing.
11073,"You’re right, it is the right decision to make."
11074,It'd be even cooler to drop the stupid radiation scare of the 80's and invest in nuclear.

11088,I've seen quite a few retailers already post that they aren't having an in-store black Friday this year.
11089,I hope all other retailers follow suit.
11090,It'd be idiotic to encourage that kind of chaos right now
11091,I'm VERY thankful for Walz.
11092,You were being perfectly clear.
11093,It's not you.
11094,iceland better react quick.
11095,this virus moves at the speed of lightening.
11096,and the people of iceland better take it fuckin serious
11097,You answered your own question - you don't think it's effective.
11098,"On what grounds do you not think it's effective, when study after study proves that they are effective at cutting down the spread?"
11099,Good point.
11100,"I think I come at it from the UK perspective (I'm a Brit living in Germany who still unfortunately works in London so I have experience of both countrys' dealings with covid, politically and on the ground.)"
11101,"The UK has imo said a lot more, albeit most of it absolute bullshit."
11102,"The stuff the German government has said has imo been much more blunt, to the point, and rooted in reality."
11103,"Unless they put boots on the ground to force people to stick to the rules, it does really come down to us as individuals to do the right thing."
11104,"And while many Germans have an issue doing just that, they still mostly bother to mask up on the train and supermarket unlike my fellow citizens in the UK who are too busy arguing about how mild asthma is an ""exception"" because they don't want to wear a mask for whatever reason and open coughing on trains and supermarkets."
11105,I've been at work in London the last month so perhaps I've missed something back home while trying to figure out how to do my job without catching covid.
11106,But put it this way - I'm counting down the minutes before I can come back in 10 days and hunker down.
11107,"Perhaps Merkel et Al could do some more and say more, but at this point I don't really know what they can say to make those who need to listen take action and change their behaviour."
11108,"Either people are being cautious and risk assessing as we go along, toeing the line between prevention and topping up our mental and physical health in some way, or they don't care/deny the severity or existence of the virus."
11109,I wish I knew the answer as I've lost many friends this year to conspiracy bullshit and covid denial.
11110,"I'm not sure how politics can cure that, but id love to know if you had any ideas!"
11111,Stockholm had a winter holiday (spring break) in the last week (9) of March.

11123,Court rooms going to be packed
11124,"I think this question, along with many others, will keep epidemiologists in business for decades."
11125,"My read of the sparse literature is that the background mortality rate, at least in the first few months, was \~5% below expected."
11126,"In the USA, 5% translates to \~130k more deaths that might be COVID-related from March thru the end of August."
11127,"Crudely, this means we might be approaching 500k deaths."
11128,"My plan is to show up for Thanksgiving, stay the whole month through Christmas, and then drive back for New Year's."

11130,Yeah
11131,"Hi French, rosbif here."
11132,Watched most of the Tour de France.
11133,Madness that still went on looking back on it and the manic climbs full of people without masks.
11134,Controversial: Case counts have less significance after it’s been established that too many people don’t die from the virus.
11135,"They also had a ""Goodbye covid"" party back in May."
11136,"Lmao, what else will you ""skip"" until a vaccine is coming?"
11137,I’ve got a co-worker that says her family usually goes to the beach four times a year.
11138,"Because of *gestures at everything*, they haven’t gone once this year."
11139,She’s currently trying to plan a trip to Florida/Disney for sometime around Christmas because hell-if-I-know.
11140,"That head of security needs to toughen up and not let COVID dominate his life, there's nothing to be afraid of."
11141,"As Trump said in front of the White House, God gave the virus to Trump, because when he got it Trump then told the doctor which drugs to use, and it worked!"
11142,Trump found a cure.
11143,"The fake news media is not reporting it because they will do anything to stop him winning an election, they're disgusting."
11144,(Do I need to include an /s?
11145,"I'm afraid I do, as deranged as this paragraph reads, it's all stuff that Trump said and therefore stuff that his supporters probably believe)."
11146,Thanks.
11147,I’m in special events and we get almost 0 focus from Congress despite our industry being completely destroyed over night.
11148,There are/were 12 million workers in the events space that no one really thinks about because we put all the fun up and then slink to the shadows.
11149,But we ARE HURTING.
11150,"Also, most of our work is so specialized we have nowhere to turn to."
11151,I made $120k in 2019 and then dropped to $0 from my career after March.
11152,My family is surviving on whatever the government deems adequate for us and my wife’s much smaller salary.
11153,I really have no idea what to do.
11154,Abandon my 13+ yr career and get an entry level job at a supermarket?
11155,I guess.
11156,But it just won’t be enough for our rent and the diapers for my baby.

11166,Why?
11167,"I still try to keep 1-2 yard distance to other people when I'm out and about, I wash my hands regularly, and I don't travel to places with high infection rates."
11168,I adhere to most of the things that are proven to be effective.
11169,I just refuse to wear a mask because it's uncomfortable as fuck and I don't think it is effective - at least in the type of settings i'm in.
11170,Also you need to register at hotels.
11171,Hotels are allowed to ask for your passport or drivers license..
11172,Registers need to be stored for some time (tax reasons).
11173,Imagine if we had known in March how effective a simplemask was.
11174,"If you think about it, we could honestly get a 1-3% CFR again."
11175,Some years the flu vaccine does just about nothing because the wrong strains are circulating.
11176,"Even in those years, there's no comparison to covid even with the drastic measures we've taken with covid."
11177,Also nite that the first big bump in covid deaths was from it circulating without shutdowns and mask use.
11178,That's more like what it is without those.

11184,Listening is a big problem and ohhhhh money 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
11185,This would be awesome.
11186,And there are also cases of people getting paid to get false positive so the hospital's can make money out of it.
11187,So it's both sides of the coin.
11188,If you take into account both then we end with an average of whatever is the number now.
11189,"Lots of that toll is yet to be paid through deaths of despair, poverty (although this will mostly be in developing nations) and cancer."
11190,It will dwarf the Covid deaths thanks to you panicked fools.
11191,Not exactly how this works... they need to extensively verify its safety to the general public before most people will be willing to take it.
11192,I’m not giving a brand new vaccine to my kid that I’m not 100% confident about.
11193,"Give me the necessary data and trials and I will gladly be the first in line, but only after wide scientific consensus."
11194,"I don’t trust the Trump administration, so I will not be vaccinating my family if I feel that the vaccine was rushed due to political pressure."
11195,"""cloning your own antibodies"" is very misleading and not how it works."
11196,"They are just regular (tailor made) antibodies, which are harvested from a culture of cloned immune cells."
11197,"These immune cells can be sourced from mice, humans, or the antibody can be ""humanized""."
11198,The harvested antibodies are then injected into the patient
11199,Well as soon as we reopened we would be right back where we are with increased infections.
11200,"The only way to really stop is to close and stay closed until a vaccine is out...but that also will put families in economic hardship without a income supplement and that is not passing might as well pass a UBI, about the same chance of getting approved for the long enough duration covid will require."

11293,The fire authorities have integrated controlled burning like the first people for decades (they just don't hunt game out of it).
11294,It hasn't been working recently because the *weather* has been so hot and dry year round that the number of controlled burns per year to keep the bush safe just can't be performed.
11295,There aren't enough days in the year with dew on the ground in the morning to get round every section on the roster.

11314,Beating people up for wearing masks is definitely bad.
11315,But I still doubt it would only be two years if we adopted this practice.
11316,Suppose we did.
11317,"In two years, they would once again say ""well, masks are still needed because x, y, and z."""
11318,The part about adopting a culture of mask wearing is what gives it away.
11319,"Basically, I have several issues with mask-wearing beyond a vaccine."
11320,"First, there is a significant ecological impact associated with it."
11321,We litter enough as it is and we should be trying to curb that as much as possible.
11322,"Sure, we can wear reusable cloth masks but how many do?"
11323,"Besides that, there are the social problems that I described above."
11324,Winter coats don't cause such problems.
11325,There's also economic problems.
11326,"You can't eat at a restaurant with a mask on, and I can't ever see myself working out in a gym with a mask on."
11327,It's hard enough to breathe in one as is.
11328,"The only way around this is to selectively pick and choose which indoor venues you wear a mask in, which would seem to almost defeat the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place."
11329,"Ultimately, we went back to normal after the Spanish Flu."
11330,People stopped wearing masks.
11331,I don't see why it should be any different now.
11332,Are you Floridian?
11333,"There’s no mask mandate from DeSantis, and he suspended police fining any mask compliance violation at local levels."
11334,"However schools, counties, and businesses are majority mandating masks."
11335,"Is it causation, perhaps; correlation, yup."
11336,"We are steadily at 2000 cases daily for past 30 days, even with phase 3-full open-for 2 weeks now."

11342,There is not a single public place where fewer than 98% of people are wearing masks.
11343,"And, when we go into SLC, its seems that people are even more stringent about masks."
11344,"Besides all that, for whatever reason, young population, healthy population, sunshine, altitude, etc, COVID has been kind to Utah."
11345,Currently only about a 0.4 percent death rate.
11346,That is of course just slightly higher than flu.
11347,"And of course most of those deaths occurring in elderly people, many of which are living in care facilities."
11348,"I think people are realizing the actual risks of dying from COVID are extremely small in Utah, and that being social for them, family gatherings, dance

11372,"We’d have way more vaccines by then, anyways?"
11373,Problem is you have around 50%+ of people/workforce who are essential to maintain societal infrastructure that we rely on to survive.
11374,That’s enough people to still transmit and allow the virus to remain viable.
11375,There is no such thing as a hard lockdown.
11376,"And if there was you’d literally kill well over 50% of the population due to hunger, dehydration, disease, murder, elements, etc."
11377,and probably closer to 95% of the population.
11378,"For a virus that mostly kills the elderly and unhealthy, as a total rate of population survivability of 99.8%?"
11379,Which is about 2-3x more deadly then the flu.
11380,I’ll take that over a hard lockdown.

11506,I don't believe you
11507,I was taking 4kIU/day and got sick and had blood work done and I wasn't even within the acceptable window for the amount.
11508,Been taking 10k/Day for a few months now and I feel better.
11509,I'm black and winter is coming and it always makes me feel terrible.
11510,Only discovered it was vitamin D last year on a whim during the onset of winter and immediate bodyaches and feelings of existential dread.
11511,I'm 27 btw.
11512,Uuuh what.
11513,Most countries are taking on big depression level economic dips with the shutdowns that are happening.
11514,That is brutal stuff even if you can imagine some even worse stuff.
11515,So fucking unnecessary.
11516,RIP.
11517,I don’t see why the agents family can’t sue for negligence.
11518,Yup and we don't even know the half of it yet.
11519,We're so early in the whole process.
11520,Not even a fucking year.
11521,"When health systems are overwhelmed in a spike, everybody die more not just covid."
11522,Covid mortality also go up.
11523,Covid also attacks the heart.
11524,"Last, heart disease is sort of a catch all for death certificates and would be even more in a spike situation."
11525,So there's definitely some element of truth that people who were already sick are at most risk to die if they get hit with a 2nd blow (e.g.
11526,"by COVID), and there's also confounding factors, like fewer people have been going to hospital this year (because they're scared to contract COVID, or because hospitals shut down non-essential visits for a while) so maybe cancer diagnosis - and subsequently ""cancer deaths"" - has gone down."
11527,But anyway!
11528,None of that is really the point.
11529,"Take a look at the 3rd graph on the page (""April was the cruelest month.."" Total deaths, regardless of cause, have been up **enormously** in 2020 compared to the same months in previous years."
11530,"Whatever you want to say is the cause of death, people are dying at unprecedented rates."
11531,"Also, if anything, the final chart on the page suggests that COVID deaths are under-reported."
11532,"Lately, the 4th leading cause of death has been basically ""unknown reason"" (the black line) which normally hovers near the bottom."
11533,"These might be COVID as well, for lack of a better explanation."
11534,"Or they might be those ""missing"" cancer deaths from people who never got diagnosed in 2020 and then died in their sleep."
11535,Most of their deaths were at the beginning of the pandemic due to breakouts in care homes.
11536,"They have VERY few deaths in the last 3 months, yet their economy is almost fully functioning again."
11537,"(And of course, their deaths per capita are still much lower than the US)"
11538,Nazi's gassed and murdered people bro.
11539,Mostly everyone is against Nazi's except Nazi's.
11540,But people are against science and then turn around when they can benefit from it is a different story.
11541,They have kept privatizing a shitload of stuff in Sweden for a long time now and everything just keeps getting worse because of it.
11542,I seriously don't get how they keep getting away with it.
11543,They also got rid of our defence storages of supplies etc which is why we had such a shortage the first months of the pandemic unlike Finland which still has all of their storages.
11544,[deleted]
11545,"Best comparison is probably Canada since it has similar geographic pros/cons as the US, and had similar timing for a lot of their COVID-19 actions (stopping travel, etc)."
11546,"The difference is that political leadership in Canada took it seriously, and now Canada has only about 40% as many deaths (per capita) from COVID as the US."
11547,"That means around 100,000 or so Americans could have been saved from dying from COVID had Trump and the Republicans taken this more seriously."
11548,Tragic...and infuriating.
11549,I'm of the opinion that to heal and move on the whole Trump cult built around the GOP from the time of the Tea Party needs to be fully exposed and expunged.
11550,Otherwise Trump-like candidates will turn up five years from now and the mindset won't change.
11551,This doesn't make China looks suspicious at all
11552,Wonder if there's a correlation there...

11621,Our eyes met so I know she had to have seen the look of disgust in my eyes.
11622,There is no freaking way she had any medical issue that prevented her from wearing a mask for the short time she was in the store.

11727,"But on the issue of masks, few organizations have been more pro-mask then the LDS church."
11728,So the idea that the Mormon church has such strong control over people which is why they are not wearing masks is absurd.
11729,Furthermore.
11730,Been around Salt Lake quite a bit.

12038,"While his doctors certainly know a lot more than we do, it sounds to me as though some of these decisions were being made by trump, for instance the use of Regeneron."
12039,"His health is also potentially being misrepresented, as evidenced by his video appearances."
12040,What's nonsense is believing anything coming out of Trump or his doctor's mouths.
12041,I did a google translate.
12042,It’s not great.
12043,What happens if families are separated - they can meet but quarantine with them?
12044,The action committee of the East Iceland Civil Defense Committee encourages those who come to East Iceland after a stay in the capital area to take a break for 14 days after entering the area to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infections.
12045,This is stated in the announcement of the action board from today.
12046,It says that the action government knows that many people are interested in moving between parts of the country in light of the state of the epidemic.
12047,"Therefore, it reiterates the recommendation of the epidemiological authorities that people do not travel from the capital to the country at all, unless there is an urgent need."
12048,"It is emphasized that fishing trips, workplace trips and more are not considered urgent matters unless necessary."
12049,"In cases where people consider it necessary to move between regions, the action government encourages people to take special care in dealing with others and to take a break for 14 days after arriving in the east."
12050,"The Action Committee requests that its recommendations be respected, as this is the only way to ensure that infections do not spread between regions, while other measures have not been taken."
12051,The situation is still unchanged in the east in that only one active infection is registered according to Covid.is.
12052,Five are quarantined.
12053,Definitely the right thing to do or otherwise they're going to become the hotspot next to California which would have required the Golden State to quarantine anyone from Arizona.

12096,"That's one of the things that annoyed me the most where I live, we were the only state to have a second wave in Australia."
12097,People then got sulky about lockdown and masks and didn't follow guidelines.

12099,Instead been in a state of lockdown for many months and 8 weeks of stage 4.
12100,"You're correct, the data is incomplete, I should have mentioned that."
12101,"This doesn't mean that all unknown cases have completely different causes, just that we don't know."
12102,"Doesn't really change my question though, what measures to take?"

12104,"What, it's a classic."
12105,"Very highly-acclaimed and every Australian should see it

12106,"I saw it when it premiered at Cannes in 1971, and it left me speechless."
12107,"Visually, dramatically, atmospherically and psychologically, it's beautifully calibrated and it gets under your skin one encounter at a time, right along with the protagonist played by Gary Bond."

12109,"Of course, I would characterise it as calming and uplifting, not unsettling and disturbing."

12113,But worldwide empirical evidence doesn’t support suppression as a strategy.
12114,"The very few cases of local eradication were countries that locked down very early, very hard, and most of them were literal islands that now have to be sealed off from the rest of the world until a vaccine."
12115,"Not to mention, they still suffered the economic, social, and cultural effects of the lockdown."
12116,"And in the (plausible) chance we don’t get a vaccine, they’re screwed."
12117,Not necessarily.
12118,At least not when looked at from a US perspective.
12119,I took the US as an example since it's where most users here live.
12120,There's several other countries that have both had much more strict responses and have ended up much worse than Sweden.

12171,Shockingly florida does also.
12172,I can look up my county and see all the cases and quarantine of the kids and teachers.
12173,This isn't quite true.
12174,I don't believe the version of Excel they were using was the problem.
12175,The problem has occurred because somebody used the XLS file format.
12176,"That can happen with any version of Excel, although obviously newer versions of Excel default to using XLSX."
12177,My organisation (also UK government but not central government and not health related) upgraded to Office 2013 six years ago and Office 2016 over two years ago and we still have a shit load of DOC (as opposed to DOCX) files in circulation.
12178,We have far fewer XLS files in use but it still happens - there are some templates people have kept going in the old format for years and we also have horrible VBA based processes written by people who left years ago that we run once a year and these still spit out and consume XLS files.
12179,The reason I'm fairly sure PHE use a currentish version of Excel is that you can find files from them on gov.uk going back to 2013.
12180,"If you look at the metadata of these files, they list Public Health England employees/researchers (yeah, they don't remove that)."
12181,"Anyway, you can get a VBA property identifying which version of Excel was used to save the file (ThisWorkbook.CalculateVersion)

I had a quick look at a couple of test files and this is my guess (based on a very shallow check)

January 2013 - Excel 2010 - XLSX format  -  [Link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/325916/Cryptosporidium.xlsx)

January 2015 - Excel 2010 - XLSX format  - [Link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396885/Shingles_annual_2013-14_data_by_CCG_with_numerators_and_denominators_for_reporting_practices.xlsx)

December 2016 - Excel 2016 - XLS format(!)"
12182,"- [Link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/578129/HPV_2015_to_16_Tables.xls)

So my guess would be : 

1."
12183,"Either someone has fucked up manually creating a file in XLS format, or repurposed an old file."
12184,2.
12185,"More likely, they've got some weird VBA type integration which pulls in CSV files and they've kept it in XLS format because the initial use of this never imagined they'd hit these kind of limits."
12186,So someone has made an error but that's besides the point really.
12187,Excel should not be used for this sort of thing.
12188,"As I say, I work at local government level and we've done work on Coronavirus covering a few thousand people."
12189,There's no way we would use Excel for data storage even at our level.
12190,tl;dr - It's not just a matter of updating software.
12191,Excel isn't a database.

12315,"Nevermind the fact that the health minister said in a tv interview that ""nobody in the world tests asyntomatics and asyntomatics don't spread the virus""."
12316,It's not incompetence but more or less they're tired of a full lockdown.
12317,"&gt; Just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you're immune(it won't be effective for everyone)

then what's the point of it?"
12318,might as well go for herd immunity because most people aren't going to spend another 1 or even 2 years doing this.
12319,Especially if you're not elderly or vulnerable

12333,"Yes, but NYC still got to a 0.33% PFR, and the counties in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas got to 0.2-0.25% officially (certainly much higher in reality), and that was not with much more than a 20% attack rate."
12334,"The point is that the mortality does not go up linearly with spread, once hospitals are collapsed, it shoots up dramatically."
12335,"If you are from Peru, you know that much better than me, but from what I was reading and watching, you had people there hooked on oxygen bottles in the parking lots outside the hospitals and yet others who couldn't even get oxygen at all."

12347,Where are the reefs that that recovered in a year or two?
12348,I am assuming that there are scientific papers and or published articles and studies to back these claims up.
12349,Damn straight!
12350,you do realize the approval or rejection of that report has nothing to do with the validity of this news article and its value.
12351,it also ignores the research that shows that mask wearing may potentially lead to immunity that actually fits their notion but perhaps not their ideology: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913.
12352,it is far too broad to allow for loose interpretation.

12380,The Danish government started recommending them when on public transport after seeing a worrying rise in cases (and have extended that mandate in certain areas after the increase didn’t slow down).

12415,"Think what you want, but I think this is right..."
12416,You gonna cite anything from that or are you just being cynical?
12417,I think the summer climate changes had more to do with keeping the virus in check than anything the Northeast did.
12418,Covid19 deaths are completely preventable.
12419,We know this to be true because of the data acquired the past year of how mask use and social distancing mitigated this virus.
12420,Stop.

12473,"People can be unreasonable, but I also don't believe that the information has been made available in a way that is understandable to the average person."
12474,"Outside my work sphere, anyone I have spoken to recently have thought that masks were either 1: completely useless, or 2: that they were only there to make people feel more at ease."
12475,"They couldn't understand that even though a mask will not stop you from getting the virus, the statistical decrease is significant at a population level."
12476,"They just figured ""doesn't stop me from getting it, therefore it is useless."""
12477,"It wasn't wilful ignorance, stupidity or malice, but just a genuine inability to understand."
12478,"&amp;#x200B;

 This misunderstanding is frustrating, but probably just because most people don't have any kind of background in stats, and so it is unreasonable to assume they would immediately understand it."
12479,"After all, how do you even know that you don't understand something?"
12480,"They had an explanation for why masks were encouraged, and that was good enough for them."

 I believe that the majority of people fall into this same misunderstanding."

12486,Yikes
12487,So what happen to their awesome vaccine?
12488,&gt;Controversial: Case counts have less significance after it’s been established that too many people don’t die from the virus.
12489,"It has not been established that too many people don't die from the virus, at all."
12490,&gt; because they know their history.
12491,Exactly what history do they know?
12492,Schools and universities restart.
12493,Not that it is students fault.
12494,It just wasn't thought through.
12495,In Spain we have been having over 12k per day and we have less than a third of the population of Russia.
12496,People seem to love hearing when something bad happens to Russia because of their government but those dying and suffering are people with loves and hopes just the same.
12497,It is sad that politicians are failing us all so greatly around the globe.
12498,This is false.
12499,The comorbidities listed on their death certificates were a direct result of being infected of covid19.
12500,Stop fucking lying.
12501,These people would still be alive if they hadn't become infected.
12502,It is all of europe simultaneously going up.
12503,Russians are white so it’s okay
12504,Why can't Boris Johnson just handle the coronavirus like he did to the rugby playing Japanese kid  😭
12505,"Yes, because all the precautions we have lower your chance of getting the infection, not remove it entirely."
12506,"The entire point of controlling the infection is assuring we, on a global scale, don’t get so many people sick that it overwhelms hospitals’ capacity to treat them."
12507,"There’s no way to confirm you won’t get infected until a vaccine is out and tested, but if we can minimize the amount of people getting sick at a time, we can ensure those who do get the medical treatment we need."
12508,"The price of healthcare in your country is an issue, yes, but it isn’t the point here."
12509,Putting this here as a preventative note for those who complain that they can’t afford to go to the Hospital.
12510,"That’s terrible, but it’s your government’s fault for actively trying to kill you, not the virus’."
12511,Citations or did you pull this out of your butt?
12512,You stay safe too friend and thank you for sharing your experience with me.
12513,"Yup, I'm a Swede."
12514,I can't really see `useless` being used in the sciencemag article.
12515,"Also I've not really been, as they wrote, discouraged from using it by the agency."
12516,"But my personal opinion is, as a person living in Gothenburg, that I wouldn't mind using it in public transportation since I can't keep distance there."
12517,"But never been discouraged, just not advised."
12518,"I have been doing it recently too, though not before the pandemic."
12519,"My reasoning is that I'm lucky to have a job that's reliable despite the pandemic, so I'm able to, and normally these are restaurants I would have gone to eat at so I want to support them and their employees as I normally would so that they'll all still be there once this is over."
12520,It's almost like you only care about yourself and nothing about the future and education of the youth.
12521,It's almost like you are so selfish that you think it's justified to lock everyone up for your personal gain of having a fraction of a fraction lower risk of getting the virus.
12522,"As of date, there has been more fatalities from car accidents than from COVID among the young."
12523,It's almost as if you don't care about the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in front of your eyes.
12524,The closure of borders and less spending on humanitarian aid is threatening to push millions more into starvation.
12525,"It's almost like you are confusing what benefits yourself, with what benefits the world."
12526,Most of these deaths are 100% unnecessary.
12527,Said the guy who caused millions of blue screens of death
12528,"Death count difference in Europe is not a lie in most cases though, it's often because of the chosen method for reporting them but it's 100% assumed by european govs."
12529,It's not the same for Russian numbers.
12530,"For instance, France v Germany reported death tolls make France look way worse, but Germany doesn't test post-mortem."
12531,"So if someone had known comorbidities or simply died in quarantine, he's not reported in order to fight against the propagation of the virus better."
12532,You can't really call Germans liars for considering testing dead people is less useful than testing living ones for fighting the virus...
12533,So you *can't* give a valid source where the FHM explicitly state what that face masks are useless.
12534,So sick of this garbage journalism.
12535,Social media has completely ruined any credible news reporting.
12536,Always has to be amped up.
12537,Soon they'll be seamlessly integrating news reports into WWE events to keep people's attention
12538,I do because I used to work for tips and understand how hard it is to make ends meet.
12539,Plus I would have tipped if I stayed anyway so its not like Im going to miss the money.
12540,And there goes Manhattan
12541,"in my country, Seychelles, we have had 140 plus cases, all imported, no community transmission, but zero death from covid."
12542,But we have had the regular amount of death from diseases such as leptospirosis and cancer as well as having two elder family members die from Pneumonia.
12543,Their death was as painful as I am sure death from covid were for the families.
12544,Let not minimize other diseases just because Covid is the new kid on the block.
12545,That is a dangerous thing which has already caused a number of unnecessary death in a number of countries due to delayed treatments.
12546,"There should be more testing, sure."
12547,"I think a goal of 2-3 percent is reasonable, comparable to other countries doing reasonably well"
12548,"WI has a Dem Governor, who right before he took office, the Republican state legislature stripped nearly all powers from, and was signed into law in the last days of the departing republican governor."

12579,"Like we'd won, or something."
12580,I agree.
12581,Lockdowns are for an out of control peak of a pandemic.
12582,Which is why they were instituted in March and have been lifted since June

12726,"&gt;China is participating in a [World Health Organization](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0751538D:SW)\-backed vaccine effort, stepping in to fill a void in global health leadership created by the Trump administration."
12727,"&gt;  
&gt;Beijing  on Thursday joined the $18 billion Covax initiative that aspires to  give lower-income countries the same access to vaccines as wealthier  nations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said."
12728,"Details of China’s  commitment, including its amount of funding, weren’t immediately  disclosed."
12729,"&gt;  
&gt;“Even when China is leading the world with several vaccines  in advanced stages of R&amp;D and with ample production capacity, it  still decided to join Covax,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a  statement Friday."
12730,"“We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable  distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support Covax.”  
&gt;  
&gt;.....  
&gt;  
&gt;China’s participation is a big win for Covax, as the possibility of  providing doses to even a fraction of China’s 1.4 billion people would  boost critical mass, enhancing the alliance’s negotiating power."
12731,"&gt;  
&gt;Covax  is led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the  vaccine alliance Gavi."
12732,"It currently has nine vaccines in development and  nine under evaluation in its portfolio, with a goal to secure 2 billion  doses by 2021...... China has been a front-runner in developing vaccines against the  coronavirus."
12733,"Nine of China’s vaccine candidates have entered clinical  trials, and four of them got approval for final stage Phase III clinical  trials in foreign countries."

12860,2984 tested deaths.
12861,Any better way to estimate total deaths?
12862,"Illinois has had [12,600 excess deaths through Sep 12](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html), corresponding to infections of about 3 weeks earlier."
12863,By comparison there have been 8744 tested deaths through September 23 (11 days is what Sweden says its reporting delay is; nobody else tracks this).
12864,So we might estimate actual deaths are 40% higher than tested deaths - about the same as is seen nationwide.
12865,But it's also not clear that Sep 23 is the correct day to be looking at.
12866,"We would want to subtract off ~10 days from the time the blood samples were taken (time from infection to seroconversion), then add on ~21 days (time from infection to death)."
12867,Then another ~11 days (time from death to reporting) if using reported deaths instead of excess mortality.
12868,"And then, of course, there's the possibility that this 20% may not represent the full population."
12869,As you say the level of detectable antibodies from an infection in march may be below the cutoff even of this test - the most likely scenario.
12870,But it also could go the other way and the tested population has a higher prevalence than the rest of the population.
12871,"Anyway, assuming +40% from tested deaths to actual deaths gives 0.7%, the exact same number the dialysis study came up with nationwide (but in that case, almost certainly by coincidence, since it gave huge variation by state)."
12872,Sad but true
12873,"Which i did, by linking directly to Obama's own words."
12874,I got that.
12875,"Utah County has more cases, woop de doo."
12876,Salt Lake is still crushing Utah County in per capita deaths and per capita hospitalizations.
12877,"Honestly I don't think cases is a great metric because it has to a lot to do with testing, etc."
12878,"(also it isn't necessarily bad to have high cases, as long as it does not turn into too high of hospitalizations and deaths, it builds herd immunity with little cost)."
12879,"So even ignoring the unverifiable slander, Utah County is doing much better than Salt Lake County."
12880,"And still I see masks lots of places in Utah, but not in downtown salt lake in the bars and clubs."
12881,Those are not those anti-science facebook reading yokals.
12882,"Unfortunately not :(

Today will be 6000 to 7000 new cases and tests come 31 % positive (that’s extremely high, signalizing that real number of infected is way higher)."
12883,"Obviously a virus is going to spread regardless which is why it was ""two weeks to flatten the curve"" so hospitals don't get over run."
12884,"But now that we know who is at risk, we should encourage young and healthy people to live their lives as normal as possible."
12885,"The sooner it runs through them, the sooner we can reach herd immunity and actually keep the vulnerable population safer moving forward."
12886,"Waiting another year or two at the expense of people's livelihoods such as education, networking, career opportunities, mental and physical well being for a vaccine that may or may not work isn't the best strategy."

12933,Russia had government officials on TV denying that COVID-19 can spread person-to-person in April.
12934,Yes you read that right.
12935,They were still didn't believe Covid was transmissible as late as APRIL.
12936,Good on Russia for setting new record.
12937,Don't tell me this.

12939,Maybe they should do something about it instead of setting themselves on fire.
12940,&gt; and we could be like New Zealand right now.
12941,There is absolutely no way we could ever be like New Zealand right now for a number of different reasons.
12942,That's 1993 numbers.
12943,"Currently, the life expectancy is at 68 and 78 for men and women, respectively."
12944,"While alcoholism is still a huge problem, the alcohol consumption has decreased almost by half in the last 20 years."
12945,And there's also a long-lasting trend of spirits (mostly vodka) being replaced with beer.
12946,Who was saying that and why would you trust blindly reddit experts?
12947,The authorities in Sweden have certainly not said either of those things.
12948,If anything - they spent August when the numbers were at almost lowest to warn them of the increase coming in autumn and prepare for local restrictions and outbreaks.
12949,Thanks.

12965,"One could argue that it's not the absolute number that's worrying, it's the trend of the numbers."
12966,"For instance, in Belgium today the weekly average is 70% higher than the previous week."
12967,"That's not a percentage you want to see for a virus that spreads exponentially... 

For the moment, we're okay hospitalisation wise, which is the more important metric (50% of covid capacity, we can go over 100%, but at the expense of regular care), but that lags, so steep rises in infections are bad news regardless of the number of infections in March"

12976,Just take a second to read what you wrote.
12977,"You're celebrating one of their accomplishments, which causes perfectly healthy people to suffer from the vaccine induced strain of polio."
12978,Same foundation is pushing for the vaccination of 7 billion people with a vaccine which will have been produced within a much shorter timeframe.
12979,If we can't get a polio vaccine that doesn't cause extremely serious side effects - perhaps we should stop downvoting people to oblivion just for sounding a critical or cautious point?
12980,I hate that the general public is treated like morons.
12981,We have Fauci saying he has celebs ready to help influence us to take the vaccine because it would be too ridiculous to treat us like adults... how about Gates spends the millions he does on influencing people to take vaccines into broadcasts on the vaccine efforts.
12982,"Get scientists to explain why their findings on the virus are changing (kids don't spread it, they do, masks work, they don't, it survives on surfaces for 4 days, it doesn't etc)."
12983,Pit the experts for either side against each other.
12984,"Even if the general public doesn't understand the exact science, they'll be able to spot a bullshitter from a mile away at least... and you'll actually give people a reason to believe in the scientific process of arriving at a conclusions instead of blindly following ""narrative backed science""

and maybe that's why they don't do it."

12989,"Yes the crowds are way down from before, but due to social distancing on rides and lines, wait times are not much lower than usual for most rides and there is no fast pass."
12990,Also the lines spill out into the walkways now so there are definitely places that I don’t even feel safe.
12991,Do not come.
12992,It’s not worth it.
12993,It’s relatively safe for the most part but still not worth it if you’re not a local AP holder.
12994,"And many have cancelled their APs because we can’t even get reservations unless it’s weeks in advance, so the pass is extremely devalued."
12995,"And with half the restaurants and food carts closed, finding a place to eat without a reservation is a nightmare."
12996,"Not to mention the extremely reduced hours, so even though lines might be a bit shorter you still can’t get as much done."

13021,It is important to remember that prior to the start of June only severe cases were being tested and when the testing got opened to mild cases too there was a surge for few weeks as a lot of people got tested at once.
13022,"The high numbers from earlier were only severe cases and health and care staff getting tested, while there were many people that were just staying home self-isolating with mild symptoms and being unconfirmed."

13250,"Reminds me of the ""global warming isn't real"" site that had ""scientists"" signing it."
13251,"It also is a strong man argument: 

&gt;Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed."
13252,No one is saying to lock down until there is a vaccine except for people like you and other anti-lockdown people.
13253,"The lockdown is to get the virus to a manageable level, not to wait for a vaccine."
13254,If done right the lock down would have been less than a month back in April.
13255,I can't believe you linked to an organization who's entire argument is a strawman argument.
13256,There's also not a single shred of evidence in there about the lockdown doing more harm then good.
13257,"Generally when someone asks for a source, they're asking for a study or something empirical, not an opinion piece that thinks that ""staying home when sick"" will protect us from a virus that spreads primarily through people with no symptoms."
13258,"Lol, what are they the ones who dump the fake ballots in the voting box?"
13259,I feel the Trumpist anti-mask ideas are a contagion that clouds thinking of people everywhere.
13260,I was always under the impression that lockdowns were not in fact about saving lives but in slowing the assault on Health Systems so those do not collapse which would then in turn save lives in the long run due to better care.
13261,Try to read maybe you'll learn something.
13262,"I am from Italy too, and I travel a lot, everyone wears masks in Italy."
13263,"This is how the virus works everywhere, mask are not sufficient."

13282,"I've just been to the 'market, out of 100-150 people there maybe 5 wore masks outside of the cashiers."
13283,"Before that I rode the metro from my office back home, while more people wore masks (they are sometimes checked for on entrance), 95% of them ""wore"" it in the chin diaper style, and a good half of the others wore them improperly (not covering the nose, loose fit, etc)."
13284,"And it was only about half of the passengers who had a mask at all, while it was all densely packed and of course no social distancing was physically possible."
13285,People just don't give two fucks and honestly neither would I if they only endangered themselves by their idiocy.
13286,"Unfortunately as it is often the case with idiots, they tend to kill more innocent bystanders than themselves."
13287,Gives time for vaccine if possible and keeps hospitals from overflowing.
13288,But here if people don't see patients in parking lots all must be well.

13339,I asked him if he had a mask and he dismissively replied that he was exempt.
13340,So my manager asked him again and he doubled down so he was asked to leave.

13356,The best way to know the true toll of an epidemic or pandemic is to look at excess mortality; and the picture here in the United States is grim.
13357,"All indications are that we are already at 300,000+ Covid related deaths here in the states."
13358,Okay but I could have taken this same chart two data points earlier and said that the initial wave was just a freak spike and that we've now settled to somewhere close to the same deaths per week as the flu.
13359,"Obviously it's still not great but we're clearly not at a steady state yet, for all we know this could dip lower and lower with each peak/valley, which seems like a positive way to look at things."
13360,This article only addresses half of it.
13361,The CDC table splits out the data from preexisting conditions and the things that covid causes that leads to death.
13362,Why those reported in the same table is just dumb.
13363,So it’s not that  6% of deaths had no comorbidities.

13518,It really does sound like they are pushing people to wear masks forever.
13519,"If people actually went along with this, it wouldn't be a couple of years like she's suggesting."
13520,It would be forever.
13521,"As you got closer to those two years, people would be saying ""well, we're just wearing these now."""
13522,That's exactly what happened with the restrictions put in place after 9/11.
13523,It's happening now with the pandemic.
13524,Everyone who was scared about losing their job or not being able to hang out with friends was told to suck it up and wait for a vaccine.
13525,"Well, now that a vaccine is on the horizon you have experts pushing the goal-posts even further with statements like these."
13526,These experts and politicians really ought not wonder why people are increasingly refusing to listen to them.
13527,You can only jerk people around for so long before they get sick of it.
13528,The problem is that there is a social cost to mask wearing.
13529,It's harder to empathize with someone wearing a mask.

13531,"You can say it's not a big deal to wear a mask until you're blue in the face, but to me and a lot of other people it is."
13532,I wear a mask and am generally pro-mask but it's really frustrating to me that pro-maskers literally feed into the anti-mask narrative and refuse to understand why anyone wouldn't want to keep wearing one for the rest of their life.
13533,HAAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.

13697,"Some public health officials suggest part of the change in mortality rates is partly a mathematical trick: The more people we test, the larger the denominator of positive cases and the lower the mortality rate."
13698,"At the peak of Spain’s epidemic earlier this year, for example, Cantón said, he was doing 500 PCR tests a day, but now it’s more than five times that."

13700,"“But this is because we are doing more diagnosis.”

Rinesh Parmar, an intensive care doctor who heads the United Kingdom’s Doctors’ Association, agreed: “The amount in the community was grossly underestimated."
13701,"We were undertesting.”

Epidemiologists also look closely at deaths per 100,000 people in the population."
13702,"Because that rate is less dependent on the wild variations in testing capacity, it can be a useful number to compare regions or nations."
13703,"To put these numbers into context, the infection fatality rate for the flu, Adalja said, is about 0.1 percent, making the coronavirus about six times more deadly."
13704,"“I think people don’t realize a small percentage of a big number is still a very big number,” he said."
13705,"Sixty-five hundredths of the U.S. population of roughly 330 million, he pointed out, is 2.145 million — or 2.145 million potential deaths."
13706,"Two waves
The earliest reports of a less-deadly coronavirus came on May 31 and drew widespread skepticism."
13707,"Alberto Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, which had been the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak, and Matteo Bassetti, from a hospital in Genoa, conjectured that the virus was weakening."
13708,"Zangrillo provided the first evidence that viral loads might be linked, stating that in the previous 10 days, nasal swabs taken at his hospital in Milan detected “absolutely infinitesimal” amounts of the virus as compared with the previous two months."
13709,The claims were quickly denounced by public health officials who said there was no evidence of any change in the virus’s lethality.
13710,"But over time, to some scientists’ surprise, the data has borne out the falling mortality rates and decreased viral load."
13711,"An Aug. 13 letter published in JAMA by doctors at Houston Methodist, which operates eight hospitals, reported huge differences between what they called surge 1 and surge 2 patients."
13712,"In surge 2, which took place from May 16 to July 7, a smaller proportion of patients required intensive care (20 percent), as compared with those seen earlier, from March 13 to May 15, during surge 1 (38 percent)."
13713,They spent less time in the hospital (4.8 days versus 7.1 days).
13714,"Most importantly, the later patients were much less likely to die — 5.1 percent versus 12.1 percent."
13715,A broad analysis of 53 countries and regions with the highest coronavirus death rates identified similar trends.
13716,"Published in September in Transboundary and Emerging Diseases by a group of American and Chinese researchers, the report found that 80 percent of countries and regions estimated lower case fatality rates in the disease’s second wave."
13717,"The paper cited numerous possibilities for what might be driving the shift, including that the most vulnerable had already been infected and died in the first wave."
13718,"Other theories involved better preparedness, the younger ages of those infected and more favorable environmental conditions, including warmer weather."
13719,"“Current evidence remains limited to suggest which of the above hypotheses is more plausible,” the authors wrote."
13720,"However, they said the classical epidemiological triangle model, which states that “the interactions of the host, pathogen and environment determine the characteristics of outbreaks, rather than one or two factors alone,” likely holds true for the coronavirus."
13721,Viral loads have been one of the most mystifying aspects of the virus.
13722,"The now widely available nasal swabs, or PCR tests, give a simple binary yes or no answer about the presence of the virus."
13723,But scientists have recently made new discoveries about the importance of the quantity of virus people carry.
13724,"When it comes to infectivity, scientists generally believe a negative PCR test, which indicates what is basically a viral load of zero, means you can’t transmit it."
13725,This is why the CDC originally recommended two negative tests 72 hours apart before people came out of self-isolation.
13726,"A high viral load, on the other hand, is believed to mean higher infectivity."
13727,There’s less certainty about how viral load relates to the patient’s own clinical course.
13728,Previous studies on influenza tell us that higher viral loads in hospitalized patients are generally not associated with worse outcomes.
13729,"In contrast, for patients with MERS or SARS — the other severe coronaviruses — higher viral load was an independent risk factor for mortality."
13730,"The new Italian viral load study seems to support that link for the novel coronavirus, too."
13731,"It found that in 373 patients seen in the emergency room in the city of Negrar in northern Italy, viral load declined from March through May, corresponding with a sharp drop in intensive care admissions over those months, down to zero in May."
13732,"In a presentation to other scientists in Europe last month, Piubelli, a researcher at Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria Hospital, surmised that “lockdown measures had an impact not only in the absolute number of infected people but also on the severity of clinical manifestations.”

El Zein’s study found more direct evidence that high viral load appears correlated with increased mortality."
13733,"But the findings are considered preliminary because the team is still analyzing possible confounding factors, such as differing treatments, to see if the relationship holds."
13734,"In the first week of the study, about 25 percent of the viral loads were high, half were intermediate and 25 percent were low."
13735,"By the fifth week, about 12 percent had high viral loads, and in the sixth week, no patients had high viral loads."
13736,"The death rate of patients in the high viral load group was 45 percent, compared with 32 percent of those in the intermediate group and 14 percent in the low group."
13737,"El Zein said the relationship was so striking that he went back to the lab to check, double-check and then triple-check equipment, and to try to figure out whether anything had changed with the procedures for collecting samples, but found no differences."
13738,"“It definitely wasn’t by chance or by mistake those numbers are going down,” he said."
13739,"One puzzling thing, he noted, is that some studies have shown that children with high viral loads appear to be completely asymptomatic, although those levels correlate with those of adults in intensive care."
13740,"Separately, the new coronavirus mutation becoming dominant in the world has been associated with higher viral loads in at least one study."
13741,El Zein has been stumped about how to reconcile that with his analysis and others of lower viral loads among recent patients.
13742,"As cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States and Europe have ticked upward in recent weeks — albeit with a lower proportion of deaths than in the past — some health officials have expressed concern that they will be overwhelmed by a slower but more sustained second wave."
13743,"If the virus spreads back to older people, as many fear is inevitable, death rates may rocket back upward."
13744,"Even in Germany, considered a model for coronavirus control and which stood out this spring as an anomaly with a low case fatality rate of less than 0.5 percent, Health Minister Jens Spahn warned the rate would likely rise."
13745,"Already, there are 470 patients in intensive care, double the number of a month ago, he said."
13746,"“People think that the virus isn’t as serious because we got through the summer well,” he said."
13747,“But that’s a false conclusion.
13748,"It was because we took preventive measures that we did well.”

Spahn blamed the increase on a lax attitude among the younger population that “want to party, to travel, and think of themselves as invulnerable.”

Across the rest of the world, alarmed governments are scrambling to bring back restrictions that haven’t been in place since spring: Paris has closed its bars, Madrid has ordered residents not to leave the city, and Moscow has told companies to make sure at least 30 percent of their employees are working remotely starting next week."
13749,"In New York on Tuesday, about 100 public schools were ordered closed in neighborhoods that have seen a resurgence of the virus."
13750,"“It’s a matter of time before we see a rise,” said Steven Van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at Sciensano, Belgium’s national public health institute."

13757,"Rafael Cantón, an infectious-disease specialist in Madrid, also marveled at the change."
13758,"“It’s totally different,” he said last month of the falling admissions at his medical center, noting that only 130 of 1,000 beds were full despite surging infections — a huge change from early spring when every bed was occupied."
13759,"Death rates from the novel coronavirus are lower in hot spots around the world, even as new infections accelerate in what may be the pandemic’s next wave."
13760,"Scientists are confident the change is real, but the reasons for it — and whether it will last — are a matter of intense debate."
13761,"“Is this a trend or a blip?” asked Joshua Barocas, an infectious-disease specialist at the Boston University School of Medicine."
13762,"“Nobody really knows.”

The mortality rate of the coronavirus has been a moving target since the outbreak began."
13763,Early reports out of China put it as high as 7 percent.
13764,"But that was based mostly on hospitalized patients, and by the time the wave hit the United States, epidemiologists believed it was closer to 2 to 3 percent."
13765,"Now, factoring in asymptomatic infections, as well as mild cases that might not be part of official tallies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the mortality rate at 0.65 percent."
13766,Barocas emphasized that even the lowest estimates represent the potential for millions more deaths.
13767,The United States already has the highest number of cases in the world and the most recorded deaths of any country.
13768,"Though its 330 million people represent roughly 4.25 percent of the world’s population, the country has recorded just over 20 percent of deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus."
13769,"Why it’s so difficult to calculate the coronavirus death toll
As daily coronavirus death tolls continue to increase in the U.S., here a few factors explaining the numbers."
13770,"(Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
As we enter a new phase of the pandemic, Barocas said, with much of the country experiencing colder weather amid a reopening of more workplaces and schools, it’s too soon to be confident that mortality rates won’t tick up alongside case counts, as young people spread the disease to their elders."
13771,"He called this time “a cliffhanger moment.”

Image without a caption
Public health officials cite multiple reasons for the lower death rates: They note a shift in the demographics of who is being stricken with the virus, with younger people making up the bulk of new infections."
13772,"More widespread testing is capturing a more diverse range of people and illness, and improved treatment strategies that include antivirals and steroids are saving more lives."
13773,But some researchers speculate there may be more to the story.
13774,"One prominent but still unproven theory suggested by early research is that we miscalculated humanity’s susceptibility to the coronavirus, and that a slice of the population may be partially immune, perhaps due to previous exposure to the common cold coronavirus, childhood vaccinations or something else."
13775,"The other possibility is that something important has changed in our environment — the weather, behaviors or the virus itself."
13776,"Most viruses lose their killing edge eventually, due to a lack of hosts, mutations that make them less deadly, or new treatments or vaccines."
13777,"The novel coronavirus will, too, experts say, but it’s a matter of when and how many lives are lost until then."
13778,"But most scientists doubt that’s what we are seeing now, based on genetic sequencing research."
13779,"One idea that has generated a lot of discussion recently, bolstered by two back-to-back studies — El Zein’s and another from Italy, presented in late September to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases — is that social distancing and masks are reducing the dose of virus people are receiving, resulting in less-severe illness."
13780,"As El Zein and other doctors in Detroit probed why their patients appeared to be less ill, they were startled to find that one indicator in particular changed dramatically over time: viral load."
13781,"Among 708 patients treated by early summer, the average viral load — a measure of the particles of virus in the body as measured by nasal swabs — fell almost on a weekly basis."
13782,"In most infectious diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, the higher the load, the worse the outcome."
13783,El Zein saw glimmers of hope in the findings: Could it be that the steps being taken to mitigate the coronavirus’s effects were showing success?
13784,"Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, shares that view."
13785,"If the initial viral dose — known as the “inoculum” — is lower, she theorized, people’s bodies are able to fight back more effectively."
13786,"This “likely indicates an ability to control the viral infection better, and, therefore, have less severe disease,” Gandhi said."
13787,"Measuring death
Of the many mysteries of the coronavirus, perhaps the most important to the average person is his or her risk of death."
13788,"For smallpox, it’s about 10 percent, thanks to treatments."
13789,"For Ebola, it’s about 50 percent."
13790,"For rabies, it’s almost 100 percent, making it the most lethal infectious disease on the planet."
13791,"President Trump has repeatedly talked about coronavirus mortality rates, even claiming on Fox News in July that the United States had the “number-one low-mortality rate.” Those claims are incorrect, according to the White House’s own data (fact-checkers pointed out that the chart he was looking at that day was upside down)."
13792,"But the confusion underscores how complex the subject is and how such rates can vary dramatically over time, country, region, age and other factors."
13793,"“What you are seeing is a misapplication of data and statistics that ends up being overtly false and sometimes very, very misleading,” explained Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."
13794,There are many different ways to measure deaths.
13795,"The most-cited numbers — the ones often released by hospitals — are case fatality rates, or the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases."
13796,"In contrast, the infection fatality rate is typically an estimate of deaths as a proportion of all those believed to be infected, including people who are asymptomatic or who have mild cases and may not have bothered to get tested, so they would not be counted as part of official tallies."
13797,So the former number often looks scarier than the latter.
13798,"According to a Johns Hopkins University analysis, which is updated daily, the case fatality rate in the United States was 2.8 percent as of Thursday."
13799,That compares with the CDC’s 0.65 percent estimated infection fatality rate — which includes confirmed cases plus an estimate of those who may not even know they have been exposed.
13800,"The case fatality rate in the United States is much higher than in South Korea, Taiwan and Iceland, where it has been below 2 percent, but lower than in some other hard-hit countries, such as Iran and Brazil."

13806,"N95 is great, just not the ones with valves -- see this pic for the difference: https://fastlifehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/valved_vs_non_valved_2xx.jpg"
13807,Exactly.
13808,As soon as the vaccine is available for the average Joe all restrictions need to end.
13809,It is then up to the individual to get vaccinated.
13810,"If you rely on infection rates to drop restrictions, you will just have a third of the country believing some misinformation and never getting vaccinated."
13811,"Make it available, drop all restrictions, leave it up to personal responsibility."
13812,"OR legally REQUIRE EVERY citizen to get it, under threat of imprisonment."
13813,If we wallow in the middle we won’t get anywhere
13814,"Yes, that's the point."
13815,It's not just one side.
13816,Democrats and Republicans two sides of the same coin.
13817,And networks that service them are just as shitty.
13818,"Yes, Fox is bad."
13819,But so is MSNBC.
13820,"It peddles propaganda and derangement just as much, the only difference being is that it services a different audience."
13821,Could you point out to a comment that shows lack of empathy towards Russians?
13822,"I mean, besides the joke of “those are rookie numbers,” which if anything would show more lack of empathy towards Americans, I haven’t seen one yet, but maybe I haven’t scrolled deep enough, but if that were the case, scrolling deep usually shows some weird comments."
13823,Red is sus.
13824,"The thing that stood out in the article for me as misinformation was this one:

""Swedish authorities actively discouraged people from wearing face masks,  which they said would spread panic, are often worn the wrong way, and  can provide a false sense of safety."
13825,"Some doctors who insisted on  wearing a mask at work have been reprimanded or even fired."""
13826,There's a difference between not encourage something and actively discourage something.
13827,"When FHM encourage something as in saying it's a recommendation, it has a lot of power behind it."
13828,So they don't easily recommend things.
13829,"And for the doctors being reprimanded or even fired was totally new to me, but as u/antsinthosepants pointed out."
13830,This was simply a local missunderstanding.
13831,"But the article made it sound like doctors in Sweden doesn't wear masks anymore or something, because the autorities discourage the wearing of facemasks."
13832,And that is a rather big misinformation.
13833,That would work too.
13834,Might need some immigration rules though.
13835,"Here on the west coast we are swarmed with homeless people from the south, since we take care of our poor and they arrest them."
13836,I'd love to send all these folks back to their home state.
13837,Don’t they have a vaccine?
13838,"Winnipeg started school at normal times on spet 8th.. A few schools had cases, which did not spread (yay masks in school)."
13839,One school did have one case and then 7 and then they shut down and went to full on remote learning.
13840,So far ther are 38 cases related to that one school now 1 month later.
13841,Manhattan is literally an island dude
13842,Serious question- How valid are these numbers when comparing countries?
13843,"In many countries, the tests are free and available."
13844,"In places like India, it may be free but there really isn't the infrastructure to test."
13845,"In the US you if your well off the tests a free, not so well off a doctor's visit co-pay of $25-$50, and if your poor and no insurance the doctor's visit will set you back $300 to $500- assuming you can find a doctor willing to take you in as a walk-in."

13901,"Because if you ask people, real people not alarmists on reddit, they are not concerned with the virus."
13902,"And why should they, it's highly unlikely to kill you."
13903,Restrictions are already being increased but they are not gaining traction because there is no sense of urgency and the support for it is kind of shattering.
13904,We need to be able to discuss possibilities that are not as ethical as virtue signalers want them to be.
13905,People are voting with their actions that they want to take more risk.
13906,"For example like 70% here say masks should be mandatory, yet less than 1% wears them."
13907,"If the vast majority thinks they should be worn, WHY WAIT, it's not forbidden to wear one."
13908,What they mean is they like it to be mandatory for other people.
13909,"Sorry I didn't realize it was hate when directed at Europe, and not when joining in the anti US circle jerk."
13910,I never said apocalypse.
13911,"The lag is about three weeks (if we believe the RKI numbers) and deaths have increased already, from about 5 per day to 25 per day."
13912,"I expect an increase in line with the increase in cases, in the order of ""cases double, deaths double""."
13913,And this is true so far.

13924,"New generations have less chances to build something good, due to lack of proper education (system is fell apart long ago) and lack of technological and production base in the country."

13926,"Almost everyone who are still left in Russia, doesn't give a f*ck."

13956,"That customer's an asshole, but this is also a good reminder that a system where service employee's salaries are in large part from an unregulated source and basically depend on society peer pressure, is a pretty bad system."
13957,What articles?
13958,"Trump’s leader of “Operation Warp Speed” is predicting 10 million doses available by January — not vaccinated, just available at all."
13959,That’s the optimistic view.
13960,Trump is probably getting scared of the competition.
13961,"They are still testing it and would never report any serious side effects because the Russians are liars, that is their default setting."
13962,"Alright, let's play that game."
13963,Three weeks ago daily cases in Italy were around 1400 in average.
13964,A sevenfold increase over the numbers at summer.
13965,"Since then, deaths increased, yes, they doubled from a very low number to another very low number."
13966,"Even if deaths increase four times from now just as the cases did in three weeks, we would have under 100 deaths a day, about 10% of the deaths during the last peak."
13967,Surely not something to destroy society over?
13968,Republicans are stupid and/or lack empathy.
13969,"It has nothing to do with social media and everything to do with their record, policy positions, and ways of doing business."
13970,"Don’t chide people, it makes you look silly."
13971,Okay using the NYtimes data he posted 70 deaths in over 178000 cases is .03% chance of dying.
13972,Or 99.97% likelihood of survival.
13973,It’d be interesting to see of those 70 what their health was like before they got Covid.
13974,You’re the one eating up the propaganda that this is a plague and everybody should live their life in fear.
13975,I just advocate that people do their own risk assessment and have the freedom to make their own decisions based on their risk factors.

Um... have you even been on Reddit at all this year?"
14074,Redditors have been celebrating and rejoicing about the idea of Americans dying from COVID-19 since February.
14075,Are we even reading the same things..?
14076,"When Spain and Italy were hotspots, many comments were saying, “Can’t wait for this hit the US so that all the ‘muritards get what they deserve!!!”."
14077,"When it finally hit the US, entire threads were filled with comments like, “This is what Americans deserve after bombing so many countries.” And of course the classic, “I hope Trump gets it and dies”."
14078,"There were many articles posted on Reddit claiming that the US was going to have “over 75 million people infected”, and I vividly remember seeing comments like, “Good."
14079,"I’m glad Americans will perish, fuck them!”."
14080,How did you miss all of that?
14081,No humans from any country should be perishing from this pandemic and there’s certainly some evil and hateful comments about Russians on here... but to insinuate that it’s anywhere near as bad as how Americans get criticized is just being willfully obtuse and ignorant.
14082,You have to be very blind to not notice that rhetoric that’s been coming from Redditors since March about Americans dying.

14090,I wanted to know the number if you knew it.
14091,So I asked.
14092,Not a single one of those required places is using the justice department (courts) nor police to make anything approximating lawful arrests.
14093,None.
14094,Nowhere in America are people being literally arrested for mask compliance.
14095,"It's not the law, it's a suggestion."
14096,I thought they had a vaccine?
14097,"&gt;the expected “death wave” never arrives lol

It has in literally every single outbreak we've seen."
14098,"You COVID deniers show up at the beginning stages of every outbreak touting the same nonsense, and when deaths inevitably skyrocket you slink away for a few weeks until that outbreak subsides and then you show up and just repeat the same lies."
14099,It's so predictable and so tiring.
14100,I saw the Princess Bride this way.
14101,They gave away foam swords and it had a nice neighborhood feel.
14102,"It was a bit overcrowded (since it was a free event in a small outdoor setting) and not as nice/comfortable as the nicest theater options, but it was fun and more memorable."
14103,maybe colder weather DOESNT cause more viruses to outbreak...it just looks that way and is pure coincidence because more people are inside and stuff during that time.
14104,so it causes more germs to be stuck with them?
14105,We need to stay locked down.
14106,When we reopen deaths happen.
14107,Even if the vaccine takes years we need to stay locked down to save lives.
14108,It’s really that simple.
14109,I’m a Canadian and I’m so sick of seeing posts and comments on this subreddit about how we’re handling it so much better than the states.

14119,"I'm anti-tip, but it's part of the social contract so I still tip at least 15% whenever we eat out at a restaurant."
14120,"People who do this were probably already looking for any reason to ""justify"" not giving a tip."
14121,"If it wasn't ""mask,"" it would have been some other excuse."
14122,"I just wish we got rid of the tipping culture, entirely."

14126,Yeah that lady is vibing

14128,yah.
14129,it's really a sad thing to see so many people being in utter denial anything is happening and they simply REFUSE to take any measures or stay safe.

14140,Are you familiar with the current state of bi- and multilateral trade negotiations?
14141,What Canadian leaders are now openly saying about future relationships with its (current) largest trading partner?
14142,Do you know what the TPP-11 is?
14143,Do you understand the implications for US manufacturers from the EU-Mexico trade deal?
14144,Why the EU-Japan trade deal isolates you even further?
14145,"After a few years of Trump abandoning relationships with your closest allies, you're now being systematically cut out of global multilateral negotiations."

14153,They will all come to Florida like they did last March.
14154,Out of the frying pan and into the fire...
14155,I think even people with a good grasp of stats would just believe the health authorities when they say masks dont work.
14156,"Politicians throughout Europe seem to have been seduced by the Swedish model, ie sacrifice the elderly and then convince the population that it was a shame but an accident  and people will accept the death count and treat it like an act of God rather than sacrificing Nana for some fat fucks bottom line."
14157,To this end they are deliberately giving signals to people to live as normal and then blaming fatigue or some nonsense when Nanas everywhere start dying.
14158,Really?
14159,You didn't see a significant increase in FL?
14160,That significant increase everybody was talking about just a while ago?

14163,It depends on the movie.

14166,Honestly I don’t miss the theaters.
14167,I don’t have to deal with people talking and I can pause a movie whenever I need to go to the bathroom when I’m at home.
14168,"&gt; Just because there are select individuals like you that refuse to believe the science

Show me a quote where i've denied science?"
14169,I've argued that our continued lockdowns and doubling down on mitigation techniques as a long-term plan is straddling the line of being both harmful to our economic and mental wellbeing and still resulting in virus casualties.
14170,We should pick one.
14171,&gt; Because covid is obviously causing more problems if it is more deadly.
14172,This is commen sense stuff dude.
14173,"Why are you struggling so hard?"""
14174,"COVID has killed just over 1M people annually in 10 months so clearly, it is more deadly than a virus that kills 1.5M people/year with most people not even having a second thought that it even exists."
14175,&gt; All you do is drag up debunked old articles and and spread misinformation.
14176,"Only in your world is CDC data on adolescent mortality ""debunked old articles""

&gt; So the kids are going to teach themselves and not go home to their families?"
14177,If only there was some way that we could open schools safely with at-risk teachers and staff protected.
14178,Perhaps they could zoom chat into a TV screen and teach an in-person class with help of a teachers aide?
14179,"You could also keep your sick kid away from Grandma, you know, like everyone has always done forever."
14180,"Or, IDK, do what Europe is doing."
14181,Instead we took this hysteria approach without actually listening to science.
14182,"Better just to stay indoors for another year than actually make informed choices, right?"
14183,People like you will continue to come up with excuse after excuse after excuse even when science is blatantly clear about what the clear risks are.
14184,I bet you wiped down your groceries with clorox wipes
14185,"Public health sends an email then media (or in some cases, redditors) sows panic:

“Cases increased by .04% compared to yesterday due to a backlog in testing processing”

Becomes

“CASES *SURGE* ACROSS THE HEARTLAND, TESTING FALLS BEHIND”"
14186,"Yeah watch out, Putin might ""lose"" an election lol."
14187,"No, they smashed their cases early on and that bought them a normalish summer."
14188,We never did.
14189,Now their baseline is what got us to where we are now.
14190,Your “they are just testing more” perspective is literally what has made the USA such a sh**show.
14191,We’re on freaking par with Brazil and India in terms of community spread.
14192,Prior to Covid we would consider those basically 2nd world countries and yet they are the most comparable when looking at public community spread.
14193,I'm sorry that happened to you.
14194,I feel for everyone forced to work amongst people who don't care about them.
14195,My mom works in a hair salon at a retirement home.

14203,Fox News did what old Soviet propaganda could only dream about: it turned the entire Republican Party into an openly pro-Putin organization.

There was a story several years ago of somebody dying from common cold - infection crossed the blood-brain barrier."
14217,Is it possible?
14218,Yes.

14220,"I'd say, no more than of being struck by a lightning."

14235,Uh: no.
14236,The article is about a doctor begging scofflaws in her state to adhere to the public health measures.
14237,There are parts of the country where at least a large minority resist doing so.

14250,Why are people listening to a software developer when it comes to a disease?
14251,&gt; Japan has had remarkable success at containing the coronavirus.
14252,Clearly that helped boost confidence to lift its travel ban to a dozen countries.
14253,Will other countries follow suit?
14254,"I live in Japan but anyone who thinks Japan is doing a great job is saying it blindly, as there is such a severe lack of testing."
14255,Who the fuck knows what is really going on.
14256,"For example today they tested over 5500 people in Tokyo, with a population of 9.2 million (different to Greater Tokyo)."
14257,[removed]
14258,Your argument was that it was not possible.
14259,I pointed out a lot of things people think are impossible until they happen.
14260,How is that a weak argument to your statement that it was impossible
14261,Seems nice until you realize that they just need a test sample.
14262,"Before they were saying it was obese people at higher risk, now they're adding in the overweight, which is a lower BMI and includes more people."
14263,"This is most Americans, if I'm not mistaken."

14279,"Congratulations, you've spent 6 month in lockdown to save ~0.1% of your population."
14280,It is intolerable for people who had certain things going on.
14281,I had 1 more year of university.
14282,Now it is fucking Zoom bullshit.
14283,This is intolerable.
14284,"A lot of satellites, that cost a lot of money, the money would be wasted doing mundane tasks like watching a ship at dock."
14285,"The actual spy satellites will be tasked to monitor things actually happening, that includes on land activities."

14296,I'd rather take my chances with a vaccine.
14297,"I don't know the full context of that comment, but I believe he either made a poor choice to downplay masks too much, in order to mitigate a run on masks, or he was considering the impact of people wearing masks and thus believing they didn't need to take other precautions and were protected more than masks can actually protect and thus engaging in risky behaviors."
14298,"He does recommend masks now, and there is evidence like the original post and more solid evidence as well, all around the world, showing the efficacy of masks."

14334,Well yeah
14335,the 36k deaths of covid are with the measures  of distance in place.

14341,We are sending patients to smaller hospitals that those hospitals would normally send to us.
14342,If there is much more of an influx of patients (as flu season isn't even close to being in full swing yet) we are going to have problems.

14351,You've got the second longest lockdown in the world after Argentina.
14352,That's no achievement.

14354,"In places like Australia that are coming out of their flu season, flu was [practically nonexistent this year](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/health/covid-flu-season-fall/index.html)."
14355,"&gt;Take Australia, for example."
14356,"&gt;In August 2019, there were 61,000 laboratory confirmed cases of &gt;influenza in Australia."
14357,"&gt;In August 2020, there were 107."

14359,"""We've never seen numbers like this before."""
14360,"Australia has been pretty good about the public health guidelines in general, relative to a lot of other areas, so maybe they got a better outcome on their flu season."
14361,"But I don't see how you can predict that this year's flu season is going to ""hit hard""."
14362,How could it not be the lightest flu season in living memory?
14363,"The entire world is already in ""fight respiratory disease mode"" before it even started."

14378,"**You, as true followers of Jesus,  be kind and considerate to other humans**

14379,"In most cases I’ve ever read about virus mutation follows a path of more contagious, less deadly."

14397,"Thought about the the other day, if it’s empty , while it would suck to wear a mask all day in Florida heat, is it worth going cause no one is there?"
14398,Also water is wet.
14399,It's not like all intel passes through the president to get to where it's going.
14400,Lets say our intelligence agencies became aware of an impending attack.
14401,"While clearly they'd *brief* the president, they're going to tell the military directly as well, and the military aren't going to ignore something like that even if Trump directly told them to."
14402,"Not stated here but apparently underweight is a risk too - which is relevant to East Asian countries like mine more, as something like 20-25% of women in their 20s-30s are clinically underweight where I am."
14403,It is interesting how the risk factors differ so much by society.
14404,"I don't think people are complaining about the action of putting on a mask

14410,"Yes, Trump is a horrible leader and that is being amplified during this pandemic."
14411,"His poor policies and bad leadership has undoubtedly costs 10s of thousands of lives compared to if someone more normal
was in office."
14412,You can’t hang the whole death toll on him though.
14413,"Even with the optimal
pandemic leader thetr would be 10s of thousands of deaths."
14414,"Also, that “if” is doing a lot of work for you."
14415,The chance that Trump infected his gravely ill chief of security given the timelines is vanishingly small.
14416,Sorry.
14417,Maybe you’ll be able to hang a more likely trumps fault death on him after this WH cluster runs if course.
14418,"Hopefully not, but you’d have a much stronger case and I’d be there with you."
14419,I'm baffled are people stress-baking or stress-cooking or stress-eating at all?
14420,"The anxiety and fear and depression and stress of covid makes it incredibly hard to have an appetite, and eating about the last thing I want to do these days."
14421,Ffs this isn’t an attitude problem it’s something that requires constant vigilance and sacrifice across the whole population for a huge length of time.
14422,This is delusional.
14423,Justifying the enormous pain of lockdowns by saying we should just work harder at it and it will work is like the failed Soviet collectivisation programs that looked good in theory but caused suffering for millions.
14424,Not admitting that we’re on the wrong path is Utopianist dogma.
14425,The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
14426,"My mom, dad, and soon, little brother (just got his EMT certification)."
14427,This whole pandemic makes me believe that the US is blessed with the most passionate healthcare workers in the world unfortunately toiling away in the most broken system in the developed world.
14428,Can confirm: currently having the same sort of holiday I would normally have in Bali or Thailand in Darwin instead
14429,"Damn, I for one am amazed people can eat at all right now - my reaction to the anxiety and stress spiral of covid news has been that I've completely lost my appetite and went from skinny batch to underweight batch."
14430,I'm having to force myself to eat something although I have zero motivation or will to eat.

14445,"you originally referred your comment as ""Deaths of many covid children,"" then you edited to say ""deaths of covid children,"" to later shift it to ""might be covid children,"" to ""non-covid *patients""* (who might somehow indirectly directly infect a kid and hypothetically that kid can who hypothetically has COVID.)"

14452,"I’m sorry you’re a moronic, selfish asshole, but maybe if you had any empathy at all you’d actually have friends and family to care about."
14453,But those restrictions aren’t going to work any more.
14454,That should be clear to absolutely everyone by now.
14455,Punishing everyone (ineffectively) for longer because some people won’t follow the rules is one of the cruelest and most vindictive things I’ve ever heard advocated.

14471,"Ok, I’ll rephrase."
14472,The social aspect/health crisis of the pandemic will be over when the most vulnerable are vaccinated.
14473,After that the ordinary person will never want to hear about it ever again.
14474,There’s no other way that ends unless we reach around 70% of the population infected and infection rates slow.
14475,I haven’t been maskless in public (everyone wears a mask here) but suffer bad ragweed/chamomile allergies.
14476,A couple weeks ago I started with congestion and freaked out.
14477,I also get itchy and break out in hives when the sun starts to go down...
14478,"I get tested weekly as well, but still it’s like this strange awareness now..."
14479,I mean this happens twice a year for me but for some reason I’m so self conscious.

14487,It’s been discussed here a lot.
14488,It was a computer simulation of an imaginary virus run by Johns Hopkins.
14489,What’s the solution then?
14490,What else can people believe in?
14491,Maybe Reagan was right...
14492,"I will routinely refer to this chart on the CDC website:

14493,Huh.
14494,You mean like everyone who knew a g\*damned thing was saying - shouting - for months?
14495,Well.
14496,why is this getting downvoted lol

14500,‘I can’t breathe’ is the theme of this year.
14501,We really have to get our act together in multiple areas...
14502,"&gt;If I look at the two RNA vaccines, imagine approval happens during the month of November."
14503,"We will be able to immunize the first populations that are most impacted by this virus, as of November, and then December, and then January."
14504,"Within that period of time, between November and January, we will have enough vaccines to immunize, I would say, 80 to 100 million people, which represents all the elderly people, the health care workers, the first line workers."
14505,"After that, we start to immunize the less risky populations."
14506,"If you look at it over a period of six, seven months, between November and June, we will be immunizing a very large number of people, month on month, every month, starting with the most risky, the most impacted toward the least impacted people."
14507,Bravo!
14508,But we can afford to spend a lot more on manufacturing if it'll get the job done faster.
14509,$20-25 billion in vaccine funding is stalled in Congress right now.
14510,Slaoui should light a fire under their ass if this is money he could use.

14514,More like an unstoppable idiot -- he got the 2016 Republican nomination among a large field of yahoos because his schtick is caustically mocking people.
14515,Did you read the article?
14516,Even just the very first sentence?
14517,&gt;Arizona saw a 75% drop in new coronavirus cases after the state added local mask mandates..
14518,Okay..
14519,"But then it continues..  


&gt;...(and) restrictions on public events and closures of bars, gyms, movie theaters and restaurants 

  
Im not saying masks dont work."
14520,Im saying that this is absolutely not proof that they do.
14521,This is the most unacceptable part of the whole affair.
14522,Our military cannot afford our top commanders getting sick.
14523,The way I worded it to a friend was: imagine you have an accident and you need medical treatment.
14524,Hospital A is in an ultra-wealthy country where you could potentially save your leg and your life in a risky surgery.
14525,Hospital B is in an extremely poor country where removing your leg will save your life BUT if you try to save your leg in a risky surgery you will not only lose your leg but also your life.
14526,The Western World and parts of Asia are Hospital A.
14527,They have the potential to save the leg (the economy) while still protecting lives.
14528,The rest of the world is Hospital B.
14529,If they try to do the same method as Hospital A they will fail HORRIBLY because they lack the resources and if they don't come up with a realistic solution they will f\*\*\* both the economy and their number of deaths.
14530,"Peru, Bolivia, Chile and, Ecuador (with Colombia, Argentina, and Panama joining them soon) did everything ""right"" by the book but they have horrible results because of extreme poverty + corrupt Governments + lack of public trust in their leaders are a combination for disaster."
14531,Hopefully he doesn't let it dominate him
14532,Vaccines in general
14533,&gt; That all this BS is doing far more harm than good?
14534,&gt; Show me an article that it's helping.
14535,On a thread about mask effectiveness?
14536,"Either you're gaslighting, or you're absolutely terrible at conveying your thoughts."
14537,"Covid is not harmless, my healthy 19 year old sister caught it last week and was in hospital desperately struggling to breathe."
14538,"The long term damage caused by covid won't be known for years, this is not some harmless / well-understood flu."
14539,Letting it spread and relaxing restriction will only cause it to hit us even harder later.
14540,"Until a vaccine is developed, we have to keep on top of it, period."
14541,Someone's uncle brother is going to get jealous.
14542,And the government is doing nothing.
14543,We're fucked.
14544,"The phrase still applies, unfortunately some people want to eat rats to try and spite us."
14545,Guys!
14546,I think we may be on to something here!
14547,&gt;america is actually one of the most mask compliant countries in the world.
14548,Source?
14549,"I don’t know, but in the US the correlation is there."
14550,"To be fair, there was a large portion of our population back then too that were alright with the Germans; on the east coast, there was the German American Bund, and on the west coast, there were left-wing anti-war demonstrations at Berkley in 1938 urging peace with Hitler."
14551,I thought all his symptoms were gone
14552,"shoulda got trump’s medicine, coulda felt 20 yr younger"
14553,Does he mean total or by the end of the year?
14554,The article wasn’t exactly clear on that.
14555,Get used to it.
14556,"Some famous comedian had a quote that goes something like ""the average person is dumb."
14557,"50% of people are dumber than average."""
14558,I’m gonna be honest here.
14559,The CDC fucked up hard.
14560,They gave these people an opening.
14561,They said don’t wear masks and don’t buy them.
14562,Then weeks later said the exact opposite.
14563,During a pandemic that shit can confuse and anger people.
14564,Fauci himself said not to buy masks and wear them (probably due to healthcare workers needing them more than citizens) but it still got people riled up and confused.
14565,You give these types of conspiracy theorists a foothold and they’ll climb all over you.
14566,So the link is actually the post your comments are on
14567,"&gt;Dominic Battel, a 38-year-old father of two, put off going to the hospital after feeling chest pains."
14568,It was a Sunday in April and he spent the day working on his house and playing with his kids.
14569,"His wife, Cortney, said Dominic was afraid if he went to the hospital he would catch the coronavirus...  
&gt;  
&gt;...Dominic died of a heart attack at his home."
14570,His refusal to go to the hospital has nothing to do with lockdowns or the lack thereof.
14571,"He was free to go to the hospital, but chose not to."
14572,"With fewer restrictions, California would have a larger infected population."
14573,"In that event, the hospital that he refused to visit may not have had space for him even if he had chosen to go."
14574,Including this in the article serves to prove the opposite point.
14575,I'm finding this Administration coupled with the pandemic are having this effect on many relationships.
14576,I like your user name by the way.
14577,Kudos for your efforts to reconcile even though it turns out your initial instincts were correct.
14578,You'll always know you are a more complete person for having explored the option of reconnecting.
14579,"Wait, masks DO help?"
14580,Those paid doctors were right?
14581,"Sarcasm aside, I hope the rest of the states can follow suite with a no tolerance policy like it"
14582,There are huge ethical problems with infecting people with deadly pathogens.
14583,"This is why there hasn't been any COVID challenge trials yet even with healthy, young volunteers."
14584,There's absolutely no point in your suggestion anyway.
14585,Why would you purposefully infect yourself with this virus?
14586,"If you weren't that concerned about it, you'd just take your chances in society as you have said."
14587,You get zero benefit from purposefully infecting yourself.
14588,Tell me more about this bridge
14589,Yeah I feel you.
14590,Just did a virtual game night where a friend had his girlfriend with him.
14591,"Made me realize that was the first time I'd talked to a woman not related to me, a coworker, or an employee at a store I'm at in about 7 months."
14592,"I miss meeting new women, flirting, chasing, overpriced first dates, the whole 9 yards."
14593,I sure hope Trump isn't counting on the Secret Service to help keep him in the building after he's voted out and his term ends.
14594,"For sure - I remember when this all started, feeling like Utah wasn't too bad a place to ride it out, all things considered."
14595,"Of course, that was when I believed Cox and Herbert were going to continue to like...lead or something."
14596,I was hopeful.
14597,I was wrong.
14598,This is the incoherent raving of a lunatic.
14599,Get help.
14600,"Yeah, the real number is likely 60k+ deaths at the very least."
14601,"Many hospitals all around the country collapsed at the peak of the pandemic, completely ran out of simple and ICU beds, oxygen, medicines, tests and health personnel."
14602,"It was a very dire situation, people were dying in the streets and in their homes because they couldn't get any medical attention."
14603,"On the bright side since August the number of overall weekly deaths has declined to 2019 levels in October, the number of hospitalizations has declined from 14k+ to 6.5k in the past 2 months, deaths also declined by half, the number patients in ICU has also been declining slowly but steadily since mid July."

14631,"If you believe their cases are truly at zero, then I have a bridge to sell you."
14632,"But I can't prove otherwise, because, you know...communist state media."
14633,&gt; What severe measures?
14634,NZ has had one of the laxest measures since they reopened in May.
14635,Are you kidding?
14636,They shut down Auckland again for *over a month* over a [grand total of 29 cases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-newzealand/new-zealands-ardern-extends-lockdown-to-stamp-out-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKCN2593AT).
14637,They *still* don't know where the virus came from the second time.
14638,Even a *tiny island nation with closed borders* can't keep the damned thing out!
14639,But I'm sure they won't have to do *that* again.
14640,Totally got it this time.
14641,Pinky swear!
14642,"&gt; Even during their 'lockdown' in Aug, the only restrictions they had was group size limits of 100 (and 10 for Auckland)."
14643,"Their ""Level 3"" lockdown is [about as severe as what New York did in the spring](https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/alert-level-3/
)."
14644,"Everything was closed, travel was restricted, and most people stayed home all the time."
14645,"&gt; &gt; Masks and social distancing are unfalsifiable beliefs: if cases go down, they worked, if they go up, we didn't do it hard enough."
14646,"&gt; Yeah, funny how that trend actually mirrors real life."
14647,"In the sense that people tend to believe in superstitions and vengeful gods, and that wearing things over our faces will protect us from evil vapors?"
14648,"[Yes, it does](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/reference/european-history/plague-doctors-beaked-masks-coronavirus/)."
14649,But we don't live in the dark ages anymore.
14650,We rely on evidence to make decisions.
14651,OR at least...we did before 2020.
14652,"(oh, and *by the way?"
14653,* New Zealand didn't require chin diapers anywhere other than public transit.
14654,Guess they didn't know about **The Science (tm)**).
14655,"&gt; You do realize they've limited the maximum number of diners to 50 and mandated that tables be sat at least 1m apart, right?"
14656,Or that those places are forced to closed if they violate those guidelines?
14657,What do you think those are if not social distancing rules?
14658,"Yeah, [it sure looks like hell over there](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-strategy.html)."
14659,They're obivously [all completely miserable](https://news.yahoo.com/joy-freedom-why-now-finally-131723002.html).

14661,&gt; No idea why there are always posters like yourself peddling such false narratives.
14662,Will you respond to defend your misinformation?
14663,Doubtful.
14664,"Yeah, people like me, with our pesky *sources* and *facts*, spreading all of our scary propaganda."
14665,"We're the worst, right?"
14666,"At least the Packers basically said ""no fans allowed until you guys get your damn act together"""
14667,Flagstaff checking in.
14668,You can tell who is from PHX on the weekends based on mask use.
14669,We saw a pretty bad spike from Labor Day despite local mask mandates.
14670,[deleted]
14671,Why would someone in on the conspiracy call it the new world order?
14672,I too judge small portions of the population that the media loves to focus on and get people clicking to get angry about when talking about entire populations.
14673,Americans compliance with masks is greater than most of the Nordic countries.
14674,"If he's scared, he can always crawl back in his shell!"
14675,They lied.
14676,[removed]
14677,Same fucking thing.
14678,I also don’t support chick fil a either.

14682,*shocked pikachu*

14684,"When nothing is open, what else is left to do but sit at home?"
14685,The fires in California kept people inside even more than usual.
14686,The science says that people get sicker when they inhale more viral particles.
14687,It follows that those with more serious symptoms are likely more infectious.
14688,So this person is a definite candidate.
14689,"Also of note, more severe cases are more likely to be passed from someone you live with as a result of the confined space and the volume of viral particles in the air in that environment."
14690,I thought that’s what you conservatives always preach.
14691,Don’t like a business?
14692,Shop somewhere else!
14693,So now that’s not true because I choose to not support a trump supporting store?
14694,Some major “Get Out” vibes
14695,....are green apples sick?
14696,Arizona resident here.
14697,I think the Arizona model is actually a great one to look at for how to fight an outbreak.
14698,Holding up Arizona as an example was one of the only actions by this administration that I've actually agreed with in this whole crisis.
14699,"I'm not saying the whole covid response in Arizona was good - in fact it was clearly a disaster in the first half or so, leading to one of the worst outbreaks in the world."
14700,"In fact, even the successful response to that outbreak was really not great, but I think that's what makes it so important to observe."
14701,Arizona did NOT take any world-shattering actions to fight this virus.
14702,"In early July, we had become the single worst hotspot for covid on the face of the planet."
14703,"4-6 weeks later, we were basically back down to pre-surge levels."
14704,A massive success.
14705,And what did we do?
14706,"Really, really not much."
14707,We closed gyms and bars for a couple of months and got mask compliance up from like 10% to maybe 70%.
14708,That's it.
14709,We didn't lock down.
14710,We didn't fine or jail people.
14711,We didn't close all our businesses.
14712,We didn't shelter in place.
14713,We did none of that.
14714,"Debatably gyms never even needed to close either, since as far as I know no one's ever actually put together any evidence that gyms are particularly problematic."
14715,"I guess these days you would maybe need to close school downs as well, obviously we didn't have the school problem in July-August so it's tough to make a call on that."
14716,The reason it's such an important example to look at is because it shows just how easy it actually is to control this virus.
14717,You don't need to wreck your economy and ruin millions of lives.
14718,You don't need to destroy everyone's mental health and cause protests and unrest.
14719,"Literally just close your fucking bars for a month or two and mandate/enforce masks in businesses, and you can go from the #1 hotspot in the world to totally under control in a matter of weeks."
14720,It's SERIOUSLY not hard.
14721,I think the point they are trying to make is that people are too afraid to do that because of widespread closures and the implication that going out is too risky.
14722,"AFAIK the 10% figure comes from their averages on worldwide antibody testing, which seems to be significantly higher than the known or estimated positive cases."
14723,"If you look at the positive cases/deaths now, vs positive cases/deaths in April, we must have had a magnitude higher level of cases to generate those death, unless it only managed to hit susceptible people (which seems unlikely), or has become less deadly (also unlikely)"
14724,Not really.
14725,When I make my trips I always plan on visiting more than one place so it’s not a total waste.
14726,This isn't the first case.
14727,Weve seen a few cases of cats getting the virus in the uk (don't know about other animals though).
14728,Sad.
14729,rip kitty
14730,Covid units are generally separated completely.
14731,They’re not  put in the regular ICU (or they are in the regular ICU but the non Covid UCU patients are then moved to a new unit) but have created a Covid ICU with sealed rooms.
14732,"In NYC when we were overrun, some hospitals were having to duct tape plastic sheeting from ceiling to floor and Walton wall to seal it off."
14733,Hopefully nothing like that has to happen again in the developed world but it is a (very very last resort) option if there are no others.
14734,Fake news
14735,"As an expat son of florida i can assure you, what doesn't kill florida will only make it stronger."
14736,"Pretty interesting you guys approve of posts like this but censor Barrington report signed by 25,000 scientists."
14737,"Republicans/Conservatives are scum

14867,They aren’t stupid.
14868,They’re guiding his body to recovery.
14869,It’s completely nonsense continuing to cling desperately to this idea that he’s just having a temporary lull and an impending crash is around the corner.
14870,Even if you believe he wasn’t positive until last Friday (there’s no way that’s the case.
14871,"Symptoms start 2-14, 5 on average days after infection) he’s already at the next Friday, that’s 7 days after symptoms onset."
14872,With no viral load.
14873,The virus has run its course now.
14874,"His physician stated as fact, “we have no doubt the President is going to recover.”  You don’t say something like that, as a Doctor, without concrete proof."

14958,*
14959,"Animal minds: Not just a pretty face

MOST people dismiss fish as dim-witted pea-brains that spend all day swimming around doing…well, nothing."
14960,"Worse still, others believe that, like Dory in the film Finding Nemo, fish have a 3-second memory span and are doomed to perpetually rediscover the joys of their fish tank or goldfish bowl."
14961,And as for culture or social engagement – forget it.
14962,Yet this is a great fallacy.
14963,Fish are more intelligent than they appear.
14964,"In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of “higher” vertebrates, including non-human primates."
14965,"Best of all, given the central place memory plays in intelligence and social structures, fish not only recognise individuals but can also keep track of complex social relationships."
14966,The widespread notion of fish as stupid is partially grounded in a traditional reading of evolution.
14967,"According to this, fish are the most primitive vertebrates and evolution has progressed by gradual linear gradients, from fish through amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and primates to humans."
14968,"The “higher” the species, the more complex its brain structure, intelligence and behaviour."
14969,Because the more primitive vertebrates have relatively simple neural circuits their behaviour is primarily automated or innate.
14970,"At the other end of the scale, humans have sophisticated neural circuits and are capable of performing complex cognitive tasks."
14971,"But perhaps there is another, deeper reason for our prejudice against fish."
14972,Humans have lived side-by-side with many terrestrial creatures for millennia.
14973,We have shared their environment and bonded with them as we domesticated them.
14974,"We think we understand what dogs, cats and horses see, feel and think, and that positive emotional response has developed into empathy."
14975,"Fish, on the other hand, are cold and slimy."
14976,They live in a world biologists have only started to understand.
14977,"Scuba gear was not widely available until the 1960s, and even today few people have experienced life underwater."
14978,How can we hope to relate to fish if we haven’t the faintest idea what their world is like?
14979,"Having spent over a decade studying fish, I feel I must champion their cause."
14980,Here are the facts.
14981,"Fish have existed for more than 400 million years, they inhabit every imaginable aquatic niche, and show a diversity unparalleled in any other vertebrate group."
14982,"There are 28,500 known fish species, more species than all other vertebrates combined."
14983,There has been ample time for fish to evolve complex and diverse behaviours as befits their multiplicity of lifestyles – plus the cognitive hardware to go with them.
14984,"Rather than viewing evolution as a linear progression of increasing complexity, modern evolutionary theory views the various vertebrate lineages as highly diverse groups in all their forms and specialisations."
14985,"All groups occupy more or less parallel lines of evolution, radiating from a common ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago."
14986,"Rather than highlighting differences, comparative psychologists, behavioural ecologists and neuroscientists are increasingly uncovering a huge degree of similarity between the groups."
14987,"Over the past 10 years, the number of research papers on fish has increased dramatically."
14988,"Just over a decade ago James Kieffer and Patrick Colgan from Queen’s University, Ontario, reviewed learning and memory in fishes in a single short manuscript (Reviews In Fish Biology And Fisheries, vol 2, p 125)."
14989,They were able to cite some 70 papers.
14990,"A recent issue of Fish and Fisheries (September 2003) was devoted to learning, and cited well over 500 research papers."
14991,"The introductory chapter described fish as “steeped in social intelligence, pursuing Machiavellian strategies of manipulation, punishment and reconciliation…exhibiting stable cultural traditions and cooperating to inspect predators and catch food”."
14992,That’s just for starters.
14993,"Recent research has uncovered fish species that use tools, build houses and, above all, have an impressive ability for long-term memory."
14994,"This allows them to maintain complex social relationships, and even gather information by eavesdropping on others."
14995,"For example, species of fish that search for prey by emitting pulses of electricity can home in on the successful foraging pulses emitted by other individuals and snaffle their prey."
14996,"The structure of the fish brain is varied and rather different from ours, yet it functions in a very similar way."
14997,"In 2001, I published an article in Animal Cognition (vol 4, p 109) discussing long-term memory in the Australian freshwater rainbowfish."
14998,The fish were trained to locate a hole in a net as it approached down the length of a fish tank.
14999,"After five attempts, they could reliably find the hole in the net."
15000,"About 11 months later they were re-tested and their ability to escape was undiminished, even though they had not seen the apparatus during the intervening period."
15001,Not bad for a fish that only lives two to three years in the wild.
15002,"In a series of other experiments, my colleagues and I have shown that larger groups learn to avoid the net faster than smaller groups because fish in a shoal learn by observing one another."
15003,Social learning opens the door for the transfer of information between individuals and from generation to generation.
15004,This cultural transmission can lead to the development of stable cultural traits.
15005,"For instance, several species of coral reef fish have “preferred” migration paths between feeding and resting sites that have been shown to be culturally transmitted."
15006,Clearly fish also rely on memory to keep track of social structures.
15007,"For example, when a fish watches two others having a fight, it not only gathers information about the contestants’ social ranks but it also establishes its own rank relative to the combatants."
15008,Many of the components of these aggressive displays can also be used to attract females.
15009,"If two male Siamese fighting fish are fighting, their displays contain many more aggressive elements, like nips and chases, but if a female is watching, the lads alter the repertoire and make it a bit more sexy."
15010,Many fish build nests for rearing young just as birds do; others have permanent burrows or preferred hiding spots.
15011,"But how do you cope if you are constantly on the move, looking for food?"
15012,Rock-moving wrasse build new homes every night by collecting bits of rubble off the seafloor.
15013,Once construction is complete the wrasse settles down to sleep and abandons the dwelling the next morning.
15014,Other fish use tools for foraging.
15015,"Archerfish fire spurts of water to dislodge insects, while other species crush sea urchins with rocks."
15016,Some grazing fish tend well-kept gardens where they constantly remove unwanted algae and encourage the growth of “tasty” species.
15017,"Some fish, however, have to turn to less reliable relationships for their food supply."
15018,Cleaner wrasse eat dead bits of skin and parasites from the bodies of other fish.
15019,"If the wrasse nips its client’s skin, the client will leave and find another, more careful cleaner."
15020,It is in the wrasse’s best interest to entice a client back to its cleaning station.
15021,How does it do this?
15022,A nice back rub seems to do the trick.
15023,It is clear that fish visiting these cleaning stations keep track of where the best stations are.
15024,"And there are many other studies showing that fish have a fantastic spatial memory, equal in all respects to any other vertebrate."
15025,"They can, for instance, form cognitive maps which they use to take short cuts from one location to another, navigating via cues such as polarised light, the electromagnetic field, sounds and smells, and visual beacons and other landmarks."
15026,"Despite all these amazing feats, fish biologists have a long way to go before we convince the public that fish are intelligent."
15027,"First, we must impress upon scientists a modern view of evolution."
15028,Then we must reverse hundreds of years of prejudice.
15029,"Fish may seem quite pathetic when they are flopping around on the deck of a boat, but get down into their world and you’ll soon realise that they are remarkable creatures."

15043,Did worldmeters change the time the day resets?
15044,I notice it's still going on at this time when they typically resets by now.
15045,The group that made that prediction was the IHME who hasn’t gotten any of their predictions right the whole time.
15046,Not surprised.
15047,Gov here is doing absolutely nothing except wait-and-see and put up some half-assed rules that are completely ineffective.
15048,"At the same time they're still spreading misinformation that was debunked back in March-April, and even *lowering* measures such as fines despite our numbers going up explosively every day."
15049,"At this point we can't trust our leaders anymore since they clearly don't have our best interests at heart but instead their next election, so all we can do is the best we can as individuals."
15050,"It's a really sad state and I truly expected better from a country known for its ""levelheaded"" people, but instead we are right up there with the worst reality-denying scumbags."
15051,"NL is just about the only developed country in the world that is still bleating how children are literally immune despite every evidence, including our own, has shown otherwise, and how masks don't work or aren't worth it."
15052,I just wish the people in charge would be held responsible for this kind of incompetence/sabotage.
15053,Lol try living literally anywhere in the South
15054,"The 56,000+ new US cases today is the most new cases in a single day since Aug 14."
15055,I doubt closures had anything to do with it but the masks for sure.
15056,I've been to Arizona plenty of times during the pandemic and it's been balls out with businesses open well before they did the mask mandate.
15057,Ya I agree but why is it following the same pattern the flu does?
15058,At first it was to wear the mask to protect other people.
15059,Now it is wear the mask to make them feel ok?
15060,Since when got their feelings more important than my freedom?
15061,fewer*
15062,"Oh, I agree completely!"
15063,This is just.... beyond next level.
15064,Even next NEXT level.
15065,I’m anxious for this election outcome
15066,Yes.
15067,"It's taking the argument to the extreme, but it's a useful tool for discussing ethical problems, especially in science."
15068,"There are some situations where we override the sacrosanctity of the body (Autopsies), there's a line where some people feel uncomfortable and some are fine (organ donation without family approval, donation of the body to research), and there's a point where 99% of us say no, the little good that may come out isn't worth the violation (Harvey the Corpse Fucker)."
15069,"This is an important discussion to have in biology, as historically the pursuit of knowledge has been deemed more important than a person's agency."
15070,"Henrietta Lacks is the classic example, are the millions of discoveries that have been made from her tissue worth her not giving informed consent for her tissue biopsies to be used in such a way."
15071,"I don't think you're basing that on current numbers, how'd you get 1 mil?"
15072,I live in Utah right now; it’s crazy what people believe here.
15073,"I can’t stand it when I meet someone who seems educated and rational, but as soon as a conversation mentions anything religious or political (for some reason wearing a mask is political here???"
15074,I’m so confused) they turn into a different person entirely.
15075,They suddenly refuse to listen to reason or science because the world is out to get them; they won’t hear anything that contradicts what they already “know”.
15076,"I live in Utah so I don’t want to generalize and say that all Utahns are trash, but it’s not surprising to me that no one takes COVID seriously here."
15077,"I’d say a solid 50% (at least) of people I’ve met here are either part of an MLM, or are an anti-vaxxer, or are just judgmental religious zealots."
15078,Yea and forces you to breathe it back in MAKING YOU SICK dumb dumb... /s
15079,I never claimed that?
15080,"Please, check the transcripts."
15081,At MOST I said 10x.
15082,26x if we are talking about only the most recent Influenza season.
15083,Even then I was only ever talking about the “deadliest week” of either disease.
15084,"And after you do, apologize!"

15087,"I forget you have the other half of the COVID denying, citizen endangering, Bobbsey Twin Governors."
15088,I hope that the government in your state starts taking this more seriously and ignoring DeSantis.
15089,I am sorry it has gotten so bad.
15090,You are a liar.
15091,You know what you’re doing is immensely misleading.
15092,"Claiming Covid is 100x as deadly as the flu is not only a lie, it is a stupid lie that makes you laughable."
15093,"&gt;""I care about my personal convenience a lot more than other people""."
15094,LOL everyone does.

15100,"That's good, but what about contactless check-in?"
15101,Some one else can make and pay for reservations
15102,Facts.
15103,"These people saying ""well just wait until enough people get vaccinated and wait on our leaders to let us know"" need to stop simping so hard for government."
15104,"People need to TAKE their lives back and [throw away their masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbw6hF7tHns) as soon as the most vulnerable are widely vaccinated, or people like this Spanish virologist motherfucker are going to keep shifting the window of acceptance more and more towards restrictions forever."
15105,"Fuck that, I hate all this shit, I want normality back, and we need to learn to live with this."
15106,"So what’s the solution heard immunity, based on current mortality rate from COVID19, that would not be achieved until after 1,000,000 Americans are dead."
15107,Washing hands and wearing a mask seem preferable.
15108,Or Just Ask Questions about ComORbiDitIeS
15109,No wonder gyms are closed.
15110,The virus will kill those lats!
15111,"Gov Evers has tried to do a lot, and everything has been stopped by the republican legislature or through lawsuits by their surrogate conservative organizations in the conservative majority wi supreme court"
15112,False.
15113,If you look at deaths by the actual day of the death the last 7 days total is actually 65 deaths lower than the previous 7 days.
15114,Did he say that?
15115,"&gt;and since most people are asymptomatic

You know asymptomatic people can still spread the virus, right?"
15116,I kind of miss having a magazine subscription.
15117,Used to read time on my kindle.
15118,Maybe I should re subscribe.
15119,Yeah America is becoming completely stupid.
15120,I have zero faith left in my country as a whole.
15121,"You underestimate the greed of corperations and sales teams, who are having zoom meetings on how to ""safely have black friday"""

15160,(nor NZ)
15161,I appreciate that you see my overall points.
15162,I’d like you to know that I also understand your overall point.
15163,"However I’d like to note that however vain trump may be, his secret service agents voluntarily swear by oath never to leave his side."
15164,"On that note, if the president had leprosy the agents would still consider it an honor to stand by his side."
15165,"I have a feeling that the agent feels no resentment for trump, in fact he probably loves him."
15166,"Remember these are humans who work together everyday, despite whatever the news may have us believe, I feel like most employees in the whitehouse are not only cordial, but also absolutely love to work there; as would I, under any administration."
15167,1.1 million average tests a day.
15168,The testing was about 900k/day when India peaked at 97k cases on september 16th.
15169,Since then 7-day moving average for number of tests/day has increased by 10% and the 7-day moving avg for new cases/day has fallen by 25%.
15170,It's official.
15171,"Broadway will remain closed until at least June 2021, and possibly even to next fall."
15172,They made the *right* decision.
15173,"It's not safe to open theaters right now, especially with cases on the rise and everything."
15174,"Now, I know a lot of you might be thinking that they can overturn this if the vaccine is distributed quickly and properly, and so on."
15175,"But this ruling seems to be hard and definitive, and realistically, like it or not, **there is *no* way to reopen Broadway in 2021**."
15176,"Broadway is unique among businesses in that it takes *lots* of time (several months) to prepare each show, and whatnot."
15177,It's much easier to cancel shows than to magically start holding them again.
15178,"As such, it'll probably be one of the *last* businesses to reopen - certainly not in 2021, and quite possibly not even in 2022!"
15179,"For what it's worth, I think this pandemic might end up killing Broadway once and for all."
15180,"The longer Broadway remains closed, the less likely it will roar back eventually."
15181,"It's very possible we are going to have to find alternatives to Broadway once the dust settles, as part of the ""new normal""."

15213,You FOOL!
15214,There is a scheme much greater than all of us that is in the works.
15215,And you are here pandering to the worlds elite like so many flocks of sheep.
15216,I’m Canadian btw
15217,"I was changing the wording and forgot to change an ""on"" to ""and""."
15218,You really think that is comparable?
15219,"""Wow, this guy actually thinks 'on' can be used in place of 'and'""?"
15220,"No, you don't."

15222,"I agree some won’t / wouldn’t follow it, I hope 70%-80% would - really depends on how bad it gets."
15223,I think the most rational time to reopen is when vaccination levels reach what we think is the herd immunity threshold (~70%).
15224,"I think any surges in cases after that point would have a very blunted impact, and if we can get it to the level where it’s equivalent to a bad flu strain, I think that would be a total game changer."
15225,PRC lied for months about the virus.
15226,They're still lying.
15227,"You clearly have no idea how many 200,000 from a single disease is, even with most people taking it at least somewhat seriously, and even with only a few million being infected so far."
15228,"If the entire country were to get infected, millions die."
15229,"And the argument of saying it only kills old people is fucking stupid, too"
15230,"Yeah,

It's worse because all the loonies think they're normal."
15231,🤫🤫🤫
15232,This isn't the spanish flu.
15233,We're likely going to have one or maybe several vaccines available before the end of the year or beginning of next year.
15234,It'll obviously take some time to get enough people vaccinated to the herd immunity threshold--I seem to recall Dr. Fauci saying Q3 2021 but I could be mistaken--but after that?
15235,I haven't seen a single compelling argument for why we should continue doing any of the measures that we are currently doing.
15236,"I've seen a lot of ""suck it buttercup"" type arguments, though."
15237,We don't need microchips to track people because cell phones have been doing that for 30 years at this point.
15238,This will have zero application in ANY vaccine.
15239,"To be fair my recollection (in the UK), was that masks were heavily advised against at the beginning, then slowly they said they may possibly help, now they are mandatory on public transport, most shops, etc."
15240,So...?
15241,Deaths are also consistently in the 170 range as well...which means it’s still fucking spreading badly.
15242,"Sure, maybe we’ve reached a “peak” for its spreadability, but I also know we aren’t doing as many tests, and the hospitalization is down because it’s mostly young people getting it."
15243,And the young people DONT GET FUCKING TESTED.
15244,You want to know how I know?
15245,"Because 2 of my coworkers were sick, and instead of quarantining and getting tested, they said “it’s probably just a cold."
15246,It’ll be fine.” BOTH of them said that.
15247,Both of them 19.
15248,Kind of irresponsible don’t ya think?
15249,What if they interacted with someone who is immunocompromised?
15250,"So yeah, hospitalizations are down, so is testing, and the age of people who’ve gotten it."

15253,The USDA keeps a running [database](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/sa_one_health/sars-cov-2-animals-us) of confirmed cases in animals but it doesn't seem to report on animal deaths.
15254,The CDC does have some [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/pets.html) on how to keep your pets healthy--basically treating them as if they were any other human and not letting them have contact with anyone outside your household.

15260,"But consider this: out if a population of 900,000 we have 2 cases."
15261,Two.
15262,"Because we locked down hard and early, mandated social distancing and hand washing and wore masks."
15263,Our bubble is glorious.
15264,Business is back on track and the anti-mask bullshit is virtually non-existent because our leaders followed science and didn't use mask wearing as a political tool to manipulate the low IQ goons.
15265,"The AZ drop happened simultaneously with a mask mandate, so there's at least a reasonable explanation"
15266,They’re “doing really well” because they don’t test as much

15270,"Yeah, we gotta wade through this already disastrous election cycle before we can think about fun coming back at all"
15271,In.
15272,India per capita deaths are low a 10th of America because testing is lower than America.
15273,But in Delhi where I live death rates per million are half of that of the USA but testing per capita  is also half of America.

15281,This is false.
15282,It was an approved clinical trial.
15283,Seven girls died so they halted the test.
15284,An investigation found 5 died of completely unrelated causes.
15285,The other 2 are undetermined but most likely also not due to the vaccine.
15286,They didn't go in to India to do this because they've already been working in India for years and they still are working in India today because the government wants them there.
15287,They just halted the one trial.
15288,Stop spreading dumbass conspiracy theories.
15289,I just remember the doctor saying we were having a weird surge of flu.
15290,And yet he has done far more to address this pandemic than the Trump administration has.
15291,In what way is Gates wrong?
15292,Dr. Tam is okay at best.
15293,Dr. Henry refuses to mandate masks.
15294,"Actually because the NE was crushed early on (for US deaths/pop, NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI still hold 5 of the 6 top spots), we are more compliant with the public health safety measures."
15295,"Sure, we have our anti-maskers, deniers, and pandemic-fatigued, but not nearly as many as elsewhere."
15296,"Now, with some k-12 and colleges/uni’s in classrooms, plus partying (looking at you, Providence College), plus pandemic fatigue and cooler weather starting, numbers are inching up."
15297,I’d be surprised if they reach what states with less compliant / more antiscience populations will see.
15298,Guess we’ll see.
15299,When you're working in a restaurant you get at least minimum wage- regardless of tips.
15300,Similar to what the clerk will be earning.
15301,I thought they were skipping that phase?
15302,"&gt; The US should be used as an example of ""what not to do"" with ~~in a pandemic~~ [INSERT HERE]."

15304,"Well, hopefully November 3 goes the way we need it to go and we can get the stimulus passed."
15305,That will go a long way to ensuring a strong recovery once we get to that vaccination point
15306,"The risk is high - kids coming home from college, family gatherings at Thanksgiving and December, the states who have opened up without restrictions, the election, I struggle to see a non-destructive path through this unless a vaccine becomes readily available late Nov early December."
15307,"Could easily see a need to go on a broader, restrictive lockdown at some point early next year."
15308,1k cases a day for 19 million people doesn’t sound that bad?
15309,"Arizona’s 500~ cases a day to 7.2 million is relatively comparable, actually a little higher of a rate."
15310,Although New York certainly has the potential for cases to snowball faster due to population density.
15311,Most people won't follow any lockdown
15312,The Gates Foundation has spearheaded multiple covid19 testing programs that were completely free and they have been working to make covid19 vaccines free for as many people as possible while operating at a very significant loss.
15313,You and your ilk may want to keep the US isolated from the rest of the world but the rest of us know and understand that massive problems like this pandemic can only be addressed if we work together globally.
15314,Again much of the research being used currently to develop covid19 vaccines were directly funded by the Gates Foundation.
15315,I want this pandemic to be over and for the death and suffering to come to an end and those of you continually standing in the way will be dealt with one way or another.

15645," Abstract   

  
Over the past several decades, multiple coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as highly infectious, lethal viruses in humans, most notably in the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2."
15646,"To date, there are no known therapeutic or preventative agents to target CoVs."
15647,"Though age and comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs are unknown."
15648,"Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication."
15649,"SARS-CoV-2 conserves an ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown to counteract innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model CoV, and SARS-CoV."
15650,"Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cell lines, infected ferrets, and a deceased patient’s lung consistently and strikingly dysregulates the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) gene set with respect to NAD+ synthesis and utilization."
15651,SARS-CoV-2 induces a set of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members; these PARPs include enzymes required for the innate immune response to MHV.
15652,"Further, we show that MHV infection induces an attack on host cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)."
15653,"The data indicate that overexpression of a virally induced PARP, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host cell NAD metabolism and that NAD+ boosting strategies differ in their efficacy to restore PARP10 function."
15654,"Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD+ through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition may be less likely to restore antiviral PARP functions."

15661,The Trump tax bill in 2018 eliminated this.
15662,"Communism can only exist on a worldwide scale, and requires the large-scale industry and global supply chains as its basis that capitalist industrialization creates."
15663,"When the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and transfered power to the workers' councils (soviets), the working class became the ruling class of Russia, the political precondition for the transition to communist society, but economically the Russian economy was semi-feudal and too little developed to even begin the economic transformation into communism, which would require the economic assistance of  Europe, which was already industrialized and fully capitalist."
15664,"In Lenin's own words, the task of the Bolsheviks in Russia was to industrialize Russia and establish state-capitalism controlled by the proletarian state, i.e, to carry out the capitalist revolution, while supporting worldwide communist revolution to unite the world into a global soviet republic, however with the defeat of the German revolution by 1923 the world revolutionary wave was defeated."
15665,"Without the assistance of the world proletariat, the proletarian state in Russia was incapable of going further than capitalism and politically degenerated back into a capitalist state and the working class lost its position as ruling class by 1928, with this counter-revolutionary degeneration carried out by the Stalinists who abandoned world revolution under the false theory of ""building socialism in one country""."
15666,"All genuine communists were first expelled from the party and later executed or thrown in concentration camps, and the communist revolution was lost."
15667,"TLDR: the October revolution was simultaneously a capitalist and a communist revolution, however since a communist revolution can only succeed globally when the world revolution failed the capitalist aspect of the revolution ended up overwhelming and obliterating the communist aspect."
15668,"All the other ""socialist"" states of the Cold War were always capitalist states where there was state-capitalism in industry, they were never communist as they did not arise from workers revolutions and did not support world revolution."
15669,"These governments took power either from being imposed militarily by Stalinist Russia or from revolutions of the propertied classes: the middle classes (petty-bourgeoisie) and peasantry, so they were bourgeois revolutions in the vein of the French Revolution rather than being genuine communist revolutions (such as in Vietnam and China)."

15767,We live in a society after all.
15768,Number of infected people isn't even close to warrant a lockdown.
15769,Almost everyone infected can get tested now.
15770,In March/April when hospitals were getting flooded with people the true number of infections was much higher than what testing showed.
15771,Implementing a lockdown without actually needing to is the worst you can do if you want people to keep following guidelines for many many more months.
15772,You need to recalibrate how many infections warrant which measures.
15773,A lockdown is last resort to protect health capacity.

15940,And if the order is to not close schools they will write that the virus doesn't spread there.
15941,Trump visited over there too?
15942,Yeah I wondered that too.
15943,"I don’t have a good answer for it, I’m in Quebec and people around me are having lockdown fatigue and on top of that the mixed messages from the government made it hard for a lot of people to take things seriously, when it started I really thought that we’d have a hard lockdown and things would be better after like it were in China (I still have family and friends there and they cannot fathom why we are opening schools, more so than restaurants), I feel like we are kind of doing a half ass job in everything and lack direction and I’m personally very confused too and sometimes feel like my efforts are for nothing :/"

15951,We're in a much better situation now than before summer.

16030,There's no need for lockdown measures or even mandatory masks of you can keep distance.
16031,In March/April the testing data showed a fraction of true infections.
16032,Now with the increased testing capacity almost every infection is shown in the data.
16033,We have much better control of how many are actually infected.
16034,50 000 cases a day in March/April meant we could assume a lot more were infected and it showed as hospitals were overrun.
16035,50 000 per day now is actually close to 50 000 and hospitals aren't close to being overrun.

16070,Yeah they had to issue a correction.
16071,"I posted it, but if you don’t see it:

&gt;Editor's Note: Dr. Wright issued a clarification on the report, saying the state could have the vaccine as early as November 10 but the state has not contacted the city's health department with a date."
16072,"&gt;”We haven’t heard anything from the state yet on when we’ll be getting a vaccine, other than, for them to tell us, at some point we’re going to have a vaccine, and we need to be planning for it."
16073,"So, internally, we’ve started a whole planning process to get ready for this."
16074,"Just looking at what’s been said from the drug companies that are manufacturing this, they’re producing vaccine at the same time they’re testing the vaccine."
16075,"If the vaccine works, then they will, through the FDA, ask for approval, if they get approval, then that will ship out, and it will ship out fairly quickly, because they’ve already got it made.” -Dr. Wright

They aren’t shipping vaccine before approval."

16098,"Look at France, Spain, and UK at the moment."
16099,"Look at how many 'cases' they have, which are generating so few deaths."
16100,"If you use the same ratio of cases/deaths back in April (before widespread testing), then the number of 'actual' cases was *possibly* 20x, 30x or even higher to generate those deaths."
16101,The % asymptomatic is certainly much much higher than originally thought.
16102,"This type of calculation is by-no-means perfect, but it gives a sense of how that figure *could* be accurate."
16103,"There was an interesting study which came out of Japan that tracked ~800 people over a number of months which found serum antibodies went from 5% of subjects positive to ~40%, without a large number of 'cases' being registered."
16104,Their conclusion was that asymptomatic cases were far higher than originally anticipated.
16105,"If the 10% comment was innacurate I would have expected a formal correction long before now, given the traction it got?"

16115,Green screen is also what people do to apply special effects to a clip (like editing out his coughs without changing the background).
16116,"In fact, they put him outside on the white house lawn... the lawn of the house he's staying in."
16117,That means he's so sick he can't even walk to the front of his own house to record a video.

16125,"Okay, I was looking for [this study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20\)30180-8/fulltext) earlier and finally found it."
16126,"It is, of course, very small scale, but it's a good indication that we shouldn't assume the majority of excess death is COVID."
16127,They found only 2 previously undiagnosed cases of COVID and 14 cases where delay in care was a possible or probable contributor.
16128,"I agree it's concerning that this isn't something that seems to be explored much, but I tend to think it's more an issue of it being a really difficult quest to answer rather than anything nefarious."
16129,True but he’s impaired just now so they get to emit a squeak or two.
16130,"&gt;Because scientists and doctors had more important things to do between December and March than preventatively issue directives about how a respiratory, flu/pneumonia like illness with SARS and MERS characteristics can't be contracted from touching a box of cornflakes."
16131,"You're considering something settled science until its proven otherwise even if its dangerous, misleading or stupid."
16132,So what you are saying now is that fomite transmission was not ruled out initially as you are claiming?
16133,Seems to me that not erring on the side of caution until you have confirmation is pretty foolish.
16134,Why do you insist on assuming things that had not been publicly confirmed by science when you yourself said that you should not?
16135,"&gt;No, it means that TB and COVID are possibly equivalent in how deadly they are depending on where you want to move the goalposts to fit your argument."
16136,COVID killing 1M in 8 months is roughly the same as TB killing 1.5M in 12.
16137,"Cut the snarky ass rhetoric because you aren't as smart as you think you are

How does the coronavirus killing ***more*** people per month mean that they are equivalent?"
16138,It has not been 8 months.
16139,It has been 7 tops from the metric you set regarding when deaths started to spike in Europe.
16140,Are you trying to move the goal post because you know you're wrong?
16141,"Additionally, infection rates are climbing all over the world, and we were taking extreme measures all over the world to keep those numbers low."
16142,Why are you denying the well established science that says these extreme measures reduce risk?
16143,"&gt;But in general, the public should do ""what you do every cold and flu season,"" said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state -- where the first US case of Wuhan coronavirus was confirmed."
16144,That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
16145,"If you're the one feeling sick, cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch."
16146,"If you or your doctor suspect you might have the Wuhan coronavirus, the CDC advises wearing a surgical mask."
16147,"First off, January 2020 is not in 2020 when this started."
16148,You claimed we knew from the begining that fomite transmission was known to be a non-factor.
16149,Where is your evidence to support this claim?
16150,Your quote does not say that fomite transmission is not an issue.
16151,"In fact, why would they be encouraging handwashing if there was no concern over fomite transmission?"
16152,"&gt;2 weeks prior, we weren't even sure if it could be transmitted human to human thanks to China basically lying to the world and jailing anyone who deigned to report anything contrary to CCP rhetoric."
16153,So you admit again that you were incorrect when you said we had this all figured out from the beging?
16154,"And yeah, china fucked the world over."
16155,That does not have anything to do with your anti science claims or inability to understand math while you claim we knew everything from the negjnging while also admitting that we didn't.
16156,Make up your mind.
16157,"&gt;Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected,"" the WHO said in the statement."
16158,"""It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans."
16159,So yet another quote saying that we did not know everything about fomite transmission?
16160,How do you not realize you keep admitting you were wrong?
16161,I probably vote Putin and I'm English
16162,"I’m a democrat and I’m voting for Biden in a few weeks, and if you look at my post history you’ll see that."

16178,All in all I'd say we've done pretty well.
16179,Why is there Carmen Sandiego in the thumbnail?
16180,Not sure that only requiring masks in pubs when you stand up from the table is really going to do much given the nature of this virus.

16230,At the same time?
16231,Most of those “lockdowns” were less than a month.
16232,And nearly every state went from “lockdown” to open everything up with no guidelines in place.
16233,"A lockdown doesn’t work by itself, that’s just the straw man argument you people come up with."
16234,Bingo.
16235,There's been a meta study that reduced the difference in CFR around the globe to just the difference in median (?)

16237,How come schools aren't open then?
16238,How come many businesses are still closed.
16239,You're confusing lockdown with quarantine
16240,LOL i like how all your replies are downvoted.
16241,America is a huge mess right now.
16242,200k plus deaths is not a fantastic number compared to all the other first world countries.
16243,"The 200k doesnt even factor in all the unrelated deaths that have spiked up considerably since covid started (Pneumonia, heart attacks, etc.)"
16244,Not to mention flu season is starting up and i've witnessed how disgusting people can be during that time.

16280,I never said “not those scientists” I said that your link was an opinion piece with no data backing it up.
16281,Meanwhile you’re disagreeing with the scientific and medical world and listening to a fringe group.
16282,You’re literally the one saying “not those scientists” by ignoring scientific consensus.
16283,"Post actual evidence of your claim, don’t just link to people saying the same thing as you that isn’t evidence."

16293,"For one, herd immunity isn't going to stop all cases from ever existing."
16294,"Measles is a good example - we have (vaccine-induced) herd immunity, but it doesn't mean that no one ever gets it, it just means that the sort of wildfire spread we saw back in the spring is no longer possible."
16295,"But for another, it also isn't strictly speaking one specific point."
16296,"There's a technical definition that basically boils down to ""enough people with immunity that R&lt;1 without any other mitigation""."
16297,"But in reality, it's going to be a continuum."
16298,"If we've brought R down from R0=3 to Reff=1.1 with other interventions, say, then that 20% immunity is enough to drop R below 1."
16299,"Those are fake numbers, of course, but you get the idea."
16300,I'm going to expect March-April 2021.
16301,I don’t even care if people think I’m weird for wearing it.
16302,But I won’t be caught at an event where everyone isn’t wearing it anyway.
16303,"My mask may protect me a bit, but I’m not nearly as worried about me passing it knowing I take precautions in every day live as I am being infected by people who if they aren’t wearing one now means they don’t do it other times and are more likely to be spreading it anyway."
16304,I’m afraid I’m going to make some family very upset this Thanksgiving and Christmas because unless they change their behavior I will NOT be at any events around certain family members.
16305,And really don’t even want to be around other family members that allow the wreckless members around them at other times.
16306,Quit enabling their shitty behavior.

16311,&gt; Since March we’ve not eaten out or even had a coffee.

16361,Listening to the school board secretary read out the public comments this week was interesting.
16362,"The large majority were advocating for continued distance learning -- most wanting at least a choice but some arguing we shouldn't have any sort of in person instruction, period."
16363,Maybe 30% of people were encouraging a return to in person instruction.
16364,And then there were the two people who went on strangely articulate yet simultaneously nonsensical rants about 5G.
16365,"We live in a weird world, man."
16366,Worth mentioning that I usually catch 2-3 colds per year.
16367,"With the gyms closed and working from home (no mass transit, no office environment) I've only caught one this year and that was in January."
16368,The amount of money our economy could save just from so many people avoiding colds is huge.
16369,It's not a precise estimate.
16370,It's just the closest possible estimate I can make.
16371,I do not see how we have the tools to make a better one.
16372,"Even more worrisome, nobody seems interested in finding out."
16373,"If these deaths are caused by something else, they are preventable."
16374,"We have something like 100,000 non-COVID-diagnosed excess deaths in the US this year."
16375,If these are not being caused by COVID they are preventable.
16376,We just aren't interested in finding out.
16377,And the only reason I can think of for that is that the people who would be funding that research know the answer is they're due to COVID.
16378,"&gt;  Lots of men are hopeless

16382,"Macron has had the lowest ratings of any French President in history, I doubt this is doing him any favours."
16383,Lockdown or it will be like Grand-Est in the spring but countrywide.
16384,The basic point here is that he was willing to have OTHER people suffer die for some economic activity.
16385,So it fucking serves him right if what he's been trying to impose on others happens to him.
16386,"He needs to get his fat ass back to work until he dies, for the greater good, since that's what he has been saying others should do."
16387,"&gt;So, basically what you are saying is less death is somehow better, while at the same time arguing that all death is bad."
16388,"You already agree with this and apply it to your own life choices, as does everybody (everybody mentally sane anyway) so why are you contending it?"
16389,"You already avoid causing harm because this is better, while at the same time agreeing, unless you're a psychopath, that needlessly hurting and killing someone is wrong."
16390,&gt;You’re literally chasing your tail.
16391,"Then everybody is, because you cause harm to animals while avoiding harm to them in other ways, so this applies to anyone who mitigates harm and causes a degree of it anyway."
16392,&gt;It’s death.
16393,"It doesn’t matter if you meant to do i

There's a big difference in consequences and reactions to the perpetrators between murder and manslaughter for a reason."
16394,"Both result in someone dying, sure, big similarity, but saying there's no difference between accidentally driving into someone and buying a gun and shooting someone in the head is completely disingenuous."
16395,"&gt;t, it doesn’t matter if you claim that veganism will cause less (it won’t)."
16396,This is obviously wrong in two huge ways.
16397,"Animal products implicitly necessitate animals, 50+ billion of them, being shot and having their throats slit, veganism doesn't."
16398,So already there is a huge disparity.
16399,"Then there is the massive caveat, in what I presume you're implying (crop harvesting kills animals), which is that animal farming requires 4 times as much land to produce about 4 times *less* calories overall."
16400,"FAO source &gt; [https://ourworldindata.org/land-use](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use)

The result being that we no longer necessitate tens of billions of animals being shot and stabbed to death, and we downscale total agricultural land by 75%, cutting accidental crop deaths to a quarter of what they currently are."
16401,"[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)

***""Researchers at the University of Oxford found that cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent."
16402,"***

***If everyone stopped eating these foods, they found that global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined."
16403,"""***

Saying veganism doesn't reduce any death or suffering at all is demonstrably 100% false."
16404,&gt;Something died so you could live.
16405,Now own up to the fact that you have to kill to eat and stop pretending that because you didn’t harvest the wheat yourself that made your bread that you aren’t implicit in the deaths of all those mice and rabbits and insects.
16406,What's the conclusion to this logic?
16407,"That if somebody has a car accident they may as well buy a machine gun and start gunning down pedestrians because it's the same, right?"
16408,"&gt;You are, and as a farmer I have to tell you there’s no way out of this system."
16409,Responsibility for what you do is something sorely lacking here.
16410,"I'm responsible for buying food, right, I take full responsibility for that."
16411,"&gt;Most of the folks in these comments (and I guess you apparently as well because you chose to hide behind an alt), don’t really care about half of what actually goes into most agriculture that isn’t factory farming, you watch some sappy docudrama with outdated animal abuse footage."
16412,"Of course we care, that's why we choose to make a difference."
16413,If we didn't care we wouldn't do anything.
16414,Yet here we are.
16415,"&gt;Things die, it’s life."
16416,"Things die, therefore murder is okay...?"
16417,&gt; A rabbit in the field doesn’t sit there and contemplate the legality of whether it was murder or manslaughter when you run the combine over it.
16418,"It's a good job I'm vegan then, because the likelihood of this happening would be 4x greater if i wasn't."
16419,"&gt;It’s just dead, and it’s dead so you can have a future sandwich."
16420,Same as if I walked out into the pasture and ended the life of one of our cows.
16421,"Okay so besides the massive difference in how much death and suffering is caused between a vegan and a non vegan, you're still pretending that a car accident is the same as a school shooting."
16422,What happened to the vaccine they were distributing?
16423,"There are 25 countries with higher 14 day totals and 31 countries with higher daily totals (per 100k, you know the number that actually means something)."

16432,OP said he gets twice that much a day.
16433,"Then your comment appears to be saying we get 24,000 *per million per day*???"

16446,I’m asthmatic so we are hyper vigilant but if I wasn’t we would still act like this as it’s the only way!
16447,You stay safe and keep wearing a mask too!
16448,It’s crap but the more of us that do no matter which country we are in hopefully it encourages more to follow suit ❤️
16449,"If the Russian military separately declares they will collect tolls for me on it, I'll buy it."
16450,We've definitely had states with way worse days though.
16451,"Florida has a population 1/3rd the size of France and did 15,300 new cases in a day back in July."
16452,"NY's worst day was 12,274 new cases in one day in April."
16453,"If NYs population was the same as France, this would scale up to roughly 43k cases."
16454,It's even worse if you consider almost all of those cases were just in NYS.
16455,"The US is really being saved by having huge farm areas separating our densely populated cities, particularly East from West."
16456,These small European countries don't have that luxary.
16457,There's a difference between enjoying something and recognizing that a minor inconvenience can have large positive benefits.
16458,Refusing to accept a minor inconvenience for the health of all society is antisocial.
16459,"I often wonder how people that use  ""my body my choice"" over wearing a mask, feel about a woman's choice to say ""No"" or to have body autonomy."
16460,Crap!

16467,"I am, the governors that instituted lockdowns have no grasp on reality."
16468,"Being in western pa my feeling was that the lockdowns were a reset so that we could emerge with a fighting chance, yet it was obvious that the general public persisted with a willfully ignorant understanding of Covid and the way it spreads."
16469,Like dumb as a bag of hammers understanding.
16470,We never learned how to responsibly lift a lockdown.
16471,I was in a dentist office talking in a small office with the care plan provider with my n95 mask on while he was complaining about how much PPE they purchased and how they were the safest place in town (all while wearing his mask around his neck.
16472,"Meanwhile they all wore masks around their chins or below their noses, they rolled their eyes when they asked me the “Covid survey questions” about my travel and symptoms and pretty much told me to say no for everything."
16473,Even the dentist only donned  the real PPE (face shield and n95 when he was drilling.
16474,Forget masks People can’t be bothered to even sit 4 ft apart indoors without a mask.

16479,Actually it does.
16480,Just start enforcing harsher penalties for flouting the rules.
16481,"&gt;Seems inevitable that the longer you keep these things in place, the more such demonstrations happen around the world."
16482,People who want the country reopened don't want to take any measures to keep it that way.
16483,"No offense, but it's such a completely idiotic position to have."
16484,Even Sweden that didn't lockdown has most of its population abiding by social distancing rules.
16485,NZ has had one of the least restrictions since May (barring 2 weeks in Aug for Auckland) and they now have literally no restrictions.
16486,How do you think NZ achieved it if not for their mask mandates (level 2+) and social distancing guidelines?
16487,"Also, the people arguing against mask mandates also do so on a dishonest platform."
16488,Let's clarify this: mask mandates absolutely have to be paired with social distancing guidelines if you want the best way to contain the outbreak.
16489,"Beyond NZ, countries like South Korean, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore are good examples too."
16490,New Zealand is an island with the population size of the greater Miami or Atlanta metro area.
16491,We have like 10 metro areas+ that are greater than that size that you can move from one to the other.

16515,In today's world having an opinion that goes against  the mainstream narrative will not only get you censored but can also get  you labeled as a conspiracy theorist and even a terrorist.
16516,"Reddit has  been a goto place for uncensored information, news and opinion."
16517,In these  modern (keep the people divided) world an opinion that goes against the  agenda is considered fake news or even propaganda.
16518,So now reddit joins  the long list of social media outlets whom censor any opinion that goes  against the mainstream plan of control.

16522,More emphasis on wearing masks early on and only shutting down indoor events and bars/restaurants would have been a more optimal solution.

16528,"It will us cost a lot effort, lives, money and restrictions to get it maybe till january/february again kind of under control."
16529,The next weeks/months will at one point show a uncontrolled spread and losses like in new York or bergamo.
16530,Wish us luck and may god be gracious to us.
16531,Chick in the photo is baller style
16532,Hers doesn’t have that to her knowledge unfortunately
16533,"Yes, we know."
16534,Nice job science deniers.
16535,We are in Texas DH does have a 211 option so she’s trying that now and if that doesn’t get our answers she’s gonna call to the local hospitals/clinics just to be sure they don’t have anything further
16536,&gt; Do you think that the government in place in Russia could be reformed?
16537,Or do you think an entirely new system needs to be implemented?
16538,No.
16539,"The current system is built around Putin, it needs massive changes to be operational."
16540,"Even Putin can't replace himself without changing the system, it relies on his personal connections way too much."
16541,"Some people from the government might be integrated in the new system, though."
16542,&gt;Do you find there is more political upset in Russia since trump got elected?
16543,Or is that my American perspective that the world revolves around us talking?
16544,"While the Russian government is obsessed with the US because they still consider Russia a competing superpower, the personality of the President of the US is has fairly little influence on the Russian society."
16545,"Russians mostly care about bilateral relations between the countries rather then what different American personalities say; they see the US mostly as a single entity, not a group of different branches of power making different decisions."
16546,"Trump was positively received by the general public in comparison to Obama at first, but then the relations with the US deteriorated to their lowest point in the recent history, the US remained the #1 enemy of Russia, and Russians have quickly become disappointed in him."
16547,"As for Trump's personal influence on societal and political trends in Russia, I think they are almost negligible."
16548,"The cultural influence of the US as a country is much much bigger in comparison, we all live in the same global information space and consume American media products after all."
16549,You actually believe all that shit?
16550,Which would have been easy if we had leadership who worked on actually fighting Covid instead...  can’t mention it on this subreddit.

16564,We recently went out of town to a more rural area and people were inside stores without masks!!!
16565,I was appalled and felt so bad for the workers.
16566,People also had their Trump flags all over the place... if that tells you anything.
16567,Yessir
16568,They're not saying full lockdown for two years.
16569,Bruh how are you calculating those numbers lol.
16570,You're using total numbers since the beginning?
16571,"Best way is 14 day cumulative or just daily new cases (both per 100k, why 1 million lmao)


Using these methods with data from Oct 7 (since it's complete):

Daily cases per 100k

US: ~13.09
RU: ~7.96

Cumulative cases/14 days per 100k

US: 183.96
RU: 83.43

Also, there are 31 countries with a higher daily case rate than the US, 25 if you go by 14 day case rate."
16572,If y'all wanna talk about real shit look at Israel and Czech Republic.
16573,It's a mask.
16574,There's virtually no harm in wearing one compared to all the potential benefits.

16583,Before my first year at Uni (28 year old transfer student) I never got my flu shot... Then I got the flu.
16584,I thought it would be a normal cold I could bust out in a couple days of rest/water/vitamins.. but I just kept feeling worse and it kept going.
16585,Ended up missing the entire first week and a half of classes because I couldn't get out of bed
16586,"Since Russia isn't exactly trustworthy, should we suspect those numbers are higher?"
16587,"Wonder if that has anything to do with the video he made for Apocalyptical with his other band, Puscifer?..."
16588,https://youtu.be/Hj_bTbfAEsc
16589,Sorry didn’t mean to break the rules.
16590,Thank you for the article though just everything I’ve read so far seems inconclusive.
16591,And I don’t understand the level of detail from scientific papers.
16592,"Locking down the 99% to save the 1% was an incredibly stupid idea and has no basis being policy, and that has been proven just by looking at the world right now."
16593,Protecting those most at risk (the elderly in nursing homes) should've been the goal .
16594,Thanks for answering.
16595,"unless you get it, and give it to someone with say 50% or 70% chance of dying from it."
16596,Being selfish like that isnt something to be proud of
16597,"Most experts agree that it's going to take quite a long time for the vaccine to be out in significant enough number to be effective, especially given lower adoption rates."
16598,"It'll take the better part of a year to get it out, when available, and most people are thinking some time early next year... so that's two years in total right there?"
16599,"Mutations:
The virus is continuously checked for functional mutations all over the world."
16600,"Apart from D614G, I haven't read about any important changes."
16601,"More importantly: For the first week, people are infectious, in the second week, they get severe illness."
16602,Doesn't look like selective pressure towards milder cases to me.
16603,"Different social groups:
Looks to me that this is the driver of this miracle."
16604,"Weather:
The endemic ARIs are worse in cold weather."
16605,"Viral load:
I'd happily accept it as a major contribution if someone were to normalise the load stats by clinical criteria for hospitalisations and patient risk factors."
16606,Strong statistical evidence for the viral inoculum hypothesis could help motivating the selfish part of society.
16607,I am astonished that this is not studied at scale.
16608,"If confirmed, it would help pandemic control so much."
16609,"He's is one hell of a Chech mate, isn't he?"
16610,He is intubated I would wager.
16611,[removed]
16612,Yes I do
16613,How do we have a reliable count of overall mortality when it would necessarily be composed of the inaccurate/false counts from each country?
16614,"If you're saying we have accurate mortality and infection _rates_ that we can extrapolate from, I'd disagree: (1) they depend heavily on density and how effective the health care system is (2) we don't know them that accurately yet, there's a huge variance from 0.4% to over 5% reported (3) we'd need accurate testing and accurate reports of that testing, which again varies wildly between countries."
16615,This is the way.
16616,"Lock down the major cities, and don't even think about reopening this year already"
16617,Not in my house.
16618,"What it said, Frenchie."
16619,"Look at social media, like half the people literally either don't care, think its a hoax, or think somehow wearing a masks infringes on their freedom."
16620,absolutely insane.
16621,I don't disagree with that.
16622,"I would be mostly interested in having better paid sick leave programs so that people don't feel like they have to go to work when sick, either."
16623,Just pointing out another thing that postpones death that we invest significant resources in.
16624,[removed]
16625,It's almost like you're happy that other countries are doing badly again.
16626,What a childish comment.
16627,"Ok, this is unwarranted fatalism."
16628,"There is no logical ground for extremist statements like ""the vaccine will come too late"" and it will ""cause our world economy to collapse""."
16629,Congratulations on adding to the problem.
16630,It's exactly these kinds of alarmist exaggerated statements that make covid-deniers not take the risks seriously.
16631,Any trust in our institutions is long gone.
16632,It isn’t just the vax issue.
16633,Your first assertion is simply false.
16634,A lie.
16635,"We have examples of countries that have effectively controlled the spread, in some cases without resorting to lockdowns."
16636,They have in common strong testing and tracking infrastructures from the beggining and powerful scietifical bodies to monitor and run the show.
16637,"Meanwhile, western governments did nothing of that, and instead of accepting the negligence and investing on what is needed, we have people like you spouting nonsense."
16638,"Succesful countries have no retorted reality with a false dychotomy between health and economy, so there is not accountability."
16639,And it looks they are gonna do well both in the economy and the health.
16640,Meanwhile us...
16641,"Regarding what you say about hospitals, best regards from Madrid."
16642,Our ICUs are at their limits.
16643,Yep.
16644,"The last bit of ""come on, you can't be THAT blatantly hypocritical without getting laughed out of society"" has been beaten out of me in 2020."
16645,This is not news.
16646,I’ve known this since May.
16647,"I also knew this would inevitably cause me to lose my job, which I did."
16648,"same in MA, but we are seeing an uptick in cases."
16649,But we also have the colleges that brought students back.
16650,I'm within walking distance of a state university.
16651,"And there are students partying, hanging at the park with no social distancing."
16652,Plus leagues started deck hockey and softball.
16653,I had Covid.
16654,I try not to wish ill on anyone.
16655,But damn I wish some of the morons would get it
16656,Ayyy welcome to the big leagues Russia!
16657,-US
16658,"Yeah, you can't keep asking ""what went wrong"" with every single country in the world."
16659,Perhaps the simple fact is that this virus is going to spread no matter what and there's nothing we can do about it in the long run.
16660,"Absolutely not, I never said we should stay locked up to get cases to zero."
16661,Ontario was doing a good job in stage 2 of dropping cases while still having people move around.
16662,"Then stage 3 hit and everyone assumed covid was cancelled, people threw caution to the wind because it isn't trendy anymore."
16663,I agree that plenty of idiots think that every measure is an affront to their civil liberties even though we tried opening up so people could have more of their life back but it didn't work because morons got careless.
16664,The same idiots who cry about their freedoms are the ones being stupid and holding everyone back from some sense of normalcy because they can't be responsible.
16665,"We were looking bad a month ago, then we closed bars/resturants after 10:00, hopefully you guys can out of this soon enough."
16666,Sending best wishes.
16667,"sorry, but India takes the cup this time."
16668,Why do you think so?
16669,"In most European countries, they understand that good statistics are one of their best tools to help them adjust their response."
16670,Others consider it a matter of politics but it isn't.
16671,It is a matter of survival.
16672,Majority of the population maybe.
16673,Majority of the country no.
16674,"2/10 province, or 2/13 subnational entities is not a majority of the country."
16675,They shouldn’t let it control their lives though...
16676,"That too, but mostly because in winter, less day light cause more indoors gatherings, same with colder temperature."
16677,Indoor gatherings and viruses are BFF.
16678,The dancing videos didn’t help their credibility.
16679,Cure the world?
16680,Great!
16681,Make all the fucking money you want.
16682,"&gt; medical treatment

Ok, ""preventive medicine"", just 4 u bb ;)"
16683,Trump said he brought back football what happened?
16684,Switzerland?
16685,"Yes, possible, because its borders can't be entirely shut."
16686,China has been quarantining every single arrival for 14 days for ages.
16687,"Many people commute across Swiss border daily for work, for example, so that's clearly not feasible."
16688,"This is relevant because no matter how hard Switzerland's lockdowns are, it has little control over measures outwith its borders."
16689,China's approach has been to let the virus die out -- extensive contact tracing and quarantine/isolation.
16690,"Anyone with the virus is isolated, put away from the rest of the society, until they've recovered."
16691,This is so that the virus doesn't have anyone to infect.
16692,"Repeat doing that and eventually you no longer have any virus to infect anyone, because after 14+ days patients either die or recover and are no longer infectious."
16693,"Of course, things like masking and staying home also help immensely with keeping the transmission down."
16694,"Where I live, it's been an awfully long time since anything happened, really."
16695,"In general, if your area hasn't had community transmission for a very long time, it's quite secure to suppose that it's now all but Covid-free."
16696,"This is pure speculation but I suppose if mainland China were actually all but Covid-free then lots of things add up, like the zero local case record or the lack of covid-related medical situations despite most of the society approaching normal."
16697,"With a vaccine, it shows better results."
16698,So it's absolutely better than nothing.
16699,Be grateful for once in your life.

I remember Tool as being more edgy than that, but I remember when Hush came out."
16718,"Re-listening to it, one of the reasons I don't like it as much as some other songs from that time?"
16719,The bass line isn't interesting enough to me.
16720,Schism's one I remember liking more.
16721,"Ok if you don’t want to be like other men, congratulations, but why is it so hard to admit that men in general are actually like this?"
16722,Seriously my husband is mostly good and I’ve had some other good men as partners but I know way more men than ive dated and these are classic men characteristics.
16723,So why is this so hard for men to admit that their sex does this kind of shit all the time?
16724,“Whaaa you’re being sexist!
16725,Not all men!
16726,"!” Okay, enough men that these are generally accepted male characteristics worldwide, so what’s your problem with people pointing this out?"
16727,Like legit my husband bitches about men who act like this and acknowledges it’s typical behavior.
16728,So why can’t you acknowledge it without getting offended?
16729,"Is it because you are, in fact, exactly like this and so the complaints about this kind of behavior cut too close?"
16730,I think of those interviews he gave where he predicted the next human apocalypse would be a disease.
16731,I remember when France peaked at 7.6 thousand in the first wave
16732,"Exactly, if he would have actually put in even the least bit of effort he could have seen that there are countries whose reported deaths match up closely with excess death statistics."
16733,"And with a lot of countries it's at least not that far off, definitely not far enough to justify conspiracy theories about some giant cover up."
16734,But that's just not exciting enough for the people on this sub.
16735,I mean if you're trapped in your room during a fire anywhere you'll probably die anyway.
16736,MDHHS reinstated it almost immediately.
16737,Mandate is still effective
16738,Article says that just over 1500 new cases showed up in Oklahoma today.
16739,Would not be suprised if the Tulsa rally was one of the patient Zero events at this point.

16749,That lady is very fashionable.

16751,"I knew a guy who swore it wasn't even bad in Ohio, that his wife works for the hospital and she says they were never even remotely close to even 50% capacity."
16752,Said it was all a hoax and the mortality rate is lower than even a seasonal flu or common cold.
16753,Key word: knew.
16754,"Be safe people, be vigilant and stay safe."
16755,Is this a shock to anyone?
16756,Getting older sucks for everyone
16757,"Nah nah nah, don’t change the goal posts."
16758,"You were talking real big shit about how your city wasn’t the US, you had the cases handled, you defended karaoke."
16759,Now look at your pathetic situation.
16760,"Going back into lockdown, karaoke banned."
16761,Stfu and eat it
16762,As someone who lives in AZ.
16763,Gyms are open.
16764,Bars are open.
16765,Walmart’s and other stores no longer have a capacity limit.
16766,The mask mandate is more of a suggestion considering I’m almost always the only one wearing one.
16767,But I can tell you it’s getting harder and harder to find a testing site that doesn’t take 3 weeks to give me my results.
16768,"Or refuse to test me altogether

So take from that whatever"
16769,The fuck do I care what Bill Gates thinks?
16770,[removed]
16771,Must be *fuckin’* nice!
16772,"Gee, I wonder how accurate these numbers are (under reporting?)"
16773,"umm, no."
16774,"I suppose there are myriad things less harmful than covid 19 that I am not ""hysterical"" about."
16775,Did you actually mean what you wrote?
16776,"Personally, I would think that they should do it like they do for their SoCal pass, and do it by county."
16777,"That aside, I think there are probably a number of different things they could implement to help avoid some kinds of issues and make it a fairly robust system."
16778,Probably the first and easiest thing they could do is use IP tracking to determine where a reservation is being made from.
16779,"Of course text savvy folks would know how to get around this fairly easily, but it would solve A somewhat large number of cases."
16780,"Next, I think one of the more robust measures would be to put the reservation on a credit card with an address in the limit."
16781,"Finally, for anyone who’s name is under the reservation, who is over 18, a license should suffice to prove residency."
16782,"Other documents may be used, like utilities in the case that someone moved recently or has some other kind of issue."
16783,The nice thing for passholders is that this kind of verification probably only needs to be done once.
16784,"I think it’s worth noting that the system probably wouldn’t catch everyone, but it significantly raises the barriers to people traveling, especially from out of state."
16785,I think most of the measures that I’ve listed would provide a sufficient enough deterrent from masses of folks trying to game the system.
16786,"Also, In the case of Disney, they will certainly be fine based on their passholders in the area alone."
16787,"Given that capacity would be severely restricted, I have no doubt that they wouldn’t really need to make any ticket sales and could still probably get fairly decent attendance, at least for what’s allowed."
16788,I do think that the restriction would probably be able to be increased and eventually phased out as Disney and other parks me show their ability to operate without causing additional problems.
16789,"Of course, that’s contingent upon them being able to show that that’s the case, but I would suspect that it would become negotiable if they have a decent track record to show."
16790,"Shit, the whole damm country is spiking up the last few weeks."
16791,"Hell, the whole WORLD is spiking up the last few weeks."

16796,"Im from Peru(cases going down for almost 7 weeks) so i can not enter Italy, I will spend 2 weeks in Spain, in a city with wqyyyyyy lower cases than Madrid."
16797,"By the way, how much its the price for a room with private bathroom?"
16798,"Housinganywhere seems costly, like 400 euros for just a room with 2 bathrooms for 6 persons and bills not included, are there any other site as secure and with better prices?"

16804,"BEFORE ANYONE FREAKS OUT : READ THE ARTICLE

Boris is NOT talking about public health measures."
16805,"He’s NOT saying anything about social distancing, masks."
16806,The headline is designed to scare you.
16807,Read.
16808,The.
16809,Article.
16810,I'm pretty sure we (Britain) broke that like 3 days ago lol
16811,If you have enough money for an island....

16816,"No you're sticking your head in the mud, the only difference being that you're telling yourself everything is shit instead without any evidence to back up your ""scepticism""."
16817,"If you were actually interested in finding the truth you'd be able to get it within minutes, but that's not exciting enough, is it?"
16818,It's just much more entertaining to believe in worldwide conspiracies rather than to accept the boring reality that actual facts are presenting.

16825,Pompeo's travelling in Asia right now trying to cause trouble in the region.
16826,"This region has it pretty much under control, so he is unlikely to get it unless he picks it up on one of the US bases or from other Americans."
16827,I work for a French company in the US.
16828,When I was in Paris last year?
16829,Holy shit.
16830,And my boss rips those things all day long.
16831,There's a lot of benefit to having teams made up of people from the same community.
16832,"Coordinating teams across different time zones is a pain, and having people who are able to meet in person can be a big advantage, although maybe not as much if things are 100% remote."
16833,I think companies are realizing these things now after being overly enthusiastic about outsourcing a while back.
16834,"I can say from my own experience that my workplace has a team in India that coordinates with my office in North America, and our management ended up actually moving people from the Indian location to the North American one because collaboration was so much more effective."
16835,We also used to have people working externally from offices in other cities but over time we started trending a lot more toward getting new team members from the same city as our office.
16836,I found Carmen Sandiego.
16837,What did you have before?
16838,The average age of death is literally 82. over 40% of the deaths were in nursing homes alone.
16839,In my state under 30 death rate is less than 11 per million.
16840,Stop overblowing this.
16841,Do you have a source on that?

17531,"In a class I took recently, we talked about one of the main differences in Eastern and Western culture being that Eastern countries have developed with the idea that the whole is the most important, and selflessness and humility is part of their main focus."
17532,"Meanwhile, in Western countries, we focus way more on the individual, and focus on achievement and status, and value making your way in the world on your own."

17534,The main idea was talking about how Eastern Culture was shaped by Confucius and his principles.
17535,Singapore is an island so that's not a valid comparison or else you'd have to compare NZ to Singapore and they would look awful.
17536,The fact is geography and how people live vary across the world so there's no comparison that isn't apple to oranges
17537,Believe it or not people refuse to get tested here in the US too.
17538,"I live in Northern California, a state that has been aggressive in its response to Covid (in my opinion)."
17539,My county is densely populated but the county to my east is 75% rural and 25% densely populated.
17540,That county never made it on “the list” for shut downs.
17541,Why?
17542,The population has made efforts to keep people from their county from getting tested therefore artificially keeping the case counts in that county artificially low.
17543,Besides the masks (which people wear religiously) things are pretty normal including schools being open.
17544,"Schools in my area, two miles away, won’t open in a hybrid model for elementary students until November 9... right at the beginning of flu season."
17545,There are no communist countries in the world right now.

17548,"So that would be 540,000 infections, 2,984 deaths."
17549,0.5% IFR if my math is correct?
17550,Edit: this is assuming no selection bias of course and folks not losing detectable antibodies.
17551,But the states are in charge of disclosing the numbers.
17552,There are lots of ways to hide cases.
17553,USA is sus let's vote em out
17554,For the millionth time people who survive this virus will have lifelong medical conditions as a result and a lower life expectancy.
17555,People will still be dying of complications resulting from this virus decades after this pandemic has ended.
17556,Lockdowns are going to save a hell of a lot more than 0.1% of the population.
17557,Again people are fed up with you and your ilk and will not continue to be pushed around or put into danger any longer.
17558,Yes it is.
17559,They have been trying.

17562,"When someone can't lift a heavy burden you help them, not leave out there to suffer"
17563,There totally are.
17564,And people that are too young or immune compromised to get one.
17565,And that definitely sucks.
17566,But those same people probably can’t get an MMR vaccine or a TDAP booster and we don’t avoid living because we could give them diphtheria.
17567,"They protect themselves, we get our vaccines, doctors prepare for the possibility that those people will need treatment for mumps."
17568,That’s the way the world will evolve with Covid too.
17569,"It takes time, because treatments for covid need to be more effective and a vaccine has to be widely available."
17570,But to treat the Covid as truly an exception after a year or so has passed is silly.
17571,"The reason there are restrictions now is because it is novel, not because it is deadly."
17572,"It’s new—we don’t know how to treat it effectively, we don’t have a vaccine, we don’t know enough about long term effects"
17573,"If that's your standard, you would find that very few people in the entire world deserve sympathy."
17574,"And unless you yourself live in some utopia, chances are your own government did some shit that you didn't ""stand up to"" as well."

17608,Lol you’d be surprised out here in Tennessee at some of these places man.

17643,I'd much rather they just run month long deals and let the employees enjoy their Thanksgiving with their household.
17644,Once there is a vaccine we will be able to achieve herd immunity to this virus.

17655,I am kind of too the point that everyone should get tested if they feel sick but I don't know if that is even possible in the U.S.
17656,Yep every day if you hop onto this thread you can find someone looking for firsthand experiences with this virus to document for a school project or a personal study they are working on.

17666,Only about 15% of the cases in Seattle came from China.
17667,"I suppose the virus could have started in China, traveled to Europe, then to New York, and then to Seattle."
17668,"They are not implying the original source is some other country, only that by the time it got to Seattle it didn't come directly from China."

17674,"If being outside didn’t reduce the risk of Coronavirus, Minnesota would have been one of the hardest if not the hardest hit state this summer because the protests started here, and they were massive."

17683,"I’m a bit biased I’ve been expecting the Covideracy to up their undercount game so to speak, so I’ve been expecting the undercount to worsen."
17684,I think this is evidence that we have an undercount problem (something I think tgeir is broad consensus of experts for) and that undercount is worsening which is my own hypothesis.

18074,The places that have had sustained spread after that only truly blew up in June and July.
18075,There has not been that much time to lose immunity except for in sporadic cases.
18076,"And those sporadic cases are showing up in the literature now, and there will be many more."
18077,"Note how the published cases were identified in July the latest -- it takes some time to finalize the papers, so if there are many more reinfections being identified right now, you are not going to hear about it as it happens, you are going to see those papers a month or two from now."
18078,"In Iran, however, they were hit very hard, as in a substantial fraction of the population being infected, already in the January-March period, and they are having another massive wave now too."
18079,"Which alone kills the ""herd immunity at 20-30-whatever %"" theories, but they are also reporting a lot of reinfections too."
18080,There has been enough time for that to show up there.
18081,"When New York blows up seriously in December, we should expect to see lots of reinfections there too."
18082,"If we don't, then it is rare indeed."
18083,But the default assumption should always have been no lasting immunity.
18084,"For all the coronaviruses for which this has been studied, there is no lasting immunity."
18085,Why did we decide that this one will confer lifelong immunity even with an asymptomatic infection?
18086,On the basis of what evidence exactly when all the available facts point in the totally opposite direction?
18087,It's been posted a million times on this sub already.
18088,It's not a conspiracy.
18089,Reminder that metadrama is against sub rules.
18090,I want to believe
18091,Why?
18092,You offered first.
18093,"Is that you, Dr Venture?"
18094,"Here's my understanding of how non-medical masks work:

Virtually any barrier between an infected person and air will reduce the amount of pathogen in the air, although how much varies with the barrier."
18095,"Every exhalation we make has a relative humidity of close to 100% on average, which means a significant amount of exhaled virus is ""trapped"" in water droplets of all sizes."
18096,"If a mask blocks any of that moisture from moving into the air, it is better than not wearing it."
18097,because it was likely.
18098,"There are people dying or struggling with long term effects, but its definitely the minority."
18099,"I live in a state where 150 people died in July, with 100 or so coming from nursing homes and another 30 being from people over 50."
18100,That leaves 20.
18101,"The local newspaper highlighted one of these 20, a young mother of 2 who was only 25 years old."
18102,Articles like that perpetuate the myth that COVID is more dangerous than it is.
18103,"Yes, its truly dangerous, and I wouldn't want to roll the dice."
18104,"But if you do catch it, you're VERY likely to survive."
18105,"in my state, 7000 people have tested positive so far in October, and only 70 have died."
18106,there's a lag there but the math is still legit to say it roughly 1%.
18107,Damn you really wrote an essay as a Reddit comment that people won’t read
18108,"Well yes, but 11 days ago is still totally within the realm of one person's sickness."
18109,I'd suspect we have to wait longer than that to see the most results.

18189,"Well, there’s still hope and a chance!"

18234,"There are plenty of ""long covid"" ""sufferers"" out there who have never even tested positive once."
18235,There's no published evidence out there (which I can find) suggesting that the virus can lay dormant (like Varicella or Herpes).
18236,Nothing showing changes in structure or function of organs which could explain any of these symptoms.

18248,"It isn’t a rule the virus operates by; the more time you spend with an infected person, the higher your chances of getting infected are."

18267,I said at the beginning it will be 10+ years before we're back to normal.
18268,My bet is looking good so far.
18269,Here’s a curious coincidence.
18270,The 15 states with the highest rate of new cases per capita over the last 7 days all voted Trump in 2016.
18271,Source: www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html
18272,"I work in the industry, not on Broadway but in one of North America's largest theatre districts and this isn't news to anyone."
18273,Most people right now are taking film work (film workers are represented by the same union - IATSE - as Broadway workers) or retraining.
18274,I think there will be a lot less people making this their full-time career after the pandemic as the sheer vulnerability of the industry has been made very readily apparent.
18275,Most places are not seeing increases in their ICUs or hospitals.
18276,&gt;  Lose the election?

18281,"That may be, but it doesn't explain the massive instant drop in cases."
18282,Take it up with the GOP.
18283,They are the ones responsible for that.
18284,I thought Russia already got vaccines or what not
18285,Who gives a fuck what the windows guy thinks?
18286,Why do we listen to Billy boy and ignore the dozens of doctors at Stanford *screaming* (scientifically speaking) that lockdowns are causing much more harm than good.

18288,I understand your comment was made before that though.
18289,"&gt;but next summer everything will be back to normal, you can get shitfaced all you want with no mask."
18290,Don't make false promises about things you cannot possibly control.
18291,Shitty misinformation like this is a huge part of why this is a political issue and not a medical one in the U.S.
18292,No.
18293,Obesity is not as big a factor in mortality anymore.
18294,The Italian comorbidity data had it tenth in frequency.
18295,Hypertension was first at 60% percent.
18296,I suspect the association is between COVID mortality and obesity might really be a function of how many obese people also suffer from hypertension.
18297,Age is by far an away the biggest factor.
18298,I 1000% support our fearless leader unless I have a chance.
18299,Putin doesn’t have 90% approval.
18300,"The 90% is a psychological tactic to make it seem like most people support him, but if you know people that don’t, then they must be in the 10%."
18301,It works a lot less well with the internet.
18302,There are 5372 new cases of coronavirus in Italy.
18303,This was announced by the Ministry of Health.
18304,"In the last 24 hours, another 28 deaths have been recorded, bringing the total to 36,111 since the beginning of the emergency."
18305,"You should always be on the cusp of being out of ICU beds, that’s how the system is designed."
18306,What reason is there that you can’t expand your own ICU capacity?
18307,That’s somewhat normal procedure.
18308,You sending your overflow patients to other hospitals is another design of the system.
18309,New York was never overrun.
18310,Nobody in all of New York City at the height of flu and COVID had to go without the attention of a doctor or an ICU bed.
18311,Nobody has died of COVID yet because they couldn’t get a hospital bed or doctor.
18312,What makes Utah different today that this would happen?
18313,"And back in NY nobody knew anything was going on before this spread so everyone was still sharing everything like elevator space, subways and such."
18314,It was literally worst case scenario and yet nobody died because of being overrun.
18315,So...

18373,"For instance, Some people have been minimizing deaths from influenza viruses because they don't kill as many people as COVID."
18374,"The last few pandemics (Swine Flu, 1957 flu, Hong Kong flu) have all been from influenza viruses and sill killed people."
18375,1957 flu and the Hong Kong flu both killed masses of people--both have so far been deadlier globally than COVID--but no one remembers those deaths.
18376,"And today, people are still dying from other things that are not COVID but we've lost all perspective because all of the focus has been on COVID."
18377,We can be concerned about COVID while still remembering there are other problems in the world.
18378,We can mourn COVID deaths without acting like other deaths don't matter.
18379,I read somewhere that the cell receptor that COVID-19 attaches to becomes more common when you have higher levels of testosterone.
18380,"That's why children tend to not be effected as badly (fewer years of testosterone ""staining""), and men tend to fare worse than women."
18381,But I have no scientific papers for that.
18382,Take it with a heaping serving of salt.
18383,so how are these numbers relevant if the USA does more testing than Russia?
18384,[deleted]
18385,Can someone enlighten on how this compares to a redundancy package?
18386,USA: Hold my beer
18387,"That reminds me of a joke:

18388,"Doctor: ""Now he's exaggerating!"""
18389,"Buying time makes sense if there is something that is aimed for though, and endpoint."
18390,Just like Fourth of July?

18392,nebrec nulo
18393,They will if they're paid to lockdown.
18394,Creating more SPH orders without a substantial stimulus package is ludicrous.
18395,yep
18396,"At this point, the US numbers are just as trustworthy as Russia’s."
18397,must have meant us of a.
18398,A lot of chin diapers too.
18399,Ass
18400,It is sad.
18401,And we all know what we have to do.
18402,Hong Kong has certainly figured it out and they are one of the densest areas of the planet.
18403,"An outbreak of 40 cases in Hong Kong, and they start shutting things down."
18404,They also have about 90% mask compliance and extremely robust contact tracing.
18405,It really is that simple.
18406,"Not easy, but simple."
18407,"Sorry, not gonna happen."
18408,"The vaccine won’t be entirely effective, this thing will be spreading for decades."
18409,I’m staying away from the bars for now.
18410,Why is Carmen sandiago in the thumbnail?
18411,"&gt;Given that those that survive do so with severe vascular and lung damage even in mild cases

In what percentage of cases though?"
18412,Refusal to wear a mask needs to become a criminal offense.
18413,These people are not going to wear a mask EVER.
18414,It is time to start holding them accountable.
18415,"Look at things that can't realistically be falsified, like the total mortality."
18416,"Russia sits at 50-80k excess deaths in May-August, that gives us the scale."
18417,His approval rating is like in the 90s% - I don't think he cares.
18418,...even if it was a real democracy.
18419,"Besides, dead people can't vote against you either."
18420,"...at the end of the day, financial stability is more popular than supporting retirees."
18421,"Btw: If we assume herd immunity to be at 50 % and assume that reinfections can be neglected, at this pace (10 % over 7 months) it would take 2.3 more years to reach herd immunity."
18422,1k a day is more than entire countries.
18423,"Mexico City, Seoul, Shanghai, Jakarta, London all have comparable density and don’t have nearly as many cases."
18424,did the Russian vaccine flop hard?
18425,BIG STRONG NUMBERS!
18426,Make Putin winner!
18427,In mother Russia we’re number 1.

18435,Look up Africa's and South America's age distribution.
18436,Sounds like Star Trek's Borg.
18437,Very authoritarian....and direct.
18438,"My hope is that once the vaccine is available to the elderly and immunosuppressed people we lift all restrictions, because honestly risk is very, very low to anyone else."
18439,"At the very latest, all restrictions should be lifted once the vaccine is widely available."
18440,"Our man Fauci predicts that there should be enough vaccine doses for every American by April, so there’s that."
18441,Once the vaccine is widely available there is zero compelling reason to keep any restrictions.
18442,"If you are concerned about your risk, you need to get the vaccine, no excuses."
18443,"All restrictions come with risks and drawbacks, and it’s time to have a serious conversation about the cost-benefit analysis."
18444,Nope.
18445,"If they came true, Bill Gates knows what he's talking about."
18446,What?
18447,I am French and I am only pointing out the poor behavior of my fellow compatriots in the last couple of months.
18448,"I might also include myself, how is this racist?"
18449,Where are you in Tucson?

18452,"We know a thing or two, because we've seen a thing or two"
18453,"Africa is a continent where almost all people alive today are kids, South America is quite young as well."
18454,So a few percent of total world population might be possible without too many mass graves on TV.
18455,"Uganda has a median age below 16, for example."
18456,You.
18457,Are.
18458,Lying.
18459,No one is buying this bullshit anymore.
18460,Basically what went wrong is they believed shutdowns were a way to beat the virus.
18461,But the virus was still there the entire time.
18462,"So your shutdown is over, congrats - you must still be vigilant."
18463,"You must be vigilant until a widespread vaccine is developed, tested, manufactured, and administered."
18464,(Note : this is not going to happen before election day!)
18465,Australia has 25mil and has &gt;20 a day
18466,Wow.
18467,"That's equivalent to 113,000 new csses in the U.S. Our daily high is 77,000, which is a ton and puts in perspective how out of control it is in the Netherlands right now."
18468,&gt; Viruses mutate and get worse in the fall as people crowd inside.
18469,"&gt; 
&gt; 

Actually most viruses mutate to get less severe, since the mutations that get worse kill more people and spread less."
18470,"When the US had a count of less than 200k we were ""over budget"" in deaths for the year by about 250k."
18471,At least we have some idea.
18472,Years from now they should be able to run the numbers and get some idea at least.
18473,The lockdown was decent but we came out of it too quickly.
18474,No one wore a mask when it was over.
18475,Bars were packed.
18476,No real restrictions.
18477,Once the 5k cases a day hit the governor allowed counties and cities to create mask policies.
18478,He didn't even do it himself.
18479,But now mask wearing is good.
18480,They're shutting down bars that act stupid.
18481,So no more photos of packed bars in Scottsdale.
18482,Testing is pretty easy now so the numbers aren't that sus.
18483,So basically our governor crapped the bed and took credit after everyone else cleaned it up.
18484,Restrictions aren't working because people are ignoring them.
18485,Those people need to have criminal charges filed against them.
18486,"And you think you can just condescendingly argue this and expect me to check out the link, listen to your ego and change my mind?"
18487,That's adorable.
18488,Don’t assume that.
18489,"Where I served, only servers put together to-go orders."
18490,"We made tipped minimum wage, which is 5.44 in my state."
18491,So... what?
18492,deaths and hospitalizations have remained entirely flat.
18493,They had peaked on July 15.
18494,Everything is largely open.
18495,"I’ve been going to the dentist, going to restaurants, going to the gym, and grappling."
18496,I wear a mask indoors.
18497,I’m here in Miami.
18498,Why do we care about cases if it isn’t affecting health infrastructure?
18499,Wasn’t this what it was all about from the start?
18500,Not overwhelming hospitals?
18501,Yeah that's the thing people don't get.
18502,This is early stage one.
18503,We may open bars or whatnot but things aren't going back to normal completely for ten or more years.
18504,If there is anything left to look forward to.
18505,We are going to have an entire generation of traumatized healthcare workers.
18506,Hopefully there will be care offered to them in the future to help cope with this.
18507,Really?
18508,"You keep up with all the media around around the world, do you?"
18509,"Or are you just generalizing from your narrow slice of the picture, filtered through your particular political lens?"
18510,Inquiring minds want to know.
18511,"You think they're detecting all the real COVID deaths and then also overcounting in places like rural India and Brazil, eh?"
18512,"Sure, bud."
18513,"If only cancer was contagious, church would be the ideal place to go for it as well."
18514,What you people are doing is murder.
18515,There WILL be consequences for it.
18516,"While we do have our share of idiots, at least we don't have people licking shop doors to protect their freedoms."
18517,You know 1.5M people died from Tuberculosis last year?
18518,It’s nothing like the 1918 your just being silly
18519,All of that is either untrue or half-truth misinformation.
18520,Facts over feelings my friend.
18521,Yes and they were right.
18522,"I remember people here mocking the ""two weeks"" right up until deaths shot up in AZ, TX and FL."
18523,Then you didn‘t hear from them again for a good while.
18524,Bro you dropped your agenda over there...
18525,"The cloth masks function primarily to protect bystanders from the person with the mask, as I understand it."
18526,They also help some to protect the wearer.
18527,"An N95 or any mask with a valve functions to protect the wearer and does little for the bystander, again as I understand it."
18528,"Fauci, and Public health experts have said that a Vaccine will most likely be Widely available in April

https://www.silive.com/news/2020/09/us-health-officials-believe-coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-widely-available-by-april.html

And then we should have a return to normalcy around summer/fall next year."
18529,"In Soviet Russia, comment chains YOU!"
18530,But those people can shelter themselves.
18531,I am now at a point where I don't see why the rest of us have to suffer for it.
18532,Do you know the median age of a COVID death?
18533,"I could be mistaken, but it seems that a lot of serology reports that find high percentages of people with Covid antibodies (&gt;20%) tend to be from more densely populated areas."
18534,"If I'm not mistaken, this could have a few ramifications...

1."
18535,"Obviously, more people would be exposed to the virus in areas that are densely populated, especially areas that have public transportation like subways, buses, etc that are used by thousands every day."
18536,2.
18537,The amount of asymptomatic infections is cause for concern as they are still contagious.
18538,"The virus could be spread in communities/ groups that are less prone to developing any symptoms or if they do, symptoms that could be mistaken for seasonal allergies that a person wouldn't go out of their way to get a covid test for, this could go undetected for weeks and stealthily spread to more vulnerable communities and once the incubation period ends, thousands of people could start showing symptoms and moderate-severe disease in a short period of time, potentially overwhelming medical facilities and infrastructure which raises the fatality rate as medical resources are overwhelmed."
18539,"This could explain how explosive outbreaks in China, Italy, and elsewhere have come about and seemingly escalated so quickly."
18540,"\*\****THIS IS JUST AN IDEA OF MINE AND I'M NOT A VIROLOGIST OR MEDICAL EXPERT, JUST INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC, FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS, CRITICIZE, OR ADD YOUR THOUGHTS\*\****
3."
18541,"Exposure to lower viral loads may lead to antibody formation, milder/ asymptomatic cases, but not necessarily complete or even partial immunity to the virus, more study and research is needed in this regard."
18542,This is America's fault somehow.
18543,The 211k people who died were trying to live their lives too.
18544,This is fucking murder.
18545,1.
18546,Covid19 is much less deadly than the plague was (given you only had access to the medicine at the time.
18547,"Plague is much less deadly today given antibiotics exist)
2."
18548,The plague and the renaissance overlapped temporally in Europe.
18549,"The Renaissance is hardly a period of ""artistic drought"""
18550,"It’s not just East Asian countries, but I wanted to point out that Australia and New Zealand are also doing very well even though they are considered western culture too."

18552,"I didn’t cancel mine, but I haven’t gone."
18553,Mine is good until the end of next July with the credited time and bonus month.
18554,It was paid in full so I would only be getting a portion back.
18555,I don’t want to cancel mine because they’re not selling new passes and I want to be able to go next year.
18556,I already got my money’s worth out of it so it is what it is.
18557,I also only have the weekday select so the prorated refund I would get back wouldn’t be that much at all.
18558,I’ve been watching vloggers though and the lines aren’t that long.
18559,"Because there’s no fast pass, they can fill all the queue space."
18560,"The criticism is now that capacity has increased, the wait times have gone up."
18561,Then why are you in favor of COVID restrictions?
18562,Cases with positivity rates.
18563,This gives you an idea of how many people got it and how bad your hospitals are gonna get hit.
18564,"Yes, deaths absolutely matter but to only focus on deaths doesn't tell the story of Covid."
18565,Some of these countries' healthcare systems are on the verge of collapse and then it won't only be Covid that's killing everyone.
18566,Nope Hawaii has gotten away with it’s illegal enforcement but nobody else.
18567,Also you realize it’s all an honor system right?
18568,Yeah I’m pretty sure your company is violating guidelines and the clinic or place where they were tested should inform employees and the employer of this.
18569,I really don’t get how companies think endangering the health of employees and making them work with that is helping either party.
18570,Makes no sense.
18571,I can't imagine anyone not thinking it's cool.
18572,Especially with the matching mask.
18573,You ever dookie so hard your ears pop?
18574,Good luck with that cancer diagnosis.
18575,There‘s a significant lag.
18576,"According to the Robert Koch Institut, it‘s about 17 days from first symptoms to death."
18577,"Add to that the incubation time, you get a lag of about three weeks."
18578,"Also, look at when cases and deaths peaked in the second wave in the US."
18579,More than a month between the peaks.
18580,Yeah
18581,Summer 2021 you will see a return to normalcy.
18582,There will be enough Vaccine to go around
18583,"Wow, imagine how bad it would be if they didn't already have the vaccine."
18584,If nobody is getting tested that probably means almost nobody has the virus and your claim of artificially low case counts is baseless and false.
18585,Why do people like you want the virus to be more rampant and widespread than it really is?
18586,It's so confusing.
18587,40 km/h is 24.85 mph
18588,"NGL, lady in red looks like a bad ass GI Joe villain."
18589,&gt;So do you enter any buildings?
18590,"For instance, groceries or doctors office, etc?"
18591,Yep.
18592,"I do try to stock up, and I do try to go when folks at risk shouldn't be there."
18593,The main way I'm careful is by not taking any chance at all of infecting those I love.
18594,"I'm not looking forward to Covid-19, but I think it's pretty inevitable I'll get it."
18595,I feel you.
18596,But you’re aware that trump is the most misquoted president ever right?
18597,Also the president with the most severe media coverage bias ever.
18598,"This man got rid of all our top generals, who had been pushing their own agendas for years and pushing around previous administrations like Obama."
18599,This man called out the intelligence community.
18600,Do you know what kind of enemy the intelligence community can become if you piss them off?
18601,"Since the 60s they’ve known how to influence public opinion one way or the other, and now they’re partisan."
18602,"The whole Russia collusion thing that dominated the first half of his presidency, it just became declassified that the source of that info was the Clinton campaign, not US intelligence."
18603,And that the FBI ran with it even though they knew it was fake.
18604,In addition the Obama/biden administration OPENLY spied on the trump campaign (based on Clinton’s false accusations of collusion) and then continued to do so even after he was elected!
18605,So hate trump or not for his personality or demeanor... but what i hate more is cheaters.. dirty liars and cheaters who will do or say anything for power or a vote.
18606,"The BLM funds haven’t gone back to the black communities, in fact the first thing they did was join a network of DNC funds that give democratic campaigns across the country unlimited access to the $billion+ that BLM has misleadingly collected."
18607,The left is disgusting.
18608,"Sure Trump is an asshole, I know this."
18609,But there’s way bigger assholes on the left.
18610,Assholes that want to make radical changes to the fundamentals of this country.. for their personal gain.
18611,"Don’t go by your feelings, go by the facts."
18612,"If you have any doubts, I implore you to fact check this so that you may confirm the info yourself."
18613,If you have trouble with that I can help you out.
18614,The divisiveness in this country is rooted and perpetuated in and from the left lurching media.

18625,It is more because you people cannot be trusted to behave without lockdown than what ever conspiracy you are subscribing to here.
18626,This is a pure intelligence and self control issue.
18627,"If you all were intelligent enough to understand the science, and had the self control to act on that understanding, we would be in much better shape."
18628,"But no, here you are trying to make things worse."
18629,I’m curious to find out how much money was actually collected from fines like these after the pandemic is over with.
18630,I think a lot of these will get reduced if they are even challenged in court.
18631,"$15k is a lot, but at least it’s not like the $400k fine that one guy revived when he was supposed to drive to Alaska but was sightseeing in Canada instead."
18632,"We can live with the virus without living with mass outbreaks and overwhelmed ICUs, just look at Sweden and Germany."
18633,Sweden never once had overwhelmed hospitals--at one point they were even taking in patients from other countries!--and Germany ensured that they would have more than enough ICU beds if needed.
18634,Ok so if deaths don’t skyrocket next week we’re good?
18635,"Btw I don’t mean skyrocket in the way the media defines it (an increase of 1 or more), I’m talking about an actual uptick in excess deaths."
18636,Actually wish they were two separate things
18637,Hahahahahahaha you think we are the pinnacle of truth!?
18638,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA fucking moron!
18639,It could be that the basic virus was everywhere but the mutation in Wuhan was particularly infectious
18640,I have no problem with that.
18641,"That’s not an easy or cheap solution, the government would have to provide housing and meal delivery for elderly people who currently live with family members who work (a huge percentage of elders in the US)."
18642,It would cost a lot more and take a lot longer to set up than I think you’re aware.
18643,"By a time that any program to actually isolate and protect the elderly was set up and funded, the pandemic may be waning already."
18644,"I mean, I didn’t, but since we’re talking about the US as a whole (which it clearly isn’t right now), yes we did elect him in."
18645,Not doing simple easy things to protect ourselves and others has cost the US dearly.
18646,those are rookie numbers Czechia had 5500 for yesterday with population of 10 million.

18703,"Dude really likes quarantine, eh?"
18704,"Nah “muh dude”, you’re just a typical douchebag Canadian that can’t admit you’re fucked."
18705,You came in like a douchebag that your city had it under control.
18706,You don’t.
18707,You didn’t.
18708,"So enjoy your lockdown Muh dude

Meanwhile we’re not in lockdown with less cases daily."
18709,Now who’s the fuck up ?
18710,What industry are you in?
18711,"My team has been functioning very well, but there have been some  blips with new hires and low level employees as well."
18712,"That being said, I’m not sure if it’s the work from home that’s causing the problem."
18713,There will always be those times.
18714,I think there are some cultural shifts that are happening that will need some different management approaches.
18715,"I have one guy on my team that I’ve been seeing him sort of slipping, but he also just had a kid as well."
18716,"Sometimes it’s just a matter of a conversation, while sometimes it’s a legit problem employee or poor choice of hire."
18717,He may not be on the ballot but vote!
18718,There **are** enablers on the ballot for 2020.
18719,Let them know how you feel.
18720,So you're saying it's likely to kill you?
18721,Get your brain checked.
18722,#surprised
18723,Lol you have community spread right now.
18724,Keep blaming the states
18725,"it was actually very slow this time, cases have been increasing since months ago, the decisions of let this happen were made long ago."
18726,in most europe the only objetive is that healthcare doesnt collapse
18727,You are just like them then.
18728,Agreed.
18729,We've got the same issues as everyone else.
18730,"People got tired of the rules, there are quite a few sceptics, deniers and conspiracy theorists and lower temperatures."
18731,All in all we had a lot of low level clusters for a while which escalated now.
18732,I'm honestly surprised it took this long.
18733,Guess it's because we aren't a typical tourist destination and it spread among younger people first.
18734,That also happened in march and was probably one of the big reasons our death toll is so low
18735,No it's not.
18736,Not even close to warrant any lockdown.
18737,Hospitals are not feeling any strain on capacity.
18738,And people aren't getting infected in bars and restaurants.
18739,There's no reason to close them.
18740,It wouldn't have any noticeable effect.
18741,Most people are already working from home in France.
18742,French cities with rising numbers have already implemented new measures and the infections rates will soon start going down again.
18743,None of that information was obscured before he was voted for in a landslide
18744,That woman in red looks totally awesome btw!
18745,She is killing that bright red mask and trenchcoat ansamble 😁
18746,That the US has more than 10% of the population that has had or currently had covid.
18747,"Why it is better:
How inexpensive, at-home, COVID-19 screening tests (results in 15 minutes with a nasal or saliva sample) could be utilized to dramatically slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic (and open up schools etc."
18748,in a faster and safer way).
18749,The research of Harvard epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina and others has shown that COVID 19 test frequency and availability is much more important than test sensitivity (the ability of a test to pick up low levels of virus).
18750,See our previous MedCram videos that have featured Dr. Mina's research about COVID 19 testing and how quickly identifying individuals who are contagious (and who have high levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus) should be the primary focus.
18751,"Kyle Allred, Dr. Seheult, and MedCram have no financial disclosures related to this topic."
18752,We have a keen interest in curbing this pandemic and safely re-opening schools and our economy.

18760,And we don't even have to vaccinate the whole country!
18761,I’m in an at-risk group: same!
18762,&gt; it's highly unlikely to kill you.
18763,This is misinformation.
18764,The case increases in Canada are because of the states?
18765,Did the states force Canada to open their bars?
18766,How many teacher deaths tied directly (or even loosely) to in person instruction?
18767,?
18768,Quebec has a 700k population my dude.
18769,You previously claimed we had 3x your population.
18770,"The whole world is in a depression, and Canada actually has a quick road to recovery than the US, even though our economy has a deflated energy sector."
18771,Go back to school my man.
18772,"Oh wait, we get that free here too and you don’t."
18773,&gt;May i ask where in Russia you live?
18774,"I live in Nizhny Novgorod, that's the 6th largest Russian city (1.25 million) 400 km east of Moscow."
18775,"Basically, Central Russia."
18776,"&gt;As far as I can tell, the further east in Russia you are the less western politics affect you."
18777,I wouldn't say so.
18778,"Despite its size, Russia is pretty homogeneous, there isn't a huge East–West divide."
18779,I'd say the main divide is between large cities and rural areas.
18780,"The more rural you go, the poorer people become, and the less they care about anything but surviving."
18781,"City dwellers are generally more interested in broad variety things, including the global politics."
18782,"They travel more, they buy more foreign products, and they're more likely to be directly affected."
18783,"For example, I'm directly affected by the US–Russia relations because I want to get a new US visa, and the current situation makes it extremely difficult for me."
18784,But 99% of Russians won't ever need a US visa.
18785,"&gt;I don't know if you have any political aspirations, but part of me hopes you do."
18786,"I'm a theoretical physicist, I think fully diving into politics would be a waste of my skills (although Dr. Merkel would disagree)."
18787,"But I'm interested in politics, and I try to support opposition politicians, at least with donations."
18788,I might get involved in something on the local level in the future.
18789,&gt;idea in the states that anyone going into Russian politics automatically has a target on their head.
18790,Do you think that is accurate?
18791,"Yes, to some degree."
18792,"If you publicly go against the Russian government, you constantly risk your money and your freedom."
18793,"You'll be fined or jailed for ~15 days for some nonsense from time to time, you might get problems with your career or studies (like expelled from the university), your devices will be confiscated by the authorities, etc."
18794,"If you're unlucky, you might get accused of some criminal offense and jailed for a longer time."
18795,"In rare cases, when you become too noticeable and troublesome, like Navalny, you also risk your health and your life."
18796,"That's a risk one takes when choosing this path, there're no illusions."
18797,"But it's not as dangerous as some Westerners think, Putin is no Stalin, and he doesn't just straight up kill every person opposing him, he generally prefers using the legislation."
18798,&gt;Does it only pertain to those going against Putting?
18799,"If you're loyal to Putin, you can get pretty far, as far as your conscience allows."
18800,"But taking the side of an autocrat is not really politics, that's more like servitude."
18801,&gt;I'd like to get some free comment karma so that I can comment in r/Coronavirus.
18802,"Gee, where have I seen that before"
18803,"Francois Holland the one before him takes some beating in the unpopularity stake as well, phenomenal achievement by macron the glove puppet for goldman sachs."
18804,seems to be increasing evidence this disease is far less deadly than the media and WHO originally assumed
18805,Live here its uncontrolled spread and not an official doing a fucking thing.
18806,I live in most liberal county and the health department just opened up attendance at sporting events.
18807,We had about 400 new cases in 1 week.
18808,Test positivity has gone from &lt;5 to over 10.
18809,"Thanks Bullock for saying ""its a county issue, and Im not dong shit"" Hes getting dangerously close to losing votes with his BS."
18810,Isn’t this a bleeding obvious consequence of the first lockdown?
18811,"Unless you rigorously rest, accept some collateral damage and try to build herd immunity, waves like these will keep coming every season."
18812,"Lambeau hasn't allowed any fans in, how are they remotely to blame."
18813,That argument is entirely circular.
18814,"Because if you’re vaccinating people at risk the pandemic literally ends because the death rate would be minuscule, which is expected to happen late this year/early next year"
18815,Did you read?
18816,"I am not doubting the relationship between current cases/future hospitalizations, and in the most unfortunate of circumstances, future deaths."
18817,To use your language.
18818,No one is questioning that.
18819,Literally everyone agrees there is some correlation there.
18820,And it is continued bigotry to assume others are not concerned for the health and well-being of those around them.
18821,"Anyways, be well, and hope for the best for you and your loved ones."
18822,Just listened to a podcast on this.
18823,Wish I could remember which one.
18824,Cold viruses can lay dormant in your body for months
18825,Better hope the fire is nice enough to let them get to you quick enough
18826,Id take the job for $100kusd/6mo.
18827,But I literally could do nothing for you in isolation.
18828,[deleted]
18829,"Nah, it wouldn’t be that."
18830,It’s not a sunny country at all.
18831,Cloudy grey skies much of the year.
18832,"Probably more due to better overall cardiovascular health, or maybe just genetic factors."
18833,Dude what are you talking about?
18834,"First of all, saying Germany ""doesn't test post mortem"" is a straight up lie."
18835,"And based on excess deaths vs coronavirus deaths Germany seems to be very accurate in their reporting, perhaps more accurate than any other country in europe."
18836,"Excess deaths statistics don't lie, and they are **so much** worse in France compared to Germany, that's an undeniable fact."
18837,"And yet y’all are still in a recession 


https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/economists-agree-canada-is-in-a-recession-but-there-s-little-consensus-on-why-1.5083731

Your own prime minister admits y’all are a bunch of selfish fucks propagating the virus."
18838,"So yeah, my city with 1.5 million people has less daily cases than your city."
18839,Probably because the citizens are dipshits like yourself.
18840,Have a nice day !
18841,And yet you still haven't explained why that is.
18842,"Children of men coming soon....


Prophetic before pandemic even more prophetic now."
18843,I think they tried to reopen like dummies.
18844,Only way to beat this virus is to stay locked down until a vaccine comes out.
18845,"I didn't address anythign you said when the entire thing you said was ""weird response lol""?"
18846,"Listen, I'm trying to understand the punt you are trying to make."
18847,How about you make that easy instead of trying to avoid it?
18848,Lockdowns work beautifully.
18849,"Combine with solid contact tracing, and your populace not being jerks, and you can just wipe it out entirely."
18850,We just cleared the last community transmission case here in the second outbreak.
18851,"macron works for goldman sachs  His job was to make sure the photocopier at Goldman Sachs never ran out of a4, and he is married to a molester."
18852,What use was he before covid never mind during covid?
18853,The French probably already thought he was a disaster as soon as he was positioned in power like a glove puppet - now they know it.
18854,"weird, my country did it and we have a fraction of the cases the States has per capita."
18855,TIL canada is a dictatorship
18856,Counterpoint: it does not defy logic
18857,Europe needs to take this virus seriously.
18858,Why don’t they just wear masks?
18859,&gt; I mean if you're trapped in your room during a fire anywhere you'll probably die anyway.
18860,Not necessarily if you have nearby neighbors who can call for help.
18861,And not if fire responders are a few minutes away.
18862,In 3 months he's going to be complaining about how isolation is more dangerous than covid.
18863,Foresight is not the strong suit of these people.
18864,Fuuuuck.
18865,I...don't.
18866,I'm asking a question because I'm baffled at that statement.
18867,It defies logic - hence me asking for an explanation.
18868,"They were able to shut down the border with Italy which helped them but in reality, no country that trusts china has this contained properly."
18869,Countries close to China don't trust a single word CCP says and were monitoring Wuhan much earlier.
18870,Africa has a very young population that allows them to be infected and show no symptoms.
18871,Latin America is reporting record numbers.
18872,Canada also started showing a spike and Toronto is shutting things down again.
18873,Middle East doesn't have the international foot traffic of the EU or America.
18874,India can't do anything because of population density.
18875,It probably does work pretty well.
18876,"only issue here is jersey Chris will never be ""important"" enough to get a dose."
18877,"No recession, and their curve is bent."
18878,"Given that she and her husband both had it in “late summer” (nothing more specific), there have been whispers that an offspring or two at the Rose Garden party might have participated in the super-spreading event there."
18879,"Me too, they were my hope for the winter."
18880,This shit seems to be impossible to contain unless you eradicate it completely.
18881,And even then it makes an occasional comeback with frozen fish.
18882,waaaa?
18883,I know what a dumb investment you might as well burn your money.
18884,In 200 years it will be gone what a dumb investment
18885,Tell me again how covid cases are trumps fault here in American when this kind of stuff is happening all over the world?
18886,My parents are brainwashed idiots too...
18887,How about it’s better to NOT get this than intentionally give it to yourself?
18888,Also who exactly is moving goalposts?
18889,What authority is controlling people here?
18890,Seems to me like authority is on the side of “hey let’s give everyone the virus because it’s no big deal yolo” to be honest.
18891,[removed]
18892,"Drunk drivers kill people all the time, my third grade teacher’s father was killed by a drunk driver, I think we all know of someone who was affected by it"
18893,She didn’t come up with the policy.
18894,She’s just doing her job.
18895,What a piece of shit.
18896,Ideally we should never reopen Broadway.
18897,"I'm obese, but I've also been working the whole time, in front of a computer, while work has been pretty stressful."
18898,"We've been going on as many hikes as we can manage (3 just this week, walked 4 miles yesterday), but I've only lost a few pounds."
18899,I need to do more somehow.
18900,"We have started eating more low carb recently, so maybe that will help."
18901,"I did full on keto a couple years back and lost 45 lbs, but my triglyceride and cholesterol levels got dangerously high and once I was off it I quickly gained all the weight back and then some."
18902,They only work if people wear them.
18903,The biggest problem I’ve seen is that even people who take masks seriously out in public let their guard down and take their masks off around close friends and family and that’s where the biggest spread is happening aside from the workplace.
18904,What about going through winter if we look at it as a season through early March?
18905,Like a year after it started here in the US.
18906,This here.
18907,Where I live they were very transparent about that in March/April.
18908,"The advise for any ill person was to stay at home, self isolate and only seek medical attention when needed."
18909,"They knew that all those mild COVID-19 people were under the radar, but that was okay back then."
18910,"If you can neither test nor treat all of them, why bother?"
18911,Luckily it's different now.
18912,But: Numbers in Europe still grow exponentially.
18913,That has to stop sooner rather than later.
18914,Nope.
18915,Just you.
18916,"Sure those are real problems, but also bad excuses."
18917,You can't compare numbers until it's over
18918,My wife is in a similar line of work and I really feel for you.
18919,"The biggest issues she's running into is that performers aren't on tour, there are all kind of licensing issues with internet broadcasts, and there isn't money for major infrastructure upgrades to facilitate it, anyways (just getting internet coverage to allow for credit card transactions at all entrances was a big accomplishment)."
18920,"Then there are county vs. state health health department, vague guidelines, and liability."
18921,"And the big one is that even in a normal year, donors and advertisers keep things going, not ticket revenue."
18922,"The kind of businesses that would normally cut a $50,000 check or a local restaurant that would $1,000 catering for free, just can't right now."
18923,The entire model is broken right now.
18924,"Hospitalizations are also rising quickly, around 1k at the start of September, now 4k with a very much noticeable positive slope: [https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)."
18925,Basically the same story in lots of European countries.
18926,And we've just entered fall.
18927,Fuck me.
18928,"Czechs are champions in not giving a fuck :D

Unless they do, then they do give all the fucks."
18929,But usally they do not.
18930,Opening in fall?
18931,The season where cases of viruses tend to rise?
18932,They won't be open till Q2 2022 at the bare minimum.
18933,Just use power point so you can presentation too
18934,Holy shit batman.
18935,"Starter: our study of &gt;5000 critically ill patients with COVID19 - 14% (701) had a cardiac arrest, resuscitation was attempted on 57% (400), and of those only 12% (48) survived till discharge with only 7% (28) had normal or near normal neurological function at discharge."
18936,The most common cause of cardiac arrest were non shockable rhythms (abnormal rhythms that you cannot shock someone out of).
18937,Implications - cardiac arrest in critically ill patients with COVID19 has high mortality.
18938,This isn’t a surprise to anyone but having data to discuss with patients is valuable.
18939,Further this group is somewhat selected as 43% of patients who had cardiac arrest had preexisting do not attempt resuscitation requests - the strongest predictor of this was increasing age.
18940,Initially there was discussion of broadened do not resuscitate orders - our study suggests that selected patients (young healthier patients) have a reasonable chance of survival though the outlook is dismal for older patients.
18941,Then don't go.
18942,Nobody is forcing you.
18943,"https://foeaction.org/news/no-fossil-fuel-money-coalition-members-call-bidens-questionable-fundraising-practices/

False."
18944,That's what the virus said.
18945,"funny how it wasn't the ""snowflakes"" who are offended to the point of cancelling things"
18946,what does that have to do with Utah.
18947,"Agreed, and it's not like you're going to suddenly overdose in a day or a week, the levels take time to build up and the safe range is fairly large."
18948,"So once the levels get upto a good amount, you can back off on the supplementation according to what the doctor recommends."
18949,"Most people are deficient, especially so in colder climates."
18950,"Not only that there are forms of the vitamin that you can take which the body converts to active form as needed, so the risk is cut down even more."
18951,"https://youtu.be/A71lfXrQlxU

Have a look!"
18952,I am Western Australian and we have not had anything like the restrictions the east coast of Australia have had particularly Victoria .I had two weeks at home in Western Australia in early April due to unknown (to me) contact with a returned overseas travelers who developed a slight  fever ( not covid)and that is it .Otherwise life is mostly normal and better than  good here with zero cases in 6 months .
18953,"Just want to say I'm pretty impressed by how the bigger citys  Melbourne and Sydney have held it together over there.The vast majority have just accepted restrictions and  what needs to be done without much fuss and self entitlement.The virus seems to just be stuborn ,pesky and just hanging in single daily didget  numbers atm.Sydneys contract tracing work and testing looks great from here."
18954,You forgot the /s
18955,There is no reason to think the vaccine wouldn't be somewhat effective on overweight patients.
18956,Elderly patients are more problematic because their immune systems are often worn out.
18957,There are so many intelligent individuals in america yet u guys voted for trump thats confusing
18958,You mean drunk driving is the same danger when it s not punished?
18959,I don t think so but i m not sure...
18960,I now rules got broken but it limits sometimes the bad outcome.
18961,Idk mid 30s... Maybe young maybe old?
18962,I know Smoking laws and increased taxes decreased the amount of smoking.
18963,"Sorry for my englisg

Maybe i written too confus/incoherent?"
18964,"If you're on a call and can't hear a COVID cough, does it make a sound?"
18965,In that case triage is much better.
18966,"People that don't give a fuck and are in high risk die, people that are at risk bunker up and the people that don't care and shouldn't care build up immunity."
18967,"Some people wanna bunker up, go ahead."
18968,Don't make everybody do it.
18969,One of the largest measles outbreaks was linked to Disneyland.
18970,We know theme parks have the possibility to be super spreader events.
18971,The parks should stay closed.
18972,But the energy companies aren’t donating to the Dems...
18973,That's one way to find out if herd immunity works
18974,Some states are already removing all restrictions and we don’t even have a vaccine or antibody treatments yet.
18975,"It’ll take a little bit to roll out, but the end of Q1 2021 will look a lot different than now."
18976,aaaaand it successfully did it today - 1487.
18977,I wonder why he wasn't up for fact comparison.
18978,Sorry your family isn't more understanding.
18979,We're doing a lot more phone calls.
18980,I know holidays will make it harder.

18982,My step mom called me last night.
18983,"She's the DNC chair for her county, the highest per capita covid in the state."
18984,"She wanted our opinion on what to do to keep her volunteer poll workers, monitors, and driver's to get out the vote safe - I felt really bad."
18985,They can't even require people to mask to vote.
18986,It's considered voter suppression.
18987,"Nonsense, it's 0.4%."
18988,Dude I am currently in a sorority.
18989,Our house is LOCKED DOWN and bc of national oversight we could get closed down if we so much as hang out with too many people.
18990,"Everything is online, no events in person."
18991,Don’t lecture me on what sororities are like.
18992,I'm concerned with my area and restaurants.
18993,All the restaurants have done their best to fit in some form of outdoor seating to stay open.
18994,Now the weather is getting cold and snow will be here soon.
18995,"There will be a push for people to eat inside, especially given the very real quarantine fatigue you mention."
18996,Not good while a second wave strikes.

18998,"I honesty don’t care if you think I’m stupid, I know that I believe in a society that is mature, courageous and flourishing."

19003,"* if predictions don't come true, Bill Gates is talking out of his ass

19005,"They just won’t publicly stand up to him (at least not until he *after* he’s fired them or thrown them under the bus) because they’re either A) scared he’ll tweet about them and ruin their career, B) terrible people themselves who think he’s a useful idiot to accomplish their conservative goals, or C) all of the above."
19006,Yeah why is anyone still listening to that guy.
19007,We all know what we have to do **if** we want to suppress cases.
19008,It's clear that many people do not and would rather take the risk.
19009,That's an outcome that needs to be discussed.
19010,"also as last time, the evening before the lockdown, soo yesterday, bars were packed with people."
19011,same scenario as last time
19012,Just reduce testing and you can get the cfr as high as you want.

19014,"At current rates, we are on pace to reach 300k deaths by the end of the year - so that’s not a stretch."
19015,"To get to 400k by end of year we will need to average 2,169 deaths per day starting today."
19016,Things will need to get very bad very quickly to get to 400k.
19017, Have you even gone to college?
19018,Sororities have social events and non sanctioned parties.
19019,They are also hiding test results so they don't have to go to an isolation dorm.

19024,"If you have it and are going to the gym within that 14 day time, you are a danger to everyone you come in contact with, including your father."
19025,Wearing a mask shouldn't factor in if you know you're COVID-positive.
19026,"It's an easy question: do you want to take a chance and be responsible for possibly indirectly killing your father indirectly, or can you wait 14 days and resume life after that?"
19027,That's insane.
19028,The Russian vaccine is on phase 3 trials involving 40 thousand people.
19029,The population of Russia is 145 million people.
19030,"Redefining words to have special meaning creates real life problems, it’s not even reasonable to expect professionals and institutions to fix those problems for you."
19031,A woman is a female and females can gives birth.
19032,That is the only definition of a woman that’s isn’t just a pile of sexist stereotypes.
19033,"Doctors aren’t telling you to wear lipstick when they want to acknowledge you as female, it’s biology."
19034,trans activists have spent years being able to create a legal fiction about their biology and are surprised when it screws up their care.
19035,Half of those arguments are based on nonsense like the myth that every trans person has their reproductive biology removed or that biological sex is somehow not real or certain.
19036,You got over your ideology enough to get pregnant and Robert Eads still had ovaries.
19037,Biology is real and making legal fictions doesn’t actually help anyone.
19038,Here's the problem.
19039,The people advocating reopening in the U.S. have no plans to fund or put any of this stuff in place on a national scale.
19040,These things need to be in place before anything else happens or you just end up with delayed spread to the vulnerable anyway.
19041,Where is this national home delivery program available to all seniors and the 1/3 of Americans that carry high risk conditions?
19042,The national senior hours mandates?
19043,National N95 supply for the vulnerable?
19044,National temporary housing plan for multigenerational households?
19045,"If anything, this exposes those advocating reopening in the absence of these measures as cruel and/or delusional."
19046,&gt;Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19.
19047,"By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors."
19048,Staff rotation should be minimized.
19049,Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home.
19050,"When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside."
19051,"A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals."
19052,Or anywhere else mostly...
19053,Idk high blood pressure isn t good.
19054,But nvm only my gf is for me really important (all other people also but tbh my gf is the main purpose) Thats why i signed up for 1daysooner (human trial where you get the vaccine and afterwards get on purpose infected).
19055,Didn t think they need me but I would take the risk.
19056,So let s wait lf they need me before we talk this negative topic and just stay (not corona) positive.
19057,"On one day everything will be fine again, let s do what we can that we and as many as possible experience this day."
19058,Wake up to what you have while it's not to late.
19059,"At every step you could find something more to wish for, but don't forget the gift of being alive right now."
19060,Yes the very second vulnerable people have the opportunity to get a vaccine I am not doing anything to stop anything any more.
19061,"Then it is over, I'm getting my life back and anyone complaining about it can suck it."
19062,Nope
19063,"Two reasons:

- Madrid is overrepresented  in new cases and deaths on the national level."
19064,"- Other regional governments are taking measures on their own accord, following the national guidelines."
19065,"For example, Castilla y León has just locked down the cities of León and Palencia."
19066,"However, the regional government of Madrid has refused to comply, forcing the suspension of previous measures by a court."
19067,"Without the proclamation of the State of Alarm, the central government can't legally impose those measures in Madrid."
19068,Nobody gives a fuck here anyways...
19069,Black (death) Friday.
19070,Shame on you for thinking that any of these deaths are deliberate or not mourned for.
19071,It’s a global fucking tragedy and every country is trying their best.
19072,Have the humility that your own immaturity and lack of understanding mean that you maybe shouldn’t label people as perpetrators of mass homicide.
19073,Jesus christ.
19074,Human trash.
19075,Trump making masks a political issue has probably killed a lot of people.
19076,He is still unwilling to say he was wrong.
19077,You need to eat.
19078,I went through a period like that where I barely ate anything and lost weight.
19079,When that period was over it ruined my metabolism and now I’m overweight and can’t seem to go back to average weight.
19080,Do you not understand that the pandemic isn't gone if you maintain restrictions until eternity or a vaccine?
19081,How does their overall death rate compare to countries that neighbor them?
19082,[removed]
19083,Very important clarification
19084,"Because of mask wearing people get infected with lower doses of the virus, giving the immune system more time to adapt."
19085,it’s okay we also stopped tracking it properly in many places so it’s okay /s
19086,Imagine how many they aren’t lying about..
19087,"don't worry, we've moved the goalposts from ""kills you"" to ""life long crippling illness""."
19088,what's the prevalence of the latter?
19089,"no one really wants to say, but you should be afraid anyway."
19090,FEAAAAAR!
19091,GHOST NOISES!
19092,The coronavirus proves to be a test of intelligence and decency.
19093,"This customer failed miserably, but he seems to be in good company of around 20-40 % of people in any country."
19094,Why are people like this?
19095,"Seriously, don't do this."
19096,"As much as I have my doubts over their vaccine - they haven’t claimed to have given it to most of the population yet, right?"
19097,It's worked phenomenally well with both drunk driving and smoking.
19098,You must be young.
19099,Cept people in japan actually follows government guidelines.
19100,The government guidelines have been unambiguous.
19101,They’ve had prior experience dealing with SARs and avian flu from their neighbors.
19102,Their aging population recognizes the seriousness of the risk better.
19103,The US Southern Hemisphere is mostly Trump country.
19104,Big difference.
19105,Sounds about right.
19106,The type of person who refuses to follow restaurant policy or give a damn for fellow humans is a piece of shit.
19107,"People who are not wearing masks in public are scientifically-illiterate morons, assholes or both."
19108,"I'm not saying you are stupid, I'm just saying there's no proof you aren't."
19109,I think the approach Slaoui is taking is good too and might wind up quicker - he's just saying you shouldn't apply for an EUA until you have millions of doses manufactured and ready to go - that way there's no disappointment from a lag between announcing an EUA and actual availability.
19110,Great job!
19111,That's a big accomplishment.
19112,Keep it up!
19113,Take care and stay safe.
19114,"well, considering around 8,000 people dies each day it does bring into perspective that Covid death is not as deadly as people think."
19115,Scientists have a different definition of airborne.
19116,The distinction is less relevant to the rest of us.
19117,And the distances mentioned are more for public health standards than science; back in April Japanese research showed the virus can travel 28 feet indoors but that isn't really helpful if anyone is to be allowed to go grocery shopping at all.
19118,It isn't slander
19119,I'm not the most tactful it's true.
19120,I'm not saying it in the sense that people don't have a stake in their own health.
19121,I can see how it comes off that way.
19122,I'm saying it in the sense this is ongoing theoretical science and not formed public policy.
19123,"Politicians, clinicians and leaders in general are not making decisions on what to do for the people, patients, constituents and real life based on a scientific opinion in The Lancet that is focused on one facet of a very complicated society."
19124,They take that information as one piece of a much larger puzzle.
19125,So the general public should not worry that these types of opinion pieces in journals are implementable policy.
19126,"I see, take care"
19127,"This is what have happened here, but still is dangerous because 2000 cases with 1% lethality is the same in terms of deaths as 4000 with 0,5% lethality."
19128,Just apply military triage and let people make their own decisions.
19129,"Fatality lags, why still can't people understand this"
19130,"In areas where people are social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks, I expect the flu will be far less."
19131,"But in areas that feel wearing a mask is rare, I think you are correct and the flu could have a compounding effect."
19132,Sources?

19141,"A lot of his critics have and discuss his failures there and his agenda, yet they are downvoted reflexively whereas people here promote Gates uncritically because he is critical of the US administration's response."
19142,Gates is an unaccountable billionaire who seeks to influence public health policy globally.
19143,He is the largest funder of the WHO after the United States.
19144,"That should make people more critical, not less."
19145,"As for the Musk analogy, there is a reason we don't let Elon Musk set transportation policy or to run the space programme."

19153,4000 Chinese and 3000 American enters Korea every month.
19154,"Yet, China exports 5 cases in over 4 months whilst US is exporting cases to Korea on a almost daily basis"
19155,It's not.
19156,It's people not caring anymore.
19157,Why do you think covid surged in the southern hemisphere at the beginning of the year?
19158,Same with India.
19159,"Once restrictions were lifted, Europe went into a ""second wave""."
19160,"Then, we have Southern states surging during Summer."
19161,Flu viruses don't do that.
19162,"While I think Fauci is probably giving projections based on current policy and case rates, I have a gut feeling this is a low ball."
19163,States can roll back restrictions and compounding factors like increased homelessness from evictions feel like they could make this look overly optimistic.
19164,Exactly - what is the point specifically?
19165,It doesn’t?!
19166,"Well fuck, at least I’ve enjoyed all the weed I’ve smoked over the last few months."
19167,Lol
19168,"It ain’t rocket science... I’ve been advocating for masks since January and the bulk of America thought I was crazy 🙄

They claimed the science from China as flakey and lacked sample data...

19170,"Thank you,I appreciate your kind words."
19171,Golf fwend!
19172,"Seriously, no one is actually friends with Trump."
19173,Just another asshole sucking up to king asshole to get a shitload of money.
19174,The want to do this because they are after an accurate number?
19175,Or they have a goal to somehow use this to beat once and for all Covid￼19 in Czechia?
19176,"IMO it would be cheaper  putting the population in cloth face coverings when mixing with others in enclosed spaces  for a couple of months, then repeat that again as needed until the vaccines are in mass supply."
19177,Their published data looked really good.

19221,So the WHO and CDC didn't know that coughing and sneezing were the primary transmission vehicles back in April/May when they said only those expressing symptoms required a mask?
19222,And the CDC didn't know what they were saying when they said a week or so ago that the virus isn't airborne?
19223,Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego has a better claim to the governorship at this point.
19224,Thanks for your explanation!

19245,Shocking that we’re focused on it now.
19246,Considering it’s been happening forever
19247,"That's why I said ""once the vaccine is widely available""."
19248,"Also FDA is requiring that vaccines are at least 50% effective, not 30%."
19249,And that's the very minimum.
19250,"If the Pfizer vaccine candidate, for example, gets strong enough of an efficacy signal at the first interim analysis, it will mean that the vaccine is at least 77% effective."
19251,That's pretty good.
19252,Changes in mask science?
19253,"Mask science hasn’t changed but the understanding of just how airborne and easily transmissible the disease is changed as we went forward and as we realized Americans wouldn’t or couldn’t stay put and they were the best measure of defense we had, hence changed recommendations."

19277,"Trump bears plenty of responsibility by letting every state go at it on their own individually without a federally coordinated mandate, which they had a playbook for and it was thrown out."
19278,Trump bears plenty of responsibility when he knew the seriousness of it in February but purposefully played it down.
19279,"Sure, Fauci’s recommendation wasn’t put out well but that recommendation also changed and if we had a leader that listened to its scientists we’d have a nation that followed those changes for our betterment as well."
19280,You can call it however you want but this is on our president by and large.

19808,"His teachers are all great, it's more the administrative side of school things that can confuse and frustrate me."
19809,There was a lot of doom and gloom about his possible issues and whether or not he'd be able to deal with general ed classes when he was younger but even though he's improved leaps and bounds over the past few years a part of me is still terrified that we are missing something or not doing enough.
19810,"Then the other part feels guilty because all things considered, whatever he has or is seems to be on the ""high function"" end and I know we could be dealing with much more difficult delays or health issues, so then I feel bad for possibly taking services that we might be naturally aging out of, because I know some parents really struggle to get the help they need and I don't want to be taking anything from someone who needs it more, y'know?"

20307,Not AZ.
20308,Not Pfizer.
20309,Not Moderna.
20310,The truth is the virus is going to infect a lot of people and that is how it goes.

20312,It would be great if we could end one with a vaccine but we won't be.
20313,"They start, the spread, a lot of people get, they fade into the background."

20329,Thank you
20330,Well that actually answers ALOT of my questions.
20331,"SUMMARY
In Winnebago County, Wisconsin, perceived low severity of disease outcome; perceived responsibility to others; peer pressure; and exposure to misinformation, conflicting messages, or opposing views regarding masks were identified as drivers of behaviors that might influence risk for COVID-19 exposure among young adults."
20332,What are the implications for public health practice?
20333,Identifying factors that influence risk for COVID-19 exposure and framing messaging to target those factors could help persuade young adults to adhere to public health guidelines that prevent the spread of COVID-19.
20334,Providing clear and consistent messages regarding the need for and effectiveness of masks could help increase widespread adoption of evidence-based guidance.

20367,"Unpopular  opinion:

Spain is not performing that bad."
20368,"Spain had the ""luck"" of being the world country that received most tourist this summer, this means its 2nd wave started on early July."
20369,"Since then, cases has risen up to 10k-12k per day."
20370,"Which is a lot but the curve is clearly not exponential, and since mid September is actually almost flat (and would be decreasing if it wasn't for Madrid)."
20371,This means Spain had a R0 slightly above 1 for a long period of time.
20372,With lots of regions successfully lowering it under 1 with mild measures.
20373,"This means infection is not out of control (except Madrid)

On the other hand we have cases like Belgium, Netherlands, France, UK, Chekia or Poland which wave started on early-mid September (2 months later) and are already seeing more cases/100.000 Hab."
20374,Than Spain.
20375,Their curves are clearly exponential.
20376,Which means R0 way above 1 for a short period of time.
20377,"Yeah, Spain deaths is currently higher but deaths always come later than cases (about 15-20 day's later) I believe that while Spain has high quantity of cases/deaths situation is not out of control (except Madrid)."
20378,"Yet most other countries, while current death numbers are low, have the infection rate (R0) out of control."
20379,Issue for those countries is that we learnt from 1st wave that measures imposed today only slow down the infection rate in 1-2 weeks.
20380,"(because due to epidemiology today's positives were infected a week ago, which means than ,even if you magically get 0 infections from today on, until next week you will keep seeing an exponential growth from last week infected people)."
20381,So in my opinion the countries mentioned above will be in worse situation (death people) than Spain in 20 days (unless Spain cannot control Madrid) and they should be issuing stronger lockdown measures before their deaths start to show up.
20382,"Some high rate death ratios are already unavoidable for some countries, but the longer they wait, the worse."
20383,Countries like Germany and Italy (which wave seems to be starting now) should start placing minnor lockdown in highly affected areas like Spain did during summer.
20384,If you want to forecast countries deaths just go to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ pick a country and click on 7 days average cases count.
20385,Death 7 days average should be close to 1/1.000 the average cases 15-20 day's ago*.
20386,* this is for countries that you believe they are correctly counting their cases/deaths.
20387,But I thought they already had a vaccine?
20388,Well you'd be hard pressed to find a country that cares less for its people than Russia.

20633,So you admitted you're wrong (Flu IFR \*is\* much lower than covid IFR) but still making some super vague point?
20634,No one here suggested Covid is dangerous for under 30s so I'm not sure what you're trying to prove
20635,Infection fatality rate was never that high.

20658,You must a acknowledge what you give up and what you gain from this specific strategy.

20660,"They have to, because we don't put infinite value on a human life or we would sacrifice all our resources for one person."
20661,I believe right now they put the value at $10 million.
20662,How many bars is that?
20663,Do you think the binder should be lower?

20762,But take 20 kids in the same room 4 or 5 hours a day... and those who have it are mostly asymptomatic and the damage is done.

20770,you can use the data on this site to track the positivity rate in your state over time if that seems like useful info to you.
20771,r/COVID19 is more focused on new scientific literature and isn't constantly being brigaded by trolls so that's another good place to look.

20775,"I agree it's terrible for people's mental health, I have BP2 and the lack of social contact and routine in a lockdown fucked me up pretty bad back in March-May."
20776,"Young people not getting an education, a crippled economy, lack of life experience, elective procedures being put on held, cancer screenings and other checkups being delayed, are all terrible consequences that come with these measures."
20777,I'm in favor of allowing the virus to spread amongst the young and healthy population while the vulnerable take protective measures and different precautions to ensure their safety.
20778,"I was being facetious with the ""my body, my choice"" line, but it's true."
20779,Why are we treating everybody the same with what people are allowed to do?
20780,"If we let young and healthy people live their lives, the virus could spread through them and start to build up herd immunity especially when it was Summer where people are outdoors and healthier than in the winter."
20781,Leading to lower cases and spread when it's going to be more dangerous due to everybody being indoors and more vulnerable.
20782,"Now it's going to be Winter and I know for a fact places are going to want to start locking down again, crippling more businesses, destroying the mental health of many, restricting what people can and can't do, and a million other consequences when the majority of the population isn't that high of a risk."
20783,"The solution was never to just ""lock down harder""."

20787,That has absolutely nothing to do with an antigenic shift that occurred in the Summer of a 1918.
20788,The comparisons are based on utter shit.
20789,Everything that could go wrong with this virus has.
20790,So you could play optimist or you could assume the worst.
20791,"I assume the worst, I was once an optimist with this virus, it didn't work out."
20792,"Well, being on this side of it, I will say that the kids that are doing the poorest are the ones who’s parents aren’t ensuring the kids get their work done."

20821,they're a military dictatorship that can literally detain and lock you up in a special covid ward if you test positive.
20822,That's like saying how does a country as big as China manage to control violent crime &amp; narcotics?

20827,Yawn.
20828,It's boring and a waste of time to discredit the points she's making because of her chosen profession.
20829,I care about her arguments and the data she presents.
20830,"Argue against that and show me how THAT is faulty, not her job title."
20831,"If a french bread baker in Minneapolis wrote this and created the linked to dashboard, it would not make an ounce of difference to me."
20832,"Frankly, the fact that she's an economist means she's likely better at crunching numbers, looking at/interpreting data, and putting them into context, which is honestly what we need more of right now."
20833,"Show me issues in the methodology, the data collection."
20834,"&gt; Our data on almost 200,000 kids in 47 states from the last two weeks of September revealed an infection rate of 0.13 percent among students and 0.24 percent among staff."
20835,"That’s about 1.3 infections over two weeks in a school of 1,000 kids, or 2.2 infections over two weeks in a group of 1,000 staff."
20836,"Even in high-risk areas of the country, the student rates were well under half a percent."
20837,"[\(You can see all the data here.\)

20843,"I wear a mask (n95) all the time, never going out without one since March."
20844,"In the past month I've been wearing one wherever I go, be it outdoor or indoor."

20865,"So when they are sad or angry, don’t try to cheer them up."
20866,Validate their emotions and tell them that you know how it can feel etc.
20867,and be with them in the moment.
20868,I feel like mindfulness is a really important aspect that we don’t discuss enough.
20869,Being present in the moment to just be aware of everything.
20870,Rather than be scared of unpleasant emotions.
20871,Someone must have brought it back from the white house
20872,Covid BLASTS Russia this week and makes another FALSE CLAIM about how it did it!
20873,Death counts are used for important things.
20874,"If someone dies and you don't register that, they can continue getting pensions, for example."
20875,"As much as the government wants to hide the death toll, the price is too high, literally."
20876,"They can and do lie about causes death, but that's irrelevant because statistics."
20877,Billions of dollars doesn't mean shit.
20878,It's not magic.
20879,You don't just magically spend billions and POOF CURE!
20880,"Also, a lot of these money is coming from NGO and Governments."
20881,A lot of Phama companies are getting massive checks.
20882,"They get to their fund their R&amp;D, up their production, get amazing PR, oh and if ""it works"" they get to be a savior."
20883,Nobody has any idea if these will work.
20884,Vaccine development is often 10 years.
20885,Even with 10 years of pre-clinical work and trials a large number of vaccines fail.
20886,"Ignoring non-viral vaccines there has been gobbles of money throw at:

HIV, RSV, HSV-1, HSV-2, ""universal influenza vaccine"", etc."
20887,All failed.
20888,While the funding did run out all the original Sars-Cov-1 candidates failed.
20889,"The other ""nasty"" cousin to Sars-Cov-2 is MERS which has gone years of research and no vaccine."
20890,And then you think.
20891,How has China only got like 20 a day
20892,"Lockdowns are very effective, they worked in Italy, Spain, Melbourne, China, etc, etc."
20893,"Opening up before you have elimination, or at least until your TTI system can cope is where it went wrong."
20894,"Of course masks won't work if you still have indoor dining/drinking, and people going into the office."
20895,Lockdowns end those avenues of infection.
20896,"Most likely governments will see the grim hospitalisation data, and shut everything down."
20897,They will have no choice.
20898,That would mean US and Russia are testing at pretty much the same rate.
20899,Population is 328 to 144 million.
20900,US has an edge but it's a slight one.
20901,Hopefully that’ll end COVID and all COVID restrictions once and for all.
20902,"I’m talking about the pandemic, not the disease."
20903,"If economists have a bias simply based on their position, so do public health officials"

20910,Wait?
20911,How have I disagreed with experts.
20912,I was just saying data.
20913,Salt Lake does have a hire per capita death rate and per capita hospitalizations.
20914,"If you want the data please look at this cool website someone showed me: [https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/](https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/)  


And what I say about the club district in Salt Lake is absolutely true."
20915,"whether it has caused outbreak or not (hard to say), but it is true that there are hundreds of people packed in clubs in downtown Salt Lake not wearing masks."
20916,"Not a lot of mormons nor conservatives there, and you are welcome to check it out for yourself if you don't believe me."
20917,Anything in a high risk category should remain closed until further notice.
20918,"They’re low hanging fruit, sacrifice 10% of the economy to save the other 90%."
20919,Would you rather have schools open or bars and nightclubs?
20920,No no no.
20921,The US is equivalent to a third world country don't you see /s
20922,"Well, 4 years ago the world was told that about half of the US were, apparently, Florida"
20923,sure.... please burn all your clothes and toss all your electronic gadgets because they're tainted by the Chinese virus!
20924,Wow you are totally not full of nationalistic bullshit or anything.
20925,"Even if you narrow it down to just ""Russian government"", why would they claim something so ridiculously easily verifiable about a product they intend to export?"
20926,What is the incentive to lie here?
20927,Pretty much.
20928,Those poor souls make crap money and have to put up with entitled pricks all day.
20929,In recent memory I think I’ve only not tipped one time when our waiter was constantly hitting on my girlfriend...like right there in front of me.
20930,I asked him to please stop...she asked him to please stop...but he kept throwing very crude lines at her.
20931,We left early.
20932,Paid our tab but I left no tip.
20933,In THAT instance I get it.
20934,But just because some asshole doesn’t want to wear a mask?
20935,I mean cmon
20936,"The infections are way down now, there has been foment and lockdown fatigue in Melbourne."
20937,Those stipends come from the gas money you’re not using
20938,"Come on man, is this your first day on reddit?"
20939,"Nearly everybody, especially in the popular threads, has a hateboner for Russia and Russians."
20940,"Every kind of obnoxious, moronic, disparaging lie will eagerly be perpetuated by bored americans who have nothing better to do than pat each other on the back in an echo chamber like this one."
20941,Winter 'behaviors' are already here.
20942,It's getting too cold to eat/drink outside and getting too dark too early to do outside activities after work.
20943,In the West maybe but India is getting like 100k a day.
20944,The original estimate was 6ft was safe for a conversation lasting 15 minutes.
20945,"Somewhere along the line, governments conveniently forgot the 15 minute limit."
20946,"So if you go for just one drink that might be OK, drink fast..."
20947,NDTV is a liberal left wing news channel in India who hates right wing BJP.
20948,It is like the CNN.
20949,Lol that bed getting crowded yet conservatives?
20950,"I'm Canadian living overseas, and I feel like my family back home doesn't take a lot of precautions."
20951,There's a general feeling that the outbreaks are happening elsewhere and not to worry.
20952,The cases never really dropped down to a sustainable level after the first peak.
20953,It's a dumpster fire!
20954,A virus does not break globally.
20955,They have to start somewhere and spread from there.
20956,We have a pretty good idea it started in bat populations in China.
20957,Researchers have shown that spillover from bats happens on a fairly regular basis.
20958,"Unlike the last worldwide pandemic, our communication abilities are much better now."
20959,So we know that China had the first large scale spread.
20960,It spirals out from there.
20961,I would rather see China set up better tripwires for early detection then trying to sanction China for something that has been happening all along.
20962,We just didn't know where or how to look.
20963,Get Trump outta the office and everything will slowly go back to normal.
20964,Read the article closely.
20965,It only shows that they would get shipments of the vaccine on November 10th.
20966,Not that they're actually injecting anyone with them.
20967,"Though I definitely think that exact date is dubious, I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccine was being transported before approval."
20968,Until death us part.
20969,Good
20970,"Contagion, I exhale you."
20971,Congratulations?
20972,You're part of the problem if you're going out just to go out.
20973,The dictionary definition of someone doing something like that right now would be: idiot.
20974,"I'm hoping it's your job or something that has made you say this, because me and plenty others have family members that have fought, are fighting, and will fight this disease because of selfish fools thinking that their defiance is somehow sticking it to ""the man""."
20975,"Some of those people have lost, are losing, or will lose their lives because of these selfish actions."
20976,"When you say things like this proudly, just remember that there are people out there with empty spaces at their dinner tables who will hold you personally accountable for the shitty way that you have acted."
20977,Is it really that hard for some of yall to stay inside and smoke some weed for a year or two while science figures shit out for you?
20978,"Because that's how you would actually stick it to ""the man""."
20979,"They need your little slave ass alive to keep living in their posh towers, so make them pay for your safety while it's important."
20980,"They've profited off of the labor, the infrastructure, and the sheer number of bodies available to work, buy, consume, and otherwise distribute whatever product has been used to amass their wealth."
20981,"Time for them to reinvest in society instead of business, because the way society is going - their businesses won't last anyway."
20982,"Sorry for the rant, but the people that I've lost to covid aren't exactly out of my mind yet."

20986,News to be repeated every day.
20987,"that author is an ECONOMIST, not a public health official or epidemiologist or even a physician or virologist."
20988,"She has an internal bias  focused on metrics concerning economic behavior, and that's to be expected."
20989,She would have more credence if she were a bio-stats researcher.
20990,ever heard of immunity barrier?
20991,lol you must be really looking for a reason to not wear one.
20992,"masks work, but not everyone wants to hear that because it causes minor discomfort"
20993,We will see what it turns into in a couple weeks.
20994,Assuming we have a 2-3 week lag from infection to death it seems to work out with estimates I've seen of a 1% total IFR since the average daily was closer to 1k cases per day a couple weeks ago.
20995,"If that holds true that would suggest eventually getting to 60 deaths/day assuming this is the peak, close to the equivalent US numbers around 1k per day."
20996,Obviously the IFR estimates change with the demographics of who gets infected.
20997,"Sorry, I have been going down the IFR rabbit hole today."
20998,Very fascinating stuff if it wasn't so morbid
20999,In this interview he discusses how 5-6 months ago they brought up factory space to begin producing the treatments which are being proven now.

21013,A lot of people are weighing in saying it's not worth it.. not to be the devils advocate but from another perspective?
21014,I've gone a half a dozen or so times this year ONLY AFTER covid.
21015,I'm 30 and I won't be visiting my family which live 1000+ miles away from me until after covid though so..
21016,I may be a little different than someone whose older who sees their family daily.
21017,To answer your question though?
21018,If youre like me and hate sitting next to strangers or waiting in super tight packed lines then yeah.. going now is absolutely worth it.
21019,I think there is a vacuum chamber of fear in this reddit and I totally understand it.
21020,This virus is a real deal and it is scary.
21021,"But yeah, I felt safe at universal I honestly did."
21022,Disney world?
21023,Eh.. they don't feel as safe as universal did and man disney world isn't worth it the park is totally dead without all the cast members.
21024,It sucks.
21025,Universal was a great time though.
21026,Super cheap too.
21027,If you're young and willing to take an opportunity risk I'd say it's amazingly worth it.
21028,My god you get your own seat on the rides AND the lines are nearly non existent on a weekday.
21029,It's the dream for the anti social among us.
21030,"And I personally haven't seen the horror stories of thousands of people without masks.. they really crack down on the parks with temperature checks, sanitizer, and masks."
21031,"But hey, that's just my personal experience."
21032,Ya know?
21033,Just.. don't be selfish and go hang out with a bunch of people who didn't wanna take that risk with you after?
21034,Like I said I won't visit my family and I luckily work from home.
21035,Oh yeah!
21036,They also sell the most comfy cloth Harry Potter masks at universal my god.
21037,"So, while wearing it all day sucks it's really not all that bad to be honest."
21038,(P.s for the fear mongers... the cloth mask they sell works.. you can't blow out a candle while you're wearing it easily.. calm down.)
21039,EDIT: spelling.

21042,Lock them all up.
21043,My right to life is more important than their cult.
21044,People were specifically told that masks shouldnt be worn and that hand washing and not touching your face was a sufficient precaution.
21045,That has an effect.
21046,People were told that their kids could go back to school and that it was safe to do so without masks.
21047,That has an effect.
21048,People were told it was no longer required to wear masks in stores.
21049,That has an effect.
21050,People were told it was safe to go on vacation and were encouraged to eat in restaurants.
21051,That has an effect.
21052,Brainwashing is not exclusive to right wing media.
21053,The 24-hour news cycle promotes the identity politics and fear mongering we’re seeing today.
21054,"Humans aren’t meant to have this much information thrown at us, it’s skewing the way we perceive the world and putting a wedge between certain groups."
21055,"CNN, Fox, etc."
21056,"are here to keep us engaged with their programming, not inform us of what reality is actually like."
21057,If somebody gets treated with antibodies is it possible that they would survive without creating memory B cells and thus be susceptible to reinfection?
21058,So many people are fleeing New York for Florida it’s crazy.
21059,"Your concerns, as well as those of the locals you interact with, are misplaced."
21060,"""OPEN EVERYTHING!!"""
21061,"*virus explodes*

""HOWWW did this happen!?"""
21062,But they have a vaccine!!
21063,!
21064,People have been infected in quicker interactions.
21065,You’re not being ridiculous.
21066,If he refuses to quarantine protect yourself as best as you can.
21067,&gt; I thought Europeans were so much more enlightened than us big dumb Americans.
21068,"Well we are :) But that comes with its own problems, like being over-confident and arrogant."
21069,My country (Ireland) we got the cases down to single digits most of the summer.
21070,But that false sense of security and thinking we had outsmarted the virus came back to bite us.
21071,Yesterday in Ireland we had 502 cases.
21072,July 1st we only had 6 cases.
21073,"So yeah a collective belief that we had the virus under control and that it was now an American problem (which was the common belief over the summer) has now led to people lowering their guard, meeting up with friends, going back to pubs."
21074,And clearly that over-confidence was misplaced.
21075,"&gt; How can hospital capacity possibly be an issue in such an altruistic, forward thinking society with nationalized healthcare anyway?"
21076,"&gt; 
&gt; 

Well nationalized healthcare doesn't mean better hospitals, it just means you won't go bankrupt using them."
21077,"Our hospitals are the same as many US States, just not without the price tags and with longer wait times in some cases."
21078,I'd take muscle paim for 24 hours over not being able to breathe properly + endangering my family and relatives.
21079,"Tbh I wasn't very confident in the russian vaccine at first, but this information looks quite promising."
21080,I’m so sorry to read your story.
21081,And any “friend” that acts that way should be immediately out of your life.
21082,I hate this.
21083,So incredibly stupid.
21084,"Huge, virtual hug for you."
21085,I didn't mean for my comment to sound accusatory.
21086,"I meant to mention there's probably another 5% *I've noticed* who are maybe trying but not doing so well, e.g."
21087,no mask + face shield.
21088,"At least in my area in France, most if not all people are masked in stores of all sizes (from supermarket to small deli)."
21089,Bars are the only place where I've noped out real quick.
21090,Why do people put the economy above human lives?
21091,I don't understand.
21092,"Oh, is it the media that does official counts and not public health agencies?"
21093,Got it.
21094,I get elevated temperature from tetanus vaccine and it's a tried and true old vaccine.
21095,"Personally, I wouldn't even consider pain at the site of injection and fever for a day to be something worth being concerned about."
21096,Be a grownup and suck it the fuck up.
21097,People interacting with you don't know you've had it (were you tested?
21098,Do you know for sure) so they will understandably feel very unsafe around you.
21099,We also still don't know how long immunity lasts.
21100,"If immunity only lasts six months and you had it in the spring, then there's a chance you could catch it again any time now."
21101,"I'm also 99% sure I had it in the spring (no test, but I lost my sense of smell and taste for about a week) and I still wear a mask in public buildings because I'm not a self-centered asshole who cares more about my own convenience than about possibly saving a life."
21102,This is Russia and we have to remember the level of testing they're doing isn't covering all of the possibly new infected.
21103,I'm sure the number is higher.
21104,"Yn Soviet Rousha, reycords smash you!"
21105,Visitors from Alpha Centauri vote Putin
21106,"Yeah all that poetic shit sounds nice, but we both know that’s not reality"
21107,Hey!
21108,I am one of those 40 000.

21110,You mean like every Jets season
21111,I did not call you a republican.
21112,I said you support the GOP.
21113,You are actively supporting the GOP.
21114,Full stop.
21115,Why not make it only open to people living in California?
21116,"The Anaheim park does a huge chunk of business from relatively local people, I’m sure they could fill up to 25% capacity or whatever with just in-state people."
21117,"And oh by the way, anyone from anywhere can already fly to California without a quarantine period."
21118,Disneyland opening gives people more incentive to come but they already can if they choose to.
21119,This screams of someone who has never visited Chicago or seen it outside of the news lol.
21120,Could easily have been caused by contamination from someone handling them when the samples were tested.
21121,It was never found anywhere else so that's almost certainly the answer.
21122,Or they're trolls intentionally spreading misinformation
21123,"New Cases:

200 in summer, 1400 three weeks ago = 7-fold increase

Deaths:

5 in summer, 24 now = 5-fold increase

Both the 7-day average."
21124,"Not exactly linear, but a comparable increase."
21125,"Plus, I never said we ""should destroy society over it""."
21126,So is Russia faking the numbers or is Russia faking the numbers?
21127,Go vaccine!
21128,"Thank you again, I'm showing my humility right now to help people cope."
21129,"When OP and other were hating, that is also not ""love thy neighbor"" right?"
21130,"It's a ambiguous saying but the origins is similar to the""golden rule"" and also infidelity."
21131,It's a horrible thing to see two big religions with the central as Jesus.
21132,"How can one brother yell hateful words like a ""clarion call"" on flesh and blood?"
21133,This is almost as false as the case #s they claim.
21134,No wonder how you can’t understand the initial post.
21135,[removed]
21136,Is this another example of American anti-intellectualism that I hear about?
21137,I think Bill Gates is being treated very unfairly considering all his humanitarian efforts.
21138,Some people seem to hate him simply either because he's filthy rich or they think he somehow has strong influence over Windows now.
21139,He had donated freaking 35 billion dollars over 20 years after his retirement.
21140,Uh no not less than 1% wears them lmao.
21141,Not sure if you've been to Amsterdam recently but a lot of people were them.
21142,"Ah yes alarmists, but imagine not wanting the healthcare system to collapse and have thousands of deaths."
21143,Sorry of me and the other alarmists to be so self-centered.
21144,I am sorry we should respect your love for taking risks.
21145,Have you considered licking lead paint?
21146,Heard its a great risk nowadays.
21147,Might be of interest idk.
21148,"It’s cool, trust me I think it’s safe to say everyone a bit on edge, especially when it comes to this."
21149,Have a nice day/night
21150,This entire generation of Millenials and Gen Z are going to be economically impacted by this.
21151,"Once we age into leadership roles, we will have to study this."
21152,We'll still be dealing with long term survivors who will look to the health system to compensate them.
21153,We will also have a large population seeking mental health treatment and/or drug abuse to self medicate with the trauma.
21154,I suffered depression starting in 2008.
21155,A shift in my lifestyle.
21156,Away from friends.
21157,From sports.
21158,Total change in my interests and diet.
21159,This same thing just happened to an entire population.
21160,Many people who may have never experienced the downward spiral may not be equipped to cope and bounce back.
21161,I know how much 9/11 changed the next 20 years of my life.
21162,And this has been 100 × 9/11.
21163,Every political decision I make for the next 20 years will be based on this event.

21171,Followed empathy makes you opponents seem like sociopaths.
21172,"Careful, you are being brainwashed by social media to polarize your view point."
21173,Republicans and democrats are not that different from each other.
21174,Social media would have you think otherwise.
21175,Yes.
21176,Life expectancy in Russia is around 72-73.
21177,So I'd assume that anyone over age 75 who dies from Covid (or Polonium poisoning) is simply reported as natural causes.
21178,No need for a confrontation--you've already destroyed yourself from within.
21179,The rest of the world is already moving on...
21180,How many seniors died in a pre-covid day in Florida?
21181,but it's JUST the flu hurr durrrrr
21182,I live in a town where they have recently reopened cinemas with restrictions on capacity.
21183,I sometimes go when it's not crowded and people tend to sit apart when they can.
21184,The ceilings are high and nobody talks.
21185,I think people would go in my town but it is too small obviously to save the industry when most cinemas have to close.
21186,"edit: The theatre cleaning may not be adequate for covid hygiene, they tend to be dirty."
21187,Oh wow that was quick nice 😄 and too late for me now antibody test it is when I can be bothered for me lol.
21188,You should delete this before you give Trump any ideas.
21189,He might get desperate enough that he puts Eric and Don Jr floating in bathtubs filled with goo and calling out “pre Votes” Minority Report style.
21190,What law states there can be put a $15k fine on this?
21191,[removed]
21192,Yes yes yes.
21193,I keep on trying to remind people in my circle about this.
21194,The real suspenseful time isn't now.

21198,Yup.
21199,"Either barricade people in their homes, allow freedom of movement and accept what comes with it or be lucky enough that you're an isolated island with a small population and you can easily contact trace and control who comes in and out."

21201,Won't you think of the economy?
21202,!
21203,"I would say Florida averaging nearly 200 deaths a day for about 3 weeks counts as a dramatic increase, myself."
21204,"edit: Covid related deaths, for the daft."
21205,"French here, in the western area of the country."
21206,"I've not been bothered by restaurants, which were all very far from capacity the few times I've checked them out."
21207,"The bars, on the other hand, have been downright frightening every time I saw one from afar, crowded, packed, with too many waiters ""wearing"" their mask under their nose or under their chin."
21208,Awful.
21209,"Ah yes, what was I thinking, the CCP has no power or influence there whatsoever."
21210,"I'll go tell the protestors, I'm sure they'll be happy about the good news"
21211,You're insane.
21212,Oh that should've been easier back then surely?
21213,"Just head to the government website, much easier that way."
21214,Got the results back yesterday as negative !
21215,&gt;Are we taking extreme measures?
21216,"Are you playing stupid I  bad faith, or are you genuinely this ignorant?"
21217,Look around at how things are shut down all over dude.
21218,We are obviously taking more extreme measures than we have for anything else in recent times.
21219,&gt;I hear plenty on this sub about how the US has a weak and ineffectual response and that nobody is complying and that is why our death numbers are so bad.
21220,Anyone saying that no one is complying is an idiot.
21221,Anyone believing them is an idiot.
21222,"Anyone trying to use the declarations of idiots to make a point... well, guess what?"
21223,Just because there are select individuals like you that refuse to believe the science and insist on muddying the waters does not mean that extreme measures are not being taken.
21224,"&gt;The numbers I shared regarding TB is that ~1.5 million people die globally every year from TB, TB is a contagious respiratory disease that affects all age ranges and we don't wear masks, or lock down our economies indefinitely to combat TB."
21225,We treat people when they catch TB just like we should treat people who catch COVID.
21226,Because covid is obviously causing more problems if it is more deadly.
21227,This is commen sense stuff dude.
21228,Why are you struggling so hard?
21229,&gt;There's plenty in the science that supported schools opening - like COVID being the #15-20th leading cause of adolescent mortality yet people being terrified of their children dying of COVID.
21230,So the kids are going to teach themselves and not go home to their families?
21231,Dead or totally healed are not the only outcomes for this disease afterall.
21232,There is the while being sick and needed to recuperate.
21233,"&gt;As it turns out, people like you scream ""listen to the science"" until it becomes some dipshit emotional tug of whether it saves just one life, then keeping healthy people immobile for 2+ years is worth it."
21234,All you do is drag up debunked old articles and and spread misinformation.
21235,"Not sure if it is because you do not have the capacity to understand what you are reading, or if you are intentionally trying to cause harm."
21236,Which is it?
21237,Because no reasonable person making an honest point would set up straw men to lie about like you are here with your lies about me and my position.
21238,Grow up.
21239,Some places are banning these because finally people realize having a valve is equivalent to not wearing a mask at all.
21240,"They protect only the wearer, though."
21241,To convert them to something usable you can seal the valve ports on the outside with an obvious piece of tape.
21242,Make sure air no longer flows through the valve.
21243,"its been 14 days since my family first started getting COVID symptoms, they all tested positive."
21244,Ive been living outside my house since then and i was wondering if it was safe for me to go back inside now.

21246,i really dont want to get it.
21247,Should i wait another few days?
21248,Thank you

21252,"At the same time phase 3 of the trials is taking place, the results from the first group of volunteers are expected by January and then, provided that the results are good, the vaccine will receive the full authorization and become available to the general public."

21386,"Start in February and consider than in 9 months, ~1M people have died from COVID and annually, 1.5M people die of TB."
21387,That would put us in November if you start from the begining of february.
21388,We are in the begining of october.
21389,Why is math so hard for you?
21390,"Additionally, shit did not start popping off in Italy until March, not February."
21391,"So if we count march through september as the data suggests we should based on the country you chose as a metric, 

1.5m ÷ 12 = 125,000 deaths per month."

21397,&gt;Science has been clear from the beginning that COVID transmits via air and that you need to wash your hands.

21399,"&gt;Just because they didn't explicitly come out and say ""stop wiping down your fucking groceries"" doesn't mean that science supported, advocated or suggested it was a good idea to wipe down groceries."
21400,I would like to see your evidence from the begining of this outbreak in 2019 as you claim.
21401,&gt;You did so out of paranoia and a lack of information which doesn't surprise me since you apparently think COVID started killing people in May.
21402,So now you are admitting that it was not known at the begining?
21403,Will you make up your mind?
21404,You cannot even make a point without contradicting yourself.
21405,"And yes, I was off by one months as to when things kicked off."
21406,March-the end of september is 7 months.
21407,I have already adjusted the figures appropriately.

21442,"Who is this ""we"" I don't live in in Utah County."
21443,You gave some B.S.
21444,completely absurd opinions on why Utah County has cases.
21445,"And I'm saying, all the evidence I have seen, albeit anecdotal, is exactly opposite."
21446,Maybe just maybe there might be other reasons why It was spreading in Salt Lake earlier and more now in Utah County.
21447,Might be similar to why some states got hit  earlier and some later.
21448,"There are a lot of factors in there, you are not even thinking about or considering and jumping to ""dumb mormon yokels"" maybe because you are an anti-science bigot, or maybe you are just incapable of thinking of other possible explanations that don't involve mocking people you see as different."

## Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammatory response is associated with high mortality."
21502,"This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) may be the primary factor related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum and the risk for mortality, as subclinical nutritional deficiencies may be unmasked by any significant increase in oxidative stress."
21503,"NAD+ levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity."
21504,These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19.
21505,Further consumption of NAD+ in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1.
21506,"This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD+ and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically."
21507,"The significance of this, if proven, has far-reaching consequences in the management of COVID-19 especially in third world countries, where resources and finances are limited."
21508,"Here's the latest (as of yesterday) case/death charts for Wisconsin and the Dakotas, with running 7-day averages."
21509,"Some serious spikes in these graphs:

21576,&gt;Matter of fact influenza not only can but routinely does mutate to create very nasty strains.
21577,"\&gt; That's why we need new vaccines every year because it's able to mutate/ evolve in ways to dodge our existing communities to previous strains

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That is not a point at all."
21578,Herd immunity is a given.
21579,It will happen.
21580,It's 100% unavoidable.
21581,You literally just made a point about how it isn't a given with the influenza virus and attacked me for stating the obvious fact that this coronavirus can do the same just as the four common cold causing human coronaviruses and the other dozens of Rhinoviruses and other viruses that cause common colds do the same every year...
21582,"So, which is it?"
21583,"Every virus can evolve/ mutate in ways that throw off/dodge our immunities, or herd immunity is 100% a given?"
21584,Wonder what it's like have people actually care about others..
21585,Proof that there are neighborhoods with equal or more transmission please.
21586,"Well, the point is more so to use that time to develop the necessary medical and social infrastructure/systems to help tackle the effects of covid."
21587,Problem is many places that have had hard lockdowns haven't used that time productively.
21588,"Yes, but compliance to these new laws is higher in the east because of those cultural aspects."
21589,Wave 2 has begun
21590,Oh did they actually start counting?
21591,LOCKDOWN EVERYONE!
21592,Amirite?
21593,"Grocery workers are in constant contact with customers for 8 hours a day, so yes they probably have spread it."
21594,How about bad people instead?
21595,"Bad because they are only concerned about their child and his risk, not the hourly workers, not the staff or food preparation people, not the fact that they could bring it home and infect a parent, neighbor, or grandparent."
21596,"100 million deaths, minimum."
21597,please educate me oh great statistician.
21598,"Well yeah they are also against any and all gun regulations, even though every public health agency around the world acknowledges firearms as a risk factor."
21599,"Those add another 40,000 nationwide deaths a year."
21600,"Oh yeah, because we're really seeing all the professional athletes around the world who have tested positive really struggling out there and moving like they're elderly!"
21601,Fuck outta here with that bs narrative.
21602,"Now explain why the guy can't  run?, dipshit."
21603,It's almost like they surrendered
21604,"India had 96k in one day, close to 100,000."
21605,Its about their own high record not against any other countries.
21606,"They could be,  but they almost certainly aren't."
21607,"The non-covid excess deaths follow covid deaths very closely,  and once the wave subsides they go away."

It would be nice to have a better way to estimate covid deaths."
21609,But we don't.
21610,"Collateral deaths are absolutely going to be a problem as the pandemic worsens, poverty rises,  and people can't go to the hospital safely."
21611,"Oh no, 5 people over the age of 70 with multiple preexisting conditions are going to die!"
21612,Good.
21613,It will be Blue this year
21614,"I'll give them a month before a new total lockdown (they should do it sooner but they will try everything to postpone it as much as possible) and the rest of Europe will follow a week later, unfortunately there is no alternative."
21615,We gotta hope a vaccine will be available in January or the economic consequences of another prolonged lockdown will be terrible and this comes from somebody who recently graduated from university and is looking for a job right now (how lucky I am damn)
21616,"Question for you, because I'm genuinely curious about this."
21617,"In the summer, I heard a lot of teachers (that I know) complaining about having to go back to school, and that they're being forced into the classroom in dangerous conditions, and I felt terrible for them, because I can't imagine a worse job right now than dealing with kids in person and putting your life/ your family's life at risk."
21618,"Then, at the end of August when we were getting ready for virtual learning (we kept our kids home, since we work from home we can, and figured it was better for them, and better for the teachers), we learned through the school that the virtual school was having a very difficult time getting ANY teachers to volunteer to teach virtually, so they were having problems with capacity (we ended up with 2 teachers straight out of school)."
21619,"So my question is, what gives?"
21620,"I always figured the virtual option would be super popular, especially among older teachers who were at risk, but now it seems like no teachers wanted to do it?"
21621,Measures to prevent COVID-19.
21622,So you’re saying India is NOT doing just fine?
21623,Meaning you agree with my statement lmao
21624,NJ as well.
21625,Central Canadians in Quebec and Ontario.
21626,That's not the whole country.
21627,They are growing by 1000 cases a day and running low on testing capacity.
21628,"BC is doing well, 110 cases yesterday with a sub 1 percent positivity rate."
21629,The new cases have ranged between 70-125 per day with a 0.7-1.6 percent positivity.
21630,Northern Canada no community transmission since spring and Nanuvut still hasn't seen a case.
21631,Atlantic Canada no community transmission since July and they have sealed themselves off from the rest of the world.
21632,Alberta is doing ok although it's got a serious outbreak at Foothills hospital and in Edmonton.
21633,300 new cases yesterday week nearly all in Edmonton.
21634,Saskatchewan and Manitoba have each been seeing new cases in 20-35 range.
21635,Do you throw the cashier an extra $5 for ringing up your groceries?
21636,It's the closures that are mainly responsible for this not masks
21637,Except Canada has less than half the death rate.
21638,11% of the US population but less than 5% the deaths.
21639,something like that.
21640,Same story here in Ireland.
21641,"Sure we’re starting a pretty concerning second wave, but we’re also still much lower on death rate than the US has been, and that trend has been there the entire time."
21642,"Most European countries are following national plans, increasing restriction and quarantine measures all together; or opening up all together."
21643,USA is doing a hodgepodge depending on state - inconsistency and division is useless at fighting a virus.
21644,And the virus doesn’t care about politics or feelings.
21645,"Ohhhh I see, the USA wants to follow in their foot steps, it all makes sense now"
21646,It looks more like he got it from the same event that Trump got it.
21647,The timeline doesn't seem to make sense for Trump to have infected him.
21648,He received a new drug which is only available to a few people in this world.
21649,Drug works it seems.

21671,What agenda does Gates have other than improving quality and accessibility of healthcare globally?
21672,Who is being harmed by this?
21673,People like Gates and Musk have expanded into fields they had little knowledge of and were still able to be incredibly successful in their endeavors even despite making mistakes.
21674,Want to know how?
21675,Instead of insulting others with more knowledge they listened to those who knew more and learned and acted on the advice given.
21676,Why would they lie about having the most cases on earth?
21677,People in China tried to report it and it quickly got covered up.
21678,Some of the Dr's even went missing.
21679,A better idea would be to just shut up about it.
21680,That too....
21681,&gt;You could go clubbing for fucks sake.
21682,Sounds fun.
21683,Hungary did the same.
21684,"Anyway, what were you doing traveling around Europe in the middle of a pandemic?"
21685,One thing covid had proved is that you are unable to hide or ignore any outbreak.

21687,It's unfortunate but wild polio is much more dangerous.

21695,Will be necessary and right but many won’t agree.
21696,"&gt; We did a good job

Debatable

&gt; once we realized hospitals across the country were fine

It's a dynamic situation."
21697,Once cases start to rise again so will the absolute numbers needing to go to hospital as a proportion of cases will always go on to get sick.
21698,What goes down can go up again.
21699,&gt; people started to get their freedoms back.
21700,The virus really doesn't care in the slightest.
21701,It will take advantage of any opportunity to spread.
21702,"Do things one way and it probably won't, do it another way it'll explode and all the sickness will follow in its wake."
21703,"All the states and territories of Australia did similar things, hence the 1st waves for all of them being centred around March April."
21704,"https://infogram.com/1p0lp9vmnqd3n9te63x3q090ketnx57evn5?live

The virus exploited just one crack in the quarantine in Melbourne Victoria and the massive second wave, much larger than the first hit them and them only (blue on the graph, everyone else else hasn't had one to date) and they've only just managed to wrestle it back down to near levels things were back in June when the 2nd wave took off."
21705,"They didn't do anything appreciably different, there was a lot of bad fortune involved but a very restrictive set of controls had to be done to pull this off and they're still in place because they haven't quite gotten back to pre the second wave yet as it's being stubbornly resistant at the end there."
21706,"They can still pull it off, it's wildly out of control in far too many American states in comparison, though."
21707,"Key thing is, though is if the disease is endemic enough, well some of your freedoms are going to go with it."
21708,"Even if the state doesn't 'take' them from you, the virus will by the increased risk of making you sick just by being out there in a large distribution."
21709,"I know I keep sarcastically saying, 2 more weeks to flatten the curve, on here but I am actually curious, at what point do we shift strategies and shift to what?"
21710,Which restrictions are Redditors for and which are they not?
21711,I'm super interested to see what people here say.
21712,"Personally, I say keep mostly the same restrictions through winter because experts are predicting a bad one with Corona and the Flu."
21713,"In April though, it's time to open as much as possible but keep masks mandates in place until the vaccine is widely distributed."
21714,I don't think strict social distancing can continue after the spring either.
21715,Capacity limits will have to be relaxed unless there is a huge aid package to get through the year.
21716,What do you all think?
21717,"Stil, nowhere near the US."
21718,"Russia has 144 million citizens, and this is almost identical to the 1st wave."
21719,So what's interesting is that Dr. Fauci [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/theater/fauci-theater-reopen.html) in an interview a couple of weeks ago that he thought it would be safe to be maskless at an indoor event by fall 2021.
21720,So this headline is right in line with that.
21721,Of course this is predicated on the vaccine working and large numbers of people getting it.
21722,Moscow introducing new restrictions again.
21723,Second wave is hitting hard.
21724,I mean unless you have muscles 5’9 170 is going to definitely be overweight.
21725,I’m 5’9 myself and weigh 140lbs currently but when I was pregnant I hit 170lbs and looked like a whale!
21726,Discussion?
21727,"That is if the vaccine is accepted by people which,let's be real here, there are tons of anti vaxxers who will continue to make this a problem for people."
21728,and who is responsible for the lonely death of those people.
21729,Surely you not blaming COVID as it is not the first infectious disease around.
21730,It is the bizarre policies by health authorities who let those people die without family members.
21731,Surely PPE should have been available for families to say their goodbye.
21732,"There is far more infectious diseases in the world, particularly on my continent Africa such as Ebola."
21733,a small holiday is around the corner and Madrid has the most people traveling so its an attempt to limit those movements.
21734,"As is the drop in Florida right before schools opened back up, especially since deaths have been hovering around 150/day since early August..."
21735,What about schools?
21736,They seem to have exploded covid in Poland.
21737,We are fucked since our hospitals were in shambles before and nothing was done to improve them.
21738,Hopefully schools will be closed this week.
21739,America can't or rather won't gather resources the way China does.
21740,Medical resources are private properties.
21741,That would harm someone's inerest.
21742,They won't allow it.
21743,Here in Florida we call that Thursday.
21744,Looks like that average is still lower than it was at the end of September.
21745,"I can't tell if you're stupid, scared,  or both but the average is definitely not heading up,  especially not if you go by the actual date of the death."

21747,Aborigines do not burn when there is no dew on the ground.
21748,It is part of their method.
21749,"If there was no white settlement in Australia but exactly the same weather, then the fires last season would have been exactly the same, for the same reason."
21750,Aborigines can’t do a litter clearing (controlled burn) without the right conditions either.
21751,Every EU country makes the same mistake.
21752,Schools open without compulsory surveillance testing among students.
21753,"Wave builds among younger ones, then spills over to older adults."
21754,Its a freaking shit-show.
21755,Technically Spring
21756,"When a virus is widespread it does not matter where you get infected, it can happen everywhere, that is community transmission, already happening in Berlin and other parts of germany."
21757,We are at about 1.64 here 7 day rolling average.
21758,A lot of schools are remote and hybrid.
21759,That’s going to change soon.
21760,"lol, its fine, its not like out peeps over here are super conscious, we have just the same dorks that would say the same :D"
21761,"&gt; When you get sick with one thing, your immune system is busy fighting that."

21764,"The cross interactions between antibodies and different pathogens in your body is a lot more complicated, where sometimes antibodies from one disease also work for other diseases, and sometimes having one set of antibodies makes another disease worse"
21765,But I thought they had the vaccine already?
21766," 

I'm working on a project where I'm documenting the pandemic and looking for people to share their experiences, thoughts and feelings on the virus."
21767,"I would like to incorporate handwritten experiences, thoughts and feelings about the virus in my book."
21768,Those could be good/bad very short or long whatever your feeling!

21772,New Zealand did the same thing China did: Lockdown + testing + Managed isolation.
21773,It's neither rocket science nor overly draconian.
21774,"It's just painted as too draconian by the media back in Jan/Feb, which talked the West into a corner."
21775,What it takes is mere a high level of public trust and decisive decision making.
21776,"&gt; given to Putin’s daughter but not Putin

I thought that was so sketchy at the time."
21777,I would not be able to scold my daughter with a straight face even if she spiked my tea with polonium after pulling that shit.
21778,Since each individual state has not incentive to lie - i don't see why they would.
21779,"Granted, there are plenty that aren't tested and likely positive cases; but i don't think any state is changing their positive numbers."
21780,No.
21781,You can’t beat people into submission to save them.
21782,Just like you can’t bomb for piece or have sex to save virginity.
21783,"If people aren’t listening, that’s your marketing problem, not an invitation to move your “India Stick” from your bedside table to beating people on the streets."
21784,That’s fascism.
21785,"And fascism loses, no matter what you do to hold on to power."
21786,It’s inevitable.
21787,"Like a white dwarf, headed for supernova."
21788,It’s physics.
21789,A universal truth.
21790,Kind of like the truth that you’re acting arrogant on the internet praising public beatings.
21791,That’s messed up.
21792,You should seek help.
21793,The side effects don’t seem too bad though.
21794,"If that were truly the extent of them, I’d consider it."
21795,&gt;	New reports to come out of clinical studies have found that 1 in 7 people suffered from side-effects post being inoculated by the Russian vaccine.
21796,"The Soviet nation's health minister, Mikhail Murashko, in a statement to Moscow Times said that nearly 14% of patients who have been administrated the vaccine reported suffering from side-effects."
21797,"&gt;	However, terming the side-effects to be mild and routine, Murashko still said that the Russian vaccine is still safer and at-par with global competitors."
21798,"&gt;	“Approximately 14 per cent have small complaints of weakness, muscle pain for 24 hours and an occasional increase in body temperature,”
&gt;	Terming these effects to be normal, the minister also said that the symptoms were 'level off' by the next day and they would keep tracking vitals to notice adversities if any."
21799,"cool cool cool, so glad people had to die in order to go out there and make fleshlights."
21800,You do realize lockdown just meant non-essential businesses?
21801,"No curfew, not Marshall Law?"
21802,"I'm not saying drastic lockdowns are always the answer, but science has to have a place in policy."
21803,They didn't really stop anything if all the govt.
21804,had to do was use a different law to do it.
21805,Trump has killed 211k people and infected millions.
21806,How many people is Gates responsible for dying?
21807,Cue snitching any second now...
21808,What the hell?
21809,May is 7 months away.
21810,Further with a vaccine basic social distancing gradually becomes unnecessary
21811,What?
21812,!
21813,Europe and most other countries also test less than the US.
21814,Good way to keep numbers down.
21815,Its not being administered to everyone yet.
21816,And yet Russia already has a vaccine.
21817,"See, guys?"
21818,A vaccine is *not* the end of things.
21819,This just *proves* it.
21820,"We still need to keep restrictions until the numbers are in our favor, regardless of whether a vaccine is available or not."
21821,"Otherwise we are going to keep seeing higher and higher daily case counts, which, as we all know, is *not* good for public health."
21822,"Oh, thanks."
21823,I missed the revert message.
21824,Politics does seem to stand in it's own way a lot these days.
21825,And especially in the way of science :(
21826,Again what is he saying that is inaccurate or untrue?
21827,I don't give a fuck what his vocation is or was.
21828,How is he wrong?
21829,Lol it's been a while since I've been on this sub I forgot how much the mods fucking suck here.
21830,They deleted that comment for being too political.
21831,"Wow, 919."
21832,That's quite high isn't it?
21833,They have never said masks were useless.
21834,They have even added masks in care settings where it wasn’t required before.
21835,You shouldn’t mistake your interpretation of an opinion piece from an agency’s official stance on something.
21836,Girl in the thumbnail is mad stylish
21837,Essential to the owner so they don’t you know lose everything they worked for; the employees probably like shelter and running water as well.
21838,herding humans is sometimes as easy as herding cats and other times as easy as herding rocks.
21839,"Well, respiratory pathogens spread more efficiently in colder weather anyway."
21840,"Also it is because people are driven indoors, with poor ventilation that will lead to further spread."
21841,"Not to mention we have many major events, and holidays coming up."
21842,"We have Halloween, a major national election that will likely have record turn out, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's."
21843,"We saw a major epidemic after Memorial Day, and the 4th of July."
21844,I can't imagine how it will be during the winter holiday season.
21845,"Lol, I like how China is used as some sort of baseline."
21846,Fucking finally.
21847,I am so tired of seeing 20 year old dies of covid and has no preexisting conditions.
21848,Then they show a picture and the person is like 400lbs.
21849,Maybe this will push people to stop being lazy and actually care about their bodies.
21850,Who the fuck has sympathy for americans lool every post i see on reddit is people calling americans retarded
21851,"Eh, not all democracies."
21852,There are still sane countries out there.
21853,[removed]
21854,Trump as well
21855,In what way are any of his statements on this pandemic wrong?
21856,You are right he is not a scientist or a doctor but he has significantly more knowledge on this topic than most other laypeople and his understanding of all of this is critical to keeping his foundation open and solvent so the work  can continue.
21857,"Ouch, sick burn."
21858,How does it feel to literally not be able to continue a discussion without resorting to calling someone a name?
21859,"You lost the argument, move on."
21860,How do you confuse coronavirus with a “subscribe” button?
21861,"This would require the vaccine to be administered en masse, people to want to take the vaccine, &amp; for whatever limited capacity they will return at to be profitable for opening."
21862,"That is if people start following basic social distancing practices, however NYC is on the verge of rolling back all its reopening back to shut down restrictions."
21863,May 2021 is hopeful thinking but still unlikely given how NY &amp; the Country as a whole has treated the virus
21864,That's more Florida than every other country is Florida!
21865,yup.
21866,I'm done being chicken little.
21867,The sky really is falling and I've given up trying to protect others.
21868,I now wear a full face respirator to work because boss caught Covid and now wants us back at work regardless of what tests come back negative and regardless of how long we had been in contact with him.

22108,"I don't need to hear preaching about this being a bad idea - since, in the scheme of the way the West is handling this Virus, it most certainly is within the realm of logical."
22109,"For instance, my mortality this year is 1.8% without COVID."
22110,"COVID would increase it about 30%,  less than many other actions I might take part in (shooting drugs, a lot of motorcycling riding, base jumping and even high stress life situations (Heart attacks is likely get me, let alone cancer and accidents)."
22111,"So, being as there may or may not be a vaccine - and, if so, it still would only be X effective, it stands to reason that people up to a certain risk level might have a reason to want to ""get it over with"" even given the statistics."
22112,"In my case, it's probably 4X as deadly as a Flu and the general world out there would be fine with me getting - or not - a Flu vaccine or such."
22113,"Given the millions of minds that have been thinking about this Virus, I expected to be able to find sane discussions and even programs."
22114,"Perhaps Governments are not going to allow this sort of thing, preferring that people get infected just by chance (often at bad times and places)?"
22115,If anyone had links to a discussion I'd appreciate hearing about it.
22116,The only reason it wasn’t the entire US was states not running their shit well.
22117,Talk to your governors about their failures.
22118,It is not the federal government’s responsibility to enforce authoritarian rule over the fifty states.

22123,Make America EU Again?

22213,You build cages for them and isolate them from the rest of the population for breaking federal and state rules and regulations.
22214,"To me this sounded like ""we should jail anti-mask protest participants"" yeah good luck getting that to happen anywhere in the West, especially in the USA."
22215,You can break apart protests but jailing the participants won't go over well with a lot of people.
22216,"Even if you did all of that other stuff, you will literally never get perfect compliance, especially considering people transfer the virus in households where even the most pro-mask people don't wear masks."
22217,So there would still be transmission even if you got people to wear them in public.
22218,"People still shoot each other, steal, drive drunk, and smuggle drugs despite all of that being illegal, and way more people agree about those things being bad versus masks where there are entire countries that don't use masks to the degree that even the USA does."
22219,Compliance to the degree you are seeking just because you made something have harsh punishments under the law can not and will not ever happen.
22220,Exactly.
22221,So gotta protect him another 4 years now
22222,Restaurants operate on pretty thin margins.
22223,"Free rent is great, but you still have to pay to have the lights on, pay to have employees on hand, pay to have the food on hand, pay to have the food kept cold, pay various insurances and taxes, pay to clean the grease trap, pay for garbage service."
22224,"Some food can keep for a while, but some food only has a shelf life of a few days."
22225,"If there is no traffic, these costs can eat you up."
22226,Murder charges should certainly be coming if this man dies.

22243,"Any post even remotely anti-China gets downvoted immediately, even if it's not political and backed by sources."
22244,It's hard to do anything in the Federal Government right now.
22245,It used to be understood you were just doing your job unless you had an elected or cabinet position.
22246,Now if they praise anything the administration does or report any positive news they are treated like they are waving a campaign flag by both sides.
22247,Discredited by one side and used by the other.
22248,&gt;I could argue a lot of large gatherings are not important or essential  but I am a person with empathy and know that socializing is super important for a lot of people and for mental health.
22249,Well that's more than I can say for most on this sub.
22250,Fair enough.
22251,"In my job, I've been teleworking since March."
22252,There was a sliver of hope to get back to the office in July/August and then cases started spiking again.
22253,Now the state I live in just had it's deadliest day of the pandemic and has match it's either death toll for the month of AUGUST in the first 7 days of this month.
22254,"No mask mandate, and there are counties that met the criteria to have a stay-at-home order put in place."

22256,You're welcome to provide a source that says otherwise.
22257,The family and close friends have to get it from somewhere.
22258,Worked at lowes can confirm it was understaffed with high turnover
22259,"Why do they get to ""approve"" investigators?"
22260,Yea I am sure the investigation is not rigged at all.
22261,Of course it's extremely difficult to keep the virus from reaching older people.

22282,Actually that's great news.
22283,Runny nose  and (ahem) productive cough are symptoms that CV-19 does not share with the flu or common cold.
22284,"Don't forget, all those other nasties are still around."
22285,We have the data
22286,Dont you blaspheme the Worm.
22287,"I have my doubts about that number as well, but there’s no evidence it won’t be either."
22288,"There's also many people who get it, have a mild case and start to think it's overblown."
22289,80-90% is incredible.
22290,"That's about what the mumps vaccine is and although we still have an outbreak or two pop up, it makes the news because it's so rare."

22299,"Do you have a source on the ""no research using cell lines derived from foetal tissue"" point?"
22300,I’m torn between my desire to have this corrupt administration fully punished and my desire to see America heal and move on.
22301,I’m not so sure we can get both.
22302,"Of course, but a more coordinated national policy on when it’s safe to open back up and a mask mandate could have kept cases lower and reduced the prolonged uncertainty."
22303,Its to increase public confidence in the vaccine.
22304,"You see it all the time on this sub, a lot of people are wary about a vaccine cleared under the current administration."
22305,As a non-American I think its stupid but I don't blame the FDA for doing it.
22306,We can all thank stupid Trump for that.

22317,Totally agree on the outcomes.
22318,"My 78 year old overweight aunt and her 80 year old husband, my diabetic uncle, both recovered pretty quickly from COVID in May."
22319,"They seem to have no lasting effects, either."
22320,My bosses dad is 92 and just finished chemo in June was barely symptomatic when he contacted the virus in July.
22321,Several residents at his nursing home died during the little outbreak there.
22322,This virus is a fickle mistress.
22323,"It wasn’t until about the mid to late 1900’s that Predicate logic, Boolean Logic and Non-Euclidean Mathematics made us think of logic in a universal and normative way."
22324,We realized that we can do more with logic if we stop focusing on incontrovertible truths and what we can deduce from them but rather the relationship between the prepositions themselves.
22325,Through this transformation we drastically expanded on this philosophy from which brought us into the modern computing age that we now live in.
22326,"Logic has come a long way from its etymological root, Logos."
22327,"(Word,Reason)   The development of the modern ""symbolic"" or ""mathematical"" logic from roughly 1950s on is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history."
22328,"Modern logic has more similarity with calculus than it does reasoning, Aristotelian Logic or traditional logic in that its rules of operation are determined by the symbols and not the meaning of the symbols it employs."
22329,The beauty of modern logic is that any dispute among a premise is easily fixable and non destructive to what we can derive from the argument itself rather than the painstaking abstraction and formalizing theories of everyday language.
22330,These distinctions that I mention above are merely the tip of an iceberg that continues to grow as we continue to better understand logical relationships.
22331,"Due to this somewhat recent renaissance in logic after   5 centuries of little expansion of the subject, I think it is imperative to recognize the differentiation between reasoning and logic."
22332,There is much more to the story then most realize.

22381,That's a hot take for sure...
22382,You hit on a key point.
22383,The masks are important but the increased testing was key as well.
22384,It really seems like in that case the tests weren’t available as they ramped up production.
22385,The CDC playing DUH I DON’T KNOW on the masks did not help either.

22403,"Infuriates me, honestly if I didn't love it here so much I'd move."
22404,But the current Covid death count does include tons of deaths where existing conditions were exacerbated by Covid.
22405,"The vast majority of death certificates for Covid had major preexisting conditions, and were counted as Covid deaths in a way that flu has never been."

22411,It is just as easy to make the case that flu is vastly under estimated as an exacerbating cause of death (where do all those extra heart attacks come from in the winter?)
22412,than it is that flu is over estimated.

22538,"Funny thing is, they got rid of a lot of office space and desks during the lockdown, so there are less flex desks than there are people, so the team can't sit together while maintaining a safe distance anyway."
22539,These are the geniuses I'm supposed to trust with my health.
22540,I told them I'll only come back if forced.
22541,We'll see how good team spirit is when  I pull up to the stand up meeting rocking a full Hazmat suit lol.
22542,I don't understand the fucking rush to get the peons back to the office when we can work from home 100%.
22543,"Some people prefer working in the office, that's fine, everyone has to make their own risk assessment."
22544,So make it optional.
22545,Forcing people to risk their health will not help team spirit.
22546,It has to be difficult to see how much progress we've made on the vaccination and treatment fronts with your head so far up your ass.
22547,"We have failed in many ways to implement policy to curb the spread of Covid, but that needs to be looked at in a state by state basis since that is the major level of coordination."
22548,I'm in SF and our response here has been quite effective in mitigating the spread.
22549,"Our failures have generally been in quickly implementing new and extremely foreign concepts (like mass testing and sheltering in place), but our ifr and deaths per capita are pretty similar to other European nations that are not criticized nearly as much for their response."
22550,"Again, widespread implementation of a vaccine is something that we do on a comparable scale every single year- there is no magic needed here."
22551,"If you actually take the time to look at the phase II trial data for the leading candidates, you'll see that the antibody titers elicited in vulnerable populations is quite good."
22552,"The most at risk will be receiving the vaccine first, and this will move us along quickly towards reopening."
22553,"Covid is a major concern for the elderly, but it is statistically an insignificant threat for most of the population."
22554,"It doesn't really matter if 50% of Americans say they won't take it, the reality is that the vast majority of American people are moving towards normalized living, and those who don't trust the vaccine will just be at heightened risk."
22555,"Schools are acknowledging it, and will slowly make an action plan."

22557,"My district is having all students take a beginning of the year test to assess loss of learning for the end of last year, then tests throughout  the year to assess loss of learning for this year."
22558,"It sucks, but it’s just the reality of living during a global event like this."
22559,Kids in Europe during WWI and II definitely experienced a disruption of their education.
22560,There are endless other examples.
22561,"It’s not reasonable to expect that while a lot of the world comes to a screeching halt, kids educations will continue perfectly normally."
22562,"It’s just reality, even if it isn’t a pleasant one."
22563,"Also, I’m teaching online and while I’d never say it’s just as good as in person school, I can assure you that my kids are learning."
22564,"I’m working my ass off to make sure that I give them as much as I can, and that they’re having fun doing it."
22565,It’s definitely working better than the cobbled together hybrid models.
22566,It’s the best option considering the circumstances.
22567,"I figure even if our children don’t advance as academically as they would in a standard school year, they are learning and growing and figuring out how to manage different bits of life."

22569,And they know this.

22576,Saying the fact that Utah has one of the lowest death rates in the country?
22577,"I'm sure the judge is going to throw the book at anyone who dares to point out the reality that the places with the four highest death rates are all democrat controlled, super liberal states."

22581,Have China really managed to control the virus this well?
22582,"If so, what have they done to control the virus so well?"
22583,"Even if you think the gains outweigh the risks, any parent who says they aren't concerned about covid danger at schools makes me think they probably shouldn't be a parent."
22584,"In the time that you've asked me to ""summerize"" it you could've already watched it two times."
22585,"This is a bit odd and sudden, but I would assume that they're just planning ahead as the CDC had already asked the state to do."

22590,"&gt; Didn't you all try this bullshit in March, April, May, June, July and August only to be proven wrong over and over and over again?"
22591,"Some might have, but it would be dumb because we didn't have the data for March, April, May, June, July, August, and now September."
22592,People on this subreddit were saying Sweden defeated the virus and had achieved immunity.
22593,It us now evidently not true.
22594,"&gt;Not saying that's likely or probable, but when it comes down to viral mutations, there's always a chance..."
22595,Comments like this are true but also insanely silly.
22596,This could happen for ANY VIRUS.
22597,Matter of fact influenza not only can but routinely does mutate to create very nasty strains.
22598,"The idea that ""Well it COULD mutate"" means nothing."
22599,There are literally untold number of viruses that COULD mutate at anytime.
22600,So what is your point?
22601,But russia claimed they were the first to have a vaccine!
22602,So weird how it wasn't mass produced and stopped all these daily cases :P

22608,Still it’s worrying with an increase cases though.
22609,It's not asking for sympathy.
22610,It pointing at the absense of it on some people.
22611,"Or at the very least selective sympathy, which i would argue is hardly sympathy at all."
22612,Did I ask for you to transcribe it?
22613,No.
22614,I asked if you could summarize it and the points you think are relevant since you're posting it as evidence to support your comments.
22615,If it's only 10min then it's safe for me to assume you've watched it and can summarize it.
22616,Not uniformly across the world no....large parts of the world are just fine.
22617,WHO Africa region and WHO Western Pacific are doing largely ok.
22618,"They equate to almost 2.5bn people that are mostly ok, which is 1/3 of humanity."
22619,The countries in East Asia and Oceania have sustained supressing their epidemics even when there were multiple rises.
22620,Africa never had a big wave to begin with.
22621,So they have a grip on it.
22622,"Meanwhile, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas are struggling hard."
22623,"The interesting thing is apparently, Latin America is hit the hardest and in general Spanish-speaking countries."
22624,"Listing countries by reported deaths/million, 10/20 of the highest listed countries speak either Spanish or in the case of Brazil Portuguese."

Bullshit."
22635,"My education in physics is very competitive on the world stage, I don't feel significantly disadvantaged to, say, MIT alumni (I personally know some)."
22636,"I publish in top journals, attend international conferences, collaborate with foreign scientists, and my peers from Russia work all over the world, including such top-rate facilities as LANL or CERN."
22637,"&gt;Almost everyone who are still left in Russia, doesn't give a f*ck."
22638,"Look at what happened at Khabarovsk

Yes, exactly, look at Khabarovsk!"
22639,Khabarovsk would have been *unimaginable* just 4 years ago.
22640,That's the precursor of the oncoming changes.
22641,&gt;Government ignored them.
22642,Exactly!
22643,The government *ignored* the protestors.
22644,"That's an insane upgrade from forcefully dispersing the protests, that never happened before 2018."
22645,&gt;Navalny was poisoned.
22646,Also a sign of desperation.
22647,"With all their propaganda and political repressions, they can't even suppress Navalny anymore without physically removing him."
22648,"Navalny is important, but he's not required."
22649,Time is much more powerful than Navalny.

China was the only one testing abnormal pneumonia, first to blow the whistle and take the blame when everyone else was in denial or coverup."
22668,"China had to find out how deadly the virus was with no prior reference, had to figure out asymptomatic transmission, airborne transmission and surface transmission from scratch."
22669,"China had to map the virus genome, had to developed PCR test kits from scratch, had to develop every treatment we now know from scratch."

Other East Asian countries had it all mapped out for them, had the virus contained in China for them, had PPEs and test kits developed for them, they didn't fuck up, that's to their credit, but in no universe do they even come close China in term of response, and frankly should show at least a little bit of gratitude."

22683,"I'll never talk crap about anyone that loves WFH or wants to WFH because I am right there with them, it had definite perks and was safer for everyone, but working in the office hasn't been so bad."

22700,AZ has no mask mandate nor did it ever.
22701,FL didn't either.
22702,While those States did start to allow localities to impose some there was no state-wide mask mandate in either one.
22703,FL still allows localities to impose a mask mandate but they are prohibited from fining anybody.
22704,In the mean time Georgia actually BANNED localities from passing a mask mandate.
22705,"They settled and let localities pass one but **it businesses can opt-out without any penalty**


Still, Georgia saw the same rise and fall in cases, hospitalizations, etc as the rest of the South."

22708,Taxis were unreliable at best if you couldn't hail one outside and the cost was higher...being able to get picked up in a few minutes and know where they are/when they'll be there versus maybe one will show up eventually.

22752,Finding 800 cases with 80k tests was probably a worse sign than finding 800 cases with 140k tests.

22826,"I mean yeah, I'm not an idiot."
22827,I'm not here saying billion dollar corporations and special interests aren't donating to political parties because reasons.
22828,"""All of them!"""
22829,That's the only point of any social media site.
22830,No shit Sherlock
22831,GOT EM!
22832,Are you?
22833,“Turn the tide” because during the first wave they killed off the only demographic with a Covid morbidity rate?
22834,Lol
22835,None of what you said is in any way relevant to what I said so I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
22836,It's going to be many millions.
22837,And it's going to cause our world economy to collapse.
22838,It's just a matter of time.
22839,The vaccine will come too late.
22840,Don't let [reality](https://i.imgur.com/3DKleIF.png) ruin a perfectly good narrative.
22841,[removed]
22842,Nah this is Reddit.
22843,"All we do here is talk about how The US is worse than a 3rd world country and every person there has 30 IQ and stumbles around with their pot belly hanging out, mask underneath the chin, AR 57 strapped to their back to go to Walmart to buy 9 billion dollar a pill medication."
22844,Is anyone else annoyed with these “crushing records” headlines?
22845,It’s been constantly worded this way for months and it’s disturbing.
22846,This is some booming stock price or box office movie hit.
22847,People are sick.
22848,It’s because nobody wears a mask and everyone wants to go hang out
22849,I'm basing it on American rates of COVID-19 transmission.
22850,"Each state has their own policy on masks, tracing, and testing."
22851,The pandemic is really working for her.
22852,"In Italy most people have been wearing masks for a long time, especially in the areas that were hit hardest in spring (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia)."
22853,Most people wear them even outdoors nowadays.
22854,Stop treating masks like they're this huge game changing measure.
22855,They're not.
22856,[removed]
22857,Some of those are arbitrary rules with no evidence behind them.
22858,It isn't like earlier on.
22859,And the administration has also repeatedly shown that it will not hesitate to exert undue and unscientific pressure on the FDA (and the CDC for that matter) to advance its own political interests.
22860,They have shown a terrifying disdain and dismissal of scientific facts and expertise.
22861,I don't understand why you would mock me.
22862,Why are you bringing all this emotion to the /new section of this subreddit?
22863,Dude...
22864,Deaths lag infections by weeks.
22865,The math on confirmed deaths / confirmed cases will always be a tiny number if the cases are growing quickly.
22866,"Current CDC estimates of IFR for Covid range by age group, going as high as 10% for 70+, and as a low as 0.002% for 0-19."
22867,"So yeah, it's not that deadly to the general population."
22868,"College kids are basically safe, don't worry about them."
22869,"Their professors, their medical providers, eh, whatever."
22870,College kids don't need to worry.
22871,"That said, those are under non-overloaded healthcare conditions."
22872,"This is that whole ""flatten the curve"" thing which we largely did with much pain (prevent a disaster, and people will think it was an overreaction)."
22873,Exponential disease growth + 18 months or more for a vaccine means that we need a strategy that isn't going to push us over ER capacity if we want to keep the IFR low.
22874,"This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon."
22875,Always has been.
22876,"But yeah, there is a real mental health cost to the pandemic response."
22877,The marathon needs to be done with an eye on mental health.
22878,"I really do wish people were talking more about mental health, but it's honestly hard to have a discussion about mental health cost when people are resisting getting the first wave under control."
22879,Wouldn't it be nice if we could get it under control like East Asian or New Zealand so that we could just let things go back to a more normal state?
22880,It's really shortsighted selfishness to that has led the US into such a purgatory of half-open with constant threat of closings and lockdowns because we never got anything under control.
22881,Japan is doing better than us and has done it by cancelling the olympics and everyone wearing face-masks.
22882,They didn't cancel going to the office or public transit.
22883,Just added masks.
22884,It's insane that we can't control it at least that well.
22885,"But yeah, ""My body, my choice, fuck everyone else""."
22886,Good.
22887,I have a dear friend whose mother was a pretty entrenched narcissist.
22888,It took her a long time to sort out what was actually nurturing and what was superiority posturing once she had her own kids.
22889,"One of her mother's big things was how people are responsible for their own happiness and should think positively about everything, pushing aside all negatives."
22890,"It's not that such a thing isn't possible, it's just not that healthy; we need support and understanding, not platitudes."
22891,"So, what's your proposal?"
22892,Letting the virus unchecked?
22893,How is that going to help to keep jobs?
22894,The only countries that worried about the economy were those who took early measures and controlled the problem.
22895,"Some of them poorer than Romania, by the way."
22896,"Once you let the fire took over the house, it's late and hipocrital to pretend concern and seriousness."
22897,Some societies are activelly harming themselves and then crying foul like children when the consrquences come.
22898,Sadly it's happening all aroumd Europe.
22899,I think so
22900,"Bill Gates is one of the world's leading healthcare philanthropists, fighting diseases &amp; illnesses in impoverished countries for decades!"
22901,You're only hearing about his role as public health advocate now because the US and Western countries are facing grave outbreaks for the first time in a century.
22902,"But he's been on the frontlines of pandemics in Africa, Asia &amp; Latin America forever and has expertise on how to contain &amp; mitigate diseases and boost health outcomes on a national level."
22903,LET'S GOOOOOOOO
22904,&gt; Finding 800 cases with 80k tests was probably a worse sign than finding 800 cases with 140k tests.
22905,That depends on the criteria used to determine who is tested.
22906,"When the tests were restricted to only those most likely to have COVID, of course the percentages were much higher."
22907,"The fact of the matter remains - there are as many reported cases now as there were in the beginning of June, after the criteria were relaxed."
22908,"As for right now, the FHM is still recommending that only people with symptoms or who have come into contact with confirmed cases be tested."
22909,Under those conditions more tests means more people showing symptoms or coming into contact with active cases... that's not a good sign at all.
22910,"&gt; -- Putin probably

Cuomo definitely"
22911,Absolutely not.
22912,There is little to no information that we can take from the Russian government and trust it to be accurate.
22913,I've done some reporting on Russian politics before (some years ago) but the situation has become insanely authoritarian.
22914,"In the last Russian ""election"" there were videos of ballot-stuffing, burning ballots, throwing ballots away, and other completely-undemocratic things."
22915,"If you think about it, Putin claims he got something like 96% of the vote in the last election."
22916,"That is a made-up number that was specifically picked to help make his regime appear legitimately-elected and democratic, when in fact it's JUST the opposite."
22917,"&amp;#x200B;

Not a stupid question at all."
22918,There are no stupid questions if you don't know the answer.
22919,"Better to ask than to wonder, right?"
22920,"It should, but too many Americans don't wear them or wear them wrong."
22921,"I did not disagree with that, I do."
22922,"And there were absolutely no capacity restrictions, social distancing guidelines, reduced capacity/cleaning on rides, or masks then."
22923,"Yes, opening a theme park in the way most people think of the times they’ve been to theme parks is a terrible idea."
22924,But with the restrictions it’s relatively safe.
22925,"Not saying it’s the wisest thing to do, but I think it’s safe enough to give people that choice."
22926,Obama was in office then.
22927,They also expect the titans to follow social distancing guidelines
22928,[removed]
22929,"Yeah, as i said you can apply that sentiment to 99% countries in the world."
22930,"And if you yourself are American or British or something like that, this sentiment is also extremely hypocritical."
22931,You're not getting the point.
22932,Schools are not like it was before.
22933,8 per classroom and twice a week.
22934,Same for Universities in NY.
22935,It's half and half with less students per classroom.
22936,I honestly think a lot of people don't give children enough credit.
22937,"They're far more adaptable to technology than their parents often are, and there is a WEALTH of info to be gained on the internet."
22938,"And, generally, younger people are much better at parsing that info and absorbing it in this form."
22939,The whole damm world is hitting record highs at this point.
22940,"&gt;South Dakota set records Thursday for active cases, hospitalizations and new deaths,... 

&gt;That contradicted assurances by Gov."
22941,"Kristi Noem, a Republican whose plan for combating the virus has focused on increasing treatment capacity rather than preventing infection."

22945,"I will take, ""*Human Hubris and Idiocy*,"" for $500, Alex."
22946,No.
22947,Not unless COVID is the only cause in all these deaths.
22948,"They are working, but they are not sufficient if you also have schools and all sorts of other things that should be completely shut down open."
22949,"And, of course, if you are not wearing proper masks and not wearing them properly."
22950,"Most importantly, the rest of the world refuses to learn from China, even after it has been proven so many times that what China did ever since the initial screwups is the only way to deal with the virus."
22951,"Which means hard lockdown of the whole country until you get to near-zero cases, then hard lockdowns and testing absolutely everyone in any local area where the virus shows up."
22952,The western governments just don't get it.
22953,"Or rather, perhaps they do, but they think it is ""more expensive"" to do that than to let the virus run through the population."
22954,"Which leads us to the question of ""more expensive"" for who?"
22955,"Because it is the general population that will pay the price, not the corporate oligarchy that controls the governments..."
22956,"Yeah, sounds about right."
22957,"Seems like the whole world is spiking again, I remember in the Summer when it seemed like we were turning things around, and starting to get back to normal."
22958,"Being a small island nation, our one that can send non persons to work camps can help."
22959,You think so huh?
22960,"&gt;The European health regulator said on Tuesday (link) it would launch a ""rolling review"" of the coronavirus vaccine being developed by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX), days after it announced a similar decision for the competing vaccine of AstraZeneca (AZN.LN) and the University of Oxford."
22961,"&gt;A rolling review means the regulator will start examining the data from laboratory, animal and human testing in real time, without waiting for the whole set to be submitted at the end of the so-called Phase 3 trials."
22962,"&gt;""This does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,"" the European Medicines Agency said in its release."
22963,"&gt;As it did in the AstraZeneca case (link), the EMA said it had launched the process because ""preliminary results from nonclinical and early clinical studies in adults (...) suggest that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and T cells that target the virus."""
22964,"they didnt ""control"" for it, but it's certainly something we need to keep in mind as we analyze the findings of this study."
22965,[removed]
22966,Oh now looks like you’re getting over 500 cases a day.
22967,Feel good now ?
22968,So are you tipping every time you go out regardless of the service?
22969,"as the virus mutates it can become more contagious, however it typically and seems in this case less potent and aggressive."
22970,so they symptoms are less extreme as well the care is more efficient as the ICU beds are not overflowing.
22971,It's so sad seeing the condition in my country.
22972,"Now we're sitting at 300k+ total case, but this week there is a mass protest everywhere because the government made some skecthy rules and everyone seems not to care about this virus at all now."
22973,Idk how to feel about this.
22974,"It might be a stupid question, but I’ll ask it anyway - do vote counts reflect actual votes in putin’s Russia?"
22975,"Yeah, but Korea isn't America."
22976,You guys care for public health.
22977,The religion of Covid.
22978,Thoughtful debate is great.
22979,"Rethinking hypotheses, great."
22980,This sub is all about the religion of Covid.
22981,"All 3 of those (Russia, China, and Australia governments) restrict the freedom of their citizens and attempt to control them, far more than most governments do."
22982,America is one of the more free countries.
22983,"Only problem is drugs not being completely legal, and a few other things, but most countries have that problem."
22984,Underrated comment.
22985,And what if China got it from US?
22986,😂🤣😂 Theres an audio tape of a certain person bragging about how he knew the virus was dangerous and transmissible in January.
22987,We know they were massive because even with testing only priority /severe cases and healthcare staff there were still hundreds of confirmed daily.
22988,Thank you!
22989,Here in Russia it's annoying to see the numbers going up so steadily without any real measures to contain - and don't get me started on the amount of people not wearing masks and things.
22990,"People still wear them in stores and things, but on the bus and metro so many people are without them."
22991,Here in Moscow they are only now starting to take measures again by ordering at least 30% of staff to work from home as well as lots of schools switching to remote learning - they seem to be in denial about what measures they need to take to really make a difference.
22992,"We need another quarantine, and we are expecting it to happen in the next month or so (hopefully) but it's clear that they are dreading what will happen to the economy here."
22993,"It's a shitty situation for everyone, not just Russians but everybody on this planet - you'd think people would be less divisive over something that unilaterally effects us all... but here we are."
22994,"&gt;No, it will not, because all the measures taken to prevent Covid also prevent the normal flu."
22995,It's not working so well in the US
22996,"But Europe got it from China is the point .,, it all leads back to them ."
22997,"If you ignore the facts, you can 'turn' it back to normal right now like most people do."
22998,"But if you take the facts into your equation, you know that it will not be back to normal for the next couple of decades."
22999,This is misleading at best.
23000,"If you have the anitbodies you are unlikely to ""get"" it at all, and if you do you won't suffer any effects from it, won't have it for very long at all, and period of contagiousness will be extremely small."
23001,people in europe are not wearing masks
23002,North Dakota had 11 deaths reported today.
23003,"Doesn't seem like much, right?"
23004,Well like 32 people live there per county.
23005,"Adjusted for Florida numbers, it would be over 300 deaths in one day."
23006,No?
23007,Sweden is in a better current situation than Romania or Hungary.
23008,"Sweden: 68.8 cases per 100k

Romania: 142.4 cases per 100k

Hungary: 134 cases per 100k

Switzerland, Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia and Moldova don't have data on that page, so I'm not sure how they're doing."
23009,"There are several countries doing better, however, yes."
23010,"But I wouldn't say it's ""quite high"" yet compared to much of the continent."
23011,"Yeah, no way US hits 400k this year."

23040,It’s tough to answer that question in a meaningful way because every zoo and aquarium are different.
23041,See the California guidance [here](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/).
23042,"There is a category for Museums, zoos, and aquariums."
23043,They are allowed to continue outdoor operations with no strictly defined reduced limit on capacity no matter how bad the cases are.
23044,"They can resume indoor operations at 25% capacity in the red tier, the next less restrictive tier."
23045,I also don’t think that particular question matters if you set a reduction of the park capacity in the guidelines.
23046,I believe what had been proposed was parks being allowed to open at 25% capacity (in the yellow tier).
23047,"In most parks, that is ample space, additionally at parks in Southern California where people may not go for more than a few hours at a time (make no mistake that people would probably go longer if they had to make reservations and such)."
23048,I think they should start with whatever capacity is being allowed at the food events and work from there.
23049,"No, it's still in the phase 3 trial so sub &lt;40k people would have it."
23050,They aren't lying more than country like Germany or France

23055,"However, this one...

&gt; They can still pull it off, it's wildly out of control in far too many American states in comparison, though."
23056,"What is your definition of ""wildly out of control""?"
23057,I hear this a lot on social media and i can't seem to find data to agree with it.
23058,The worst states in the USA over the last 7 days (according to CDC):  Texas has a 0.097% infection rate.
23059,California has 0.051% infection rate.
23060,The US in totality: 0.095%.
23061,Less than 1/10 of 1%.
23062,"That doesn't seem to be ""wildly out of control"" to me."
23063,That's great.
23064,The spread of the virus will slow the more people have antibodies in them.
23065,That's a pretty big over generalization.
23066,"Yes, the odds of hospitalization or death are obviously much higher for the high NMI group, but that absolutely does not mean that everyone will have the same reaction."
23067,"My BMI is probably over 30 (I'm trying to do better, but God do I love food) and my only COVID symptom was a loss of smell and taste for about a week."
23068,"What are my chances of leaving my house and being in a car accident today vs my odds of leaving my house and contracting covid (despite wearing masks, etc), having an especially bad reaction to it (unlike the recovery with mild lingering symptoms most other 20s/30s I know and have seen in media experience) and then dying from the disease (which is statistically a 1 in 5000 chance)."
23069,"Both are long shots, but I’d go with the car accident if I was placing bets."
23070,"The obvious solution is to close bars, anyone who says they absolutely require a bar to have fun and socialize is either severely misguided or an alcoholic."

23447,I really hope schools end up being as safe as they seem to be.
23448,The truth is it’s still a little early to tell in most cases.
23449,"Most didn’t seem to open until after Labor Day (or right before), so we are about 6 weeks out."
23450,"The data looks quite hopeful, and if things are still good in another 3-4 weeks I will be pretty happy."
23451,"The reality though, is that it takes a few cycles of disease to see if relaxation of regulations is going to make a difference."
23452,"Also, we can likely assume that as the first term or quarter comes to an end and schools add many more in person students and as a result also have more Troy me enforcing mask and distancing rules in the coming month or so that we will see an upswing of spread in schools."

Excerpt: 

&gt; As the COVID-19 crisis continues, the Broadway League has announced a further delay to the reopening of shows on the New York stage."
23485,"***All Broadway productions will now stay on hold—and will offer refunds and exchanges—through May 30, 2021."
23486,*** Dates for each returning and new Broadway show will be announced as individual productions determine the performance schedules for their respective shows.
23487,"&gt; **“With nearly 97,000 workers who rely on Broadway for their livelihood and an annual economic impact of $14.8 billion to the city, our membership is committed to re-opening as soon as conditions permit us to do so."
23488,"** We are working tirelessly with multiple partners on sustaining the industry once we raise our curtains again,” said Charlotte St. Martin, President of the Broadway League."
23489,"&gt; Shows were initially set to be shut down through April 12, then through June 7, then through September 6 and then through January 3, 2021."
23490,That's a lot of moving the goal posts.
23491,"Also, with nearly 100,000 workers impacted, and dates continuously being pushed back for reopening, **I wonder if Broadway won't regret this later** as some workers decide to change careers so that they can remain housed and fed."
23492,It will certainly impact the entire workforce of NYC if people are more poor and more out of work.

23636,Pretty much every store I go into says masks are required but the only store I've seen enforce it is Walmart.
23637,Everywhere else doesn't seem to care much or just has someone at the door telling people they are required and people just take them off once they are in the store and no employee will say anything.

23718,"Basically encouraging people to gather in the streets in the 100,00s."
23719,Its these kinds of mixed messages we have been getting since March.
23720,"We were told in march we would lockdown for 2 weeks to ""slow the spread"" and 2 million would die."
23721,7 months later and some people still want to lockdown to stop the spread.
23722,"Everything changes all the time, it makes no sense."
23723,"Most Americans value free will, but i promise you we would take this virus very serious if it warranted that."
23724,"Now that most people see it was blown way out of proportion it is hard to get us to stay in our homes, do you blame us?"
23725,"They want us to stay in our homes and go broke because ""in 2 weeks its gonna get really bad"" We have been hearing that since march and its yet to get Very bad."
23726,Rip to the 200k who died but im sorry i cant go broke staying inside.
23727,Many Americans lost their business and livlihood.
23728,"There are no easy answers but its clear as day we need to live w the virus and be safe, not lockdown in our homes in fear while we go broke."
23729,I guess winter is coming early.
23730,I guess I should go by a 12 pack of toilet paper before shit hits the fan again lol
23731,Kids and teachers need to sacrifice their lives at the altar of the rotten yam

23740,It’s simple wear the damn mask!
23741,I knew I should've finished the thought as there would be the dim ones who couldn't extrapolate for themselves.
23742,What would they do?
23743,Declare war?
23744,Send China back to its room?
23745,Stop buying cheap shit and mess up the weak economy?
23746,Anger China and probably make the Chinese stop buying that counties millions of dollars of exported food?
23747,Politicians are angry but it’s at the point that if you punish China they can just punish you back.
23748,I dont understand why restrictions is the only way to go?
23749,If youre doctor tells you to not socialize because you are contagious you wouldnt do that.
23750,So why do people think that the citizens wont listen to their public health experts.
23751,The Swedish Public Health agency gave recomendations and people followed it because they trust them and their expertise.
23752,Its no different than trusting youre personal doctor to me.
23753,&gt; This is false.
23754,The comorbidities listed on their death certificates were a direct result of being infected of covid19.
23755,Stop fucking lying.
23756,What did they lie about?
23757,Most people dying of Covid had comorbidities and/or were old.
23758,That is a fact.
23759,"The only iffy part of the statement was about not expecting to survive long anyways, and even then... given how many of the deaths happened in nursing homes, its still not a lie."
23760,"My office had 1 positive case discovered on Tuesday, and the next day we were all asked to get tested, and as of today there are 6 cases total."
23761,We have around 50 people total.
23762,Our office is still up and running and only those with positive covid or the sales department (bc they had closest contact with the first case) are given the option to work from home.
23763,"This is despite the fact that during the Shelter in Place period in IL, all office employees were given the option to work from home."
23764,We are also required to come in while waiting for test results unless we have a fever.
23765,I worry we have a bunch of incubating cases.
23766,"Until now, some people were very lax about mask wearing, and we were still having in person meetings in closed rooms where it has been very hard to maintain distance."
23767,A lot of the employees are smokers over 50.
23768,I myself have asthma.
23769,What do I do?
23770,Beware of *oats*.
23771,Where?
23772,Andy Cuomo welcomed the virus with open arms.
23773,Yes I understand the fact that the US has never really come down from the first wave.
23774,"Whatever  you want to call it, were at the beginning of another surge in new cases as Fall/Winter approach"
23775,4% of the population and 25% of the cases.
23776,Countries with less resources and money are handling this better than we are.
23777,Again no one gives a fuck about what other countries are doing.
23778,The US flat out just isn't doing enough to address this pandemic and that is 100% due to unwillingness to do so.

23794,"Well, this time the amount skyrocketed in the last week after being steady for a couple months, so this time you can at least justify the use of ""smashed"" as it was not expected just 1-2 weeks ago"
23795,So now you’re pro-facism tactics?
23796,Lol the mental gymnastics people will go through to justify having the government placate their anxieties with these “measures”
23797,I'm not talking about Germany.
23798,"I'm talking about places like Czech Republic, Netherlands, UK, France, and Argentina, all of which had case counts that when adjusted for population are higher than any single day in the U.S."
23799,This post got old fast...
23800,"No, they aren't."
23801,"Considering that Russians are already quite wary of vaccination as is, that would cause overwhelming outrage."

23815,Technically the restrictions are extending the pandemic to save lives.
23816,"If everything opened up, this thing would tear through the population very quickly."
23817,The death toll going that route isn't worth it though.
23818,"As someone who lives in China, I’m more concerned about Japanese visitors since China at least had had the virus under control for a number of months now, but Japan still had community infections"

23823,"So all in all, America is by far the worst combination of fat and dumb."
23824,I'm all in favor of wearing masks in public.
23825,Every time I'm in a public place I'm happy to wear one.
23826,"My point is that we shouldn't be shaming people for doing normal things, like going to family outings, the gym, movies, etc."
23827,"In your opinion, If they are doing those things, they dont love their neighbor?"
23828,"With the cold, its going to get bad again"
23829,"You're correct, it's really only as a secondary option to amphetamine."
23830,"In my comment I used amphetamine as a class, and was including methamphetamine under it."
23831,Sorry for the confusion!
23832,No shame in getting shitfaced at home.
23833,"No worries about finding your way home, if you're already there!"
23834,That’s a weird way to phrase things
23835,Trump only likes people who DON'T get the virus.
23836,...oh wait.
23837,I really just hope they reopen someday... My daughter just hit the height requirement for most of the big rides and my anxiety that this could be the end if it goes on too long is very real.
23838,Or that even if they do reopen tickets prices will have to skyrocket to compensate.
23839,Yeah.
23840,My objective is to get the numbers back to low.
23841,Reduce community spreading and so forth.
23842,The US has 4% of the world's population and 25% of the cases.

23852,There is actually a bunch of evidence to support AZ's improvements.
23853,This was noted in a long article written by an NYC first-responder supervisor.

23858,Most of the deaths were cardiac arrests.
23859,There are plenty of recent articles that heavily favor the use of masks.
23860,"You have to approach this epidemiologically and clinically, not will hypothesis-generating articles about particle size or dispersion physics."

23868,I think you missed the point.
23869,I was basically providing another possible explanation why China was able to suppress the virus.
23870,It was due to their CITIZEN’S COOPERATION.
23871,"Regardless what you think, China suppressed the virus."
23872,"Doesn’t matter what you think of it or you say about it, it doesn’t change the fact."
23873,"I’m not glorifying their way of doing things, but heck I’m glorifying their outcome."

23898,Not the nations who have already made vaccine deals.
23899,Should we continue with measures post vaccine?
23900,"Sure, maybe for a couple months (if people even bother with that)."
23901,When did we roll back the silly TSA rules after 9/11?
23902,Being an American living full time in Canada during this pandemic has certainly opened my eyes to a lot of things I believed without question while living in America and not experiencing anywhere else.
23903,"It is just a night and day, black and white difference and how these two countries and its leaderships have conducted themselves."
23904,I cannot imagine giving up my single life to protect a person that is completely unconcerned with protecting any human life.

23976,"We were told that there would be no going back to ""pre-Covid"" life."
23977,It was pretty clearly communicated to everybody from the beginning.
23978,"i guess ""gravely ill"" sounds better than hospitalized and on his death bed."
23979,Well you wouldn't know that because there was almost assuredly no hospitalizations.
23980,It would have been mentioned.
23981,In other words both schools had the same end result.
23982,"Jesus christ no one is prolonging the pandemic, it’s not going away until there’s a vaccine, I thought that would be obvious to people by now."
23983,The vast majority of people who get infected are normal people trying to get by and live their lives.

24078,"&gt; ""Earlier this week, the FDA released more guidance on vaccine development."""
24079,"This is the problem, they have not been clear on their guidance."
24080,"After companies are well down the road developing, testing and ramping up production FDA suddenly decided to add ""guidance"" at the last minute."
24081,"Worse, they provided no science-based justification for their new guidance."
24082,They simply decided they wanted 2 more months of data than they previously said they needed in the August guidelines.

24135,I cut it down to a bit over 3000IUs.
24136,The blood test came in (in-network) a little under $30.
24137,Insurance paid it as part of the annual physical exam.
24138,"I found once I cleared a Vit D deficiency, some auto-immunes started straightening out."
24139,There's a lot more at stake with keeping D on an even keel than just Covid-19.
24140,"I've always thought that, with a system that focuses on a pound of cure (that enhances shareholder profits) that D is the ounce of prevention."
24141,"TL;DR:

&gt;Although today’s Excel spreadsheets can handle 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns, developers at PHE used an older Excel file format (XLS instead of XLSX) resulting in each template being able to store only around 65,000 rows of data (or around 1,400 cases)."
24142,"When the limit was reached, any further cases were left off the template and therefore positive cases of coronavirus were missed in the daily reporting."
24143,"So, MarketWatch isn’t trustworthy?"
24144,"Let’s contextualise France experiencing “a larger outbreak than the US has ever experienced.”

It’s latest new daily cases are 18,746."
24145,"The US peaked at 75,682 in July and remain around 50,000 per day."
24146,"Adjusting for population, France’s current max is *just* higher than the U.S.’s max (27.9 cases / 100000 vs. 23.7)."
24147,"Moreover, France eased its restrictions in June when the government ended the state of emergency when daily new cases had fallen to the low hundreds (a rate the US has never gotten near by orders of magnitude)."
24148,"That was obviously a mistake, and so new restrictions and mandates have steadily come back into effect from July."
24149,"However It’ll help curb the spread of another disease that would take up even more resources and would increase hospitalizations of immunosuppressed people this putting even more stress on hospitals than they’re already getting, so, still get your flu shot"
24150,The concern then was that panic buying masks would lead to a shortage for healthcare workers who were much more at risk (as he asserts in his final statements).
24151,It does look bad although new research about the efficacy of masks has come out since then and now fauci is emphatically telling people to wear masks.
24152,"Science continually grows and evolves, and so does our understand of complex subjects!"
24153,I’m pro mask just to make that clear first.
24154,But Florida Covid cases have also drop 75% or so with out any mask stuff and not really closing anything
24155,I was horrified when you guys first started allowing casinos to open up as I live in Las Vegas and have been in the industry for many years.
24156,"Then we opened up shortly after and it was amazing to see how the rules have become so relaxed to the point where I wonder how the hell we actually haven't beaten covid yet, b/c it sure as hell seems like everyone gambling out here thinks we did."
24157,I wish they would come out and say more clearly whether it makes a difference if you have muscle or whether its just absolute BMI that translates into COVID risk.
24158,"I'm about 26/27 on the BMI scale but go to CrossFit 4x/week (now outdoors with a mask on in California and in socially distanced squares) plus long walks at least another 1-2 days, and I cook most of my own meals."
24159,I was only able to get and stay below 25 BMI when I didn't do any regular lifting and only did cardio.
24160,At worst 2% of Americans will die.
24161,7 million lives in worth me drinking my cosmo at the restaurant.

24165,"Ah so we're okay with ignoring those murdered, got it."
24166,"I get the hypocrisy, but it still is bending the truth of the matter to make it more likeable for a certain audience."
24167,I don't support bending of any truths.
24168,"Call it as it is, not what you want it to be"
24169,"&gt;Pretty sure the Dems are going to have every inquiry going into dealings in the Trump administration if they gain control of both the House and Senate

There is no chance whatsoever of this happening."
24170,"If Dems win, they will want to take ""the high road"" and move on from Trump rather than keeping the focus on him."
24171,They think it's not good politics for them to investigate a previous president.
24172,It's the same reason they never went after George W. administration officials for war crimes.
24173,"It took all of 8 minutes for someone to respond to your comment noting the need to ""heal and move on."""
24174,That's how most of the country feels.
24175,Anyone expecting justice to be served is in for severe disappointment.
24176,"If Biden wins, there will not be a single Congressional hearing about Trump in the next four years."
24177,By the general consensus in this thread and the fact that it's MarketWatch and not some other news outlet
24178,"Yes, and they will keep adding to the death toll though it seems to have slowed down a bit from the peak in July."
24179,And Peru doesn't have that many old people.

24311,"My core issue with masks is that if they depend on such a high level of compliance for a long period of time that is clearly not achieved in many populations, then you should re-evaluate the strategy you are using instead of blaming people for being stupid, and telling them they should be more like Eastern countries."

24371,Theyre only doing this now?!
24372,To little to late if they were really serious about contact tracing.
24373,There's no way they could tease out a separate effect of masks from the data they had.
24374,[Figure 7 from the research report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/figures/mm6940e3-F.gif) gives it away.
24375,"If masks were a major factor, wouldn't you expect the decline in cases to be steeper than the rise?"

24389,"&gt;Basically, the only places in the world that have suppressed the virus have seen resurgences as soon as they stop the most severe measures."
24390,What severe measures?
24391,NZ has had one of the laxest measures since they reopened in May.
24392,"Even during their 'lockdown' in Aug, the only restrictions they had was group size limits of **100** (and 10 for Auckland)."
24393,They currently have no gathering restrictions.
24394,The same goes for most countries on the list.
24395,"&gt;Masks and social distancing are unfalsifiable beliefs: if cases go down, they worked, if they go up, we didn't do it hard enough."
24396,"Yeah, funny how that trend actually mirrors real life."
24397,&gt;Sweden has almost no mask wearing or social distancing rules.
24398,"You do realize they've limited the maximum number of diners to 50 and mandated that tables be sat at least 1m apart, right?"
24399,Or that those places are forced to closed if they violate those guidelines?
24400,What do you think those are if not social distancing rules?
24401,The same also goes for Swedish schools that are asked to ensure similar social distancing.
24402,&gt;They have limited public gatherings and encouraged work from home.
24403,"Again, you do realize that those are social distancing rules?"
24404,Having people to work from home is literally the most significant method in ensuring social distancing can be carried out on public transportation and in the workplace.

24530,"Yes, they are not going all the way to state a recommendation."
24531,But they are also not saying that wearing a mask is a bad thing.
24532,Or to use your fire analogy.
24533,"If there was a forest fire, the health agancy would probably not say that there is a recommendation for people to bring water to the fire."
24534,"Not because water isn't effective, but if 10.000 people are driving to the fire with 5-30 liters of water each, they will be in the way for the firefighters who tries to do their job."
24535,But at the same time they wouldn't recommend not to use water against a fire.
24536,"In this case, water is proven effective against fire, but a recomendation to the public to bring water to the fire is not proven effective, at least not yet."

24653,People have an attitude like the virus isn’t here...
24654,India: you got yourself competition.
24655,Does every word out of this mans mouth become a post on here?
24656,They are testing?
24657,I'm really surprised..
24658,"No, I'm just saying if it does work - then just immediately use it."
24659,"And yeah, should not just accept something without knowing how it works."
24660,'because they said so' - that's not sane.
24661,"No, vaccine just a bunch of materials all combined to make a 'vaccine' - now how that'd react with the body, should know whats going on, how it works, what it does - not just because 'they said so', that's not understanding."
24662,"Understanding everything, if it looks safe enough just based on what it does to the body, then should be ok."
24663,I'm agreeing that covid is bad but you don't need to exaggerate to make your point.
24664,You must give the other side more ammo.
24665,It doesn't leave permanent in a large proportion of cases.
24666,It definitely can in some but your statement is misleading.
24667,Some people around me are saying we're good because the governor's restrictions have been lifted.
24668,They say it'll be different after the election.
24669,Other people tell me about the latest infections and where the nearest hotspots are.
24670,Confusing.
24671,"Sorry for double responding but I read up more on stuff and then I reread your comment and found a few errors:

&gt;Sure, but the claim that the death count is 10-100x the flu deaths from the last several years combined depends heavily on the error here."
24672,The error in the estimate here that you’re talking about is a measure of all of the times that the flu actually contributed to someone’s death in *any way.
24673,"*  When a doctor has reason to blame a death as being due at least in part to Influenza, they write it down as such."
24674,This is also true of COVID-19.
24675,Comparing the verified death counts is a much much more valid comparison.
24676,The flu estimate isn’t merely to catch everyone who died while infected with the flu but didn’t get tested for it.
24677,It uses every bit of relevant data we can think of to adjust that actual death count upwards.
24678,"It tries to capture the full extent of the disease’s burden, every last bit of it."
24679,"It even considers deaths where, for example, the flu worsened someone’s pre-existing condition and then they got over the flu but later died of that pre-existing condition."
24680,It is a **fundamentally different measure than the raw death count**.
24681,"&gt;Also, no, the error cannot be 10 or 5 or even 2 times the official count, because there haven’t been enough deaths to cover that kind of error."
24682,I’m sorry but there are *way more than enough deaths* to cover that kind of error.
24683,"~55,000 people died on average each week in 2019, for a total death count that year of ~2.85M people."
24684,And that was before coronavirus.
24685,"So far this year we are averaging ~62,000 deaths per week, on pace to hit ~3.24M deaths by the end of the year if that average holds true."
24686,"We have counted 218,000 COVID-19 deaths so far this year, for an average of ~5300 deaths per week attributed to that disease."
24687,"Which means 62,000 / 5,300 = 11.69 is a roughly calculated limit on the maximum error factor that a COVID-19 estimate could have."
24688,"There is plenty of room for its estimated death count to be double, if not triple, the verified death count, or more."
24689,"&gt;We know how many people tend to die in a year, and we know how many people have died this year."
24690,There are not hundreds of thousands to millions of unaccounted for deaths.
24691,That simply is not the case.
24692,"No, of course there are not hundreds of thousands to millions unaccounted for deaths, but as this disease rages on it is undoubtedly leaving in its wake thousands if not tens or even hundreds of thousands of unaccounted for *causes* of death."
24693,Just because you test someone for COVID-19 who is dying and they come out negative does not mean that COVID-19 did not contribute to their death.
24694,"To get an idea if it did, much like we do with the flu, you need to take external data into account, like what DID they die from, what are the chances they ever contracted COVID, and what are the chances that it exacerbated any pre-existing condition or created a new preexisting condition that ultimately led to their demise down the road, long after their COVID infection subsided."
24695,**This is how the flu estimate is calculated and this is why comparing it to COVID’s verified death count is so misleading and faulty.
24696,"**

&gt;I think the most likely case is that the true death toll is somewhere between the official count and the total excess deaths, with something of a normal distribution centered in the middle of that range."
24697,"Again, you seem to be equating the “true death toll” with the estimated death toll, and that’s fine, but you need to understand that the “true death toll”/estimated death toll, if you do it the way it is done for Influenza, is much higher because it in includes people whose death was in *any way* secondary to COVID-19."
24698,"This includes people who have preexisting conditions which COVID made worse then went away but the condition it worsened later killed them, and of people whom COVID created new pre existing conditions which eventually went onto to contribute to their death, despite not having an active COVID infection at the time of death."
24699,It is an attempt to use the best information we have from whatever relevant sources we have to calculate a true burden of the *entire disease*.
24700,"&gt;I’d give the probability of the number being 10x the number of flu deaths in 2018-2019 year something like 1-5%, where the true flu deaths are actually lower than estimated and nearly all excess deaths are covid."
24701,Bruh.
24702,"That flu season we saw 14,510 verified deaths."
24703,"We have already seen 218,000 verified COVID-19 deaths in the last 10 months."
24704,That is already well over 10x the verified death count of influenza that year.
24705,"You really need to look into how the flu is estimated, and then consider how those same estimation techniques will likewise multiply a COVID-19 count, **despite the fact that we test much more for COVID-19 than we do Influenza."
24706,"** Primarily because COVID, just like the flu, exacerbates preexisting conditions."
24707,"It’s estimated/“true” death toll extends far past those it has been caught killing “red handed.”

You need to consider the fact that flattening the curve is about freeing up hospital beds and resources for an influx of severely sick patients."
24708,People are dying at a very very high rate from this virus compared to the flu.
24709,Do you remember us worrying about freeing up hospital beds for Influenza in 2018 or literally any other year in living memory?
24710,"Seriously, think about it."
24711,"For example, let’s say we see a spike in brain cancer, then we study COVID and find that it has a 15% chance of causing brain cancer 6 months after you contract the virus."
24712,"We can now reasonably guess that 15% of the total estimated COVID cases probably ultimately got that symptom 6 months later, and we can add them into the estimated death toll."
24713,"Similarly with pneumonia deaths, which actually *has* spiked since COVID was introduced."
24714,"If we study COVID and find that it causes pneumonia deaths, we can do some fancy math by figuring out the what percent of those pneumonia deaths were likely due to COVID, as well, despite never having tested positive for the disease."
24715,Same with heart disease and other internal organ diseases where we find scientifically derived statistical data about COVID causing health problems that can lead to death to help us adjust our estimate model of the **true** impact of COVID.
24716,If the goal is zero cases they need to lockdown ASAP and stay locked down until a vaccine it is that simple.
24717,No chance it happens.
24718,"Even with a vaccine, PPE, etc."

24759,as a grocery store worker i believe this is true.

24761,"grocery store could be a hotspot, depends on the precautions your store does and doesn’t take."
24762,"Because there’s “high risk” people that are projecting their thoughts and prayers, rather than following the facts and science."

24767,"You're absolutely right, but it's good to have any immunity whatsoever, even if it's only temporary."
24768,That's exactly what vaccine manufacturers are after.
24769,You should also keep in mind that the CDC has said the antibody tests aren’t accurate.
24770,They said that even the most accurate antibody tests might be wrong half the time.
24771,That alone could explain 20% testing positive.

24888,"*At a very low rate of actual positivity*, the test may come back with 50% false positive."
24889,Let me give you an example to illustrate.
24890,Let's say that the false positive rate is 1% (most antibody tests are actually lower).
24891,"In a city with an actual prevalence of 1%, you'd get 1% actually positive plus another 0.99% false positive (.99x.01) for a total positive rate of 1.99% (ignoring false negatives)."
24892,But now say you take the same test in a city with a 20% actual positivity rate.
24893,"You'd get 20% for the actual positives, and another 0.8% false positives (.8x.01)."
24894,"Your false positives are nearly the same in actual numbers (.8% vs .99%), but they make up a much smaller amount of your total positives, and therefore are much less significant."
24895,"The same is true in reverse for false negatives - at low prevalence, they're less important because they're a percentage of true positives, but at higher percentages play a larger role."
24896,"So again, with a roughly real life number (5%), we'd see 0.05% false negatives in the city with 1% actual positives and 1% false negatives in your city with 20%."

25054,Kid is doing ok with classes being remote so far.

25061,"If the number of people sick went from 1-3 in a week, that would be exponential."
25062,If it went from 1 to 100 that would be exponential.
25063,The word exponential literally means nothing unless you're giving some context i.e.
25064,what is the exponent?
25065,"China, New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam would all like to have a word."
25066,"As do countries like Italy, Spain and France which managed to crush a runaway pandemic the first time within 1-2 months (whereas in the US, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in the Americas, the pandemic kept going non-stop)."

25085,Yes but it’s the only way to get through this.
25086,We don’t want to risk getting sick and we don’t want to be part of the problem causing the spread.
25087,I’m tired and depressed when I go out and see selfish idiots acting like all is fine and that they can’t follow measures in place for all our protection.
25088,If they actually grew up and acted like adults should we could get a grip like New Zealand but no people have to go to a bar or a restaurant and continue helping this virus spread.

25115,We’ve now fucked up an entire generation of kids alongside the economy.
25116,"They have to pick the most dramatic words to use to illustrate their point- ""SMASHES 24 hour record"" or ""so and so SLAMS so and so"""
25117,What does flu season have to do with it?
25118,I hope you people don't want lockdowns every flu season from now on.
25119,Yeah sometimes I wonder if these people now on Reddit make it their life goal to be empty skull  trolls on the internet.
25120,They think their comments are witty or funny but their so cringeworthy.
25121,When they show up on post worthy of discussion it just makes you lose even more hope for humanity.
25122,How come the world is full of so many idiots?
25123,"Yes, but the dead ones had contact with live ones, most likely."
25124,"Testing after death has value, especially as far as a community is concerned."
25125,"Half a town dies of Covid (gross exaggeration), but they are not counted... ""nothing to see here, folks"" makes no sense."
25126,Shut up inbred pasty white fuck.
25127,At this point until there's a vaccine that's widely available and without obvious short term side effects I don't see how the state of things changes.
25128,So no shit BWay will not be open until at least May.
25129,Also as others have said the operating margins on these shows are awful and unless they are packing these cramped 100 year old theaters they cannot afford to keep shows open anyway.
25130,So regardless of government regulations...unless you're finding several thousand people per performance who want to pay $100-500 per seat to sit elbow to elbow with strangers for 3 hours they're can't afford to open.
25131,And a local government that is not helping.

25133,Guess that vaccine worked wonders!
25134,Tipping and crying about masks is probably the most American thing you can do short of shooting the place up
25135,Russia is usually called an Eastern European country.
25136,"The majority of Russia's population lives in the European part of the country (West of the Ural mountains), that's the geographical aspect."
25137,"Also the culture, not much in common with China, India or Middle-East."
25138,"So all the lavish praise for them were premature, just like the harsh criticisms against the sunbelt were?"
25139,"my dad went to russia over the summer (i was not happy with him, but he came back and tested negative and is fine so whatever i guess) and no one wore masks and it seemed like they didn't care at all there."

25159,That study was so bad people were poking gaping holes in it the day it was published.
25160,It just gets cited a lot because it happens to reinforce a narrative that a lot of people like - that losing weight is counterproductive.
25161,I believe you that this is difficult.
25162,"Believe me, I know the feeling, been trying to lose weight since the start of lockdown and I'm *up* four pounds."

25179,RIP to jobs and economy.
25180,My one silver lining currently is the belief that flu season *shouldn't* be as bad this year because we've never worn masks or social distanced before during it.
25181,"That being said, those that get both [flu and covid] will probably have a bad time."
25182,Dont worry Czech here and its the same.
25183,"Even worse, the people blame government (the same people who called for lowering restrictions because the situation was good), refuse masks now or say its just flu."

25331,They had those diseases and conditions for years.
25332,Stop fucking lying.
25333,There is absolutely no scientific way to know if those people would have lived if not for covid19.
25334,How could anyone claim such a ridiculous thing?

25348,The hyperbole being?
25349,Because that's factual.
25350,Why not just get your influenza vaccine?
25351,I can imagine that they handle the situation a lot better than other countries.
25352,But zero cases?
25353,"Even during the 2-3 months long lockdown, the lowest cases we‘ve had here was like 3 cases a day and my country has significantly less people and a much lower density."

25356,No I’m not.
25357,Just a casual observer.
25358,So your saying more people than we think are wearing masks right?
25359,I believe that.
25360,And I believe it is helping.
25361,It the same thing wear I live ND.
25362,There is no mask mandate here either and social media and the national news make it would like nobody is using them here.

25409,"There is a significant number of deaths that are occuring because of things like preventative care being delayed (think annual/routine visits), as well as people be slower about going to the hospital when they have symptoms that should require it (think stroke / heart attack where every second counts), and in between that not seeing a doctor for something that should be seen immediately as well (like your symptoms don't demand an ER, but if you saw a doctor they could diagnose and start treatment for something that might be terminal if that treatment is delayed)."

25454,This band had a small club tour in the US in February after a 20-year hiatus and I tried to get tickets for the NYC shows and fly over from Europe but no chance to get tickets.
25455,So I'll settle for the next best thing.
25456,While most bands and promoters will switch back to live shows as soon as it's possible I'd like for streaming to stay around as well.

25510,No local cases doesn't mean there aren't pockets of undetected cases.
25511,There most likely is.
25512,It just hasn't caught attention of authorities yet because the cases are isolated to that pocket.
25513,"There are cases of all kinds of diseases that are in existence, but isolated, and waiting for a super spreader."
25514,"Once a super spreader comes along, that is when authorities notice and then take action."
25515,"They aggressively shut down, then do extensive contact tracing, and isolation."
25516,"In China, there are likely many pockets of infections but no superspreader, so they remain isolated, and mostly harmless to general populace."

25556,I'd rather not see friends with chronic medical issues die young from a new virus.
25557,That’s like a positivity rate of 1-2% overall.
25558,Testing should be increased if there are regions testing much higher than 5%.

25560,We have 83 days remaining until the end of the year.
25561,"Sept 23rd was the last day we recorded more than 1,000 deaths and the last two weeks the deaths are trending down - slightly."
25562,Although cases are trending up recently they aren’t at levels that will push the death toll significantly in the next 2-4 weeks.
25563,"IMO I think the real risk is post Christmas Jan - February, and if we can keep the virus out of the retirement / convalescent homes this winter."
25564,I am not saying the barriers are perfect but they will undoubtedly reduce the exposure to the particles.
25565,"Factor in the distance, and it was pretty safe"
25566,I'm currently 32.5 after losing 25 pounds since March.
25567,"I got a positive test in late July after a test I had to take for work (PCR) and was positive with ZERO symptoms before, during, or since."
25568,Never planned on getting tested except for work.
25569,"Congrats OP, giving me hope."
25570,Human trash.
25571,They do have the luxury of having a better population density for this sort of thing and they could have prevented more deaths in nursery homes.
25572,"That said, boy do I want to live in Sweden right now."
25573,"Phone a doctor or health service today, or this week."
25574,Don't wait till next week.
25575,You might be spreading it actively without knowing it.
25576,more cases than some countries...
25577,I dont understand what that means
25578,Why close?
25579,"Open, get rid of the anti masks people and then everything will be easier"
25580,What a shithead.
25581,Haha ”mass homicide” either you are trolling or you are about as well informed as a bag of rocks.
25582,Seems like the masks are working huh?
25583,"Well, duh."
25584,Can confirm.
25585,Two weeks ago 1 out of 5 in the supermarket where I shop wore a mask (lots of elderly and quite a few expats live in that neighbourhood).
25586,Yesterday shopping 3 out of 4 wore masks.
25587,We can’t enforce “obey or be killed”.
25588,"Yes, get tested and self-isolate."
25589,"So, as your neighbors from the south?"
25590,The peeps in charge here really want to do damge control for a certain group of people responsible for this mess.
25591,Chinese people know how to protect themselves and aren't ignorant.
25592,Simple as that.
25593,People are out because they feel geniue safe
25594,I dont like countries that commit mass homocide

25597,"Per capita Florida still has more cases 3380/100,000 vs California 2145/100,000."
25598,The seven day case count in Florida is also higher.
25599,"yeah I just have what my campus provided, which is cloth, but if I could find surgical ones I'd def prefer them"
25600,"But in this case, we have the most per capita, too."
25601,"But that's true for a lot of things too, since we're pretty rich."
25602,This is false.
25603,"Cases dropped because most of the state already got the virus and since most people are asymptomatic, and those who got it don't get it again, cases obviously drop."
25604,"But yeah, cotton masks and polyester gators are the savior."
25605,"You are in every thread screaming and raving about sweden, who the fuck hurt you?"
25606,People just got tired of restrictions.
25607,For how long can you be fully mobilized?
25608,"If it becomes a dire situation again, then I guess people will take it seriously again."
25609,Well the Catholic church literally banned priests from having wives because they were afraid of their influence.
25610,A good salesman will use every angle they can.
25611,But my freedom!!
25612,/s
25613,In my country they (the government) keep pointing to the fact that most infections are at home.
25614,If 25 get infected in a class they will spread it to 75 in homes at least.
25615,I do not know if they intent to misinform us that way to hide the fact that children are spreaders.
25616,"Yes in the country the Netherlands the government says masks spread this disease, children do not."
25617,If i was an octopus i would facepalm with all 8 arms.
25618,"I've had tons of blood tests and the like to make sure it didn't effect heart, kidneys, liver etc."
25619,He was happy with the results.
25620,Pretty much just trying to fix the lungs now.
25621,Vaccine seems to be working.
25622,"I live in Strasbourg was tested negative two weeks ago,no waiting to be tested,no extra wait to get the result."
25623,"This week my son needed urine and stool sample for analysis,lot of people waiting,extra time for results."
25624,"Weather is very humid,not really cold for now."
25625,So i hope nobody will get seriously sick at home during fall and winter.
25626,It will be hard top have good care even for non lethal disease.
25627,Stay safe!
25628,...and just kill kill kill.

25635,Distraction.
25636,"It's a magic word, say it and repubs go insane."
25637,It’s weird that your takeaway is the exact opposite of what is fact.
25638,Seems more likely that parts of the military would get it first and health care workers second.
25639,Our service men and women get all sorts of questionable shots.
25640,"If medical workers were first and something went wrong, then we are out tons of medical workers in the middle of a pandemic."
25641,"For clarity, I value everyone's lives and am not saying this is the right course of action, just a likely course and what I am hearing from a relative involved with vaccines in Texas."
25642,but....  they have controlled the spread of the virus very effectively.
25643,Enforced lockdowns and nearly 100% compliance with mask laws combined with some Orwellian privacy laws and contact tracing does do the trick.
25644,"And much more testing, so more asymptomatic/mild cases being discovered."

25647,"Dr Madick, where can I buy some trexamethadrone like Trump used to cure the hoax-vid?"

25649,did the doctor tell you something regarding it?
25650,Bro I’m just saying I trust CDC guidelines because you complained they’re not trustworthy with their stories keep changing lol.
25651,I didn’t even say anything about the White House or their administration and science staff.
25652,He's a private citizen.
25653,Best wishes for his recovery.
25654,but trump said he won it...
25655,I just watched a clip of him talking on fox and he coughed 4 times in one sentence.
25656,The world’s consensus and standard of care is to wear a mask.
25657,"Those guidelines are based on the best available science, and made by world experts."
25658,You don’t get to come and normalize fringe ideas and act like there is some huge debate happening in the medical community.
25659,It is settled.
25660,Pack your bags and take your shit thoughts elsewhere.
25661,"Hope the Swedes are happy with becoming a country of cripples :D.

And their useless population still atent doing anything."
25662,Un-fucking-belivable.
25663,"The point is, if a vaccine is 70% effective, you need to vaccinate almost everyone."
25664,Herd immunity is only achievable through vaccination.
25665,That's The point.
25666,"Once vaccines are rolling out, you have to wait until we hit the threshold to have herd immunity."
25667,"Not just go ""hey i got the shot it's over"" because *you* may not be immune from the shot."
25668,What's so confusing about this concept to you?
25669,Do you people really think we'll vaccinate the entire fucking country in a day?
25670,Look around you ffs.
25671,Lockdowns and restrictions are failing or quickly becoming unsustainable all over the world.
25672,"There are a handful of countries in Asia that have done well, but none of them faced the situation we do now."

25675,"Yes, it’s possible that people’s family members will die, but it should be obvious that this is a risk people will gladly take to have some normality and basic humanity in their lives."
25676,"Most people are mature enough to realise that we are not god, tragedies happen, sometimes we can’t just make the big bad go away, and robbing everyone of a year of their lives and many years of economic depression isn’t worth it for a disease whose average age of victim is above the average life expectancy."

25678,"You should get used to hearing the voice of ordinary people, because it’s about to get much louder."

25687,Uhg...I think I killed my best friend by giving him covid.
25688,No way to know for sure...it still haunts me.
25689,Do Nothing Noem?
25690,Yeah.
25691,She's... she's a peach.
25692,More american fudging on covid data eh?
25693,Who's the China now eh bitches?
25694,Hypocritical bastards...
25695,Blood clots and issues with coagulation during a covid-19 infection are elevated above the average but are not present in all patients.
25696,Iirc from the Harvard studies I read on the subject the percentage was around 30%.
25697,"So, no."
25698,Also the connection is not yet studied properly and there are still a lot of unknowns.
25699,"&amp;#x200B;

Those unknowns are precisely why people should be more careful because we do not posses enough information about this infection yet and also, the amount of hosts it has and will continue to have is a breeding ground for potential mutations that may or may not cause a lot more issues but also completely bypass any natural immunity that we develop from a previous strain of the virus."
25700,We don't even know if such an immunity can be built up or how long it lasts for because our immune system is not an SSD that can potentially store a memory forever.
25701,It's quite dum-dum actually for most viruses.
25702,There's nothing special about China.
25703,Every East Asian nation is doing well considering the circumstances.
25704,Don't praise China specifically; praise East Asian cultures in general.
25705,It's not even that anymore.
25706,People around these parts don't give a flying fuck about masks.
25707,I think you misunderstood that I was angrily agreeing with the comment I replied to.
25708,"No, it could not."
25709,"Read the article, it's not kust the magic of the masks, it's also the closures of many businesses."
25710,I find it very likely that that's what has the actual effect.
25711,Let’s first see the study results.
25712,Found the Mormon
25713,&gt;32 states and the District of Columbia mandate face-covering in public.
25714,Thirty-three states currently require people to wear face coverings in public to curb the spread of COVID-19.
25715,The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico also have mask orders in place.
25716,"The Department of Health, other state commissioners and the governer can make lawful orders and enforce mandates to protect the citizens that live within their state."
25717,It is normal to have laws in place during state of emergencies.
25718,The entire country is experiencing a pandemic and the citizens are too stupid to do one of the only things they can do to help.
25719,"Yes, masks should be mandatory and in some states it is declared a law."
25720,First time on Reddit?
25721,"I wish I could start replacing stupid, aggressive, selfish, narcissistic, fatass Americans with law abiding Japanese who put introversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, and agreeableness on a pedestal."

25733,Thats mean.
25734,The Norwegians are doing the best they can.
25735,See America is still on top baby
25736,If CDC says 6 feet better make it 10.
25737,This whole problem has revealed a sort of... racist science worship?
25738,Let me explain.
25739,Apparently nothing in this world is real or true until it has been confirmed and peer reviewed by a plurality of Ivy League educated doctors in AngloEuropean research institutions.
25740,Nothing.
25741,"Even if sharing this knowledge will save hundreds of thousands of lives, nothing is ever true until it has been proven to have already happened."
25742,"So CDC ignored all the preventative and cautionary information given to them by China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan - all these countries that had covid before us and dealt with it really well."
25743,Why?
25744,"I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I think people are just extremely racist."
25745,They think the yellow people lie.
25746,It’s weird.
25747,Even the intelligent people who believe in science appear to do so with the same blind faith of true believers.
25748,That’s not good.
25749,Science is about skepticism.
25750,"The assumption should have been that virus is bad, not neutral until proven bad."
25751,"Nobody should have been saying “there isn’t any evidence it harms children” because that’s harm maximization, not harm reduction."
25752,Interesting how a simple word order shows the absurd agenda of the mask lobby.
25753,"They actually see drop off thanks to closures, but no, the author had to put masks first for some reason."
25754,This is getting ridiculous.
25755,"Yeah, it's absolutely pathetic that people always assume the absolute WORST about ANYTHING you write."
25756,And sickening.
25757,"As someone that likes to employ sarcasm often, I don't even give a shit anymore about clarifying."
25758,Cheetah snacks and dusty tortilla chips?
25759,What's up with that?
25760,"True, some small number of deaths are unavoidable."
25761,"However the wide and rapid spread in the US didn’t have to happen, and he should have never been exposed."
25762,"It was always going to be a pandemic, it’s just the scale that means most of the deaths were avoidable."
25763,"&gt;up to $15,000 a day for mass gatherings"
25764,"Briefings are on Tuesday and Thursday, updates are currently between Tuesday and Friday."
25765,"Notes from today and earlier in the week:

* 26 patients are in ICU with COVID-19."
25766,This is one more than yesterday.
25767,"* The two new reported deaths are from 3/10 and 5/10, 1 in the age group of 80-89 and one 90+, from Dalarna and Värmland."
25768,"* Of the new cases 24% are 20-29, 19% are 30-39 and 17% are 40-49."
25769,In the elderly age groups the infected are about 2.5% in the 70-79 and 2.5% for 80+.
25770,* Earlier today there was a press conference with the Minister of Higher Education and Research and the director of FHM.
25771,It was about the increased cases among students and in student towns.
25772,"&gt;Recently, several corona outbreaks have been reported at universities around the country."
25773,"At Mälardalen University in Västerås and Linköping University, among others, a number of students have been confirmed infected."
25774,"In both cases, parties are pointed out as the source of the outbreaks."
25775,"&gt;  
&gt;\- During the autumn, universities and colleges have been able to start opening up for campus teaching again."
25776,We have done this for the sake of the students.
25777,"&gt;  
&gt;\- Unfortunately, it seems that this cautious opening has been interpreted by too many students that it is free to return to a more normal student life."
25778,"&gt;  
&gt;\- We see examples of big orientation and student parties where drunk students gather far too many, and far too close, says Ernkrans."
25779,"&gt;  
&gt;\- You have a great responsibility to reduce the spread of infection, and it is a responsibility that I expect you to take, says Ernkrans, and hands over to the Swedish Public Health Agency's Johan Carlson."
25780,"&gt;  
&gt;\- As many as eight regions report outbreaks that are linked to colleges or universities, he says."
25781,"&gt;  
&gt;Carlson believes that the spread of infection has not taken place in connection with studies, but occurs at private parties, student parties and kicks."
25782,"&gt;  
&gt;\- So far, 200 students have been infected this autumn, and there is a very high risk that there will be more, he says."
25783,"&gt;  
&gt;Simon Edström, chairman of Sweden's United Student Unions, will also attend the press conference."
25784,"&gt;  
&gt;\- We have asked all student unions and nations."
25785,"Our view is that all of these have taken measures to reduce the spread of infection, he says."
25786,"&gt;  
&gt;Edström does not want events to be canceled, but instead to be carried out in a safer way:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- It is better to have corona-secured events to reduce the risk of unorganized events such as corridor parties."
25787,"&gt;  
&gt;He also says that the student movement condemns all social events that do not follow the Swedish Public Health Agency's recommendations."
25788,"&gt;  
&gt;Ernkrans is now asked if it can be the case that the campus may close down."
25789,"&gt;  
&gt;\- Already today, a local infection control doctor together with a university management can close universities and colleges if the spread of infection becomes too extensive, she says."
25790,* There is a bit of a chance in the page where the total tests performed are reported - [https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/antalet-testade-for-covid-19/](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/antalet-testade-for-covid-19/) since week 40 (last week).
25791,The new statistics now show both the tests performed and unique individuals tested ( for week 40 these numbers are at 127 844 individuals and 130 058 tests).
25792,"Explanation in the text reads "" The table above shows the number of individuals tested and the number of tests performed in Sweden."
25793,The table shows how many unique individuals have been tested with each type of test and how many tests have been performed in total in the current week.
25794,"Note that the same individual may not occur more than once per test during the same week, however, the same individual may occur more than once in different weeks. """
25795,"**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."
25796,"On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

25831,I can't think of any.
25832,There's a point of no return.

26245,"COVID-19 patients now occupy 40% of ICU beds in the Paris region, and nearly a quarter in ICUs nationwide, as several weeks of growing infections among young people spread to vulnerable populations."
26246,"----

France hasn’t added significant ICU capacity or the staff needed to manage extra beds, according to national health agency figures and doctors at multiple hospitals."
26247,"----

“It’s very tense, we don’t have any more places,” Dr. Debbat told The Associated Press."
26248,"His hospital is converting recovery rooms into ICUs, delaying non-urgent surgery and directing more and more of his staff to high-maintenance COVID patients."
26249,"Asked about extra medics to help with the new cases, he said simply, “We don’t have them."
26250,"That’s the problem.”

----

For comparison, Germany entered the pandemic with about five times as many intensive care beds as France, which has a similarly well-developed health care system and slightly smaller population."
26251,"To date, Germany’s confirmed virus-related death toll is 9,584 compared to 32,521 in France."
26252,"------

The number of virus patients in ICU quickly doubled last month in the New Civilian Hospital in Strasbourg, but the atmosphere is surprisingly calm."
26253,An AP reporter watched teams of medics coordinating closely to manage the trajectory and treatment of each patient according to strict protocols they’re now accustomed to.
26254,But that extra practice doesn’t mean managing resurgent virus cases in ICUs is easy.
26255,"In addition to extra breathing machines and other equipment, adding temporary ICU beds also takes time and labor – as does treating the COVID-19 patients in them."
26256,"-----

Dr. Debbat in Arles said that training ICU staff takes several months, so he’s relying on the same personnel levels as in the spring, and he worries they could burn out."
26257,"“I’m like a coach and I have just one team, with no reserve players,” he said."
26258,"He also worries about non-virus patients, who were already put on the back burner earlier this year."
26259,"And he worries about the upcoming flu season, which sends about 2,000 patients to ICUs in France every year."
26260,"-------

But he said the French public and its leaders were wrong to think “the virus was behind us.”

“There aren’t enough beds ... and there is especially a lack of personnel,” he said."
26261,"And with his service seeing a steady uptick in cases and the pandemic wearing on, he warned, “what’s missing is an end date.”"
26262,deadly.

26267,The people who consume Western media know the media lies but they're stuck with believing only opposing political parties lie.
26268,That's the gist of it for media focused on domestic issues.
26269,"For international news, just expect fake news 24/7 if the country is an enemy of the West."
26270,They believe the media lied in the past (Iraq WMDs) but they're not currently lying now.
26271,Western propaganda hides behind sources.
26272,It quotes dubious people and research so the media corporations are not held accountable when the news turns out to be fake.
26273,They're relying on people not to verify information directly from the root source.

26278,The government doesn't want to talk about negative news so it just censors information.
26279,"Unlike Western propaganda, Chinese propaganda doesn't even like putting down other countries."
26280,That's why most Chinese people still have a rosy picture of the United States.
26281,It's not that people don't notice Chinese propaganda.

26297,"At this rate the death toll by 1st Februay would be around 300,000."
26298,"The big problem is winter - we know from influenza, and deaths in the Southern Hemisphere that rates are far higher."
26299,"So using the predicted ""Flu Season"" of October to March it is likely that death rates will increase."
26300,"At 1000 deaths a day  the total by February is 330,000 and at 1500  daily  (not impossible given thet we reached over 2200 a day at the peak back in April)  385,000."
26301,"This is the best and most relevant comment of the second half of 2020, specially if it proves to be correct."

26312,"I heard that early one they were to eager to ventilate people, do you think that led to unneeded deaths?"
26313,"Obviously, it is no ones fault considering it was a new virus and no one knew exactly how to treat it."
26314,I was responding mostly to the portion where you said it was inconsiderate to assume Mormons know the teachings of Jesus.
26315,"Although I’m sure Mormons interpret his teachings differently, there’s solid overlap I think."
26316,"I think what the OP was getting at was something like what follows:
Love thy neighbor is arguably Jesus’ most famous teaching, and wearing a mask can be seen as an act of consideration towards one’s neighbors/those around them."
26317,"Accordingly, it’s antithetical to the doctrine not to be doing it."
26318,"I could be wrong, but I don’t think OP was connecting the love thy neighbor mask thing to the door-to-door proselytizing that Mormons do."

26395,"Start in February and consider than in 9 months, ~1M people have died from COVID and annually, 1.5M people die of TB."
26396,&gt; Then you say that we knew about fomite transmission from the very beginning.
26397,Your evidence?
26398,An article from april.
26399,Science has been clear from the beginning that COVID transmits via air and that you need to wash your hands.
26400,"Just because they didn't explicitly come out and say ""stop wiping down your fucking groceries"" doesn't mean that science supported, advocated or suggested it was a good idea to wipe down groceries."
26401,"They were probably busy working on vaccines, identifying risk groups and effective treatments and didn't factor that there would be people stupid enough to actually wipe down their cereal boxes."
26402,You did so out of paranoia and a lack of information which doesn't surprise me since you apparently think COVID started killing people in May.
26403,The concern was that Putin was pushing for a vaccine rollout in October prior to phase 3 even starting.
26404,Only 76 people had the vaccine at that point and he was claiming it was good to go.
26405,They've also done this while not providing any data to independent sources to verify efficacy.
26406,Their own internal agencies even advised against a roll out prior to phase 3 completing.
26407,It's fair to point out that that is all Putin and I think it's rational to be skeptical of what he puts out himself for obvious reasons.

26424,In my German city people are very good with the indoors mask mandate but noone wears them outdoors.

26428,I'd personally prefer massive peaceful public uprising leading to power transition which will result in the restoration of dormant democratic institutions and gradual liberalization of the political and economical systems.
26429,"Seems very unlikely as almost the entire government system is built to prevent that, and Putin has loyal police forces to suppress the protests."

26432,"If he agreed to peacefully resign for guarantees of his personal safety and freedom, I would support making him untouchable, although I believe he deserves a life sentence."

26506,I think public officials were deliberately undermining their own lockdowns to make a case that lockdowns don't work.
26507,They deliberately made it seem like everything was about flattening the curve which gave the very unimaginative public the impression that that was the end game.
26508,Apparently people in general aren't capable of understanding that people don't just magically stop being infectious because the daily number of cases evens out.
26509,I mean it seems really simple to me but what can you do?
26510,"Of course they did, this will be compounded by the up coming election."
26511,Washington state will lose inslee and culp will win.

26521,"My guess is no, because you would not have made those statements."
26522,"Typical nurse to patient ratio is 2:1 in an ICU, and during the influx in NY the ratio was much higher."
26523,A friend is an ICU travel nurse and said one of her shifts was 6:1.
26524,"Caring for patients that sick is a specialization, and when the ratios are that poor there is higher risk for medical error, care is worse, and staff is exhausted."
26525,"Also with that many patients, you go through more PPE, which there wasn’t enough of, and healthcare providers died."
26526,A LOT of people died from it being overrun.
26527,Most important tourists for years have been the Russians I hope for the tourism sector they keep coming

26583,What’s the next tactic when the “winter is coming” thing doesn’t pan out by Jan?
26584,B.
26585,The chances of covid death for those under retirement age is minuscule (not to mention that the average age of covid death is at or above the average life span of a US citizen.)
26586,"C. 35k people a year die in car accidents, that’s terrible - how many of those trips were non-essential?"
26587,Do we ban cars?
26588,Limit the reasons one can drive?

26595,Not only is he not wrong he has directly contributed to research that will result in a vaccine for this virus.

26606,None of this has been a issue with any of the kids and they follow the rules(she actually is so used to the mask she forgets to take it off when I pick her up!
26607,)She’s been back to school for 8 weeks now and they have had 0 cases of coronavirus and I’m in Missouri so it’s a hot spot.
26608,I think if done properly going to school is fine but most older kids(highschool and college) don’t follow the rules and honestly can do online so keep them home.

26746,Yeah but I mean countries like Slovakia and Czechia or even Germany simply can't keep their borders closed off until there is a vaccine and virus is eradicated.
26747,I'm from Bratislava so I know very well how much trade work and living is done across the borders.
26748,I'm out of the loop (other side of the planet) so am genuinely curious.

26750,Didn't they prevent the center for disease control from being involved?
26751,"Who is, or can, provide accurate reports?"
26752,If this is true then its a good deal.
26753,Covid patients spend a huge amount of time in the hospital.
26754,Decreasing the time  needd to be hospitalized will decrease resources used per person and increase the amount of people that can receive treatment.

26764,"The situation your in is something everyone is in, and if you can’t seem to see that you little bit of suffering is for the greater good then there really is no reason to keep explaining it to you."

26772,"There's also the chance that by the time herd immunity occurs naturally or with a vaccine, the virus could mutate enough to be able to bypass an individual's pre-existing immunity."
26773,"Not saying that's likely or probable, but when it comes down to viral mutations, there's always a chance...

After all, this virus' animal borne ancestor had to mutate enough to not only be able to jump species, but be able to efficiently spread from human to human, something that SARS 1 wasn't too good at in 2003, and none of the past 20 years of avian flu scares have been able to accomplish too well either..."

26800,"Copy/Pasted the article, formatting didn't hold:



Nearly 6,000 experts, including dozens from the UK, say the approach is having a devastating impact on physical and mental health as well as society."
26801,"They are calling for protection to be focused on the vulnerable, while healthy people get on with their lives."
26802,The declaration has prompted warnings by others in the scientific community.
26803,"Critics have pointed out:

a more targeted approach could make it difficult to protect vulnerable people entirely
the risk of long-term complications from coronavirus mean many others are also at risk
But the movement - known as the Great Barrington Declaration - mirrors some of the warnings in a letter signed by a group of GPs in the UK."
26804,"Sixty-six GPs, including TV doctors Dr Phil Hammond and Dr Rosemary Leonard and a number of medics who have held senior roles at the British Medical Association, have written to the health secretary, saying there is insufficient emphasis on ""non-Covid harms"" in the decision-making."
26805,What is the Great Barrington Declaration?
26806,The movement started in the US.
26807,"And the declaration has now been signed by nearly 6,000 scientists and medical experts across the globe as well as 50,000 members of the public."
26808,"The UK-based experts who have signed it include:

Dr Sunetra Gupta, an epidemiologist at Oxford University
Nottingham University self-harm expert Prof Ellen Townsend
Edinburgh University disease modeller Dr Paul McKeigue
They say keeping the lockdown policies in place until a vaccine is available would cause ""irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed""."
26809,"The health harms cited include:

lower childhood vaccination rates
worsening care for heart disease and cancer patients
And they point out the risk from coronavirus is 1,000 times greater for the old and infirm, with children more at risk from flu than Covid-19."
26810,"As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all - including the vulnerable - falls, they say."
26811,"And this would be a much more ""compassionate"" approach."
26812,"The declaration recommends a number of measures to protect the vulnerable, including regular testing of care-home workers, with a move as far as possible towards using staff who have acquired immunity."
26813,"Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered, it says."
26814,"And when possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside."
26815,"Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick, should be practised by everyone."
26816,"But:

young low-risk individuals should be allowed to work normally
schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching
sports and cultural activities could resume and restaurants reopen"
26817,Why does it seem impossible?
26818,Serious question: what is that claim based on?
26819,I’m still going strong on unemployment :/ fucking sucks.

26844,Only maybe 3/4 people walking around in crowded areas is wearing a mask.
26845,"And then of course you have your nose-out group, and your loose bandana/fleece group which have been shown to be a lot less effective than proper masks."
26846,"If that is enough to significantly slow the spread here, imagine if the mask mandate was nationwide, if we had proper widespread public health messaging that a loose bandana or nose-out doesn't cut it anymore, and then if police departments could be somehow incentivized to give out tickets for non-compliance."
26847,"If you can get a ticket for all kinds of trivial stuff like jaywalking or parking your car somewhere a little too too long, why in the world is stopping a pandemic not a good enough reason to also give tickets?"
26848,"We could stop covid in its tracks in a month, people could visit their families again, local businesses would have more customers."
26849,It's so infuriating that there is no will to do something so simple.
26850,"(And it's easy to blame Trump, but afaik even Biden hasn't explicitly said that he'd impose a national mask mandate, and certainly nobody on the left or right is talking about actually enforcing the local mask mandates we do have)."

26944,He has also stated that therefor every decision that the government makes about making masks mandatory in certain places is a political decision and not a scientific one.
26945,"If anything he is scared that wearing a non-medical mask will give people a false sense of security which causes them to take rules like social distancing (1,5m) less strict."
26946,Because this is coming from a person that is among the most knowledgeable about the virus and its transmission in our country I think he is right.

27059,I had no idea so many people died from the flu every year.
27060,How many deaths should we accept annually before we start wearing masks and social distancing during every flu season?
27061,They currently aren’t on speaking terms.
27062,[removed]
27063,Are we taking extreme measures?
27064,I hear plenty on this sub about how the US has a weak and ineffectual response and that nobody is complying and that is why our death numbers are so bad.
27065,I'd like to know whether you think our measures are extreme or impotent.
27066,"The numbers I shared regarding TB is that ~1.5 million people die globally every year from TB, TB is a contagious respiratory disease that affects all age ranges and we don't wear masks, or lock down our economies indefinitely to combat TB."
27067,We treat people when they catch TB just like we should treat people who catch COVID.
27068,There's plenty in the science that supported schools opening - like COVID being the #15-20th leading cause of adolescent mortality yet people being terrified of their children dying of COVID.
27069,"As it turns out, people like you scream ""listen to the science"" until it becomes some dipshit emotional tug of whether it saves just one life, then keeping healthy people immobile for 2+ years is worth it."
27070,It's a combination of a few things.
27071,- We are better at treating it and catching it early.
27072,"- We are testing more, which means that we see more cases."
27073,"- Many of those who were going to die have already passed

one more thing is that previously, during Europe's ""first wave"" there were likely way more actual people infected than what we saw on case counts."
27074,"Even though it *looks* like Spain, for example, is experiencing the same surge they saw months ago, it is likely much smaller than the actual surge from back then."
27075,daily case counts do not normalize for the amount of testing being done.
27076,"If we tested as much as we did now, starting in march, we'd have a more accurate picture painted."

27082,You see the #exceptinschools hashtag trending.
27083,Governments are willing to bet the health and safety of children and teachers to keep the economy going.
27084,But I guess that’s a given.
27085,"They’ve been underfunding education for decades, so what’s the point of funding it properly in a pandemic for safety reasons?"
27086,They’re hurting kids in normal times.
27087,Pandemic times are just another issue they don’t want to spend money on.

27091,"Encourage mass migration to live with folks who share your political views, and the US can have universal health care,  free college, and other ""socialist"" programs, and Trump's supporters can live in a capitalist's paradise."
27092,We also won't have to subsidize the welfare/republican states any more.
27093,The fact that our (edit:Canada's) Senate actually votes on things is very helpful.

27098,"Also, Russia was basically a basket case of a country during Bill Clinton's tenure, and let's not forget that Clinton himself played a large role in the continued political legitimacy of Yeltsin, who was a disaster for Russia."

27107,Lol.
27108,The lockdowns ended months ago...
27109,Clickbait shite.
27110,How much did heart attack and stroke deaths drop in other places?
27111,I'd be shocked if it dropped the 40-50% many doctors were citing in March and April.
27112,"[Here's one example](https://www.google.com/amp/s/turnto10.com/amp/features/health-landing-page/hospitals-see-fewer-heart-attack-stroke-visits-in-emergency-department) of a hospital in RI where visits dropped by 33%, which they agree may be somewhat due to lower numbers of heart attacks and strokes occurring."
27113,"They also point out, however, that those who do show up are showing up later, which of course will increase the fatality rate of any emergent situation."
27114,"If not visiting the ER and dying as a result is fear-induced, you'd expect to see the same thing we're seeing here - that excess deaths closely follow C-19 curves and that they're much higher in places with higher case/death counts."
27115,"And *my exact point* is that we can't disentangle how many excess Alzheimer's, heart attack, diabetes, etc deaths are due to a lack of care vs the virus."
27116,"Saying that ""all"" the excess death is due to one thing when we have evidence to the contrary is problematic."
27117,Same here in the US.
27118,"Only place that came close to being overwhelmed was NYC but the Federal goverment, Local Gov, and Corps of engineers kept it under control."

27121,It's 2020.
27122,"It actually could be bad and since there's no info, expect the worst."
27123,There's probably a reason why there's no info because the news would obviously pin point it to the Trump event.
27124,Which is likely where he did get it from and it wouldn't look good.

27133,"I went with dedicated office space as this allowed me to claim .52cents per hr but also claim my asset purchases  - computer, desk, chair, etc."
27134,The covid19 way didnt let you claim any asset purchases and the other way was too much work.

27138,Most kids are probably not gonna learn anything about managing life.
27139,The pandemic just means no experiences are happening except Netflix.
27140,Screens just aren't as stimulating as using all your senses and really interacting with other people and never will be.
27141,Some smart kids might use the time for learning stuff online but for the vast majority this will be a setback in mental and physical development.
27142,I vacation in Disney world every few years and watch a lot of Disney YouTube channels.
27143,I definitely would not travel to vacation there but if I were local day-trips would be tempting.
27144,Crowds are low so wait times for rides are a fraction of what’s normal.
27145,And Disney has fairly stringent protocols in place and they enforce the rules for the most part.
27146,But taking the family for a vacation is out of the question.
27147,Mask wearing is the least of it.
27148,I would do that without issue.
27149,But many hotels and restaurants are closed and operating hours for everything has been drastically cut.
27150,"No fireworks, parades or any kind of shows that can draw a crowd."
27151,A lot of services and amenities have been limited or discontinued.
27152,And all for the same price it always was.
27153,In the best of times Disney is overpriced but even ignoring the risk of getting sick Disney during covid is a terrible deal.

27155,Imagine if the FDA ends the trial for good?
27156,What does that say to the Europeans who are going to be injecting 100M+ people in December?
27157,They had to wait until the president got it.
27158,Same thing in most of the west.
27159,Surge in cases doesnt lead to a surge in death as we have learned more about the virus and have better treatment options.
27160,When did the United States have a lockdown?
27161,Individual state lockdowns are pretty pointless when you can freely travel to Florida.

27208,What you're describing is selfishness and that's exactly what the problem is.
27209,"People who are so fucking selfish that they can't handle even an extremely minor inconvenience like wearing a mask when they leave the house, even when they know that it will save the lives and protect the health of the people around them."
27210,They won't do it even when they know they are putting the health of their own family and loved ones at risk.
27211,Both Mongolia and Vietnam contained the virus.

27214,"Covidtracking.com has graphs for daily new cases per capita, daily new deaths per capita, and current hospitalizations per capita for each state."
27215,https://www.investigatetv.com/coronavirus-hospitalizations/ is easier to navigate and has hospitalizations per capita for each state.
27216,I think this is the best metric to compare across periods of time anyways as it’s not influenced by changing testing capacity or mortality rate.
27217,"With these charts, you can see how the March peak in New York, New Jersey, etc."
27218,was double what any state hit during the second u.s. peak
27219,Obviously those people have aligned themselves with the wrong side of the Mask problem.
27220,I am of the personal responsibility faith.
27221,They should be allowed to experience the natural consequences of their choices.
27222,I think the most dangerous thing about Covid is that it doesn’t kill quite enough people.
27223,"It’s right there on the bubble where it’s low enough for morons to somehow live in the fantasy that it’s not a big deal, which ironically makes it worse because of all the infected people who don’t die but instead to continue to spread it."
27224,If it killed more people I think it would have been harder to deny it was serious by the 20-30% of people who are grade a morons in our country and we would have actually beaten this thing.

&amp;#x200B;

You can be around others after:

* 10 days since symptoms first appeared **and**
* 24 hours with no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications **and**
* Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving\*

*\*Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation​*

Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results."

27543,"They directly associate this ruined economy with democracy, thus they consider the collapse of the Soviet Union a tragedy, and they want a strong Soviet-like leader, which Putin gives them."
27544,"Also, people are often nostalgic about the times when they were young, they tend to remember the good things and forget the bad things."
27545,So when are you going to defend your original point rather than deflect the argument like your kind are so accustomed at doing?
27546,"Some points regarding sweden and the analysis of ""the death toll"" that people often bring up."
27547,"First, let's establish that many countries have different ways of counting covid-19 mortality."
27548,"It's hard to find definitive information for how countries count what a covid death is, and you have places in the USA for example that seem to count it in different ways depending on state."
27549,"How Arizona counts a covid death may not be the same way New York counts one, how New York counts one may not be the same way Florida or France or Italy or Spain or Japan or South Korea count one."
27550,"Because of this, it's difficult to make comparisons by going on worldometers and looking at ""covid deaths,"" at least in my opinion."
27551,"Because of this, I believe it's more insightful to look at excess and all cause mortality, adjust for population growth, and look at how excess and all cause death compare to the... say, past five to ten years of mortality in that country, then look at how countries did."
27552,"This method of mortality analysis serves to do a couple of things: 

- Get past the issue of various countries/states having different definitions for what a covid death is."
27553,"- provide a comparison for how mortality is impacted by, say, decreased mortality in previous years (which means there would be more of a ""dry tinder"" effect, which I'll return to later) and put this mortality in context with previous influenza/epidemic seasons

Though with this method we also must remember that we are not saying that every excess death in ""covid season"" is a covid death."
27554,"That assumes that covid is the only thing killing people more than average, and that there aren't increases in death from other causes."
27555,"Another way of phrasing it would be that ascribing all excess deaths to be covid related means one believes there are no ""lockdown deaths,"" if you will."
27556,"However that's a different conversation, so back to the point."
27557,"[This handy graphic compares all cause mortality in SWE from January 1st to September 27th of each year 2015-2020, and is population adjusted."
27558,](https://imgur.com/a/8qUuDMw) See source on bottom if you'd like to verify the chart yourself.
27559,"Here, we can observe the ""dry tinder"" effect created by an unusually mild 2019 death season."
27560,"This means that there tragically a lot of people who, on average, would have passed in 2019 but lived to 2020, meaning that COVID had a lot of somewhat ""easy targets"" to pick off."

Long story short, we have to put things into context and understand that different countries count covid deaths differently."
27564,Knowing this makes for a much more productive analysis of the Sweden experience with covid.
27565,Does anyone know of similar analyses for other countries?
27566,What negative aspects are there for China to just own this?
27567,Im oblivious to how the world works but ....
27568,"If the other countries have a beef about it, China just tells them to #&amp;$^$ off right?"
27569,I mean its not like there's enough paper bills to compensate for this and even if that were the goal how do you figure something like that?
27570,I figure this is a planet problem and its really a trivial issue and weird that politics even matter in it.
27571,Apparently it's a lot more than some.
27572,"Also, and I'm beating a dead horse here, the official case numbers from early in the pandemic are probably 10-20 times low, possibly more in harder hit areas."
27573,Drump - Hold my mask!
27574,"I agree with you, when the pandemic started, I basically locked my parents in their house and didn’t let them come out for any reason."
27575,I was doing all their shopping even though I was scared shitless every time I stepped foot outside my apt.
27576,"I ended up getting covid, but I knew there was a big chance of this happening."
27577,My parents are okay and that’s all that matters to me.

27586,&gt; Military leaders do not have the authority to plan and execute an attack without presidential/congressional approval.
27587,"If we're in a situation where an attack is clearly imminent and Trump is being delusional about it, somehow I don't really see the military caring all that much about what does and doesn't require his approval."
27588,"Traveling for work is not the same as travelling to gather in a amusement park, and 120 miles would allow people from different counties to travel and meet at the amusement park."
27589,The counties are on different levels from each other.
27590,"I don't think speculating ""Well those people probably already travel across county lines for all kinds of things so this won't make a difference"" is a surefire analysis, and I think during this pandemic justifying any action with ""Well this right here is being done so it won't make a big difference if we do it here too"" is not good."
27591,Two wrongs don't make a right.
27592,"People travel from far and wide to go to amusement parks, they are designed to attract people from all over."
27593,"I cannot say the same for malls, restaurants, bars."
27594,"You say Disney is good at enforcing the rules, however I saw a ton of videos of people at Disney without masks yelling about how they have a medical condition that won't allow them to wear the mask, including that mom daughter combo that livestreamed themselves without masks, talking about how the daughter felt sick and what not which got some media attention a while back."
27595,I have not personally seen the leaked guidelines you keep referencing so I'm just playing Devil's Advocate here.
27596,"I do remember Disney had a guideline in other states that said you must wear a mask except while eating, so everyone just walked around with a hotdog in their hand and no masks, but I think they changed that rule after."
27597,"I am still of the opinion that until we get everything mostly under control, nothing unessential should be opened."
27598,"LA County is still in purple tier and within 120 miles of the amusement parks, so people should not be allowed to travel there and attend."
27599,It depends on the amount of risk you are willing to take.
27600,It's obviously riskier than not going but if it's spaced out enough to maintain social distancing and you workout with a mask the risk is minimal.

27667,Have it!
27668,We'll be waiting a decade for another album anyway.
27669,Should be plenty of recovery time.
27670,I wish I had your optimism.
27671,What sort of evidence are you looking for?
27672,"While lockdowns undoubtedly lead to other deaths (missed cancer screenings, cardiovascular impacts, suicides, etc), I doubt that comes close to the number of senior citizens we’ve lost to covid thus far."
27673,So if you’re expecting “evidence” of deaths being higher due to lockdown I don’t think I have it.
27674,"If you look at essentially any other factor and focus on quality of life for those that are *living,* it becomes a different picture."
27675,"I don’t know how to quantify the crash of the economy, loss of jobs and livelihood, loss of general happiness and well being of the population, loss of social life, loss of normalcy and innocence for a generation of kids, etc, etc vs the premature death of a septuagenarian."

27677,Pretty much what we heard from friends in St Petersburg.
27678,"Well many German theaters have the luxury of opening at limited capacity, making basically no profit because they’re supported by the local governments."
27679,Also their repertoire model allows them to pick some of smaller productions already in their repertoire and even change the new productions to go with COVID restrictions.
27680,Broadway basically depends on profit and because of copyright issues they can’t just change and adapt shows to current restrictions.

27706,Why can't people just wear their masks?
27707,"Just a thought and I'm by no means an expert, but perhaps those who are asymptomatic or have mild infections that mimic seasonal allergies go out and seed their communities for weeks and once that incubation period is up, the scores of people who were potentially exposed by the asymptomatic/ mildly infected start showing symptoms all at once and start filling the hospitals and testing centers in quick succession, many others of those exposed will also be asymptomatic/ have mild infections and repeat the process elsewhere."

27717,Do you think that is accurate?
27718,Does it only pertain to those going against Putting?
27719,"There's something called the ""excess death rate."""
27720,Basically we have good statistical models of how many people are likely to die over a given period of time.
27721,"Once we know how many people in fact died over a period of time, any significant difference is highly likely to be due to an exogenous shock."
27722,"Usually, this takes the form of a spike of ""excess deaths"" (actual deaths above the statistical prediction) due to a disaster."
27723,"In the case of COVID, barring some secondary disaster that kills a lot of people (like a major, major earthquake or a second major outbreak of disease), excess deaths will correlate well to uncounted COVID deaths."
27724,"Since COVID measures appear to be sharply reducing deaths from non-COVID disease--such as seasonal flu--simply adding the excess deaths to the official tally may still be an undercount, but it will be a lot closer than the ""official"" tally in a lot of places."
