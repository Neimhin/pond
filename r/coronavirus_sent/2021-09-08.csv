20,I responded to a different comment but it looks like United is putting employees with approved exemptions on leave until COVID is better handled or (for non person-facing jobs) until they can do better testing and sanitization.

""Pilots, flight attendants, gate agents and airport customer service agents who interact with customers who are granted those exemptions can return to work ‚Äúonce the pandemic meaningfully recedes,‚Äù United said, without specifying the timeframe."
38,"Other employees like mechanics and dispatchers granted exemptions can return to work after the airline puts in new testing and other measures, the carrier said in a staff note."
39,"It is still determining safety measures for office workers with exemptions and whether they need to come in at all."""
40,I'm taking this to mean that for employees who dont get vaccinated AND are approved for an exemption they are just put on leave until it's safer for them to work again.
41,A very interesting approach that balances safety and personal choices.
42,For those that are denied an exemption though they'll be fired if they don't get the vaccine within a certain timeframe.

87,"My city (Seattle) has 750,000 people and today we had 106 positive tests and ZERO new hospitalizations, and the state is in the middle of a surge in cases."

128,but my tooth aches are gone and i already cant wait for my second dose.
129,My period was 2 weeks late after having COVID and after both vaccines.
130,The amount of cramping/bleeding was about 3 times longer/more than usual.
131,The irony...
132,Well the supreme court ruled that they aren‚Äôt actually obligated to protect citizens.
133,Guess we can‚Äôt be surprised that Portland cops won‚Äôt protect others by getting the vaccine.
134,Still less than two weeks‚Äô worth of cases at a single elementary school in my district!

180,It's not a silver bullet.
181,Take the standard medicines if you have Covid and want to get better.
182,Why the craziness?
183,It's probably because the Bolsonaro government in Brazil decided to basically turn ivermectin into a state religion.
184,That seeded it to be picked up by contrarians in other countries.
185,That is out of over 4.2 million cases though in children 17 and under.

203,2) There didn't seem to be anyone knowledgeable in the White House and they were not prepared to give power to the health authorities.
204,The third thing was the number of Americans trying to get home before the planes stopped flying and lots of people were crammed together.
205,Opportunities were lost but the saddest thing is the conspiracy theorists and that it became political instead of just a health issue.

355,** I mean if there's no proposed mechanism then hell let's try high doses of acyclovir because at least that does something that involves a virus.
356,"I'm just salty about all these people who are like ""well the science isn't settled"" -- ok, but why this drug?"
357,Why would we investigate an anti-parasitic's effects on a virus?

360,I don't think you realize how big a difference that is.

372,"Question about clinical trials - when companies publish efficacy statistics, these numbers simply reflect the portion of vaccinated people that got infected versus the portion of unvaccinated people that got infected."
373,"But this doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that in some trials, most subjects may be at home but in other trials, most subjects may be going out which increases their exposure."
374,"For example, Pfizer reports 95% efficacy, but this could just be because most vaccinated people never got exposed to Covid in the first place, right?"
375,Why isn‚Äôt there a standard for measuring how much exposure there is between groups in studies?
376,"I know intentionally exposing people to diseases is unethical, but why can‚Äôt we do this on rats?"

402,"&gt;For fully vaccinated Americans, the risk of being hospitalized or dying from Covid-19 is low -- much lower than the risk for unvaccinated people."
403,"But in those rare cases when a fully vaccinated person gets infected, data suggests it's older adults and those with multiple underlying medical conditions who are most at risk of serious illness."
404,"&gt;  
&gt;As of August 30, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received reports of 12,908 severe breakthrough cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated people that resulted in hospitalization or death."
405,"For the more than 173 million people who were fully vaccinated by that date, that represents a less than a 1 in 13,000 chance of experiencing a severe breakthrough case of Covid-19."
406,"&gt;  
&gt;About 70% of breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization were among adults 65 and older and about 87% of breakthrough cases resulting in death were among adults 65 and older, the CDC data suggests."
407,"&gt;  
&gt;‚Äã Unvaccinated adults in the United States are 17 times more likely to be hospitalized for Covid-19 than fully vaccinated adults, and patients hospitalized with a breakthrough case tend to be older and more likely to have at least three underlying medical conditions, according to a preprint study the CDC posted last week."

458,"2) The authors argue for the inclusion of Ivermectin in combination therapies, including vaccinations, not as a stand alone treatment or for prophalatic use."

491,"If the outcome of not getting the vaccine is that they can't work, then they weren't ""exempted"" at all...that's the same treatment someone would get who refused to take the vaccine even normally."
492,Would be more direct to just say there are no exemptions.

498,Makes more sense to require vaccination/negative tests for domestic flights.
499,"This was my exact experience after the first dose, but strangely not the second."
500,I think the real issue with ivermectin is that most who advocate for its use are anti-vaxers who believe it's a suitable substitute for getting an actual vaccine.

680,The older you are the higher the vaccination rate generally but the death rate goes up as you get older obviously.
681,If 90% of 80+ year olds are vaccinated and that's the case in many areas then most of the deaths in the 80+ range might be vaccinated.
682,The death rate within the group will be much worse for unvaccinated 80+ group but they're so out numbered they may not have more raw deaths.
683,The huge crowd of unvaccinated age 18-45 year olds doesn't move the needle when it's mostly age 65+ who are dying.
684,The 18-45's are having worse outcomes but death is still rare for them compared to say an 85 year old vaccinated person who gets a breakthrough case.
685,Over 20% are under 12.
686,Among adults the vaccination rate is above 80%.
687,For 60+ yrs old its roughly 90%.

776,"Because of this, a third dose is being recommended."

903,I tipped off the local newspaper and TV station.
904,The TV crew went the next AM to ask the principal  and low and behold they were just sending home half the 7th grade for another + case.
905,"Perfect timing for them to interview the principal and parents...  Really rained on their 'success, we reopened' messaging."
906,"Since then they have numerous kids leaving sick every day.. no testing encouraged    

Today the school emails they bought some Abbott rapid tests and want permission to test as needed."
907,Which of course means off-label... 1 not 2 per student 36hrs apart.

920,"Sure there are issues with some of them, but as I mentioned in an earlier post (did you read that part?)"
921,they assessed quality of each study and then weighted the totals in favor of the stronger studies.
922,"Anyhow back to your assertion about the use of healthier patients, this is their description of the range of health conditions in the 15 studies that looked at the use of IVM in the treatment of hospitalized patients."
923,"As you‚Äôll notice, there was a range of health conditions."
924,‚ÄúThe effect on reducing deaths was consistent across mild to moderate and severe disease subgroups.‚Äù
925,There's a large amount of individuals who received J&amp;J as their first shot and decided not to keep waiting for additional protection and get one or two mRNA shots on their own.
926,There is also a subset of people who had guidance from their primary care doctor to get one or two mRNA boosters as they were immunocompromised and are recommended to get a booster by the FDA yet have no options since people who got J&amp;J have mostly been ignored with respect to boosters.
927,"Ultimately you are the best judge of your risk tolerance for your protection against delta/new variants, and so your health and wellbeing is in your own hands."
928,"You're welcome to wait for guidance from the govt as to what you should do next, and you're also welcome to no wait and get your ""first"" shot at a clinic that doses Pfizer/Moderna."
929,Relying because your question seems like it may not be rhetorical.
930,Religious exemptions (COVID vaccine or otherwise) usually contain some language about the belief being sincerely held.
931,This works out ok for people that sincerely do hold a religious belief about a medical treatment (Christian Scientists and 7th Day Adventists are well known examples).
932,For those who seek to abuse the exemption policy it becomes a bit of a game of chicken with the enforcer making a judgment on the risks of allowing an exemption vs the risks of getting tagged for religious discrimination against a Pastafarian.

999,"* This is an interesting study design, test negative, as it looks at thousands of admissions to inpatient care as well as other outpatient environments."
1000,"* There's a link on the right hand side to an editorial that explains how the test negative design is only now being used for Covid research, but has a history with other diseases."
1001,* They analyzed data from thousands of people in nine states and hundreds of hospitals and clinics.
1002,"* There are really detailed appendices breaking down the data further (who, what kind of illness, what kind of care, etc), but everyone analyzed was 50 or older."
1003,"* Because the research continued as Delta variant spread, the table S1 (in the appendix, linked in the document) specifies when, in different regions, different variants became more or less common."
1004,"\[edited to fix quote formatting\]

&gt;The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (‚â•14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 85 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit."
1005,"&gt;  
&gt;The effectiveness of full vaccination with respect to a Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization or emergency department or urgent care clinic visit was similar with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and ranged from 81% to 95% among adults 85 years of age or older, persons with chronic medical conditions, and Black or Hispanic adults."
1006,"&gt;  
&gt;...Our findings complement those in other recent studies of the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization6,7 and expand our knowledge of the clinical protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines in at least four ways."
1007,"&gt;  
&gt;First, mRNA-based vaccines were highly effective among adults who were 85 years of age or older and persons with chronic medical conditions."
1008,"This finding is reassuring, given that these groups can have impaired immune responses to other vaccines and are most at risk for severe and prolonged manifestations of Covid-19 and death."
1009,"&gt;  
&gt;Second, in Black adults and Hispanic adults, who have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, mRNA-based vaccines were similarly effective with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization and an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit."
1010,"&gt;  
&gt;Third, the effectiveness of full mRNA-based vaccination remained consistently high at least until 112 days after the second dose, which was the longest interval since vaccination during our study period."
1011,"&gt;  
&gt;Fourth, we examined the effectiveness of all three authorized Covid-19 vaccines in the United States."
1012,"&gt;  
&gt;This study complements other published estimates of the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and it confirms that the effectiveness of full vaccination with mRNA-1273 is very similar to that of BNT162b2 with respect to both hospital and emergency department or urgent care outcomes."
1013,"&gt;  
&gt;Among adults 50 years of age or older, the effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 73% with respect to a Covid-19‚Äìassociated emergency department or urgent care visit and 68% with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization; these estimates were lower than those for full vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccines, but, pending further research, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small number of observations."

1077,That sounds like a combination of the greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

1089,"No, but I am very afraid of these so called temporary measures being made permanent across society."
1090,"It's unfortunate that some people have medical issues that make them more vulnerable to the virus, but that means THEY have to take extra personal precautions that DO NOT include forcing actions or mandates upon other people."

""...This variant has a constellation of mutations that suggests that it would evade certain antibodies ‚Äî not only monoclonal antibodies, but vaccine and convalescent serum-induced antibodies ‚Äî but there isn‚Äôt a lot of clinical data to suggest that."
1222,"It is mostly laboratory, in vitro data....""  
             
""But remember, even when you have variants that do diminish, somewhat, the efficacy of a vaccine ‚Äî the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that type."""
1223,"""Bottom line: We‚Äôre paying attention to it."
1224,We take everything like that seriously.
1225,"But we don‚Äôt consider it an immediate threat right now."""

1278,Lol in much of the US that is pretty definitely in the same state.
1279,No it‚Äôs not.
1280,So tired of these ridiculous push to try and manipulate people into just taking the vaccine.
1281,[removed]
1282,There was a study that this stuff can infect you through the eye mucosa.
1283,Masks just aren't enough.
1284,I remember when this started seeing goggles being a thing in the Asian countries.
1285,I have to go into the office Tuesday for a board meeting.
1286,I'm wondering if it's worth trying to overnight a pair of Wiley X's and look like a goof in the meeting.
1287,I've seen medical bills where a single night in the hospital in NYC cost 30k.
1288,The basic flu still kills millions.
1289,:( I wish I could mount an argument against this but I can‚Äôt.
1290,"Yeah turns out making medicine is difficult, who would have guessed."
1291,"Or you know head on down to Tractor Supply and get some of that apple flavored goodness, I'm hearing tremendous things about the healing properties of that."
1292,"People shouldn't use ivermectin to treat covid, as there is no evidence that it helps."
1293,That being said this article is a huge click bait when you actually read the research paper.
1294,They screened 385 people out of which only 37 were eligible.
1295,"From the 37 patients they found low sperm counts, but whether ivermectin is the direct cause is unknown."
1296,"&gt;However, a recent report showed that 85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with 
ivermectin in the recent past who went to the laboratory..."
1297,"This is stated in the research paper, but it's not the result of said paper."
1298,There is actually no further information about this study that showed 85% of all male ivermectin patients became sterilised.
1299,Yet the journalist uses this as headline.
1300,"&gt; I hope dearly that when a more infectious and more deadly virus emerges, the world will be more ready for it as a result of our experience with sars-cov2."
1301,Nope.

1303,[removed]
1304,Might be able to get tested at CVS or Walgreens.
1305,Side note: one of my biggest fears is long term health impact on kids.
1306,Right now a lot of parents have kids in school and are dealing with clusters/quarantine and so on.
1307,But what about kids health down the road?
1308,How would we as parents feel if there is some ailment(s) caused by infection?
1309,What could we have done differently?
1310,"Well the obvious masks, but I think schools are not doing enough."
1311,Example my kids school everyone packed in cafeteria and extremely limited outdoor eating.
1312,That should not be the case.
1313,"Crowded hallways, parents sending sick kids to school."
1314,The list goes on.
1315,Ultimately how will we respond to our kids question if in  (x years) want to know why they have a covid related illness?
1316,Blame the school?
1317,Nope it's us

1324,"""Doing your part"" is what anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers are so against they'll get violent about it."
1325,I think a huge part depends on how sick people get when they‚Äôre infected.
1326,"Obviously break through infections can happen but as long as the people that get them aren‚Äôt getting hospitalized or die, they‚Äôre not going to go through shutting everything down again like last year."
1327,Of course unvaccinated people are the ones mostly dying from it now but whatever if they want to die on that hill.
1328,honestly idk if my mental health can take another lockdown like last year again.
1329,"I do feel bad for people with illnesses that can‚Äôt get vaccinated at this time, I can‚Äôt imagine how much anxiety I would have rn if that were me."
1330,"Biden had a press conference the same day celebrating the CDC's decision, telling Americans to ""take off their masks and smile""."
1331,"If the CDC was a disaster then, what is it now?"
1332,That treatment is 2 years in the making....any day now.
1333,I commend all the Americans who put aside their own opportunity for a vaccine so that some more deserving individuals get an opportunity at it.

1362,"That's 0.1% likely good of vaccinated people catching COVID per week right now, essentially 1% in ten weeks, or **5%** per year."
1363,"Not sure if there's any better data on breakthroughs right now (since no one seems interested in long COVID, and the CDC stopped tracking cases altogether back in May) but this seems to be okay news."
1364,"5% is still pretty high, and remember, there's still 50% of the original chance of getting long COVID, of course once you adjust for the lower chance of infection."
1365,"They also mention hospitalizations were reduced by 75% through vaccination, which is *very* different than the CDC's (IIRC?)"

1483,"Working in Australia we couldn‚Äôt unilaterally change someone‚Äôs place of work, hours of work, type of work if it would be considered unreasonable compared to their existing contract."
1484,"Reasonable is always a difficult definition, but if you tell someone who currently commutes 10 minutes that they now work an hour away, you‚Äôd probably be challenged on it."
1485,"If they already commute an hour away, and you move them another location still an hour away in another direction - you might get away with it."
1486,But the monoclonal antibodies were made with them.
1487,What if all the antivax stuff is a plot by the devil to get religious people straight to hell?

1491,"Same in Russia, 18k every single day, with no big changes whatever the day is... too much suspicious"
1492,"As classrooms around the country are forced into quarantine, the question is: will schools tighten precautions to prevent less infection, or will we simply start relaxing quarantine rules and other precautions, possibly putting kids at greater risk?"
1493,Here in PA my child's middle school states you do not need to quarantine if you share a classroom/bus with someone who test positive or presumed positive as long as you were wearing a mask

1495,Just got the notice to provide my vaccination status this week in my agency
1496,"My GF's work has given everyone a month, and if you don't have proof by then it is considered your resignation."
1497,I'm assuming that means they are going to make sure unemployment is denied.
1498,"Yep, to my best understanding what we really need is enough immunity through vaccination or infection that the average infected person infects fewer than 1 other person (ie R0 &lt; 1) so that the number of cases plummets."
1499,Global travel works against us with spreading variants but we also have much more sophisticated vaccine technology today than in 1918.
1500,I'm cautiously optimistic that Delta will be the last big boom of Covid in developed countries but we still need to get more vaccines in more people around the world ASAP.

1506,It's not as clear cut as that.

1508,"In fact, the only time I've seen it is when its some baptist minister from bumblefuck nowhere telling his flock that it's bad."
1509,Prior to covid it was a thing but it wasn't a widely cited objection.
1510,I know jehovahs witnesses got exemptions from flu vaccines pre covid but idk if that's their weird thing or derivative of the stem cell objection.
1511,Some of the more ultra sects of Orthodox jews have a thing about it but I think it's more about having collective ptsd from the holocaust than any religious justification.
1512,Scientologists in general are outright hostile to modern medicine in pretty much every form.
1513,Idk what their stance on vaccines are though.
1514,I'm sure there are others who take issue with it but I don't think there's any widespread mainstream categorical ban on getting vaccines
1515,Maybe long enough for Novavax to actually get something approved.

1524,"to be fair considering people with natural immunity + vaccinations is very high, roughly 85%(?)"
1525,"and yet the number(of hospitaliztion+death) is still high, the reality is that most countries will experience this delta strain ravaging stuff for a few months but it will go down to the very minor numbers soon."
1526,my 2 cents on the matter
1527,"Last night, my husband's co-worker died of covid."
1528,The last time they spoke with him he said his doctor told him to get vaccinated but he didn't get around to it.
1529,He told them it was too late for him but it wasn't too late for them.
1530,He begged them to get vaccinated.
1531,"When my husband's sister died of covid, just before the vaccine was released he (husband) told me he didn't know if it was necessary."
1532,His friends at work didn't think so.
1533,"I looked at him and said, ""I bet your sister would have taken it, if she had the chance."""
1534,He got vaccinated.
1535,Get vaccinated.

&gt;	In this study, we isolated for the first time the virus from the sample of the earliest positive patient and carried out a neutralization assay using the isolated virus soon after confirmation of its identity by WGS, and human sera collected between 10 and 20 days after the administration of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, which occurred 3 weeks after the first immunization."
1543,"All sera efficiently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.621 isolate (Figure 1C), demonstrating that this VOI is not a concern for vaccine efficacy."
1544,"Indeed, neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.621 was robust, even if significantly lower than that observed on SARS-CoV-2 B.1."
1545,"&gt;	Our data show that despite several mutations in Spike, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.621 is neutralized by the BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited antibodies."

1564,None of the 111 in hospital as of todays press conference have had 2 shots.
1565,Oh definitely.
1566,I worked for a local government office that regularly held public meetings and we often used to joke that our job was like Parks and Rec without the jokes.
1567,"From the article: 

""...330 out of 679 seriously ill patients were unvaccinated... 333 were fully vaccinated."""
1568,Is it really surprising that some folks continue to question the efficacy of covid vaccines?

1572,Texas is a shithole state that is against women‚Äôs rights.
1573,Not surprising that they treat their educators like shit as well.

1614,End of story.
1615,None of those numbers make any sense you‚Äôve provided though.
1616,10x the amount of people when there are often 45M cases of flu in a year means every single person in the U.S. gets Covid every year and many of them get it multiple times a year.

1629,Clinical trials typically do not include menstruating women in the studies.
1630,This would introduce variables that aren't controlled.
1631,"Like if a woman starts her period during the trial, or gets pregnant, then it would throw off the results."
1632,COVID vaccine trials were no different.
1633,"They either take menopausal women, or women who are on the pill."
1634,This leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
1635,"I agree, I was worried when I heard that vaccines were less effective than we thought because things weren't too good in Israel."

1653,Basically unless some mechanism that we don't know about happens -- at doses that we haven't actually tested people for as part of FDA regulation of this drug for antiparasitic purposes -- then there's no way for this drug to work as people hope it will work.

1818,"""Masks on kids are a health risk!"""
1819,"""What's your kid wearing for Halloween?"""
1820,Probably two Republican mommies.
1821,TBF nurse is such a wide covering catch all for a field that has extreme variance in training and knowledge.
1822,Lots of nurses have no more understanding of medicine than a oil rig worker knows about mechanical engineering.
1823,most of these ppl chose their fate.
1824,They don't even answer the phone at any GP type doctors office around here anymore.
1825,Or if they do they stick you on hold for 45 minutes or more.
1826,(it's a small town/county)  I needed to get my kid in for a strep test last week and couldn't get through to inquire about it at ANY doctor or urgent care in town.
1827,Nobody had appointments and the urgent cares had closed their lobbies because they were overwhelmed with people.
1828,"My only option was that quack by the grocery store that ""just diagnoses everything as the flu because all those tests are just so unreliable"" and hell will freeze over before I ever go to her for ANY medical help whatsoever."
1829,"I wouldn't trust her to pronounce me dead correctly lmao, she'd prolly fuck that up too."
1830,There's a reason she is the only doctor in the county with an empty office and an empty appointment book.
1831,(I don't know how that woman became a doctor and I don't know how she stays a doctor.)
1832,It's been like that for a while now here.
1833,I never did get that strep test.
1834,He got better on his own before I could.
1835,:/
1836,He is so much more brave than I am.
1837,"I really despise how anti-vaxxers demand to be heard, and how they grandstand about saving our children by making sure they don't wear masks, but then mock someone who also wants to share their own opinion."
1838,It just confirms how emotionally immature and egotistical most anti-mask anti-vaxxers are.
1839,And there‚Äôs a cigarette‚Ä¶ still burning
1840,Is there a reason you guys are saying 6 months?
1841,Last I heard they went back to making people wait 8 months.
1842,That's what my Doctor told my Dad when he asked about the booster this week.
1843,"&gt;	but they only get away with what people and govts allow, and govts only regulate what people demand be regulated."
1844,Because dark money convinces folks corps aren‚Äôt the real problem.
1845,legend
1846,"It's basic Media 101 that the adage ""If it bleeds, it leads"" is as true today as it ever was."
1847,Scary stories keep people tuned in/clicking headlines.
1848,"Sowing doubt about the effectiveness of the vaccines, even in an underhanded way, keeps folks on edge, keeps them wanting more stories/information, keeps folks tuning in."
1849,I'm fully vaccinated.
1850,I would have them regardless.
1851,But I also hate donating blood.
1852,I try and stay very athletic and every time I do donate I lift and run like shit for days or weeks.
1853,This was actually a theory or a question?
1854,I bled for 3 straight weeks while on birth control.
1855,"Took a week off to ""let my real period come""."
1856,It was the heaviest period I have experienced in ages.
1857,"But once it was over in 5 days, It was over."
1858,"I have been back to normal since, that was back in May."
1859,I may be wrong but I thought I heard that the summer is the worst time in the south for colds and stuff since it's so beyond hot everyone is inside for AC?
1860,I‚Äôm curious to know if there is a different makeup of the third shot than the second.
1861,"And if so, and if it creates more protection from Delta, why not make the third booster shot the second shot and the third one."
1862,Would not at all be surprising.
1863,"Of course this won't change the behaviour of any of those who are of the ""they died in a car accident and the coroner claimed it was COVID-19"", ""they didn't die of the COVID-19 they have, they died of bacterial pneumonia"", ""they were old"", ""they had pre-existing conditions"", ""everyone has to die sometime"", ""it's all a hoax"", ""my aunt on Facebook has a friend who is a nurse who says its all vaccinated people dying now"" mindset(s)."

1885,"As a nurse, she needs to get the fuck out of our profession."
1886,COVID does not always cause loss of smell/taste.

1889,Thank you for your response and all the information you've given me.
1890,"I shouldn't have to say this, but thank you for being kind
I don't like asking these questions, because people just call me an idiot."
1891,That and the ethical issues.
1892,"Before delta at least, a number of CDC/FDA people opposed boosters on ethical grounds."
1893,"Now they're ""coincidentally"" offering some after fulfilling the WHO-requested moratorium."
1894,"Of course if they admitted that factored into their feet dragging, it would be a shitstorm."
1895,"On the other hand, maybe some people would get them purely because they didn't want them going to developing nations."
1896,"I understand the argument but disagree; after sending out 100m, with hundreds of millions of more planned, forgoing boosters here when effectiveness against severe disease has dropped so much just to get them out to the rest of the world a few weeks faster isn't the ""morally superior"" course."
1897,You most likely tested too soon.
1898,Its best to test about 4-5 days from exposure or if symptoms show up sooner.
1899,I would not visit friends myself

1913,CDC needs to stop catering to those who still haven't been vaccinated when it's September.
1914,public health would benefit more from the vaccinated taking boosters than holding out for the single digit % who MIGHT get vaccinated at some point.
1915,No.
1916,Symptoms can vary widely from person to person.
1917,Loss of smell and taste is common but not universal.
1918,"&gt;So, to get herd immunity, you need 87% of all people (not just eligible people!)"
1919,to be vaccinated or otherwise immune.
1920,No country has gotten that.
1921,Do we know that for certain?
1922,"In the UK, where I'm from, the Office for National Statistics runs an [antibody survey](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/antibodies) which shows that more than 90% of the population have antibodies from either vaccination or past infection."
1923,"Cases are high and rising steadily (currently at ~2/3rd of the peak from January, when very few people had been vaccinated)."
1924,I don't see how that data could be consistent with the claim that we'll have herd immunity once 87% or more are vaccinated or otherwise immune.
1925,Apparently someone else thought you were full of shit too.
1926,I don‚Äôt upvote or downvote anything.
1927,\#1 Not unborn?

1929,"With the anti-mask and anti-vaxx rhetoric, nobody should be surprised."
1930,"&gt; That lasted for about 2 weeks, never fell very far, and now cases are back to 38,000 a day and still climbing."
1931,Their population is 65% vaccinated - the US population is only 53% vaccinated.
1932,It's not going to go as well for us as it is for them - and it is not going well for them.
1933,Thank you.
1934,"People desperately look for an out from this thing, a sign that it is almost over, but it is not on the horizon."
1935,"The fight is still far from over, and people are deluding themselves."
1936,Pick any other group of people.
1937,The LGBT community was just an example.
1938,Though in the 80's the HIV/AIDS epidemic might qualify.
1939,We don't allow companies to fire obese people for unduly straining the healthcare system when all they need to do is eat more salad and walk.
1940,And you'll have to explain to me how an unvaccinated flight attendant who wears a mask is putting vaccinated people also wearing a mask at risk?
1941,Don't masks work?
1942,Don't vaccines work?
1943,What am I missing?
1944,[removed]
1945,"USA is 5% of the world population, it's going to evolve at roughly the same speed regardless of what we do."
1946,"If you're fully vaccinated and have no symptoms, technically you should wait at least three days after exposure to be tested, and if negative you can leave quarantine."
1947,So you should still wear a mask in public and get re-tested tomorrow.
1948,"But honestly, you're probably fine, there is some room for error in these guidelines."
1949,"If you're not fully vaccinated, you should stay home for 14 days regardless of test results."

1955,"The honest answer is the virus is crazy contagious, and current vaccine efficiency - even if everyone was vaccinated - isn't enough to stop this."
1956,"Yeah, maybe."
1957,But they won't.
1958,"I should say many will, but a huge number won't, and never will--not even if Covid is literally killing them."

2049,"Yes, I appreciate it's incredibly rare (as are my chances of dying due to covid itself)."

2226,"We hosted a yearly one at my high school in Kentucky, and there'd always be at least one out of region school there who wanted a good competition."

2248,And since you know what they are saying - feel free to elaborate on what the ethics issues are.
2249,The very foundation of ethics in medicine is to give care to those who require it - people who have made the decision to not get the vaccine have made it clear that they do not believe they require care from medical experts.
2250,Yeah

2272,"Although, I know at least one in my group isn't vaxxed, a little worried for him."
2273,Does he need to justify the reason this is considered an emergency?
2274,"Because I can't think of a logical or humane end to the sentence ""If the kids are mandated to wear masks for even *one more day*, then _______"""
2275,&gt; A lot of the scientists I follow have a hunch that even those who *do* get long covid after vaccination likely don't have it as long or as severely as unvaccinated.
2276,I'm hoping this is true!
2277,I'd love for vaccination to reduce the severity of long COVID as well.
2278,Only a small fraction of under 12s will end up being vaccinated.

2286,"No nonsense with how long a solar day is on a given planet, it's just a bit over 80 kiloseconds."
2287,This was in part due to computer systems marking time in seconds-from-epoch.
2288,"One of the characters is puzzled why the epoch seemed to be 1970-01-01 and not 1969-07-16, which humanity left Earth for the first time."

2915,You can read the PDF of a letter to the editor that [discusses the paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404744/pdf/BCP-9999-na.pdf).
2916,"This paragraph is (probably) the meaty part:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While the findings by Caly and colleagues provide some promise,several pharmacokinetic factors limit the immediate translation oftheir findings, and there is no evidence that the 5ŒºM concentration ofivermectin used by Caly and colleagues in their in vitro SARS-CoV-2experiment, can be achieved in vivo."
2917,"First, the pharmacokinetics ofivermectin in humans is well described,3‚Äì5 and even with the highestreported dose of approximately 1700 Œºg/kg (i.e., 8.5 times the FDA -approved dose of 200 Œºg/kg), the maximum plasma concentration was only 0.28ŒºM.5 Second, 93% of ivermectin is bound to plasma proteins that limit its cellular uptake by endothelial cells.6 Considering both the total plasma concentration and protein binding, the freeplasma concentration of ivermectin would be 250 times lower thanthe concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2in vitro (Figure 1)."
2918,"Third, whilst there is no data on the tissue penetration of ivermectin in human lungs, the total concentration of ivermectin in calves injected with 200 Œºg/kg reached only 100 ng/g (approx.0.1ŒºM) in lung tissue, which suggests that its accumulation would notbe sufficient to achieve the antiviral effect with conventional doses.7 **Although high doses of ivermectin in adults or children are well tolerated,5,8 the clinical effects of ivermectin at a concentration of5ŒºM range are unknown and may be associated with toxicity."
2919,"** **Consequently, ivermectin has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but this effect is unlikely to be observed in vivo using current dosing**

Let me simplify what i have repeatedly stated which is true and even your article touches on and confirms."
3020,Replication errors are random.
3021,Mutations are formed from these replication errors.
3022,Mutations become prevalent when one of their mutations allows for it to out compete other variants.
3023,The mutation and extinction event you reference was sited in march 2020 and was pre vaccines and pre natual immunity.

3025,I also dont care if dont agree with the article you linked which clearly backs up what i'm saying.
3026,You keep saying you base everything on your primary source yet you clearly don't comprehend what the article you link says.
3027,"""""The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020."
3028,...
3029,"The extinction of the earliest partitions, 1 and 2, corresponds to the advent of S|D614G, which became fixed in all other partitions and was globally ubiquitous by June 2020 """" 

You stated above ""There was a diversification of mutations followed by the emergence of the D614G structure in the spike protein after an extinction event due to the vaccine."""
3030,which is not true as vaccines where in early stage trials.
3031,"""The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection."""

3049,"I‚Äôm glad you read all that primary source though, it will help you for sure."
3050,I just read the abstract because i don‚Äôt care that much lol.
3051,I‚Äôm not trying to reconfigure my current covid knowledge base so I won‚Äôt be reading all that just to win a stupid argument.
3052,"I will once they have actually primary data on the mu variant, however."
3053,"But to argue against wikipedia doctors, nah."
3054,I think that not even Prince Philip Movement forbid vaccines
3055,In a city that is unable have classes outdoor or setup portables.

3061,That's awful!
3062,I've been getting multiple emails every day about new positive cases in my daughter's school district.
3063,"Now that masks are required in my state, nobody is considered a ""close contact"" (unmasked within 6 feet for 15+ minutes) so I wouldn't be notified specifically regarding my daughter's exposure, but they do let us know which building the positive students attend and the last day they were in school."
3064,Are you on an ICS or other med that makes you prone to respiratory infections?
3065,Have you had your pneumonia vaccination?
3066,"If no, get it."
3067,"Are you in an area where covid is raging, or in an area with a high vaccination rate where people willingly mask and distance?"
3068,I take an ICS and caught it while wearing an N95.
3069,"If you‚Äôd in a high transmission area, I‚Äôd stay home as much as possible."
3070,"If you catch it, ask for monoclonal antibodies the day you find out."
3071,(Asthma should qualify you.)

3080,"If you fail to acknowledge the differences between obesity and vaccine refusal, feel free to continue being obtuse I guess."
3081,"Also would love the stats to back up your comment that ""most"" of the people taking up hospital beds are obese."
3082,"We all know that Covid hits the obese harder, that's old news."
3083,But not real sure there is data to back up your attitude that there wouldn't be any Covid patients left if no one was obese.
3084,What the stats do show us over and over again is that the common thread between the hospitalized is that they're overwhelmingly unvaccinated.
3085,A timeline on when we can vaccinate our kids would be super nice now‚Ä¶
3086,you fucking responded to me.. how am i cross referencing your posts when we are in the same thread about this shit..
3087,"If it‚Äôs never happened to an individual and it‚Äôs not told that it can happen, it‚Äôs an unexpected outcome."
3088,"If a woman had taken vaccines all her life and it‚Äôs never messed up a period before, we need to understand do the why, and then more importantly communicate that."
3089,"Small sects of small sects, and most of them have exemptions"
3090,Those who can't get vaccinated are on their own?
3091,"&gt;Universities are caught between the demands of their faculty for greater safety precautions, and the fear of losing students, and the revenue they bring, if schools return to another year of online education."
3092,"‚ÄúI think everybody agrees that the idea is to have people physically back in the classroom,‚Äù said Peter McDonough,  general counsel for the American Council on Education, an organization of colleges and universities."
3093,"‚ÄúThe turning on a dime to provide online education last year and the previous spring semester was only seen as temporary.‚Äù  
  
For some faculty, the new year brings not a return to normal but a strong sense that things could go off the rails."
3094,"In the first weeks of class, case counts have risen at schools including Duke, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Arizona State, Liberty University, the University of Arkansas, the University of North Florida and the University of Texas at San Antonio."
3095,"‚ÄúIt seems like a repeat,‚Äù said Michael Atzmon, an engineering professor at the University of Michigan."
3096,"‚ÄúOn the one hand, we have the vaccine."
3097,"On the other hand, we have Delta.‚Äù  
  
Dr. Atzmon helped organize a petition asking the university to be more open to online teaching."
3098,It was signed by more than 700 faculty members and instructors.
3099,"In a response to the petition, Michigan‚Äôs president, Mark Schlissel, said on Thursday that, given the ‚Äústellar‚Äù rate of vaccination at the Ann Arbor campus (92 percent for students, 90 percent for faculty), the classroom was ‚Äúperhaps the safest place to be‚Äù on campus."
3100,Dr. Schlissel suggested that faculty would just have to get used to the idea that there would be Covid cases on campus.
3101,"‚ÄúA pandemic is unsettling, it‚Äôs unpredictable, and yes, it involves an unavoidable level of risk,‚Äù he said."
3102,There are signs of defiance against state policies.
3103,"The three big public universities in Arizona ‚Äî University of Arizona, Arizona State and Northern Arizona University ‚Äî are tiptoeing around the ban on masks and requiring them in class."
3104,"If all students have to wear masks, university officials believe that they are obeying Gov."
3105,Doug Ducey‚Äôs order not to discriminate against students who choose not to be vaccinated.
3106,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of a cat-and-mouse game,‚Äù said Peter Lake, an education law professor at Stetson University."
3107,"Professors said that Delta blindsided them, like much of the world."
3108,"They enthusiastically signed up to teach in-person classes in March, they said, before reports of breakthrough infections of vaccinated people became common."
3109,"Now their institutions are making it hard, if not impossible, for them to back out."
3110,A few have sacrificed their jobs.
3111,"Cody Luedtke, a biology instructor and lab coordinator at Perimeter College, part of Georgia State University, said she cried at the thought of teaching in a classroom where masks were not required."
3112,"When she refused to teach, she was fired, she said."
3113,"‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt perform a job duty that went against my morals and my desire to protect my students and the broader community,‚Äù she said."
3114,"Irwin Bernstein, an 88-year-old psychology professor, said the University of Georgia had lured him out of retirement this fall."
3115,"But when he posted a ‚ÄúNo mask, No class‚Äù sign in his classroom, his department head told him to take it down ‚Äúsince I was in violation of the governor‚Äôs order.‚Äù  
  
At his next class, a student resisted wearing a mask, saying it was uncomfortable, he recalled."
3116,He announced that he was retiring ‚Äî again ‚Äî and walked out of class.
3117,"Timothy Wilson, an engineering professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, resigned on the first day of class, revealing in an online essay that he was H.I.V.-positive and thought the university‚Äôs optional mask policy was ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù  
  
James Tierney, an assistant teaching professor of economics at Penn State, said that he supported the school‚Äôs mask mandate, but said that it was hard to hear students asking questions under their face coverings in his 600-student introductory class in macroeconomics."
3118,"And when students let their masks slip down their faces, ‚ÄúI have to play the bad guy,‚Äù he said."
3119,"But the university‚Äôs reluctance to impose a vaccine mandate was ‚Äúthe tipping point,‚Äù he said."
3120,"He resigned in protest, effective Dec. 31, to give the school time to find a replacement."
3121,Professors say that the lack of clear rules this year has made it harder to function.
3122,"Last year, the rules may have been draconian ‚Äî possible expulsion for attending parties, for instance ‚Äî but they were also clear and effective, the professors said."
3123,"Last fall, ‚ÄúI could call the police if I wanted to,‚Äù said Leslie Kaplan, who teaches folklore at the University of North Florida."
3124,"This year, she has to use the art of persuasion."
3125,"To prepare for discussing Covid at freshman orientation, Dr. Kaplan read two books about how to influence people."
3126,She brought in a recent graduate who had the virus and an epidemiologist.
3127,"She talked about the importance of looking out for one another, and implored students to put their political differences aside."
3128,"Only a handful of students came to her freshman orientation sessions unmasked, Dr. Kaplan said, and she credited her campaign."
3129,Others have suggested more tangible inducements.
3130,"The University of Texas at Austin told professors that they could offer nonacademic rewards, like cookies, to cajole students to wear masks."
3131,"(A university spokeswoman, Eliska Padilla, said this was informal, not an incentive program.)"
3132,"Despite the emotional appeals and subtle hints, some students do their own thing."
3133,"Alex Vargas, a senior at the University of Texas, is not vaccinated and, in the first week of school, he was the only person not wearing a mask in his small engineering class."
3134,"The professor, who was wearing a mask, called for a vote in class on whether students wanted him to wear a mask or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt care,‚Äù Mr. Vargas recalled."
3135,"The ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt cares‚Äù won by a vote or two, and the professor said he would keep his mask on, Mr. Vargas said."
3136,"‚ÄúThere were no snarky remarks, no ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to talk to you, not going to look at you,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Vargas, the chairman of the Young Conservatives of Texas on campus, said, of his own choice to go unmasked."
3137,"‚ÄúIt was just, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs his choice, move on.‚Äô‚Äù"

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Matthew Boedy, an associate professor of rhetoric and composition, sent out a raw emotional appeal to his students at the University of North Georgia just before classes began: The Covid-19 Delta variant was rampaging through the state, filling up hospital beds."
3140,He would teach class in the equivalent of full body armor ‚Äî vaccinated and masked.
3141,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So he was stunned in late August when more than two-thirds of the first-year students in his writing class did not take the hint and showed up unmasked."
3142,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It was impossible to tell who was vaccinated and who was not."
3143,"‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a visual hellscape, like hospitals, it‚Äôs more of an emotional hellscape,‚Äù Dr. Boedy said."
3144,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;North Georgia is not requiring its students to be vaccinated or masked this fall."
3145,"And as in-person classes return at almost every university in the country, after almost a year and a half of emergency pivoting to online learning, many professors are finding teaching a nerve-racking experience."
3146,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The American College Health Association recommends vaccination requirements for all on-campus higher education students for the fall semester."
3147,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends face coverings, regardless of vaccine status, for indoor public spaces in areas where the rate of infection is high."
3148,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not how it has worked out on more than a few campuses."
3149,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;More than 1,000 colleges and universities have adopted vaccination requirements for at least some students and staff, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education."
3150,"In an indication of how political vaccination has become, the schools tend to be clustered in states that voted for President Biden in the last election."
3151,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But at some campuses, particularly in Republican-led states with high rates of contagion ‚Äî like the state systems in Georgia, Texas and Florida ‚Äî vaccination is optional and mask wearing, while recommended, cannot be enforced."
3152,"Professors are told they can tell students that they are ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù or ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to put on masks, but cannot force students to do so."
3153,And teachers cannot ask students who have Covid-like symptoms to leave the classroom.
3154,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At least nine states ‚Äî Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Tennessee ‚Äî have banned or restricted school mask mandates."
3155,"It is unclear, education officials say, whether all of these prohibitions apply to universities, but public universities depend on state funding."
3156,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Certainly, some professors are happy to go maskless."
3157,A smattering have resigned in protest over optional mask policies.
3158,"Most, like Dr. Boedy, are soldiering on."
3159,"But the level of fear is so high that even at universities that do require vaccination and masks, like Cornell and the University of Michigan, professors have signed petitions asking for the choice to return to online teaching."
3160,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúMorale is at an all-time low,‚Äù warns a petition at the University of Iowa."
3161,Continued in reply:
3162,"Chiming in, I got my second dose ~3-4 months ago, all of my periods since have been on completely random days."
3163,"One came 2 weeks early, the next 3 weeks late."
3164,I was not sexually active.
3165,"I was freaking out for a bit as I have PCOS, but was never irregular, periods just sucked."
3166,This last one kept me in bed for 5 days.
3167,For reference - I‚Äôm 30.
3168,Edit: with Moderna.
3169,Dude.
3170,This gutted me.
3171,I watched the video of someone wailing in the background and at the time it had been two days without an update.
3172,I had been looking for her account and couldn‚Äôt find it.
3173,Damn.
3174,&gt;how an anti-parasitic can improve a viral problem?
3175,"Lots of medications have effects vastly outside their intended or understood scope, ambien for example which is used to treat insomnia being one of the most dramatic in being able to temporarily bring people out of a vegetative state:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTFicgrVk0w

As for ivermectin nobody knows, all we do know is that it works in vitro but lots of stuff work in vitro and then fail in humans."
3176,Caffeine for example is an amazing and highly effective killer of cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone but only when done in a test tube.
3177,Unfortunately it doesn't do much in vivo.
3178,"I have no opinion on ivermectin, was just answering your questions on where this all came from"
3179,It's constructive dismissal and will be considered the same in a discrimination suit.
3180,Get rid of that pesky government red tape and it might.
3181,Depends on the ethnicity.
3182,It's the old the virus will die if poisoned.
3183,The problem is that poisoning the host is likely lethal.

3185,"It's ""constructive dismissal."""
3186,Which is the same thing in a discrimination suit.
3187,Expect a reversal from United.
3188,"If it's not in-person classes that shut down colleges and universities, it'll probably be the football games."
3189,Lol you must be seething to really go back and cross reference all my comments.
3190,"If they're not mandating vaccines, doesn't seem like they have much left available."
3191,"Comparing the obese, alcoholics, etc (complex life long behaviors that often have a component of physical addiction) to people who have made a willfully ignorant choice not to take 5 minutes out of their day to get a safe and free vaccine just doesn't hold up."
3192,"Not only are the two not the same, you're trying to diminish my argument to ""only human beings in good health deserve medical care"" which is monstrous."
3193,This is bummy
3194,"I'm a big fan of more study on pretty much everything, regardless of whether we are talking covid or not."
3195,So I'm down for them to do some investigation of this.
3196,I hope that it fans the flame of actually changing how women are treated medically and in the science world.
3197,"But as a period having human, I'd like to mention that ANYTHING can fuck up the cycle."
3198,"Vaccines, because of the immune response, do for some people but not for others."
3199,"While we are all generally the same, we have tons and tons of differences."
3200,What impacts some won't play out the same in others.
3201,STRESS impacts our cycles- it can make the periods come faster!
3202,but also it can make the periods come late!
3203,"Also, there is a running joke(?)"
3204,"about periods syncing up (I listed it as a joke because we joke about it, but I'm unsure of whether studies have been done or how well they're even be able to test it)."
3205,"Pheromones', hormones, etc."
3206,they impact us/others.
3207,The body is hecking WILD.
3208,"My point is, it's definitely happened previously with vaccines."
3209,It's not really an unexpected outcome.
3210,Just kind of unexpected for certain groups of people.
3211,"COVID is much more controversial/political, plus the spread of the internet, and other factors have changed the way things are playing out tremendously."
3212,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, stay mostly at home, and rarely go inside anywhere."
3213,Last month I had to go in somewhere.
3214,"While I was wearing a N95 mask, I was the only one masked."
3215,I‚Äôm in an area full of anti-vax/anti-mask loons.
3216,"Our breakthrough cases since February 2021 are 10%, breakthrough hospitalizations are 8.47%, and breakthrough deaths are 9.96% (per Hutchinson‚Äôs presser today)."
3217,Breakthrough active cases were &gt;14% as of 2-3 weeks ago.
3218,"I keep windows open as much as possible at home, and keep 1 fan per 1,000sf running on low 24/7 with a heavy duty filter strapped to it."
3219,"We wore masks at home for 2 long weeks, and ate separately."
3220,(We did not do as the CDC recommends and use separate glasses/plates/silverware.)
3221,I didn‚Äôt pass it on.
3222,I know several in my area who are vaccinated + consistently mask/distance and have caught it.
3223,It‚Äôs not that rare here.
3224,Fleeting contact is all the Delta variant needs.
3225,"If you‚Äôre in an area with reasonable people who mask and social distance + high vaccination rates, then your chances of catching covid are much less than mine in an area where covid is raging."
3226,Wtf?
3227,I love Capitalism now!

3233,You went from saying viruses go through natural selection and when you realized that shit is stupid you finally send me a remotely related primary source on something as broad as mutation.

3244,"&gt;	In economics, stagflation or recession-inflation is a situation in which the inflation rate is high, the economic growth rate slows, and unemployment remains steadily high."
3245,"It presents a dilemma for economic policy, since actions intended to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment."
3246,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation
3247,"&gt;&gt; As of August 21, the Health Ministry recorded 215.9 severe COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people among the unvaccinated over the age of 60, compared to 21 per 100,000 people among those who had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine."
3248,This makes unvaccinated older people more than 10 times as likely to experience a severe case as their immunized counterparts.
3249,"Because vaccinated people are in much higher risk groups, it skews the numbers."
3250,Vaccinated people have significantly higher protection when compared to people with similar risk factors.

3269,All 3 had fetal cells used either in testing or manufacture.
3270,"All have also been declared moral and ethical by the Catholic and Baptist churches so this ""religious exemption"" is BS."
3271,"For Moderna and Phizer:

&gt;The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna do not require the use of any fetal cell
cultures in order to manufacture (produce) the vaccine."
3272,"&gt;Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology, fetal cells were used for ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) or to
characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

For JNJ:

&gt;The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson did require the use of fetal
cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the vaccine."
3273,"However:

&gt;The Catholic
Church and the Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission have both stated that receiving
a COVID-19 vaccine that required fetal cell lines for production or manufacture is morally
acceptable."

3280,Not saying it's not still transmitted.
3281,"&gt;""These reduced viral loads hint at a potentially lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine effect on virus spread."""
3282,Not saying it's not still transmitted.
3283,Also fails to take into account the 70% who were still unvaccinated at the time.
3284,Vaccines don't work for the entirety of society if only 30% of people have them.
3285,This is basic 7th grade science.
3286,We were barely at 30% vaccination nationwide when the guidance was lifted.
3287,The science absolutely did not support the conclusions the CDC made at the time.
3288,So the only misinformation was you claiming that the science did not show the vaccinated still transmitted and the article you provided disagrees with the statement you made to go along with it.
3289,This year's RSV is on steroids.

3300,It sounds like you believe COVID zero is possible which I strongly disagree with.
3301,I think basically every epidemiologist on earth would say it is endemic at this point and just going to be a part of our lives.
3302,"When surges happen, we certainly should be careful but the reality is if vaccinated people aren't clogging up ICU beds, they should be able to live their lives."
3303,"As information changes, I'm also more than willing to adjust my life."
3304,"However, saying that 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 of even contracting COVID with mild symptoms is 'too high' is pretty absurd to me."
3305,I'd really like to emphasize that the whole reason COVID is actually a problem is because it cripples our hospital infrastructure.
3306,I also think this viewpoint is very narrow minded in that it completely disregards how serious the consequences are for continuing to live in such a restricted way.
3307,I think that the vaccine is by far the most important aspect of living normally and that the epidemiologists are in agreement.
3308,"I'm 100% for requiring proof of vaccination and I feel grateful that where I live this is a requirement in bars, restaurants, and venues and there are mask mandates on our subways."

3468,"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-coronavirus-vaccine-could-take-way-longer-than-a-year

That's a bit different from the fastest time a vaccine has been created and then used."
3469,"For example, the flu virus was isolated in like 1933 or so, but the first vaccine (to be widely deployed) wasn't created until 1942."
3470,While they were certainly researching the virus and how to create a vaccine like that - that's basic R&amp;D. It isn't anything specific to a particular vaccine.
3471,"In that case, that would push us back to 2003 for the COVID vaccines (research started with SARS, which is a different strain but very very similar)."
3472,"If we go by a specific vaccine, 1942 to 1943/1945 and late 1952 to early 1954 would be faster."
3473,I also emailed National Geographic to make sure I was correct on their assumptions.
3474,Did you all get tested?
3475,If this hasn‚Äôt happened to someone before with vaccines this would be an unexpected outcome.

3567,"&gt;	However, vaccinated people with Delta might remain infectious for a shorter period, according to researchers in Singapore who tracked viral loads for each day of COVID-19 infection among people who had and hadn‚Äôt been vaccinated."

3569,"‚ÄúGiven the high virus levels seen in the first week of illness with Delta, measures such as masks and hand hygiene which can reduce transmission are important for everyone, regardless of vaccination status,‚Äù says co-author Barnaby Young, an infectious-disease clinician at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore."
3570,"&gt;One massive analysis of Delta transmission comes from the UK REACT-1 programme, led by a team at Imperial College London, which tests more than 100,000 UK volunteers every few weeks."
3571,"The team ran Ct analyses for samples received in May, June and July, when Delta was rapidly replacing other variants to become the dominant driver of COVID-19 in the country."
3572,"The results suggested that among people testing positive, those who had been vaccinated had a lower viral load on average than did unvaccinated people."
3573,"Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial, says that these results differ from other Ct studies because this study sampled the population at random and included people who tested positive without showing symptoms."
3574,"&gt;These findings ‚Äî along with an increase in cases in younger people who have not yet received both jabs ‚Äî underscore the effectiveness of double vaccination against Delta, Elliott says."

3815,"Are people waiting until they have Covid to take the Ivermectin, or is it taken prophylactically?"
3816,"&gt;The Los Angeles Board of Education has scheduled a meeting Thursday to vote on a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for eligible students, an action likely to be approved as a majority of board members already have said that they either favor or are leaning toward such a requirement."
3817,"&gt;The special meeting was posted shortly after the school board emerged from a closed session Wednesday for which the only listed item was ‚Äúanticipated litigation.‚Äù

&gt;The nation‚Äôs second-largest school system has been sued multiple times over its COVID-safety measures, which are among the most strict and sweeping in the nation."
3818,"A vaccine mandate also could bring a lawsuit, district officials have acknowledged to The Times."
3819,"&gt;To date, none of the litigation has thwarted L.A. Unified from such steps as ordering all students and employees to be tested each week for the coronavirus and requiring all employees to be vaccinated."
3820,&gt;The board would not likely have approved a special meeting over a vaccine mandate if it wasn‚Äôt clear that the board would approve it.
3821,"The board has yet to discuss a vaccine mandate in open session, but it has apparently come up in at least two closed sessions, according to district sources."
3822,&gt;A district statement on Wednesday foreshadowed likely approval: ‚ÄúThe Los Angeles Unified Board of Education will vote at their next meeting on whether to mandate vaccines for all eligible students.
3823,Science clearly shows that vaccinations are an essential part of protecting our communities.
3824,"Further details will be forthcoming after the vote.‚Äù

&gt;School board member Nick Melvoin on Wednesday left no doubt where he stands."
3825,"&gt;‚ÄúOur goal is to keep kids and teachers as safe as possible and in the classroom,‚Äù Melvoin said."
3826,‚ÄúA medical and scientific consensus has emerged that the best way to protect everyone in our schools and communities is for all those who are eligible to get vaccinated.
3827,"This policy is the best way to make that happen.‚Äù

&gt;Melvoin also has noted ‚Äúinaction at the state level‚Äù as a reason for L.A. Unified to to take action on its own."
3828,"&gt;Education officials across the state are beginning to grapple with mandating student COVID vaccination, a measure that could help prevent school infections and keep classrooms open, but would probably ignite pushback."
3829,"&gt;School board President Kelly Gonez said last week that such a mandate would be a wise step to take ‚Äúwithin a reasonable timeline.‚Äù Although the board could make a student vaccine mandate decision relatively soon, its effective date would depend on many factors, including allowing time for education efforts and outreach to families, she said."
3830,&gt;Such a move would propel Los Angeles ‚Äî once again ‚Äî into the national spotlight for COVID safety measures that are among the most aggressive in the country.
3831,"The nation‚Äôs second-largest school system has moved faster and more comprehensively than most others, testing all students and employees for infection every week, requiring masks indoors and outdoors and ordering employees to get vaccinated."
3832,"&gt;The district has won praise for creating a safer learning environment, but also faced criticism for rules that have led to disruptive quarantines, which have hindered efforts to make up for in-person learning time lost when campuses were closed for more than a year."
3833,"&gt;People 12 and older have been eligible, under a federal emergency authorization, to receive the vaccine in L.A. County for nearly four months, but many have not."
3834,"As of Aug. 29, 48% of county residents 12 to 15 years old and 57% of residents ages 16 to 17 were fully vaccinated."
3835,"In the 12-to-17 age group, hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among the unvaccinated than among the fully vaccinated, according to research highlighted this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
3836,"&gt;Already, the L.A. teachers union has voiced strong support for a student vaccine mandate ‚Äî and is negotiating for tighter quarantine rules."
3837,"&gt;The district‚Äôs previous safety mandates, including coronavirus testing and employee vaccinations, already have faced legal challenges."
3838,"So far, the litigation has added to district costs, but not stopped or delayed these policies."
3839,"The public testimony at nearly every board meeting has included lengthy stretches during which anti-vaccine parents implore officials to not, as they put it, place their children at grave risk by giving them vaccinations."
3840,Some parents also assert a legal right to make such choices for themselves.
3841,"&gt;Other districts have faced repeated protests over mandates to wear masks, let alone submit to vaccines."
3842,"Indoor masks at schools are a state requirement, but governors of some states, including Texas and Florida, have refused to allow school systems to mandate face coverings, with the issue going to court."
3843,"&gt;So far, Culver City Unified appears to be the only state school system to have approved a student vaccine mandate, and it has yet to take effect."
3844,That district has set a Nov. 19 deadline in the expectation that the vaccine will have received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration by then for students 12 and older.
3845,The Oakland Board of Education is scheduled to discuss a student vaccine mandate on Wednesday.
3846,"&gt;In Los Angeles, one major player, United Teachers Los Angeles, which represents more than 30,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians ‚Äî has already weighed in."
3847,"In late August, union negotiators demanded mandatory vaccinations for eligible students in a contract proposal."
3848,"Days later, the union dropped the demand ‚Äî after the district refused to make it part of bargaining."
3849,"&gt;California school districts have clear authority to act if they want to, said Debra Duardo, superintendent of the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which provides support and oversight for the county‚Äôs 80 K-12 districts."
3850,"&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve mandated other vaccinations, as you know,‚Äù Duardo said, mentioning the polio vaccine and the Tdap, which provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis."

4544,You getting covid was Essentially your booster.
4545,I‚Äôd honeslty consult your PCP before you go and get a booster.
4546,As if I recall those who had covid and then got the shot had way way better immunity then those with just covid or just the vaccine.
4547,i didn't know they were even trained for this.
4548,or is the plan to shoot covid?
4549,"&gt;The patient most likely to survive is going to be the vaccinated one

You have to be dishonest to not see here that you just made a blanket statement with no nuance whatsoever."

4564,"I already lost more than 1 entire year of college due to COVID, and now, as a college senior, I am not gonna let it happen to me anymore."
4565,"I have received both doses of my vaccine so I don't deserve to waste anymore of my college tenure in online classes and missing out on fun, friendships, hobbies, and life outside of my work or studies."

4583,"I mean ignoring that confounding factors make it likely more than 4, I think 4 X is a huge factor of safety provided by something with an extremely good safety profile made tested and released in 9 months."
4584,The Israel covid dashboard basically shows 3-4 X less likely to be hospitalized for the vaccinated adjusted for population of Vax vs unvax.
4585,"If it helps, a third dose (for over 60s) makes it more like 24x less likely to be hospitalized, so get that if you're worried."
4586,"You can have a look on the Israel covid dashboard, great for looking at the differences adjusted for population."
4587,Why would common sense override the will of a higher power?
4588,What are the laws of a king to the laws of a god?
4589,I would not take that for granted.
4590,Legal counsel for the city of portland advised that the governmental order in place did not allow them to mandate vaccines for city of portland police.
4591,So they did not mandate it for them.

The article specifically used the flu as a comparison which is widely known to have a wicked mutation rate and it‚Äôs not much of a leap to think that‚Äôs what the title is implying."

4610,"Last year at this time:

* Israel had a coronavirus surge (peaked sept 26)
* denmark had basically no covid early sept 2020

This year, Israel had a surge, Denmark‚Äòs cases also comparatively low."
4611,"However, you compare to last year, every metric is worse in both countries."
4612,"In Denmark:

* Cases 3x worse
* Deaths are 2 per day vs. 0 per day."
4613,"Can‚Äôt do a multiplier cause there were none last year lol
* Test positivity rate is 1.2% vs. 0.5%
* Hospitalizations are 6.5x worse
* ICU is 6.5x worse

Respiratory viruses are seasonal."
4614,"It is reasonable to expect Denmark‚Äôs waves will follow an annual pattern, just like Israel and Florida‚Äôs waves have followed an annual pattern."
4615,"In a northern country like Denmark, summer is not the time to declare victory!"
4616,"If you make it through winter, \*then\* you can brag."
4617,"But right now I‚Äôm seeing all of your stats being worse year on year, with no obvious decrease in hospitalizations per case."
4618,$1.6 million will just about cover photocopies for a clinical study.
4619,"Lol, good catch."
4620,"You're right, it is."
4621,Covid stay costs are on par with kidney transplants?
4622,And a heart attack is like a third of that?
4623,"I mean, looks like somebody accidentaly opened a can of worms and exposed highly inflated prices because ""it's a global pandemic, no expense spared!"
4624,"we might as well capitalise on that"""
4625,"Sounds good, but ONE person with Delta lead to over 800 infections."
4626,We can't let a single case slip through or we're screwed all over again.
4627,Our medical infrastructure wouldn't be able to cope with a mass infection.
4628,"Well, Christian Scientists don't believe in using medicine, so I would say Christian Science would exempt you from the vaccine."
4629,And there are definitely evengelical Christian sects that are based on faith healing that avoid medication.
4630,An examination of some legal decisions: https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/908/blood-transfusions-and-medical-care-against-religious-beliefs.
4631,Are they going to do something about fake vaccine cards?
4632,Exactly.
4633,Apparently in the vaccine trials it didn't even occur to anyone to ask the participating pre-menopausal women any questions about their menstrual cycle!
4634,The only thing they cared about was  pregnancy.
4635,"Sharp rises and drops are sign of good, what worries me governments reporting same numbers everyday, psychological ceiling numbers"

4640,"&gt; I sign this document under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct, and that I am the person named below."
4641,I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (18 U.S.C.
4642,1001).
4643,Checking ‚ÄúI decline to respond‚Äù does not constitute a false statement.
4644,"I understand that if I am a Federal employee or contractor making a false statement on this form could result in additional administrative action, including an adverse personnel action up to and including removal from my position or removal from a contract."
4645,[removed]
4646,I‚Äôm not disputing that nor am I disputing the fact that a business reserves the right to deny someone service if they‚Äôre not vaccinated.
4647,Flipping the coin I‚Äôm sure that same business will have no choice but to accept the revenue loss for choosing not to service the unvaccinated.
4648,"Same here, after my first dose but not the second as well."
4649,"I got Moderna, not Pfizer though."

4661,&gt; A pandemic (or possibly endemic) will end when it mutates to the point where it is no longer harmful.
4662,That‚Äôs really not a thing.
4663,Viruses don‚Äôt inevitably mutate to become less harmful.
4664,Delta is more than twice as likely to lead to hospitalization according to some broad studies.
4665,"What I think you meant, was once immunity levels are high enough in the population, infections no longer lead to hospitalization and death."
4666,But that‚Äôs assuming that immunity is long lasting and protects partially against future strains.
4667,"They typically are, though‚Ä¶"
4668,"Tide comes in, tide goes out."
4669,You can't explain that.
4670,Wouldn't it be a surreal plot twist if the vaccines made women super fertile.
4671,That would be an unblockable move for the anti vaxxers.
4672,Having a random week with no covid patients is perfectly possible.
4673,However if someone says their ward is full of covid patients and they are all vaccinated I'd look for the salt packet.
4674,The only way this is likely to happen is if you were in an area with 100% vaccinated people.
4675,In any other location the majority of people catching covid will be unvaccinated.
4676,They are going to be sicker than someone the same age who is vaccinated and more likely to end up in hospital.
4677,"And this unvaccinated ""nurse"" might well be one of them."
4678,It's not impossible but it isnt very likely.
4679,It's also possible to get bad reactions to the vaccine - but your risk of doing so is considerably less than the risk of getting the same sort of problem from covid.
4680,"Life isnt risk free, sensible people choose the smaller risk."
4681,"Delta is very infectious, if unvaccinated you are unlikely to evade it."
4682,I had way more clots than usual and they were much larger.
4683,Same here after my first dose.
4684,I even almost passed out a few times.

4696,"What about children, people who've been advised they shouldn't get vaccinated, people with severe needle phobia etc?"
4697,I'm in no way anti vax and got mine months ago but big corporations being free to build a two tiered society isn't something I see as a positive
4698,"Congrats, I hope you and yours stay safe and well."

4700,It warms my heart to see comments like this.
4701,"Too many people are just saying ""a kid died in the news!"""

4703,I have a friend who refuses to send their kid to daycare until kids can be vaccinated.
4704,However they're installing a pool.
4705,I tried telling her that statistically speaking the pool is far more likely to kill her child than Covid.
4706,"Bottom line, living is the number one cause of death."
4707,It's all about managing risk.
4708,I sadly thing this is false.
4709,What individuals do matters very little to bring about a solution.

4723,The total NUMBER (per capita) of vaccinated people getting hospitalized is lower than the US - and that's the thing you want to keep an eye on because it shows if the vaccines are still working or not.
4724,"&gt; would potentially suffer negative consequences

feck, I didn't think of that."
4725,I blame waking up too early and not at all on me being short sighted and kinda dumb.
4726,I'm just so annoyed at these assholes putting people at greater risk by pretending they're vaccinated.
4727,Sounds like a good system to me!
4728,"It's a myth that periods ""sync up""."

4740,A pandemic (or possibly endemic) will end when it mutates to the point where it is no longer harmful.
4741,Wikipedia suggests that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic lasted ~26 months.
4742,We are ~20 months into this event.
4743,Am I telling you that we have 6 months to go ?
4744,"No, because humanity is much more mobile than it was in 1918, and we have the ability to transport mutations around the globe much quicker."
4745,"We are, in one sense, our own worst enemy."
4746,What do people do if they don't own smartphones?
4747,"Keep in mind that there are a sizable number of people, some of them teenagers with very limited means of leaving their parents house, who have gotten vaccinated secretly and would potentially suffer negative consequences if the CDC just decided their medical privacy doesn't matter."
4748,There's already apps that can confirm a vaccination card if a certain setting needs that level of certainty without needing to waive HIPAA.
4749,[removed]
4750,[removed]
4751,"No, at the beginning there was a lot of gas-lighting going on."
4752,"First they claimed it couldn't possibly have anything to do with the vaccine and it was all in our heads, then that it was because we were ""nervous about being vaccinated"" or ""stressed about finding an appointment""."
4753,"The usual par for course bullshit when it comes to women's health, basically."
4754,No one reporting this early on was anti-vax and we just wanted it recognized as a side-effect but instead we were told we were stupid and crazy.
4755,"And thanks for your bit of mansplaining, but in 27 years of menstruating every month I've experienced a hell of a lot of illnesses and health issues and insane times of stress and anxiety, but none of them have ever remotely messed with my periid the way the first dose of Moderna did!"
4756,"You‚Äôre right, Covid in general is definitely less dangerous for kids than the flu."
4757,But we don‚Äôt really know about Delta yet.
4758,Let‚Äôs do some math for the kids.
4759,"Even if Delta is no more dangerous for kids than OG Wuhan Covid, its reproductive rate is way higher (flu‚Äôs R0 is between 1 and 2; Delta‚Äôs is estimated at 7) which can easily make up for the slightly lower infection fatality rate in kids."
4760,"How many kids are we willing to sicken, permanently disable and/or kill in order to restore in person learning?"
4761,"Probably none if schools overhauled their ventilation systems and required masks, but this is the US and we‚Äôve never had anything resembling a plan for how to deal with this pandemic because masks hurt people‚Äôs feelings."
4762,The worst part of this enduring clusterfuck is that pediatric hospitalizations for Covid continue to increase exponentially and America doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.
4763,"My (adult, not pediatric) ICU is still full of Delta cases and my hospital itself is full from Covid along with its competitors in mortality: cancer, stroke and cardiac issues."

4799,"Nor have the last couple of days been under 5k, except yesterday."
4800,"On Tuesday Israel had \~6,800 cases, Monday it was \~10,800."
4801,"But those measures are indeed somewhat problematic because they depend a the number of tests, which varies from day to day."
4802,However the percentage of positive tests has also been decreasing in recent days.
4803,"An even more reliable measure is the reduction in the number of new critically ill patients, which doesn't depend on the number of tests at all."
4804,"This has been steadily decreasing since the end of August, and is now at 20% below the peak."
4805,"The overall reduction of R below 1 isn't particularly surprising or anomalous ‚Äî it's a continuation of a trend that began soon after the start of the booster campaign, and has been ongoing for about a month."

4845,800 are vaccinated and 200 unvaccinated.
4846,If you're unvaccinated and get Covid you have a 10% chance to end up in the hospital.
4847,"So... 1000 people get Covid, 20 unvaccinated, and 20 vaccinated go to the hospital (half-half)."
4848,It means if you're vaccinated you have only a 2.5% risk to be hospitalized compared to 10% if you're unvaccinated.

4899,Are you saying 100% have not had both doses?
4900,It already has in states where that's happening.
4901,You're considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second dose.
4902,It's not necessary for everyone to follow the rules.
4903,You just need enough people to follow the rules so that R_eff &lt; 1 and the virus will die out.
4904,Low humidity increases it.
4905,Anti-vaxxers must have failed statistics class.
4906,It may be helpful for you to see your mother outdoors but cut off indoor visitation.
4907,There is a possibility your hardline stance is causing her to dig in even more
4908,It's because you're not doing them properly.
4909,"Properly done lockdowns like the ones we do in New Zealand, work."

4918,I've been reading about that G20 Rome pact many health ministers have agreed with.
4919,"They changed their goals to donate jabs for the poorest countries until the year of the year, it was from 2 bi to 1,45 bi doses (enough for 40% of each population)."
4920,This number is based in the matter of richer countries not donating enough for the COVAX facility.
4921,"Anyhow seems a rather realistic goal, they also say that COVAX is speeding up, even though the jabs aren't enough (for now)."
4922,I am truly hoping those in unquestionable need will be vaccinated before the year's end.
4923,"Enough of the ""recommendations""."
4924,I want to see some action.
4925,Winter is coming...
4926,No it isn't.
4927,This is a safety issue not a retaliation because of one's religion.
4928,Employees who medically cannot be vaccinated are also placed on leave.
4929,‚ÄúIn this study we screened a total of 385 patients who were diagnosed of onchocerciasis.
4930,"Out of which, 37 (9.6%) were eligible for further tests, as their sperm counts were normal while the remaining patients had very low sperm counts and were therefore not used for further tests or were too weak after the preliminary screening tests and were not considered eligible for further test/studies."
4931,"We therefore investigated the effects of ivermectin therapy on the sperm functions of these eligible 37 diagnosed patients.‚Äù

If only 9.6% of their subjects even had enough fertility for the researchers to study, something in that environment is causing problems with male fertility even before the ivermectin gets to them."
4932,"This is concerning, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like ivermectin is the main problem."
4933,After being delayed several months by the local government being too proud to accept the distribution contract that BioNTech had signed with a company in Shanghai.
4934,TW could have fully vaccinated months ago if they werent so proud
4935,"Still waiting for their covid vaccine to get approved somewhere, anywhere."
4936,Was supposed to happen months ago and they keep delaying.
4937,Gotta wonder if all that vaccine they are currently stockpiling is going to expire before it gets approved anywhere.
4938,Absolutely!
4939,If educators made what professional sports ball players make the pandemic would've been over by now and they'd have their wish.
4940,"Sadly, we live in a time where these people ignore science and fact for crackpot FB ""research"" and horse dewormer.. What a time to be alive, amirite?"
4941,Damn I missed that news too.

4943," C: x ,"
4944,"It is, but I think this is good information to be made public as last year many of the arguments against CERB was ‚Äúhow will we pay for it?‚Äù."
4945,"If the stay of one patient is costing more than CERB was for its entirety for one person then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it, especially when we take into consideration the future costs of healthcare for this patient associated with long term effects of covid."
4946,Oh believe me I wish there were no exemptions.
4947,I am past tired of everyone trying to rationalize with all of these adults behaving like children.
4948,"Not DoD, but am in an AFGE shop."

4957,Up-fucking-vote.
4958,I mean: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ivermectin-sterility-in-men/
4959,Apparently.
4960,I had a nursing home patient transferred in for sepsis and aspiration.
4961,She was Covid negative and daughter wanted to visit.
4962,I had to call daughter for consents and she started asking about visiting and our policy is Covid vaccination or PCR Covid test within 72 hrs.
4963,As soon as I said the word vaccination she shouts ‚Äúit‚Äôs against my region!
4964,!‚Äù Cue the long awkward pause.
4965,"Well ok. I‚Äôm not aware of any religions that ban vaccination but werk, you do you."
4966,Then I had to hear how ridiculous the policy is and blah blah blah Covid test.
4967,And I was eternally grateful that no way in hell was this woman going to be able to visit during this hospital stay.
4968,Why hasn't a national vaccine mandate been instituted yet (for those eligible)?
4969,Or even a national mask mandate?
4970,Work from home easily solves traffic jams and emissions.
4971,"One of the few good things to come from covid was that bosses were force to implement it, the technology existed for years but there was no will to use."
4972,Who on earth wants to sit in a traffic jam for up to an hour or even more each way every monday to friday?
4973,"Not sure of your agency, but mum has been the word for the Defense Dept."
4974,I think most of the delay is probably coming from negotiations with AFGE but I can't say for sure.
4975,I would imagine we'll see something very soon.
4976,"On another note, I'm kind of wondering if Biden will actually mandate the vaccine for federal employees today."
4977,Probably not because of the crap storm it could create.
4978,They should consider doing like United Airlines and placing unvaccinated people on unpaid leave until the current surge starts dying down.

4980,"&gt;oks like somebody accidentaly opened a can of worms and exposed highly inflated prices because ""it's a global pandemic, no expense spared!"

ICU cost is 1600$/day in Canada."
4982,If you end-up there usually it is for a couple of weeks.
4983,Data is out and it's been shown to be false.
4984,As soon as the FDA approved it all the bullshit needs to stop.
4985,I have friends who always try to tell me abput the science of this or that regarding covid or pcr tests or variants or cytokine storms..
4986,"I say ""I have an undergraduate degree in human biology but I am 100% unqualified to judge the merits of the science in these medical papers."
4987,I am not a virologist or molecular biologist or specialist.
4988,"I have absolutely no way of verifying any of the high level technical information and I am not going to pretend it is simple or common sense especially when the conclusions I am meant to draw differ radically from the global consensus of actual experts all over the world."""
4989,"School openings in the midst of a pandemic will never be safe, especially when a huge chunk of the students can not be vaccinated."
4990,It's the unfortunate truth and I think officials should be honest about that.
4991,Much better chance of dying if you're unvaccinated.
4992,Have at it I say.
4993,Right.
4994,"Why is it so ""controversial""?"
4995,"We all take vaccines to go to college, to travel."
4996,We get our pets vaccinated.
4997,I literally do not understand.
4998,"If people can't make the right decision for the public health, then the government should step in to do it for them."
4999,"If there's anything I've learned throughout the pandemic it is that most people, including the media and political leaders, can't understand or communicate statistics or data."
5000,Or draw any conclusion that isn't 100% black and white.
5001,"So simple, so elegant"
5002,We *had* this at my work for a few months in the summer.
5003,"If you submitted proof of vaccination, you got a special sticker on your security badge and didn't need to follow masking/SD rules."
5004,Then along came delta.
5005,Vaccine 25$ per dose.
5006,"50$

Covid Test 100$

Hospitalized patient 23K$."
5007,920 more expensive than vaccine and risks of lifetime reduced lung capacity.
5008,"If I can‚Äôt sacrifice virgins to my volcano god, then these people shouldn‚Äôt get an exemption on vaccines."
5009,"Many do not trust the government, and that includes the FDA, but they trust other sources of information such as on Facebook, which they think provide the ""real deal""."
5010,"So weird, since they want to increase the number of pirates to lower global warming."
5011,Wouldn't that decrease sunny days and lower the amounts of holy days they get?
5012,I guess they care more about others than their own happiness or something.
5013,Just weird to see it as a religion.
5014,"I mean Texans wanted to be completely independent at first, didn‚Äôt join the US right away and shared a border with the US‚Ä¶"
5015,Could not agree more.
5016,I don't know why this isn't a thing yet.
5017,"I even think we to be way more stringent about it, I'm tired of hearing ""negative tests for the unvaccinated""."
5018,If they require vaccinations to fly domestically then we'd be getting somewhere.
5019,"It is not a lie, the same active ingredient is used in livestock medication, which is more widely available, so some people are inadvisably buying and using that."
5020,But the doses are much higher because it is for a much larger animal and they are overdosing.

5023,Same with climate change if people hadn't fought against adaptation and mitigation efforts on both personal and corp/govt levels.
5024,"Yes, manufacturing and agriculture are much larger exporters of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, but they only get away with what people and govts allow, and govts only regulate what people demand be regulated."
5025,"The same is slowly happening with vaccine uptake, as the people, healthcare/education systems, and markets demand vaccine uptake to protect capital, employees, customers and as leaders are forced by public opinion to change their stances from one that wins a popularity contest with a vocal minority to one that actually serves the public need."
5026,Vaccines work period
5027,For what?
5028,An employee angry at this particular policy doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.
5029,IANAL but supposedly they have to make reasonable accommodations given the exception.
5030,"AFAIK the airline could state that they are unable to provide such, and that their only recourse is to let them go."

5039,"lmao, can confirm the strange stories about changes in smell/food taste months afterwards."
5040,"Am vaccinated since months, had mild corona in december 2020, food changed taste since a week now."
5041,Attributing this to past corona
5042,Most are evangelical Protestants with the Catholic population close behind.

5054,"You were not an idiot, you were smart."
5055,"Link is great, if you read on it shows that after correcting for the age imbalance, effectiveness is still &gt;90% in each age group."
5056,"It's not a vaccine they require, but a negative covid test within 24 hours of travel."
5057,Even those vaccinated can spread Covid.
5058,"I just read a statement by an America  woman (fully vaccinated) that tested negative 3 days prior to entering the US, but when she tested again at home, she tested positive."
5059,I can't believe nobody gave you the real answer.
5060,"&gt;For example, Pfizer reports 95% efficacy, but this could just be because most vaccinated people never got exposed to Covid in the first place, right?"
5061,Why isn‚Äôt there a standard for measuring how much exposure there is between groups in studies?
5062,"I know intentionally exposing people to diseases is unethical, but why can‚Äôt we do this on rats?"
5063,"Okay, first, there is no standard for this in the trial because *nobody knew who got the actual vaccine and who got the placebo*."
5064,"It's a ""double blind"" study."
5065,The people giving the shots didn't know if they were administering a placebo or the vaccine.
5066,The people getting the shots didn't know either.
5067,"So they waited until they had a bunch of cases to ""unblind"" and find out who got the vaccine and who got the placebo."
5068,"Second, we did challenge studies in rhesus macaques and the results were better than real world studies in humans."
5069,"I am not trying to be contrarian, but if you want this argument to be more sound, don't just say ""According to the Pope""."
5070,"Catholics are not obligated to follow everything the Pope says without discernment, and they will accurately point that out when you toe that line."
5071,The [Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith) has said that two of the vaccines are permissible and one is under grave necessity.
5072,"The CDF exists to ""spread sound Catholic doctrine and defend those points of Christian tradition which seem in danger because of new and unacceptable doctrines."""
5073,They are not being put on leave for their religious view.
5074,They are being put on leave for not being protected against COVID.
5075,"Per the article, once COVID is under some level of control, customer facing roles will be able to return to work."
5076,Non-customer facing roles will be able to return once they have improved testing and sanitation ability.
5077,This is the same for medical exemptions.
5078,Also many of the labor laws around accomodations have a public health/imminent health threat section advising that is there is an imminent threat to health of employees or others then they are not required to provide an intervention.
5079,They would be well within their right (imo) to fire anyone who doesn't get the vaccine given the pandemic.
5080,You basically won't find a medical treatment that hasn't been tested on embryonic cells at some point.
5081,Your point stands for pretty much everything
5082,Had to drive an hour to get a second Pfizer shot only to later hear Moderna might be more protective.
5083,Sigh.
5084,Horse paste?
5085,What a bizarre world we live in where a teenager is the most mature person in a room full of adults.
5086,They'll have to prove they've never been vaccinated.

5184,This concern seems to be that rising antibodies and dropping infection rates among the boosted-populations are deceptive and a ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù will occur in which these don‚Äôt end up improving outcomes in the medium and long term and it will end up having been a waste.

5204,And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.
5205,Biden is also signing an executive order to require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government ‚Äî with no option to test out.
5206,"That covers several million more workers."""
5207,Why stop at 100?
5208,Why not  if you have employees you must require vaccinations!

It's fascinating because it shows how different booster strategies would have an impact, and how, counterintuitively, being very aggressive with boosters might actually be counterproductive."
5227,He's found that a programme of rapid boosters (for the most vulnerable) followed by quite a slow programme of boosters for everyone else (running into next Spring) would have the optimal outcome.
5228,"The only criticism I have is I think he may have over-estimated waning protection against hospitalisation, he has it as a constant decline of about 2% per month, yet real-world data (including studies that showed a rapid fall in protection against infection) have shown really quite sticky protection against hospitalisation (e.g."
5229,"a recent study from Bahrain that showed efficacy against infection falling to zero, still had efficacy against hospitalisation as being 90%)."
5230,"The other flaw is one he acknowledged here: https://twitter.com/JamesWard73/status/1436045598554218499 so, with a bit of luck the central projections are slightly on the pessimistic side, but nothing that a tweak to the assumptions wouldn't fix (if it was proven to be required)."

6079,Not one single federal employee in my organization has been asked to attest to their vaccination status.
6080,There have been zero e-mails from leadership and everybody just acts like it's not a thing even though the requirement was announced back in July.

6082,"They can send similar amounts to many other countries for the same purpose, or try to completely protect one country which doesn't help that much in the big picture."

6110,"(I can go months without menstruating) However,  I never got my period early until my first Moderna shot  which was two weeks after my last period."
6111,Started a day or two after the shot for me too iirc.
6112,I chalked it up as weird getting back to fertility after starting my period again 2 months prior because I had a baby  until I heard of other women having weird cycles.
6113,"It's been rather regular since, with only a few day difference instead of weeks like I am use too."
6114,"On the plus side, I haven't been getting really weak (maybe anemic?)"
6115,from my periods since the shots.
6116,"I am noticing significantly less bleeding too (still a lot, but not like risking leaking through an overnight pad in 2-3 hours a lot like it was before) So I will take it lol."
6117,"Just to be accurate, the vaccination requirement for domestic flights isn‚Äôt in place yet nor is there a date."

6128,"It never occurred to me that if they were trained to do healthcare as Guardsmen, then it was probably part of their civilian job as well."
6129,And this is why I scheduled a booster appointment for a 70+ relative who is 7+ months out.

6146,Especially now during the pandemic.
6147,"The people who show up to the meetings are so often so deluded with social media memes and nonsense they‚Äôve consumed from websites that would make most eight years olds think ‚Äúyeah, that looks kinda fishy‚Ä¶‚Äù It‚Äôs like a major part of the population has lost any capacity for incredulity."
6148,"They binge bullshit wholesale, and then come into our school board meetings and regurgitate this high grade balderdash that should embarrass them, but doesn‚Äôt, as they‚Äôve lost their abilities both to introspect and to feel shame‚Ä¶"
6149,Delta is just insanely more efficient at spreading.
6150,"Where kids were fairly proof against the original virus, Delta has enough horsepower to get past their immune systems."
6151,Keeping them out of school didn't matter.

6156,I feel like people pushing disinformation should be arrested and held criminally and financially liable for the damage they‚Äôre directly causing.
6157,"While disinformation pushers are a hydra, I feel if we keep cutting off the heads of the disinformation monster it will eventually die or get so weak that it won‚Äôt have a significant impact anymore."

6166,"Even in the responsible states I see 100 percent capacity stadiums with few masks in sight, tail gating, and after parties."

6176,is there no other metric with which to measure courage?
6177,I think pushing people to adopt a policy that isnt fully proven will further entrench the resistance and increase the frustration in those not yet vaccinated.
6178,"What I dont understand, is why politically it was deemed reasonable to do either or, but now its not."
6179,"Seems to me the either or policy is the fairest manner to accommodate many on both sides of this issue, while keeping the economy going and frustration and possible backlash low."

6190,They can‚Äôt accommodate their choice to not receive a vaccine.
6191,There are health mandates for many professions.
6192,You won‚Äôt get the job if you don‚Äôt comply.
6193,I think the CDC is trying to push the ‚Äúboosters aren‚Äôt really necessary‚Äù narrative as a way to get more vaccine hesitant people vaccinated.
6194,Because the CDC probably feels that public availability of booster shots would just feed into the anti-vaxx narrative.
6195,"I don‚Äôt agree with this stance btw, but this is probably what the CDC is thinking."
6196,"Not necessarily, they could argue that their vaccination was prior to them taking up the particular religion that they are CURRENTLY practicing."
6197,"If your mom/dad was atheist and they took you to get vaccinated when you were infant or even up to when you were in school, you could still argue that you could NOT refuse at that time though."
6198,"That said, I think if employer treats ALL religions that does not allow vaccination equally and fires anyone that practices religion that does not allow vaccination based on some work function (vaccination is required since he/she will come in contact with potentially many people including people who can not be vaccinated and may be considered liability to the company), it will PROBABLY pass muster of equal treatment."

6204,Patriotism has it's limits.
6205,&gt; Anyone still quarantining post-vax at this point is delusional.

6209,Now... no.
6210,"There's a music festival on in my town starting today, and I want to see it, but I won't, because no one here wears masks."
6211,"We still get all our food delivered, because honestly, we get better results than the supermarket, but also because no one here wears masks."
6212,"I am making decisions I wouldn't otherwise make, because I consider the chances of catching COVID small, but not zero."
6213,"A musician I played with once or twice, a great guy in perfect shape and doubly vaccinated, died of breakthrough COVID recently after nursing his mother who had it and he was only a few years older than I.

I call this ""quarantine"" even though it's not strict and I'm not cowering in my home."

6218,That's what they said about the UK 2-3 months ago.
6219,"""They're past the 40,000 cases a day peak and cases are falling rapidly - remove all restrictions!""."
6220,"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/united-kingdom-covid-cases.html

That lasted for about 2 weeks, never fell very far, and now cases are back to 37,000 a day and climbing."
6221,"We do not currently have any evidence of COVID ""burning through"" anything, other than hitting a wall when 80-90% of the whole population is vaccinated."
6222,"""They also mention hospitalizations were reduced by 75% through vaccination, which is very different than the CDC's (IIRC?)"
6223,"99% reported earlier."""
6224,This is a comparison to unvaccinated individuals.
6225,You are making the assumption that unvaccinated individuals have a 100% chance of being hospitalized which is not the case.
6226,Let's \*assume\* that 10% of the unvaxxed will be hospitalized after getting COVID.
6227,that would mean that only 2.5% of vaccinated would be hospitalized.
6228,"However, this is also AFTER catching COVID."
6229,We know that vaccines make that even less likely.
6230,"So all in all, my back of the napkin math says that vaccinated individuals are less than 1% likely to be hospitalized due to COVID."

6236,One day I was subbing and told one of the kids I had a headache.
6237,"First half the classroom came over and started hugging me, then the other half followed."
6238,Years later when I subbed older kids I subbed for a sixth grade special ed class.
6239,One of the kids talked to me about suicidal feelings (and yes I told the Principal).
6240,I talked to her about it and told her she had friends who cared about her and so on.
6241,"The next day she came running over to me, hugging me and following me all around the school for days after that."
6242,The children had more empathy and intelligence than any of the adults there.

6386,Just a quick rant‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand that we are this far into this and people still think that a negative test a day or two after exposure means they‚Äôre in the clear.
6387,This assumption is probably largely responsible for the spread.
6388,The amount of patients I encounter on the daily who want a test because they were exposed yesterday and need to be cleared for work the next day is far too many.

6625,2.
6626,"Kids under 12 need to have a vaccine approved for them, and that vaccine needs to be distributed."

6633,"Obviously, all four of those are not happening overnight and some of them will only happen to varying degrees."
6634,However let me give you a scenario -- say that COVID cases drop down to background noise in your area like they did in the summer and you were fully vaccinated in April.
6635,Did you feel more free to go out unmasked to a park or to eat at a restaurant?
6636,"Now that hospitals are full, cases are breaking records, and breakthrough cases are happening some, you might not feel comfortable doing those things at the moment."
6637,"At least for me, it's not a binary thing where either everything is 2019-normal or 2020-COVID World."

6640,What that means for you may be different than for other people.
6641,I have kids so I have to mostly act like it's still 2020-COVID World out there because they're sitting ducks until the FDA approves a vaccine for them.
6642,"If you're single and fully vaccinated, you are more free to do more ""normal"" things."
6643,"All of the studies that have been done are underfunded and not very well controlled (or actively/unethically uncontrolled), and all show results right on the boundary of significance."
6644,"It's entirely possible, even likely, that ivermectin is slightly beneficial."
6645,"It could easily reduce risk by 1-1.5 fold if given early in progression, comparable to what steroids (dex) can do late in progression."
6646,"IVM also has an excellent safety profile (in correct dosage), and isn't very expensive."
6647,"It's fairly damaging that we're refusing to prescribe it to crazy people that then OD on a horse dose, but not really any more so than any drug criminalization."
6648,"Of course, a 1.5-fold risk ratio is quite marginal, and nothing compared to the 15+ fold decrease in risk from vaccination."

6689,*
6690,"Mask guidance from the CDC stated vaccinated people don't have to wear masks, when the science showed they still could transmit the coronavirus."
6691,Just because the delta variant made that worse doesn't mean they jumped the gun on removing that guidance.
6692,And it's not like it was hard to see that the idiots would be doing everything they could to skirt their continued guidance of having to wear masks.
6693,"Since it was on the honor system, and there are at least 170m dishonorable people in the U.S., the idiots all took their masks off."
6694,It was a mistake and it was one that wasn't based on science.
6695,"Or maybe for some reason they didn't account for the idiots making it worse, but from the moment the guidance was changed, the idiots made it worse."
6696,And wasn't it like a month ago the CDC reversed course?
6697,Anyway when they changed their guidance to the misguided suggestions most states with mandates still in effect buckled and removed theirs and updated to fall in line with CDC guidance.
6698,In my state our R governor said when we got to 70% vaccination that we'd remove the mandates.
6699,Well we weren't even close when the CDC announced those updated guidelines.
6700,"And sure, my local state isn't the CDC but health departments from every state get their direction from the CDC so it was really just an irresponsible move."
6701,"Also, if the Trump years didn't teach you that the CDC, like any other governmental institution, is a political tool to be wielded then I'm not sure how to wake you up to that."
6702,I can say I won't pee on the toilet seat anymore but how would anyone know it's me?
6703,Biden fucked up on masks.
6704,The CDC falls under the executive branch.
6705,It's his CDC with his people and it's their failure.
6706,"It's still way, way, way better than the shitshow we almost got stuck with another four years of but it's still a little fucked up now."

6728,"How often do you go outside, what do you do for work, how many people come to your house, how many people live in your house, how many of those people go to school/daycare, etc etc."
6729,"They take that info and balance the two groups to make sure it‚Äôs evenly represented in demographics, Medical history, risk exposures."

6734,Greek gods = mythology.
6735,But religious people think their God= real.
6736,Serious question with presidential politics aside.... that CDC guidance was a horribly stupid decision and anyone paying attention to covid and the rest of the world knew that.
6737,"I'm guessing Biden had to sanction that or something, but I don't recall him being very vocal about it at all, so I've attributed most of the stupidity with that and poor decision making to those in the CDC specifically.... maybe with Biden giving his blessing and crossing his fingers that they were making a good decision."
6738,I didn't see it as Biden being the fuel behind it....I guess because he wasn't constantly talking about removing your mask and he often still wore one.
6739,Am I being naive?
6740,Maybe I'm not understanding of something else that might have occurred behind the scenes?
6741,".... and by ""presidential politics aside"" I mean that I'm trying to view it and seek an answer that isn't based in something that starts with a ""Republicans vs Democrats"" lens/filter...."
6742,"Sorry, you can‚Äôt have a conversation about the state of the pandemic in the USA without mentioning the horrific hole filled with 500,000 dead Americans left by Trump."

6750,The general US population (by original eligibility) is still quite a few months off.
6751,"Or to look at it another way, 40% of the world has [now gotten a first dose](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), or 0.7 doses per population."
6752,"At 0.0045 doses per person per day, it's another ~66 days to reach 1 dose per person."
6753,This may be the lower bound of where mitigation is possible.
6754,"It feels bad to prioritize third doses over first doses, but of course much of the world's doses are going to the very-low-value second doses so this isn't as clear-cut as it seems."

6937,"I just had a physical and my PC asked me, it wasn‚Äôt automatically in my chart that I know of."
6938,Why stop there?
6939,What about all the other ailments that are at some point preventable?
6940,As a medical professional it disgusts and worries me the amount of people who share this sentiment.
6941,I could clear up most of our hospital beds if I began deducing which were preventable at some point.
6942,This mentality isn‚Äôt helping the mental health decline that is so prevalent in the US.
6943,It‚Äôs actually pushing it further down.

6948,I was just about to ask this question.
6949,Isn‚Äôt it hypocritical to get the antibodies if you‚Äôre so against the vaccine?

6957,Funny.. you're joking about this and so clearly oblivious to the fact that hospitals actually DO have to make decisions such as these when they are faced with the necessity of prioritizing care.

7003,Those couple people are probably the same ones that circulate that shitty meme of a baby being forcibly vaccinated while the baby's mother is held down and restrained.
7004,"Of course the kid is crying, as anti-vaxxers love photos of crying kids, forgetting toddlers will cry at everything, including giving them the very toy they just were screaming that they wanted."
7005,I feel that.
7006,I‚Äôve just decided there is obviously nothing anyone could say to change their minds at this point and let it go.
7007,They are too prideful and egotistical to ever admit they‚Äôre wrong.
7008,"Unless I misunderstood something about the study, I don't think it gets at what most people are *really* interested in: Do vaccinated people who get COVID-19 infect others at the same rate as unvaccinated people who get COVID-19?"
7009,"It looks like this study shows that when a member of a household is vaccinated, other members of that household are less likely to get COVID-19."
7010,"That's great, but it's already well-established that getting vaccinated significantly reduces the odds of getting COVID-19 in the first place."
7011,So the effect that authors found in this study could simply be from vaccinated individuals not getting COVID-19 and therefore not being able to transmit it to other members of their household.
7012,"In order to answer the open question that people still have, the authors would have needed to look at rates of transmission in households that have had a breakthrough case."
7013,It's the plot of Idiocracy
7014,I'm out of the midwest.
7015,Our managers don't really get respect at our station lol.
7016,In the past couple months we had a few fights leading to multiple terminations and we are already short staffed.
7017,Except some 'single brain-cell'd organisms' sold fake vaccination cards and had some people in pharmacies falsely enter the unvaccinated into the system to generate real numbers so the whole system is ruined.

7021,Already did just waiting for the kids to get Vaxed then it's live and let die.
7022,Amen
7023,Because they will do and say absolutely ANYTHING to avoid having to take responsibility for anything.
7024,Its always someone else's fault so they never have to feel wrong about anything.
7025,They do the same shit with their abortion argument.
7026,They act like they are against abortion because it‚Äôs killing babies and they need to save the babies.
7027,"Frankly when I see a mother who knows she can‚Äôt properly take care of her baby get an abortion, I see that as her making the best choice for her baby."
7028,I don‚Äôt see how her having that baby despite her inability to care for it is at all fair to the baby.
7029,"That leaves the baby either in a bad situation with the mother, in foster care or worse, when that baby should not have been forced to be born."
7030,"The GOP can genuinely make that argument when they figure out a plan for each and every one of those children they are forcing to be born, right now they are doing nothing to provide those children or mothers with support while forcing as many children to be born as possible."
7031,Nothing they are doing is ‚Äúsaving‚Äù those babies.

7060,"He's 71 with high risk conditions and vaccinated with Pfizer, but going off the Isreal data on Pfizer, I wish he could get the booster now."
7061,"But he isn't going to say he is immunocompromised to get one, and he also always listens to his Doctor, and she told him he has to wait until the end of November (he's around 6 months now, so that would be 8 months) to be able to get one."
7062,"So... he isn't getting one unless the CDC changes it's stance here (they really should be allowing those 65+ with Pfizer to get it at 5-6 months going off the data, Imo), which it doesn't seem like they will, and it is very worrying."
7063,:(
7064,Damn!
7065,"With a face like that, that fat woman has nothing to smile about!"
7066,"OK, I agree with the vaccine creation and roll out, and the R0 number being higher and therefore the death rate."

7070,"At first I misunderstood it, then I laughed."
7071,Yeah in DC we have had one of our worst summers in years (hit our average number of 90+ degree days quite early this year) and the cases didn‚Äôt explode.
7072,I think the weather definitely plays a factor in spread based on how it impacts behavior but it is probably overstated a bit.
7073,There's wide disparities between the different nations in the UK.
7074,"Looking at the ""UK total"" on [their hospitalizations dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare), you see that the whole of the UK is on a slight upward trend right now."
7075,"But if you select the ""By nation"" view and toggle through the nations, England is basically flat, Wales is steadily rising, and Scotland and N. Ireland are almost as bad as they were at their peaks."
7076,"This isn't explained by vaccinations, as if you click over to the [vaccinations dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations) and look at the ""Vaccination uptake, by report date"" by nation, they're all at 86-90% uptake."
7077,The only thing that makes sense to me is that England and maybe Wales also have higher levels of natural immunity through infections.

7176,"I don't think the CDC are too concerned with where the anti-vax narrative goes next, and I don't think they'd make such a blatantly political decision."
7177,There is simply no evidence that booster shots provide real long term benefits yet.

7182,I just meant that is some people's logic.
7183,Antivaxers.
7184,They claim that the vaccines offer no protection at all from catching COVID-19 so the vaccinated are walking around without masks spreading it to everyone.
7185,"This entire debate has been really frustrating because it seems like the debate is somehow over whether vaccines reduce transmission at all, which what your comment addresses."
7186,"Isn't the real issue whether vaccinated can still be *significant spreaders*, however you define that, even though they obviously will be less transmissible than the unvaccinated?"
7187,"If the answer is yes, then vaccinated also need to mask and be tested."
7188,Similar things from VA for the most recent week.

7583,"parks and rec tried to exaggerate these meetings, but in reality, they are often nearly that crazy."

7589,"Here's a thing that some people like to do - when we get to talking about some part of dealing with the pandemic they don't like (wearing masks, distancing, vaccines, quarantine, etc) people use words like ""endure this misery forever"" which makes everything sound more dramatic."

When you calculate the vaccine effectiveness for different age groups, you find a different picture."
7739,"While in all ages, the rate of severe cases is 3.1x higher in unvaccinated individuals than fully vaccinated individuals, it becomes much higher once you break it down into finer groups: 

* In the age group 50-59, the vaccine is 94.2% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 5.4x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 60-69, the vaccine is 93.2% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 12.5x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 70-79, the vaccine is 95.6.6% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 20.3x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 80-89, the vaccine is 90.7% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 18.3x greater if you're unvaccinated

8475,I feel you.
8476,(A large) part of me just wants COVID to wean out all those assholes (especially that lady that was laughing during the viral video of the kid speaking about how his grandmother died from COVID) so the rest of us can get back to our lives.
8477,Like I'm sorry that I no longer want to suffer from anxiety and depression related to isolation from the pandemic (19 months and going strong) because people don't want to do something that only takes 2 days out of their life (this is even including waiting for the side effects to subside).
8478,You just know those same people don't give a damn because they don't isolate or socially distance and have long gone back to pretending COVID doesn't exist.
8479,"Look, I am pro vaxx and doing the necessary precautions, but I really hate this type of narrative."
8480,It‚Äôs almost as if people act as if the US is the only country who is currently still facing COVID.
8481,"because it's not the topic at hand, and something cause hospitals to overcrowd, right now as we speak"
8482,[removed]
8483,The man needs to give it a rest lol
8484,I‚Äôve talked with retail workers that aren‚Äôt vaxxed because they don‚Äôt have time to take off for the day after when the fever symptoms hit.
8485,If retail stores gave a paid time for getting the shot and then a paid day off after then more would do it.
8486,"Shit, tell the local doctors office to set up a vaccine station in the break room or something."
8487,If only anyone gave a damn what this kramer looking q tip has to say.

8496,"I'm wondering if my data is in the system for the first, but not the second."
8497,I thought that was weird.
8498,with freedom comes responsibility
8499,I think the problem here is even having politics in the discussion.
8500,"Doesn't matter if you are conservative or liberal, democrat or republican, it's not a political test."
8501,It's a test in whether or not you chose to believe science and statistics and do the responsible thing.
8502,"It's not a decision we want to make, or should have to make, but at a certain point decisions have to be made."
8503,Fool's hope maybe.
8504,I want to see the end of this but until under 12s are vaccinated  and people aren't trying to pretend covid isnt happening nothing is really going to improve.
8505,They only got to that place by purposefully ignoring facts.
8506,No excuse.

8518,"I don't believe any of this bullshit, I'm just saying it's why he is doing it."
8519,Yes!!
8520,I want to know this too.
8521,"&gt; is to give care to those who require it 

Yes."
8522,"That includes all sorts of war criminals, villains, people who make questionable medical decisions, and so on."
8523,&gt;people who have made the decision to not get the vaccine have made it clear that they do not believe they require care from medical experts.
8524,Absolutely not.
8525,People who haven't taken the vaccine and require care are morally equal to anyone else in terms of deserving treatment.
8526,That's the reason why triage protocols only consider the potential patient outcomes and nothing else.
8527,"Sorry, bruv, but 2000+ years of medical ethics research has shut these views out of healthcare for some very good reasons."
8528,"Any time people with these views come out, we gotta bonk you on the head like some sort of demented game of whack-a-mole."
8529,"If so, then why not the others?"

8532,Yep.it will only be one more violent when more restrictions are imposed.
8533,I don't think it will be a big deal here (USA) because so far restrictions are pretty much no.
8534,Existent.
8535,"But for Countries in EU, Australia and maybe NZ , with vaccine required to enter restaurants and such, it is going to raise blood pressure and bring out a more deadly variant aka extviolence."

8543,It's terrifying how convinced they are that they're right.
8544,Not all hospitals are having to ration care.
8545,The OP I replied to didn‚Äôt state ‚Äúin circumstances where care must be rationed.‚Äù They just said what‚Äôs unethical about denying them ICU resources.

8549,I work at a theme park and it‚Äôs my main form of entertainment too.
8550,"But if I have to actually be working 3-6 feet of someone else for more than a few seconds I mask up, even outdoors."
8551,This past week I had to go home for a funeral and stay with my parents.
8552,My wife got notification she had a possible exposure at work.
8553,I wanted to turn around and go home but instead we annoying masked up the entire time in my parents house until we got 2 negative tests.
8554,"I could just be lucky, but I think given our 2 jobs and state (teacher/theme park employee in Florida) it‚Äôs pretty good evidence that being safe and stacking precaution on top of precaution works wonders."

8860,They prevent you from getting COVID-19.

8892,why are those on medicare allowed to not be vaccinated?
8893,"Being vaccinated does many times more to prevent you from spreading COVID as having a negative COVID test, and is many, many, many times cheaper than testing every day."
8894,It's as simple as that.
8895,Can confirm colds and flu and RSV are going around rampantly right now.
8896,I was exposed to a positive person last weekend and started feeling sick.
8897,"Tested negative, turns out it's just a cold."

8924,Hey everyone!
8925,I have a quick question for you guys.
8926,I'm curious to get your thoughts.
8927,"With the intense push for vaccine passports and mandates for many jobs, I'm wondering why it's not as acceptable to show a negative Covid test as it is to show you are vaccinated."
8928,We have rapid testing available and the technology and access could surely be improved upon substantially if we heavily invested in it.
8929,"Also, it is interesting that there are numerous cases of people still catching Covid while being vaccinated, so not like that is fool-proof."
8930,"If the whole point is that having and spreading Covid is bad, then why can't we emphasize having negative Covid tests as much as being vaccinated?"
8931,Not like our government can't create billions of dollars out of thin air to make this an easy reality if they so desired.
8932,I'm extremely skeptical of the pharmaceutical industry and our government as they have each shown over decades that they value profit and control over almost all else.
8933,It makes me question how much the financial incentive and desire to control more aspects of our lives  plays a role in this.
8934,I would love to hear your thoughts on this!
8935,Seems fishy to say the least.
8936,Thank you for taking the time to read this.

9175,Likely they're just waiting on more data.

9251,I think it is important to note that is not the argument all public health officials are making.
9252,"A lot of them in the US are saying we don't *need* a booster, while their motivation is to preserve shots for other countries."
9253,"For example, Dr. Celine Gounder basically says the public needs to accept getting sick from COVID, so stop asking for boosters: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/americans-are-losing-sight-endgame/619916/

I personally see extreme value in vaccinating other counties, it keeps us safer from variants."
9254,But I don't like the deception that is being used to get us there.
9255,"Not to mention, the long term consequences of discounting booster shots, which might replay like the whole masking debacle early in the pandemic."

9329,"I'd much rather have had them :

* emergency approve the vaccine for children (free)

9367,"According to contact tracing studies, the day of symptom onset typically coincide with peak infectiousness (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5) Considering people often get tested a few days before the event/results, the chances that testing can pick up an actively infectious case seem very low."

9478,&gt;Even though you can still catch Covid after being double vaccinated?

9480,"You are much, much less likely to do so than someone who has a BMI of 20."
9481,"Banning the unvaccinated doesn't mean that there is suddenly zero risk of COVID; but the vaccinated catch COVID less frequently, and have milder symptoms for less time, even if they have similar viral loads."
9482,"That means:

1."
9483,"Vaccinated travellers feel safer and are more likely to buy tickets;
2."
9484,"The airline isn't taking on any unnecessary risk by allowing unvaccinated travellers (who have more chance of being infected, and remaining infected, spreading disease to others);
3."
9485,"The airline is less likely to be sued by passengers who do get sick, because they have taken precautions - and any passengers who get sick will also be less likely to suffer serious consequences, meaning that they will be less inclined to bother suing, and any payout would be less if the airline were found liable)."
9486,"So in this case, by banning the unvaccinated, the airline gets to have happier customers spending more money, is less likely to see its flights cancelled due to being super-spreader events, and is less likely to get sued after the fact."
9487,"Why is it that you seem to think that there is either risk, or there isn't: and until you've eliminated all risk, anything you do is worthless?"

9579,They had a meeting a week ago about concerns from parents and teachers about Covid where the school Superintendent and principle both said they had no evidence that Covid infections in students and teachers were from school exposure so they wouldn't be changing any policies.
9580,Her daughter was diagnosed with Covid yesterday.
9581,She called to tell her boss who told her unless she had a positive test she better be in for work.
9582,She will be having her mother who's in her 60s take care of her Covid positive daughter while she's at work then take over at home before returning to teach over 30 students in an overcrowded classroom.

10348,I disagree.
10349,I appreciate the view and totally understand it.
10350,But I see most of the antivaxxers as people who are suffering from mental illness... and unfortunately we live in societies that basically offer zero assistance for people with mental illness until they do something truly crazy like walk around the neighborhood naked.
10351,The antivaxxers are a product of modern society and it's refusal to adequately address the issue of mental health.
10352,I'm all for imposing restrictions on them to try and get them to behave through simple behavioral conditioning... and I'm even okay with triaging care and deprioritizing them when needed... but outright denying them access to care?
10353,That goes a tad too far if you subscribe to the view that they are mentally unstable and not fully in control of their actions.
10354,7 times the world population and Covid is much deadlier than the flu.

It‚Äôs really dumb and a terrible comparison."
10358,"Marek‚Äôs disease is a heroes virus and causes persistent infection and vaccine only stops disease not infection, so the virus replicates indefinitely which leads to mutation."

10423,Utter SCUM.
10424,I think that's just how she processes information/metrics in her profession and probably didn't think to translate it for people that wouldn't understand.
10425,For example some call centers you are measured in seconds.
10426,"This is unbelievable, as a country with the so called ""freedom"" how is possible to ask the courts TO KNOW DATA... this looks like a communist country like Nicaragua Cuba....."
10427,"&gt;One current high school kid had the best take: ""what is wrong with you people?"
10428,"You're supposed to be the adults!"""
10429,There's an adult there.
10430,Everyone else are bunch of toddlers.
10431,"The weirdest thing about this pandemic to me has been how the kids have been surprisingly level-headed and adaptable to everything thrown their way and somehow, over and over again, it‚Äôs been the parents who are complete assholes."
10432,"That kid has a lot more patience than I do with these people, at this point."
10433,My grandpa died in Tennessee from COVID in November 2020 and we haven't even been able to have our memorial service for him because two of his idiot daughters still aren't vaccinated - I don't think I would've been sitting through the rest of that meeting.
10434,I have no kindness left.
10435,If this was a military conflict that would be a war crime.
10436,I think we can do better
10437,"&gt;  I'm not sure what you people get out of ""Umm actually?"
10438,"There's no hope..."" shit."
10439,"There's a pretty big gulf between ""there's no hope"" and ""COVID is here to stay and while vaccines will save lots of lives, it's not going to be something put behind us forever""."
10440,Someone ‚Äúfamous‚Äù had to say it.
10441,Everyone on Reddit is already saying it at least.
10442,We are all just mostly random unknown usernames.
10443,Makes sense.
10444,Polio is 4 shots.
10445,DTaP is 5.
10446,"I'm hoping it's 3 and done, but we may find out a 3rd offers more immunity, but antibodies just wane over time and we'll need yearly boosters."
10447,Moderna is working on a flu/covid combo 1 shot.
10448,"And if that's what the future will be going forward, I'm fine with that."
10449,If I feel crappy for a day Everytime I get a covid shot so be it.
10450,"Cause if I caught covid, I'd feel crappy for a lot longer, and arguably much sicker."
10451,"I‚Äôve admitted two patients who‚Äôve had breakthrough infections, but both were admitted for reasons other than COVID: one had severe anemia due to GI bleeding (he was also immunocompromised) and the other had blood clots in his lungs (but he had just had a recent surgery, which is a major risk factor for developing pulmonary emboli)"
10452,"""adults"""
10453,Unless MU or another variant that can evade vaccinations takes off and dominates the spread.
10454,Anyone know when Biden is speaking about covid today/tonight?
10455,"From an epidemiological perspective, obesity is as much a factor of poverty and culture as it is ‚Äúchoice‚Äù."
10456,"Hard to say someone doesn‚Äôt deserve to be treated because they live on poverty foods (Ramen) or were raised on poverty foods (red beans and rice, casseroles, processed foods rather than fresh veggies, etc.)."
10457,Plus there‚Äôs a whole sugar addiction / soda lobby to factor in there.
10458,Obesity sucks.
10459,That's 85% of ages 16+.
10460,Only around 65% of total population.
10461,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations
10462,It's the same shot - this is more about how our immune system responds to the vaccine.
10463,We have a few vaccines that we need to take 3 doses for to confer enough long lasting immunity.
10464,"There's a chance we will only need three of the same, but we're being cognizant of the incoming data to see."
10465,"It's not a binary thing either - it seems like lots of people are still doing great with two doses, even after a long time, but this is more about finding the sweet spot for as much of the population as possible"
10466,they aren't?
10467,Their deaths are well below any of the past waves they've had.

10475,You show proof of vaccination ?
10476,?
10477,What's the dose of this third shot?
10478,I was travelling for work through an airport the other day that was offering free vaccines to anyone who dared to walk up to the table (first shot Pfizer/Moderna only).
10479,The only thing that stopped me from getting a stealth booster was the fact that I didn't have an answer to this question.
10480,"It‚Äôs much easier to go out of your way once or twice depending on brand for a free vaccine than it is to go out of your way for every meal for more expensive, healthier food."
10481,Not everyone that is overweight made a single decision that made them that way.
10482,If it was one of their spawn being ridiculed it would be a whole different story though.
10483,its intense and scary as shit and exhausting
10484,"So vaccinated people have:

* 29.4117647% likelihood of getting infected vs unvaxxed
* If infected, 27.027027% likelihood of getting hospitalized vs unvaxxed
* If hospitalized, 17.2413793% likelihood of dying vs unvaxxed

Multiply those together, and vaccinated people have 1.37% the liklihood of dying of COVID vs unvaxxed person."
10485,[removed]
10486,"An Oregon Hospital director has already said that non-Covid patients have died because they couldn't get procedure / hospital beds in time, since the hospital is packed with long term Covid patients."
10487,And the COVID situation in Oregon is not nearly as bad as in some other states.
10488,"https://youtu.be/LU5HyKoAa20?t=457

The whole video gives great insight of what is going on right now in hospitals."
10489,Apparently not a developing country like the US.
10490,Or at least triage the unvaccinated behind other emergencies at the hospital.
10491,"I read stories everyday of bad outcomes for appendicitis, cardia, GI, etc patients."
10492,Like the kid with the appendix that burst in the waiting room after hours long wait.
10493,"‚ÄúLet our kids smile‚Äù (the signs), your kids aren‚Äôt going to smile much when they‚Äôre suffering through COVID, get them vaccinated (when they‚Äôre ready), and let them wear masks."
10494,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63rjQtP4Uo

Here is full meeting."
10495,"Kind of a dumb shit thing to say since we treat drug users, murderers, people at fault in dui accidents, etc."
10496,‚ÄúSomeone had to say it‚Äù lol
10497,"Yes, in my current job."
10498,Not sure what everyone else's situation is but would like to hear stories.
10499,"My understanding of my current sick leave is that if my sick leave runs out (for an example say I have 40 hrs of sick leave) from being put on a week of quarantine, that's it, I'm at zero."
10500,"This isn't even a hypothetical of me being sick, this a some kid bringing covid into my classroom."
10501,If two months later I get put on quarantine again I am still out of sick days because teachers only get x days per school year (varies per district).
10502,There is no CARES money this year to protect us.
10503,Last year we had 80 hrs of sick leave protection for covid specifically.
10504,"At the point where I hit zero and need days off, I am no longer meeting the stipulations of my teaching contract (x days per year worked), so my paycheck is docked."
10505,This year some districts will shrug and say you cannot prove you got covid at school.
10506,This hasn't played out in our district yet but I am hoping the union will push back more.
10507,"Oh wait, we teachers can only negotiate *wages* in Wisconsin because of that prick cyborg Scott Walker."
10508,This is related to wages for sure...but how it will actually play out has yet to be seen.
10509,"Not sure of the relevance, I wasn't talking % I was talking total dead."
10510,"Unfortunately, if you're the type to believe vaccines caused the surge, you're probably the type to ignore this study."
10511,It‚Äôs sad to say but they need to ration care and people who have covid and are unvaccinated should be sent home with recommendations to buy a ventilator and focus on cancer and other patients.
10512,"We already know that hospital tend to run on thin margin in terms of icu beds, let‚Äôs give those to really issues not related to covid."
10513,It‚Äôs been months since the vaccine has been available.
10514,"If they want to expose themselves, we can‚Äôt keep codlingthem."
10515,"And ""Percent of Vaccine Breakthrough Cases among Fully Vaccinated OK Residents"" is 0.42%."
10516,Just pointing out that the vaccines are very effective at preventing infection.
10517,[removed]
10518,Yeah.
10519,It asks that when you sign up for the appointment and they ask in person.
10520,It‚Äôs remarkable how few dissenting comments there are here.
10521,"Statistically, that‚Äôs quite odd"
10522,"‚ÄúPlays frogger on the highway‚Äù

Take my upvote"
10523,"""adults"""
10524,Do you mean exposed or infected?
10525,"Yes, probably a huge portion of the population will be exposed."
10526,However not everyone will be infected.
10527,"Breakthrough cases happen at around 1 in 10,000."
10528,So virtually all vaccinated people will not get infected.
10529,I think some non-vocal people are just afraid.
10530,I don‚Äôt think they should be denied care.
10531,"But anyone out campaigning against vaccines or masks should be encouraged, since it‚Äôs all fake, to sign voluntary  legal waivers stating they do not want treatment and want to be the last to be treated in a medically critical situation."
10532,"You know, as part of their schtick."
10533,"I mean, with the prevalence of delta it's going to do massive, irrecoverable harm to vaccination rates for the 0-12 cohort."
10534,"""My kids had it/probably had it so we're not gonna get the vaccine."""
10535,"That's what people are gonna say, just like a lot of qualifying adults have been saying (and then getting reinfected)."
10536,I imagine if random redditors can think that far ahead there are people within the FDA and CDC yelling and screaming about it but getting silenced.
10537,Hope those higher up in the foodchain that's refusing to budge realize that blood is on their hands.
10538,So a vaccinated person would have a .15% chance of hospitalization per year?
10539,"I'll take those odds, we're probably more likely to be hospitalized from car accidents at that point."

10546,How would they know if they‚Äôre vaccinated or not?
10547,It‚Äôs so sad because these stories are put out in many different media formats and still doesn‚Äôt move the needle.
10548,People that were anti vax telling others to get the vaccine.
10549,The region I live in is only 42% fully vaccinated.
10550,We have the highest death rate in the state.
10551,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, but very immunocompromised."
10552,When you hear of a breakthrough killing someone it‚Äôs either an immunocompromised or very old person.
10553,It‚Äôs scary.
10554,[removed]
10555,In spring of 2020 I was accepted into the nursing program at my college.
10556,I went to work full-time over the summer and never went back to go to the program.
10557,I was working pharmacy at that time at retail and at a hospital.
10558,I saw first hand what was happening and the lack of support.

10563,"It's a colloquialism that Nassau and Suffolk = LI, nothing more."
10564,"But you insisting it is totally clear is very NYC, I'll give you that."
10565,"For some reason I don't have a reply button under comments but for the top comment, if that lady is really a nurse I hope she gets fired and her file says why."
10566,She doesn't deserve to work in healthcare.
10567,Correct
10568,With hookers!
10569,And blackjack
10570,I thought he would too.
10571,I‚Äôm in ATL so people mostly behave with all the managers about.
10572,Lol
10573,[deleted]
10574,So that's why I'm confused why they would put them on unpaid leave rather than firing them.
10575,"I'm curious about the rationale, because it seems to have effectively the same result."
10576,"If calling out your poor commentary is dishonest, sure."
10577,Enjoy continuing to get downvoted with these hot takes.
10578,"Just remember not to open doors that are painted ""Dead inside"""
10579,Be cool if ACA coverage is denied or premiums skyrocket for those that HaVe rIgHts.

10584,*
10585,This isn‚Äôt the first time in the modern era children have had their learning interrupted for an extended period of time.
10586,There‚Äôs lots of studies suggesting that many of those children experienced lower lifetime earnings and more legal trouble than other children with similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
10587,[removed]
10588,If you only require for those entering you are missing a lot of people.
10589,"Canada requires full vaccination for domestic air/rail travelers (those entering Canada are still required to quarantine and test, with those fully vaccinated exempt from the quarantine and later testing)."
10590,[removed]
10591,Yes.
10592,Back when that subreddit was information and not disinformation.
10593,I was there too!
10594,I would disagree.
10595,Some religious exemptions are fairly minor in their actual impact and pose little issue.
10596,"I‚Äôm from the UK where Sikhs have some religious exemptions specific to them, such as the kirpan being exempt from offensive weapons laws around public knife carrying or an exemption from wearing a helmet when riding motorcycles."
10597,"Neither of these have posed any real problems- the kirpan is a non-issue as Sikhs treat these as highly important items for their faith and do not use it lightly in any situation, whilst the amount of Sikh motorcyclists is so small that it‚Äôs really irrelevant, and those that do ride will often make arrangements themselves which allow them to wear helmets anyway."
10598,[removed]
10599,"Damn, they sent the shit ones we don't want."
10600,"In other viruses (not vaccines), they promote the formation of antibodies against cytokines, disrupting the immune response."
10601,"In theory, whole-virus vaxxes can do this, but mRNA and J&amp;J cannot."
10602,They don't possess the necessary genes.
10603,"May be late and buried, but I want to provide some insight from an HR perspective."
10604,"While both Title VII and ADA have an accommodation requirement, the level of impact an accommodation has on the business required for it to be an undue hardship is much lower for religious accommodations than it is for ADA accommodations."
10605,For religious accommodation they only have to prove it will have a more than de minimus cost or burden.
10606,"In this case, it may be possible to United to prove that the only reasonable accommodation they can provide is remote work for those able to work remotely, and unpaid leave for those unable to worn remotely - since it could be considered an issue regarding workplace safety."
10607,[removed]
10608,[removed]
10609,Same.
10610,"Back in April, my partner and I drove over an hour away for our appointments."
10611,Totally worth it.
10612,"That‚Äôs why over a hundred years ago one of their founders came up with the idea of 2 classes of JWs: those bound for heaven (144,000) and the rest which will live forever on a paradise earth."
10613,"Actually, the first iteration of that teaching was that JWs would be the heavenly class and everyone not a JW would be the earthly class."
10614,"Once the number of JWs exceeded 144,000, they had to change their theology."
10615,This time it morphed into the idea that only JWs will survive Armageddon and everyone else alive when Armageddon happens will be murdered by their vengeful god.
10616,"If you were lucky enough to die anytime before Armageddon started and you weren‚Äôt a JW, you will be resurrected into their paradise and be given a chance to ‚Äúchange your ways‚Äù and serve their god."
10617,"If you don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôre murdered by their vengeful god."
10618,Their theology could make for an interesting dystopian book/movie.

10621,ISWYDT.
10622,I think.
10623,"I don't know about other places, but in my state the already huge shortage would be much worse if they hadn't passed legislation temporarily allowing Educators to come out of retirement, and still recieve their pension on top of their full salary for this year."
10624,Even with that incentive some Teachers I know who were taking advantage of this opportunity were going to back out of their contract had our Governor not put a mask mandate in place.
10625,"Also, a lot of Teachers being hired with provisional licenses, very little preparation to under how to prepare lessons, know specific curriculum, etc.."
10626,Honestly?
10627,Not surprising in the least bit given how these anti maskers act in public.
10628,That student was brave and I‚Äôd be so proud if he were my son.
10629,These ‚Äúadults‚Äù mocking him are bottom barrel humans.
10630,"You're right about the world in general, but let's be honest: there aren't a lot of atheist libertarians in Murfreesboro, Tennessee."

10634,I flew Southwest over the weekend and was stuck in front of a man who was constantly coughing the entire flight.
10635,The fact that he even made it on a plane is just mind boggling to me.
10636,Thank fuck I'm vaccinated but I still need to check if I have covid ni thanks to his selfishness.
10637,Not flying southwest again until they get their shit together.
10638,As soon as one airlines mandates vaccines for passengers they've got a customer for life from me.
10639,No shit
10640,I don't think it'll get much worse than it is now.
10641,It just seems like the slow rise in cases in the Great Lakes states + New England isn't a fluke.
10642,"Somewhat seasonal, sure, but many of these areas have widespread vaccination and natural immunity from prior serious spikes."
10643,"Seems like these ""things will get bad"" predictions are assuming that covid will just naturally follow the yearly holidays explosion, and I think that's being accepted too easily."
10644,"It already exploded last year and again this year, and the virus isn't changing *that* quickly."
10645,It hasn't outrun immunity yet.
10646,I don't think it has anywhere left to go.

10659,"Good thing we‚Äôre actually making fun of the anti-maskers, not freedom."
10660,"No, kids don‚Äôt usually laugh at kids sharing their story of losing their grandmother."
10661,This group of antivax folks rallying against kids trying to protect themselves are just broken people.
10662,Speak your words.
10663,Great kid!
10664,I live in this county and I was watching this meeting live.
10665,My daughter attends the same school as the young man pictured as well as some of the other young adults that spoke up that night.
10666,I am in awe of those kids for speaking their truth.
10667,I am embarrassed for the lady behind him and the other adults who were there that were acting like children.
10668,The school board did say that they will be giving him a formal apology at the next meeting.
10669,Side note: this was a special-called meeting to vote on masking in the schools.
10670,The board did not vote that night.
10671,They had a work session meeting last night and personally I think they are scared to vote.
10672,So many of these meetings are ending in chaos.
10673,They don't want to be on national news...too late.
10674,How are they fired?
10675,When were they fired?
10676,They are just on unpaid leave.
10677,"What university are you referring to as fake and what makes it fake, especially as it pertains to nursing?"
10678,**Request for information: Can anybody direct me to resources which will allow me to calculate age and health-status adjusted risks associated with: (a) catching COVID-19; and (b) taking the COVID-19 vaccine(s)?
10679,"**

Before taking the vaccine, I think it's reasonable for me to be reassured that the benefits outweigh the risks."
10680,"Unfortunately, whilst it's easy to find score of articles regurgitating the same ""Medical professionals say the benefits of the vaccines far outweigh the risks for most people"", I've found it very difficult to find any resources which actually allow me to calculate those risks and perform that comparison myself."
10681,"I'm *particularly* eager to do this because I'm fairly certain that I already caught and recovered from covid right at the start of the pandemic (unverified because testing wasn't widely available at that point, but the symptoms matched pretty perfectly), which I believe considerably alters my risk profile (by massively reducing my chances of reinfection/hospitalisation/death, and [increasing the likelihood of adverse effects of the vaccine](https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/vaccine-after-effects-more-common-in-those-who-already-had-covid))."
10682,"To quickly summarise, I am:

 * 28 years old
 * Male
 * White
 * 186cm
 * 80kg
 * No known comorbidities
 * Very healthy lifestyle (vegetarian diet, cardio+resistance exercise every day, non-smoker)

I would love to be able to enter that type of information somewhere to calculate my risk of hospitalisation or death due to covid, and my risk of side effects or death due to the vaccine."
10683,"In the former case, the [QCovid](https://qcovid.org/) risk calculator is almost exactly what I'm looking for, except for the fact that it's based on data published in the first few months of the pandemic only."
10684,"I can't find anything remotely similar for the vaccines, other than [fact-checking articles](https://fullfact.org/online/risk-children-death-covid/) describing some of the risks without any age/health status adjustment."
10685,"Neither allows for adjustment by previous infection status either, which is perhaps even more important."
10686,"Based on those two (limited) sources, I can calculate that - even if I'm mistaken about being previously infected - I have a 1 in 333,333 risk of dying due to covid, compared with a 1 in 92,000 risk of dying due to blood clots due to the vaccine (a risk which I guess increases when you take into account a second jab, a third booster, etc)."
10687,"Based on that alone, I already feel justified in saying that **for me personally** the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits (I accept that the risk profile is very different for different people), and that therefore refusing the vaccine is the rational decision."
10688,"However, I'm willing and eager to update that conclusion based on new and better data sources, if they exist."
10689,"So can anybody point me in the right direction, and convince that getting the vaccine is actually the more rational decision?"
10690,I was told my Pfizer vax was shedding and causing others to get it.

10709,aah you hurt my feelings
10710,"My 6 month anniversary will come after 9/20, but if they're not approved by the time I hit 6 months I'm getting it anyway."
10711,The CDC/FDA is fighting so hard to keep throwing vaccines away when we could be using them for boosters.
10712,https://archive.vn/owe3r
10713,The whole idea of taking preemptive action to prevent disease is fundamentally incompatible with Christianity.
10714,"If God is all-powerful and benevolent, he will protect the believers."
10715,"Or if the believers die, God had decided it was their time."
10716,Getting a vaccine when you're perfectly healthy demonstrates that you don't really believe in the omnipotence and benevolence of God and are afraid that God will not protect you.
10717,"Yes, it's logically unsound."
10718,But it is the fundamental belief of millions.
10719,This is a 2016 article.
10720,California got rid of personal belief exemptions 6/30/2015.

10722,It's definitely what they are thinking.
10723,"It's what they were thinking when they went ""no masks needed if you're vaccinated!"""
10724,when delta was looming too.
10725,Idk why they keep acting like people don't have access to the internet and they're the only source of information.
10726,They know about the boosters lmao
10727,I think you have something there.
10728,Why do we want to go backwards?
10729,"The ""normal"" we all seem to miss was the collection of circumstances that made the pandemic more of an absolute horrorshow than it had to be."
10730,"""Normal"" was when there was inadequate financial aid for people put out of work."
10731,"""Normal"" was understaffing hospitals and underpaying the staff."
10732,"""Normal"" was dependence on fragile global supply chains."
10733,"Fuck that, I don't want to go *back* to normal; I want society to learn some fucking lessons from this whole experience and develop a new, better normal."
10734,"Is it plausible that vaccinated people who are living life like it‚Äôs prepandemic, could ultimately be better protected from future infection since they are more likely to exposed to virus overtime."
10735,"In doing so, it increases their antibodies while still having the benefit of likely being protected by the vaccine."
10736,"Whereas, if you just got vaccinated and didn‚Äôt have any contact with the virus since then, wouldn‚Äôt your antibodies be weaker?"
10737,"I‚Äôm not saying this is true, I‚Äôm simply asking if this is a plausible scenario."
10738,We already know that not everyone will do their part.
10739,"The Karens along with their male and non binary entitled counterparts will continue to scream over masks, social distancing and vaccines just like they have the entire time."
10740,Firing someone from their job comes to mind.
10741,That's not typical; you may have something else going on.
10742,People who report weird changes to their taste in food report those changes as their sense of smell/taste comes back after having completely lost it.
10743,"If you didn't lose your sense of smell/taste, you will not have changes like these as a result of covid."
10744,It‚Äôs a good point.
10745,Just blame without education seems unlikely to help.
10746,But if the system can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt move to stop disinformation then the last line of defense ends up being ordinary citizens.
10747,By default.
10748,Prepared or not the burden shifts to them.
10749,We haven't either although I kinda wonder if it's part of the reason we're back to max telework.
10750,"Concluding sentences:

PCA analysis revealed that the COVID-19 cases are closely correlated with the humidity."
10751,A more detailed analysis of different parts of the country is required and various analysis techniques are required to understand the environmental factors' roles in the spread of COVID-19.

10758,Funny enough never in my life was I so happy to get a shot.
10759,Like after I got my vaccine on my way home I got the best Chinese food in my area as a celebration.
10760,I fucking hate shots too.
10761,Like me getting a flu shot is usually something I will put off for a while.
10762,But as soon as I was able too I got my covid vaccine.
10763,"It seems so pervasive now, prior to covid, we were blissfully tolerating antivaxxers that blamed anything bad that happened in their lives to vaccines without a shread of evidence, and zero correlation."
10764,The lie is repeated so often that many have fallen victim into believe it themselves.
10765,"And that is what it is at this point, *a belief*, not grounded in reality: if someone stopped believing in *gravity* would they *float away into the sky*."

10775,"I can't really say for sure whether it would be any better to get Moderna for the third dose vs Pfizer, but just noting that Moderna was testing using the 50ug amount as their booster, which is the same as their second dose amount vs 100ug which would have been the first dose amount."
10776,"This is just my opinion, but I think probably the biggest part over which one you choose is just getting the third dose of either ~three or more months after the first two were done as it seems to trigger another good immune response to help ensure longer lasting/stronger protection."
10777,"I equate it to the same reason pretty much all childhood immunizations have 3-4 total shots, with the last dose usually being a few months after the previous ones."
10778,"I'm sure a lot of testing went into those childhood ones to determine that schedule, and unfortunately due to the dire urgency these COVID ones had to be rushed out without that same luxury, but you can probably assume the same logic for both."
10779,Personally I don't think you'd be giving up any protection going with Pfizer for the third dose though.
10780,"I did take the semi-quantitative antibody test that Labcorp offers right at three weeks after my third Pfizer dose just to see if my antibody levels were high, and while those numbers don't prove any certain level of protection, my count was above the highest threshold they test for so I felt more confident after seeing that."
10781,"There have been a good bit of recent studies done that have correlated persons having higher antibody levels with being much less likely to end up with severe symptoms/being hospitalized, and in some cases being totally asymptomatic as the antibodies/immune system were able to neutralize the virus before it replicate too much and cause the severe issues."

10817,Or maybe they are just upset that Israel is figuring out stuff with boosters before they are.

10833,"My coworker told me he thinks the covid surge is because vaccinated people (like me) are getting sick, but not showing symptoms, and spreading it to the innocent antivaxxers (like him)"
10834,And now we have yet another instance of kids stepping forward to demand that adults act like adults.

10843,I once spent 5 days in hospital in Canada including a day in ICU.
10844,Out of pocket cost was about $5.00 for the vending machine.

10846,"That said, Covid is putting an incredible strain on hospitals as well as on the public health care system."

10848,"Yeah... that's truly ""capitalism"" when states are giving high effective preventive protection against deadly disease for free to citizens, even in countries without general free health care."
10849,And I am pretty sure that virus is choosing victims only  by his/her economic-political belief.
10850,";-)

10861,[removed]
10862,It is September.
10863,My point was Israel‚Äôs metrics are worse now than same time last year.
10864,When October is finished we can compare the full wave.
10865,"Israel is currently going down, which is good, and I hope they stay down."
10866,But deaths peaked Oct 14th last year in Israel.
10867,"Well let's not pretend seeing people's facial expressions isn't important to learning, especially in foreign language education but obviously in these circumstances, we have to adapt for the betterment of everyone."

10902,I have heard that from a few people now as well.
10903,"Like wait it's my fault I took the vaccine, maybe caught covid because I can enjoy life again because I am protected from covid but passed it on to you who is unvaccinated and get sick because you are unvaccinated?"
10904,But it's my fault because I did the smart thing?

10907,?
10908,What's worse is the spike in hospitalizations among kids.
10909,Up 5-10x since mid June.
10910,"Basically the same percentage of kids who get the Delta Variant will go to the hospital or die as with previous variants, but since Delta spreads so much easier a lot more kids are getting it so the cumulative pediatric hospitalization rate is much higher."
10911,I personally believe the fact that we protected kids so much more last year plays a role in this too.
10912,'Vaccination status' is something else that lost protection too.

10915,No shit sherlock
10916,"Given the recent exponential rises in cases that we've seen in highly-vaccinated countries, I'm not convinced that the vaccines are particularly effective in limiting infections/transmissions (whilst they **are** clearly effective in reducing the risk of hospitalisation/death for vulnerable people)."

10923,"Not only would it not reinfect after burning through, but the virus would mutate to become less deadly and not be a problem."

10925,Fully vaccinated people represent 44.7% of the state but were only 5.08% of August cases.
10926,"Reminder that when someone says ""the vaccine doesn't prevent you from becoming infected, it only prevents you from being hospitalized or dying,"" they're grifting."
10927,"That goes for you too Zero Covid-ers, not just anti-vaxxers."
10928,"&gt;Same bro, exact same situation as you."
10929,"The way the article writes about her is a bit confusing but seems at least she is encouraging others to get vaccinated, despite that."
10930,"I woke up this morning with a sore throat, and I had some dry coughs starting before bed last night."
10931,I am scheduled to get my second dose of Pfizer today.
10932,Should I postpone it now due to these symptoms?
10933,I don‚Äôt want to overwork my immune system.
10934,"These are all current, and so there hasn't been time for the kids to get to their final outcomes."
10935,The relationship between testing scores and adult outcomes are like that between cholesterol levels and heart attacks.
10936,"One often predicts the other, but not always."
10937,We actually will need to wait a couple of years after things get back to normal in order to see whether kids can catch up.
10938,My original statement stands: we have absolutely zero evidence that kids won't catch up from this delay.
10939,Eh idk.
10940,Everyone old enough to get the vaccine in my household is fully vaxxed and I still worry about it.
10941,I have friends whose breakthrough infections have still made them pretty sick and miserable.
10942,[deleted]
10943,[removed]
10944,That's correct.
10945,"That's why we're insisting on masks, even for the vaccinated."
10946,"You could be contagious as a vaccinated person, and never show symptoms."
10947,The vaccine is like a seat belt.
10948,"It protects you in an accident, and greatly reduces your chances of severe injury and death considerably, but it can't save you 100% of the time."
10949,"In all seriousness, I disagree."
10950,"Some masks are effective, in particular, N95s, and to a lesser extent, KN95s."
10951,Even surgical masks likely still impact transmissibility.
10952,"To your point, if vaccines are that effective, asking everyone to mask up speaks more to concerns about delta's high R0 than the vaccines not being effective."
10953,"Even if a cloth mask is only 20% effective, that's still better than no mask."
10954,"And if there is a lessened but still possible risk of infection and transmission in breakthroughs, then it's our duty to mask up to protect others."
10955,"Unless people are not masking properly, then I got both, because I see plenty of that."
10956,That is bananas.
10957,"My kids' district has a mask mandate and is following all other recommended mitigations and they are averaging about 8-10 cases per week total, out of a district of 5000."
10958,One interesting thing I've noticed is literally every single case but one has been out of my son's highschool (where all the kids are old enough to be vaccinated).
10959,Only one case that I'm aware of so far from my daughter's elementary.
10960,"Well , ill just share my experience."
10961,I started having body ache and then soon low grade fever.
10962,So from that moment I decided to isolate or wear the face mask a wildcraft w95 ( which is a N95 mask like).
10963,"I drove to the testing center and mom was also with me , as she was also exposed with the infected person."
10964,As she dint show signs of symptoms both of us had mask and i kept the car windows door.
10965,I tested positive and mom was negative on PCR test .
10966,"Its sad , we just can't wear a mask properly for few months and nor the govts working on good ventilation systems in crowed places or even schools."
10967,I'm from India.
10968,I had covid last year in September end .

10970,Like a month ago there was a study showing most pediatric cases were a result of unvaccinated parents giving it to kids.
10971,"So basically, unvaccinated parent gets kid sick, kid goes to school spreads it to.others, those kids get their families sick, the cycle continues."
10972,"Do I also sound like the sort of person who wants to make sure that the medical intervention that I'm facing a considerable amount of government force and social pressure to ""consent"" to is actually in my best interest?"
10973,You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself be the villain
10974,They are doing that in NY.
10975,"I live in Tennessee, just north of Nashville."
10976,My SO is a teacher in a local school system.
10977,Their lack of care for anything related to Coronavirus is laughable at best.
10978,They will do anything in their power to both not mandate masks and to give the illusion that there are measures in place to mitigate the spread of the virus.
10979,One of the funniest measures was they announced they'd run HVAC on the weekends.
10980,Which they still don't.
10981,Soooooooo.....
10982,we‚Äôre going to see the death rate spike in these places.
10983,"My company has the same base policy, but ours goes a little further."
10984,"All vaxxed employees are getting a $50 per paycheck bonus for the next 20 pay cycles, and unvaccinated employees are required to pay 25% of their healthcare costs where vaccinated employees pay 0%."
10985,[removed]
10986,"After the first full week of Schools being open in my county, wich followed a partial week, more than 10% of the student population was qaurintined, and about 10% of them have tested positive."
10987,Per our state guidelines vaccinated students only have to be qaurintined if they have symptoms.
10988,"Also, students who were exposed, but asymptomatic don't have to be tested unless they report symptoms."
10989,So basically we don't know how high the real numbers for positive tests are because a lot of parents don't get their exposed kids tested because then the whole family has to qaurintine.
10990,They also rely on parents voluntarily calling the Schools to report positive tests.
10991,"There is a vocal contigent in my community that doesn't believe their kids should have to be tested or qaurintine unless they are severely ill, and also think kids with positive test results should not have to miss any in person learning."
10992,We need mandates.
10993,"It's no different than how we have seatbelt laws, or other laws that involve participating in society."
10994,"For example, with no seatbelt on, you can become a human projectile that kills someone else."
10995,You can harm others/spread Covid unvaccinated and no mask.

11130,*N95 masks.
11131,Not just surgical masks.
11132,Edit: I thought this was a different study.
11133,This article compares surgical masks (pink/blue/yellow) to cloth masks.
11134,"11% vs 5% protection‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt call 11% ‚Äúhighly effective,‚Äù which is why I thought it was the other study about N95s‚Ä¶"
11135,The idea is: no one knows how many people are exposed to covid.
11136,We only know how many people test positive.
11137,Therefore it makes sense to calculate relative likelihood (vaccinated VS unvaccinated) instead of absolute likelihood (we don't know true exposure numbers).
11138,So the end result is something like: for every 5 people who test positive 4 are unvaccinated and 1 is vaccinated.
11139,Assuming these people had the same exposure odds on average means you're measuring the efficacy of the vaccine.
11140,"About half as effective, but the numbers aren't good."
11141,"&gt;The study linked surgical masks with an 11% drop in risk, compared with a 5% drop for cloth."
11142,That finding was reinforced by laboratory experiments whose results are summarized in the same preprint.
11143,"The data show that even after 10 washes, surgical masks filter out 76% of small particles capable of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, says Mushfiq Mobarak, an economist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and a co-author of the study."
11144,"By contrast, the team found that 3-layered cloth masks had a filtration efficiency of only 37% before washing or use."
11145,Lol die
11146,"The results we've seen is that vaccination greatly reduces the rate that you can catch the Delta variant (even if at a reduced rate versus the original strains) and it also reduces the number of days that you are fully contagious (you do hit the same levels of the virus as an uninfected person, but that drops much faster then it does in an unvaccinated person)."
11147,"Between just those two, which are relatively low cost measures to society, we'd be done."
11148,If we had close to 85% vaccine compliancy we'd be good.

11225,"But at this point it's not enough, and the pandemic will persist even if 70% of people do their part."
11226,Additionally what happened to me will likely happen to others.
11227,I got COVID despite double vaccination.
11228,I first tested negative.
11229,I then spread it to a bunch of people - all of whom were vaccinated.
11230,By the time I tested positive and quarantined it was too late as I had infected a few people that I knew and probably many others which I didn't know - because I had no symptoms and tested negative.
11231,"The vaccines DO work but because of the mild symptoms or no symptoms, and the ability of the vaccinated to spread the disease, we're beyond the slogan of ""if everyone would just get vaccinated""."
11232,The only real solution is a worldwide complete and total lockdown for 1 month.
11233,Well here in Jersey pretty much everyone treats things like back to normal anyway cause so many of us are vaccinated.
11234,Sure you gotta wear a mask sometime but whatever at least we can go to the club
11235,That's right.
11236,"Israel started strong then halted, likely because a lot of heavily religious people didn't elect to take the vaccine."
11237,So it stopped around 60%.
11238,"Now millions more are getting their third shot, but how many new people are getting their first shot?"
11239,Arguably it's more important for these no-dose people to become double-dosed.
11240,That and allowing kids to take it.
11241,"Yep, Pfizer"
11242,A lot of schools just opened.
11243,It varies by region.
11244,Like where I am in the South school has been open for about 6 weeks.
11245,I have a friend in the northeast whose child has only been attending school for 2 weeks tomorrow.
11246,"Keeping kids out of school stopped the spread which, in turn, helped stopped the development of variants."
11247,"But, because so many people aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet (including children), the virus has been allowed to spread and the variants are gaining traction."
11248,"The Delta variant developed into a stronger, more spreadable, and deadlier variant."
11249,And here we are‚Ä¶.
11250,The same happened to me and I mentioned to my GP that I think there could be a link between the vaccine and he laughed at me and ignored it!
11251,This happened way back in April.
11252,"Last I heard, about 10 percent of my co workers got vaccinated."
11253,There needs to be a mandate coming down from big retail companies requiring a vaccination for all employees and vendors.
11254,"Thousands of people come in and out of here, and I'm sure it's being spread in the store."

11282,"From what I understand, there's still mixed evidence that delta is more dangerous for kids (or anyone, really)."
11283,"The real problem is that it's more transmissible, so even if the virulence is exactly the same, it gives the appearance of being more dangerous because you have higher case counts and more chances of negative outcomes."

11286,"The risk of infection at the single game is low relative to the benefit to a person getting vaccinated, which greatly reduces the risk."

11325,Why are kids no longer so strong against covid virus?
11326,At the start of the pandemic they were tough and strong and they were able to defeat the microorganisms in their bodies one individual virus t at a time.

11346,That's simply not true.
11347,They included clinical trials in their research but they don't relate to Ivermectin treating COVID-19..
11348,The first source is about a clinical trial for Dexamethasone.
11349,The 2nd source looks at Zika virus.
11350,"The 3rd source looks at a study for treating Ascaris, an intestinal parasite."
11351,"If you don't believe me scroll to the bottom of the ""meta analysis"" and click on the links."
11352,If you pre-select patients without certain pre-existing conditions or with certain blood oxygen levels who are safe enough to get Ivermectin in a trial then it makes sense that those patients would have better results than the general population across all severity of the disease.
11353,That does not in any way mean that Ivermectin is an effective treatment.
11354,But many of these studies don't even look at Ivermectin or COVID-19.

11399,So a bunch of unvaccinated 10 year olds and a bunch of vaccinated 80 year olds aren't expected to have the same risk of hospitalization to begin with.
11400,It's perfectly possible that the 80 year old had a 10x greater chance of hospitalization to begin with and the 90% effective vaccine reduced that chance to the same as the 10 year olds.

11524,I think it's just talking about inverse multiplication.
11525,N times less likely is equal to multiplying by 1/N.
11526,To get a true measure of effectiveness you have to go by age brackets.

11611,4x less likely means that for every 4 unvaccinated people who contract COVID 1 vaccinated person will.
11612,"Phrasing it differently, such as saying that the vaccinated are one quarter as likely to be infected as the unvaccinated, is awkward and harder to understand"
11613,I don‚Äôt understand the argument.
11614,People with the vaccine can still spread the disease.
11615,"(I‚Äôve been vaxed)

The Pfizer six month study showed vax and unvaxed has similar viral loads - so either way they could spread to customers or each other."
11616,There is a much reduced risk of hospitalization and death with a vax‚Ä¶.. is this just to reduce insurance costs?
11617,"If someone has a religious exemption, I wouldn‚Äôt think insurance costs would be a reason you could fire them‚Ä¶ example religious group X costs too much to cover in our health plan‚Ä¶ fire them!"
11618,I don‚Äôt think that would work.
11619,Again- get vaccinated if your doctor and you think it‚Äôs a good idea!!!!
11620,It helps keep you alive.
11621,But I don‚Äôt understand the justification of the mandates given the science doesn‚Äôt support vaccines reduce the viral load‚Ä¶.

11878,"**Once testing positive** a vaxxed person has a 3.2% chance of going to the hospital, versus a 7.6% chance for an unvaxxed, according to an Aug 24 report by the CDC [see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e5.htm ]."
11879,"The rest of the efficacy when you see quotes like 75% and 99% is coming from the other benefits of the vaccine, like reduced infections/etc."

11888,Yes we looked into this last year at different locations.
11889,I started reading about covid early on in Reddit and started calling her team in February asking to move up her MRI but they didn‚Äôt have any openings.
11890,If she was older/an adult we would have felt more comfortable.
11891,The issue is since she‚Äôs so little they have to stop her breathing during it to get specific imaging.
11892,Thankfully she has been doing well so if the MRI is delayed we won‚Äôt be as panicked as last year.
11893,So thankful you were able to get it outside of the hospital!
11894,These are things people don‚Äôt think of when the hospitals get full of covid patients.
11895,"Unfortunately, despite the name of the country our system of government isn't really designed to act in a unified way on most things."
11896,"Stuff like this is an inefficient mess by design, and you'd have to alter the Constitution to provide some greater federal response to any sort of public health crisis."
11897,How are they 'overwhelmed' if no one is showing up?
11898,My neighbor was supposed to have knee surgery this week.
11899,The hospital cancelled it - too many covid cases so elective surgeries are on hold again.

11924,I don't think there is a chance he pushes isolation and tracking at a governmental level.
11925,"Even NSW in Australia has basically given up on that and they only have around 1,000 cases a day."
11926,"It just isn't practical with how fast Covid spreads, even more so with Delta."
11927,Heard something about as early as Oct 18th I think but not sure
11928,The US could've been enjoying normalcy for a long time now if everyone had done their part.
11929,Or give us an update about the vaccine for kids.
11930,"They keep giving different dates and different opinions and nobody in the FDA, CDC, etc."
11931,seem to be focused on that.
11932,"I want to at least hear, ""we met with Pfizer and Moderna and they gave us these exact dates for when they'll wrap up this current round of clinical trials."""
11933,"This nonsense of, ""Well, maybe we'll have some vaccines for some kids under 12 maybe in the winter..."" isn't sufficient."
11934,Pfizer at least should have been approved back in July instead of the FDA dragging their heels and telling Pfizer to conduct new clinical trials.

11937,People are over estimating the practical impact of mask mandates based on how they are implemented here in the US.
11938,"Here in Washington DC, which is very liberal, masks are required for indoor settings."
11939,"However, they aren't required in bars/dance clubs when drinking and when eating and drinking in restaurants."
11940,I go to the all inclusive section of Washington Nationals games and even the staff don't always wear masks.
11941,"At the gym, my trainer showed me how to get a mask that has filters and then remove the filters to make it easier to breath while working out (which apparently still meets the legal definition of a mask)."
11942,"It's not that masks don't have an impact, however, the impact is tiny compared to vaccination."
11943,"For people that are high risk, they should be taught to wear high quality masks that are fitted properly (will be interesting to see if this is mentioned today in Biden's release)."
11944,Yes.
11945,Vaccines are the small stuff.
11946,We have religions that forbid walking into hospitals.
11947,"Incidentally, they also support child marriages."
11948,Girls as young 14 die from pregnancy complications and aren't allowed to go to hospitals.
11949,Not every metric is worse.
11950,You've left out a fairly crucial metric in determining the progress of a pandemic.
11951,"Last summer's outcome of cases: \~4.5% deaths

11960,Family culture is different outside the US and Western Europe.
11961,"People who have successfully convinced an anti-vax loved one to get the jab, how did you do it?"

11965,I'd have to spend more time than I'm willing to get a better answer.
11966,That is a very fair point.
11967,I was not clear in my implication there.
11968,"I suppose it could be more focused to say that most of the anti-vaxxers I know who consider themselves ""reasonably healthy and somewhat in-shape"" very much are not."
11969,"To clarify, vaccinations do fall under a description of ""healthcare you've received"" that is protected by HIPAA."
11970,Dr. Scarlet couldn't go around telling people that Colonel Mustard is vaccinated for covid but is late for his tetanus booster or post an internet list of all her unvaccinated patients.
11971,"What people usually fail to understand is HIPAA doesn't apply to people who aren't medical providers, so people are allowed to ask for proof of vaccination or a waiver allowing them to access certain medical information for employment, education, and access to public areas."

11979,Delta seems to be ripping through the city here in NY.
11980,"Right now in the city, cases are less than half of what they were at the last peak, but deaths are very very low‚Ä¶ less than 20 per day (as opposed to hundreds per day at the last peak)."
11981,"While we‚Äôre not perfect, downstate NY is a pretty good example of how vaccines and masks can work when people do what‚Äôs right."
11982,"FYI: I am nervous about school starting, and the cold weather coming."
11983,"My first reaction to your Comment was ‚ÄúGTFO.‚Äù The comment is not designed to outrage, it‚Äôs an anecdote used as an example how religious people, specifically the group of evangelical Christians my in laws are in, in the United States have come to the conclusion that the Covid vaccine is against their religion."
11984,I included the part about Tylenol to illustrate that it was a slightly hypocritical position.
11985,"Instead, I think I‚Äôm just going to try and explain this to you because much like I was before I met my in-laws you‚Äôre probably just ignorant."
11986,"In the United States and I‚Äôm guessing other countries probably work the same way, but definitely in the United States it‚Äôs not like your religion point of view is handed down to you from one person."
11987,"Christians, specifically evangelical Christians go to church on Sunday listen to a sermon, then go to Bible studies throughout the week."
11988,"Bible studies are led by, sometimes pastors, but often just their fellow churchgoers."
11989,They all talk about Bible and current events and try and decide what their worldview is based on their interpretations of certain Bible verses that they think are applicable.
11990,"So when a bunch of people are sitting around and decide that they use the board and fetus cells despite the fact that they don‚Äôt really understand how that worked, and this is against their religion because they‚Äôre against abortion, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs decided that this vaccine is against their religion."
11991,Are they wrong?
11992,Objectively yes.
11993,They have no understanding of how any of this works.
11994,"They have zero understanding of science, and they are willfully ignorant of it and it‚Äôs working."
11995,If you try to explain it to them they shut down get angry at you and tell you something along the lines of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs right in the eyes of God‚Äú.
11996,"In conclusion, mostly because I don‚Äôt really know where I‚Äôm going with us, GTF oh‚Ä¶ Sorry"
11997,"&gt; The study in question was not published in a credible journal, nor was it hosted by an accredited, reputable institution."
11998,"In the decade since the study‚Äôs supposed 2011 publication, there has been little ‚Äî if any ‚Äî related research to confirm its findings."
11999,"Furthermore, a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told Snopes that infertility in men is not a known side effect of ivermectin and, as such, is not included in U.S. labeling requirements."
12000,"Come on, people."
12001,How better are you from those pedalling ivermectin for Covid if you're quoting such a dubious study?

12005,"The ""basic flu"" is a different thing every year, each Covid strain thus far has been slight variations of the same thing."
12006,"Even the ""worse"" Delta variant is the exact same virus it was last year but with more spike proteins on it, and the booster shots have just been ""more of the same vaccine"" that they haven't had to adjust at all."
12007,"Tuberculosis used to kill millions, too."
12008,We eventually got that shit handled to a large extent.
12009,There are countries with very diligent data about breakthrough cases.
12010,The USA isn't one of them.
12011,That doesn't mean we need to speculate about it.
12012,Breakthrough cases aren't uncommon.
12013,Breakthrough hospitalizations amongst the elderly aren't rare.
12014,"Vaccines are still very useful, but they aren't a silver bullet."
12015,"If you are very old and vaccinated, you might have the same risks now, in low vaccinated low compliance areas, simply because no one else is mitigating theirs in your environment."

12028,Good call!
12029,"I hope so too -- the other implication there is all these vaxxed, infected, but untested people are likely having pretty mild symptoms...unless they all think it's just a cold/allergies because they misunderstand vaccine efficacy on Delta."
12030,"Still, those are also mild symptoms."
12031,Hopefully some schools or other orgs that require weekly/bi-weekly student/employee testing might be able to give us some nice data here in the future.
12032,"I'm not really trying to downplay COVID, but he said their practice just wasn't seeing any COVID related hospitalizations."
12033,RSV on the other hand....
12034,Either way the bad part is the system isn't really designed to handle both.
12035,We are in Atlanta and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta has crazy wait times right now.

12042,"Let's apply your logic then:

So if an individual does not get the influenza vaccine every year, and that individual is hospitalized with influenza, you would say doctors should deny treatment?"
12043,The person I responded to didn‚Äôt say this.
12044,There comment was about them not gaining access to ICU resources if they didn‚Äôt get the vaccine.
12045,"Obviously things become different when you are actually out of ICU beds, are understaffed, and need to begin to ration care."
12046,"However, simply not choosing the vaccine would only maybe be part of the decision making process, and it would be small and rare."
12047,"If a car accident victim and an unvaccinated guy are contending for a spot in the ICU, and car accident guy has a 10% chance of making it, but unvaccinated guy is at an estimated 50-75% chance, then they‚Äôll get treatment."
12048,"Now sure, if a vaxxed person and an unvaxxed person are contending for the same spot, the vaxxed person should get it, but that‚Äôs also because they have higher odds of beating it."
12049,so I need to specify that what I write is only my opinion?
12050,"sorry that wasn't clear to you.. 

again, I don't believe it becomes an ethical issue if they have already refused care related to the same medical issue"

12157,I had no idea this was an issue.
12158,I'm intrigued to see what the research shows!

12160,I'm using the same method to calculate that number (6.0 times // 9.2 times) as the original data does.
12161,"It doesn't translate to 600%/920% 

This comment further down explains what that means:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkw8el/colorado_rolls_out_breakthrough_case_data_to_show/hc6tl3e/

If someone that knows how ""vaccine efficiency"" is calculated based on the above numbers (ie."
12162,"the ""vaccine is 95% effective at X"") I would love to know!"
12163,"No, that's not what anyone is saying."
12164,"But all things equal, two people who get COVID - one vaccinated and one not, data shows that the chances are monumentally higher than the unvaccinated one will have a much harder go of it than the vaccinated person."
12165,Data also show that vaccinated people in general have a much less severe course that takes less time and resources.
12166,Are there outliers?
12167,Sure.
12168,But you don't build policy around outliers.
12169,"If you have one staffed bed remaining and two people who are otherwise in similar health coming in equally sick from COVID and one is vaccinated and the other is not, the data overall is pretty clear as to which of those two people get it."

12241,It is a consistent correlation despite what the naysayers (or 'ivermectin' dosing NEIGH-sayers) would have us believe.
12242,"It has always been about reducing spread from the point of emission; if it was about filtering, there are some great powered air-purifying respirator options that cost less than a monocolonial antibody treatment, but those systems are best left for first responders and medical professionals in high risk environments."

12415,It's not dumbing it down.
12416,It's about knowing your audience and translating information into a common language.
12417,They can talk about and emphasize the importance of minutes in emergency care in the article while still writing the headline and content in a way that the average reader will easily understand.
12418,Excess deaths refer to those who die above the mean deaths of previous years.
12419,"This is different to crude death rate, which is all deaths recorded over a year."
12420,"Over time, if you sum crude death rates, for instance 1990-2019 you get a mean of how many people die yearly, and you can make predictions of how many people is expected to die given the dynamics and trends of the specific population under study."
12421,"When there are exceptional circumstances (a global pandemic, for instance) is when excess deaths and rates come into play, because more people die than the average of previous years, and so they are counted as atypical data not under the average, thus excess."
12422,New Zealand had an exemplary early response to the pandemic and the citizens took the same path of following guidelines and taking care of themselves.
12423,"Because of this, many deaths that would have been attributed to contagious diseases and social behaviours (car accidents, injuries, murders, etc) did not actually happen and less people died overall."
12424,"Note the drop is in excess deaths, and not crude death rates, so of course people still died."
12425,It‚Äôs already been addressed by the [Supreme Court](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/29/1032169566/the-u-s-has-a-long-precedent-for-vaccine-mandates).The Supreme Court affirmed that mandatory vaccinations are perfectly constitutional.
12426,"Yup, can confirm."
12427,Engineering position interview last week on Zoom and got straight up asked if I was fully vaccinated and could prove it.
12428,I am not sure he can legally make that effective at the state and local level?
12429,"I am a fan of this, though a lot of people are going to hate it."
12430,But it is clearly the best thing for the population and the country.
12431,"It looks like 64% of adults are currently vaccinated fully, so if this policy applies to 100 million people we can assume this will lead to somewhere around 35 million additional people getting vaccinated."

12444,This is ok in some areas for example some universities require either vaccination or testing once or twice a week and if you test positive you quarantine.
12445,"However, the tests are not always accurate and there is a delay between when you can get infected, get tested, and get your test results."
12446,"Essentially, it is far less reliable than vaccination to prevent spread and illness."

12457,"&gt;This is insanity 

Right?"
12458,We should have mandated vaccines 3 months ago when supply finally exceeded demand.
12459,"We could have saved 10s of thousands of lives that way, and gotten our schools, hospitals, businesses and economy fully back on track."
12460,This is how we got rid of smallpox and polio - government vaccine mandates.
12461,LFG
12462,It is only minuscule if you don‚Äôt get myocarditus.
12463,Not getting enough attention?
12464,"This whole situation has made me realize how fucking absurd it is that we've basically allowed people to frivolously decline modern medicine, still participate in society, and therefore prolong the existence of several diseases that could've been eradicated by now."

This is exactly my takeaway."
12475,Upon what is he basing that?
12476,There has been shown to be some waning immunity.
12477,"But there is no indication that the waning will continue, or that it will get worse."
12478,You probably don't need 24 tweets to show that if the effectiveness of the vaccine starts to decline precipitously after 6 months we're in trouble.
12479,"There are other theories that the effectiveness of the vaccine declines after 6 months and then stabilizes, and another theory that [it actually increases](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/08/30/1032520934/immunity-to-covid-19-could-last-longer-than-youd-think)."
12480,This seems like another case of jumping to conclusions.
12481,"I got my second Moderna dose all the way back in February, so I've been looking for a way to get a third hit just for fun (my 5G reception has been sooo good ever since the first two shots)."
12482,I'd rather not wait two more months and then try to get a booster when demand is high.
12483,"I'd wait a while longer if this were coming out soon but it sounds like [they haven't yet started trials for mRNA-1073, the combo vaccine](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-significant-advances-across-industry-leading), so I won't hope to see it until next flu season at the earliest."

And no.. you didn't like that source to see who reads it.. You posted it thinking it proved your point based on the abstract you read but it doesn't and proves you don't know what  you are talking about and continue to try and squirm out of it making up many excuses along the way making you look even worse."

12532,"Some people are asking how this is legal, so I'm reposting this as a top level comment:

* The first part of this is creating a policy that federal workers must get vaccinated or be terminated."
12533,"Since he is the head of the executive branch, he has the authority to set guidelines like that."
12534,* The second part is instructing any contractor that does business with the federal government or healthcare agency that receives Medicare/Medicaid dollars to make the same policy within their own companies.
12535,"If those companies want to continue to do business with the federal government, they will need to comply with this policy."
12536,* The third part is instructing OSHA to implement a policy that requires any employer that has more than 100 employees to require vaccinations or testing.
12537,The penalty for not doing so is a fine.
12538,"This policy may or may not be constitutional, depending on whether this type of regulation is within the scope of what Congress has given to the agency."

12605,It's not a bad thought but the economy is recovering and small businesses are JUST starting to get back into the groove.
12606,If a place has 5 employees and 3 of them stomp their feet and quit then it effectively closes that business.

12822,I have it on good authority from another Reddit user that since there has been ONLY 515 deaths of children out of 5 million cases that COVID is still not an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù in children.

12837,"Nevermind that a school cannot shut down block parties, but also that the block parties were mostly pretty tame."
12838,"They sounded as if this was a life or death issue, that they would not accept no for an answer, and that if they were not shut down, the kids would become drug dealers and prostitutes."

12844,"Under normal circumstances, sure."
12845,"Normally, there are enough ICU beds and enough hospital staff to accommodate everybody."
12846,Normally hospitals aren't cancelling every single elective surgery in order to dedicate those resources to treating emergency patients.
12847,Normally doctors wouldn't judge a person before providing medical care.
12848,Normally parking garages aren't repurposed into sick wards.
12849,Well vaccine efficacy in lowering the chance of severe illness and hospitalization is proven in my opinion.
12850,"That's probably the conclusion that you and I both reached, to at least be decidedly convinced that it was the right thing to do as individuals."
12851,"... hence, we got vaccinated."
12852,"&amp;nbsp;  
  
There is a huge misunderstanding that not many people are spending time interrogating though."
12853,"The whole ""can't go to a concert (or go on a flight) because you aren't vaccinated"" makes very limited sense given the information available to people."
12854,"The media spends absolutely zero time or effort on the distinction between  vaccinating people to reduce spread directly, and vaccinating people to reduce spread indirectly and reduce mortality."
12855,"&amp;nbsp;  
I imagine a person at a conference, wedding, concert or on a flight."
12856,"Are we telling them that they have to be vaccinated because they are metaphorically ""spouts of extreme nuclear radiation"", and vaccinated people *arent*?"
12857,The difference between trabsmissibility of Delta (and probably Mu too) between vaccinated and unvaccinated people is very small.
12858,"So if unvaccinated people aren't uniquely subject to having a nuclear meltdown and infecting hundreds of people whereas vaccinated aren't... are we mandating that these people get vaccinated so they don't spontaneously become symptomatic and decline from a condition of ""feeling good"", to ""put me on my deathbed"" over the course of 3-5 hours?"
12859,"It is quite obvious to me that their status as unvaccinated people is anything is a higher risk position to choose, but the real consequence for them is that depending on their age and comorbidities, they're only manipulating their chances of severe illness."
12860,"&amp;nbsp;  
  
The big glaring externality here, since most COVID infection is now Delta variant infection, is that a person who chooses not to be vaccinated and does have severe illness, and ends up in a hospital is one more person who can infect healthcare workers and cohabitators."
12861,We have to be honest about the average person's rate of hospitalization too.
12862,"Last I checked (it could be different now) the hospitalization rate averaged across all risk categories, was 0.5 percent."
12863,"1 in 200.  
ie."
12864,"We mandate the vaccine for each 200 person sample size, to reduce the exposure of a COVID infected patient to a healthcare worker and their housemates by 1."
12865,"&amp;nbsp;  
Is that good ROI?"
12866,How does the situation change moving forward since we are putting selection pressure against replication of variants that don't spread as well among vaccinated people?
12867,The NHS did an interesting study on its nurses and they measured transmission from vaccinated nurses to their vaccinated housemates.
12868,"They didn't wait for symptoms, they did blanket testing at set intervals."
12869,I think it was like once per week for their housemates and much more often for the nurses themselves.
12870,"The study was pre-Delta variant, and vaccinated-to-vaccinated transmission was only about 35%."
12871,So the vaccine seemed to help a lot.
12872,"Post-Delta appearance, we are seeing a study (the one I linked) that is under peer review telling us the vaccine isn't reducing the spread from vaccinated people to others."
12873,"Or at least, it is doing little to reduce spread, or results could be considered within the margin of error."
12874,"I have more data in mind thay informs my impression of how well the vaccine is reducing spread, and I am not overly impressed."
12875,I'm vaccinated for my own benefit still.
12876,I advise others to get vaccinated.
12877,The misinformation hype train about ending spread and curbing new variants through increasing pressure on people to be vaccinated via mandates is not advisable in my opinion.
12878,"&amp;nbsp;  

I foresee more variants arising and plenty of unfettered and unappreciated spread (spread and replication go hand in hand) coming from vaccinated people running around acting as though they aren't part of this system."
12879,"Then once some bureaucrat updates the people and the MSM starts pounding the masses with ""new information"", they'll have to find something else to blame for the fact COVID still exists."

13149,"So in emergency rooms, when they are checking everyone in, if you who proof of vax you will get admitted ahead of someone who is unvaxxed."
13150,This sounds extreme but I don't think people understand how bad things are going to get.
13151,"The case loads that are already overloading some hospitals are going to keep getting worse, just like last year, until end of January 2022."
13152,Then it will slowly get less worse for several months until hospitals are back on par with the care they can provide and how many people need it.
13153,That is a likely situation imo.
13154,"Areas that are being hit hardest today could get a lot more restrictive on gathering, masks, vaccines, etc and that could change our trajectory but my assumption is we are going to have to see some areas in the US go through what happened in India before we see significant change."
13155,"It also seems possible that because of how fast delta spreads we could see the worst effects much sooner than january 2022 and the because covid has infected everyone, killing who knows how many, things might ~~be better~~ less worse sooner than expected because of the increased resistance to future infections....?"
13156,That seems like wishful thinking.
13157,"That should be happening this year but the virus didn't come back the same as before, we should expect it to keep coming back differently every year for at least 5 years and we should be trying like hell to prevent the spread in every reasonable way possible."

13191,We are at the point where there are those that believe my rights begin where theirs end.

13194,Sorry I am not buying it.
13195,"Rights come with responsibility, these people are just plain ass selfish."
13196,They have no real sense understanding of the responsibilities of freedom.

13198,"He doesn't really go many places tho, and when he does, he still wears actual N95 masks."
13199,That's better!
13200,[Now here's an actual study on blood clot risk after vaccination and covid](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1931).
13201,"It's much higher for the virus, more than 10 times higher for some types of clot."

13203,I think it's basically saying it decided to require vaccines for any new employees after convincing their current employees to all get vaccinated but that is definitely some awkward clunky writing.
13204,That's the first thing came to my mind as well.
13205,"Sure, a booster will increase antibodies immediately but if it doesn't provide any long term benefit over 2 doses after a month or 2 then it was a wasted dose that could have been utilized much better."
13206,Unfortunately knowing that will take time and studies are already being done on this so I understand the hesitancy to approve boosters for everyone.
13207,"It makes sense for those at risk though given how spread delta variant is, even that short term benefit would be crucial for those people."

13428,**I think this data is misleading**.
13429,I was looking at the data and one interesting thing stood out to me.
13430,"If you look at this chart:

https://i.imgur.com/fjDXKGl.png

This shows the latest data point on how many people were hospitalized that were vaccinated, vs how many were hospitalized that were not vaccinated."
13431,"Those total numbers add up to be the entire population of Colorado, so they are including 0yo+ in the data."
13432,"Looking at the census data, 18.1% of people in Colorado are &lt;12 years old (so they aren't eligible to get vaccinated yet)."
13433,And most likely 0% of &lt;12yo people are vaccinated.
13434,"Also, it's no secret that &lt;12yo are MUCH less likely to be hospitalized in the first place."
13435,"So I propose a much more fair comparison would be to remove children from the above altogether:

* Colorado population (according to this data): 5,763,976
* Colorado pop excluding &lt;12yo (by removing 18.1%): 4,720,695
* Number of vaccinated people (&gt;12yo): 3,079,652
* Number of unvacc'd people (&gt;12yo): 1,641,043
* New hospitalized case rate of Vaccd: 109 cases / 3,079,652 people (per 100,000) = **3.53** (Same as before)
* New hospitalized case rate for non-vac: 355 cases / 1,641,043 people (per 100,000) = **21.63**!!"
13436,"I think this normalized the data and provides a fair comparison since NO children (&lt;12yo) are represented in the vaccinated group, but ALL children are represented in the unvaccinated group."
13437,"This is now comparing apples to apples, since kids won't skew the numbers."
13438,"Before it was a 3.5 rate vs 13.2 rate of hospitalization by vaccination status = ""3.7 times less likely to be hospitalized""."
13439,"Normalized data by removing uneligible children is now 3.53 vs 21.63 = **""6.1 times less likely to be hospitalized""**

I would imagine we would find something similar if we do the same for total deaths."
13440,Feedback is appreciated.
13441,"-----

__TL:DR - It's unfair to include non-eligible children in the statistics since it skews the data in favor of non-vaccd."
13442,"If we normalize the data by removing all people &lt;12 years old, the numbers are more likely to be 6.1 times less likely to be hospitalized (almost twice as much!"

13457,My reading is that this was more of a study on the cost vs benefit of mask wearing in the general population and not specifically a test of the effectiveness of different types of masks.
13458,The study focused heavily on methods of promoting mask usage and their costs to benefit ratio.

13601,"Imagine going to the ER and being told ""sit over there and we'll see you tomorrow""."
13602,Glad to see numbers coming out.
13603,The challenge seems to still be lack of testing.
13604,"If someone gets sick, has enough symptoms to go to the doc, they get tested (generally)."
13605,"If they feel sick, but not enough to go to the doc, they may just go get tested b/c they want to know and want to try and not pass it on to family, workmates, etc."
13606,"We have no way to measure how many are infected, but:

a - do not have symptoms, hence no test, OR, 

b - have symptoms, feel sick, but not enough to go to the doc, they just go on with their day to day

13615,"Seems plausible, yes."
13616,Those who have resumed activities are also more like to be exposed to other common viruses that we see yearly and need exposure to in order to maintain immunity and not get completely flattened once you finally contract it (thinking of the uptick in cases of the cold that seem to be quite bad).
13617,Does your insurance have a nurse line?
13618,You can call and ask about what you should do medically.
13619,As far as the pharmacist doing it wrong you can report them to the pharmacy chain.
13620,"There is a conceivable reason why you might get poked more than once during a vaccination, but given your description it seems unlikely."
13621,"When you give an intramuscular injection, you want the injection to go into muscle (where it will stay in one place for a bit), not a blood vessel (where it goes all over the body)."
13622,"A somewhat old-school practice to confirm proper needle placement is called ""aspiration"": the needle is inserted and then you pull back a little on the plunger to see if you see blood (indicating that you hit a blood vessel); if you see blood, you pull the needle, discard the syringe, and start over at a different spot."
13623,"This has been discouraged for a while because it hurts more (which discourages people from coming back for another shot) and it's not believed to make much of a difference to vaccine safety or effectiveness: 

&gt; Aspiration before injection of vaccines or toxoids (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but before injection) is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the recommended injection sites, and a process that includes aspiration might be more painful for infants 

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html

*but* 

now some suspect that injecting mRNA covid vaccines into a blood vessel might be the trigger for myocarditis (and it's been shown to be a myocarditis trigger in mice: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406358/ so it's not entirely out of the question) and have called for a return to this old-school practice."

13627,I have some mixed feelings about this study.
13628,"This doesn't really help our case (by ""our"", I mean people like myself who strongly advocate for masking.)"
13629,The absolute risk reduction was only 1%.
13630,(The relative risk reduction was 9.3%).
13631,"For vaccines, the absolute risk reduction is 1.2% for Moderna and 0.84% for Pfizer."
13632,However the relative risk reduction for Mrna vaccines is about 95%.
13633,I think it is more important to encourage vaccination than masking.
13634,"Probably still important to promote both, but vaccination makes a profound difference and this study suggests that while promoting masking DOES make a difference, it is not anywhere near as large a difference as vaccination."
13635,"And I just want to add that this masking study was designed to see if **promoting** mask use ""works""."
13636,"It wasn't designed to see how well masking works (even in the ""masked"" villages mask use was low)."

13716,This has been a neglected part in the fight against the pandemic.
13717,Better air quality indoors (and outdoors as pollution likely exacerbates the disease) would have been tremendously helpful to contain infections and deaths.

13719,"Sure SARS-CoV-2 is dangerous, influenza viruses too."
13720,But I have the belief that people need to get a few colds per year to keep your immune system in shape.

13723,These are healthy people who have avoided getting sick for 1 1/2 years thanks to masks and social distancing and now their immune system is going bananas at the first virus they encounter.
13724,"like everything, still not perfect but 1000 times better."
13725,"President Biden is expected on Thursday to impose new vaccination mandates as part of a broad plan to put pressure on private businesses, federal agencies and schools to enact stricter vaccination and testing policies as the Delta variant continues its spread across the United States."
13726,"The spread of the highly infectious variant has pushed the country‚Äôs daily average caseload over 150,000 for the first time since late January, overwhelming hospitals in hard-hit areas and killing roughly 1,500 people a day."
13727,"Mr. Biden, who was briefed by his team of coronavirus advisers on Wednesday afternoon, is set to deliver a speech at 5 p.m. Eastern that will address about six areas where his administration can encourage ‚Äî or, at this point, push ‚Äî more eligible Americans to receive vaccines, according to the White House."
13728,"Officials offered few specifics, stressing that the plan was still coming together."
13729,"But two officials familiar with the plan said that it would include new federal requirements for vaccination, and that its underlying message would be that the only way to return to some sense of normalcy was to get as many people vaccinated as possible."
13730,"‚ÄúWe know that increasing vaccinations will stop the spread of the pandemic, will get the pandemic under control, will return people to normal life,‚Äù Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday."
13731,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what our objective is, so we want to be specific about what we‚Äôre trying to achieve.‚Äù

The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs decision last month to grant full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has already prompted the Pentagon to require members of the military to be vaccinated."
13732,Mr. Biden said at the time that the approval should sweep away any lingering doubts about vaccination and spur more mandates.
13733,"When asked if Mr. Biden would be adding more detail to existing policies or would outline measures that would have an immediate and broad effect on Americans, Ms. Psaki replied: ‚ÄúIt depends on if you‚Äôre vaccinated or not.‚Äù

Administration officials see signs that more people in the United States are open to receiving shots ‚Äî some 14 million got their first shots in August, four million more than in July, Ms. Psaki said."
13734,"But about 27 percent of the eligible U.S. population age 12 and older have not received any Covid vaccinations, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
13735,"In some of the hardest-hit states, the unvaccinated percentage is higher: 42 percent in Texas, for instance, and 38 percent in Florida."
13736,About 1.3 million fully vaccinated people have received a third shot after federal officials approved them for people with compromised immune systems.
13737,"Mr. Biden has publicly supported the idea of broadening the availability of third shots as boosters for much more of the population, but health experts have advised the White House to hold off promoting that for now."
13738,"On Wednesday, Ms. Psaki said that the White House was working toward a plan for boosters, but did not give a time frame."
13739,She told reporters that Mr. Biden had chosen Thursday to deliver an extensive speech on the virus because he understood it was ‚Äútop of mind for Americans‚Äù as they return to schools and offices.
13740,"The president will also be seeking to course-correct after a difficult month for his administration, directing the public away from a chaotic and violent end to the war in Afghanistan and back toward his administration‚Äôs efforts to curb a pandemic that has upended every facet of American life."
13741,"But amid renewed fears of the virus‚Äôs damaging effect on the economy and the prevalence of a troublesome variant, even Mr. Biden‚Äôs allies say it will take more than a speech to ease concerns that the virus has once again spiraled out of a president‚Äôs control."
13742,"‚ÄúHe ran on competence, bringing adults back into the room,‚Äù said Nick Rathod, a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama."

13872,Where did you get 17%?
13873,"Mongolia has 3,353,470 people."
13874,"In any case, a large portion of their population is nomadic, so the impact is even better than the number sounds."
13875,"Ulaanbaatar is the only significant city, and it has 43.7% of Mongolia's population, so vaccinating 12.8% of the city creates much more strategic impact than the number indicates."
13876,"Getting people vaccinated has always been way, way, way more important than getting vaccinated people to mask up."
13877,You wouldn't know it based on how people talk though.
13878,People better invest in LTC facilities because that's exactly where these people's kids are sending them in their old age.
13879,Sure kiddo.

13882,From the FullFact article I linked to.
13883,"&gt;177 million fully vaccinated people in the US, three deaths from blood clots, so the risk would be roughly 1 in 59 million."
13884,"Myocarditis is happening at a rate of 40.6 cases per million vaccinated in your age group, and while highly unpleasant, has killed no one."
13885,"Could you link to the sources for those, please?"
13886,"In other words, they waited days?"

13890,My friend is a pharmacist and works at different locations sometimes way outside of where we live.
13891,He was working on a small town last week and after an hour had to call the local doctor because there was only one and tell them he will not fill any prescriptions for livestock dewormer.
13892,The nurse he spoke to told him ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs working‚Äù I assume to the fact it makes you sick.
13893,They called back later to confirm his name.
13894,"Those of us that have been doing this for awhile saw this horror show forming when they did the whole ""we will experience a nursing shortage""."
13895,"Saw a huge uptick in graduating nurses that really didn't care about human beings, they just saw a paycheck and job security."
13896,Luckily we manage to keep them out of neonatal/pediatrics (mostly).
13897,[removed]
13898,This is correct.
13899,A lot of computer charting software (not all) flat out lists the time a persons been in the ER by minutes.
13900,So you‚Äôll see some whacky shit like 1600 minutes.
13901,The doctor was simply making a remark based on what he‚Äôs seeing on his computer screen.
13902,"I see where he's coming from, but the difference between people that are ""anti-vaxx"" and people that take the vaccine is that ""anti-vaxx"" would deny people help, where as, people that took the vaccine ""have a heart"" and would take care of those around them."
13903,He pretty much said what the dark part of my mind is thinking.
13904,If you were vaccine hesitant back in December last year I can understand that.
13905,If you're an anti-vaxxer after 10 months of incredible success with the vaccines I think you're in the same category as people who play frogger on a highway or ride a motorcycle without a helmet.
13906,It's just stupidity in most cases and I'm usually okay with stupidity as long as it doesn't harm anyone else.
13907,But of course the entitled anti-vax crowd are largely responsible for the current death and illness spreading like wildfire throughout our country.
13908,"So to take Howard Sterns words, ""Fuck em""."
13909,"&gt;There is long standing legal precedent that you can be fired for not getting vaccinations

I said *for receiving* the vaccine, your employer can fire you."
13910,I hate what this has done to all of us.
13911,Politicians and media don't help.
13912,We are so divided.
13913,I don't even want to see other people.
13914,Everyone is so cruel lately.
13915,Did you see the latest townhall?
13916,People in there CRAZY mad
13917,"I live in an Exurb of DC, we are 2 weeks into the School year, over 3k students qaurintined, and more than 300 positive cases."
13918,Because the first lockdown went so well.
13919,Remember?
13920,2 weeks to flatten the curve!
13921,"I don't know if a stipend is worth dating a Miami public school employee , I mean have you seen these people?"
13922,"I‚Äôm a nurse, I grew up in Kentucky, I worked in both hospitals and clinics in Kentucky, lived there for 30 years, and still have a lot of family there."
13923,The county I grew up in has about 16k residents and is about 30% vaccinated.
13924,"The only hospital in that county has 24 total beds and no ICU beds (not that they‚Äôre full, they didn‚Äôt have any to begin with as they are just in no way equipped to handle critical care patients)."
13925,Rural healthcare is going to be dangerously close to collapsing if rural hospitals like this can‚Äôt transfer patients because the larger regional medical centers (like St. Claire) are full.
13926,Maybe amish for forbidding technology.
13927,Other than that there are religious authorities (priests &amp; such) who are willing to sign a piece of paper &amp; claim it's a religious matter
13928,This would require Americans to have a sense of moral responsibility to uphold the wellbeing of society as s whole.
13929,This means they would need to place the wellbeing of society above their own personal feelings and freedoms.
13930,"As someone watching multiple family members in the health care field work themselves into their own graves caring for antivax shitgibbons, I agree."

13935,"Like, next time you buy some toothpaste, the same store will almost certainly have vaccines if you're in the US."
13936,"You just have to stop at the store for 20 minutes, and you can spend the 15 minute wait period grabbing the toothpaste."
13937,Hopefully the college vaccine mandates sweep up a decent number of the 18-22 group at least.
13938,"Thanks for this ""the more you know"" moment, I was kind of wondering if any of those 144,000 spots in heaven are left."
13939,"As far as theology dystopias, I have already seen *Left Behind*, and that was by far the worst Nicolas Cage movie I have ever seen."
13940,Aren't they letting parents of kids 12+ opt out of both vaccinations and testing without penalty?
13941,I think your numbers are way off.
13942,"Where are you getting 1 in 92,000?"
13943,There have been only three deaths in the US from blood clots related to vaccines.
13944,"And now that we know how to treat it, those deaths have stopped happening."
13945,The risk of the vaccines causing any kind of problem is so low that it's hard to even think about.
13946,"177 million fully vaccinated people in the US, three deaths from blood clots, so the risk would be roughly 1 in 59 million."
13947,"Myocarditis is happening at a rate of 40.6 cases per million vaccinated in your age group, and while highly unpleasant, has killed no one."
13948,"Meanwhile, COVID killed 2000 people *yesterday*."

13953,It's getting harder to get them tested too.
13954,One of mynkids came home from School with a fever and mild cough last week.
13955,Had been fine tha morning.
13956,I took her to an urgent care clinic right away.
13957,Her fever spiked even higher in the time it took to get there.
13958,Rapid test came back negative.
13959,Doctor felt it was just another seasonal virus.
13960,They did a PCR test just to be careful.
13961,Fortunately that came back negative.
13962,But we kept both kids home for 2 days until we got the PCR test results.
13963,My wife went to work but never got within 6 feet of someone.
13964,I stayed home because I am fortunate enough to be able too.
13965,"But I know people sending symptomatic kids to School that work remote, and whose kids are old enough they don't need to have their hand held through their assignments."
13966,Very frustrating.
13967,what does that have to do with the person you're attacking?
13968,"Hmm that would make sense, but from my own personal experience this summer in NJ we were smacked with heatwaves and people had no trouble being inside to go to stores or clubs and shit"
13969,Looks like he saved some punchy tweets for his rebuttals.
13970,No.
13971,People created the vaccine.
13972,That was never protected.
13973,There is long standing legal precedent that you can be fired for not getting vaccinations (previous lawsuits mostly about flu shots during outbreaks).
13974,The only open question was about EUA approval being enough but now Pfizer has full FDA approval so no legal leg to stand on to fight that in the USA anyway.
13975,Too many decided cases in favor of employers from the past.
13976,"This is a flawed model‚Äîthey had no data for almost all of Africa and still felt like they could make estimates, with enormous confidence intervals!"
13977,Yeah.
13978,My wife works for a big federal agency and she hasn‚Äôt heard anything yet.

14002,Immediately I asked if the family are vaccinated.
14003,He said he caught it last year and so he doesn't need to be vaccinated.
14004,He said his parents were not vaccinated and they are young and fit and exercise daily.
14005,Lets say they are 45-50.

14021,based on one picture on the top golf website the driving range balconies looks more outdoors than indoors.
14022,Airflow is probably the #1 thing that provides outdoor safety; direct sun also helps.
14023,A roof overhead doesn't take away much from airflow.
14024,"If they have walls between ""lanes"" that might mess with the airflow, though."
14025,Now tell us about Haiti

14029,"If you mean ""Is there no chance that the vaccine could harm me?"

14165,"But, they have a set up that when you arrive, before you go in, you call a specific number, someone gowns up and comes to get you, and you go to specific rooms."
14166,"They all had signs on them, sick visits only, and a marker to indicate if it was cleaned yet."
14167,"Also, might be that the Dr is the only place they can get the COVID test done for their kid."
14168,Sounds even more stressful for sure.
14169,We feel similarly about how it would affect our son‚Äôs mental health.
14170,He is obviously missing friends and in person school.

14182,Just watched the video.
14183,First off I wanna say those people are scumbags and should have shown some damn respect while letting the guy say what he had to say.
14184,"HOWEVER:

I don't think the woman in the background was smirking because she found the fact that his grandma had died directly funny instead of the notion that the reason she died was due to anti maskers as I've seen many saying."
14185,"Personally I think it was the kind of smirk you give when someone says something you totally disagree with and you roll your eyes and smirk at such a ridiculous statement, or when you see someone on a talent show using a dead relative as a sob story to garner affection (not that that was what he was doing)."
14186,"She did it just as he said that his grandma died ""because people weren't wearing masks""."
14187,To her that is stupid and just doesn't compute.
14188,"In that context, she's no worse than any of the other anti maskers we've seen so many of, i.e."
14189,willfully stupid and utterly deserving of scorn and ridicule.
14190,But not quite as much as someone that would laugh in your face at the notion that someone you love has died.
14191,There is a (really small) difference.
14192,Just felt it's important to point that out.
14193,&gt;	Plus there‚Äôs a whole sugar addiction / soda lobby to factor in there.
14194,So they get a pass for being manipulated into making an unhealthy choice?
14195,Because I can think of something else that falls into that category‚Ä¶

14203,"They advise that kids not be around immune compromised people for a week or two afterward, just in case."
14204,"This is not the case for COVID vaccines, which only produce the ‚Äúspike‚Äù of the virus (basically, they tell the body what it looks like so it can be recognized and fought off)."

14217,Exactly.
14218,"All these people who think like this should be social distancing from the vaccinated or at least wearing masks, but they don't."
14219,Makes no sense.

14234,So it seems inevitable that basically everyone is going to be exposed to Delta at some point based on how infectious it is.
14235,What exactly is the goal now?
14236,Wait for kids to be able to get vaccinated and then things can go back to normal?
14237,To me I just don‚Äôt see a point in continuing masking/ distancing if everyone who wants to get vaccinated can (once kids can).
14238,The threshold for herd immunity seems unattainable now atleast in the US.
14239,Exactly!
14240,These are the same people who raise hell every time Muslims breathe over there.

14245,"I would wager that the outspoken ones would love to take sticks to those wanting to force them to be vaccinated, so I'm afraid that brutal enforcement would entrench them further."
14246,"I agree: deny services that they chose to not get, but having people forcefully vaccinating them would fulfill their doomsday fantasies."
14247,"Let people lie in the beds they make and keep them from harming everyone else, while not denying their rights."
14248,"(note: rights not luxuries)

edit: I know someone who expects FEMA to pull up in an unmarked van and cart them away."
14249,They are willing to have that happen rather than get the vaccine.
14250,I watched the whole video..
14251,I have been watching the whole video of those school board meetings from all over the country that has gone viral.
14252,Trying to understand people for myself.
14253,I don't understand those anti-mask parents.
14254,"They always existed, and no wonder school sucked."
14255,lol.
14256,This one has more balanced anti and pro masks.
14257,That affordability alone is itself a stark contrast.
14258,"It's like saying ""other than having to sell everything i own to pay for not dying, I've really had the same experience as my cousin up North"" (yes, an exaggeration, to make the point - but not unheard of which in an of itself is telling)

I've had two children and one life saving surgery (including multi day hospital stays)."
14259,I'm scheduled for another non-optional but not yet love threatening surgery later this year.
14260,"My bill for everything: $0


&gt;As Americans who have to pay 100% of our premium (independent contractors), my husband and I pay a little over $11,000 per year in premiums alone."
14261,Not sure why you pay so much but I expect provincial differences will play into it.
14262,Until recently however the premium for a resident of BC was around $70/mo.
14263,"Usually paid by employers, it's now been entirely eliminated."
14264,"&gt; Even pre-pandemic, we often wait weeks to see a doctor."
14265,"Even pre-pandemic, we can only be ‚Äúseen‚Äù sooner if we agree to a Teledoc or video chat appointment with a doctor that is not always our actual doctor."
14266,This is not uncommon here as finding a dedicated family doctor / GP is hard.
14267,"However with that said walk ins take people every day and the wait (here at least) isn't too bad (on average, pre-pandemic)."
14268,"I'm sure there are anecdotal stories that are exemplars of either side of the (care in Canada is awesome/sucks spectrum), but on the whole it is a good system that saves thousands of lives every day, and does not result in a life-altering financial burden."
14269,"I expect if you took the *actual* experiences of Americans and Canadians, across the spectrum, and over time, you'd find on average the level of care is comparable and the individual cost is significantly lower."
14270,And for those on the lower end of the economic spectrum the difference would be stark (especially if you were to account for those that didn't seek or receive care due to the prohibitive costs).
14271,"I feel like this delta wave is covid‚Äôs big death rattle, and it‚Äôs all downhill from here."
14272,I was recently on hold for 16 minutes just to be able to leave a voicemail.
14273,The end result was that I got to send a picture through MyChart to my doctor.
14274,"RSV, Covid and back to school just has then overwhelmed."
14275,"Here's what that article you linked says:

&gt;Therefore the incidence of death related to these blood clots is around 1 in 470,000."
14276,I don't think people will start linking you data if you can't be bothered to read your own links..
14277,Except Colorado doesn't have a statewide mask mandate.
14278,"The focus has been on local governments, schools, and individual businesses."
