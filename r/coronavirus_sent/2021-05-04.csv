2,Wut

4,You're correct but we are talking about people who arent that smart.
5,"Heck, men can get JnJ at no risk so far, all of the clots were on women of childbearing age."
6,"Some of that might be due to more women working in fields that require them to get it, e.g."
7,"child care, elder care, medicine."
8,Cool they’ve been doing this with the flu shot every year.
9,"I honestly think, the only way we get to 70% is if we get people like Joe Roegan…

(He is the only celebrity I know of that has publicly said no to the vaccine, but there has to be more)

…to record themselves getting the vaccine, on their own volition, to have the antivax idiots get the vaccine."
10,"We need any high profile people that have been saying no, to say yes, and show themselves getting it."
11,It’s the only way to turn the data around.
12,"The more press you have of celebrities like Joe Roegan saying no, the more it’s just going to add fuel to the fire of the antivax"

33,The rest are goons with vested interests
34,To some degree people’s selfishness is what caused the pandemic to be as bad as it’s been.
35,The excuses for not getting the vaccine will become highly self-centered in the next month or two.
36,These individuals shouldn’t be allowed to hold back a return to normalcy.
37,It’s not unreasonable to anticipate that they will mostly be infecting each other.
38,That’s their right.
39,"It not ""the vaccine""."
40,You actually have a choice.
41,Don't like J&amp;J?

47,hahaha gotcha
48,Have you looked at what happened in Israel?
49,After around 50% of adults were fully vaccinated they had a steep decline in cases.
50,At this point they are at less than 1% of their peak number of new cases.
51,I read that the decline has concided with the J&amp;J stop.
52,Do you agree with that?
53,I personally think it's a coincidence.
54,This.... As a system it looks to be giving hope... We need more positive news.. not positive reports....
55,"Notice that comment sounds like bullshit when i say Pfizer, but when you say any other manufacturer, somehow you want your comment taken seriously?"
56,That comment was bullshit.
57,It doesn’t make sense.
58,It’s merely a copy of your previous comment.
59,Glad you caught on but apparently not all the way.
60,Interesting.
61,Could it be that people didn’t trust the HEAT to verify people were actually vaccinated?

67,Canadian and Mexican cross border travel.
68,"I'm more interested in seeing if say, Moderns would be accepted overseas, in countries where they haven't had access to ample supplies, for visiting."
69,I had the same experience.
70,I had to drive an hour into the middle of nowhere when I scheduled my first shot at the end of March because it was the only place with available appointments.
71,But I could easily have gotten one in my city if I waited until now.
72,I'm glad I decided drive because I'm already 2 weeks past my second shot.
73,It won't happen since some people are ideologically against or are just plain scared of it.
74,No herd immunity due to a lack faith in science
75,I did my part.
76,"Only 32 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, with numbers declining."
77,Not looking good

145,"Are we certain that as a society we need the people who refuse the vaccine on political grounds, mainly “socialism”?"
146,Maybe if we protect those who can’t be vaccinated because of medical reasons just a little longer the first group will sort themselves out and we will soldier on without them.

158,people who don’t care about Covid never stopped going out anyway
159,I think moreso people's assessment of this risk is based on the notion that there's some conspiracy attached to the pandemic.
160,"They're not using faulty reasoning, merely bad premises to reach a logical conclusion that's still false."
161,So go door to door AND offer payments for vaccines and get basically everyone in the 2nd category and some of the people in the 3rd category too simply because $100 at your doorstep is pretty tempting.

219,Check out this thread [https://mobile.twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1382734865288728580](here).
220,I respect this doc and his opinion sheds a bit more light on the subject.
221,"Since the population that experienced this side effect has only been women under 50, we can’t include the entire population of those that received the J&amp;J vaccine."
222,Puts the rate higher than it initially appeared.
223,But doesn’t negate the fact that this whole thing has been handled poorly
224,The huge drop in the number of first dose shots is really concerning.
225,Yes we know that now.
226,The CDC and states are being slow to update the guidelines.
227,"According to what has been administered, as of the last report on 12 April, it was 66538 doses Sinopharm to 45654 AZ, noting that about half of the AZ dose recipients had only received one dose at that point: http://www.health.gov.sc/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19-VACCINATION-UPTAKE-REPORT_10TH-11TH-12TH-APRIL-2021.pdf"

233,I've heard from my father in law that he didn't trust some random volunteer to give him a shot....only his doctor.
234,"I think he's wrong, but we'll do better by accommodating that rather than ignoring that."
235,"In your case, I'd encourage you to call your doctor."
236,"I belive your doctor would want you to get a shot, and whether or not they can give it to you, maybe they can address enough of your concerns to help you get your vaccine."
237,"(I dunno, maybe they can give it, maybe they can recommend some you can trust, I dont know)."
238,I understand wanting to batch it with other medical errands.
239,I'd anyway encourage you to not wait til June.
240,"I don't know what your motivations are, but there a number of good things that happen sooner the more people that get vaccinated sooner (less deaths, less suffering, less restrictions, etc)."
241,"I guess overall, I really do want you to be vaccinated."

247,I'm advocating for it as best I can.

286,I've been fucking saying this for months.
287,"People were really pissy and tried to use ""math"" to prove the vaccine rate would mean herd immunity by early summer and refused to acknowledge just how many can't or won't get the vaccine this year."
288,They all thought 70% was actual herd immunity not rock bottom goal 🙄.
289,It's supposed to be 90% or higher if possible.
290,"Ain't happening

Everyone was so cock sure those daily dose rates would continue and the antivax / conservatives, under 18s and medical exceptions made up 2% of the population in their heads 🤔"
291,it will be cheaper for the state to just throw you in the cell for the duration of the pandemic and pay you damages later when you sue them
292,They mostly used AstraZeneca.
293,I don't know why this article has left out this piece of information.
294,It makes sound like the entire population is vaccinated with Sinopharm where in fact only 30% of them got it.
295,90000 doses AstraZeneca and only 50000 doses Sinopharm.
296,Bezos should be offering $5 amazon gift cards or something.
297,I bet even $5 would get a lot more people interested.
298,The money you referenced is regarding purchase contract to get dosage first.
299,USA paid 2x higher fees than regular vaccine price to get the vaccine before anyone else.
300,The research for development was already being invested by Pfizer even before Warp Speed.
301,"&gt; Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that Pfizer, unlike some smaller pharmaceutical companies that the government had contracted with, did not need research money because it was likely to have the infrastructure and early data it needed to speed its vaccine to trials without federal assistance."

303,Dude cool it you're ruining our deal here

305,That already changed with Trump.
306,"I also think, now after Covid and Trump, that generally 75% of the people are fucking morons."
307,Even my family  are covidiots.
308," I think the article has left out the important fact that the majority of the Seychelles' population is vaccinated with Covishied, the Indian version of AstraZeneca."
309,"90000 doses Covishied, 50000 doses Sinopharm"
310,"It’s literally using a US government patent owned by the NIAID developed at UTexas for the 2 proline substitution to stabilize the spike, a genetic sequence from Austrailia, mRNA tech developed at UPenn, with a Canadian lipid nanoparticle."
311,"Once Pfizer got it’s hands on it, it became a Moderna clone and Moderna was essentially a US government partnered vaccine."
312,"Germany doesn’t get much credit here, I’m sorry,"
313,"Fuck everyone else though, right?"
314,Oh is that all?
315,Easy!
316,Bezos should offer $5 amazon gift cards or something.
317,I bet even $5 would get a lot more people interested.
318,The first goal was mostly about ramping up supply but this one seems more like trying to convince the holdouts that don't seem interested in bothering with the vaccine.
319,I think there is availability for appointments or walk/drive in clinics pretty much anywhere in the country.
320,Anyone who hasn't gotten the vaccine yet is free to go get their first dose tomorrow.
321,I don't currently know a single person who needs or wants the vaccine that has not been able to get an appointment yet.
322,I know a handful of Trump voters that refuse to bother and like 1 person on the fence about getting it that hasn't bothered to go in yet.

333,*
334,I think what happened early on with New York and the ties between the Bay Area and China (see SARS) scared the bejesus out of people in the bay area.
335,Also for whatever reasons people in the Bay Area don't care about having to wear a mask.
336,"Yup seems like people just aren’t wanting them sadly, or not making it a priority"
337,"Need some advice, my brother has Covid because he  is taking care of my grand parents, they both have covid."
338,"Now should I go get my 1st vaccine vaccine dose done or wait, because when I consulted a doctor they told me after vaccination, atleast for a week immune system becomes weak, so there is a chance  may be I could get infected in the first week itself after vaccination."
339,Although my Mother got her 1st jab on 23rd April.
340,"She is fine, father is diabetic &amp; now we are afraid for him, since his SG level were drastic earlier we weren't able to get him the vaccine before."
341,"Should I get it or wait, doctors are really unreachable in India presently?"
342,So any serious advice could be really helpful if you have knowledge in medical field.
343,"If we’re going to do a combined shot, I suspect it will be NovaVax’s shot at first, as they have a soon to be approved flu shots (Nanoflu) and a soon to be EUA’d COVID vaccine using the same technology (same platform)."
344,You will likely be able to just combine them by weight since they use the same adjunct and go hog wild.
345,That is unlike the mRNA/Adenovirus tech where we’re still a full phase 1/2/3 away from an approved seasonal flu shot.
346,"I'm a dad, but thanks."
347,"I didn't agonize over it too much, as this just happened Monday."
348,They only have a few weeks left.
349,[deleted]
350,"While that’s true, the point remains that parroting the “it 100% prevents death” claim is simply untrue."
351,No vaccine for any virus can promise that.
352,"Look, seatbelts absolutely save lives and reduce deaths, but claiming that nobody wearing a seatbelt will die in a car accident is disingenuous and doesn’t help the messaging."

357,Don't turn it into major international news.
358,"Conspiracy nuts will do their thing, but their reach won't spread."
359,Down in Myrtle beach SC I went to Walmart today said no appointment.. free covid vaccine
360,"According to a NY Times analysis, there is a strong connection between vaccine hesitancy and political leanings: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html?hide-chrome=1"
361,I’ve made around $800 so far from being in the Astra Zeneca study.
362,And I got the vaccine back in December.
363,So early vaccine + $1000 total by the end of this all.
364,"MultiP.L.A.C.T.ion

365,But they mostly used the Indian version of AstraZeneca.
366,"50000 doses of sinopharm, 90000 doses of Covishied."
367,I don't understand why everyone in the comment section only discuss about Sinopharm.
368,"We're not talking the odds of contracting the virus, we're talking odds of transmission between vaccinated people."
369,You multiply.
370,"If I am 10% as likely to be carrying the virus as a non vaccinated person and you are 5% as likely to develop symptomatic illness as a non-vaccinated person, your risk reduction is 0.1x0.05=0.005 or 0.5% as likely as two non-vaccinated people transmitting symptomatic illness in a similar interaction."
371,"Offer another stimulus check, but ONLY to people who are vaccinated (by a deadline)."
372,Sounds like bay area people cant think for themselves.
373,"Im still unsure

I beat covid ill beat it again

Ill wait until next year maybe"
374,Should probably just keep the country shut down forever then just to be sure.
375,It’s that or just accept that a good chunk of people aren’t willing to be vaccinated.
376,Those people are welcome to the consequences of their ignorance.
377,Children as a whole don’t suffer serious illness from Covid.
378,No one.
379,"I repeat, not a single third world country could make these vaccines right now."
380,We’re 100% supply constrained based on inputs.
381,"India had to beg the US to give them bioreactors, which the US could only provide because they shut down the Emergent plant and diverted their stock."
382,Every machine and filter required to make vaccines for the next year and a half is already spoken for.
383,"Every government on the planet should have been spinning up production on these parts a year ago, but instead everyone wanted to make sure they were getting their money’s worth and here we are."

386,"No, I think you’re misunderstanding what I mean."

408,This is quite common.
409,I follow a lot of allergy therapeutic and vaccine studies (for selfish reasons) and rarely do they escape phase1/2 without serious adverse reactions or efficacy limitations.

434,Use the carrot 🥕 not the stick !
435,Just tell  people they can take their mask off if they get the vaccine and they may just do it.
436,The last mask guidance literally said fully vaccinated people should still wear a mask while getting a hair cut....
437,[deleted]
438,"Merck, who is fantastic at making vaccines, bombed on both of their covid vaccines."
439,"Not enough antibodies, so they abandoned both."
440,In my opinion since both were still very safe vaccines I wish they would have still made it for the developing world.
441,"Some antibodies and a T-cell response is better than nothing, especially for the young."
442,"If you could turn covid from potentially deadly to surely just getting a cold or flu symptoms, that’s probably overkill for the young."
443,Very low symptomatic reduction but protection from death and hospitalization could really save some countries in a spike.
444,I hear you man.
445,It all depends on the supply we will have a hand.
446,"Plus, wether there will be enough for everyone."
447,A lot of factors which i'm not too happy about.
448,"Being that there are countries which do not even have the first shot, it would be ideal for them to also have some sort of priority on receiving the pfizer and moderna doses."

454,"I think this has been the worst part of the vaccine messaging to people, particularly on this sub."
455,"It should be ""get your doses and get back to your life""."
456,"Instead, we are focusing too much on hypothetical strains and situations where the vaccine could fail in the future when the data today suggests that you can go back to your normal life without any impactful additional risk if you are vaccinated."

467,I just don't feel like getting a third shot and depriving someone else from it.

469,She's older and her immune system isn't great
470,"That makes too much sense, so we aren’t going to implement that"
471,"not 100% sure, but my best friend told me that, at least in Italy, they aren't receiving adequate amounts of any vaccine."
472,J&amp;J: tiny amounts.
473,Pfizer: only to first responders and old folks.
474,Astrazeneca: constantly on pause.
475,You're right.
476,It is a logistics error too.
477,People jumping the line and such.
478,But it's also Europe not having much access to the pfizer and moderna vaccines.
479,You're right though.
480,Europe screwed up by relying too heavily on the oxford vaccine
481,"The last vaccine-related targets he set were 100M doses April 30th, 200M doses April 30th (it ended up being ~240M), and enough doses for every adult by 05/31."
482,"They have orders that should put them at 100M J&amp;J due for the end of May^[[i]](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/985933526/why-there-will-be-fewer-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccines-next-week) , 220M of Pfizer^[[i]](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/pfizer-ceo-says-company-can-deliver-10percent-more-doses-to-the-us-by-the-end-of-may-than-previously-agreed.html) , 205M of Moderna^[[i]](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-clinical-and-supply-updates-covid-19-vaccine) and at least 20M AstraZeneca^[[i]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/biden-s-orphaned-astrazeneca-stockpile-rises-to-20-million-doses) ."

485,I'm going to take both doses with the satisfaction of knowing I can go out and enjoy life again.

487,"I do not think that is true with AZ (based on good available data), and suspect it's not with the inactivated vaccines also."

509,Except that's not true.
510,"Doctors and Scientists have been saying almost the whole time that if you are young and I'm good health then you are very, very unlikely to have a severe case."
511,Each and every individual person must have the choice to take it or not to take it.
512,"Yes, also leave some open needles on the floor on public toilets so we get the barefoot hippies vaccinated too."
513,Meaningless?
514,"Pedantic maybe, meaningless is a little harsh."
515,It’s still not easy to get in a lot of places and many people have full time jobs and other responsibilities making scheduling harder.
516,I had to drive an hour out for mine and then drive back feeling somewhat loopy.
517,"I’m worried the second shot is going to make for an awful drive 😬 while two hours isn’t the biggest deal in the world, I can see why some people are waiting till it’s more available in their area as well."
518,Maybe you're not clear on what a negative externality is?
519,"J&amp;Js contact hasn't been renewed for EU

I think everyone will eventually use pziler"
520,"Yep, my level of comfort is effective herd immunity."
521,"If everyone in the group is vaccinated, then that's effective herd immunity."
522,"If I'm in a store and I'm wearing an N95, that's effective herd immunity

Just FYI you can now source 3M N95s from 3M's website - $45 with shipping for a box of 50."
523,The unreasonable ones won't get vaccinated no matter what.
524,The pause has no effect on those people because they're already dug in.

533,"In terms of the poorer parts of the world AZ is the only vaccine to be delivered at scale through COVAX with 30+ million doses already delivered, I don't think anyone else comes close."
534,"As I have written, AZ did shit nothing."

537,"https://globalcommissionforpostpandemicpolicy.org/vaccine-production-april-2021/

538,"Yeah, the Oxford vaccine would have enjoyed the support of the Merck expertise, which, besides providing the Moderna plant in Switzerland and helping to set up the Biontech facility with a monthly output of 80 million per month, would have set up a satisfying production for the Jenners institute."

545,A close friend of mine had a pretty nasty case of covid but recovered completely in 2 weeks or so he thought.
546,Covid had wreaked havoc on his digestive system.
547,What about the people who had the infection?
548,"They are as good as vaccinated, no?"
549,Is the manufacturing capacity for Covaxin low?
550,"I was under the impression that, as a traditional deactivated virus vaccine, it follows the very well understood and well established manufacturing processes in use for over a 100 years."
551,"In other words, many facilities around the world *should* be able to produce it."
552,Maybe I'm misinformed.
553,"While it probably contributed, it may not be a central cause:

&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson pause

&gt; Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration and CDC asked states to temporarily halt using the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine “out of an abundance of caution” following reports that six women had developed rare blood clots."
554,"U.S. health regulators last week lifted the pause after 10 days, saying the benefits of the shot outweighed the risk."
555,&gt; So did the J&amp;J pause play a role in the drop in vaccinations?
556,Kates said it’s not enough to explain the full story of the slowdown.
557,"&gt; Only about 8.2 million of the 237 million total shots given in the U.S. to date have been from J&amp;J, though it was being used for an average of 425,000 reported shots per day in mid-April."
558,"&gt; The single-shot option, which is also easier to transport and store, has proven valuable for certain situations and communities, such as in mobile vaccination units and for homeless people who have trouble accessing a vaccination site multiple times."
559,"&gt; “We know there are some populations who wanted the single dose or were harder to reach and having a single touchpoint is ideal, so it’s possible that some number of people did not get vaccinated because of that,” she said."
560,"“But big picture, it’s not enough to be a huge shift.”

&gt; Indeed, counting Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots alone, the downward trend still holds true."
561,The combination of those two vaccines peaked at an average of 3 million reported daily shots on April 16 and has declined 13% since then.
562,"&gt; The murkier question, though, is whether the J&amp;J halt hurt confidence in the safety of vaccines more broadly and made Americans less likely to get a dose of any of the three vaccine options."
563,&gt; The J&amp;J shot may have been more appealing to those who were hesitant to get a vaccine to begin with.
564,"Polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation in March showed that among those who said they want to wait to see how the vaccines are working before getting vaccinated themselves, a larger share would get the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine compared with either of the two-dose options."
565,"&gt; However, Kates does not believe the J&amp;J pause was a significant factor in vaccine hesitancy."
566,"“From what I can tell, confidence has not been shaken at all,” she said."

576,"Not from Cali, wasn't aware of the nuance."
577,However weren't they ticketing people for not wearing one while riding a bicycle?
578,Thank you for setting me straight.
579,I will say though changing even one base pair in just the right place can be huge.
580,I assume they had studied this change in the other viruses they worked it out in previously and know it was safe.
581,My company had some experts present on the Covid vaccines today and I think the reason for making it stay in the profusion state might be more than just stopping it from folding in on itself.
582,The profusion state is thought to cause a better immune response.
583,This article states that the post fusion form blocks the immune response.
584,If they hadn’t already figured this out these vaccines may not have worked so well.
585,From other things I have read in the natural form the spike protein can readily switch between the different confirmations.
586,Thanks for the info!
587,It made me want to learn more about this!
588,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/1586.full
589,Just make a One billion dollar lottery for those who got the vaccine.
590,Costs less than $5 per person but would generate huge news interest and excitement.
591,We need to inconvenience the rest of the population enough so they get it too.
592,"No large events, mandatory testing before flights, job requirements etc."
593,"I don't see us getting to 70% and def not by July 4th, but I'd love to be proven wrong."
594,"There's too many people still not willing to get vaccinated, plus there's a number of people who won't get their 2nd dose, so 70% seems ambitious to me."
595,"So far they've exceeded their goals, so maybe they know something we don't."
596,I have heard that it is for the better.
597,It is using the 100 year old traditional vaccine approach.
598,"Deactivated virus vaccines are very very well understood, very safe and have low side effects."
599,"And using a full deactivated virus means (apparently) that it is more effective against variants than the other new 'targeted' vaccines, such as mRNA, spike protein etc."
600,"In particular, it's been touted as an excellent ""booster vaccine"", especially for older people."
601,"Finally, it can be stored in normal refrigeration and can also be manufactured widely (unlike the mRNA vaccines for example)."
602,All very good things.
603,"Yeah, I'm on board with that."
604,People who are saying the vaccine hasn't been tested enough don't actually believe that.
605,They just want an excuse to not get it without sounding anti-vax.
606,"Once it's fully approved, they still won't get it."
607,So they'll get the vaccine after they've already gotten COVID...
608,Yep.
609,I also think what happened with the Anthrax Vax has a lot of the older service members spooked until full FDA approval.
610,"Especially when the very loud anti-vaxxers like to shout that the ""Vaccines are more dangerous than Covid!"""

643,That's a pretty major change and very very useful.
644,"It’s not going to happen, god I wish it would."
645,We need to get to the point that we are not constantly breeding new mutations.

647,"No , the previous generation bit the bullet and took the vaccine and stamped it out."
648,Do I worry about measles?
649,No the previous generation but the bullet and stamped it down to where we mostly have herd immunity.
650,I’ve had all my vaxxes.
651,I understand it’s a “personal choice” and people have their beliefs about what is best for them.
652,"Someone needs to step up and take one for the team so we can reach herd immunity, I did it."

660,"Um, the flu shot is FDA approved, while none of the covid vaccines are approved by the FDA."
661,"Um, the flu shot is FDA approved, while none of the covid vaccines are approved by the FDA."
662,"Seems to be the nearly the same when compared to the other immune ""evading"" variants."
663,Less efficacy overall but still basically no chance of death or a severe case.
664,"Some antibody tests may be able to identify a prior infection, it produces a different type (N antibody) that is not produced by the vaccine."
665,"However, both false negatives and false positives exist so results are not 100% reliable."
666,"Doubt it's gonna happen, but not for lack of trying."
667,"I'm glad I'm not the only one, I'm naturally a hypochondriac so I was starting to get worried but it's been over 24 hours and I feel a little better."
668,BF got the same shot and feels fine.
669,"Probably going to be downvoted for saying this, but here are my reasons for being in the “unlikely” camp."
670,"I want to get it the vaccine, so I’m curious if anyone can actually refute some of these points:

Restrictions have become a moral question, with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good."
671,Seeing people’s reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that.
672,"There’s no point to getting vaccinated if we’ll have to wear masks, attend online school, and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely."
673,"The side effects, and no, I’m not talking about the fringe cases of people dying, etc."
674,I trust it enough that I’m not worried about them.
675,There’s just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week.
676,"I’m a college student, and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor."
677,There will be no accommodations for me.
678,Reduced availability from the J&amp;J freeze.
679,"I had originally intended to take the J&amp;J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point, but after the freeze, it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get."
680,Cost.
681,"This is a simple one, but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it, i.e."
682,having to pay for it.
683,Lack of a positive incentive.
684,"As a college student, I didn’t receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year."
685,"There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive, but I see no movement on that."
686,The effectiveness time per vaccine.
687,"I’ve heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months, depending on the variant."
688,"Given all these other factors, the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets."
689,"Those are the big ones, and I don’t really see any of them changing any time soon, at least in my area."
690,Open to new information/having my mind changed.
691,"I really do see the positives in getting it, but until these roadblocks are gone, it remains unlikely I will."
692,I'm sorry to hear that.
693,Hopefully fades soon.

700,How long till it started?
701,Most peopkeni k ow have said a day or two at most if they got side effects.
702,the one and done still reigns supreme if you wanna talk logistics tho
703,They need to be revised.
704,Big time.
705,"Even I, as someone who works with kids and trying to keep them safe, find them appalling."
706,We’re talking “adults” here explicitly.
707,Children make up exactly 0% of the adult population.
708,"Hopefully liability driven, as nobody wants go get organ damage because their work let their shitbag coworkers infect everyone."
709,Then again bodily autonomy is a strong legal precedent.
710,We'll see.
711,The UCs in California tried to mandate flu shots for all faculty in the earlier days of the pandemic.
712,There was a deadline set to get the shot.
713,But the whole thing suddenly disappeared.
714,There were probably some legal issues at play and it'll likely happen again for this fall.
715,This is an opinion contrary to the opinion of the overwhelming majority of experts.
716,What you said is incorrect.
717,95% isn't a measurement regarding any specific incident.
718,It's a comparison over time to a control group.
719,I think they should pitch vaccination as a patriotic act—all of us acting toward a goal specifically to make the country stronger.
720,Give the ‘murica types cognitive dissonance if they refuse vaccine.
721,"Yeah, not calling you out, just warning you against bad info or shenanigans."
722,Would hate to put bad info out there for other vets.
723,"It's well established that although covid is far more dangerous for people over 80, someone in their 30s is no more likely to die than if they caught the flu."
724,But here you are in May 2021 still trying to pander and scare people.
725,Shame on you.

732,Its just that it is rare to find people who take a flu shit.
733,Actually we do want this.
734,"They're not taking the vaccine anyway, so get it to more people who will."
735,Once the vaccines have full approval the manufacturers have the ability to market the product directly to consumers and provide it to more clinics and to employers directly.
736,When are you not at war?
737,[deleted]
738,July plus a month for the FDA to review?
739,Plus for the younger crowd they have to experiment with different dosages.
740,"I think they’re all trying to underpromise and over deliver, though."
741,It's great that you're in good health but COVID effects literally everyone.
742,And I've heard with the new strains young people are worse off than anyone else.
743,What is with the comments on covid related news YT videos?
744,I've been reading them for fun over the past few weeks because of how ridiculous they are but today I interacted with some commenters and my god they don't actually have replies for anything.
745,They just either insult you for easily refuting a claim of theirs or they respond with a reply that literally makes zero sense and only highlights their lack of reading comprehension.
746,At least on Reddit if you argue with someone they'll reply with something of substance but there's literally nothing there.
747,"Just insults, strawman attacks or incoherent rambling."
748,[deleted]
749,Did you miss the last line in ILoveMom's comment?
750,Was I not supposed to take that literal?
751,Was 99% supposed to mean some other number?
752,Because what he's arguing is head scratching.
753,"If the country hit herd immunity through vaccinations, it would not be long before natural immunity strangled the virus out in the areas that didn't quite reach it."
754,"&gt;Herd level immunity, many scooters are now agreeing, will not be achievable."
755,That's mostly irrelevant to the discussion since we are talking about if we do hit herd immunity levels.
756,"&gt;Easterly in the pandemic there was hope that if spread could be limited, and thus mutations/different strains, it might be possible to eliminate it with a vaccine (though even then many experts expressed doubt that it could be fully eliminated)."
757,"A large part of this, though, is due to vaccine hesitancy."
758,"If everyone in the world was willing to get vaccinated, it could be a different story."
759,Although animal reservoirs like ferrets (is it ferrets or some other little animal like that?)
760,"probably make this impossible, so we're more just trying to limit the spread when it does crossover as much as possible."
761,I'm pretty sure that 70% pretty much is requiring that everyone who wants a vaccine gets one so basically they are keeping their fingers crossed.
762,"Yeah, no, even the super libs aren’t doing that."
763,That’s ridiculous.
764,I live in the Bay Area.
765,It’s not some “rallying sign for the super libs” it’s the fact that the city has a huge population of people living in top of each other.
766,[deleted]
767,&gt;	It may be a coincidence but it would be one hell of a coincidence.
768,The other big thing that happened at the same time is that J&amp;J supply tanked due to that factory screwup.
769,That could easily play at least a significant partial role.
770,"""Stupid minds think aliker"""
771,"I saw a few kids get wrapped up in blankets for their non-covid shots, and damn."
772,Brutal.
773,Would a chair with an inflatable set of cushions that held your arm and maybe some straps to keep your body in place help?
774,"I'm thinking like the blood pressure cuff thing, but for most of your arm, and held in place with a wooden board."
775,There of course is a small spot over the deltoid for a needle.
776,Preventative healthcare is one of the biggest money savers for insurers.
777,"They just need to weigh the likelihood of a covid admission against the cost of said admission and boom, there’s the money they save by paying you to vaccinate."
778,It’s why preventative healthcare is almost always 100% covered.
779,"When you take care of yourself, you end up in the hospital a lot less."
780,That’s a breach of human rights
781,Put the vacci in some tranq darts and put out a bounty on anti-vaxers.
782,Reach herd immunity in two weeks.
783,If it’s so classified why is it in the papers?
784,"Not to mention, wrong National lab for that type of research, lol."
785,[deleted]
786,And it’s not even as common as people think.
787,In Vietnam I usually just see people wearing masks on motorbikes but that’s because of the sun and air quality.
788,Indoors at bars and stuff I hardly ever see them.
789,I think the 2016 election proved that as well.
790,From what I'm seeing in my community.
791,People were already hesitant/scared to get the vaccine.
792,The Astra-Zenca released their news about clots and that caused a stir.
793,Then JnJ had news released about clots and that I feel was what made a lot of people just put it off completely.
794,I did have a few friends curious about getting their shots and they've been starting to ask me how the process went.
795,Hopefully if they get it they can reach out to their circles as well to help get some more shots in arms.
796,What a terrifying thought.

925,I won’t be wearing a mask around them.
926,"I’ll still wear mine outside though, if I’m going to be in an area with a lot of passerby (which is everywhere by me.)"
927,"It’s not just for me, but for other people too."
928,It also comes down to risk.
929,"If someone or someone they live with is extra high risk, wearing a mask even when vaccinated makes sense."
930,"Better to be cautious, because wearing a mask hurts no one, then take a risk that might get someone at risk sick."
931,"Maybe some people are extra cautious, but I can tell you point blank it ist “a liberal thong!!11!"
932,"!” because lots of people here have no problem going maskless around vaccinated friends, as long as they aren’t around strangers."
933,Hell they’re seeking to manufacture vaccines and we won’t even let them do that.

936,Nah - the US is already at 83% of 65+ year old people having had at least one shot.
937,And the 83% is climbing.
938,We are at 56% of all adults having had at least one shot.
939,"People saying they will not get the shot will come around.... it must be true mathematically because when you see 83% of over 65s have had it, you just know some of those people would have answered no on a survey, but relented and did what was right for them in the end, rather than sticking with anti vaxx politics."

942,The rest of the country can keep masks and shutdowns for the rest of time and it won’t matter to these people.
943,They haven’t been doing masks from day one.
944,Keeping them for an extra year won’t matter.
945,They’ll stay un-masked and un-vaxxed

955,I may be wrong but I also thought I read most of the blood clot victims were women.
956,I'm not sure if there's an actual reason or pure coincidence.
957,"I got most of the series in the early 2000s (but after 2001), so the wiki is wrong."
958,I think I stopped after my third one.
959,"If kids have to have a list of other required vaccines, then yes, this is very feasible."
960,[removed]
961,You're correct that we have to account for some level of immunity from prior infections.
962,"Given those under 12 aren't going to get a vaccine anytime soon, the latest thinking is 85% of adults would need protection for herd immunity, which is extremely unlikely to happen."
963,We're at 10% of the population based on reported cases.
964,"That very likely means at least 1/3 of the US has become infected at some point and they have 80% protection for at least several months, and hopefully more."
965,"80% protection is significantly worse than the 3 approved vaccines, all of which are at least 90% protective 2 months after completing vaccination."
966,We have no way of knowing what degree of overlap there is between vaccination and prior infection.
967,"It's clear the vaccines (along with those previously infected having some immunity) have already driven cases down significantly, and what looked like the beginning of a 4th wave was stopped!"
968,It's definitely a matter of time.
969,"But the holdouts and those not getting 2nd shots are going to mean months before we're at herd immunity, if ever."
970,"&gt; The faster we vaccinate the rest of the world, the faster we stop mutations."
971,Us getting our 5th dose doesn't help end the worldwide pandemic.
972,Exactly.
973,The reason we're having so many mutations is the virus is going free to ravage around the world while people are slow to react.
974,Even moderate asthma was considered a chronic condition and got you moved up in my US state.
975,I'm really surprised that a respiratory condition wouldnt be treated the same in the UK.
976,...who maybe as a community care about each others’ wellbeing - what a novel concept.
977,I have mad respect for a community that comes together in times of crisis even if its effectively symbolic.
978,"And while transmission is unlikely outdoors, it happens so I’ll go the cliché route and say if one family was saved from the senseless loss of a loved one because the community came together, every mask was worth it."

984,But in 2021 you can make a real argument that you need a smartphone/computer plus internet for survival...people in this sub have posted for the last year because kids haven't had the ability to do school from home.
985,Do you honestly think Apple is making MacBooks because it's in the public interest to make sure people have access to computing in a world that is reliant on computing?
986,I'm guessing probably not.
987,"So, do you think Pfizer made this vaccine because it is needed to stop a pandemic?"
988,Because the same opportunity principle still applies.
989,"How do you think that this should go, in curious."
990,Would you force companies to make the vaccines and give it away for free?
991,How would you do this?
992,I’ve some friends that don’t intend on getting the vaccine.
993,"It’s a mix of laziness, genuine lack of care about their own lives, and “it won’t happen to me” about endangering others."
994,Then the rest of my friends are out there trying to get vaccines ASAP.
995,And people wonder why the majority of the population is overweight.
996,The average adult is eating almost twice the recommended amount for a standard person.
997,"My average as an active gym dude is 2600 to keep my current weight, 2300ish to cut a little."
998,And sedentary people are hitting way above me daily.
999,"That city is also incredible in the winter, specifically around Christmas."
1000,"God, I love Chicago."
1001,A paper cut is worse than a COVID shot.
1002,Taking the bandaid off after the COVID shot is worse than the COVID shot.
1003,"Hell, an itch is worse than a COVID shot."
1004,The psychological pain of watching an older gentleman being unable to walk-in to a Walgreens for a same-day COVID shot while your younger-ass gets your scheduled shot 5 minutes later is worse than a COVID shot.
1005,"The discomfort from the chair you sit in during the shot is worse than the COVID shot, unless for some reason they have brought in some Herman Miller chairs, and then it's still questionable which would be worse."
1006,"Hopefully I don't need to continue for anyone else who might hesitate, but it's been fun."
1007,Correct - it’s the highest number of new cases per capita over the past 7 days.
1008,&gt;Maybe mRNA was fully explained in other mediums ??
1009,"Yes, Fox told me everything I needed to know about mRNA vaccines"
1010,Where I live they are talking about full reopening…masks required.
1011,I don’t think there is any intention of lifting the mask mandates this year.
1012,My friends who moved to the Bay Area came back to visit florida and were still wearing masks outside while we played board games.
1013,It is definitely not about anything practical people are just so used to it in their liberal bubbles they became so numb and end up having it on always

1034,"Given the three leading hypotheses on why it happens, from u/AKADriver:

&amp;#x200B;

1."
1035,Autoimmune:  the vaccines have been shown to mold the immune response in a more  focused way and avoid the B-cell exhaustion common in infection that can  lead to misfiring and autoantibody production.
1036,Even in previously  infected people who already have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
1037,2.

1071,"Lockdown urban centres on priority that has more than 10 % test positivity or more than 60 % of the ICUs, oxygen capacity full."

1074,We would if we could.
1075,There's a limited stock of vaccines and a very tiny window during which you are able to book a slot to get a shot.

1674,&gt;Longstanding health disparities affecting ethnic minorities in the UK have been made acutely visible by the COVID-19 pandemic.
1675,"The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 among minority ethnic groups were present from the beginning, with Black and Asian patients in the UK being over-represented among those with COVID-19 receiving advanced respiratory support."
1676,[1](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib1) Analysis of data from Public Health England later highlighted that deaths from COVID-19 among people from minority ethnic groups were two to four times greater than those among the White population in England.
1677,"[2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib2) Several reasons for these differences were considered, including a higher prevalence of comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (eg, type 2 diabetes among British South Asians), greater social deprivation, large multigenerational households, differences in occupational risk, and delayed access to health care, which all disproportionally affect minority ethnic groups."
1678,"[3](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [4](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Despite these concerns, public health recommendations specifically targeted for ethnic minority groups at the time were limited."
1679,"&gt;  
&gt;In *The Lancet*, Rohini Mathur and colleagues[5](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib5) clarify some of these issues through a cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform, by analysing primary care electronic health records linked to COVID-19 PCR testing, hospitalisation, and death records from 17 288 532 adults in England (around 30% of the population)."
1680,"The authors studied up to 16 disaggregated minority ethnic groups covering two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and comprehensively examined the spectrum of COVID-19 outcomes, from SARS-CoV-2 testing through to hospitalisation and death, to identify where the disproportionate effects on ethnic minorities lie."
1681,"&gt;  
&gt;During wave 1 of the pandemic, Mathur and colleagues report, minority ethnic groups in England were younger and over-represented in deprived areas and large households, and were more likely to have diabetes."
1682,"After adjustment for other risk factors, South Asian, Black, and mixed ethnic groups were all more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than were White people in England, and had higher rates of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death due to COVID-19."
1683,"In contrast to other minority ethnic groups, South Asians in England had the largest household size, with only 20·4% having a household size of less than three, and had around double the risk of testing positive—the highest among the minority ethnic groups."
1684,"Importantly, when household size was adjusted for, the risk of death from COVID-19 in South Asians was attenuated (hazard ratio \[HR\] 1·26 \[95% CI 1·15–1·37\]) compared with estimates adjusted only for age, sex, deprivation, comorbidities, and clinical factors."
1685,"This finding suggests that the risk of COVID-19-related death, and potentially other COVID-19 outcomes, is, in part, mediated through an increased risk of household transmission that disproportionately affects South Asians."
1686,"&gt;  
&gt;The risks of COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death were greater for Black and mixed ethnicity groups relative to the White group during wave 1, with adjusted HRs for death of 1·51 (1·33–1·71) in the Black group and 1·41 (1·11–1·81) in the mixed ethnicity group."
1687,"However, during wave 2, these groups were no longer at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the White population, and their subsequent risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes were also attenuated, with HRs for death of 0·92 (0·73–1·16) in the Black group and 1·24 (0·85–1·83) in the mixed ethnicity group."
1688,"Although the reduced risk among Black and mixed ethnic groups during wave 2 was positive, it is concerning that the opposite was observed for South Asians, in whom the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes was exacerbated (1·87 \[1·68–2·07\] for COVID-19-related death)."
1689,"Reasons for these differences are complex, but policy measures introduced between the pandemic waves—such as access to COVID-19 testing, education, and tackling occupational risk—are likely to have been important."
1690,"Despite the wealth of data and what we believe to be generalisable study results across England, limitations of this study include the lack of some explanatory factors that are not routinely well captured in existing data sources, such as occupation."
1691,"Further work is required to understand why these differences have occurred, and in other settings."
1692,"&gt;  
&gt;The pressing challenge is now ensuring that COVID-19 vaccination programmes are rolled out effectively in all minority ethnic groups."
1693,Key to this will be ensuring that the need for increased vaccine confidence is urgently addressed.
1694,"There are reports of increased hesitancy among minority ethnic groups, including those working in front-line health and social care roles, who are known to face an increased risk of COVID-19."
1695,"[6](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [7](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [8](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Unless direct measures are taken to increase vaccine confidence, differential vaccine uptake could further exacerbate health inequalities faced by minority ethnic groups compared with White groups."
1696,"&gt;  
&gt;The value of being able to analyse routinely collected health data at scale to support the rapid implementation of public health and medicine regulatory recommendations using secure data platforms has been proven during the pandemic."
1697,"[9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [10](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) An ongoing issue remains the lack of adequate mandatory ethnic coding in National Health Service (NHS) medical records, compounding the difficulty in identifying the actual scale of health inequalities."
1698,"A key recommendation, which is in line with those made by health experts and Public Health England, should therefore be to comprehensively mandate the collection and recording of ethnicity data routinely within NHS and social care data collection systems."
1699,"[4](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [11](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Mathur and colleagues' findings clearly demonstrate the public health importance of not only collecting such data, but also making it accessible for analysis."

1754,But they also report that 35% of recent infections were in FULLY vaccinated (that is defined as 3 weeks post the 2nd dose I believe).
1755,Seychelles also moving into their respiratory viral season.
1756,I think it's just something to watch closely as the virus vaccine battle plays out in context of increased viral pressures (winter/cooler season) Vs decreased (late spring/summer as in Europe right now).
1757,"While kids tend to be low risk as far as symptoms (there are exceptions, and some kids have been very sick), they can still carry and transmit Covid."
1758,Vaccinating children will be an important step in working towards some form of herd immunity.
1759,We don’t have walk-in availability anywhere in Baltimore / suburbs of MD.
1760,I got second shot yesterday of Moderna and I had to drive an hour to a rural county to get it.
1761,"My son got his second shot of Pfizer last week at mass vax site in Baltimore but again, needed appt."
1762,my local CVS has a sign up that you need an appt.
1763,Yeah I completely agree.
1764,And it's sad.
1765,They've done a pretty good job of letting the climbers pollute the shit out of everest.
1766,To the point local water supplies around the mountain are being tainted by the amount of piss and shit melting off the mountain.
1767,The amount of trash and bodies that litter the mountain is disgusting.
1768,The fact climbers use the bodies on the mountain as navigation markers is disgusting.
1769,Theyre supposed to carry a certain weight of garbage off the mountain.
1770,But they just pay sherpas to do it for them.
1771,That says a lot of the people climbing the mountain
1772,A donut a day keeps the covid away.
1773,Or at least free donuts are a tasty way to celebrate.
1774,Simple joe doesn’t understand simple America
1775,"I mean, that qualifier is to protect THEM."
1776,You're safe.
1777,And at some point soon we're going to have to accept the fact that it's easy to get vaxxed now and if people refuse the risk has to be on them.
1778,"Yeah, it's a circular foam adhesive thing with a film over it that they injected through."
1779,"Which may be fine in the US, but it's not a good solution anywhere else right now."
1780,I agree.
1781,But the protection is only fully there when everyone has them
1782,That analogy doesn’t work because there are videos where people vape in a paper/cloth mask and the smoke leaks out of the sides and goes everywhere.

1788,They injected THROUGH the bandaid?
1789,Is this something new?
1790,Now I feel ripped because I got an old fashioned bandaid over the hole after the injection.
1791,"And all it took was unfathomable levels of death, despair and suffering."
1792,I wouldn't know who's vaccinated or not though
1793,Oh don’t you look silly https://youtu.be/pOrHlYBKB5c
1794,Make vaccines a global public property and share manufacturing process so more counties can produce it.

1804,I wish that EUA timeline was about 2 months earlier as this may be the perfect storm of fall increases before it can get approved and administered to any kids.
1805,"Hopefully Moderna can get their child EUA app submitted before that, but I think it's on a similar path as Pfizer."
1806,What's the protocol for getting the Regeneron cocktail if I'm infected?
1807,Has there been any improvements there?

1812,You need to look at it from a counterfactual position.
1813,What WOULD things be like right now WITHOUT the vaccine?
1814,Probably closer to the situation in India.

1816,&gt; Let's be optimistic; the vaccine probably didn't work for you.

1824,"Pretty much anything you want, so long as it's with other vaccinated people."
1825,Anyone attempting to climb including the sherpas should be required to be vaccinated first.
1826,"I know the country needs the money it brings in, but this is ridiculous."
1827,Had some friends admit they haven gotten it yet but are intending to when finals are all over.
1828,No one wants to risk being wiped out for a week in their most intensive studying time of the year.
1829,"In the BBC report, it says authorities  had received complaints about false positives so sent in an undercover officer to get tested."
1830,"After he tested positive, they swooped in and found re-used kits."
1831,I’d like to know what they were thinking sending the cop in.
1832,"Were they thinking the false positive tests were faked, maybe as a way to sell fake negative tests to customers who didn’t even need one?"
1833,Because I can’t wrap my head around thinking it was a contamination/hygiene issue and sending someone to check that by actually going through with the swab.
1834,My friends and family are planning a pretty normal summer starting Memorial day.
1835,Everyone who wants to be vaccinated is... (my husband has a few crazy R friends who aren't getting it).
1836,"Yeah, no shit."
1837,"But if we are all vaccinated, the potential to spread it gets significantly reduced."
1838,\^This.
1839,"A lot of statements like the one above were true over the course of the pandemic, but are really no longer true with &gt;50% of adults vaccinated."
1840,And even more things that were once true will become no longer true as an even greater percentage of the population get vaccinated.
1841,We need to start preparing people for a changing reality.
1842,"The government is corrupt and only cares for money, it is the poor locals with limited or no access to healthcare who will suffer from it"
1843,Pretty sure the India strain is already in Brazil.
1844,"When comparing this to Israel, remember that they used a highly effective mRNA vaccine and the Seychelles did use inactivated virus vaccines."
1845,"So, essentially:

Israel: 55% inoculated \* 90% effectivity =  50% immunity."
1846,Seychelles: 62% inoculated \* 65% effectivity = 40% immunity.
1847,In the same boat as you.
1848,"Had a lpt of trouble sleeping last night, have all the symptoms you mentioned."

1855,"Media is notoriously wish washy with its application of geographic terms, especially in regards to the Asian continent."
1856,"For instance, those four terms leave no room to describe how most of the landmass of Russia is within Asia."
1857,"Geographers and historians also are really pushing away from calling the Middle East, “the Middle East”, and instead push for “West Asia” or “Southwest Asia”."
1858,Do you mean c reactive protein?
1859,Just making sure.
1860,"Did she have covid, have any symptoms, any underlying disease?"
1861,"How rapid did the numbers rise, or was this a single test?"
1862,I dont think there has been a trial to prove the vaccines dont make women infertile but it seems to be a bunch of unscientific baloney.
1863,"&gt; The trials that lead to the FDA approval of the coronavirus vaccines did not include pregnant women, but some women became pregnant during the trial."
1864,"&gt; 
&gt; “What they found was that of the women in the COVID vaccine group ... **about 20 did end up getting pregnant, while they were in the trial."

&gt; 
&gt; Maybe they had gotten one dose and were about to get the second, and none of those people so far have had any adverse reactions to the vaccine, or have had any problems during their pregnancy."

1882,"Chill bro, I don't have any skin in this game, just pointing out what they said."
1883,I'm sure they can develop their own.
1884,I am guessing Pfizer will take what they learned from BioNTech and develop their own.
1885,They likely wanted a partnership to see if the new mRNA tech panned out.
1886,It's been wildly successful by all accounts.

1928,If not that's not a problem and they shouldn't be counted.
1929,What terrible messaging.
1930,"&gt;California’s  Department of Public Health says face coverings are no longer required  outdoors for fully vaccinated people except in crowded settings such as  performances, festivals and sports events."
1931,"\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Face  coverings are also still required in all indoor settings\[...\] regardless of vaccination  status."
1932,Basically CA believes the vaccination shot does nothing.
1933,"Most states do not have an outdoor mask mandate because the science has shown it is not necessary in the slightest (like one entire case of confirmed outdoor transmission in all of China)

Why would people go bother to get a vaccination if it doesn't change anything about their behavior?"
1934,"Yeah, this is going to be crucial to getting up to Biden's goal of 70%."
1935,Gonna need to make it so that people can just get it while going about their normal routines without having to invest much time or thought into the process.
1936,"yes, I mean a possible future one."
1937,Right now it seems all variants are more or less controlled with vaccination but south african one already raised some eyebrows.
1938,With that amount of cases in India it makes it more likely to appear.

1940,I dont know how NY will handle out of state/country people.

1942,We have so much extra vaccine that I cant see why they would turn you away but never know
1943,It was frankly shocking to me how Reuters positioned this.
1944,They've lost all credibility to me this year in general.
1945,make sure you dont hand it over but deliver it to the point of use
1946,Neither.
1947,"It means that based on the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated people contracting covid in the trials, your risk of catching covid is reduced by 82% of what it would have been."
1948,"This is different from ""18% chance to catch the virus after exposed to it repeatedly"" because that would assume you had a 100% chance of catching it under these circumstances if unvaccinated, which isn't the case."
1949,I don’t see how this is possible... a recent poll said 22% of American adults do not intend to get the vaccine and 18% are a maybe to get the vaccine.
1950,I’m pretty sure those were the numbers I saw on job Oliver a week ago.
1951,That means of all the people willing to get the vaccine we actually have to hit almost 100% or change the minds of that 40%
1952,"It means that when comparing vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations with similar behavior, the vaccinated population sees 82% fewer COVID cases."

1967,*
1968,Guess they want to act like what China did.
1969,Not a good idea.
1970,They are not even imposing a hard lockdown now.
1971,The odds of a significant variant goes down to nearly zero if everyone got infected at the same time.
1972,Simply because everyone would be getting infected with the same variant and changes wouldn't be able to build up.
1973,So your whole 'ticket' analogy is flawed.
1974,"Geez, anti vaxxers might hold out longer and be getting free cars in a few months"

1979,So it's possible the inflammation caused by the immune response to the vaccine caused it in this person.
1980,It's also possible that person had another infection going on.
1981,It's also possible to be something else entirely.

2053,"Yeah, took forever before any of us frontline workers were able to get vaccinated."
2054,I wouldn't
2055,&gt;Nothing suggests these deaths were caused by infections at the school.
2056,"Anyone knows whether 82% efficiency with a vaccine means that 82 out of 100 people are 100% protected and the others not, or that any person has a 18% chance to catch the virus after exposed to it repeatedly?"
2057,I know the technology is old but I am speaking strictly in behalf of covid 19 research.
2058,"&gt; The truth is that Pfizer didn’t receive any funding from Operation Warp Speed for the development, clinical trial and manufacturing of the vaccine

2059,Outdoors and everyone fully vaccinated?
2060,I personally would not worry at all.
2061,Cases should continue to decline throughout May and into June.
2062,You could perhaps also post information about Israel's investigation into Pfizer's vaccine to do with heart problems.

2068,"I think offices should allow vaccinated workers to go without masks, but keep requiring them for unvaccinated."
2069,It will be a big incentive for a lot of people who are mildly vaccine hesitant but hate wearing masks.
2070,I know it would encourage a lot of people at my workplace to get the vaccine.
2071,I agree.
2072,"We should not just accept that 30% of the US is going to refuse, we need to make a better effort to help them understand the value of getting vaccinated and use restrictions to force the issue if we still can't convince them."
2073,We were never going to reach 100% but even 60-70% is far too low.
2074,"If I'm understanding you correctly, it sounds like you're saying that the vaccine may have induced temporary Bell's Palsy in the person who experienced the seizures?"
2075,That the seizures themselves were basically a type of Bell's Palsy?
2076,"Or, rather, is it that this person always had and continues to have Bell's Palsy, and the vaccine simply aggravated the condition in a way that induced seizures?"
2077,Or is neither of those what you're trying to say?
2078,Yesterday Osterholm said it's time to party and today Cuomo actually made a rational COVID decision.

2081,With mRNA it's about 1 week from the first dose.

2086,"Not just viruses either, I think BionTech were working on an individualized cancer medicine/vaccine based on mRNA technology."
2087,"I originally believed that, mostly because India could produce such a large quantity."
2088,Now I see India with a highly effective home made vaccine making 10 million a month and I’m confused.
2089,No one seems to want to answer why countries with massive programs like Russia and India have their own vaccines but can barely bump out anything and require Pharmaceuticals for funding and securing resources.

2094,"The reason the EU isn't done yet is that the US and UK decided to hog their own supply, forcing Pfizer and AZ to export only from the EU, until a few days ago."
2095,"If the US and EU both shared the burden of export proportionally to production capacity we would likely see both above 50% with a first dose now, and the EU ahead of the US."

2104,1st do they really need a early warning center in Berlin?
2105,And 2nd seriously on the budget?
2106,And if they float but vertically then they're a little off and are still safe to eat
2107,Is that because you wore masks outside?
2108,"Not in the case of AZ, many european countries are doing a 12-week interval between AZ shots as that has been shown to be more effective than the initially proposed 4-week interval."
2109,"So basically if you get your first shot in June, you wont be considered fully vaccinated until mid september."
2110,This is TOTALLY WRONG.
2111,Every adult in Tennessee is eligible for the vaccine.
2112,Walmart and Sams are offering walk up service.
2113,I’m not elderly or health care and I’m fully vaccinated with Moderna.

2116,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

2118,"If I have to wear a mask until everyone's vaccinated but can still go do things I enjoy, count me in."
2119,"I hope so too, but there's always the possibility it could plateau."
2120,"People really seem to have stopped giving a fuck since the vaccination really took off (at least where I live), so it's probable that cases won't go down as fast as they otherwise would."
2121,"But nothing can really stop the vaccines, so it's still just a matter of time."
2122,An article about terrible Covid predictions that doesn’t mention Neil Ferguson and his Imperial College Model is nothing but bias.
2123,I would argue that Ferguson caused more damage and confusion regarding Covid than any other person besides Trump.
2124,India is limited by a testing cap so it is likely that they will deliver the same 350k for the coming days.
2125,"I’ve always wondered how US and British intelligence agencies, as well as other countries, seem to have completely missed the beginnings of the pandemic."
2126,Do they not review medical issues?
2127,"As a college student, the feelings about covid have changed dramatically with nearly everyone having their first dose, if not second."
2128,"Beginning of the semester, we went everywhere with masks on (including walking by yourself)."
2129,"Now, they turn a blind eye to us studying in classrooms with masks off since cases are so low (students making up less new cases than faculty)."
2130,See here for an explanation: https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/05/04/spike-protein-behavior
2131,This seems really unfair to young people who were at the lowest risk for COVID and health issues to begin with.
2132,"In Canada once we have 80% vaccinated we can start seeing our friends outside, distanced with masks isn’t that so exciting"
2133,It will be around 5 weeks probably for first doses available for all adults in Canada.

2161,"Given the low viral prevalence in VN + vaccination status, I'm not sure what you gain from such a long quarantine period for a vaccinated person."
2162,Hopefully they'll make moves to pick up their vaccination rates.
2163,"VN's largest trading partners will be open this coming fall, and vaccinated people will want to return to Vietnam."
2164,"The argument of ""imagine if lockdowns never happened"" is dishonest."
2165,"It is unfalsifiable, there is no way we could test this hypothesis as there is no place in the world that just had let it go."
2166,But looking at the correlations between countries harshly affected and their level of restrictions we find... absolutely nothing.
2167,"That is why we have 14k dead in Sweden in May/2021 instead of 100k in June/2020 with policies very far from ""suppression""."
2168,Because the model was so full of shit.
2169,I guess you can say the Pfizer vaccine was not *takes off sunglasses* a Nice Shot!.
2170,Yeeaaahhhh.

2172,"Assuming that the ID check doesn't stop them (which it should), I would imagine they will have a pretty bad reaction since their body will have antibodies."

2175,And sooner or later I'll get it with a new job.
2176,"California spent hundreds of thousands of dollars filling up skateparks with sand, purely out of spite."

Thankfully I do not live in India, I live in a first world country with a much smaller demographic density, where the healthcare was never more than a bit stressed, where until vaccinations were rolled out 90% of the deaths were of people older than 70, and where about 1/3 of the adult population is already vaccinated."
2213,There is no reason why we should adopt the same solutions as India.
2214,"All I can figure from seeing clusters of downvotes occasionally with others and myself, I think there are some packs of people on the sub with viewpoints I can only guess are very conservative for want of a better blanket description."
2215,No

2220,"Really, Biolyse Pharma, who has only produced oncology meds for their entire existence?"
2221,The company that almost got put out of business by Health Canada because they had serious deficiencies with their manufacturing equipment and only got reinstated after agreeing to replace much of their equipment.
2222,I don’t think anyone wants another EmergentBio scenario or worse.
2223,"According to the HHS Minnesota is predicted to have some of the lowest vaccine hesitancy rates in the country, so slowdowns there are definitely quite telling

60% vaccinated is still fantastic though and may be enough"
2224,What's the obsession with fauci?
2225,Is he the most important communicator of anything covid related?
2226,Great thing none of the coronavirus vaccines carry such a risk.
2227,I have a BS in Biotechnology and I studied vaccines thoroughly enough to understand how they function.
2228,I won’t be getting this vaccine.
2229,Go ahead and teach me why I should get it.
2230,"There were at least a number of states where wearing a mask while exercising was not required, mine included."
2231,"My gym doesn't have as high ceilings as other gyms, and it had a pretty young clientele so I figured their risk profile is likely greater (more mingling)."
2232,"But I went to the gym since June 2020, 5-6 days a week and never caught anything."
2233,I only started wearing a mask toward September because prevalence was increasing.
2234,"My 50's YO mother also went to another gym regularly, also never had an issue."
2235,"Still baffled as to whether it was just luck, or that the population at the gym is healthier/skews younger (so infections go undetected), or was it that the ~40% of voluntary mask compliance was sufficient to mitigate."
2236,Must be great to live in a state where kids can defy the dangerous beliefs of their parents.
2237,Such consent laws must be a result of anti-vaxxers posing a public health threat.

2240,A few days ago I had heard this week.
2241,What happened?
2242,That is a very misleading headline that makes it sound like they were all vaccinated and only one wasn’t infected.
2243,[deleted]
2244,"The problem with your argument is that you don't address if the 1 in a million who died after being vaccinated had another underlying health condition that kept them from building antibodies, or if they were exposed before 14 days after their second dose."
2245,There have been multiple studies proving that outdoor transmission is not as insignificant as you claim - especially when community spread and infection rates are high.
2246,"Outdoor mask wearing was absolutely the correct thing to do in San Francisco, and adherence to mask mandates was one of the reasons why San Francisco had some of the lowest infection rates compared to other densely populated cities in the US."
2247,With tranquilizer guns shooting darts full of covid vaccine.
2248,You would be wrong.

2253,If NASAs fire data satellites can see differences the NRO certainly can.
2254,Things have absolutely hit a wall here in Minnesota (currently at 58.9% of the 16+ population) and I'd say we're pretty much middle of the road if not a little better than average in terms of vaccine uptake.
2255,"They're doing about 15,000 first doses per day (7-day average) right now, which equates to about 0.3% of the 16+ population."
2256,"At that rate it'll take more than five weeks to hit 70% but with the way things have been slowing down it's probably more reasonable to think we're 8-10 weeks out, if we ever get there."
2257,"Curious to see how the states and feds handle it because if your state isn't there now, it'll be there pretty soon."
2258,Some of us just aren’t pussies.
2259,CVS fucked up my vaccine appointment by allowing twice as many people to book that day as they should have.

2267,"Church meetings, however, were stopped intermittently throughout SK's COVID mitigation but they're being handled through capacity limits at this time."
2268,You say that like the common people are asking for that.
2269,Sucks to have a POS religious zealot tasked with governing 1 person let alone 1 billion
2270,We aren’t stuck with restrictions forever.
2271,We are stuck with them until we can get enough vaccines into people to make a difference.
2272,Look at India to see what could have happened otherwise.
2273,And that is why they are complete fucking idiots.
2274,"Ah, that makes much more sense!"
2275,Thank you for clarifying and making the charts!
2276,Yeah I hope so.
2277,Supposedly we should have everyone fully vaccinated who wants to be by end of summer so I would hope we start diverting shipments to other countries at that point.
2278,But I worry people will still want to hoard for booster shots.
2279,Zero surprise.
2280,Only people with money in India are treated as human beings
2281,"My speculation:

The only activity that's actually going to end up requiring vaccination is international travel, and even that won't be actual verification, just someone looking at your vaccination card, so it will essentially be the honor system."
2282,You can print out your own vaccination card and fill in your own information.
2283,It's just as legitimate as anything anyone else got.
2284,"Yup, those rumours are the only thing giving hope to people"
2285,Nationalism is one hell of a drug.

Do you have any citations?"

So it appears they're working on this."
2291,Why isn’t a concern with the vaccine since the vaccine causes your body to create the spike protein?
2292,Where I live (upstate NY) for the most part you absolutely will be confronted and asked to leave.
2293,People will call the police and have you removed if you refuse to put a mask on or leave.
2294,"I have not yet been anywhere where someone hasn't been masked, but my wife has once –– in a bagel shop where a guy refused to put a mask on so they just charged him a $20 asshole fee."

2341,"It's not percent of the age group that's unvaccinated, it's percent of the unvaccinated population in each age group."
2342,"Basically saying that among the unvaccinated, about 39% are 0-17, 19% are 18-29, etc."
2343,Personally while I appreciate the effort I don't find it super informative but perhaps I'm missing the takeaways.
2344,"Bars, clubs and stadiums at capacity crowds haven't been the norm in most of America and still aren't."
2345,That's when things are normal.
2346, Brings a tear to my eye.
2347,I got my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Monday and I had no side effects.
2348,Just regular vaccine arm soreness for a couple hours
2349,Yeah it feels like it!!
2350,She was sec of state and ended up in the role due to....either death or resigning of governor at the time.
2351,I should know but don’t
2352,Lot of conservatives coming out of the woodworks
2353,"I'm impressed you managed to not only carry over, but then shove all those words in my mouth, DEEP_STATE_NATE."
2354,Oh did your landlord build your house/apartment?
2355,I think maybe 1-3% of those who get it and show symptoms?
2356,"Meh, I had probably the worst side effects possible and will tell people if they ask but otherwise I’m not running around telling people I had a 102 fever and the chills for 24 hours straight"
2357,[deleted]
2358,Nice strawman.
2359,Even if that's the case - and I think there are quite a few writers / artists / musicians / inventors for whom money is the biggest motivator - it doesn't change the fact that intellectual workers need to support themselves.
2360,And that's doubly the case for intellectual workers like scientists whose intellectual work is really expensive.
2361,"18-29 year olds have been eligible for a vaccine for only a month or so in most states, in California, only like 2.5 weeks"
2362,"Chicago went from having to stalk appointments 3 weeks ago, to being available same-day today."
2363,Stark contrast.
2364,I'd bet a lot of folks haven't yet gotten the memo it's easy now as at least here it flipped real fast.

2377,The clinical trial was for a certain period of time (when they reached enough data).
2378,"it was NOT based on specific incidents of exposure, like you originally said."

2447,Just speculating.

2449,Look at the science.
2450,Because I have kids who can’t get vaccinated yet and would be devastated if they get infected while I’m protected.
2451,Because I have a good friend who had a kidney transplant and was told that he’s going to need to be protected by herd immunity since the vaccine isn’t effective for him.

2461,That's likely just there to cover asses and a statement overriding it that 86s the guidance to wear masks in general is made long before then.
2462,Especially since Biden is unrolling a massive plan to reach 70% with at least one dose by July.
2463,"Profit isn't the only possible incentive, but it's the only one that actually exists in the real world."
2464,Every other incentive to really drive research is purely theoretical.
2465,World governments absolutely should not remove the profit incentive without a concrete plan to replace it with something like a massive increase in government research funding.
2466,To remove the corporate profit incentive *without* offsetting it is absolutely short-sighted lunacy.
2467,Cool if only they did not pause astrazeneca vaccine here in the Netherlands......
2468,"&gt; VN has limited medical capability (VN held up this good this far is more about managing and controlling capability and social cohesion to prevent spreading than capability of caring for huge loads of patients)

2470,What do you think?
2471,"As the pandemic is ending in the US now, I look back on how much of the world fared."
2472,"Even though it was intense here in the States, society here ultimately chose to sustain COVID damage while continuing life with much less restriction than much of the UK/EU/Canada/Oceania."
2473,This approach obviously couldn't work in a developing country-- you'll end up with India and Brazil.
2474,I hope that Vietnam can get their people vaccinated sooner than later.
2475,Hopefully some of US' supply will divert to Vietnam in the coming months.
2476,I'll buy my plane ticket as soon as they recognize my vaccination and drop quarantine requirements.

2478,"I didn’t get close enough to anyone for them to cough in my face, and 6 feet of distance between my daughters and me, and everyone else, was not only attainable but observed."

2481,Cool when can i be vaccinated in my country that is failing day after day telling lies.

2530,Pfizer didn’t even do the bulk of the R&amp;D it was buontech who got public funding from the German government.
2531,The idea there wouldn’t be an incentive because Pfizer’s profits went from tens of billions to 5 billion or something along those lines is patently ridiculous.
2532,These vaccines will be hugely profitable and have garnered more positive press making it more likely that companies would want to get in on the ground floor for when god forbid we have another major pandemic.

2644,I work for a large fortune 500 in a pretty liberal area.
2645,They aren’t going to be mandating it as far as I can see.
2646,They are taking a very neutral approach and messaging around the “personal choices“ perspective.
2647,I think they probably would encourage it but they aren’t really doing it directly.
2648,"Look, shinypenny, you can wear masks outside for the next ten years, even after getting both vaccines plus your booster and a case rate of 0 with 0 hospitalizations and 0 deaths."
2649,"It’s no skin off my back, you do you."

2677,Finally joined the two dose crew today.
2678,Here’s to putting this pandemic behind us once and for all
2679,Give me a fuckin date/time and I'll be there.
2680,Solo Bolo
2681,We as a country thought the 1/3 pounder was smaller than the 1/4 pounder so my expectations remain low
2682,When's it opening for 12-15?
2683,"Every time this happens somewhere everyone has the same question “we were supposed to wear a mask outdoors?”

Nobody I know has really done that."
2684,Indoors is a very different thing.
2685,It’s not possible.
2686,But I get the act of goal setting.
2687,But how do you avoid COVID?
2688,Everyone will probably get the vaccine first or the disease first eventually.
2689,Look at India.
2690,So much suffering.
2691,I pick the vaccine first.
2692,"But follow this to its conclusion: You're 90% less likely to be carrying it, and 95% less likely to experience symptoms."
2693,That means any interaction of vaccinated people carries 0.5% of the transmission risk of developing symptoms compared to the same interaction with unvaccinated people.
2694,"For all but the most vulnerable individuals, you can return to normal interactions right away."
2695,Keep quality high.
2696,"Wow, if he can deliver this… I’m ecstatic just thinking about it"
2697,"received the shot around 4:15, felt fine in the hours leading up until bed except for a sore arm then woke up in the morning with my symptoms."
2698,This would be awesome.
2699,My kid has been asking for  his vaccine.
2700,LoL
2701,"Yup, I have a well-educated friend who’s doing this."
2702,We also have a family friend who’s a surgeon who opted not to get the vaccine til very recently because he wasn’t sure about the side effects - I think he heard about an incident at his hospital or something - but ultimately he got vaccinated after seeing it not harm anyone he knew.
2703,Be civil.
2704,Right I get what you’re saying.
2705,"My point is that the covid vaccine is more effective and Covid is much more dangerous than the flu, so you would hope that the numbers would be higher than for flu shots."
2706,You need to go back and read my comment as I just mentioned that long-term health effects are the issue.
2707,Kids aren’t allowed to eat on campus in my county in the Bay Area.
2708,Half day hybrid classes
2709,"Why is this being downvoted, this is a great idea"
2710,I really don't even know where to begin.
2711,"I would suggest deeply evaluating the basic, fundamental principles of science."
2712,Upon which consensus is a key aspect.
2713,"Things like ""heretical"" ""burnt at the proverbial stake"" and ""questioning authority"" make me think you are either trolling, or suffering from some sort of conspiratorial mental illness."
2714,"That vaccines were never applied to people, AFAIK."
2715,So it proves my point that regulatory agencies are able.
2716,It's really sad that not getting infected with covid-19 isn't a good enough incentive.
2717,[removed]
2718,"No, it's businesses making decisions to keep their customers safe

The real breach is selfish assholes restricting others' abilities to live and breathe"
2719,[removed]
2720,"It's not as much those of us in and immediately around the city that are like that, but the outlying counties and towns are just Pennsyltucky all around."
2721,"I broke off a TON of familial relations over the last 5 and a half years because I was sick of the bullshit, and this pandemic has reinforced that I made a good call."
2722,I like this line of thinking.
2723,Real question though are you sure you’ve actually had the flu?
2724,Because when you have the flu it  bothers one a great deal.
2725,I find a lot of people use the term cold and flu interchangeably.
2726,There is a significant difference.
2727,"I have found the old saying true, “if you think you have the flu you have a cold."
2728,"If you think you are dying you have the flu.”

I’ve only had it about four times in my life but it has been very different than any cold I’ve ever had."
2729,Typically there’s three or four days in the middle there where I have trouble physically getting out of bed.
2730,Not in the sense of sort of a metaphor but actually physically getting out of bed to the bathroom is very difficult with the flu.
2731,Not at all.
2732,My point is QC is difficult at best with a fragile vaccine that requires very specific parameters or it is useless.
2733,Much less with supply chain issues and not enough material to make the vaccines.
2734,Is that right?
2735,If they are doing more dosage testing than they did with the 11-15  group that would explain some extra time.
2736,I thought about your last point and that could make sense too.
2737,I hope they are trying to under promise and over deliver!
2738,Doesn’t dispute a thing I said

2759,I wonder if forever maskers will start to feel silly at some point and take them off.
2760,There was a great article in the Atlantic about liberals who don't want restrictions to end.
2761,"As a liberal, I've felt out of place with how to feel about pandemic policies."
2762,"I think a lot of liberals reactions, politicians included, are reacting to the extreme callous response from the Trump administration, but went too far in the other direction and are afraid to quit now."
2763,"Too many liberals are not following science, and I worry about what they're doing to their children's development and their own mental health."
2764,What was the two?
2765,Small Pox and??
2766,?
2767,A lot of Republicans did it early on as well.
2768,I remember Ducey in AZ didn't want Phoenix and Tempe issuing mask mandates and I believe he banned it for a time.
2769,Plus the AV vaccine is different tech than what most sites are offering: Moderna and Pfizer.
2770,I don't think it's irrelevant to my thoughts or feelings about a new vaccine.
2771,Dying or hospitalization aren't the only possibilities- long COVID is also a concern.
2772,"As I said, I have no problem with an annual vaccine."
2773,And younger family members are getting the vaccine too.

2944,"They expect companies, whom people like us work for, to make a vaccine for a deadly virus for free."
2945,Why would we pay those hard working people who work for Pfizer?
2946,Hmm people are stupid sometimes.
2947,"Yes of course they are going to make a huge profit.. they made a vaccine (that works) to end a global pandemic and get our lives back to normal, but what do I know"
2948,Correct.
2949,Is this not what I claimed and what you asked for a source on?
2950,For me it was a little bit of disinformation.
2951,"My Grandma kept saying she couldn't get an appointment, so I thought my young self who has the ability to comfortably work from home and never need to leave should stay home until she at least can get it."
2952,Then it just turned into her not being able to correctly make the appointment online until my uncle did it for her.

3049,"It’s not about the possibility of flu symptoms, I frankly don’t care about experiencing the discomfort."

3060,Both of us had Covid back in January.
3061,I lost my taste and smell and had a slight sore throat only.
3062,Mom had it bad and had to go to the hospital at one point.
3063,Does that mean anything for us getting our shots?

3065,Or how does it work?
3066,Any advice would be great.
3067,"As scared as I am, I’m probably getting the vaccine anyway."
3068,it's better to have deadlines and goals set by the government for vaccines.
3069,I'm from india and the Indian government failed to do so.
3070,A lot of innocent people are dead and are still dying.
3071,Please support your leaders and make this vaccination drive a successful one cause I know a lot of people would've survived in my country if this drive was conducted by my government.
3072,Don't think things for granted.
3073,I think the first thing India needs is transparency about how bad Covid spread is over there.
3074,"After the Prime Minister's failure to handle Covid, I don't trust his ability to implement a proper lockdown."
3075,"From the perspective of an Indian living in the US, it took me a while to fully grasp how serious things are."
3076,This was with following news coverage over the past few weeks.
3077,"Lack of transparency is even worse in India since the national government is censoring information, and my relatives over there aren't exactly sure about what's going on."
3078,"In my opinion, it is going to take the collective action of countries across the globe to help India mitigate Covid."
3079,I'm concerned about a situation where India has 10+ million deaths because we didn't take action soon enough.
3080,I find this sub's obsession with mask mandates a bit strange.
3081,You don't see it on any European subs.
3082,"I feel that it may be because there are so few other restrictions that actually impact people, that it's the only one that people can call for to be loosened."
3083,"I agree with the argument that restrictions should be eased as vaccination rates rise, but I just don't think getting rid of masks is a big enough motivator."
3084,"If you said that bars, clubs or large events won't happen until there's enough people vaccinated, I think you'd get a lot more hesitant people on board."
3085,If no one is dying even after catching covid with this vaccine then yes it is doing its job well and yes that is key in ending this pandemic.
3086,That's not actually true anymore.
3087,Everyone I talk to wants covaxin.
3088,There are people who are actually waiting for covaxin to get vaccinated.
3089,Many doctors are also recommending covaxin if available because it apparently has fewer side effects.
3090,"Where I am and among my co-workers, covaxin is a lot more popular."
3091,Well it sounds like y’all are being careless and not enforcing anything
3092,"Well, CoronaVac apparently has been successful in reducing hospitalizations in Chile by a significant amount so it has that going for them."
3093,"But both vaccines are kind of suspect and in the case of Sinopharm China's own disease official didn't think it was very effective, as stated in the article linked above in the comments."
3094,Really the main selling point for these vaccines is that they are cheap to make and easy to transport.
3095,&gt;I’d feel safe running maskless through a COVID ICU ward.
3096,"Like you do have protection, but it certainly wouldn't be recommended to go maskless if you're so surrounded by it."

3111,There’s just no place there for me anymore because I trust the science
3112,“A great number”.

3114,"That is a 0.0078% chance of getting Covid after being vaccinated, and even lower of dying."
3115,"At some point, we need to accept that it will be a slight risk to reopen, but that the risk decreases as more people are vaccinated."

3135,But nobody is dying there isnt that the primary objective of the vaccine?
3136,At what point do you stop calling it a pandemic if the death rates are below typical
3137,There are crazy side effects that occur or can occur so rarely they basically go unreported.

3188,Herd immunity is always an elusive term.
3189,Current rate should be enough to stop a lot of spreading and the rate it stops rises as vaccination rates rise.
3190,"It’s gonna be hard to say a day where this ends, it’s more of an ongoing down slide of cases but probably hard to reach 0"
3191,Are u Indian?
3192,Because our RTPCR labs have a backlog of 5 days.
3193,Mumbai is an exception in this where thay give report after 2 days but most of the labs are unable to process .
3194,Also many people are opting for CT scan than RTPCR the government are not counting them as positive.
3195,Even CT scans report are not coming before 2 days.
3196,Most of the time RTPCR is coming false negative (source: my aunt who died had ct scan showing 36% infection in initial stage but her rtpcr came back negative).
3197,"The Government is just not testing enough, they can't test enough they don't have the resource."

3203,No fever or flu-like symptoms at all though.
3204,"Slight headache like 60 hours later, doubt it was related."

3243,This describes my brother and his girlfriend so much.

3246,"But like, he doesn't work and smokes pot all day, he has the time."
3247,"And like, my boyfriend has been stuck out of the US for so long now and I just want to see him so like, I want us to get vaccinated faster."
3248,I wish people weren't stupid/lazy.
3249,Certain places have certain vaccines.
3250,"But as of right now, you can pretty much chose which vaccine you want as it's widely available."
3251,Just go to a place that offers the one you'd want.
3252,I would go without if I could.
3253,"My state still requires it, and I absolutely despise working out with a mask on."
3254,It would be nice to study just 1 dose of pfizer.
3255,From some initial data it seems 1 dose will match or actually improve efficacy over J&amp;J
3256,That's sort of good to hear.
3257,"Not that you haven't been able to get it yet, but hopefully that's the case for many young people and one of the reasons that comparatively few have gotten it."
3258,"I wasn't in a rush to schedule a covid shot, because I was low risk and figured others needed it more."
3259,"I got my first shot a while ago, but I'm sure there are others who haven't noticed that scheduling is easy now."
3260,Job?
3261,do people get paid here?
3262,:)  Does the Cautious Management team get paid?
3263,"some states are putting in place vaccination benchmarks for reopening, that could get some interested parties pushing harder."

3271,"&gt; A team at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://cmg.cds.iisc.ac.in/covid/) in Bangalore used a mathematical model to predict about 404,000 deaths will occur by June 11 if current trends continue."
3272,"A model from the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://covid19.healthdata.org/india?view=total-deaths&amp;tab=trend) at the University of Washington forecast 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July."

&gt; India reported a record 3,780 deaths on Wednesday for an overall toll of 226,188, along with 382,315 new cases, taking its outbreak past 20.6 million infections."
3274,"In recent weeks, the scenes on the ground, with long lines outside crematoriums and hospitals turning away ambulances, have painted a picture of a nation overwhelmed by the crisis."
3275,I'd multiply the death prediction by a factor of 10-20x since India isn't counting all the deaths.
3276,"Underestimates like this make India's situation seem less serious than it actually is, and makes us less likely to take decisive action."
3277,Under the jail
3278,We'll get there sometime this summer.
3279,I bet August will be wild.
3280,"Too many ""intelligent"" people thought covid is a bad flu and you're home for a few days and if you die, well it's just your time to go."
3281,🤦‍♀️
3282,"According to an Indian doctor in the trenches, they need more doctors, staff, supplies, and oxygen."
3283,"India needs help from the world in that regard right now, along with very strict measures to slow the spread."
3284,"Vaccines too, but they need help to control the giant surge."
3285,"Are we seeing a massive effort of doctors, in the US for instance, ready to head to India?"

3304,NPR has a couple pretty good articles about how the oral polio vaccine is still used today and still causing very few polio cases in poorer countries.
3305,It's an excuse.
3306,They're not actually going to suddenly accept the safety of the vaccine when the FDA moved the checkmark over to a different column.

3348,"This may be partly because we're high risk, but I think also because our training teaches us how to do proper risk assessments for things like vaccines."
3349,It's disappointing to see so many highly educated people in other fields refuse the vaccine.
3350,I attribute a lot of this to people thinking they know more than they actually do and then doing incomplete/flawed risk assessments in the process.
3351,Maybe it's time you started caring about somebody other than yourself.

3413,This is all in addition to the fact that leaders of the OWS stated that they had never planned to use FEMA or the NG to distribute vaccinations because it seemed like an overreach.

3463,Definitely the case in the Chicago suburbs right now.
3464,They're shifting away from mass vax sites and are doing more shots in pharmacies and grocery stores.
3465,The metrics are designed to be forward looking.
3466,"It takes weeks from the implementation of measures until they show up in the statistics, so applying the restrictions when it appears growth in hospitalizations is accelerating is needed to ensure that by the time the momentum does drop off, hospitals haven’t been overwhelmed."
3467,It’s why you don’t hold your foot to the throttle until the last moment and then jam on your brakes really hard and hope you stop in time.
3468,"Case growth (or decline) has, effectively, inertia."
3469,And give the t-shirt cannon girls tranq guns
3470,&gt;The next step is to just have it available for people at grocery stores for walk-ins without appointments kind of like they often do with flu shots.
3471,With the expiration rate of these vaccines and the lack of availability worldwide I honestly hope they don't do this yet.
3472,It would cost people in other countries their lives to make things slightly more convenient for Americans.
3473,[removed]
3474,The winter months when I couldn't see my friends and spend time with them was rough on me mentally.
3475,"I live with just my parents, so I got the need and importance to be cautious then, but man it was hard."
3476,"It got easier and I opened up a bit to start seeing my friend group again after my parents got fully vaccinated because it was a risk I was OK with taking, and i've been mentally in a much better and much more sound place since."
3477,It's so nice being able to see friends again with regularity.
3478,It's such a mental relief and source of immense comfort and I think people online and on Reddit and Redditors really underestimate just how important and relieving being around friends and family truly is.
3479,"Now that around 60% of my friend group is fully vaccinated and the rest of the 40% either have had one shot or have appointments for their first shot, we've planned out a trip for later this summer and it just feels so damn good."
3480,Perfect figure to talk with... at least until it disappears when you look away
3481,70% is a harder goal than the other ones he’s said
3482,"&gt; To hit 70% PARTIALLY vaccinated would be another ~700,000 new people."
3483,That seems reachable.
3484,"The only population level stats I can find is that 10-14 is 863,849	people and 15-19 is 850,986."
3485,It seems like 12-15 should give us a decent bump especially in non-pennsyltucky regions of PA.

3501,I do miss traveling abroad though.
3502,"I dread the return to ""normal"", and if anything, I'm having anxiety going back to the way things were."
3503,Hopefully our work from home program can be extended or become a permanent option now that it's proven to have no impact on operations.
3504,So if I pay 100 I can skip?
3505,Deal.
3506,If you come to Edinburgh I hope I see you on my tour
3507,That’s not how it works though.
3508,"Once your population is vaccinated enough, your R0 value falls below 1 and cases start dropping."
3509,It takes time for the vaccines to reduce the case load dramatically.
3510,It doesn’t take time for the vaccines to start the case reduction.
3511,"I’m bad at math, what impact will opening up the vaccine have to 12-15 year olds?"
3512,Guess they won’t be counted because under 18.
3513,I haven't seen any widespread reports on it similar to the reports after the 1st dose among those that have had Covid prior.
3514,"That said, I really haven't read anything official from a professional on this so I don't want to speculate either way."
3515,"Again, I would say either way the low-grade fever was a small price to pay for my peace of mind after the past 14 months."
3516,[deleted]
3517,"Covid took a lot of people from us, not all of them died though."
3518,That is so important too.
3519,"Anyone over 80 is far more likely to die from any condition, even a weak cold or regular diarrhea."
3520,I had very painful injections for a badly broken finger when I was a young child.
3521,I think that's why I'm so afraid of needles.
3522,If I watch a video of someone getting an injection there's a good chance I'll faint.
3523,And I have fainted a lot of times when getting vaccinated over the years.
3524,"But for my Moderna vaccines, both of them, it was fine."
3525,"I psyched myself up for it by yelling "" I'm gaining a superpower!"""
3526,It worked.
3527,It helps that the needles are smaller these days and it really doesn't hurt much at all.
3528,[removed]
3529,"This would take too long to explain, and biology isn't my main field of study, but I feel like someone on here needs to educate what ""variants"" and ""mutations"" truly are regarding pathogens."
3530,"Fact is, there are thousands of variants and mutants of all sorts of different pathogens, but that doesn't necessarily make them more or less dangerous."
3531,"People on this sub seem to treat these potential new variants like they would be different Influenza types, but that is not the case."
3532,"Influenza A for example is an entirely different subtype when compared to Influenza B, but all of these Covid mutations are still the same subtype of Coronavirus which is SARS Cov 2."
3533,"With all of this said, every Covid 19 vaccine should be effective against a majority of these ""mutations"" since it's in the end all the same virus, but some future modifications may be needed."
3534,"This is the best way I could explain it, but someone else more knowledgeable in this field of science would probably explain it better."
3535,"I'm studying to be a librarian, not a biologist lol."
3536,I guess I just have to weigh out the pros and cons.
3537,"Pros: 

Back to normal, certain level of immunity, can do fun things again, probably won't lose taste and smell again for a bit."
3538,"Cons: 

COVID-19 again."
3539,They do t have a lack of vaccines though right?
3540,They’re just being really bad about logistics
3541,Sounds like he’s an idiot
3542,And there’s a lot like me likely.
3543,"I want the vaccine, I’ve just been so damn busy with no sick days yet to take."
3544,Either you have a set limit or you don't.
3545,"This isn’t accurate, in my area, appointments only just became available for those who aren’t in an at risk group (job/age/health)."
3546,"Everyone has been eligible for a while, but you couldnt get an appointment."
3547,"Given that, it’s going to be mid June/early July before everyone who wants it has a chance to get fully vaccinated (21-24 days between shots then another 14 for full effect)."
3548,I do t have a link but I literally heard an epidemiologist on NPR today say the “cocktail” is unproven
3549,"I mean if I'm fully vaccinated (which I will be in a couple of weeks) and my friends are as well, it's one of the situations where the CDC has given the go ahead to proceed mask-less, there's no way in hell we're not hugging and dapping it up when we greet each other after a long time of not seeing other in person and also upon going our own separate ways until the next time."
3550,Same with hugs with regards to my family.
3551,"If there's first, there's second."
3552,The UK's vax numbers dropped off a cliff Monday and Tuesday as well.
3553,Interesting.

3555,"No, Denmark had this planned before discussions about the EU one started."
3556,"And most countries are just going to be using it for travel, rather than requiring it to access places."
3557,I honestly dont know.
3558,"I just graduated, but even before last Friday, communication from the university regarding COVID updates has been abysmal."
3559,I hear the same from friends and siblings elsewhere.
3560,Never even got the mask the university claimed they would issue me.
3561,"Theres a local hospital that looked to be doing drive-thru vaccinations for a while, but I havent seen any activity there since vaccinations opened for me."
3562,The only appointments I'm seeing in my area now are all Walgreens.
3563,"I am also an out of state student who doesnt yet qualify for residence in my current state (where my job is as well as my college), so I'm not sure what rules of the rollout apply to me."
3564,My home state is... running behind.
3565,"The decentralized rollout is a huge confusing mess, but I'm going to try and make an appointment next weekend (post-move) and just hope for the best"
3566,"Really awful timing, my state opened eligibility to everyone on April 12th."
3567,Was plenty of open appointments when I scheduled my first dose and when I helped schedule my cousins.
3568,"Sorry man, hope yall get through the worst of it soon."
3569,"It was about a day and a half for me, but it responded well to Tylenol."
3570,At least this time one can’t say he is setting easy expectations and taking credit for it.
3571,I’m for it.
3572,The EU Green Certificate or whatever its new name is today always allowed people that don’t yet have the vaccine but have a negative PCR the same privileges as those that were vaccinated.
3573,This is just Denmark using that framework at a greater speed to test it out and implement it
3574,"The goal, most likely, is to knock it out in the first two weeks of school."
3575,"Do it like they do scoliosis testing - bring an entire class down to the nurse's office, administer the vaccine to each student, observe for 15 minutes, then send them back and call up the next class."
3576,Idk their intelligent but not scientifically not mathematically which js sum most normal American people lack of tbh
3577,"Without the profit motive, these mRNA vaccines would never have been developed."
3578,"If you can’t see that profit motive is critical for driving innovation, I don’t think anyone can help you."
3579,"“PAH is a fatal disease without a cure that can affect both males and females of any age, including children [12,13]."

3582,"&gt; I don't know about bioNtech's expertise in mass production

BioNTech's Marburg factory has 1 Billion doses output annually."
3583,I think they have enough expertise.
3584,;)
3585,Yeah it's mind blowing.
3586,I'm in such a bubble where nearly all the people around me have a healthy weight.
3587,Yes be safe and take care.
3588,West virginia is back paying it *shrug*
3589,&gt;I felt that way about the vaccine pauses too.
3590,"&gt;
&gt;Yes, reasonable people will understand that scientists pausing vaccinations to study more data should increase your confidence in the vaccine."
3591,But what do we tell the people who spout the vaccines are safe and effective but then cite the fact one gets pulled due to safety issues?
3592,Especially because safe and effective was communicated before this?
3593,The problem will be IP deals...
3594,"But if they managed to get that, will be very promising, not just for Brazil, but to export the vaccines."
3595,"Likely unconstitutional

3596,"As someone who had side effects, it honestly wasn’t that bad."
3597,"Like, it wasn’t fun, but I’ve had worse colds."
3598,"So just have some Tylenol and Gatorade on hand, and be prepared to feel sick for a day or two, but it’s not going to kill you."
3599,"Hey, another Eagles fan!"
3600,Thank you for the response.
3601,I honestly figured the first shot could possibly be worse because the antibodies are already in the system.
3602,"But my follow up question... would this mean the second dose isn’t as bad, or even bad at all?"
3603,Authorised*
3604,Wasn't there an SMBC comic about this?
3605,"Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine according to the Seychelle's governments webpage

3609,At least you're getting yours soon!
3610,I'll be waiting until August for mine.
3611,And the university is in charge of administering it?
3612,I sort of feel that America's extremely decentralised distribution is one of the reasons for the slowing uptake.
3613,"They’re both very effective, so it depends on if the slight increase in effectiveness or the convenience of only needing one dose is more important to you."

3617,Both are undercounts.
3618,"I would counter that Taubman's story is just a cute anecdote presented decades after the supposed focus group occurred, and many burgers both bigger and smaller than the Quarter pounder have come to market and found success."
3619,"The success or failure of a new dishes hinges on many many factors, to boil it down to size isn't enough."
3620,"Also Taubman has never explained how he had the results of the focus group study presented to him, was it a single person bad at math, did a study coordinator exaggerate how many it was as a cute anecdote, did Taubman?"
3621,Or maybe it's a cute whimsical anecdote that allows A&amp;W to present their many issues at the time as being boiled down to 'stupid rubes didn't realize what they were missing!

3623,"I'm over here in Florida where DeSantis just lifted all restrictions with no caveat whatsoever and I'm reading this like, ""Fuck, that's actually a really good move I wish we could do that."""

3629,My university only opened the vaccine to the general student population right before dead week -- when every major project deadline is.
3630,"Aka, the week before finals, about 2 weeks ago."
3631,"That's not a lot of time for a huge amount of people, and the message I've received up to now is my demographic is and should be the lowest priority anyway."
3632,"I dont go out for anything but groceries and takeout anyway, and I wear a mask even in the drive through, so I figure there are still those that need it more than I -- but apparently I'm behind the times now."

3643,"No worries, it happens to the best of us!"
3644,"It sounded like he meant ""this is a bad thing because it will make people distrust the vaccines"""
3645,"Yes, no one has ever proven that people thought the third pounder was smaller."
3646,Taubman the head of the company at the time recalled decades later that some people complained they felt like they were getting ripped off because the Third Pounder was more expensive.
3647,No data from the study was ever presented and it was never made clear how Taubman was presented the information.
3648,It could have been as few as a single person who was bad at math in a 20 person study who felt like they just had to come up with 'any' feedback.
3649,Or it was a funny story an project coordinator told him about a study participant that was exaggerated for comedic effect that now gets repeated by Taubman as a potential reason for 'why' the failure happened.
3650,Or it could just be a funny story that he spun that isn't really rooted in fact.
3651,"All we know is the Third-Pounder didn't do as well, as to 'why' is a big question that could have countless legitimate market forces responsible for it."
3652,"Many larger burgers than the quarter pounder have come to the market and not dethroned it, when you are rolling out a burger to usurp a multi-billion dollar company you have to beat them in a lot more ways than size; flavor, price, speed, cleanliness of facilities, ease of getting in and out, rolling your restaurants out in cities where they are wanted and can be competitive, making sure you are growing at a good rate and making sure competant and motivated managers are in charge, perception of the quality of the product, etc."
3653,"Look at the success and growth of InNOut, Five Guys, Chik-Fil-A, they all offer products smaller than the quarter pounder, which have been successful and carved out market niches and persisted."
3654,The SIZE is not the end all of the success or failure of a burger.
3655,The anecdote for me is just a cute story that tries to pass the buck on A&amp;W's many problems off to 'stupid customers'.
3656,I think a stimulus check but only for the vaccinated would be more effective.

3663,Exactly.
3664,This would have been a great policy to implement 6 weeks ago.
3665,Now it doesn’t matter.
3666,"&gt; India’s daily COVID-19 shots have fallen sharply from an all-time high reached early last month as domestic companies struggle to boost  supplies and imports are limited, even as the country fights the world’s worst surge in infections."

3668,I’m sorry you got downvotes.
3669,I’ve got a toddler.
3670,School last year was closed for 3 months.
3671,"When it reopened, the principle had sent an e-mail telling parents that all toddlers had emotional and social underdevelopment."
3672,So Belgium also claims to priorities schools due to emotional and social development and because face-to-face education is vastly better than a zoom meeting.
3673,"I won’t speak about other countries but in Belgium schools were never the “engine”, multiple studies showed this."
3674,"This meant that sometimes schools had to close because just like in society, the infection rates got too high."
3675,"It could be that in other countries schools were/are the “engine” of the epidemic but that depends, imo, on health care, occupation rates (I have seen American high schools with jampacked hallways), rules (from the government and schools themselves),..."
3676,"I mean, we’re already getting 69.420%."
3677,"&gt; Brazil will be able to gain more than 200 million vaccines against Covid-19 per month

PER MONTH is missing from the headline."

3687,Pfizer was the first company to seek emergency use authorisation for its vaccine in India late last year.
3688,"It withdrew its application in February after the drugs regulator sought a small, local safety study for the shot before considering its request."

3702,There's a different flu shot every year.
3703,No reason why this wouldn't be similar.
3704,And then we may get a spike again in Winter because not enough people got vaccinated.
3705,"Your insurance rates are not going to go up as soon as you get the vaccine, if they will at all, so when you get it is a bit of a moot point."
3706,"If rates do go up in response to mass vaccination (and still haven’t seen any proof that will be the case), it will be as a result of aggregate use and not your particular vaccination."
3707,Do your rates go up every time you see a doctor?
3708,Why would that be the case now?
3709,"And if that’s still such a concern, find a government administered site and bypass your insurance."
3710,Why now rather than later is as noted - the quicker we get more people immunized the more we’ll control the spread.
3711,"What you do is up to you, but there’s heaps of evidence that suggest you should get it, and earlier rather than later."
3712,"That won't touch those on medicare (59m), in the military (12m), in jail (3m), on medicaid (57m), on ACA Medicaid/Basic (13m)."
3713,And the 159m on employer based plans only pay 18% of single premiums so they'd only be motivated by 18% of the reduction (single only).
3714,"There are also 30m uninsured who wouldn't be motivated by this, plus the many uncounted (homeless, undocumented, etc.)."
3715,"The most direct, consistent, effective motivation is cold hard cash."
3716,Holohan couldn't care less about the economy.
3717,"If anything, he and his team have been criticised for focusing too much only on public health."
3718,"And our infection rate is lower than the US, so there's no need for the vaccinated to stay at home still."
3719,Sure.
3720,Obviously it doesn't make sense for the engineers working on aircraft/bomb development sitting at Wright Patterson AFB.
3721,The military requires vaccines for certain populations depending on need.
3722,Covid is a big deal.
3723,The difference between Covid anxious people and the examples you give is those other groups aren't trying to use their anxiety to restrict others.
3724,"I can understand why people want schools open, but I mean closing everything but leaving schools open doesn't make much sense."
3725,And having too wear masks and keeping kids separate also hurts their emotional development
3726,"Indoor dining is at 100%, but markets are at 25%?"
3727,That doesn't make any sense.

3768,"Similarly, I spent basically an hour on the phone calling 2 vaccine providers to try to reschedule my 2nd dose for a better time, but in the end stuck to my original appointment."
3769,"To me both are important, which is why I dedicate time and energy for both, and I tried to get my shot as early as possible."
3770,"But the reality is there are people who don't think their vote or shot matters, which is why we are where we are today."
3771,That's just the reality.
3772,"As I explained, getting your shot today doesn't dramatically change your life tomorrow, and so people who live in states with substantial restrictions feel like they can just wait because all of those restrictions don't just go away tomorrow with their shot."

&gt;In a systematic review of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that **less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors."
3791,** But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
3792,"&gt;“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said."

3810,This statement assumes that people can't separate politics from science.
3811,"Since the people who can't are already half anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers (I have to assume some people are pro-mask pro-vax for purely political reasons as well), it's not really useful to cater policy to them."

3972,Eh.
3973,I think it's reasonable to be scared of COVID.
3974,There's a gray area between not taking any risks and refusing vaccinations and coughing on people lol.
3975,"I am vaccinated so I'm not super scared for myself, but I am for children who could still be exposed since they're not old enough to be infected yet, and I am scared about how long it'll take to go back to normal."

4037,You’re just trying to be real and throw some caution out there.
4038,Thanks for that.
4039,And also thank you for being careful around kids.
4040,No one seems to care that they can’t be vaccinated.
4041,"When they say vaccinated, do they mean fully vaccinated?"
4042,"The type of people refusing to get vaccinated are not wearing masks anyways, so not much of a carrot there..."
4043,I bet there are some folks who’ve gotten the vaccine but tell their anti mask anti vax anti humanity friends they haven’t.
4044,"For what it's worth, there were tons of college kids in my area (SoCal) in line getting their shots, when I went both times for mine."
4045,"I think those numbers only stand to improve as it becomes more widely available, and as campuses and workplaces start to require the shot, once it has full FDA approval."
4046,Hey guy you need to rewrite that word salad becauseI couldn’t understand what the hell you were saying.
4047,It just sounded like you don’t wanna get the shot because people you knew got the usual side effects?

4206,We just moved from an area that had a large religious group that refused the vaccine.
4207,"yeah miami was my first thought about desantis' political stunt of banning mask restrictions even on the local level

i understand loosening restrictions on the state level and letting local municipalities set their own rules, but straight up telling a city you cant have restrictions is borderline criminal."

4255,Why July 4th?
4256,Everything America does is so patriotic
4257,I did.
4258,Saying that 95% efficacy equals 1 in 20 people who are vaccinated getting COVID is incorrect.
4259,12 and up coming this week so we will need them
4260,I was merely asking a question to a situation I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around.
4261,"And this is hardly creating a “toxic” work environment or something that would cause unrest, that’s a little dramatic."
4262,The reality is some people can’t get vaccinated with the current vaccines for medical reasons and therefore trying to understand how all of this fits together.
4263,Reasonable accommodations are used in these situations.
4264,Hey but isn't it at least a little neat to be resistant to anthrax?

4270,And there's only been more data from there.

4272,"Yup, get your vaxx, ice cream and pot all in one place."
4273,"I've seen some slightly less optimistic things published too, but let's assume for purposes of discussion that's at least a reasonable ballpark estimate, and that variants won't change things too much in the near term."
4274,"So, if you were in circumstances where your unvaccinated self would have caught covid, instead you only have a 5% chance of an asymptomatic case, and 5% chance of being symptomatic."
4275,"That's not bad at all, but it's enough that vaccinated people should know about it and think about it, since it doesn't take much (being outside, or masking up with decent ventilation) to improve the odds a lot more."
4276,We could order less F-35s and aircraft carriers.
4277,Also tax people that make over $400k more money.
4278,Unless you are one of those people.
4279,"In which case, can I borrow $50?"
4280,"Well, Boston also isn't opening until 8/22 so it's not exactly like we are incentivized to keep it up."
4281,Opening and vaccinations are inversely correlated in this country lol
4282,A PCR test will usually still be positive for a week or more after the virus ran its course.
4283,"Errr.... Say what you want about Canada's healthcare system, but in Canada, nobody has to file for bankruptcy because of their medical bills; women don't get hit with a $50,000 bill right after giving birth; nobody dies because they can't afford insulin."

&gt;Seventy percent of nursing homes are for-profit operations, a factor that’s been linked to the spread of COVID-19."

4307,Something likt 60% want it.
4308,"But of the remainder, half are more in the ambivalent/skeptical range rather than refusal, and could be won over with some incentive"
4309,I got both my vaccine shots in a church.
4310,"Granted it was probably leased out, but churches are *commonly* used for government events in my area because they're distributed across the area, they have rooms large enough to host large numbers of people, they generally have good parking lots, and they're not in use for long stretches of time."

4394,"&gt;  Problem is that they aren't very available   


I dunno, despite production delays AZ provided around 300 million of the first billion doses produced, I'd say that isn't bad, particularly given many of these doses were administered in poorer countries."

4396,"I know they've issues with the EU, but the EU isn't the world."
4397,"In terms of the poorer parts of the world AZ is the only vaccine to be delivered at scale through COVAX with 30+ million doses already delivered, I don't think anyone else comes close."
4398,&gt;  That's one of the myths floating through the British press.
4399,Actually it was the German Merck and not the American MSD with which Oxford wanted to cooperate.
4400,Regardless after the endless threats we've had from the continent after AZ announced delays to the EU I'm very glad the UK production was in the UK so that it couldn't be blocked by an increasingly vaccine nationalistic EU.
4401,I think it would've gone differently had the UK had no Oxford vaccine production.
4402,They're pretty much requiring people to renew their drivers' license in order to travel domestically anyways (although this was just pushed back) due to Real ID.

4432,Where are you thinking that the vaccine doesn't prevent COVID?
4433,"Moderna and pfiZer sit at 90% efficacy, which goes a very long way in protecting the innoculated, and as for transmission, we are starting to see data which suggests that transmission is greatly reduced."
4434,"The only reason this was never ""guaranteed"" is because Moderna and Pfizer didn't have the time to track that while working to get their vaccines up and ready (they were focused on safety and protective efficacy) 

The vaccines ideally stop you from getting covid, and greatly reduce our chances of getting ill."
4435,"But if I am maskless with another person who has COVID, the vaccine should work to reduce my likelihood of infection."
4436,Vaccines thus work both preventively and in a manner of reducing severity.
4437,"And the more people that have it, the more the chain of transmission can be interrupted in a population, which is huge for helping reduce the proliferation of variants."
4438,"You are correct that mutations are inevitable, but the faster you immunize a population, the more likely you can reduce the chances of dangerous and vaccine resistant mutations from developing and spreading."

4450,"Yeah, even me as a fully vaxxed Pfizer recipient I would feel better once that happens."
4451,"I'm not scared or worried really, but anything to reassure the decision (and potentially get further shots) is very helpful."
4452,"I don't blame skeptics, I think the country didn't do the greatest job at explaining the history of mRNA vaccines."
4453,"Well, I should clarify that I say that as a 36 year old that hasn't had cable TV in several years and gets most of his info from reddit and the internet at large, friends, etc."
4454,Maybe mRNA was fully explained in other mediums ?
4455,?
4456,Well if his last goal means anything; it means it should be a 140% by then
4457,No low risk states yet though :0
4458,"He single-handedly killed the credibility of any models for COVID coming out of Imperial College, any time a model appears it's instantly laughed at by most people."
4459,90%
4460,Its interesting topic.
4461,These incentives will be needed at the organisations where anti vax philosophy is strong.
4462,But at the same time this means that people are getting rewarded for being ignorant.
4463,I doubt that these type of incentives will roll out in places with better educated populations.
4464,My niece (6) and nephew (9) both recently got Covid.
4465,The only ones in the entire family this whole time.
4466,Fortunately they're doing fine.
4467,I hope this vaccine for kids comes soon.
4468,I’d say yes up to a point.
4469,We are already seeing the point where it is plateauing because people don’t want them.
4470,Some people can't empathize very well so they think since they haven't gotten it they won't .
4471,or they think that since so and so got it and they didn't that they cannot get it.
4472,They also are not able to think in terms of long term consequences or doing something to help everyone else.
4473,And they know they are not the only ones.
4474,And then there are people who don't like calling and making appointments.
4475,I think they should be able to send a text somewhere and them someone calls them and sets up for someone to come to their house to give the vaccine.

4498,&gt; Then the smart choice would be to not make a cocksure dismissal of the danish decision based on data concerning the obese US population with bad access to your dysfunctional healthcare system during your disastrous handling of the pandemic.
4499,Danish case and death statistics are more than enough for me to draw the conclusion I did.
4500,Your whataboutism isn't working.
4501,&gt;And who is dying today?
4502,...people who were infected 3-4 weeks ago.
4503,"If you looked at a graph you would have noticed that people have been dying at this exact rate for the last 3 months, so it's not like any of this is new."
4504,It's been going on for a very long time.
4505,"&gt;Perhaps be a little humble when you are completely ignorant of the reality in Denmark, which for the whole pandemic has been entirely different from the US."
4506,Maybe look at your statistics before getting all righteous.
4507,&gt;Bingo.
4508,Google translate is a thing and I provided you the fairly accessible document that details exactly how they made this conclusion.
4509,The conclusion doesn't make sense given the numbers we know about blood clot fatality risk.

4513,Fine by me.
4514,Pfizer and Moderna are pretty much saving the world.
4515,"Even with the better vaccines, you can still get infected."
4516,It is just less likely.
4517,What is important is whether the vaccine can reduce serious symptoms and hospitalisation/death.
4518,[removed]
4519,I think they need to have people who will go to their house.
4520,With paperwork and a 15 minute period for any immediate effects to show it could be done in 22 minutes or so.
4521,Or whole families in 30 to 40 minutes.
4522,And have a database that tells who is vaccinated by Social Security number.

4529,Any “long term” side effects would show in several weeks.
4530,My point is that neither is certain and theres no long term data on the vaccine.
4531,Maybe I get Covid and die.
4532,Maybe the vaccine increases your risk of cancer long term and I die in 10 years.
4533,Fact is you don't know.
4534,I will never shame someone for making that choice.
4535,"For me, quality of life matters more than actually being alive (I'm a pretty depressed person and my life doesn't really mean much to me), so if we can get back to normal, it doesn't really matter if it turns out the vaccines have long term consequences."
4536,The bottom line is that every individual should have the right to make up their own mind.
4537,But the government needs to respect that and lift mandates when demand bottoms out instead of holding us all captive and blaming people for not wanting a vaccine that was authorized before it was fully approved.
4538,"Sunday figures are always low in the UK, and Monday was a public holiday."
4539,Expect them to bounce back to normal over the next day or two.

4578,yeah it’s gone pretty well to shit lmao
4579,Only Moderna.
4580,Pfizer doesn’t have the same durability.
4581,Why is India so picky in this situation.
4582,Pfizer is probably the most tested vaccine available.
4583,We don't have backward contact tracing in the US though so we don't have a good way of knowing whether outdoor transmission was a factor.
4584,"What we do know is that in countries that did really well handling the pandemic like Vietnam and Taiwan, people don't mess around with their masks, put on and remove their masks when passing people outside, etc."

4611,I just got vaccinated today so I have 2 weeks until the antibodies build up.
4612,I also live in a low COVID area relatively.
4613,We have had 3948 cases with a population of 34908.
4614,That is 9.8% of the population with 107 deaths which is .3% of the population.

4638,And then they consciously lose business at a time where they’re about to die due to COVID restrictions from the government.
4639,Most won’t refuse.
4640,In the article it says that more than 60% of the population is fully vaccinated.
4641,So I think they made quite some progress after mid April.
4642,"Nevertheless, more than half of the vaccinated population got AstraZeneca which is not mentioned at all in the article."

4648,Yes it does.
4649,"&gt;  If you look at the daily death statistics

And who is dying today?"
4650,...people who were infected 3-4 weeks ago.
4651,I also provided Denmark’s vaccine calendar where you can see what groups will be affected how much by the delay.
4652,"(Hint: not risk groups)

&gt; Try and focus on reality here."

4657,Now
4658,Yah Alabama isn’t getting there 💀👻 rip my current state
4659,"Same here, the only thing I missed was going to band practice every week but we managed to find a way to practice from home."
4660,I travelled so much for work in the past years that I welcomed being confined in a town :)
4661,I’ve been vaccinated for 8 months (I’m in the moderna clinical trial) and I haven’t been told I need a booster shot yet.
4662,Where did you get the 10%-25% numbers from?
4663,They have used Astra-Zeneca and Sinopharm to vaccinate the population there.
4664,As we saw in a South-African trial Astra-Zeneca seems to have trouble with the SA variant.
4665,Sinopharm seems to have somewhat 'low' efficiency too.
4666,Lmao right.
4667,Live in SoCal.
4668,Literally know nobody who’s been affected by it.
4669,"But, whatever."
4670,I’m vaccinated.
4671,Idc about this virus anymore
4672,People who got infected can also get the shot.
4673,If experts are saying 70% they almost certainly took into account the estimated people that were already sick(And estimating how many of those also got a shot).
4674,Epidemiologist don't tend to forget epidemiology 101.
4675,Wow this is so refreshing to have a president set realistic positive goals that I believe can actually happen based on his past accomplishments
4676,If you'll vaccinate millions of people you will always have some people that didn't build a sufficient immune response.
4677,The vaccine is 95 % effective (give or take).
4678,If nobody could catch covid after vaccination it would be 100 % effective.
4679,I live in a big metro area and we've had same day appointments for almost a week now.
4680,Now seems like a good time.
4681,"Yeah, Fauci  dancing in an outrageous costume will convince teenagers."
4682,"I’ve read elsewhere that many women who become nurses are evangelical Christians, and there’s research now that shows there’s a pretty big overlap between evangelical Christians and belief in conspiracy theories."

4685,I've had previous anaphylaxis so Pfizer was out for me.
4686,I appreciate the information.
4687,In the unlikely event the Norwegian government allows citizens to volunteer for the AZ vaccine they should have all the relevant information available to them.
4688,"At the same time I am surprised Canada only has two deaths so far, but I guess that may be due to the fact that the younger population is yet to receive it."
4689,A good chunk of USA is really ~~stupid~~ uneducated.
4690,"I have serially killed many a bottle of rye in the past year, I'll say that."
4691,**Pfizer.Is.Killing.It.
4692,"**

Holy shit great job on them, they're also expected to get approval for emergency use for 12-15 possibly next week and they're expecting children to be approved by September!"
4693,It's insane that the articles talking about them showing any profits this year are full of comments bashing them like this was all a grand conspiracy to greedily make money or something??
4694,"The fuck, we genuinely owe Pfizer a great deal after they stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond."
4695,Nah not me.
4696,"If outsiders come in, the world might see how badly India is actually doing instead of their unreliable numbers."
4697,"There are many lucky scientific discoveries and inventions 

In the current context the vaccines was not designed or tested to work against the variants."
4698,Viruses can mutate randomly and none of the mutations has resulted in decrease of vaccine efficacy.
4699,Some of it is due to the way vaccines were designed and some due to sheer chance that none of the random mutations defeats vaccines.
4700,To say there is no luck in science is wrong
4701,And if the employer reports you to the FBI for unlawful use of government seals then what happens?
4702,"Yes, I even wanted to sign my kids up for the trials but wasn't able to find one locally."
4703,It's the same shot for the 12-15 age group and same formulation but adjused dosing for younger.
4704,"By that sense, if you were comfortable with the shot for yourself, it's not very different for kids."
4705,Frankly those people are only pro vax for show.
4706,They probably are actually scared if they were honest with you.
4707,Thing is that one in a million doesn't even show any correlation statistically.
4708,It was done out of being overly cautious.
4709,Definitely being used on over 65s in the UK.
4710,I suspect we would have seen a similar result with or without the pause.
4711,"The clotting cases were already in the news that week, and since then it's been the only fucking thing I hear about for people who don't want to get vaccinated."
4712,Nothing really to be done.
4713,Most americans don't get taught stats.
4714,"The system failed them, and they don't have the tools to understand what these results mean."

4748,I'm hoping it's sometime this fall.
4749,"By then, many senior citizens would be starting to get to 9-12 months after their last shot, and potentially waning immunity."

4780,"It's a circular foam object with a film cover, hole in the middle, with a localized rash reaction where the vaccine was injected, not spreading past the item."
4781,Amen.
4782,It’d help my anxiety a lot.
4783,"It's so weird, right?"
4784,Like they're upset about tons getting rushed and a rush of side effects.
4785,"But when they actually do what they should and slow down to assess a possible problem, people feel _less_ safe?"
4786,"Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather get on the roller coaster run by the guy who's paranoid about every weird noise than the one who's like ""eh that's probably nothing""."
4787,"teacher here, I was elligble for a vaccine in my state in mid march and I F5'd my browser for a week straight to get a vaccine appointment, didn't care what time of day or day, thankfully my school let me leave for a period to go and get my shots."

4847,"They made breakthroughs but had a long, long way to go."
4848,"Interestingly, they made some serious leaps forward in some of the technology used in the process of the research (crystalizing viruses in zero-g, etc), though they had a bit of a setback when Columbia broke up."
4849,I think you're well within your rights to do this considering it's your own house and especially if you're not fully vaccinated
4850,"""Here's a coupon....now put on a mask like people who aren't vaccinated"""
4851,Some of us give a damn about others... like the large group of people who can’t reap the benefits of vaccination due to medical problems.
4852,"There’s also the issue of variants... allowing covid to spread in the community will allow it to mutate, leading to a variant that could defeat the vaccine."
4853,That’s going to put all of us at risk.
4854,We have to stop being so selfish.
4855,"well, that doesnt help me does it?"
4856,"all the government is talking about is ""removing priortization"" from June onwards, but i am 100% certain that getting an actual appointment will take months."

4862,[removed]
4863,They are going to reach a plateau very shortly where people don't want it because they will still have to wear a mask and the vaccine is practically guaranteed to make them feel sick.
4864,"If Biden wants this to happen, then he needs to make an announcement that if we hit 70%, the mask mandate goes away nationwide."
4865,Otherwise nothing will change.
4866,Maybe you don't know that.
4867,"I'm predicting an uptick in serial killers, not nearly as bad as back in the peak of serial killers since we have better mental health coverage and understanding and stronger policing and surveillance but still an uptick."

4874,"As an ambivert, it's very interesting to see how the pandemic has sort of made introverts more visible."
4875,I have heard that fewer demands for socialization put on introverts as a result of the pandemic has improved their mental health.
4876,I enjoy solitude and socializing in equal amounts personally.
4877,I find the pandemic was helpful in giving me time back for my solitary activities but I did miss my friends.
4878,That's even more of a reason for you to get vaccinated.
4879,Because the sickest among us might not be able to.
4880,Instead you'd rather spread covid around.
4881,I can completely understand them

4887,Remember smallpox?

4889,I don't.
4890,Luckily the generations before mine eradicated these horrors.
4891,"I absolutely realize how much that blows, believe me."
4892,In fact it should have never happened that way.
4893,They should have ordered enough vaccine from the beginning and given it to all ages across the board.
4894,They really fucked up but I will never blame the now vaxxed people for it.
4895,It's not their fault.
4896,I'm happy they get some relief from this insanity.
4897,They need money for their families.
4898,They are already risking their lives carrying other people’s belongings up the mountain which most of them do for the money.
4899,"Some sherpas are mountaineers like any other country, like the group that managed the first  winter summit of K2, most of the rest work on Everest because it’s how they earn the most money."

4902,I guess the whole we live in a bubble thing...
4903,I guess...
4904,This is the case by me now for about 1.5 weeks

4919,Maybe they are not a real nurse.
4920,Or maybe they have just fallen in a conspiracy theory rabbit hole.
4921,Being a nurse doesn't actually mean you are an expert in infectious disease either.
4922,Seeing all of these adults refuse a vaccine when my young kids are not eligible is sickening to me.
4923,These people have an opportunity to protect themselves and the people around them and they are being incredibly selfish about it.
4924,Cases for kids are on the rise due to these new variants.
4925,Such selfishness.
4926,"Yes, I’ll get my 1/4/6 yr olds vaccinated as soon as it’s available."
4927,I breastfed after getting my own vaccination so hopefully some immunity passed along to my baby.
4928,I will say one of the anti-vax pro-Covid (as in trying to get it and spread it) people I know got vaccinated (ironically before anyone else) because it was mandatory for their nursing program (yep).
4929,"Before, they said they wouldn’t get it because they￼￼￼￼ “didn’t want to die.” Insisted that anytime they’ve gotten the flu shot they got the flu."
4930,Weird how they didn’t mind “dying” when it got in the way of their career choice.
4931,Also weird how they didn’t once complain of any side effects like the rest of us.
4932,Oh well.
4933,At least they can’t hurt anyone now.
4934,If we could at least have vaccinated-only events with perks that would be swell.
4935,Yes but that concern will be the same now as it will be in 10 years so if it’s used as justification for not opening up now it can be used in10 years as well
4936,"Then you aren't looking, mate."
4937,"These surveys, polls, and data are everywhere showing the spread in COVID vaccinations and hesitancy between cons3rvatives and lib3rals."
4938,I tried to go through the health department.
4939,All the pharmacies have signs up that say they don't have the vaccine.
4940,I'm in East TN around Knoxville area.
4941,Admittedly I haven't tried outside my county because I think you have to be a county resident but I'm going to call around and try to find out since I know it isn't statewide now
4942,I've basically lost all hope for getting a decent amount nationwide.
4943,"Thankfully, I'm in a state that still is getting at least a decent amount of vaccines..."
4944,"Nah, let all the anti-science folks sit together and spread it amongst themselves, it'll get us to herd immunity quicker."
4945,That's one extreme but the other one being comfortable with the idea of spinning up new variants of concern around the world isn't a good position to take either.
4946,This of course becomes less of an issue as more of the world becomes vaccinated.
4947,[deleted]
4948,&gt;can require consent to check their vaccination records for attendance.
4949,Consent is mentioned.
4950,That would not be a HIPAA violation if there is consent.
4951,"Part of me wants to say this is why some are waiting

As they get more desperate to vaccinate more people, these kinda bonuses might get higher and higher, and with very little changing for you after getting the shot in terms of mask mandates/travelling

Very little getting people rushing out the door to get one"
4952,The political/social divide of the US (and its near 50/50) split is somewhat unique.
4953,Sadly it also spills into every aspect of life now.
4954,"Before it was ""politics"", now it's just a way of life."
4955,Be thankful that you don't have to deal with that.
4956,"&gt; but the US is split between rural and cities

In terms of spreading of a virus, not as much as you or the top level poster are saying."
4957,Look at influenza for a second.
4958,"Even in places where you and I would say ""They don't think COVID is real, They aren't doing anything,""  influenza is gone."
4959,Why?
4960,Because they are still pretty closely tied to the cities.
4961,Diseases move pretty far and wide.
4962,"Even in the midst of the biggest slow down in international travel we've seen since a World War, we're still seeing variants traveling across the world in relatively short order."
4963,"These things move around and if we truly do hit herd immunity, we will see cases slow to a crawl and outbreaks, even in rural areas will be newsworthy."
4964,"I mean, I think of my rural MIL."
4965,"Lives in a ""town"" with 8 people."
4966,Where'd she get COVID from?
4967,Her relative visiting from Albuquerque.
4968,"Sure, it's just an anecdote, but when you say ""there will be pockets all over the US where the pandemic continues to kill"" I think you're forgetting that these pockets still need to be seeded with cases."
4969,One also needs to consider that R0 isn't constant between cities and rural areas.
4970,Having a higher rate of vaccinations in cities may actually be better in strangling this thing out.
4971,"We might only need 55% vacciantions (alongside natural immunity) to hit herd immunity in Salina, UT whereas Manhattan might need 88% or 92%."
4972,"Back to the ""seeding the cases"" thing."
4973,"Many of these really rural areas, they aren't like the city that you and I live in where this thing is constantly swirling."
4974,That's part of the reason that COVID denial kicked up.
4975,"When the country started locking down, they hadn't seen any cases."
4976,"Part of that was a lack of testing, but it was still a good long while before it found it's way into these areas and so all the while businesses are hemorrhaging cash and they don't see anyone dying."
4977,"Well then it pops in and kills 12 people in the nursing home a town over, but then they contain it and no one's getting sick for awhile until someone else from three towns over who caught it from their sister who lives in the city brings it into the local diner."
4978,We currently are experiencing 1 case for every 6000 people per day.
4979,A community of only 500 people?
4980,They might not be seeing a case but once a month.
4981,"And sure, chains of asymptomatic people could be causing the spread in those communities, but more likely it's coming in from outside the community."
4982,"If we hit in that 80%+ range for vaccines, we'd really start to see that 1 in X number rise."
4983,"Cases would plummet and we'd be in a place where it might be 1 in every 20,000 **per week."
4984,"** Well, once we're at that point, it's hard to make the argument that it's just circulating around Salina, UT and the surrounding rural communities rather than coming in from somewhere else."

5079,This is why I get my flu shot there every year.
5080,"Something I'm going to do anyway, and Target gets me to buy more things."
5081,Mandatory vaccinations is a pretty typical response to a disease that is endemic in large populations.
5082,Sometimes trying yourself is the best way to investigate something.
5083,I can't remember the name of it but there is an amazing radiolab episode on a guy that's the creator of a lot of vaccines we are using nowadays.
5084,They make a good job explaining how vaccins are made.
5085,"Could be down to there just being a headline for now, there isn't a full article to publish yet."
5086,Health Canada is making the announcement right now.
5087,"&gt;a good chunk of those people may have already had Covid

Or, as I think is the case with some of my family members, they lived their lives pretty much normally during the pandemic so far (a few in particular come to mind who have been teleworking 100%, but also seem to have a social event every weekend with a different group of friends), and have been lucky enough as to not catch COVID-19 yet."
5088,So they feel untouchable and figure what's the big deal about getting vaccinated if they haven't caught it yet?
5089,"They feel they likely won't catch it at this point, so why get injected with something brand new?"
5090,1.
5091,"Vaccines aren't 100%
2."
5092,"We don't know yet if a vaccinated person who gets the virus can transmit it (Probably less likely, but not zero chance)
3."
5093,"Not everyone can be vaccinated, due to medical reasons"
5094,"Vaccines, historically, only require an efficacy of 50-60% (ball park), because this, in theory should lower the effective R0 value to less than 1, thus causing a deflationary infection rate."
5095,This early picture isn't suggesting this with a rate that is rising relative to pre-vaccination rates.
5096,Make sense?
5097,"I just think that viral pressures out of our control, such as season, population density, baseline population health, population age distribution etc, previous herd immunity.."
5098,"I think it's just realistic to settle with the idea, like influenza, that we'll all be dealing with a rotational viral impact for the near future."
5099,I’m not sure where the auto translate bot is.
5100,"It is much less likely that you will catch it and spread it, so it is much less likely that it will cause a mutation and lead to a variant."
5101,I’m keeping my vaccination card in pristine condition for the future museum display it will inhabit xD
5102,Yes!!

5104,Wow.

5108,They have dropped dramatically.
5109,The young demographics should be filling those up and they’re just not.
5110,Now maybe it bounces back over June which I would love but I’m not hopeful of that.

5116,"Thanks, this is what I'm looking for."
5117,No one calls it Pfizer-BioNtech or BioNtech-Pfizer.
5118,The vast majority just call it Pfizer which if you were to choose to use only 1 company name is the less logical choice as the creator company would be the fairer choice.
5119,"Something I've been wondering about:

I'm seeing announcements here and there that some sports teams in the United States are going to establish sections in their stadiums/arenas dedicated to vaccinated individuals, presumably leaving other sections for either only unvaccinated individuals, or whoever wants to sit there regardless."
5120,"Here's my question: the notion of herd immunity, and how individuals with immunity are the key to stopping the spread of a disease with a high transmission R value, suggests to me that what we ought to be doing to prevent spread in these situations is either not allow unvaccinated people in at all, or (more realistically) set up seating guidelines that distribute the seats for the unvaccinated among the seats for the vaccinated."
5121,"I mean, if the idea is to open up the stadium seating once we feel confident that spread of the disease can be minimized, doesn't it also follow that you should use the vaccinated attendees as a buffer between the unvaccinated attendees?"
5122,"Of course, in outdoor stadiums/arenas, there's going to be little COVID-19 transmission to begin with."
5123,"And even in indoor settings, the volume of air in a facility is so large that it'll take a while for COVID-19 aerosols to accumulate anyway."
5124,But why isolate and concentrate all the vaccinated people away from all the unvaccinated people?
5125,It doesn't seem to align with the idea that the goal is to reduce spread.
5126,We need a way to notify mods of inaccurate flairs.
5127,Damn.
5128,"Well, that will do it."
5129,"Hello,

Sorry, i am a bit dumb in this matter."

5205,why not?
5206,polio vaccine was tested on 1.6 million kids before they granted it approval.
5207,1% of people got the smallpox vaccine back in the day died from it.
5208,"over 200,000 kids got polio after a lab that wasn't following standard procedures on inactivating the virus gave it out, i think a few dozen kids died and a few hundred ended up with permanent outcomes - still both smallpox and polio are virtually gone."
5209,we've come a long way from where we've been.
5210,vaccines are still the most studied and largest sample studies are used in their approval - there is no medicine in the world more studied than them as a group.

5226,"I know that they just want to grab some money by convincing people public that regular jabs will be needed forever is an easy accusation, that some people here consider conspiracy theory."
5227,"But there is no real life evidence this will be needed, and even if immunity wears out at some point, we would need to still be in a major health crisis by then for another shot to be necessary."
5228,"Giving what we are seeing in the UK, Israel and the US, with very partial vaccinations, this doesn't sound very likely."
5229,"Unless you want to eradicate the virus, which, for less transmissible and easier detected viruses such as polio and smallpox, it took just a small matter of centuries (polio is technically not even eradicated yet)."
5230,Good luck.
5231,Lol 30 times.

5239,The big deal about not reaching Herd immunity is that Covid will stick around until immunity from the current vaccines wear off.
5240,Might be 1 year might be 10 years but it will come back.
5241,Also if we can only vaccinate 50% of our population up front than that means even less would take any required booster shots.
5242,[removed]
5243,"&gt;The only reason it wasn't was because of lockdown measures recommended in his paper

You will never be able to prove this, furthermore the actual deaths were well below the best case scenario prediction, and you have the case of his model being replicated by swedish researchers giving an outrageous and absurd number of deaths in that country that I don't even remember."

Many people are hesitant or scared to test."
5319,They only do it when they are sick enough to need hospitalization.
5320,So many of the patients are dead on the day of admission.
5321,Test results takes longer time to arrive in case of surge in cases in a perticular region.

5369,*
5370,Yep
5371,"Probably because Pfizer is a shorter, less complicated word, and so that's become an established order by now."
5372,Yeah you can take it off it’s just there to stop the blood coming out.
5373,Same in nyc.
5374,All of my neighbors are fully vaccinated and are still wearing masks outside.
5375,Ya very likely 1 million will die in the second wave.
5376,"Human lives value is less in a country fo 1.4 B
I suspect a million lives are annually lost to air pollutants due to to coal burning alone.this is hardly suprising."

5380,Yeah 6 days with first dose isn’t that much according to the data.
5381,Real immunity kicks in 14 days after second shot.
5382,It’s good that he’s having mild symptoms.
5383,Good luck.
5384,There is no luck in science.
5385,Just the hard work of the people behind it.
5386,"This is not a miracle, just what scientists are capable to do when provided proper funding and prioritized."
5387,I'm completely in the same boat.
5388,"But at the same time, I really want to open up and get back out there, so I can get out of the limbo of being nervous about going back but not being able to do anything about it."
5389,"Not really relevant to the article, but why is it mainly callrd Pfizer-BioNTech instead of BioNTech-Pfizer?"
5390,Start bribing people to get it.
5391,"If Krispy Kreme can do it, so can the fed."
5392,Not really.
5393,"It shows a lot about their character and personal beliefs, if they were willing to do the riskiest possible thing and not care about it afterwards."

5396,"Eh, more a Pixar/Disney thing here."
5397,Pfizer is the distributor.
5398,BioNTech the designer.
5399,"""Pfizer"" is just easier to say."
5400,You can't really equate India to US.
5401,Population here is younger.
5402,See CDC information on how much more dangerous Covid is to older people than younger ones.
5403,I would put the figures around 1 million.
5404,India for its flaws has still managed to vaccinate vulnerable groups on preference.
5405,And already all the major cities are under lockdown.
5406,[removed]
5407,A third booster would still have to be recommended by the CDC’s ACIP before approval.
5408,So there would have to be a medical benefit to it before it gets approved.
5409,They won’t just be able to say “get a shot a month for the rest of your life” if there wasn’t a solid reason for it.
5410,I do hope you know that 2 and a half (wouldn’t count Janssen fully as they still haven’t contributed any American made doses afaik) vaccines shouldn’t require the entire nation’s supply chain of raw materials to be reserved exclusively.
5411,"The U.S doesn’t even produce the majority of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Europe does that."
5412,Stop trying to make it as if the U.S will collapse if they simply share their materials.
5413,"Yah, thats why i use fake seat belts clips."
5414,I drive slow anyways.
5415,So annoying.
5416,"&gt;Although Australia has largely eradicated COVID-19, a man in his 50s with no known links to hotels used to quarantine people who have arrived from overseas tested positive on Tuesday, the state's health ministry said in a statement."
5417,"&gt;The unidentified man visited several spots in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, the state capital and Australia's biggest city, the ministry said."
5418,"&gt;Testing showed a higher viral load than typically seen in infected people, potentially increasing the chance that the man has spread the disease, the ministry said."
5419,He is considered to have been infectious since April 30.
5420,Is concerning for sure.

5422,There's also a highly contagious variant there in the (to my knowledge) most densely populated nation on Earth.

5427,Not sure what safety concerns there could be long term.
5428,It's like thinking a new firehose will suddenly spontaneously combust.
5429,"Like if you know how something works, you can get a sense for the likely problems that might occur."
5430,I think the issue is that people just don't know how vaccines work.

5433,Eh ?
5434,What are you on ?
5435,I am talking about futility of a National lockdown.
5436,"That being said,
 It is well known the government in the centre is "" strongman"" one."
5437,Will never apologise for anything.
5438,Infact during the last crisis their cabinet repeatedly met to discuss how to manage public perception.
5439,"They had great ideas like pushing favourable news anchors to promote their agenda, humiliate the opposition, army of trolls on social media to drag down debates etc etc."
5440,Australia here we have done  **0.85%** of our population.
5441,"Media is allowed to do their duty, all those efforts by UP government has been stricken off by tr courts."
5442,Thankfully indias new Chief Justice is much better than his predecessor.
5443,Also Justice Chandrachud is now in Supreme court.
5444,It is true they are undercounting deaths due to technicalities and incapability.
5445,Some states are also suppressing data.
5446,Telangana for example.
5447,While it is possible 10 million may die.
5448,"Some cities are seeing Covid peaks already, that plus demographics of younger populace will keep deaths lower."
5449,It's the vaccination that worries me most.
5450,150 m doses in 3 months is far too slow a rate for country like us.
5451,SII is making 70 m a month and BB just 10 m .
5452,At this rate we will never vaccinate in time .
5453,"That's a really long way of saying ""horrendous Government that doesn't want to admit this has gotten away from them and they have fucked up"""
5454,Of course I realize that.
5455,"My point is that I've been incredibly careful for over a year now, no travel, no gatherings indoors, avoiding restaurants and nonessential shopping, masks, etc."
5456,"If people still want to be reckless, not get vaccinated, mouth breathe everywhere, then thats on them."
5457,"Of course I don't wish death on anyone, but at a certain point people need to step up and take responsibility."
5458,Pool testing?
5459,Doubtful as everything is under reported.
5460,Is Brazil getting a bit better now?
5461,Now it is arrogant to do something like this.
5462,However the Nepalese government allowed it.
5463,They make a lot of money off everest tourists so the climbers are not the the only ones to blame on this.
5464,And if the Nepalese government took this seriously they would shut down everest immediately.
5465,But they won't because they want the money.
5466,Now also it takes a very long time to prepare for a everest summit.
5467,So these rich climbers probably pressured the government to open the mountain because of the time and effort they spent preparing for climbing everest.

5479,Colombia is next due to friction and riots against the Government.
5480,Brazil is the epicenter that no one talks about.
5481,"I think the main reasons that the UK had arguably an easier time than the US is that we don't have to deal with loads of state governments and that we already have universal single-payer healthcare, so a lot of the organisation is already there."

5483,I feel like my old self before the pandemic started.
5484,I can finally ENJOY things again.

5494,Please get it done!
5495,We here in Canada could really use some extra supply.
5496,The government decided to get everyone their first shot before giving out the second so my appointments are currently 4 months apart.
5497,But doesn't cutting down trees reduce the production of oxygen?
5498,I heard their Gov says they don't need oxygen tanks but rather should plant more trees.
5499,As a Canadian who can’t get a second dose for 4 months.
5500,This kills me inside
5501,Aren’t there enough dead bodies on the mountain?
5502,Unless teens pressure their parents to take them and get the shot with them.
5503,I teach in an elementary school and I can say that during our discussions with my 5th graders... they all want it.
5504,"They've seen their teachers get the shot and be fine, and they want to get back to a world without masks/desk shields."
5505,Not following safety measures which endangers others is creating a toxic work environment.
5506,This
5507,People still remove masks to eat and drink.
5508,"Depending on the ventilation in a building and working and being exposed for multiple hours, distancing is not effective."
5509,Also many work places don’t have the option of distanced working.
5510,Nepal neighbors India
5511,Not going to happen.
5512,The Gov
5513,"""Bangkok tour operator, Unithai Trip, has packages from 75,000 baht to 200,000 baht ($2,400 to $6,400) for trips to San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, with prices dependent on the time gap between doses."
5514,"""Johnson &amp; Johnson is one jab, but 90% of inquires want Pfizer,"" which needs about 20 days between the first and second doses, the agency's owner, Rachphol Yamsaeng, told Reuters."""
5515,"""The United States is not the only destination offered to Thais."
5516,"Another agency, Udachi, advertised a 23-day ""VACCation in Russia"" to receive the Sputnik V vaccine for up to 210,000 baht ($6,700)."""
5517,So Haram
5518,It is really sad that tourists are bringing the sickness to those remote areas.
5519,Why are people so freaking arrogant?
5520,My gf felt fine after the first shot.
5521,I was just a bit tired and light headaches.
5522,Well actually I didn’t slept well the night because I had a strange dream.
5523,Can’t really say that it’s the vaccines fault.

5538,A pandemic that was bound to happen any day.

5540,I've already been fully vaccinated but I work with a lot of people who aren't really anti vax but they claim that they're wanting to wait it out because they are unsure.
5541,But when I ask them if they would get a shot for another round of direct payments they all said yes...so clearly money is a good movtivator for those on the fence.

5571,It wouldn’t make sense for the number of doses per day to remain constant though.
5572,Of course they are going to slow down as more people are vaccinated.

5586,Japan has by far been the worst response to coronavirus of all developed countries.
5587,"They largely lucked out due to being an island nation and uniform mask compliance, but it is very clear that they really never intended to do anything about the virus."
5588,"They have a worse testing capacity than many 3rd world countries, largely blamed any spread on foreigners, falsely claimed that Japanese genetics were just inherently superior and immune to the virus, literally waged a nationwide stimulus campaign to encourage domestic travel, and have overall just pretended the problem doesn't exist."

5668,This is the third set of data that said Pfizer and AstraZeneca are about equally effective when used side by side in the real world.
5669,"(Previous: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-data-show-vaccines-reduce-severe-covid-19-in-older-adults) Does anyone know if the vaccine type is randomly assigned, or did different groups received one vaccine vs the other?"

5679,I want to just cry.
5680,Who would have thought we couldn't rely on a 2000 year old set of books to guide our way forward forever.
5681,Part of what problem?
5682,"Biotech developed the vaccine, Pfizer was the company that took care of the logistics: production, distribution, sales negotiations and so on."
5683,"Wow, that is literally third grade math."
5684,I can’t say our educational system failed us.
5685,We failed us.

5687,"Interestingly enough, OSHA just ruled (correctly) that if a company requires a vaccine, any adverse reactions are a workplace related issue."

This has caused some companies to complain and move the vaccine from required to recommended, which shows you where their priorities are."
5689,Vaccinating children when the majority of the world has no access to vaccines for vulnerable adults is yet another gross example of American hegemony.
5690,Right??
5691,"I hate when people say “it doesn’t affect kids.” Um, yes."
5692,It’s less likely they’ll have bad side effects but we don’t know what will happen down the line.

5735,"No, thank Katalin Karikó, the Hungarian-American scientist whose dedication, perseverance, and brilliance are chiefly responsible for the invention of mRNA vaccines."
5736,"If you have the means to climb Everest, you have the means to jump the vaccine queue."
5737,"Once vaccines opened beyond just health care workers, jumping the queue was trivially easy."
5738,"Not one single person who is vaccine 'hesitant' has a good, non-propaganda reason as to *why* they are hesitant."
5739,They are no better than 'true' anti-vaxxers.
5740,But at least the 'true' anti-vaxxers are honest about their bullshit.
5741,Another variant bites the dust.
5742,&gt;The US military goes with the envoy to support US personnel.
5743,well that's just not true.
5744,"from literally the first paragraph of the article:

&gt;US plan to send battlefield oxygen generators has also been abandoned over 'compatibility issues' as it would have meant US soldiers operating them."
5745,[removed]
5746,We are in the same boat!
5747,Stay strong.
5748,We don't know what the long term effects of COVID on children are.
5749,Has there been any history of previous vaccines not preventing transmission of the virus (excluding ineffective vaccines like the flu vaccine)?

5759,"&gt; when they had that huge tsunami in 05.

that same tsunami hit South India very hard."
5760,"and we received help, with the deepest of gratitude, from multiple nations."
5761,none of them sent their armed forces in.
5762,"I do appreciate your comment that only the US military has know-how of handling disaster scenarios, but I fins it hard to believe that, in a nation at the forefront of science and of disaster management, only the military can apply this knowledge."
5763,the core point is that the presence of the US military is a poisoned chalice.
5764,one cannot blame anyone for refusing any help that comes with this precondition.
5765,First with Vaccine Nationalism.
5766,Fueling paid media to downplay crises.

5787,Just mask till this thing is gone from public life
5788,Many other articles said so.
5789,This article (and especially the (translated) title) is misleading.
5790,..doesn't make sense to drag kids all over town to mass vax centers.
5791,they need to get it to ***pediatricians***.
5792,"&amp;#x200B;

for a LOT of ppl, their personal physician is the only person they trust.. not some random FEMA injector person or talking heads on TV."
5793,"&amp;#x200B;

doctors can help ""convert"" skeptics."
5794,I'm both appalled by your irrational desire to shit all over people's comments and impressed by your total commitment to it.
5795,You don’t need to quarantine after exposure if you are fully vaccinated unless you develop symptoms per latest CDC guidelines.
5796,Risk of COVID in age 5-9 is exceedingly small (likely even less than the flu).
5797,"&gt;Also, if those sections are better seats than the rest of the stadium, it may be an incentive for those on the fence to get a jab."
5798,Especially if there is a mobile vaccine clinic outside the stadium.
5799,That's actually a really good idea.
5800,I doubt that’s it.
5801,The US has abundant intel sources in India for events this large.
5802,More likely the decades long aversion to any US “footprint” in India is to blame.
5803,Especially given the openness to German military assistance.
5804,"Not sure I believe the ""no need to quarantine if she's vaccinated""."
5805,The point of vaccination is to reduce/eliminate the effects of the disease.
5806,Does that prevent her from spreading if she does catch it?
5807,Need to go look up how that works...
5808,All the information I've seen indicates its most likely going to happen in the next few days in the US.
5809,"The sad thing is that it's not like they can't - they are wealthy, they have an excellent health system, good infrastructure - they just refused to do so."
5810,"There's definitely a minimum timeframe, the FDA says it takes 6 months to go through their process even when they expedite it."
5811,"I've been looking weekly since January for anything that suggests they can shorten that timeframe, but haven't found anything yet."
5812,So I have to assume FDA approval on the first vaccine will happen Oct-Dec 2021.
5813,How would the US disaster relief turn into permanent?
5814,Explain?
5815,The Indian government would have to allowed and signed off on the US continual presence.
5816,"You said India has never sanctioned a US base on it's soil, so how would the US stay?"
5817,"India could tell the US a day or a week after landing, services no longer needed please leave, the US would be out of the country asap."
5818,All the bases and location the US has presence in are agreements they signed with the local government.
5819,If that does not get renewed or terminated they leave.
5820,It's happen many times before.
5821,That is ridiculous.
5822,"We know crowded, indoor, poorly ventilated areas are the least safe."
5823,"So, obviously...lock everyone inside!"
5824,judging by some of the shit plumbers deal with (pun intended) I bet covid is low on their list of fears with possibility of other nasty stuff.
5825,Same here

5827,Mediocre leaders can’t handle being lead themselves.
5828,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a_3wQHcm_Y
5829,It depends on the exact vaccine and variant make up of the country.
5830,Israel is doing fine right now.
5831,I'm glad your school system has been on top of things.
5832,May I ask what state/city you reside in?
5833,"I'm in the Kansas City metro in Missouri, and things have been alternating between sane and ridiculous here."
5834,"My 3 year old cannot wait to take her ""superhero shot"" to help fight Covid the ""bad guy germy-germ"" and help others stay healthy."
5835,"My 3 year old also asks for her mask when we go out in public - she doesn't wait for me to tell her to wear it, and when it falls under nose she picks it back up over her nose unprompted."
5836,"(My husband and I are akready vaccinated)

Children are getting the shit end of the stick on every side from this pandemic and not only that, they are our ace in the hole towards ending these restrictions (masks, social distancing etc)."
5837,It is beyond frustrating that anti-vaxx parents are so stupid and belligerent that they would endanger their children and the lives of others due to misinformation and conspiracy theories.
5838,I cannot wait to vaccinate my daughter so that we can all move on with our lives and she can be safe and protected and have a quality childhood.
5839,&gt;If people aren't getting it at this point they're either anti-vax or just plain lazy.
5840,I was able to walk into a DMV with no appointment and get my free voter ID on the spot.
5841,If people don't have one by now they either don't want/need one or are too lazy.

5847,thats fine and you're not being unreasonable at all - all i ask is that you keep an open mind in a year after seeing good data.
5848,my only point is that we are far and away much more careful about vaccines than we ever were in the past and its because of everything that you mentioned above.
5849,I think there is an error in the article.
5850,"Israel is 55% of total population , not 55% of adult population."
5851,There was a recent report that came out showing that the spike protein plays a role in disease injury as well by directly causing vascular damage.
5852,"This isn’t a concern with those who get the vaccine, but it does bring up this question:

Is the vascular damage caused by COVID-19 permanent?"
5853,"I'm thinking similarly, but I suppose it depends on the way our school district handles it."
5854,"I'd still prefer my kids wear a mask at school for now, but I'm not a fan of online schooling at the moment."
5855,I don’t have kids but have a close friend in my “bubble” is caring for others’ kids.
5856,So despite being fully vaxxed we aren’t yet going out together to do things we’d like such as indoor dining—it sucks.
5857,"You’re not alone, there are others out there who are trying to make decisions that keep kids safe."
5858,No side effects.
5859,"I was surprised, because I had some mild side effects for the first one."
5860,Now nothing.
5861,"Dude, you gotta get a life if you’re still showing off your L a full month later."
5862,"Also, showing off how you use your lights during the day when there’s perfectly good natural light just shows how dumb you’re being..."
5863,&gt;They recorded 500 cases yesterday.
5864,"That’s absolutely insane for a country their size

They didn't report any cases the previous two days though so that is really 3 days worth of cases."
5865,"That's not correct, [when AP looked into this claim a few months ago, it quickly found three factories in Bangladesh, South Africa, and Denmark that could rapidly start producing, but they couldn’t get permission](https://apnews.com/article/drug-companies-called-share-vaccine-info-22d92afbc3ea9ed519be007f8887bcf6)."

5875,"If they changed the title to ""high level of confidence"" it would be basically the same because they're reporting varying levels of confidence in different aspects of the vaccine."
5876,This doesn't seem like a good article overall.
5877,"My elementary kids have learned all about covid, vaccines, and past pandemics via youtube."
5878,They’re fascinated by it all.
5879,that's a good point.
5880,"if the situation were reversed, say."
5881,"and if China offered to help but with the precondition that their military needs to have a presence in your country, would this help be happily accepted?"
5882,or would there be apprehension on the motives of the demand for a military presence?
5883,(not using India as a counterexample in this reverse scenario because I doubt the US military fears any branch of the Indian armed forces.)
5884,Nope.
5885,"It uses an adenovirus to carry the mRNA into cells instead of nanolipids, but it's still an mRNA vaccine."
5886,I'm aware.
5887,That's why I said 2 weeks.
5888,Previous poster said only 2 weeks after second shot.
5889,"I mean, another pandemic could start between now and then or the area you are going to could have fires/floods/earthquakes."

5897,So yes lots of luck is involved and for EU to have 4 approved vaccines after one year is amazing.
5898,Did it say that?
5899,I missed it.

5905,Is there any way a regular person in a rich country can contribute to the global vaccination effort?
5906,Is there any way to donate money that would help?
5907,Or is it more of a political power thing and no amount of money will get more vaccines to poor countries sooner?
5908,Wat.
5909,Seychelles are almost entirely Christian...
5910,"Yeah, nobody defeated the pandemic alone."
5911,"We had excellent researchers from all over the world, be it Germany or the UK, we had Americans with experience in distribution, we had India who did an excellent job in manufacturing AstraZeneca, Israel who plunged in an tested the vaccines and many many contributors all around the world."
5912,"Yup, and decided that a global pandemic was an appropriate time to take (probably &gt;2) international flights all to live out a midlife crisis."
5913,You will feel better tomorrow!
5914,Same thing happened to me!
5915,Is there an international standard for how long COVID19 cases are considered active?
5916,"The US has been using 30 days, but it appears India is using about 8-10 days."

5974,What does that have to do with dumb wordplay lol
5975,Yes my kids are 8 and 6.
5976,They will be vaccinated hopefully for the start of school.
5977,"A classmate of my 6yo was hospitalized with covid so while I know it’s low risk, that was still scary."
5978,Stuff like this is going to be an impetus for some hesitators to finally get vaccinated.
5979,It may get &lt;just&gt; enough to get us to a really good place.
5980,As someone with major ADHD brain (never officially diagnosed but I am pretty damn sure I have it but ya know...just can't get myself to make an appointment cause I forget) I can understand not actually making a covid appt.
5981,I kept wanting to do it for a few weeks but saw how hard it was for people to find appointments and I work 2 jobs and school full time so by the time I would think about it again I was busy at work or with homework or headed to bed to wake up early and do it all over again the next day.
5982,I can understand people just not doing it if they are in a situation like mine but luckily my mom's work was offering a biweekly clinic for family members of her work so I get my second shot today and I'm done!
5983,"Every time I read Bolsonara's comments on covid, I think wow... the US used to have a president like that."

5991,"Even in the US, FEMA is assisted by the National Guard."
5992,"As for the Tsunami, the US military was the response unit."
5993,Operation Unified Assistance was the response.
5994,I get that.
5995,Best of luck.
5996,I agree 100%.
5997,Lately more and more I'll be walking through a quiet grocery store with a mask thinking of how ridiculous it's becoming.
5998,Now that I've had both vaccines I'm having a really hard time keeping up the theatrics.
5999,The reasoning given to us is to prevent highly unlikely hypothetical situations from maybe happening.
6000,"If she can’t deal with temporary side effects from a vaccination, she’s not going to handle it well should she get the actual virus symptoms."
6001,I had a plumber come in maskless when me and the kids were home.
6002,I mentioned wearing the mask and my husband has a kidney transplant.
6003,He went off and yelled about how it’s all fake.
6004,Never hiring him again.
6005,He worked for himself and unfortunately is one of the best plumbers in the area for old houses like mine.

6009,People are paying a monthly subscription to get USA Today?
6010,?
6011,why didn't they do it this time?
6012,"Fair point, whataboutism isn’t fair."
6013,But it’s also not fair to further modify vulture journalists by their political stance.
6014,"If the point is accurate, it just serves to undercut the point by making it look like a propaganda hit piece."
6015,The political leaning of the journalists is entirely beside the point.
6016,"If they’re exploitative, their exploitative."
6017,Their political lean doesn’t matter.
6018,Du verstehst es einfach nicht

6020,Realistically?
6021,"Brazil I am very much aware of, they have the technology to produce inactivated virus vaccines."

6036,"While the current variant may not be as much of a concern, there is still the potential for more dangerous variants to appear in regions where community spread is rampant and uncontrollable."
6037,"To borrow a common analogy to illustrate this, each of the recent variants making headlines represents the SARS-CoV-2 virus winning the genetic lottery."

6074,"NY:

Broadway back on September 14th at 100% capacity."
6075,"Yankees Stadium/Citi Field will be full capacity ""for fully vaccinated people"" and for unvaccianted the capacity will be 33%.....I have nfc what this means?"
6076,Maybe they are spliting the stadiums up in vaccinated areas and unvaxxed areas.
6077,"Also worth noting the Blue Jays are playing in Buffalo in June, but he didnt mention that."
6078,Hopefully the same rules will apply there.
6079,"Regardless of how you feel about ""vaccine passports"", its nice to see the messaging turning too: ""vaccinated people can go back to normal"" instead of ""still social distance and avoid people!!"""
6080,Also looks like they are giving away free mets/yankees tickets to people who go get a vaccine at a game.
6081,Smart
6082,Let's not reduce it to whataboutery.
6083,This isn’t true for the UK.

6085,You mean that things that change the racist constitution?
6086,Those amendments?
6087,It's almost like I didn't criticize amendments to the constitution.
6088,"Aside from influenza not being the norovirus, how do you measure the difference beyond just saying ""more""."
6089,Can you quantify the difference?
6090,Just saw it approved by Health Canada today.
6091,So I know where I saw it.
6092,The study was presented by Dr John Campbell in his video blog series.
6093,"But he posts vids daily, and I can't easily pin-point the proper vid...sorry."
6094,However I do recall it would not have exactly applied to you at this point.
6095,The efficacy (perhaps efficiency?)
6096,of one Pfizer dose became significant about week 3 and continued to improve in subsequent weeks.
6097,Beyond 28 days the increase plateaued and the .91 result was the maximum value achieved.
6098,So my original point was not that we eliminate the second dose...but rather delay it as long as functionally permissible in order to get more first shots in place earlier.
6099,Which is pretty much the obviously successful UK model.
6100,I don't think anyone has gotten more for less.
6101,Has it been like that for long?
6102,Same arm.
6103,I always get vaccines in my non dominant arm!

6116,"Well Pfizer has the ability to develop mRNA vaccines and has announced, in the future they will go it alone."

6118,"Well, they already are?"
6119,They're not saying that everything is being put on hold to vaccinate a 4-year cohort of the population; especially since they have a vanishingly small chance of getting severely ill.
6120,That's a good extension of the conversation.
6121,"I'm definitely not against (or even hesitant) about vaccines in general, and with our kid we haven't been resistant to the vaccine schedule recommended for her by her pediatrician at all."
6122,"""Better living through chemistry!"""
6123,"""Give my immune system all the super powers you want to give it, pal."""
6124,But yeah I think you could say that I want to be convinced that the COVID-19 vaccines do not have effects that are unique to children that may not have shown up in adults.
6125,"**I do not doubt** that the trials will show the vaccine is safe in children, but I am also not taking it for granted that it will go well."
6126,"Let's act like I'm from Missouri, and ""show me""."
6127,"That's how I approached the vaccine for adults, and the data I have seen about the trials in adults easily convinced me that it was worth getting."
6128,"The trial data showed little-to-no adverse reactions, and even then: the bulk of the adverse reactions were chalked up to allergies to the ingredients."
6129,"Non-allergy related adverse reactions were triflingly rare, and the short lived side effects most people got were well within my bounds of acceptability for myself."
6130,Add on to that the fact that they are *remarkably* effective at preventing COVID-19 cases at all--not to mention severe cases--and it's a pretty easy choice to get it.
6131,"Especially for somebody like me, who cannot telework and tends to run all the errands for my household: if I have to be out in public, I want to be immunized."
6132,"The trials showed that there weren't really any downsides to getting it, so get me that immunity!"
6133,"But there's something about me I didn't mention before, and it is very relevant to how I'm not immediately gun-ho about giving the vaccine to my child right now:  I'm almost never an early adopter or snap decision maker."
6134,New flagship smart phone model comes out?
6135,I'll give it a little while before I buy it--let them work out the kinks first while the price drops.
6136,I'm in the market for a new car?
6137,I'll get one that hasn't been redesigned for a few years so I avoid the first year issues that so many new and redesigned cars have.
6138,I researched the process of buying and assembling components to build my own computer for a YEAR before I finally did it.
6139,I spent an entire winter reading up on how to successfully start a garden before I put shovel to sod and got started.
6140,I think that tendency of mine to wait before I get in line for something is playing into effect here with the COVID-19 vaccine.
6141,"In my state, I was not immediately eligible to get it."
6142,The eligibility boundaries weren't expanded to a point where I was included until we were a few months along with the vaccination effort.
6143,"By the time I got it, over 5 million doses had been given out in my state *alone*, let alone nationally or worldwide."
6144,"I figured by then that if there weren't reports of unexpected outcomes coming up, they wouldn't hit me, either."
6145,And so it follows that it'll take a few months of seeing how it goes for the general public outside of the trials before I'll feel comfortable having my child get the vaccine when her age group becomes eligible for it.
6146,She's not even a year and a half old yet--let alone 2 years old.
6147,"So I am extra cautious about how her immune system at that young age may behave differently with this vaccine than the immune system of an older child, let alone an adult, may behave with it."
6148,I am SURE that the trial data will alleviate my concerns.
6149,"But I'm not an automatic ""yes"" to her getting the vaccine until I see that data and give the rest of the public a chance to prove that data, first."
6150,"It's a bit selfish to not want to be the tip of the spear, sure, but a little more patience for that peace of mind is worth it to me."
6151,I'm still waiting for them to bring back samples!
6152,"That's a cool idea, but some of those tickets are expensive, and from a fan point of view I'm not sure it works."
6153,Obviously the teams won't let you immediately sit in the vaccinated sections.
6154,So you're saying I need to go back to another game to even reap the benefits?
6155,"Better for baseball, for sure, but doing that for the NFL or NBA playoffs would probably be too pricey for your average person to bother."
6156,If you go back and read Clay’s tweets and posts from a year ago they’re absolutely hilarious.
6157,He was literally wrong about everything.
6158,He’s a very disingenuous person too; he just dismissed all criticism by saying “coronabros!”.
6159,These authorizations need to be traceable.
6160,They need to be held accountable as well.
6161,Why they gave authorization needs to be documented and timestamped.
6162,"This guy, possibly with help from the clinic, forged fake documents."

6166,If you're trying to back your claim up that COVID is less severe than influenza for people in their 30s... you're doing it wrong.
6167,"The 2017-2018 influenza (worst outbreak since 2009) killed 2,803 American people aged 18-49, per the CDC."
6168,"COVID19 has killed 24,693 American people aged 18-49, per the CDC."
6169,That's makes COVID-19 nine times more deadly than the worst flu outbreak since 2009.

6178,What is the reason they are not doing that and instead waiting for US IP licenses?
6179,"&gt; Plus, the vaccine is only 90% effective so there is some scientific backup to justify the masks too."

6348,"You can tell them the vaccines have completed the regular testing process (phase 1-3 trials including trials in humans) that they’ve been fda reviewed for emergency use and will have full approval within a few weeks but many countries have fully approved already (Canada) Pfizer vaccine has actually been approved in 85 countries world wide https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/

When the fda reviewed for emergency use they reviewed the safety and efficacy info and if they are curious about what that entails there’s info here -https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines

You can assure them that mRNA technology is not gene editing/ DNA editing technology - it just delivers the recipe for the antibodies and then is cleared by our system - there’s info here and a helpful quote https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

“Facts about COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines
They cannot give someone COVID-19."
6349,mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19.
6350,They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.
6351,"mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept."
6352,"The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions.”

Finally you can advise them there are serious long term effects being reported in covid patients even with no symptoms, that COVID itself is seeming more vascular in nature and in addition to all the normal things we’ve heard, can cause blood clots, strokes, aneurysms and brain damage."
6353,That in the balance of the risks known to covid vs the risks known of the vaccines it’s like being asked if you want to take your chances being hit by a car or getting punched in the arm.
6354,Finally we can say how vaccination is a community effort that helps protects individuals as well as others in society who may not be able to get the vaccine (young children immuno compromised) and that asking the public to do things for the greater safety is like the entire governing idea of road safety.

6539,"tl;dr: The spike protein is only created in small quantities, in muscle tissue not vascular tissue, and usually doesn't get ejected from cells at all but just expressed on the surface."
6540,And the 4 US vaccines are using a prefusion-locked form of spike that should not bind to cells at all.
6541,"Just one of the many complexities: there has been huge work in recent years on adjuvants, part of the “inactive” parts of the vaccines that turns out to have enormous impacts on efficacy."
6542,This work has often been performed at great expense by companies and both the creation and sourcing of the adjuvants are in some cases proprietary.
6543,I have heard some scientists say that there really is no way to manufacture them more quickly at this point: they depend on various raw materials that are already maxed out (I believe the one I heard about is derived from a specific kind of tree bark).
6544,And these adjuvants have uses far beyond COVID.
6545,Without them the vaccines don’t work.
6546,The research that developed them was not COVID specific.
6547,What is the point of telling companies they now must give this work away for free?
6548,What does this do the large amount of ongoing work on new adjuvants &amp; similar tech?

6584,It sends a signal that intellectual property will get thrown out the window as soon as politicians find it inconvenient - particularly if it's a tear-jerk-y case involving a developing country.
6585,"So there will be *less* of an incentive for biotech companies to develop solutions for problems that plague the developing world, because they know that if they actually do develop a solution there's a chance it will be given away for free and they'll be stuck with the bill."
6586,It also hurts biotech companies in the countries in question.
6587,"If you're running a biotech company in South Africa or India and you see your own government pushing to override IP protection for a foreign company, you have to know that it's just a short hop to overriding the IP of domestic companies."
6588,Anyone looking to get biotech up and running is going to move to the U.S. or the EU so they know they'll get at least some protection for their intellectual property.
6589,"If the pharmaceutical companies were literally hoarding the IP, refusing anyone to use it, then there would be an argument for breaking the IP."
6590,But they aren't.
6591,They just want to get paid for developing it.
6592,And so that's the simple solution to all of this: pay for the it.
6593,"If the U.S. believes India or South Africa's line about being so desperately impoverished that they can't afford to pay for vaccinations for their people (say, any massively expensive stadiums built in those countries with public funds?"
6594,"just wondering), then the U.S. government can pay for it as a gift."
6595,But breaking up the intellectual property system just to save a bit of cash is a very bad precedent.
6596,"It's funny that you cite HIV because just about every public health expert agrees that strong IP and patent enforcement in the 90s made things much, much worse, both in terms of death and total number of infections."
6597,It was only after drug companies were forced through various state-backed initiatives and and bottom-up protest movements to allow for the manufacture of generic and biosimilar treatments that we started to get a handle on things.

6607,"I think that actually supports the argument that if J&amp;J or AstraZenecca can make mistakes, adding to the complexity of outsourcing the production can be problematic."
6608,But i do also understand that facilities that can produce vaccines do exist that are being unused and there’s a profit and capitalistic motivation for the closed ecosystem of IP ownership right now that is costing us time against a constantly mutating threat.
6609,"I find these super interesting and helpful, particularly the distribution of the unvaccinated across age groups."
6610,"To me, it tells a different story (or maybe more complicated story) than the state rates, which encourage people to kind of throw up their hands and say ""well you can't help people who [for political reasons] don't want to get vaccinated!"""
6611,"But it certainly appears that the elderly population is getting vaccinated at high rates across the country (because they make up a tiny percentage of the unvaccinated), and there's a lot of room for improving vaccination rates by focusing on the 18-29 age group and by expanding vaccine approval to younger ages."
6612,"I think it's way too much for a table in a reddit comment but I'd be interested to know whether these age-based patterns look similar in low-vaccine-rate states (e.g., southeast United States) versus high-vaccine-rate states (e.g., the Northeast)."
6613,"If the 18-29 year old group makes up a high proportion of unvaxxed in most states, it suggests that it may be not be political persuasion that is the barrier, but rather something that may be surmountable - e.g., need to make it easier or more convenient to get vaxxed or incentivize it for a group that perceives themselves at very low risk for the disease."
6614,"No, it won't."
6615,Vaccinations are taking care of this.
6616,No need to worry.
6617,"Yeah you are just misunderstanding what people mean when they say ""supply issue""."
6618,"Low supply can mean there are not enough houses built, but it can also mean not enough houses for sale."
6619,Think of diamond prices for example.
6620,"The demand is high because there is low supply of diamonds, but that doesn't mean there are not enough diamonds since we know there are companies out there hoarding diamonds to keep supply low and maintain high prices."
6621,You are just misunderstanding the difference between the word supply and the term supply in a market sense.
6622,&gt;Which is why the meme that there's a shortage of houses is incorrect.
6623,"There are a shortage of houses on the market, yes."
6624,There is not a shortage of houses that exist.
6625,It's not the same thing.
6626,"&gt;if they're not incentivized to use them as houses for housing, they aren't."
6627,"Yeah this is why one proposed solution to the supply issue is a tax on empty houses, to incentivize renting or selling."
6628,Up to now licensing production of vaccines does not seem to be the problem at all.
6629,"It seems like sourcing personnel, equipment, materials and key ingredients is a much larger issue."
6630,Setting up vaccine lines takes months so immediately I think we are going to see very little effect by this waiver.
6631,"With that being said, it is an important message to give that fighting covid is more important than financial gains, and all options needs to be on the table."
6632,&gt; CDC seems out of touch with reality.
6633,I know this not really related.
6634,"But the phasing made me think of when CDC said [All women of childbearing age should avoid alcohol unless using birth control](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/02/cdc-urges-young-women-avoid-all-alcohol-unless-theyre-using-contraception/79701890/)  

It was just unrealistic and frankly way too extreme and controlling (well, I guess more restrictive than controlling, since there was no attempt or goal for enforcement that I know)."
6635,"And creepy in a way - women are now to live their lives according to what's healthiest for children they could potentially/theoretically conceive, but have no intention of doing conceiving."
6636,"And while I am completely in favor of birth control being available, the most common methods for women do involve hormones that have potential side effects."

6737,I don't think there have been any studies that granular but the CDC recommends it.
6738,Most trials allowed for pain or fever reducers after the shot and some allowed for prophylactic paracetamol before vaccination.

6826,"Incidentally, the situation is much the same for the internet, but for some reason it's the pharmaceutical companies that are bad people for free riding off of government research, while the tech companies that have been free riding off of government research for just as long are somehow just fine doing the exact same thing."

6878,It’s not like adenovirus is a simple process either.
6879,I have a hard time believing that countries like India or China for example couldn’t develop mRNA vaccines with cooperation from Pfizer and their subcontractors.
6880,The problem is that will never happen without public or government pressure.
6881,The reason they can’t develop a lot of this stuff is because the process information isn’t available.
6882,They could very likely develop their own systems with the aid of these companies but we live in a fucked up system where the profits of a couple pharma companies is more important than the health of the world.

6953,That would not be nearly as successful as you might think.
6954,What would happen is the small mom-and-pop landlords would go under and their buildings would be repossessed by the bank and/or auctioned off for unpaid property taxes.
6955,These buildings would be bought on the cheap by deep-pocketed hedge fund investors who are waiting for such an opportunity.

6959,Gotcha!
6960,Not sure if this helps you any but this has been my experience of people’s opinions on the vacc.
6961,Most people I know in my age range (mid thirties) were basically like we will get it when our local pharmacy has it.
6962,As soon as that happened we all got our shots.
6963,I know more people vaccinated now than not in my age group and that only flip flopped in the last two weeks.
6964,I noticed since the vaccine has been available folks much older than me 55+ were the ones that would drive out of their way to wait in lines at clinics just like the ones you work for.
6965,I have yet to run into anybody fully 100% against getting the vaccine in my social group.
6966,"Except maybe my niece who is afraid of needles lol 

Good luck to you and thanks for helping get the vaccines rolled out!"
6967,Brazil was recently threatening to introduce a law allowing Brazilian companies to ignore intellectual property rules wrt vaccines.
6968,This might be a case of the US government and pharma companies accepting the inevitable.
6969,i think it depends on vaccination rates in your county.
6970,"In certain ""alternate"" persuasion regions the majority of residents will be opting out, so case numbers will stay at a plateau until covid becomes endemic and natural immunity takes hold (like the flu strains)."
6971,The reality is that hospitals and health clinics in those areas will have to plan for mini-surges in the next couple years until covid burns itself out like SARS and MERS did.
6972,"I hope you'll forgive my cynicism, but I think at no point did anyone sit down and do a serious cost-benefit analysis on anything over the last year."
6973,What!?
6974,For reference pubs that didn't serve food haven't been open in Dublin since the pandemic began.
6975,I do sometimes wonder whether some Americans actually know what a lockdown looks like.
6976,I work in bio so yes I will jump to their defense.
6977,Research is already hard enough you don’t need the added possibility of the government taking away your product when you finally make a breakthrough.
6978,Subsidize it if you want to make it available for others but don’t remove intellectual rights that is the most unmotivating thing in the world
6979,"Haha, I’m one of them!"
6980,"(Didn’t come just for the vaccine, but still)"
6981,We will absolutely repeat these mistakes all while people claim the real reason we can’t ramp up production is purely a supplies issue or incompetence of foreign countries.
6982,We need western companies to work with other countries to help bring new manufacturing facilities online and help with growing pains.
6983,But that seems very unlikely given how hard they fought to even stop this first step of expanding vaccine production.
6984,And people in this subreddit will blindly repeat that the main issue is supply logistics.
6985,But the thing is opening up all of these processes will lead to new developments and new supply chains that wouldn’t have previously existed.
6986,We’ve seen this at every level of production.
6987,Not enough dry ice so Pfizer starts producing them themselves.
6988,The more manufacturing of vaccines themselves the more inventive solutions and sourcing of supplies we’ll see.
6989,Not saying I don't believe you but is there an official source for your claim?
6990,I thought many visas had to get an NIE and that many people wouldn't be able to fly to the USA if they had spent the last 14 days in Europe/UK/Brazil/India etc.
6991,A covid test isn't required if you're flying domestically.

7000,"In most cases, whether it's pain medications or a vaccine, there's enough competition between different products that you aren't locked into only one and they can't charge absurd prices."
7001,"But there seems to be this expectation out there that anybody connected to healthcare should be willing to do the work for free out of the kindness of their hearts, when that doesn't extend to anyone else."

7027,"Just add up production from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J and the Chinese producers and you will get to a number 10-15B."

7029,"I’d love to be mistaken though, the world need the vaccine now."

7034,"A vaccine proof variant doesn't just happen overnight, it would probably take years for a mutation to turn the efficacy rate from 95 to 0 and by then both Pfizer and Moderna would have already made boosters"

7037,I wonder what impact Republican versus Democrat vaccination rates will have on the midterms.

7040,I switched arms.
7041,I did so mainly because I was initially so sore after the first that I was hesitant to have a needle stuck in there.
7042,Didn’t help though.
7043,The second one for whatever reason hurt a lot more during the injection.
7044,I joke that I did it so the microchips can’t sync up.
7045,Only downside would that Israel does have near the same level of race-based data that the FDA would need.
7046,Not normal until indoor masking gone.
7047,And yes I know that will probably be dead last.
7048,But I suppose the 'relatively normal' caveat could be that a lot of businesses could still have restrictions on their own volition as well as people still choosing to wear masks and being hesitant.
7049,And that a number of clubs/bars from 2019 that closed won't be able to reopen due to financial issues :(

7066,The point I'm making is that it's ridiculous to look back at things that were said when barely anything was known about the virus and then gloat about which parts turned out to be wrong.
7067,Especially when the examples are cherry picked in order to advance a highly partisan narrative.
7068,Do you think it being available at CVS and Walgreens now might impact those numbers?
7069,"Exactly, the half who think it is important to be vaccinated already have the vaccine, the people who don't are the ones who are going to be throwing a massive fit if their work (or anyone) tries to push them to get it."
7070,Maybe more vaccines in arms.
7071,Also it’s good to give them plenty of notice so shows can start rehearsals and hiring staff back.
7072,The fact is if he said they can open tomorrow it would take time to get thins back up and running.
7073,Make it a challenge were more videos get unlocked when a certain percentage of vaccinations is reached.

7184,"Broadway can open starting May 19, when capacity restrictions are lifted but with social distancing requirements."
7185,Shows can open at *full capacity* in September.
7186,I think the poster is asking a slightly different question though.
7187,"They are asking whether the vaccine efficacy is binary (basically: is it 100% efficacious for 82% of the people, people, 0% for the remaining 18%), or if the efficacy is 82% for everyone who gets that vaccine."
7188,I think the answer is probably somewhere in the middle.
7189,The vaccine will be more efficacious for some people and less so for others (depending on e.g.
7190,age or weak immune system).
7191,"If the trials are set up correctly, the trial population should be somewhat representative of the general population."

7327,J&amp;J can help a bit I would think.
7328,The news keeps mention metrics for 1 dose vs both doses but how are they counting those who’ve taken the J&amp;J vaccine?
7329,Also a pet peeve is mentioning raw numbers rather than percentages.
7330,X% partly vaccinated and Y% fully vaccinated is much cleaner than X million people.
7331,"Also, it’s easier to account for J&amp;J as part of Y%."

7340,They need to incentivize people into getting the vaccine for those who are on the fence.

7342,"Sure sure, but what's in it *for me*?"
7343,"Sadly the second-largest political party in the United States is currently based on a platform of misinformation, the membership of which being largely defined by its susceptibility to misinformation."
7344,They should just issue those dart rifles they use to tranquilize zoo animals and allow us to hunt the unvaccinated for sport!

7346,No?

7360,"&gt; All it says is that ""some variants might cause illness in some people after they are fully vaccinated"", which we already know."
7361,"In fact, the mRNA vaccines are 95% effective -- which means that there is still a (small) chance that you get a symptomatic infection after being fully vaccinated on the wild type virus too."
7362,"In biology, nothing is ever 100%."
7363,"Small pox is only required if you are deployed to the Middle East or Korea, most military members  don’t get it"
7364,[removed]
7365,The free market’s insurance premiums crushing idiots who don’t get vaccinated would be wonderful
7366,And all this conspiracy stuff isn’t helping.
7367,About one third of the population still think Covid-19 never existed.
7368,With so many with their heads in the sand it may be a challenge to reach that “herd immunity.” I still don’t know what “herd immunity” is and does it really exist.
7369,"By the way, I’ve already had my Maderna shot, but then again I do not reside in the states any longer."
7370,I never got a flu shot as a kid and was never really sick with it.
7371,"I only got it last year because of Covid, but I doubt I’ll get it this year."
7372,I don’t understand why it’s been so difficult to come to the conclusion that offering this compromise is so so valuable.
7373,Yea like I said I'm taking it with a grain of salt right now because of how many other factors are in play and that we would need it to stay considerably low for a sustained period of time before we start to declare things over.
7374,"But even taking that into account, even getting it down to .5 one week after we got it down below .8 for the first time in months (with a good amount of that time spent above 1.0) is pretty damn good and a sign of good to come."
7375,"Not over, people have to keep getting their shots and take precautions until then but as long as we keep dropping and keep it below .5 (Which even if we take the super conservative estimate you put, should happen pretty damn soon) we should be  breathing easy in a couple weeks."
7376,If it was a sudden drop from .8 to .27 I'd be pretty wary about it but the number has dropped at pretty consistent intervals each day so that has to be a sign that things are going the way they  should for the most part.
7377,&gt;There's plenty of valid reasons for people being unsure.
7378,"Yet since it became almost like a religion that you can't ask questions about the  vaccine  and mass censorship on social media sites 

A friend of mine had concerns."
7379,She had allergic reactions to other vaccines in the past.
7380,You know what she did?
7381,**She asked her doctor.
7382,"**

**She didn't ask social media, because only idiots do that."
7383,"**  She got her first jab last week, with no complications."
7384,That’s basically Lori Lightfoot in Chicago as well.
7385,yes but he has a team of smart people with a lot of resources for coming up with a reasonable prediction and he absolutely wouldn't make this a goal if he didn't think there was an overwhelmingly likely chance of success if his past goals are any indication.
7386,"We didn't soar passed 100 vaccines in 100 days because Biden worked a miracle, we did it because the goal was incredibly likely to begin with and intentionally a low bar."
7387,I don't think this bar is as low but I don't think Biden turned into a huge risk taker overnight for no reason.
7388,"That’s a good point but I would say I think the vaccine hesitancy / refusal is actually based on not perceiving covid as a legitimate threat to themselves or the community, or rather that they are in fact superior in health and a vaccine is unnecessary."
7389,That’s just my thoughts

7391,"vaccination rate by age chart: [static image](https://www.bytemuse.com/2021_05_04.png), [live](https://www.bytemuse.com/post/us-covid-vaccination-by-age/)

* **44.4% (148 million) have received one or more doses**
* **Vaccination rate for 40-49 group is now over 50% for 1 or more doses**"
7392,My mom apparently lost her voice after Moderna dose 1?
7393,She said it was only after her shot and it’s been 3 hours without improvement.
7394,"I couldn’t find anything about it online so I assumed it was anxiety, but I would’ve thought that anxiety would have subsided by now"
7395,I don’t think I’d go back for a third shot.
7396,I did J&amp;J because I know myself well enough that I’d never go back for a second shot.
7397,...or people with autoimmune diseases (some of whom already had Covid.)
7398,There actually is some published research (and plenty of anecdotal reports) now of certain conditions having “flair-ups” from the vaccine.
7399,"So, yeah, while Reddit seems always divided into “every thing is black and white...you are an anti-vax moron or you get 3 flu shots a year”..."
7400,"In reality, if you’re under 50, have had Covid, AND have an autoimmune disease that affects your kidneys, liver, other organ systems...and there have been reports of people having flair-ups after their shot...I can understand the hesitation, I really can."
7401,"That’s a really specific example, but there’s people like that."
7402,Perfect.
7403,Thanks.
7404,There is a large contingency of people willing to get the vaccine but won't unless there is a mild inconvenience to them.
7405,Something like needing it for travel or concerts or movies.
7406,Stuff like that.
7407,We should make it as hard as possible for them to participate in the free market because if we don't get heard immunity this thing will just keep going and going.
7408,Well shit.
7409,"Ding ding ding, we have a winner."
7410,"Those people don't care, and they'll shape the data to fit their bullshit beliefs."

7413,Good thing you’re not the president
7414,You have a reading comprehension problem.
7415,Maybe.
7416,A friend of mine had horrible flu-like symptoms around then in Seattle.
7417,Her doc tested for flu and that was negative.
7418,"The first statement suggests something like ""the vaccines are totally ineffective against certain strains"", or at the very least, something like ""the vaccines are severely compromised when dealing with certain strains""."
7419,"This was, at least, my takeaway from the first statement."
7420,The second statement suggests nothing of the sort.
7421,"All it says is that ""some variants might cause illness in some people after they are fully vaccinated"", which we already know."
7422,The vaccines were never supposed to be literally 100% effective against any and all COVID-19 related illness.
7423,"But the vaccines are nonetheless very, very, very highly effective against COVID-19."
7424,Not true for everyone.

7431,Wasn’t Dan Crenshaw supposed to be eating some words by now?
7432,Meanwhile Philly Mayor Kenney announced today that he won't be going along with the rest of the state.
7433,"His update today was basically ""hopefully by September, if we can keep cases down, you know we might be able to return to some kind of normalcy, but all we can do is hope and pray."""
7434,It's such a massively anti-science outlook.
7435,"I have a ""live and let live"" mentality towards life."
7436,The problem in the context of Covid is that the (rather irrational) fear some people have about being maskless outside in non-crowded areas is then imposed on the rest of us in the form of outdoor mask mandates.
7437,Luckily most of those are being lifted now.
7438,"I do think as a country we're going to face a big problem with what some people are dubbing ""covid anxiety""."
7439,"And I mean, if there are some people who just cannot cope even after being fully vaccinated, it's completely within their right to stay in lockdown if they want."
7440,"Again, the problem is that oftentimes you'll find those types of people want everyone else to lockdown too."
7441,I'm hoping that people will start to realize how amazingly effective these vaccines are and get back to normal life.
7442,It took me 5 minutes to find both Moderna and J&amp;J availability tomorrow in Boston at dozens of pharmacy locations.
7443,If you don't have it you're not trying.
7444,Peer pressure will push a lot forward too
7445,There shouldn’t be any such thing as health insurance.
7446,I was to understand the 95% efficacy refers to not developing symptoms related to COVID instead of meaning that 95% of people won’t contract COVID.
7447,Hopefully they also do a better job of letting people know the vaccine is FREE.
7448,I see them mentioning it enough in regional and National campaigns.
7449,90% I think.
7450,Good enough!

7452,"If you had not listed your state, I would have thought we had the same hairdresser."
7453,"Mine stated she had clients who died after vaccinating and after questioning her the people turned into ""friends of clients."""
7454,She did give me one name and when I googled it was a guy who got covid after being fully vaccinated.
7455,"However, he was in treatment for leukemia and the vaccine did not give him many antibodies."
7456,For my second dose this morning.
7457,"I am a happy, but sore camper today."
7458,"Yeah sure, tell that to Michigan where that's now the main age group making up the fatalities."
7459,Since you're NOT high risk that's all the more reason for you to BE proactive.
7460,I hate that dumb mentality; people like you and your laziness is what kills immunocompromised people like me that can no longer get the vaccine because we did and had extreme side effects.
7461,I believe it’s 80% after two weeks.
7462,Negligible in that first week.
7463,Operation Warp Speed is not just Trump.
7464,It’s hundreds of thousands of people around the world that came together to conquer what seemed to be an insurmountable task and succeeded.
7465,Trump is one person in that group .

7473,I don't know about that.
7474,I am 100% on the vaccine train and get my second Moderna shot tomorrow but that pause did concern me and had me googling if Moderna had similar blood clotting issues because I had a pretty intense first shot sickness leaving both my arms to fall asleep very easily  (it went away after a week though)
7475,"Yes, and it happened with already certified vaccines."
7476,So what's your point?
7477,"LOL

I guess you are suggesting the whole world to not use vaccines anymore?"
7478,"It's funny when you put it that way, but ""Americans"" is a large, diverse group."
7479,"I certainly don't line up for Black Friday, despite being an American."
7480,Free ice cream 🍦 if you get a shot.
7481,Häagen-dazs.
7482,Lol fucking crazy af
7483,MA
7484,Yeah I much prefer this goal over the 100 million shots in my first 100 days one when we had already exceeded 1 million shots per day when Biden took office.
7485,Consensus does not indicate truth.
7486,Usually a brave individual comes along and changes the minds of the many.
7487,Though they usually are deemed heretical and burned at the proverbial stake for questioning the experts authority.
7488,the only way to get that to happen is to force health insurance to require it to still be covered.
7489,Vaccination rates across the board no matter the vaccine Pfizer or Moderna tanked after April 13th.

7493,Looks like they got 2 billion up front for the first 100 million doses.
7494,Drop in the bucket really
7495,Thank god I don’t live in CA
7496,How would you enforce it?
7497,I promise that fake vaccinated cards already exist.
7498,I’m from Illinois and have been disappointed with our Governor in detailing the next steps.
7499,"We are planning on moving to the bridge phase next week, which is the in-between phase of a full reopening but has no plans to remove mask mandate until the CDC drops their guidance on it."
7500,"I am 100% for mask mandates but not setting a goal like Governor Wolf has for PA, is discouraging to getting back to fully normal and having clear benchmarks to hit, so we can move back to normal."
7501,Your interpretation of science.
7502,"To the actual scientists involved, they recognized the clots it was causing weren't normal clots and they needed time to update various hospitals on how to treat them the correct way, as treating them like normal clots actually made it more dangerous."
7503,Lets keep hitting those goals!
7504,"Been a week since my first Pfizer shot, out of curiosity do we know how much protection a person has after a week from their first shot?"
7505,Getting my second one in a couple weeks and just wondering what kinds of things I can do safely (masked still of course)
7506,A lot of college students postponed in case their second shot aligned with exams
7507,I have a small if you send me the data I can make a short shareable video dm me if you're interested
7508,I'd do $100k per 100k people.
7509,You'd have 10x more winners and it's still a ton of money.
7510,"I didn't downvote and I'm saying incentives were through the vaccine passport (get a vaccine, you can go to concert or sporting event) so they get rewarded in protection and normality."
7511,The areas in the US that are turning down their allotment are up to 50% turning it down.
7512,Shit some rural counties are only in the 20s percentage wise.
7513,These places definitely don't deserve anymore vaccines if this was all they could manage.
7514,I have a science background.
7515,That's probably why I trust it.
7516,"It's just that COVID could infect and maybe kill me while I was sitting around thinking about getting vaccinated, so I got the vaccine."
7517,"I felt that it was a choice between something that has a very, very high chance of being safe vs something that definitely isn't."
7518,Why does anyone take Neil Ferguson seriously as a scientist anymore??
7519,Not only was he forced to resign because he got caught breaking his own covid rules visiting his girlfriend.
7520,But every prediction he’s made both with covid and other viruses has been so wrong.
7521,His initial covid models over estimated covids lethality by a factor of 2-4x.
7522,He was one of the first people to create this hysteria.
7523,"This doesn’t even mention his bird flu, H1N1, and mad cow disease papers which he predicted would kill  “tens of millions”."
7524,He’s a career con artist in inciting panic

7534,"That, and I’m pretty young and healthy, so I’m not too worried about my odds if I somehow managed to get it."
7535,"I was mostly worried about my immunodeficient sister and older parents and they’re all completely vaccinated now, so it hasn’t been *as* pressing for me to search all day/night for a vaccine appointment located half an hour’s drive from me."

7543,Ramadan started April 13.
7544,"Anecdotally, though, most Muslims I know are either studying medicine or are already in the medical field, so they got the vaccine way before everyone else lol."

7547,We need to convince half the republicans for that to happen
7548,&gt;I don't know if I buy the logic that antivaxers will drive vaccine-resistant variants.
7549,"Not by themselves, but if there are enough of them to keep virus levels high enough in the community than there are going to be a lot of opportunities for vaccinated people to catch it."
7550,A lot more so than there would be if most people were vaccinated.
7551,Crazy how people don't want have to spend 17$ to get both a lemonade and an appetizer 🤔
7552,&gt;  The Dutch factory also is a legacy of the abandoned Merck cooperation.
7553,The same factory currently operated by AZ of which the EU is blocking exports to the UK?
7554,Yeah going all in on that sounds like a great idea!
7555,We've already wasted a few hundred million on that plant why not waste even more!
7556,"And to be clear we're talking about the same Merck which has not 1 not 2 but 3 (including the one they bought) failed covid vaccine candidates because they didn't work, expertise my arse."
7557,There is a reason all they are doing now is supporting actually successful vaccine producers.
7558,"Somehow the UK managed to get the british plants of AZ working and reducing the daily death toll in the UK to a fraction of what it was (and certainly better than most of europe at the minute), it's really between AZ and the EU for them to get their european plants up to scratch, but the EU seem more interested in court fights, rhetoric and banning exports than anything else."
7559,Whatever floats their boat not really my business.
7560,We all have a 100% chance of death chicken little.
7561,Your chances of being hit crossing the road or have a spontaneous aortic aneurysm is greater than being infected by COVID-19 and developing serious complications after being vaccinated.

7575,Look back to my country.
7576,So sad.
7577,Inflation can be a problem but ~$200 million dollars to encourage people to get vaccinated is literally nothing in the grand scheme of things
7578,We don’t get to decide what’s high enough to end mask mandates.
7579,The virus does.
7580,Less than 70% even want the vaccine
7581,NGL this is very much a mood.
7582,And here we are in Australia with not even 70% of health care workers being vaccinated.
7583,Exactly.
7584,At the time it may have been the right decision but in hindsight it was very bad.
7585,Take a look at this [graph](https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/04/E0F1eVbVoAgwR27.jpg).

7593,"&gt;Southeastern PA got way fewer vaccines than they should have gotten

It wasn’t without a certain amount of logic."
7594,Vaccine was preferentially distributed to counties with higher levels of virus transmission (which happened to be the ones that didn’t give a shit about COVID-19 restrictions OR the vaccine).
7595,Let's also not forget hard core conservatives that just won't get it because biden wants us too.
7596,But then the next breathe say trump s responsible for getting the vaccine out there with operation warp speed.
7597,"Considering about half the country is saying, 'Thanks, but I'll pass,' I'm not sure that's a realistic, achievable goal... but then again, I'm just looking at it logically."
7598,I am not as enthused.
7599,Hospitalizations and deaths will hit a floor before the 70% vaccination mark.
7600,Then mask requirements will be reluctantly removed when they can't reach the metric.
7601,"Then there will be criticisms that the metric was set unachievably high solely to punish people who refuse to get vaccinated, or that they were always based on bad logic and we've been unnecessarily suffering through the whole pandemic due to incompetence."
7602,"Note that this is not my personal beliefs, just what I believe will happen when lessening restrictions is tied to vaccinations and not rate of deaths/hospitalizations - some people will be making these arguments."
7603,"I don't think THAT 35% cares to get the vaccine since you know, just a flu and makes don't help yada yada yada."
7604,70% is going to be hard even with unlimited time.
7605,Your science background is irrelevant.
7606,The chance of being killed or getting severe hospitalization from covid is very low.
7607,"Though you being middle aged, I understand why you took the vaccine."
7608,How do you feel about having to take a vaccine every year.
7609,"Like I said, long term is the issue."
7610,A comical mistake that was in hindsight.

7615,Why the heck is this comment getting downvoted.
7616,I have asthma and I've also noticed by breathing hasn't been as labored as in past years since I wear a mask everywhere now.
7617,I got my first shot but need to wait almost a month for shot 2.
7618,I’m pretty sure the numbers are percentage of the eligible population who are vaccinated.
7619,"So, for now that means only those 16 or older."
7620,"Stops 95% of infections, depending on the vaccine"
7621,I don’t believe anyone more CDC has claimed it’s 100%.
7622,I got Pfizer and I never believed it to be 100% protection.
7623,Thank you for elaborating.
7624,"Only when being vaporized, which is why this manufacturer thought no one would notice they cut their product with it."
7625,Isn't the consensus slowly settling around 60 to 65% is needed?
7626,But you can’t ignore the fact that the drop nicely coincides with the announcement of the news.

7639,"I’m roughly the same age as you, and also in good health."
7640,I never once worried about what would happen to me if I caught COVID.
7641,"But I’ve been *very* worried that I may accidentally spread COVID, and that someone more at-risk may get very ill (or die) because of my own carelessness."
7642,"I know that there’s still not enough data on how well these vaccines prevent transmission to say anything with certainty, but *in theory* they should reduce transmission, and the preliminary data that’s been published suggests that is indeed the case."

7644,Carrot and stick.

7653,"Going along with that point, there are probably a good amount of people who WANT to get the vaccine, but are struggling to A) find time that they can take off work/away from family responsibilities on two separate but closely linked dates to go get the shots or B) think that they won't be able to spare or even receive an entire day off of work if they do get their ass kicked by the second shot."
7654,I know I was in that camp for a while and that delayed my eventual vaccine appointment.
7655,"For a few weeks every time I was able to actually find an available appointment it was either ""well, the only appt I can find is a 30-40 min drive away and I can't leave for that long in the middle of the work day"" or ""my 2nd shot will fall on day X, and I have such and such important thing the day after the appt that I need to be functional for and can't risk being miserable."""
7656,Thankfully I was able to work it out eventually.
7657,"I'm not sure what the status of the J&amp;J vaccine is right now after the pause ended, but I'm wondering if that one will help reach this 70% goal since it's a lot more convenient for people."
7658,"From what I have seen, it seems he Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are still way more common."
7659,You do what you gotta do.
7660,Mask mandate lifted here and is up to businesses.
7661,I got the shot and work in retail.
7662,I haven’t worn a mask to work in weeks and it’s awesome.
7663,&gt; Instead they listen to the news everyday to find out was ist verboten.
7664,Isn't the news here that masks *aren't* required?

&gt;Again, the problem is that oftentimes you'll find those types of people want everyone else to lockdown too."

7669,Isn’t the final rate for the blood clot risk closer to 1 in 500k?
7670,"But everyone knows the public sucks at understanding probability, that’s why people play the lotto."
7671,"So the public health officials should’ve said “hey, is this risk significant enough to make it known to the population?"
7672,No?
7673,Ok let’s hold off and tell medical professionals to keep an eye out for it”.
7674,Why the fuck is this being downvoted?
7675,Its a genuine question and it should be talked about.
7676,That graph should show when the pause was lifted.
7677,"Also, does it take into account that 1 of 3 major vaccines being taken off the market is going to result in fewer vaccines available for use?"
7678,I’ve got no idea.
7679,Maybe ask them?
7680,I struggle with this one as a partner in a medical private practice.
7681,"Of our staff, about 10% opted to not receive the vaccine."
7682,"Of those who were not vaccinated, all but one has since contracted the virus and been off from work, causing close co-workers to fear exposure (as they were still eating in the break room albeit in a socially distanced way (big room, lots of seating)."
7683,"One of my partners even openly berated one of our staff for having caused a lot of suffering in the practice at a time when we were already stretched thin, causing co-workers to have to take on additional responsibilities in addition to a heavier load of work."
7684,My office manager and I discussed it that it was inappropriate and potentially sensitive for him to have done that.
7685,"But, damn it, I would pay the rest of them $250 to get the vaccine so we could be 100%, and I’d pay those who had already gotten it without a financial reward the same!"
7686,Yep and you have the freedom to pay more for your insurance.
7687,"If Covid is under control enough for the pandemic to just fade out of the collective consciousness in the coming months, then there’s absolutely *no way* that hand shaking or hugs or anything else of that sort goes “extinct”."
7688,I think you’re severely underestimating the necessity and popularity of basic forms of human contact.
7689,Will there be a certain amount of people who shun such contact going forward?
7690,"Yep, and while I consider that a sad thing, they can do as they like."
7691,"But, that’ll just mean more hand shakes and hugs for the rest of us."
7692,[deleted]
7693,Sounds like a threat to me.
7694,Are they going to do it by force?
7695,It appears that it’s going to be at least 5 months here before any sort of meaningful change happens to our restrictions.
7696,"No doubt vaccinations help the numbers, I’m obviously not disputing that at all."
7697,The government just seems unresponsive to the great decreases we’ve been seeing in case and death numbers.
7698,"20 people in a family owned restaurant is unsustainable, and given that nothing changed from 0% vaccination rate to 55%, and there are essentially no plans to make meaningful changes on the next leg of the national and statewide journey, I don’t see that changing, regardless of the numbers."
7699,"Yeah, from what I’ve seen, the reactions tend to be pretty personal."
7700,"I know people my age who’ve been essentially unaffected, I also know people who’ve gotten fevers above 104°."
7701,"I’ve had reactions in the past, so I’m inclined to say I’d be toward the latter end of that spectrum."
7702,"The 6 days number I got was from 2 doses and up to 3 days each, not 6 for both though."
7703,That’s good news.
7704,"They can’t directly charge me, they can’t send me a bill in the mail."
7705,"But what they can do (and probably will do, given the state of things) is pass those costs onto me and my family in other ways which don’t directly violate the law."
7706,My parents are very opposed to me getting the vaccine at this point.
7707,"I’m not taking that into account in making the decision, but they would be rather angry if their rates went up because I got the vaccine."
7708,"I agree, though it’d be nice to see *something*, even down to something like personal covid restrictions depending on vaccination status."
7709,"Admittedly, that would be nearly impossible to enforce."
7710,"Of course we can only say for certain what we’ve observed, but what has been observed is a noticeable wane in effectiveness over time."
7711,"Even putting effectiveness at, say, 1.5 years, I’d still find that prohibitively frequent to have everything shut back down again while everyone gets their 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc shots."
7712,April 13th was my birthday...
7713,I'm sorry.
7714,"I will say, it feels good to live in Florida."
7715,No.

7747,TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GRAAAAPH!
7748,Every time I do it makes me laugh!
7749,The public sucks at everything.
7750,I do reckon we wont hit that 70% mark because Im guessing we never make it past 60% because 40% of the country is gonna be too stupid to get it.
7751,Im at the point where Im calling people pussies for not getting it and so far its worked on the two people Ive called that lol.
7752,They both got theirs.
7753,Please tell me which states only have 10-20% planning to get vaccinated.
7754,Since all states have over 30% with at least one shot so far.

7758,"I think that for a long time he was 100% right in his doomsaying, like prior to Thanksgiving and Christmas and the clusterfuck that happened there."
7759,There was a lot to actually be depressed and anxious about.
7760,"It was a total shit show, at least where I live (Texas)."
7761,It's easy to forget just how rapidly this situation is evolving.
7762,"Just a few weeks ago, supply was a major obstacle for most parts of the country."
7763,"Now suddenly, demand is the issue."
7764,"The government is trying to keep up, but making a major change to the Federal vaccine distribution program is a complex process that could have many unforeseen consequences."
7765,So they're taking the time to plan and study these things before they make any changes.
7766,One.
7767,But schools are open 5 days a week for students.
7768,"If everyone has the opportunity to be vaccinated, those who choose not to have lost the right to demand that the rest of society change their behaviour to accommodate the safety of the unvaccinated."
7769,I don't think it's possible with the number of anti's
7770,Proteins don’t mutate.
7771,Dna/rna does.
7772,Then different proteins get expressed from the mutated nucleic acid
7773,The problem was never the states forest management.
7774,The state spent more on forest management than the feds did even though the feds control more than 10x the forest land in the state.
7775,history rhymes!
7776,"Yeah I mean I'm all for universal healthcare, just pointing out that this literally can't happen within the next few months."
7777,"Yeah, a normally healthy relative of mine got it and recovered after about two weeks, also."
7778,Then like 3 months later he admitted that he still has some chest tightness and wheezing if he exerts himself.
7779,The long term effects are often underestimated.
7780,how do you *not* figure that?
7781,we have evidence now from half of the states that have re-opened.
7782,tables here in CA were very widely spaced apart.

7785,cases continued to fall dramatically even before vaccinations came out.
7786,it's all a moot point now - especially considering how widely available the vaccines are and how well even 1 dose does.

7840,I don't think the 3rd shot is there to boost the 95% even higher.
7841,"Like any vaccine, protection level wanes over time."
7842,"We just haven't had enough data yet to know how long the protection level lasts after the 2nd shot, and how much they drop by."
7843,Maybe by now Pfizer has had some idea and what schedule a 3rd shot should be to keep the same protection level until this pandemic is over.
7844,I didn’t realize how important one dose could be.

7917,They do let them watch tv while they eat but that’s it.
7918,They let them have recess and gym but they make them be in groups and they rotate groups every 2 weeks.
7919,So if she’s stuck in a group of 4 kids she doesn’t like tough shit those are the only kids she can play with for 2 week!
7920,It sucks and I hope next year can be better for them.
7921,It’s been a real struggle this year for my kiddo.

7931,"Honestly, being ready by Fall sounds pretty prioritized to me."
7932,I remember back in March 2020 when people were saying that getting a vaccine approved in 18 months would be breakneck pace.
7933,The fact that we had vaccines already being distributed before the year was out is still pretty mind-boggling.
7934,It’s not that it’s exaggerated with false data.

7958,[removed]
7959,"The other day I spoke with two friends in a row who were totally open to vaccinating, but still hadn't because they didn't realize how easy it's become."
7960,"Except ""easy"" is a relative term - as someone who's been on tight lockdown the past year for family's sake, taking a couple hours to land an appointment was the easiest thing in the world; for someone who can afford to tune out world events and has (somewhat) been living in 2019 Land for the past while, it's a whole rigmoral."
7961,"I'm not even describing the profile of an anti-vaxxer, but just your average tunnel-visioned American."

7963,"I like to think not, but I'm only human."
7964,I tried to say the same thing but it was auto removed.
7965,It may be a case of an overzealous removal bot and not a lack of awareness.
7966,But the comment is correct and there’s one obvious thing Biden must do to encourage vaccinations and everyone knows what it is
7967,I wonder how many of those breakthrough cases are immune-compromised people.
7968,That would make the hospitalization and death rates being the same as unvaxed make a lot of sense.
7969,That's my point.
7970,"&gt;	This might actually be his most ambitious goal yet

7984,Meanwhile back in GA nobody is wearing masks and following distancing.
7985,Today the restaurant my daughter works at closed down due to staff cases.
7986,With 25% vaccinated the numbers may be high again soon.

7989,"That is false, provide your source."
7990,"Everyone knows exactly what will get people off their asses and vaccinated but when I typed it here, it was comically auto removed."
7991,Tell that to a type 1 diabetic.
7992,"If one believes your life depends on the needle, one will take it."
7993,Big entitled children.
7994,I think it was because of a report stating that crematoriums are processing x24 times the average they expect.
7995,It's sad that other countries can't get vaccines while we have a large percentage of the adult population that won't get a free vaccine.
7996,Not that long ago production and availability was the issue and now it's trying to convince the pudding heads to get it.
7997,"Mind you, that was around when states all started opening the vaccine up to the general public, which naturally is gonna be when doses peak, as the appointments will immediately fill up and then after a while they, well, won't."
7998,"So the J&amp;J pause must have had some impact—appointments being cancelled does mean less doses being given, among other issues—but I would be careful to put all the blame on that."
7999,Nah
8000,"Biden has been under promising and overdelivering, so I think they have this forecasted pretty well to go out and say this."
8001,Gotcha.
8002,"IMO, you can't really blame her for being wary about the vaccine."
8003,"Like you said, 50s, overweight, diabetes, etc...a lot of people are saying the vaccines can contribute to blood clots."
8004,"Whether that's true or not, she's probably reading those stories and is scared because she's also at a higher risk for a complication from the vaccine."
8005,Kind of a worst of both worlds.
8006,How does he expect to get The_Dunbasses on board?
8007,Are we sure this is causation and not correlation?
8008,It makes sense that the vaccination rates are dropping as the vaccines are available to nearly everyone sixteen and up.
8009,Not even half the vaccinations we had compared to Tuesday.
8010,And we wont drop mask mandates until we reach 70%?
8011,What the hell are we going to do if people still refuse and were stuck at 60% for the rest of the year?
8012,It seems like just a few months ago that hospitals were so overwhelmed that the closest hospital to me turned their employee parking into the overflow non-COVID-19 emergency room.

8017,I live in Seattle and it became easy to schedule last week and by that I mean there were ~10k appointments unfilled across 3 mass vaxx sites.
8018,"Can’t speak to whether pharmacies were still slammed though, but I guess it’s like since we are definitely hitting the “happy to do it, but ain’t going to work hard”."
8019,That’s why I’m so happy that we are now offering vaccines to any attendee to a Mariners or Sounders (MLS) games.
8020,Yeah I didn’t really change my behaviour much after I got vaccinated.
8021,I haven’t felt unsafe for about a year now.
8022,Plus everything has been closed for months here anyways
8023,Is there a list of which countries have some variants floating around frequently?
8024,"Post-vaccination in the second half of this year I'll be looking to travel a bit, but would still like to reduce my risks slightly since (a) coverage is 94% not 100% and (b) i'm not sure how much prevention this vaccine has."
8025,(c) I'm super indecisive and this would help narrow things down lol
8026,"Haha you know your wrong, moron"
8027,Make it illegal to not have it
8028,Nicee

8032,And common sense.
8033,I don’t disagree with everything he does (I’m much more progressive than biden) but holy fuck imagine having to change your goals to be harder every few months because you’re literally doing too good of a job.
8034,That’s honestly commendable
8035,Agree with everything you said.
8036,It is so frustrating to see people who correctly said “Follow the science” a year ago when coming out in favor of things like mask mandates and lockdowns to completely ignore science now that it’s time to start rolling some of that stuff back.
8037,The guy is clearly a troll making up political spin.
8038,[removed]
8039,"&gt;  real world isn't that split

It's not as split as 90/10, sure....but the US is split between rural and cities."
8040,Cities typically align with a certain political view that corresponds to vaccinations.
8041,Rural areas typically align with the political view that corresponds with Covid denial.
8042,There is definitely a demographic difference that the virus will be able to exploit.
8043,Areas with high concentration of Covid denial are also areas with low vaccine demand.
8044,That's ultimately why there's a surplus in mostly rural states.
8045,"Unless something changes with vaccine demand among the Covid deniers, there will be pockets all over the US where the pandemic will continue to kill."
8046,"Where as, the big cities will be largely safe."

8072,Sometimes a vaccine is more effective with multiple doses.
8073,Phizer and Moderna for example.
8074,"The two doses are the same, but your immune system responds much more strongly to the second dose and provides better immunity after that."
8075,"The same thing could be the case with natural immunity, and a vaccine could provide longer/better immunity."
8076,"But yeah, I don't think there are strong studies to that effect in this case (yet?)."
8077,But it certainly could be the case.
8078,I'd ask your doctor/follow CDC guidance (as you said you are planning to).
8079,For everyone else: CDC says you should get the vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html).
8080,"As they say, just in case resistance gets weaker, you probably don't want to get Covid again."
8081,"Hey look, it's that guy doing his fucking job and not shoving shit down my throat every day."
8082,"Hey there guy, good job!"
8083,They actually don't require either of those vaccines save for certain situations/deployments.
8084,"Source, am military and haven't received either."
8085,Those vaccines also aren't under a EUA.

8131,People who don’t want a vaccine won’t get a vaccine.
8132,"Depends on location and duration of ischemia, but generally speaking, they are not good."
8133,A booster is usually necessary if we know that the level of antibodies spurred by the vaccine drop over time.
8134,"Just like any other vaccine, we need booster at different cadence's depending on how long our bodies keep producing the antibodies, and at what amount."
8135,This amount will invariably decrease.
8136,"If it turns out that the covid antibodies in our blood only stay there for a year or so, if nobody takes the booster than we'd be back to square one."

8139,"Okay, we’ll stop producing vaccines (that are now also being exported) and instead give those raw materials to a company that doesn’t even have an approved vaccine yet."
8140,That will definitely help the global rollout!
8141,We aren’t “hoarding” like so many places like to call it.
8142,"We are fully using 100% of the production capacity, and actually in many cases that isn’t even enough for what we need and we are reusing thing that aren’t supposed to be reused."
8143,"We are going to be supply constrained until the majority of the world has been vaccinated, so instead of simply complaining about the current supply chain, every county that can should be trying to expand the supply chain."
8144,Have you seen any reports of gym outbreaks anywhere?

8148,I've been trying to get vaccinated for what feels like months.
8149,"3 weeks ago I finally had an appointment at a pharmacy, where the pharmacist declined to give me the first shot because I've had reactions to vaccines before."

8169,"&gt; They were employed to conduct rapid antigen tests for passengers at Kualanamu airport in the city of Medan, but police estimated they reused swabs from 150 kits up to 20,000 times."

8174,"But if you don’t really fly, leave the country, or are a road tripper, there is less incentive to get it."
8175,Lol what?
8176,Cases of outdoor transmission have of course been documented.
8177,I don't think that claim is up for contention.
8178,Kind of odd to be so obtuse about philosophy of science and then paint with an absurdly broad brush.
8179,It's a question of magnitude.
8180,It's a plain fact that outdoor transmission is much harder to establish because establishing transmission tends to rely on identifying those who transmitted.

8207,"I don't know if there's any documented cases where it is an issue, but the FDA sure isn't going to wait and see."
8208,Testing would need to be done to show that the two (or more) mixed vaccines have the same efficacy as separated shots.
8209,The reason some vaccines are co-administered is because studies have been done to show they do not lose efficacy when given in this way.
8210,"Personally I don't think there will be an issue, but do strongly believe the study should be done before rolling out any combination shots."
8211,The clinical trials results are published for the public (really: medical professionals) to read and verify.
8212,The necessity for booster shots should be backed by hard data about the waning of antibodies over time.
8213,"Just like any vaccine, our antibodies to a certain pathogen invariably decreases over time."
8214,It's been tried and eventually done away with because no one showed up.
8215,There's a lot of overlap between people that are still scared to go out and those that want events to be vaccinated only.
8216,Why are first doses cratering?
8217,"Has the US administered enough where this is a natural progression, or is there hesitation among the public?"

8221,"I guess they think the ~1/1,000,000 odds of dying of the J+J vaccine is greater than the ~1/555 Americans who have already died of COVID (including both those who got the disease and those who didn't)."

8244,Walking on the sidewalk encountering a dozen people per hour?
8245,"Being outside talking 4hours with a friend, coughing, laughing and sharing?"
8246,The whole narrative that outdoors is safe doesn’t make any sense and it just another case of how reading science properly isn’t the same as just making a cute newspaper headline summary.
8247,There’s a risk whenever you contact people.
8248,"Outdoors has good ventilation so it’s always a lower risk but the risk is there, it’s present and mask usage should still occur in high risk areas at least."
8249,Also rules for vaccinated VS unvaccinated is a terrible idea.
8250,How can anyone enforce that without starting to ask for vaccination certificates from everybody?
8251,Redditors should all work for free
8252,That number is a major undersestimate that downplays India's crisis.
8253,"To put things into perspective, it seems like India is on a path to have 10-20 million COVID deaths unless we take action now."
8254,"I’m sorry, but you gullibles keep touting Pfizer’s own marketing materials."
8255,Was the 1.95 billion dollar contract Marian money or something?
8256,Because I believe it’s in US dollars.
8257,"https://www.cbs58.com/news/fact-checking-the-battle-for-credit-over-pfizers-vaccine-announcement

&gt;So after Pfizer's initial claim to the New York Times that it has never been part of Operation Warp Speed, CNN asked the company if there was any more nuance to the situation."
8258,"In response, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo provided a statement that said the company is indeed part of Operation Warp Speed."
8259,Was the half a billion dollars given to Biontech from the German government to speed the development funny money?
8260,Was the estimated 16 billion dollars in technology that contributed to the development from the US government chump change?
8261,You folks are  doing nothing but lapping up corporate PR in mind blowing ignorance is really something to see.
8262,"The first group is the majority IMO without finding any studies on this, just based on my experience ."
8263,The 2nd group is louder though and make it seem like they’re the majority
8264,"We are far worse than italy even brazil, Our RTPCR labs have a backlog of upto 5 days I had heard many cases where the patient have already died and report had came after funeral."
8265,People weren't dying on street or in a parking lot or in a temple or infront of hospitals in Italy.
8266,Italy never ran out of beds or medical oxygen.
8267,I think that’s their point.
8268,Open up and let them decide if they want to risk it.
8269,I think we need to fully open sooner than later to hit the floor running
8270,This is sad to hear that America is having to throw out the vaccine while people in other countries are dying because they don’t have access to the vaccine.
8271,We need to do a better job as a global society to get rid of this shit virus.

8275,There is chance of actual profit and paying taxes from it.
8276,Amazon on other hand - just in Europe has sales income 44bn €.
8277,And due to accountant magic no taxes from it.
8278,Pfizer saves lives.
8279,Amazon is just e-shop.
8280,You will likely need it for booster shot records!
8281,And they can’t write on laminated cards apparently.
8282,Edit: at least that’s what I was told at my shots.
8283,Good luck with the idiots
8284,Why not?
8285,Exactly.
8286,Proving an outdoor transmission from a stranger is almost as impossible as proving you got it from infected surfaces so numbers aren’t a reliable measure to prove anything.
8287,We know from basic science outdoor transmission can and will occur.
8288,"Yes, it can be at a lower rate but surely the risk is there otherwise they wouldn’t be enforcing the rule in crowded environments."
8289,&gt;Since when have vaccines depended on everyone else getting them to work?
8290,1798
8291,That article was based on the opinions of a very few people.
8292,I can get you an article that the earth will blow up tomorrow if I ask the right people the questions I want.
8293,Seems like they’re hitting a wall.
8294,Now comes the challenging part.
8295,I also set a new goal of becoming the president by July 4.
8296,Which is more likely?
8297,[removed]
8298,"Thanks for making flu season worse for everyone, selfish af"
8299,"""just lock down until the vaccine is here then we will never have to lock down again"""
8300,"Masks will not get us out of this, just like they haven't for the last 15 months."
8301,Vaccines will.
8302,That's the ONLY thing that will.
8303,That's a fair point.
8304,Their messaging has basically been to do a weird combination of failing to scare the vulnerable while freaking out the healthy.
8305,Really?
8306,compared to Wisconsin where indoors I think we have perhaps 50% mask usage now.
8307,mRNA vaccines require cold storage which India lacks even in urban centres.
8308,Transporting this vaccines to rural India is a nightmare because of lack of infrastructure to store the vaccines.
8309,"However, the government should approve it, so that the private sector could import this."
8310,One should keep in mind that the vaccines will be expensive in India than other vaccines.
8311,&gt;	If anything this pandemic has proven that the public SUCKS at risk assesment.
8312,"Like Trevor Noah said about us not being able to get to herd immunity:

*“In these divided times, it’s just great to see all Americans coming together to fail at something so easily achievable.”*"
8313,"To achieve herd immunity since kids aren’t being vaccinated for now, the numbers on adults actually need to be above 70%...

Of course herd immunity is a tough concept here and any kind of high number is good to stop major spreads but if you want to “eradicate” the disease as much as possible, adults would need to be above 70%."
8314,"My kids are too young for this round, but you better believe when their age group comes up, I’ll be crying tears of relief."
8315,"We’ve discussed with them already that when it’s open for them, they will be getting vaccinated."
8316,You can still spread it.
8317,UK is saying it looks like equal risk.
8318,More cases in women simply because healthcare is dominated by females and healthcare workers were the first to get the shots.
8319,https://www.ft.com/content/45cb34d0-eb43-479c-aabf-2e3f537aa2bc
8320,The median age of death of coronavirus is 80.
8321,"E i g h t y

Coronavirus has less of a chance to kill you than the normal life expectancy in the US."
8322,Should vulnerable populations take it seriously and take precautions?
8323,"Sure, get vaccinated."
8324,Should the world be locked down indefinitely for virtually zero tangible benefit?
8325,"Obviously not, this is just pure reactionary head-in-sand level insanity."
8326,You are safest when you are locked in your house seeing nobody and doing nothing.
8327,Living your life bears risk.
8328,You will die one day.
8329,"If you are too afraid to live life, stop resenting those who aren’t."
8330,Aw hell naw
8331,I’m out of school.
8332,I pay my taxes.
8333,"I’m perfectly fine with spending money for infrastructure, social welfare, etc."
8334,What I’m not okay with is assuming risks of idiots.
8335,If we are going to stimulate the economy then only those who are doing the necessary actions required to help the country should get funds.
8336,Personally I’m tired of the antivaxers delaying the economy for fully reopening.
8337,Do you want a medal?
8338,Again.
8339,I'm not saying the risk isn't much lower.
8340,Extreme sociopathic selfishness ain't fucking freedom if it puts me and mine at risk.
8341,"Our church partnered with a local pharmacy one Sunday morning and we offered it, on church property, to any congregants that wanted one."
8342,"It's a pretty great idea, provided church leadership is on board with the idea (and, thankfully, ours is)."
8343,To be fair the messaging regarding transmission was atrocious.
8344,A lot of people are still under the impression that the vaccinations don't affect your ability to spread covid.
8345,I spent a month trying to get vaccinated in Michigan after I became eligible as an essential worker.
8346,I tried every pharmacy and whatever within 25 miles with no luck.
8347,Almost all of my friends (most of whom work from home) managed to get appointments but I couldn't for whatever reason.
8348,Then I had to travel for work and got covid.
8349,That was three weeks ago and I still can't get an appointment.
8350,So don't assume that it's widely available everywhere.
8351,I suspect yes.
8352,"Provinces have kept pace with all of the increasing supply so far, no reason to think it'll be different now."
8353,"This was all known ahead of time, with the exception of the slightly quicker Moderna shipment."
8354,"That did occur, yes."
8355,"But it's hard to get a handle asymptomatic infections, because those people are a lot less likely to get tested."
8356,"Therefore, the numbers we do have usually skew to symptomatic."
8357,"While it's true this isn't a super-precise comparison, I'm not making a super-precise statement: I'm merely saying the numbers look similar if you squint at them."
8358,&gt;It has been well documented that kids are at exceedingly low risk of serious illness from COVID-19.
8359,"For perspective, the CDC estimates that around 600 children died of influenza in the 2017–18 season; during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu deaths were reported."
8360,"Each year, more than 700 children die from drowning."
8361,"Through the end of April, 277 have died from COVID-19."
8362,Lmfao unfuckingbelievable that people want children on lockdown for &gt;20% of their life.
8363,She pissed soooooo many ppl off she backtracked.
8364,Our hospitalizations are 350 by the way.
8365,Less than 10% of our capacity.
8366,No one is overwhelmed here
8367," It's just I'm not sure how many people are diligently always wearing their makes, but haven't gotten the vaccine."
8368,"Kids are extremely low risk when it comes to covid, it's much more important that we get the adult population vaccinated."
8369,you can definitely get covid twice
8370,We live in a society...
8371,yo i might just be weak but if yall can work with a hangover i salute you
8372,[removed]
8373,70% would get us to some level of herd immunity.
8374,"Especially since around 10-15% of people had Covid and so have some level of immunity, if only temporary."
8375,This is a worthy goal.
8376,"If he succeeds, Covid cases in the US will fall off a cliff after July 4th."
8377,Don’t believe me?
8378,Look into what’s happened in Israel.
8379,&gt; We’re over 50 now….
8380,No you aren't: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
8381,I'm in the central valley.
8382,They do things different here lol.
8383,I wish they would have something like this in Illinois.
8384,"The Chicago mayor came out today saying everything will open up by the 4th of July, but it's rumored the mask mandate will stay in place for the next year."
8385,I got my J&amp;J vaccine last week but I know some people that aren't getting vaccinated because the incentive for someone in their 20s in basically zero.
8386,"&gt; bruh its a tuesday

That's the normal life I know!!"
8387,!
8388,"You don't think that maybe your anxiety is fucking with you about the vaccine, and not the other way around?"
8389,You're literally worried about it right now.
8390,"I'm pretty sure the only variant that gets away from a vaccine is the South African with AstraZeneca (and I think Sinovac with Brazilian variant), I assume you're either American or Canadian so you probably didn't get one of those so you're good to go."
8391,"Dude, if this was as bad as the plague, society would have ended."
8392,Europe managed to survive the plague because most people actually knew how to grow their own food.
8393,"If that happened to us, western society would've suffered total collapse."
8394,"And covid has killed approximately 570,000 in one year in the US."
8395,If it kills fewer next year it will be because of the vaccine.
8396,Hard disagree.
8397,"The risks are far outweighed by the benefits, but the cause/effect connection does seem to be there, and it would be impossible to keep it unnoticed as more and more occurrences happened."
8398,"In the long run, it would either come out officially, or become obvious, that the FDA knew about the side effect, but decided to keep quiet to keep people getting vaccines, and public trust would be shot for the next pandemic."
8399,25 year old man here.
8400,First dose is tomorrow.
8401,Toss me in that crater!
8402,Woohoo!
8403,Also a lot of skepticism from POC thanks to things like Tuskegee.
8404,"fair bets are Europe, especially the UK."
8405,Everything else is kinda up in the air.
8406,Didn't you just defend the constitution?
8407,That was written by the government.
8408,They certainly gave lots of freedom to blacks in that document.
8409,Can we ask for 100 million?
8410,Oh I like that idea.
8411,Not everyone gets anthrax?
8412,"I knew small pox, but now I'm saucy about anthrax, that one sucked more every time."
8413,Thats a really tough situation.
8414,Really sucks that kids are suffering because we haven't made the best decisions in the last year.
8415,"I totally agree, really hope in august we have some semblance of normal."
8416,"Over 10% of Mexico finally has at least 1 shot, let's go!"
8417,Please papá Biden send us some more doses!
8418,Please feel free to sue europe and cite the american constitution for not allowing you to fly there.
8419,"Well, I guess I'm a little better now."
8420,"At one point (last year), I started talking to an action figure (it was Batman, btw)."
8421,I did.
8422,He said he was done.
8423,Here in the Bay Area pretty much everyone was wearing them outside up until the CDC said we didn't have to anymore.
8424,Yes.
8425,Most people hate them.
8426,My husband does even though he wears them.
8427,Some people have sensory issues and hate wearing jeans or socks with seams or any number of things.
8428,Masks are much more unnatural than those things.
8429,"I dont hate masks and don't think they're that big of a deal, but I will burn them all in celebration when I dont have to wear them anymore."
8430,It's not a badge of honor to wear a mask for me like it is for some people.
8431,"Now that I'm fully vaccinated, I never wear them except when mandated by the state."
8432,"I'm not going to throw a fit, but they're also unnecessary at this point so I'm looking forward to when it changes."
8433,[removed]
8434,My Aunt is getting married.
8435,"Actually she got married privately last year, but after postponing the big marriage party and reception three times, she's decided that she's waited enough."
8436,"Our 20-something cousins are all unvaccinated and Aunt has convinced them that any COVID they catch will be mild, so everyone is all in on this party."
8437,It's turning into a combination family gathering /  marriage / infection party.
8438,Batshit crazy.
8439,Oh yes it was a thing: https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76144/why-no-one-wanted-aws-third-pound-burger
8440,We didn't but we are still tired.
8441,"We have been getting half measures that some think isn't enough, and others think are too much."
8442,Our premier has essentially lost trust and support from all sides without enforcement of restrictions...resulting in super high cases.
8443,"I totally agree, I have family in that scenario."
8444,Masks were right to be mandated.
8445,"The vaccine could never be mandated, nor should it be."
8446,50% of the country is not vaccinated yet...
8447,I mean the name should of given that away.
8448,This entire site and all of the top of the front page are children.
8449,That's why this site seems completely out of touch with reality.
8450,"Give it a bit more time, but I agree"

8522,"The more accessible the vaccine, the better."
8523,It was a trivia night at the bar
8524,How are they rewarding you for those behaviors?
8525,Is it through lower premiums or discounts on things like gym memberships?
8526,Also is it the actual plan providing the benefit or the company you work for?
8527,"Also, there's a difference in group plans and individual plans."
8528,"With ACA individual plans you can't charge someone less or more simply due to health history, which would include vaccination record."

8536,In all fairness the real bottle neck for vaccine distribution was the manufacturing capacity not the administration of the doses.
8537,The supply was especially constrained during trump’s two months in office while the vaccine was out.
8538,If Trump activated them in December they’d be manning ghost town vaccination sites since there was hardly any supply yet.

8567,I am less aware of how peachy it was in New Zealand.
8568,"Add to that list Finland, Norway and Australia."
8569,"But after reading the New Yorker article, it just seemed like the vast majority of the world was doomed between sustaining damage while staying open (U.S.) or suffering through multiple, extended lockdowns (UK, Germany), and a myriad of combinations in that spectrum (e.g."
8570,"vulnerable, developing countries that are like sitting ducks)."
8571,"Of course, things can always be improved."
8572,It's pretty obvious what went wrong in the US.
8573,But there's some solace in knowing most everyone failed badly in many ways.
8574,"The successful outliers seemed to hit the jackpot on geography, effective governance, and compliance from the populace."
8575,Exceedingly (!!)
8576,few got the eradicate-the-pandemic secret sauce right.
8577,"That is until the magical vaccines came to save the day, then it looks like that was a moneybags situation."
8578,"Probably a carryover to the old belief that there was a fomite risk with this virus (catching it by touching the slide, the swings, the bars with snotty hands) but now they know that’s really not how this virus spreads, so they need to update these rules."
8579,Especially when it gets in the way of outdoor play for kids.
8580,The Centners used to only run the pre-K but the owner/manager of the rest of the school retired/sold it to them and they’re crazy idiots.
8581,They also have 5G blocking shield on the classroom windows because they believe in 5G conspiracies.
8582,I got the same thing with CVS.
8583,According to the press release they plan on mandating it outdoors too until the 70% figure is reached.
8584,"I'm not bothered by needles but the big factor for me and everyone I know was the hassle of dealing with the signup and appointment bureaucracy, having to enter personal information to a web site before you can find out where the appointments are, having to keep checking the site every day for an opening instead of letting them schedule them a few weeks out, etc."
8585,Monstrous hassle.
8586,Now there is more drop-in vaccination and that is a big help.
8587,"But I still like the proposal I saw, of sending vaccines out into neighborhoods on ice cream trucks."
8588,[removed]
8589,But the health and saftey of other employees trumps any disability or medical condition.
8590,It will be.

8596,Look away and you don’t even feel it
8597,"Exactly, they're failing to source because they missed the boat."
8598,The US is just the scapegoat to avoid blaming other EU manufacturers for their failure.
8599,Quality controlled at factory.
8600,Too bad 40% of Americans are imbeciles who will never vaccinate.
8601,"I think you have a lot of thoughtful, real shit to say"
8602,What about basketball?
8603,Can I play 5v5 basketball outdoors?
8604,"It’s tough IMO because while I’m outdoors and it’s a total of 10 people, you are breathing hard and in close proximity

What about soccer?"
8605,Not much close proximity there.
8606,Volleyball and tennis seem fine.

8609,"I think it's not necessarily just the headline cost of Pfizer that is the issue but some of the other stuff Pfizer requires, things like the government paying any lawsuits put against Pfizer and at least in some south american countries Pfizer has been requiring things like embassies abroad as collateral."
8610,I can definitely see why some poorer countries around the world so far have refused to sign contracts with Pfizer.
8611,"Also, the costs at hospitals and private hospitals include the cut for them to deliver said vaccine (so Pfizer's would be higher than 740 rupees here) the base price for both current indian vaccines is 150 rupees, which when you've got such a large population is significant."

8615,I got two lindt truffles on my second shot.

8621,&gt; The company took no real risk because the research was government subsidized (i.e.
8622,paid for by the people).
8623,Not by the US government it wasn't.
8624,They paid for vaccines if they were approved.
8625,"The upfront risk was solely on Pfizer, they didn't take any money from the government to develop it."
8626,That should be the reward for getting the shot.
8627,"I swear I read this same comment somewhere else recently, or a very similar one."
8628,Maybe lots of redditors are getting haircuts from this same lady.
8629,"In last 15 days my 3 close relatives are dead, everyday someone we know is dying."
8630,Today one of my father's colleague and my colage friend's dad died.
8631,Because those saftey measures are only partially effective.
8632,"Indoors, masks and 6ft of distance is not sufficient to prevent infection and spread of the virus."
8633,Vaccinated persons can still get covid (both symptomatic and non-symptomatic); Further vaccinated persons can still spread the virus.
8634,"Which is why indoors, even when vaccinated, masks are still required."
8635,BS.
8636,Their vaxx doesn't l even have trial results.
8637,They fell behind and won't get a big slice of the profits from vaccinating the world and they're trying to blame the US because its the world's scapegoat.
8638,They turned down the US production collab and were praised locally for doing so.
8639,They tied their own rope.
8640,There's no reason they should be getting resources for an unproven product when the same resouces could be spent on something that works.
8641,"I don't live in a fire danger area, but if it's anything like last year it'll get so bad here in the bay area it hurts to breathe."
8642,I suspect that the question is about interactions between the vaccine and the procedure/preparation.
8643,"If that's the case, my answer would be to check with the surgery center."
8644,"Finally, someone is moving the goalposts for good!"
8645,"How safe would you feel, fully vaccinated with a mask, inside a hotel ballroom for a whole weekend?"
8646,(Trade shows with heavy foot traffic).
8647,"*Time span is later this fall, across the US."
8648,*
8649,Funny how all the rich people are getting it.
8650,You'd imagine that'd give some hints to these people.
8651,"If the people who control the masses are being vaccinated, who controls them then?!"
8652,Wait.. is it aliens???
8653,?
8654,"Krispy Kreme instituted a nationwide ""free donut a day"" policy if you show your vaccination card."
8655,"If more places do this in sure it'll help with at least a few percent of folks who would get it just for free food, but not to save others."
8656,Ain't happening here in America.
8657,Too many anti-vaxxers don't want 5G signals in them.
8658,"My hope is he changes the laws to affirm employers' rights to require vaccination as workplace safety standards like wearing helmets, gloves and so on."
8659,So more employers take the steps without fearing litigations.
8660,Man I was so looking forward to the post-Covid party.
8661,So this is like 1% of total cases or what?
8662,This whole xenophobic fear mongering line is getting old.
8663,The virus is endemic.
8664,"10 times as many people got it while they were grocery shopping, yet international travelers are sitting there doing weeks of isolation because reasons?"
8665,Ok.
8666,Lets keep being morons and wonder why everyone ignores our stupid rules I guess.
8667,I am fully vaccinated but I’m in Texas haha.
8668,This morning on my run I stopped in a park bathroom and put my mask on before going in to use it.
8669,"I continued my run, and a half mile later realized I still had my mask up and pulled it down."
8670,I literally forgot I was wearing the mask.
8671,"It was cool out and so it didn't feel particularly hot and stuffy, and I was jogging at a slow pace so the breathing wasn't an issue."
8672,"It's not always anxiety or misinformation, sometimes it's just habit or daydreaming."
8673,I think they mentioned shifting attention from mass vaccination sites to trying to more rural areas and make it easier/convinient for people.
8674,"They're right across the street from one, though."
8675,Won't work.
8676,Most deniers would not wear masks either.
8677,"And, some vaccinate people will continue wearing masks ""just in case"""
8678,Thank you for saying this.
8679,Some people on here don’t believe people think this way
8680,"Mine is in September, so I'm feeling good."
8681,I'm concerned about her comments regarding masks though.
8682,I'm really hoping it was off the cuff and we won't have to worry about in the fall.
8683,Choo choo!
8684,Have you ever stubbed your toe?
8685,That's worse than the COVID shot.
8686,&gt; All other data suggests that number would be somewhere between 85-95% larger.
8687,"You should post this, this would be helpful."
8688,"Yes, the comparison I wrote above is not perfect."
8689,It's just a rough consideration I made when I looked at these numbers.
8690,"And it also felt reasonable to consider this as a huge efficacy win when I'd noticed multiple docs (Monica Gandhi, Lucy McBride, Vinay Prasad) discussing how rare it would be to be severely impacted by COVID after vaccination, who also referenced back-calc'd percentages like I did above on the vaccine breakthroughs."
8691,"Interesting they they're giving the passes to people who have had and recovered from COVID, not just those who have been vaccinated."
8692,You fully vaxxed?
8693,"You live near Columbus, Ohio?"
8694,Ok I'm going to get downvoted to eternity but I have a severe phobia to needles and I got both moderna shots.
8695,My mom works in healthcare and she got COVID.
8696,Thought of loosing loved ones out weighted the phobia.
8697,I passed out and everything from the shots because of how freaked out I was.
8698,Passing out is not fun though 10/10 do not recommend.
8699,"Please get vaccinated, you can get over it."
8700,"As far as Canada, they may be able to purchase some of our excess supply but really there is plenty of vaccines being made now."
8701,There is no reason they can't purchase adequate supply on their own.
8702,They aren't a third world country.
8703,For me the first caused residual pain that resembled the TDAP vaccine.
8704,The second caused even more soreness.
8705,But it was all worth it.
8706,"Ah, finally agoal that can't be met."
8707,Thanks republican voters
8708,Shingles vaccines are pretty low too iirc.
8709,"Ah yes, crossing lines drawn by governments means that you shouldn't have freedom."
8710,Sounds reasonable.
8711,"ew, they're everywhere"
8712,"As a former public school teacher I was never required to do anything medically except a piss test

Edit: this is what unions are for."
8713,If they required it for those in a union that shit will go south soooooooo fast
8714,Haha!
8715,"They should, especially since a lot of people still don’t seem to understand that it’s free."
8716,I was on 3 waiting lists.
8717,VA. hospital and county health dept.
8718,I kept trying different locations and then I was lucky to get an appointment from a Walgreens 40 miles away last month and now have both  pfizer shots.
8719,I still haven't heard from the the VA or the hospital.
8720,It's possible people are on a waiting list and just don't try other options.
8721,My in-laws would still be waiting  if it wasn't for my sister in law constantly checking all options.
8722,Nah.
8723,We'll pay them back with vaccines.
8724,Keep the good stuff at home!
8725,"Much of Los Angeles is converting to walk-in, no appointment needed."
8726,I think we will continue to see that.
8727,Pharmacies and retail outlets will just start offering as you walk in.
8728,"Come get a shot, it will take 1 minute."
8729,Full approval also simplifies the supply chain.
8730,"IIRC, under an EUA the vaccines first have to be delivered to the government, who then doles them out to providers."
8731,"Under full authorization, the vaccine can be bought directly from Pfizer."
8732,But they require other vaccinations
8733,&gt; The $100 payments for those &lt; 35 is still a work in progress.
8734,"Considering the main anti-vaxxer demographics, there'd be more success offering free lift-kits."
8735,"I was also there all of last week, and I agree."
8736,The Magnificent Mile was bustling and packed.
8737,"But it was nice, it felt like we really are inching closer to a normal life again with all of the vaccinations!"
8738,Weird the number of people dying and the unknown possibly detrimental or deadly long term affects caused the opposite reaction in me.
8739,I can understand people that don’t feel pressured to leave their homes or end isolation not being in a rush to vaccinate or being busy and having a hard time scheduling around their life but I don’t understand someone who wants to go out and see family and friends or just otherwise life a normal life seeing all the news about COVID and that causing them to be apathetic.
8740,I have to assume that their lives weren’t particularly disrupted by COVID.
8741,They must not have been canceling vacations or visits with family or friends like a lot of other people.
8742,He seems like another InfoWars and will soon start selling overpriced supplements that claim to make your dong longer.
8743,Becomes a little tricky when it’s not a private company but I agree.
8744,Not realistic with the amount of people not returning for their 2nd doses and the people that just won't get it period.
8745,"I think some municipalities will literally just start going door to door, neighborhood by neighborhood."
8746,Some already are.
8747,Make it as easy and hard to refuse as possible.
8748,Combine that with universities and work places having the legal footing to require it soon with FDA full approval.
8749,"Does this mean the awful, awful cough I had in Mexico in February 2020 could have been some variant of Covid?"
8750,Thank you.
8751,I was trying to poke fun at myself but think I came across a little arrogant there.
8752,Damn my lacking in social nuance!
8753,I will never get the e-respect I deserve!
8754,Wut... Profit is the thing that makes the system function better.
8755,Canada's not for profit medical system is facing collapse under significantly less pressure than the American for profit system yet somehow profit is the problem here?
8756,Pretty sure (100% sure) they got this backwards.
8757,In my opinion there is a difference between not buying  an approved vaccine and not processing an application made month ago.
8758,Now they do not even have the option.

8771,I barely felt the needle but a few hrs later it felt like someone punched the hell out of my arm.

8818,i think it’s a double great idea - get people vaccinated and get them feeling safe about dining again (given that restaurants will be going about it in a safe way.)
8819,They need to be advertising more aggressively.

8925,Most won't take action until theres a reason to.
8926,Also it's hard to make them want to take a vaccine for something they either think doesn't exist or that they believe to be massively exaggerated with false data.
8927,"Proof of vaccines should be required to get into any place that cards(bar, club, etc)."

8930,Approval — No COVID-19 vaccines have been approved.
8931,Approval means the FDA has officially decided that a product is safe and effective for its designated use.
8932,The process for approval involves rigorous reviews of all available data on the product and can take several months.
8933,"Authorization — To speed things up in an emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can grant an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)."
8934,"An EUA, as its name implies, authorizes a product for use during unusually urgent circumstances if the benefits of its use outweigh any known or potential risks."
8935,A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we can’t afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll.

8954,We have a huge pandemic because of too frequent failures to take precautions based on false optimism.
8955,That’s not true.
8956,There is very much a spectrum of folks who are hesitant and there ARE persuadable people in the hesitancy bucket.
8957,"On one end, there are folks that won’t get vaccinated no matter what."
8958,"And on the other end, there are people that would rather not get the shot unless they’re mandated to do so, or strongly encouraged to do so (in person) by their local physician."
8959,"My Google searches are not particularly fruitful at the moment, but I know for a fact that I heard NPR break down a US survey of hesitant people that dug into what would motivate them to get a shot."
8960,"IMHO, we need to get FDA approval so schools and employers can enforce mandates as they’ve done for other immunizations."

9182,"He probably means the mention of taxation, it would probably be unconstitutional to tax someone more because they didn't have a medical procedure done."
9183,"However in general, it's going to be less costly and risky to have private business institute vaccine requirements."
9184,I worry judges of the last 4 years would rule in a political manner on this.
9185,India still has millions of people who can afford this vaccine.

9195,J&amp;J pause was definitely a disaster.
9196,"Our deaths have been flat though, and have decreased."
9197,"I get that argument, but by the time she announced it last week we were already seeing a decline."
9198,"Modeling already had us declining based on vaccinations, and restaurants and gyms are really not significant in our numbers honestly."
9199,"Problem is this is actually working against him now, because Republicans see it as an opportunity to make him look bad by persisting in their anti-vax behavior."
9200,"As noted by others, the evidence thus far is that outdoor transmission is a substantial minority of cases (see below, about 10%) ."
9201,"The poster directly above is probably overstating his position in the burden if proof, but still, to say that outdoor transmission is more than this requires proof in excess if the evidence we have."
9202,Having a gut feeling isn't a substitute for evidence.
9203,"I mean, it's not entirely absurd of an idea for a company to solve a worldwide pandemic for the greater good and not ask for compensation."
9204,"I don't care that they are getting paid, but it's not an absurd premise."
9205,Plenty of people have refused to patent certain inventions for the greater good over the course of history.
9206,They’re just potentially looking for approval for it.
9207,It wouldn’t be Pfizer’s decision if it was administered or not.
9208,Better be comin in hot with those Red Lobster coupons.

9215,My university sent out a survey to students asking how we would feel about the vaccine being mandatory for the fall semester onward.
9216,Aw you’re no fun 😘
9217,I’d argue the pause wasn’t a wrong move.
9218,It’s their job to stop a vaccine to check out what’s going on.
9219,They were literally just a responsible agency doing their job.
9220,People freaking out and stopping getting all vaccines was terrible but again I think the government agency shouldn’t be blamed for doing their job by the book.

9235,I took my 17 yr for his second dose Saturday at Walmart in TX.
9236,A couple walked up and asked for the vaccine w/o an appt - the pharmacy registered them on the spot and vaccinated them.
9237,This is the way.
9238,Please don't encourage this.
9239,It makes people lax and the virus keeps spreading some more.
9240,And now the India variant is in play.
9241,"From the link:

""Pfizer expects to apply to the Food and Drug Administration in September for emergency authorization to administer its coronavirus vaccine to children between the ages of 2 and 11"""
9242,Would be more helpful to know how many cases turned into hospitalizations
9243,"&gt; I couldn't even watch tv or sleep, I just laid there in misery."
9244,Same.
9245,I envy everyone who said they were so tired after the second dose that they slept all day.
9246,I wish I could have found relief in sleep.
9247,I genuinely worried my head might explode from the pain.
9248,"&gt; Nurses told me most people not coming back for 2nd shot

Ugh...."
9249,Wtf?
9250,And he's the guy who has been saying we're heading towards a permademic.
9251,Now I don't know what to believe.
9252,MA is at 70% 1 dose already.
9253,Thankfully the Mayor of Boston has generously agreed to let us have 1 week of summer with our 8/22 opening with the rest of the state earlier that month.
9254,I really don't know what more we are supposed to do.
9255,We were told it would get moved up a few weeks only if we accelerate vaccination but we've hit our threshold and are declining quickly.
9256,It almost makes it feel like it doesn't matter either way.
9257,This is not true at all.
9258,"Really, both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia get starved for resources by the poor, rural counties."
9259,Yup.
9260,Chasing down these hesitant demographics will be a true test for the administration.
9261,It will be an interesting intersection of public health and deployment of government resources.
9262,I have zero doubt that Biden would set this goal if he didn't already have all of his experts telling him how to do it.

9270,This is EXACTLY my experience right now.

9272,"Thanks for commenting with your experience, makes me feel slightly better."
9273,"LMAOOO

but not for obese people paying more right?"
9274,This is good and based on this this should be close to achieving Herd immunity with the Vaccines.
9275,Also he announced 12-16 year olds can take the Pfizer Biontech vaccine.
9276,Looks like Middle Schools will start requiring anyone going to in person schooling take the vaccine.
9277,"First vaccine I’ve ever taken that necessitated calling in sick to work after, though."
9278,"I, for one, don't want to sentence the stupid to death."
9279,"Mostly because I have vaccine hesitant family, but still."
9280,There are many more obese people in the world than starving.
9281,The only places in the world with food shortages are conflict zones like Syria or Yemen and political pariah states like Sudan and Venezuela.
9282,"Apart from desolate places like that, humanity has essentially eradicated hunger."
9283,If you believed everything on social media you'd think the world is about to end and life is worse than ever before.
9284,The reality is that life today (barring corona) is the best it's ever been.
9285,To those who have recently had Covid- what was your experience?
9286,I had a positive test on Sunday 4/25 and my quarantine ends tomorrow Weds 5/5.
9287,This has been an odd experience and I still feel like I have a fever.
9288,"I am an active, healthy 26/F."
9289,I really miss going to the gym and moving my body.
9290,Any advice?
9291,Google that right now you’ll find out it’s 10x more likely to kill you than the flu.
9292,"Seriously, just google it and do the math."

9294,"Unlikely, but you can get it at non government locations like drug stores etc."

It’s a game of numbers."
9299,"I personally know a 39 year old dude who got very sick for two weeks, and had symptoms for a month."
9300,"This isn’t Ebola, but it’s worth getting a shot and moving on with our fucking lives."
9301,"Ahh, yeah that's legit then."
9302,"I agree, insurance companies should absolutely be incentivizing people to get the vaccine beyond it just being free."
9303,"What do you consider a ""significantly high rate""."
9304,"I have my 2 shots now, but I also wanted to wait until 6 months post the vaccines becoming available to see if there would be longer term effects in populations that were more representative of me and with data not compiled by companies with a financial interest in being the first to market."
9305,I think this was a reasonable risk assessment given the risks I faced and not interacting with any at risk populations.
9306,Luckily I didn't really have to make a choice since my chance came up pretty close to 6 months.
9307,Its a coincidence imo.
9308,Polling has only ever shown 60-70% of people taking it (and most showed lower 60s).
9309,We are close to that so its slowing down
9310,Yup.
9311,I think a lot of people were actually helped mentally by this as strange as that sounds.
9312,The constant pressure to go go goalless the ti.e with little time for family or just living life simply.
9313,Pursuing hobbies and friendships left by the wayside.
9314,We've done Friday movie or game night for more than a year via zoom or Netflix party and discord.
9315,On the other hand we are at the point t now where we have had time to recharge and are beginning to get antsy or course.
9316,Hopefully enough people will be vaccinated that we can have a somewhat normal summer.
9317,That need to be the message to the anti vaccine people.
9318,Just get vaccinated and we can live life again!
9319,Ugh
9320,"&gt;	A vaccine is just as much of a variable to me as Covid is

Frankly, it shouldn’t be."
9321,Not even close.
9322,See [this comment](https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4uoij/_/gwy04on/?context=1).
9323,Glad you got vaccinated but that line of thinking is why we have people refusing the vaccine.
9324,I'd love for you to go on:  with a coherent argument about why a simple IP waiver would be sufficient for another manufacturer to reverse engineer and produce complex vaccines.
9325,The J&amp;J pause surely had an impact on some people being more hesitant.
9326,"With really low likelihood of problems but scary results, people are much less apt to do it."
9327,"We're much more scared of sharks than coconuts, but coconuts kill more people every year."
9328,Ah I see you managed to link to that graph without the automod hammer for linking to the blog that posted it originally.
9329,J&amp;J pause was a disaster.
9330,Who are the people that you have to care for?
9331,Everyone that wants to get a vaccine can (1st world countries only).
9332,You can also choose to live your entire life without being in public contact with people.
9333,Walmart and Amazon will directly send anything you could ever need to your front door.
9334,So who are these people that you're wasting energy caring about?
9335,People that don't want the help.
9336,What a hero.
9337,"Well, those logistics are near god tier now!"
9338,That took a few months.
9339,"A few monthe that could have saved lives, stiffled outbreaks, and, allowed a quicker reopening."
9340,Now those folks that are clamoring for less restrictions are going to have to make a choice.
9341,Being socially respisible or being bat shit crazy.
9342,Can we charge obese people more too?!
9343,That would be great.
9344,Yeah that's how I felt.
9345,"I've NEVER been anti-vax, but I also didn't want to be in the first round of people to get one of the vaccines just in case something went sideways."
9346,I think they've proven themselves (especially Pfizer and Moderna) to be safe &amp; effective now though!
9347,"At 6 days later, I'd get tested."
9348,My husband got the first shot and tested positive several days later with similar symptoms as you described.
9349,There's no constitutional way to do that.
9350,[removed]
9351,"That festival has been on life support for a few years now, anyway."

9365,Vaccinated people can still get covid albeit rare.
9366,In HR are you willing to tolerate one employee creating a Toxic work environment and being reason for unrest and/or a mass exodus of talent?
9367,AZ is not a one dose vaccine.
9368,First we need to fact check the fact checkers and make sure they ain't takin er jobs !
9369,I'll get my second moderna in 10 days woohoo.
9370,I got my first because I was at a laundry mat next to a community center that had extras to give out so they went around to all the businesses near by asking people if they wanted it.
9371,Because the contract states that the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine has to be sold at cost.
9372,There is a reason why it's one of if not the cheapest currently available.
9373,Go have a look at the prices the EU paid for various vaccines and see just how cheap AZ is in comparison to everything else.
9374,"&gt;  The Uni Oxford would have preferred Merck, by the way, before the British health minister intervened."
9375,"Thank god they did to, if we let Merck do it then it would be produced in America and the UK wouldn't have seen any of it until far later on due to vaccine nationalism."
9376,By far the smartest move of the pandemic so far.
9377,I went to my mom's house in Idaho and it was like every Idaho resident took it personally that the main firework show had been cancelled.
9378,I saw more fireworks last year (BIG ones too) going off in her neighborhood than I've ever seen at a big show.
9379,Both terrifying and awesome at the same time.
9380,We took out our lawn chairs and just sat in the driveway.
9381,These people must have spent thousands at the nearby reservation.
9382,Just went to the gym for the first time since COVID started and I was the only one wearing a mask.
9383,It honestly really sucked wearing it while exercising.
9384,Do you guys think it’s probably reasonably safe to go without it now?
9385,I’m fully vaccinated and so are my family and friends that I see.
9386,The gym wasn’t very crowded and I was at least ten feet away from everyone the whole time I was exercising.
9387,Also cases are pretty low in my area.
9388,Around 4-5 per 100k.
9389,"Yeah, I just got a call *today* from the pharmacy I had originally had a J&amp;J vaccine appointment for."
9390,The original shot was supposed to happen the day they paused the J&amp;J shots.
9391,Luckily I managed to schedule a Pfizer/BioNtech shot at another pharmacy.
9392,But I doubt everyone who had their appointments canceled are as persistent.
9393,Sobs in Florida.
9394,I'm not so sure about that...
9395,I remember reading that there was a similar trend in the US: their for-profit retirement homes had much higher mortality as well.
9396,Profit does not always make the system function better.
9397,"Some things, like taking care of our elders, or public transit, or making sure our drinking water stays clean, are too important to give to cut-throat capitalists whose main motivation is to cut costs and squeeze profits."
9398,That's been proven many times in the past.
9399,[deleted]
9400,"I'd settle for a discounted value meal at Burger King that includes one burger upgrade that I can choose from like cheese, bacon, or a premium sauce."
9401,Sobs in Canadian
9402,Nah dawg.
9403,[deleted]
9404,"Not much has changed, but most people don't realize that CA never mandated it only when you were near people."
9405,"Same here, but my HR is headed by a woman, does that count?"
9406,[removed]
9407,"This article was written on September 25th of 2020, why post it now?"
9408,Yeah we can't do anything about it becoming partisan cause of the last president we just have to live with it now and if the only way is your workplace making you do it and restaurants and bars making you have a vaccine passport it'll cut down on a lot of antivaxx.
9409,&gt; This means herd-immunity effects may not be within reach until someone can prove the vaccines are safe for kids.
9410,"Or, you know, do what Vietnam and New Zealand did and just do masks and distancing."
9411,Fraction of the cost.
9412,America b bad.
9413,My neighbors got theirs in late February and early March cos they were waiting for the RiteAid on the corner to give them shots.
9414,Another neighbor wasn’t tech savvy and needed me to make him an appointment.
9415,I got like everyone vaccines.
9416,I am a vaccine hunter for my family.
9417,My 90 year old great uncle didn’t need me.
9418,He went to the hospital and demanded to be vaccinated the first day they had the shots.
9419,They said no.
9420,The second day he also went.
9421,But that was unnecessary.
9422,"Some friends of his are in a nursing home and he would visit and they had his number so they called him and said they had extra vaccines, and he got one."
9423,The hospital had extra shots the next day and called him too.
9424,This is Florida by the way.
9425,I got J&amp;J four days before the pause.
9426,I took the first one offered to me.
9427,I'd get J&amp;J again after the pause if it means not getting covid.
9428,I'd have a much high chance catching covid where I live (county was 12%+ positivity at one point) than suffering any vaccine side effects.
9429,It's a no brainer IMO.
9430,Another round of stimulus checks tied to vaccination status would do us wonders.
9431,Pay people $600 to get vaccinated and I bet we hit 80% easy
9432,I guess it depends on how you read the 18% unsure.
9433,"If they really are all evenly unsure (not really leaning one way or another), without any influence half of them get it and half don't, which would put 29% not getting it and 71% getting it."
9434,"No influence is a myth, but I do think that the new administration has put influencing popular opinion about the vaccine much higher on the priority list than the old one did, and I think there have been tangible results."
9435,"I remember not that long ago talking about 50% unsure about being vaccinated (or something like that, much higher than 18%)."
9436,"\*shrug\* Fine, replace ""vaccinated"" with ""immunized""."
9437,"Point still stands, regardless of whether they got immunized the easy way or the hard way."
9438,"As long as you don’t Republican’ts as people, we might make it."
9439,They’ve made COVID denial one of their party planks.
9440,"What’s next, toilet paper is oppression?"
9441,it's almost as if the US is rotten and evil to it's core!
9442,Thanks NIH!
9443,Are unions really pop up ok places and gonna defend the right to be unvaccinated?
9444,That would be a massive hill to climb esp in white collar professions where unions don’t traditionally exist
9445,Same.
9446,I was in the “wait ‘n’ see” group.
9447,I waited and I’ve seen.
9448,Second shot is at the end of the month!
9449,The USA will always be 50% vaccinated because of Republicans.
9450,[deleted]
9451,Post hoc ergo proptor hoc eh?
9452,It could just as easily dropped because everyone who trusts science has already taken it and only the Q people are left.
9453,At least fans will be back in the UC soon just in time to not go to the playoffs
9454,Nobody is saying that should be our sole focus.
9455,"This is just one of many big factors, yes, but the point is that this particular factor is being completely ignored."
9456,"Cut the international travel, or enforce it **a lot** better, and you'll cut new variants entering the country, or reduce the number of new clusters."
9457,You don't hear about any new clusters in New Zealand...
9458,Tell them to go to the chain pharmacies websites.
9459,"I had a hard time through my state's website (would have had to drive an hour), but found one 5 minutes away at my local Rite Aid."
9460,I did it through Rite Aid's website.
9461,Yeah gotcha makes sense.
9462,"Well hopefully you and your coworkers are vaccinated, it’s the way to safely go back to normal for all of us."
9463,"I understand that point, though, If the vaccine doesn’t prevent covid, and doesn’t prevent transmission what is the actual point of taking it?"
9464,Aren’t mutations still able to occur?
9465,AFAIK isn’t the vaccine only supposed to ease the symptoms when you do catch it?
9466,I am American.
9467,The entire point of insurance is that we all pool the costs to reduce risks.
9468,Everyone's premiums pay for everyone's claims.
9469,Fewer overall claims ==&gt; lower overall premiums.
9470,Or the friction burns a hole through the mask
9471,Much different in the state I’m in but this is news to me so thank you
9472,[removed]
9473,[removed]
9474,The problem is open discussion about the vaccine became political.
9475,There's people who have geniune concerns.
9476,For example many women seem to be having issues with their period after vaccination.
9477,"Yet when this is brought up on a public forum, it's considered anti-vax talk, misinformation, or being anti science."
9478,"People have to understand that many people are just afraid, distrustful, or waiting to see what happens."
9479,There's plenty of valid reasons for people being unsure.
9480,"Yet since it became almost like a religion that you can't ask questions about the  vaccine and mass censorship on social media sites, it actually created the opposite effect."
9481,It gave many people legitimate concern that you can't even show that you're uneasy or uncertain.
9482,Will be interesting when employer provided health plans require vaccination to be eligible for coverage.
9483,"Health insurance companies aren’t interested in paying for preventable 6 figure hospital stays over personal fringe politics, alternative facts and life style choices."
9484,[removed]
9485,No not that much.
9486,Just that now we can say only X amount of people in the store at a time vs just packing the place wall to wall.
9487,You would need to demonstrate that the health and safety of the other employees could not be protected via other accommodations.
9488,"For example, someone could work from home, they could wear a mask, they could get tested frequently, etc."
9489,"Covid caused more than 500,000 deaths in a year."
9490,Maybe yours.
9491,Wouldn't make a difference in mine.
9492,I'm only going to get vaccinated if I need to for travel or a concert or something.
9493,"My risk level is extremely low and society at large decided a long time ago that a minor luxury was worth risking my and my coworkers lives as ""essential workers""."
9494,Been within 6 feet of probably nearly 10 thousand maskless people since covid started
9495,"Btw, my whole family gets the flu shot, regardless of age."
9496,It's a cancer destroying democracy
9497,"
&gt;I also think one roadblock is that a lot of people who have had covid don't see the need."
9498,I fall in that boat.
9499,I had covid a few months back.
9500,"I'm just waiting until everyone's had a chance that wants one, then I'll go."
9501,"But honestly, i don't see the point."
9502,"If natural immunity actually wears off, which we really don't know how long it takes, or if it's lifetime for some people(unlikely), then i don't understand how a vaccine could grant longer or lifetime immunity."
9503,I truly haven't found a compelling study or argument about why a vaccine is better(what mechanisms are at work to make it such) or even necessary after obtaining natural immunity.
9504,"And if it's an annual booster situation, then you can bet your ass I'm waiting a full year from the time i tested positive before i even bother starting a *lifetime* of vaccination boosters."
9505,"Like i said, I'll still get it at some point, i just don't see the point of it right now."

Fucking idiots"
9517,No surprise.
9518,"This is what’s expected, when you ask a company to rush hundreds of millions of vaccines for the good of the world."
9519,I think public health officials don't like publicly acknowledging that natural immunity is real in fear that it'll motivate people to go out and get infected and demotivate them from getting vaccinated.
9520,"Vaccination is cheaper, safer, and faster, so they want to promote that as much as possible."
9521,"Now, will this lie backfire on them?"
9522,Definitely could.

9530,I am pretty sure insurers can't do that.
9531,They can't even take weight or obesity into account which is a much bigger factor in health outcomes than a covid vaccine.
9532,"They can use age, location, and tobacco use and I think that is it."
9533,"&gt;Heck, I almost never get the flu shot because of apathy although I would have been first in line to get the Covid shot if I had been allowed."

9536,It seems to fade a little after the first two months and by the fourth month- still high efficacy but not as high as the immediate eight weeks.
9537,But you're conflating vaccinations with immunity.
9538,There's still a shit ton of people who were never going to get the vaccine who got covid and even still there's tens of thousands of people- the vast majority of whom weren't vaccinated- who get it every day.
9539,That still confers immunity.
9540,RN here I worked at a walk in clinic yesterday- in 5 hours we gave 14 shots.
9541,What a waste.

9558,As soon as they could their daughter made them an appointment and they went.
9559,They weren’t going to put up with the mass vaccine site or anything.
9560,I mean getting a shot right now means signing up for several different waitlists or seeking out areas with expiring dosages/cancellations and following people in the know.
9561,For those that aren’t particularly concerned about it I could see why they wouldn’t put in the effort now if it means that they can get the shot later with much less effort.

9570,But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.

9584,"The problem is, when a large enough portion of the population feels this way, it threatens the population/global health in a pandemic by providing a reservoir of willing people who have no vested interest in curbing transmission."
9585,"And before you know it, we've allowed the strongest variants to mutate into deadlier, more transmissible forms that beat out our vaccines."
9586,"And while it's likely we can reduce/eliminate covid, the issue lies in that if only 50% of people are immunized, this fight will go on a lot longer than it should, and disrupt our lives, and kill others, a lot more than it should."

9615,I think in areas like mine where there is more skepticism overall the J&amp;J issues really killed any further momentum and no folks that were on the fence are just waiting it out.
9616,"Well, depends on what the 20% means."
9617,20% is about what Pfizer reported in 2020 for overall.

9639,"That said, politicization of the virus, and the vaccine, it seems to me, has actually resulted in some areas being more or less prone to vaccinate (thus making cities work more like oc claimed)."

9783,They should probably require the flu shot too.
9784,The biden admin has consistently been announcing easily achievable goals and milestones that we were going to reach anyway so they can pat themselves on the back when they’re achieved.
9785,I am honestly not even sure.
9786,Last I saw they were just releasing a disclaimer that above normal probability of clotting could occur but otherwise it was deemed not significant enough to actually pause the vaccine.
9787,I agree better guidance would be preferred so people can confidently make a decision (and maybe it exists - I just didn't see it).
9788,A local brewery in my town is participating in that.
9789,Unfortunately it is for people who get their 1st shot in May.

9796,What's been proven in the past is that when people are allowed to have a choice about where they spend their money that service providers have to compete to offer the best service in order to remain in business.
9797,"The public sector does not have that incentive, which is why the Canadian health care system is constantly facing supply shortages while the US system isn't, even though the pandemic has hit them harder."
9798,"Granted, the Canadian system is cheaper, but you don't really care about that when you're dying and there's no room at the hospital."
9799,"For profit isn't an across the board solution for every problem, but the public hospital system just sends you home with bilateral pneumonia because they don't have medical capacity."
9800,"That's a problem that can't be fixed, but you can fix the bad for profit entities by using the ones that earn a good reputation in stead of the ones with a bad reputation."
9801,And then what.
9802,We live In a society that wants something for their efforts and I highly doubt that no mask is anywhere in sight.
9803,What is this bullshit?
9804,20% margin is very low for medical
9805,I asked someone else to make the appointment.
9806,Already did the first dose of Pfizer.
9807,No regrets.
9808,Basically the same shit as in Europe.
9809,This decision probably killed tens of thousands of Europeans while perhaps saving 50
9810,LOL
9811,"I coordinate across a few vaccine clinics; three weeks ago, we had 3,000 appointments filled per day at 1 site, and people waiting for space to open up."
9812,"Tomorrow we are hosting a low-barrier clinic, and struggled to get 300 people signed up."
9813,"At a walk-in clinic today, we only had 900 when a few weeks ago we had to turn people away because we were maxed out."

9823,"Getting to covid-zero is possible, but it will require tough choices and even tougher strategies."
9824,We can't get to that point until we solve the quarantine issue.
9825,I agree that the current saber-rattling by Ford is just a big distraction.
9826,We're on the same page.
9827,"I'm thinking bigger: while we take care of the domestic spread (more paid sick days, more shutdowns of factories that generate super-clusters, etc), we also have to brainstorm the traveler issue."

9831,"Because there is demand there, but the places where half the population thinks there's no such things as viruses are given equal priority for distribution."
9832,[removed]
9833,That's 100% what I think we ought to do.
9834,Draft another stimulus package and send a $2000 (or whatever) payment to everyone that is listed as being fully vaccinated (regardless of whether it's the J&amp;J 1 shot or the other 2 shot ones) in their state's immunization information system database.
9835,"I'd imagine that quite a few of the political/fear-based anti-vaxxers are subject to bribery, and by tying it to the states' IIS systems, the fake cardholders should (hopefully) be SOL unless they get it for real."
9836,Those that got theirs early/already will already be listed there and will be rewarded accordingly for having gotten it.
9837,[deleted]
9838,"While I think this is great, more needs to be done to encourage folks to get vaccinated."
9839,Easing or completely dropping restrictions for those vaccinated would encourage a ton of people to step up and get jabbed.
9840,"Yes, we don't know yet because you can only judge long-term immunity based on the people vaccinated the longest, which at this point is about 9 months."
9841,"So far the results look promising, though, with strong presence of SARS-CoV-2 targeting T-cells in lymph nodes, which is where long-term immunity potential can be observed."
9842,"Still, maybe it will end up being a 1-year booster, or it could be 3-5 years."
9843,"If more problematic variants arise, that could push up the booster schedule, of course."
9844,"Not an expert, just a dude on the internet, so grain of salt and all."
9845,"I honestly think if we hit herd immunity, or close enough where we have very low cases, any mutant strain that tries to break through will be noticed earlier."

9855,*
9856,This is a good idea.
9857,A lot of people are wanting a one-dose shot and with Pfizer talking about needing a booster at one year and the johnson and johnson scare those people that were planning on getting 1 shot and being done with it are back to square one.
9858,This should really be addressed at a national level.
9859,What if they did you a local anesthetic with a spray or cream at the injection site?
9860,"Also, some needles are smaller than others."
9861,Maybe someone can call the various locations around you to find the one with the thinnest needle (like the ones used in pre-filled flu shots).
9862,"Currently, they are recommending to get the covid shot by itself."
9863,"Maybe down the road, if we have to get boosters, but right now, that's not recommended."
9864,It’s funny how people like you who were so vocal about “following the science” are now refusing to follow the science.
9865,I really don’t think we’ll get above 50% at most and that’s a stretch.
9866,It’s so stupid.
9867,"There are other completely different vaccines that have a higher number of people vaccinated and no such adverse effect, which is so rare as to have only come up in a few people after millions had gotten it."
9868,And Covid also causes vascular damage.
9869,"They were definitely trying to impose conditions, but India’s government poses far stricter conditions, including ridiculous testing and really impossible price restrictions."
9870,we need to incentivize people to get vaccinated.
9871,We are running out of people who really want to get it and need to convince people to get it.
9872,One thing Ross Perot taught me is that the public can understand math if someone they trust presents it to them with charts and explains it in basic English.
9873,I think the real problem is the hysteria perpetuated by media sources and misinformation from sources like social media.
9874,Putting together persuasive data in an easily understood format isn't difficult.
9875,It's finding someone the public trusts to present it that is the hard part.
9876,"Vaccines do two things, they help reduce (not eliminate) the effect of the virus on an individual and they help reduce the virus that is shed by an individual who is contagious."
9877,Even if children are less susceptible to the effects of the coronavirus (which is itself very debatable.
9878,"There are a lot of long term effects beyond ""did they die or not""), they will still act as spreaders."
9879,This is especially dangerous to people who are more susceptible or who may not be able to be effectively vaccinated.
9880,"By vaccinating kids we can also reduce the amount of virus that they spread, both amongst themselves and to the more vulnerable members of society."
9881,"It hasn't been officially cleared so of course some people, not just antvaxxers are hesitant"
9882,Efficacy isn't determined by the manufacturing scale up part that Pfizer are involved in but by BioNtech's own creation.
9883,I accept that the total supply of BioNtech vaccines could have been lower had a different global pharmaceutical company been involved.
9884,Most people don't seem to double barrel the 2 companies in either order but simply drop BioNtech entirely.
9885,"If dropping 1 company, Pfizer is the logical one to drop since the creator gets the glory, not the manufacturer hence why we call it the Apple iPhone rather than Foxconn phone."
9886,"Yeah, but that’s like every 10 years"
9887,Yes especially the bullies!
9888,Please think of the bullies.
9889,Wondering how often people who decide not to get vaccinated will contract COVID-19 after the inevitable lifting of mandates here in the US.
9890,Will it be that the anti-vaxers simply spread the virus to each other until they all eventually get it or will the amount of vaccinated population be enough to keep spreading pretty well suppressed?
9891,We’ve used the analogy of an invisible shield for vaccines for a long time.
9892,My kids adore the idea that some germ comes at them and they put up their shield and it bounces away harmlessly.
9893,"As my wife and I got our two doses, my boys call the first one the “shield” and the second one the “sword.” I asked about that and they said “the first one protects you, the second one helps you protect others.”"
9894,Same solution different results.
9895,But my solution would actually save lives.
9896,Im so ready for sept/oct when we will get the younger kids.
9897,This isn’t really it.
9898,The BJP wants to take credit for the fix.
9899,"Modi is already calling it a storm, a natural disaster, something unpreventable."
9900,"They want to take full credit for helping India ride it out, not the US or the UN."
9901,[removed]
9902,"Death and hospitalization rates are much higher for covid in adults than the flu is, and (as already stated elsewhere in this thread) the infection rate of children affects that of adults."
9903,"If a vaccine-resistant variant of covid emerged because too many children were getting infected, that would be far worse than the same thing happening with the flu."
9904,Emergency 'crematoriums' (read as open display funeral pyres) going 24/7 outside of the already overwhelmed funeral services.
9905,Safe to say that the official death numbers are pure fantasy.
9906,"Thank u for the info, does anyone know if puking is normal if you don’t have an allergic reaction?"
9907,Got the shot yesterday and I have a fever and chills this morning/puked a lot
9908,This is cool.
9909,"The UK does about half of the world's Covid sequencing, they do all their own positive cases and they do it on behalf of other countries too."
9910,"So having a facility where you can do serology tests of variants against the blood sera of people vaccinated with various vaccines, as well as mix and match (the ongoing trials with AZ, Pfizer, Modera and Novavax combinations), makes a lot of sense."
9911,Assuming the data is shared this will be a very useful global tool.
9912,"I wonder if blood samples from people vaccinated with sputnik, sinopharm etc will be included."
9913,"it is dropping off way too fast... not even close to a plateau, it's falling as fast as it rose in the prior weeks."
9914,This is a huge problem.
9915,You're part of the group that is too weak to accept.
9916,You shouldn't have to take it.
9917,You are why we immunize the Herd.
9918,You're group is not 30% of the Herd.
9919,This absolutely is political as the largest group of unvaccinated people in this country are going to end up being idnetifiable by whether or not they are conservative.
9920,"I’m on Dry May, are you on Dry May?"
9921,&gt; so asking people to put aside their personal needs for the greater good was always going to be a crapshoot.
9922,"Objectively, people weren't even good about that, though."
9923,"sputnik itself should be fine, the problem with the ones in brazil had to do with contamination iirc"
9924,That doesn't mean much without knowing the state.
9925,"If you live in Wyoming, you're over 50% vaccinated!"
9926,Beat me to the reply!
9927,It's a perfectly valid comparison to call it the Apple-Foxconn phone.
9928,Or Panasonic OLED and Sony OLED TVs as Panasonic-LG or Sony-LG.
9929,"I think the following is more accurate:

||Seychelles|Israel||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Population|10000|10000|take as example|
|Vax Rate|62%|55%||
|||||
|Natural Infection Rate %|80%|80%|(depends on R0)|
|Vax Effectiveness %|65%|90%||
|||||
|Confirmed (Vaxed)|1736|440||
|Confirmed (Non-vaxed)|3040|3600||
|||||
|Total Confirmed|4776|4040||
|Immunity|52%|60%||"
9930,Definitely huge majority 1st dose.
9931,"Not sure if there are any confirmed cases after the second dose, let alone the deaths."
9932,"For reported cases it’s like 205 first dose, 4 second dose."
9933,But that’s from the Yellow Card reporting system that’s open to the public.
9934,They may not turn out to be true cases.
9935,When I said equal risk males/females that was based on authorities using a much smaller set of investigated/confirmed cases.
9936,They didn’t say anything about cases from second doses.
9937,"When you give consent for an old doctor to provide your records to a new doctor, you are not simply allowing the new doctor to access the old doctors files."
9938,The old doctor is sharing them!
9939,"You can provide your vaccine status to whomever you like, but you won’t be able to allow random people to pull it for themselves."
9940,[removed]
9941,[deleted]
9942,Set up a vaccination tent next door.
9943,I cross my fingers that that won't be the case.
9944,"If not, maybe look into something like a vaccine finder."
9945,You are not bound to just your doctor or area to get these shots.
9946,I hope you will be ok and this will be over soon.
9947,When I feel frustrated I tell myself that we still have it pretty good.
9948,At least we are not begging for oxygen in India.
9949,That’s kind of how I feel.
9950,We were in Arlington where I think I saw one person inside a store without a mask ever (we don’t go out a lot fwiw).
9951,"Outside doesn’t bother me, I just give people space."
9952,"Inside here it’s like…80%, which is still pretty good, but makes me uncomfortable."
9953,I’m vaxxed but high risk and my wife isn’t vaxxed yet so we are just hanging out at home all the time.
9954,"Yeah, my normally very healthy uncle who lives in Florida got Covid I think last August, and he gave it to his oldest 2 kids (my aunt told me that she had made out with him the day before his test came back positive, and because he r doctor told her that some people just don't get it, she thought she might have been immune lol)."
9955,He ended up with heart problems.
9956,His temperature runs below average now and he might have some thyroid issues.
9957,He also gets so bloated around once a month that he apparently looks pregnant.
9958,The oldest kid (9) now gets so carsick that she can barely do a 2 minute car ride.
9959,"She gets random bouts of nausea that are so bad that she can't do anything.The youngest two kids (4 year old twins) got it in early March this year, and they ended up giving it to my aunt."
9960,"The twins don't seem like they have had any long term effects, but my aunt still has a cough."
9961,Masks help but at the end of the day it's socialisation that's the problem.
9962,That's why really only full proper lockdowns work and half-measures don't.
9963,[deleted]
9964,I got my shots at a Super Wal-mart.
9965,So many people were walking by the pharmacy and saw people waiting for the shot or the 15 min.
9966,wait afterwards and were asking at the desk if they could get it.
9967,"Depending on how busy the front desk was, they were either handing them a print out on how to sign up online or they were making people an appointment for the next day."
9968,That was last week.
9969,Another important thing to note is that Sinopharm isn’t 65% effective until two weeks after the second shot.
9970,"The first shot, as we learned in Chili, almost gives no effectiveness."
9971,Ok
9972,My son did say most of his close friend group is not planning to get the vaccine right now Bc they’ve all had covid already.
9973,So I wonder if colleges mandating it or something else would nudge them.
9974,"They’re not outright opposed to it, they just don’t have a big motivation"
9975,Anyone else not getting the vaccine?
9976,It’s not most though.
9977,Right now in the US you can easily get a vaccine.
9978,If I check near me there’s a lot of appointments.
9979,In that age demographic less than half have the vaccine.
9980,So I would say “most” is fair since more than half are unvaccinated.
9981,Maybe that’ll change coming up soon but the first doses are dropping rapidly.
9982,But what if this results in people getting multiple vaccinations?
9983,"I don't think there's really any way to verify if someone's already been vaccinated, is there?"
9984,Do all vaccine administrators have access to all medical records?
9985,I knew ahead of time and wanted the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.
9986,That's what I got.
9987,You can look at how many doses each company has already shipped and Pfizer is already way ahead of Moderna there.
9988,[removed]
9989,It’s not all about you.
9990,"Hi there, Brazil since March 2021 is my personal example of what you said."
9991,"As more and more people are vaccinated, fewer will be tested and that can drive up the percentage without actually indicating a problem."
9992,"At this point test-positive rate is no longer an appropriate metric, and decisions should be made based on other indicators (hospitalizations, deaths, per-capita cases, etc."
9993,).
9994,"I booked several appointments for people in western PA with relative ease, including Pittsburgh, prior to a few weeks ago."
9995,Experience varies.
9996,"Obviously agree older generations don't have the tech savvy to nab appointments quick, but that's where we can help."
9997,Idk they have signs up everywhere though.
9998,I've asked 3 times and I keep being told I have to wait until the state gives them approval
9999,"It will take longer for numbers to go down in the US than the UK and Israel, because they were on strict lockdowns for most of their rollout."
10000,Whereas as far I can tell most places have been open in the US for a while just with capacity limits and masks.

10037,Assessing risk is difficult because there is an emotional aspect to it on top of the numbers.

10040,It's going to take time for things to normalize.

10046,They could require people to opt in on a centralized database and it would be up to companies what to do about those who did not opt in but said they were vaccinated.
10047,I think with concerts you can be screened when you buy your tickets either online or in person.
10048,An email with ID can be sent with end to end encryption and a digital signature could be required.
10049,Then the ticket itself would have an indicator that the holder is vacinated and verified.
10050,"They could also require waivers so that if someone gets COVID after the concert the venue, bands, promoter, or other concert goers are not liable for any damages."
10051,Their could be severe penalties for fraud I am saying up to 5 years in prison and a hefty fine.

10081,The fact that only 3-5 variants of interest or concern have been identified despite hundreds of millions of unique infections really speaks volumes.

10333,"And since there are so many anti-vaccine parents, it's going to be hard to find enough children to get their parent's permission to get vaccinated in the first place, even though they themselves are very willing to get it."
10334,"Hell, I even know of a Physician's Assistant in my local hospital who is actively telling parents that they don't need to have their children get vaccinated (because ""children are so 'low risk' so they don't need to get it"") so there's that as well."
10335,It's like calling Apple a Chinese company because the products are made there.
10336,"It's normally the creator that gets the credit and prestige of the name so it's the Apple iPhone and BioNtech vaccine, not the Foxconn iPhone and Pfizer vaccine as the supply chain companies aren't the creators."
10337,"Pfizer without BioNtech = no MRNA vaccine

BioNtech with a different global pharmaceutical company = MRNA vaccine"
10338,You do know that there are state registries for all vaccinations?
10339,And hospitals are required to participate in the registry as well.
10340,"Just to give the covid vaccine, you have to report it to your jurisdiction’s vaccine tracker ([CDC requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html))."
10341,The vaccination cards being given today will not be the only source of vaccination.
10342,"And sure, someone could lie but if they spread covid, there may still be contact tracing."
10343,"Honestly, the idea of fake passports sounds like more work than it’s worth."
10344,And that people are setting themselves up for huge criminal and civil issues.
10345,"If you knowingly spread STIs, that’s assault."
10346,"If you lie about your vaccination and spread covid, that may be assault too."
10347,People are dumb but the first time it happens will be a high profile case and hopefully it’ll show that lying wasn’t worth it.
10348,I'm surprised that this surprised anyone.
10349,"People are inherently selfish, full-stop."
10350,"Self-survival above all is codified into our genes, so asking people to put aside their personal needs for the greater good was always going to be a crapshoot."
10351,The data regarding the spread amongst kids in Schools was incredibly flawed.
10352,"Where I live, kid could be exposed, and the department of health would only tell them to get tested if they were symptomatic."
10353,"More kids become symptomatic with the more recent variant, so it just confirms what was obvious to many."
10354,"Our County saw a 72% increase in cases by the end of the following week in which kids switched from hybrid, to full time in person Schooling."
10355,The current variant is only classified as a Variant of Interest rather than Variant of Concern by the WHO.
10356,Unless you mean a future one?
10357,(Not to downplay the situation in India.
10358,Shit sucks.
10359,But to keep it grounded and not unnecessarily sensationalized)
10360,Why should he?
10361,"His primary job is to develop the company, not care about stock market fluctuations."
10362,"But still, yesterday's drop was more of a correction than anything else - the stock simply became too highly valued."
10363,It is still up 50% in a month and 250% in a year.

10370,[removed]
10371,Is there an actual need to report every single death following a vaccination?
10372,Would you like me to make a post every time the NHS yellow card scheme reports a death from heart attack or diarrhoea following the Pfizer jab?
10373,Because there's plenty of those too.
10374,Because once the masks come off there will be outbreaks in schools.
10375,Given how packed schools are they could become rather serous.
10376,"The long term effects on kids is low, but not zero."
10377,[removed]
10378,There’s a 10-25% chance that one will get covid with a “significantly high rate of problems”?
10379,This is news to me.
10380,I thought that number was MUCH lower.
10381,Covid has been in the US for at least 18 months.
10382,In that time smoking has killed 720k people.
10383,And it will continue to kill more and more people in the coming years.
10384,The vaccine is free bro.
10385,Restrictions will be gone for good once we get enough people vaccinated.
10386,The reasoning towards needing as many people as possible get the vaccine is to limit the amount of hosts covid can have.
10387,It will die off if we can limit it enough.
10388,Sounds like you already hit the lottery.
10389,Vaccinate the locals.
10390,"Statistics tell you most people ARE coming back, with a minority varying between like 6 and 20 percent by state not returning."
10391,Long term data has never been a criteria for FDA approval.
10392,The HPV vaccine was approved from 6 months of phase 3 trial data.
10393,It’s probably the same people that loved to be defiant on masks and continue to believe Covid is a joke.
10394,"If a loved one or a friend had a horrible time with Covid or actually died and they still feel this way toward Covid, there’s no saving them."
10395,It’s why I wished Covid would have kicked Trump’s ass but still left him alive so that his supporters would visually see why this thing is nothing to joke about kind of like with Boris Johnson who had an ICU visit.
10396,Trump just riding around the hospital in a car while having Covid and then getting out quickly just emboldened his supporters that this thing was a joke.
10397,Hopefully treatment similar to Tamiflu or something you can get from your doctor comes out soon so that essentially all our bases our covered just like it kind of is for the flu.
10398,I saw a comment recently that college kids may start getting their first doses soon when they finish finals.
10399,Some of them didn't want to get their first shot a month ago when it opened up then get be laid up by the side effects during finals.
10400,"Not sure how many that'll be nationwide, but I'll bet there'll be a chunk."
10401,[deleted]
10402,Thank you for being there for us this whole year.
10403,I can't even imagine how difficult it must have been.
10404,&gt;ssure on states to incentivize the vaccine like how West Virginia has.
10405,"Frustrating to see people not get the vaccine when it’s been available for all

West Virginia haven't rolled out that program at all."
10406,"It's just something that's been mooted, and they appear to be hemming and hawing over the details."
10407,"Unnecessary for safety, and a huge waste of plastic between millions and millions of patients that harms the environment."
10408,Both the CDC and OSHA say gloves are not needed.
10409,"They did, but I would wager that they could have gotten comparable tech from any other number of other firms working on mRNA vaccines."
10410,"Those are firms you haven't heard of, because they don't have the capability to produce at nearly this scale."
10411,The reason the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is so common is that they are good at production and distribution.
10412,"They are going to produce roughly 3x as much as Moderna, who makes the other mRNA vaccine."
10413,"That isn't because of BioNTech, it's because Pfizer is really, really good at what they do."
10414,I see.
10415,I guess you could equate it to being drafted.
10416,The military is not liable if you die unless you can prove negligence like unnecessary friendly fire or an assassination by a rival soldier.
10417,I’m sick of this long term safety argument.
10418,That has never been a criteria for FDA approval of vaccines.
10419,HPV was approved with 6 months of phase III trial data and less than half of the number of participants than Pfizer’s.
10420,This lines up with what is happening in Brazil and even with what is happening in America.
10421,"I know most people say that younger patients are getting sick in the US because all the older ones are vaccinated, and that's definitely a factor, but there could be other factors at play here."
10422,1.
10423,"It does effect them, just not as much as adults."
10424,2.
10425,"To stop community spread
3."
10426,There is evidence that vaccinations are much more effective than prior infection for preventing re-infection.
10427,I'm afraid the fantasy of Covid becoming a newly emerging common cold coronavirus - in so far as that has any basis in science - is being crushed by the vaccines.
10428,The longer gap between jabs benefits the AZ efficacy making extended intervals a double win for nations that use it.
10429,"We need a reality TV show where a bunch of these people agree to hang out unmasked in covid patient rooms all day, and compare what happens to those safe stuck at home."
10430,[removed]
10431,"I know this is an America related thread, but how will other countries tackle this issue once they’ve begun ramping up their vaccinations?"
10432,Europe is full of people who hold more anti-vaxx views than Americans.
10433,French people are the most anti-vaxx people in the world.
10434,What will be the shitshow that happens in those countries?
10435,Vaccines are already required for many jobs.
10436,It’s not a new idea.
10437,And liability implies that they could’ve done something to prevent it.
10438,"Opting out is pretty easy, it happens for medical and religious reasons today."
10439,Some health orgs will let people opt out as a personal choice.
10440,But they then require employees to wear masks throughout flu season.
10441,This isn’t a new concept.
10442,"If not for them so some people got more vigilant, the US could become like India by now...

..."
10443,"Wait, no."
10444,"Biden became the incumbent, almost forgot."
10445,"So no, US would not get as bad anyway."

10449,I'm a Brit and the earliest I've heard of anyone planning to fly to Europe is end of July.
10450,So there's plenty of time for the EU jabbing to catch up :)
10451,"Yes, I have heard some suggest paying everyone who gets vaccinated or allowing them privileges unvaccinated don't get."
10452,&gt;But you can’t ignore the fact that the drop nicely coincides with the announcement of the news.
10453,I don't disagree.
10454,"But that wasn't my point, either."
10455,"The people who don't trust/want the shot will twist the data to fit their belief, no matter what it says."
10456,Let's pretend we know for sure those issues are indeed caused by the vaccine to make it easy.
10457,"The frequency is so rare that the issue is not speed, even if you have a trial with 500,000 people in all likelihood nobody would not run into that problem."
10458,It's an issue of rarity.
10459,Just further proof it would be safer to get the vaccine than not.
10460,"Even if thats the case, I was referring to a possible subsequent covid infection."
10461,So it wouldn't be able to provide evidence that I had covid back in sep-oct you know?
10462,Like I'd have antibodies for a covid infection that happened after that.
10463,"I have been exposed in close proximity to covid positive people, and work with the public so its very likely that I have antibodies for it regardless."
10464,"But you know, this is all just spitballing, I have no evidence to back any of this up."
10465,[removed]
10466,Just means you have a strong immune system and strong immune response.
10467,Probably younger.
10468,I had a mild fever for a day and felt like hell.
10469,It wasn't the vaccine itself -- it was my bodies response to 100mg of a known antigen or whatever
10470,Modi is a huge crook and a failed prime minister.
10471,Vote him out.
10472,"The unvaccinated could spread it among themselves — not you, who smartly got the shot"
10473,Yes.
10474,Nobody cares that you're Canadian dude
10475,Because Pfizer is the larger player in the partnership and also the one in charge of commercialization.
10476,All the other companies have shown what competently managed trials and logistics are really worth.
10477,But of course all your logistics and trial management doesn't help if you do not have the mRNA tech to start with.
10478,"And on that front, Pfizer clearly got a very lucrative technology-transfer jumpstart."
10479,I think employers should require vaccines but there is a problem.
10480,Does that make them liable for anyone who has negative side effects.
10481,But if they can require drug testing vaccines are not a stretch.
10482,The problem is many people (including media portrayal) conflate vac hesitancy with anti-vax.
10483,That implies that people who are hesitant can't be incentivized into getting it...which is incorrect.
10484,We need to start coming up with some good incentives to move the needle.
10485,"I'm not talking about cases or hospitalizations in a vacuum, I'm talking about the relationship between them and why it's changed over time."

10493,We have a 9month old and don’t see it being approved for a while for her age group.
10494,Why would you need to know?
10495,The rule allows you to not wear a mask if you are vaccinated no matter if you are near vaccinated or unvaccinated people outside.
10496,and would it be fair to say government bailout is likely not possible because this is also the primary income of the country?
10497,I just wanted to point out saying it is not as simple as saying it is corrupt government going against the wishes of their citizens.

10503,Yeah because nothing went wrong last time we under estimated a virus.

10507,"That's a national average, so many states will do better than 70%."
10508,The ones that are lower are the ones that never had restrictions in the first place.
10509,3.
10510,The numbers seem to be improving over time.
10511,"When you see millions of people get a vaccine without problems, I think it makes you a little more likely to trust it."
10512,"When it gets full authorization (not just emergency), I think even more people will get it."
10513,"Especially if colleges, employers, etc., require it as soon as it gets full authorization"
10514,I agree.
10515,It doesn't help that the rumor is Chicago will keep a mask mandate in place for the next year or so.
10516,"Not many companies are going to see things are ""fully open"" if a mask mandate is still in place."
10517,If states without a mask mandate don't see a big spike this summer I don't think they'll be able to keep justifying the mandate.
10518,folks is it so hard to just keep your dreams on hold for a year or so?
10519,just until the rest of the world manages to get out of the clutches of this fucking virus?
10520,No vaccine technically prevents infection.
10521,"When epidemiologists say that, they mean, ""vaccines speed up the immune response such that very few people even notice symptoms, and transmission is so low it cannot be measured."""
10522,Suddenly there's a ton of antivaxers with a minimal 10th grade biology education looking for gotchas pretending that this is some revelation.
10523,Your assertion that polio vaccine prevents infection (a reproduction of the virus in your cells) is false.
10524,"Heck, no vaccine has ever triggered a uniform immune response across the population."
10525,That's just not how the immune system works.
10526,"Once we get a firm grounding in biology, maybe we can start talking about the structure of different types of viruses and why some mutate more readily than others and immunity to some lasts longer than immunity to others."
10527,"It's been anecdotal, but I have heard that individuals who previously have had Covid can get rocked pretty hard by the vaccines since you immune system will react quickly since it is already familiar with the virus."
10528,I expect you'll be okay today or at worst tomorrow.

10561,[removed]
10562,Yeah exactly.
10563,The problem is if you tell people they don’t need to wear a mask after being vaccinated how do you separate people who are vaccinated vs not vaccinated.
10564,The people who refuse to get vaccinated are also the ones who think Covid isn’t really and think masks aren’t necessary.
10565,It’s far easier to apply mask mandates if you say everyone needs to wear them.
10566,"Plus, the vaccine is only 90% effective so there is some scientific backup to justify the masks too."
10567,"Vaccines don't take years to approve just so we can wait for long term side effects, it's just the process takes longer when it's not as urgent as it was in the past year."
10568,"It wasn't that corners were cut, it was red tape that was cut."
10569,"These companies applied for authorization and the meetings with the FDA happened as soon as humanly possible, that is rarely the case and that's what made this possible so fast."
10570,"It's not like we usually get these great results with other vaccines and then just sit around and wait to see if they cause cancer years later, that's not what's happening."
10571,So you're wrong to say they take years to approve to study for long term side effects.
10572,It has been stated multiple times that pretty much all vaccine side effects happen within 6 weeks of getting the shot if they do happen (and the FDA definitely required that amount of time go by before any approval could be granted).
10573,"Vaccines don't just cause cancer or make people drop dead two years later, where have you even seen that?"
10574,Which vaccine has caused people to get serious illness years down the line but nothing comes up in the first few months?
10575,How do you know the vaccine doesn't cure cancer?
10576,See you could say anything is possible but usually when people do make assumptions it's based on absolutely nothing.
10577,"No we can't be sure, we also can't be sure it won't give you superpowers and you can't be sure that the bread you got at the store isn't laced with some chemical that will kill you."
10578,"There's always risk but the science says you are very VERY likely going to be just fine and any fear you have is either based on nothing or such a small percentage of cases (like blood clots) that it just makes no sense to fear it (unless of course you fear getting struck by lightning and other very unlikely events, then at least you'd be consistent)."
10579,Over a year and we are only in the bottom of the 6th?
10580,"Come on MLB, you gotta make these games faster."
10581,What else would it be except for the vaccine?
10582,Why are unvaccinated people gathering for church?
10583,It's my understanding that the vaccines are less effective against some of the variants.
10584,That's troubling even if they do provide some coverage against them.
10585,"It's not ""fear peddling"" if it's accurate."
10586,[removed]
10587,"They could also ask China, Russia, or India for their vaccines to manufacture for free as well..."

10590,I had a knee-jerk reaction to your comparison to the flu (lots of disinfo peddlers are comparing covid to the flu in bad faith) but it seems like we agree 100%.
10591,"People don't seem to understand that the vaccine works by establishing herd immunity such that there's only a small chance that ANYONE will be exposed to the virus, vaccinated or not."
10592,"They want to make this an ""every person for themselves"" kind of thing, and they just can't, because our fates are intertwined."
10593,"The vaccine will greatly reduce odds of illness in any *individual* who gets the vaccine, but the only way to actually end the pandemic is to get *enough people vaccinated overall*."
10594,The only point I would disagree with is that we need to bring cases down to 0.
10595,"In theory there can be isolated pockets of infection in parts of the country while the vast majority of us enjoy the protection of herd immunity--like how there are still occasional outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in anti-vax communities, but since the vast majority of the nation is immune, it's not a concern on a national scale (yet)."

10608,"Coronaviruses have been around for decades, hence the -19, which means this version was discovered in 2019."

10612,[removed]
10613,&gt;I'm afraid the fantasy of Covid becoming a newly emerging common cold coronavirus - in so far as that has any basis in science - is being crushed by the vaccines.
10614,"It's obviously not going to be a common cold virus, since it doesn't cause the common cold, but given that there has been more spread worldwide in the last 2 weeks than the first 6 months of this pandemic, we can expect to see some more antigen drift occur and given the worldwide vaccine shortage that doesn't seem to be going anywhere in the coming years, I'm afraid complete eradication or even sustained full control isn't as given as we'd like it to be."

10628,"The Bloomberg article posted by OP says this, which appears to contradict your statement:

&gt; By April 12, 59% of the doses administered were Sinopharm vaccines and the rest were Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made under license in India."
10629,I’m having trouble finding any other information about this.
10630,"Your comment also suggests that 140,000 doses have been given out, but the available data I can find seems to suggest 127,721 as of May 3rd (e.g."
10631,[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Vaccine+doses&amp;Interval=Cumulative&amp;Relative+to+Population=false&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~SYC)).
10632,I'm in india rn and thank you :)
10633,Yah for sure.
10634,And for what it’s worth I’m in Canada so our experience is way different to the US (less deaths &amp; cases but far more lockdown in Ontario).
10635,"Generally speaking people here are just chomping at the bit to go back to normal, and there seems far less hesitancy about the vaccine."
10636,Tough to really answer.
10637,"CDC data is incomplete and based on best guesses, changes each year."
10638,Between 12 and 80k die but around 30m people get sick from the flu each year.
10639,"To contrast that with covid, there are around 30m cases and 600k deaths thus far (again, that’s a really hard number to accurately account for.)"
10640,Maybe a better way to discuss the numbers is just how the hospital “feels.” Every year hospitals plan for a surge in respiratory illnesses in the winter months.
10641,Some pediatric places have whole floors that are only open in the winter.
10642,2017 was a bad year for the flu and hospitals “felt” really strained.
10643,Covid was different for two reasons.
10644,Er volumes dropped to record lows.
10645,Everyone was terrified of getting it so no one came to the er for bullshit (30% of everything in the er is bullshit).
10646,"This, coupled with mandatory stopping of elective procedure, put very quick and dramatic financial strain on hospitals."
10647,Hospitals are businesses and reacted by trying to cut staff and save money.
10648,"Meanwhile, covid decimated the elderly population."
10649,"Early in (March/April) the only people I saw in the er were old, from a nursing home, or very chronically ill."
10650,They all died slow deaths and took up space in the hospital.
10651,The general course of covid was different than say flu or some other pneumonia.
10652,In those cases people die quickly or they get better in a few days.
10653,Covid-19 pts would linger in for a month before finally dying.
10654,"So, the decrease in revenue/staff and the prolonged course of covid led to shifting of nursing staff (they would travel to find new work) and thus hospitals had no rooms."
10655,"When you hear about hospitals being at capacity, it really doesn’t mean they don’t have any physical space, it’s that they don’t have nurses to staff the patients."
10656,"So flu seasons are sorta planned for and feel busy, but are manageable."
10657,Less people die and when they do it’s generally quicker so the hospitals have more beds.
10658,Covid became a financial disaster and a pandemic at the same time.

10714,"Just so you know, you’re in good company."
10715,My kids will stay separated from other kids until they are vaccinated.

10731,It will be a big chunk.
10732,I'm sure some big schools in States like Florida and Texas won't though.
10733,Roughly 70% either are vaccinated or say they're likely to get vaccinated.
10734,But that's country-wide.
10735,"A lot of southern states are dragging down the average, so other states can probably get 75-80%

10751,Are health care systems bursting at the seams in Japan and these other countries?
10752,Hardly anyone is even eligible to get the vaccine yet.
10753,It's so frustrating.
10754,"They were so slow to approve any vaccines here, is part of the issue."
10755,I hope to get vaccinated before next year.
10756,"😅
Getting tested is difficult, too."
10757,Doesn’t that match with the vaccine being used there being only 65% of so effective as they found in the trials?
10758,Seems like the expected result

10760,Why is that a bold claim?
10761,"*shrug* We can be sure COVID will kill X number of human beings and make Y very sick, overwhelming hospitals and destroying the economy."
10762,Take a peek at India if you want something to actually be afraid of.
10763,Trust experts.
10764,Anyone who is vulnerable has had more than enough time to get the vaccine and be protected.
10765,The only kids at camp that won’t have already had the vaccine are the kids!
10766,"Maybe it's not an impenetrable shield, but the vaccines have been found to greatly reduce one's ability to get it and spread it."
10767,"While we can't act like the risk of a vaccinated person catching Covid is zero, the real world data so far shows it's pretty darn close, with the CDC reporting just 9,000 or so breakthrough cases."
10768,"Yeah, you can still catch and spread the disease, but you probably won't."
10769,We've been living our lives normally for  well over the last year anyway
10770,The low risk of death/serious issues in children from Covid-19 infections is *so much* higher than the risks from the vaccine.
10771,I rarely got the flu vaccine until my yearly checkup started providing it.
10772,But I grabbed the first available covid vaccine.
10773,"I had plumbers in and other repairs done in the last few weeks, one company wore masks and the others did not."
10774,"I’m vaccinated, and was the only one home, so it didn’t bother me personally, but it’s probably risky for them to work in close quarters if they’re not vaccinated themselves."
10775,"It’s weird not knowing what to expect in those types of situations now, with all the guidance changing, and everyone having different comfort levels on the issue of masks."
10776,Not mine.
10777,"My bad mental health combined with a lot of coping skills acquired over the years to deal with it, actually did brilliantly."

10780,100% agree.
10781,"My wife has an issue with needles, but luckily she had a really nice nurse and national guard for both of her doses."
10782,Although it's a pretty funny story.
10783,"For our first shot, we both felt barely anything."
10784,"For our second however, we had very different experiences."
10785,I am so happy she chose table 2 instead of table 3 where I was.
10786,"Her national guard guy was friendly, he was asking her all about our life."
10787,"We're renovating our attic, so he asked about that."
10788,"Then the nurse handed her the vaccine card and she was like ""oh, I'm done?"""
10789,My situation was completely different.
10790,"My national guard guy pointed to the questions on a sheet of paper, he didn't even say ""would you answer yes to any of these?"""
10791,"Nope, just a point."
10792,Then when I had a question about one of them he very loudly sighed.
10793,Then he asked for my vaccine card.
10794,"I gave it to him and he looked my dead in the eye and said (this is a direct quote, which was so rediculous that I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget) ""Really?"
10795,"Are you sure you're supposed to be getting your second dose?"""
10796,I was so confused.
10797,"When he handed the card to the nurse, he even was like ""it says the second dose, but I dont know."""
10798,Like seriously??
10799,Why would I lie about getting the first shot?
10800,"If I was one of those people, I doubt I'd get the second shot."
10801,But then the nurse.
10802,She was having a seperate conversation with a nurse who was on break.
10803,"She asked me which arm I wanted, clearly not paying attention since my right sleave was rolled up."
10804,"I told her my right, then sat down, with my right arm facing her."
10805,"She then turned to me and said (again direct quote) ""Sir your sleave needs to be rolled up and facing me."""
10806,Pointing to my left arm.
10807,I responded that I wanted it in my right.
10808,"She sighs and goes ""fine."""
10809,Then no warning jabs my arm.
10810,That shot hurt like hell.
10811,100% would get it again.
10812,"The county sent me a survey afterwards asking about it, and after describing the muscle aches, I made sure to put that even knowing how I would be treated, nothing was gonna stop us from getting the vaccine."
10813,"I'll admit though, most of the pain was probably from me not being ready."
10814,"And on top of that, it was the most momentary thing."
10815,"Like, yeah it hurt, then 5 seconds later it was back to a dull ache."
10816,"The pain of knowing that I could potentially save peoples lives and yet I refuse to do the bare minimum, hurts way more than the shot."
10817,nobody goes out after 22:00?
10818,"fact is that vaccinated people are now allowed to meet each other with any contact restrictions or curfews, while i still have absolutely no idea when i can actually get my shots"
10819,"Ah yes, of course."
10820,I'm assuming the product is actually licensed for production elsewhere.
10821,"To do otherwise (ie, not to license it, upon approval) is madness, as they original producers would still receive royalties or profit from licensed production elsewhere."

10823,Too many idiots out there still for this to be feasible.
10824,Yeah this headline is *garbage*.
10825,Having a flu shot (as long as you are medically able to do so) to travel sounds totally reasonable????
10826,?
10827,I wish the gyms here in NC would institute some type of vaccination pass.
10828,Masks are no big deal to me in most cases but I am tired of struggling to breath when running on the treadmill.
10829,Isn't this a simple thing to solve though.
10830,"The only answer is that you delay other vaccines and get covid shot, they are boosters and it is not like you get to 0 protection immediately if you miss your shot by 4 weeks."
10831,Not being able to get the shots due to covid vaccine is a very valid medical reason so even the rules don't need adjustment.
10832,"I agree, but tying them to a set goal is better than the honor system policy we are trying now nationally."
10833,"""Pretty please guys listen to the science and get your shots, and in the meantime most restrictions are lifted and we aren't enforcing mandates anyway, and you don't need proof of vaccination to do anything, so yeah basically"""
10834,"Yes, but it's also a reminder on how massive the US is:

- US: 328 million
- UK: 66 million
- Germany: 83 million
- France: 67 million
- Italy: 60 million
- Spain: 47 million

All the US countries I just mentioned?"
10835,"323, less than the US still!"
10836,"Could it be that the average COVID hospital patient is younger than before, and therefore staying hospitalized longer?"
10837,"IOW, hospitalization is staying more stubbornly high *because* deaths are dropping?"
10838,I agree.
10839,The Osterholm intentional scare tactic is wrong too.
10840,He owes an apology.
10841,My risk of having a problem with covid is zero.
10842,So try this on for math.
10843,One in six million is greater than zero.
10844,And as if that's the actual averse reaction rate.
10845,There are way more averse reactions other than those stupid J&amp;J blood clot distractions.
10846,"You're leaving out two very large groups, people that have had it and it was nothing and the lazy."
10847,Wow… so it can escape detection via testing?
10848,That means that airline requirements of testing negative is relatively useless.

10901,"It came from those who sought to question the severity of the virus in the name of keeping the economy open or, at a more basic level, appealing to people who just didn’t want to believe it was a major threat."
10902,"&gt;Today, more than half a million U.S. deaths later and with coronavirus cases spiking alarmingly in India despite the advent of vaccines, it’s worth a look back at those who most forcefully suggested this wasn’t truly so bad — and not just suggested as much, but actually predicted it."

10932,Currently covaxin manufacturing capacity is so low that it's useless.
10933,Prob a Q nut job.
10934,Mad respect for the front line workers especially nurses.
10935,They carried the nation on their back thru this pandemic.
10936,"That being said, if a Q nut case can get into congress I'm sure one can pass nursing school."
10937,I am going to guess populist politics.
10938,How about we just stop shutting down business unnecessarily?

10947,My son asked the other day if it was the day for him to get his shot.

10949,"Yes, but the health authoritires have not authorized its domestic usage yet ( they are currently reviewing it. )"
10950,A S. Korean company maufactures Sputnik V as OEM.
10951,The US is already above 50%.
10952,Had a couple electricians come to replace a light fixture this morning.
10953,"They both walked up without masks, and I politely asked if they’d be ok with wearing them inside."
10954,"They claimed that had medical conditions stating they couldn’t wear them and had doctors notes, and asked if it would be a problem."
10955,I told them to not worry about it and I’ll call their office to get other techs to come out.

10958,"Me, too!"
10959,I did know that there was some kind of registry now that I think about it.
10960,But I don't know how accessible it is to entities like airlines and concert promoters and sports teams.
10961,I see an unfortunate slippery slope in giving up so much privacy although I feel that in this case privacy is not a right.
10962,Public safety should be the number one priority.
10963,But it begs the question of how this precedent might be abused in the future to invade the privacy of political rivals even inventing fake acts and attributing those acts to certain individuals.
10964,I think that there are a lot of people with oppositional defiance issues and that politics as it where allows them an outlet for said defiance.
10965,Rather than focusing on public safety and believing that vaccines serve a great service to us they see it as their political rivals trying to control them in a power dynamic.
10966,And they resent experts who have the public trust to advise citizens on best practices.
10967,It makes them feel dumb and out of control.
10968,Many have shown they are willing to lie to get control or to try to and they go all out to not allow their opposition to be truly out for the common good.
10969,The very steps they suggest to save lives and lessen the impact become tools of oppresion and control done out of sadism and to further an agenda.
10970,I went on a rant there I just don't know that there will be a centralized data base that is used to confirm vaccinations one that could be accessed by cleared compliance people from entities where people gather in groups.
10971,I also think that it is hard to put anything past Republicans these days and that someone in the government could end up selling vacination verifications to people for $100 or something.
10972,Or maybe it would be a doctor or other health professional certified to give vaccinations who fake them for a price of for religious reasons but they still want the freedoms of being vaccinated.
10973,"I mean when Biden does that address where he is all masked up, Pelosi has TWO masks, everyone has been vaccinated and yet they are still wearing masks and social distancing... why wouldn't it crater?"

11003,"But if sherpas also collectively said ""no, we wont help anyone"" this year it would have also stopped this."

11006,"If pfizer or moderna approve vaccines for younger children (2-12 range), will you get your kids vaccinated?"
11007,"We’re currently vaccinated, but I’m a little nervous letting my children get the vaccine until it has a bit more history to base a decision on especially given the minimal effect covid has on younger kids."

11011,Now if we can just get the 45% of Republican anti-vaxxers on board...

11013,I think you misunderstand the purpose of this sub.
11014,Unnecessary sensationalization is all its good for.
11015,Give people paid time off to get vaccinated.
11016,Give high school kids a day or two off from school to get vaccinated.

11041,"I tell them it is legal in any outdoor space where you are more than six feet from other people, but because we have narrow sidewalks it's often not possible to stay six feet away from passersby, and that it is considered polite to wear your mask when you are out around town."

11207,Thanks a lot!
11208,I was genuinely asking for clarification.
11209,Don’t know why I’m getting downvoted but whatever.
11210,"somehow the auto moderator deleted your reply - i will paste what i replied for your information: 

meningitis A/B kill only about 100 kids any given year yet we routinely recommend it and it is required in virtually all dorms/colleges."
11211,thats besides the fact that kids can still spread it to other kids and perpetuate a cycle downstream.
11212,ive seen many young fathers/mothers in the hospital that were not able to get the vaccine in time.
11213,"you are correct - it is very rare that young adults and more so kids have a low chance of having anything significant and the chance of hospitalization is around 1%, which is low."
11214,"the bottom line is that they still are a major vector of spread - there were 72,000 cases w/ kids in the last week."
11215,its extremely hard to contact trace when you're in a large community spread situation - the only thing you can do is shut down local schools for a few weeks.
11216,covid vaccination is pretty clearly effective in every single community that its been studied in so far - since the start of vaccination - in adults who have been vaccinated there's only been 76 deaths total - compare that to the hundred thousand or more that have died since january.
11217,my local nursing home has had outbreaks but no symptoms since all the residents are vaccinated.
11218,pediatrics is probably the most boring specialty in medicine thanks to vaccinations.
11219,you typically don't see anything rare or debilitating these days and its because of vaccines - hospitals actually recognize that having a pediatrics floor is just not very lucrative - which is a good thing for kids but a bad thing for making money.
11220,i encourage you to read on the history of vaccinations and just medical advancements in general - you can see that despite the outcries against vaccination we've been able to save so many people not just from deaths but from permanent side effects or disabilities.
11221,rubella doesn't kill people but causes deafness or mental retardation in 90% of kids that were born w/ it - however no one ever knows about it these days or cares why we vaccinate against it.
11222,the more we educate ourselves the more we understand how these diseases work and how we prevent against something like this happening again - unfortunately history likes to repeat itself
11223,"Omg, your post history is *not* compatible with this:

11245,Wearing a mask to walk in and taking it off to eat is pure theater.
11246,"I would of course bring a mask in case there are rules for it or if I stop elsewhere, but I wouldn't stress about it."
11247,[removed]
11248,"I mean, I think you have good intentions but sanctions and embargos would only make things worse for the people of India, not to mention that they are a powerful - and for the most part, truly democratic - ally, a very important combination of factors."
11249,But seriously wtf modi
11250,Honestly this is the best idea I've heard in regards to paying people to get the vaccine.
11251,"This way it's more of a contest instead of a ""bribe"""
11252,The health autorities are currently imposing 20% capacity cap on churches in the Greater Seoul and 30% on those elsewhere ( regardless of vaccination.)
11253,"In S. Korea, the 1st wave was caused by a cult church and the 2nd wave was caused by a conservative church."
11254,The health authorities tried to prohibit church gatherings and recommended online worship services instead.
11255,But some protestant churches were so defiant that the health authorities could't help but allow them to gather at churches with attendance cap.
11256,This post appears to be about vaccines.

11259,*
11260,It’s slowly coming.
11261,Social media has spread that way of thinking.
11262,Anyone not vaccinated is fertile ground for virus variants to mutate from current ones.
11263,What has been true about who gets sick is not what will necessarily be true in the future.
11264,Make no mistake about the arms race we are engaging in here.
11265,Viruses aren't static.
11266,"If the only people left unvaccinated are children, than the virus will select for increased virality among children."
11267,"In talking with an Indian colleague, he said in talking with family back in India, Government bureaucracy is getting in the way of clearing the cargo and getting it where it needs to go."
11268,"My colleague said that Indian bureaucracy is legendary for being slow as molasses and without the very high ups moving things along,  it can take a very long time to do anything."
11269,"He said, sadly he is not surprised the supplies are just sitting in Delhi and hopefully with some press attention,  Prime Minister Modi will apply pressure to get things moving."
11270,"That's new information to me, entirely!"
11271,I'm having difficulty finding any updates on it.
11272,I was still finding reports saying only the 6 cases have been found.
11273,"In my kids school they took away masks during recess and it went from no cases in the month prior (teachers are vaccinated already, who knows about asymptomatic but at least no symptomatic cases) to three cases in a week."
11274,Yeap
11275,Yes ans the majority of the population lives in the middle of the state.
11276,My sisters aren't getting the vaccine due to their doctors telling them that the vaccine could potentially cause fertility issues/issues with their menstrual cycle.
11277,Can someone pass along some verifiable trials/sources that I can pass along to convince them?
11278,I've sent them multiple trials/articles over the past month to no avail.
11279,&gt;In addition what is the incentive for being vaccinated?
11280,Not getting a deadly virus that you can transmit and kill grandma.
11281,And your attitude is why I mentioned people not being willing to do their part.
11282,You could provide a source or evidence for such information.

11287,*
11288,Why stop at 21?
11289,Why not 28?
11290,"You know, just to be sure."
11291,&gt;Since when have vaccines depended on everyone else getting them to work?
11292,Since forever.
11293,"Vaccines don't always work on everyone, they don't always prevented you from getting the disease and spreading it (but typically helps to reduce it) and not everyone can get the vaccine."
11294,That is why herd immunity is important
11295,Exactly why should Target be responsible for paying people $20 to get the shot?
11296,How is this their problem?
11297,The $5 is to sway people who already plan to get the shot to get it at Target instead of somewhere else.
11298,So at what point will people realize well be wearing masks for a long time
11299,"No one is fudging them, I completely believe it."
11300,Maybe you are in the northeast where uptake is good?
11301,I wish everyone I knew would get the vaccine but sadly they would rather believe facebook conspiracies.
11302,Neither of those articles talk about anyone dying after having received the vaccine.
11303,We all know the vaccines don't 100% prevent the possibility of getting COVID-19.
11304,But it does prevent people from dying.
11305,Please source an article of someone dying after having received both doses of one of the vaccines.
11306,"You're completely discounting natural immunity, which is massively under recognised."
11307,[removed]
11308,"I suppose if someone wants to develop and implement (and obtain HIPAA certification) for a permission base access control system allowing a multitude of random event organizers around the country access to the system, and a way to look up each individual person and their corresponding vaccine database, and providing individual permissions for each event organizer, to access individuals data, and interface modules to access all available vaccine databases, I suppose this could be done!"
11309,I will guarantee that this never happen!
11310,Congratulations!
11311,Getting my second one tomorrow.
11312,Also: thank you for your daily vaccination summaries.
11313,The official government bureaucratic approval will change people's minds when seeing when millions of people all over the world have been vaccinated doesn't convince them?
11314,"I don't get it, but I guess you are right for some few people."
11315,I scheduled my mine and my wife’s shot.
11316,Feel like an outlier now.
11317,My dad scheduled his own too.
11318,But yeah I think everyone else I know the wife did.
11319,Every time I look at the milestones it seems they are pulling ahead though.
11320,I really hope that things come together by summer end.
11321,Even having one shot in before school starts would be solid.
11322,"Or, maybe kids are found to only *need* one shot?"
11323,Ohhhhh that is just so unfortunate to hear.
11324,Damn!
11325,I really was rooting for WV back when I was seeing the positive headlines about their efforts.
11326,&gt;I’m not an anti-vaxxer.
11327,"WEEOOO WEEEOOOO ALERT ALERT WEEEOO WEEOOO

&gt;However I am concerned that the covid vaccines have been fast tracked for approval."
11328,This concern is unfounded.
11329,"&gt;Vaccines usually take years to approve 

Correct."
11330,&gt;to study for long term side effects.
11331,Incorrect.
11332,There won't be any.
11333,"Any effects will be seen within the first few months, as there will be nothing left of the vaccine in the body after a week or two."
11334,&gt;How can we be sure there won’t be long term side effects of the corona vaccines?
11335,We are sure that the long term effects of the virus are much *much* worse in every population that we will give the vaccine to.
11336,Period.
11337,"It will be worse for you to get infected than to get the vaccine, guaranteed."

11339,I was at his 400th too!

11342,Love that this is a real subreddit haha
11343,I completely get where you are coming from.
11344,"I have a 1yr old, literally born the day our state first enacted restrictions."
11345,"All of our friends and family with children are not vaccinating, makes it very difficult for my daughter to meet other kids."
11346,"Thankfully she has some wiser grandparents, so she at least gets to interact with people."
11347,Don't let people fool you.
11348,You are being a good parent and sacrificing for your child's greater good.
11349,"Your son will never remember any of this, including the sacrifices you made for him."
11350,But deep down you'll know you made the right choice.
11351,Get the fuck out of here with your bullshit.
11352,The flu is no where near as deadly or transmissible as covid.
11353,"I haven't gotten a flu shot in 10+ years, that being said I got my covid shot the moment I was eligible."
11354,More kids have died of covid in a year in the US than in a regular flu season.
11355,"More kids have been sent to the Hospital due to covid, in a year, than in a regular flu season."
11356,"And that’s mainly with the original covid variant, we know new variants affect younger people more and those will be predominant in the fall."
11357,Do you hate kids or what?
11358,I told my nephews thats its their job ti get their parents sick and drive them crazy.
11359,Work down their cellular structure and prepare them for death.
11360,If a child is a successful child then when their parents die are put in a box and lowered into a grave it should just take a few days to a few weeks and that parent's body should implode into dust like a puff mushroom.
11361,So you dont have to sit there and wonder what stage of decomposition your parent's body is in.
11362,My sister stopped asking my nephews what I tell them when I babysit.
11363,Anyone who tries to dress their cat gets torn to shreds.
11364,Source: am cat owner who only made *that* mistake once.

11366,"It's certainly not the compassionate way to get there, but you're completely right!"
11367,"COVID-19 spreading parties like that, as ill-advised as they may be, would in fact help us along to herd immunity, lol"
11368,Do you think the high number of prior cases is contributing to the low vaccination rate?
11369,I've been seeing a lot of messages/questions from people saying 'if you've already had covid you don't need the vaccine' which is very much false.
11370,But I can't wonder if that's a more common sentiment and lots that tested positive previously have that kindest.
11371,"Once I got two weeks past my second shot I started to only wear a mask where its mandated, so I wouldn't be wearing a mask."

11393,"Then all mitigation measures EXCEPT the requirement to wear a mask when either indoors outside of your home or outdoors and unable to socially distance from others, get lifted."
11394,"By my projection forward of current vaccination levels in PA, we'll hit 70% of the 18+ population with 2 doses in their arms sometime in mid-June, so it's very likely that the mask requirement will outlast the other mitigation measures."
11395,I think the [Death Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone) counts as a comorbidity.

11443,"From that moment on, I was insanely wary of COVID."
11444,I work in retail and of course our exposure is way higher than a person truly working from home in quarantine.
11445,I was blessed to be able to work throughout the entire initial wave of the pandemic.
11446,"But then, came virtual schooling for myself and my son...and COVID anxiety."

11450,Citation needed (definitely not in OP's article).
11451,The FDA can revise EUAs after a health emergency is over.

11472,"Just a few weeks ago we were at a 7-day average of 142,000/day."
11473,So yes: vaccine participation is dropping.
11474,"But that 142,000/day was an abnormally high average, and we've actually been at about 95,000-110,000/day as a 7-day average VERY consistently and going back to the middle of March."
11475,"If we can keep that going--about 98,000/day, the current 7-day average--we'll administer enough doses to hit 70% of the 18+ population with 2 doses each by mid-June."
11476,"We'll see how it plays out, but it's not THAT unrealistic to say we'll get to 70% of adults fully vaccinated."
11477,So you are saying that I should have attended my grandmother's funeral that occured 13 days after my 2nd dose even though full vaccine efficacy doesn't happen until 2 weeks after the 2nd dose?

11486,So basically a research center and data platform for scientists.

11493,The years I was working with people that didn’t have school aged children 5-12.
11494,I didn’t get sick as much.
11495,Their kids would go to the germ factory ( school ) lick every exposed surface and bring it home to spread like locusts.
11496,Question.
11497,I am fully vaxxed and so is everyone in my household.
11498,"I have an indoor bridal shower I'm attending on Saturday, I think it will be about 30-40 people present with most of them vaccinated, but some not."

11500,"One of my friends who is going is saying she probably won't wear a mask, but the people I live with say they'd absolutely wear a mask."
11501,Just curious how everyone else would feel.
11502,"Yes, but I'm worried that there may not be a way to verify that someone isn't lying about being unvaccinated without a central database."
11503,"Currently, I'm sure there are more people lying about being vaccinated than lying about being unvaccinated, but the risk of offering greater incentives to get vaccinated could motivate double dippers."
11504,"I don't imagine the health implications to be severe if you were to get a few extra shots, but all it takes is one mysterious death to create more fear and hesitancy."
11505,"But anyway, if states are keeping their own databases that's something at least, I don't think too many people would cross state lines for a 20 dollar gift card, at least I hope not"

11507,In public too
11508,"I have had posts removed for ""political comments"" when posting my state name and poor vaccination rates."

11511,J&amp;J uses adenoviruses for delivery.
11512,Virus shot it is.
11513,"Many companies voluntarily decided not to run an expedition on Everest this year, yet the government approved a record number of claiming permits."
11514,Which means even more permits went to outfits that were irresponsible enough to run this year in the first place.
11515,"If everyone involved doesn’t come to their senses here very soon, this could end up being one of the most deadly seasons on the mountain."
11516,The US military goes with the envoy to support US personnel.
11517,"Not to mention, making sure the people US send is protected and can quickly leave."
11518,Trials in 1954 to rollout through 1955 and 1956 is different from trials in 2020 rolling out in 2020.
11519,I think that's an entirely fair thing to say?
11520,Less than 6 months from trials to worldwide availability.
11521,That said the technology and testing protocols are miles ahead of the 1950s I have to imagine.
11522,I don’t think there is any real risk involved with your plans.
11523,"But that’s the thing, the US military is the only force that we have that does that, we do not have some backup force of doctors to deploy, I mean we deployed a massive carrier group to Indonesia when they had that huge tsunami in 05."

11532,"Yes, the whole country of Africa."
11533,[removed]
11534,Like how I get down voted for asking a question.
11535,Funny how some of you guys act.
11536,It's hilarious the point I was trying to make was we are going pretty darn good as a country things are looking a lot better.
11537,The notion every is going to get get vaccine is insane.
11538,There are risks in our everyday life.
11539,I understand ppl want to complete eradicate the virus but that's likely not gonna happen in a long time.
11540,"Yeah, I have to believe that the stated plan is September but for obvious reasons the true goal is earlier."
11541,"I work on project management related things in work, and this to me sounds like the standard under promise over deliver tactic."
11542,You’re probably correct about a good number of folks.
11543,I wonder if this is why it makes sense to tie full lifting of all restrictions to % vaccinated.
11544,"It could incentivize people who hate masks at work, for example, just to be done with it all."
11545,&gt;It has been well documented that kids are at exceedingly low risk of serious illness from COVID-19.
11546,"For perspective, the CDC estimates that around 600 children died of influenza in the 2017–18 season; during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu deaths were reported."
11547,"Each year, more than 700 children die from drowning."
11548,"Through the end of April, 277 have died from COVID-19."
11549,"As far as severity goes you dont need to worry about covid on your kids, and your wife shouldn't need to quarantine if she's vaccinated"
11550,"If you don’t know how much releasing IP would help, you could ask the folks with pretty good ideas."

11554,"But that doesn’t seem to be the case.”

Not that I think the US wants to be compared at the shitty level of Russia or China, but they’ve both also given way more vaccines than us."
11555,We were even blocking raw materials until last week.
11556,Had our companies been participating in the CTAP program we could’ve already seen over 100 million extra vaccines.
11557,but muh anecdotes
11558,&gt; we have never sanctioned a base for any of their armed forces anywhere on our soil.

11562,Completely agreed.
11563,I don't know how I'll cope with having to return to commuting and office life.
11564,I'm having a lot of anxiety about that
11565,Sitting on the edge of my seat for mRNA vaccines to be approved for infants 6 months+!
11566,Hopefully it's ahead of schedule and administration starts before November!
11567,Could it be partly because of seasonality?
11568,"My own state (Connecticut) saw huge surges last spring and during the winter, but summer 2020 was positivity rates consistently below 1% and entire days with no covid deaths."
11569,"Michigan's surge happened during cool, late-winter/early-spring weather where people would be gathering indoors more."
11570,"Many viruses spread easier in colder weather, and indoor transmission is significantly higher too."
11571,"South Carolina is getting 70-80^(o)F summer right now, basically ideal weather for keeping people outside."
11572,"A harsh truth that I’ve learned through this pandemic is that in general, nurses don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about."
11573,"They’re worked to the bone, I respect everything that they do, but I trust their opinions far less now than I ever did before."
11574,My kids have been fully virtual since Friday March 13th 2020.
11575,They have not seen their friends and some of their cousins since then either.
11576,"At certain times when our exposure risks aligned, they did see my parents, which would normally be an almost every weekend thing."
11577,My above background is not transitioning to the “we have suffered enough” but rather to paint how seriously we take this.
11578,"Based on the current vaccination rates and case trends, I am fairly confident that our situation will be very good come August / September."
11579,India’s effect on the world is the wildcard that could screw this up.
11580,"If trends continue though, I will feel safe with having my kids go to in person school with masks in the 2021 school year."

11585,I thought it was well known enough that I didn't need to provide a source.
11586,&gt; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that about .008% of the fully vaccinated have become infected and about 1% of them have died.
11587,"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-03/in-rare-cases-even-the-vaccinated-can-get-covid-19-and-die

My point is not that it is common but that it is not 0."
11588,"If we go to great lengths to prevent other rare workplace accidents, then this is in line with workplaces protecting their vaccinated employees by requiring that all employees are vaccinated."
11589,My point is only that a workplace would be justified in requiring the vaccine since unvaccinated people represent a non-0 risk.
11590,What part of what I wrote isnt fact based?
11591,Isn't that what the J&amp;J vaccine is?
11592,"People are idiots if they think that there are potentially worse long term effects from the vaccine than there would be from an actual covid infection, considering the only evidence that there could be any long term negative effects of the vaccine that anyone ever points to is ""we don't know yet"", while there are plenty of accounts of people having lung issues long after a covid infection."

11594,"When foreign aid arrived on April 25, it took our government [7 days](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/foreign-aid-reached-india-centre-days-notify-sop-oxygen-crisis-1798714-2021-05-04) to figure out what to do with it."

11596,"I thought we already had a ""robust infrastructure"" in place to handle the necessary logistics, at least that's what our government said when we [rejected UN's offer of supply chain and logistics help](https://thelogicalindian.com/trending/india-declines-uns-chain-of-offer-27993) a few days ago."
11597,Or maybe the Modi government rejected UN's offer because that would require them to be more transparent about how/where all the foreign aid stuff are being distributed in India.
11598,"Even US journalists are raising questions at the [White press briefings](https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-april-30-2021/):

&gt; We are sending these planeloads of material to India."
11599,"But our journalist in Delhi is reporting that even after trying for two days he’s been unable to find out who is taking away the oxygen concentration, medicines, or how much is arriving."
11600,There’s no website or transparent system where people can apply to get this.
11601,"So this accountability for the U.S. taxpayers’ money being sent, is there anything being done to check on how it is being distributed, the aid that we are sending?"
11602,"Even when the incubation period is longer, in previous waves, the test could detect asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases."
11603,"In this wave, the 3 previous escape cases all had to start symptoms before they could test positive, usually showing symptoms and testing positive on the 14-17th day but could infect others before the 14-17th."
11604,"It does look like the incubation phase is longer (meaning the presymptomatic period, which is still infectious for the previous variants), but the test looks like it needs higher viral load to detect the infection."
11605,"It could be either because of that particular batch against the new variant, or it could be the test probe design itself losing sensitivity against the new variant."
11606,"Extending the quarantine time is the sledge-hammer method to contain the situation asap (which has been working well for China so far), but MoH is investigating the situation with the test probe right now to find out the cause."
11607,You are incorrect.

11610,"Now, this is our responsibility."
11611,We need to talk with our family and friends and help to encourage them to get their shot.
11612,No amount of advertising or famous people will be able to convince them.
11613,"It's on us, their family and friends, to help those who have not been vaccinated."
11614,It may have been a scholastic sheet.
11615,My son had one about germs and he’s in second grade.
11616,Scholastic will do focused sheets on a topic so a vaccine one wouldn’t surprise me.
11617,"I guess fr what I'm reading it has to be decided within 6 months, but I dont think there's a minimum time."
11618,My take- children are at very low risk.
11619,You assumed risk of various things pre covid and didn't think about it like you do now.
11620,"To me, the benefits of in person school far outweigh the small risk of covid in children."
11621,My kids have been back in school since September 2020.
11622,It is what they needed - online learning was not working for them.
11623,"There have been no cases traced to in school spread in our district, even when community transmission was high; in fact, there have been just as many, if not more, cases among the remote students."
11624,Our school system has been great with masking and getting the kids outside as much as they can.
11625,"I will say that we limited a lot of other activities, with the idea of prioritizing their ability to attend school as much as possible."
11626,My expectation is that case rates in our community will be very low by September.
11627,The cases are cratering now due to high vaccination uptake in our area.
11628,I am very confident in sending the kids back full-time in September.
11629,"I am not sure if there will be masking in September, but both of my kids (8 and 10) have had no issues with wearing masks all day if it does come to pass."
11630,But haven't they already accepted significant aid?
11631,Trump's covid performance was indefensible and he paid the price.
11632,"But to be fair, the world renowned prediction experts, IHME, said to expect 60,000 total US covid deaths about the same time the administration was downplaying expectations."
11633,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html

11634,Swedish and German healthcare systems were never overwhelmed despite lighter approaches.
11635,Mind you that Sweden has one of the lowest ICU beds per million people ratio of Western Europe.
11636,"Yes, I learned a lot of stuff in March and January."
11637,That there is next to no correlation between strictness of lockdowns and the amount of dead in given countries and what caused some countries to suffer more than others is not that.
11638,Why is there no data on variants and j&amp;j or non-mRNA vaccines
11639,I'm in the same boat.
11640,At two weeks now after first and need to travel this weekend and won't be available for my second.
11641,"Going to check wallgreens in the area, and now walmarts, to see if I can get my second."
11642,You leave the lights on all day when you aren't home?
11643,I don’t think this is true...
11644,Isn’t this the vaccine Seychelles was mostly using?
11645,And now they’re seeing infections rise even at 60% vaccinated.
11646,Omg lol.
11647,I never liked living here.
11648,But my family moved here when I was 11 from Oregon.
11649,My husband's family is here.
11650,We are so stuck.
11651,But my whole family here is vaccinated and so our my inlaws.
11652,I just dont think they want the kids vaccinated.

11658,Also bioNtech could have found another Pfizer.
11659,"Any reason why I, as a fully vaccinated person, should be cautious about planning a vacation in the early fall that would require air travel within the US?"

11670,"The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in India is tiny, the rate of infections is massive, and the vaccines aren't 100% effective and they get less effective at preventing serious illness if your immune system is a lot weaker than an average healthy individual (as is the case with people nearing the end of their lives)."
11671,"Anecdotes of people who are vaccinated getting COVID and even dying don't give any reason to claim ""Vaccines cause no effect""."

11676,"Not OP, but I think it’s going to be based on the rate of community spread for a lot of people."
11677,"Basically, you need the odds to be high that no student in the classroom is infected."
11678,"Some areas of the US are there right now, some aren’t."
11679,"It also depends if masks/distancing remain in place, because both reduce the risk even more."
11680,ya sure mate
11681,It probably didn’t occur to them that there was any real danger because it’s just a swab and  they didn’t consider the possibility the swabs would be contaminated because who the hell would do that?

11725,Question for you guys.
11726,My wife and I are discussing the possibility of sending our kids back to school in person for the 2021-2022 school year.
11727,"We're both a bit unsure about it, because while we've been fully vaccinated, vaccinations for my children (ages 5-9) won't be approved until later this year, or maybe early next."
11728,"On one hand, COVID severity in children is typically much less than adults."
11729,"Not a guarantee, but few things in life are."
11730,And their teachers will be vaccinated.
11731,"But it's still possible - likely, even - that there will be children attending class in person whose parents have refused to get the vaccine."
11732,"And if they get sick, then what are the chances of it spreading to our kids?"
11733,"I mean, they probably won't get a severe case, but we'd need to quarantine, which is difficult financially, as my wife drives for Amazon as part of our income."
11734,"On the other hand, my children are sick of online schooling, and rightfully so."
11735,My eldest's online teacher is regularly unavailable during the school day and rarely responds to messages.
11736,And my middle child really struggles with online learning - she does so much better in person.
11737,"And my youngest is just ready for Kindergarten, and really needs some in-person instruction to thrive."
11738,"The way we see it, we have three options: back to school in-person, online schooling, or home schooling."
11739,"We're taking a wait-and-see approach, but I could use some input from you guys."
11740,What are your thoughts?
11741,Well now you know about a fantastic deal.
11742,SAY THANK YOU
11743,I don't see how this will get Modi votes.
11744,"If you're fully vaccinated and aren't ultra high risk, there's no COVID-related *medical* reason to wear a mask in any scenario."
11745,"You may still want to wear a mask as a way to encourage the unvaccinated folks in attendance to keep theirs on, but that's a pretty personal decision and also probably depends a lot on why they're not vaccinate and whether getting them to wear masks is even on the table."
11746,"In many states your employer is obligated to give paid time off to get vaccinated, it might apply to him."
11747,"You know that phrase ""prison pipeline""?"
11748,That school sounds like it.

11750,It's going to be outdoors.
11751,Everyone's vaccinated.
11752,"The chance of her having COVID at the time of the wedding and not knowing it, spreading it to other guests in an outdoor setting, and having it evade protection from the vaccines in those other guests is *exceptionally* low."
11753,"If you want to, tell her not to come if she has the sniffles."
11754,I don’t get that all.
11755,I know so many people that went across state lines or volunteered at vaccine centers because it meant they could get jabbed quicker.

11758,Children are about 15% of the population and they are together most of the time.
11759,And they practice social distance and mask wearing like MAGAs.

11766,"""Final total deaths by the end of the pandemic (assuming China-like age-severity profile and health system)""

They simply disregarded local conditions, healthcare capacity, average age completely, and assumed every country, from Zambia to Norway, to be the same."

11768,If I hand something like this to my teacher I would be scolded.
11769,Things are already opened up in the South and nothing has happened.
11770,There isn't going to be a real surge to the point anyone is really going to be concerned with it.

Another guy said: “why would you be scared?"

11855,"So now, the poorer countries that couldn’t afford to risk investing in a vaccine, much more multiple ones, very early in the development are way back in line that they’d only get their turn on 2023-2024, when the richer nations are done hoarding enough for their population many times over."

12104,That variant *could* be resistant to vaccines^but^they^probably^do^work^we^are^just^looking^for^website^clicks
12105,That’s great and thank you.
12106,"I had a fear of needles, because as someone in my 30s getting vaccines in the 90's, all they had were the big needles."
12107,It always hurt.
12108,Having a covid shot relieved my fear of needles.
12109,I don't think I have one anymore.
12110,"Wasco County, Oregon which is a mostly rural county about an hour from Portland."
12111,The health districts here and in the neighboring county have both been working pretty hard at trying to make fun events people want to go to for a vaccine for the past few weeks.
12112,There was a Friday night event at the high school football with pizza and music to get 16-18 year old out.
12113,And a Saturday event at a park with music and free tacos if you got a shot.
12114,"They aren't going to get the anti-vaxxers and people who are really hesitant with these events, but hopefully they can get to a lot of the people who are indifferent."
12115,Can you exactly point out where I am against it?
12116,Haha
12117,Let's push all healthy canadians further down the list ...this group should be the last to get any vaccine.
12118,Same for me today as well!
12119,This.
12120,I know one that is waiting until school finals are over so he doesn't get sick and another that just is yet to coordinate time off work.
12121,There are still a lot of people out there that want a vaccine.
12122,"&gt;That's 5% chance of a symptomatic case, + 5% chance of an asymptomatic case, for a total of 10%."
12123,"I had to deal with risk management at work

You're missing a bunch of crucial things when you're looking at it this way."
12124,"Throughout the entire pandemic, the overall incidence rate of getting covid has been ~30%, the VE is 90% for all infections."
12125,It's also likely that even if you are infected you become less infectious than someone who is unvaccinated and infected due to a lower peak viral load.
12126,So it's fairly reasonable to call VE from person 1-&gt;2 something closer to 94%.
12127,The household attack rate is 16% for non-spouse members of your household.
12128,"Assuming both were somehow vaccinated the whole time, the chances of one vaccinated person getting covid and giving it to someone else in their household throughout the entire pandemic ends up being:

0.3(incidence) * 0.06(VE 1-&gt;2) * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 VE 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.03% chance of household secondary transmission between two vaccinated people throughout the whole pandemic."
12129,"For a one time interaction, you would use your community's current Infection prevalence which is likely below a percent at this point, but let's say it's as high as 2.5%."
12130,"We'll also just keep the same attack rate even though a brief interaction isn't the same as living with someone, just to be pessimistic:

0.025(incidence) * 0.06(VE 1-&gt;2) * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 VE 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.0024% chance of transmission from a one time visit between two vaccinated people in a community with extremely high incidence."
12131,"These numbers are also going to be a bit off, but they are closer than multiplying VE is, and infinitely closer than saying it's a 10% chance somehow."
12132,You're reasonable to be cautious but we got so lucky with these vaccines that they essentially kill almost all risk in most situations.
12133,Then why are you against the posting of the data?
12134,Yeah that's just plain moronic.
12135,We are over a year into this thing and does anyone think this is helping stop the spread of covid?
12136,"This whole ""6 feet apart"" thing isn't a magic bubble."
12137,"If you are on the treadmill pounding away for 30 minutes and breathing hard, the entire room is potentially impacted by this."
12138,"Proceeding to get off the treadmill put on a mask, grab some 35s and walk over to the squat rack, take off the mask and then do your curls, isn't doing a single God Damn thing."
12139,If I were in this gym I absolutely wouldn't put on my mask either.
12140,Maybe you'll forget your charger and need another one?
12141,"We used to joke about slipping our some of our customers a gift card if they'd let us hose them down with soap and water before coming in, and putting some of those plastic cones vets use around their necks, so they couldn't spit on us or bite us."

12155,By the 3rd day she was 100% and felt great.
12156,I'm 2 days past now and feel fine.
12157,Arm is only sore if I touch the area and even then it's very minor.

12229,Are you concerned about the effects on children specifically (safety) from the vaccine?
12230,"I’m just picking your brain, not trying to argue — because if it’s true that covid will always be part of our lives, and assuming we will all need some kind of boosters or yearly vaccination in the future, your child will someday become an adult and likely will receive a covid vaccination at some point in his or her life."

12363,"Yes, and it took us 4 months to get to 100m people fully vaxxed."
12364,Do you really want to fully open up only one month after full availability before we're able to get the rest of the population?
12365,"We also need to focus on getting the younger generation vaccinated to reach herd immunity, and vaccines are still going through trials for them."

12451,"Those with pre-existing conditions may cost insurers more, but under the ACA it is illegal to charge someone more specifically due to a pre-existing condition (unless I am misinterpreting the law's protections)

12484,Places will be open and you'll be allowed to meet people.
12485,Who cares if masks will still be around.
12486,&gt;But I suppose the 'relatively normal' caveat could be that a lot of businesses could still have restrictions on their own volition as well as people still choosing to wear masks and being hesitant.
12487,"The government will always have stronger measures then businesses would willingly enforce themselves, so that won't happen."
12488,"Relatively normal means masks, mass testing and travel restrictions."
12489,"&gt;And that a number of clubs/bars from 2019 that closed won't be able to reopen due to financial issues :(

Its unfortunate, but probably just an acceleration of unstoppable trends."
12490,Simply heartbreaking.

12500,You seriously have no idea what you are talking about.
12501,"India has donated close to 200 million doses of vaccine, it is more that how much US have vaccinated the population."
12502,"(Mods don't let me share the link)

Even if 30 countries produce 20 million vaccine each, that is 600 million extra vaccine for people to have access to."
12503,The world population is 8 billions and we need at least 10 billion doses just this year before the next strain becomes immune to it.
12504,So time is everything and massive increase of production is the only way we can fight this globally.
12505,Unless we are willing to sacrifice the poor nations today and pay the price of it tomorrow.
12506,This is me after my first dose today.

12520,BioNTech got $445 million from the German government in September to build out manufacturing and development.
12521,"If they want to turn down that kind of money during the next pandemic, perhaps the competition will take it."
12522,The problem is that the government has to find ways to encourage people to vaccinate.
12523,It may not be practical but if it helps to encourage people to vaccinate then it’s a good thing.
12524,"Shows how bad the US has handled it when it's never been lower than that, especially considering how high testing rates were."
12525,why should we still be wearing masks in the fall if most people are vaccinated?

12567,"Source: I'm infected, and I'm at home praying my situation doesn't get worse, because there's so space left in hospitals everywhere."
12568,"My second Pfizer shot have me a 102° temp for two days and tons of aches, headaches, nerve pain, etc."
12569,Lite symptoms of the virus.
12570,I will get boosters as recommended but going through that again for a baseball game?!
12571,Nah.
12572,Well it's their fault for not getting vaccinated at this point.
12573,It's been open for vaccination for a while for everyone.
12574,I do want to mention that Mississippi has historically had some of the best rates in the country for childhood vaccinations.

12584,"I'm not talking about wearing them at work, or outside, or even in stores, but like, public transit?"
12585,"Yes, I wish people wore them."
12586,There's nothing worse than sitting on the train with some fucker hacking a few rows away from you KNOWING you're going to get sick now.

12627,Isn't it a great feeling?
12628,I think it hit me when I was in the grocery store and saw someone with their mask around their nose and I realized that it didn't give me anxiety anymore.
12629,And companies like Pfizer may not be as quick to invest their own capital next time there is a pandemic.
12630,I’m also in college and that’s exactly what it is.

12670,That's perfectly okay.
12671,People seem to have no idea why covid is scary to the healthcare system.
12672,The issue isn't that people can get covid at all; the issue is that enough people can get severe enough cases that the healthcare system can't handle it.

12716,They are concerned about side effects and are putting it off until summer when they have a lighter schedule at work/school in case they don't feel well.
12717,Doctors in my area are advising people wait 90 days after recovering from COVID to receive the vaccine (I realize this is no longer the CDC recommendation) and many are waiting for their 90 days to be up.
12718,Yeah that for sure sucks.
12719,I don't care about the others though at this point.
12720,Yes!
12721,This whole thing about an escape variant is a little overblown.

12804,It's difficult to focus on treating patients at the peak of a pandemic and vaccinating such a large portion of the population.
12805,They need to get things under control somewhat and then mass vaccinations will be a lot easier.

12815,I am Indian.
12816,"This will hurt more than help in the long term
 India is the worlds biggest vaccine manufacturer but it does it for off patent vaccines
 We don't develop new vaccines because of lax patent protection."
12817,"We entirely depend on US innovation here to make vaccines and medicines available to the rest of the world


If we get mRNA vaccines blueprint it makes zero difference as we don't have mRNA capability in India."
12818,"And also zero storage capacity for -20 degree vaccines


What we need is more J&amp;J and similar one shot vaccines that the US is not willing to take due to vaccine hesitancy."
12819,This is just more virtue signalling.
12820,This is unequivocally a good decision.
12821,Uncontrolled spread in other countries will render the current generation of vaccines ineffective far more quickly if we don’t scale up global vaccinations.

12914,"It actually says only 20% fully vaccinated for what you described, 75% with the first dose."
12915,"If it was 75% fully I'm sure it would allow a lot more, if not everything."
12916,Lol there's vaccines from other countries
12917,[removed]
12918,Really what's bout operation warp speed
12919,yeah because then everyone will see that all the materials we send are used for the ultra rich while everyone else dies.
12920,"fuck the Indian government, they could all die today and the government response would probably be better and less people would die."
12921,the government wouldn't be able to steal everything
12922,"Naw, he’s already double dosed with phizer."
12923,"They would be better off, except for the fact that they're naxal dispute regions, which means there's basically no medical infrastructure there (since any attempt to send medical aid simply fails, so the government has stopped trying)"
12924,"Well, worldwide it's not just white people."
12925,There are climbing teams and climbing communities in any country with mountains to climb.
12926,Do those communities have the expendable income to do everest?
12927,"Maybe not as often as the people in the us, canada, switzerland."
12928,"In the US, as to why it's a white people sport, I think this also partially comes down to expendable income and partially just culture."
12929,"It's kind of a self fulfilling prophecy, if you don't know anyone that's into climbing, you probably aren't going to just pick it up."
12930,"Yeah lol I know so many people (including myself) who are like ""yeah I'll get it sometime over the summer but I'm way too busy with finals rn to get it this second."""
12931,Framing it as an anti-vax issue and not an indifference one is bad messaging

12935,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
12936,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

12941,1. the report is unverified.
12942,2. the Pfizer vaccine is only approved for those 16 or older.
12943,3.
12944,"It was reported on VAERS, which also shows vaccinations lead to hip surgeries, which doesn't even make sense."
12945,"Those people who have stopped giving a fuck, and who refuse vaccination too... they need to know I and many like me who are vaccinated, have also stopped giving a fuck about them."
12946,They’re on their own.
12947,Didn't the government step in and find the research
12948,I can’t help but be concerned about this India variant that is now wrecking Nepal.
12949,If that variant spreads through the US we would be in a completely different spot.
12950,What an absolute gong show their government is running over there.
12951,People are dying and they're being offered help.
12952,People really just like getting upset at every possible opportunity.
12953,I guess OP is still feeling salty because he hasn't gotten his first dose yet; but at the same time everyone over 18 is at most 3 weeks away from being eligible.
12954,People need to chill a bit.
12955,Absolutely.
12956,Pharmacies here are handing out the shot to walk-ins on a daily basis even now.
12957,Theyre not going to turn you or anyone away.
12958,"I do think the viral vector vaccines stop some spread, which would slow mutations."
12959,I personally think people get too worked up over mutations.
12960,Mutations usually go in the direction of being less deadly so people keep walking around spreading them.
12961,"So far, all mutations are neutralized by the mrna vaccine."
12962,"That likely won't be true forever, but it could likely be true for years."
12963,The virus has been spreading worldwide for over a year with a huge number of fresh victims in the human and animal kingdom and hasn't altered in a significant enough way yet.
12964,I have an anti-mask friend who regularly is stopped stores and asked to wear a mask.
12965,"She says “no mask today, thanks,” and walks on."
12966,No store pursues it further except the Container Store.
12967,Probably being shunted off to the rich while leaving the poor to suffocate and die outside of the hospitals they've gone to for help.
12968,Just disgusting.
12969,"Yeah, what I'm ""afraid of"" is that you would have to show proof of full vaccination to enter those places, which is something I wouldnt have unless I get the J&amp;J as soon as I get there."
12970,My home state just set a goal of 50%.
12971,So we'll need 90% from an equal-sized state to get back on track!
12972,Or 80% from a state twice as large!
12973,Check cvs easy to see availability.
12974,You can filter by rapid or pcr.
12975,PCR took me two days to get results but can take up to five days I beleive.
12976,Rapid they call you like half hour after.
12977,From my experience rapid is harder to find and usually you can only find for 2-3 days after the current day and pcr you can find the next day usually.
12978,&gt;Why not accept the help when it’s from an actual ally to your nation who can actually help?
12979,"this question can be answered by yourself if you consider the ""extremely stupid and impossible scenario""."
12980,"imagine it is true, and go though the emotions of whether you would allow the Chinese military on your ground."
12981,"once you understand what that feels like, only then would you understand the concern from an Indian perspective."
12982,"if you choose to dismiss that hypothetical scenario out of hand without opening your mind to it for even one second, even the most eloquent reply will not he enough to answer the above quoted question."
12983,"Alright, so we'll just wait over here until a significant mutation, and it becomes a world problem again."
12984,Sounds good... /s
12985,No.
12986,The vaccine works even if you don't get symptoms.

12989,The basic reproduction number (R0) is used to quantify the infectivity of a virus.
12990,"This value is the expected amount of infections that are generated by a single case of infection from a virus in a given population, assuming that everyone is susceptible to infection or are immunity-naïve."
12991,This also considers the absence of non-pharmaceutical intervention methods.
12992,"As such, this number doesn't change as an outbreak progresses, and represents an exponential growth rate."
12993,"Alternatively, the effective reproduction number (Rt) is time-variable, and this is the value that you regularly see being revised in the news."
12994,"This number considers a level of immunity already present within a population, in addition to intervention methods that are responsible for reducing the transmission rate."
12995,"When this value drops below 1, herd immunity has been achieved and the number of cases will gradually decrease until no infections are present within a population."
12996,"For comparison, SARS-COV-2 has an R0 value of around 2.4 to 3.4, whereas influenza is estimated at 1.2 to 1.4."
12997,"Although these values appear similar, you need to remember that this value is the exponential growth rate of viral transmissibility, so SARS-COV-2 is actually considerably more infectious."
12998,"Measles, mumps, and rubella have an R0 value of 12 to 18, 10 to 12, and 6 to 7, respectively."
12999,"I don't know much about the norovirus, [but I found a research article that suggests that the R0 value for norovirus ranges from 1.1 to 7.2, with a value of 2 for population-based estimates, and increases depending on particular outbreaks."

13009,[https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html) It's likely more effective than you're picturing.
13010,"If people are worried about others walking around unvaccinated, they should get a vaccine."
13011,Being vaccinated and unmasked even around people who are unvaccinated and unmasked is a hell of a lot safer than being masked and unvaccinated like we all were 6 months ago.
13012,"Got my second dose yesterday, and...no side effects!"

13023,I was so happy to be vaccinated I would have paid them.
13024,These people could get sick and die or be disabled while hemming and hawing and procrastinating.
13025,No reason to be jealous.
13026,My guess is that if they end up giving stimulus they make it retroactive to anyone who's gotten it.
13027,"Shoot, I'd pay out of my own pocket to get friends vaccinated who don't want to be and give them the biggest pat on the back in existence."

13030,I'm in a peculiar situation so I'm not sure anyone here can really answer.
13031,I'm in the US but I got the AstraZeneca vaccine (Trial participant).
13032,"I was wondering, if/once places start requiring proof of vaccinations, will I encounter issues?"
13033,I don't have a CDC card like everyone else but I do have a letter from SF department of health stating that what I got was the real vaccine.
13034,"I don't really expect anyone to have an answer as it's all speculation, but was curious what others thought."
13035,“Traveler”?
13036,China has not been accepting anyone except for foreign workers for over a year.
13037,"Even then the process is lengthy, expensive, and hinges on many factors beyond the applicants’ control (e.g., flight licenses being suspended for two/four weeks depending on whether the previous flights brought any corona-positive passengers in)."
13038,"If you’ve been vaccinated with a Chinese-made vaccine the visa application process for new hires is slightly less onerous, but good luck getting that anywhere in the West."
13039,Is this how slow science can(!)
13040,work?

13047,The rate of spread was going to be highly dependent on non-pharmaceutical interventions like mask wearing requirements and lockdowns.
13048,Most studies produced a range of possible results that varied by multiple orders of magnitude depending on the degree and duration of NPIs.
13049,2-3 million was probably used as an upper limit to show what would happen with little or no NPIs.
13050,That's basically a 0.5-1% IFR assuming the entire population is infected which is pretty reasonable if we made no efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19.
13051,"&gt;but India is a major ally to the US

starting a separate thread on this, India is most definitely not a major ally from the US perspective."
13052,India never has been.
13053,"from the time of the bloody partition of the country when Truman and Churchill wanted to build a geographical foothold against the Soviets (with whom India had a closer relationship in the late '40s), to the Nixon era when Kissinger was abusive of the Indian government, to the constant arms sales to Pakistan that continue to this day and which fosters a cold war that neither nation here in South Asia needs, the US has never aligned with India."

13079,"And again if indonisea managed to get a lot of helpe form us during the Tsunami with no issues after, you could be assured the same for India, it’s a major ally, especially against China."
13080,Why not accept the help when it’s from an actual ally to your nation who can actually help?
13081,Those countries paid for those Russian vaccines.
13082,They paid with money.
13083,Some paid more than European nations.
13084,"You should give a shit about Russia, they have not been doing well in the vaccine diplomacy game, but you are using them as an example of what other countries should be doing."
13085,Pretty much.
13086,"Though the viral vector vaccines save lives, they don’t seem to stop the virus from spreading and mutating."
13087,The mRNA vaccines however appear actually to stop infections and spread of the virus.
13088,They could do it at schools.
13089,I believe thats how we used to do vaccines.
13090,"Priority queue is understandable, that's why the FDA Approval process has the fast track / breakthrough therapy / accelerated approval / priority review designations."
13091,"But the Emergency Use Authorization process significantly differs from the regular approval process, it requires less data, the criteria are loosened, the reviews are less rigorous, yet we're told by people who's expertise I have no reason to doubt that these vaccines are not less safe than any other."
13092,So demand alone does not explain why the cumbersome process of approval exists as it does to begin with if we could achieve the same results safety-concern-wise with a way less bloated process.

13107,"She was really mad because she says it basically forces her daughter to get a vaccine and...""risk her fertility""... or be singled out."
13108,People want choice without consequences and that's never been possible.
13109,I sort of sympathize though.
13110,I really want to live in a world where it is socially acceptable to not want to be touched while greeting random people.
13111,Or even better - a society where respecting personal space is a hard default and physical contact is universally opt-in.
13112,I hope that stuff continues.

13114,Thank you for the explanation.
13115,"I could hardly believe the massive jump in daily new cases, but that makes sense now."
13116,I am all for the US releasing the blockade on supplies.
13117,I find it unrealistic that releasing IPs will help.
13118,"It would certainly increase capacity by a few hundred million for low income nations, but the actual big pharma companies would scale back their own capacity increase plans."
13119,It may just lead to redistribution of vaccines.
13120,India is the perfect example.
13121,Their government has been extremely strict with pricing and testing and it is why Covaxin is barely being produced.

13136,Sporting events and restaurants still require masks and capacity limits.
13137,That’ll definitely change.
13138,By June I foresee the situation being dramatically improved and all the lasting restrictions will be over by mid summer IMO.
13139,I assure you 1-3% of kids do not get hospitalized lmao.
13140,More like .1% and probably lower.
13141,It says 100% capacity.
13142,"&gt;New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced in a May 5 press conference that Broadway shows, after being shut down for over a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, would reopen at 100 percent capacity beginning September 14."
13143,He added that tickets would go on sale beginning May 6.
13144,Can anyone link me to research regarding risks of mRNA vaccine delivery?
13145,My friend is hesitant to get the vaccine after listening to some podcast by Bret Weinstein and I'd like to point to research about the newer delivery method (specifically long term risks due to the use of lipid nanoparticles).
13146,So we are going to let loose a lot of bees in malls etc and let them chase Covid patients out of the public?
13147,Sounds like a dangerous game.
13148,Please put a legitimate source with how many vaccines Russia has donated.
13149,I’ve tried looking.
13150,I have found no sources saying they’ve donated much of anything.
13151,"What they have done is made deals with many low income nations, but they haven’t really made any donations outside of nations that have agreed to have their live staff vaccinated as tests before phase 3 data is approved, about three countries."
13152,That’s a dumb and ignorant question to ask.
13153,Lifting IP and blocking supplies are two entirely separate issues.
13154,The US has only just released the blockade on supplies.
13155,And if you’re going to question how millions of extra vaccines would help....
13156,If 70% of adults are vaccinated you can have a single digit number of friends over with social distancing to celebrate the 4th!
13157,I know people who had it and were asymptotic and therefore reject the vaccine.
13158,"Yeah, that's enough steps away that anyone can be bullshitting."
13159,I'm not saying it doesn't happen - bells palsy absolutely occurs.
13160,2 people given JnJ and 2 people given placebo in the trial of 4000 people.
13161,So i mean... Yeah.
13162,"People suck, in general, at thinking a temporally correlated event is causation."
13163,"Reality is, it's likely not that much more common from a vaccine than daily life."
13164,But we can still acknowledge any inflammation event may potentially increase the risk from extremely rare to slightly less extremely rare.
13165,"As another user has said, the US military is has the best world logistics out of anything."
13166,We can get a rapid response team to an area in less then 12 hours.
13167,"Too allies it’s not a poison challace, India simply has a lot of ppl that need help which is obviously break your healthcare system, with a budget like the US military which is 700bil dollar, the highest budget in the world."
13168,That is why we don’t have other types of orgs to rabid respond to issues.
13169,"That is what our military is used for, on top of being a war fighting force, it’s a rapid response to disasters."
13170,"&gt;as far as I know

Lol first thing in the video shows you’re dead wrong."
13171,"I have to ask, with so many people saying the vaccine production could be massively produced, why ignore them?"
13172,Its only a matter of time before we start to hear about triple-double mutants!
13173,;)
13174,"Really, wow."
13175,I hope the USA can get there.
13176,I think we'll need adolescents to do it.

13212,Imagine if after all those years she drops down to Covid because the government didn't take care of the pandemic.

13220,Every time I've been in the store since I got vaxxed a month or so ago I've seen people with no masks.
13221,I'd say about 95% are compliant (although even some of them have exposed noses) but nothing is said about it to those who aren't.
13222,Here in the US people have been shot and killed for asking people to wear a mask.
13223,No one wants that so people say nothing.

13231,"The Us military though just has one of the best logistics in the world, hell we can deploy a rapid response unit to a zone in less then 12 hours, anywhere around the world,  we wouldn’t accept it because we don’t need it, but India is a major ally to the US, this is just a pride thing if you ask me."

13233,I like Tom Wolf's approach to how to handle the mask mandate.
13234,"I may be in NJ, but I think his announcement of dropping mask mandates when 70% of the adults are vaccinated makes a lot more sense IMO than just keeping it."
13235,It's almost enough to make me wonder if maybe Biden's July 4th plan for people to get to 70% will be for an erasure of this policy.
13236,That would be awesome if it happened.

13239,Having all that  back would be great.
13240,Agreed.
13241,I also haven’t looked very deeply into the history of vaccines in general but I think there isn’t much of a history of them “turning” on you and causing something horrible.
13242,I also wouldn’t bother to look at the ingredients of the vaccine because I probably wouldn’t understand what the heck I’m reading.

13279,That’s the rule.
13280,A doctors note has to be provided upon request.
13281,"No specific medical issue needed on the note, but just the doctor saying they can’t be vaccinated “for medical reasons.”  Which ends up being the tricky aspect, because some doctors are like that."
13282,"&gt; With the support of industrial structures destined to the manufacture of products of veterinary use, Brazil will be able to gain more than 200 million vaccines against Covid-19 per month."
13283,"In an interview to CNN, Senator Wellington Fagundes (PL-MT), author of the project that will allow the development, spoke about the production capacity of three factories that have maximum security level, adequate to the development of the immunizers."
13284,"&gt; ""These three industries have the capacity to produce every 35 days a batch of approximately 80 million vaccines."
13285,"Every 35 days, the three laboratories could produce more than 200 million vaccines,"" he stressed."
13286,"&gt; According to the National Union of the Animal Health Products Industry (Sindan), the vaccine plants for veterinary use installed in Brazil, regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, have a high level of security, three of them with maximum biosafety level (NB4)."
13287,&gt; The senator highlighted the safety of the spaces and the need to expand the production of the vaccines against Covid-19 to serve the Brazilian population in the short and long term.
13288,"""For over 20 years, we have produced vaccines from inactivated virus, and we have never had a virus escape, we have never had any problem."
13289,"Today, the security of these companies is total, besides the great production capacity"", said Fagundes."
13290,"&gt; According to the senator, are already in negotiation with the Ministry of Health and the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) the guidelines to put into practice the action."
13291,"""At a meeting, the Ministry of Health guaranteed that would buy the entire vaccine produced."
13292,Anvisa is already in talks with three laboratories for this transfer of technology.
13293,"We have 100% of the technology to produce the API [Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient],"" he said."
13294,"&gt; The Health Minister, Marcelo Queiroga, even said at a press conference that the measure would help to increase the capacity for vaccination and distribution of vaccines."
13295,The minister said that is under analysis with health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) the suitability of animal vaccine industries for the production of immunizers for humans.
13296,"&gt; About the project
&gt; Bill 1.343/2021, authored by Senator Wellington Fagundes (PL-MT), was presented to the Senate on April 12."
13297,"It authorizes, temporarily, the production of vaccines against Covid-19 by factories for veterinary use that meet the sanitary standards and biosafety requirements of their own, such as those of laboratories that produce the immunizers used in humans."
13298,"&gt; The bill, approved in the Senate, will still need to pass through the approval of the House to proceed to sanction by the President of the Republic, Jair Bolsonaro."
13299,It’s a bit different.
13300,"With smoking, you’re being discounted if you _don’t_ do something."
13301,"With vaccinations, you have to _do_ something, and it is as intrusive as it gets"
13302,Too bad he didn't follow through on his promise to make sure the vaccine wasn't intellectual property.
13303,"So, even if we get everyone vaccinated, it'll still affect poor countries, mutate, and come back forever."
13304,"Likely this is to benefit the pharma companies, who are living large on government money now, and will happily charge us for our yearly vaccinations as COVID becomes a normal part of life thanks to their cooperation with the US government to ensure that."
13305,"I mean, it will continue to literally be a pandemic if enough people keep dying."
13306,Politicians and scientists are not going to call off the pandemic if anti-vaxxers are dying en masse.
13307,They're responsible for their lives too.
13308,All of the vaccine companies other than AZ are working on this
13309,not really.... if you do get them it'll be several hours from now.
13310,Some don't experience it until after they wake up the next day.
13311,"fwiw the nurse who was giving my shot said that only 1/4 seem to experience symptoms other than localized arm pain, and more women than men."
13312,"That is completely wrong, illegal, and unethical- if the vaccine site realizes you did that (and they might, since your kid’s birthday won’t match what is in the state system) they would be well within their rights to report you to CPS for endangering your child."
13313,"Jesus, imagine thinking you know better than the FDA and CDC and *lying to healthcare professionals* instead of waiting a week or two for approval."

13321,They claim to have had less than 100 cases per day since March 6th *2020*.
13322,In a country of 1.4 billion.
13323,It's so obviously bullshit.
13324,I'm not confident we will.
13325,I am vaccinating at walmart.
13326,We were scheduled to do 70 doses yesterday.
13327,We barely got to 10.
13328,We are at the point we are begging people to take it so we don't have waste.
13329,I've got 500 doses of moderna and no arms to put it into.
13330,Or move to Georgia where we never had a mask mandate.
13331,"&gt;Someone needs to explain to me why all other companies and individuals can charge for the work they do, but if pharmaceutical companies ask to be compensated for the work that they do, they're ""evil ghouls""."
13332,There's a nuanced argument to make that can be summed up simply: other companies and individuals don't hold such a direct grip over the life and death of countless people.
13333,If the company that holds the patent for a fancy smartphone gets greedy and decides to increase their prices five-fold then their sale will drop and life will go on more or less as usual.
13334,If the company that holds the patent for a life-saving medication gets greedy and decides to increase their prices five-fold **people who can't afford to pay the new price will die**.
13335,"At some point you have to balance the right of pharmaceutical companies to be compensated for the work they do with the right of people to live even if they are poor, and money and lives will be lost regardless of where you draw the line."
13336,More reliance on government funding would bring its own set of problems.
13337,"Governments wouldn't be inclined to fund anything that doesn't draw a lot of public interest, and once they do have a solution funded, wouldn't be inclined to look for alternatives even if better options may be out there."
13338,"And then there are potential issues with favoritism, corruption, etc., with companies getting funding who don't need or deserve it."
13339,Yep!
13340,"And as soon as my 9 month old can get it, I'll vaccinate her."
13341,Scientists are assessing the risks to kids in these age groups.
13342,I trust the science.
13343,Pfizer literally ran the clinical research trials.
13344,Doesn't matter if you get it through vaccines or through natural infection.
13345,"As long as everyone can get a vaccine if they want one, open the flood gates."
13346,I want to know too.
13347,"Wondering the same as I had my 2nd shot 2 weeks ago, happy to get a booster"
13348,Yea the article says they’re in the process of tweaking theirs too
13349,Just got my first Pfizer dose 30 minutes ago.
13350,Am I in the clear for the severe side effects?
13351,They still tend to get shit done when they need to.
13352,They suppressed the pandemic fairly well for example.
13353,Maybe they'll ease up once you guys actually get there.
13354,"Locally we have had pretty decent pharmacy access for a while, so I am not sure if it will matter much here, but what WILL matter is that, when our mass vax sites close, we might see a tilt back, where people who were ""Wait and see"" suddenly change their mind and want appointments but suddenly they are more scarce."
13355,Fun times to be working in public health :)
13356,This sums it up nicely.
13357,Everything we know and expect of how a pathogen may mutate becomes less relevant as we give it more chances than what is usually accounted for
13358,Why Germany?
13359,enough people probably won't get vaccinated.
13360,"there are some things that op can do that are safer though, like visiting other vaccinated friends."
13361,All masking must go before we're normal.
13362,Lmao the middle east is in Asia
13363,"Ah, okay."

13367,idk why you’re being downvoted because you’re right.
13368,Pfizer did not do any research.
13369,The government offset 100% of the risk in manufacturing.
13370,"We also know that for a good portion of this group, this may be the first time they are coordinating their own health appointments, so we have to be willing to be nimble and creative about that process, too"
13371,"I don't see this as humanitarian gesture, its motivated by epidemiology , economics and geopolitical consideration."

13373,I don't think any of our readers will want to continually have to take booster covid-19 shots every six months for the rest of their lives.
13374,"Of course one can argue that remove IP, will create disincentive to produce vaccines."
13375,But how often does a pandemic like Covid-19 come about?
13376,Do you think the US military cared about IP protections during the WW2?
13377,"Secondly, many Western economies/business are dependent on business from the Third World."
13378,"This ranges from international students studying in Western universities, orders for Boeing / Airbus planes, etc."
13379,The amount of Western tax payers money that goes into researching the vaccines is peanuts compared the revenue lost from these activities.
13380,"Thirdly, right now a lot of poorer countries are dependent on Chinese vaccines."
13381,"Not necessarily because of cost, but availability."
13382,"Some of the larger developing countries have the capability to produce vaccines, and even do their own research (aka Kazakhstan and Thailand)"
13383,"It's a fantastic effort, only limited by the incomprehensible stupidity of millions of people."

13401,"There can be financial incentives created outside of the market, sure the costs for all the research, development and distribution is pretty massive but (a portion) of those costs aren't fully set in stone anyway."
13402,One would figure for example that government funding wouldn't need to worry about spending lots of money to get it processed by the same government.
13403,"Not to mention that compared to the massive amounts of US funding to begin with, the few billion that Pzifers vaccine took is almost a drop in the bucket even if we took on the full development costs."

13424,"So do the people charging diabetics hundreds of dollars for the insulin they need to live, that doesn't mean you should jump to their defense."
13425,I dunno.
13426,The few interviews I watched mention the existence of several well established pharma production facilities in Europe that could start production.

13434,It always goes back to the simple principle of permitting pharma to benefit and profit from the products they are in the business of making.
13435,"Without the profit driving the innovation, pharma, in our capitalistic system would cease to have a motive to develop products."
13436,The same argument would fall under other types of necessary products.
13437,Removing IP protection is a big legal step which is far ranging in its effects.
13438,If we do take some sort of eminent domain step to take the vaccine then what will happen when the next pandemic shows up or to the status of many other unrelated and necessary drugs?

13443,"Mask mandates have been so politically charged that I don't see them ending any time soon, as long as masks are considered a symbol of solidarity rather than as a functional tool for preventing viral spread."
13444,And yet I don’t see them coming up with mRNA and had to resort to decades old inactivated tech.
13445,The loss would be income that Vietnam would lose from visitors spending tourism dollars during their time in quarantine that doesn't add any real mitigation of COVID risk.
13446,Tourists won't come to Vietnam with quarantine requirements when they can go elsewhere that recognizes a vaccine passport.
13447,South Korea has adopted this starting May 5 -- you get to skip quarantine if you're fully vaccinated.
13448,"In the US, every vaccination dose has an electronic record."
13449,The trick though would be some system that VN could rely on to verify those records.

13458,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-billion-dollar-covid-vaccines-basic-government-funded-science-laid-the-groundwork/
13459,Corruption.
13460,I think those micro factories or what you should call it is more of a diversion though.
13461,It seems like the initial doses will be produced at various subcontractors.
13462,"It does seem like they have severe issues getting materials, and I am curious how many doses are ready when/if this is approved by the EU."
13463,"That ingores the for the massive govenment support   into the development of other medicines, mRNA and breakthrough technologies the government funds."
13464,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-billion-dollar-covid-vaccines-basic-government-funded-science-laid-the-groundwork/
13465,You have it exactly backwards.
13466,"Third World countries are forced to pay through the nose for lifesaving equipment and medicines that they could produce themselves because, thanks to WTO-enforced patent protection, they can't manufacture it themselves without incurring the wrath of the developed nations that hold the patents and profit from squeezing them dry."
13467,"This is actually one of the ways that colonialism never ended, because [over twenty times more money flows from the developing world to the rich countries than it goes back the other way in aid and charity](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries)."
13468,Maybe those people should pay their bills on time ya know like a well functioning adult does
13469,But China has pretty much all you listed other than the trained personnel and facility to “mix” the mRNA and LNP which really is the main trade secret.
13470,And China might’ve already gotten that trade secret from the Fosun license now they just don’t have to pay for it for other Chinese companies to use it.
13471,&gt; It sends a signal that intellectual property will get thrown out the window as soon as politicians find it inconvenient - particularly if it's a tear-jerk-y case involving a developing country.
13472,"So there will be less of an incentive for biotech

More likely that it’s an economics calculation that showed that the US has a lot more money to gain from doing this (by way of avoided lockdowns) than not doing it, given we’re all at risk until the virus is contained everywhere"
13473,I’m not going to try to educate you.
13474,You and I will not see eye to eye and I am fine with that.
13475,✌️
13476,It's so crazy to see all the different ways the world responded to COVID.
13477,"Here in Virginia indoor dining has been open uninterrupted since June 12 of 2020, and the state in general has done quite well compared to other US states (ranked 43rd in cases per million)."
13478,People in biotech wanna actually make money for their efforts and investments how greedy of them to want to be paid for their work
13479,Now let's hope that they also work over some most dangerous variants as well.
13480,[deleted]
13481,Does the vaccine keep building any more effectiveness after that last 2 weeks?
13482,"For example, with Pfizer, I understand it's about 2 weeks after the second shot you are considered vaccinated."
13483,But does peak level of effectiveness stop right there?
13484,"Is there any literature or data that indicates the possibility that the effectiveness can keep climbing after that initial 2 weeks, even if it's a relatively small amount of difference?"
13485,[Found this](https://news.yahoo.com/osterholm-youre-among-vaccinated-people-035657610.html)
13486,Nope.
13487,I don't know if I'd classify them as common they actually are (though it might depend on demographics and geography).
13488,Most estimates are at coronaviruses accounting for 15% of colds.
13489,"Given an average of 3 colds a year, that would put it just under 1 coronavirus cold every two years."
13490,"Alright, I just didn't want them to pull the lotto ticket but I'm gonna go ahead and schedule it and just monitor everyone's symptoms closely just in case"
13491,"As we all become fully vaccinated, we will all progressively continue to give fewer fucks and the unvaccinated will continue to be at risk and potentially die but no one will care because it's no longer a pandemic and they are choosing to remain at risk despite everything that's been said."
13492,"Yes, I'm going with the peer reviewed trial data from Jan 2021."
13493,&gt; Yeah people in africa making knockoff copies of clothes is why theres so much poverty and suffering and totally not centuries of imperialism and exploitation.
13494,"Singapore has that exact same ""legacy of imperialism"", and it's one of the richest countries in the world."
13495,"It also has strict IP protection, and consistent rule of law."
13496,There's a connection.
13497,"It isn't the only factor, but yes, there's a connection."
13498,"&gt;  If CEO's of Pharma companies aren't gonna look for a cure for AIDS or Ebola because they cant make a profit in poor countries then they're evil ghouls

Someone needs to explain to me why all other companies and individuals can charge for the work they do, but if pharmaceutical companies ask to be compensated for the work that they do, they're ""evil ghouls""."
13499,70.1% of people 65+ are fully vaccinated.
13500,[removed]
13501,&gt; Waiving the IP protections is just a way for national governments to shift the costs from their own healthcare systems onto the pharmaceutical companies.
13502,You mean like the way pharma companies shift the lion share of their R&amp;D costs onto governments and publicly-funded research institutes?
13503,Let's see them make try and make any money if they couldn't foist these costs off.
13504,"They spend more on stock buybacks, marketing, and payouts to doctors than they do on R&amp;D."
13505,It's quite possible that they contracted covid within the quarantine system near the end of their stay.
13506,This has happened in both Australia and New Zealand.
13507,Alright comrade.
13508,[deleted]
13509,And there's non mRNA vaccines.
13510,"The system is so fucked that those making a profit can count on a veritable army of unpaid defenders even right here: people who get absolutely no benefit for defending pharma's profits, and yet they do for free what those laboratories would have to pay hundreds of thousands to astro-turf on their own."
13511,"We are getting closer and closer to the scientific ending of the pandemic, due to vaccination efforts."
13512,"To be clear, this is better than a ""social ending"" of the pandemic, where everyone just stops trying and lets it spread."
13513,Scientific ending is the one we want... where restrictions go away once COVID-19 is no longer prevalent in community spread!
13514,Oh no!!!
13515,Think of all the western profit that could be lost if China cures more diseases!!
13516,The horror!
13517,"I’m not saying 500,000 could have been prevented but we could have done much better if there was some actual leadership interested in solving the problem and not downplaying it at every chance possible"
13518,Why are you downvoted?
13519,You are merely stating the truth.
13520,"Yeah American fucked up royally in its early response(and the handling of its second wave), but its contribution on vaccine development is immense and second to none."

13524,I really hope the drop eventually plateaus somewhere at like 500k.
13525,Anything else would be bad news for a normal summer in the more cautious states.
13526,NJ has seen a big drop off in first doses over the past three days.
13527,Very disheartening.
13528,I still think we’re well on our way to a good level of immunity but a higher uptake would have given our governor more room to open up quicker.
13529,"Also, western pharmas will be the biggest benefactor if the IPs were waived

Roche, Novartis, Merck, Sanofi, and GSK would easily outbid and outmatch the other smaller pharmaceutical companies because they can pay for raw materials at a premium and will be faster at converting their facilities compared to others."
13530,I do think it's a good call though.
13531,"The faster we can produce the vaccines, the better it is for everyone."
13532,Side note: it's interesting to point out that the biggest pharmaceutical companies weren't the most successful at making the first vaccines.
13533,"It's BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford"
13534,"Some people are dealing with re-entry anxiety, but if you're fully vaccinated you can do anything you want, state/local restrictions permitting."
13535,I believe each of the producers would separately have to get authorization from the FDA - basically to validate their supply chain and production processes.
13536,I don't think the IP issue has any bearing on quality.
13537,Why do you care.
13538,"You're vaccinated, so you should be fine."
13539,Also would like to point out that most anti-vaxxers that I've seen are holistic crystal healing women whp are definitely not republican.
13540,"But hey, keep belittling people, that's how you persuade them."
13541,The problem with pegging it to a certain % of people vaccinated is that you can't make people get vaccinated.
13542,What if you make it 70% and we're stuck at 68% for 6 months?
13543,You hold most of the population hostage because of 2% that are reluctant.
13544,It has to be based on availability.
13545,"If 35% of people refuse to take the vaccine after it's been available for 6 months, sorry that is their problem."
13546,Reopen the rest of society and we'll deal with the consequences of those 35% separately.
13547,Wrong way to do it.
13548,He should say his goal is to keep keep the vaccine hesitant numbers high amongst certain groups.
13549,Their contrarian nature could help drive adoption
13550,I have been going since the beginning you'll be okay.

13552,"Yep, my friends brothers who think everything is a conspiracy said about the pauses “it proves the vaccines aren’t safe, and they know it”."
13553,The public is fed so much misinformation from two starkly opposing sides.
13554,There seems to be no unity in this “United” States
13555,I used to be be afraid of needles...but I heard someone say that most things in life it's the anticipation of the pain that's worse than the actual.
13556,"So I just go in there and don't think about it...and when it comes I just say ""oh"" like it's a surprise...turns out it's true, when you don't anticipate it's not half as bad."
13557,Hope it helps out someone.
13558,"I say, open up everything."
13559,Their incentive will be watching the vaccinated thrive and the unvaccinated still catching covid and dying.
13560,"Seriously, how stupid are they?"
13561,It’s a shot that saves you from dying to a known virus.
13562,Is that not good enough?
13563,The problem is that the people who flat-out don't want to get vaccinated are the same people who've been ignoring restrictions/guidelines/mask wearing etc.
13564,this entire time.
13565,"They never sacrificed normalcy at any point over the last year, so you can't entice them to get vaccinated with the promise of ""getting back to normal."""
13566,Correlation is not causation.
13567,I understand that at first.
13568,We are clearly past that stage.
13569,It’s very clear Pfizer and Moderna are perfectly safe.
13570,Considering administration of the vaccines have been carried out at the state and local level i have no clue what he thinks him setting such goals are going to achieve

13627,"“It’s going to take four to five years until everyone gets the vaccine on this planet,” said Mr Poonawalla, who estimated that if the Covid-19 shot is a two-dose vaccine — such as measles or rotavirus — the world will need 15bn doses."""
13628,"&gt; the public SUCKS at risk assesment

What's particularly head scratching to me is that the demographic of those who like to advertise that they aren't afraid of COVID are often the most afraid of the vaccines."
13629,"They're more afraid of a vaccine that hasn't detectably caused a death (for Pfizer and Moderna) or roughly 1/1,000,000 (for J+J) than they are of a disease that has _already_ killed more than 1/600 Americans (including both those who got the disease and those who didn't)."

13684,Yeah we honestly need to vaccinate 110% of people /s
13685,"Wait until you hear the backlash of how it would be an ""invasion of medical privacy""."
13686,I do agree that we need proof of vaccination for traveling internationally but way too many people would just lie or make fake vaccine cards to get into bars and other such places.

13722,The point doesn't stand because the idiots refusing to get vaccinated are still catching COVID.
13723,They get immunized that way whether they want to or not.
13724,And they catch COVID at a higher rate because they don't take the precautions necessary to avoid it.
13725,It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.
13726,That’s a little bit of an extreme correlation.

13771,i feel like more than 30% of the country is selfish pieces of shit who wont get vaxxed unless forced
13772,Is there a reason why a lot of nurses don't wear gloves when they give shots?

147 million vaccines given in the US and they expect that their vaccine will be different, or there is somehow a side effect being covered up on such a massive scale."

13791,I am undecided on what to have for dinner tomorrow.

13793,You're traveling before being fully vaccinated?

13811,Ask the next Anti-vax fraidy-cat you meet why they hate the founding fathers.
13812,See what they say.
13813,"If you’re vaccinated, the pandemic is effectively over for you."
13814,Covid poses less of a risk to you now than the flu.
13815,The only reason why the CDC and other organizations are being overly cautious right now is because a lot of people still aren’t vaccinated and we don’t have a way of immediately knowing who is and isn’t.
13816,"For example, if they said vaccinated people don’t have to wear masks at all anymore, something like 70% of people wouldn’t wear them at all even if they aren’t vaccinated yet."
13817,It’s the same principle as when they said “masks don’t work so don’t get one” back in February 2020 because they didn’t want there to be a shortage for healthcare workers.
13818,"Bro I don't want to spend a month in bed, weak, like my 30-year-old brother, or still need an inhaler a year later like my 31-year-old friend."

13820,"(Before you even start, these are all healthy, regular weight, active people)."
13821,Most people don't die from most diseases.
13822,We still avoid them because they're misery added to a life and pleasure removed from it.
13823,The wealthiest zip codes have the highest vaccination rates and the lowest infection rates (and vice versa).
13824,"Per zip code, there is a clear negative correlation."
13825,"This is bad from a socioeconomic equity perspective, but 'good' from a epidemiological perspective - the overlap between vaccinations and cases is going to skew less than a random sample."
13826,Total antibody coverage is almost certainly better than your estimate.
13827,Not to the percentage of adults vaccinated.
13828,"Hmm, but isn't authorisation for a drug based on the efficacy / risk trade-off?"
13829,"For example, chemotherapy is a very dangerous drug, but it's still approved, because for the people targeted for this drug, the benefit still outweighs the risk."
13830,"If a covid vaccine had side effects on the level of chemotherapy, it obviously wouldn't be approved, even for emergency use, regardless of its efficacy."
13831,So what does it mean that EUA requires the same bar for safety but a lower bar for efficacy?
13832,"In other words, if the benefit isn't clear yet, how do they determine that the benefit outweighs the risk?"
13833,He rambles a lot so it's hard to tell but it sounds like that's going to change.

13839,"Be gone, peasant."
13840,This is going to be a lot harder to do than the last one.
13841,What do you mean?
13842,Arent like only 40-50 percent vaccinated in the US?
13843,"Doest thst mean, half of the people do not want it?"
13844,Where I’m at the hospitals aren’t forcing any of the staff to take the vaccine but it could be different state by state or depending on hospital etc...
13845,Where is it like this?
13846,"In the pharmacy I work at, we have walk in availability for the Pfizer vaccine all day, every day and throw away doses each night because people don't want them."
13847,"Out of curiousity, are people treated differently by law wether they are vaccinated or not?"
13848,"Because in my country, after the second shot people don't need to quarantine or are forced to take a test after having contact with a infected person or want to go to the hairdresser."
13849,There are talks about opening hotels and restaurants for vaccinated people as well.
13850,"I think that's the government way to say: Listen, you aren't forced to get the vaccine, but you sure as hell should, and we will hassle you for it."
13851,"I actually like this solution quite a lot, as it makes sense from a technical perspective, but also gets the job done."
13852,"At least I hope so, we are not that far percentage wise than you guys."

13894,It would be hard to believe that the general public will actually \*need\* a booster every year.
13895,Seniors have shown waning immunity and health care workers are highly exposed.
13896,It's probably overkill for the rest of us and I can't imagine this will get much greater uptake than the flu shot would on the average year.
13897,I'm fully vaccinated now and I don't see myself getting the booster unless there is a large number of breakthrough cases in the future.
13898,"Unless I am stopped to talk to someone, I have never worn my mask outside."

13922,"The amount of data collected on safety and efficacy is massive especially when you consider the deal with Israel, wherein the country agreed to share all its data from the population with Pfizer."
13923,"Pfizer has also proven its manufacturing capabilities which is also a big deal when filing a Biologics License Agreement—batch production quality and ergo safety (can consistently produce and store, and safely ship the product) has been proven in the field with 10s of millions from doses administered under the EUA."
13924,I’m sure Pfizer has been sharing data with regular meeting with all Health Authorities for the countries in which it has been shipping drug.
13925,Under normal situations this is standard.

13932,"I do think the metros will do better than rural areas overtime, I was just hoping to see something closer to CA where the opening to the full public seemed to stimulate a 3-4 week surge rather than like 1 week and then a swift drop off."
13933,We are the areas with more people flying in/out and more connected to other metros so it does make the most sense to push for higher metro coverage and try to avoid spread into rural sorrounding regions from there.

14218,"I can understand if not all family members are vaccinated, but following that, you can safely visit other vaccinated people in their homes."
14219,You’re also not going to get zero risk of infection.
14220,we’ve only ever done that to two diseases in human history.
14221,You’d best check your expectations of other people.
14222,It truly defies logic and reasoning.
14223,"The world is filled with literally millions of stories of deaths - within one year - from COVID, yet these people are far more terrified of the statistically insignificant portion of the population that has experienced side effects from the vaccine."
14224,*Side effects.
14225,* They are literally more fearful of possibly having residual effects from a vaccine than literally facing possible death from the virus.
14226,"Not to mention, I love when they cite that there are no longitudinal studies on the vaccines’ effects; last time I checked, there aren’t any for COVID’s residual effects, either!"
14227,Talk about gambling on the dumbest of two choices.
14228,"It’s akin to running up the stairs in a horror movie versus out the front door - sure, you might die either way, but one way is probably *much* more dangerous."
14229,They are at like 55% so I don't think much.
14230,"They are using a type of ""vaccine passport"" as well."
14231,"I fully support an employer's right (and obligation) to provide a safe working environment by requiring vaccines, and ""At will"" employment."
14232,That's the most aggressive timeline I've seen yet for those younger ages.
14233,That would be dope as hell.
14234,Would love to get my 5 year old vaccinated early in the school year.
14235,"Obviously if you ask that poor girl who lost her father, she'll say yes..."
14236,"But if you look at the bigger picture, no way."
14237,Keeping schools opened for the whole school year is too important.
14238,Especially considering France will end up having more or less as many deaths as its European counterparts.
14239,"No hostility, but I definitely won't look at people who were able to work from home screaming about how we need these restrictions to be permanent because they're scared of the virus, meanwhile people less fortunate aren't able to make enough money to pay for food."
14240,"It made me realize a lot of those people who claim to be progressive and woke are really as selfish as the rest since they couldn't care less who was destroyed by the virus fallout, if it wasn't someone dying from the virus they paid you no mind."
14241,...and I’ll still wear one next week once I’m fully vaccinated.
14242,Agreed- my wife and I work in the industry as well.
14243,Was just providing a baseline as most people don't know much about the approval process.
14244,"I'm interested to see what the process looks like moving forward for booster/variant shots, as we will likely be dealing with it long term and at some point, an abbreviated review will be necessary"

14246,My second shot (pfizer) barely even made my arm sore.
14247,No other side effects.
14248,First shot was worse and even that was like any flu shot I've had previously.
14249,I have no doubt that people will try literally any angle they can to try and avoid getting vaccinated.
14250,Sadly.

14280,There's a nugget of an interesting point in your nonsense here.
14281,"I think you're trying to ask ""why aren't you skeptical of Pfizer, when they've had just as many manufacturing problems as other companies?""."
14282,You would have been a lot more effective if you just came out and said what you meant.
14283,"The answer is that they've spent the last few years preparing to specifically manufacture mRNA vaccines as part of their partnership with BioNTech that predated the pandemic, with full support from that team to put manufacturing processes into place."
14284,Pfizer didn't just acquire IP from BioNTech - they worked closely together to design the manufacturing processes.
14285,Which is exactly what is needed to expand production:  a simple IP waiver isn't sufficient.

14316,"Even if most things are mostly open nowadays, I'm real tired of the morale drain of seeing everyone in public with masks."
14317,Totally worth suffering to not be a transmission vector.
14318,"Oh, he should get a medal!"
14319,I think it’s just apathy in the sense that they’re not scared but will get it when it doesn’t require the degree of diligence or whatever that it does now.

14321,"This means following notification accounts/lists, checking vaccinefinder, signing up for various notification services, etc."
14322,I would prefer a monetary incentive for the people who decided not to vaccinate.
14323,I would even be ok not getting one myself since I already vaccinated.
14324,We just need more people to be fully vaccinated or else this is just going to keep being the same bullshit forever.
14325,Like  another $1000 ought to do the trick.

14333,"I see so many families (including my own) where mom and kids are wearing a mask, but dad isn’t."
14334,"Hey, I'm not making any statements about who got screwed and who didn't."
14335,There's just a lot of talk about discrepancies between Philadelphia and the rest of the state.
14336,I'm only offering a possible explanation to that no matter the context.
14337,Edit: And to continue to clarify; the person I replied to criticized the state for how Philly was handled.
14338,I was merely pointing out the state *didn't* handle Philly.
14339,"In California, it was only ever mandated outdoors if you couldn't' distance (6 feet)."
14340,This new guidance doesn't really change much of how it's been the entire time.
14341,And  hold your hand whole you get a tiny shot?
14342,That would be good if it will get you to do your duty to mankind.
14343,I recommend that you use whatever support network you need to make sure that you do YOUR CIVIC DUTY to protect the world from the virus!!!!

14347,I wonder how many of the vaccine intolerant are insured at their own cost.
14348,Would this really be an incentive?
14349,Was the public investment not creating trillions of dollars of benefits to society?
14350,Where is the public’s ROI?
14351,"Should read, 120 families per minute are being destroyed by this virus."
14352,It's insanity.

14355,You mean only dose.
14356,J&amp;J/Coronavac gang represent.
14357,All it takes is a single bad vaccine to make it through and cripple and/or kill a few hundred people to absolutely crater public trust in vaccines and ensure all the advanced we've made in eradicating diseases to be undone
14358,That 0.1% doesn't really say much about the efficacy of the vaccine but more about the overall circulation of the virus and the behaviour of those vaccinated people.
14359,You can't take that % and say that all vaccinated people have only 0.1% chance of getting it.
14360,"If you live in an area with more COVID, or if you spend more time in large groups indoors, there's still a higher chance of getting it."
14361,That's why the guidance in CA during the entire pandemic was that you only needed to wear one outdoors if you couldn't distance from people (6 feet).

14369,These are the basic things that they're there for.

14517,"Although that's also with the most risky outdoors gatherings banned (contact sports, packed concerts, etc.)"
14518,"I don't think it'll be much of a game changer in Canada, 82% of our population lives in urban areas (cities) and our remote communities like the reserves are pretty far along with vaccinations already

Just because of geography and concentration of population, the one dose and less stringent storage isn't as big a deal for Canada as some other places"
14519,"I’d say that as soon as the vaccines get full approval ( which Pfizer have asked for ) people will get it as insurance companies will just tell people, you get sick we won’t be paying when there’s a vaccine to protect you, it will also allow businesses to tell staff get vaccinated or quit."
14520,DeSatan is a tool
14521,San Francisco just hit 72% with first doses.
14522,I believe we can get there nationwide.
14523,"I know people on here are probably tired of my constant posting of these updates but they're just making me so excited I cant contain

NJ's transmission rate plummets again to .27, down from .37 yesterday (which itself was already the lowest by far its been since the pandemic began)."
14524,Its phenomenal how fast and steeply they've dropped.
14525,"For some perspective, one week ago it went down to .88 and that was a big deal because it was the lowest it had been for months."
14526,Now each day since then we've been dropping and dropping.
14527,Now we're at the point where it basically takes 4 infected people to infect one other.
14528,"As I always say, take the numbers with a slight grain of salt because other factors are in play (people are still masking, jobs/school still remote, students are locked inside studying for finals, etc) but even taking that into account, the way it has dropped so fast is a really good sign of things to come quickly."
14529,We were doing all those things for over a year but it has really only started dropping this fast now once vaccinations have opened up to everyone and people are building up immunity (I know natural immunity from infections plays a role too but still).
14530,We cant get complacent yet (the number has to stay low for a sustained period of time) and have to keep doing what has gotten us here (get vaxx'd and if you havent keep taking precautions) but if we keep this up for only a few more weeks we're in good shape for the summer.
14531,Vaccinated people pay normal price.
14532,Non-vaccinated people pay 2x price.
14533,"Ok, so if I get sick, I stay home."
14534,Is that not caring for my fellow humans?
14535,I wear a mask where it’s required.
14536,Is that not caring?
14537,LOL the reasoning is so disingenuous.
14538,*looks up hedonism*
14539,Southern conservative states have about the same rate of covid as other states in America
14540,Is anybody else getting really tired of hearing this exchange?
14541,"Person A: ""I really hope the mask mandate is lifted soon!"""
14542,"Person B: ""ACTUALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF PEOPLE WORE MASKS LIKE IN ASIA EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC""  
  
It's a non-sequitur, that response doesn't make any sense."
14543,"There's such a huge difference between a pandemic-time, universal mask mandate and Asian ""mask-up-when-you-feel-sick"" culture and they're really barely related at all."
14544,&gt; We know how to solve the problem but there's a significant portion of the population that just can't be bothered.
14545,Or are actively hostile to solving it.
14546,[removed]
14547,Is it possible that setting these goals publicly has a negative effect on vaccination numbers?
14548,"I mean, almost half the voting population voted for Trump and I wouldn't put it past any of them to sacrifice their own personal health just so that Biden fails at something."
14549,Just a thought.
14550,There is light at the end of the tunnel then.
14551,I’ll wait for the meltdown on the Facebook page of parents of my suburbia land town where is still just the flu.
14552,I never and will never get the flu shot.
14553,I may eventually get the covid vaccine once they get enough data in and the public beta ends and the first update comes out (fall).
14554,Yeah it only really affects the instances where you cross paths with someone while walking outside.
14555,Now you don't have to pull your mask out of your pocket or give people a wide berth.
14556,Can someone do a deep-fake of Trump asking his fans to get vaccinated?
14557,Think you might have that second to last comparison a bit backwards?
14558,Doesn't seem to fit your argument.
14559,Through work I know a few dozen blue collar types who are mostly against getting the shot.
14560,"I think the best strategy for Biden would actually be to come out and say, ""vaccines are avaliable, get one or not, I don't care."""
14561,"A lot of vaccinated elites would lose their minds if he said that, but there'd be a lot of quiet respect from some fence sitters."
14562,"Also, once the shift is made from supply constrained to demand constrained, setting specific targets creates peer pressure in red areas to not allow him to reach his stated goal and strut around later with it."
14563,"It's stupid, and it shouldn't he like this, but it is, and that's what I'd be telling Biden."
14564,"&gt; But a ton of people are not reasonable, and this was an easy target for intellectually and morally deficient assholes."
14565,"For those people, not pausing could have been the same easy target."
14566,"""They paused."
14567,See?
14568,"They know it's dangerous."""
14569,"""They didn't pause."
14570,See?
14571,"They don't care that it's dangerous."""
14572,"After a week or two, there is no vaccine left in your body."
14573,It has simply trained your immune system to recognize and create antibodies for the virus.
14574,"When it’s time for a booster, they will be for variants that your antibodies don’t recognize and you’ll be able to take any available."
14575,What kind of boss won’t let someone go for an extended lunch break and get 1st/2nd shot?
14576,One extra hour vs. not being able to work for days/weeks/ever again?
14577,Seems like a pretty good trade off - maybe your boss is a fucking idiot.
14578,The data we do have though suggests high effectiveness against *infection* as well by the mRNA vaccines.
14579,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html
14580,Make COVID vaccination a requirement for health insurance to cover any COVID-related health expenses and for unemployment insurance to cover any COVID-related job interruptions.
14581,lol.
14582,Don't go into public health as a career.
14583,I fear you would be dissapointed.
14584,I won't be getting the shot right now.
14585,I will wait another good 6 months or so.
14586,"We all are going to need boosters anyways in the fall, might as well hold out for that one."
14587,"Let the rest of the public go through the Public Beta for this new vaccine and see how all the bugs shake out (reactions), let the companies get that data and fix their vaccines."
14588,"Never adopt the first release of anything, wait for the bug fixes to come out."

14590,"If Bill Gates depopulated the world, then his wealth would mean absolutely nothing."
14591,It would be completely devalued and provide nothing to him.

14593,It would mean an utter collapse of all societies across the entire planet creating insane instability.
14594,These people don’t ever stop to think about the results of said conspiracy theories.

14597,I had the freedom to exist as a 19 year old male car owner.
14598,"Didn't help my insurance premiums one sweet fuck, but I did have that freedom."
14599,I just want my doctor to give it to me.
14600,I have recovered from the virus recently and I am not feeling good in general.
14601,That's stress from a new job and probably just getting older.
14602,I also want the one and done.
14603,Need to schedule a physical and can't so that until June due to insurance coverage.
14604,Isn’t a contest
14605,But the point doesn't really still stand...
14606,There absolutely is.
14607,The constitution says nothing about vaccinations and only has a few limited freedoms specified.
14608,Travel isn’t one of them for example.
14609,If you’re referring to the Milwaukee protocol that was an extremely lucky case.
14610,It’s almost invariably fatal without the shot and pretty much a death sentence once symptomatic
14611,"Yeah, but the messaging is completely different when you say ""You can spread COVID if you are fully vaccinated"" vs. ""Scientists don't know for sure whether or not you can spread COVID if you are fully vaccinated""."
14612,[deleted]
14613,Thanks Anthrax vaccine.
14614,I would 100% be willing to get a third shot if the variant from India starts spreading across the US.
14615,"Given what I’ve heard from coworkers who have family over there, India’s situation with Covid is terrifying right now and it doesn’t seem to be much like the strains we’ve already seen."
14616,You can sign me up for a third shot
14617,I think it was implied that the other commenter was only considering options that weren’t incredibly stupid and ignored a global pandemic.
14618,"If we were interested in those options, though, you make a great point."
14619,I'm not 100% informed but for herd immunity we need 70% *with antibodies* or 70% *vaccinated*?
14620,Because we've got over 30 million people who have gotten Covid already who are still alive.
14621,Do they count towards herd immunity?
14622,You can't get covid twice right?
14623,70% of adults getting vaccinated seems like a  steep ask when 20% say they won't get it and another 20% say they aren't sure.
14624,"The virus isn't endemic in NZ, and it is in Canada."
14625,That is never going to change for Canada regardless of government decisions.
14626,New variants and all of that is 90% fear mongering and 10% legit concern.
14627,"Closing the borders in Canada has always been, and continues to be purely political theatre."
14628,They want to make it seem like they're doing something by creating massive inconveniences for people that provides next to no benefit for public health.
14629,"I understand things like temporarily halting flights from active hot spots, but the current policy goes well beyond utility in the fight against the virus and purely into a show for the public."
14630,Except there’s not much he can do to move this along.
14631,"The vaccines are available, but you can’t force people to show up for them!"
14632,Yes.
14633,That pesky Constitution upholding personal rights and liberty over the benefit of society for the greater good!
14634,I think it's just an emotional thing for some people.
14635,"It's nicer to think that there's a solution, and some company is just a dick, rather than there's something out there that can put a miserable end to any of us at any time."
14636,Oh and your comment just proves that Pfizer could never successfully manufacture a vaccine successfully.
14637,This is pretty complex stuff Bub.
14638,It would cause all sort of issues if we just let Pfizer try to start manufacturing vaccines.
14639,Just one bad lot from that troubled company could cause a lot of issues WORLDWIDE with vaccine hesitancy.
14640,This is not as simple as you think it is.
14641,"Plus, moderna is telling us Pfizer can’t manufacture vaccines anyway."
14642,How bad is it for you?
14643,I got my second dose yesterday and mostly I'm just a little sleepy.
14644,How long did it take for side effects to kick in?
14645,By this fall?
14646,I'd feel annoyed I had to wear a mask since covid is long gone other than in very anti Vax areas.
14647,Went golfing with a friend fro high school over the weekend.
14648,He is graduate level educated.
14649,He tells me he has many friends who are nurses who have told him that people have been getting vaccinated and then die a few days later.
14650,Said that alone was enough for him to not get the vaccine.
14651,Mind you this is a dude who’s tried every drug in the book.
14652,I didn’t even bother one but to try and convince him otherwise.
14653,It wouldn’t be possible.
14654,"I simply said oh man, “well I got mine and noticed nothing different."
14655,Must be lucky.”
14656,"Unless the gym requires it, I don't think you need one if you're fully vaccinated."
14657,I also question how effective a sweaty mask really is.
14658,The ones i have seen do not mention it is free.. but that may change
14659,I went in and told the needle person to not stop talking to me until she was putting the bandaid on.
14660,Then when she was done I was like are you sure you did it..
14661,That's really low.
14662,Believe you are on to something.
14663,I checked 2019 2020 flu shots  .
14664,The  male uptake is significantly lower.
14665,"age 18 and up

About 42 percent given to males and about 52 percent to females."
14666,"Does not add to 100% due to confidence levels, rounding etc."
14667,"He said on Twitter today the goal is 70% with at least one shot, this title is a little misleading."
14668,"I agree though that 70% is about stretching it for the upper ceiling, with a vast majority of Republicans saying they will refuse to get it and spreading as much conspiracy theory bs as they can to their gullible friends."
14669,Second dose is no joke.
14670,Jesus
14671,Maybe not!
14672,DON'T FALL FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S  LIES!!!!
14673,You don't need a coronavirus vaccine -- it's 5G tracking devices in your pure white bloodline!!!
14674,Yeah right.
14675,Rabies is not 100% fatal.
14676,People have survived it  Don't spread misinformation.
14677,I’ve referred to multiple plants actually.
14678,Telling you only chose one.
14679,Please show me a non industry mouth piece exclaiming having more facilities is both impossible and won’t lead to more vaccine production?
14680,"If you don't even understand why so many wanted to keep schools open, how can you judge whether they made the right decision?"
14681,"Yup, exactly."
14682,"And if the card IS sufficient, then all it means is there's going to be ton of fraud in anti-vax areas while honest people are stuck in a stupid bureaucracy theater."
14683,"As much as I wish it was possible to force people to get vaccination, it's too late in this case and will do more harm than good."
14684,"When I got my permanent resident visa, I had to prove I had certain vaccinations."
14685,"In the cases I had lost the record, I had to get a certified antibody test, which was pretty hard to fake."
14686,Doing that for COVID at large scale is impractical.
14687,Let's just not.
14688,Good luck Canada!
14689,Hope your bat shit crazy folks are a smaller percent than US.
14690,Man it’s nice having a President of the United States.
14691,I look forward to the goal posts moving for the 'it isn't really approved' crowd.
14692,The article in the link is not remotely related to the headline.
14693,What would you do o o for a Klondike bar?
14694,Right wasnt wasn’t the *profit margin* somewhere in the 100’ish million?
14695,I just read a NY times article this morning that basically said we will never get herd immunity.
14696,It had a graph of each state and the amount of people planning to get vaccinated in each state.
14697,"No surprise, Dem states were 90%+ and Pub states were 10-20%."
14698,Makes me so angry that this was turned into a political theater so early on.
14699,Makes me sad that my son is going to grow up in a world where covid is never erradicated.
14700,Asymptomatic people don't spread the virus very well.
14701,"The vaccine makes it so that the people who still get covid will mostly be asymptomatic, so there won't be much spread."
14702,"Other, more ice-cream-truck-rich states can send theirs once done with the vaccination."
14703,After that they're just an annoyance anyway.
14704,My hubs got his second yesterday and I get my second next Tuesday🥰

14718,"They're suggesting this variant is 1500% more deadly with their claim of ""15 times more lethal."""
14719,You'd want a PCR test to tell you if you have an active asymptomatic infection.
14720,You'd need an antibody test (pre-vaccine) to tell you if you had COVID-19 and the virus was no longer active in your body.
14721,Everyone's so desperate to quote the death rate but nobody mentions the other short and long term effects of the virus.
14722,Sickening.
14723,"Would love to see the Churches get more involved, in particular with the antivax population."
14724,Pastors could help a lot by convincing as many members as possible to go get vaccinated for free as soon as possible.

14731,By far the smartest move of the pandemic so far.

14737,Can we achieve herd immunity without them being vaccinated?
14738,My dad is one of these but I can’t figure out a way to talk to him about it because to him science is politically motivated and the virus is a scam....
14739,U/papaswamp doesn’t have a clue as to what they’re talking about

14746,I think the people who are reluctant now are not worried about the specifics of how dangerous the j&amp;j problem might have been but instead are surprised that anything could ever come into question to begin with.
14747,Everyone at the party is also vaccinated or did you miss that part.
14748,The two mRNA vaccines reduce your risk of getting infected by 90%.

14808,"If people are so dumb that they don’t realize that a day of feeling meh is better than 2 weeks of COVID, and that if the vast majority of us are vaccinated we can _actually_ go back to normal, and the lack of vaccination at the community level is why this drags on and we keep having to wear masks, etc."

14820,You’re failing to take into account the damage to all faith in government we’d face by lying to the public and pretending there was no problem.
14821,"Take, for example, pretty much *everything* Trump has said publicly about COVID."
14822,I've got a 2 year old and 1 year old.
14823,I can't wait either!
14824,&gt;The feds could also make a tax credit for anybody who has been vaccinated.
14825,"While I support the idea of encouraging people to get the vaccine, this would set a bad precedent IMO."
14826,This 100%.
14827,The risk of vaccine issues for Pfizer seems to be close to 0%.
14828,For kids the risk covid issues is low its still a few percentage points.
14829,"And unless airlines or hotels or casinos start requiring it, this isn't going to change unfortunately."
14830,Does the US have any testing requirements or quarantine for general arrivals?
14831,There need to more financial and other incentives to get vaccinated.
14832,$5 isn’t even remotely enough.
14833,I got $20 dollar gift cards from Publix this past year for getting the flu vaccine.
14834,Eventually you need some carrot and some stick.
14835,I’m torn.
14836,I think it’s fine.
14837,"But my anxiety, my partner who works in healthcare (and worked in a COVID unit) - are saying no."
14838,"The new variants are harder on younger people, and we will continue having more variants as people keep getting sick and passing it around."
14839,The way to get past the pandemic is for as many people to get vaccinated as possible so we stop spreading it around and it stops mutating in us.
14840,[removed]
14841,This is true.
14842,"I mean, Trump was right."
14843,It will be gone by Easter... 2022
14844,I am American and it makes me sad and suck that so many of those people exist here.
14845,"Alas, there are Covidiots around the globe."
14846,Not everyone on the internet is American.
14847,The person you’re insulting is Indian.
14848,"Due to the size of the current outbreak, it’s much more likely a vaccinated Indian has been exposed to COVID than a vaccinated American has."
14849,India is using different vaccines than the US.
14850,They’re short on masks so that healthcare worker in particular could’ve got a high initial dose.
14851,"And their healthcare is a mess, so instead of the US figures of roughly 7000 cases, 500 hospitalised, 70 dead, you’d expect for 7,000 post vaccination cases, 150 got a hospital bed and 350 died."
14852,"Seems likely OP is telling the truth, even if it would be highly unlikely for an American to be able to make the same claim."
14853,Most do.
14854,I get my 2nd one tomorrow.
14855,"There are *some* that don't, and it is a significant number, but its definitely not most."

14864,That's a really good point actually.
14865,The situation would be dramatically different if the only vaccines available for use were AZ/Janssen (although Novavax uses a different technology and may not have the same side effects).
14866,"Had we been in a situation where there was some component of ""rolling the dice"" with the vaccines or simply not being able to administer it to people under a certain age, you'd see a huge spike in hesitancy and general anti-vax sentiment."
14867,Thank the science gods mRNA was ready to shine.
14868,"Right at the corner of PG, Howard and Anne Arundel counties."
14869,"I wonder if events, such as festivals or conventions, in the future can require consent to check their vaccination records for attendance."
14870,"And if they do, if they're allowed to get them from states' databases."
14871,"Right at the corner of PG, Howard and Anne Arundel counties."
14872,100% yes to vaccines for my kids.
14873,Once schools are at normal capacity and drop their mask mandates covid could devistate a school.
14874,"Yes the risk of severe illness and long term issues is very low for children, but I do not want to find out."
14875,Also by September we will have an absurd amount of data on the Pfizer vaccine.
14876,"My whole thing is if the shot protects those who get it the way we think it does, then vaccinated people should have very little fear of being near those who aren’t vaccinated."
14877,"Obvious exceptions can apply to this, but in general I would think once fully vaccinated you can just live life."
14878,Concerts will be harder.
14879,But imagine an outbreak on a plane.
14880,Or at an office.
14881,"If there’s contact tracing, they’ll likely be able to compare manifests or payrolls to vaccination records."
14882,It’s weird how this is suddenly a concern when it’s not that new of an idea.
14883,People weren’t cheating on their vaccines before covid.
14884,The circumstances for pulling from the database will have to be well defined.
14885,I work for a hospital that administered the vaccine.
14886,They tag all employees’ health records as protected.
14887,It would be illegal for them to verify via health chart which ones opted in.
14888,Which is why they ran vaccine scheduling and registration via HR.
14889,I don’t know what the protocol was if someone no showed.
14890,Hey vaccines!
14891,Whatcha gonna do?
14892,Whatcha gonna do?
14893,Make our dreams come true!
14894,I don't know why you are being downvoted.
14895,"Consider using the numeric code to identify the strain, instead of the geographic location."
14896,"It is a more accurate label, if less easy to remember."
14897,"There is no evidence that suggests 9 month waning immunity, nor that there will be a post-vaccine surge in this country."
14898,"The 6 month data still showed 90% efficacy, we'll see how that shakes out but right now it's staying strong."
14899,Biden has said there will be no national database.
14900,How is that possible?
14901,"By the end of April, every state should’ve allowed all adults 16+ to be vaccinated."
14902,Hell Biden essentially required all states to do that lol.
14903,Federal efforts are really paying off in the black community.
14904,There has been a ton of outreach to get them vaccinated
14905,The state still has an indoor mask mandate which I am ok with but they need to allow businesses that can implement some type of passport type situation to do so.
14906,It would be easy for gyms to do it.
14907,The gyms I go to have been lightly used and everyone has masks so I don’t feel comfortable going without considering there are signs everywhere requiring masking.
14908,I no longer bend the top of the disposable mask around my nose and let a little space for air to pass.
14909,No reason for someone who is fully vaccinated to have a tight seal.
14910,If they have the vaccine then you should have no worry about killing them whether you have it or not.
14911,Why are you people such vaccine deniers?
14912,Trust the vaccines!
14913,It’s really incredible that you do this everyday.
14914,You’re a good person.
14915,I will definitely get my kids vaccinated.
14916,I can't have the hot mama summer that I'd like to have because my kids aren't old enough to be vaccinated and likely won't be for a while because they're under 10.😭
14917,Languish.

14931,There seem to be a fairly significant percentage of false negatives on the RT-pcr test in India.
14932,This isn't conclusively attributed to the mutation or specific variant.
14933,It seems to be more likely because of some older test kits being less effective.
14934,There's also speculation that the samples themselves are not always properly collected.
14935,To prevent possibly hundreds of thousands of people from dying?

14982,Right?
14983,"The US has the 3rd highest population in the world, grouping Americans together is silly"
14984,"You’re not getting the point, if a lot of people don’t get the vaccine the virus will continue to spread, the more it spreads the highest the chance of it mutating to bypass the vaccines, and then we would be back to the 2020 situation."

15046,At least in canada the national vaccine advisory council  suggests mrna vaccines are preferred based on the risk assessment of the 2 available adenovirus vaccines j&amp;j and az.
15047,They only suggest giving az to 30+ and the provinces follow that advice.
15048,But officially health canada has approved both az and j&amp;j for 18+.

15063,Why would festivals or conventions want to limit the amount of people coming to their event?
15064,Vaccines aren't 100% effective.
15065,It would follow that those who are most worried about the virus would want to be able to further reduce their risk even after vaccination by only exposing themselves to others who have been vaccinated.
15066,"Also, if those sections are better seats than the rest of the stadium, it may be an incentive for those on the fence to get a jab."
15067,Especially if there is a mobile vaccine clinic outside the stadium.

15100,There's been a few vaccines that were discontinued because of safety issues that were apparent fairly quickly.

15106,"Since you say he got it 6 days after his shot, that would mean he most likely caught it before the shot and is now showing symptoms."

15119,And now it's fairly trivial?
15120,That's how it will be for vaccinations soon.
15121,"And vaccinations are easier to do, and you don't need more than two shots ever, whereas for tests you could use one every week or two (if you were super paranoid or something)."

15123,They seem to post these long ignorant rants and then not come back.
15124,Thanks for pushing back.
15125,My own sister is holding off from getting the vaccine at all in large part because she is personally aware of somebody who apparently suffered seizures after getting the J&amp;J vaccine.

15141,I’m sure that covers a good amount of it but I personally know a few folks that are taking covid very seriously but also are weary of a vaccine without FDA approval.

ding ding ding!"
15146,My parents weren't signing up for a vaccine anywhere except at their PCP office.
15147,"Whether they are justified in their thinking or not, they had it stuck in their heads that vaccine-dedicated clinics and pop up sites were going to be staffed with inept volunteers and untrained buffoons, and they did not trust getting a needle stuck in their arm in that kind of environment."
15148,Again: *it doesn't matter if they were justified in feeling this way or not*.
15149,The punchline is that they decided they were only comfortable with their PCP giving them the shot.
15150,They're not alone.
15151,A chunk of the population in this state (and nationally) won't get it anywhere else.
15152,So it's good that PCPs are getting increased access to the various COVID-19 vaccines.
15153,Vaccines are sold at a profit and forced into artificial scarcity.
15154,Reason neither encourages nor promotes goodness you verified genius.
15155,You know what else is?
15156,Measles.

15220,Our HR manager was going around the plant encouraging people to get vaccinated.
15221,When she found someone she told us to email the HR admin associate and she got us registered at our choice of places dependent on what vaccines we wanted and how far we were willing to travel.
15222,I think our plant is over 60% vaccinated.
15223,It also helps that our company has given production associates an extra 8 hours of paid time off if they get vaccinated by September.
15224,Efficacy is a mathematical extract from a controlled trial and has a specific formula.
15225,I don't know what effectiveness is.
15226,It may mean different things to different people.
15227,The two terms are frequently and erroneously intermixed.
15228,"For the first month or two--maybe even the first 3 months--of the pandemic, I thought that Wolf and Health Secretary Levine did a good job of communicating to Pennsylvanians what changes were being made, what data they were considering, and what timelines they did (or did not) have in mind for those changes."
15229,Sometime in the summer this changed.
15230,Metrics that were well defined and publicly facing suddenly didn't seem to be the ONLY things they were considering when making decisions for the red/yellow/green phase reopening system.
15231,"A lot of their decision making seemed to start incorporating ""it just doesn't feel like the right time"" types of emotional/illogical concerns."
15232,"They were remaining excessively harsh on mitigation measures that didn't seem to really do a whole lot to reduce spread of COVID-19, while also being a little loose about things that DO reduce spread of it."
15233,"The ""former businessman"" governor sure seemed like he didn't care much about providing effective relief for the businesses being harmed by the orders."
15234,I am sure that some of what seemed like conflicting or inept decisions on their part stemmed from a Republican legislature that simply refused to work with them at any point.
15235,"But after all that last summer/year, I kind of started to give up on the idea that Wolf and his administration would take a turn and suddenly start feeling like good, effective leaders again during this pandemic."
15236,"And yet, just like you: I have to agree."
15237,They did indeed hit a home run yesterday with that announcement.
15238,"It's clear, concise, has understandable nuance to it, a simple date and an easy to understand metric."
15239,"By my tracking of vaccination progress in PA, I think we could hit 70% fully vaccinated (read: shot-in-arm, not necessarily fully built up immune systems) by mid-June."
15240,"But if we keep slipping on vaccine administration, that'll push back."
15241,"If this announcement about masks being tied to vaccination levels has the intended impact on the public, though, we could see increased vaccine participation and we might beat the mid-June timeframe."

15247,Can't wait to see my kids protected from this little fucker.
15248,How many years of data did Salk have in his vaccine before they rolled it out world wide?
15249,His vaccine was developed in 1955 and rolled out in a year world wide.
15250,The analogy is spot on.
15251,“The effect was impressive.
15252,"From 28 000 reported cases of polio in 1955, in 1956, one year after immunisation, there were only 15 000 cases.”

“1953."
15253,"Perhaps because of the worst polio epidemic in history in 1952, the National Foundation’s Committee backed Salk’s work."
15254,In the 1954 trials over a million children were randomly assigned to vaccinated or non-vaccinated groups.
15255,"Vaccination reduced the incidence to less than 50%; when a vaccinated child did contract polio, it was usually non-paralytic.”

There was mass outbreak in 52 and by 56, half of all kids were vaccinated, HOW IS THE ANALOGY NOT APT?!?"

you still count as unvaccinated until next week by their guidelines (two weeks after second dose to be fully vaccinated), though you probably do have most of your protection at this point."
15338,"short version is that they think it's safe for you to go maskless in small, indoor, private groups and to be maskless in outdoor activities like hiking or dining (basically any outdoor environment is fine maskless unless it's extremely crowded like a stadium or music concert), but still wear a mask at indoor public environments (gym, movie theater, etc)."

15357,"I have my own emotional damage sustained from this time-period: wrangling covidiot family members, dealing with undiagnosed dementia in one of them, my dog having a stroke, and as people are commisersting with above-- a loss of faith in humanity which really has profoundly changed my outlook."
15358,"I don't know what comes next but I will say that having had some minor PTSD from a small car accident that took a few months for the adrenaline surges, hypervigilance, sick-to-my-stomach feelings and panic to leave, I cannot imagine what it's like for you, to keep walking into work where I assume you keep having situations that trigger the anxiety and panic."

15403,CA (well LA at least) has plenty of appointments available.
15404,I showed her on the CA vaccine site that there were hundreds of appointments available the very next day.
15405,Scientists and researchers were able to develop this vaccine after using decades of research on previous vaccine and technology and test it on people in clinical trials in a big effort to see if these vaccines were safe and effective.
15406,"We have many vaccines (only a few for a Coronavirus) And we know that from our decades of vaccine research, the majority of long-term side effects come from within the first 90 days or so."
15407,"We were able to study these during the clinical trials, and complete the clinical trials very rapidly because there was a lot of funding, many willing participants, and high levels of disease activity which made it easy to complete the clinical trial more quickly."
15408,"So this is how we are using these clinical trials to evaluate issues that this vaccine could cause, including longterm issue."
15409,We can look at any issues caused by the immune response and determine if problems are arising in the people who received the vaccine.
15410,Only because we don’t have enough people vaccinated.
15411,It’s just the people refusing to get it that’s dragging this out!
15412,LMAO

15416,"Pfizer provided all the funding, facilities, scientists, shouldered all the financial risk, etc."
15417,Their experience in bringing drugs to market quickly and running an efficient clinical trial was paramount to the success of the vaccine.
15418,"I'm not downplaying Biontech at all here, they were the other half of the equation, a very important half."
15419,50/50 is fair.
15420,Long term effects are very rare for vaccines.
15421,Side effects generally show up within the first few months.

15423,"They did proper trials for the vaccine and the type of vaccine, (phizer and moderna) has been in development for years."
15424,We’ve been making vaccines for close to 100 years.
15425,I like to think of it like a vehicle.
15426,Would you not feel safe buying a new car from a reputable automaker?
15427,Some states let minors as young as 11 consent to vaccination without their parents.
15428,"&gt;the us wants to send their military in

Ok...and?"
15429,We do it literally all the time for disaster relief around the planet.
15430,If that’s where the experts are than so be it
15431,Mutations are more likely to happen when not enough people get immunized because the virus keeps getting to spread.
15432,End of story.
15433,"The reason we don't have vaccine resistant strands of most diseases is because the vaccines were effective enough to eliminate the spread and bring cases down to 0, preventing any mutations  from occurring."
15434,Epidemiologists have made it clear that vaccinations are key to stopping the spread and mutations of Covid.

15444,If there’s a decline in cases you won’t see that reflected in the hospitalization numbers for a matter of weeks.
15445,Give it a month and let’s see what the numbers look like.
15446,Honestly I want to believe that’s the case but you’re probably only talking about symptomatic cases.
15447,Asymptomatic could be spreading and kids could have lingering effects from that.
15448,I feel like we won’t really know how all of this plays out until studies are done
15449,I see absolutely no chance of that this year (nationwide).
15450,You'd have to seriously incentivize this to get it there.
15451,I don't know if getting 20% off coupons at your grocery store will do it.
15452,And that's exactly what I was saying.
15453,They give consent for the state to provide them vaccination records.
15454,my efficacy point was if pfizer partnered with a separate company.
15455,the foxconn comparison isn't accurate.
15456,pfizer invested dollars and scientists.
15457,they chose which variant of vaccine to proceed with and developed the trials necessary to test these.
15458,they worked with regulatory bodies to have emergency use granted.
15459,"they developed manufacturing processes necessary to produce billions of this product, and they developed the logistics necessary to acquire all raw materials necessary, and transport the finished product globally."
15460,"pfizer is not a contracted company like foxconn, or like emergent solutions is for jnj, or lonza is for moderna."

15474,"There is probably some not-insignificant overlap between people who are not getting vaccinated and the people who never took Covid seriously to begin with (didn't mask or barely did, never socially distanced, etc.)."
15475,Meaning that a good chunk of those people may have already had Covid and may have some immunity from that.
15476,Not totally sure but it seems plausible to me.
15477,"Pennsylvania is doing better than many states, with 63.3% of the adult population being partially or fully vaccinated

15480,They're likely won't be full herd immunity although it will be pretty damn close and cases should not be substantial

15749,Why are people finding it necessary to judge?
15750,I don’t know how you can tell why someone is wearing a mask.
15751,Not wearing a mask is more directly connected with perfomative behavior.

If you believe we made a mistake, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing to you about the following submission: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5ogw0/-/)."
15806,There’s been a lot of debate around Bill Gates position on this issue.
15807,He supports maintaining full control of the IP and production to the owners of the vaccines.
15808,"Many feel this is a capitalistic evil scheme and while that interpretation is not unreasonable,  your concerns of maintaining a consistent quality and control of the product so that one third party fucking up a batch doesn’t cause the entire population to distrust the whole vaccine is a valid worry."
15809,So I think there’s a nuance there and I have to mostly side with letting Pfizer keep the control.
15810,However it is also true that much of the development and research initially comes from tax payer funded university research first and then gets taken up by pharma.
15811,Pharma does very little actual original research from the ground up.
15812,So I also see the inequity of letting them enjoy the entire windfall of a product that has public funded research at the onset and letting them profit while not maximizing the possible output to meet demand.
15813,So I’m a bit conflicted
15814,The paper is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7019e3.htm).
15815,It's based on data through late March and the cases projections are more pessimistic than what really happened over the past month.
15816,The vaccine administration projections are probably more optimistic for May and later.
15817,Under all its scenarios (See Figure 1) cases were expected to rise throughout April and peak between early to mid May at between 600K to 900K a week.
15818,"In actuality, reported cases are now around 350K a week, which the optimistic model didn't predict would happen until early June and the most pessimistic model by early August."
15819,"The vaccine administration scenarios (See Table 1) for April seems close to what happened, though with recent reductions in administrations, it seems unlikely that they will be able to maintain the 50 to 65 million first doses rate through September to reach 75% to 90% coverage in all groups."
15820,Thank you.
15821,Can you add the required daily first shots needed to get to the 70% by July 4th goal to your stats so we can see if we are above or below that?
15822,Thank you.
15823,"Well, the effectiveness of vaccine is not disputed (otherwise we wouldn't try to get it, would we)."
15824,"It's just that the number of vaccinated people arriving so far is very low, so their total inconvenience is negligible in comparison to the potential extra load of paperworks to check and confirm authenticity the border control would have to do at every entry points."
15825,It's easier to just put everyone entering VN in facilities for a few weeks.
15826,"No big gain, but no serious loss either."
15827,"As for the vaccination, VN is a little too far back in the queue to buy them, and the doses received from COVAX program are limited, so they are reserved for medical, quarantine facilities' and and border control personels for now."

15832,Compare to you making up factsvoutnof nowhere?
15833,Laugh louder my dear
15834,It lowers incentive if there are no patents (a lot of people are viewing this as a slippery slope).
15835,"If it's just for COVID, I'd agree, but you can make similar arguments for HIV, couldn't you?"
15836,"I know it's all just make-believe fear for now, but as someone who works in the industry, I can confidently say patents are especially important 

Also we have a shortage of raw materials anyway"
15837,What would lifting the ban mean?
15838,Would unvaccinated travellers be able to go to the US with a negative test?
15839,"Pfizer is 90% effective against even asymptomatic cases, the non mrna test effectiveness just by not getting severe disease."
15840,The difference is likely bigger than 65% and 90%
15841,NYC has a database of vaccinated.

15847,Finally - compare LTC deaths in private and government run homes.

15862,Significantly less than both China and COVAX.
15863,"US will easily surpass Russian donations with its 60 million AZ pledge, easily."
15864,They probably won’t match Chinese donations.
15865,China is doing a very good job.

15888,[Gravitas: Bill Gates says no to sharing vaccine formulas to developing world](https://youtu.be/tropM4cajFw)
15889,Exactly!
15890,Where is the data from the trial where participants are now contracting the variants?
15891,Last I heard Pfizer was extremely effective against variants as well.
15892,Surely they would have some data to release regarding diminished efficacy in the original participants to base this on.

15904,I would love to know how Biden choose 70% of adults getting their first dose.
15905,"Was it based on Science and the belief that if we achieve the goal, there will be ""good enough"" protection?"
15906,If it was based on science I would love to know their assumptions.
15907,For example if they assumed kids 12-15 would be eligible soon.
15908,"Instead of a ""70% of Adults"", I would have loved a ""55% Total Population"" goal."
15909,That would have been effectively the same number of total people but allowed us to achieve the goal faster if some kids get vaccinated.
15910,To reduce risk to the business of being sued?

15912,You mean the Boomers with their 75-80%+ vaccination rates?
15913,I remember my comments being deleted from this sub when I said Pfizer would be the most sort after vaccine because AZ is essentially useless if variants spread.
15914,The science has said masks outside are overkill this whole time.
15915,They studied it extensively with CHOP in Seattle and the BLM protests all over the country.
15916,"If outdoor spread was in any way significant, those events would have started a wildfire of virus."
15917,They did not.
15918,No cases were passed.
15919,Florida opened up in October.
15920,We then had our biggest spike in Nov-Jan and we just had another spike in April.
15921,Florida now has more cases and deaths per day than California.
15922,"Manufacturing is one thing, being able to administer that many doses is another."
15923,"Right now, everyone related at all to the medical field is trying to keep sick people from dying."
15924,&gt; We don't develop new vaccines because of lax patent protection.
15925,"We entirely depend on US innovation here to make vaccines and medicines available to the rest of the world

Yes."
15926,"The people who should be complaining loudest about this are the biotech companies in countries like India, because if their governments take a lax attitude toward IP, it completely undermines their ability to get paid for the work they do."
15927,"To the best of my knowledge, domestic US flights don't require a test."
15928,The test is required for entry from another country.
15929,Too bad you read it
15930,"I mean... the US, Israel and Europe all were ramping up their vaccination pace at the peak of the winter surge."
15931,"Ah yes, because pre ordering millions of vaccines doesn't help economically."
15932,"There is a scientific measure of how contagious a virus is, it's called ""R Naught"" or spelled out r0... it's the reproductive rate or in other words, on average how many other people does each infected person spread to."
15933,I'm not a Marxist
15934,Because there is no evidence what you're saying is true.
15935,"Well, then you're just wrong because we already ran this experiment."
15936,"In the 90s, there were numerous state and pharma backed initiatives to subsidize treatment in this way that were completely ineffective in controlling HIV spread in the global south."
15937,IP waivers for treatments produced with mountains of publicly-funded basic research were what got things under control.
15938,There's no need to make the same mistakes twice with a new pandemic that's far more transmissible.
15939,Speak for yourself lol Boston released an 8/22 date the same week as NYC's 5/19 despite having 70% vaccination and single-digit deaths in the state.
15940,Our vaccination metrics can't really improve much and the measures are widely popular with the liberal mom crowd in the state.
15941,It was hell just getting rid of the mask mandate outside.
15942,"Yeah, but I really don't even understand why people are afraid of side effects from the vaccine at all."
15943,"Out of everyone I know that's had it (which is probably at least 20, different ages, health, etc etc), I had the worst after effects."
15944,"I'm 28, relatively healthy, and have never had effects from other vaccines."
15945,Both Pfizer shots made me feel like I had the flu minus congestion and coughing.
15946,"Whole body hurt, could barely move my arm, very tired, low grade fever and chills."
15947,First shot was worse and lasted about 48 hours.
15948,Most of which I slept.
15949,Second one the fever was worse but it only lasted around half a day.
15950,"Slept, woke up, all better."
15951,"Point is, I felt like absolute crap."
15952,But I don't get why that's a big deal or concerning to people.
15953,"Everyone gets colds or the flu sometimes and it sucks, but you get over it, usually."
15954,Not to mention that any effects aren't actually being sick and just a sign that your immune system is working.
15955,What is there to be nervous about?
15956,"Let me guess, you don't give a damn about mass evictions?"
15957,What way too many people here seem to miss is that patent protection is only beneficial for society as long as doing what's profitable overlaps with doing what's beneficial for society.
15958,"When that isn't the case, such as with HIV or COVID, the only thing letting market incentives run free accomplishes is letting some people profit to the detriment of the rest of society."
15959,"If governments aren't allowed to tweak those incentives so that the profitable thing is to do what's right, what do you even want a government for?"
15960,Don't think it will make much of a difference to waive the IP.
15961,You have a whole ecosystem around it.
15962,"At first, you need the trained people, which takes years."
15963,"Then the Marburg facility is just the ""mixing"" process."
15964,The MRNA essence is produced in Mainz and Idar-Oberstein.
15965,"The lipids are still produced in Canada, whose suppliers were found by Merck, Evonik is still in the phase to upgrade one of its facilities to produce the lipids domestically and just started production."
15966,"Biontech is the fortunate situation to have two bioreactor producers, Sartorius and Merck, just around the corner, who helped to set up the facility."
15967,Then you need vials.
15968,"One of the biggest producers, Schott, is around the corner, so that you didn't need to set it up."
15969,"Despite already existing big fill&amp;finish capacities, the federal government had to boost them and subsidise an upgrade of a plant in Dessau with 400 million € (additionally and unrelated to the Biontech subsidies)."
15970,"Additionally, several other companies like Dermapharm, Sanofi, Siegfried, Delpharm, Baxter had to convert their facilities, which just start to work now."
15971,To set it up from scratch would take years.
15972,And then you have the question if you want to decentralise the manufacturing process.
15973,The Marburg facility has a monthly production target of 84 million doses.
15974,It would be totally oversized to serve a domestic market.
15975,Apart from the point that the pandemic will be over in the richer economies in the third quarter.
15976,Many vaccine production sites will sit around idle from 2022/23 on.
15977,What in the hell is this?
15978,Landlords leech off of people's need for shelter through absentee ownership enforced by property rights backed by the state's capacity for violence.
15979,"Landlords do not own property by use, and therefore use violence-backed property rights to profit off of people that rent these properties."
15980,"It doesn't matter if they're ""rich"" or not, they are still engaging in expropriation."
15981,"Either way, don't bootlick people who engage in expropriation."
15982,Have some empathy for people who will suffer mass evictions.
15983,Really shows where your priorities lie

15985,I've cooled off on the idea J&amp;J was as a major factor as I had believed.

15987,The graph I originally posted was said to be unreliable by the guy that made it because he says data was delayed.
15988,Looks like he was right about being wrong.
15989,"It doesn't seem like that is correct... it implies everyone could get symptomatic infection, if the ""wrong exposure"" happened to them?"
15990,I'm not sure I like that explanation.
15991,"They're still going to want to remain ""anonymous"" and not share that they haven't had it &amp; yeah, definitely won't wear masks."
15992,"&gt; we have walk in availability for the Pfizer vaccine all day, every day and throw away doses each night because people don't want them."
15993,"I'm not having a go at you, but that is disgusting."
15994,Rougher than average response to it or just normal?
15995,Pfizer is the best but JJ is good too.
15996,Half of the women in my family got JJ.
15997,The risks for the JJ vaccine are about the same as winning a million dollar ticket.
15998,i am terrified of bees so no thank you.
15999,Is that even legal?
16000,That sounds so weird and tragic as well.
16001,The federal government doesn't have the power to overrule states for public health?
16002,"People really cant imagine any other motive for providing medical care than a profit incentive, god this system is so fucked"
16003,They’re pretty close to 100 percent.
16004,"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html

95 million vaccinated people."
16005,835 hospitalizations.
16006,Better chance of being struck by lightning.
16007,I typed those words in hurry and made it confusing.
16008,My bad.
16009,"Here's what I meant:

China defeated the virus quickly and efficiently, without significant foreign aid."
16010,Their government did earn some credits for it.
16011,\- True.
16012,"So India thought: OK, it should be easy."
16013,We can handle it.
16014,No need for too much foreign aids either!
16015,\- Bad idea.
16016,Really bad idea.
16017,&gt; you want this to continue indefinitely?
16018,Well you got the Neanderthal part down.
16019,"I said may, that's a very important word in that sentence."
16020,It definitely doesn't mean that I hope we have to wear masks.
16021,"I also said depending on the situation, so maybe senior citizen centers will still require masks, or hospitals and doctors offices, or places with an increased chance of being near immunocompromised individuals, or with an increase chance of spread."
16022,Vaccines aren't 100%.
16023,"They are awesome and at 80 to 90 percent, but if I'm near 100 people and 10 are vaccinated, I'd still prefer everyone wear masks."
16024,Like I said.
16025,Situational.
16026,&gt; Millions of people in the third world suffering from the effects of the pandemic but why won't somebody think of those poor shareholders.
16027,"Millions of people in the developing world continue to suffer from any number of diseases, and it's at least in part because everyone knows that the intellectual property protection there is weak to nonexistent, so there aren't strong incentives to work on a cure for the problems that they suffer because you won't get paid for the work that you do."
16028,"&gt;modi's new palace

What?"
16029,modi has a palace?
16030,??
16031,?
16032,I have the feeling that they have been saying that phase 3 results are coming next week for many weeks now.
16033,"I mean, I hope for great results and a decent production capability, but until now they seem disappointing."
16034,Why do people who didn't vote for these leaders deserve suffering?
16035,Oh yes!!!
16036,We are getting there.
16037,Believe we are turning that corner.
16038,All the introverts can still stay home and enjoy their lives.
16039,For the rest of us...  we will get back to norm.
16040,"Like, what is the rest of the world suppose to do in this situation?"
16041,"If Brazil creates a vaccine proof variant, we just stand by as one man drags us into the abyss again?"
16042,Letting pfizer or any other company keep the control is simply a genocidal position.
16043,"You, as a western person, fail to recognize just how insanely privileged you sound."
16044,"There’s literally no reason why corporations should even have the control in the first place considering most of the research is tax-payer funded, as you say."
16045,Stop simping for for-profit healthcare you rube
16046,"Texas and Utah both have very high vaccine support on the map, higher than Georgia or Arizona."
16047,"I agree that there’s a weak correlation with Democrats getting the vaccine, but it’s not that strong of a correlation."
16048,It’s not anywhere as extreme as you claim.
16049,"It undermines your point, to lie about the numbers."
16050,[removed]
16051,"https://covid19.tn.gov/covid-19-vaccines/availability/

16053,"You can, once enough people get vaccinated."
16054,"We all can, then."
16055,Jesus.
16056,It seems Indian people are even more proud/arrogant than Chinese.
16057,"(as a native Chinese, I observe similar behaviors from my countryman, but not that extreme)"
16058,Yep.
16059,"As long as masks are required, the messaging *isn’t* turning to “vaccinated people can go back to normal”."
16060,And yet the argument rarely if ever seems to be expressed in a way that focuses on European labs.
16061,"Huh, wonder why."
16062,Health Canada is doing a rolling review of covid vaccine candidates.
16063,It means companies like Pfizer have to keep reporting its finding to Health Canada and they will keep updating its decision rather than waiting for a large scale study result.
16064,This is why they were first to approve the vaccine back in December.
16065,"I feel the same way about seeing Kong vs Godzilla in theaters, but trust me, you don’t want to risk getting tackled at the one yard line."
16066,Interesting they’re doing 50 µg as opposed to the 100 µg for the first two.
16067,Hopefully that reduces the heavy fevers and fatigue that some have experienced from dose two.
16068,How will they become the new Bayer if they lose their main source of profit within the next few months?
16069,You know some Chinese or Indian company will undercut them with a generic/biosimilar since they don’t have to account for the sunken cost of R&amp;D or license.
16070,I would specifically seek out and apply at companies that required vaccinations.
16071,"Not just covid, but annual flu and whooping cough and any other communicable disease."
16072,It would be incredible!
16073,Yeah but that's what all the analysis is.
16074,I understand that the 2nd dose being delivered is what halts the data and I suppose most of these studies are based on real population data/results so they can't really adjust that; they're just drawing conclusions from the real world.
16075,I just wish we had a study of one dose 3/4/5 months out since we currently seem to only be able to guess what that'd do and it would certainly be helpful information as the rollout begins to reach the developing world.
16076,Winston Churchill never said that.
16077,"&gt;Bangladesh already produces a bunch of pharmaceuticals

So does Germany."
16078,"Conflating the UK, Russia and China is some serious whataboutism."
16079,One of those nations is very much not like the other in terms of possessing real strength.
16080,I know probably 3 people off the top of my head.
16081,"Two are coworkers one who is hard anti vax one who is soft that will probably get around to it as soon as it’s been around for a while, and a third who just seems lazy."
16082,The third being a friend who I don’t see often.
16083,"Keep trying to get them appointments but they either are just real busy at work, nervous and don’t won’t to tell me, or incredibly lazy."
16084,Yeah I was happy with just no severe illness.
16085,Not catching it in the first place is also great.
16086,[removed]
16087,Not mRNA-capable ones
16088,"Bill Gates was finally like, I'm going through a lot, y'all just do whatever you want."
16089,&gt; and for what immediate benefit?
16090,Saving money.
16091,"That's what's so absurd about this: it isn't about principle, it's just about saving money for countries that claim they can't afford it."
16092,"(I'd like to see a breakdown of the national budgets of India and South Africa before I believe that they literally cannot afford to vaccinate their people, though I suppose poverty is a reasonable argument for some smaller countries.)"
16093,"Since this is really about money, the issue is figuring who's going to pay for the development of the vaccine."
16094,Waiving the IP protections is just a way for national governments to shift the costs from their own healthcare systems onto the pharmaceutical companies.
16095,It's a cheapskate thing to do that will only disincentivize future development.
16096,[deleted]
16097,"Well, he does 69.420% so I'd assume you could just add a day or two to that number."

16099,"Yes, but they are as shady as AZ."
16100,"As a Chinese I have been arguing for my country to send help to India asap (despite border disputes),  and have been blaming our leaders for only paying lip service."
16101,Now I can see our leaders were just being wise; they knew any offer would be turned down by Modi anyways.
16102,"By ""the same"" did you mean WHO was expressing distrust in the data, or the article was reporting no significant conclusion by saying ""low confidence""?"
16103,"I’m not saying people should be encouraged to not pay rent, not at all, landlords have rights too and a blanket eviction ban opens lots of possibilities to avoid payment."
16104,"With that being said, having people living on the streets is about the last thing you would want as a society."
16105,"It’s morally wrong that some of the richest countries in the world can not provide for its poor, and extreme poverty makes crime skyrocket."

16109,*
16110,"""Properly"" approved is a bad choice of words."
16111,It was properly approved under an EUA.
16112,"Obviously ""fully"" approved is different, but mostly  just in a legal sense for some organizations -- the efficacy and safety data wasn't skipped over in the EUA process."
16113,Lmao you think they haven’t been close?
16114,&gt;A) No one who refuses to get vaccinated will happily acquiesce to a mask policy.
16115,"Well, tell that to the 30% of my coworkers who are doing exactly that."
16116,Their hope is if they hold off long enough it will all go away without having to get vaccinated.
16117,Cambodia just got tagged Central &amp; East Asia.... hahah
16118,"Wouldn’t be that surprising if this is the case, even if it’s small protection."
16119,"Covid-19 is a subtype of Coronavirus, and other Coronavirus types are common causes of the cold."
16120,At least they fired theirs.
16121,"India, Brazil, and the UK still have to get on that."
16122,I really don't understand this uncritical worshipping of Curevac.
16123,"So far, they delivered nothing and are still in their trials, apart from very irritating statements."
16124,In cases like this I think a better solution is for the government to subsidize the cost of the treatment until the patent expires rather than just invalidate the IP protections.
16125,Can the people who downvoted this please explain to me why someone who is expected to go to work and interact with the public shouldn't have gotten a vaccine before someone who has the option of staying home?
16126,"Yeah, not one of those famously understated  pride events of yesteryear."
16127,"Eviction momantariums are just not a sustainable solution, we should've just forgave people's rent instead or provided massive rental relief"
16128,Who do you think will be the last state to lift restrictions and when?
16129,"Currently, it looks like MA is planning 8/1 with Labor Day for Boston."
16130,It would have to be them or Oregon/WA right?
16131,"Announcing 3 months after NYC in the same week has gone over surprising well there for a 70% vaccinated state so I would guess them with at best a  July 1 for MA and maybe 3 weeks later for Boston, but Oregon seems to be in the worst shape of the Dem states."
16132,Guess the rest of the country will have to deal with a lot of vacationing Massholes very shortly... lol
16133,I sort of figured that would be the case.
16134,They kind of hover in that 350-400K range depending on the day.
16135,"&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Edit - just checked and Worldometer has them at 412K at the moment for today :("
16136,"Literally every single trial, study etc."
16137,"No vaccine has over 95% efficacy, and that was only testing symptomatic cases."
16138,It has been known literally since the very first vaccine trials.
16139,Good stuff.
16140,Now the Biden admin needs to pressure manufacturers to start sharing process information and work with other countries to develop new production streams.
16141,It obviously isn’t going to happen overnight but if we start working on new manufacturing sites in other countries we can help increase production for developing countries so we can vaccinated by 2022 or 2023 instead of 2024
16142,I was confused about that too lol
16143,"Bangladesh already produces a bunch of pharmaceuticals and says that they're ready to go any time, so... we'll see if the promise lives up to the reality."
16144,That’s not it at all.
16145,There exist pharmaceutical production facilities in very white Europe capable of producing vaccines but which represent a risk to the IP owners to use because they aren’t in control of managing the facilities.
16146,It’s not a racial issue.
16147,It’s a management and risk issue to the vaccine maker.
16148,"If a German plant makes a bad batch, the public won’t differentiate between what happened in house vs outsourced and view the safety of the vaccine itself under doubt."
16149,Should i get the JJ vaccine or should I travel further out for a different one?
16150,I wanted to get the closest one to me but unfortunately I didn't really want my gf to take the Johnson.
16151,Out of the 3 which is the best?
16152,"For me at least, with the Johnson being paused it already places it lower than the others."
16153,I just don't want that risk for any women in my family no matter how small it may be
16154,"What...

Curevac is an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer and Moderna."
16155,Is this entirely a Modi shunning of Biden because he was a fan of Trump or is there more to it than that?
16156,This is same with Russia.
16157,China's people would gladly returns to bikes to show everyone how powerful they are.
16158,Superpower complex.
16159,Even in UK is dream of rulers of the seas still strong.

16193,"&gt;The companyis working on creating seasonal flu shots using the same RNA lipid nanoparticle technology, which has vaulted from lab benches and a single drug for a rare disease a year ago into the most effective vaccine that is in demand worldwide."
16194,"“Pfizer has emerged as a leader in mRNA development, and we are exploring a wide range of opportunities for the technology,” chief executive Albert Bourla said Tuesday in a conference call for investors."
16195,Both companies have said they expect their vaccines will remain in demand for at least several years as coronavirus variants proliferate around the world and people require booster shots to maintain immunity after their initial doses.

16205,"Because the more people who become infected, the greater the probability that a mutation occurs that slips outside of the protection offered by the vaccines."
16206,Also the rest of us have to pay for your medical costs when you end up in the ICU.
16207,Its like what Winston Churchill said about Americans.
16208,"""They'll always do the right thing.....once they've exhausted all the alternatives""."
16209,ie.
16210,Do a whole lot wrong wrt to the pandemic for a long time......then go 'BEAST-MODE=ON' and absolutely kill it and rocket past everyone else.
16211,You're talking about two out of the three top most educated states in the US.
