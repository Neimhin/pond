263,See my reply to u/vannatyreyne for the long answer.
264,Short answer is that I personally invested in an Envo mask and add a layer of surgical mask in front of the exhalation valve.

274,"These are rules that everybody should be following, for their own sake, as well as that of others right now."
275,"The fact that Donald Trump was criminally irresponsible in the way in which he handled the Covid-19 pandemic is exactly why these rules are in place and have to be followed, like it or not, until this pandemic is put under control."

296,SB County itself is very large; but the vast majority are concentrated abutting Riverside and LA counties.
297,"Given that many people routinely travel though one or both of them for work or routine activities, taking their data in isolation isn't usually a good approach."

304,Later they recant and some admitted they said that to preserve the masks for frontline workers.
305,I believe this is based off of known hospitalizations and those that die.
306,Which is the numbers used by the commenter.
307,The much lower range that is around 0.6 (but not definitive) is based off of predictions of infections that don't require test confirmations and hospitalizations.
308,In the Netherlands you gotta do your own contact tracing due to staff shortage.
309,Insert ignorant comment about the vaccine
310,"Nobody is talking about paying them off, but if you can't see that high debts impede spending options, increase interest payments (lost taxes), and increase risk of insolvency."
311,Were you even awake in the GFC?
312,Did you follow the news about the ballooning public debt and corresponding interest rates that nearly bankrupted first world nations and put Southern Europe into a decade of stagflation?
313,?
314,"wow he can't even admit that its science that's helping him, he has to double down and pretend it's a miracle."
315,him acting like he was the bravest guy for not hiding out while ignoring all the preventative measures is a travesty.
316,Nah some fuckery went on yesterday
317,... its the FIFTH largest county by population in the state.
318,Usually big counties have big populations.
319,They also said its small and would not have an impact which are both wrong.
320,Sweden is notorious for herd immunity because international media keeps pushing this dangerous myth.
321,This is the same for the UK at this point tbh.
322,App could be better.
323,But local lockdowns and mandatory masks.
324,We have a lot more uni students though which I think is the biggest issue right now.
325,Why do all these reports only mention antibodies and never the T-cell and others?
326,If you had antibodies in your blood forever that would mean you were still fighting the virus.
327,Ha IRL I actually hate steak but point taken
328,We don't yet know where it started and likely never will.
329,We do now have confirmed cases outside of China that predate Wuhan however.
330,"Their talking points for fewer restrictions are, among others, about economics, freedom, sustainability, and caring about the mental health of citizens."
331,The goal is to cause as little damage to the society as possible.
332,"However, since we've had uncontrolled spread of the virus for some time (although deaths are now very low), there is some immunity."
333,"Even if the immunity in Stockholm is only 7-10%, that will affect how quickly the virus can spread."
334,It wouldn't make any sense not to talk about immunity considering how many have been infected in Sweden.
335,"Even if it isn't and never was a part of the strategy, it is a reality now."
336,"Note that I'm not saying that the Swedish strategy has worked well, but saying that the goal is, and always was, herd immunity, is most likely false."
337,That's actually closer to normal now.
338,The 98.6 thing is pretty outdated.
339,I think it's around 97.5 or something.
340,Where are you located?
341,Every corner store around here in western WA has at least KN95s for $5/ea or less.
342,Our governor didn’t mess around and we went from the first outbreak to one of the easiest states to get PPE in.
343,"My sister and her kids live in North Dakota and I send her tons of masks every so often for her, her coworkers, and her friends."
344,"I also work in social services and because our governor has been solid af, Washington’s allotment of FEMA masks from 3M actually got to us a couple months ago."
345,"I don’t use them (they’re for our clients who are at much greater risk and have little to no resources), but I am literally surrounded by N95s/KN95s all the time."
346,I personally invested in an Envo mask.
347,It has an exhalation valve but the way it’s made allows for the addition of a layer of surgical mask sealed airtight over the valve opening.
348,"I wear a mask probably 70-80 hours/week and was developing pressure lesions on the bridge of my nose, so it was well worth it."
349,"With the ridiculous amount of FEMA masks stolen by states and the feds, you’d think government officials could get ahold of one or ten thousand of them."
350,"""They knew"" isn't a fact."
351,Especially since we have since confirmed cases that predate wuhan that are outside of China.
352,California is a primarily Democratic state.
353,They will be fine with decreasing the Covid numbers.
354,"Wisconsin, where I am, needs higher numbers to benefit Democrats as it is a big battleground state."
355,I trust Faucis opinion too but it’s become pretty consistent that he is very conservative with his predictions because he can’t give a false timeline.
356,That’s why he’s throwing out a prediction that late out there.
357,"This technique isn't too new, it was used by film makers in the 1980s."
358,It's called morphing.
359,You take two images and through stretching you try to create a smooth transition between both images.
360,"Kind of like when a human turns into a werewolf you usually see them show this by first making his nose and mouth longer and darker, to morph into a wolf's snout, filling in the gap between somewhat flat human face and pointy wolf face."
361,"In that clip it's not even done nicely, it's not uncommon to cut interviews or speaches like that (e.g."
362,"to get rid of uhms or thinking pauses, anything that interrupts the flow without adding content) and usually you will barely notice it."
363,"Same in Germany, there is a bar here which has tents with heaters, they are opened at the sides but aerosols can stay under a tent for sure."
364,There are countries other than the USA
365,"For several reasons: new infections are more skewed towards younger people (below 30), as can be observed in many European countries."
366,"Generally more testing, so a lot of cases that wouldn’t have been identified during the first wave in March/April are now being confirmed."
367,Back then we suspected the actual number of infections was maybe 10 times the reported figures.
368,There’s also a 1-2 week lag between new infections being reported and the occurrence of death.
369,Better treatment in hospitals following 8 months of experience.
370,"&gt;not a fan of how the CCP dealt with it back in Dec/Jan/Feb,

What didn't you like with their actions in February?"
371,What was already locked in January.
372,"""They say, with the heat, from the vinyl siding on your house melting, it will go away."
373,"Miraculously it will go away."""
374,Tax revenue.
375,Dude you clearly have no idea what the hell you are talking about.
376,I want a blanket anti-capitalist statement?
377,"Here you go

The amount of debt a country has at any given time is irrelevant."
378,"As long as they can promise to pay, and are able to generate wealth and as such take more loan and so on, keep the money circulating from one country to another, the system we have developed just works(at least for now)."
379,Why is the amount of debt irrelevant?
380,Because its debt on debt and loan out of a loan type circulation.
381,There is not even close to enough money in total in the world for most of the countries to pay even half of their debts off.
382,And why would you need to?
383,It is only a number thus far.
384,What do you expect in a hyper-capitalist society?
385,"That's how US is structured - take whatever you can get, and give as little as possible."
386,No one gives a fuck about you so why would you give a fuck about anyone else?
387,Now I do realise that a very large number of Americans are able to bypass this programming and access their innate altruistic nature but unfortunately too many can not.
388,Because it is about the long-term.
389,"The Swedish experts realised early on that this virus is going to be with us for a long-time, and set up a long-term plan with measures that can be done for a longer time, with the hope of avoiding people getting fatigued."
390,"Maybe it will work out, maybe it won't."
391,We don't know yet.
392,"They talked about herd immunity a few times because, in the end, that is the goal for everyone (hopefully through vaccination)."
393,Worldometer is legit because you can see sources below (official health authorities).
394,"But numbers from Spain are very weird, they are very low and get changed in retrospect always."
395,But John Hopkins is more consistent for Spain or Israel (Israel's numbers often change on worldometer in retrospect).
396,[deleted]
397,"This is currently the one and only active case in the state, not really sure if it's very important."
398,The Netherlands just entered the conversation
399,i believe the record is 100. set back in 1918
400,I think you missed the main point of what they said and I’m not sure if you’ve seen their edit.
401,"If your comment was made to rebuttal OP’s, the point of their post was, when will it end?"
402,"Wanting to go back to normal life and to not do this forever needs to stop being seen as some horrible, inhumane perspective."
403,"Most people are starting to feel the effects of this whether it be financially, mentally, emotionally, etc."
404,"And from the many things I’ve read, the main people saying that eventually we will have to adjust are the main ones who have been staying inside whenever they can, wearing masks, not meeting up with family/friends, etc for the past six months (like myself)."
405,"What we’re doing right now is not living, it’s existing."
406,"And I agree with OP, there will come a time where we need to start weighing the cost and benefits."
407,"Just like we do with everything else in life and the diseases, viruses, and sicknesses we are aware of."
408,We can’t stop the world for a minority of people when the majority is hurting the most.
409,"And this POV needs to stop being shamed and ridiculed by people who use their reasoning of being fine right now as an invitation to tell others “suck it up and let’s keep doing this until whenever, no matter when that is.”"
410,"Beijing company asking Bangladesh for money to do a ""trial""."
411,Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
412,"It escalated in almost all EU countries now, look at Netherlands or Belgium."
413,"To someone not very familiar with the subculture or NYC-specifically, how regularly do the groups engaging in higher-risk behaviors interact with the general population?"
414,"Would this be an early predictor that the infection rate is going to spill over into nearby or into high-traffic areas, or are they so insular or the general population protected well enough (low-risk behaviors) that it shouldn't be seen that way?"
415,"Where I've lived, insular communities (Amish in the Midwest, some native groups, western US) don't mix as often, but are also far more geographically isolated into rural enclaves, not urban settings with a lot of shared infrastructure and commerce."
416,People celebrating a potential end of humanity gets upvotes.
417,Someone pointing out that this particular virus is not deadly enough to do that gets downvotes.
418,Reddit is schiz.
419,"And you need a lockdown on all EU countries, because there are many travellers who spread covid."
420,Who did this?
421,I haven't heard of it yet.
422,Actually bars are very important since they allow us to communicate and stay informed.
423,"If all our bars dropped below 1 or changed to ""NO SERVICE"" our society would be doomed."
424,Fuck ignorance.
425,We have discovered cases that predate wuhan.
426,Which means it did not start there or at least there is now no reason to believe it started there.
427,Wuhan was just the first place to have enough serious cases linked to an event to cause an investigation.
428,Stop blaming China.
429,We don't know where it vegan and likely never will.
430,Especially in Europe it would only work if all EU countries would coordinate lockdown.
431,And it will not help longer than 2 weeks.
432,Yeah that’s a good point.
433,I trust Fauci's opinion more than any redditor.
434,"Fauci's opinion is that we'll be back to normal by somepoint into Q3 of 2021, Q4 at the latest."
435,"Taking into account how many people are not taking the proper measures right now and how many more are only doing it because they want to be safe and don't really want to do it for any longer than necessary, it may be sooner."
436,"What I've been getting from his interviews is that even when there is a widely available vaccine we'll still need masks and distancing for a while to really cut off the spread or else lots more people will die, and I get that."
437,"For instance, if a vaccine becomes widely available in mid February, I'm totally fine with masking and distancing until June just to really put this thing away."
438,Pretty crazy that it’s been pretty stable and somewhat declining in Florida too.
439,Even after re opening schools and other public places.
440,Hope it stays this way.
441,Lmao at Mike Lee creepin
442,"Right, because we clearly choose this."
443,Asshole.

448,+107 new deaths total 21358.
449,Seven day average is now 146 compared to the 178 peak in May.

455,Bozeman is such a great town.
456,"Hrmm, you lock things down and mandate masks and infections go down."
457,Shocking.
458,Now let’s watch everything get rushed open and watch the numbers skyrocket back up.
459,From the very start experts have been saying we need strict immediate lockdowns.
460,Anything less would mean a larger spread of infection that would be harder to control and result in dragging out the consequences and ultimately hurting the economy more.
461,This hasn't changed.
462,You don't have to be wealthy to disagree with your opinion that is not supported by medical professionals.
463,I want the least harm to the economy.
464,It can and does get better.
465,"Even when people aren’t cooperating, miracles can happen."
466,"I’m in Australia and for the most part, people were cooperating."
467,"But in one state, it got out of control."
468,"The government of that state screwed contact tracing up, there are a quarantine scandal and many people did some really stupid things and fought back against things that the other states didn’t fight so hard on (masks, distancing etc)

The government of that state and the remaining responsible people eventually got fed up by the point it was going to get out of control (700 cases daily and doubling nearly each day) and went pretty much full on police state on everybody."
469,We were so close with all the other states having gotten it under control or near under control early on - it’s like the last runner on the team and trying to get them over the finish line.
470,We desperately wanted them to get there for their safety and the entire countries safety.
471,Everything locked down except bare essentials.
472,Mandatory masks.
473,No travel 5KM’s from your home - you needed a permit for further.
474,1 shop visit per household per day and and 1 hour exercise per day.
475,They police it heavily.
476,The police will arrest you.
477,They will fine you.
478,You will be mocked by everybody else.
479,They paid everybody to stay home.
480,Curfew from 5pm to am.
481,"Two months later and they are down to 13 cases a day, all traced and each and every day it drops."
482,The entire country is near covid free or as free as it might get - it’s mostly under control.
483,My point is.
484,Don’t give up.
485,Don’t feel beaten by it.
486,Don’t accept any less than the best.
487,Even when there are people who mess it up for everybody else.
488,There is hope.
489,This can be beaten.
490,"It’s possible, even when it gets out of control to get it back under control, it just might require some extreme measures and breaking points before it’s achieved."
491,"Not everybody agrees with what extremes Victoria had to go to, to achieve what it has - but I bet many are thankful that it was done regardless because of the huge successes it seems to be proving right now."
492,"Well that's what happens when you peak, you can only go down dipshit."
493,If I were Joe I wouldn’t do it.
494,That family so blatantly disregarded the mandates the Cleveland Clinic put forth and my health would not be worth it.
495,People are freaking out about his hand reflections in the “working” photo too.

505,You only YOLO once
506,We still don't know the true numbers.
507,Pandemics historically have lasted 2-6 years.
508,We are still really uninformed on this virus.
509,We only recently confirmed that you can be reinfected with a nee strain.
510,We don't yet know if you can be reinfected with the same strain.
511,"We don't know if reinfection will be milder than the first time, or will be worse because of the repeat damage to organs."
512,We don't yet know the full extent of damage to the organs.
513,We don't even know the actual amount if dead individuals from this.
514,Literally every single virus we've ever had has had a large delay on us mowing the true number of dead or infected.
515,Also your bus statement is popular but false and has been disproven multiple times.
516,"If it is currently ""24th"" that is while it is still at the beginning, and not everyone has been introduced to it, whereas everything it is being ranked against has been a possibility for everyone."

543,But what's your cut-off point?
544,"How many have to die to make ""new normal"" worth it?"
545,"If we can live with a flu vaccine that isn't 100% effective, given to those who need it, that let's the rest of us carry on as normal, and take the hit with those who sadly die from it as an acceptable loss, then we can do the same with covid."
546,"Why can we accept death by flu, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer, heart disease, and a multitude of other communicable and non-communicable diseases, but death by covid is a complete no-no?"
547,!
548,"Google it, there are multiple sources on this."
549,Two months are impossible to achieve.

552,"Last Friday we had 50 active cases, today we closed out with just shy of 400 active cases."
553,"These numbers aren’t coming from nursing homes, but rather community spread from large gatherings in several local restaurants."
554,"I can’t tell you how many news reports have come out weekly since July asking people to quarantine if they were at X restaurant during a specific time frame, now those reports seem to be daily."
555,"The governor is sending in rapid testing centers, but the timeframe for that is still TBD because we don’t have the labor force to operate the testing sites right now."
556,Our county executive asked everyone to stay home for seven days to combat the outbreak.

561,Sweden has increased testing from about 20k a week in early spring to 140k at the moment.
562,The relatively high CFR of about 6% is due to low testing during the spring.
563,"Also, most countries under count their deaths while Sweden actually over counts them."
564,Looking at excess mortality shows that Sweden is doing pretty well in comparison.

631,Would you abstain from flying ever if you knew your have 1/1000 chance in total that you might die on one of those (not a single flight)?
632,What about driving?
633,"You also have quite significant chance you'll die in an accident at some point, do you abstain of driving at all because of it?"
634,4 weeks?
635,Give it 30 to 31 days!
636,Exactly.
637,"The flu vaccine which is between 40-60% effective, according to the cdc ( https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), is an accepted vaccine that let's the rest of us carry on with our lives."
638,Everyone needs to learn that there's a strong possibility we'll not eradicate this virus (especially not in the first go around with vaccines) and we should see it more as a flu vaccine - protect the vulnerable and the rest won't need to take it.
639,I don't favour that nickname.
640,"It implies he has a profession, and one that might be of some use in the world."
641,"I mean I guess, but (1) we're seeing comparisons of government actions, gov't responses to covid, and societal acceptance would be at best very loosely connected and (2) I don't really see the difference in societal acceptance either."
642,We've never been required to wear masks in public.
643,And no one here does.
644,"People wear masks in buildings, but not in public."
645,"Crowded beaches over the summer, no masks."
646,I donno
647,"They say two weeks to get people on board, but in reality lockdowns usually lasts closer to two months."
648,in my country public election make covid 19 cases increase  from under 20 to 300 .
649,Why is that?
650,It a simple fact of something I’m currently experiencing.
651,I’m not saying you might not know someone who’s been effected.
652,Just a wow I guess my small group of family and friend have chosen career paths that somehow have came out untouched so far.
653,And they all happen to have very diverse career choices.
654,I guess just continue to live in your bubble of victimhood until someone gives your a handout?
655,Cheers mate!
656,Be blessed.
657,It really depends on whether you feel positive about being negative.
658,I don't know why my post shows as in bold.
659,Oh it’s definitely a ploy.
660,Reminds me of the Great Cigarette Scare Ploy that’s been running since the 60s.
661,Ever notice how the people who have bought into doctors’ claim that smoking causes lung cancer and avoid smoking don’t get lung cancer?
662,But the people who ignore doctors’ advice and keep smoking often DO end up with lung cancer?
663,It’s a set-up!
664,"The prblem #1, the governments need to do a great public service campaign about contact tracing and why it's important."
665,I don'tthink too many governments did this.
666,"#2, they need to act early when case loads were small and manageable."
667,"Once the case loads become as large as the US's or UK's, it's difficult no matter what."
668,"#3, the government need to use technology."
669,Manual tracing with big case loads is almost bound to fail.
670,Why is tracing cell phones around infected people such a big taboo?
671,"That info has been collected by cell phone companies, Google, FB..."
672,Governments need to make a legal framework to allow this in emergency situations like a pandemic.
673,"Yeah that is definitely a bug fat lie about r/france’s supposed anti-mask tendency, the sub is heavily pro-masks"
674,Just like the flu-vaccine now then.
675,Which is an accepted vaccine that let's most of us carry on with our lives.
676,Except the 5000 who died and their families I presume
677,Aren't all the countries you listed in among the worst in the entire world for deaths per capita?
678,Not exactly a boost for your argument lol
679,No.
680,They're simply in their Phase 3 trials.
681,There was articles saying that Russia was giving them to everybody but that's not true.

688,Type approach.
689,I would have thought most people would be too intelligent to fall for it but Americans surprise me every day
690,He sent it with his respects to c/o Ronna.
691,Foreign media always have an angle when reporting on Sweden.
692,You won’t see a headline like this in Swedish media.
693,We know that winter is coming.
694,Because it will magically disappear.
695,Many people have a huge problem with delayed gratification and disappointment.
696,"Like, you'd think disappointment was the same as a death sentence for some of them."
697,Both of these personality weaknesses make a person a poor decision maker.
698,Isn't that faxxinating.
699,This *is* a genuine plague.
700,"Since you've failed to answer any of my questions, I'm going to ask you again: *did we lockdown and close everything for ""every other pandemic""?"
701,"Did experts warn us that weren't returning to normal after ""every other pandemic""?"
702,*
703,"That's .4% of the **total population,** not of people that get COVID, not to mention that your own link, right above that, says:

&gt; Ministry of Health statistics are underestimates as they are based on incomplete data   
&gt;  
&gt; The number of deaths by COVID is also an underestimate because only confirmed cases are considered, and because many people die at home or in nursing homes without being tested."
704,"In March, the Community of Madrid estimated 4,260 people have died in nursing homes with coronavirus symptoms (out of 4,750 total deaths in the homes), but only 781 were diagnosed and counted as COVID fatalities."
705,"&gt;  
&gt; At the end of July, the Spanish newspaper [*El País*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa%C3%ADs) reported 44,868 deaths caused by COVID-19, whereas the Government's death toll figure at that moment was 28,000 

Some places in Spain are apparently facing a **10 to 14% death rate** in COVID cases, with the national average apparently being a 7.2% (which I find shockingly high, but whatever, this is *your* source)."
706,"On *top* of that, your figures are only figures of Spain - I'm a bit baffled that you're doing a generalization of how severe COVID is in the entire world based on one country."
707,"So, if by ""0.4% fatality rate"" you mean ""the *entire* population has a 0.4 fatality rate from the pandemic"" then your point is *terrible*; World War II ""only"" saw 2-3% of the whole world die, except that WWII can actually end when people decide it ends."
708,"COVID, meanwhile, is highly infectious and can easily overwhelm medical facilities if left unchecked; these figures are the ones we have *when* we have taken precautions unless you want for literally more than 0.4% of the population to die (god knows how high it will be if it gets out of control)."
709,"You're against general epidemiological consensus here, and your argument against it is pretty weak."
710,capitalism at work baby
711,London UK has been 100% capacity for months now
712,There’s a lot of middle ground between forgetting about covid entirely with no precautions and staying indoors for months on end.
713,You’re young and healthy.
714,"If you catch the virus, the overwhelming possibility is that you’ll be fine, at most a light fever or a cough."
715,"I don’t give a shit how much anecdotal evidence people give about “this young and healthy person got covid and died”, you just hear that because that kind of negative click-baity news gets way more attention than “the overwhelming majority of young, healthy people recover from covid fine”."
716,Of course that changes if you live with elderly or immunocompromised people.
717,"But if not, go out and live your life and stop being so scared of a microscopic chance of death."
718,The amount of fear I see from some people is just disappointing.
719,Go have fun and experience youth while you can.
720,Just be careful.
721,"Wear a mask, socially distance from strangers, quarantine if you have symptoms, and don’t hang out with people if they have symptoms."
722,Absolutely.
723,"If deaths go down and most people go through with mild symptoms, then it truly becomes a bad flu, and we don’t need to panic and close everything down for that."
724,"It’s bad, but we have to understand the difference between bad and catastrophic."
725,"Here's a proof that exponential growth conforms to Benford's law in both continuous and discrete cases

726,I live across from a popular chain pub in London and closing is 10 am.
727,"It was pissing down last night so at 10 pm, all the patrons were forced outside and huddled together in the only dry spot right outside the door for about 15 minutes while waiting for their rides because none of the nonces had brollies even though it had been raining all day."
728,Like... that's probably worse than letting them wait inside at separate tables.
729,Poor half of Michigan.
730,The other half deserve what they get.
731,"Aids still kills about a million of people per year, despite it being present for 30 years now."
732,"Covid has a high chance of being stopped soon with vaccines etc, so hopefully it will turn out to be much smaller pandemy than HIV/AIDS is
If vaccines turn out to be effective, in the longer run even flu will be much more deadly as we are nowhere close to eliminate it as it mutates too quickly (there are 300-600k people dying from flu each year)
Some people really behave like except for covid people aren't dying at all, but actually each day over  150k people die for different reasons"
733,Some.
734,There were a few protests in Berlin regarding the Corona rules.
735,They claimed we live in a dictatorship.
736,The protests were allowed to take place as long as they obey the social distancing and mask rules.
737,Suprisingly they did not obey the rules and the police intervened on multiple occasions.
738,"Some protesters even tried to storm the Reichstag, which is the parliamental building."
739,So yes there are but overall it seems that the rules are obeyed.
740,Actually the Partypeople seem to be more problematic.
741,"I saw, that went viral a while ago."
742,Do you have 0 sarcasm detection?
743,I might be able to explain it to you.
744,"Trump, and those who support him, literally deny science, which means that they deny reality itself."
745,"Science is just watching reality, recording reality, and using that to look for more to reality."
746,That is all science is.
747,"Trump and his followers turn back the clock on human progress in this, but worse, his endorsement of violent and racist groups, his attacks on essential human liberties - especially with regard to queer folk and people of color - and his  dismantling of every system that protects us from the worst that big business can do to us, all cause great grief, suffering, death, and worry."
748,"But worst of all is that over 200,000 of us have died because - even though he admitted that Covid was airborn and deadly to all age groups - he has constantly lied about that fact."
749,"By doing so, and by preventing useful action to save lives, he risks the very fall of America, and possibly civilization itself."
750,"For many of us, the existence of Trump and his spellbinding power over simple minds represents a truly existential risk."
751,"He could very well destroy every aspect of the modern world that is good, or worthwhile, or rational, or sane."
752,Many people would define these actions as absolute evil.
753,Evil on a scale previously unimaginable.
754,"It is difficult to wish for a good outcome for a person who, if they return to power, will destroy your family, your life, your freedom and your nation."
755,"It is difficult not to deeply desire such a threat to vanish entirely, and permanently."
756,"It is only reasonable to want to live in a nation where reason and sanity prevail, where medicine and science can defend us from a particularly slow and terrible death or permanent injury, and where our nation could cease being either a laughing stock or a source of deep pity in the world."
757,Trump stands against getting to have that.
758,"Actually, there are vegetebles, rice and seafood in the usa as well."
759,Folks just choose pizza and hamburgers as it is their right.
760,I wonder if the Secret Service will change his code name to something that better fits him.
761,"How about ""Plague Rat""?"

766,It has.
767,Covid19 has mutated.
768,Well considering what you said has nothing to do with my post I would say you most definitely did.
769,"When people say things like this, I almost wish you could see the horror of a genuine plague."
770,I saw.
771,I made sure to record the game on covideo tape.
772,I quickly glanced through some of the restrictions in Germany and you still seem to have some limits on public gatherings and some venues (e.g.
773,night clubs) are still closed.
774,"Additionally you have quite strict mask rules, which is a good thing."
775,"In my country, everything has been open since summer (including night clubs, bars, cinemas), having indoor and outdoor events with several thousand people is OK and no one wears a mask."
776,There's a recommendation to wear a mask in public transport and shops but in reality maybe 50% wear it in the former and maybe 10% in the latter.
777,Mask usage was not recommended earlier by the public health officials due to insufficient evidence and now they are paying the price for that.
778,"They prefer to use the term ""controlled burn"""
779,So I guess this is the spin.
780,"If you want to retain your sanity, don't read the comments."
781,Have a few friends that commented on this which is how it was brought to my attention.
782,They think this was a ploy by the Democrats since it's Trump and only other Republicans who are infected.
783,"Yea sure, it's a ploy, I'm sure it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that they've all done the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do to prevent catching the virus."
784,Also sure it had nothing to do with one of them catching it and all of them working so closely together and attending that Supreme Court announcement.
785,I wonder why only Republicans caught it.
786,I mean it's been pretty evident that they have no idea how viral transmission/spread works.
787,"I had low expectations for their understanding of that, but like what the fuck man."
788,[https://www.facebook.com/realmarklutchman/photos/a.2024136074497199/2775408796036586/](https://www.facebook.com/realmarklutchman/photos/a.2024136074497199/2775408796036586/)
789,"When your country charges 200 EUR for a test and most people who have the virus over the summer are in the 15 to 25 year old range - of course you're not going to see the cases, but it doesn't mean they are not there."
790,Also Sweden got wrecked compared to their neighbours during the first wave.
791,Now they have an uptick in cases as all the partying youths go home/back to school/to see granny.
792,"Same thing has happened where I live in France, but the lack of discipline of French people and their desire to 'live life normally' (French people eat out at restaurants and go to bars a lot!)"
793,"- well, we see where it is leading us."
794,"The hospitals and the doctors are screaming that things are going bad, but the government is hiding this message and it seldom gets out on Twitter or in local press..."
795,They've already given it to each other.
796,They're on a different viral timeline than the rest of the world.
797,Thank you!
798,"Trump Twitter, my dude."
799,You can find it one one google search to the page.
800,I personally know a group of idiots who caught COVID after doing this
801,Contradictory.
802,Research is contradictory.
803,"I'm guessing **significantly** less than 3x a bad flu year (650000), ie way under 1950000."
804,Probably closer to 2x.
805,Next year it will be a common cold and compete with the flu for the old and frail.
806,"Two years from now we will look back at the hysteria and wonder where everything went so wrong, how we could all collectively lose our minds."
807,Three years from now we'll collectively lose our minds over something else.
808,"Recorded, though."
809,On r/covidlonghaulers there are many people saying they got reinfected.
810,I think it's hard to tell how common it is right now because there was not enough testing available during first wave.
811,I work as an observer from afar and i did a pcr test and followed all precautions amd procedures.
812,I think I'm gomnq cut a mask in circles and put it behind the valve.
813,Air would still coeme through but it'll pass through a piece of surgical mask.
814,I think that's best
815,Post.

837,"Obviously, being sick saps your strength, but the Chief of Staff said his oxygen levels were low on Friday and the doctor implied he had received oxygen at the White House but said he wasn't receiving it at the hospital."
838,My speculation: he has low blood oxygen levels and they've proned him at the hospital.
839,"Keeps in lime with what's being said/unsaid about treatment and symptoms, but allows them to skirt the truth about how serious things are, and also explains why there hasn't been a photo of a thumbs-up Trump smiling in his hospital bed."

843,"I have an aversion to the phrase “new world order” because people who say that always think Jews are behind it, and I like Jewish people so I’m not open to considering that."

849,Tape the valves in case you are asymptomatic and/or tested false negative.
850,"The CDC should have adopted the Japanese social distancing guideline of avoiding close contact in closed-off, crowded spaces (three Cs)."
851,It worked well for Japan.
852,"Realistically though, Americans can’t seem to follow any social distancing or mask guidelines reliably."
853,"You are right, positive test rate is very low, around 1 percentish."
854,Contact tracing still works and only mild local measures are taken here in Germany.
855,Maybe Berlin will forbid alcohol at 22 pm because there is a spike in infections going on.
856,I read that there are some cases among students in Italian schools.
857,"Wow, you have huge second wave compared to the first one."

866,Schools were originally given to the mass public to prepare children for working In factories.
867,In the end parents said let’s Bone.
868,So they are responsible.
869,It has never been society’s job to raise your child.
870,It has always been the parents job.
871,You should never count on someone else to raise your child.
872,People need to base their decisions on what you can do.
873,Like our budget has always included money for child care in case something happens and our kids can’t go to a school but we still need to.
874,"We use that money in other places like family vacation, but when we talked about having more kids, bought our house go over our budget we always put in daycare expense."
875,Thankfully we don’t have to use it still because we are home just about 24/7 due to so many people getting sick.
876,Kids are more likely to be carriers and actually are found to have more of the virus in their system than adults.
877,So why you would want to expose your kid to that I don’t understand.
878,The Federal government had two jobs originally 1.
879,Foreign trade 2.
880,Foreign war.
881,Today they do so much more so they justify their size and amount of money they need.
882,People should never rely on the government to take care of them or their families.
883,You always need back up plans and if the government is their grate it’s extra but your main plan should never be for someone else to take care of you.
884,My wife and i have plans for the major what ifs.
885,What if we both loose our job and can’t find a new one in our area?
886,What if our current day care closes?
887,What if one of us passes away?
888,We are not prepared for zombie apocalypse type stuff.
889,We are however prepared for everyday things.
890,Yes we could of bought a bigger house.
891,Instead we bought well within our budget and use extra to expand our house turning our dinning room in to a full other bedroom.
892,Test yourself everyday for a virus with a mortality rate we’ll below 1%?
893,Sounds fun where do I sign up!
894,Does it comes with a free mask and hand sanitizer?
895,There’s plenty of data that suicides go down during economic downturns.
896,We’re working ourselves to death.
897,[removed]
898,I'd be interested to know how much income tax bars bring in for the economy vs how much the government is spending on all the additional coronavirus cases that occur from it.
899,He’s the president and is obviously in charge.
900,He’s ignored protocols for 4 years and the Secret Service hasn’t snatched his iPhone yet.
901,Making stupid political points and manipulating the media is kinda his thing.
902,It is only necessary when ICU capacity is reached.
903,"But local lockdowns are more effective, like in Melbourne."
904,We in Germany do limit max.
905,numbers of private parties in public halls (not at home) when a city or district reaches too much infections in 7 days.
906,But no lockdown is planned here because it is not effective and we have federal governments which can do what they want.
907,"The WHY is because the masks are to stop you from spreading sickness, not to stop you from catching it."
908,Having a valve that allows your breath to exit defeats this purpose.
909,"This is a problem because a large number of people who catch the virus are not showing symptoms, but can still spread it."
910,You wouldn't know if you're sick one day to the next unless tested every day.
911,"The CDC does not recommend any masks with outlet valves, like the ones on N95s people use for spray foam and hazard removal."
912,"Well, the US has not been stable in the last 4 years... Quite a few people are actually glad if Trump is not in the White House and screwing things up and are hopeful that Trump's forced vacation gives some break of sanity to the world at large."
913,What the fuck is this shit?
914,Or a country with 1.5billion population and land size of US
915,The link to a Bing search for Coronavirus was a nice touch.
916,Ah no.
917,☹
918,"Yes and no, even if deaths lag, this situation has been above 10000 cases for almost a month, I think the deaths would have caught up at this point."
919,Is that proof that immunity does exist?
920,You're obviously a loner who hasn't had anybody in your life get covid.
921,"So unfortunately until either you get it or someone in your immediate family gets it, you won't believe science."
922,Which means you are using conspiracy theories to explain this pandemic.
923,There would be no pandemic if world leaders would let people live their lives.
924,In roughly 6 months time they already forcibly closed down millions of small businesses forever.
925,"Overdoses, crime, unemployment, suicides are all way up."
926,But no big deal right?
927,Just keep extending mask mandates and social distancing requirements every 30 or so days so it seems like there is light at the end of the tunnel.
928,"People need to wake up and not accept this as the new norm, because that’s exactly what it is."
929,I am taking things in two week stretches.
930,"There’s no way I think into the winter (even though realistically, yes, I agree with his assessment.)"
931,"No, thanks."
932,Let people take care of themselves.
933,Lockdowns are retarded.
934,"Psst, the person you’re replying to agrees with you."
935,They’re saying that shaming anti-maskers and refusing them service is part of learning to live with the virus.

1048,We've been that way as a society for a while but this virus is just making everyone double down on stupidity because they probably dont know how to cope with the stress otherwise.
1049,Wearing a mask is viewed by some as being controlled.
1050,It’s this arrogant stance of: it’s my right to choose to wear a mask and I’m not gonna let them tell me what to do!
1051,I think they see us mask wearers as fearful and letting government dictate our actions because they think we are a sheep.

1056,I do get that there are people who try to blame it all on China and not take any responsibility for their country's handling of it but I don't think it has to be an either/or.
1057,"This was all in reference to the first comment that said fuck these wet markets and then defending wet markets, so my point was that I think we can do all of those things, like be honest about this kind of wet market and how China has failed to ban them, but also be harsh on our terrible science denying leaders and end all deforestation in the world and be harsh on the fake news that came from Russia saying masks were bad and the bullying of mask wearers by Donald Trump, as well as all his other lies and disregarding facts."

1079,Lots of people in denial where I'm at.
1080,And the other way around too.
1081,They are all a bunch of zealots for their cause.
1082,The mask debate is a result of a split between risk tolerance and acceptance.
1083,"When some people, for whatever reason, think differently about their own risk and that of society they'll have a conflict."
1084,"For example I would personally take a lot more risk, I think achieving herd immunity within a very specific subset of the population is beneficial to resolving this quickly."
1085,Other people think every case and death is one too many and we should do literally everything to stop it.
1086,"Now I am not unreasonable, so I will take into consideration that there needs to be a middle ground."
1087,"I personally am responsible for a R &lt; 1, it is nearly impossible that my behavior is causing any sort of spread that accelerates infections."
1088,"However, there are also people who think that unmitigated spread is fine and they will stick with their absolutes and become big spreaders."
1089,"Then there are those that will tell others to restrict their social life, freedom and put on masks, which starts to annoy the more moderate population of the risk-takers who then stop cooperating."
1090,"People realize that they can't change the behavior of other people, so they try to force masks on others or they make a point in not wearing a mask ever."
1091,"The root cause of the argument isn't the masks, they will never solve the problem, it's about the difference in opinion about the risk and what should be allowed and what not."
1092,It's like the political system.
1093,So many people are unwilling to accept a middle ground that they defend their absolute extreme position to the last breath.
1094,I tried to follow them but could not stand it for long.
1095,I don't know what they are like now but at the time they were obssessively hating on trans folk.

1262,They barely have new ideas of their own so their only new ones come from opposition of whatever democrats want.
1263,"Kind of poetic, really."
1264,♥️
1265,That is true.
1266,Children are much more susceptible to influenza in comparison.
1267,But they represent a small enough part of the total sample that my above statement is still true.
1268,"For me, it was fun!"
1269,"I got to hear about the misadventures of calf castration from the animal dairy science majors, the woes and misery of the computer science majors, got cheap plants from the horticulture majors, and met my future husband who had started graduate studies in education while I was finishing up my senior year in undergraduate school studying technical writing."
1270,"We break out into other areas of common interest besides academic, like sports or clubs."
1271,My best friend was the goalie for the lacrosse team.
1272,i mean so is the NFL lol
1273,I feel bad because sometimes I’ve been eating out.
1274,Maybe have eaten out 10 times since March and I’m talking sitting down and eating on a patio or “social distanced” restaurant setup.
1275,Then I see people like this.
1276,I’ve been working from home since my company said we would be WFH for two weeks back at the end of March.
1277,"I haven’t seen any of my coworkers since then, besides on a google hangout call."
1278,Thank you for posting.
1279,I had a baby just as the pandemic was kicking off and I’m motivated to keep breastfeeding by this news.
1280,"Right, you'll never again see another case of COVID-19 in Melbourne."
1281,"I agree that the POTUS needs the best treatment at hand, but have you seen the ""presidential suite"" at Walter Reed?"
1282,Completely unnecessary.
1283,"President or not, no one needs that kind of opulence for medical treatments."
1284,This can't be emphasized enough.
1285,Putin has power and money because the Soviet Union failed.
1286,That's Trump's goal here - the failure of the US helps him and other rich people strip it for parts.
1287,Everyone appointed to their departments was done so to help it fail.
1288,Making the USPS fail = good for private shipping.
1289,Making national parks fail = selling off pieces of them to strip mined/drilled for oil.
1290,Making the border worse = record profits for private prison companies.
1291,Not fixing health care + a pandemic has been great for medical stocks.
1292,And so on...
1293,Judges interpret the law.
1294,Emergency orders aren’t indefinite by decree for good reason.
1295,"Yeah, but when the death metrics is spiking it is kind of late to do anything about it."

1298,"[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/)

It's been among the lowest number of infected per capita in Europe since mid July."
1299,"Most people live in cities, where density is similar to other countries."
1300,Look its better than what ever the hell it is we are seeing in Sweden.
1301,Atleast the *goverment* and *leading god damn experts* arent the ones trying to still claim masks are useless.
1302,Another awesome technology we will never hear about again.
1303,It’s because Trump didn’t wear one.
1304,He said he didn’t want to.
1305,"That’s the long and short of it, really."
1306,that’s not what reactionary means
1307,9335.63 infected per capita.
1308,"More then: germany, france, ireland, bosnia herzigowina, portugal, malta, kosovo, United kingdom, netherlands, Romania, switzerland, czechia, italy, austria, ukraine, albania, denmark, croatia, serbia, Liechtenstein, bulgaria, norway, slovakia, estonia, hungary, poland, finnland, greece, etc."
1309,"(Only wrote european atm)

Idk didn t look like the lowest."
1310,Isn t one of the lowest...
1311,"Source: https://www.who.int/countries/swe/ for per capita, for comparing i used another site but go on..."
1312,If Trump actually executed that plan to send everyone in America masks through the USPS?
1313,He wins 40 states next month.
1314,Atlanta?
1315,"If so, your Governor is insane."
1316,&gt;	Their only actual accomplishment was funneling tax dollars out of the government and into their...
1317,Pockets.
1318,Surprise!
1319,That was really their only goal.
1320,Everything else was a means to get there.
1321,Be the bigger person
1322,Shut up death cultist.
1323,I have thought a lot about this.
1324,"I believe that Trump’s initial downplaying of the seriousness of the virus sparked the anti-mask movement both in the Republican Party, and consequently in their supporters."
1325,"Once he took that (incredibly short-sighted) stance on the coronavirus, his entire political identity mandated that he double down, again and again and again, no matter what evidence arose that this is, in fact, a very serious health crisis."
1326,Wearing a mask is a visible admission that there’s something wrong.
1327,Something we need to worry about.
1328,"By extension, it is a visible admission that Trump was wrong (or lying, as we now know to be the case)."
1329,"So every mask they see is a reminder that Trump f**ked up, and is not doing his job in keeping people safe."
1330,This is a totally unacceptable narrative.
1331,Masks enrage them because they’re a visual cue that their whole worldview is incorrect.
1332,It wouldn’t work for America at this point in time.
1333,"You don’t have to be, and yet many many are"
1334,"Thanks, I think me, my dad and my sister will also take a test but I'm not entirely sure because, either way we'll have to stay isolated for 14 days"
1335,[removed]
1336,This!
1337,"He could have said ""Out of respect for the President's privacy, we won't be able to comment on that right now."""
1338,"And it would have been fine, instead he chose to skirt around specifics by being weirdly more specific and ended up sounding like more of a liar in the process."
1339,It's strange that after 7+ months people are struggling to stay home isolated?
1340,Maximum?
1341,What exactly is maximum?
1342,We have a package of that awful Scott’s single ply - I hope we never have to use it but I guess we’d be grateful for it if that’s all we had!
1343,"You know, when a cartoon character or a kid in a terrible sitcom sticks his fingers in his ears and says “Blah blah blah” when he’s told something he doesn’t WANT to hear?"
1344,That is this administration.
1345,"If you imagine Trump doing this every time anything about science is mentioned, it makes much more sense."
1346,"Also helps to imagine Trump as a self-obsessed, very selfish 4-year-old."
1347,The action was a a sitcom cliche — it’s just hard to understand it coming from the president of the United States.
1348,But that’s where we are right now.
1349,"If you’ve ever been a parent, remember how your child’s most annoying, ill-disciplined playmate acted as a toddler."
1350,Expect nothing else from this White House.
1351,It will still be depressing — it’ll just stop bent confusing or surprising.
1352,[removed]
1353,So my odds are 1 in 8000 for dying every month.
1354,So I  am not worried about dying.
1355,But what about these other situations that most of us are probably more concerned about.
1356,1.
1357,"What are my odds for catching it, recovering quickly, with no lasting side effects?"
1358,2.
1359,"What are my odds for catching it, long recovery at home, and having permanent cardiovascular damage?"
1360,3.
1361,"What are my odds for catching it, long recovery in a hospital with expensive bill,  and still having long term side effects?"
1362,Reading Docs tweeting and my laymen guess are best case scenario they're overtreating (bad) because VIP and worse case scenario is that scans showing pneumonia so they are shifting from supporting immune response to blunting immune response to hopefully avoid c-storm (worse).
1363,"Regardless of politics, now is time to say a prayer."
1364,"If nothing else, the worst would be a trama the nation (a) hasn't seen since Kennedy and (b) doesn't need during a plague and Great Recession 2."
1365,PhDs in history and literature?
1366,There is a hell of a lot of speculation but much of it is informed by science.
1367,If the WH came out with statements that made sense this would be happening considerably less
1368,"My girlfriend had an ambulance ride 1 block, literally one block I'm not exaggerating, to the hospital and they charged $1500"
1369,This is correct.
1370,It's a podcast by a bunch of virologists.
1371,I'm not a huge fan of generalizing for the sake of convenience.
1372,With our current political climate we've seen the damage that can be done with bipartisan politics and a lack of collaboration.
1373,I think using rhetoric as you've outlined only adds fuel to the fire.
1374,You can say it's just hyperbole but being more direct eliminates the need for proper interpretation.
1375,That's been the M.O.
1376,"for a long time, friend."
1377,Good on you for coming up with it on your own.
1378,"But yeah, you're spot on."
1379,"Antibodies are a poor indicator, especially with SARS where some of the antibodies helped the virus rather than neutralizing it..."
1380,They'll lose money by reducing capacity.
1381,"Capacity will stay the same, masks may not be required but a lot of people will be wearing them anyways."
1382,Good luck dude.
1383,Just saying though your family might be safe.
1384,"I came back from college, tested positive in a household with even my grandparents, and nobody ended up getting it."
1385,The household transmission rate is around 20%.
1386,Id just go get a test in a few days.
1387,"Is it 5 days for ""maximum opportunity for accurate result"" or is it just the earliest point where you have a decent chance of getting an accurate result?"
1388,"Isn't the range from 5-14 days, depending on the individual?"
1389,Which would mean 5 could still deliver a fair number of false negatives?
1390,I could be misunderstanding.
1391,If somebody knows better and has a source please correct me.
1392,I'll do some digging when I get a chance and update if I find anything myself.
1393,That is exactly what seems to be happening and it’s insanely frustrating that they are turning issues that should be non-partisan into partisan issues.
1394,"Here you go: https://en.mercopress.com/2019/12/06/argentina-surveys-indicate-40.8-of-the-population-lives-below-the-poverty-line

1396,I don’t remember hearing that.
1397,The first news break was that Hope Hicks had tested positive.
1398,The next news break was Trump tweeting he and FLOTUS had also tested positive.
1399,Numerous news outlets have conducted their own investigation indicating he had symptom as early as Wednesday or possibly even before that... but it’s all speculation.
1400,At this point it would be easy to argue he isn’t fit to lead.
1401,No risk of him nuking the world.
1402,It hasn't mutated in a way that creates antigenic mis-match issues like we have with influenza viruses
1403,[removed]
1404,Misused?
1405,I caught this too.
1406,He's entirely dependent/reliant on his image and brand in the media to keep him healthy.
1407,"If he see's negative coverage of himself he'll fall into a depression and give up, or have a heart attack, ect."
1408,What would even happen if you took the tv away to give him a break from it?
1409,People have been asking him to be better for decades.
1410,Doesn't seem to be working.
1411,How do you define immunity when the virus wasn't around long enough for immunity to wake and people to be reinfected?
1412,Antibodies?

1422,"Last week, one of her colleagues was tested positive but had no symptoms and my mom was tested negative, also having no symptoms."
1423,"This Wednesday, my dad started feeling sick and we all assumed he would be positive as he would always do the shopping for us."
1424,"Me, my sister and my mom all keep the distance and he was wearing a mask when we would be in the same room."
1425,"With all that we weren't 100% safe and, on Friday, my mom also started feeling sick."
1426,"As for my sister, she is completly fine, showing no symptoms and as for me, I just have a runny nose, no other symptoms."
1427,"My mom went to the hospital today and, as we all assumed, she tested positive, meaning that she, along with my dad and probably me and my sister, are all positive."
1428,"I'm not scared or anything, my dad is feeling better as the days go by at the point where he is feeling better then my mom."
1429,We don't have any other disease so we aren't really worried.
1430,"We will all stay in isolation for 14 days, my school and my sister's school is online anyway and we have enough food and the other things we need."

About that?"
1435,"Hi,
I am required to teach to 20 persons for all day (long company seminar)."
1436,Test positivity ratio is almost 9% where I am.
1437,This means statistically 1 or 2 of those persons will be infected.
1438,I wonder what are my chances of NOT catching covid19 if everybody wears a mask and we open the doors / windows with regular intervals.
1439,I checked Google to find some statistics but it seems scientists do not agree on the airborn nature of spreading.

1520,"You might instead search for an object by its ID, which is quick but is only 90% likely to be unique, then you might use a full hash of the object to search but then it's too specific and you can't find it even if it changed just a tiny bit."
1521,You can find a more complicated method but then it takes a week to do.
1522,"Also in biochemistry you have to worry about your algorithm being like ""well this isn't the right ID but it's colder than normal and I am a little too old so fuck it I'll return it anyway""  or like ""hey this guy has random stuff in his blood so now I am not gonna return anything no matter what""

1586,I'm any case through all the research I've done on coronaviruses something people are really missing is how much the innate immune response matters with these.
1587,Everyone is focusing on the adaptive immune response which altogether does not appear to create lasting protection from coronavirus infections.
1588,"Also yes, many antibodies made in response to infections do circulate for at least a very long time, which is why you can be tested for ""immunity"" to the components of the MMR vaccine to determine if you need a booster dose."

1601,So much for my body my choice.
1602,The problem with this is that none of it is supported by any evidence.
1603,It's just what people keep telling each other.
1604,"Distrust in others and a belief that their views are not even valid is the biggest problem on the internet right now, and in society period."
1605,"He is in hospital so he can be monitored and receive immediate care as a precaution, regardless of the severity."
1606,Makes sense given the circumstances.
1607,"Yeah, I’ll need some clarification on this please."
1608,There's a difference between being anti-mask and pro-opening.

1621,Who is blaming healthy people?
1622,Your comprehension of that comment is so bizarre.
1623,"Yeah, I've been harping on this forever while people circle jerk about concerts and vaccines."
1624,No.
1625,I did not say that.
1626,"However, at some point the pandemic will end."
1627,The virusbis likely with us forever.
1628,"Just like the flu from 1918 is still with us, today."
1629,"However, if the math and history are anything to go by, the virus will evolve to be less lethal."
1630,Like it has happened before.
1631,How do we know she lied to her exactly?
1632,I’ve seen that said a lot but her tictok doesn’t say that and the timing is too close together for me to have put 2 and 2 together like that to be able to definitively made that conclusion.
1633,If there is something that backs this up then I apologize and I’d like to know so I can jump on the hate train.
1634,Not that I don’t already have enough disdain for her for other reasons.
1635,"I personally know a 17 year old active, healthy person who caught it."
1636,She has been out of school for weeks too sick and fatigued to even do work online.
1637,"She told me that at one point she was so, so sick that she accepted she was going to die."
1638,"She is slowly getting better now, but she is so very weak."
1639,She was already thin and has lost so much weight she now looks downright frail.
1640,She gets winded walking down the hallway.
1641,She is actually afraid that she might have to change her career goals due to possible long-term effects.
1642,Her words to me: “Tell everyone you know the precautions are worth it.
1643,You don’t want to roll the dice with this disease.”
1644,"Bro, Trump is 74 years old tested positive for covid 3 days ago and he's fine."
1645,In fact he's driving around the hospital waving at everyone.
1646,Covids not that bad.
1647,Only a flat earther would believe the nation had to shut down
1648,"So it was to appease Trump, like just about everything done there right now."
1649,Record profits but attendance has been down for years and years.
1650,They're just charging more than ever and finding gimmicks like 3D to charge more
1651,The people who really know will not say out of confidentiality/national security or will paint it as positively for Trump as possible to appease Trump.
1652,"Thus official reports are saying he is in great health, however journalists know that Trump lies and exaggerates regularly so they have been pushing for more details/evidence and some of the pieces paint a different picture then the official statements."
1653,Unfortunately the public really won't know how bad it is until Trump recovers or stays in the hospital longer.
1654,"I'm just hoping that we can get a vaccine that reduces the ""long hauler"" issue that has been a big problem with the disease."
1655,&gt;Are there any other candidates as far along as Moderna's that could possibly have an EUA before the election?
1656,"Pfizer and AstraZeneka/Oxford are ahead of Moderna, although I have no idea when exactly an EUA is expected."
1657,"I'm pro-vaccine and depending on what you asked me exactly, I wouldn't get the covid vaccine."
1658,I have zero faith in this administration to properly vet it and not rush anything that seems okay on the surface through.
1659,We already have historical examples of what happens when a vaccine doesn't test thoroughly for enough demographics and it isn't pretty.
1660,No thanks.
1661,"Maybe something vetted by other nations I'll take, but even then I'd be skeptical about getting it because I wouldn't be sure I could trust American manufacturers of the vaccine to do to right or distribute it correctly."
1662,See: the cluster that was the first round of covid test kits.
1663,Wait till someone finds out they put the toilet paper on backwards.
1664,"Trump know how deadly this virus is back in feb, he play it down so it won't ruin his election chances"
1665,Bots display a lot of brigading behavior but unlike brigading there's no originating post to tie the behavior to.
1666,So if you see a ton of downvotes on a new comment or thread especially when correlated to one PoV it's likely bots.
1667,Naturally generated downvotes roll in over time as the post gains traction.
1668,Most people aren't constantly lurking new posts in large numbers downvoting.
1669,Pretty valid calling out heavily downvoting immediately after posting.
1670,A comment that disagrees with you likely isn't a bot just because it disagrees.

1683,"When challenged to put your money where your mouth is or, well, have some basic empathy (which you simultaneously seem to have no problem accusing people of lacking) rather than address anything I said first you feign ignorance as to what I'm talking about, and then declare victory on the basis of your completely incorrect application of a tu quoque fallacy."

1706,"From the first article you listed:

&gt;The majority of patients reported improvements in the initial symptoms of fever, cough and loss of sense of smell, and most had no evidence of lung scarring or reductions in lung function."
1707,Not to mention studies that show that lungs can [repair themselves in three months.
1708,](https://www.medicircle.in/research-reports-post-covid-lungs-can-repair-themselves-in-3-months).

1719,It’s absurd.
1720,I understand what a bot is.
1721,I think you missed the point of my comment.
1722,The thing I find disturbing most is their 'rule by proclamation' BS.
1723,They went so far as shutting down the government for months instead of simply drafting border wall legislation and sending it to committee like all legislation happens.
1724,"At the end their 'compromise' was exactly this, that they would send border wall legislation to committee."
1725,And then what?
1726,"Nothing, they didn't even do it."
1727,Seems more like the entire thing was an exercise in forcefully ruling by proclamation.
1728,And the entire 'right' supported them and chastised the democrats for pushing back on this even if it meant a prolonged government shutdown.
1729,"But if one of the parties is attempting to completely circumvent the legislative process and essentially 'legislate' by decree/proclamation and won't back down, what option is there?"
1730,many pharmacies in the US are giving them for free this year (at least worth checking).

1733,Not to mention people aren’t even policing simple things like masks.

1735,"Yes, people abuse and misunderstand herd immunity and think it's going to be gone and no one can be infected anymore."
1736,Not much that is safe to inhale.

Trump falls into a high risk category (over 65, overweight, exhibiting signs of undisclosed preexisting conditions) and if the information that is being released is true (like that hes already recovering well and might even be released as early as monday [AP and NPR]) i think it says a lot about whats really going on here."
1742,My meaning: we have the resources and knowledge to save more lives but we're picking and choosing who gets which treatments.
1743,This is already kind of displayed with the absurd difference in quality of care and fatalities between low and high income communities.
1744,"The ""elite"" already have abused their testing resources and theyll do the same with treatment."
1745,"I dont wish death on the president but i think if this plays out the way it seems it is, its a brazen display of american inequality."
1746,Just my opinion and i mean no disrespect.
1747,"Also, to those of you gathering in massive groups, still for some reason unmasked, to show your support... use your freaking heads."
1748,Show your respect and support but try doing it in a way that isnt going to just continue to spread this virus that your party has constantly downplayed.

1764,"It’s a sign of extreme insecurity amongst the party and it’s members, their fragile egos can’t handle doing it, it’s not that they have anything against masks directly, that’s just the superficial shield their argument has become, in reality they’re scared of other republicans to see them wearing masks and then as such being confused for liberals."
1765,"They literally care more about what other members of their own party thinks of them (friends, neighbors etc) than those very same people’s (and their own) health and well being."
1766,I’ve seen republicans wear masks because it’s mandated to get in somewhere and then as soon as they see someone else they embarrassingly take it off quickly.

1772,"And if the stock market becomes less profitable, the Millionaires and Billionaires will lose money."
1773,"And if the Millionaires and Billionaires lose money, they will give less money to the GOP."
1774,"And if the GOP has less money, they will lose power."
1775,"So to not lose power, the GOP needs to keep you from thinking the coronavirus is dangerous."
1776,"And to keep you from thinking coronavirus is dangerous, they pretend that masks aren’t necessary."
1777,"Because at the end of the day, Conservatives think only of themselves, and only worry about things they think they can control, because externalities aren’t “themselves”."

1805,The test is a screening measure to find some/most cases.
1806,It doesnt mean everyone is negative.
1807,It isn’t a substitute for masks.
1808,My girlfriend who went to a funeral basically had to be the mask-and-distancing police there.
1809,She hated doing it but her own parents are high risk and no one else was going to do it.
1810,"For a different event, I have heard that someone stood by to door handing out masks to everyone who was not wearing one and remaining people to distance as they arrived."

1870,I think it's because people are mistaking common knowledge with common sense.
1871,It is common knowledge that there Earth is round.
1872,"Common sense (simple, quick, and unresearched thinking) would point to the Earth being flat."

1901,"I am in a major city and all of them are experiencing surges in cases, even correcting for population numbers."

1908,Is that somehow supposed to be an answer to my request?
1909,Because there’s some dots need connecting.
1910,"The coronavirus had already killed Nieves Salas Solis' mother and brother when he called his daughter from a hospital bed with a chilling message: ""I'm next."""

1932,"The incubation period is up to 2 weeks where people can catch the virus, be contagious and spreading it, yet have no symptoms."
1933,That's why the self-quarantine period is 2 weeks if you get exposed.
1934,That's different from asymptomatic carriers--those who have passed the incubation period but symptoms that are so mild that they don't even realize they're sick.
1935,&gt;Their only actual accomplishment was funneling tax dollars out of the government and into their interests with zero policy promises kept.

1965,Socialism is bad.
1966,"I don't think this particular virus cares about seasons unlike influenza.We have come through winter with zero.Zero community cases in over 175 days.Plenty of cases over the border and arriving on cargo ships and at the airport but they get put in mandatory quarantine for minimum of fourteen days .The states revenue production is well over a hundred billion for the year,the population has never been more united politically  ,the vibes are good and life is sweet.The only issue is the push from outside Western Australia to open our borders ."
1967,"But I can't breathe/cum when i'm wearing condoms/masks

Not wearing masks/condoms feels better

Even if you make me wear masks/condoms I'll just stealth in the middle of sex"
1968,Ouuuuch!
1969,This one place is doing 7% of the testing in the US.
1970,We need many more labs like this one.
1971,Orange County is ridiculous.
1972,"The surrounding areas like LA are a bit more careful, but indoor dining and gyms are open again, parks and beaches are crowded, freeways and streets are packed to Before Time levels."
1973,"The stores that require masks still occasionally get stormed by people freaking out about it, and distancing isn't really a thing anymore."
1974,"People who stay in/wear masks all the time when out (me, I have asthma) get shamed for it."
1975,"I’m saying that the initial effort to contact trace returning travelers from Italy, China and Iran as well as Austria later on, was successful."
1976,Despite that community transmission was detected around March 6 and by March 11 it was pretty clear that a major outbreak was happening.
1977,"It was later discovered, through genetic analysis, that the community spread had been started by travelers returning from countries that had no known cases at the time like UK, Netherlands and US."
1978,"He's the physician to the president which, as far as I'm concerned, makes him more political operative than physician."
1979,I doubt he got his job because his medical acuity outshined every other candidate's.
1980,"Dont worry, parts of america will soon look the same."
1981,"Being in a walk of life where you'd even know how to get invited to a Trump event, let alone a ""fund raiser"", is something I can't comprehend."
1982,"No, you are changing the subject."
1983,I didn't talk about human psychology because that wasn't the point.
1984,"I said that there is no reason for a concept of God to exist, I didn't say there is no reason for spirituality."
1985,Those are two different things.
1986,"There is a psychological reason for santa claus to exist, it doesn't make him any real."
1987,Fellow Georgian?
1988,This is an unimaginably bleak outlook.
1989,If they’re willing to go to such extremes why even admit he has the virus in the first place?
1990,It's one of the most divisive issues in Israel atm
1991,There are basically no Conservative Jews in Israel.
1992,"They're not even recognized as a legitimate denomination, can't perform legally-binding wedding ceremonies, and so on."
1993,It's mostly an American thing.
1994,"Like the Reform Jews, but smaller and less famous."
1995,"Although, considering you didn't capitalize ""conservative"" there, you might be talking about some other denomination, like the Modern Orthodox (who don't oppose any anti-COVID measures)."
1996,"Or simply Republican Jews, in which case it's just irrelevant to the Israeli situation."
1997,"Incidentally, essentially all Jews in Israel, including many of the atheist ones, are technically ""Orthodox""."
1998,Kinda like essentially all Greeks are Orthodox.
1999,"It's not simply synonymous with ""religious"" or ""Haredi""."
2000,Why is trump’s medical team saying he is doing so well and possibly going to send him home tomorrow when I thought covid doesn’t get really bad until around the second week?
2001,"This, and the ""if you don't feel sick you're fine"" issue, in a virus that can be infectious days before you develop symptoms, if you even do."
2002,"At my work they barely do temperature checks, and we know they aren't even reliable with the forehead thing."
2003,And it won't catch pre-symptomatics.
2004,"Meanwhile, several people have stopped wearing masks, and only a few people even wear them over their nose."
2005,This will do very little to stop the spread of the virus.
2006,"It will work for those areas in the short term but it will inevitably increase it in other areas, people will just go there instead of staying in the increased areas."
2007,"You know how easy it is to just hop on a train, ride a bike, or take a cab?"
2008,It's not.
2009,"Also, I really doubt that they're going to want to close down again."
2010,This is really going to be a tough call
2011,Go Australia 🇦🇺 Go Victoria!
2012,"Yes, I was vascillinating whether to add that but I thought the comment was long enough."
2013,"Public libraries have a similar challenge, their mission (and funding) is also being diluted to serve social needs outside of their capabilities."
2014,Investment in multiple social services is long overdue.
2015,This is the correct answer.

2019,Still working on the tower of litter for my 4 legged kids.
2020,It's harder to stack cuz it's so heavy :-)
2021,"95 percent of my body is already covered in (insert, shirts, shoes, socks, sweater, underwear, sweaters, coats, scarfs, hats, gloves, etc."
2022,But be damn fucking sure when I'm not wearing a scarf or face covering I'm going to protest a mask because I don't want my mouth covered!
2023,Also no more rolling into the pillow at night!
2024,Let's get real fucking brainwashed with this whole idea.
2025,Masks are not political.
2026,America please wake up and just let us respect you again at some point in the future
2027,Are they breaking up these large gatherings of Hasidic Jews?
2028,Or just letting them occur?
2029,I need a stimulus check in order to buy tp though.
2030,How to live their lives?
2031,"Like, if you wear a mask you and others stand a better chance of being alive when the pandemic is over?"
2032,Personal freedom to be as stupid as you want ends (or ought to) when you endanger people around you.
2033,Because they are extremely selfish people.
2034,The rose garden had its revenge after what Melania did to it.
2035," Imagine never using condoms and going out and having unprotected sex every day

Then thinking that the solution to your decisions in life is to have constant STD screenings."
2036,"Every time your STD screening ""passes"" you think that means it's because your decision not to wear condoms was a good one."
2037,Wear fucking condoms.
2038,What’s crazy to me is 30% of Montana’s total cases have been in the last 14 days.

2047,I feel it.
2048,Here in northern CA my outlet was going on long evening walks.
2049,"But it’s been smokey for the last two months, I’ve only been able to have two days of anything outdoors."
2050,"On top of COVID, everything else you mentioned is very tiring."
2051,"A little bit misleading to suggest that everyone gets access to remdes as it is in short supply, especially outside the US."
2052,"Also, while ICU rounding is multidisciplinary, there aren't often a handful of docs unless you're counting fellows and residents."
2053,"Also, the average person not even on O2 let alone hiflow/bipap/vented, not on pressors etc would not be in ICU."
2054,Regarding the regeneron mAb I can only assume he pushed for it himself otherwise I totally agree that it was crazy to give it to him.
2055,&gt; he had a 95 day stretch where she didn’t leave the house at all.
2056,That is insane.
2057,Does she not take walks or something?
2058,I’m new to this subreddit but seems like this question would fit here fine!
2059,"So, I have been having some type of sore throat since Wednesday, although it came and went so I figured it might just be allergies or something similar (honestly I get sore throat a lot, probably for different reasons)."
2060,"I did notice though that I was unusually tired ever since that day too, like I could wake up from 9 hours of sleep and feel like staying in bed."
2061,I kept doing my normal stuff anyway.
2062,"On Friday night though, the sore throat would not go away and swallowing became painful."
2063,On Saturday morning I decided to take a look into my mouth and noticed I had white coating on my tonsils.
2064,"I called a nurse and she told me to go to the ER Sunday morning, that it sounded like a strep throat."
2065,I went this morning and they took the quick throat culture test but it was negative.
2066,"The doctor said that my symptoms suggested that I probably just have some viral infection in my throat, but she sent me to COVID test anyway."
2067,"I had it this morning and now I’m quarantining at least until I hear the results, which should be in a couple of days."
2068,"I don’t really have a cough, no unusual digestive issues (btw I thought I might have had mild for of COVID back in March, I experienced GI symptoms after eating and had fever, extreme fatigue but it was all very fast and over in a few days so it’s hard to say, I did not get tested back then), no fever although I feel dehydrated despite drinking a normal amount."
2069,"My main symptoms are sore throat and the pain while swallowing, the white coating on my tonsils, extreme fatigue and muscles get tired easily."
2070,"I also noticed today that although I do not have a cough, whenever I wake up I feel like coughing for a while, I have no idea what that is about because that has never happened to me before."
2071,I wonder if it counts as shortness of breath?
2072,"I brought this up to my mom (I live and am quarantining alone but was messaging with her) and she said that maybe it’s because the phlegm travels up in that position, but the thing is that I do not have any phlegm, which made me consider if this counts as a dry cough."
2073,"I do not have it when I’m upright though or even if I have been lying in bed awake, it just seems to happen when I wake up."
2074,"I wonder if it could be that my throat is swollen and I can’t quite breathe properly while asleep, and when I wake up it comes out as coughing?"
2075,No idea if that is a thing though.
2076,I’m mainly just wondering about the likelihood of this actually being COVID instead of viral tonsillitis or something similar?
2077,Has anyone experienced the white coating along with their COVID symptoms?
2078,"I have not seen that talked about so that might suggest that I am actually dealing with some type of tonsillitis, but I can’t know for sure for a couple days."
2079,It would be interesting to hear your opinions though so maybe I know how to prepare if I do actually have COVID.
2080,"If it helps, I’m a 26-year-old female, I have a chronic illness but it’s not one that is considered a risk factor as far as I’m aware."
2081,I am borderline underweight though and struggle with an eating disorder so my immune system is not optimal.
2082,"Thank you for reading, I would truly appreciate any opinions or experiences people here have to share about my particular symptoms and this situation."
2083,"Edit: I actually felt ill the week before already, but it sort of went away and I felt more normal for about a week before my sore throat started this past Wednesday."
2084,"At no point though have I had a fever as far as I am aware (tho I have not measured it every time I felt sick), I think I forgot to mention that!"
2085,"I am currently in college as a freshman, and although it does suck, I just am counting this year(2020-2021) as a wash."
2086,It wont be safe to have parties until next fall anyway.
2087,"So I'm just staying at home, and taking gen ed courses, atleast I will be saving like $12k from housing."
2088,Where did you buy your bidet?
2089,I've been doing my research on them but still get overwhelmed on which models to buy.
2090,I'm on well water if that helps.

2092,Not in the north bay.
2093,"Theaters closed, restaurants only outdoors, no schools, if grocery stores get too full they start making lines outside to limit people, no mass gatherings, companies still have people working from home."
2094,"Not for sure,, apparently."
2095,Most of the reinfections seem to be milder diseases though.
2096,Again?
2097,I never left.
2098,It's a good article.
2099,"I did most of that stuff from the get go: set up a dedicated home office, reorganized to have more space for a home gym, regular sleep schedule, better nutrition, etc."
2100,"Realistically, we have another six months at least before this is even going to start being over in places with a bungled handling."
2101,Might as well get comfortable.
2102,"I mean, I would."
2103,"Trump isn’t tweeting, while stuck in bed, bored as usual, and supposedly doing “well”."
2104,I doubt he is conscious at this point.
2105,"I’m actually surprised no one is pretending to be him on his Twitter to reassure The public he is well, that kind of indicated to me that people in his inner circle think he may still pull through and don’t want to piss him off and get kicked off the gravy train if he recuperates and is pissed at what they tweeted on his “behalf”."

2110,I'm Hispanic and second cousin marriage is extremely common in my family.
2111,Although I don't think it's the norm.
2112,"We don't distinguish between first, second, third, etc."
2113,Cousins are cousins and thats it.
2114,But our kinship is slightly different (in my country or parts of my country).
2115,So my mom's cousin would be my uncle/aunt rather than # cousins.
2116,I have an uncle (mothers cousin) and a cousin (mother's cousins son) fighting over my cousin (mother's sisters daughter).
2117,And it's absolutely hilarious to us.

2133,serious question- is Jim Acosta legit?

2135,I've never heard of him before til yesterday.
2136,"Mask mandates remind people that restaurants are unsafe to eat, that entertainment spending - movies, indoor kid places, etc, are dangerous."
2137,So people spend less money.
2138,How will the rich get fix her if we are trying socially distance and mask wear?
2139,Slower.
2140,"And their workers, it costs money to take precautions."
2141,Every dollar spent protecting workers is a dollar less in their wealth.
2142,"It was a ""You're asking irrelevant questions."""
2143,Not sure they need to.
2144,"At this point in the pandemic, anyone who believes covid is a hoax or something not to be taken seriously is not going to change their mind."
2145,"Senator Ron Johnson (R, WI) was pretty cavalier about his positive test result, and claimed that he still wouldn't wear a mask."
2146,We have the opposite of a mandate.
2147,"We have a governor that won't allow counties to make mandates... or enforce any that already existed... while simultaneously forcing schools to open with no plan, not allowing them to report infections, and making sure those who are forced to work in unsafe situations can't collect unemployment or workers' comp when they end up in the hospital."
2148,At least the properly calculated (not the BS our governor puts out) positivity rate finally dipped down to ONLY 10%.
2149,It was much closer to 20% for most of last month with 200 or so deaths per day.
2150,... and the one thing our governor DID get right was locking down the nursing homes... which we have more of per capita than anywhere.
2151,He just lifted those restrictions.
2152,We are probably going to be suffering through this forAnother year so we have to come up with better protocols.
2153,We need to come up with a better solution than a 14 day quarantine.
2154,This is one of the big things that science had failed us at.
2155,Being quarantined for 14 days because of some level of proximity to someone is paralyzing us.
2156,We need to say something like “2 negative tests after 5 days is good enough” or something along those lines.
2157,"We shouldn’t be using the worst case scenario to dictate quarantine times, we should be doing science and determining along with PCR tests."
2158,"We should be doing the research and science to cut this risk down and quarantine to something more manageable because no matter what the media says, most of us peons won’t see the vaccine for at least a year if ever."
2159,Prolonged social distancing probably does have a downside.
2160,"However, it is much more preferable to getting sick and possibly getting a lifetime of horrible chronic aftereffects, or even dying"
2161,gotta protect from those snipers..
2162,Just need to watch for people jumping it to get to the SC liquor stores
2163,"I was out and about Friday afternoon and all day Saturday, these are my observations:

* a lot more people out and about
* a lot more people dining out
* outdoor dining: the tables are a lot closer then they used to be, 6ft my arse
* a lot more people without a mask
* a lot more people not respecting social distancing in stores
* more people in the subway
* in the subway 1 person out of ~20 is not wearing a mask

It seems that people are getting tired and let their guards down."
2164,"Positive observations:

* Most of the police are now wearing a mask
* All the stores that I have visited had lots of hand sanitizers around
* Museums are very safe
* Ferry NYC enforcing limited capacity (I missed 1 ferry because of this, and I am happy about it)"

2179,"I think theres a good chance the virus has mutated to be both less lethal and easier to transmit, but this is extreme speculation."
2180,Death rate has been steady at around 1% of cases in France since July 1.
2181,"If it stays at this rate, deaths should remain relatively low, even if there are several hundred thousand new infections."
2182,It remains to be seen if these infections are both weaker and remain in less vulnerable populations.
2183,Island of responsible people in the NC triangle but as soon as you get into the rural parts it becomes a free for all.

2511,"There were other ones like Kansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri that were doing well before, but some of those are now rising quickly towards the mean."
2512,They just held out for a long time before seeing a decent sized outbreak.
2513,"Also electricity, choking hazards, and pointy objects."
2514,Very dangerous...
2515,"A fest (feast) basically means party, so that party part is redundant."
2516,"That’s why it’s now illegal to smoke in restaurants, and in my state, it’s illegal to smoke with kids in the car."
2517,Did I miss smoke shops killing over a million people in just the last few months who didn't choose to smoke?

2525,They’re not healthcare professionals
2526,some cancers are caused by infectious diseases like HPV
2527,"Yes, several European countries did pretty much the same as well - even places like Germany had an amazing response all things considered."
2528,It's not like NZ is the only place with extensive tracing and responsible people.
2529,"But then, Germany or other European countries aren't an island at the end of the world, so they had to reopen borders and contacts with other countries, and so the virus came back, and once it's in and it's no longer limited to one single isolated outbreak you can either impose increasingly harder restrictions or try to slow the spread with massive contact tracing (which is unlikely to work), or both."
2530,"Eradication is only possible in NZ and similarly located countries, where you can detect the origins of an outbreak and pretty much block everyone from the outside."
2531,It's impossible in much of the Western world.
2532,"I for one, living in Europe, do not and cannot look at NZ as a role model - good for them that they're back to normal, but it's just not an applicable situation over here (except maybe in Iceland, I guess)."
2533,"Like, what would I have to learn from it?"
2534,They did nothing that many countries in Europe didn't do.
2535,Do you think countries like Germany can track and quarantine for months on end every single individual crossing their borders like NZ can afford to do?
2536,Maybe they need to stick him in the sun so he'll feel better

2544,This happened 2 and a half months ago.
2545,Where does it say he's on IV?
2546,"I read the Docs told him to stay hydrated, which would imply no IV?"
2547,"You’re right, it’s just the mainstream media (including every clip of him on Fox News) misrepresenting him."

2574,He was afebrile and his heart rate was 86bpm which is well within normal range.
2575,CRP was slightly elevated.
2576,Only real symptom was low potassium but that can be brought on by numerous other things.
2577,He was positive for IgG by day 5.
2578,"For this particular case, I don't think we'd consider this a classical reinfection but rather what happens with all other diseases we have prior immunity against."
2579,Exposure followed by immune response that clears the infection.
2580,"No different than a person with existing immunity to something like measles (which also has different clades) where the virus can be detected in a swab after exposure, but no symptoms develop in the person due to immune clearance."
2581,Why the hell didn't you use birth control?
2582,Thanks!
2583,Is the Michigan legislature up for reelection this cycle?

2585,Viral load probably plays a large part.
2586,"Considering these people have all been in close contact with infected people, and nobody wore any masks, the viral load they got might be quite large."
2587,"IIRC, the one senator who got it but is reporting almost no symptoms was wearing a mask."
2588,So that's that.
2589,Why?
2590,There's plenty of supplies in USA.
2591,Just buy one from your nearest jail.
2592,You can live your life and wear a mask around people outside your pod/whenever indoors and not sacrifice everything now that we know more about it.
2593,Everything being the key word there.
2594,"Some things, yes, but you don't need to be a hermit and that's been pretty well established."
2595,"I have thoughts about the follies of taking off masks for the whole dining outside encounter, yet keeping them on when walking past outdoor diners - like, what, germs stop at the magical sidewalk/eating area line?"
2596,- but whatever.
2597,We'll see how indoor dining goes (I'm not optimistic).
2598,Schools and subway are the most worrisome for me.
2599,"Anyway, no need to martyr yourself."
2600,Don't forget Rand Paul.

2606,Ok.
2607,Please tell me what happens to chronic smokers who get too much oxygen.
2608,I will let you do the research.
2609,Hint: look up a non smokers drive to breath versus a smokers drive to breath.
2610,"And I will clarify, when I say smoker I mean a chronic pack(s) a day for years smoker."
2611,Not just some 21 year old half a pack when at the bar smoker.
2612,Didn’t you know China baaaaaaaad?

2614,"Next year, I hope people revolt."
2615,I hope people protest.
2616,I hope people take their anger to the streets and demand justice.
2617,This is just way too much irresponsibility.
2618,I was not writing a scientific paper.
2619,It was a tongue in cheek comment.
2620,JFC people got no chill.
2621,That is why they hadn't peaked.
2622,My guess is that they aren't closing again unless we see 1000 deaths a day.
2623,"I don't think we will, but 200... yes"
2624,"“Sir, we now have about a hundred deaths a day!”

“They must have not studied hard enough!”"

2627,Grow up.
2628,was going to do phase 3 testing for Pfizer vaccine but backed out last minute.
2629,"I’m a covid long-hauler whos JUST now feeling better after 7 months, so I wasnt mentally ready to do such an experimental thing."
2630,many who took the vaccine say they dont regret it.
2631,I know 2 elderly people who took it and are complaining fine as well.
2632,less afraid to take it now
2633,"The point of the sacrifice is to minimize completely pointless avoidable deaths, of which we've had about 200,000 so far."
2634,"And yes, it's possible just look at New Zealand or Australia."
2635,You would be a little more significant if you get to taste it.
2636,"Is it not the case that a non-sterilising vaccine would make you less infectious as well, or at least for a shorter time?"
2637,"I asked about this on the COVID19 sub (whether a non-sterilising vaccine which reduces symptoms also reduces, but not necessarily stops, transmission): [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly\_question\_thread\_week\_of\_september\_28/g6ylfif/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g6ylfif/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Consensus seems to be that it will reduce transmission because the fewer symptoms you have with COVID-19, the less infectious you are."
2638,One of the posters linked to a study which shows this: [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2671](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2671).
2639,Oh yeah... at the debate too.
2640,Making Biden look like an ass (trying to).
2641,Edit - Also something trump did at the debate was call common tax payers dumb yet nobody is talking about that.
2642,"I have no sympathy for those students at Northeastern University who opted to flout the rules for mask-wearing and social distancing, and against having large gatherings of people in one room, especially indoors."
2643,"They signed a legal, binding contract  to uphold and obey the rules that were put in place for their own health and safety, as well as others, and they deliberately flouted those rules."
2644,"They're old enough to vote, go to college, marry/buy a house/receive medical treatment without parental consent, serve in the military, and be tried for and charge with whatever they get arrested for in an adult court (as opposed to a juvenile court),  then they're old enough to understand why these rules are in place, and to suffer the consequences of flouting them, and to take their punishment."
2645,Their parents are livid--tough shit.
2646,"Let them take the consequences, also."
2647,What the hell did they hire a new York lawyer to prosecute a case here in Boston?
2648,It's ridiculous.

2654,Wasn't trump spouting something about masks actually increasing the risk because of people touching their faces more?
2655,Lowkey worried he's going to double down on that position now and make masks even more of a divisive thing.
2656,Old news
2657,I don’t remember Johnson downplaying it to the levels Bolsonaro and Trump did?
2658,You should try aiming that fart at their faces.
2659,"Considering how broke and in debt Trump is, and how they'll inherit it all, and how incompetent they are at business (and life), those farticles might be the only food they get for a while."
2660,"They will probably grift their way into low paying jobs for Fox News or other right wing ""news"" organizations, but if they aren't able to do that, they'll end up homeless, living under a bridge."
2661,"It would be hilarious to see Jr's wife yelling at passers by and regretting her bad choice of hitching her wagon to what she thought was fame and fortune, only to end up broke and too old to use her looks to land another rich guy."
2662,How’s Spain doing right about now?
2663,"They have an incredible conservative government...oh wait, no they don’t."
2664,Fox news just posted a video from POTUS
2665,"Going to the hospital for ""mild symptoms"" as a ""precautionary measure"" is sure starting to sound like a lie downplaying what the virus is doing (like they've done all this time)."

2667,"DiFi has never looked young, even in her 30’s."

2713,2 October they have 2800.
2714,"Their population is about 200X smaller than France so that's like having roughly 120,000 cases, comparatively."
2715,"France has had 162,000 in that time."

2806,"In theory, yes."
2807,"It's always possible there's some systemic reason why the antibodies from the vaccine don't actually prevent coronavirus, and that might prevent all vaccines from working rather than just one trial failing."
2808,"For example, dengue fever."
2809,"However, my understanding is that other coronaviruses have working vaccines in animals, so I am confident we'll have a working vaccine in a few months."
2810,"I mean, if I were the president of the US I'd have previously recorded versions of this."
2811,"""Yeah, I'm fine, Melania is ok"" recorded on March 2020"
2812,"Belgium is a weird one, their head of viral disease Professor Steven Van Gucht has a policy known as ""radical transparency""."
2813,"&gt; What van Gucht says is ""good practice,"" for all the bashing he's received for it, is what he described in a recent interview with DW as radical transparency, counting even suspected cases of COVID-19 in the national death toll, regardless of whether the deceased person was tested."
2814,"&gt; In the early days of the pandemic, when the virus was sweeping across nursing homes, sometimes only a tiny percentage of those who died had been given a test, yet 100% of the deaths were attributed to coronavirus."
2815,"In the latest statistics from the government, more than 80% of care-home deaths were confirmed as coronavirus by testing."
2816,"Source: [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/belgiums-coronavirus-overcounting-controversy/a-53660975)

His opinion is that the standard method used by most countries is dramatically undercounting deaths and points to excess mortality as revealing the true figure."
2817,But has gotten a lot of grumbling for his method of counting.
2818,Spain though has been a shambles.
2819,In many ways it was a perfect storm for the Spanish.
2820,I think Spain's big problem is that its a popular retirement destination for Europeans.
2821,"In the same way many Americans retire to Florida many Europeans move down to Spain for retirement (cheap cost of living, mediterranean climate)."
2822,Another thing of course is the financial situation.
2823,During the Financial Crisis Spain was one of the worst hit and cut their health service to the bone.
2824,"Those would be the two main factors, though also the Spanish cultural habit of being very touchy and very kissy probably hasn't helped either."
2825,My next door neighbors have tons of kids and constant parties.
2826,"They had massive parties with lots of hugging, food sharing, and no masks labor day weekend from *Wednesday through Monday*, every single day."
2827,I have no idea where they get the energy for this or how they haven't all caught covid.
2828,"We live in a hard-hit state with pretty strict regulations, too."
2829,They must think I'm a hermit because I'm immune suppressed and terrified to go anywhere near them.
2830,Wow everyone you know you say?
2831,How many have got sick?
2832,Must be most of them.
2833,How many have died?
2834,"Smallpox was endemic to Europe and Asia for multiple millennia, and those whose ancestors that didn't die at some point probably had some kind of genetic advantage against it."
2835,Plus the small advantages you get from getting antibodies from your mother.
2836,I don't think the data points we have from indigenous tribes in the Amazon or elsewhere point to markedly higher mortality from COVID.
2837,But we may not know enough to be sure.
2838,"It does seem likely that mild coronaviruses get less exposure in remote places, making people there more vulnerable on average to COVID."
2839,"Of course it would, I never meant to imply otherwise."
2840,But there would still be some people in here complaining their not going out because the vaccine won’t keep them 100% safe
2841,Lmfao “50%.”  Try starting without a lie and I would consider reading the rest.
2842,This is good news.
2843,Stay inside if at all possible.
2844,Show the world that the Texan method ISN'T the safe one to follow.
2845,"We may have bars opening, restaurants and etc, but they don't stay open long before staff test positive for COVID-19, and they close right back down."
2846,"Trust me when I say, the alternative to having things open is overloaded hospitals, and death."
2847,That's what Greg Abbott gave us.
2848,What borough you in?
2849,I'd be happy with only 1 in 20 here.
2850,Was about 1 in 8 not wearing on the 6.
2851,Even that would be enough to return to normal.
2852,Pro virus is the political party I registered.
2853,We give your computer herd immnunity by infecting it with a virus.
2854,Hold up.... they still don’t know this after 10 months of infection spread?
2855,Click masterrace.
2856,"Barring major setbacks in literally dozens of countries, companies, and vaccines, we will have a vaccine (probably multiple) before re-infection becomes a real concern."
2857,"And I get that viruses mutate and things change, but the insane low numbers if actual confirmed infections compared to the sheer huge volume of infections just means that for the immediate future (at least 10 months), we'll be fine."
2858,And we'll have multiple vaccines by then.
2859,A vaccine.
2860,It's only a couple of months away and we should all have one by June of next year.
2861,7 months here.
2862,(March 28) only thing that got me through it was I got to spend all that time with my (then) 4 month old daughter!
2863,I'd never have gotten that time with her.
2864,Bet.
2865,Turkish it was 3 months 5 months ago.
2866,Seems like a small price to pay until an effective vaccine is available and administered widely.
2867,Or do you not think the elderly or those with comorbid conditions are worth protecting?
2868,"For sure, there's no way they would send him to the hospital and give him experimental stuff if it wasn't serious."
2869,"And of course they are lying and covering shit up, they always do."
2870,We won't find out how serious it is until he's on his deathbed
2871,I mean also the man only won like 22 percent of the popular vote.
2872,That’s bullshit.
2873,It says more about the system and how the republicans have found a way to use the electoral college to consolidate power
2874,That's optimistic thinking.
2875,"Yes treatment is marginally better, but will that offset the critical situation that Parisian hospitals are in as of last week?"
2876,I knew the Spanish flu was more deadly in its 2nd year even before covid..
2877,It's only now that I realize why.
2878,"People can't stay vigilant forever, and life isn't life without spending it with loved ones."

2882,The social and family dinners around people's houses are the issue.
2883,But how do you stop that.
2884,This.
2885,It's not just about ad clicks and other garbage.
2886,A fear campaign has been run since the beginning of 2019.
2887,Every single normal every day thing occurring has been put in front of a megaphone.

2890,"Also, we are expecting Swine Flu2 out of China soon."
2891,"CDC has been watching a new respiratory disease in pigs, that has jumped to humans."

2893,"Been growing over there for I think 4-6 years now, haven't kept up on it."
2894,"Sure, now leave me alone."
2895,Wedding parties aren't allowed either.
2896,No music / dancing.
2897,"You can have a ""family dinner"" ~50 people"
2898,American beer is piss water
2899,"It will, people are fucking stupid and don't listen to science."
2900,Indoor dining and movies are not safe right now but these people won't admit it.
2901,"Sadly, a bunch of people will die as a result."
2902,Why?
2903,Many other places have done much more.
2904,"I'm so tired of the ""hospital beds available"" standard that has already been thoroughly discredited."
2905,Would you rather have been in the hospital 6 months ago or now?
2906,We can treat it better now.
2907,You have a better chance of not dying now than before.
2908,It's not just that we don't want to overwhelm the hospitals.
2909,"It's that the longer we keep people alive, the better chance they have to live overall, including because of better treatment and eventually a vaccine."
2910,Glad it was no worse for her.
2911,It's a strange virus though.
2912,"We never know what it's going to do, a little sick or a lot."
2913,Depends how you define a wave.
2914,The US is a massive country .

2940,I do agree that short term the odds of catching it again are extremely low.
2941,Hopefully long term there is a permanent solution in the form of a vaccine.

2943,Definitely is a huge part.
2944,It works.

2947,Outside in public it would be surely followed.
2948,Thats very extreme but I bet it wouldn't be much of a big deal if it ever happened.
2949,"That was because there had been natural selection over millennia in the old world against people who were extra susceptible to smallpox, which had not occurred in the new world."
2950,No one anywhere in the world has undergone selection against being susceptible for the new coronavirus.

2959,The imposter
2960,I’m sorry!
2961,I’m fucking trapped here.
2962,I have only left my home a handful of times since March because I’m surrounded by selfish assholes and our president is a fucking idiot.
2963,Even when these morons get COVID they still refuse to wear masks or social distance.
2964,I’m sad when I hear that other counties (who are putting in ACTUAL effort) had bad days because I know what that mean for us.
2965,On the bright side you all have universal healthcare.
2966,"If I get it, I go broke."
2967,"
Our COVID hospitalization rates are comparable to 3/31/2020 now."
2968,We have hospital beds available to handle the case count that will inevitably rise (look at Paris).
2969,That is a best case scenario heading into winter.
2970,Hoping for more at this point is unfortunately just wishful thinking.

2984,I would quit the same day if the management did that.
2985,Jobs are not that scarce in this field and I have enough savings to even take a pay cut.
2986,Out of all confirmed cases the death rate is 3%.
2987,"That number is important because it's an indicator of how well we're tracking the spread of the virus, and what the results of known cases are."
2988,"For example, South Korea has a death rate of 1.7% at this stage."
2989,The CFR is usually what public health experts use when they talk about death rates because it's what we know for sure.
2990,&gt; Serological studies in the US have put IFR at 0.6%.
2991,This is true.
2992,The overall death rate is estimated between .5-.9%.
2993,We still need follow up studies to confirm a concrete number on the IFR.
2994,Im at my college campus but all classes are online and we socially distance when picking up foods at dc and we are getting tested weekly.
2995,I feel safe I just hope people continue to keep up these safety measures.

3075,Death rates within the country differ by a factor 10 (Stockholm 100/million) vs Blekinge 10/million) despite universal strategy within the country.
3076,You might say that Blekinge is sparsely populated but other densely populated areas like Västra Götaland 50/million and Skåne 20/million are nowhere near the death rates of Stockholm.
3077,It’s obvious that factors other than the general strategy with or without lockdowns and face masks are much more important than most people realize.

3089,Are enough people going to get a vaccine every three months?
3090,Making sure every person is wearing a mask is impossible.

3473,This whole thing has made me so depressed and then with the reopenings and everything else it’s clearer than ever for me that this states bing drinking problem goes WAY deeper than just a high drunk driving rate.
3474,The only reason people were in such a rush for the lockdown to be over was so that they could get right back to drinking shitty Miller Lite on draft at their neighborhood towny bars (which I used to find endearing about Wisconsin).

3487,"Basically, they stopped people from kill animals."
3488,"You too can do this, and not just for the rhinos."
3489,True.
3490,Also take into consideration we haven't lived through one full year of COVID.
3491,If it behaves like the flu next year's strains will be different and immunization from the previous strain will be useless.

3583,"The current U.S. administration actively dismantled preparedness leading up to this pandemic, and they have done worse than nothing since (stealing hospitals' and states' paid-for supplies early on comes to mind an excellent example of this)."

3585,"With the CCP, reasons are easy to infer, but really don't matter."
3586,With the exponential growth in the spread of Covid-19 every moment wasted early on represented huge differences in potential outcomes.

3677,Yeah i can’t deny that happened but now it’s way more fluid according to my friend.
3678,But when you do 1 million tests a week it’s inevitable that some goes wrong (and we have the culture to always see the glass half empty so obviously it goes on media)
3679,There is a mixed picture.
3680,What you say is not true.
3681,The oecd in Paris is not having people back in the office until the end of the month but maybe longer as that’s been pushed back repeatedly.
3682,Closing at 10pm does help as people will be most reckless after 10pm.

3700,Italy has been seeing ~1500 cases per day for the last few weeks.
3701,The last three days around ~2500 are registered which is a considerable spike.
3702,So Italy is entering slowly the second wave but it still is under control.

3743,"So how the fuck do you expect people to count those numbers, exactly?"
3744,I’m also in Paris and people are compliant on public transport with the police telling people who don’t have a mask (rare) to put one on and immediate compliance.
3745,"Shops have always had security and you have to be wearing a mask and all bigger shops and most smaller shops, bars and restaurants have a plentiful supply of hand gel."
3746,Increasing numbers are wearing a mask around their chin on the phone but compliance levels remain high.
3747,I wasn't talking about Europe.
3748,I am only comparing NZ and Australia to the US.
3749,"Europe is far, far more densely populated."
3750,But it's usually Americans claiming NZ is so sparse compared to the US.
3751,I'm an American and lived in multiple major US cities and now live in Auckland.
3752,"Auckland is far more densely populated than any major US urban area with the single exception of Los Angeles, which is nearly as dense."
3753,American states could have done what NZ and Australia did if they had obeyed strict lockdowns and closed their state borders.
3754,And urban density doesn't mean it is impossible to contain as Vietnam and China have done that successfully in cities with just as high density as any in Europe.
3755,I might be wrong here but they ran a similar study on selected people in june/july and numbers were not so different (they quickly refer to that in the article).
3756,In this case people voluntarily decided to get tested and the sample size is not bad (30+%).
3757,"It might be less but it might be more, I guess people who think it's fake, anti vaxxers and those who do not respect rules are unlikely to volunteer for a covid test."
3758,Slow news day huh?
3759,Its not that.

You are tested in priority, but unless it has changed recently I do recall several medical professionals complaining that the processing of the test was slowed down by the quantity of non-emergency tests."
3775,I even remember one person on LCI talking about a 6 day delay for some of his patients.
3776,That might not be true everywhere but it simply shouldn't be the case at all.

3782,It's always best to prepare and expect the worst and if things improve sooner then that's a win.
3783,No?
3784,When did I say that lol.
3785,I’m saying that realistically the virus was probably impossible to detect before it had already “escaped” its place of origin.
3786,You might want to learn the difference between CFR and IFR
3787,Exactly.
3788,Yes this gives a figure of how hard they were hit back in march.
3789,The extent of the spread is very hard to imagine even for me living just 150 miles away.
3790,When people say numbers today are the same as in april they fail to remember the country was in lockdown since march 10th and the virus spread was concentrated in 4 regions leaving the others almost virus free.
3791,"At peak, 23 days after lockdown started, there were 4068 hospitalized for covid in italy, 1381 just in lombardy."
3792,Today 297 in italy with 42 in lombardy.
3793,"Of course not to speak about 38k daily swabs (with 4600 positives) at peak vs 120k yesterday (with 2900 positives)

Numbers will go up again for sure in fall and winter but what happened there 6 months ago was definitely horrifying."
3794,"That's the problem with fascismo the enemy is both omnipotent and infinitely strong but also  substantially weaker than you, it never made sense and now it makes extra no sense because it's a fricken deadly disease."
3795,"Again, no he’s not unqualified in the slightest."
3796,"DOs are just as qualified to practice in all areas of medicine, and they do."
3797,"They can be, and are, everything from general practitioners to surgeons."
3798,"I don’t like the guy cause he’s covering for Trump, but bashing legitimate medical education is not the move."
3799,These people DO make arguments to repeal just these things.
3800,"I’m merely speaking anecdotally,  it I’ve been shocked into silence with some people who have made what they feel were valid arguments against these common sense safety laws."
3801,"Hell, here in MI the knuckle draggers are extra easy to spot, since they DON’T wear helmets on their bikes (we somehow repealed the law requiring them)."
3802,"&gt;I suggest you leave the analysis to people who are actually willing to do the work, because you clearly didn't!"
3803,"Thankfully in my country thats exactly what we do, we let the experts make the decisions and not the politicians, which resulted in not setting back our children years by keeping them out of school."
3804,"I've imagined both of your opinions and have taken offence, but thankfully I have also imagined sending a witty retort."
3805,"SafeBarrd, the slimiest soap in the house!"
3806,Nothing wrong with some steak.
3807,"Make it 4, stop any kind of travel, lock the borders and do it worldwide, that would be the only way to ""stop"" the chain of transmition, but - especially in lesser developed countries - people are just forced to go out and work to eat this is not an option ... maybe at least the western countries could work sth out, but after the first round of kinda-lockdowns there's not enough political willpowert to endure such a thing ... guess we're stuck with this up and down till we got a vaccince."
3808,:/
3809,"Except right now there is an increasing push by the players association to ban turf, I don't think they would agree to a full season on turf."
3810,"yea, I agree."
3811,passed by a father and his children on saturday with no masks on.
3812,Yeah because getting VR to everyone is very realistic when loads of families can't even afford food anymore because lockdowns have sent the economy down the shitter.
3813,"And here in Rhode Island, where one party school (Providence College) practically single-handedly put the entire state on the region’s quarantine list, just announced it is resuming in-person teaching."
3814,ffs
3815,"I bet that girl at the front with the ""speak to the manager"" hair is named Becky."
3816,Bad bot
3817,I live 15 minutes away from EAST LA and I’ve talked to people who don’t give a damn.
3818,"Going out to gyms in Orange County because they’re closed around here, going to beaches, having parties, going to Vegas, get togethers...legit one of the people I’ve been talking to wants to hang out and she just had a gathering at her house the other day...no thank you."
3819,Both my parents are high risk I’m not risking that shit to hang out.
3820,It gets me so mad.
3821,If it shows negative you're negative unless you're positive but it could show positive and you could be negative.
3822,"But it could be positive, too."
3823,Cali looking good.
3824,I don’t think newsom will repeat the haphazard reopening plan from the summer.
3825,Sort of need a source on that one bud
3826,"It's not good but that would be the equivalent of 42k US cases, so not too extreme."
3827,I feel like people forgot the UK has 67 million people.
3828,"I agree with ""backing up a claim"" if its incredibly new, relatively hard to find, obscure, or overly specific."
3829,But this isn't.
3830,Its been in countless articles.
3831,Its gained more than once.
3832,And it is an important aspect of this entire conversation.
3833,It should be part of the baseline to participate at all.
3834,There is no justification for me needing to spend time looking up links to articles I've read because someone who likely won't read it or respond asks me to.
3835,There is no rule that I have to provide basic information.
3836,This isn't a formal debate.
3837,He is just as capable of googling.
3838,Expecting him not to be able to is pathetic.
3839,My claim isn't sensational but you are being an asshole.
3840,Please feel free to inform the WHO Director General that he was wrong in his assessment on lockdowns.
3841,The US has had many experts come to the same conclusion that lockdowns are an overly blunt and costly tool.
3842,My antibody test was negative 2 months later.
3843,"But according to what I've read only a small percentage of people have detectable antibodies, especially after that period of time."
3844,😂 this broke my brain
3845,The NE US was around 2 weeks behind Framce which was 1 week behind Italy.
3846,So yeah you're right with similar but it's a bit unfair to compare the first waves directly like you did.
3847,There was a bit of forewarning.
3848,"You're general point is fair though, lots of countries are finding this very difficult to control."
3849,"I read that the Trumps arrived to late to be rested and they refused to wear masks, despite being asked to do so by the Cleveland Clinic staff."
3850,"Photos support they did not wear them, except for the predicate photo-op."
3851,"Additionally, according to timelines, Trump was already infected during the debate."
3852,Bwahahaha
3853,7 deaths out of 24 million is a success.
3854,"Those numbers are weak, my city had more cases and deaths."
3855,Re-open the border so we can show you how Americans roll!
3856,Note: please don’t actually re-open the border.
3857,&gt; DO?
3858,An M.D.
3859,is a doctor of medicine.
3860,A D.O.
3861,is a doctor of osteopathic medicine.
3862,Osteopathy is a fancy word for massage.
3863,"In other words, the guy is a glorified massage therapist, not an actual 'doctor' in the colloquial sense."
3864,This is so true.
3865,People have just forgot about the pandemic like it never existed smh.
3866,Never really understood the fun of going on a cruise.
3867,Feels like an uphill battle that won't end for a long time.
3868,Look at his eyes.
3869,"To me, he looks frightened."
3870,He looks scared.
3871,"Well, this disease isn't like ""every other pandemic""."
3872,Isn't it obvious?
3873,"Did we lockdown and close everything for ""every other pandemic""?"
3874,"Did experts warn us that weren't returning to normal after ""every other pandemic""?"
3875,Sick?
3876,[removed]
3877,"DISCLAIMER: I have no real opinion on this either way, but I disliked your refusal to post sources for the guy."
3878,"If you make a claim, back it up it's ettiquette and it's not hard to do!"
3879,"That said, I googled for 'Coronavirus cases predate/before wuhan' 'Origins of coronavirus' and definitely did not find multiple easily accessible articles."
3880,Only articles calling into question the origin.
3881,There is a TON of speculation but your claim of confirmed cases that predate the wuhan situation don't seem to be around.
3882,"Maybe i'm just stupid, and maybe you should link your sources when making sensational claims."
3883,That went out the window when we transitioned to dual-income families and normalized single mothers.
3884,That entire societal shift was only possible because the state provides free daytime childcare.
3885,You can't suddenly take it away and tell people who based their life decisions on it that it's their own fault for not having a stay-at-home parent.
3886,I really appreciate your reply.It is exhausting working around people that put money first and have no problem purposely selling product months to a year out of date.
3887,I was at a school this past week for the first time since the start of covid.
3888,Last conversation was with the SRO who pretty much laughed me out of the building for wearing a mask.
3889,The officer had come from a county meeting thst morning where local police determined masks were useless in Feburary.
3890,It has been local law now to wear masks since then.
3891,When the officer saw me he took one look at me and immediately walked the other way.
3892,And as we head into fall it’s only going to get worse.
3893,At least the WH is personally helping us along in their quest for herd immunity.
3894,"Schools have opened up with no social distancing or masks, offices have opened up, and we were encouraged to ""eat out to help out"" all summer long, as well as the cold weather yes"
3895,"But it's a police state with strict border controls, so they can isolate themselves much easier than Western countries"
3896,"In my part of the town, almost everyone wears masks on street, except eating outdoor."
3897,"In my building, mask is required in all public areas."
3898,It's inconvenient.
3899,It's hot in summer.
3900,We wear them all these months to get the infections down so we don't hear sirens day and night and we can travel to other states.
3901,Now some people are going to sabotage our hard-earned win.
3902,"Oh, come off of it, will you, TheLonelyOctober?!?"
3903,"I don't think that the woman in question meant for us to have to wear masks permanently, but it'll be quite some time before this pandemic is really over and  we can return to normal and not have to wear masks or social distance any longer."
3904,Do you mean wuhan officials or beijing?
3905,You shouldn't mention us because we don't exist.
3906,Putin created Sweden just to rustle your jimmies.
3907,"What evidence shows is that places that did strict lockdowns did not eliminate the virus (mostly because strict lockdowns weren't global), but did get the cases low enough that infection is rare and contact tracing is possible and beneficial."
3908,"Places that did not do strict lockdown and did not create systems to contact trace and keep numbers down, have seen cases stay high or skyrocket again."
3909,"Not locking down also has a huge cost, arguably higher."
3910,And yet your perfectly happy to ruin the lives of millions to save a fraction on the population?
3911,"With a vaccine you need to take some personal responsibility, if you're high risk its up to you to decide if you stay locked down or what."
3912,But punishing young working age people who had a tiny risk before a vaccine by destroying their livelihoods and setting them back years seems selfish
3913,Yes Americans these are the people leading your country.
3914,Not even willing to follow 2 basic rules to prevent each other from getting sick during a global pandemic.
3915,Keep some distance and wear a mask.
3916,Immunity is a consequence of the inability to slow the spread when the pandemic started.
3917,It's a small benefit weighted against the thousands who have died.
3918,"Either way, it's an interesting approach that most Swedes are happy with."
3919,Same situation happened with the Titans.
3920,Someone tested positive late Saturday.
3921,Game went on as scheduled the next day.
3922,Numerous Titans tested positive through the week (up to 16 players and staff I believe) and the Vikings didn’t have a single positive test this week.
3923,Was it pure luck?
3924,Could be.
3925,"But, we can’t automatically assume that it will spread to the other team."
3926,I live in West L.A.
3927,I saw a lady at the supermarket with her mask off yesterday.
3928,It’s very rare here to see that in an indoor space.
3929,Outside?
3930,Sure.
3931,I see runners without masks but people walking/running/cycling seem to be making a lot of effort to stay far apart.
3932,Haha not enough 'Snatch' fans in here to appreciate this.
3933,"Seeing how fast and severed the virus is, I don't think someone can hide it."
3934,"Thing is: Vietnamese community or any overseas community in general, only get limited information of their home country from very few sources."
3935,"Let say, you're Vietnamese Americans, the news in USA mostly focus on USA, USA affairs, etc...You can't get Vietnam national channels either."
3936,So the majority of your information about Vietnam is from channels that run by Vietnamese Americans specialized in publishing news about Vietnam for the Vietnamese community.
3937,"But sadly, I don't say all overseas Vietnamese community is like that, but at least in USA, Vietnamese community there has a large portion of people who are former officials of the Saigon government that flee the country in 1975."
3938,"Even today, they still hold a grudge against current communist government in Vietnam and always try to VCP in a bad light throughout these TV channels that for Vietnamese people overseas ."
3939,"They often make very biased, sometimes even outright inaccurate information of what currently happening back home."
3940,"And of course, because the only sources of information for Vietnamese Americans is through these channels, so their views usually are very skewed."
3941,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Spain#Statistics
3942,"^Trump’s high energy he’ll be fine
^
An actual serious comment about why trump will be asymptomatic even though Boris Johnson had a serious case (they’re saying Boris was unhealthy and overweight)."
3943,"Brb, gonna go smash my head into a wall."
3944,"I feel like a short lockdown early on could've helped a lot too, but it just wasn't possible possible due to some old laws."
3945,"But... ""you'd probably have thousands of Swedes still living"" is a bold statement."
3946,"I feel like it's pretty hard to know, considering many countries that did lock down have even higher excess deaths per capita."
3947,"And then, maybe it will work out better in the long-run than in other countries, who knows."
3948,"Do Americans realize how the world views them now, I mean we see headlines like this regarding Trump every single day."
3949,Yes it will.
3950,"People hate the restrictions, you will not get people sticking to lockdowns or social distancing when covid becomes as deadly as influenza; which a vaccine at even 50% would likely achieve"
3951,france has More per capita.
3952,"Note to self, check news in 2 weeks..."
3953,Poor Michigan .
3954,Ah yeah don't even address what I said because I used big words you don't understand
3955,Chill.
3956,I am basically agreeing with you.
3957,We don’t have a clue.
3958,Except for hot humid regions where everyone stays inside and AC'd spaces.
3959,That led to the southerm US wave in summer imo.
3960,Maybe you understand now why so many people are fat.
3961,And poor.
3962,And drug addicted.
3963,The list goes on
3964,They'll claim Trump isn't dead.
3965,He's been kidnapped by the Democrats and locked in the basement of a pizza shop.
3966,**We are not going back to old normal**.
3967,CNN said so.
3968,The WHO said so.
3969,Multiple times.
3970,"Rolling lockdowns, mass testing for the virus, and mandatory vaccinations will become a permanent part of our society henceforth."
3971,"Therefore, instead of complaining about all the things you miss about the old normal, why don't you just accept the fact that your lifestyle will be permanently changed, and move on?"
3972,"These statistics should be considered a way to keep track of the development, since as said before, reporting vary a lot depending on testing policy and gov."
3973,organisation.
3974,"Not for trivial and meaningless ""competetions"" in my opinion."
3975,Explain to me where I said things would be good or bad in Sweden in December????
3976,I have no idea.
3977,Anything declared now is premature.
3978,The problem is a refusal by many governments to implement the whole thing.
3979,"First, you need enough testing so nearly all cases are found."
3980,"Second, you need enough people doing the work of contact tracing to find potential new cases."
3981,"Third, anyone stuck in quarantine needs to be completely certain they won't run out of money because of it."
3982,"Anyone who thinks they'll not get sick leave, get fired, whatever, will try to hide from the process."
3983,"All of this is expensive, but consider the expense of failing to contain the virus."
3984,It seems at this point like the only difference between the Swedish strategy and the rest of Europe is its rigidity.
3985,"No matter what happens it seems schools, gyms, restaurants etc."
3986,will stay open.
3987,"In other countries they close those down at certain thresholds it seems, although they're not as eager to this time around"
3988,Cough *bullshit* cough
3989,"
holy fuck you are fucking stupid holy shit"
3990,The 3 I know of have very mild symptoms but are quarantined at home again.
3991,"Which is the procedure when you are positive
At the beginning of the pandemic that small office was a cluster (11 of 11 employees got covid, including my mom), some of them started having small symptoms again, tested again, positive again."
3992,"My mom still have symptoms months after getting it but test negative

I’m not lying, they aren’t either (or they wouldn’t be quarantined with salary without proof), but the data we have on these cases is going to take time to pick up correctly I suppose, if they are even registering these cases as being a recontamination"
3993,I’m sure it has nothing to do with the fact everything is on fire and the air quality is utter shit driving people to stay home.
3994,At least there’s an upside to these fires.
3995,🤷‍♀️ Seriously fuck this year
3996,Is it the cold weather forcing people indoors?
3997,"This year's golden week is the best one in recent memories, except for the fact that China's most valuable agent got covid19..."
3998,"No service at the bar though, everyone has to stay seated."
3999,"I still see large crowds of young people around 2am and 4am (I work nights in the city center of a large french city) so either some bars aren't complying or there's a large number of private parties going on (very likely)
Mask compliance is high toi"
4000,Boris Johnson’s symptoms never went away in the first ten days he was infected.
4001,As we know Trump is already fever-free.
4002,His newly posted video also shows he sounds just normal.
4003,I think the antibody cocktail is already working for him.
4004,I’d say he will recover very soon.
4005,"It did have lockdowns and it did have cases, as I've said, foreigners who left Taiwan were tested positive."
4006,"I believe Taiwan is not testing correctly or probably categorising affected cases as 
Something else."
4007,Poor leadership from right wing extremists.
4008,Who would of thought?
4009,&gt; no comprehensive policy in place to fight the novel coronavirus.
4010,I assume the Palestinians are in a worse position.
4011,"You don't have to stay at home forever, but it would be stupid to start partying."
4012,"Going out to some places can be done safely, with masks and distancing."
4013,Partying can't.
4014,"Eating out can't (except when outdoors, perhaps)"
4015,I really don't understand their logic.
4016,They're saying Trump is stronger and healthier than Biden whilst also saying Covid is nothing worse than a cold.
4017,How can Trump be so strong and healthy if he gets hospitalised by a cold?
4018,Or how can Covid be a mere cold if it hospitalised someone as strong and healthy as Trump?
4019,Not after this week when they stupidly reopened everything with no one practicing shit.
4020,"Even if Trump becomes slightly more sympathetic and grateful, he’s still one of the worst human beings."
4021,Difficult to care about the older generation when they care so little about us
4022,*Let them eat covid*
4023,Oof
4024,I was thinking the same thing.
4025,"As much as i would love for this to be a sign of us getting it together, I’m more inclined to believe that testing was just reduced or people just stopped going for tests."
4026,So we have a buncha people just wondering around with COVID just unaccounted for.
4027,"I’ve heard and experienced two sides of testing, that its either, “the easiest thing ever,” whole hearing from my close friends and family, “you need a doctors approval to get tested and its only the first test that is  free.”"
4028,Well with the weather we've had these past two weeks...
4029,It's like november right now in France
4030,looks like a headline people may be upset over.
4031,People skeptical of this should be just as skeptical about every article pertaining to this.
4032," they do not want to support the businesses, so shutting them will put a large number of people out jf work."
4033,Additionally all work and no play causes civil unrest
4034,I disagree.
4035,"If you look at the mortality rate data in the past two months, it is significantly lower than the start of the pandemic even for people over 70."
4036,"Doctors have already learnt a lot about how to mitigate the damage of the virus, not to mention he has access to a full team of medical experts and any advanced treatments available."
4037,I’d say he will recover in at most two weeks.
4038,Most likely one week.
4039,"Norway did great, and while it is too early to say for sure, it wouldn't surprise me if they came out on top in the end."
4040,"I am not saying Sweden did better than all other countries, I am merely trying to explain the strategy and the reasoning behind it."
4041,"There is a lot of misinformation and misconceptions regarding the Swedish strategy, and that is very dangerous."
4042,"I do not know if an initial lockdown would've been necessary, but I certainly think the restrictions came too late."
4043,"FHM waited until community spread was confirmed and then some more before acting, so the restrictions only came once it was already very widespread."
4044,"Acting faster would've helped a lot, and probably would've been more effective than acting harder."
4045,I wonder if Trump calls her FLOTUS to her face.
4046,Yes it actually is lol
4047,Reading comprehension fail.
4048,Follow the whole thread.
4049,This mother wants mask mandates to remain in place even AFTER the pandemic is over.
4050,She's talking about forcing people to wear them permanently.
4051,We all get that we have to wear them for now.
4052,I completely stand by what I said though.
4053,"Once the pandemic is over, I will not continue to wear masks and people in her fragile situation will have to take personal responsibility for their own health."
4054,You'd be correct.
4055,Most countries allow their citizens &amp; their spouses entry into the country.
4056,I live in Rural Utah and people were first coming here to the national parks thinking it was safe.
4057,"When Utah got bad, there were lots of tourist , RVs and out of staters heading for Montana and Wyoming."
4058,I have always wondered why people would think the best place is a rural area or national park.
4059,What scares me is the lack of doctors and care in rural araes.
4060,"It is hard to find some one to deliver a baby or regular care, there sure at not enough beds or doctors if extra people start pouring in."
4061,&gt; Can i wear a mask with valves?
4062,"If you work in a hospital, you should wear a proper medical mask, and so should your patients."
4063,"&gt; since i don't have it, i shouldn't worry about that right?"
4064,"Most people with COVID think they don't have it until they start experiencing symptoms, so you'd be putting your vulnerable patients at risk."
4065,Don't do that.
4066,Sacrebleu.
4067,"There's no ""é""."
4068,"The first time I heard of covid was all the way back in 2019 december, in bejing."
4069,this was when there were only a couple of cases.
4070,I know two people who are “not” anti-maskers (they just refuse to wear them 🙄) Who were walking around in public with elevation training masks often over the last two years.
4071,I laugh but I want to scream.
4072,I’m from the UK and Trump is a part of the bread and circus.
4073,What makes you think the virus is raging?
4074,"Fuck Bolsonaro, but this piece is so overwhelmingly exxagerated, gosh"
4075,The US has atleast 40 000 more excessdeaths than reported.
4076,Sweden report more covid deaths than reported.
4077,"The US is doing a lot worse, and passed long time ago."
4078,"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html



You cant compare official reported covid deaths since all countries count differently."
4079,Fuck the Wisconsin Tavern League!
4080,I think we can write off 2021 now.
4081,Australia cannot open its borders to the world with this.
4082,Lets wait another year.
4083,I don't want to rely on a potential vaccination program that is unproven and only just being deployed.
4084,When what is said and done?
4085,You think it will go away?
4086,This is like trying to guess how many people the flu will ultimately kill.
4087,What do you mean it hasn't mutated?
4088,The more infectious D614G strain a while ago became the most dominant strain of sars-cov2.
4089,We can do concerts right now but not huge crowd concerts.
4090,It depends on the actual situation on to virusground.
4091,"Here in Europe we had before the latest surge started to experiment with different sizes of groups and strategies for conserts, and sporting events."
4092,At the moment in Sweden we have low transmission for most of the country less than 1% and we have just risen the total group size to 500 again and are allowing concerts and sporting events with audiences but in a socially and physical distancing setting.
4093,You and your group is sitting together distant by at least 1-2 m apart.
4094,In Germany and I think also in the Netherlands they have conducted concert trials with masks on or off and different seating arrangements to test spread indoor and outdoor settings.
4095,I haven't seen any risk assessment or result from those studies yet.
4096,Don't worry.
4097,"I think in a few days, the state of these daily threads will resemble that of April-May."
4098,"People taking it seriously, and whatnot."
4099,We're already getting there; I can see it.
4100,Though there still is an angry mob aggressively downvoting everything I say...
4101,That’s pretty much it.
4102,It wasn’t an issue until Trump made it an issue.
4103,Republicans also have a long history of whining about minor inconveniences as the nanny state.
4104,I went out with this girl in high school whose die hard Republican dad refused to wear seat belts.
4105,American hospitals have the same policy.....
4106,"I have a theory that since we know covid leaves long lasting damage, capitalist healthcare wants these people to stay sick so they can make more money treating them for the rest of their lives."
4107,What's your evidence?
4108,I find it very hard to believe the disease was circulating anywhere before Wuhan considering how infectious it is.

4141,Once they lifted the lockdown and we started seeing mask being politicized there was no going back.
4142,It’s sad because I can see some states or counties going back on lockdown if cases get out of hand again on a massive level but that won’t do much good if other states or counties right next door don’t do anything.
4143,It’s been a disaster and sad to see how we all can’t come together for something killing hundreds of thousands in America and millions around the globe.

4165,"Still, maybe 20% of the crowd in a normal year is students."

4173,and you probably make it back in toilet paper savings over the year in a household.
4174,It started with Trump stating the virus was a Democratic hoax to hurt the economy and his re-election bid.
4175,To wear a mask would be to admit that Trump was wrong.
4176,That was a hill they literally chose to die on.
4177,It's a constant and visible sign that the virus is real and the wearer is concerned about it.

4210,"To be fair though, we nerds have so many false positives in our early freakouts that we were bound to be ahead of the curve for one eventually"
4211,Title is very misleading.
4212,The article discusses several different ways to measure if the lockdown in Australia was worth it.
4213,"Both philosophical (right based vs utilitarian) and empirical (suicade rates, number of deaths prevented, consequences for children's education)."
4214,"The ""no brainer"" quote is from one of the authors of a research paper discussed at the end of the article measuring the lives vs cost of a hard early lockdown (they are not incorporating cost for ""long-term health, social and mental health costs"" since that is extremely hard estimate at this point in time)."
4215,A hard eight-week lockdown is estimated (in the paper) to lead to costs of 52 billion (Australian) dollars + costs for bringing the economy back again.
4216,A life is valued at 4.9 million dollars with lives over 70 years being valued 30% less.
4217,They then assumes a non-lockdown would have led to 18 000-25 000 deaths which would bring the lost value in life to 62-86 billion dollars.
4218,"Since 52 billions is less than 62-86 billion dollars the researcher calls a lockdown (hard suppression) a ""no brainer""."
4219,It should be obvious to everyone there is a lot of assumptions and unaddressed issues here which could swing the numbers both ways.
4220,"As stated long-term health, social and mental health costs isn't taken into account (as said extremely hard to do)."
4221,Unclear how the economic is calculated and seem very possible it can be both much higher and much lower.
4222,Unclear how they have reached the number of expected deaths with no lockdown.
4223,"The choice also seem to be between doing nothing at all and a hard lockdown which is good for a research paper, but not how the world usually works."
4224,It also seem to assume one hard lockdown would be enough to be over with this pandemic.

4239,And you would be right.
4240,When the coronavirus first started to spread President Trump - fresh from being impeached - saw how the stock market was reacting to the outbreak.
4241,The stock market was the only positive thing that he could point to that happened during his presidency so he panicked and began calling the virus a hoax designed to attack him personally.
4242,Because Republicans cannot tolerate dissent due to their reliance on authoritarianism the virus is fake/overblown/scam/hoax.
4243,This is now engrained as a tenant of their cult.
4244,"Any thing that acknowledges or attempts to mitigate the virus is an attack on them, so they cannot wear masks."
4245,I assume their breath smells like dick
4246,It's Republican propaganda that serves to drive down voting rates.
4247,So no one knows if that is true for Covid-19?

4267,Nobody disputes the working of medical masks.
4268,The problem is people with normal masks are at risk of taking distancing less serious and misusing the mask entirely.
4269,"Purely isolated there may be some contribution in a certain set of circumstances, but it will not get the R from 1.4 for example to 1.0, it might even be statistical noise compared to keeping distance."
4270,"Not saying it's scientific data, but countries with high mask use (because it is mandatory) aren't always doing well."
4271,"The Asian countries that do tend to have much better discipline, so it is mostly their behavior that is working for them."
4272,"Then there are Spain and France, who are doing very badly."
4273,"I think what you'll find is that when distancing is taken seriously, the need for a mask disappears."

4357,Not everyone who tests PCR positive is actively transmitting virus.

4419,"Just some notes as other people have said: there is a commonality in these zip codes, Hasidic communities, and so much that it’s not just random chance."
4420,It’s really frustrating to me as a New Yorker that I see most people following the rules pretty well.
4421,"Sure, we have outdoor dining, but most people are following the rules but enjoying what they can within the bounds of the rules."
4422,"However, certain religious communities think that they don’t have to follow the same rules, and they’ve put all of us at risk."
4423,The somewhat positive is these communities are extremely insular so it could be why the positive rate within the zip codes has been growing but they haven’t yet spread it so much to the wider community.
4424,"Overall, as someone who’s spent time in two different northeastern states and nyc, New Yorkers are by far the most compliant with masking."
4425,It’s rare for me to see someone without a mask on the street and people avoid them.
4426,"Not everyone wears it right and people are more relaxed, but New Yorkers know what to do."
4427,They shouldn’t have opened schools though.
4428,I've wondered why positivity rate was ever a thing.
4429,A low one just means a state is full of hypochondriacs.
4430,Per capita?
4431,Sure.
4432,"Per test administered, garbage"
4433,Wow.
4434,I cannot understand that’s what you actually believe?
4435,Honestly just lock the man in a glass box for the next month.
4436,It’s the safest bet for winning the election/surviving.
4437,The problem also is that Netanyahu does not have the political will to clamp down on the Orthodox cos they are firmly in his voting bloc.
4438,Its like how the orange one is pandering to the anti-mask and 'but muh freedoms' cos they're his support base.

4440,"Most people don’t feel it’s a problem here, and normal life returned for the most part in late August with people ignoring social distancing and going out to eat all the time."
4441,I’ll be voting with my wallet.
4442,If a business doesn’t have a mask mandate I won’t support them.

4450,"In this particular matter the lockdown would be the solution to the ""The healthcare might be overwhelmed if the cases do not start to decline soon"" situation."
4451,Only long therm solution is the herd immunity.
4452,Sure.
4453,I get all that.
4454,"But then there are the instances where people died with COVID, but not *from* COVID, but because they were COVID positive, their death ended up in the COVID death statistics."
4455,Here in Canada the median age of a COVID death is 84 and over 80% of our deaths were residents of care homes.
4456,In other words our typical COVID victim already had a really high chance of death on any given day.
4457,I would guess that every single one of them who tested positive for COVID and then later died (probably within some arbitrary time period like 28 days) was recorded as a COVID death.
4458,No one knows whether the death count is too high or too low.
4459,My daughter cancelled her  wedding that  would have been this month because  we knew MONTHS AGO that large gatherings would certainly still be banned.

4467,Our BOE meeting was protested (one day after we confirmed the first case) by people who want their kids in school full time.
4468,It’s lunacy.
4469,What would be proof of it?
4470,I’m right there with you.
4471,"I will wear my mask, only support businesses that enforce mask mandates, and vote out politicians who don’t follow the science."
4472,I just hope a significant number of the anti-maskers start wearing them.
4473,"However, I doubt that will ever happen and we’ll be doomed to an endless cycle of lockdowns and then then lifting of the lockdowns."
4474,And the death count will just keep going up and up and up .
4475,.
4476,.
4477,Same b.s.

4479,Go bury your dead relatives.
4480,"Along with schools opening, of course."
4481,The health secretary can shut them unilaterally and she won’t.
4482,We have a bunch of schools in my area of the state that did the half-ass option of allowing people to decide on in-person or virtual.
4483,But thats the standard right?
4484,If the general consensus everyone in contact with the president must quarantine then so should Biden.
4485,"Of course ""everyone"" in this case just means Republicans since i haven't seen anyone criticize Biden for continuing to go to his campaign event in Michigan last week after his negative test"

4500,I was speaking out from a more mental health perspective; I think compliance is definitely going to be an issue like the first time.
4501,"I never said it would go smoothly, I just think that compared to the first time, we will be more prepared to deal with the stress of lockdown"
4502,Have you been to Egypt?
4503,What you know is just what your gov manipulates.
4504,BTW.
4505,test in China is free.
4506,"We're 11 years away from Shai Labeouf being eligible to become President, sadly."
4507,Which means we will have to endure 3 more Presidential terms before we can finally elect our perfect President: Shai Labeouf.
4508,whatever
4509,Trump is not in good health without covid.
4510,This just makes things much more worse.
4511,"I'm not familiar with Spain and France but for sure Italy, UK and the US all refused to lockdown initially and hence were forced into it after allow many to die first."
4512,Also let’s nor forget how Kayleigh Mcenany lied to the media after the president was diagnosed that “when we can’t socially distance everyone is wearing a mask”.
4513,Like does she not realize that cameras follow them everywhere?
4514,Personal experience seeing people in Santa Monica...
4515,There were people partying on 3rd st outside a restaurant.
4516,Just because you’re outside doesn’t mean you can act like the virus doesn’t exist.
4517,I siad that some trophy hunters want them.

4519,What is unclear?
4520,Troglodyte
4521,He’s currently calling it “things that look like miracles from god” (paraphrasing)
4522,No.
4523,"There have been seroprevalence results of over 60% in multiple parts of the world, so the theory that there is a large undetected immune part of the population is very much still debatable."
4524,When there are conflicting results we shouldn't assume that one or other is correct.
4525,"Also, it is not how effective the immunity provided by t-cells is."
4526,"It may result in milder cases, or it may even be harmful."
4527,"The Secret Service definitely has protocols for this, and more protocols they would like to implement."
4528,"The issue is that Trump is a moron, and they don't have the authority to make Trump wear a mask or socially distance."
4529,"Trump is in charge of them, not the other way around."
4530,"Here are the options:

A."
4531,"Use the information given

B."
4532,"Speculate an alternative without additional information 

Who has the agenda?"
4533,Not just Orthodox.
4534,The conservative ones too.
4535,Just walked past a conservative Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.
4536,"These guys came out shouting, ""if you don't feel safe, don't come to our neighborhood""."
4537,"Bro, i was just taking a walk."
4538,"And nope, they don't wear mask."
4539,Great news.
4540,Wait until Thanksgiving.
4541,Learn to read first.
4542,He should have lead by example from the start.
4543,FFS
4544,And how you think shit was shut down in the first place?
4545,Yes mayors and governors made the calls but cdc was the ones who told them to do it.....
4546,Then tell me what I said.
4547,Anyone know if the 7% false negative is in line with other tests?
4548,"That seems a bit high, but I guess if you do it everyday your odds of multiple false negatives over a few day span is very low."
4549,Then there is always the issue of false positives
4550,I think so.
4551,They ran a no 5g no vax no mask no lockdown no this and no that national assembly in Rome last month.
4552,1500 no something out of a population of 60 millions.
4553,no
4554,"I went back to check, but and noticed because it's on a different line?"
4555,"http://prntscr.com/usvw9t

Btw, I don't think you know what reading comprehension means."
4556,Fair enough on the numbers though.
4557,Whaaaa?
4558,?
4559,No Biden got tested for Covid.
4560,It was negative.
4561,There was never going to be a drug test at the debate because both candidates never agreed to a drug test at the debate.
4562,Are you serious?
4563,People are much less scared/more more desensitized than they were in March and will not be nearly as enthusiastic about a lockdown if we have another one.
4564,I had to travel very recently through DIA and it was vastly more crowded than in June.
4565,No social distancing at all.
4566,Not that I liked it but anyone thinking another lockdown would go smoothly is way out of touch.
4567,Watch the whole conference.
4568,He literally is asked this question and says Thursday was the first positive.
4569,Isn’t that what I just said?
4570,"PCOS can lead to obesity, which definitely puts people at higher risk."
4571,"No offense, but you probably need to surround yourself with more responsible people!"
4572,Sounds like “everyone you know” doesn’t care about the safety and wellbeing of others.
4573,"I live in LA, and have the very opposite experience with my family/friends."
4574,Trump never cared about anything but himself.
4575,"In the US, we've been told for years that our capitalist (arguably mislabeled) economic system is great, because it's flexible and adaptable to disasters, every crisis creating opportunity, etc."
4576,Yet somehow the folks who push that line never address the fact that most of the system--the average worker--doesn't have enough either wait-out the problem or to alter their careers and homes.
4577,“After 7 months or Extreme social distancing” wtf are you talking about?
4578,People have been at bars hanging out and taking the commute like always.
4579,Maybe in the beginning people took some social distances but not that long and not that extreme.
4580,"If you google ""athlete heart stroke after covid"", there are a lot of results."
4581,Enjoy the schadenfreude coming your way because it'll be ages before the smiles are wiped from our faces.
4582,"But hey, you're a conservative so you'll stop caring about this fairly quickly."
4583,Ps: You guys got Trump because supposedly good people like yourself turned a blind eye to him and caused him to happen.
4584,So please don't blame anyone else for what he has done to your country on anyone but you and your kind.
4585,You and your fellow conservatives allowed this and cheered him on in the process.
4586,So you are getting down voted because your hypocrisy is there for all to see.
4587,one is total key figure the other per capital
4588,&gt;  I’m sure Russia and China are exploring what their options would be for geopolitical shakeups if the US is occupied with a gravely ill leader.
4589,Wouldn't be a problem if the 25A was invoked while he was convalescing.
4590,"The citrus caudillo however is too much of a narcissist to ever surrender the presidency, even temporarily."
4591,I honestly hope he doesn't die.
4592,He needs to be beaten at the ballot box.
4593,"I don't want him to suffer badly because I can't stand him,  I want him to suffer some because I have some niave hope that he might be a bit more serious about the virus after it hits him at least moderately."
4594,I know only he can reach that portion of his supporters who are all in for him.
4595,"If it hits him like a mild cold, he will be unsufferable after and probably make his supporters worse."
4596,ELI5?
4597,I just hope that the threat of their elections is gonna keep them from doing that but it's a toss-up at this point.

4604,"I would say that this less their opinion, and more an objective fact."
4605,"However, I have not seen this published from a credible source and I would be surprised if they were willing to say so publicly."
4606,"Of course if you have a reliable source, I would very much like to see it!"
4607,You'd have to judge by how much spread there is where you live.
4608,"Obviously there will always be some risk, it's a question of how much risk are you comfortable with?"
4609,I like to track the spread on covidactnow.org.
4610,"If my state or county were green or yellow I'd feel comfortable doing certain activities (outdoor dining, meeting up with friends outdoors spread out, etc.)"
4611,"If it orange that's when I'd start getting a little nervous and probably curtailing some of those activities, and if were red that's when I'd hunker down."
4612,"Every time we get in a car we have a risk of getting into a car accident, every time we eat fatty vein clogging foods we increase our risk of getting a heart attack down the road."
4613,Everything we do involves some risk.
4614,The difference with COVID is the risk is also based on how much other people are complying with social distancing in the community and also the risk that we become a link in the chain that spreads it to others.
4615,So it's really about what you're comfortable with.
4616,"For the sake of my mental health I see friends or family a few times a month, but outdoors, masks when not eating, spread out appropriately."

4626,"The number of registered deaths where covid was mentioned on the death certificate is 4,257."
4627,46% of registered deaths occurred in care homes.
4628,The level of testing that we had when most of the deaths occurred suggests that care home residents weren't being tested.
4629,"Care homes are required to report suspected cases, as well as confirmed, and there have been a lot of them."
4630,Then there's people who die alone without having been tested.
4631,There could be thousands of them.
4632,For all anyone knows.
4633,"Well to be fair, the guy is functionally illiterate and it's been an open secret for years that he has the reading comprehension skills of a 9yo."

4726,"You don't have to wish for his death to criticize him for repeatedly downplaying the virus, lying to the American public about it, repeatedly making public statements that contradicted his own administration's policies and made fun of people for wearing masks."
4727,"hopefully it takes care of all those karens, finally retail workers can find some peace"
4728,Even brought the kids with them like proper covid protestors.
4729,And this is what's leading the US?!
4730,Despicable.
4731,How do you trace and retrace a US Senator who contacts everyone AFTER being positive for Covid?
4732,"🤦🏻

It’s like the dog spinning to find his tail!"
4733,"They could have been ahead of the virus, now the virus is ahead of them!"
4734,Have anything resembling data to support your claims?
4735,"Dividing the WHO representative‘s estimate of 750M infections worldwide by the number of reported deaths IS and IFR estimate, if you like it or not."
4736,The IFR of influenza is estimated at 0.1% globally.
4737,In the US it might be lower at around 0.06% recently.
4738,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html
4739,"Eh, worst-case overestimate number based on the fact that 7 million infected in VN would be a huge number and will overflow every single hospital."
4740,"It's just a hypothetical scenario, so no need to worry."
4741,Yeah several thousand deaths a day no big deal

4771,No more communal gray poupon
4772,Let them.
4773,Who cares?
4774,"They’re no better than that, so might as well just get to it."
4775,What's crazy is that a lot of people think our leaders our absolute dropkicks too.
4776,"Despite his shit response to the bushfires and despite the slowness of the action, Scomo got on TV and said ""Stay the fuck at home because the scientists said so""."
4777,And we did.
4778,"No complaining about freedumbs, just understanding that this is a public health crisis."
4779,Every country in Europe stupidly opened up for tourism and allowed everyone to fly all over the place on holiday.
4780,Its pretty much the main cause of this second wave in Europe.
4781,"Ok, maybe I was just getting into semantics there."
4782,Us normal folk wouldn’t be able to buy the drug but I suppose it is _possible_ the government did.
4783,"That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if Reg gave it to him for free given the press they will get for this."
4784,The marketing is priceless.
4785,"And I think they could get into legal trouble for selling it, doesn’t matter who the customer is."
4786,FDA guidelines around FDA approval are extremely rigid.
4787,My guess would be that they filed him in as a compassionate use participant (knowing that he doesn’t _really_ meet the definition) to avoid any liability.
4788,"Around after day 10 of symptoms you would no longer be contagious, so doesn't seem likely based on the timeline."
4789,Just because some people can be sick for weeks (and even months in some cases) doesn't mean they're still contagious.
4790,They are just dealing with lingering side effects and usually also a heightened immune response that throws their bodies out of whack.
4791,Really?
4792,He's talking about with a vaccine.
4793,Well they’re constrained by HIPPAA and maybe they were leaned on for National Security reasons.
4794,Basically all sick leaders get rosy reports until they die.
4795,I understand that it bothers you but it isn’t going to meaningfully change the results for the state.
4796,Some asymptomatics will be positive (especially the kind that listen to those ads).
4797,Also SB is a small part of the state.
4798,It’s influence will get washed out.
4799,Our COVID related hospitalizations have been dropping sharply.

4806,After a few years in Thailand I suffered from vitamin D deficiency from protecting myself too well.
4807,I definitely will start protecting myself more here though.
4808,"I never felt the need for gloves in my life, just use the thumb hole to mostly protect, but my knuckles and fingers were peeling!"
4809,"Yes, everything has just started opening back up last week where I am at."
4810,Covid cases will lag behind things opening though so it makes sense that CA cases have decreased while the state was mostly locked down.
4811,Let's just hope that loosening restrictions will not cause a surge of cases.
4812,"I would take precautions then, wear a mask, get the vaccine and not destroy society and millions of lives to give me a few more months of life otherwise I’d be a selfish old piece of shit tbh."
4813,I’m talking about post-vaccine.
4814,The people who are high-risk should shelter then not everyone.
4815,What’s wrong with that?

4830,Did you read about how 2 students at a roof top party fell several stories while taking selfies?
4831,One of my coworkers got sick with covid in June or July and he still has problems with brain fog.
4832,I wish more people would understand that it’s not just the immediate sickness but the myriad of long term problems after “recovering”.
4833,I imagine that if Trump has brain fog we’ll see some of it on display during the next debate (whenever that is).

4840,"Not GOP, but even after months of quarantine I still feel self-conscious about wearing a mask outside (easy to wear it indoors with everyone else)."
4841,"I live in the suburbs, and a lot of people don’t wear them out on walks because we’re never more than 10 feet from each other."
4842,"I still wear mine, and I *feel* like people are  staring and thinking I’m being ridiculous, even though logically I know they’re probably just wondering if they should be wearing one."
4843,Just wanted to get my thoughts out.
4844,I feel like I’m being gaslit for wearing a mask 24/7 outside of my home and car for the past six months
4845,I think they do understand.
4846,They just dont care.
4847,"Ok the first thing they should have used besides the daily *chloroquine,* he admitted at some point to have taken*,* is plasma transfer from patients that have recovered."
4848,My guess is that they already did all the above and at some point he started to show symptoms and deteriorate.
4849,Then they administered the Regeneron experimental drug as well as remdesivir.
4850,Despite all this his lung scan showed inflammation and today the use of dexamethasone indicates that a cytokine storm is brewing.
4851,That is not a mild case of Covid\_19 and my guess is that he contracted the virus much earlier than believed and they knew it but he was initially asymptomatic so they let him go on with the campaign and the debate!
4852,Wouldn't be surprised if most of those are GPs.
4853,"Specialists in the NL are really good, but GPs are dumb as a rock, have a God complex and there's close to no consequences if they fuck up."
4854,"Without masks, because those get in the way of *singing*."
4855,Because they ran out of bleach and uv buttplugs.
4856,How is it possible?
4857,People who defend Sweden's strategy keep saying that masks don't work.
4858,Because several countries have mask mandates but more corona deaths.
4859,And the Swedish CDC keeps saying that masks might actually be harmful!
4860,People who wear masks might socially distance less.

4891,"It just means you aren't burdened with carrying out some of God'd earthly chores, and are being judged by God only on your adherence to the seven Noahide laws (which, outside of perhaps idol worship, every half-decent person in a modern society already follows by default)."
4892,Businesses reopened and people had to go back to work or quit their jobs and simply be without income.
4893,With mask mandates everyone feels safe enough again to go out.
4894,"Online isn't perfect, but it is far safer for everyone."
4895,I know one district who announced they would be online for the whole school year.
4896,"As you can imagine, after making that decision, they were able to put their full efforts into providing the best remote learning possible."
4897,Is it perfect?
4898,No.
4899,Will kids fall through the cracks?
4900,Absolutely.
4901,"But the staff and students are safe, the procedures are set and familiar, and they are prepared for the virus to get worse in the fall and winter."
4902,Now my district.
4903,"We started remote and phased in kids a few grades at a time, so K-3 was first and 10-12 will be last."
4904,My SO's district is doing the same thing.
4905,"Both districts will be hybrid, some students there at a time, though their exact plans differ (A/B days versus AM/PM kids)."
4906,"Anyway, our districts have been pushing so hard for the hybrid plan, putting so many resources into finding a way to make it work, buying cleaning supplies, training staff, developing procedures for when kids and staff test positive, desperately searching for subs, buying new tech to enable teachers to better teach to in-person and remote kids simultaneously, etc."
4907,You know what we could have been doing?
4908,Making the online system better.
4909,"If we had channeled all our time and resources into improving our online education, it could be better."
4910,Would it be perfect?
4911,No.
4912,Would kids fall through the cracks?
4913,"Absolutely, but they're going to fall through the cracks with the hybrid plan anyway."
4914,"And you can set up buildings to accommodate a handful of kids, the ones who were falling through the cracks, to give them a safe place to learn with either an in-person teacher and a very small class or simply an in-person assistant who monitors many kids and keeps them all on task while they remote-in to their remote classes."
4915,"My point is, remote isn't perfect, but we should be working to make online better (and maybe having an in-person option for a tiny percent of the kids) instead of spending so much effort trying to make hybrid or full in-person safe."
4916,My own district has had 4 adults and 1 student test positive in the past month and less than half the students have started hybrid learning so far.
4917,It is going to be madness by winter.

4922,China’s tradition of consuming exotic animal parts for medicine is a huge reason why they are endangered and the whole world needs to push against that.
4923,The reason why that hasn’t happened is all due to the way the economy is run.

5038,"Not only should everyone wear a mask indoors everywhere that is not one's home, it should also not be taken off indoors to eat or drink and if removed briefly for any reason, one should hold their breath until it's back on."
5039,This is why I would never fly unless I can go the entire flight without removing my mask even to drink water.
5040,"The problem is, everything I like about a theater is just as good with a VR headset that delivers the equivalent field of view, and everything I don’t like about the theater is solved with them."
5041,"I haven’t missed going to the movies, probably went to the theater less than a dozen times in the past 5 years, and won’t really miss anything if I never go again."
5042,🤷‍♀️
5043,They really don't have real policy other than enriching their buddies.
5044,Anything else is just to get votes by creating conflict with the left bogey man.
5045,That's why I said plausible.
5046,Sure he's a compulsive liar but he's still the most protected person in the known universe.
5047,"There's an enormous team of people who's only job is keeping him alive, they're not going to let him just keel over in the oval office."
5048,I was going to type the exact comment!
5049,I was reading this to my husband and the entire time I was like “ groceries delivery again?
5050,What do you mean again?
5051,“ “zoom meetings again.
5052,again?!?!
5053,"What have others been doing this whole time?” 

Meanwhile my aunt and cousins in Hong Kong are starting to go out for dim sum (spaced out tables) and shopping (everyone wears masks and face shield when they are on out and about)."
5054,And me?
5055,I haven’t had a hair cut since beginning of the year... and I need to dye my hair so bad.
5056,But I suppose I don’t really need to since I don’t see anybody besides my husband.
5057,"I'm thinking a surgical or cloth mask doesn't do much about aerosols, either at the source or the destination."
5058,Is that correct?
5059,totally looking for data here.
5060,So if it is mostly aerosols we are all screwed and masks are a waste of time.
5061,"Now if it is mostly droplets, masks help."
5062,And staying out of indoor situations with numbers of people helps in either case.
5063,"&amp;#x200B;

Come on Vaccine!"
5064,!
5065,"People think they oppose the masks because we don’t think we’ll get the ‘rona, when in fact we oppose the masks because we know we’re all going to get the ‘rona."
5066,"With all the talks of Fall and the virus ramping up again, do the issues that come with this time of year apply to hotter parts of the country that don't really experience a winter like the rest of the country?"
5067,I'm thinking mostly of south Florida and southern California.
5068,"Speaking from experience, south Florida doesn't really go through winter."
5069,"At most it gets into the low 60s and very, very rarely, the 50s, but not enough to keep people locked inside for any lengthy period of time."
5070,I'm just curious if areas of the country like this would experience the same problems as other parts of the country would during this period?
5071,Why haven’t they started the invasive light therapy and bleach injections?
5072,[removed]
5073,"I think a lot of it boils down to anti-intellectualism, they can’t stand the idea of people smarter than them telling them what to do."
5074,Elites/libruls/scientists/college professors/etc.

5079,Multiple people got it as well as the Prez.
5080,"Well compared to my state, where rapid next day testing is widely available, you guys are doing great as far as budget surplus, economic recovery and total deaths, so there's that."
5081,"You guys seem to be doing so much better than this shit show of a state I'm in, which is still on lockdown since late March."
5082,Perhaps the fact that you have both Democrats and Republicans running things helped here.
5083,Unlike my state where it's one party rule.
5084, In the Bitterroot most are acting as everything is business as usual.
5085,"If it keeps climbing at this rate we'll be at 800-1000 cases in a matter of weeks, and we aren't event testing enough."
5086,Scathing posts from the daughter ... but wasn't Kellyanne supposed to be taking time off to focus on her family?
5087,"Guess this is what she meant, focus on infecting and possibly killing her overweight husband and reneging on her agreement with her daughter as well as infecting her with Grate Leedurr Virus."
5088,"All for the grater gud though, four more years and the end of Roe V Wade."
5089,This.
5090,Putin has had decades to tailor and master his craft.
5091,He’s also spent all that time locking down his own insitutions.
5092,No one politically powerful dares to challenge Putin in Russia.
5093,"However, the United States changes hands so frequently and is often pre-occupied in debating itself to death."
5094,"It was always a recipe ripe for exploitation, both internally and from abroad."
5095,I'd say digital projection was a massive improvement.

5100,He said it without qaulification.
5101,https://youtu.be/j5xCVovC80E
5102,There's no discussing what he meant.
5103,He clearly said that he wanted to paint a rosy picture and so he left some things out.
5104,"Note that he leans into the ""attitude"" of the president's team, as if that was what we want reported."
5105,"Well, here's hoping that time returns to its normal flow after january..."
5106,Big pharma says no
5107,He also won't get fired from his job for missing multiple days.
5108,Although that may change come November.
5109,And poor folks can't afford to quarantine.
5110,Poor folks frequently work service jobs that require them to go in to work and be around customers who don't take the pandemic seriously
5111,Just because you edited your comment doesn’t mean people can’t see through it.
5112,So true.
5113,People need a light at the end of the tunnel.
5114,"If you're telling me that I can't go out (no masks &amp; no distancing) to hang out with my friends, go shopping, see the world until some mythical undefined date?"
5115,I'm not complying.
5116,It's that simple.
5117,"Not going to give up my prime years to give a senior another few months of life, and I know that's not nice."
5118,They dont believe in masks.
5119,Its just one particular community all over new york.
5120,I come from a large family of Filipino nurses and health care workers.
5121,This made me tear up.
5122,I'm really sorry to hear about your grandfather.
5123,"it cares, humidity has a dramatic effect on how easily it transmits."
5124,"it is just that the baseline transmission rate is so high for covid that the summer judt slowed ut down in most places, rather than the fade away we wer with things like the flu."
5125,Donald doesn’t care...
5126,Not great news as this also means a vaccine will be most effective only against the seasonal strain of a specific year of coronavirus.
5127,"Luckily the second wave here (West Bank) has been graceful to some extent regarding the severity of cases, but numbers are growing at a very alarming rate (even with the shortage to COVID testing equipment that caused testing to slow down)"
5128,Wait so Lara Trump is doing a call to prayer event in an hour and Trump isnt even going to drop in virtually?
5129,"If he is feeling well that shouldnt be too hard, especially if you are tweeting"
5130,"Hopefully with the election hovering so closely, someone will want to be memorable by sending you a stimulus check."
5131,Charming.
5132,"&gt; Many, many Americans have no idea just how much better other countries have it as far as things like healthcare and education and that these are standard most other places in the world

They're starting to, thanks to the internet."
5133,"It's like being in an abusive relationship, then meeting some friends who are like ""Wait, you don't get *any* paid maternity leave...?"""
5134,"and the abused friend is like ""n-no, I mean.. it would be too costly and unfair to the companies, r-right?"""
5135,"The one thing trump has successfully done, is run the country into the ground twice as fast as George W Bush."
5136,I would tell them that you have all of those symptoms because those sound like textbook covid.
5137,I'm a high school teacher and we have to fill out a symptomatic chart every day and if we have any of those symptoms we have to stay home whether we have a negative result or not.
5138,also any of us who've had exposure are supposed to quarantine for 14 days so I would say that you have definitely had exposure anyway.
5139,It honestly would be insane for them to make you come in in my opinion.
5140,Check my comment history.
5141,"I’ve been doing as I say, and yes, it does genuinely piss me off."
5142,"I don’t agree with the alarmist shit you post, but that’s another matter."
5143,"Most people test positive after 4-5 days for the current test, so maybe a week of daily tests would be a good indicator"
5144,I have been and now prepared since I saw this coming in February and was called crazy.
5145,[removed]
5146,"I see this comment a lot and it's mostly driven by people reading too many News Corp articles, the government didn't being COVID to Australia."
5147,"And they did their best to manage a dynamic situation with very little information, yes a botched quarantine happened to cause the issue but that mistake could of happened anywhere."
5148,The Navy base near me had Covid cases and had to lock down so they're not some perfect force to stop a spread of secure an area.
5149,Not to mention the same guards at the hotels are the same guards that are on ADF bases...
5150,Just because you say it doesn’t mean it’s true.
5151,I feel for ya.
5152,Fleeing isn’t an option to most though.
5153,"Just like we as a country don’t like Mexicans and Central/South Americans at our border trying to come in, so does every other country in the world dislike the same thing."
5154,"Unless you have a way into a country already, being American doesn’t mean anything when it comes to immigration, you are the same as that Guatemalan is to us to other countries."

5156,"\- Morpheus, ""The Matrix"""
5157,"So, Trump was positive, before the debate with Biden?"
5158,"And, because he is tested so frequently, he knew it?"
5159,That might explain why Trump and his entourage showed up late for the debate -- so they could skip being tested.
5160,This will come out.
5161,Intentionally exposing other people to a deadly disease is a crime in almost every jurisdiction in the country.
5162,Liberals are NOT leftists.
5163,This may seem like nitpicking to some but it does no favors to anyone but fascists to confuse these political terms to the point where they are meaningless.
5164,Liberals and the right wing are pro market.
5165,Both are pro-capitalism.
5166,This is the biggest issue and they agree.
5167,Leftists are anticapitalist.
5168,Leftists are not liberals.

5173,Who wants to scrape their shoes off the sticky floor every time you have to move?
5174,And have speakers so loud it hurts?
5175,We all have move theatres in our homes now and able to stream anything we want.
5176,It's inevitable that these places shut down for good.
5177,Who remembers blockbuster?
5178,Hollywood is definitely not dead and you are being delusional if you think so.
5179,"The means of digesting media have and will shift, but the need for movies/tv shows will always be there."
5180,"Yeah, for course bud!"
5181,Find an issue to cause division.
5182,That's exactly who I'm listening to.
5183,The doctors.
5184,"Specifically, in one case, my very OWN doctor when I was obligated to get a Covid test for my job."
5185,Keep talking like you have any idea who I am or what research I've done.
5186,Close your eyes and ears.
5187,Stay in your basement.
5188,Wear your mask.
5189,"I harshly reject this ideology, of ""they're not all bad guys."""
5190,Why should I give even a modicum of a fuck.
5191,"The party of personal accountability, refuses to face any accountability for themselves, and they're absolutely fucking this country into the ground with this politic strangle hold started by the likes of Mitch McConnell and cronies."
5192,"But the fuckery goes back further, it's just that now they've become some damn morally bankrupt and have such a fervent following they don't even have to pretend to have your best interest at heart."
5193,"They can tell you to your face they're going to destroy civil liberties, human rights, and the environment, and people will fucking cheer."
5194,"They've destroyed the notion of class consciousness for a good chunk of the population, and seek nothing but to hold them their as a placated dullards who will do anything given a righteous cause."
5195,"Burn that party to the fucking ground, (and the Democratic one while you're at it.)"
5196,and rebuild something worth actually praising.
5197,"Because, at this rate we're going down a path that ends bad for everyone but the uber-wealthy."
5198,"I’m so sorry, that sucks."
5199,Why aren’t they all dead?
5200,Reported.
5201,Go back to r/politics please
5202,"well, four million have already voted, and in at least two battleground states, they begin counting before election day."
5203,This is starting to look like a big win for Biden - you can't cheat unless the margins are within a few points - but we'll see I guess
5204,Works both ways unfortunately.
5205,No one is sane here.
5206,Welcome to american politics
5207,Your hyperbole doesn’t make your statements true.
5208,Also poor insult
5209,It’s in the name.
5210,"Conservative means a small amount of change, liberal means a large amount of change."
5211,Conservatives don’t like change.
5212,Having to wear masks is change.
5213,They want everything to be the status quo.
5214,Why are you changing the headline?
5215,And introducing a new abbreviation for COVID-19?
5216,What about all of the waitstaff and support staff at the event?
5217,What about all of the people who have come into contact with the people at the event?
5218,The point of contact tracing is that it can help trace chains of infections.
5219,You have a centralized list of everyone who attended so you can notify their contacts to isolate as soon as they test positive.
5220,"EDIT: SORRY the below is for HIV, I misread the above post."
5221,This is completely untrue.
5222,A blood test at 28 days using 5th generation tests (not rapid) will be accurate.
5223,A blood test at 14 days using a pcr test (expensive) will be accurate.
5224,"""Rapid"" tests require you to wait about 6 weeks."
5225,Who wants to go to a indoor movie theater during a pandemic??
5226,I'm sad to them go but they did deserve it for being too greedy and not willing to adapt during these times.
5227,"Yes, masks out a huge sign of weakness and control."
5228,"Was used on slaves back on the day and if you actually research into it, masks do more harm than good."
5229,"there is no logic or reasoning

actually quite the fucking opposite."
5230,the republicans’ entire platform is based on denying science and medicine
5231,[removed]
5232,I disagree with almost every point that you made.
5233,You didn't go to theaters before the pandemic because they aren't your thing.
5234,Many of us *love* theaters and went to a movie every few weeks prior to the pandemic.
5235,Theaters were really popular and they will get popular again.
5236,I love ICEEs and the completely immersive experience.
5237,"It is also a good, relatively affordable, way to get out of the home."
5238,"Many or all theaters will go bankrupt during the pandemic, but they will spring right back after."
5239,The demand is there.
5240,I did a similar thing in 2000 with Bush and bet on some ‘war’ stocks.
5241,We had the wars but the sticks didn’t perform.
5242,Republicans are a public health menace.

5304,"This is the first time remote education on a wide scale is technologically possible in human history, there is no excuse not to try to use it."
5305,"If Trump + Christie + others come back in a week perfectly healthy with no lingering cough, weakness, fatigue, etc., and claim doctors can cure COVID (and promise to get the treatments they had widely available), then yup, this outbreak was probably a campaign lie designed as a Hail Mary attempt."
5306,"(Use it to claim we can re-open which everyone wants to do, but experts are telling us it isn't safe)."
5307,"That said, at this point I think it's just another case of Trump and the GOP's gross incompetence and their willful disregard of non-controversial basic science (e.g., face masks, distancing in a pandemic, climate change, etc) and relying on the power of wishful thinking."

5339,He probably believes he can command a cure into existence.

5351,You have to remember that conservatives don’t believe in capitalism or democracy.
5352,They believe in social hierarchy.
5353,They will take any system of government and any economy that allows the hierarchy to maintain.
5354,"They, for optics purposes, would prefer democracy and capitalism."

5360,"It doesn't matter, people won't do it."
5361,One part of it is the economy factor.
5362,"They wanted to open up the economy mid-pandemic and keep the engine moving, and were concerned that the whole plague thing would discourage people from engaging in the economy, realizing that without financial support a lot of companies would fall apart and millions of people would go bankrupt."
5363,"And, because they're fucking asshole republicans, they refused to do something like ""pay people so that they can stay at home and not spread disease"", or other logical socialist measures that would help put a lid on the virus."
5364,"So, they needed to minimize the apparent impact of the pandemic, which meant vocally attacking ***any*** measures meant to react to the danger of the virus."

""Numerous diseases have been eliminated in many countries thanks to herd immunity produced by vaccination programmes."
5542,But herd immunity is not something that can be achieved by natural infection.
5543,"Take the example of measles, which is caused by a virus that has been around in humans for centuries."
5544,It is highly infectious — the R0 value is 15.
5545,This means that on average one child with measles can infect 15 others.
5546,"As a result, around 95 per cent of people need to be resistant to the disease for a population to achieve herd immunity."""
5547,Most people who recover from a measles infection produce a good immune response that protects them for the rest of their life.
5548,"And yet, before vaccination, measles was a very common childhood disease."
5549,"Each new generation of children were susceptible and not enough people naturally became resistant to produce herd immunity."""
5550,"and

""We know that other coronaviruses (including Sars, Mers and some cold viruses), don't produce a lasting immune response like measles does."

5707,Impressed wit my state!
5708,You have no basis whatsoever to say the chance that it's reinfection is small other than your own assertion.
5709,A.
5710,It seems a good deal of your argument is hinging on the idea that the UK has a similar amount of flu cases this time this year as this time last year.
5711,"According to my searches, that doesn't seem to be correct."
5712,I was looking at the annual flu reports for the UK.
5713,&gt;And flu deaths were slightly lower prior to COVID when no measures were being taken.
5714,B.
5715,Are we looking at the same graph?
5716,They're lower now than they were at the begining of the year.
5717,"C. It seems your argument essentially comes down to ""no I don't think social distancing and masks helps prevent spread of respiratory disease"" but you don't have the balls to come out and say something that stupid so you keep dancing around it."
5718,That's ridiculous.
5719,Man up and have the balls to outright say this scientific contradiction.
5720,"Go on, do it."
5721,D. You keep ignoring all the evidence for long term health complications with covid that aren't present with the flu.
5722,Why do you keep ignoring those?

5825,1/7500 people have officially died from the virus.
5826,"The IFR is conservatively 1/200, and the susceptible population is conservatively 50%."
5827,So it's not out of the question that 1/400 people may ultimately die in this pandemic.

5837,Did they ever release why he went to the hospital a few weeks back?
5838,I’m betting on an underlying health problem.
5839,Or was it recorded soon after he arrived at the hospital?
5840,That's half the state!
5841,"Party of personal responsibility, eh?"
5842,I'm not saying he shouldn't quarantine if he leaves early.
5843,Going back to the white house from the hospital doesnt mean he should just drop all quarantine efforts while there.

5860,"You're absolutely spot-on here, AcromegalyFortnite!"
5861,"An awful lot of these college students don't follow the rules for mask-wearing and social distancing, and against having large gatherings of people in one place, especially indoors."
5862,I have no sympathy for the Northeastern students who got kicked out for that reason.
5863,"They signed a legal binding contract promising to uphold those rules, and they deliberately violated those rules."
5864,"College students  are not really kids--they're young adults, who are old enough to vote, sign a legal binding contract, marry/purchase a house/get medical treatment without parental consent, serve in our military, and to be tried for and charged with whatever they may have been arrested for in an adult court, and to serve an adult sentence in an adult prison."
5865,"Having said all of the above, they're way more than old enough to understand why  those rules that they chose to flout were put in place to begin with."

5877,"He just tweeted a new vid, he’s standing up, looking back to normal, and implied he was about to go outside and greet the supporters who’ve gathered there."
5878,So reality is much closer to the official statements...
5879,"The *real* number as estimated by the CDC for the 2017/2018 season was [61,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20influenza%20was,severe%20seasonal%20influenza%20can%20be.)"
5880,"not 80,000."
5881,"As the CDC says this number (about 30% of what Covid has killed - *so far*) was ""severe"" in that exceptional year."
5882,"That exceptionally nasty influenza would take about 3 years, 3 months of constant infection to catch up to what Covid has done in 8 months."
5883,&gt; I can confidently say that a lock down will not be allowed to happen again without the military (edit:law enforcement ) getting involved.

6025,"Exactly and all the talk about money, no one asked these question is about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
6026,Even though they've added more to the national debt than covid measures ever could.
6027,The same lot which was willing to fight on Iraq and Afghanistan at any cost doesn't want to spend money fighting covid which is a clear and present danger to Americans.
6028,Trump could willingly give up his powers while recovering.
6029,Mind you he won’t do that.

6036,[deleted]
6037,It’s a contrarian point of view.
6038,And politicians won’t wear masks because the people who support them don’t.
6039,It’s all about optics and what they perceive as votes.
6040,Also I know people who claim they don’t want to wear one because the government is trying to force it and that takes away their freedom.
6041,"When I worked in disinfecting this summer I had to clean a funeral home, was some unnerving shit"
6042,Child abuse since she didn’t take necessary precautions
6043,"So they can do another year of secondary school, we used to have five years of secondary school (the last year was only for students going to university, all students got a high school diploma after four years), have university-bound students do the extra year for preparation."
6044,It got better
6045,I know what we have to do.
6046,But it's still not confusing why people are not isolating after 7+ months.
6047,Even moderate people that HAVE taken this seriously are starting to get tired.
6048,20% of people not wearing masks is too many!
6049,"All it takes is a small minority of scofflaws to put everybody else, including their families and friends or whoever, at risk."
6050,I think he was originally vain about his appearance in a mask.
6051,For some of people I think it’s because their fat doesn’t fit in the mask and they’re uncomfortable or embarrassed.
6052,"He rejected them, now they all do ala Emperor’s Clothes."
6053,I make masks so I look at everyone’s masks and their fit.
6054,"Trump’s mask (on Friday) didn’t cover his double chin, it cuts it off."
6055,It’s like he’s wearing a cropped top with his muffin top spilling out.
6056,"If you tell everyone to stay home at smallest symptoms and to warn their contacts to self-isolate, unless severe symptoms start to show up - how is that making it harder to contain?"
6057,"Also, at that time - early March, Sweden was still contact tracing."
6058,The announcement for the change of strategy in testing came on 11th March AFTER confirmed wide community spread in Stockholm was clear - when people started ending up in hospital with severe symptoms that couldn't be traced to either their own travel or people that have traveled or people that were confirmed - or said in another way - the infection had reached the level in the population where the source couldn't be traced because it was too widely (and hidden) spread.
6059,She’s pretty brave / cool.
6060,Her tiktok is wild.
6061,"Perhaps we should not give helicopter rides to elected officials, particularly in an ""abundance of caution""."
6062,"Those helicopters might actually be more useful to transport very ill, but less wealthy, patients."
6063,"At one point in history, there was a special lifeboat reserved for the captain of a ship."
6064,Many ships only had the one lifeboat.
6065,Some captains abandoned their sinking ship and left their crews to die.
6066,"Eventually, a maritime law was made that required the captain to be the last soul to leave a sinking ship."
6067,"Since then, many more crew members have survived."
6068,"One report said that the shortage caused the panic buying, not the other way around."
6069,"Toilet paper used in offices and businesses is a different type, larger rolls, and the spike in using the home version caused temporary shortages."
6070,"Then that shortage triggered stockpiling, making it hard for distribution chains to catch up."
6071,I'm not sure why it wouldn't happen in other places.
6072,"A ""prepper"" mentality is probably more common in the US."
6073,What is this sub?
6074,I thought misinformation was disallowed here?
6075,Yeah they warned - and they were correct.
6076,Cases have spiked all over the country in the places where they *did not* enact appropriate measures.
6077,Everyone was right and you were wrong.
6078,"Now your fake-ass impeached POTUS has it too, literally right after mocking mask wearers on national television."
6079,This is like a bad joke that won’t end.
6080,So a gay fetus can be aborted by that logic.
6081,Interesting loophole.
6082,What would God do 🤷
6083,And the bleach.
6084,They haven't treated him with the bleach.

6103,Haha did you just admit that you are a troll hahaha
6104,More likely that he is positive.
6105,The test is very specific (low false-positive rate).
6106,"At worst I would say it's 50/50 based on a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 90-95%, which is about what I've seen reported."
6107,They definitely shouldn't assume that he is negative.
6108,"Do you have special knowledge that this was ""the first thing"" that Claudia did?"
6109,Or are you just making stuff up?
6110,"Look at my comment history, I'm not a fan of this guy."
6111,I do think it shows we're better if we aren't wishing him death.
6112,Do you want the moral high ground or to be on the same level as a rapist lying piece of shit?
6113,"I’m a kitchen manager so for 12+ hours a day I wear a mask and I fucking hate it, especially because it constantly fogs my glasses."
6114,As much as I hate them I understand the reason we wear them and am obligated to wear it to protect others and help people around me relax knowing that they are in a safe environment so I wear it all day without a single complaint.
6115,"You can hate masks, but if you care about your fellow human beings it’s no trouble at all."
6116,"The problem is that the GOP hates masks, and they also hate their fellow human beings."
6117,We're trying - I swear!
6118,I stand with the facts.
6119,"Things got bad, and then got better because of the measure, but the measures weren't adequate so things got worse, but not as bad as they were before, which is good, but not good enough that new measures aren't needed."
6120,This isn't a simple situation and it's not enough to pick a position and stick with it no matter what but rather to have a position based on facts and be willing to change your position as new facts become available.
6121,That's called being a responsible adult.
6122,Extended family may involve caretaking.
6123,"Oh, they're squarely on the left...

....but I think the picture they're painting is one that is consistent with a seemingly cavalier attitude of which their public behavior is indicative (even setting aside the mask issue)."
6124,"She is an egg donor, not a mother."
6125,I should be more specific.
6126,The outline of Trump as he moves shows what appear to be artifacts and blockiness associated with a simulated background (ie green screen).
6127,It stands out well with the contrasting dark suit against the white wall.
6128,"I would say that although I realise the importance of culture in a society, the spread of a highly virulent pandemic is more important than people having fun."
6129,I feel for the industries involved because i appreciate art and gastronomy but I can happily put it on the back burner when it comes to humanity and health.
6130,"I also agree that it is an over reaction when compared to yearly death figures but if it saves at least one life, it is worth it."
6131,"I am not looking for an argument, I am bemused by people's concerns about freedom Infringement."
6132,It's okay.
6133,"Trump says we'll wake up someday and it'll be gone, like a miracle."
6134,"they figured hes already severely confused and forgetful, it wouldnt take that much of a toll"
6135,"Turbulence typically is minimal at comfortable cruising altitudes, and I'm sure they'd be taking weather into account before cutting anybody open in flight."
6136,"Actually, I suspect I might have had it back in November 2019."
6137,Felt like I had a cinder block over my chest.
6138,No matter how much I breathed my lungs wouldn’t catch air.
6139,Fixed it by steaming up the bathroom with hot water and vaporizer with eucalyptus oil.
6140,Sat there for a good hour and was fine afterwards.
6141,Thanks for the wishful thinking though.
6142,"Edit: Of course, if I knew anything about Covid back then my first reaction would’ve been panicking, and I’d prob have died."
6143,"Covid 19

The numbers 19 = AI , artificial intelligence, which correspond to their place in the alphabet"
6144,I don’t want another lockdown and I’m not a bot.

6146,"Most people are vigilant w social distancing and masks, but we were at around 500 a day not to long ago."
6147,"It’s just hard with tourism, schools, and people becoming more lacks I hope you guys are doing ok."
6148,It’s depraved.
6149,It's now common to call an Uber rather than 911 in a medical emergency.
6150,Sad
6151,Most definitely.
6152,20k deaths.
6153,"Government said ""we must take care of our health, so later we can take care of the economy""."
6154,"7 months later we have a super low testing capacity with more than 40% positivity rate, a deep deep economic crisis and a lot of poverty."
6155,Oh and 20.000 people died.
6156,"The government misused resources, shocking."
6157,"In Mexico, 103-year-old woman said fuck you Covid-19"
6158,"A ""hundred"" times more !"
6159,Let's do some simple math on that.
6160,"With 200,000 US deaths in 8 months that would be about 300,000 in a year."
6161,One hundred times that equals about 30 million.
6162,At that rate the USA would be depopulated in a little over 10 years.
6163,"Many in the world would heave a giant sigh of relief, but such ignore the fact that the empires which are yet to come will be no better."
6164,No reason for excessive joy I'd say.
6165,[removed]
6166,&gt; but the motivation to try and skew the numbers makes me queasy.
6167,Yep.
6168,"Also it wastes resources (e.g if you have no symptoms and are mostly staying home, then noone is getting anything out of the test).. And, I wonder if it slows down the turnaround time for everyone else

Also, I'm worried that this stress on countable tests will delay introduction of rapid at-home tests (which cannot be counted but likely a far more efficient way to prevent the spread)...."
6169,I don't think they will have quite that level set up in the white house (but close to it) and I also have a feeling he will not be discharged Monday.
6170,I could be fully wrong on one or both of these but that's just the vibe I get.
6171,"It likely *will* be a mild case, thanks to that experimental drug and Remdesivir and whatever else they're throwing at him."
6172,What sucks is that other people don't get those drugs until they're critical and by then they're likely to have less of an impact.
6173,"And nobody is being given the experimental one, so basically he's alive because he's the Presidentd."
6174,I wonder if the people trapped in the car with him will be given these drugs if he gives them covid.
6175,Which companies??
6176,"Most major tech companies are remote now, in Japan."
6177,"to me, Trump appears extremely unhealthy."
6178,I wouldnt be surprised if he's in serious condition.
6179,Floridian here......lol
6180,He actually told people to wear them one time on Twitter.
6181,It was bizarre actually.
6182,https://i.imgur.com/hFFT4lt.jpg
6183,[removed]
6184,Which company’s did you get?
6185,Do you know?
6186,Can confirm.
6187,"They make you feel amazing, until you don’t."
6188,everybody is def tired of this shit.
6189,but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still killing folks with weaker immune systems.
6190,something youd rarely be able to tell by just looking at someone.
6191,just dont be an asshole.
6192,its that simple.
6193,Good thing we also have mathematicians and others who speak out against lockdowns then!
6194,"Ira Helsloot -a professor on Safety- argued back in April that the overcrowded hospitals would result in several hundred excess deaths on a population of 17 *million*, almost exclusively among elderly."
6195,This was using data that still vastly overestimated the IFR of COVID and models of the pro-lockdown experts themselves.
6196,"The devastating long-term effects on mental and physical health, as well as socio-economic effects he argued, would result in tens to even *hundreds of thousands* excess deaths, spread out over all ages, resulting in an even more disastrous loss of life years."
6197,"So no, lockdowns did not make the virus 4-5 times less lethal (where did you even pull that number from?...)"
6198,"but more like 1-10% less (because &gt;98% of people aren't going to be hospitalized from it, and most of the 2% who would die from it will not be saved by the IC)."
6199,And the price for that tiny decrease?
6200,An increase in mortality all across the nation that results in a thousand times more deaths.
6201,[removed]
6202,"They work but getting cases down to zero and keeping them there is only really feasible if you're an island or an authoritarian state like China, Vietnam etc."
6203,For most countries lockdown is only good as a strategy to reduce pressure on hospitals
6204,The workplace I just left didn't even think masks were necessary.
6205,They'd just stick with the 6 feet recommendation.
6206,I'm feeling glad I left...
6207,His ‘odds’ are not great.
6208,The virus kills 1 in 5 people in their 70’s.
6209,"Of the people that die - most are obese men with preconditions...

Further, the meds he is on have only reduced the death rate by about 20%...

And there are no odds for the completely experimental other drugs he is on - as he’s likely the only 70 year old ever to have taken them."
6210,"Further, the majority of people in this age bracket are having long term consequences if they do survive."
6211,It’s simply not just about survival.
6212,I mean - the reason he’s been on oxygen is because covid basically shreds the inside of your lungs.
6213,Saying any senior is going to fine after dealing with covid ignores everything we know about the disease.
6214,"Why everyone wants to ignore these facts, I don’t know."
6215,"&gt; So reality is much closer to the official statements...

imagine believing that Trump is saying the truth in the year of our lord 2020 lmao."
6216,Just pathetic.
6217,He is probably calling Dr Hannity what would be the proper treatment.
6218,Thats trump to a T
6219,Pro sports players (especially football) are tested almost bi-daily.
6220,"It seems harder and harder for players to spread it around their teams right now, look at Mane for instance."
6221,"Didn’t speak it to any of his team mates, pogba.. etc."
6222,"I'm familiar with that, it's why I am a lil nervous

I did not have this of all things on my 2020 bingo card"
6223,So it’s ok that he died?
6224,To try to learn from the past.
6225,The spanish flu is not unique in its October spike.
6226,What was unique was the intense severity of it.
6227,I guess they are assuming no Americans will take it.
6228,Preventing old and weak people from dying is much more important than your jobs or mass amounts of people becoming homeless.
6229,Wasn't that much mild about the Norwegian lockdown so I don't know what you mean by that.
6230,"No curfew but bars, schools, gyms, hairdressers, doctors beside GPs and hospital docs, all those closed."
6231,No visitations in hospitals or care homes.
6232,"Restaurants closed after 9 PM, several had to just close down altogether if they weren't big enough to accommodate the restrictions."
6233,Also no gatherings of more than 5 people for a time.
6234,Most cultural events were cancelled.
6235,But I guess compared to Italy that's mild
6236,Who is it that’s actually scared though?
6237,Everybody I know is tired of this shit and feels the same way.
6238,"That’s because those states have no state income tax, whereas New York has one of the highest income tax rates in the country and still can’t manage to pick up garbage."
6239,"So things got better because of the measures, but the measures were inadequate?"
6240,Can you decide where you stand?
6241,Enjoy getting Covid then.
6242,Took them long enough.
6243,"As soon as I saw description of MIS-C, I said “yep, that sounds a lot like what I’m dealing with...”"
6244,Which means he’s tested positive and is awaiting confirmation.
6245,He’ll be added to the list tomorrow.
6246,Keep it closed save yourselves.
6247,Dont let us plague rats in.
6248,- this pissed off ontarian.
6249,The guilt of infecting and causing the death of someone else.
6250,"If you want to purposely infect yourself in a controlled manner so you can play video games for two weeks and then enjoy that immunity life, I got no quibble with you."
6251,But you need to incorporate into your behavior that you are likely to have no symptoms and thus be contagious without knowing it.
6252,"So the key word is ""controlled"", as you would be immorally giving everyone else a bunch of unasked for risk if you were to simply go around not worrying about infecting yourself."
6253,Exactly
6254,"Sometimes not to the same ward, fwiw."
6255,:(
6256,I've been hoping I have been wrong (predicted 600k deaths by the end of 2020).
6257,I'm unfortunately not seeing to much that makes me feel like that will be the outcome.
6258,So is his golf cart thing in a sealed bubble or is the hospital just a covid zone now?
6259,"Yep, not because they are working in high risk jobs"
6260,And that 30% will keep Covid spreading in America.
6261,"The federal government has spent $6 trillion dollars this year and has failed to prevent &gt;200,000 people from dying of COVID in the US."
6262,How much would it take to make a meaningful dent in the problem?
6263,$10 trillion?
6264,$20 trillion?
6265,"I will, thank you old Mexican lady."
6266,"Remember when the conspiracy theory was that W had a ""polyp removal"" so he could give Dick Cheney presidential powers to get some shit done that would make W ""look bad""?"
6267,I miss those days

6296,"Anyone who challenges common sense is deemed to stupid, moronic, etc."
6297,and their ideas are dismissed as being fringe lunacy.
6298,It’s no secret that common sense is just middle-class white values passed on by elites as being the gold standard of thought and behavior.
6299,It’s why American dominant class holds those values in such esteem yet refuse to live by them.
6300,Pro sports is a business and people’s jobs.
6301,Amateur sports is leisure (and excercise I guess).
6302,I can see an argument for why they should be treated differently.

6335,&gt;We do have a leader who guided the country and made available any and all resources the states may need.
6336,He literally stole from states and stated the materials the federal government has is for them and not for the states.
6337,&gt;The president is not king.
6338,He can only put out guidelines and makes federal funding and resources available to each state but ultimately it's up to that individual state leadership to decide how to act.
6339,Look into the Defense Production Act.
6340,Or anything to do with the CDC.
6341,All the actions he took weakened the country.
6342,"Even if he didn't do anything, he still could have been better by not denying science."
6343,So yes trump is an awful person and the world would be better off if he wasn't president.

6354,To be fair.... How can we compete with 4 to 8 years of changeover and the 1970s KGB hell bent on destabilizing.
6355,"Most of the spread in Lombardy was in February and March, so this might tell us something about how long antibodies last."
6356,"Unless this area shot wayyyyyy past the herd immunity threshold, this would suggest that most people have antibodies that last in significant amounts for at least 7 months after infection."
6357,"I think you got it from your edit, but the point is that you use the tests to supplement proper procedures, not in place of them."
6358,Any test with less than 100% detection rate is necessarily going to let cases through so if that's your only defense then it's just a matter of time.

6361,Their entire party belief system is built on grievance politics.
6362,They are constantly searching for the next thing to turn into a political issue of ‘us vs them’ no matter the topic.
6363,It just so happens to be masks this time around which makes them look even dumber than they normally do.
6364,In Hungary the deaths are rising quite fast so they are probably testing less than in the Netherlands.
6365,"I think that the Netherlands is having the same problem than Finland, where I'm living, that mask use was discouraged at first so now people are reluctant to pick it up."
6366,"In this case, I think incompetence."

6375,"&gt;Nope, Florida, Arizona, California and Texas all see cases peak at summer

The US is a special case though... their numbers can hardly be trusted because they have corrupt governments at the local, state and national level."
6376,"Besides, the virus first began spreading in the US near the end of winter in the US."
6377,This winter it is starting from a much higher number and when winter really gets going I expect to see the numbers explode.

Bullshit."
6379,"Texas had over 2,400 new cases yesterday."
6380,"Florida had over 2,700."
6381,Those two states were ranked 4th and 6th out of all the states based on the number of new cases.
6382,"&gt;the decreasing deaths is a much more important factor than daily cases

Which is a result of better treatments being developed... one of the main reasons why preventing the spread of the virus in March was so important."
6383,"The longer people remained uninfected, the greater their chance of surviving infection if/when they do become infected."
6384,That is a well known factor of every emergent infectious disease.
6385,Delaying infection saves lives.
6386,"&gt;The daily cases stats is irrelevant anymore because this virus is here to stay

Bullshit."
6387,The only places that might be true is nations that did nothing to prevent their population from becoming infected in large numbers.

6501,Several days I think.
6502,"Basically COVID tests are good in the sense that positive definitely means you have it, but less good in the sense that negative doesn't mean you don't."
6503,"This is absolutely fine at the population level - e.g: if you test your city and x% of people get positive results, it gives you a good idea of how many people really have it, and so you can decide lockdown measures based on that."
6504,"But what people have been using it for all the time is for checking at the individual level, where someone gets a negative result and then takes it to mean that they are guaranteed non-infectious and can go about their day completely normally."
6505,This is the wrong way to use tests.
6506,"Sadly though, many organisations seem to think that a negative test result means that an individual should definitely come back to work/ back to school/ travel across the country to see their family instead of being housed at college for the holiday, etc etc..."
6507,"They opened everything, inclusive schools, months ago."
6508,"I worry about this, as some tests may only have 70% sensitivity (the chance of getting a false negative is 30%)."
6509,So the chance of two false negatives in a row is still 10% - not insignificant.
6510,Yet people overall seem ill informed about the sensitivity (or specificity - although that's usually much better).
6511,"If you want an honest answer, it’s because of a fundamental belief that government shouldn’t have control."
6512,"Not saying that’s a correct belief, so don’t just downvote this to hell everyone."

6514,"(I might be mistaking what you’re implying though)

Don’t you think it’s important to prevent non-essential large gatherings, like house parties, to reduce the number of people getting sick and dying from COVID?"

6521,That is the crux of he problem.
6522,Schools became a stand-in for all the other social supports that SHOULD have been in place.
6523,"That kids are not learning is on schools - that they have no access to daily free breakfast/lunch, mental health counsellors, social lives, physical exercise, trusted adults to confide in... well, we should have already had those in place outside of the school system."

6669,The White House theory seemed to be that no one has to wear a mask or be careful because they're tested regularly.

6680,A month or two ago they even announced that restaurants and bars should be prepared that the restrictions that have been in place since march might not be dropped until summer 2021.
6681,"&gt; like washing your hands, keeping a physical distance and staying home if you're sick."
6682,You mean all the things the US and other places where told to do before masks became the dominant advice?
6683,"Gee, i wonder why they're advising masks after that advice proved to not help with transmission rates, likely because most people ignored it, and you can't check if they washed or kept the right distance as you can with if they have a mask on or not."

6685,Are rotting for the nfl to not succeed?
6686,Saying “Never vote for a Republican” is part of the problem.
6687,These republicans are terrible but not every republican is.
6688,"To be fair, he mocks everything"
6689,"Actually, closing borders has always been seen as a limited defense unless supported by masks, social distance mandates and bar and restaurant closures."
6690,Crossing borders  is bad mostly just because of the means (air and train passenger-crowding) not the motion itself.
6691,People using socially managed transport to cross into and out of socially regulated virus containment zones won't alter the virus spread enough to justify closing borders.
6692,It's why the Republican murder barrons flying maskless as campaign stunts is so sinful.
6693,Hey buddy - we are about three weeks after the KC game.
6694,How are the Titans doing?
6695,No and it is not going to be the last either.
6696,But we can do well or better if we just band together and do better together with following recommendations and mandates.

6700,It’s not exclusive to Republicans.
6701,When the White House closed the borders back in March(?)
6702,the Democrats where up in arms about how that was a terrible idea and also racist.
6703,It’s an American politic problem.
6704,I guarantee that if Republicans embraced the mask mandates and pushed them the democrats would be the ones pushing back hard.

6707,"&gt;Amid the escalating COVID-19 crisis, Indian journalists reporting on government mismanagement of the pandemic are facing prosecution or intimidation from authorities while at the same time being hindered by restrictions on accessing information."
6708,"&gt;Since March, at least 55 journalists have been arrested, investigated or questioned by police across India in connection with their COVID-19 reporting or for alleged lockdown violations, according to a report by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group, a New Delhi-based think tank."
6709,"&gt;Authorities have opened criminal investigations against many of the journalists for allegedly publishing false reports and for violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, a colonial-era law that grants the state sweeping powers."
6710,"In conjunction with other statutes, the law has been cited by authorities threatening journalists with fines and up to two years in prison."

6726,"Also the age of people does not really matter, its 50/50 in every age range (from what i see) 

What i find intriging is that couples sometimes come in where 1 of them uses a mask and the other does not, or friendgroups where some do wear masks and others dont."

6751,Do you speak the language of a capitalist sir?
6752,Isn't that a great value?
6753,Quantitative vs qualitative analysis.
6754,Not much thought is put into half measures or actual outcomes of policies.
6755,Only that policies were inacted and resemble promises.
6756,There is no qualitative analysis at all really.
6757,"When you dig in to these promises, you realize that nothing effectively has changed in a vast majority of cases."
6758,Take my example of trump's wall.
6759,You have to acknowledge why promises are made: ostensibly to change something.
6760,"We must make our framework qualitative analysis of change, not just a meaningless tally."
6761,"If you want to argue that qualitative doesn't matter, then promises are irrelevant you could say anything and do anything else while identifying it as a promise kept."
6762,"If we don't analyze outcomes, it is asinine."
6763,"Actually, this is donald trump's exact MO."
6764,Make promises and then simply declare that you are doing it.

6775,I think if it’s the Hasidim it will help.
6776,"They can’t shop in stores that don’t sell kosher food, or eat at restaurants that aren’t kosher."
6777,They also generally avoid stores where the other customers are also not Hasidim.
6778,You keep jumping to the conclusion that I can’t see your point of view.

6787,I ran the numbers on having 25 parties with 100 people getting tested 3x with a 15% failure rate each.
6788,It was a forgone conclusion that the president was going to be exposed to coronavirus several times.
6789,“Tomorrow” the NYC Stock Market opens.
6790,It was not a co-incidence that the announcement of him leaving for hospital was delayed until the Markets closed.
6791,"We are going to be told tomorrow morning that he is doing “better”, so the market can rally enough for the wealthy republicans to dump as much stock as possible in case he does decline."
6792,They have to push a positive narrative just till tomorrow morning.
6793,Literally impossible for the IFR of COVID to be that much lower than the flu.
6794,"Flu kills 35,000 on average in the US with no social distancing, no unprecedented shutdowns, no masks."
6795,"We are now at over 200,000 dead, with the majority in late winter/early spring, when Flu dies down."
6796,"We haven't even started winter, barely touched fall and cases spiking."
6797,"But, please, keep jumping through convoluted mathematical obstacle courses to convince yourself it's just the flu."
6798,"I mean reading the sources it just seems like what they are agreeing on is that they will not see a second wave like the first one in march because they have measures in place to prevent the virus from spreading like it did back then, and they won't see one like the rest of europe as well because the measures are consistent instead of going from lockdown to no lockdown."
6799,All of them are saying that the cases might rise again but that it will be more of a trickle into a bump than a wave with a peak.
6800,As opposed to zombies in the brain-dead Trump army?
6801,Funny how much they project on others what they do themselves.
6802,Had my first COVID test the other day.
6803,5 seconds in each nostril.
6804,"10/10 would get swabbed again, really helped clear out my nose from fall allergies."
6805,People in my state are throwing tantrums because they don’t want to wear a mask.
6806,"So many protests/rallies over it, many wearing those mesh masks I’ve seen more and more often."
6807,"I know it’s to make a statement but if they’re going to wear a mask that doesn’t help just put on a damn mask that does and stop saying your rights are being infringed on, that claim is just downright stupid."
6808,"Mask mandates are not the same thing as wearing a masks, you can wear one while also opposing the mask mandates."
6809,People oppose mask mandates because they see it as a violation of freedom (the freedom to choose whether or not to wear a mask).
6810,We knew this in 08 tho
6811,yeah!
6812,why not?

6815,"Formula 1 has just as many if not more people from drivers to pit crew, trackside engineers, Marshall’s, stewards, reps from Pirelli, the culinary staff, etc."
6816,and they travel from country to country on top of that.
6817,"They used a mini bubble system where at the track the teams and each group (journalists, and other non teams people) have their own bubble with no mixing."
6818,The drivers still mix but they aren’t doing anything crazy like hitting each other but it still works.
6819,Also each person has their own smaller bubble which is their family back home and before you leave one and enter another you get tested.
6820,It’s worked so far no positives from race weekends but there have been some prior to race weekends which then means you don’t allow that person to go keeping the main bubble safe.
6821,"I know football is a different sport especially with the contact aspect of it but the bubble is the way to go, pick a couple stadiums like NHL and play out of their and live in hotels."
6822,"It works, the NFL just seems stubborn wanting to play, have fans, travel, etc."
6823,it’s just not going to work.
6824,Guess the only fun thing this winter will be doing donuts in the snow.
6825,"Which wouldn’t do shit because studies have shown that the belief that “Heavy droplet transmissions” somehow makes the risk of infecting any higher is pure bs and Tiny droplets have the same effect...  

Only thing that will prevent the virus from spreading in mask way is if you wore an N95 mask, Or other types of respirators... Other than that it’s a vaccine, washing your hands and not being like a bunch of packed sardines that will help you the most.."

6840,I think his explainer of quarantine and isolation are excellent.
6841,"And timely, since I’m on day 13 of quarantine following a significant exposure."
6842,Important to remember that a negative test on day 7 (like I had) is not a reliable indicator of status on day 14.

6991,He was at least given the regeneron drug through iv.
6992,"And I'm unfamiliar with hydration ever meaning no iv, as I'm used to it meaning the opposite, but it's certainly common for fluids to be given through iv for even for trivial reasons."
6993,"I feel like a covid-19 infected president would be most likely given iv for fluids for easier monitoring, even if the regeneron drug wasn't given all throughout the night."
6994,Someone correct me if I'm wrong or off.
6995,"Doubt it, nobody was probably infected there"
6996,"Well, he might pre-record before his symptoms worsened."
6997,Quite a list of virtual nobodies.
6998,So glad Christie can just check himself into a hospital when most of us regular ppl have to have symptoms before we can even get a test.

7004,"Yeah, you're right."
7005,"I mean it's all various degrees of probability all the way down of course, but broadly speaking it sounds like you're more likely to start testing positive around the same time you start showing symptoms."
7006,"&gt; A study that examined false-negative rates post-exposure, found that during the four days of infection prior to symptom onset, the probability of a false negative on the PCR test went from 100 percent on Day 1 to 67 percent on Day 4."
7007,"And even on the day individuals began showing symptoms, the false negative rate was still 38 percent, dropping to 20 percent three days after symptom onset."

7016,"Unlike alcohol, COVID deaths aren’t a choice many are making and at the rate of spread it’s going to eventually kill a lot more than 3 mil a year cause this shit ain’t going away anytime soon."
7017,It fits their “wear a mask if you feel sick” narrative.
7018,They can’t grasp that you can be infectious and feel perfectly fine.

7065,"&gt; Discussion of herd immunity

Damn, you can't even discuss this now?"
7066,I am not making a claim of fact as the birthers did.
7067,I am merely making an observation and positing a single possibility while not saying it is any more or less likely than any other.
7068,Just that I would not be surprised.
7069,Why are you taking this so personally?
7070,"I cannot imagine how despondant you must have been when you found out that Trump was purposefully lying and downplaying the seriousness of the virus since that is something that mattered and actually killed over 200,000 if you are this upset over a single possibility that is not a lie in any way shape or form."
7071,&gt;I don't need a source to prove the made up scenario in your head isn't real.
7072,And that is not what you need to do.
7073,You need to prove that what I said is impossible.
7074,"I already admitted multiple times it isn't real, but you took it a step further and said it was *wrong*, as in not possible."
7075,"So, unless you are just making things up yourself, where is the evidence you are using to make the claim that my suggestion is impossible?"
7076,"Edit: I see you are a big fan of cancel culture, isn't that against the rest of your party and their platform?"
7077,They're screwing a pangolin from Wuhan at this rate... metaphorically speaking of course.
7078,That would be ok if they were only gambling with their own lives.
7079,Not unnecessary.
7080,"There hasn't been a large increase, schools started and is it where it would have exploded by now, parents have the option to online learning in most places, they still sent them in."
7081,"Just because your risk tolerance is lower, doesn't make you and more right that you can just say it was the wrong decision because people have to work and are ok with something you aren't."
7082,"His work is for his constituents, and if more than half are back in classrooms, he did the right thing for the risk vs benefit."
7083,In fact it's more selfish for you to ask those parents to put themselves in a position to not be able to afford to work.
7084,So much for that famed 'travel bubble'

7086,"Yes, it has what is called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)."

7092,At a military hospital and being commander in chief he can tell them to say whatever to the public.
7093,Remember how his physical had him at 244lbs?
7094,!
7095,It's a national security issue.
7096,They know he's too proud to invoke the 25th so if enemies got wind that the president was incapacitated that would be an ideal time to launch... Something.
7097,I don't know what.
7098,A vaccine will only end masking and distancing for morons with no knowledge base.
7099,Yep
7100,Tell that to the ppl with long term damage.
7101,"Agreed friend, hopefully he wins"

7109,Vietnam 2 - USA 0
7110,Maybe it’s because I’m no expert but that doesn’t look like it’s obviously an edit
7111,Atlesst it’s still not as bad as the US.
7112,Normally I would say that this a ploy to get sympathy and prove that the virus is no big deal.
7113,But I honestly think they’re in deep shit and it’s going to get really bad very soon.

7120,3.
7121,It was at the Purple Wedding that the victim couldn't breathe.
7122,The only part that's similar with the Red Wedding is a bunch of people from the same faction getting it at the same time.
7123,Ask Trump how that's going?
7124,"Oh right, he's in the hospital with covid."
7125,"He's known the entire time how deadly it really is, you hear him in the interview recordings talking about it like its the deadliest thing since the holocaust and then days later talking about it vanishing in the heat, that it's completely controlled and not even as dangerous as the flu... even though he said exactly the opposite in the recordings of the interview."
7126,?
7127,It just looks like he says 'which' a bit oddly
7128,No one is going to theaters in April either.....
7129,"Sir, this is a Wendy's."
7130,Holy shiiiiiiiiit
7131,&gt;Covid-19 has proved itself an unpredictable and ever-changing threat.
7132,"As President Trump and some of his allies and associates test positive for the coronavirus, the number of new cases reported each day across the United States has been slowly rising."
7133,The nation’s response has been uneven and inconsistent.
7134,Here is where the country is now.
7135,&gt;The U.S. is at a key moment in the pandemic.
7136,"Spread of the virus could worsen significantly through the autumn, experts fear, as colder weather forces people indoors."
7137,"Winter, paired with a new flu season, could make the precarious situation of today even worse."
7138,"Every day, some 43,000 new cases are being reported — far fewer than were being identified during the surge in the summer, but still an uncomfortably large number."
7139,"&gt;From the hospital where Mr. Trump is being treated, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, “Tremendous progress has been made over the last 6 months in fighting this PLAGUE.”

&gt;But the pace has been ticking upward slowly since the middle of September as the virus reached parts of the country that hadn’t been hit hard before."
7140,"By this weekend, 7.3 million people in the United States — some of them at the highest reaches of the federal government — were known to have been infected."
7141,"More than 208,000 people have died."
7142,I doubt we will see anything like March and April again.
7143,We understand this thing a lot more now than we did then.
7144,The ELITE will always get better care.
7145,That is part of life.
7146,They will do all they can to keep Leaders of Countries alive.
7147,"According to all the CDC rules, a ton of different Republicans (Barr, Pence, etc.)"
7148,should be quarantining despite their current negative tests but aren't
7149,"Also, he completely ignored the fact that Covid-19 is far deadlier and far more contagious than the season flu(s) that hit us every fall and winter, scoffing at precautions, and that over 200, 000 Americans have died from it already."
7150,Yep.
7151,My husb had a negative test and his work said keep your ass home.
7152,They are super careful.
7153,Unlike our nation's leaders.

7162,1 million is not a large number when you think about the total number of people on the planet.
7163,A lot of the ones that died were unhealthy and probably not long for this world anyway.
7164,The UFC has started doing EKGs on fighters that have tested positive and recovered.
7165,I'll be very interested to see their results after they've checked a large number of athletes
7166,Needing supplemental oxygen has historically been a strong indicator that a patient is in big trouble.
7167,Maybe not today but it’s the first sign that it’s headed that way.
7168,That's not IFR.
7169,"IFR requires knowledge of all cases, including ones that aren't formally diagnosed."

7172,Back in March he told us to take it on the chin.
7173,"Then the report from imperial college London that predicted at least 250,000 deaths came out."
7174,There was a petition for a lockdown circulating at least a week before it started.
7175,"It had over 600,000 signatures when I saw it."
7176,He also skipped 5 consecutive COBRA meetings in January and February.
7177,Then they gave us restaurant subsidies and told us to go and use them to help the economy.
7178,"It could help the debates, if Trump's too exhausted to try to interrupt and yell over everyone."
7179,"Ok, fair point!"
7180,"Lol blame China again and not ur incompetent leaders or the dumbass majority of Americans that voted him in

I’m here in NZ eating popcorn"
7181,You blame China but they have less deaths than most hard hit countries.
7182,Where is it that you think it's gone exactly?
7183,"Chris Christie was a easy target, lot of area for the virus to latch on to."
7184,I'm sure is health is not the best either.

7298,The average antibody lifespan of common cold current virus is 6 months.
7299,We should assume that covet 19's average antibody lifespan is 6 months until we have evidence otherwise.
7300,We might get lucky and the average immunity is 24 months but that still means some people will lose immunity in 6 months or less because it's an average and it varies wildly.
7301,I also don't think you will have effective immunity for 24 months even if you were to have detectable antibodies.
7302,You might be slightly more resistant but still infectious as well and you won't know when your immunity drops.
7303,Relying on immunity with a current of virus is a nightmare and I'm not sure if the vaccines are going to bypass that problem because ideally we don't want to have to get a vaccine and then a booster shot and then repeat that process every three to six months though you know it's better than nothing.
7304,Alternately everybody could just wear masks and it would mostly go away....like magic.

7314,You have the craziest luck if you know 3 of the 11 total people worldwide that have been re-infected with Covid!
7315,What are the odds.
7316,"[Source](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1308718671120957441?s=21)

Or... you're lying."
7317,Or the people who you are talking to or lying.
7318,"Yea, its definitely someone lying in your story."
7319,"If we all cooperated on wearing masks, washing our hands, and adhering to social distancing recommendations we wouldn't be in the position we're in with, correct me if I'm wrong, 208K deaths from COVID in the US."
7320,Instead of cooperating we've somehow regressed into petty tribalism.
7321,If we'd cooperated as a species this pandemic could have been mitigated.
7322,We would have still lost lives because that's the nature of this virus.
7323,How many people would still be among us had we cooperated?

7331,I get that but CDC says wait two weeks.
7332,If he's out in a couple days he either virus free or an idiot.
7333,"Oh, wait..."
7334,"For an asymptomatic reinfection, can we even consider it a reinfection?"
7335,"It could be bystander virus being picked up with the test as occurs with numerous other viruses such as measles where a person is immune, but virus can be detected when swabbed."
7336,no idea why you're downvoted for speaking the truth man
7337,He looks really pale but I can't tell if it's the covid or because he couldn't put on his orange bronzer
7338,"""Women are too emotional"" is codespeak for ""women daring to speak against men""."
7339,Thoughts and prayers to the family during this difficult time...
7340,If Trump had first symptoms Wednesday he was infected ~saturday.
7341,"The debate test would have been positive (Tuesday would have been peak infectiousness),  and he obviously knew he was sick or he wouldn't have known to skip it."
7342,The timeline makes perfect sense when you just ignore the lies aka everything from the white house.
7343,But that isn't what the data has shown on lockdowns.
7344,"Unless you are stalling towards obtaining needed supplies, or to prevent overwhelming of the Healthcare system, they have little utility, and come with a big cost."
7345,"Nope, incorrect, we have used it to trace the transmission chain within the community because there are potential multiple incoming sources, all slightly different, so we have been able to trace that X caught one variant from Y wheres A caught a different variant from B."
7346,"We have used that to establish multiple sources of transmission in the last couple of months, especially in cases where individuals caught the virus while in Isolation, in one particular case we genomically identified that a quarantine worker had caught their variant from a particular infected person even though there had been no direct contact and were then able to establish the epidemiological link (a lift button) by checking video footage."
7347,"We have been able to genomically connect numerous new infections in the community to one of about three or four different source cases over the last couple of months, and later back trace the epidemiological link based on shared contact chains."
7348,It hugely simplifies the contact tracing process and has helped us stop reemergence and spread early.
7349,We are now 8 days with no community spread.
7350,It hasn’t been approved yet by the fda for covid but there is a special authorization for really sick people to take it because it’s all we have.
7351,I think they would have to prove it’s safe and effective (finish the clinical trials) in order to give more people.
7352,Republicans are super spreaders of virus.
7353,About 5% of people have antigens presernt after 30 days.
7354,95% have lost immunity.
7355,o yes?
7356,"I need to watch all of it, then."
7357,I bailed around 3 minutes.
7358,The difference is those frat boys will be ridiculed and possibly suspended by ND while the ND President will be given millions of dollars and won’t get half the shit his students will.
7359,"Yep, pretty much 14 days where you don't know unless you start to show symptoms."
7360,Testing daily will help catch it quicker if he is positive and there are some treatments that seem effective if the virus is caught early.
7361,It seems like for contact tracing they go back 48hrs from onset of symptoms and contact all of those in close contact.
7362,We still don't know enough about this virus to know at what point you maybe contagious following an exposure.
7363,Remember a test is a snapshot in time and that picture can change hourly.
7364,This is gonna be a blessing in disguise.
7365,I can forsee infection rates going down as people begin to take this more seriously.
7366,Masks and social distancing will be properly implemented by more people as a direct result of this.
7367,I finally had to google what that was.
7368,It's a very odd thing to do oneself.
7369,"Sure, that's just like in other countries."
7370,The difference still being that once community spread is significantly reduced it's not nearly as difficult to corral new outbreaks.
7371,I am sure what he sees in the mirror is nowhere near the same thing that we see.
7372,Have you seen her prosecute or when it's her turn to talk?
7373,She's not like Trump and will speak out of turn.
7374,"Or at least, she may speak out of turn but not as much as that is ""normal""."
7375,Trump's interruptions were like a thousand fold beyond normal.
7376,I guess we will know in a few days.
7377,I had a bad case and I didn't start to get real worried until after day 8 when I would wake up gasping for air and my lungs sounded like rice crispies when I was breathing.
7378,"Then again I didn't have start of the art medicine, just some vitamins and tylenol."
7379,"Well, if the business had put every precaution in place, there would be no negligence."
7380,"However the anti mask places that force their employees to work and get exposed to the virus with no masks, and the employee or their parents / grandparents die, that business should be 100% liable."
7381,I'd imagine your tune would change if someone close to you died of COVID because someone else was negligent.
7382,For sure I'd think my loved ones lost lives were worth more than the $0 that Desuckthis is proposing.
7383,Taiwan President Tsai is the best.
7384,Better than Ardern even.
7385,He's supposed to be in Arizona next week too.
7386,"Why Is, the Title of the Article, Written Like This."
7387,The Queen fired the prime minister?
7388,I thought it was the Governor General who in turn was appointed by the Prime Minister.
7389,"Who also cannot really do anything without the advise of parliament, the prime minister except where there is a deadlock can he/she legally exercise some limited powers on his own (call an election or appoint a new pm)."
7390,"Ya the longer it is, the more likely it is to get reinfection."
7391,But there's been millions of infections and only a few dozens of confirmed reinfections.
7392,This Fall and Winter is going to be a wild ride.
7393,of course

7444,I don't want him dead of rona.
7445,I just want him out of office.
7446,They'd probably be doing this regardless of who is President.
7447,You don't let people know if the President is in dire straights as it is a moment of weakness and uncertainty for the country which can be exploited.
7448,And the moment they lift it they get cases again.

7466,So many selfish idiots out there
7467,I’m Australian and I’ve never heard a rule about mandatory quarantine if you spend 90 minutes in the same room as someone who later tests positive.

7474,My wife (a medical doctor) did mention oxygen was preferred now over ventilators if breathing is still possible.
7475,What most people don't realize about that video where Trump declined the 'peaceful transition' question is that Trump was gesturing the reporter to take off his mask while asking the question.
7476,"I hope a compilation comes out of every time he did shit like this, asking people to personally put themselves at risk."

7694,"(but by all means, go huff all the covid you want)"
7695,It depends on how you calculate case fatality rates (CFR).
7696,Daily updated numbers worldwide are available on the [Johns Hopkins Covid19 Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
7697,There are basically two ways to do the calculation while a pandemic/epidemic is still in progress.
7698,One is to divide the total deaths by the total cases.
7699,The other is to divide the deaths by the sum of deaths and recovered.
7700,When a pandemic has finally run its course the two numbers will be equal.
7701,By the first method the CFR globally is 3.0% and that of the USA is 2.9%.
7702,By the second method the global rate is 4.1% and that of the USA is 6.7%.
7703,When looking at the international situation it has to be understood that the most reliable numbers will be from countries with free universal health care and with lesser social inequality.
7704,"Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand come to mind."
7705,The USA fails on both counts but not as badly as some other countries.
7706,"India, Brazil, etc.."
7707,Both factors increase the *undercount* so that the numbers in a country such as the USA are in reality greater than what the reports say.
7708,So there are still many deaths yet to come.

7982,"Regardless though, all markets do need to work to be sanitary here in 2020, in every country, and deforestation needs to stop."
7983,We have a lot of work to do and we need to be prepared for the future.
7984,One of the leading German experts says this could also be a seasonal effect.
7985,"He says science does not know why, but respiratory issues are always less severe during the summer months."
7986,He says he would not be surprised to see the deaths clime with colder weather again.
7987,He also poses the hypothesis that masks help limit the initial viral load at infection which decreases the chances of a severe infection.
7988,Kinda of like calling anti-fascists fascists.
7989,"Europe doesn't have Trump at the helm, and they are also doing badly."
7990,The weasel words the doctors used at the update press conference don't exactly inspire confidence either.

7994,"Pretty much \*everything\* should be copied from Sweden, at least the points you mentioned 

\*Except\* for not having a lockdown and no-masking."
7995,"Not locking down allowed for an appalling amount of fatalities, for an extended amount of time, and without any proof of increased immunity as winter has not even begun."
7996,It will be long months until next spring.
7997,"Cases here in Germany increase, too."
7998,Just not as much as in other countries.
7999,I actually think we are doing pretty well.
8000,"Masks are mandatory in shops, bars and public transport."
8001,Plus we gotta leave our personal information at restaurants so we can trace a possible transmission there.
8002,"We also have a ""Corona-App"" which helps contact tracing."
8003,"And in case there is a local outbreak  we have local lockdowns, which means only a county has to go on lockdown instead of the state or the whole country."
8004,Been hearing this for last 3 months
8005,And the reflections are photoshopped?
8006,"&gt;In the case of a vaccine with non sterilizing immunity, we could still experience surges but hospitalizations/deaths would go down."
8007,"To me, that is still effective

It's not effective for immune-compromised people and other very vulnerable people."
8008,Pro virus?
8009,Is that even a thing
8010,Even if we DID do that.
8011,Are we expected to do it every year when cases get this high?
8012,Every year take 2-3 months under house arrest just to keep the elderly and those with diabetes alive?
8013,Like I said: what is the end game.
8014,Transparency is important for policy buy in.
8015,The idea of rolling lockdowns forever is implausible.

8032,Trump was actively undermining regulations by resisting wearing a mask.
8033,"This supported members of his political base who showed low compliance with pandemic measures, and societal acceptance is critical for the efficacy of prevention measures."
8034,"Furthermore, the RKI came out with very clear guidelines that German states have been following since day 1, with a high cooperation between the federal and state levels."

1."
8070,There was never any (significant) relaxing.
8071,Basically the same measures and messages from the government.

Eradicating small pox was a decades-long project, and at no point did we lock down or social distance."
8084,"It seems like it actually can be fairly threatening for a 74 year old obese male, that's not a great risk profile."
8085,Time will tell though
8086,Covid hasn't mutated once.
8087,And 17 years of research into SARS shows that immunity lasts at least 17 years.
8088,Why are we ignoring that and only paying attention to more distantly related viruses?

8097,I need to see this; I've been dying to know.

8130,"Sure but the root comment in this thread mentioned how some governments were considered ""geniuses"" in managing this virus."
8131,"And we all know Trump has been considered ""inept"" in his handling of the virus."
8132,And there's no question that Germany's government has been praised for how it handled the virus.
8133,"So I guess my question is, what are different governments doing differently to handle the virus?"
8134,How much of the virus prevalence can be attributed to government policies?
8135,And how much due to random factors and/or general lifestyle factors like you mentioned?
8136,"And I say this out of confusion, living in Germany, and not understanding what we're supposedly doing differently."
8137,Our regulations were the same or more lax than the USA's.
8138,And certainly more lax than France's.
8139,I just don't get it.
8140,At that rate we’ll never reopen :)

8153,In Britain atleast over the past few months because of lock downs etc we've missed millions of cancer screenings and have carried out tens of thousands fewer cancer treatments than expected.
8154,That's going to cost a great many lives and is just cancer.

8195,"No contacts, wearing masks and keep everyone at 2m distance and windows open, for 2-3 months, done by everyone."
8196,Of course the virus would still spread among cohabitants and some risky jobs.
8197,But it would be trapped in bubbles and end dying off.
8198,Because it dissappears in a few weeks if it has no new host.
8199,"Then the corona could be controlled, with only isolated outbreaks that can be controlled too."
8200,"And we could go back to normal life, clean of virus and without the dead, the sequels, the economic losses...The problem here is people are so selfish and mentally weak, they are unable to do that for a couple of months in order to go back to normal."
8201,"They they prefer to let others die, which is what they think they are doing, but they are going to pay too: they will pay for the economic crisis one way or another, and at some point they will also reach vulnerable age, and then the virus will catch them and to its job."
8202,"Sorry but if you want to be poorer and see your life expectancy reduced, you cannot expect the rest of us to think the same."

8265,A crucial aspect of herd immunity is some kind of uniform (or balanced by reproductive rate in that area) distribution of that immunity.
8266,"The problem with the massive explosions we saw in March is that 1/300 of NYC died and 20-25% (according to their serology tests) of the city gained immunity, but there could well have been places that were nearly untouched just because they were a few days behind the rest of the city."

8308,"&gt; As time went on though, I noticed way more people out and about doing regular life stuff, far fewer grocery bags, chin diaper masks, and your standard NYC brunch-at-all-costs crowd back to their 6-hour outdoor seating boozy brunches, etc."
8309,This is the problem with blaming Trump for everything.
8310,At the end of the day everyone just gives up.
8311,Can't really blame him for human nature.
8312,Let's take a step back here.
8313,We are dealing with low-attention span modern humans in an era of defiance and misinformation.
8314,Do not forget the western world hasn't known real pain or hardship in over 75 years.
8315,Almost all westerners have had fairly pampered lives compared with poorer less lucky humans.
8316,"A ton of my friends reluctantly accepted the lockdown,  then the masks."
8317,"But there's real fatigue among people who have never been told what to do, ever."
8318,You want to keep all people engaged for the common good.
8319,The vacations happened when infections were very low and they were a safety valve.
8320,I was on the beach from late May up to 2 weeks ago.
8321,It was busy.
8322,What happened was predictable.
8323,"The young moved in tribes in July and August, partied together on the beach and spread the virus among their age class."
8324,"Now they're back to their families, studies,  jobs and spreading the virus to others."
8325,The authorities knew this would happen but who would blame them?
8326,Defiance to authority is in the French DNA.
8327,"My hunch is people will say without hyperbole ""DJT Decimated America""."

8329,As in the previous hard lock down many people fled Madrid to their summer houses or to their relative houses.
8330,Also there is not enough police to control 24/7 who enters or leaves the conifned zones so yes is a another waste of time since people come and go as they want.
8331,If you think Spain is different then Madrid is extraordinary.
8332,The hell are they doing in france ?
8333,Are they trying to match trumps level of incompetence ?
8334,"Yeah but no one's counting the ones that are literally not counted, making them rather useless for statistics."
8335,"Hah, Wasn't this going to happen in November?"
8336,They are using the same 2 week lockdown tactic regarding the vaccine - it comes out in October!
8337,"Well no, but for Christmas we have it ready."
8338,In February we start vaccinations and the spring will be just fine.
8339,Vaccine in the summer!
8340,Pack your bags for a beach holiday...
8341,I feel like showing a clear lack of judgment should be a disqualifier for ... you know ... a nominee for supreme court judge.
8342,You talking about trump?
8343,"True, but if he gets sick enough, or if other major politician get sick enough, this may work too to have people realising it's serious."
8344,Somehow it's weird and wasn't a chance that COVID hit so late your federal politicians.
8345,In my country we had a cluster in the Assembly in March.
8346,"I can assure you that a couple of countrywide known politicians suddenly dying (including a department president, see that as a governor) was a good trigger for everybody start taking this seriously."
8347,Im French and I have to disagree.
8348,"Here test are 100% free, lot of people are getting tested, way more than anywhere else in EU."
8349,"Most new cases are got by people eating together and doing parties, that why restaurant and bar are slowly getting closed everywhere."
8350,"Everyone who is tested positive have to be confined for 10 days, and have to declare everyone he got in contact without mask for the last week, I order to get them confined and tested."
8351,"My gov is doing a very good job indeed, sadly people don’t seems to care."
8352,"Even in the country of equality, people are selfish as fuck."
8353,In the UK this isn't the case.
8354,It's because we are opening up.
8355,June/July/August saw no real rises in cases but in September we sent children back to school and our government has ad campaigns to get people back to the office.
8356,2 weeks later cases started doubling.
8357,That's clearly working... ~s
8358,Congrats for contracting covid then?
8359,"Not to that extent, but the informal economies of other Mediterannean countries and some western countries is too big too."
8360,"Why does France or Belgium need to have 100% debt levels, or the UK at 85%?"
8361,We agreed in 1992 in Maastricht that should have been brought back to 60% and no progress has been made in the good years.
8362,"Those countries just won't cut exoenditures due to too strong anti-austerity unions, but their current expenditures, unbalanced in non-crisis times, aren't sustainable and extra taxes unfeasible (FR and BE already have &gt;50% of GDP taxed)

As a decades long fiscal conservative, specifically for reasons to be able to absorb shocks, I hate this crisis is proving me right."
8363,Hopefully the pandemic can show Americans what happens when toxic individualism and ideologies built on it result in
8364,We don't know how long immunity lasts.
8365,You can lead the donkey to the water but you can’t make it drink.
8366,"What I mean by that is you can’t fine people into following restrictions, or at least it won’t be nearly as effective as convincing people that need to do it and make them *want* to do it."
8367,Total lockdowns can possibly be “policed” but those aren’t very sustainable and are only really useful as a last resort if hostpitals are filling up.
8368,Maintaining good adherence to the “invisible” rules is only possible if people want to.
8369,"People who feel they are forced to wear a mask aren’t going to follow the even more important mitigations (distancing, isolation when symptomatic)."
8370,"Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan have decent stats and are not communist."
8371,People are generally more compliant and social pressure is high.
8372,They are densely populated and experienced past epidemics so learnt their lessons.
8373,Some of them had their shortcomings exposed last time eg.
8374,South Korea's CDC.
8375,"Their govt took active measures to reform and while not perfect, their competence this time round could only be dreamed at by many countries."
8376,They actually had super spreaders and events whereby it looked like they would lose control but each time they managed to get ahead of it.
8377,"Looking at China, I think aggressive and authoritarian measures were needed in some places."
8378,Communism doesn't necessarily mean people are socially minded.
8379,That's because the city will literally murder your family if you throw a party by shutting off essential utilities.
8380,Running water and electricity are a recognized human right in the world but LA mayors don't care.
8381,Directed by Michael Bay.
8382,We had 1 million during the end of winter/spring and summer.
8383,"I think we double that number for fall and winter in the northern hemisphere, so 2 more million by the end of February?"
8384,I'm in Paris.
8385,Everything has been open for months now and most people have been back in the office.
8386,The only difference is everyone wears masks everywhere and there's hand sanitizer all over the place.
8387,Was only a matter of time before cases started climbing.
8388,Fortunately things aren't as bad as they were in March (yet).
8389,"Looking only at the daily new cases now compared to March, when there was no testing available, is a little misleading."
8390,Earths population keeps increasing by about 200k every day.
8391,Coronavirus is not even taking a dent in our ecosystem killing population growth.
8392,"Yeah, people don't care about dying, they just don't like smoke."
8393,[removed]
8394,I haven't seen anybody not wearing a mask in weeks.
8395,5% of drivers are wearing masks when they're driving by themselves.
8396,Even the homeless are wearing masks.
8397,People are taking it seriously in my neighborhood.
8398,I agree with you!
8399,I hope that doesn’t happen when a vaccine gets approved immediately.
8400,I jus hope with a widely available vaccine early next year we can knock this thing out ASAP.
8401,I wonder if it has anything to do with certain groups of people averaging with lower emotional intelligence and therefore only being able to sympathize when it personally affects them.
8402,"Wow, imagine thinking - with this covid pandemic, let’s pull back on our rhino horn purchases until this is all through."
8403,"And then realized, there’s still half the demand out there of people who thought - I still need my rhino horns..."
8404,"And a lot of them are getting money from the state, understanding compromises from their landlords, and social security."
8405,"The US is the only state in the first world with an eviction problem right now

Everyone I know in my country had their rent halved or forfeit without government order during the strict lockdown and/or until their tenants could go back to work."
8406,"My friend, who is a landlord, spent march-august without income from her apt even though that's a big financial strain for her."
8407,"Japan, *terrible* response to covid aside, literally mailed a few months worth of rent to every resident."
8408,most people got special unemployment if they lost their jobs due to covid in Europe.
8409,Etc etc etc.
8410,The u.s. managed to mess up both citizen health *and* citizen's economic well-being bigtime.
8411,"Even if its deficit is not as great as other countries, their citizens are *screwed*."
8412,You never know on reddit when it's /s.
8413,I bet Trump grabbed Christie right on his bussy.
8414,That's probably how he got it.
8415,[deleted]
8416,I'm calling bullshit on this.
8417,Swedish deaths are about 6000 out of 94000 confirmed infections.
8418,"That is 6.4%, compared to the global average of 2.8%."
8419,"Still high, but nowhere near 10%

Sweden had a large spike of deaths in nursing homes early during the pandemic."
8420,Those deaths account for over 80% of reported deaths in Sweden.
8421,"Swedish deaths per 1M are high, at 583, but comparable to USA (646), Spain (686), France (493), UK (623), Italy (595) or Belgium (866)."
8422,Sweden also had a much longer initial wave than countries that locked down hard.
8423,"On the flipside, Sweden does not seem to have the same massive second wave that a lot of countries are currently experiencing."
8424,"Sources:  
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/  
https://platz.se/coronavirus/?"
8425,"The question is, are you willing to sacrifice your own happiness for someone else's sake?"
8426,"For you, the answer is yes."
8427,"For me, the answer is sometimes."
8428,I'm willing to make some sacrifices you're asking for but not others.
8429,"For the guy you're replying to, the answer might be sometimes."
8430,It might be no.
8431,It's not your place to decide what his priorities should be.
8432,I don't think he cares what you're moved by.
8433,He's sharing his own perspective on the situation and you're here talking down to him as if his need for social interaction is somehow petty or ridiculous.
8434,I get where you're coming from but you realize your thinking is flawed.
8435,"""There will be some outbreaks but they'll just go away"" is exactly the thinking that got us here."
8436,Should we eradicate it from the human population completely?
8437,Set up COVID colonies?
8438,It's still endemic in the animal population.
8439,It'll still find its way back into the population over and over.
8440,Do we lock down each time?
8441,What's your realistic answer here?
8442,"Also, do you believe that medicine will not continue to improve?"
8443,Plenty of diseases used to be deadly but are now easily treatable.
8444,"So your argument that he will reach a vulnerable age and die, and that all humans will die once they get older and therefore human life expectancy is forever reduced, is flawed."
8445,"Finally, your faith in human decency is too high."
8446,From the beginning there were people intentionally spreading the virus.
8447,It'll keep happening.
8448,Surely spread out over 25x the surface area would be in favour of the US?
8449,"Look at how packed, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong are."
8450,Warning!
8451,"I'm just a bot and here to let you know that this comment has been linked to in r/ShitPoliticsSays here: /r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/j4vqo6/this_entire_thread_has_me_dying_the_people_who/

8452,As a result the comment I am replying to may be subjected to brigades in the future.
8453,"At the time I am making this reply, the score of the comment that I'm replying to is: 3976"
8454,"Also, the Trump boys have been busy campaigning."
8455,It is about limiting the total number of hours it can spread.
8456,Bars open at noon so that gives 10 hours instead of 14.
8457,That's almost a 30% decrease in spread.
8458,And since viruses spread exponentially that means (70%)^2 which comes to 49%.
8459,So basically cuts it in half.
8460,America would do the same thing and did at the start when cases were low.
8461,Trump trumpeting double digit cases saying USA #1
8462,Dude I would know as I live in Europe and received hours of classes about the eurozone crisis and the causes.
8463,"It has so many factors that you cannot just say ""government overspend live beyond their means national debt bla bla bla"" pretty much every country had their unique scenario."
8464,They were not all like Greece where the government fucked up badly and for example didn't collect taxes rigorously.
8465,Some people think owning a business automatically makes you like Jeff Bezos.
8466,It’s a thing.
8467,4chan has used it in the past.
8468,“Low orbit ion canon”
8469,Mis-educating.
8470,It's intentional.
8471,In front of a slow motion explosion
8472,&gt; Bars closing at 10PM in some cities.
8473,🧐
8474,'Airlifted' makes it sound like a guy stuck on a mountain with broken bones and can only be winched out on a stretcher.
8475,Trump walked onto a chopper.
8476,He could just have easily have walked into a limo.
8477,The chopper is one of his favored modes of transport and easier to control security.
8478,What -&gt; Who
8479,Ahh yes pro sports in a pandemic.
8480,Winning by random chance.
8481,Such sport.
8482,America is quickly learning to live without you vile republicans.
8483,We ALL know it’s Pit Bull
8484,"Some European countries have low death rate per capita such as Greece, Norway, Finland, Latvia, Slovakia, Lichenstein, Iceland, Cyrpus, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Serbia."
8485,They are all under 100.
8486,"Germany, Bulgaria, Denmark are in the 110s."
8487,The US has the 10th worst rate at 646.
8488,"Most of the big European countries like UK, France, Spain, Italy rank pretty high in death rates."
8489,"Who I replied to said SB county is small, it is not geographically or population wise."
8490,When I replied to them I was referring to geographically because I thought it would be implied the largest county in the US would have a significant portion of the population.
8491,"But then when everyone started acting like I was talking about population, which is SB county is very obviously not the largest in the US, I referred to largest what they were, population."
8492,I went back and edited my comments for more clarity but saying SB county wouldn't affect CA percentages is just 100% false.
8493,Also never backpedalled on anything people just kept taking different statistics as what I meant even after I added the full statistics to the original comment.
8494,USA will have theirs out next month.
8495,What is slowing down EU?
8496,Not to mention covid sets the bar high for “things that warrant these powers”.
8497,People won’t be in a rush to let the government lock them down unless it’s a documented event effecting millions.
8498,The flu killed 80k in the US in 2017.
8499,We should be way more anxious about the flu or way less anxious about coronavirus.
8500,Are you trying to tell me that [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Boris_Johnson_official_portrait_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Boris_Johnson_official_portrait_%28cropped%29.jpg) isn't Donald Trump?

8517,"Either way, it is doing a long-term strategy, so it is a bit early to judge."
8518,"Might end up having worked out, might not."
8519,The damage from lockdowns was also unnecessary since we could have just properly done them the first time based off expert recommendations.
8520,The deaths and harms as a result of doing them incorrectly were preventable just like the deaths from the virus.

8530,"These kinds of articles get more views, for one thing, which is obviously beneficial to the author."
8531,"Secondly, it gives people permission to give up now because they can’t fathom doing this forever."
8532,It’s a negative fantasy that is pretty harmful to society and to individuals.
8533,"Fault world leaders all day long, many of them deserve the blame, but the junk like this that keeps getting published is an epic failure on the media’s part."
8534,"Wow, I'm in SC and we have around 700 new cases a day, but a 32% positivity rate..."
8535,"Been to India nearly 20 times, would love to visit Pakistan too."
8536,I sincerely doubt most of the country is nearly as unsafe as Reddit's making it out to sound.
8537,"If a communist country can’t even contain the virus with contact tracing, a democratic, capitalist country doesn’t stand a chance."
8538,"&gt;The idea behind it is past 10pm, you increase the chances of being totally drunk, talk louder and closer to people."
8539,They want to avoid the less civilized part of the night.
8540,"I saw video of people just partying in the street like it's a freaking festivals, after the bars closed."
8541,Looks like it's not really working as intended and the bar environment was in fact safer.
8542,Until there is a vaccine and enough people have been given it to reach so called herd immunity*
8543,The picture isn't the only thing going viral.
8544,Not even that much
8545,There won’t be a lockdown.
8546,Lockdowns are to prevent the overwhelming of the healthcare system first and foremost.
8547,We’re nowhere near that stage and probably won’t hit it.
8548,"There will be restrictions on some businesses and they might have stricter guidelines here and there, but there is nothing warranting a new lockdown."
8549,&gt;It seems like university over there is all partying and sport.
8550,"Sports have developed into a large and publicized part of some of our universities, but assuming you're not American it's much less a defining feature for an average student than you might think."
8551,"Sure, you can go all-in with things like going to every game, tailgate parties, rallies, etc...but you can very, very easily avoid that sort of thing if you want to."
8552,You can party and go to bars like regular just like a lot of other students do at universities around the world.
8553,You can choose not to party and focus on your academics.
8554,It's just another means by which a some students choose to spend their free time.
8555,"Just like...you know, regular drinking and partying."
8556,Lol alt righters like joe rogan moved to texas from California because they didnt want to follow the mask mandate and said masks were for pussies.
8557,Hopefully the places that follow the science will get better faster than ant science areas.
8558,"Not to blame anyone specifically, but I saw a report on the deeply Orthodox believers basically going ape about any kind of restrictions by the government, thus spreading this shit far and wide ..."

8560,"97.5% of cases develop within 11 days, the chances of it being 14+ are practically nonexistent"
8561,India could use some.
8562,I think chaos is more likely.
8563,Suddenly all these conspiracy drama writers who have risen to peseudo-journalistic prominence will come unmoored and try to carve out a new niche for themselves.
8564,They'll find some way to blame it on whoever their political opponents are at the moment.
8565,The lies and obtuseness; It's not hard to do what DT does if you feel at odds with everyone.

8600,Realistically it wouldn’t be surprising if someone else had already brought the virus outside of China via Guangzhou or another city before the outbreak in Wuhan was even noticed.
8601,I was just talking to a friend from the North of the country.

8605,The population is around 18000 and is growing relatively steadily.
8606,All the other rhino species are really threatened though.
8607,There is probably some wildlife fund or something that helps with conservation that you could donate to or raise awareness for.
8608,The article wasn't clear whether a representative sample of the total population was used.

8612,&gt;Those deaths account for over 80% of reported deaths in Sweden.
8613,Source?
8614,"Back in May, BBC said it was 48.9%."
8615,The highest I've seen reported was 70%+.
8616,I've never seen any report that says 80%+.
8617,I cannot believe that people seriously believe that the death rate is 4 percent and that there are only 8 million active cases in general.

8707,"By Sabah Meddings 

For many, 2020 has been a year of heartbreak."
8708,"For the army of small investors in experimental drug-maker Synairgen, it has been nothing short of a miracle."
8709,"Anyone who invested £100 in its shares in January would be £2,700 better off today."
8710,The company owes its rocketing valuation to the coronavirus: it has a potential treatment.
8711,"In July, Synairgen reported positive results from a trial of its drug."
8712,The shares jumped by 420% in one day.
8713,"“It is a thrill to be in this position,” said chief executive Richard Marsden, on a tour of Synairgen’s main trial site at Southampton General Hospital."
8714,"His excitement was tempered: “It’s in the context of awful destruction happening, people dying, people losing their jobs.”

Synairgen is one of a host of healthcare specialists rushing to develop Covid-19 treatments, exploring whether drugs can improve outcomes for patients with severe symptoms."
8715,"Drugs such as Synairgen’s — if they work — will be vital in reducing the death rate, allowing a quicker return to normality than by waiting for a full vaccine."
8716,Synairgen’s trial involved 101 people hospitalised in various parts of the UK.
8717,"Their treatment included Synairgen’s drug, SNG001."
8718,"By aiding the immune response to the virus, Synairgen hoped to speed up recovery."
8719,"In July, it announced that it had reduced the likelihood that patients would need to be put on a ventilator."
8720,The trial was deemed a success.
8721,"The results were a boon for Synairgen and its investors, who snapped up shares."
8722,"Synairgen’s value has soared 2,621% since the start of the year, making its founders and executives paper millionaires."
8723,"The shares closed on Friday at 160p, valuing it at £239m."
8724,"With winter coming and UK cases at about 7,000 a day, doctors need medicines to treat severe cases."
8725,A widely available vaccine is likely to be at least six months away.
8726,"Synairgen’s drug is based on interferon beta, a naturally occurring protein that is the body’s first line of defence against viruses."
8727,In the trial it was delivered by inhaler to recently diagnosed patients.
8728,"They had appeared to develop more severe symptoms after the first few days, before being given SNG001."
8729,"The body rushes to attack the virus, causing lung symptoms to worsen."
8730,"“It seems with this virus that the second week is the risky week,” said Marsden."
8731,The trial showed there was a 79% reduction in the risk of patients developing a severe version of the disease.
8732,"There were no deaths of patients treated with SNG001, compared with three on the placebo."
8733,Marsden hopes the future drug will be taken at home before sufferers become sick enough to need hospital treatment.
8734,"“We’re anticipating a bad winter,” said Marsden, who predicted in August that local lockdowns would expand until large areas of the UK were under more restrictions."
8735,Synairgen’s journey to the front line of the fight against coronavirus has not been smooth.
8736,"Established in 2003 by three professors from Southampton University, it develops drugs for respiratory conditions."
8737,"Until a vaccine comes along, we have to have therapies that help to protect people.”"
8738,"It’s eerie here, too."
8739,"In our small city, I take my dog out and I swear the look he gives me is, like: “WTF: everyone been raptured or what?”

Even dogs know."
8740,"The UK are really showing how strong their scientists and smart people are through this pandemic, vaccines/drugs to limit the impact etc."
8741,If only people followed the mandates of health professionals.

8745,"I even met Brits, Germans and Italians on my way to the train station."

8772,A 50% effective vaccine (if effectiveness is determined the same as it is for the flu vaccines) can actually protect more than 50% of the population if its given to the right groups because not everyone mixes equally with everyone else.
8773,This is why a 40% effective (in a bad year) flu vaccine doesn't result in 60% of the population getting flu.

8817,I mean there are some situations where a rapid test still has value as long as you recognize that it doesn’t guarantee a negative result and mean you don’t need masks.
8818,They never should have been used as a way to avoid basic precautions.

8854,That’s a complete misrepresentation.
8855,Proper mask usage and distancing where applicable alone will do wonders.
8856,"We’re not seeing anywhere near enough mask usage to actually beat back the transmission of the virus, and that is the most simple, basic, and unobtrusive thing that can be done with no impact to daily life."

8862,"Just think about the number of people the president has met since the pandemic started, without anyone meeting him, or at least few, wearing a mask and it probally took a large gathering to become ill."

8926,The region in particular is near the Euphrates which made for great farm land and therefore great for a farming society.
8927,"The area kept getting overtaken by different rulers, often times changing hands, and had it's own share of art to commemorate each real and not real battle victory."
8928,Ironically I remember this from my art history class almost entirely because each new ruler kept expanding the propaganda basically from I talked to god to I'm the son of god to I'm ACTUALLY god and each one kept getting killed.
8929,"&gt;  But I will never taste the sweet, sweet freedom... to slide further into relative poverty, to tack on medical debt, and to die for the cult."
8930,I am tasting that in India.
8931,"It is not just sweet, it is bittersweet."
8932,Please send help.
8933,Are you delusional?
8934,The edited video he put out last night he says that the treatment he receives were miracles given to him by god.
8935,He is going to double down if he survives he will get hundreds of thousands more american killed.
8936,God sent those doctors and scientists.
8937,Checkmate atheists!
8938,That’s not how breathalyzer tests work.
8939,They have chemical sensors that identify particular matching gas particles.
8940,They don’t collect solids.
8941,"Went to Catholic School preschool through high school (age 4-5 until 17-18, for the non Americans); while not religious myself, the philosophy we were taught is that science is learning the mechanisms by which the world functions; as god made the world, this means science is like catching a glimpse of the holy."
8942,"Lord knows it hasn't always been this way, but that was the teaching I got ~20-30 years ago

I guess my point is, depending on your version of god, belief in one doesn't have to negate the other!"
8943,Actual infections were much much higher than the official numbers in march/april
8944,Atlanta right?
8945,You enjoying football season as much as I am?
8946,Lmao
8947,"""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute."
8948,One minute.
8949,"And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"
8950,"""So it'd be interesting to check that."""
8951,"Pointing to his head, Mr Trump went on: ""I'm not a doctor."
8952,"But I'm, like, a person that has a good you-know-what."""
8953,"Yes, he did."
8954,"He also said the following minutes before:

""So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous - whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light,"" the president said, turning to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, ""and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you're going to test it."
8955,"""And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way."
8956,And I think you said you're going to test that too.
8957,"Sounds interesting,"" the president continued."""
8958,This literally happened only a few months ago
8959,Honestly what did it to me was that I was being controlled by a lack of god.
8960,I had to admit I didn't know and truly surrender to the void and when I came back I saw there was a unique method to this madness which I call god.
8961,"Some call it Dao, Brahman, etc."
8962,the word is irrelevant and anyone who gets caught up on it is selling this all way too short.
8963,"We have found the redditor with the purest soul, bless your heart young lad"
8964,Mom ran outta her stash of box-wine...
8965,I remember there were reports a couple of months back about Chinese made covid tests that were inaccurate as well.
8966,"Since the White House is using American testing kits, the accuracy should be much better than the Made in China ones."
8967,But why are our American tests so inaccurate as well?
8968,Easy there Thanos
8969,We’ve seen very little about how false negatives give a false sense of security.
8970,"They should have some pretty good data on how many false negatives these tests returned before finally identifying them as positive cases, given that the Rose Garden ceremony was the likely transmission spot."
8971,Leaders in other countries are making similar mistakes.
8972,These tests were never meant to be used to determine who should be social distancing and wearing masks and flying in airplanes and who should not.
8973,"I don’t know if all of these tests have the same false negative rates, but Harvard has known since May that the chance of getting a false negative the same day as infection is 100%."
8974,And I would argue that *eating* is a very essential part of staying healthy.
8975,"And as long as supermarkets charge money for food, a job is kind of essential."
8976,Its like being so committed to a lie where its too late to just be honest so you double down.
8977,encouraging everybody to get tested is how you get more accurate infection numbers.
8978,it also gets asymptomatic people who can then quarantine and reduce transmission.
8979,62 million people voted for Trump in 2016.
8980,"How do we educate these people, when the public education system has nothing for adults, and they're convinced that education as a concept is propaganda and changing your mind is unholy?"
8981,"I agree with those that said it’s simply an opposition to the left, however I know most conservatives would not agree with this."
8982,Their platform is “freedom” and believe that mask mandates are taking away people’s right to chose what to do with their bodies.
8983,"Why they have not then applied that same ideology to clothing laws/rules about wearing clothing in private establishments, or abortion, is beyond me."
8984,Religion gave birth to the God Kings and monarchies that were in place for most of human history.
8985,Or was it the other way around?
8986,Yeah.
8987,i don't see people doing any of this unless the death rate goes waaaaaaaaay up.
8988,"We did the whole ""stay home"" thing at what March?"
8989,"Now it's October and we are being told ""it's getting worse""."
8990,People are burnt the fuck out!
8991,"Yes, going full lockdown would be the correct thing to do, but I don't think most people have it in them anymore."
8992,When keeping it real *goes wrong*
8993,"Is it really about individualism, or is that an insincere excuse to just do whatever the hell they want?"
8994,"Yeah, I mean."
8995,Funnelling the money IS their main goal.
8996,"No one keeps political promises, it's all about the power you have in office."
8997,"As a Vermonter, I just have to point out that although it may be technically accurate to count Vermont's cases as rising, we really aren't seeing any spikes or anything alarming."
8998,"Our cases have been so consistently low that even a teeny tiny spike (say, 10 new cases in a day as opposed to the usual 0-5) majorly skews the data."
8999,We still have under 2000 total cases since the beginning of the pandemic and no deaths in over a month.
9000,School started on September 8th and there have been very few cases due to stringent safety precautions and an already very low level of community spread.
9001,"It is leaf-peeper season, so my guess is that any small influx in cases is due primarily to irresponsible tourists."
9002,"Seriously, people, stay the hell home!"
9003,This is the hill they’ve *literally* chosen to die on.
9004,They want people to get afraid of going out and voting in person.m so they can keep pushing the mail in voting is fraudulent.
9005,And no one know if that is real?
9006,Only difference is that the US will recover.
9007,Whatever helps your sleep at night.
9008,I will never tithe or give a dime to those institutions of mind control.
9009,Michigan's Republican controlled supreme court just struck down basically precautions required by the Democratic Governor.
9010,Michigan might become a hotspot again.
9011,Orthodox are ultra-conservative.
9012,I think the comment above was talking about conservative Jews that aren't orthodox (unclear if they meant politically or religiously conservative but maybe those are the same these days).
9013,He talking about exclusively using a visor.
9014,Mask + visor is the most effective defence
9015,It’s honestly not that bad
9016,I think you over-estimate the number of people who understand this point (the false negativity of test especially in early days).
9017,"For months now I find myself fuming at celebrities and politicians who say something along the line of ""I am a close contact of X who was diagnosed with covid yesterday, so I am just going to get tested so that I can clear myself""."

9049,"I've been reading this book about the KKK and one interesting thing, which I felt echo in your statement, was the lack of a consistent ideology."
9050,"Since the KKK had regional chapters their views were somewhat fluid based on the specific area and what would resonate best with the locals, basically like you said very reactionary for whatever would give them power in that area."
9051,Did Trump say ingesting Clorox one point would help?
9052,"It depends on how long you spend together, ventilation, temperature, humidity, how loudly you're talking/singing/shouting, if it's face-to-face, if you've been hugging and kissing them, how much rest you've all been getting, vitamin D blood levels, etc."
9053,The disease has always been driven by super-spreading events such as the debate prep meeting.
9054,"Most infected people hardly spread it, but a small number of infected people spread it to a lot of people."

9059,"Private gatherings and indoor dining are a big problem though, maybe you were referring to that."
9060,"Yes, and it replicates in them as well, but T-cells seem not to be its primary attack target like for HIV nor is it comparable to AIDS, as AIDS is a chronic disease because of what I said."

9067,Didn’t help that when the governor tried to get shit in gear with PPE and what not the DHS stole the gear and forced a bidding war over the shortages
9068,How so?
9069,We had one massive peak followed by a sharp decline and cases have continued to decline gradually.
9070,Most of Sweden's deaths happened in Stockholm region in March and April.
9071,"Stockholm region already had recommendations for people to work from home a week earlier than the national one and before the other scandinavian countrie issued lockdown orders, had regional visitation ban for elderly homes two weeks before the national one."
9072,"Yet, infections and deaths continued to climb."
9073,Almost as if the infection was already spread wider than it was possible to contain...
9074,People take calculated risks.
9075,"Everyone has a different risk tolerance, and some have already had it."
9076,"The important thing is that sick people need to stay home, and not gamble with other people’s lives."
9077,"Well it seems silly to say the goal wasn't herd immunity and after a considerable share of the population has had the virus turn around and say ""hey look now it'll spread slower because all these people are immune!"""
9078,My restaurant in mke has had two outbreaks since July
9079,"Thats not exactly correct:

9081,"Copying this from another reply:

What I don't understand is that an initial lockdown like everyone else did when things were out of control would still be a good tactic as part of a long term strategy."
9082,Why keep everything open?
9083,It was only a matter of locking down for a few weeks and you'd probably have thousands of Swedes still living
9084,Hey wait I've seen this one
9085,Is that really a better question when he's repeatedly offered up estimates for when you get herd immunity?
9086,"The rest of Europe locked down and have fared better, and at least Norway is also taking a long term view by locking down when we need to and opening more when we can."

9092,I guess that was just another lie by those left.
9093,"But yea, 1 million is definitely an exaggeration, there have been plenty like that."
9094,France already over a month ago had more daily cases than in peak of epodemy in spring.
9095,"And also deaths in spring had lag of about 2 weeks, not a month

When you're tested positive it means you've been infected for a few days at least already"
9096,"I said basically, I didn't say it's just like AIDS but there's a study that details how it attacks a certain type of t cells"
9097,Pretty much this.
9098,I’ve been paying attention to this virus since before most people were and I’ve been quite strict about distancing.
9099,But people are starting to crack.

9142,Your able to figure out his *moral compass* from that?
9143,Are you psychic?
9144,"For the first three months when the most deaths occurred, testing was performed only on priority groups - severe symptoms and health and care staff."
9145,As such the expected positivity rate is much higher than if you are doing random testing.
9146,Only people that are looking at the numbers without any context or desire to know how these numbers are obtained don't know this.
9147,Are you being tested daily?
9148,Testing negative once doesn’t mean you don’t have it or won’t catch it.
9149,"After the virus that causes COVID-19 enters the body, it has to penetrate our cells and corrupt their operating instructions so it can churn out more copies of itself to infect more cells and make more copies."
9150,It takes a few days for this copying to happen enough to be detected on a test.
9151,"For COVID, it takes about 3 to 5 days after infection for someone to make enough copies to be picked up by a test."
9152,"There appears to be a small window, maybe as short as hours, when a person is shedding the virus and infectious, but doesn’t yet have enough virus in their body to be detected by a less sensitive rapid test."
9153,"If a person is tested while they are in this window, their case would be missed."
9154,That also means that more people who attended the debate may test positive in the coming days.
9155,It’s like we’re on opposite sides of a mirror.
9156,"It’s not clear what kind of tests were used by the candidates, but the White House has reportedly relied on the Abbott ID Now test in the past, which it uses to screen visitors and the president daily."
9157,"Rapid tests like ID Now are convenient, and they can return results in as little as 15 minutes, but they are not as accurate as the gold-standard PCR tests, which require lab processing and return results in 1-2 days."
9158,The FDA warned in May that the test could return false negative results.
9159,Studies have found that the test misses between 1 in 3 and 1 in 7 of positive cases.
9160,The FDA advised that anyone testing negative on the ID Now have their results confirmed with a different testing method.
9161,It’s unclear whether the White House has been doing this confirmatory testing.
9162,"Tests miss COVID cases for a variety of reasons, says Isaac Bogoch, MD, an infectious disease specialist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute."
9163,"Since the recent presidential debate, at least 11 people involved in the event have tested positive for COVID-19, raising questions about how the virus could have run rampant there despite precautions, which included testing for everyone there."
9164,The Cleveland Clinic supervised the event.
9165,"In a statement issued Friday, it said it had requirements to keep a safe environment that aligned with CDC guidelines -- including social distancing, hand sanitizing, temperature checks, and masking."
9166,"“Most importantly, everyone permitted inside the debate all tested negative for COVID-19 prior to entry."
9167,"Individuals traveling with both candidates, including the candidates themselves, had been tested and tested negative by their respective campaigns.”"
9168,It was proven it attacks t cells and it basically airborne AIDS so that option is out the window
9169,"OK, but is that a triumph or a failure of American healthcare?"
9170,Like has the overall infection rate fallen?
9171,Or is the percentage of Americans who can afford testing and hospitalisation fewer?
9172,Well I guess your dad is right then.
9173,I should be more like him as they just announced that the rise in infections is due to prisoners being tested and the situation is still under the control and we can evade another lockdown.
9174,Which makes sense.
9175,I couldn't believe that cases are rising like before because Malaysians have been following rules everywhere.

9184,It is possible to improve.
9185,I can do this for you and me and if all of us do this together for a while more we will get to herd immunity eventually either with antibodies from illness or from vaccines.
9186,At the moment we have no idea how long-term immunity looks like either with antibodies from illness or from one vaccine or from a combination of vaccines.
9187,I know that there are people who think of themselves in the first place and seems to be incapable of thinking of other.
9188,We can minimise that group by example and by teaching and training and show of leadership.
9189,"As if right now this group is bigger than normal because of division, hatred and showed incapability to care and love and a blatantly shown lack of leadership."
9190,And a lack of consistant messaging.
9191,"😭

If we do help each other out for a while more we can get back to a normal, a new normal."
9192,"A slightly different normal but non the less a normal with open restaurants, concerts and more."
9193,That new is wear mask in crowded situations during flu season and stay home when sick.
9194,It means good protection of work and paid sick leaves.
9195,I am curious if this flu season will be less noticeable for all the coronavirus and covid-19-illness or equal to a normal flu-season.
9196,The tail end of flu season this winter-spring seemed to be lessened and lower than normal because of handwashing and staying at home when sick this flu-season.
9197,I am curious.
9198,Belgium had 3k cases in one day with a much lower population.

9205,That was.... really depressing.

9207,Jesus.
9208,DO?
9209,Its true that they didnt put the whole country in police enforced lockdown but they did achive a volontarely soft lockdown to some extent.
9210,They used carrots instead of sticks.
9211,For example during april there was the highest number of people ever (twice as high as 2019) staying home getting paid to take care of their sick children.
9212,"This is not because children were sicker, its because the guidelines says that you should stay at home of you have the slightest symtoms."
9213,Similarly the government made it so that you get paid more If you stay at home when youre sick than before.
9214,Riskgroups gets paid If they stay at home etc.

9218,This mainly reflects the fact that we're testing a lot and way more than before.
9219,"The real interesting numbers are here: https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/carte-et-donnees ""Nouveaux patients hospitalisés"" = New patients admitted in hospital and ""nouveaux patients en réanimation"" = new patients in ICU."
9220,"Ok, so what happened?"
9221,We're having a second wave.
9222,"Except it's weaker than the first one (for now) and it mainly hit youngsters (because summer, and then going back to school)."

9735,Welcome to what we’ve been dealing with since March
9736,"Well, asymptomatic spread accounts for 40% of positive cases."
9737,I have two cousins.
9738,"One tested positive for antibodies, which likely means that he had it and never realized he did."
9739,"My other cousin, who is a scholarship athlete and just 18-years old, thought she was going to die from it, was the sickest she's ever been, and still feeling weak and still has heart damage."
9740,"They are at two different universities on opposite ends of the country, but the point is they are young and one is considered one of our nation's top athletes for her sport and age and despite her having no health issues prior, is still in recovery."
9741,"There is no telling how one's body will react to the virus until it does, and people are taking a HUGE gamble going out and having parties."
9742,"They are gambling their life, the lives of others."
9743,"In this sense, they are behaving like drunk drivers."
9744,"I grew up in Boston, a city of over 5 million."
9745,But as with 90% of Bostonians my suburb was a 20 minute drive from the city centre and every house sat on 1/4 to 1/2 an acre with large areas of undeveloped woods between streets.
9746,And that was still considered an inner suburb.
9747,"When my parents visit, when I've had friends from the US visit, they all comment on how dense Auckland is, how the houses are subdivided and built so close together with such small or non-existent yards and that the city doesn't slowly get more spread out, it's uniformly dense and then just stops and becomes farmland instantly at the urban limit."
9748,"Look on Google Maps and you'll see how US cities get very gradually less and less dense, spreading out and out."
9749,"As for things being dead outside the CBD, that's how it is in the US too."
9750,Of course if you live in the city itself it's very different.
9751,"But more than 90% of urban area populations live in the suburbs, not the CBD."

9764,We're only talking about a 2:1 difference between NY's low and NZ's high.
9765,"Australia's peak was 567/day over a week, overwhelmingly in the state of Victoria."
9766,"If we attribute only 75% of that to Victoria, we get 44.5/100k/week as their peak - or to put it another way, in August, Victoria's Covid rate was roughly twice NY's."
9767,"The difference is that Victoria locked down, hard, and closed its borders."
9768,"Elimination is theoretically possible, but in ways that Americans and Europeans largely would not accept."
9769,Australians have only accepted it because they are so remote and relatively self-contained.

9882,"They are not your local doctors, or emergency room doctors, or surgeons."
9883,They are musculoskeletal specialists who have no expertise in virology or epidemiology.
9884,A D.O.
9885,is wholly unqualified to be delivering this press conference on SARS-CoV-2.
9886,DOs absolutely are your local doctors or emergency room doctors or surgeons.
9887,"For all intents and purposes, DOs are the same as MDs."
9888,I'm in my fourth year of med school and have worked with countless DOs in every specialty.
9889,Their responsibilities and expertise are the same as their MD colleagues.
9890,How have u been feeling since taking all the supplements?

9892,"&gt; White House advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said that Americans should brace for fall and winter, when the coronavirus is expected to surge due to cold weather and increased time indoors."
9893,"&gt; “We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it’s not going to be easy,” Fauci told Harvard Medical School on Sept. 10."
9894,"&gt; That means Covid stress, never-ending days, Zoom happy hours and grocery delivery could once again become America’s reality."
9895,"Combine that with the fact that people tend to start getting pessimistic in the winter, and for many the thought of being stuck at home for an extended period of time is bleak."
9896,&gt; But there are things that can make a difference.
9897,What would *you* do if you were locked down again?
9898,I think it’s obvious Trump is undergoing an aggressive antiviral treatment so his numbers are below the testing threshold.
9899,He hopes that he gets there Monday or Tuesday because then he can claim that he found the cure.
9900,"Even if he recovers in spite of the treatments and not because of them, people are stupid enough to think it is proof."
9901,I don’t think he’s lying about having it or anything.
9902,I think he probably didn’t expect to get it but when he did he saw a way to use it for his benefit.
9903,He’s known Regeneron’s CEO for years.
9904,I’m sure they’re planning a press conference right now.
9905,Everyone wondering whether Trump will survive the weekend and then he’s covid free on Monday is what they’re hoping for.
9906,"People that defend Sweden's corona strategy say that it's only a  ""harvesting effect"" and that ""car accidents kill more people anyway""."
9907,"If we trust them, does it really matter?"
9908,Viruses are never eradicated.
9909,"If they’re sick, yes, that would be nice."
9910,But not every healthy person.
9911,Humanity has survived lots of things.
9912,The bubonic plague killed 2/3rds of Europe.
9913,Do you think saying humanity has survived pandemics absolves you of any personal responsibility to help yourself and the people around you survive this one?
9914,"I understand wearing a mask when you’re sick, but it’s ridiculous to ask healthy people to wear a mask every day during flu season."

9917,*
9918,Sorry
9919,please speak English
9920,I was in the US in July and that was a republican talking point.
9921,However it was wrong then because deaths were also rising and high.
9922,So when Trump said « we do more testing than ANYWHERE » he should also have said « We get more deaths than ANYWHERE ».
9923,I don’t know how that has changed now.
9924,"First trump get the White House flu, now we’re losing to France?"
9925,That’s not the American way.
9926,We’ve got to get those number back up there.
9927,"damn, you almost had me therer"
9928,"As someone who works in the tourism sector the uptake in vacations started in July with Ryanair acting as normal (no restrictions, most routes still operated) and increased steadily since."
9929,"While Europeans were not allowed travel to America (unless for essential travel/get home to family), restrictions never applied to Americans vacationing in Europe."
9930,This meant during the summer the only people I was dealing with were Americans upset that most tourist attractions are closed.
9931,Right.
9932,They think other countries have way more cases and death and media is just lying to make US look bad.
9933,Ironically the same ppl also say that the disease is not that bad and social distancing is unnecessary.
9934,Humanity has survived pandemics before and it will again.
9935,This shit won't be around in its current form forever.
9936,"So ""no new normal"" even though it's a fact experienced every single waking moment and day?"
9937,Do they go outside and disregard everything?
9938,"Sure you can do that but even then there's restaurants closed travel is restricted people work from home and so on

Either these people don't travel and don't work from offices, or are just denying reality..."
9939,"Fair enough good for you,as i say i struggle with it too.Lets stay gently sane."
9940,"&gt;In my country, everything has been open since summer (including night clubs, bars, cinemas), having indoor and outdoor events with several thousand people is OK and no one wears a mask

Which country is that?"
9941,"&gt;lower emotional intelligence

That’s a new one."
9942,I like it.
9943,Better than saying “lack of empathy.”
9944,The world is huge.
9945,It's dumb to think people on the other side of the earth can't do what you guys can never do.
9946,1.
9947,"Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator, probably by about a week to ten days."
9948,So the number of hospitalizations today reflects the infection numbers from the end of the week before last.
9949,2.
9950,"They can lag even further if primarily young populations get infected, and then spread it to older relatives (maybe transmitting one or two times in between)."
9951,So numbers of hospitalizations are not a linear function of the number of infections.
9952,3.
9953,Long-term and severe consequences from seemingly mild infections do exist and I've honestly no idea how common they are.
9954,"Probably not common, but also not so rare that we can discount them."
9955,"They need to be accounted for but, as far as I can tell, the research just isn't there to estimate how many are likely to be affected, let alone why."
9956,"That said, if we've reached a stage where treatment, increased testing, and better protocols for protecting the most vulnerable mean that we can live with higher numbers of infections, there's no reason why we can't acknowledge that."
9957,"The problem is that, if we acknowledge that by opening up without effective mitigation, we reintroduce exponential growth and return to a level we can't live with."
9958,"Large numbers of mild infections in the community aren't a major problem; the overwhelming of the health system, the large numbers of deaths, and the long-term consequences, all of which are heavily correlated with infection numbers, are massive strategic concerns."
9959,"Yes, that's clearer, though you have to wonder how representative a few minutes like that really is."
9960,The first non randomized tests in Bergamo province in June had a 53% positivity rate for population and 30% for Healthcare staff.
9961,That was definitely not a good measure.
9962,"Then there were properly state-level screenings in july and Bergamo was at 24%, with estimation of 2.5% at national level (1.5 million infected instead of the official 250k)."
9963,"This one is referred to the most highly affected area in italy, inside the Bergamo province."
9964,I guess they consider it useful because they screened more than 30% of the population.
9965,"I guess the truth lays between the 24% and 43%, but the second one refers to a specific area so I believe for bergamo 24% is correct bur for that limited area it should be more than 24%."
9966,Even if 24% is still a big number IMHO.
9967,At least you're honest.
9968,Not everyone who is exposed will get infected.
9969,There is something going on with crossreactive antibodies (although it is being way overstated by some and can’t be relied upon).
9970,But in a family of 6 statistically there are so many accounts of at least one not getting it in any measurable level.
9971,This is what happened to my friend.
9972,He gave it to 8/15 people outside his household in 3 hours in one event in March (was designated a super spreader)  yet in his home his whole family got it except for one kid.
9973,They all got multiple antibody tests because they (mainly he) was part of a study in New York.
9974,[removed]
9975,A lot of us high riskers have been and are doing just fine.
9976,I had a pretty vibrant social life pre-covid but am choosing to make the best of my quarantine because there’s nothing else I can really do about it.
9977,It’s either stay inside and sulk or stay inside and do as much good as I can!
9978,[removed]
9979,[removed]
9980,"I don't think people rich enough to afford illegal trophy hunters killed Rhinos are stupid enough to use these as medicine, they all have access to best medical services."
9981,if there was proof of the contrary I would post it
9982,"The first part sounds right, mortality rates seem much lower than early estimates."
9983,"But still nowadays people are spending a good month to recover from the virus, starting from the onset of symptoms."
9984,"They are trying the save the winter holiday season of Lapland, but I don't know how they are going to accomplish that."
9985,We have had one of the tightest policies regarding travel in Europe.
9986,"Quarantine is needed if travelling from countries with 2-week incidence above 25 infections/100k people, which is basically whole Europe at the moment (Finland went over the 25 limit today also, so I don't know if this is going to change)."
9987,"Quarantine is 2 weeks at home, but nowadays you can shorten it by having 1 negative test at the departing country and 1 negative test in Finland 3 days after arriving."
9988,"Quarantines were helpful during the summer when the infections were low, but now most of the cases originate from Finland itself."
9989,I think that the weather has somehow affected the contagiousness.
9990,"In the summer we had infected people visiting bars, night clubs with no one else infected."
9991,Now we are suddenly seeing many events where dozens of people have been infected at the same time.
9992,Totally unknown.
9993,"However, there's reason to expect the possibility that almost anyone can get infected again after 3 months."
9994,There's no data with any precision to say one way or another about numbers.
9995,"But, what we know about the reinfection mechanism, we can say it's possible that this can happen to almost anyone."
9996,"We might prove, someday, that it's rare."
9997,But we have not proven that yet.
9998,"I would say, just plan around the idea that if you are infected once, after two months and especially three you'd be vulnerable again."
9999,As for severity.
10000,"The data is that usually it's about the same, sometimes it's worse, probably once or twice it was less bad."
10001,But we think that viral dose at the beginning affects severity.
10002,"Vitamin D deficiency, etc."
10003,"So, some unknown factor probably affects severity more than whether it's a first or second infection."
10004,What you should plan around is the concept that a worse second infection is possible.
10005,Don't just plan that it won't be as bad.
10006,"If second infection is worse, it would be because of ADE."
10007,"However, it seems that what's going on with COVID is that it is defeated by cells and molecules from the Thymus gland."
10008,That patients who have yet to defeat COVID by the time antibodies kick in - these are the severe cases.
10009,So it's almost a matter of a first infection ADE.
10010,"That is, ADE might be an applicable phenomenon for this virus."
10011,"But, in general the virus is defeated by T-cells, not antibodies."
10012,Anyone who has to rely on antibodies to defeat the virus will see bad effects from the first infection.
10013,"In this sense, for the average person, the difference between first and second infections should matter."
10014,"All that matters, whether first or subsequent infection, are things like innat healthy or viral dose."
10015,"As for planning, don't plan that one infection means you're completely, permanently immune."
10016,God forbid anyone dies
10017,"If your research does not contradict something, you are not doing research."
10018,Mass cell division is a process best not messed with.
10019,Jealous of what?
10020,Nah its something about having a dinner party during a pandemic against the rules designed to protect people that give me the hint
10021,"it's not about rules it's about mindset

vietnam didn't have strict rules IIUC, they just got the idea of distance and adapted their behavior accordingly

other countries are spinning around endlessly"
10022,"In terms of vitamin D, the winter sun is at such a low angle that the atmosphere weakens the UV light to the point where it is extremely difficult to synthesize enough vitamin D, even if you sunbathe naked in the cold."
10023,"[A UV index chart shows that at the latitude France is at, it takes almost ten times as many minutes of sun exposure in January, compared to June](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_index#/media/File:UV_Index_NYC.png)

In summer, for a light skin person [fifteen minutes of sun and the face and hands *per week*](https://www.who.int/uv/resources/FAQ/uvhealtfac/en/index1.html#:~:text=But%205%20to%2015%20minutes,vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20is%20unlikely.)"
10024,is enough to prevent outright deficiency.
10025,Almost everyone gets that much sun just getting to and from their car.
10026,"The level that prevents cytokine storms is probably much higher than ""not deficient"", the point is that it doesn't take a huge amount of exposure, in summer."
10027,I don't trust those 3 states either.
10028,Remember how long it took West Virginia to originally report a case.
10029,"I'm willing to bet that at this point there are at least a half dozen symptomatic individuals from that event just trying to cover it up, like Conway tried to before her daughter outed her."
10030,People like you really are rooting for immunity not to exist with this virus.
10031,It’s disgusting.
10032,I’m in Dorchester.
10033,It’s getting real fun out here again!
10034,Pennsylvania overall is at 8.1 cases per 100 thousand with an R0 of 1.09.
10035,There is no skyrocketing.
10036,"Hogan's handling of covid has been a lot of smoke and mirrors, ever since the big press conference about buying a bunch of partial tests."
10037,"The biggest counties in MD have been playing defense for months now, as he tries to force everyone back to school."
10038,He has been a massive disappointment.
10039,I guess it’s time to get ahead of the TP horde??
10040,?
10041,Why is that word still being used?
10042,Anybody still saying that shit needs to drink bleach!
10043,"There is a big difference between:

1."
10044,"One or a few people know something; 
2."
10045,"Everyone who needs to know it, knows;

Just because something was published in a journal, months ago, is not reason to believe that everyone knows."
10046,"After the science is done, and the knowledge is known to a few people, the  communication and education begins, to teach everyone else."
10047,Just because something is illegal it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a market for it.
10048,China and Vietnam are the 2 main drivers of the Rhino horn market.
10049,"Some trophy hunters want them, of course."
10050,But the vast majority goes into traditional medicine.
10051,around yes
10052,I think/hope that group of people is so small it wouldn't have a large effect on the result.
10053,[removed]
10054,I suggest you go to a mirror and look at your stupid and jealous face.
10055,There are all kinds of people everywhere.
10056,The US just happens to have an incompetent government.
10057,How do you expect people to comply with pandemic measures when the gov can't even communicate a coherent message?
10058,"&gt; He was given synthetic antibodies 

When you definitely understand how antibodies work"
10059,I'm not surprised unfortunately.
10060,certainly a lot of the southern tier leans conservative so they look to trump for their guidance.
10061,and given it's mostly rural it gives people a false sense of something like the pandemic being a problem that happens elsewhere.
10062,and certainly the US as a whole had that attitude as the pandemic made it's way through Europe initially
10063,"T-cells only attack cells that are already infected, right?"
10064,Is it right to infer that they may limit the illness but not prevent it?
10065,I hate it here
10066,Exactly.
10067,I've been wondering why didn't the Secret Service set up the protocols during this pandemic.
10068,In the end is also a matter of state security.
10069,You don't have the president opening personally his own correspondence partially for the same reason.
10070,"Yes, that's the longer version of what I said."
10071,It can increase the rate of transmission.
10072,"The science itself (how it's transmitted) doesn't change, only the frequency."
10073,Don’t surround yourself with diseased morons and the outdoors should be safe.
10074,"If Trumps mind is changed, that will be the true “miracle.”"
10075,"Guess deaths will continue in U.S. cause they don't care and want their ""freedom""!"
10076,All the intelligent people will just wear their masks and take precautions.
10077,The people who find masks “too uncomfortable” aren’t going to be shoving a stick up their nose voluntarily.
10078,Yes I know.
10079,That’s why I said the Swedes should read this article.
10080,"They're there, just not confirmed with genetic samples."
10081,How many mild infections?
10082,How would you know if you had it twice?
10083,Plus social distancing.
10084,So so many have yet to contract COVID the first time.
10085,Even Trump took months and months of carelessness and arrogance until it got him.
10086,"So, how many people are the same and in spite of it all haven't caught it the first time?"
10087,"How many people caught it once, and are now at least semi distancing so they're less likely at the moment to catch it again?"
10088,"But, if you want to be reassured that possible thousands of reinfections have occurred, there's evidence to say that thousands is possible, if not confirmed."
10089,Anecdotes in the thousands checks out with the global reporting on this.
10090,It will be really interesting to see how the internet impacts this part.
10091,There is a never ending supply to text like this to show that people did know and understand what was going on.
10092,"Honestly though, mentally I think we’re all way more prepared than what we were the first time."
10093,"It’s not to say it will be easy, but it is something we’ve done before, so I think that will make the experience less stressful"
10094,"The pictures and videos were taken Saturday, before he was hospitalized."
10095,The Trump administration just lied and said they were taken more recently.
10096,He’s at the hospital with COVID symptoms.
10097,"Man, you are so easily fooled, huh?"
10098,https://mobile.twitter.com/jonostrower/status/1312616578773446656
10099,The 1918 Flu pandemic sickened 500 million and killed 50 million world wide when the population was 1.5 billion.
10100,World population today is over 7.5 billion.
10101,"Sadly, I believe nature is far from finished with us."
10102,I did the math yesterday as an experiment.
10103,I wanted to know how the  US would be doing with adequate leadership.
10104,"Of 48 countries in Europe, Germany happened to have the median number of deaths per capita."
10105,"If the US had the same amount of deaths per capita as Germany, we would have under 40,000 deaths currently."
10106,That’s what having actual leadership does.
10107,People are too dumb to contact trace.
10108,"""Hey Joey who were you hanging out with?"
10109,I was with Pakistani Danny.
10110,Do you have a last name for this Danny?
10111,No.
10112,Is he of Pakistani descent.
10113,No he just likes to burn dhurries.
10114,"wat."""
10115,This is why Toronto said they will focus their efforts on isolating infected people instead.
10116,Or the several hundred strip club patrons who gave bullshit information to the contact tracers (I.P.
10117,"Freely, Eileen Dover, etc...)"
10118,Ditto.
10119,"Matter of fact, I'm making it standard for me to wear a mask when I might be sick at all."
10120,"It's time to normalize it (if possible here, but hey, trying?"
10121,).
10122,my mistake
10123,"I don't want Trump to die, mostly because I want him to live to be investigated and hopefully imprisoned after his presidency."
10124,"I do think that from the standpoint of fighting Covid though the worse off his condition is the better the rest of the country and even the world will be because he is the king of Covid misinformation, anti-masking, anti-social-distancing, and fake cures like hydroxychloroquine and bleach injections."
10125,"If he were to be put on a ventilator before making a recovery and it wasn't able to be covered up, that would end up saving tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of lives in the long run."
10126,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Louisiana, with running 7-day averages:

10131,Can confirm.
10132,In backwoods area.
10133,Much more anxiety.
10134,T.T
10135,Thank you for your detailed answer.
10136,What is the policy regarding tourism?
10137,Are you allowing people from other EU country inside?
10138,Do they have to quarantine?
10139,"If lockdown is the solution, why has virtually every lockdown, the moment society 'reopens', always lead to a massive spike of infections?"
10140,Which countries are handling COVID best and which ones did not implement lockdowns?
10141,Curious to see your perspective.
10142,"Italy locked down too late, like much of Europe."
10143,Sweden fucked up compared to other Scandinavian countries.
10144,"Meanwhile NZ, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore + many other Asian countries locked down and are having a great time."
10145,How strange.
10146,"Honestly, a lot of his advice seems to have been ""adjusted"" for the American crowd."
10147,"Had this been a country that was more proactive his advice would have probably been similar to that of Melbourne in Australia, but now it seems he's just taking what he can get."

10152,"I wish I were kidding, but literally they scream at us at the front desk of my hotel."
10153,"I do my best to enforce the mask policies, but it wears you down, man."
10154,Yet.
10155,He could still be incubating or have gotten infected from a secondary contact afterwards.
10156,Quarter Rose Garden orgy.
10157,Because the goalposts have been shifted exponentially in the last few months?
10158,"First, lockdowns were to stop the virus overwhelming out healthcare systems."
10159,"Next, lockdown was enacted to reduce infections (only for them to rise again the moment you reopen)

Judging by the rapid lockdown 2.0's that occur worldwide, the goal was then shifted to eradication."
10160,"Now, we cannot even rely on a vaccine or vaccines to return to a normal life."
10161,"The longer this goes on and if the goalposts keep moving, the 'anti-lockdown' protesters are going to be seen as more legitimate."

10166,Rule of law.
10167,Knock the totalitarians back down and vote them out now that you see what they are.
10168,"Yes, Finland."
10169,There were a lot of restrictions in the Spring but they were lifted.
10170,There are still some restrictions and many recommendations.
10171,"If organizing events with over 50 people, you have to ensure that safe distances can be maintained (which doesn't mean that people will obey them, e.g."
10172,in concerts or in sport matches).
10173,"Cinemas and sport stadiums are operating with reduced capacity, and in restaurants and bars there can be only as much people as there are seats (but you don't have to be seated, dancing is OK)."
10174,People have been again recommended to work from home if possible.
10175,There is recommendation to wear mask in public transport and in public indoor places if safe distances can't be maintained.
10176,"Now they are probably going to shorten the opening times of restaurants and bars to 12 pm, and maybe even to 10 pm in some regions with the capacity also reduced to 50%."
10177,"Cases are the highest in Helsinki region, where only about 20% cases can be traced to a known infection."
10178,There is about 50 possible superspreading events every week in this region alone (exposure of 10 or more individuals to covid-19).
10179,"A rapid test with some false negatives is still better in some applications than more accurate, but slow RT-PCR."
10180,"The problem here is that people interpreted negative test result as ""not infectious""."
10181,"Even with RT-PCR someone who tested negative can be infectious, e.g., because the swab did not pick up enough copies of the virus or because the virus multiplied since the time test sample was taken."
10182,Uh the article is about Australia not NZ.
10183,"No, but you may need to take the same vaccine every year, which is practically the same thing."
10184,"Hey, Montana, you're catching up to your neighbors!"
10185,Way to be competitive!
10186,"Seriously though, I hope MT's leadership does better than SD's."
10187,:(
10188,"Yes, Italy did fantastic, and Sweden was terrible."
10189,Oh wait
10190,My bad.
10191,"The ""over 80%"" figure is the 70+ age bracket."
10192,"Roughly half of those deaths were in retirement homes, which we failed to protect properly."
10193,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Michigan:

[https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Michigan#data](https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Michigan#data)

The state has suffered and is now at 71.04 deaths per 100k population."
10194,"[https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html](https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html)

But now the case and death curves are much lower."
10195,Will be interesting to watch how this changes.
10196,"Do you think that Americans have more of an individualist mindset vs countries like Vietnam who, I would say, more communal, that has allowed for better responses to the pandemic?"
10197,"&gt; I never said that sub is completely overrun


Previously : 
&gt;r/france is filled to the brim


Ahahahah, good one."
10198,I love it!
10199,"You also made the exact same comment days ago...


You speak french so you can't hate on them or lie ?"
10200,"Same logic as ""i'm not racist because i have a black friend""


My argument is you are a liar and everyone can go on r/france to see for themselves what you are talking and lying about."
10201,"Where are all those ""crap ton"" of anti-maskers in comments or posts ?"
10202,"Not one, not two but a ""crap ton"" of anti-mask comments and posts ?"
10203,"Can you show me a ""crap ton"" of them ?"
10204,I see none of them because you just lie.
10205,"I'm pretty sure i can find one or two myself but a ""crap ton "", "" fill to the brim"" or ""moreso than American subreddit"", give me a break !"

Wallace didn't give Trump a test because he was late"
10210,Troll
10211,"&gt; Wear a mask

This is something everyone keeps forgetting!!"
10212,"It's always been important, but now it's more important than ever, given the recent events."
10213,"Ideally we should wear masks *for the next few years*, even once the vaccine comes out."
10214,"Ah yes, the US which has a fantastic control of the pandemic, and the WHO which has done a great job."
10215,On the other hand countries that have done lockdown have seen stunning success.
10216,I wonder why.
10217,The Swedes euthanized covid patients in nursing homes to keep the hospitals free.
10218,Sweden is not a success story.
10219,It is an ugly dystopian nightmare.
10220,it's easy to say for a small island with just 4mil people total
10221,Russia and China have been exploiting the weak leadership of Trump for 4 years now.
10222,The fact that he's bedridden doesn't change much when he was already a puppet.
10223,"I called bullshit on the commenter's numbers, which were way off."
10224,"I don't know what their game was, but it sure seemed as if they were trying to portray Sweden as some kind of exceptional outlier."
10225,"Our numbers are indeed high, too high, but they are comparable to many other European countries, and not anywhere close to the numbers the commenter's misinformation."
10226,This is wrong beyond belief.
10227,"My doctor is a DO but he works in a family practice, does nothing with massages, and is not really different than any of the MDs."
10228,It's a different path is all.
10229,It might be that massage therapists are typically DOs but not all DOs are quacks.
10230,This is what happens when an insane death cult run by Q and facebook militia groups gets into your government.
10231,Sunnyside here - I feel like our area is actually pretty compliant with masks.
10232,How is it next door?
10233,My kid’s school is in Woodside and I’d like him to go back again someday :(.
10234,Where do you get the numbers for infection rate?
10235,The ones I see have Florida at a significantly higher infection rate per population than California.
10236,"2022 can't get here fast enough, fuck this dude"
10237,"It isn't going away, people will keep catching it."
10238,Our only how is it becomes less severe the more times you catch it.
10239,Who cares about that really?
10240,Prison should be for people who haven’t done anything quite bad enough to deserve to die.
10241,"Death means that someone doesn’t have the chance to sway a judge, away a jury, appeal, get probation and fines, etc."
10242,The odds of Trump ever seeing prison are low.
10243,That’s a pipe dream.
10244,I thought we were like 10th in deaths per million people
10245,I am lucky to live in a place with a very large asian population.
10246,"Polite people, near total mask compliance."
10247,"If I lived in some backwoods s-hole where the pickup truck is the primary mode of transport, I could have experienced much larger amounts of pandemic related anxiety."
10248,"But I will never taste the sweet, sweet freedom... to slide further into relative poverty, to tack on medical debt, and to die for the cult."
10249,"You must be loaded with money, 

people are getting unemployed with no other source of income.... businesses are going bankrupt."
10250,"We must take safety, precautions and fight this with our daily routine ."
10251,"Mask On, sanitizer and social distance."
10252,Yeah.
10253,I just see this everywhere and it kind of irks me.
10254,It’s not really the same as socialized healthcare.
10255,It’s still employer provided.
10256,Rona Virus?
10257,She's a Stan Lee character.
10258,I'm starting to get terrified the start of fall is allowing it to transmit more easily.
10259,No new spikes here in Texas even with a lot of rolling back of restrictions.
10260,We are still in the 90s though.
10261,"When it rains, it pours."
10262,He was taking the piss.
10263,"Or it coincided with HK opening up first, why do you try to blame everything on China when HK fucked up?"
10264,Anyone else follow this on the early days in the other subreddit?
10265,Every day BNO News was out with China’s daily numbers which I would anxiously await.
10266,This was like January/February.
10267,"This is like the Passover, but instead of marking your doors you slap a mask on"
10268,literally nothing i said was based on feeling and you’re gonna call me simplistic lol.
10269,don’t you have another murderous dictator to support?
10270,I heard Xi needs his boots polished.
10271,Yeah he’s got people in concentration camps but i just really think it would be low of people to wish him ill.
10272,It looks like it is flipping back to the East coast now in areas that initially had big outbreaks.
10273,Unfortunately that likely means that it could keep flip-flopping for the foreseeable future until there is a vaccine (that people are willing to use) or people get there shit together and finally social distance and use masks.
10274,"""I don't need to, I already got it once and I can't get it again!"""
10275,"You'll need a little over 200,000 downvotes for us to start agreeing with you."
10276,"Possibly true, in which case we'll have a vaccine."
10277,Which only re-enforces the idea that getting Covid a second time isn't something to worry about.
10278,Or at least there are thousands (if not millions) of other things that are significantly more likely to harm you.
10279,Including literally just getting out of bed.
10280,Couple with how slow it will be for any new restrictions and guidelines to take effect.
10281,Everything you’re seeing in terms of case numbers are snapshots from 1-3 weeks ago so going into to lock down now will still take a few weeks to show any improvement.
10282,This is what I’ve been worried about.
10283,America has proven for the last 7 months that our Achilles heel is a virus.
10284,"Posted this elsewhere, but ""C'est la vie"" is my mantra these days."
10285,Until the vaccine is not found many vulnerable people....and even after it found there'll be still minor number cases of covid.
10286,It will not disappear from earth.
10287,If you are hoping for the death of any person Based on that sloppy criteria - it’s not ok.
10288,"Tbf from what I’ve seen, it’s mainly Americans judging America for their corona numbers."
10289,I understand how difficult it is to control coming from Europe
10290,"Norway is doing much better, no?"
10291,"Definitely more careful and on top of that,  cold weather is the best weather for isolating at home!"
10292,Now that it's warming up it's going to be much harder to keep people out of public spaces and apart.
10293,I think we were lucky to have the winter first.
10294,You aren't exaggerating your quarantine.
10295,"By quarantining, you are removing yourself from a chain of infection that has already killed 200,000 Americans."
10296,"Sure, if you are 18-22 year old, your chance of dying from covid is probably less than dying from a lot of other things."
10297,But I'm sure you have older family members etc that you care about and will not want to pass it on to them.

10336,[Some researchers](https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/19/faster-response-prevented-most-us-covid-19-deaths/) have estimated that ~80% of deaths could’ve been avoided.
10337,"And considering that [Trump is the leader](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/evanega-et-al-coronavirus-misinformation-submitted-07-23-20-1/080839ac0c22bca8/full.pdf) of spreading disinformation, most of those deaths fall on him."
10338,In what world is it __not okay__ to hope for the death of someone responsible for mass deaths?
10339,Did you say people should’ve “taken the high ground” when they were calling for the death of Bin Laden?
10340,I doubt it!
10341,And he killed a fraction of that.

10466,"Here in Ontario, we’re 15% below baseline in visiting restaurants and retail, barely a week or 2 into our second wave."
10467,It seems like there’s a serious difference in attitude regarding COVID between Canada and France.
10468,Canada as a whole was 10% below baseline in that category.
10469,"For more comparison, France as a whole was at regular old baseline in this category, and Greece was at 12% above baseline."

10490,And you're terrible at math.
10491,"Since Covid began spreading widely in the US, it has killed more Americans than anything but cardiovascular issues and cancer, and that's WITH all the precautions we've taken to slow the spread."
10492,"According to the projections the White House was looking at when they decided to embrace ""herd immunity"" and stop encouraging masks, we are about to blow past all cancers combined too."
10493,"This so-called ""governor"" is the real flat earther."
10494,I honestly don't know how this doofus became a governor in the first place because it is becoming more and more obvious he did not finish high school.
10495,My concern is about vaccine efficacy.
10496,"It seems like we're being prepared for it to be 50-60%, which is not insignificant yet is hardly ideal."

10499,Same.
10500,"In Egypt they made testing cost $100, in a country where the average income is $35 a day, and what do you know?"
10501,Positive cases stopped happening.
10502,Can you give me a link to where he said this?
10503,The lasting effects of people living after COVID-19 can be pretty grim as well
10504,You’ll be fine in two weeks lol
10505,I wonder how many more of them are positive and are being hush hush about it because of the embarrassment of their stupidity.
10506,Who knows.
10507,If only we could trust these people!
10508,!
10509,His breathing in the beginning looks funny to me as well.
10510,Kinda like he is sucking in air forcefully.
10511,I keep saying this.
10512,People ask “are you for or against mandates?” The answer is: THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE BECOME NECESSARY!
10513,We should all *want* to wear masks to help the entire fucking country get back on track ASAP!
10514,"Ok, that’s all I have to say before my blood pressure spikes."
10515,How much domestic tourism happens in New Zealand vs US 🤔
10516,Whatever helps you sleep at night.
10517,"Looks like almost no one is doing enough testing, 7.9% is waaay above the recommendations."
10518,"Here in Hungary we had the largest confirmed two days ago too, with 10.67% positive."
10519,"This is the worst of it all, that the numbers are already grim and yet we can barely call this data with so many unconfirmed."
10520,"Ironic, since the type of people like you are the ones that downplay the serverity of the virus in the first place."

10523,Trump won’t surrender power.
10524,"If he goes onto a vent, they’ll have to put him in coma, then Pence will take over."
10525,Wouldn't want the cult leaders disapproval though.
10526,That trumps science in Washington DC at this time.
10527,Contact trace the shit out of everyone.

10531,This is the first time I've heard of it.
10532,He is not directly responsible for mass deaths and suffering.
10533,That’s absolutely ridiculous.
10534,"He shut down travel and was called a Xenophobe, while Pelosi called for people to “come on down to China town.” The MSM assured the people that this Covid thing was nothing to be worried about..."
10535,Please.
10536,Spare us all the tired old story about how Trump did nothing.
10537,He shut this country down at the advice of Fauci.
10538,He sent PPE and ventilators out to hospitals.
10539,He sent a naval ship to assist in NY &amp; California.
10540,"He had private companies manufacturing masks, and vents that had never done so before."
10541,"He allowed state governors and mayors to oversee their own state, governing, imposing lockdowns, requiring masks etc."
10542,"You see, The United States of America is a constitutional republic, meaning each citizen is given rights from God, not the government."
10543,Trump can’t issue a federal mask mandate anymore than he can stop protests.
10544,"This is America, not communist China."
10545,"Imagine if you will, once Covid hit the US, the President forcing people to stay inside?"
10546,Imagine people being arrested for going to the store on a day that you were not allowed to?
10547,There would be no speaking up or speaking out about unfairness.
10548,"There would certainly be no option or opportunity to protest, right?"
10549,"You would be screaming about him being a dictator then... 
 Again, this is America."
10550,We don’t federally mandate masks for people that aren’t sick.
10551,We allow people to protest even during a pandemic.
10552,We allow people freedom to take risks.
10553,"You can blame Trump all you want, but it doesn’t make it true."
10554,He is not the villain here.
10555,He didn’t cause this pandemic.
10556,The unrest and division is coming straight from the Democrats and far left.
10557,"The same people who scream and cry over racial injustice are the very same people voting in late term abortion, or any abortion for that matter."
10558,So babies lives don’t matter?
10559,They are also the same people who are destroying businesses and people’s livelihood by burning and looting.
10560,The Democrat run cities are allowing this crap to continue.
10561,"They are responsible for this nonsense, and most have denied assistance from the federal government."
10562,They don’t want it to stop.
10563,"But, is 40-60% enough?"
10564,"Due to how contagious the virus is, those numbers don’t seem like they would be enough to get it under control."
10565,"If someone knows the answer, please say so."
10566,I’m honestly just asking
10567,My mind after reading this: don't quote Jeremy clarkson.
10568,Don't quote Jeremy clarkson!
10569,"Except for few very small and very rich countries, no one else can test the whole population to know the exact number of infected."
10570,"Even then, tests have limitations so you will miss a fraction of the infected."
10571,"But there are ways to estimate the number of infected via different ways, just ask the epidemiologists."
10572,K
10573,Not good for Alberta.
10574,Except for young people....
10575,France knocked deaths all the way down to like 5 per day with lockdowns the first time through.
10576,We never really stopped the first wave in the US.
10577,Nah lets let that shit change... to zero!
10578,That time passed 4 years ago.
10579,"There is no longer any ""high"" or 
""low"" ground, there is just them and us."
10580,And you are either with Us or with them.
10581,And if you are with them then you burn with them as well.
10582,"We did not make the rules, we are just following their lead as following the right and good path led to no where except where we are now."
10583,"There are no ""please"" and ""thank yous"" in this fight."
10584,The police in LA never even wear masks when they're out and about even though they're supposed to so why would we expect them to enforce any other measures to stop the spread?
10585,"If Chris Christie was only infected the day before, he probably wasn't contagious then."
10586,But they met for debate prep Saturday through Tuesday.
10587,So I guess the big question is whether the chain went (someone at the Rose Garden) -&gt; Trump -&gt; debate prep team.
10588,Or if one person infected both the Rose Garden attendees *and* the debate prep team on Saturday.
10589,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/29/pakistan-tweet-can-bring-death-sentence/

&gt; Faisal Khan, the teenager who murdered U.S. citizen Tahir Naseem in the courtroom while he was standing trial for blasphemy in July, became a hero overnight and received public accolades."
10590,"Yeah, not necessarily tourism friendly when you read such stuff."
10591,Same goes for Saudi Arabia.
10592,They want more visitors but their reputation is somewhat sketchy so most will refrain from picking that as their next destination.
10593,&gt;But the the glee on this thread and utter hate from supposed folks who are just about “science” have depressed me.
10594,"Well, this is a guy who downplayed the COVID crisis, leading to 200K deaths, paid little to no taxes in the past 15 years despite calling himself a billionaire, teargassed peaceful protesters in order to do a photo-op where he held a bible upside down, avoided service while having a history of insulting military veterans, and is currently working to dismantle the USPS and throw the election into chaos with his Proud Boy supporters."
10595,And this is just the stuff from THIS year.
10596,I mean how do you expect people to feel?
10597,&gt;Seriously how do you think we got a Trump in the first place.
10598,I don't understand your reasoning here.
10599,"If anything, the fact that alot of people in this country despise this man is the reason why he's gonna lose this election."
10600,Sweden did better than most countries lol
10601,Can I ask with these massive cases why come the death rate is so low?
10602,In glad people aren't loosing their life to covid but curious on why.
10603,"This will help you 
https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/236/htm"
10604,"T cells do not produce antibodies, B cells do."
10605,"If Trump manages to steal the election, the United States could see a million deaths by itself."
10606,Yet they're still allowing thousands of fans in football and rugby stadiums.
10607,This winter is going to be horrible.
10608,The republicans in Michigan defeated the governor in court so they will do away with the mask mandate and all restriction on bars and restaurants just in time for winter.
10609,"The covid number will soar like mad this winter in Michigan, you can count on that!"
10610,"SD, ND and Wisconsin are already out of control."
10611,Winter will make it even worse.
10612,The uk has a vaccine on the last phase or human testing and should be immunising people by April next year.
10613,Only healthy people receive two different experimental drugs
10614,If he died i think there could be a surge in republican voting because it is no longer existential without Trump being able to take office.
10615,So Pence could benefit from the support.
10616,&gt; This is the largest number of CONFIRMED positive cases in one day.
10617,There are numerous sources that say cases could have actually been at 100k per day in March.
10618,"The same applies to the US, but we like to conveniently forget that"
10619,"In light of recent events, should we be reevaluating the secondary attack rate?"
10620,I'm always gonna side with the science in the absence of any other evidence but it seems like 20% might just be observably untrue at this point.
10621,What hard choices Tam?
10622,"Australian, authoritarian style lockdown?"
10623,"Where you can’t even go for a walk that takes you more than 5 km from your house, Tam?"
10624,Just try to lock us into an Australian style lockdown.
10625,It doesn’t work.
10626,It won’t work.
10627,We won’t let it.
10628,God damn man.
10629,I don’t know what the end is.
10630,"But I feel like whatever “hard choices” we have to make, they aren’t being made by the public."
10631,They aren’t democratic.
10632,I don’t know what the end is..... but I don’t think letting the government decide when we can and can’t visit family/friends is that end.
10633,Fuck.
10634,Huh so turns out France decided to go with the do nothing strategy once it resurged like America.
10635,Never would've guessed.
10636,They're still not done the federal investigations into why the messed up the first one so badly.
10637,"California reports all it's own cases and is run by a democrat governor, has two democratic senators and a democratic super majority in it's state senate - so how could a republican talking point be changing the data that's coming out of California."
10638,"Trolls gonna troll, but just like a pikachu using thundershock on a geodude it's not having any effect."
10639,What did Sweden do?
10640,Genuinely curious.
10641,"Ok, good for you."
10642,"Most news only mention regeneron and Vitamin D, so if someone read such an article they wouldn't *know* that it is missing details and that they have to spend their time reading lots of other articles to get the full picture."
10643,But the threat of President Pelosi might actually be higher if they vote R in that case.
10644,Maybe people wear them fully when moving around and pull them down to breathe better when seated.
10645,Less touching of the mask when you don't take it off and put it back on.
10646,"Ironic, since the type of people like you are the ones that downplay the serverity of the virus in the first place."
10647,&gt; The US is full of idiots... yes we have plenty of them.
10648,They are all in Florida and California.
10649,"No, no."
10650,There are idiots in many more states than that.
10651,also easier to mute on zoom.
10652,"Ideally, yes."
10653,Especially when you have a novel technology like mRNA srRNA vaccines.
10654,"But still, Phase I-II-III studies in a year should give pretty solid safety information."
10655,Closed down?
10656,"Even in places like San Francisco, gyms, nail salons, museums, some indoor dining are open."
10657,Even movie theaters are reopening next week.
10658,What I'm getting at is that neither clinical trials nor compassionate use are relevant.
10659,"Either the government is paying Regeneron, in which case I am asking what the price is, or Regeneon is giving it to Trump for free which is a different kettle of fish."
10660,"Yea I've never been as skeptic as today about my home country (Belgium)

Thank god there's a finally a government of 7 parties now that excludes both largest parties of the last elections."
10661,"Gonna be fun and stable again, with candy for every participating party's voters and a whole lot of extra fiscal debt for the rest of 'em."
10662,"by purposefully failing to treat and subsequently unnecessarily killing swathes of their most vulnerable in the first wave*

10663,The pandemic is going to last 12-18 months.
10664,Many businesses will not survive in a capitalist system.
10665,They will be bought out by people who made money during the pandemic.
10666,A vaccine that is 40-60% effective?
10667,Probably.
10668,A vaccine offering protection for more than a year?
10669,I don't think we have good chances there.
10670,Maybe in 10 years.
10671,My SO’s parents moved from NY to GA then to FL.

10835,Exactly.
10836,"I can imagine it sucks if you're working the line in a kitchen, or in the heat outside, but for most of us NBD."
10837,Don’t jinx us
10838,"So sad, so true."
10839,Secret Service officers posted in the building's lobby and elevators during the president's time on site were all wearing masks as well as other campaign officials seen on site earlier in the day.
10840,And the hotel had been enforcing its mask requirement and mandatory temperature checks on guests and hotel staff in the days leading up to the debate.
10841,Went to my favourite restaurant with the family over the weekend since we are now on Level 1 but people on the beachfront hardly bothered with masks ... can't really blame them ... most are fatigued after 6 months of this.
10842,&gt;Pretty much the same strategy employed by most countries that went into lockdown and have been safely been reopened for months.
10843,Have you seen Europe?
10844,"Western Europe was in lockdown for months and gradually re-opened with mandated mask use and social distancing, but now cases are rising substantially (UK and France for example over 12K new cases yesterday)."
10845,"The lockdowns worked for sure, but people aren't taking things seriously now that they've been given a sniff of freedom again."
10846,"But to that end, what's the solution - indefinite lockdown?"
10847,At what risk - economic fallout?
10848,"Some businesses rely on being open otherwise they collapse, and that's people's livelihoods potentially down the drain."
10849,The biggest impact of Covid isn't the virus itself.
10850,"Lockdown isn't a good long-term strategy - following the rules (mask use, social distancing, group size/bubbles) is though."
10851,Sadly not enough people realise this.
10852,Hunker down as in stay inside?
10853,I've already done that since it showed up in Washington all the way until late August.
10854,Meanwhile my housemates were carelessly out and about so I've been at risk anyway.
10855,"I wear my mask religiously, but I'm going out."
10856,Mostly outdoor stuff.
10857,If I hunker down again I'll probably have a heart attack and die from loneliness and stress anyway.
10858,Russian foreign agents sow discord.

10862,"Hours before they were seen watching Tuesday's presidential debate without masks in violation of safety protocols, members of President Donald Trump's family, campaign staff and White House team also flouted a mask mandate at a hotel frequented by visitors to Cleveland Clinic."
10863,"Trump and his traveling entourage spent several hours ahead of the debate at Cleveland Clinic at the InterContinental Suites Hotel Cleveland, one of several hotels near or on the campus of the world class medical facility, and used by people traveling to the clinic for work and medical procedures."
10864,"ABC News spotted Eric and Lara Trump, White House adviser and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien -- who has since tested positive for COVID-19 -- walking around the hotel lobby without masks, perusing the snack shop and a buffet that appeared to be set aside for the White House group."
10865,A lot more than 6-feet social distancing easily managed with no eefort than even ealking the street.
10866,"Much better than restaurants, trains, busses."
10867,Not as good as Central Park... but still.
10868,"Plus the temperature control at the entrance, while not perfect is something."
10869,But how is liberals believing “socialism is bad” in any way a response to conservatives?
10870,Mitch McConnell once filibustered a bill *that he proposed* because it was getting bipartisan support and could potentially pass.
10871,"IMO, that pretty much sums up modern Republicans."
10872,He probably gets more prentice treatment as president.
10873,Not waiting for the bad like some normal people.
10874,Also the majority of people who die at home later don't have the medical monitoring that Trump does.
10875,Not everyone in Orange County is choosing to dine indoors though (and places that are even open are only at 25% capacity).
10876,Myself &amp; many friends and family aren’t.
10877,Not using the gym (but I think you still need to mask up?).
10878,"You’re not getting Covid driving in your own car, so freeways &amp; streets being busy doesn’t matter (although anecdotally I’m still seeing less traffic)."
10879,I don’t see anyone storming stores w/o a mask on &amp; I haven’t been shamed for wearing a mask or insisting my daughter wear one.
10880,This is what I’ve been thinking.
10881,Having a the us start to wear mask like China is a win for China.
10882,Not the Chinese’s people themselves.
10883,The Chinese government.
10884,They want to cut America down.
10885,They have been having wear mask for years there.
10886,Smog and whatnot.

10901,I find it impossible to understand the contradictory information

10903,Maybe hold the people in charge responsible instead of endangering fellow citizens?
10904,My income this year is pathetic but that doesn't mean I say fuck it and disregard the pandemic.
10905,"There are plenty of examples of countries and even states that have gotten shit under control, there is no reason the US shouldn't."
10906,Riiiight.
10907,Pretty sure you were crying when RBG died and you realized trump will get her replaced.

10915,If anything protecting Trump's reelection and his image of being strong and a fighter.
10916,Plus can't say Corona hit him hard as just a flu or less.
10917,Very reassuring to know that the person with the nuclear codes takes a drug which can cause confusion and amnesia.
10918,National security risk /s
10919,Can I ask without sounding rude why do people panic buy toilet paper?
10920,I live in Greece and we had a 3 month lockdown.
10921,"We had no panic buying, loads of toilet paper and fresh food."
10922,"I didn’t understand why in the US, U.K. or Australia people went crazy buying toilet paper?"
10923,Or risk standing in lines for hours waiting to busy some?
10924,Something similar happened to a friend of mine.
10925,She felt good enough to get up and do some housework one morning.
10926,By that afternoon she was gone.
10927,I doubt something like this will happen with Trump given the amount of medical monitoring he as.
10928,"Its you’re*, dad."
10929,I can’t be my best if you can’t even use proper grammar dad.
10930,No dots needed.
10931,"You asked for an area, I gave it."

10967,Imagine if they did say to wear masks shortly after that and Trump continued to deny it all the way until October.
10968,Quit deflecting from that orange moron who is still killing people.
10969,Those people are already doing that.
10970,The lockdowns protect the rich and white collar workers while the blue collar workers have no choice regardless of if they are high risk or not.
10971,We should give high risk people basic income instead of forcing them to work.
10972,But neither political party in the US is even trying to really help them.

11055,You don't want dexamethasone preventatively.
11056,It suppresses your immune system response.
11057,Dexamethasone is given to patients who are experiencing a cytokine storm response in order to suppress the overreaction from their immune system.
11058,"That he is getting it suggests one of two things: 

1."
11059,"They are either ignoring the protocol and giving it to him before his immune system has has gotten out of control, in which case they are suppressing the very thing that they need to work correctly."
11060,2.
11061,They are giving it to him because his immune system is already causing damage via a cytokine storm.
11062,In which case he is in much worse shape than they are intimating.
11063,In either of these scenarios he can be up and walking around.
11064,He can present himself as reasonably stable in videos and photos if needed.

11071,And I’m working on that.
11072,Yeah I use to ascribe to that maxim.
11073,The past 4 - 5 years of bad faith arguments and hiding behind fake ignorance have made me default think the opposite.

_____________________


It started in July with 80 doctors, but according to the group's founders over a thousand have now signed the ""brandbrief"" (urgent letter) about the corona measures (the Netherlands has 75,000 doctors in total)."
11299,"The skeptical doctors want a debate about whether the current policy, which was tightened this week, isn't worse than the ailment itself."
11300,"General practitioner Saskia Benthem from Afferden, Limburg, is one of the signatories; microbiologist Marc Bonten of the UMC Utrecht supports the current measures."
11301,Two different visions based on the six concrete points from the urgent letter.
11302,**1: The virus should be removed from List A of notifiable diseases.
11303,"Covid-19 has turned out to be no more deadly or dangerous than other flu viruses**


Benthem: ""We are definitely not virus deniers, it is clear that corona is a nasty virus and that measures are needed."
11304,We are concerned with proportionality.
11305,"Worldwide, the estimate is now a mortality of 0.6 percent."
11306,"With an average age of the deceased of over 80. """
11307,"Bonten: ""The exact mortality of corona is difficult to determine, just like with the flu."
11308,"Especially when the healthcare sector is flooded and the intensive care units in hospitals are full, as happened in March."
11309,What do you think the death toll would have been if no action had been taken and the IC's had to turn down thousands of people?
11310,"If you look at the models of the epidemic, it would have come to at least 69,000."
11311,"Corona is really different from the flu."""
11312,"Benthem: ""In any case, the mortality is not comparable to, for example, Ebola, which has a death rate of 50 percent."
11313,"Those are the diseases on the A-list next to covid, that enable far-reaching measures, such as forced physical examination and forced quarantine."""
11314,**2: Scaling down the measures and returning to 'normal' as soon as possible.
11315,Current measures are causing more damage than they are trying to prevent.
11316,"**

Bonten: ""This proposition assumes that there will be no economic, social and psychological damage if you abolish the measures."
11317,"But believe me: without a lockdown, the societal misery would have been extreme."
11318,"The economy stagnates when the coffins pile up, the schools have to close due to a lack of staff, no one dares to take to the streets and you no longer have access to healthcare because the hospitals are flooding."
11319,"Benthem: ""No one can predict exactly what would have happened if no measures had been taken."
11320,"What I do know, as a general practitioner, is what the consequences were of the measures: the increased child abuse, the anxiety disorders, the elderly who become more isolated and fall more often, the cancer diagnoses missing for months, and so on."
11321,"I find this particularly distressing among young people, given that they are not at all a risk group."
11322,"In that respect I look with great interest at the policy in Sweden, where the virus can circulate under controlled resilient part of the population."
11323,"In order to build up immunity and thus ultimately protect the vulnerable part. """
11324,**3: Lifting of restrictions on freedoms and fundamental rights.
11325,Measures may only be applied in consultation and on the basis of free choice.
11326,"**


Bonten: ""I think this point is something a lawyer should discuss."""
11327,"Wim Voermans, professor of constitutional and administrative law in Leiden: ""If you, as a government, want to take measures that restrict freedom or restrict fundamental rights, you must do so with the consent of parliament."
11328,That is my objection to the corona measures in their current form.
11329,"The question is whether you should go that far, because more generally, according to great freedom thinkers such as Stuart Mill, you achieve more with citizens by appealing to their own responsibility than by enforcing them."""
11330,"Benthem: ""The emergency- or corona-law is what our objections focus on."
11331,"Maybe I am naive, but I do believe that you can achieve more if you give people the opportunity to make the right decisions themselves."
11332,"Based on the right information, based as much as possible on scientific insights."""
11333,**4: Clarify the purpose of the measures.
11334,"Flattening the curve, the original goal of the measures, has long been achieved."
11335,"**

Bonten: ""Looking at the figures at the moment, I would like to know from the authors whether their previous statement from July is still valid."
11336,"The curve of the number of infections and hospital admissions is clearly rising again."""
11337,"Benthem: ""That statement is certainly still topical."
11338,"It is true that the numbers are increasing, also in hospitals."
11339,"But keep in mind: because we now know more about the virus and the treatment has clearly improved, significantly fewer people end up on the IC's."
11340,This increases the capacity by 30 percent.
11341,In the meantime we continue to wonder what exactly is the purpose of these measures?
11342,Protection of the weak?
11343,"I want that too, I even became a doctor to do so!"
11344,But the point is I see the weaker people are negatively affected by our measures.
11345,I wonder how long people will last.
11346,What if it takes five more years before there is a safe and effective vaccine?
11347,"Do we keep locking ourselves up several times a year?"""
11348,**5: Positive corona tests are falsely labeled as 'infection' and 'outbreak'.
11349,"**

Benthem: ""The concrete consequence of using the PCR test to determine the number of infections is that the outbreak appears to be larger than it is."
11350,"While you can't take these results too seriously and 98% of the infected people hardly get sick, if at all."
11351,This applies in particular to young people.
11352,"If you can keep them away from their 'grannies', then the question is whether all of these measures should even apply to them."""
11353,"Bonten: ""There is a grain of truth in the statement."
11354,"The PCR test that the laboratories use is very sensitive, it quickly shows that you carry the virus."
11355,But not how contagious you are.
11356,The idea is that you are more contagious with a large virus load.
11357,"We are now waiting for rapid tests that are less sensitive, but may actually detect infectious persons."
11358,"However, those have not yet been validated."""
11359,**6: Government policy should primarily focus on health promotion.
11360,"The current 'fear of the virus', the 1.5 meter measure, and masks unnecessarily lower the resistance, further increasing the risk of infections and other health issues."
11361,"**

Bonten: ""Of course I welcome a healthy lifestyle, but you must be able to demonstrate that this statement is correct."
11362,"As far as I know, there is no evidence that it negatively affects people's health if they work at home or wear masks."""
11363,"Benthem: ""Let me turn it around: nearly 80 percent of patients in the ICU are overweight."
11364,The government is investing tens of millions in support measures during this time of corona.
11365,"Why doesn't part of that money go to free sports, 1000 euros if you can quit smoking, those kinds of measures?"""

11440,This actually makes sense more than anything else that I've read.
11441,It depends on the virus and the types of cells they can infect.
11442,SARS-COV-2 is thought to target a certain receptor that is prevalent in the nose and also the lungs.
11443,Other viruses may target other types of cells.
11444,Its because their entire platform is “does it hurt dems”
11445,We already collectively decided to do Christmas in July of next year.
11446,"Going to save the PTO , rent a beach house or a few and have people there."
11447,Wasn't ideal with the older generations until we spun it more like a vacation mixed with the holiday and they seemed to be more on board.
11448,"The idea is that hopefully by then, more treatment options and the amount of beds in the hospital will be more in July than right after Xmas if heaven forbid we get sick"
11449,I think it's more what the parent was saying.
11450,"I took a 5 seconds on each nostril covid test, and it's fine."
11451,"Not something I would do for fun, but it was also definitely something I could do for like 10 minutes straight with no real issues."
11452,Sweden's strategy has always been to get R&lt;1 with what they consider sustainable methods.
11453,"It's fucking weird that they won't use contact tracing or mask wearing,  which are the two cheapest ways to reduce R. But the rest of their actions make sense from that goal."
11454,"&gt; wider than it was possible to contain

If you don't contact trace,  the level of spread doesn't make it harder to contain."
11455,I’ve been hunkered down but was starting to think of going back to the gym.
11456,I’m now thinking that would not be a good idea.
11457,Even if it’s not crowded and you take precautions it feels like it would be difficult to stay safe.
11458,Maybe not until after fall/winter.
11459,Thoughts?
11460,Exactly.
11461,"Putin's goal wasn't to get Trump elected, perse."
11462,"It was just to create chaos in the US, period."
11463,Did they meddle?
11464,Of course.
11465,Playing both sides?
11466,You bet.
11467,Is it more obvious on the Republican side?
11468,Yup.
11469,Well trump was bragging about how much he has the people around him get tested.
11470,He literally telegraphs all the shit we then hear news reports about and everyone seems to be so shocked over it.
11471,It's hard to know if a liar is lying to you or when they are being honest though so it's always better to just assume they are lying and then figure it out afterwards once you have evidence.
11472,And the crime here isn't that they idiotically chose to ignore the advice of EVERY TRAINED IMMUNOLOGIST.
11473,Or even that they ignored simple common sense.
11474,"They repeatedly expressed surprise when a staffer 'tested negative yesterday  I dont know what happened that she was  positive today""  Really?"
11475,Its not obvious that everyone is negative until they are positive?
11476,No  that is stupidity and utter lack of leadership.
11477,"The real crime here is 8 months of LYING about the risks, ridiculing the use of precautions  pretending that it would just go away."
11478,"Right up to Tuesday when Trump mocked Joe Biden for wearing his mask ""everywhere""  That attitude has created a nation where wearing not a fucking mask is some sort of lunatic political position."
11479,It's even spread beyond the US .
11480,The actions of leaders MATTER.
11481,When the President of the United States does something  or mocks something others do  gullible people listen.
11482,"His actions and words, along with those of his minions  has directly put at risk millions of Americans."
11483,"So.much so that despite  pricing itself on the best Healthcare system in the world, the US has 20% of the WORLD'S deaths."
11484,"How many less would have died had the President simply endorsed,in word AND DEED, simple mask wearing."
11485,"Of all the idiocy demonstrated during the debate, that one short episode when Trump mocked Biden for wearing masks should stand as the signature image of his lack of leadership."
11486,We saw two images of leadership  the difference was stark.
11487,"Vote for the smart one, the realistic one, the one demonstrating his leadership."
11488,"Why would you ask a question like this on reddit, or this sub for that matter."
11489,You will never ever get an actual answer.
11490,Just hear the echoes of the Reddit circlejerk.
11491,Joe rogan voted for Bernie sanders.
11492,That’s alt left
11493,[white house comms director confirms that the press conferences are mostly done for trump's benefit because he's getting news about his on treatment from cable TV](https://twitter.com/Grace_Segers/status/1312814493521661954?s=20)
11494,"The Lincoln Project, while a welcome breath of fresh air, is very much an outlier."
11495,However there is not a single member of the Senate or House who is currently a member of the Republican party that has express opposition to Trump's reelection.
11496,"Maybe it's a bit hyperbolic to explicitly say ""No Republicans"" but it's an easier thing to say than ""No Republicans unless that specific person has shown that they will put the public interest above the interests of their party and donors""."
11497,"Perfect example, I live in Mass and we have a Republican governor in Charlie Baker."
11498,I very much would vote for him because he has shown that he and his platform is not entirely defined by the R next to his name.
11499,Presumably the White House would have priority access to the best labs in the area.
11500,I'm curious how long it would take for them to get back results for daily testing with the regular PCR test.
11501,"From my understanding, the delays with getting results are generally from the volumes being tested, not necessarily the time to process the actual test."
11502,"Dear, I so hate it how having received any kind of education now equals being brainwashed."
11503,"I can understand a bias if I did anything social, but I did STEM."
11504,"1+1 is now socialist propaganda or ""what main stream media wants me to think""."
11505,"Some are proud, loud and uneducated."
11506,As if failing primary school somehow made them smarter.
11507,"I'd rather be a sheep following a leading virologist on this subject, than a sheep trusting a dance teacher his opinion."
11508,"Also everything is made to be ""an opinion"" that is equally valuable."
11509,While half of those are just factually incorrect.
11510,Me thinking the sun is colder than the moon doesn't make it true

11529,"they did accomplish undoing a lot of progress made under Obama - without any care whether it's good for the country or not, simply cause Obama did it, they must destroy it"
11530,Just impossible in a huge country like India with plenty of Anti establishment news agencies thriving around.
11531,This will likely never get mass produced enough to be offered to the general public.
11532,"Quest diagnostics right now charges over $100 for a test, they're making a lot of money."
11533,"Many people can't afford the test, afford the copay it takes to go get a prescription to get a test, and other issues."
11534,"Many people live far away from a lab, medical center."
11535,"If a lot of people have confirmed positive diagnosis, then the states would have to roll back or restrict opening up and lose money on lockdowns - and they don't want to do that."
11536,I’ve been doing all those things since the beginning of March.
11537,I haven’t gone to a single store.

11539,How big of a growth spurt do you need?
11540,[removed]
11541,"No, because it's not a strict, zero sum game."
11542,They didn't purposely weaponize the virus.
11543,That was a consequence of their negligence.
11544,"But they did work out the calculus of the longer term effect, and realized that the situation would lead to an increase in urban voters' utilization of absentee and early mail ballots."
11545,The next part of the strategy was to sabotage the postal service.
11546,"The combination move that makes this strategy into brilliant (ordinary, not ""4D"") chess, was to seize the opportunity to manipulate the Supreme Court in a way that would help assure success when the election is challenged on the basis of some effect of the postal sabotage that was done during the Summer."
11547,"What the architects of this plan had not considered, was the complication of a two front war, the attack on the democratic process itself (his ""France"") and his coming battle with the coronavirus (his ""Russian Winter"")."
11548,"The plan had a chance of succeeding, but that ship has sailed."
11549,"Damn, for real?"
11550,Lol.
11551,"I heard the COVID one was more for scientific info, I was trying to find a sub for practical questions and this seemed more like one!"
11552,"But yeah being new here, I don’t really know what goes on in here."
11553,"I just saw a couple of questions and responses on this thread and they seemed pretty down to earth so thought someone might have an experience to share, I’m especially interested in if anyone has experienced the white coating with COVID."
11554,"I hear you though, some of these subreddits can do more harm than good."
11555,Thanks for the warning!
11556,[removed]
11557,I'm guessing there may be two things there.
11558,"Better care may be resulting in shorter hospital stays, so numbers of hospitalizations at any one time may be lower."
11559,"And also, people are probably waiting the same amount of time to go to the hospital as before, nobody wants to be in a hospital."
11560,Its both.
11561,Cold weather absolutely make its worse.
11562,It's similar to the flu in that aspect.
11563,"Also, people are going to get sickier with the arrival of colder weather."
11564,You can see this already happening in Wisc w record hospitalizations.
11565,[removed]
11566,Sounds a lot like mission accomplished to me
11567,I think when the bidet is a separate fixture you sit facing the water stream so it moves front to back.

11579,"&gt;if put in the spot he will say ""I wear masks when appropriate"" and then ridicule others for doing so."
11580,He did precisely this during that debacle which passed for a debate.
11581,Different strains.
11582,"But when we say ""it has mutated"" in this way,  we (and certainly OP) mean such that the immune system sees it as two different diseases."
11583,"In the science sub they don't even call those different strains,  though I forget the word they do use."
11584,"“I said if you wanna leave tomorrow, just go ahead now... and if you wanna take untested drugs, yeah, just go ahead now...”"
11585,"The meeting friends point is the critical one, you're going to be extremely unlucky to catch covid walking down the street or standing at a bus stop but people meeting up with friends is what's driving the increases here but realistically most people are never going to wear masks in their own homes"
11586,Somehow children are exempt?
11587,So silly.
11588,"Korean babies are freaking more mature than most people, I swear."
11589,"I can't understand what their deal is with the masks, especiially in the White House where there's no public?"
11590,Are they trying to get sick and kill their own staff?
11591,No political posturing is worth death.
11592,I can't get my head around how stupid this is.
11593,Why pick this particular hill to literally die on lol
11594,They used rapid covid-19 testing the same way you could use pregnancy tests to prevent pregnancy.
11595,[removed]
11596,And yet a google search shows nothing disproving it.
11597,"So, by all means, keep up the China simping."
11598,It's a pride thing.
11599,They have railed against it so much now that they have to die on the hill because they cut off all avenues of escape.
11600,Can't believe only now face masks indoors is recommended?
11601,Sounds even worse than in the US.
11602,"In my area of the US, if you don't wear a mask indoors, people give you the death stare."
11603,&gt;wearing a mask when in a large well ventilated supermarket.
11604,wearing a mask is essential in supermarkets.
11605,First I do not have your certainties ventilation is good.
11606,Second it is basically impossible to distance properly from people in supermarkets (not that it works).
11607,Third supermarkets are essential.
11608,"People can avoid going to pubs or restaurants, but places like supermarkets or pharmacies, they have a right to be as safe from others as possible in there."
11609,There is voter apathy.
11610,But there is also overt voter suppression.
11611,"It is worth reading the entire Wikipedia page, but I'll sum it up:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Florida_Amendment_4

 Essentially Amendment 4 to the constitution of the state of florida would have restored voting rights to non-violent felons upon completion of their sentences."
11612,DeSantis (same gov who is pushing to make protesting illegal) then signed a law by his republican legislature that felons can only have their sentences consider finished after they have paid all court fines/restitution (which could be hundreds of thousands of dollars that they will never actually be able to pay off).
11613,"17 people sued and won on the basis that the stipulation to pay in full, even though the time was already completed, was akin to a poll tax."
11614,This got appealed to the supreme court of Florida where it got overruled.
11615,A felon who is found to have voted can face purgery charges.
11616,amendment 4 should have restored voting rights to 1.5 million people.
11617,"The NYT podcast The Daily just had a short episode on this that I'd worth the listen: https://open.spotify.com/episode/5zswrn80FujKDTxMsRNRfu?si=1CESdcCtRcy761wYZAq9pg

Now this is one of the most extreme and egregious cases."
11618,The kind that makes me see red and feel hopeless.
11619,I cannot fathom how debt should be justified as a reason to keep someone disenfranchised.
11620,"It's because republicans know that suppression ensure they stay in power, which coincidentally was admitted by Trump as he moved to break the USPS and under mind vote by mail in a pandemic."
11621,"Other greatest hits of the republican party is the governor race in georgia, and the current ""1 ballot drop off box PER COUNTY"" in Texas."
11622,Republican execs are corrupt and vying for favor of Trump in the most cartoonishly villainous ways.
11623,The US president being Donald Trump is a huge national security risk.
11624,You guys havent even properly finished your first wave yet.
11625,Since the begining the US has rarely gone below 20k a day while at one point france uk Spain and Italy had it in the low hundreds.
11626,We are definitely in our second wave but I dread to see what the second american wave will look like

11653,The single largest source of such misinformation is the president.
11654,This had been scientifically studied.
11655,"He sets the standard that the country follows,  and it is destroying us."
11656,I believe we are [33rd](https://covidactnow.org/us/pennsylvania-pa?s=1102246) with a positive test rate of  7.4% which indicates adequate testing.
11657,"The incubation period is 2-14 days, with most people showing symptoms 5-7 days after infection."
11658,Most people are capable of spreading 1-2 days before showing symptoms.
11659,"Before symptoms show, the rapid tests have a high chance of false negatives."
11660,"The ""regular"" one is better at getting a true positive during that 1-2 days before symptoms, but you would still get a false negative on the regular test if you test too early."
11661,"In other words, a typical trajectory could look like this:
Day 1 - infected
Day 2- no symptoms, negative on both tests
Day 3 - no symptoms, negative on both tests
Day 4 - no symptoms, negative rapid test, maybe positive regular test
Day 5 - no symptoms, negative rapid test, positive regular test
Day 6 - symptoms, positive on both tests

So anyone in Day 5 around the White House (or anywhere using the rapid tests improperly like they were) is very dangerous!"

11681,I live on the German side of the border to the Netherlands and I was shopping there last week.
11682,"You could tell who the Germans were, because they were all wearing masks."

11714,They don’t care about governing.
11715,They care about keeping their power which leads to more dirty money.
11716,And by simply opposing the evil libtards they know they’ll get re-elected over and over again because of the vocal and deliberately minimally educated population that they call their constituents.

11746,"Honestly, I feel like most of it has just been growing for years with the amount of insulting going on from the right towards the left."
11747,At this point most can't seem to have a rational conversation without turning to insulting someone else's opposing viewpoint.
11748,"Now mind you, the left is certainly in that game too and I despise hearing commentators turn to opinion instead of reporting fact."
11749,"However, I can't think of one conversation with someone that had right leaning values without  insults thrown in."
11750,I'm not a fan of Trump.
11751,I can't vote for him.
11752,200k Americans have died.
11753,Pointing out he is not the same as a serial killer or a communist dictator that killed 28-60 million people isn't putting him on a pedestal.

11757,*
11758,It’s not a big deal like you want to make it out to be.
11759,"A variety of irrational reasons:

- Republicans tend favor individualism over community, so often don't care how their actions hurt others."
11760,- Vanity.
11761,- Misinformation.
11762,Nearly 1 million practicing physicians in the U.S. but the few quacks who are anti-mask get most of the attention in their echo chambers.
11763,- Some still think the virus is a hoax or no worse than the flu.
11764,"- Trump promotes this misinformation, discourages mask use, and many follow their leader."
11765,"If Trump was strongly pro-mask, many more in his party would be too."
11766,The Republicans I know who are pro-mask are seniors and more personally vulnerable.
11767,Not every job can be done from home.
11768,"The ideal is that those who *can* work from home do so, leaving the buildings for the people who need to physically be there."
11769,I'm in IT on a software team.
11770,The software team has been home since March.
11771,The network manager has been in his server dungeon alone.
11772,"The help desk, who have to support hundreds of computers inside a very complicated lab, have had to maintain an on site presence because physical equipment may require hands on deck to fix."
11773,"I believe about 1/3 of the entire staff of 1000 for my building has been home at least some of the time, but our lab techs don't have a choice."
11774,For one thing... they're doing PCR tests for covid!
11775,What did he say?
11776,I mean its obvious he wasn't being effectively tested on a regular basis.
11777,"If he woke up wednesday morning and had a covid symptom, ""wednesday morning's"" test would have picked it up."
11778,If later it becomes clear that Dr's caught it late because the idiots in the white house can't read the directions on the side of the box...I have no words.
11779,There are ways to tell them apart.
11780,"The easiest one, though not everyone gets it, is loss of sense of smell."
11781,That’s unique to COVID-19.
11782,Its more than a stuffy nose.
11783,"It’s when you can’t smell anything, even garlic held up to your nose, etc."
11784, Now we also know Trump knew exactly how bad things were going to be end of Jan and lied through his teeth and sat on his hands for months.
11785,"I think I’m just used to small time frames of “uncomfortable”, ya know?"
11786,But I’m picking up what you’re putting down for sure
11787,Thing is I’m talking about the problem of preventing future pandemic and you’re stuck on this one wet market in Wuhan.
11788,Saying the same things but you keep bringing it back to that one market it Wuhan.
11789,"K, fuck the wet market in Wuhan, now what?"
11790,"The next one could come from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Africa, South America, etc."
11791,So what’s the solution here?
11792,"My point is that is much much more likely that in the short term, we can stop these things from spreading by controlling our response to them."
11793,The response to Covid was horrendous in the west.
11794,Absolute failure on many parts in many countries.
11795,Is much simpler to fix our response then to fix this worldwide issue with prevention.
11796,While I agree because I’m not tying to go out to restaurants and put myself in situations that are high risk many people are being forced to go back to work in which they have to be inside.
11797,"That being said, having looked over a lot of the scientific data actually wearing is mask prevents the spread and protects you when you can’t social distance."
11798,If it works for those in healthcare that are in direct contact with people that have severe COVID cases I’m sure it works when having to be side with other people.
11799,It's just an opportunity to bully people for being different.
11800,Big mask Biden don't give a fuck though
11801,"I live here and it's some kind of ego-blow for people to wear one, has something to do with our high levels of liberty."
11802,"People would rather wait until it is law, then they will happily comply (high trust of government here)."
11803,"Unfortunately, government won't make it law."
11804,"That would be an ego-blow for such a liberal country to enforce this kind of action, it is felt that people should be treated as ""grown-ups"" and asked to take this action."
11805,"Of course, that's a vicious circle."
11806,Government refuses to enforce.
11807,People refuse to do it themselves.
11808,Cases are skyrocketing.
11809,"Deaths will too, soon enough we will be the no.1 basket case of Europe."
11810,I'm very saddened by the stubbornness in the opinions against masks.
11811,This sole opinion vs almost the entire world - a refusal to change your view.
11812,It would be humble to admit that you might be biased and to reconsider.

11824,"""Fuck you, I'll jump if I want to."""
11825,I have to breath in hot nasty smelling breathe every time I put on a mask.
11826,That along with the lockdown and I can't enjoy going to places.
11827,"I think it has something to do with being compared to people who wear face coverings in some Arab countries, but I can’t prove it."
11828,That they refused to safeguard the basic functions of government shows a systemic public health flaw.
11829,"Giesecke doesn't represent FHM or the government and in most of the articles you linked Tegnell expressed careful optimism(no where did he, his agency or the government claim it was over)."
11830,While cases are on the rise in Sweden it's still too early to say whether it'll turn the same as most European countries as for the most part the big increases are only in Stockholm and it remains to be seen whether it'll manifest itself as a wave or a ripple.
11831,I think you missed my point.
11832,Can you prove god *does* exist?
11833,"I don’t have a “wild claim.” I don’t believe in god, it’s just that I don’t assume god doesn’t exist."
11834,"I’m comfortable knowing that humanity is limited, and is probably unable to prove or understand the true reason or circumstance behind the creation of our universe."
11835,Atheists who are as sure about the absence of god as fundamentalists are in the existence of god are making the same mistake.
11836,Perhaps you were responding to the wrong post?
11837,"Which is a spurious concern, because they are verified and validated upon receipt at the polling office either way."
11838,"If you don't use it, you just vote in person."
11839,"The real concern isn't ""fraud"" with unused ballots (which numerous studies have demonstrated doesn't happen in this manner anyways) , it's that ballot counters tend to be hyper-cautious and discard any mail-in ballots that seem invalid, which may disenfranchise some perfectly legitimate votes."
11840,This can happen regardless of distribution method.
11841,"I was talking about the incubation periods for STDs, but I’m guessing corona has like 5-14days period before someone shows symptoms."
11842,"And it seems this rapid test picks up on virus load, those recently infected with the virus it may take a few days before the test can detect the virus in them; also the article mentioned the rapid test not doing as well on asymptomatic people."
11843,"Whenever anyone raised any concerns about the way in which the White House was lax on wearing masks and social distancing, members of the administration immediately fired back by saying everyone was getting tested regularly."
11844,"President Donald Trump raised that argument numerous times, including during the debate."
11845,But it turns out the White House gave itself a false sense of security by using rapid tests in a way that was never intended.
11846,"The Abbott Laboratories test was used to test staff and others who came in contact with the president as a filter, and those who tested negative proceeded to go about their day without masks and with few other precautions."
11847,"What administration officials ignored, though, is that the test is known to deliver incorrect results, particularly for people without symptoms."
11848,"The White House may have ignored that little crucial fact about the test that can give results in 15 minutes, but it wasn’t exactly hidden."
11849,"When the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization for Abbott’s ID Now test, it made clear that it was to be used “within the first seven days of symptoms.” When it is used in people who don’t have symptoms, it can give a false negative in as many as 1 in 3 cases, notes the New York Times."
11850,"“It’s helpful to keep in mind that tests discover the presence of coronavirus once there’s enough viral material in a person to be able to detect it,” John Koval, spokesman for Abbott Labs, said in an email to the Washington Post."
11851,“No test detects the virus immediately after the person becomes infected.
11852,"There is no such thing as a 100 percent perfect and instantaneous test—for any disease.”

11861,"What's happening is that there’s not enough virus at the swabbed location to detect, but there's enough in the lungs to spread the virus."
11862,People can spread the virus for days before it can be detected in nasal swabs.

11877,Not just the White House but all the rich influencer crowd too.
11878,They all want to party and socialize so all they do is get tested the day before their trips with friends and go then get tested the day after.
11879,They don’t practice any safety precautions before and after the trip and think it’s a good justification for them being selfish.

11884,"The most important US-Australia lockdown comparison isn't about intensity, duration, or public adherence."

11891,Hell if I know.

11976,Contact tracing only works when you have a small number of cases.
11977,"If the number is large enough, then you reach the point where everyone in the city is a contact of someone who has had the virus recently."
11978,"There's no point in contacting everyone, and you can't just quarantine the whole city (unless you're China), and you don't have enough testing to test everyone right now."
11979,Not by that much.
11980,"IFR is probably lower in the parts of the world that have younger, less overweight populations with plenty of Vitamin D.

If herd immunity without vaccination is even possible, China will keep its borders closed for another year or longer."
11981,"By that time, vaccination may be on the cards for most of the world."
11982,"On the other hand, 60% may be too low an estimate for herd immunity."
11983,"So, ignoring vaccination, taking China out of the equation, and dropping IFR to a deliberately optimistic 0.3% for the world as a whole: you end up with 6.4B population × 0.6 × 0.003 = 11.5M in total, less the 1M who have died, so at least 10M without vaccination, if all the numbers otherwise work out."

12040,"Maybe if the US had to pay for the treatment of all COVID-19 patients they would actually actively stop the disease, but with their current medical system, more patients means more profit in the short term for their buddies in Big Pharma."
12041,WHAT?!
12042,Trump didn't understand the appropriate use of a cutting edge medical test?
12043,!
12044,That seriously hurt my brain.
12045,People are still denying that COVID is even real even after their King Lord and Savior was airlifted to the frigging hospital with it.
12046,I guess they can't bear the thought of him potentially not being around.
12047,I guess I naively thought that him getting it would make it real to the pandemic deniers.
12048,All of our models for radiation safety can be traced back to an event in which a nuclear core for an early weapon prototype reached critically in a room with 4 people.
12049,Each was a different distance from the core.
12050,Each died at different rates.
12051,He said bleach also.
12052,I don't get why people are so butthurt about masks.
12053,That’s the thinking yes
12054,That’s good!
12055,Not sure why I get downvoted by people instead of them trying to answer my question.
12056,Its never going away so.
12057,Eventually I expect flu \* 10 or so deaths per year
12058,Now that cases are booming they should get something soonish
12059,I never remove my mask in a classroom with students.
12060,"Six feet for social distancing isn't really enough, it's a bare minimum."
12061,"Also, be cautious with removing when the students leave because the air (and virus) didn't leave with them."
12062,Trovid?
12063,"Leadership in the USA did exactly what it was designed to do, let people be adults."
12064,Most were a proof that adulting doesn't come with age and got the rest of adults infected but by design nothing more could have been done as lock ups and federal interventions are frowned upon.
12065,Each state did what they thought was best.
12066,Not always what was actually best or even sufficient but the system is designed to provide just that level of freedom so it is what it is.
12067,You could argue that the system could be better though.
12068,That'd be fair and productive (provided it's followed by a vote to support it)
12069,But since our leader lives so will we.
12070,He didn't even wear a mask.
12071,That will ramp up many people .
12072,If he comes though easily his followers won't care anymore.
12073,Keep his news happy reelection is his and corona will also win.

12095,"We have tools - wash, wash, distance."
12096,Employing all three equally and fully is our best option for the next 12 months.
12097,Then their followre keep saying masks don't work watch so and so video showing them not working.
12098,No proven studies etc.
12099,Also they say some masks might work but there the government let private business try and pick up the slack which because pandemic might not last long enough to get their investment back didnt do.
12100,Plus of course government and leader not liking masks of course didn't push for a supply of quality masks as quick as possible.
12101,So stuck with homemade or cheap Chinese masks mostly that they can say are ineffective.
12102,Nope.

12110,Employing all three equally and fully is our best option for the next 12 months.
12111,I see.
12112,The reason might be that the level of censorship in China is on a WHOLE different level compared to in Vietnam (and the rest of the world).
12113,You really can't hide much of anything here since all the social media platforms are available for everyone.
12114,If only everyone could get remdesivir early in the course of infection.
12115,I think it should be cheaper and an option for everyone even if it isn’t that helpful.
12116,I also think the army of doctors is a bad look considering how many Americans have limited access to healthcare.
12117,They wait too long for help or are sent home from the ER.
12118,Sure would be if the governments and PEOPLE would start putting money and resources to the RIGHT things.
12119,Let's not forget you keep ignoring the possible long term complications to the nervous system and cardiovascular system with covid.
12120,Maybe I'm just cautious but those things never ended for me.
12121,"I'm still working from home (thankfully), getting groceries delivered, and only going out for essentials with a mask."
12122,Luckily I was pretty much a homebody before this but what fun stuff is even open to rush back out to?
12123,"I don't get people who ""need"" to eat at a restaurant despite there being an active pandemic."

12125,Hello fellow michigander!

12128,He only OWED $750.
12129,No it‘s human scum
12130,"I have personally been ""hunkered down"" since March, what is this ""again"" he is speaking of?"
12131,Trying to have any sort of long term outlook made me insane with changing guidance and rules every week (I work in education).
12132,"I switched to thinking every week will be the last at work, tested all my sped kids as quickly as possible, and have a list and big box labeled ""bug out"" for when were not allowed in the building anymore."
12133,"I can write reports at home, but not so much testing kids."
12134,Everyone else is running around like chickens with their heads cut off and feeling overwhelmed by a future that's unpredictable.
12135,"Not saying I'm stress free, but weekly planning has helped a great deal."
12136,Well leaving your personal information at restaurants is not excatly great i will give you that.
12137,But they are supposed to get rid of it after two weeks.
12138,"That's in the hands of restaurant owners, which is not excatly perfect."

12140,"The company I work for mandated this around 3 months ago - we’re still mainly wfh, but if you are in the office you have to wear your mask even at your cubicle or workspace."
12141,"I figured it was an abundance of caution type thing, and was mainly glad that they cared"
12142,Just riffing here but probably due to school district success having an outsized impact on housing prices.
12143,Families move for specific districts based on performance.
12144,Pre COVID all those rankings are based on in person performance.
12145,So maybe parents are over leveraged on a home and gotta get the one benefit out of the mortgage to justify the cost.
12146,Maybe they're worried housing value will plummet if the school loses ranking due to an online only year.
12147,That number is too high to be real....
12148,Right?
12149,Didn’t they determine that the Long QT risk with that didn’t outweigh its benefit?
12150,"If so, it speaks volumes about how serious it is considering how dangerous coronavirus is for those already hospitalized."
12151,100%.
12152,I’m in queens and it’s held together pretty good.
12153,"But now there’s a lot more beggars, homeless, garbage on the street."

12155,I do really like nyc but it’s the worst place in America to ride this out.
12156,"Small apartments, high rent, no events/activities, no car to get access to nature, maybe a super fucked economy."
12157,There’s no positives and I’m thinking of getting out of here.
12158,I don’t want to think long term.
12159,I’m struggling now having been cooped up since March with my kids.
12160,But no one here will wear masks.
12161,My oldest is higher risk it’s just garbage how selfish everyone is and to think I could continue to be stuck here for 6 more months... it’s a lot.
12162,I get what you’re saying but it was the county public health officials who declared it safe to return at least partial time back to school.
12163,I don’t agree with this but I feel powerless to do anything about it
12164,"To me, the interesting thing is the timing and the debate staff."
12165,"Everyone got sick at roughly the same time, implying it was someone who was at both the debate prep sessions as well as the Rose Garden ceremony."

12357,If you move down slowly enough to read each title you should be able to get through the list in one or two days.
12358,If you were to read every item the time required would be several months of constant attention.
12359,"Much of the epidemiology of the spread of the gleaned from the CDC's news reports, but it should be noted that the more complex ""answer"" is only found in the scientific literature."
12360,Reading those reports would be a matter of decades not months.
12361,Most of the 10s of thousands of papers in the epidemiology literature are specific to a given country.
12362,"There are some that are global in extent, but these are also very numerous."
12363,Here's [one study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30581-8/fulltext) from the Lancet on July 29.
12364,"The WHO bases its assessments on the scientific literature, not the other way around."
12365,The question of origins has also spawned a massive literature.
12366,Here's a July 28 [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4) from Nature magazine on the subject.
12367,Here's a September 11 [review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.552909/full) from Frontiers in Immunology that puts in origin in comparative perspective with other respiratory viruses.
12368,The bottom line on all this is that Covid 19 is definitely one of the two most investigated viruses ever seen.
12369,It may even have surpassed the HIV by now.
12370,The WHO has been (*massively*) forthcoming with information.
12371,The problem is that myth makers have been overactive as well.
12372,"All the conspiracy theories, the right wing American one that the Chinese did it, by accident or deliberately, the Chinese government one that the Americans did it either by accident or deliberately and even the idea that it arrived via a meteor from space, are all equally ridiculous and in fact quite pernicious."
12373,"People always look for simple answers, and we human animals are also routinely overeager to affix blame on others of our species."
12374,The trouble is that reality is nowhere as simple as we might like and blame is usually shared amongst many actors.

12376,Have they tried directly injecting kfc extra crispy into his stomach?
12377,"Honestly, that’s what I’ve come to expect from this awful year/4 years."
12378,Trump and a bunch of the GOP getting COVID from the ceremony nominating a stolen SCOTUS seat was too karmically good for 2020 - of course there’s going to be a twist to the dark side.
12379,Do you have a source on this?
12380,Because frankly that is an outrageous claim.
12381,30% of people who contracted covid have long term complications?
12382,So millions of people in the USA?
12383,[Reminds me of gadaffi's car parade around tripoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqf4bWGvd08)
12384,"If your body isn't actively fighting the virus, which is generally when you're showing symptoms, you won't have antibodies present to trigger a positive test result."
12385,Testing someone without symptoms won't tell you much.
12386,It's a poor defense when you're not doing anything else to protect against infection
12387,Low energy what?
12388,You?
12389,I agree.
12390,"Telling other people that they are horrible because they don't want to be left broke, destitute, and homeless because they are prohibited from working isn't really a good look and isn't a good way to win people to your side."
12391,I wouldn't mind a winter lockdown as long as people received proper aid.
12392,Winter would have been a lot better for it than Spring.
12393,I hate getting up early to go out in the cold.
12394,I expect that I would get some serious work done on my reading and fiction writing.
12395,It would be nice to have an annual extended break during the winter.
12396,I work at a library and was transferred from my normal department to help with curbside at a branch after they laid off 20% of the staff who were doing the main work.
12397,"I'm not sure what they will do in winter, anyway, as curbside will be less possible with freezing temperatures, possible ice, early sunset, etc."
12398,I'm not sure the library will want us walking across the parking lot in those conditions.
12399,"As it is, we have someone practically sitting outside all day for curbside ""walkups."""
12400,"But staff were getting sick when they let people inside, even with mask rules."
12401,We do have a leader who guided the country and made available any and all resources the states may need.
12402,The president is not king.
12403,He can only put out guidelines and makes federal funding and resources available to each state but ultimately it's up to that individual state leadership to decide how to act.
12404,It's literally the way our system was designed in order to have a government more representative of the people.
12405,If you don't like it there are plenty of authoritarian countries you're free to move to.
12406,"I'm thinking much less, even without covid."
12407,I don't think he has four.

12409,Wow that bad huh....
12410,Em... no it's not?

12412,"I'm not sure if you looked into the history of it, past pandemic left significant cultural marks that changed the societies for decades to centuries."
12413,&gt;she puts her cult leader before family or country.
12414,ftfy: she puts her ~~cult leader~~ salary before family or country.
12415,It's mostly that they constantly need wedge issues to use up all media time that would point out their lack of meaningful policy.
12416,Their actual policy consists only of staying in power and reducing taxes and regulation for their donors.
12417,They found out how well this worked for abortion so now they do it with everything.
12418,"I’ve viewed theaters as more of an experience than ""just"" watching a movie."
12419,Especially those that frequently do events like classic movies or anniversary specials.
12420,Sure you could add laugh tracks and gasps to the VR experience but I just don’t think it will feel the same.
12421,Claudia is a literal queen.
12422,"first

&gt;imagine bragging about being the 15th best public university lmao

and then

&gt;Looking at overall ranking as a whole is meaningless."
12423,"Yes, you did, derpie."
12424,"You make fun of the ranking but don't call it meaningless, only when I pointed out that 15 is top 1 percent do rankings not matter."
12425,You are disingenuous and I am done with you.
12426,I won't see your response.
12427,The problem is that anyone in those areas might catch it through community spread.
12428,Basically a negative result from a rapid test MIGHT mean the you were negative 5 days ago...
12429,In wuhan they discovered some people would feel better for a bit before crashing hard.
12430,Studies are showing upwards of 30% of non-hospitalized cases.
12431,That’s millions of people.
12432,How’s that for a comparison?
12433,Exactly like how 5G causes covid theory has been used to invalidate lab leak theories?
12434,Read other books
12435,Most of these people are too shallow to think about others in that way.
12436,We should at least encourage people to loose weight as much as we encourage people to wear a mask then.
12437,"If we ask some people with very little risk to take a break from their lives, we should also ask something in return from the ones at risk, in the limit of the possibilities of course (not asking a 80s to become 20s)."
12438,"Blaming the one who have a healthy lifestyle for the one who ate chips and soda on a daily basis for the last 3 decades, doesn't seem very fair to me."
12439,"( The US has withing it's population  25-30% more obese than some other countries, so put aside genetic disease, there is some room there ...)

And you dont have the victims, the one who died form the virus on one side, And the one who got it without caring and bring super spreader."
12440,In a majority of cases the victim of the virus was also not careful and a potential spreader.
12441,It ain't black and white.
12442,Thats sort of my point.
12443,"Maniac in charge is really Putin in disguise, nothing trump has done is in the interest of America, or average Americans."
12444,"We're also planning on taking back both chambers of congress, without it Biden will do whatever he wants."
12445,"We want him to have a strong congress that's checking every little thing he wants to do ""on his own"" like trump."
12446,"If that means a bunch of socialists in congress telling Biden that Medicare for all, or a green deal because California was on fire for months."
12447,So no the president is only 1 person in a large government that hasn't picked up bills passed by the house.
12448,Portable glory-hole kit sales are at an all time high it seems:  https://gloryholetogo.com
12449,The big question:  was kellyanne aka Mother of the Year positive prior to the Rosegarden Massacre?
12450,"I think white people see the mask as a muzzle, something you put on an animal or creature or lesser than, i.e."
12451,a slave.
12452,"It signals that one will be deemed as subservient and submissive, and akin to enslaved blacks, which is a position they will never ever let themselves be in."
12453,Here in Argentina we've been in lockdown since March yet cases are still growing.
12454,Europe did lockdown and cases are growing once again.
12455,"In the western countries lockdowns are only useful for buying time until a vaccine, because it's way too late to eliminate the virus."
12456,"The vaccine better come quick, because people can't shut down their lives forever."
12457,"&gt;Why could she not have given it to Barr

12467,you never need to use condoms if you take pregnancy tests all the time too
12468,They don't work and don't tell me what to do.
12469,I forget the name of the one I got.
12470,But it was like 49 dollars and has a hot water attachment too.
12471,Just Google and look at reviews.
12472,For the price I wouldn't worry about if one needs to be replaced.
12473,And if bought on Amazon can probably get a warranty for an extra 10 bucks for 3 years or so I'm sure.
12474,You are assuming that each event is independent.
12475,Perhaps there is a specific condition that makes the subject a false negative that persists between tests.
12476,"What is the prevalence of these long-term complications, and more importantly, *how do they compare* to other respiratory illnesses like the flu?"
12477,"Because the current antibody studies show that literally hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been infected, and tens of millions in the USA."
12478,And we aren't getting reports of millions of people with long-term complications.
12479,Just go to the funeral.

12482,"OK, but that's totally a joke SNL would write."
12483,"The government was telling people to go to pubs, restaurants, gyms, back on public transport, back into the office and to go on holidays etc."
12484,The general public just did what the government stupidly told them to do.
12485,"Most of Australia has been back to normal for quite some time, the only exception is Victoria."
12486,Community transmission is almost non existent.
12487,That’s one I will use in the future.
12488,The physicians on various news programs who were commenting on the various treatments that Donald Trump had been receiving indicated that his condition was more serious than had been made public.
12489,"Then, when one of the Doctors at Walter Reed said that DJT was up and walking around and could probably leave tomorrow I thought that the President was bored and restless."
12490,Within the past hour the President was in a motorcade which left the hospital circled around and returned him to it.
12491,"I can only imagine it wasn't something the physicians would have approved which leads me to think that they have no real control over him and by implication, his condition."
12492,The only way they could have kept him was to state that he was a threat to himself or others if he left.
12493,They are in a difficult position with an unusually difficult (and probably noncompliant) patient.
12494,&gt; It hasn't even been very cold...not cold enough to cause masses of people to be forced indoors.
12495,There is another cause for the spike.
12496,[removed]
12497,What?
12498,What people are leaving the state?
12499,California has a very high population.
12500,"There is a debate about shutdowns, contact tracing, and masks among medical professionals because saying that one single strategy is unquestionable isn’t good science."
12501,"I am very concerned, I’ve been checking for these results all day."
12502,They're doing their best to make it look like it's a mild case.
12503,“Maintaining a healthy lifestyle including sex does not does not seem unfathomable as long as you take the right precautions.
12504,"As Dr. Wood states, the key is constant communication with your sex partner and taking the appropriate measures to protect yourself.”"
12505,No they have the kids cine in every day in two cohorts.
12506,One in the morning and one after noon.
12507,Neither group eats at school

Sometimes things get better before they get worse, and then they get better again, unless of course you die in which things stop getting better or worse, for you at least."

12511,Don't trust him as far as I could throw him.
12512,It hasn't even been very cold...not cold enough to cause masses of people to be forced indoors.
12513,Quit your BS.
12514,There is something else causing the recent spikes...probably schools but who knows.

12523,2.
12524,"There’s a death ☠️ in the family or closest circuit, things won’t change."
12525,"Even after 200,000 plus deaths, things are not changing much, it only means that until it hits home hard."
12526,Real hard.
12527,Death.
12528,Things won’t change.
12529,"Many people who get it, they recover because they build immunity and they move on."
12530,What they don’t realize is that each body responds differently.
12531,There could be lasting impact from any symptom.
12532,People listen to science only when it want to suit their interests.
12533,For example: they will call it a hoax but then they’ll also endanger children because some science said kids don’t fall ill easily with this virus.
12534,🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
12535,"They suspect it has a variety of side effects, both cognitive and physical."
12536,"It can cause patients given it to develop sociopathic tendencies, complex delusions, egocentric behavior, and in some cases they become sexually aggressive or misogynistic."
12537,It can also turn the skin extremely pale which must sometimes be covered with makeup or clothing.
12538,"There are some reports that it causes skeletal degeneration, which can affect a patient's posture and walking gait."
12539,"It can even cause permanent aphasia, where a patient will speak or type gibberish instead of normal words."
12540,I can't imagine how bad his condition must be that doctors aren't worried about these side effects.
12541,Because blaming someone who got sick after millions of Americans have gotten sick is a poorly thought out move one month before an election.
12542,"Lots of those people, including many of the hundreds of thousands who died, got sick through *other people's* negligence or callousness, or because they had to keep risking exposure in order to pay rent and put food on the table, etc..."
12543,"The Dems have a serious problem when it comes to matters of economic populism, and part of the reason America has been hit so hard by the pandemic is because of deep structural economic problems that make it difficult for the poor to take the kinds of precautions that would allow them to mitigate exposure more successfully."
12544,"The D-party is full of idiots, granted, but there's surely someone high up enough who can realize that that would be horrible messaging right now."
12545,You are most infectious *before* you start showing symptoms.
12546,Cos it sounds gay and people are afraid of things that go up their ass.
12547,&gt; Some schools have a hybrid model that sends them all home at lunch.
12548,God that sounds like a logistical nightmare.
12549,Is that just for students that can transport themselves or do they bus the entire campuses home and back in the middle of the day?
12550,That would demand extra hours for bus drivers who are largely part-time (at least in my district) and commonly hold second or third jobs outside of their driving hours.

12552,What evidence do  you have to controvert it?
12553,Doubtful lol
12554,Those ancestors did not have the knowledge or resources to quickly address the problems they faced.
12555,We know how to address this present problem from the lessons learned fighting spanish flu and another 100 years worth of epidemiology study.
12556,"Yet people want to pretend there is some sort of debate about shutdowns, contact tracing and masks."
12557,They resist facts out of selfishness and willful ignorance and then complain about being oppressed.
12558,Care to elaborate on the reported recent spike in NYC?
12559,Is it a serious spike or something else?

12568,"Since it coincides with things like opening back up indoor dining and movie theaters, cases will probably start to go up again."
12569,"I think the new system seems decent, but they can open up far too much in the red tier."
12570,True story.
12571,Two weeks ago went to the local Walmart which had only one entrance open for screening motherfuckers with a mask and such.
12572,Guy and girl in their mid 20s were ahead of me (I was in a mask of course) entering.
12573,The Walmart chick stops them because they didn't have a mask.
12574,Walmart chick: you are required to have a mask to enter.
12575,Douchebag guy: we are outta town from Florida and didn't bring them with us.
12576,we are just getting like one thing so we will be in and out.
12577,Walmart chick.
12578,""".......um....ok....go on in""

I later wrote a complaint email to that store's area manager but heard nothing back."
12579,Bwah!
12580,The health officials said that the virus would probably never come to Denmark.
12581,It was going badly in Italy **but** the danish winter vacation was right around the corner and danish people *love* going to italy at that time of the year.
12582,It just now became mandatory for ambulance staff to wear masks.
12583,"Until now, people taking swabs for sars2 testing, didn't wear them."
12584,"My impression is that our government actually did take it quite seriously at first but then the business interests seemed to kinda steamrolled them with ""how important it was for money to live on"" and everything degenerated into pouring out money from the treasury."

12598,Agreed.
12599,I would have preferred the lack of dramatisation.
12600,I hope that storytelling aspect reaches new people that couldn’t see the connections before and are able to see them now.
12601,I got the most from the individual perspectives on what tech is ‘doing’ and what the ‘threat’ actually is.
12602,Could.
12603,Then we'd all be dead.
12604,I don’t get what this headline is trying to say.
12605,Is it saying that they’d test all the time so that when they all would test negative they could take off their masks?
12606,"And if so, what’s the issue if nobody has it?"
12607,You can’t spread what you don’t have.

12614,"So since our institutions no longer work -- because of Trump, by the way -- we'll take the next best method to get rid of him, whatever that is, and we'll cheer it as if it saved our lives, because for a lot of us, that's literally true."

12634,Wtf is this BS?
12635,I work in comms and PR and its just a hedging phrase that you'd use to cover yourself.
12636,You can't speak in absolutes even if you're 100% certain about something because absolute statements are legal kryptonite if anything goes wrong.
12637,"You'd say ""isn't necessarily true"" in case you've unintentionally left something out."
12638,Edit: This isn't me defending it but I would hope that even Trump's doctors have some integrity and are trying to act as professionally as possible given the circumstances.
12639,That might be too much to ask.

12641,Agree
12642,So me being alive today is pathetic.
12643,OK.
12644,Sure.
12645,&gt; Because he has been given a therapeautic and a treatment that are helping his body fight this.
12646,I highly doubt at this point he wont recover.
12647,Remember those days when eXpErTs predicted 250 deaths at the peak.

12652,"So Trump and Christie -- who for seven months said coronavirus is no big deal -- both CHECKED INTO THE HOSPITAL when they got Covid, despite having only mild symptoms according to them."
12653,How does that make any sense?
12654,Why go to the hospital for a disease you say is no worse than a cold or flu when you have mild symptoms?
12655,What absolute frauds and hypocrites.
12656,Two big bullies who are just little wussies allergic to the truth.
12657,"I don't know who downvoted you, but few of my friends who don't believe in covid actually hold degree in literature."
12658,So you are anecdotally correct.

12670,I’m no expert but here’s my understanding.
12671,"Of the variety of tests out there, each is sacrificing accuracy for something else—e.g., time, cost, intrusiveness, whatever—for very practical reasons."
12672,"A perfect test that doesn’t produce false positives or negatives is practically useless if it takes three years to get results, costs $1 million, or requires a biopsy."
12673,"Thus, every practical test has blind spots."
12674,"Take a certain individual, then, whose unique genetic profile places them squarely in a given test’s blind spot."
12675,"It’s unlikely, given the test’s specific methodology (or constraints), that administering the same test over and over again will produce a different result."
12676,"In other words, whoever designed a test can confidently and accurately say that 2% of its positive results are negative in actuality, but the test itself is unable to confirm it gave you, the individual, an inaccurate result."
12677,"If it could, the test simply wouldn’t bother giving you the initial inaccurate result."
12678,"Of course, though, unless a test is constantly being tweaked by its creators, increasing its accuracy rate on its own doesn’t make sense, so individuals falling in a static test’s blind spot probably always will fall there."

12692,"I have some concerns about whatever Trump meant when he said he’s learned a lot about COVID, because he’s now gone to school (Walter Reed) and not from reading books."
12693,"Seems to be a quip about “street smarts versus book smarts?”

The implication is not entirely clear, but either he’s going to double down on downplaying the pandemic, or he might actually come out and say that it’s a serious illness not to be taken lightly."
12694,"I’m suspicious it will be the former rather than the latter, since every motivation is to win the election—suddenly coming out that COVID is very dangerous and we need to exercise caution would not be popular with his base."
12695,"We’re entering a dangerous moment, especially with winter around the corner, where I feel the next things he says and does could influence whether or not we lose tens of thousands more to this pandemic."
12696,"This place is loaded with stories of fear, anxiety, and dire predictions."

12710,"&gt; The old normal is gone

I understand that the point of such sobering statements as these is to discourage people from prematurely reverting to pre-pandemic lifestyles at the cost of the safety of others, but don't you think wording them like this might actually be counterproductive?"
12711,"Like, I am aware that this has never been an explicit policy anywhere, but I think a *lot* of people are in this mindset of ""sacrifice normalcy now so that we can safely return to normal later""; that is, they are treating old normal as some sort of ""reward"" for patience and obedience when the vaccine arrives, and lockdowns and closures are no longer necessary."
12712,"To this end, if the interference to everyone's daily life ends up persisting beyond a vaccine, or ""permanently"", people are going to lose hope, and wonder something along the lines of ""if we really can't return to normal like these experts are saying, then what *is* the point of these guidelines?"""
12713,"And many of them, I can guarantee this, will forego the restrictions altogether, therefore causing the ""no return to old normal"" statements to have the exact opposite effect on compliance."
12714,"That being said, I wonder if these sort of statements have any historical basis in previous pandemics, or really in any catastrophe in history, be it war, natural disaster, or famine."
12715,"It seems to me that those news articles with messages of ""no return to old normal"" tend to use ""we adapted society following these wars"" as justification for their points, but exactly how reality-based is this sort of argument?"
12716,"Well, technically there is 21% oxygen in the air."

12920,"Nobody says it's a miracle cure, but if it helps your chances by several percent, that's reason enough to take it."
12921,Some decades ago there was a huge and protracted legal battle by the tobacco industry about whether smoking causes cancer.

13169,It's all hindsight.
13170,844 points for completely glazing over the problem that gaining cloture in the Senate poses.
13171,And this is probably from a bunch of people who consider themselves educated on politics.
13172,It’s not a problem that can be solved by shooting it with guns.

13177,They're radicalizing against each other.
13178,I mean this is the big inequity of the moment.
13179,Trump and his ilk will likely be fine because they have rapid tests and can be given antiviral cocktails immediately.
13180,The NFL has these kits too.
13181,It’s absurd that the rich and the powerful can just do rapid testing while the rest of us wait DAYS for results.
13182,I hate how true this is.

13187,Apparently a lot of people don't understand (or just don't care) what asymptomatic means.
13188,Yeah I get they’ll try anything.
13189,But the fact that dexamethasone has only been found useful for severe patients who need help breathing is what is worrisome.

13211,"To me, there are two possibilities."
13212,1.
13213,"He got a false positive because the test failed

2."
13214,He got a positive because he has COVID but it's still early days of infection so there is a possibility of him getting a positive or negative result as the virus is still incubating.
13215,Is #2 not a possibility?
13216,Because it sounds like they are going ahead with the game stating false positive and he 100% has not been infected.

13414,"So yeah yeah yeah It's not just a little flu, but on the other hand in the big picture of things it's probably nowhere near as bad as the flu because how the flu constantly forms new strains that invalidate our vaccines and our immunity and gives the flu the potential to significantly become far more lethal and to do so very rapidly."

The number of deaths is much lower now because doctors are much better at treating the disease."

13512,It is a well known factor of any emerging disease that as time passes treatments become better and the survival rate increases.
13513,"For that reason alone, delaying infection as long as possible will always result in lower death tolls."

13544,With enough money they can.

13549,I've had traffic free commutes for months now but now I'm seeing red where I used to before the pandemic.
13550,So you're saying why test at all?
13551,Someone who knows they have covid can tell the people they came into contact with so they can get tested and spread it less by altering their behavior.
13552,Pregnancy isn't contagious.
13553,"They could still potentially spread it if they’re going out into public, and got virus particles on their body and then touch and contaminate other surfaces."

13612,"Once they get the sample, it’s logged in the system."

&gt;The drug — a cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone — does seem to help patients in dire straits, the data suggest."
13760,"But it also may be risky for patients with milder illness, and the timing of the treatment is critical."
13761,"[...]
&gt;Dexamethasone was beneficial for those who had been sick for more than a week, reducing deaths by one-third among patients on mechanical ventilators and by one-fifth among patients receiving supplemental oxygen by other means."
13762,"[...]
&gt;Doctors have worried about using steroids such as dexamethasone to fight Covid-19, because steroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that dampen the body’s protective immune response."
13763,"In mildly ill patients, that may do more harm than good, Dr. Landray said."
13764,"&gt;“In the early phase of the illness, the immune system is your friend,” Dr. Landray said."
13765,"“It’s fighting the virus, and dampening it is not a good idea.”"
13766,Agreed.
13767,The government should have recognized this contrary attitude early in the pandemic.

13774,The true rate should be a bit higher as there are non-respiratory deaths (eg multiple Organ failure or myocarditis).
13775,"Also, most sources still support ~0.1% (using excess deaths)."
13776,So I’m happy to agree that it’s somewhere in the 0.05-0.1% range.
13777,Let’s see how the estimates for Covid develop.
13778,"Citing Fauci here:

“If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%."
13779,"This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.”

14051,even the system designed around face masks are being compromised as it turned out that people who thought we could deal with them were wrong.
14052,they underestimated the amount of technology needed to overcome face masks.

14181,"Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and all things being equal, it has to do with individual liberties and the role of government in the individuals life."
14182,"People on the far right, don't want the government telling them what to do concerning their own person."
14183,They consider a mask mandate as interfering with their individual freedoms.
14184,The US seems to be unique in that this culture has fostered here since the beginning.
14185,My take I could be wrong
14186,&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday that he intended to “rewind” the reopening in nine neighborhoods in New York City that have had a testing positivity rate of more than 3 percent over the last seven days.
14187,"&gt;That means the closure of nonessential businesses, public and private schools and day care centers in those neighborhoods, which are in Brooklyn and Queens."
14188,"Many of them have large populations of Orthodox Jews, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in those communities in recent weeks."
14189,&gt;The mayor said he would also put lesser restrictions on 11 other neighborhoods where the rates are rising.
14190,"&gt;In total, the mayor’s plan would affect only 20 of the 146 ZIP codes in the city."
14191,"Still, the move reflects the growing fear of a second wave of the virus, and marks the first major reversal in the city’s reopening since it was hit hard by the outbreak in March."
14192,"&gt; Ireland there's ~95% compliance 

Do you actually have a source for that, especially in an indoor setting like classrooms or restaurants?"
14193,Are mask recommendations followed with actual social distancing guidelines?
14194,"Ah, it’s just that you said “she had a 95 day stretch where she didn’t leave the house at all,” so I assumed she hadn’t left the house at all."
14195,Sounds like you’ve been similar to us then.
14196,The only people we’ve seen consistently are my girlfriends immediate family and even then it’s always outdoors/distances.
14197,Southern California here.
14198,This.
14199,This was published 4 days ago.
14200,"As of this afternoon, the city is moving to close schools and non essential businesses in these 9 zip codes until the 7 days positive rate is back below 3%."
14201,Closures would take effect October 7th.
14202,its like the problem with the masks.
14203,know why everyone's wearing cloth?
14204,why there are still ppe shortages in hospitals and testing facilities?
14205,Because the government won't guarantee long term funding for these things to the companies that can do it.
14206,"could they spin up and make short term profits, yeah."
14207,but when covid isn't a problem.anymore they have expensive machines and staff that no longer produce money.
14208,the gov won't help them get contracts moving forward to make the investment worth it.
14209,its nothing new and novel.
14210,the added capacity in the market drives the cost below anything profitable due to huge oversupply.
14211,with the testing they could convert pregnancy test factories to making spit on the stick covid tests but what happens when its over.
14212,what if the vaccine comes out in 6 months and test needs plummet?
14213,from a business perspective I've shot myself in the foot.

14215,so I want money from the government I can use to focus on researching.
14216,"maybe if I don't design the test of the future that I can patent, I at least wind up with a few other ideas and patents along the way."
14217,"If I do hit my target then I get free production capacity and guaranteed purchases of my new product, which I will leverage to make other new products for years to come."
14218,"sadly, with this administration and the businesses none of it has been about saving people."

14430,"However, county health departments have the power to give out their own orders, so maybe all hope is not lost"
14431,He's a fool if he thinks that'll happen again.
14432,Crack a remedial science book
14433,"Agreed, definitely don’t want to find out."
14434,Thanks for the help!
14435,If you pay my rent and expenses i will.
14436,Mental gymnastics lets people believe dumb shit to preserve their image of reality.
14437,We have a Vice President for in case he dies.
14438,If the president is ill and in the hospital it is the vice president’s duty to step up.
14439,"Even with great healthcare, a president in the hospital is a liability to national security."
14440,What national security event are you concerned about?
14441,How is Trump’s presidency not a threat to national security?
14442,What health are we ensuring?
14443,How long should a president’s hospitalization be allowed to continue before we move to succession?
14444,You can say we need to ensure the president’s health but how do you define health?
14445,How do you know when the president’s health is a threat to national security?
14446,Nope.
14447,I'm right on both accounts.
14448,There was going to be a drug test if Team Biden agreed.
14449,"You just lied again, as Trump said he would be drug tested as well."
14450,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYJBHn_PuU

See?"
14451,Here's him saying it live.
14452,You just lied.
14453,&gt;Anyone giving anyone a question ahead of time would not have been caught by either of these methods.
14454,Obviously.
14455,"We all know Biden has the questions ahead of time as well, but he would need radio help aksi, 

&gt;Also, drugs that would give a significant advantage at a debate basically don't exist 

Another lie."
14456,You're bad at this.
14457,"I agree that we may see some changes in the way we do things as a result, but for the most part things will go back to normal eventually."
14458,"Where we’re at now shouldn’t be considered “the new normal”, but a slightly different new normal is likely coming once we’re done with this stuff."
14459,Maybe that means masks during flu season are more common.
14460,Maybe that means some businesses offering more work from home opportunities.
14461,"Any number of things may change slightly, but the idea that we’ll never go back to “normal” is wrong."
14462,People want normal.
14463,People want to be able to attend sporting events and other large events.
14464,People want to be able to hang out in bars and restaurants with friends.
14465,"Well, this isn’t r/Covid19 so I’m pretty sure you can post without worry of ban."
14466,True.
14467,"You should use the European version of reddit, instead."
14468,You can’t possibly believe this is true.
14469,Damn looks like somebody is mad as fuck online
14470,Europe is currently getting fucked hard but deaths are still surprisingly low I  these last two months.
14471,"I understand treatment is getting better and the people affected are younger, but still...

 (I’m European, no need to tell me that another country that I don’t come from is worse off)"
14472,Yes.
14473,Deciding not to eat meat is a good thing.
14474,I respect that.
14475,Calling people who do eat meat terrible people and murderers is being an asshole.
14476,Lol at the staged photo of trump working that was taken 10 minutes after his video message and had his signing the middle of a blank piece of paper.
14477,This is North Korea shit.

14479,They misused stormy too!
14480,Trump fucked around and “found out”.

14485,"If we hit another lockdown, at least I’ll be one less body to feel you have to avoid in a store."
14486,Wouldn't the actual number be even higher?
14487,In India we are seeing the 30 to 40% of people who tested positive losing antibodies.
14488,Hopefully hospitals will turn away the sick and tell them to return to bars and restaurants.
14489,Doing business is the only thing that fights Covid.
14490,I CAN DREAM HAROLD
14491,I'll just leave that one as is

14504,"I don’t get the people who need to be in large groups period, too many people annoy me anyway lmao"
14505,Well it’s less now -9.
14506,I got the idea that it is part mob mentality.
14507,"Yes, but you're assuming a level of benevolent long-term foresight which doesn't really exist amongst the right wing anymore."
14508,"This is visors, not visitors."
14509,It’s a flunky MD.
14510,The only people that have a DO degree (osteopathic) are people who failed to get into MD (allopathic) medical schools.
14511,What a surprise...
14512,I wonder what this means: will none of our executive orders be in effect anymore?
14513,"Ya, I can see that but the the longer the fires go (was a lot better but now pretty bad again for my area), the more I am certain people are meeting up inside."
14514,"Maybe smaller groups then outside events, but the desires that filled up parks &amp; backyard meetups didn’t stop just because outside became awful."
14515,California’s best season (for the major metros) is going to be late fall when hanging out in the backyard isn’t super smoky or hot.
14516,"Either Trump's illness is all totally fake or its Soviet style ""Andropov has a cold"" shenanigans."
14517,You have no information to substantiate that.
14518,How physician was completely open about the fact that he tested positive on Thursday.
14519,"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-54382914

14520,"Morbidly obese, his FUPA is fucking HUGE"
14521,He apparently got both forms of treatments.
14522,"and now they're getting busted a month before the election, in public, nationally embarrassed."
14523,It's poetic.
14524,I like the tweet that compared it to Edgar Aileen Poe’s “The Masque of the Red Death” makes it kinda festive
14525,"Wow, look at those morons not social distancing and not wearing masks."
14526,"The reason it says ""flu and pneumonia"" is because pneumonia is a very common result of the flu."
14527,If you were such an expert you'd know this.
14528,The flu is literally on par with what it normally is for the majority of the year.
14529,"Funnily enough as lockdown restrictions eased, the flu seems to go down, which again if they are so necessary I find very odd."
14530,"I'm not saying it's ""okay"" for it to be on par with the flu, I'm saying we don't lock the country down over something that for months has been killing more people than COVID, yet here we are."
14531,"There's also the fact that a lot of deaths from ""COVID"" are actually from other things."
14532,In my country if you test positive for COVID and die of ANY CAUSE within a 28 period (sometimes more from what I've heard) you are added to the COVID death statistics.
14533,"They actually removed 5000 deaths from the coint because of this but they are still counting deaths like this way anyway, so I feel like that was done merely to appease people who were pointing it out, I wouldn't be surprised if far more people who died of ""COVID"" died of something else."
14534,And flu deaths were slightly lower prior to COVID when no measures were being taken.
14535,"If lockdowns and the like worked so well and are so worth the cost, why have flu deaths been basically unaffected to the point where flu is now killing more people in this country than COVID?"
14536,"The flu season has gone on like it was going on before measures were taken, so they really can't be that effective at all."
14537,You have a medical degree?
14538,Praise his name
14539,There's already a vaccine.
14540,More than one.
14541,You can sign up for clinical trials today.
14542,Pretty sure this is fake news.
14543,"Cases and hospitalizations are growing across the country, mainly due to republican incompetence and evil."
14544,Why’d they even test
14545,i'm curious.
14546,how do those opposed to masks and social distancing here in the united states explain how these other countries are pulling this off?
14547,are they just convinced that the media is lying about the deaths or that these other countries have some kind of secret  protection that we don't know about?

14560,"Thought your first response was /s

Clearly it was just broken English"
14561,I think that's been well established.
14562,What's concerning is the percent of people that don't develop a strong neutralizing antibody response.
14563,Studies in hospitalized patients show it's somewhere between 5-7% that don't develop detectable levels of neutralizing abs during the course of their disease.
14564,"For somebody like this patient, they have waning titers, but still have immunity."
14565,That's not uncommon for numerous other viruses.
14566,What is uncommon though is to never have detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies.
14567,"I was quoting the worldwide mortality rate from this website:

14568,These GOP politicians are quite literally digging their own graves with this unwillingness to protect public health bc of this virus.

14571,Exactly.
14572,"Badly done, too."
14573,It would have been better to reshoot but that was probably out of the question.
14574,"Im no great fan of the Chinese people who support the CCP either, so its not really that simple."
14575,That is more complicated though because you have to take into account propaganda and how aware these people are.

14601,Fires are helping maybe?
14602,"More people staying home, and wearing masks while outside?"
14603,Until there's a vaccine.
14604,Wearing a mask is a minor inconvenience just the same as having to wear pants shirts and shoes in public.
14605,Oh I absolutely agree (although am curious if the name joe was chosen intentionally lol).
14606,It's why the military increased it's presence.
14607,This is a major constitutional powers situation because he is ultimately responsible for the entire military approval and a crisis would require his input

14638,Its **literally** less than one in a million.

14678,Many recover without being hospitalized
14679,Ur one of those anyone who acknowledges the actual reality of the situation is d’mer type of person aren’t u. Idk how u spend so much time commenting how the virus threat is blown out of proportion.
14680,When you just want an excuse for ur life style that includes making the situation actively worse.
14681,Then they’ll blame others
14682,You're welcome to wear a mask forever if you want.
14683,No one is stopping you.
14684,Hmm...
14685,I'm not sure if they're bots but I've seen some people on Twitter say that Democrats/Satanists sprayed Trump with the virus.
14686,"They may feel like it was a direct attack vs. a stupid, arrogant man catching a virus during a pandemic due to having no sense of personal responsibility."
14687,Solidarity.
14688,I'm in Michigan too and said the same thing when I saw the verdict.
14689,[removed]
14690,"That might all be true, not something I'm defending."
14691,"Even if the person I replied to doesn't like Trump, he is still the President of the USA and anything he says or does has a massive impact globally."
14692,His death would be no exception.
14693,"Because of that, and like every world leader, he will receive better medical than your average Joe."
14694,Allowing weeks of community transmission prior to acknowledging that they needed to act was downplaying it.
14695,So was allowing large events to take place in the weeks leading up to the lockdown.
14696,So was Boris Johnson's photo op where he claimed to have shaken hands with people in hospital-and his statement about not wearing gloves while doing it.
14697,So was the timing of lifting the restrictions-only England got rid of as many of them so quickly.
14698,Every other parliament in the uk kept them in place for longer and eased them in stages.
14699,So was the eat out to help out scheme.
14700,"Have you forgotten when he told us all that we were all going to lose some loved ones, but it was really just a bad case of the flu that we all had to take on the chin?"
14701,Have you forgotten how he described lockdowns in other countries as 'draconian'?
14702,"The fact that we got a lockdown (too late, and lifted too early."
14703,An earlier lockdown could have prevented thousands of deaths) doesn't change the fact that he was downplaying it.
14704,The fact that you believe otherwise is a testament to  the manipulation we've all been subjected to.
14705,[removed]
14706,No worries.
14707,Do you have symptoms?
14708,What made you go get tested?
14709,"And I ended up being right, since T’s literally released a video showing he’s fine with no symptoms and feeling much better."
14710,What surprises me is Florida is removing Covid restrictions to win election votes.
14711,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html
14712,Any info on what type of schools?
14713,"(College, high school, etc)?"
14714,"Old adults, meaning those aged 65 and older, as well as people, regardless of age who have severe medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and many other illnesses, are also at risk for complications and/or death from the Covid-19 virus, and should also have first crack at the Covid-19 vaccine if and when it comes out."
14715,Requiring the a ventilator is an inconvenience to doctors they have rights too...
14716,Lost my dad in June to this.
14717,Nasty way to watch a loved one go.
14718,I’m so sorry.
14719,My mom keeps saying “if I’m not laughing I’m crying”.
14720,There’s been no change- even people who we tell it to double down on “well it’s just the flu so he clearly had more going on”.
14721,Regardless- didn’t my dads life matter at all?
14722,That seems like a reasonable assumption but to the degree of significance we don't really know.
14723,Given the statistics we have already had for many months it seems like a risk worth taking as opposed to all of the damage caused by lockdowns.
14724,"Basically, I think retaining the fundamental structure of society and allowing children to have a normal upbringing is a lot more important than preserving the lives of people who statistically only had a decade of life remaining regardless."

14730,RCTs aren't overrated.
14731,"Parachute trials are essentially that this therapuetic group is so promising that we will incorporate it to become the standard treatment, and the placebo group will get the therapeutic otherwise it would be amoral for them not to because of significant mortality."
14732,"&amp;#x200B;

Vitamin D has nothing to back it evidence wise."
14733,"There was a small and controversial RCT that had many fundamental flaws, but otherwise there's nothing seriously there."
14734,"That isn't to say Vitamin D isn't good for you or that you should stop taking it, because please keep taking it; it's probably not a miracle cure, though."
14735,The video is edited and pieced together.
14736,You can see the beginning or end of coughing spells a few times and he has conversational dyspena for sure.
14737,I wouldn’t doubt it if he also has Dyspena on exertion too
14738,It’s interesting how it has become widely accepted that the incubation period is “up to 14 days”.
14739,Based on my observations it seems that time period was a bit optimistic from the early days of transmission.
14740,"Back in February when some of the cruise ships were being quarantined outside of major ports for 14 days, there were a few cases reported where a patient became ill after departing the ship at the end of their quarantine period."
14741,"Also, some repatriated citizens were brought to Travis AFB near Fairfield, CA."
14742,There was also a case there which did not demonstrate symptoms until after the 14 day period.
14743,"I understand that the quarantines were a hardship for those impacted, yet I still believe that had they initially enforced a more conservative 21 day quarantine period, much of the community transmission may have been avoided."
14744,Although travelers from heavily infected Europe were walking off airplanes at JFK on a daily basis without even being questioned...so who knows???
14745,Too many foolish people making very bad choices has resulted in tragedy!
14746,"Yet unbelievably, even with the latest news from the White House, the anti-maskers STILL insist masks are useless!"
14747,It’s true - there is no cure for STUPID!
14748,WHAT IS THIS TRUE????
14749,what am I going to do with my 1000's of space force hats?
14750,?..
14751,So we're in agreement that most people who encounter the virus again will have a degree of immunity and in most cases it will be a lesser disease?
14752,We know now that Trump had supplemental oxygen on Friday.
14753,I wish he'd just be honest about these things.
14754,"There's a section of society in America, most of which support Donald Trump, that is being lied to and told that this virus isn't serious."
14755,Some of them are in this thread.
14756,Yet there was the President of the United States himself on Friday requiring supplemental oxygen to keep him alive because of it.
14757,The Prime Minister of my country himself was in intensive care with this thing and he's only 56.
14758,There's nothing normal about this.
14759,Do you think things will ever return to “normal”?
14760,The US has plenty of people like her.
14761,You've already got AoC.
14762,Just keep voting fo people like her and you too can have a not shit political environment
14763,I think it's okay to name and blame the Hasidic community.
14764,&gt;If anything shows the folly of relying on frequent testing like they're perfect it was this past week.
14765,Good for her!
14766,Mandatory quarantine can't be replaced by testing.
14767,Bubble is fragile and quarantine can make it stronger.
14768,I think Jordan took his job as scout team quarterback a bit too seriously.
14769,This was not what Andy Reid had in mind when he said “emulate Cam Newton”
14770,you seem to understand this number as if it's static at this point.
14771,It's not.
14772,This is a novel virus and we are still collecting a lot of data.
14773,"Until you've got some studies to back up what you're saying, you're the one making assumptions here."
14774,I don't fuck around with my health.
14775,Especially with a brand-new-never-before-seen virus that's doing all sorts of stuff to people that also spreads like wildfire.
14776,"If it turns out you're right, THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME."
14777,You shouldn't recommend people throw their health out the window on ANY chance though.
14778,The virus is still ripping through our cities and debilitating people.
14779,"knocking them out for all sorts of lengths of time, and you don't know what your dice roll is until you get it."
14780,and you can do things to avoid not getting it.

14791,Yes.
14792,Is reinfection possible?
14793,Yes.
14794,"Is reinfection hard to prove, leaving open the door for a large number of missed cases?"
14795,Yes.
14796,Are there anecdotes of a large number of missed cases?
14797,Yes.
14798,"So, basically, can we demonstrate through challenge trials in a controlled experiment that *most* people previously exposed to COVID are now immune after three months?"
14799,That hasn't happened yet.
14800,"Given the evidence, we have to falsify the idea that reinfection is widely possible."
14801,"We haven't done the study to falsify it, so we have to conclude that reinfection is likely very common."
14802,Looks like Vietnam beat the US yet again.

14812,"&gt;It was already lower prior to lockdowns, then it sometimes continues slightly below (as it was going that way anyway)

Huge error in logic and science."
14813,Just because it was lower at the start of the year you cannot know it was going to be lower even without lockdowns.
14814,The fact it's only barely lower with lockdowns actually suggests it would've been much higher without lockdowns.
14815,&gt;Even the dotted line displaying the average flu deaths reflects this.
14816,See above.
14817,"Now I'm not from the uk so idk everything they did, but I don't actually recall there ever being a lockdown there where people were trying to force everyone to stay in their homes."
14818,This isn't what I want nor is that what anyone is suggesting.
14819,We just want people to not be eating in restaurants and to stop going to church without masks.
14820,"I get it, you and all the other little weakling like yourself think ""oh no I can't eat fries out of my friends mouth!"
14821,"Anything less just isn't socializing and now in gonna dieeeee""."
14822,But that's not actually how any of this works.

14833,....same with Florida.
14834,Masks help prevent infection spread.
14835,Nobody really knows why their fatality rate is so low despite their aging population.
14836,Unless all the old folks who have it are choosing to die alone at home instead of getting tested and treated.
14837,Japan is kinda like that.
14838,The older folks  have a lot of pride and don't want to be a burden to others.
14839,Their excess death rate during this period is kinda high.
14840,This.
14841,"In a few days they’ll all be “better”, making the disease look not that bad and making trump look strong for surviving it."

14844,"Paywall, so I can’t read the article."

14847,Kids grow up never attending school where they can play with kids?
14848,They never get to see a high school dance or a football game?
14849,No more weddings - only immediate family?
14850,"No more travel, no more theatre no more live music?"
14851,To those who say “they’re not saying it’s forever” - substitute “no more” with “not for another 5-10 years” and does the sentiment change?
14852,I don’t think so.
14853,"At some point, we have to fight the beast head on, and there will be lives lost."
14854,Right now we don’t have the protection to do so.
14855,A 50% or ‘weak’ vaccine?
14856,I think that’s enough to have *some* die - the most vulnerable - but not most.
14857,That’s a sacrifice we should all get behind at some point.
14858,EDIT: I’m basing this comment on what I assume the general idea of the article is : “we need to to to continue social distancing and wearing masks for years”.
14859,If it’s saying something completely different please let me know.

14872,And they couldn't be bothered to wear a mask.
14873,"Maybe, but I said similar."
14874,Similar is not the same.
14875,Where's the equivalent superspreader event with a bunch of people not wearing masks like where Trump and 3 Republican senators (and more) got it.
14876,Where's the equivalent of that?
14877,If that happened then it would be news.
14878,But it doesn't happen because they are not invested in denying reality and seemingly trying to get people killed like the administration seems to be.
14879,And Vietnam borders China.

14942,No one is trying to say that this is going to go on forever.
14943,It’s just that right now the choices available to us are either continued social distancing or a few hundred thousand more deaths that WILL happen if everyone goes back to normal.

15021,This is close but not quite right.
15022,I have not yet seen any studies that asked specifically about vaping.
15023,All the studies I'm familiar with focused on smoking.
15024,"Yes, they think it's the nicotine in the smoking that's produced in the effects-and therefore vaping should do the same thing, but the studies have only asked about smoking."
15025,"Having said that, smokers who get covid do tend to have more severe symptoms."
15026,"(The theory at this point is because because smokers tend to have more comorbidities such as heart disease, etc.)"
15027,But what's interesting is that smokers seem to be far less likely to get the disease to start with.
15028,Several studies came out of China initially showing this but they were mostly ignored (because no one trusted anything China was saying at that point).
15029,But the studies that got everyone's attentions was by our cdc and it was published April 3rd.
15030,"Just Google 'CDC', 'covid study' and 'april 3' and it will probably be the first entry."
15031,Click on it and then scroll down to table one.
15032,(I would link but I'm on mobile.)
15033,"The study included over 7,000 confirmed cases (not necessarily hospitalized, just confirmed)."
15034,14% of the American population smokes so they expected at least 14% of these patients to be smokers.
15035,The actual number - 1.3%.
15036,"Multiple studies have come out since then showing the same thing -; france, germany, Israel, New York city, etc have all found the same thing."
15037,I'm sure you've noticed that you haven't heard this on the news (because it doesn't fit the establishment's agenda).
15038,I'm also confident you've heard that smoking does lead to more severe symptoms.
15039,"As noted, this is true but it's not the whole story."
15040,"(In case you're interested, they think it's due to nicotine's known effects on the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, which affects the Ace 2 receptor sites in our lungs which is how covid it gets into our bodies.)"

15088,"We got rid of SARS, Ebola, Swine flu, etc., but now that it requires some effort on their part, ""it is what it is""?"
15089,I think the answer is education instead of leadership.

15138,"Taking your tag at face value, that is good to hear."
15139,Can you explain whether reinfection will be more likely as antibodies deplete over time?
15140,Would the number of antibodies vary from person to person based on their initial viral load?
15141,This is what I've been hearing and I know it's why boosters are required for some illnesses.

15144,The fun part of social distancing is you can walk it back pretty quickly if you stick to it and other preventative measures long enough to get community transmission under control.

15162,"It felt so odd telling my son, Don't go to school, don't get a job, don't hug your grandmother and smoke cigarettes, because he was already doing that."

15177,If you look at my post history I have been praising Taiwan's response since March.
15178,It is the best response in the world and a model for the next pandemic.
15179,Strangely it is not discussed or praised enough here in North America.

15190,He looks and sounds more like himself in this one as compared to the 18 second one yesterday.

15192,Pence wanted funerals for aborted embryos back when he was Governor of Indiana.
15193,Super religious doesn't cut it.

15202,You hear about it but from my experience dealing with Covid patients not really.
15203,They usually last around 2-4 weeks on average.
15204,It also depends on how sick they are and most that came to me were already close to intubation.
15205,I've seen reports of chief of the whitehouse Mark Meadows telling journalists today off the record that Trump's state is questionable and the next 48 hours are crucial and it isn't all that great as it was being displayed by the last press conference.
15206,So I wonder which is the truth ...
15207,"Don't blame me, I voted for Sanjaya."
15208,Anyone else struck by implicit ignorance by team Trump wearing masks AFTER people got diagnosed.
15209,"CV transmits whether a confirmed test was done or not, whether the carrier knows they have it or not, which is more than likely how they all got sick in the first place - and exactly why mask mandates are in place."
15210,"I mean if you're going to go with the whole ""no mask"" idea you might as well go all the way."

15254,"&gt;More than half of the hotspot ZIP codes are from Kings and Queens counties, which are located in New York City's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs."

15256,"&gt;Although the top 20 ZIP codes are home to 6.7% of the state's population, they represented 26% of Friday's new Covid-19 cases, Cuomo said."

15276,This is the ideal way to do it.
15277,I still don't see how this could be applied in this situation here or even really be of value at this point.

15279,All of these people were at the same event within a couple seating rows and their cases all popped at the same time.
15280,One of them had it and the rest got it in a matter of hours from that person so mutations would have to be occurring at a very fast rate to tell anything apart.

15376,Prison.

15397,Do you have proof that I what I am saying could possibly have happened could not possibly have happened?
15398,"Because if you don't, you are out of line for saying that my guess at one possibility is false is wrong, so lets see your proof of your claims."

15443,"90% of the world's population lives in the northern hemisphere, but many live in areas where 'winter' hardly deserves the name."

15448,The real issue is this would be true for the democratic party too.
15449,Both parties bases are too spread in thought for streamlined progress towards their ideologies.
15450,"As much as I personally would rather it be left  legislation being pushed, I can't see the democratic party doing much better."
15451,It's a current issue with our government.
15452,Yeah and they'll probably manhandle some members of the public due to be vaccinated who will unexpectedly suddenly stop breathing.
15453,Do you think the original lockdown took that into account enough?
15454,I've heard of plenty of people who don't.
15455,What about social distancing and mask mandates?
15456,And drowning doesn’t have a .6% IFR
15457,God I remember that.
15458,That was a whole 2 years ago it feels
15459,Easier said then done how do you know if you fall into that category or not some healthy people dont even know that they have a underlining illness
15460,Have the heating bill covered before going for mental stuff...
15461,I would be careful about doing that if I were him as it could backfire massively if he ends up getting Covid himself.
15462,"While it’s less likely because he’s distancing, wearing masks etc, he’s still travelling and meeting a lot of people so it’s still a risk."
15463,He would have a huge amount of egg on his face if he crowed over Trump being ill and then became ill himself.
15464,Much better to rise above it all.
15465,"I work at a restaurant, so I’ve spoken to hundreds of people on this subject and I can confidently say that a lock down will not be allowed to happen again without the military (edit:law enforcement ) getting involved."

15468,"So, if you are in a high risk category, please prepare to bunker down because everyone else will not and so it will make outings that much more risky for you."
15469,"I’ll also add that even though companies have to pay for sick time, there are still plenty of workers going to work sick and not getting tested bc sick pay doesn’t cover shit as far as tip jobs go and unemployment (at least in my state of CA) doesn’t compensate for sick days."
15470,It’s because scientists came out and said they’re important.
15471,The GOP is now anti science so they are against masks.
15472,"That order of magnitude, yes."

* No vaccin becomes available."
15475,This is fundamentally unpredictable.
15476,No successful vaccin to any coronavirus has ever been made for humans.
15477,I know some predict a vaccin to be available within 3 months.
15478,"However, the same was said three months ago."
15479,* No significant strides are made in the treatment of COVID-19.
15480,"Gradual improvements will be made, but significant improvements (reducing IFR from 0.8% to 0.1%) are increasingly unlikely."
15481,* We will not contain the virus (this one is obvious).
15482,"Given a global concerted effort, we could contain the virus within 3 weeks."
15483,* No significant mutations will occur in the virus.
15484,"This can go both ways, but in general the virus becomes less deadly in order to spread better."
15485,"However, it is unlikely the virus will mutate this way, as the 'spreading' part occurs long before the 'deadly' part."
15486,These events are currently unpredictable given our knowledge.
15487,"In my calculations, I assumed they would not occur, because it shows a stark warning on what will happen when the lackadaisical attitudes of our Western democratic governments are allowed to continue."

15522,Trump tweeted a mussolini quote during his 2016 campaign.
15523,"""Better to live a day as a lion than a lifetime as a sheep""

When pressed about his quote he said ""Chuck, it's OK to know it's Mussolini."
15524,"Look, Mussolini was Mussolini."
15525,"It's OK to — it's a very good quote, it's a very interesting quote, and I know it,” he said Sunday morning."
15526,“I saw it.
15527,I saw what — and I know who said it.
15528,But what difference does it make whether it's Mussolini or somebody else?
15529,It's certainly a very interesting quote.”
15530,It's a pretty terrible estimator without lots of other details.
15531,You're assuming that the population who would take a test is representative of the entire area which is obviously completely fault because most people who take a test feel like they have some reason to.
15532,"Even after Peak positivity rates in recent memory, it's pretty obvious that the positivity rate does not match the population that has a virus."
15533,As some evidence of that you can check Arizona which had over a 20% positivity rate for long enough that according to your logic everyone in the state would have caught it more than once
15534,That mother fucker better not die.
15535,Or is he faking his death?
15536,"No, that's wrong"
15537,"&gt;Still, you'd think numbers infected would go down SOME

Nope, the spread is happening among the general population which doesn't have access to the vaccine."
15538,"So far, only some number of healthcare workers and volunteers from phase 3 trials received this vaccine (there are also phase 3 trials for some foreign vaccines), but we're taking about several thousands people in a country of 145 millions (Moscow alone has over 12 million people, and that only the registered population)."
15539,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;maybe they should 'prove' it works at home first 

That is exactly what currently running phase 3 of the clinical trials is for."
15540,Literally what
15541,What the fööck he tries to explain by saying that they didn’t want information to steer the course of illness?!?
15542,"The course of the illness is not going to be effected by what doctors *say*

The virus could not care less even though that whole gang had been singing “oxygen WAS giveeeeen, oh yes indeeeeed”"

15552,I didn't edit it lol
15553,Most likely Trump has previous heart damage.
15554,And Hydroxychloroquine is proven to cause heart issues.

15599,"&gt;You can't lock down for 1.5 years

You are so right, we surely have to keep the overconsumption up and this ""plague"" cannot possibly require us to change our society because we are ourselves and we don't have to do anything but enjoy life."

15601,"Yeah, we know that coronas can use Antibody Dependent Enhancement and we don't know how much damage we will see from long term consequences but sweden just went ahead and let it spread anyway, because, why not?"

15676,"I completely get that I'm posting this in the wrong place and a whole lot of ignorant people will downvote it into oblivion thinking they're saving the world by wearing a mask, they're wrong."
15677,"Don't get me wrong, I wear a mask, it helps, but not much and people thinking it's more effective than it is actually causes more harm than good as it encourages them to take more risks than they should thinking they're safer than they are."
15678,Downvote all you like.
15679,"&gt;in Ireland there's ~95% compliance with masks 

I think there are activities exempt from mask wearing which kind of ruin the correlation - like eating and drinking in closed spaces."
15680,"Everybody things if that is allowed it is safe, and obvious is not."
15681,"If everybody is good in the street, shops and supermarkets, but then they go hang around in pubs and cafés eating and talking with friends next to strangers, I mean, it is not the mask wearing elsewhere which is going to make any difference, is it?"
15682,Oh I absolutely agree a lockdown would've been beneficial.
15683,"I don't think it would be because of doctor experience though, but because less people will get infected by the virus."
15684,"But yes, 8 times more is **a lot**."
15685,It allows for the confirmation of 8 times as many cases.
15686,"While the increase in number of confirmed cases will certainly not be linear with increased tests, the difference will still so big that the numbers can't really be compared."
15687,"As for the mortality, I doubt we were 5-10 times worse at saving patients back then."
15688,But you're free to prove me otherwise with a reliable source.
15689,"More testing leading to more confirmed cases is a fact, and so is less actual cases leading to less deaths."
15690,How many did Spain test a day for the two periods you mentioned
15691,[removed]
15692,"It sucks that a combination of closing restaurants, wearing masks and social distancing, especially in population dense locaions, is the only remedy for Covid-19."
15693,But it is now the irrefutable truth that they are.
15694,Compromise without condescension is the better path.
15695,"Victoria: ""under a strict lockdown for nearly three months."
15696,"Retail and restaurants operate only on take away or delivery orders only, while people can exercise or socialise outdoors for a maximum of two hours a day and must wear masks in public places."""

15703,The odds of getting 5 events in a row at 7% chance each equals (0.07)^5.
15704,That’s a 0.000168% chance.
15705,Which is 1.68 out of every million.
15706,A million people is a fraction of my State's population.....
15707,Serious question.

15724,We've known this since human beings discovered how a virus generally behaves.
15725,But to what end?
15726,To wait for a vaccine that now they are saying they still want lockdowns after?
15727,I'd rather risk death than stay locked down forever.
15728,Let people who want to hide forever hide and everyone else can live normally.
15729,That's correct.
15730,"There were huge gatherings out in public, but the police don't mess with the private ones inside homes or venues."

15737,Oh they do have a consistent ideology.
15738,It’s called racism.
15739,Do what you're comfortable with.
15740,"Don't let people, especially internet strangers, guilt or pressure you one way or the other."
15741,because the GOP is a pack of mouth-breathing idiots.
15742,"It's not even cold here with highs in the mid 90's, but new cases have gone up 5x in the past couple of weeks."
15743,"Test that look for RNA, like the standard PCR test and the Broad/MIT test that uses a technique called LAMP, is that they all involve exponential amplification of the RNA to the point where it can be detected."
15744,"The problem is that these amplification products are all highly abundant and highly stable, and if you accidentally open a tube, that amplification product can get everywhere and start throwing false positives like crazy, and once that happens, getting rid of the contaminant is very time-consuming."
15745,"You might recall several news stories talking about how this has happened in many testing centers and kit manufacturers, including the CDC itself."
15746,"The issue of amplification product contamination is why the FDA refuses to allow nucleic acid tests in point of care testing sites, like nurses offices and pharmacies, unless the test has a very specific way of addressing it."
15747,The problem with STOPCovid - the test in the article - is that it requires you to deliberately open a tube after amplification to put in a dipstick to read out the result.
15748,"This is a huge issue, and something they're still working to address."
15749,"Treatment protocol improvement other than special drugs will never be able to decrease death rate by so much, that’s why so many more new special drugs are being developed, now death rate is down by 70-80%, in Sweden, Belgium is probably down by way more than that,  places that were hard hit and open sees the biggest drop, no way treatment will make so much difference for death rate across regions."
15750,you need an education of how healthcare actually works.
15751,Also US has a far more fair pay scale compared to the rest of the world.
15752,"For highly demanded skill set like tech, healthcare are on average paid much higher than any other western countries."
15753,Jobs that anybody can do or less demanded skill set of course should never be pay so well.
15754,"Virus is here to stay forever, soon enough every country that hasn’t been hit hard yet will see the surge until they get herd immunity."
15755,"Had everything is open people would already get herd immunity few months ago, now it’s being delayed forever by conspiracy theorists who always want to shut down and delay inevitable, while more and more people lose their jobs and in financial ruin, starvation and homelessness, that population affected by shut down will be far higher than the maximum projected death rate of this virus, and people will get the virus anyway."
15756,What can you expect from a guy who thought nuking a hurricane is plausible...
15757,"Im no trump - tard but ima call it out if i see it, that Melania clip where she says, ""give me a f_ing break""."
15758,"If you listen to the full context her point was to say this was always a problem, it wasnt created by their administration."
15759,Factual or not idk but she wasnt intentionally disregarding them as your post implies.
15760,Here in Finland we have a recommendation to wear masks in public transport and in public indoor places.
15761,"Yet most of the (traceable) infections are coming from schools, workplaces, hobbies, restaurants and private gatherings where mask usage has not been this far recommended."
15762,So maybe they are targeting the wrong places.
15763,And although it's recommended the compliance is low.
15764,So how are we compensating those businesses that may need to close again?
15765,i expected it to get ugly later this year.
15766,we have Oct and it is already bad.
15767,winter will suck.

 Yeah, weird how letting more people die and the disease spread earlier to everyone that is more likely to engage in behaviour that puts them more at risks only leaves uninfected people who are more likely to avoid getting infected better (which would also happen either way if the disease can't be contained at some point)."

15841,the sequence of events here is disturbing.
15842,IF this is a mild case then why administer Regeneron/Remdesivir?
15843,IF the initial infection was Thursday/Friday and the virus levels spiked that fast where you'd need powerful treatment then this is not a mild case and probably IF the case is a strong one then there's no way Trump won't come out of this not battered where he'll need extensive R&amp;R with rehab and IF that works how does he balance the R&amp;R + rehab with the JOB which is 24/7?
15844,IF this goes back further to Tuesday then how responsible is Trump for showing up late to the debate NOT getting tested and putting a LOT of people in harm's way?
15845,IF this goes back a week to the Rose Garden and everyone getting lit up from then to now may show that Trump put a LOT more people in harm's way.
15846,the further the timeline goes back the MORE the amount of people increases and there's spikes in Wisconsin after the last rally there?
15847,my question about the testing is WHAT TESTS?
15848,if the WH was testing the infection should have been caught by Monday Tuesday.
15849,There's a lot of TOP level Republicans that got put in harm's way by this who are going to be none too happy with this.
15850,I can't wait for the first lawsuit from the Fat Cats at the NJ fundraiser last week.
15851,I don't know how you can  keep anything swept under the rug here...
15852,It matters little but the votes aren't from me.
15853,No kits can do what the republicans claimed they were doing.
15854,There is no country with test kits that can tell you have Covid rapidly before There’s enough Covid in your system to get sick and probably be infectious.
15855,Most educated people know that the way viruses work is that a few tiny ones slip into you and take over a healthy cell in your body.
15856,They then hijack it to make millions of copies of themselves and wait until they burst into your system and start again.
15857,"Test, and your body can’t really detect them inside our own cells because they just look like us."
15858,We also can’t detect them until they’re all over our body because they’re microscopic and easy to miss.
15859,Imagine searching for a human from space.
15860,"It’s hard to find one human, especially if he’s in his house."
15861,But if you’re searching for a billion humans from space suddenly you can look at parks or events and spot them!
15862,Same concept as these tests.
15863,Be careful about nationalism.
15864,No country inherently has better science than another.
15865,We’re all working from the same science and largely sharing.
15866,Trump found them a sign of weakness so governors and others are following his lead.
15867,Except we’ll never really know the extent of the illness he suffers unless he dies.
15868,The plasma antibody transfusions work really well though.
15869,I’ve known multiple super high risk people in their 70’s that received transfusions at the VA as soon as they were diagnosed and none even suffered from flu-like symptoms.
15870,Studies like this are so interesting.

15882,I am afraid this is correct.
15883,As soon as the left started to logically conclude that gambling was horrible for society the religious right started to advertise as freedom worth fighting for and no where wa5d it ever banned in the bible.

15913,"Cool , China doesn’t report any anymore 😁 they are stuck at 84k if I remember correctly... who ever believes that 🥳"
15914,That...is some doctoring on their part.
15915,In this situation: It's extremely well known by everyone who attended these functions who  has tested positive.
15916,"Even if they had managed to avoid the press and social media coverage, each attendee has probably been contacted multiple times by the press about this."
15917,So at this level contact tracing is redundant.
15918,I think the reality is going in the opposite direction: everyone who paid $50k for a photo op with the president at the rally is sending their best wishes and hopes for a speedy recovery to the president.
15919,"And given their reasons for attending one of the events, anyone who caught it as a result will be seeking to keep the matter as private as possible."
15920,"It's because the government is very unstable and the only thing keeping it afloat is that no one wants corona elections(we had 3 elections in a row until the Corona crisis came and the two big parties joined to create the bloatest, most impotent and inefficient government in Israel's history just to prevent a corona election)."
15921,Now through the months it became clear no one wants to put any restrictions and come out as the bad guy before the inevitable election.
15922,"In addition a lot of the restrictions eere basically put into place, met widespread outrage and were then canceled(happened literally more than a dozen times)."
15923,"We were stable for 2000 cases a day in the summer for a full month amd then September comes, school opens up and in mere 3 weeks we gor to 9000 cases a day."
15924,"And that's all without even getting to the massive protests against our corrupted prime minister, the massive outdoor maakleaa weddings in arab villages and the fact that the orthodox jews don't give the slightest shit about restrictions most of the time and have a very powerful political lobby(I mean I'm starting to get why people are antisimetic and I'm fucking jewish) that's defending them from much needed restrictions."

15976,You stay home when you didn't need to.
15977,But yet the schools still stay opened on level 5
15978,"It hasn't been like this for the past months: Only some smaller news sites tolerated discussion (without devolving into equating skeptics to conspiracy theorists), and this is the first *big* site I've seen with an article voicing anything that even smells like criticism."
15979,I think it's really nice!
15980,(even though it's way too oversimplified to the point of all the arguments on either side being rubbish)
15981,"Some testers do acute swirl, others seem to bypass the sinus and go straight for the brain."
15982,Replace schools with businesses in general.
15983,We really should not have made schools the sword we chose to die on.
15984,"Schools are far more important to be open than bars, restaurants and most of our spread has been in bars and restaurants up until the time schools reopened."
15985,Taken further most computer/office based businesses reopened.
15986,Unlike schools there offices can work remotely no problem.
15987,But most reopened because the bosses needed control.
15988,We shouldn't have focused so heavily on schools and just said reopening in general was dangerous and we should have limited the openings as much as possible.
15989,Study shows it decreases mortality for patients who are on a ventilator or supplemental oxygen.
15990,But it increases mortality on mild cases that don't need help breathing.
15991,My non-medical understanding is that it reduces your immune response.
15992,"So troublesome if you're too early and fighting the virus, but beneficial for those who are suffering from the immune over-response that some patients get later."
15993,Cocaine will do that.
15994,In reality that wall has only had 3 miles built of new border

And there's no speculation that it's known to suppress the immune system response."

16030,"Avoiding crowds outside but not avoiding being outside, maintaining social distance, no mask recommended if this can be maintained."
16031,Generally to catch it you need more than a passing exposure to an infected person.
16032,If we all did this that's what it would take to tamp it down.
16033,"There is no scenario where we could all go back to normal until there's a vaccine, but I think there's some hint of normality possible with the above."
16034,You might be able to loosen up a little bit and still be being safe and responsible.
16035,A (masked) run to a store isn't looking too dangerous.
16036,One good option is outdoor distanced socializing with friends.
16037,"Be selective as hell because it amazes me how many people will go to an ""outdoor socially distanced"" gathering and then pointlessly get right on top of you for no reason."
16038,Driving places and staying in a hotel (the room not hanging in the indoor common areas or restaurants) is low risk too.
16039,I haven't been to a bar or eaten indoors in a restaurant since March.

16046,"Not to wish him dead or anything, but to say something like, “We wish him well in his treatment of covid-19, but let me be clear, this was caused by his own foolish recklessness and hubris as he sowed seeds of chaos across our country while millions of Americans lost their jobs and hundreds of thousands have died."
16047,"The president’s illness is a direct result of his failure to execute a national plan or follow any kind of medical guidelines set forth by medical professionals.” Basically, “sick or not he’s still an asshole and this is his own fault.”"

16058,"The facts most of the arguments here against them are childish ad hominens (""all GPs are dumb"", ""they are anti mask so I won't listen to the rest"", etc) speak volumes."
16059,"A lot of people who preach ""listen to science"" are the first to dismiss opinions of experts when they disagree."
16060,"Finally, yes, a GP can know more than a microbiologist in academia, yes."
16061,"I had contact with people in academia before, they are not flawless gods, sometimes they are completely ignorant outside their immediate field (which is often extremely narrow and specialized), there is an insane amount of nepotism and corporatism and many have a ego that rivals the one of rockstars."
16062,"I am not going to fall in the same trap as the other poster and say ""all guys in academia are arrogant work shy charlatans sitting on an ivory tower with no contact to reality"" but this attitude exists, and a lot."

16080,"Trump is an avid supporter of the death penalty: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS3Ttyqy33A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS3Ttyqy33A)

Many of his voters are as well."
16081,"The death penalty has to be sought legally (one could argue the ""wishing"" part of the equation) and then fulfilled (the more troubling ""willing"" action)."
16082,"I don't wish death for Trump, if anything I hope for recovery and penance, but all of this piousness about not wishing ill on others is very hypocritical in most cases."
16083,"One can't wish ill on antifa, ""criminals"", terrorists etc out of one side of their mouth, while on the other side they scream condemnation at those wishing ill on Donny."
16084,"I am not suggesting that you're doing that, but wishing ill on those you see as a fundamental threat to your livelihood and health is really not uncommon amongst us simple creatures and seems to be cathartic to many."
16085,Mainly because he has been denying the existence (and then severity) of the virus since day one.
16086,"We can now see that he was probably doing this while knowing he had it, and was having treatments."
16087,"Since this seems to show that he is a massive hypocrite, along with being, IMO,  criminally negligent in his handling of the situation, the public (which have been directly impacted by his lying, to the tune of 200,000 deaths) want to see how he reacts to reality fucking him in the ass."
16088,Herd mentality = Survivor mentality....as in by then only the survivors will be 'fit to exist'.
16089,Survival of the fittest does apply with contagions Im afraid.

16093,&gt;the healthcare system was in the brink of collapse.
16094,and then what happened?
16095,"Yeah, US is barely a democracy and only has some liberties."
16096,With 16000 active cases I'm pretty sure the resurgence is here ... Thankful I live in the Atlantic bubble right now.
16097,I recalll clearly in 2012 a whole train of conservative propoganda that blamed Obama for the Great Recession.
16098,So even WITH almost complete collapse they manage to see Repub regimes as positive.
16099,Who says defunding schools isnt harmful?
16100,Her daughter should consider filing a lawsuit against her mother for endangering her health.
16101,It's actually a huge improvement over what's out there now.
16102,Racist.
16103,The incubation period can be anywhere from 2 to 14 days but the average seems to be 5 days.
16104,(14 days is rare however).
16105,"There also is a difference between carrying the Sars-Cov2-Virus, having Covid-19 and being infectious."
16106,You can carry the Sars-Cov2-Virus without having Covid-19.
16107,This essentially means you are infected but you are experiencing no symptoms.
16108,To have Covid means to actually be sick.
16109,A positive test means you are carrying Sars-Cov2 while showing symptoms and being sick means you have Covid.
16110,"(in colloquial everyday language however, these two are quite interchangable, I'm only talking strict medical definition here.)"
16111,"As long as you carry the Sars-Cov2-Virus you are potentially infectious and can pass it to other people, no matter if you actually have Covid or not."
16112,How infectious you are depends on how much of the virus you're shedding.
16113,Typically people are most infectious during the first few days of showing symtoms and a few days before that.
16114,"Asymptomatic carriers are thought to be less infectious than the ones that get a severe case of Covid, but they're still dangerous."
16115,How much virus people are shedding depends on how well the virus can replicate in their lungs and upper respiratory tracts.
16116,"It is believed that the immune systems of those people who are asymptomatic do a well enough job to curb the virus' reproduction rate, which is why they 1) show no symptoms and 2) are less infectious."
16117,So people are most infectious during the few days BEFORE coming down with severe Covid.
16118,"So if you meet someone and he falls very sick 3 days later, you can pretty much bet your ass that he infected you (unless you wore good PPE)."
16119,The amount of virus particles (virions) that a person sheds is also the metric of a test (sort of).
16120,The test can identify the genetic material of the virus and gives a positive result if it finds any.
16121,"So when you get a negative result, this means that there is not enough genetic material of the virus in your body to produce a signal  (if the test was done correctly)."
16122,This in all likelyhood means that you're not infectious (yet).
16123,"If there's not enough virus to make the test go BING, there's also not enough virus in your body to infect someone else."
16124,"You could however still be carrying the virus, even if a test comes up negative."
16125,"If you have only been freshly infected by someone else that same day, or the day before, there's not enough virus for detection yet, but if the virus can replicate successfully in your body, the test is going to be positive a few days later, you will be infectious and you also might get Covid."
16126,I hope this helps

16336,Right.
16337,"Edit: found the actual quote:

16339,"&gt;  
&gt;""I can't help but think that if I hadn't been wearing a mask so much in the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have gotten it,"" Gohmert added."

16395,Is Reddit going to deal with r/NoNewNormal?
16396,they seem to be feeding into some dangerous and life-threatening beliefs.
16397,"That's literally all you can say is ""Nonsense."""
16398,"Clearly someone biased here, and it's not me."
16399,I honestly don't see the point of those rallies.
16400,"Like, at this point, what are the chances of someone changing his/her mind?"
16401,"Well, he doesn’t want to create a panic"
16402,I can only say healthcare institution are human and theirs are general guidelines.
16403,Covid don’t follow guidelines.
16404,"If you unlucky, covid would still find a way."
16405,"Much lower risk of getting infected, yes."
16406,But low risk doesn’t mean no risk
16407,"At least 11 people involved in setup and organizing for last week's presidential debate have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an announcement from Cleveland officials."
16408,Are you tho
16409,"&gt; If it turns out you're right, THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME."
16410,There is no 'if'.
16411,I gave you an objective stat with a source.
16412,"If my source is wrong or if you have another source, by all means post it."
16413,Its not just rare... its one of the rarest things on the planet.
16414,But this isn't my opinion.
16415,Its a fact.
16416,"Out of over 34 million cases, there is only 11 confirmed cases of re-infection in around 10 months."
16417,It is miniscule and nothing to worry about.
16418,There are literally millions of other things more likely to happen to you than getting Covid twice.
16419,"If you want to worry about that, so be it."
16420,"But its silly to do so, and you're literally better off winning big bucks at the lottery."
16421,I apologize in advance if this isn't the correct place to ask.
16422,I work in a small shop (too small to properly social distance).
16423,"My manager and the other two employees do not wear masks, use hand sanitizer or wash their hands."
16424,I do.
16425,They and other loved ones in my life are having a hard time believing this is a big problem.
16426,"Is there a substantial risk for me, and if so, what are some good sources I can bring up to suggest so?"
16427,Nonsense.
16428,210K people died without most hospitals being overrun in the U.S.  That has nothing to do with preventing hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.
16429,Admitting inferior comprehension ability?
16430,"Make sense, he was late to the debate."

16437,"Welcome to round two, ding ding"

16439,"I mean shit is fucked beyond belief here, but not quite that fucked."
16440,Alright time to open everything back up all at once!
16441,Time to rest on our laurels!
16442,Most of Sweden's deaths were completely unnecessary.
16443,"Had they delayed the spread another month to get testing in place, they could have prevented over half of them that happened in nursing homes, and likely reduced the mortality even among younger people by improving treatment and upping vitamin D as spring arrived."
16444,"They probably wouldn't have even needed a real lockdown to do that, given how slowly it spreads in Sweden already."
16445,Mitigation absolutely can work in an organized enough country.
16446,"The least vulnerable 50% of the population have something like a 1/10,000 IFR."
16447,But any country organized enough to pull that off is just going to choose containment instead.
16448,"It's unfair to compare Sweden to other Scandinavian countries, because all of them have handled the pandemic very well."
16449,"Sweden's [level of deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html) is lower than Spain's or Italy's, and just higher than France's."
16450,The rest of Scandinavia is of course far lower.
16451,"But while ~5% of Spain/Italy/France and ~0% of Norway/Denmark/Finland have immunity now, ~10% of Sweden does."
16452,So they certainly have an advantage heading into fall.
16453,It will be a real shame if Norway/Denmark/Finland fail at containment and end up with more per capita deaths than Sweden.
16454,"They paid a lot to save a few thousand lives, and if those lives are saved it will have been worth it."
16455,"But if they cannot hold out until they have enough vaccine doses, things could get very bad in those countries."
16456,"They could, of course, still get very bad in Sweden too."
16457,Especially if they keep refusing to wear masks.
16458,The problem is the super-populist party in power and especially the Prime Minister.
16459,"The Health minister proposes a measure to fight the pandemic, a few assholes (and washed out celebrities) on social media make a big deal out of how it is nonsense and sprinkle in a dozen conspiracy theories, idiots jump in and start spreading it around, PM gets scared and reverses the measure even before it's implemented."
16460,People and businesses prepare for measures that never come.
16461,"This happened many times and every time it erodes people's trust in the government, by now everyone is confused and opposed to any measures."
16462,Facebook-driven government just doesn't work and we are fucked because of the idiots in power.
16463,[removed]
16464,The mask mandate happened when reopening was obviously a disaster.
16465,"Yes, I think that was in June."
16466,People still live here who are still working.
16467,So no.
16468,"“The only good democrat is a dead democrat”—Donald Trump

16473,"Weirdly enough, cases are also declining there too."
16474,"I don't like it but since everyone's wearing it, I don't mind either."
16475,It would be an admission of weakness (to him and his followers).
16476,I understand your sentiment.
16477,To answer your question bluntly because people won’t cooperate.
16478,"The treatments are ok at best, but pretty far from great."
16479,It is more that we had literally nothing before dexamethasone.
16480,They really are not anything to write about...yet.
16481,"Remdesivir may work, but it is far from a silver bullet."
16482,I’ve been in the ICU with those patients.
16483,They don’t just get up up and walk out after Rem and Dex.
16484,It just isn’t like that.
16485,This is still a monstrous disease.
16486,I wish it was different.
16487,"I would love for us to be like Canada, New Zealand or any of the other low risk areas."
16488,Unfortunately we are not a country of people with compassion or personal responsibility.
16489,So the best case for us is available hospital space.
16490,Because you were responding to a comment about San Bernardino's contribution to California's statistics.
16491,"So while it is large in geography and large population relative to other counties in the country, its size is not significant relative to the state's population."
16492,As long as you wear your mask we will try.
16493,Asshat
16494,That’s actually exactly how this works.
16495,The antibodies for other viruses within the coronavirus family typically last about 3 months before they decrease.
16496,Your memory cells may last a bit longer but generally speaking immunity falls off after a while for virtually every disease.
16497,"I think so, because the first came on with an insanely high R^0 compared to now, with zero measures."
16498,"In Belgium they are also saying that now they are breaking record detections, but the made the disclaimer that in March the undetection rate was about 30x and now it is likely 3x."
16499,It's not his degree or alma mater that bother me.
16500,It's the fact that he's basically an extension of the Trump administration.
16501,"He could have the highest credentials in the world and I'd still question everything he said, especially under these circumstances."
16502,well yes we've been on lockdown for 7 months.
16503,But I could at least go out in the back yard and keep myself busy.
16504,Have a walk through the neighborhood.
16505,I also have friends who had a kid in November 2019 and its been great for them.
16506,Great timing.
16507,Haseltine is using the argument that a 3% CFR at 65% herd immunity will lead to almost 6.5 million deaths in the US.
16508,I’m not condoning herd immunity at all.
16509,But using CFR to throw around numbers like “6.5 million deaths” is just plain irresponsible especially for a scientist.

16580,This is the third cycle of it happening so far.
16581,And it isn’t helping.
16582,Whoever thought the propaganda approach was the way to go needs to be fired.
16583,People can see through propaganda.
16584,We need to find a new technique.
16585,Maybe lying and saying kids are dying in huge numbers in the hospital isn’t a good way to get young people to take the disease seriously.
16586,"Because when those people see that no, a bunch of kids aren’t actually dying in the hospital, they no longer trust experts because those experts lied to them."
16587,That’s what happened in the summer.
16588,And now none of those people believe anything experts say because experts keep purposely saying things that aren’t true.
16589,Trump is going to get better with the very best medical options available.
16590,He will come back stronger having shrug off the little virus.
16591,"People will feel sorry for him and empathize with him more, he will put even less attention into mitigating covid and people will vote him in again having forgotten all the incompetence and lying he has been responsible for."
16592,He is after all a serial winner ... and we all want to be on the winning side.
16593,Remindme!
16594,14 days.
16595,Well anyhow I don't think France will experience surge of deaths 3 times as big as in spring any soon.
16596,"There are much more tests being done nowadays, in the beginning there was a high scarcity of them, so for sure they are catching much more mild or asymptomatic cases"
16597,Taking a victory lap on trump's infection at this point seems premature.
16598,He's 2 days into symptoms and is following the curve of getting better before the downturn I've read so much about.
16599,Time will.tell.
16600,The comments on that post are a dumpster fire
16601,I was just thinking about how this illustrates the amount of brain drain that's occurred to the point that there's no one competent left.
16602,You know they had numerous health experts and scientists around urging for proper procedures and they were all pushed away and sidelined until you have this.
16603,It's basically security theater that *feels* safe to anyone who doesn't understand the science.
16604,Reality intervenes.
16605,One more win for travel restrictions.
16606,This whole disaster could have been prevented with faster response in the west.
16607,"We were locked down here in Melbourne during March/April/June, but after we reopened there was a problem with the hotel quarantine that has caused a second wave just in Victoria that made the first wave look absolutely tiny."
16608,how
16609,"While I agree with your sentiment, no way I'm waiting until spring 2022."
16610,I give this until Q1 2021 and after this I'm done.

16616,We’re gonna have lots of dead bodies and suicides for Christmas this year......
16617,"Ok, did a bit research and found a [more precise time estimate](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Steckbrief.html)."
16618,The average time until death after infection are about 23 days / or 18 days after first sympthoms.
16619,It’s still pretty rare for family to come see their loved ones.
16620,"I know some hospitals are letting visitors if the family member isn’t in a covid unit but Covid patients still don’t get family members, some are letting family members in when they decide to take all life support measures away."
16621,Numbers will probably at least double before the pandemic is completely over
16622,Nope.
16623,Not going.
16624,On /r/coronavirus the standard is to always round the numbers to make sweden seem as bad as possible.
16625,Unfortunately it will probably be worse after.
16626,At least at first.
16627,NZ and Australia are not sparsely populated.
16628,Both are more urban than the US and NZ has more densely populated urban areas because the city planning rules don't allow for American style sprawl.
16629,NZ and Australia have succeeded due to very strict and well enforced lockdowns.
16630,And in NZ people who test positive and all their close contacts are moved to military guarded quarantine facilities.
16631,Understanding what to do and being able to do it are two different things.
16632,"Refusal to shut 
 down again is a reckless plan."
16633,We may not have a choice in the peak winter months.
16634,How is this upvoted.
16635,"If 1% of their population was getting infected, they'd already be well on their way to herd immunity."
16636,300k is not 1% of the us population.
16637,Might wanna check your math.
16638,"Well, guess we have to do moon trips instead when we retire"
16639,"Had no plans to go there in the first place, and we're not going now."

16644,I had a mask and gloves available at all times.
16645,So glad to be retired now.
16646,"No, DOs are legit doctors."
16647,"DO school is one of two routes to becoming a practicing physician, the other being MD school."
16648,"DO curriculum is the same, just with extra practice with the musculoskeletal system."
16649,"They have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as an MD."
16650,"He is an *actual* physician, he’s just covering for Donald, which makes him a questionable person."
16651,Still a wholly qualified doctor though.
16652,Eat out help out was the most ridiculous stupid policy anyone ever had.
16653,"You have to eat at the restaurant to take advantage of it, you cannot do takeaway."
16654,"The day it was made clear what the rules were, I told my colleagues that this is ""the government subsidising the virus to spread."""
16655,Pay the restaurants to stay shut.
16656,Pay to encourage people to do takeaway.
16657,Pay to part of hospitality wages.
16658,"Sure, any of those I would understand and support."
16659,But using my tax money to pay people to go into mostly indoor places to eat sitting there?!?!
16660,?
16661,Huh thats interesting.
16662,We will find out soon I guess.
16663,Someone needs to draw a green gas cloud emanating from each of their mouths so people will understand how this transmits.
16664,Called it.
16665,They shouldn't have reopened schools at all in NYS.
16666,Alas.
16667,"They were doing so well, too!"
16668,Remember Israel?
16669,Wow.
16670,Those have something like a 30% failure rate.
16671,I feel like a 3rd grader would have enough of a grasp of statistics to see the gaping flaws in that strategy.
16672,Where do the people dying from it catch it from these people then?
16673,"We can still test people's immune response, and that is still there in most people who had SARS (a few have obviously died over the last 20 years, so one can't say all still have it)."
16674,"Exactly, and so many people on here dont even think about these things, it's all about covid, same as with the media."
16675,These things will effect a far higher number of people than covid will.
16676,Actually opposite of that
16677,So because students are at a football game on a Saturday night that means they never do work.
16678,You must be a really fun person
16679,"I found and unmasked the Lady Rona, and Mrs Moneybags!"
16680,"So we shouldn't have expected a second wave, which we did because it happened with Spanish Flu?"
16681,They are totally comparible in some ways.
16682,Not necessarily in others.
16683,"In terms of vaccines and getting back to normal, why should be say, for example, ""30k deaths from flu is acceptable, even with a vaccine"" , but then turn around and say ""a coronavirus vaccine should stop any death from covid""."
16684,It's nonsense and places more value on certain peoples lives than others.

16693,Small percentage with large population is still a lot of people.
16694,"I wouldn't say that's ""virtually nobody"" unless you agree that 214,000 people killed by covid so are is ""virtually nobody""."
16695,Trump isn't abducting and killing young girls.
16696,Trump isn't putting people in gulags and causing the deaths of 28-60 million.
16697,Get a grip.
16698,It should be fairly easy to understand - they just don't care about the virus and aren't concerned by it.
16699,It's actually extremely simple.
16700,"When the US releases it's stranglehold on Cuba, it will thrive."
16701,"There is also functional immunity, i.e."
16702,you still get infected but it ends up being no worse than a bad cold.
16703,Today's common colds may be the deadly pandemics of yesteryear.
16704,&gt;while the Trump's care is based on the equipment that was already there and salaried military?
16705,I'm actually pretty sure the equipment was already there in the hospital u/gaukonigshofen went to considering he got the help that he needed.
16706,"Yes, that's two examples."
16707,I'm not gonna list every country for you if that's what you thought.
16708,"It'll be interesting to see if he spins it as ""folks the doctors said they have never seen someone as sick as me and then like a miracle i got better because of my good genes"" or if he goes the ""virus is a hoax,  i coughed once and they said to me 'Mr president sir you have the Chinese virus' and i asked them how bad,  and they said very bad,  the virus was working strongly' but even at its strongest it's just a cough and sniffles"""
16709,"Weak, snowflakes, anti science, wanting to stick it to the libs, assholes, selfish towards the safety of others, poorly educated....I mean the list is endless"
16710,Exactly.
16711,I don't know how it got so big without people questioning it more en masse.
16712,I called this shit a scam at 6 years old the shit want adding up.
16713,I'm 28 now and a robotic engineer and guess what.
16714,It's still a fucking scam.
16715,there's no proof that there is t cell immunity so I can't post it
16716,By linking Fox News you just invalidated any credibility.
16717,Cheers buddy!
16718,Stay in denial.
16719,Yeah man.
16720,The first politicians were priests.
16721,"Hello there, fellow Atlantan."
16722,What kind of measures they announced?
16723,"A lot of them follow a theory of bravado, in which bravery is rewarded and caution is punished."
16724,They perceive bravery in the direction of individual ruggedness and acceptance of risk.
16725,This value system is part of the very essence of the Trump wing of the party's takeover of the Republican party.
16726,It is a value system that has taken over the party because they feel it is threatened by the emerging left.
16727,"To admit that it is not appropriate for the current circumstances would be to cecede to a value system that they feel is going to make America weak, spineless, and incapable of maintaining greatness through feats of strength and daring."
16728,You can’t return to normal if you never changed your behavior in the first place.
16729,It's worse than merely just the tourism industry.
16730,These people making decent money catering to tourists now don't have any money coming in to spend in their country.
16731,"So other businesses begin to struggle, and everyone ends up feeling the brunt of the lost revenue."
16732,"Same thing will happen here, just might take a little longer."
16733,"If you are happy you have a work from home job right now and can avoid going outside, you may lose it when the economy topples."
16734,"Our only plan right now is seemingly to print money, but we are already stretched by these idiotic fiscal policies that encourage high debt levels due to low interest rates."
16735,"I am also not American, but live real close by and I can tell you that you are 100% accurate."
16736,"And furthermore, what they consider ""leftist"" includes what the rest of the world largely considers centrist to centre-right."
16737,Most Democrats would fit in pretty snugly with most Conservative parties here in Canada.

16768,"I'm confused, aren't the Orthodox the conservative ones?"
16769,NYC has a lot of issues with the Orthodox Jewish communities not giving a F when it comes to wearing masks or holding large gatherings.

16791,Not to mention we have among the lowest cases in Europe at the moment.
16792,No lockdown and no stupid masks.
16793,"Meanwhile, the sheep in the rest of the world is celebrating losing their own freedoms and implementing lockdowns where the negative consequences far outweigh the positive ones and they only manage to accomplish to delay the number of infected."
16794,It's time you wake up to reality and understand that this virus isn't ever gonna go away.
16795,"Learn to deal with it, and no, lockdowns is not a sustainable solution."
16796,Our other option is to just reopen as much as we can without hospitals getting overloaded.
16797,"Which was the original goal, like so many people seem to forget."
16798,True.
16799,"Regardless, the figure is based on 1-(1/R0) approximation."
16800,"I know it could be lower or higher, but it gives us a good ballpark number."
16801,I’ll read that journal article later.
16802,I mean considering that the GOP just had a major super spreader event with pictures where no one is wearing masks I think she may be lower on the list of politicians needing a wake up call about masks.
16803,He has not.
16804,He’s been trying to pass DIFFERENT heath care just to please his base that he repealed Obama care.
16805,But he is so incompetent he can’t patch together a workable plan.
16806,He keeps promising to unveil it and doesn’t.
16807,"“Nobody knew health care could be so complicated” is an actual quote from him, despite EVERYONE knowing that health care could be so complicated."
16808,&gt;Is it a sign of weakness?

16816,You hate to see it.
16817,Herd immunity is not possible with this virus.
16818,My point was that there are thousands of wet markets all over the world.
16819,"I’ve seen many of them in person, and they’re not as black and white as you’re making it."
16820,"They’re very problematic in many ways but many of them are the heart of their communities, bringing local producers and citizens together on a daily basis.. sometimes their the only market for small producers and the only local source of affordable food for locals + the only source of income."
16821,"It’s native to just say everyone everywhere needs to work to bring everything up to code - especially considering many of these places have operated like this for hundreds of years, and earners make sometimes less than 1$ a day."
16822,You’re talking about asking the poorest of the poor to bring themselves up to higher standards then they could ever imagine.
16823,"Many of these places would require entire new buildings, plumbing, facilities etc."
16824,Who is going to pay for all that?
16825,You think third world corrupt governments are going to go in and spend all that money?
16826,Nope.
16827,"My point is not to say we shouldn’t improve things, but it’s more to just highlight that the problem is WAY more complicated then people are grasping."
16828,"The deforestation bit is relevant everywhere especially in China, because it pushes rural communities out of their farms and into cities - something that has happened in China at a large scale."
16829,This pushes these illegal animals sales and live animal markets into much much more densely populated areas like the one in Wuhan.
16830,Ever think about why you don’t hear of these epidemics coming and spreading from Africa where many live markets and bush meat markets thrive?
16831,It’s because they’re not densely populated/they don’t have international travellers etc.
16832,It stays in their communities and dies out.
16833,"The more we expand urban centres and drive rurals into cities, it’s basically like stirring up the ingredients for a pandemic."
16834,It’s happening worldwide and the likelihood of these pandemic occurring more often is very very high.
16835,"Do some research, you sock muppet."
16836,"&gt;I don't normally want treatments to be completely ineffective...

16839,I think so.
16840,I misread it at first too when I skimmed it.
16841,"I wish Trump no ill will but if he ever actually utters the phrase ""I can't breathe"" during this and means it, it will use up all the irony that is left in the world."

16848,3 of 7 School Board members refuse to wear them.
16849,But at least they require them at public meetings.
16850,Here's the annoying part though.
16851,"All of them were seen wearing them in public places like stores before our Governor put a mandate in place, or many retailers required them."

16896,"To be blunt, if we lockdown again, maybe the sensible people can avoid getting sick while that certain percentage will find ways to kill themselves through viral infection."
16897,What else can we do?
16898,This certain percentage seems determined to ignore medical advice because they think it is either a hoax or somehow tramples on their rights.

17056,...well fuck.
17057,This isn’t how contact tracing works.
17058,The contact tracer often spends an hour or more working with the person who tested positive to find their contacts.
17059,The contact tracer helps them remember where they went and who they saw and is trained to ask leading questions that can help bring out more info.
17060,"If the positive case is hesitant to give out their friends’ and family’s details, the contact tracer can help coax that info out of them."
17061,The contact tracer also assesses the risk for each contact and determines which ones need to be told to self-isolate for 14 days.
17062,The contact tracer then has to call all those contacts who need to self-isolate and explains why the self-isolation is necessary.
17063,A computer can’t do all that.
17064,"(Or at least this is how it works in BC, although we’re at capacity and some contacts are slipping through the cracks.)"

17538,"I do wear masks when around vulnerable family members, even though they tell me I don't need to."
17539,Second daily reminder
17540,"Here's a pro tip: if you don't know how to spell a word, type it in Google first."
17541,Kind of like that other word...
17542,Proud of CA!
17543,"I’m sure it will start rising because schools are opening, indoor dining, ect."
17544,With precautions.
17545,Hopefully the rise is slight and we can keep it up through winter!
17546,oooh yeah Pence exists!

17552,Right??
17553,Jesus
17554,I didn't see him either.
17555,Just wondering about his level of exposure.
17556,The reception and the debate prep seem to be the two super spreader moments.
17557,It's because we open carry and tell the virus to shut the hell up and go back to China.
17558,Duh.

17560,Wasn't Sweden late to the first wave party?
17561,"I love Hong Kong, I'm based in Shenzhen but i usually work in hk but that is just bullshit."
17562,"The latest hk wave was almost certainly from crew members being able to wander around freely, there is no doubt Shenzhen has been safer than Hong Kong for 6 months."
17563,You all still travel for holidays during the pandemic!?
17564,Within countries back to home province still can understand.
17565,Is land tourism still open in Europe?
17566,Believe air tourism travel across countries are still closed?
17567,It doesn't help that we suave had thousands of people move from out of state here.
17568,Its inevitable its going to get worse before it gets better.
17569,We did fine at first.
17570,they could clean the bedpans of covid patients and do something with their wasted lives
17571,"Oh rly, I thought in pharma stuff moves at the speed of capitalism"
17572,No please.
17573,Anything but that.
17574,Our government is filled with corrupt motherfuckers.
17575,DO NOT let them anywhere near that kind of power.
17576,No...
17577,"Yeah I did see that, just thought I should point it out since I know when I see a bunch of stuff on r/conservative or whatever that gets to me I always have to take a minute to remind myself that it's not an accurate reflection of how most people feel on the other side, it's just a bunch of toxic redditors."
17578,"Most people aren't that crazy or hateful or judgy in reality, you know?"
17579,"Just saw how many downvotes you were getting and thought I'd say don't take it to heart, people get weird on the internet"
17580,"Holy shit, Amy Coney Barrett has a bad case of crazy eyes"
17581,False equivalency.
17582,Also it’s absolutely idiotic.
17583,No way to guess for the whole country.
17584,"AFAICT they do keep good mortality records, allowing us to assess excess mortality, but only on the local or state level."
17585,"In Manaus city, [0.2% of the population has died](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/03/measuring-excess-mortality-gives-clearer-picture-pandemics-true-burden/)."
17586,They estimate [2/3 have had it](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787v1) implying 0.3% IFR.
17587,"The [median age of Manaus is a little over 25 and around 7.5% of the population is over 50](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/03/measuring-excess-mortality-gives-clearer-picture-pandemics-true-burden/), so this level of mortality is extremely high (by comparison, over a third of the US is over 50, and many other countries are considerably older)."
17588,"I just skimmed it, but there's this:

17589,"I'm reminded of another industry self-regulating ─ Boeing, and the 737."
17590,How'd that work out?
17591,"I recognize that the pharmaceutical corporations are saying this stuff because everyone knows that the federal agencies have been totally politicized, but, we're not in a good place right now."
17592,The earliest I want to hear any vaccine news is Nov 4th.
17593,"The country's head epidemiologist resides at Walter Reed Medical Center, perhaps in Herman Cain territory?"
17594,I'm simply done with all of this.
17595,Not ready to take this up until Nov 4th.
17596,And it is really simple as to why.
17597,"Because, they're trying to salvage the October surprise as involving science as opposed to politics."
17598,"Well, we have our October surprise now, don't we."
17599,I don't want to hear any more from Pfizer until 2nd week of November.

17610,"They DEFINITELY wouldn’t try to fit in as many drinks as they could before close like they did when closing was at 1am, right?"
17611,"And that definitely wouldn’t lead to them being more hands on or not pay attention to the rules, just earlier in the night, right?"
17612,"This may come as an unpopular opinion, but I genuinely feel that if Trump was to die as a result of COVID-19, that it would have an overall positive influence on many of his followers’ willingness to wear a mask."
17613,"If they were to see him perish from the virus, many people who previously rejected masks may move to say “this virus is for real."
17614,"It can get anyone.”  However, if he walks away, following an uneventful stretch of fighting the virus and seems no worse for wear after it, you can guarantee that those same people will be even more inclined to refuse wearing masks in the future."
17615,They will have been convinced that they themselves also have the strength to overcome the weak China Plague.
17616,And many people will die as a result of their decisions.
17617,TLDR: Trump’s death would potentially make maskless  idiots recognize that the virus is worth protecting against.
17618,And what about the 50% of the country who voted for him?
17619,The lingering animosity isn't going to evaporate regardless of what happens to Trump.
17620,The animosity that's developed between the two halves of this country will discharge one way or another.
17621,Each side has its own fairy tales and believes itself so virtuous.
17622,That's a very bad situation.
17623,I don’t think you would know truth if it smacked up upside the head.

17627,Restaurants and bars closing does work when you add an evening curfew.
17628,"When Antwerp was a cluster fuck in August, bars and restaurants were closed at 22:30 and we all had to be off the streets at 23:30 and I think that's what helped stop spread the virus as much at that time because people got less drunk and weren't able to gather outside afterwards, almost everybody in their homes before midnight."
17629,Police everywhere to check and fines starting at 250 and going up to 1600 + 4 days in jail for breaking the curfew.
17630,"Yea, that's because we have things like mask mandates, pretty rural honestly outside of the big cities, restaurants are still limited, Bars are weird, etc."
17631,"Trust me, if covid would be widespread in Vietnam you would know."

17640,How is it sloppy?
17641,"Even if Trump’s negligence and active poisoning the well has resulted in 1% of the deaths, it’s still justified."
17642,It is okay to wish for the death of people who cause others to die.
17643,Trump has caused Americans to die.
17644,Many.
17645,Period.
17646,That’s fair.
17647,But I did limit my comment to specifically this thread.
17648,Edit: typo
17649,For context most of Australia and all of New Zealand never had extensive community spread and were able to lock down long enough to put out the limited chains of transmission.
17650,"Here in Victoria we have had a 23- and now 22-hour per day stay at home order, and are forbidden from moving 3 miles from our homes for most purposes, and can’t leave the city limits; this has been the case for months and there is no firm end date in sight."
17651,"Most school kids have been home for 9 months, currently no nonessential stores or restaurants can have people inside."
17652,ImThis has dropped case numbers to about 10 per day from an average high of about 500.
17653,So far.
17654,Whether it can be eradicated or maintained at a handful of cases a day this way is yet to be seen.
17655,The lockdown will end up costing more lives in the long run
17656,"they know it's a cult of personality, and mike pence has no personality."
17657,"if trump goes down, the cult stays home, and they get crushed in the election."
17658,"they also know that if mike pence becomes president through the succession process, they might not get their precious supreme court justice, because he can't break ties in the senate if he's the president."
17659,the vice president's office would be empty until a new person is confirmed by both parties of congress.
17660,"so there is an incentive to play weekend at bernie's with trump's health, which is very concerning for national security."
17661,Maybe hygiene isn't the big issue to contain covid.
17662,I think Australians and New Zealanders aren't aware of how little international travel they actually get compared to USA or Europe.
17663,"Not being a ""cross roads of the world"" definitely helped with their covid-19 numbers."
17664,But Biden isn’t president yet
17665,They might still pop positive.
17666,"If Trump and Melania caught it at the reception on Saturday and gave it to them at the debate on Tuesday, they might still be incubating."
17667, !remindme three days
17668,PA still has a much lower infection rate than much of the country
17669,[deleted]
17670,The Ironyvirus.
17671,There's something very sad about that place being filled with Trump fans when the man himself has required oxygen to keep him alive due to COVID-19.
17672,"Yeah, I got that feeling as well."
17673,even our president couldn't be bothered to take precautions
17674,"Definitely more than 1, and less than 7 billion."
17675,Fuck off.

17677,"So long as the hospitals aren’t overflowing, they’re going to let it be it seems."
17678,"Dude also, hopefully you're not, but just in case: you should not be making judgements about people in real life based on the toxic shit you see people saying on reddit."
17679,It's not an accurate reflection of the left or the scientific community in general or anything like that
17680,Add China and Korea into that mix in which everyone started wearing masks and contact tracing.
17681,They had minimal impact apart from early days in Wuhan but then again I think that was unavoidable.
17682,And he still is saying we should know if it works or not this month.

17797,"Even then, most countries that have the outbreak controlled have set limits of 10-50."
17798,How often do you meet up with so many people for that to be a significant issue?
17799,"As for F&amp;B, they can still open albeit with a smaller capacity."
17800,Many have adjusted for that via having promotions for take out or delivery.
17801,"At its core, if you actually want you country to reopen and stay that way, social distancing is the best way to do so."

17806,Pretty much every known adverse effect of a vaccine appear within the weeks or first few months after injection.

17837,"But from that video, I doubt it's really serious at this point."
17838,I think they need it to move at the speed of both light and bleach for it to be totally effective.

17840,Uganda has opened doors to mass infections
17841,Federal minimum wage is $7.50/hr.
17842,States like texas simply set their minimum to federal.
17843,I was an assistant manager making $9.25/hr.
17844,It's not good
17845,This is correct.
17846,It's the time of year when they have a lot of holidays and gatherings.
17847,It’s where the selfishness of expecting the benefits of society without feeling any need to give back to that society as well.
17848,"It’s the ultimate hypocrisy of the stupid, arrogant and pathetic."
17849,Do the right thing by your fellow man so we can minimise the harm done to THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY.
17850,Isn't it the right that wants to openly shoot those they politically disagree with?
17851,Ditto and ditto.
17852,And ditto.
17853,😂😂
17854,Yeah a lot of people assume that when locals talk about problems with the Hasidic community its just because they're antisemitic.
17855,In reality even local Jewish communities don't get along with the Hasids.
17856,I really can't stand anymore pictures with masks BELOW the nose.
17857,that's so stupid of the people.
17858,Low risk as opposed to no risk doesn’t mean we don’t make risk-reward compromises and get on with our lives.
17859,"Then those politicians are dumb, but many are."
17860,It's incredible to see that many still don't seem to grasp what exponential growth is...
17861,"Thank God I never opted for a teaching career, wouldn't have the patience for it."
17862,&gt; How did that even get approved and how hadn’t the government stepped in to take the proper steps for these people in these communities?
17863,It's all political.
17864,"I live in Crown Heights, an orthodox neighborhood, and they don't wear masks and constantly throw gatherings."
17865,"Plus it's a big holiday season for them right now (I don't mean to be disrespectful, I just don't remember which holiday off the top of my head) and they gather in large numbers for that as well."
17866,But they can't really be touched.

17868,If Pfizer were to send out a vaccine that had severe side effects they could get sued by millions of people.
17869,They aren't willing to risk going out of business to get Trump reelected.
17870,They also don't wear masks (source: have a shit ton of French friends who sent me pictures of them hanging out without masks).
17871,"Also, r/france is filled to the brim with anti-maskers, they seem to think the virus can't affect them because they're not the US."
17872,O.5 -  1% is the IFR estimate in the linked article  yes.
17873,Not the ridiculously low number you arrived at of 0.13%.
17874,"The FLU IFR, by the way, is 0.04%."
17875,You are once again confusing CFR for IFR.
17876,"Most definitely, it'll be chaos."
17877,No matter the outcome America is in the shit rn.

17885,We've got like 5 ICU beds in my county.
17886,We're having the worst outbreak in the state right now.
17887,We're pretty much fucked.
17888,Wearing masks and following social distancing whenever possible aren't even that hard.
17889,I really don't get it.
17890,Do American students actually ever do any studying?
17891,It seems like university over there is all partying and sport.
17892,Christmas markets and indoor restaurant visits enter the chat
17893,"Yet, redditors will still think the US is handling this virus worse than everybody else."
17894,"I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not a competition, but Reddit sure makes it feel that way."
17895,So that makes Covid-19 a rhinovirus?
17896,Your point is naïve and selfish.
17897,"It’s been said time and time again, you can not compare the flu to COVID."
17898,"For starters, high risk groups have access to flu vaccines."
17899,"Just because you are likely to survive COVID (with long term effects still unknown), why are you entitled to risk the lives of the high risk groups- who have the same rights in society as you?"
17900,"I’m sure this would be a very different conversation if you were 70+, was diabetic and had a heart condition."
17901,I'm in Paris.
17902,"Indoors, people are generally compliant."
17903,"In the trains, people are mostly compliant but it depends a lot on the train line."
17904,"In the streets, it's hit and miss."
17905,"Still surprisingly well-behaved, at least in the average neighborhoods I frequent."
17906,"Though you *can* be fined for not following the rules (train &amp; outdoors), in reality you only get a reminder unless you sass back."
17907,"The bouncers at stores may remind you, then ask you to leave, but I haven't seen any of the shouting matches like those in the US that turn up on YouTube."
17908,Four people are afraid of the truth.
17909,This is so sad!
17910,I’m disgusted by so many employers who don’t treat employees like human beings.
17911,This pandemic has brought out the best in some but it’s also revealed the worst in too many.
17912,☹️
17913,It's like a shitty game of six degrees of separation but it's not a celebrity it's a diseased bat.
17914,Unfortunately that still has a delay of 2 weeks and until measures show effect it takes another two.
17915,"If one understands that and reacts ahead of time when hospitalizations still seem rather small, that can work, but politically those numbers might not seem big enough for many people to grasp the severity of the situation."
17916,"That's Alex Azar, he worked as the President of Eli Lilly for several years while the cost of my insulin went from around $45 to $200."
17917,"Now it's $330 and the President took credit for making it ""cheaper than water."""
17918,edit : sorry to change the subject but I'm still raging at that comment.
17919,These are such malicious people
17920,It’s horrible that we should hold our lives so invaluable as this.
17921,Not a fucking coincidence.
17922,"Highest number of tests in one day, a test with a probably high false positive rate equals a record number of ""new cases""."
17923,Shocker.
17924,THIS!
17925,"Man... my family hasn't gotten so much as a COLD since we started wearing masks, washing hands, disinfecting groceries, etc."
17926,Zero illnesses!
17927,And last year my kids couldn't go 2 weeks without one of them getting a fever from a kid at school.
17928,It was insane!
17929,Because both states refuse to do the literal cheapest thing that can reduce the reproductive rate.
17930,"If masks in supply, I'll gladly do so until there's a vaccine."
17931,"Having done so for close to 3 months already, it's barely noticeable these days."
17932,"I don't care, do U?"
17933,I’m really not sure what you’re getting at here.
17934,All I was stating was that the drug itself does not have a price because it is not on the market yet.
17935,"I have no idea what exceptions Regeneron had to make to get him this drug if any but no, he is definitely not apart of a trial, and under _normal circumstances_ the only other reason experimental drugs are given to patients is compassionate use."
17936,But this is not a normal circumstance given he is the president.
17937,"No idea if the US Gov paid them for it, was just stating that technically the drug does not have a price because it’s not for sale."
17938,80s isn’t good.
17939,Why haven’t they admitted her to hospital?
17940,The words *shitshow* come to mind.
17941,They implemented their lockyourselfdown before the first wave really reached them.
17942,Yeah...no shit.
17943,Please table operation warp speed.
17944,These outbreaks are localized.
17945,Is there a way to compare those locales to how hard each place was hit in March-April?
17946,Florida Man
17947,Sounds just like here in America.
17948,"We have a federal app for contact tracing, but not enough people are using it."
17949,"This claim does seem sensationalist, but the headline is literally what the expert they were interviewing said."
17950,"The number of cases is low, which gives them time."
17951,But exponential growth is exponential.
17952,Wonder if his doctors and nurses have to wear the same dirty N95 mask for an entire week like the rest of the country?
17953,How was wearing a mask all day in Florida weather though?
17954,No one got infected at this event.
17955,"It was silly and premature to celebrate the ""end of pandemic"" but it had no influence on the spread of the virus."
17956,Age 74 males have a ~1.5% covid IFR (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180851v1).
17957,Maybe slightly less for Trump since he is presumably getting world class treatment unavailable to the general public.
17958,I think they'll just blame it on the Democrats somehow.
17959,"Nah, supermarkets have always had security and they don’t fuck around."
17960,Don't trust the number of cases in CA.
17961,I was tested many times and one of those was positive.
17962,"My county Public Health dept has no record of 90% of those tests, including the positive one."
17963,I don't know if the state has a record of it or what happened with that data.
17964,There seem to be a lot of people without basic knowledge of human anatomy.
17965,They don't seem to understand that your nasal passages lead to your lungs.
17966,"At what point is this the ""apocalypse""?"
17967,Ah yes prison labor bad but anti-masker community service good
17968,"Yep, we're prepping (again)."
17969,Gonna be getting extra supplies next couple weeks.
17970,This shit is infuriating.
17971,"Granted, I live in a small, rich, *very* white town..."
17972,"Which means that the local bar becoming an exposure site, like it did, was inevitable."
17973,In case you haven't heard there is a worldwide covid 19 pandemic running wild in america due to piss poor federal leadership.
17974,"This virus has killed 210,000 americans and it is still ongoing 24/7 and it gets more severe in cooler/cold weather."
17975,"If these kids can't control themselves in a pandemic then the colleges, the NCAA and the SEC needs to do it for them."
17976,Legal and fair are not the same thing.
17977,Is this the begining of second wave?
17978,&gt;From what I understand they are the WBC of the Jewish community and have been ignoring all attempts to contain the virus.
17979,They're quite different from WBC and arguably more detrimental to local communities.
17980,I grew up in a town that bordered a huge Hasidic community and I can tell you they quite literally believe that a) all non-Hasidic people (including other jews) live to serve them and b) the rules don't apply to them.
17981,"The community dominates local elections by voting en masse for a single candidate, and wield a metric shitton of influence at the state level because they are a huge voting bloc."
17982,They pay next to nothing in taxes (all their homes are considered places of worship and are tax free) and they dont get legally married so they collect tons of welfare from the state.
17983,"In Ramapo (a poor, mostly black school district) the Hasidic community took over the school board, even though they send their kids to religious schools, not public school, and illegally siphoned funds from the public school to bus their children to said religious schools."
17984,It was a huge scandal and yet nothing ever really came of it.
17985,"You can find videos of Hasidic/ultraorthodox communities openly flouting restrictions on maskwearing, gatherings of over 50 people, and social distancing with zero consequences."
17986,The notion that COVID deaths are being undercounted is pure speculation.
17987,For all anyone knows they're being overcounted.
17988,"In everybody's view, is Trump sicker then we are being told?"
17989,Australian here and can confirm - this is the first time in a very very long time I made it from the end of Autumn to Spring without a single cold or flu.
17990,"I don't recall seeing a sick person in a while, I guess because if you're sick you're not allowed to go out or come into work etc."
17991,I don’t know what to say except I agree with everything you’ve said.
17992,I hope you’re able to be there for each other.
17993,Take care and I hope you get your well deserved vacation sooner than later!
17994,To make you clicking on the article.
17995,"Fear is how you are controlled, in a lot of different ways."
17996,If you are scared you will follow directions and rules.
17997,Fear of missing out means you buy things you might not have otherwise.
17998,And the fact no politician or entity says anything about the Orthodox Jewish communities who don't wear masks because of the backlash they would face.
17999,An article I read said 20% of all NYC covid cases are in their neighborhoods.
18000,Being assholes has a lot to answer for.
18001,Two weeks is not enough.
18002,We had 6-7 in NZ.
18003,Learn to weld their populous in their homes and threaten to shoot them if they disobey?
18004,No thanks CCP apologist.
18005,Hospitalizations and deaths have the problem that they're tied to comorbidities and also hospital load (in the case of deaths).
18006,And they're also a more lagged indicator.
18007,"No metric is perfect, we need to take them all into account."
18008,"We think we have seen it be bad in America...we haven’t, we haven’t seen anything yet."

18010,It had to bite them in the ass eventuality.
18011,I hope this tanks the election for them.
18012,But you dont wear a mask for yourself.......you wear it so you don't infect others.
18013,Isn’t the lung infection the second stage of the virus?
18014,How long has he really been sick?
18015,"He blatantly lied, let's not beat around the bush."
18016,He's a liar.
18017,He explicitly said he wasn't on oxygen Friday and then today he said that he was on oxygen both Friday and Saturday.
18018,Good for you!
18019,"We lost a job, too, but thankful we were able to find another that would allow mostly remote work."
18020,Wishing you and your family a healthy winter to come!
18021,fortunately such an extreme should be less likely.
18022,a quirk of ww1 behavior allowed a highly virulent strain to flourish.
18023,covid doesn't have that luxury.
18024,instead we are dealing with it bring highly contagious comparatively.
18025,I thought they only gave that in cases of progressively worsening lung damage/inflammation?
18026,"I thought people ""close to him"" said he was perfectly fine."
18027,"Dexamethasone isn't without risks, so they don't just give it willy-nilly."

18062,I find it interesting much of Europe has resisted mask wearing yet is starting to reverse.
18063,Asian countries have embraced mask wearing for a long time.
18064,Even European nations that are very society minded in a similar fashion as Asian nations.
18065,[removed]
18066,Yeah that isn't likely to happen.

18076,I suppose you think you're a rebellious free-thinker instead of an irrational dickhead?
18077,You might not have noticed but it’s not just this administration.
18078,Masks acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic.
18079,"To them, keeping the economy open is more important than public health."
18080,"If they wore a mask, it would hurt their real cause, trying to keep the economy open."

18088,In my personal experience germans are more likely to actually follow rules than people in say France or Italy where they’re regarded as a suggestion.
18089,"yup, theyre even saying kids under 12 with symptoms should still go to school, and not get tested."
18090,its crazy.
18091,Claudia Conway just announced on TikTok she has COVID-19.
18092,I think they’re trying to see how many people they can convince to stupid themselves to death
18093,Can confirm
18094,"Yes, I'm pretty certain they all know too."
18095,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You have a centralized list of everyone who attended so you can notify their contacts to isolate as soon as they test positive."
18096,And the US as a whole has been extremely resistant to that level of contact tracing.
18097,Not doing it for these events is unfortunately just par for the course.
18098,Hooray us.
18099,Not OP but...I don't think so.
18100,First of all sorry for being pedantic.
18101,"&amp;#x200B;

* One thing you can consider is that one might understand science and still reject it (yes, that's stupid IMO but it's an example to illustrate my point)."
18102,The scientific method assumes some philosophical truths about reality and our ability to interact with it.
18103,These assumptions unfortunately cannot be proven by the scientific method itself.
18104,"* Pragmatically, does it matter?"
18105,"No, in my opinion it doesn't."
18106,"Science has been one of the greatest humanity's achievements, and rejecting it means setting us back in multiple ways."
18107,"* In a more realistic note, there are some practical elements at play."
18108,"Most people, for example, are unable to replicate studies on, let's say, covid treatments."
18109,"I, for example, consider HCQ to be inefficient at treating COVID-19 not because I replicated the studies, but because I take into account the reputations of all the universities envolved in these sorts of studies."
18110,"* What I mean is, there's a difference between doing science and reading about it."
18111,"You might consider the understanding of how scientific institutions work as a part of ""understanding science"" but I personally like making the distinction, and that's because scientific institutions can sometimes fail because of practical matters (ex: **that** The Lancet paper)."
18112,That has a negative effect on the general public.
18113,"* In short, I feel like conflating Science™ with its practical version can cause some confusion."
18114,The pitfalls of the scientific method itself are philosophical: in your day-to-day life you can pretty much neglect those.
18115,"*However*, the practical pitfalls of science are persistent: they affect public policies and real lives."
18116,"* As a last note, in philosophy belief might be true or not, justified or not."
18117,"So I don't see anything wrong in saying ""believing in science""."
18118,All of that is not to say there isn't a problem with scientific literacy in the general population.
18119,"Also yeah, obviously anti-maskers/flat-earthers don't ""reject the philosophical principles of science"", or ""offer critique to the scientific institutions""."
18120,"In practice they lack a basic understanding of how the scientific method works, or are bad-faith actors."
18121,Sorry for rambling so much.
18122,"In short, I think the term ""science deniers"" is perhaps more accurate."
18123,Pandemic *response* is what is hurting people.
18124,Stop with the passive voice!
18125,The virus is not a sentient being and governments responses are not uncontrollable.
18126,"I know someone (a doctor, no less) who had COVID twice, and always tested negative."
18127,"The first time, he was hospitalized in the ICU."
18128,Thank you.
18129,"We're good for winter now, but the lockdown in March was a little rough."
18130,"My husband lost his job (it was fine, we made it work and he's working again...actually in a much better job and no face to face human contact with the chance of bringing COVID home to our immune compromised kiddo), we lost our insurance (tied to husband's job) and couldn't find toilet paper in a house with a husband who was now home all the time and 3 kids who were no longer in school, so also home all the time."
18131,LOL.
18132,"We made it work and it was fine, but I am definitely going into winter far more prepared!"
18133,&gt; Atleast the goverment and leading god damn experts arent the ones trying to still claim masks are useless.
18134,...they literally are.
18135,"Let me take a stab with a theory 

1&gt; Optics because Wearing mask makes you look weak."
18136,You become a sheep.
18137,2&gt; Appease Donnie.
18138,Basically they are riding this trump base/cult support for their own political longevity.
18139,Eg - Lindsay Graham and Ted Cruz.
18140,Anyone who opposes is ostracized - Jeff Flake/Romney/ etc.
18141,Now that Trump has got COVID-19.
18142,He will pivot to say - We have know how and meds/therapeutics to live with this.
18143,I made it through.
18144,Pats himself on the back.
18145,OPEN SCHOOLS and ECONOMY.
18146,Nobody is caring about stress on Medical field/Essential workers.
18147,Doctors Nurses Essential workers are humans too.
18148,They must be paid Hazard Pay.
18149,"Pay of Senators/House Reps should be on pause too, if they do not do their job."
18150,"Basically, I sincerely hope Trump and Republicans lose Presidential election and senate because they will doom this country."
18151,If you need proof look at how they have managed this first wave since Feb 2020 and Winter is coming.
18152,There are experts who have laid it out for us multiple times.
18153,You can find it
18154,The virus isn't going anywhere but that doesn't mean non- pharmaceutical interventions are going to have to endure despite this.
18155,Already the virus has a relatively low IFR and its mostly stratified towards the elderly.
18156,A vaccine and effective treatments will bring normal life quickly to first world countries.
18157,"I've noticed that in the same way the far-right downplay or deny the existence of COVID, the radical left exaggerates the effects and construct doomsday scenarios around the pandemic that very few, if any, virologists and epidemiologists actually endorse."
18158,Just because you're pessimistic doesn't make you more correct.
18159,What is likely going to happen.
18160,I want Trump to get better.
18161,Even though he isn't my favorite person in the world.
18162,I still want him to get better.
18163,No I mean everyone.
18164,Plenty of educated people are already fleeing to Florida from New York due to having no restrictions.
18165,Education has nothing to do with it.
18166,People are selfish and will do what they feel is best for them personally.
18167,The stupidity that issues forth from this administration is absolutely shocking.
18168,Well they cant punish you for something that they dont know you did.
18169,I also cant see why this is an arguement for why dominic Cummings doesn't deserve to be punished?
18170,"It's their made up outrage du jour, like war on Christmas and sharia law."
18171,This is just the first time it back fired so spectacularly and they've lost control of it.
18172,"Fair point but to counter that, COVID is not nearly as deadly as the Spanish (Kansas) Flu"
18173,Their personal experience is quite irrelevant to anything.
18174,"The vast majority of people discharged from hospital after COVID do not drop dead in their home days later, let alone someone with the level of follow up care Trump will have in the WH."
18175,Seems like he is conflating personally wanting POTUS to die after being discharged with the actual likelihood of that happening.
18176,They are preaching to their base
18177,"Considering the term predates the CIA, I doubt it."

18185,"Not really, I just acknowledge reality works in ways we don’t like, but the odds are low."
18186,"I don’t advocate extreme measures, just good practices that cause almost no hassle or discomfort."
18187,Would you go to a football game if you knew someone would fire a machine run into a crowd and kill 20 people?
18188,I’d just watch it on Tv myself since I can still enjoy the game but don’t have a 1 in 1500 chances of being dead.
18189,So many people won’t acknowledge basic physics or math of the situation.
18190,It’s everyone who doesn’t think like I do that need a wake up call and who aren’t living in reality.
18191,You should be a germaphobe right now and as the globally interconnected world moves forward spreading everything worldwide in an instant with airplanes which is infectious diseases dream scenario.
18192,"“Isn’t necessarily true” isn’t a phrase he’d need to use if he was being entirely truthful, I’m not saying he’s doing horrible but something is being left unsaid"

18201,"A vaccine, even if it doesn't outright end the virus, will get us there faster."
18202,Throwing our hands in the air and saying it's probably futile won't get us past this.
18203,"""Isn't necessarily true"" so there's a chance they are hiding something?"
18204,This is a consequence of being the anti-science party.
18205,"So many idiots believed for the longest time that if you caught HIV early in the 80s, there was a cure because information on the disease was suppressed."
18206,They're talking about their personal experience.
18207,Poster is warning that just because someone is released from hospital care doesn't mean they are in the clear.
18208,"I would be genuinely surprised if the president didn't survive this though because of the level of care he receives, and the early use of remdesivir."
18209,"“Isn’t necessarily true” does not equal “not true” or even “false.”

18220,Luckily most places in the state don’t give a shit what our dumbass governor has to say about it.

18228,How can they be this inept
18229,The weirdest part of this election season is Trump trying his hardest to paint Biden as a radical while the entire primaries were defined by the left being pissed that a centrist was winning.
18230,It's bizarre seeing the GOP try to shift the Overton window in real time like that.
18231,Then he has the audacity to say anyone who needs a test can get one.
18232,Our state government is so bad even COVID had to take a break and visit other states for a bit.

18271,In early September I was speaking to a friend living in Paris.
18272,"She was painting a picture of normal life with offices, schools, restaurants, cafes being open, claiming everything was under control."
18273,I couldn’t understand why or how given they still had some amount of community spread.
18274,Fast forward one month and they are hitting record numbers and imposing new restrictions.
18275,"This virus doesn’t quit, complacency is its friend, vigilance is key."
18276,Way to miss that point
18277,Don't know why you're being downvoted.
18278,Most of the people I've been speaking to have started drinking more.
18279,Mostly out of bordom.
18280,You do become immune.
18281,I think you’re seriously ignorant of this field.
18282,Immunity means resistance.
18283,If vaccines didn’t confer immunity then there would be no point.
18284,awe they needed tourist money too much
18285,My doctor has two patients in their 30s with lasting heart damage from Covid.
18286,This isn't just about saving the lives of the elderly.
18287,Sounds very plausible that you had it.
18288,There have been quite a few reports of people saying they felt they had very little energy even months after the infection.
18289,I don't know what kind of test you did back then but there are different types.
18290,If you do a PCR test it tests directly for the viral RNA.
18291,"If you get this test 2 weeks after your symptoms  were at a heightt, it may well come back negative because at this point there will be very little virus left in your respirory tract."
18292,"If you want to know if you had covid19 at any point in the past, do an antibody test."
18293,"This doesn't tell you if you are infected right now, only if you have antibodies against the virus, so you have had it."
18294,"Antibodies stay in your body for many months or years, so this test should show if you had it."
18295,Fair enough.
18296,There could have been far fewer had he done a decent job anyway.
18297,What is the estimated death toll in brazil?
18298,"You know, I missed that study that shows that  coronavirus only spreads after 10 pm."
18299,Incubation up to two weeks but the vast majority show symptoms within the first week so we have probably seen most of them but there still can be some that were infected after the event as well
18300,Way too soon to say.
18301,I live there.
18302,Lol.
18303,Thank you
18304,Hopefully the pandemic will have died down globally by then.
18305,"That’s so crazy; there’s video of him at the event leaning in real close towards Kellyanne Conway, as she talks directly into his mouth."
18306,🙈
18307,a culture of common sense... i envy where you are
18308,"That number is dangerous to look at, because it is delayed by a month."
18309,From infection to death it takes about a month to die from COVID-19.
18310,In the meanwhile without restrictions the virus enjoys exponential growth and you end up with overflowing ICUs.
18311,"Realistically France will not see the full exponential curve at the moment, but I'd rather measure that on the amount of daily new cases (if testing is sufficiently available)."
18312,If no testing is available I'd measure it on the amount of people admitted to the hospital (though here we should definitely not forget that it is about the growth and not the total number of cases which might still look small).
18313,Every once in a while the simulation will throw us a curveball to see if we’re paying attention
18314,This is exactly what someone with no friends and who's not used to socializing would say.
18315,A simplistic observation based on feelings
18316,In beginning of March they took it seriously even till present.
18317,"They aggressively locked down cities when nessesary, locked down apt buildings if one person was found infected with police guard."
18318,Shut down places like clubs/bars where many people gather.
18319,"When it got bad, restaurants as well."
18320,Limit the amount of people gathering.
18321,Mandatory mask or fine.
18322,Shut down domestic travel/ busses/grab.
18323,"If you were known to have met with someone infected, required to self quarantine yourself."
18324,There's a lot more im missing but its very aggressive.
18325,Vn had two big infections and one small one.
18326,They stopped it all cold.
18327,No.
18328,Everyone needs to be wearing them.
18329,Period.
18330,People need to stop being ignorant and selfish.
18331,I just went back to work (at a gym) for the first time since March 13th.

18338,"i think there’s a very solid argument to be made that Trump dying would ultimately lead to a lot less deaths in the future, hence the gleeful hoping."
18339,"Us science believers have been told for months by conservatives that the virus is nothing to fear, and have pretty much been told that big business is more important than our elderly and immunocompromised loved ones lives."
18340,That is 100x more heinous than hoping one evil person dies
18341,3rd actually - the 1st wave was quite short and there was less than 20 cases and they were all recovered before the second wave started.

18381,"Once the trump kids are out of White House and nobody cares for them, OP's years of tension will release into a two minute fart."
18382,It is probably not so much the temperature but what kind of activity people do (inside or outside).
18383,"Argentina is only peaking now, and it's well past its coldest month, which isn't even that cold by northern hemisphere standards."
18384,"Similarly, Brazil has the second largest number of deaths, but it doesn't get cold."
18385,"One of its biggest hotspots (with highest deaths per capita) is Manaus in the middle of the Amazon, which doesn't even have hot/cold seasons."
18386,"In Latin America's case, they are densely populated slums full of poor people where diseases would spread like wild fire."
18387,"For the US, it is possible that the southern states got their biggest outbreak in the hottest months of summer (AZ, FL, TX) when people moved inside for air conditioning."

18389,"I don't know about the Indians, but their monsoon season is around June to August."
18390,Their numbers are now decreasing for seemingly no reason.

18392,Disgusting.
18393,"To whoever is still in doubt of the Vietnamese statistics: 

Unlike other countries like China, we allow Facebook, Twitter, and almost every social media."
18394,"We allow citizens to access all source of news online, and there is virtually no censorship of foreign media."

18396,So what does it mean by that?
18397,"If there is a Covid case or death, almost everyone in Vietnam will know it immediately via social media."
18398,"Most of us use Facebook or Instagram, which are AMERICAN social media sites to which the Vietnamese government cannot control."
18399,"Therefore, believe it or not, the Vietnamese government is actually under a lot more scrutiny than you could think of."
18400,"They wouldn't risk lying because of that, everyone in Vietnam would know if they lie."
18401,"And since they wouldn't risk lying about Covid-19, you know for certain that they are truthful."
18402,"In actuality, it's more reliable than whatever Western media is reporting because at least what the Vietnamese government is doing is consistent and under scrutiny of the public."
18403,"Believe it or not, we are the nation with the highest economics growth this year, and one of the only nations to which life has completely returned to normal."
18404,I say this as a Vietnamese who doesn't live in Vietnam and has full access to freedom of information.

18407,I’ve been very depressed about the 200k deaths.

18442,&gt; Does it thrive more in colder weather?
18443,"While this may not be the reason for the current increase, it is indeed a fact that Sars-Cov-2 seems to thrive and spread more in cold weather."
18444,"It can still do fine in warm and even humid weather, but it is at its peak in colder conditions."
18445,Which is why the WHO and the scientific community are concerned about this coming winter season.
18446,So no vaccine is necessary.
18447,The populations will build natural immunity here too.
18448,"That's a good news, but winter is coming."
18449,They need to be careful of another spike.
18450,I know that’s why I’m saying atleast it’s not as bad as the US.

18461,"In Ontario we might get 600 cases in a day (a notably high amount compared to our summer in the double digits), and people will see a headline that says “2 staff members infected at a local bar” and yell SHUT DOWN THE BARS."
18462,Well where’d the other 598 infections come from?
18463,Surely not from the bars and restaurants with some semblance of contact tracing that private households DONT have.
18464,"Honestly, if Trump does die from this, I really want someone to try to cover it up by doing Weekend at Bernie's with his corpse."

18542,"All the talk over confusion about Trump’s condition, I do think it’s pretty clear what happened:

He had one bad day where his vitals started trending the wrong way, and through a combination of treatment and luck he’s started getting better."
18543,"That’s about it, he’s currently headed the right direction."
18544,Is he out of the woods?

Not all of his supporters will listen, but the President taking the correct and more serious tone about the virus will do wonders, as he’s again, the President."
18548,"This is my hope, not what I actually think is likely to happen."

18594,So much so that other countries point out their toddler behavior.

18596,"They are kleptocrats, just like their heroes Putin's mob."
18597,Really?
18598,I would.
18599,Fuck being a hypochondriac
18600,"I think short answer-

They just don’t like them."
18601,It’s embarrassing to them and they think it makes them look weak.
18602,"Long answer-

The Republican Party doesn’t really have a platform anymore so they pretend to be for personal liberty and small government."
18603,"They have lost that over the years, by trying to control women’s bodies and insert religion into society."
18604,That’s not free.
18605,"They saw this as a perfect way to bring back their “freedom” ideologies by claiming that they don’t hate masks, they just dOnT tHiNk wE sHoUlD bE fOrCeD tO wEaR tHeM."

18609,I don't have the knowledge required about the german app to tell for sure.
18610,"And yes, I agree with you that Facebook and Google are far bigger threats to our freedom and privacy, but that's another topic."
18611,"Besides, the app was developed with the help of Google and Apple, the very same companies you criticize for being a data security threat."
18612,"The question people are being asked in about thirty days is literally: “do you like him or not.” The fact that his rhetoric on how Americans should feel about COVID is so different from the way he and his staff are treating it, is frankly concerning."
18613,It should certainly factor into our political decisionmaking.
18614,"I believe that they are puplicizing this issue and stirring everyone up to stop public discourse on affordable health care, where it should be."
18615,"&gt; We do have an obnoxiously loud far-right movement growing here in Canada

You'll want to keep an eye on that."
18616,"Sincerely, your neighbor to the south"
18617,"Not only that, but the information gathered from users (if in the hands of anyone unauthorized) would cause so many more problems"
18618,Yet there’s nothing new in it.
18619,Same in my office.
18620,"I wear a KN95 all day that I don’t take off at my desk, I take a short coffee/snack break outside mid morning while my coffee is still warm, and eat my lunch out of the office."
18621,"There’s very little airflow in our office, and it gets pretty loud if everyone is on the phone at the same time."
18622,"I thought 100% mask wearing would be baseline when I returned to the office, but actually it just makes me look like a crazy to my coworkers."
18623,Trump will still claim it is Obamas and Bidens fault for not having a Covid 19 test ready in that empty cupboard.
18624,This is absurd.
18625,You think dems talk about healthcare just because the right doesnt like it?
18626,They talk about it because they truly want to improve society and give healthcare to all.
18627,$15 min wage.
18628,Abolish ice.
18629,You think they're taking these positions purely as a reactionary stance?
18630,What world do you live in?
18631,"Because they didn’t just minimize, deny, politicize, or pray to ward off a pandemic and instead had a proactive, science-based approach that has been terrifically effective to the point that their reopening progress is light years ahead of the United States’ own progress."
18632,This is non scientific and just how it feels to me so take it for what it’s worth.
18633,And this is round numbers/back of the envelope stuff.
18634,I think we end 2020 at 1.45 million worldwide deaths.
18635,"It feels like 2021 will not be much better than 2020, so that means another 900,000 to a  1.1 million for 2021."
18636,As businesses and schools open the virus numbers will grow.
18637,Maybe offset with some mitigation of medications and better doctor knowledge.
18638,"That converts to a 2,500 to 3,000 per day death rate...I think we are around 4,400 a day for 2020 (rounded, and I am counting Feb thru December)."
18639,At some point medicine will help slow the virus but I don’t think there will be any magic medicines and I think rolling out the medications will be difficult and slow.
18640,Plus you have anti vaxers that will never take it.
18641,I am hopeful that some people will start to wake up regarding mask wearing and distances but I may be wrong as the stupidity abounds.
18642,Maybe once everyone has some loved one that dies they will get serious.
18643,Sad.
18644,"I am also hopeful there will be improved ventilation/virus killing systems available for indoor spaces but this takes time to test, manufacture, rollout for sale and install."
18645,I am also assuming in the USA Biden is elected and we will improve our virus mitigation measures.
18646,No doubt there will still be people that resist these measures.
18647,So when 2022 rolls around I am thinking we might start seeing light at the end of the tunnel but who knows.
18648,We could still be seeing deaths in the 300k to 600k per year if we use the estimated influenza death toll.
18649,As time goes by perhaps better vaccines are created to reduce that number further.
18650,I am not an expert on any of this.
18651,Just one man’s guess.
18652,Stay safe.
18653,😷
18654,I felt the exact same way when I thought that.
18655,"Weird how they never think God gave them the rona to begin with, though."
18656,Check to see if your public library has free access to course sites with a card!
18657,Sometimes there's lots of great stuff for free.
18658,You forgot pro life as long as it's before birth.
18659,Even antibodies don't cost 200EUR.
18660,That's 2093kr.
18661,Even online private antibody tests costs 800kr.
18662,The ones provided by the hospital (not all regions have them yet) costs between 0 to 470kr (that's 44EUR) depending on which region you live in.
18663,PCR tests are free.
18664,"I'm sure there is private tests you can order online but if you need to that, you are being scammed."
18665,"Well, if you're in Germany, I totally get not wanting to move until this blows over!"
18666,"/s, of course"
18667,I think it is clear that Mary's little white lie to save Joseph's ego got out of control.

18669,"Vaccines are slow to produce and distribute, it's not like in the movies."
18670,"There are a few vaccines in the works that could quickly scale up production (mRNA vaccines), but they're not the among this first round of new vaccines."
18671,The Moderna vaccine is like that and they're in phase 3: https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/moderna-s-coronavirus-vaccine-won-t-be-ready-for-before-late-november-ceo-says-ft .
18672,"They could get an emergency approval by the end of the year and that would lead to  limited distribution, so maybe spring."
18673,But this is all optimistic; there can be surprises and we don't even know the efficacy.
18674,So I'm going with: there may be accessible vaccines to a lot of people on the planet by this time next year.
18675,"&gt;[The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification."
18676,"These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions."
18677,"Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat."
18678,"The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use, including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control."

18680,lasting antibodies and full spectrum t cell protection?
18681,My sister is likely one of them.
18682,Scary stuff.
18683,"With Trump (and many other republicans) basically being the poster boy for toxic masculinity, all of his decisions seem to center around the thought of “how can I portray myself to be as manly as any man can get”?"
18684,So being afraid of a teeny tiny virus does not fit this narrative and wearing a mask is basically the visual acknowledgment of accepting that Covid is dangerous.
18685,"Whatever it is you’re panicking about, I’m sure it will be fine in two weeks."
18686,Or at least old news.
18687,What county can I look up to learn about the ICUs in crisis?
18688,LOL.
18689,The last sentence actually made me laugh out loud.
18690,"""Georgia is leading Auburn, 10-0, on ESPN."""
18691,- Just to end on a good note I guess.

18693,"If you are one of the very, very few people in the world that have followed every single rule always, then you can throw stones."
18694,"Otherwise, look after the glasshouse."
18695,"I can assure you, I have 0 respect for the President of the United States of America."
18696,At this point it's akin to seeing a red nametag over an enemy in a video game.

18714,"People who are scared, that’s fine, stay home, but people who want to get back to normal can go, that’s their choice - I’ve heard that almost verbatim from many people."
18715,"What they don’t realize is that everyone’s personal choices will affect others during this pandemic, and if we allow full reopenings, the virus will inevitably spread more, even to the cautious people, and if only half the population wears masks, same thing."
18716,Their “personal choice” will directly cause harm but they don’t seem to care.
18717,Individual freedom and control is more important.

18736,Right now in my section of the building there's only three other people but if the building was full it would normally be able to hold 30 in that area (just about everyone went WFH back in March/April).
18737,"I only sit next to one person directly (the cube next to me), and I've given him enough crap that I think the majority of the time he wears his mask."
18738,The other two people that are probably 15' &amp; 25' away and definitely don't wear their masks when they are at their cubes.
18739,"Policy in my building is only people in office's can remove their masks, but of course no one is around to enforce it anywhere else."
18740,"It's a pretty big area and well ventilated, so I don't feel as worried (or maybe I just tell myself that so I don't freak out)."

18758,Double positives on both means you are most definitely sick.
18759,"The negative accuracy of the rapid antigen test is about the same, but that's because someone can test negative in the early stages of the disease."

19081,"In fact, in almost all of America, it was **worse** at the time the lockdown ended than it was when the lockdown started."
19082,"If you had any understand of the science behind a pandemic, you never ""unlocked"" you life anyway."
19083,"So since mid-Feb, we've WFH as much as possible (me 100%, her 90% except for stuff that can't be done outside of a lab), done curbside for groceries and every single other thing we can, done 0 socializing in other people's homes or with other people in our home, worn masks 100% of the time in public, not eaten a single meal we didn't cook at home, etc."
19084,"So, if things go ""back"" on lockdown, absolutely nothing changes for us because the things that made lockdown necessary never left so we never stopped lockdown."
19085,"""I don't know that person""

::cue photo of Trump shaking person's hand at a function a month prior::

He's exhibited confusion and amnesia throughout his presidency."
19086,Fun fact: everyone who gets discharged from the hospital dies.
19087,"On a more serious note, Trump *is* the president."
19088,He could go to the middle of the Saharan desert and still have access to world-class medical care.
19089,It's ridiculous to think that his doctors have just given up.
19090,Sure Jan.
19091,Bout to start a coffin business
19092,Not everyone is a hermit like you must be.
19093,No one except hermits can keep this up permanently.
19094,Some of you live in some alternate reality.
19095,A conservative says socialism is bad.
19096,A liberal comes along and automatically is going to counter with it being positive.
19097,Don't believe me?
19098,Go over to /r/politics and pick a popular thread.
19099,Post a sentence or two about how wrong AOC is for promoting a socialistic/communistic brand of politics in the time of an election.
19100,See if there is any pushback.
19101,I found [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1312819158686543874) pretty enlightening.
19102,"But if you’ve been vaccinated, can you still act as a vector and make other people sick?"
19103,Can’t help but think of Donald Trump anxiously looking for breast milk to drink.
19104,The recommendation is to be tested 5 days following exposure for the maximum opportunity for the test to give an accurate result.
19105,It's not me saying this idiot.
19106,I'm just playing devil's advocate.
19107,You need to grow up and stop being rude.
19108,Do you really think so?
19109,"Like honestly, I’m not very well informed with American politics (and global politics tbh) and I haven’t followed the ‘recent’ happenings between Russia and the US."
19110,Is that really what’s happened here?
19111,Our tax system works on fraudulent write offs?
19112,Weird.
19113,"Don't worry, either way, the truth will come out now that he is being investigated on the state level."
19114,"If he is innocent, he will be redeemed."
19115,"If he is guilty, then persecuted."
19116,"The question is, will his supporters hold him accountable if he is guilty of tax evasion and not merely just an intelligent tax avoider?"
19117,"Party of law and order, right?"
19118,"Laugh all you want but I bet you guys weren't making this argument when Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs got bailed out in 2008, or when American and United got billions to keep them from going into bankruptcy."
19119,Or when businesses got trillions in emergency covid-19 relief.
19120,They literally gave small businesses TRILLIONS of dollars.
19121,"I didn't seem to hear many people saying ""BuT wHo'S PaYiNg ThEM"" back then."
19122,The federal reserve just printed it.
19123,But you reddit losers feel the need to make snide comments based on misunderstanding of macroeconomic principles to make yourselves feel good.
19124,"Oh, don't get me wrong, we'll be feeling the impact of all this for a while to come."
19125,But at least I'll be able to give my pal a hug if he loses his job.
19126,There’s a spit test
19127,I don’t know.
19128,It depends on how things shake out.
19129,"If the vaccine is effective and we gain lasting immunity, we might go more or less back to the way things were: mostly healthy, dealing with isolated outbreaks."
19130,"If the vaccine is effective but we don’t have lasting immunity, it might involve annual flu shots."
19131,"If vaccine isn’t super effective, we might need to keep the masks and live with some level of restriction for a long time."
19132,"May years, maybe forever."
19133,"If the vaccine is ineffective, or comes with some kind of intolerable side effect that we’ve missed so far... maybe Zoom forever."
19134,"That seems unlikely, tho."
19135,"Reality (the objective kind, not the ""alternate facts"" kind) has a well-known liberal bias."
19136,I got through the first one playing games online with my friends and talking on teamspeak.
19137,"Same thing will happen this fall, more than likely."
19138,"I guess that’s why I’ve been so minimally affected by all this, despite normally struggling with depression."
19139,The only major issue is the anxiety.
19140,I’m scared of catching this thing despite taking every precaution.
19141,"Or scared of having some kind of unexpected medical problem and catching it in the hospital, or not being able to get a hospital bed because of all the sick people who took no precautions."
19142,"Or worse, what if my kid gets hurt playing and needs medical care, and catches it in the hospital?"
19143,So much anxiety.
19144,"Yes, they worked worked with Apple and Google."
19145,But I already use their products so it was not a dealbreaker for me.
19146,Which does not mean I agree with this.
19147,I just think it would be strange to use those products in private and refuse the Corona App which is meant to help the fight against the pandemic.
19148,Also the intelligence service already do well in surveillance around the world.
19149,I don't think they would have the need to do it via the Corona App.
19150,But I am not big into Software so I can just repeat what I read andy personal opinion on it.
19151,Are you me?
19152,We've been taken hostage.
19153,Our vote now boils down to whether we want the government to govern or want it to harm out-groups.
19154,Policy is out the window.
19155,"To be fair you could say the same for any political party, politics has boiled down to rivalry and arguing for the sake of arguing."
19156,I think Barron Trump might be running this show and we are all Sims characters in his universe
19157,[Briefing by dr. conley scheduled to start at 11:30 eastern ](https://twitter.com/josh_wingrove/status/1312770899729317888?s=20)
19158,Sweden doesn't have much freedom.
19159,"Everything is heavily restricted, the regular Joe is dirt poor."
19160,"""The freedom to not wear a mask"", a strange form of unholy alliance between Swedish latte sippers and American right wing populists."
19161,"No, but why would I be a ""trumper"" when I can't vote for him."
19162,Atl represented.
19163,Way to delete your comment lmao
19164,Thanks brother.
19165,If you would like I would be more than happy to hear of your situation?
19166,I will admit I do feel bad for those elderly and those alone who really are suffering.
19167,There are definitely still things that I cannot do which I wish I could during Covid.
19168,I make no light of a dire situation.
19169,Much love brother
19170,It hasn’t been distributed yet
19171,It was oddly easy to pick out the trumpets in my office when the mask mandate came along earlier this decade
19172,This is a reminder that when Trump talks about the country he only means within a mile radius around himself.
19173,"“We have testing, we have so much testing, some people say we have too much testing” makes sense for an old man being swabbed daily."
19174,Hello fellow Atlanta person
19175,Nap time
19176,My “we’re living in a low budget movie who couldn’t pay for better writers” stat went up like 20
19177,Meatball sandwich!
19178,!
19179,Oh they also put in some terrible judges that will fuck with the peoples will for decades to come!
19180,Thanks guys!
19181,I belive you are talking about ICU and not regular hospitalization.
19182,"The thing is while in Bergamo province this 40% is plausible, 500 Miles to the south we aren't near to the 5% and that is scary since numbers there are going up quite rapidly."
19183,He still recommended to inject disinfectant.
19184,He also kept pushing hydroxychloroquine.
19185,Which has time and time again been proven NOT to be the end all cure (and irony isn't it that he is taking redemsvir?
19186,"Almost as if the actual doctors know what he is doing) 

This is the guy also who completely has destroyed out science committee by gutting every department in the field we have."
19187,"Not to mention:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/13/president-trump-has-made-more-than-20000-false-or-misleading-claims/

He kinda has a history of literally saying wrong things."
19188,Indonesia
19189,The fact that you think the Government would just give handouts to everyone just like that shows how deluded you are.
19190,"If giving everyone food, and fucking VR equipment was that easy, we wouldn't have problems like hunger in our society anyway."
19191,"The government doesn't just give you stuff, that's not how it works."
19192,The economy is only going to be worse from lockdown so the idea of everyone being given free food and VR is even more unlikely.
19193,Yes there's dear mongering articles on it.
19194,I'd rather wait until there's studies done or direct proof that there are long lasting effects.
19195,"I'm sure any disease can leave you with long lasting effects in rare cases, but in everyone?"
19196,No.
19197,I know two people who had COVID.
19198,Both are fine and back in work.
19199,One even works in hospital.
19200,Arguing with you is like talking to a brick wall so I don't know why I'm bothering.
19201,It's an election year.
19202,"The pandemic is very, very damaging to the  economy which was what the Republicans had intended to run on as a main focus."
19203,"Polling showed that people didn't like lockdowns or having to wear masks (I mean, yeah, people don't like getting sick or dying either...but whatever)."
19204,"The president's handling of the pandemic doesn't poll well  (I mean, some people might argue you could fix this by handling the pandemic better...), and having to wear a mask is a physical reminder that there's a pandemic on."
19205,But only when it suits them.
19206,"They voted for a TON of government interference into their personal lives after 9/11, and in some cases are still fine with having their individual rights stomped on as long as it’s by a republican politician."
19207,LOL legit can’t get if this is sarcasm
19208,No.
19209,That's not how science works.
19210,You need evidence to make a claim.
19211,"There are an infinite number of baseless claims, it's not possible to *disprove* every one of them."
19212,The one making the claim needs to provide the proof.
19213,As an avowed atheist I totally acknowledge that if there were a scientific consensus in favour of the existence of a god then I would accept it.
19214,Any educated atheist should agree.
19215,"That's totally different than an agnostic position, which gives equal weight to the existence or non-existence of a god, despite all evidence being on the side of non-existence."
19216,"I think it's just as simple as ""you can't tell me what to do!"
19217,"I have my freedumbs"""
19218,"Maybe it's not the ""stab yourself in the brain"" type of swab, but the one that you just put in your nasal cavity and rotate for 15-20 seconds."
19219,"If it is the deep nasal cavity type, then I agree, people would most likely not self administer properly because it's super uncomfortable."
19220,"This is a regular watch for me, I suggest this “podcast” to a lot of people."
19221,"My friends are actually really good for the most part, but I have to limit FB because it makes me sad and angry over how much everyone else is fucking this up and how much I miss people."
19222,"I still check in on the weekends after missing news about a friend's passing, but I disable the app during the week to try and focus on what I do have."
19223,"Which right now is my quarantine garden, long work days, and slowly binging all of Star Trek."
19224,"I wish I could game, but work is so many computer hours right now the last thing my poor sedentary body wants to do is touch a computer on my off time!"
19225,Trump told everyone not to wear mask from the start.
19226,Pretended covid wasnt serious.
19227,Republicans are doubling down on stupid at this point because our president defunded obamas pandemic plan.
19228,Hes to blame for all this...
19229,It means you should still follow basic precautions like wearing a mask and continuing to isolate after a known exposure even if you have a negative test.
19230,And yes get multiple tests over time for certain situations.
19231,These rapid tests were never meant to be used to avoid all other precautions.
19232,"They were a quick way to catch some of the cases, including asymptomatic cases, to help contact trace and slow down the spread."
19233,But basically we should all be assuming we have it and everyone else has it for the foreseeable future when it comes to mask wearing and other preventative measures.
19234,Georgia?
19235,Kemp is an POS
19236,It’s criminal negligence at the very least.
19237,Now you're just speaking above your own head and trying to garner credibility... Why can't the universe just exist same with life.
19238,I'm at the point where I'm certain life exist on any planet with an atmosphere due to the known existence of extremophiles on earth.
19239,Earth just happens to be carbon based...
19240,Fascism thrives on bullshit.
19241,Idk why you’re being downvoted since a lot of people will be thinking this if Trump comes out of the hospital in good health.
19242,If only this were more common in the US.
19243,People seem to think science and belief in god are mutually exclusive.
19244,"My point is not that they aren't gender based rights but that they are supported based on religious beliefs, regardless of gender, i.e."
19245,women who are pro-life.
19246,In fact I'd wager more women are pro-life than men.
19247,"Your being controlled by your own will but ok. :-)

Have a great day"
19248,Get that cancer irradiated early
19249,"I wonder if part of it is that the Chinese wear them without complaining, and it’s something that’s become common there..lI know other Asian countries do too, but China is one place they definitely don’t want to be seen emulating."
19250,You went outside?
19251,Murderer!!!!
19252,/s
19253,"I think it's because Trump started off downplaying the virus as a hoax and not a big deal so anyone wearing mask, social distancing or going into lockdown was ""overreacting""."
19254,When democratic governors started issuing lockdown orders republicans were complaining about all the damage these safety measure would do the the economy.
19255,Next thing you know following medical advise is suddenly a divisive political issue.
19256,One Republican Senator.
19257,No records set in Sweden.
19258,Still among the lowest amount of infected per capita.
19259,It can but much less likely.
19260,"Visors, shop glasses, or goggles are good to protect the eyes."
19261,Visors do next to nothing to spot spread in an indoor setting though without a mask.
19262,The two beliefs don't have to be mutually exclusive.
19263,I felt so defeated yesterday.
19264,Feel better now.
19265,"But man, it’s so hard to not think about it."
19266,I think you meant to post this to r/theboys
19267,They've fucked themselves.
19268,"Their base is absolutely rabid about masks because of the propaganda they whipped up, now there's no real way to change their mind."
19269,90% of the actions of conservatives are just reactions to the lies they had to create to get in power.
19270,Theres lots of info in there if you read it.
19271,It's called a contrarian mentality.
19272,"&gt;Contrarian
Some people are just 'ornery, as others might say."
19273,You tell them to do one thing and they go and do the opposite.
19274,It is often that they need to assert their identity or maintain control by deciding things for themselves.
19275,They may even see any attempt at persuasion as a form of coercion.
19276,"&gt;A lot of teenagers tend to fall into the Contrarian camp, especially if the other person is a parent or anyone in authority."
19277,"When their hormones are telling them to grow up and leave home, they will push against anything that tries to set a direction for them."
19278,&gt;'Reverse psychology' is a popular term for what you do with contrarians.
19279,Suggest they do the opposite of what you want them to do.
19280,"This can, of course, get tricky when they realize what you are doing."
19281,"Another variant is to tell them that someone else wants them to do something, especially someone they do not particularly like."
19282,&gt;Conformists will just want to do what you want - just so long as they like you and you are in their list of people to follow.
19283,So make friends and ask nicely.
19284,"You can also point out objective rules and laws, or note how important it is to other people that they conform."
19285,"&gt;White House Completely Misused Rapid COVID-19 Tests to Avoid Face Masks

Your tax dollars at work maintaining the illusion of safety."
19286,Tests used to 'downplay' a pandemic and mislead Americans.
19287,This approach has led to the most deaths and the worst response on planet Earth.
19288,[removed]
19289,I think we got easy and available testing started too late.
19290,The White House did something else stupid with relation to COVID?
19291,Color me surprised.
19292,Why am I getting flashbacks to the President's speech from The Stand?
19293,&gt;Humans exhibit logical fallacies whether religious or not.
19294,"Agreed, but if someone points out that I believe something solely on fallacious argument, I will do everything in my power to dismiss that belief."
19295,&gt;I'm not them but I do not enjoy living my life with some sort of spiritual component.
19296,And that is a fallacious argument.
19297,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but  think it can be written as:

I enjoy having a spiritual component in my life and would be burned out if it did not exist, therefore there is a spiritual component."
19298,That is an appeal to consequence.
19299,"&gt;That's not how that works

And yet it does."
19300,I have not yet met a person that believed in god and did not believe something else as a consequence of it.
19301,"A person that believes in a god and does not believe its existence affects the material in some way is rare, to say the least."
19302,Miracles?
19303,Karma?
19304,Morality?
19305,Life after death?
19306,all those are beliefs affected by the belief in god.
19307,"I suppose an exception could be made about deists, but even then I'm not sure."
19308,Yeah not sure if that's the right call (army of doctors) what kind of statement is that?
19309,Are they trying to say     we are doing everything we can to save his life?
19310,Who is actually at the president's side while this parade is going on outside?
19311,A janitor?
19312,To our friends in the great white north: Squash your alt righters while you have the chance.
19313,"I love the poorly educated

-DJT"
19314,"Yeah, they’ve jumped on the individual rights bandwagon because they need something to argue about."
19315,Yep.
19316,10 doctors.
19317,You too can have a fighting chance if you have 10 of the top doctors in the US working on you.
19318,Insurance does not equal care.
19319,If you have insurance with high deductibles that costs you a lot--like many on Obamacare--you might as well have no insurance.
19320,Glad we’ve finally accepted there are treatments for covid instead of attacking any such claim as ’Russian propaganda’
19321,[removed]
19322,So they accomplished all of their actual legislative goals!
19323,&gt;So then there wasn't going to be.
19324,There was going to be if he agree.
19325,You just lied again.
19326,&gt;Trump saying anything doesn't mean shit when he lies constantly.
19327,All politicians lie constantly.
19328,Including Biden.
19329,But he didn't lie here.
19330,He called for everyone to be drug tested.
19331,That's not a lie.
19332,"&gt;This is a man that said he would release his tax returns 

He said ""I will release them when the audit is done""

He hasn't contradicted that, as the audit is not done."
19333,You just lied again.
19334,"&gt;If a drug test were to actually happen only Biden would be tested

That's a lie."
19335,Him and his team have been calling for BOTH to be tested for a month.
19336,&gt;Lol.
19337,Now this is desperation.
19338,You can't handle the fact that for every major presidential debate in history every single candidate except yours came off as not being a fucking idiot.
19339,Then you haven't seen any previous presidential debates.
19340,Politicians have literally attacked people in the past.
19341,&gt;Name one.
19342,I just named your lies specifically.
19343,"&gt;And don't ignore the part of what I said that you didn't feel like quoting

What part?"
19344,If you don't think Biden is taking Drugs then why do you think they were afraid to be tested?
19345,Only a guilty person does that.
19346,We said that during the primaries against Bernie Sandars as well.
19347,Compare his performances.
19348,"&gt; The White House may have ignored that little crucial fact about the test that can give results in 15 minutes, but it wasn’t exactly hidden."
19349,"When the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization for Abbott’s ID Now test, it made clear that it was to be used “within the first seven days of symptoms.” When it is used in people who don’t have symptoms, it can give a false negative in as many as 1 in 3 cases

Who could've ever predicted that following scientist's advice would've prevented what we're going through?"
19350,"Using plague as a political tool is, unfortunately, hardly new."
19351,"Small pox blankets to the American natives who had no immunity, launching corpses into walled cities under siege--using illness or other calamity as a convenient means to weaken opponents has a looooong historical track record."
19352,"I'm not sure ""herd immunity"" is the right word for it, but cases seem to plateau after a certain percent infected."
19353,"Of course, that plateau point is dependent on the precautions everyone is taking."
19354,That's why you see close to 100% infected in prisons and cruise ships where there's no social distancing.
19355,"When lockdown measures ease up and people start taking the virus less seriously, the required percent previously infected to see a plateau in cases will go up."
19356,Um their God king doesn't like them.
19357,"Therefore, they don't like them."
19358,This is not the logic of a normal group of people.
19359,I was thinking Athens.
19360,Sounds like some Kemp shit.
19361,Thank you for your wonderful attitude.
19362,"May your TV be filled with enlightenment and entertainment, your bud always be dank, and your beautiful home always be filled with the love that exudes from your post today."
19363,"People like you may not have the power to save people like me from the virus, but it makes the days I do have so much more precious to know that you care enough to do the very best you can and to find the positives in the situation."
19364,"I've been an essential employee, as a third party vendor through all of this."
19365,"Some hour cuts, but that's fine."
19366,I'm getting by.
19367,"Barely, but."
19368,"I stay home, try and get to my massive backlog of games and only ever go out to get groceries/essential items."
19369,I too don't understand the people who need to eat at a sit down restaurant.
19370,"I've started to cook more meals at home, and try and plan out meals."
19371,I'd much rather learn new meals than sit down (especially now that restaurants are at full capacity in Ohio) with someone 1 foot away from my back/side.
19372,"If I do order out, I order doordash but that's not often."
19373,"Got myself a VR headset during the pandemic and actually enjoyed using Google maps and other such things to go exploring, or play a game in a new way."
19374,"It's been exciting, and really good for my own mental health."
19375,Our state Supreme Court said asking people to stay home and wear masks is not constitutional.
19376,It's not?
19377,Since when?
19378,"Well now their platform is, nothing but more nothing"
19379,I didn’t ask where you were from?
19380,Of *course* we should lockdown again!
19381,Especially with the recent superspreading event.
19382,This is to be expected.
19383,The cases graph will look like a shark's mouth.
19384,Alternating between peaks and troughs.
19385,"Therefore, it is *imperative* that we are *quick* to lock down (I'm looking at u, GA) whenever case counts are too high, and also not to reopen too much."
19386,In some conservative areas before my state had a mandate you would regularly get looks from people where they clearly saw you as the problem for wearing a mask.
19387,Now that there is a mandate there is a below the nose crowd that wears them in protest.
19388,The same people pull them down to speak with people or chin them regularly.
19389,"&gt; some of you

It's a lot more than 'some of us' in the world."
19390,;)
19391,&gt;&gt;	Can anyone explain why they seem to hate masks so much?
19392,Is it a sign of weakness?

19397,I personally would not travel by train right now if I had such a trip ahead of me.
19398,"The German railroad service has problems with people not wearing masks ""because they are eating"" (for approximately the whole duration of the trip) and seats are not blocked to distance."
19399,You have no control over if there is a person next to you and if they will wear masks or not.
19400,I wouldn't recommend it.
19401,Save your adventure for another time and take the plane.
19402,Explanation: Because trump wanted them too.
19403,Trump polls best with working class white men without college degrees.

19414,"Like ""if the president wasn't safe, then how could a mask keep you safe?"

19416,We’re showing the President the exact same respect he has for the role.

19431,"I've tried every mask under the sun, until I found KF94's that I liked."

19445,I work for a healthcare organization and we had a presentation about this from upper management.
19446,"If our patients lose their insurance, we could be busier than usual but still lose money because Medicare pays way less than private insurance."

19451,"Well, glad that worked out for them."

19453,I disagree.
19454,"A cloth mask doesn't protect you each individual setting, but if everyone wears one, it reduces potential particles in the air, which should cut down on overall infection, reduce R0 , and I theory stop the spread."
19455,"So again, a cloth mask doesn't make you immune like many seem too think, but it does help the overall situation of spread."
19456,And since “leftists” seem to pursue higher education......
19457,I'm in the same boat in regards to not noticing the symptoms.
19458,"I have multiple chronic illnesses, and if I get Covid and don't lose my sense of smell or taste, I may not notice until it's too late because all the other symptoms are things I live with every day."
19459,"When you have headaches every day, you won't notice the brain tumor until you're dead."
19460,"&gt; It's like so much with covid, we're trying to pick the best of two crappy options."
19461,The winning move is not to chose either option.
19462,Covid is possible to get under control.
19463,"Thailand, Germany, China, Vietnam, Italy, Japan, are all large countries, each with over 50 million residents, that have all gotten Covid under control."
19464,"So instead of pretending there are only two shitty options, we should be learning from these countries on how to deal with the problem."
19465,This is from a German news channel on how China reacted to the outbreak in Beijing.
19466,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yArDaBN2tw0

19472,"&gt; The Abbott Laboratories test was used to test staff and others who came in contact with the president as a filter, and those who tested negative proceeded to go about their day without masks and with few other precautions."
19473,"&gt; When the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization for Abbott’s ID Now test, it made clear that it was to be used “within the first seven days of symptoms.” When it is used in people who don’t have symptoms, it can give a false negative in as many as 1 in 3 cases

19477,Kinda.
19478,"But they get power by *convincing people to vote for them with populist ideas*, as opposed to rigging the system with voter suppression, gerrymandering, and stacking the courts."

19493,"I am just as concerned that he is just looking to be able to produce a few negative tests (in whatever way) so that he can go back to rallys, fundraisers and being ""out with the people"" like he bragged about in his last video."
19494,He will not be quarantined and he will use the experimental treatment as the justification to  not follow protocol.
19495,He does not fear being sued down the line for infecting people because he is sued routinely and considers it a cost of business.
19496,It will not only set the example that as soon as you feel better you can go right back to being out in public around others but it will also ease peoples fears of not having an effective treatment.
19497,"The common saying is ""a vaccine or effective treatment""."
19498,This will be used as proof of an effective treatment meaning everything can reopen and people can stop wearing masks and distancing.

I don’t think additional words are needed here."
19515,This dude is getting COVID-19 100% and may not survive.

19518,You must live in a developing nation?

19521,The fact that we are draining the swamps
19522,"I understood your point but I don't think you did mine or you seem to have skirted around it, and maybe you are the one making it black and white acting like all wet markets are the same."
19523,I thought I made it clear it wasn't black and white.
19524,I've also been to wet markets abroad that people actually depend on for food where live animals were kept and they were nothing like the one in Wuhan.
19525,My point was the wet market in Wuhan is not the same as a bush meat market in Africa or most other wet markets in the world.
19526,It wasn't a place for poor farmers and poor people in general.
19527,It was a place for middle class people to get exotic meat- many of the animals were imported (they had porcupines from North America for example) and several of them were endangered species.
19528,Your acting like all wet markets are the same and serve the same purpose.
19529,They don't.
19530,There are lots of different kinds of wet markets in the world.
19531,It's not the same to go into the jungle and get bush meat and sell it locally as to import hundreds exotic animals and capture exotic animals and butcher them all in a crowded space by the thousands.
19532,It's as different as night and day.
19533,The market in Wuhan was like Costco.
19534,China has the infrastructure to do the right thing.
19535,"Even in a lot of the poorest countries in Africa, they still ban the sell of endangered species and a lot of them do a decent job at trying to enforce it (though struggle)."
19536,I agree with your second paragraph except for the part about the animal sales being pushed into densely populated areas like Wuhan-  that is making a big assumption and that doesn't seem to be what happened there at all.
19537,"Illegal animal sales have been going on in the city for a long time in many countries because it's a great place to make money, it has little to do with deforestation and I don't think it was ever a solely rural thing in the first place."
19538,"If a city allows it, it will happen, especially under the guise of traditional medicine."
19539,"See, I don't see why we can't still say fuck these certain kinds of wet markets even if they aren't the sole cause of pandemic diseases (though they are linked to at least a few)."
19540,There is no reason to give them a pass- even if Coronavirus didn't come from the one in Wuhan.
19541,"Even Neil Degrasse Tyson had a StarTalk about it and had experts discuss it, and how nobody should be eating pangolins."

19543,"And everyone knows, only millionaires are REAL 'Murrikkkans."
19544,There really isn't.
19545,Unpopular opinion: Yes the right has handled this horribly.
19546,"At the same time, this Reddit has gotten so toxic, no one can maturely state their opinion anymore."
19547,No one can state their opinion without aggressively insulting someone and feeling self-righteous.
19548,This is the other thing I really hate about where the world is going.

19582,"To calculate the actual cost of both plans, it is very hard to measure all the factors."
19583,"I think it is best to look at it in terms of cost for the average person to lockdown, which is less than the usual cost of living."

19746,Should work out well.
19747,The US has a way  bigger police force than vietnam per capita and in sheer numbers
19748,I expect that Trump will be true to his completely narcissist pattern.
19749,He will recover.
19750,"Then, he will think, ""I am immune now, so I don't have to care, at all."""
19751,"Then, he will actually forbid masks and testing, for the entire government (unless he can profit from it in some way)."
19752,"There was going to be one, but Team Biden refused"

19756,Having spent quite a bit of time in Redding recently I can say that almost everyone I see is wearing a mask while indoors.
19757,"Sure some of the guys at the hardware store are a little more resistant, but almost everyone is wearing them while inside."
19758,Now if they are outside by themselves walking down the street there is no mask.
19759,While they could improve slightly I think they have a pretty good approach to it.
19760,The daily case count in Redding has been relatively low since the beginning.
19761,"Ehh people are a bunch of babies, they don't want to wear masks, because boo hoo uncomfortable thing scary!"
19762,Is it in any way possible that researchers could come up with a breathalyzer type test for covid?
19763,The swap up the nose measures the infection in that area but I would imagine it's not particularly pleasant for most people to do.
19764,But blowing into a bag designed to measure infection from the lungs seems like it would be a lot easier for most people to do.

19823,Friday October 2.

19825,"He may require intubation if he gets worse, which is beyond what the WH infirmary is reported to be able to handle."
19826,The decision is made to transfer him to Walter Reed while he can still walk short distances without oxygen.
19827,The optics of him being taken by stretcher would end his campaign right there.
19828,Trump releases a 17 second video of himself talking alone in a room.
19829,"Presumably, no one else wants to be in the room with him without a mask."

19849,Please feel free to copy/paste this to other threads.
19850,"I mean, like him or not, he's the president of the united states."
19851,Of course he's going to get medical treatment that's available to very few people on this planet.
19852,And Netherlands almost 4k cases with 17 million population.

20228,"Excess deaths due to lack of IC-capacity amounts to several hundred *at most* according to Ira Helsloot (a professor of the Governance of Safety and Security), compared to tens -possibly hundreds- of *thousands* that could die due to long term side-effects of the *lockdowns*."

20230,Except this second wave is based on the thousands and thousands of tests that are being done each day.
20231,"Each of these tests has a false positive rate, which might make up for anywhere between 1/6th (optimistic estimates) and the supermajority (&gt;50%, pessimistic estimates) of ""cases"" that are announced in the news (this increases linearly with how many people are being tested, *not* how many are actually a 'case')."
20232,"With 160 people in the ICU, we aren't even *close* to being at capacity, let alone ""flu-season"" level."
20233,"In fact, the level is rather insignificant, as is the current daily death toll and both have been like this or lower for the past *months* with less strict lockdowns."
20234,"Yet somehow any criticism against lockdowns is ""out of this world nonsense""."
20235,Mask mandates are good.
20236,Capacity limits in public places were fine as well.
20237,"The original lockdown was a good idea poorly executed, in large part due to mixed messaging and shifting goalposts as to the stated goals causing a lack of confidence in public health authorities."

20257,It's not a right wing vs left wing issue inherently; other right wing leaders have had no issue supporting wearing masks.

20319,No.
20320,I was in a different state so I had no insurance.

20322,It was at Mercy hospital in San Diego.

20324,"Staff there, aside from the actual doctor, weren't the nicest."
20325,"I'm pretty sure that finding it somewhat difficult to breathe is supposed to move you up in the queue, but I wasn't on the floor gasping for air so I just had to wait."
20326,I'm terrified.
20327,"Two days ago, when they announced his negative results it was 9:22am PT."
20328,There's still nothing about his test today.
20329,"I'm someone who jumps to the worst conclusion, so maybe don't listen to me, but I think the best guess is that he had an initial positive and now they're getting the best tests possible to confirm."
20330,This is the most fucked up thing I have read.
20331,As someone who thinks nordic countries are the last bastion of reason this brings me down to reality a bit and resets my expectations.
20332,This being downvoted is a Reddit moment lmao.
20333,Hopefully they had people who already had and recovered from it... because that’s just obnoxious.
20334,"It looked like everyone in the vehicle including him have masks on, but still."

20372,"That's a bunch of hogwash, Grilledcheesedr."
20373,This is all true.
20374,I was deeply saddened to see the herd behavior in this beautiful country that make people follow only the indications from the government and ignore the international scientific debate.
20375,"To me it is obvious any local neo-liberal government acts according to interests that are not just for the immediate health of the individual, but also for the economy as a whole."
20376,"It is also surprising that people around me in Rotterdam -  in a ""so called"" very good neighborhood with ""highly educated"" people - keep saying to this day that masks are useless, ignoring also the difference between non-medical masks and n95, ffp2, and so on, which protect the wearer also if others do not wear them (whereas non-medical masks, while still better than nothing, become more useful when most people wear them)."
20377,"When explained how these things work, they almost always answer, ""but you are not a doctor"" or ""the RIVM is not saying this""."
20378,"As a result, I contracted the virus and passed 2 scary days where I feared for my life, followed by over 2 months of health problems."
20379,"I had scheduled a visit for an unrelated procedure at the hospital, and I went there wearing a non-surgical mask (believing other people would be doing so) and to my surprise, I was the only one of 2-3 visitors with a mask."

20389,"brb, proposing this to our project manager"
20390,"Basically, there are way too many variables that could influence the false positive or false negative rate of a test to know whether any individual patient will have the same probability of false positives or false negatives as the general population."
20391,"A demonstrative example: suppose you are ""testing"" people for old age."
20392,You do a large series of trials of a new test where you can determine if someone is old based on their hair color.
20393,"In your study, you determine that white hair is indicative of oldness."
20394,"Across 60,000 participants, you determine your false positive rate (young people with white hair) was 0.3% and false negative rate (old people without white hair) was 10%."
20395,"Now, jake comes in."
20396,"Jake is 76 and has salty brown hair (some white, some brown)."
20397,You take a hair to run the test.
20398,The chance of a false negative might be like 50% because of his mixed hair color.
20399,"You run 30 tests, 18 are positive, 12 are negative."
20400,The test fails to determine if he is old.
20401,Now paula comes in.
20402,"She is 25 but has albanism, so all her hair is white."
20403,"You run 12 tests on her, and 11 of them are positive."
20404,Tge twelfth one was subject to a manufacturing defect and told you a white hair was not white.
20405,This is technically 11 false positives and one true negative that was actually a fluke.
20406,Now garth comes in.
20407,He is super old and has no hair.
20408,You run 15 tests on him and they all come up (falsely) negative.
20409,"So these are very simplistic examples and should not be taken too far, but hopefully it's clear that because we dont necessarily know WHY the false positives and negatives are coming up, there's no way we can be sure if the rates of errors are the same for each individual."
20410,"In all the cases above, running more tests doesn't give more information, because when scientists determine error rates they had giant sample sizes."
20411,The tests are still useful but very rarely can they be used in isolation to make a diagnosis.
20412,"That said, SOME tests are 'industry standards' and are so reliable they can almost be used alone to diagnose, however symptoms and risk factors should ALWAYS be considered."
20413,"Edit: also if a test could be made better by running it multiple times, with an error rate of 35 percent it would be daft to make a single run test."
20414,Just make a single test that takes two samples and runs across multiple sets of reagents.
20415,"Also, if all you need is more sample and reagent, the test should just be bigger."
20416,That's part of the development process.

20440,"No lockdowns were ever intended to be permanent, or even until COVID passed."
20441,The idea of all of them was to slow the spread of the virus long enough to build the health care capacity to handle the millions and millions of patients uncontrolled spread would ultimately produce.
20442,But that didn't happen nationally because of reasons I'm not permitted to talk about in this subreddit.

20465,There was a lockdown for weeks and the hospitalisations were still going up and then the lockdown worked as it does in every other instance in every other country.
20466,What's your point?
20467,Because according to these experts the lockdowns do nothing so maybe we should see this time what will happen when the healthcare system passes this point of capacity.
20468,"You've got that flipped, my dude."

20544,"They report once a week, since september 24 only the cases confirmed with a tests are reported and the testing rate is far behind Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium, France, and even far behind countries with much less infection."
20545,They decide to remove 3700 positive cases from april because the deemed the test kits unreliable (= too sensitive).
20546,"But these case were removed in september, like suddenly Sweden had 3700 less cases."
20547,The delay in deaths statistics make it sound like it was going down while it's going up.
20548,Let me explain.
20549,Only the deaths that occurred the actual day are reported.
20550,Let's say 10 people died on september 10.
20551,"4 of them are reported on september 10 but for the 6 others there's a delay of 2, 3, 4, 7 or even 14 days."
20552,So 10 people died on september 10 but only 4 or them appear in the statistics.
20553,"""So what?"
20554,"It's reported a few days later..."" Nope."
20555,"On september 22 they report only the deaths of september 22, while the number of september 10 is surreptitiously ""updated""."

20557,"&gt; they have the situation under control

20860,"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent

What evidence do we have that wearing a mask is effective in preventing COVID-19?"
20861,There are several strands of evidence supporting the efficacy of masks.
20862,One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them.
20863,"An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth."
20864,Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols.
20865,But the strongest evidence in favor of masks come from studies of real-world scenarios.
20866,"“The most important thing are the epidemiologic data,” said Rutherford."
20867,"Because it would be unethical to assign people to not wear a mask during a pandemic, the epidemiological evidence has come from so-called “experiments of nature.”

A recent study published in Health Affairs, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia."
20868,"It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time."
20869,"The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points."
20870,Another study looked at coronavirus deaths across 198 countries and found that those with cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates.
20871,"Two compelling case reports also suggest that masks can prevent transmission in high-risk scenarios, said Chin-Hong and Rutherford."
20872,"In one case, a man flew from China to Toronto and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19."
20873,"He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight, and all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for COVID-19."
20874,"In another case, in late May, two hair stylists in Missouri had close contact with 140 clients while sick with COVID-19."
20875,Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive.
20876,Do masks protect the people wearing them or the people around them?
20877,"“I think there’s enough evidence to say that the best benefit is for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from giving COVID-19 to other people, but you’re still going to get a benefit from wearing a mask if you don’t have COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong"
20878,"He'll try to make it look like he just had a lil cold, like either he's stronger than most people, or covid is not a big deal, or both"
20879,I would absolutely be going back if it was safer.
20880,Online schooling doesn't work and is extremely boring.
20881,I'd probably be asking to go back too if I didn't care about the virus.
20882,Being the bigger person has netted 200k+ dead and insane people mocking mask wearers and literally fighting to spread the disease.
20883,Remember when governors were literally [hiding tests from the federal government because the feds we confiscating any covid tests they could get their hands on???

How much you wanna bet that the reason they were confiscating all of those tests was so that trump and his administration could have a STUPID amount of tests that they could use at their leisure to test everyone and everything coming into contact with trump, all so that he could continue to not wear a mask and pretend that life hasn't changed??"
20885,?
20886,"What's more a lot of far right/Q supporters are convinced that masks are just a test of our ""obedience"" and the next step is submitting to the 5G nanoparticle injections that are going to make us in Bill Gates' socialist zombie army"
20887,"Maybe, and bare with me, this isn't an issue of nationalism, and covid tests broadly speaking just have never worked like the way they were using them"
20888,Wow thank you for all the information!
20889,"Is anyone else trying to slowly go back to normal (with all the precautions of course) I had been home since March and last week I visited my boyfriend, we went out to eat several times and to some shopping malls (we always wore mask and social distanced ourselves, I took a test before going to see him and came back negative), my parents are 64 and 68 and like me, they haven't been out since march except to work and to get groceries but my dad suggested to go out to eat and sit outdoors, I'm scared but at the same time I understand they haven't done this in over 6 months, I saw plenty of older people eating out and enjoying life and I'm wondering if we should start safely going out, everything went from ""stay home for 2 weeks"" to ""stay home for a month"" to ""stay home for 6 months"" and now ""stay home indefinitely"", I can't imagine staying home for an entire year without going out."
20890,"This is the truth, and I’m not a political expert but I know a liar and a manipulator when I see one."
20891,My dad (who’s 83 now) is a Fox News junkie and he really thinks that they’re going to indict “someone” for treason.
20892,He said this to me in June.
20893,I’ve tried to talk him out of believing the bullshit but he’s certain.
20894,"Sadly I think my dad is inherently racist, based on his stories of growing up in the Bronx, and now the position he’s taking now on this without even considering that it
just might be a smoke show, saddens me."
20895,I can never take him seriously again
20896,I think the whole staying indoors does make a difference.
20897,California is pretty left leaning and we had a really hot summer and a spike in Covid cases as well this summer.
20898,But we also had our share of idiots who flouted social distancing and refuse to wear masks in spite of the majority here leaning Democratic.
20899,"That’s good to know, thank you!"
20900,I can't even follow what's going on.
20901,He was up and walking around with mild symptoms so they took him to the hospital?
20902,This really doesn't make much sense.
20903,But then they're saying that he could be discharged tomorrow which would jibe with a very mild case.
20904,I'm half Trump's age but by the way they're describing it what I had back in March (which was probably covid) was much worse than what he has.
20905,Maybe he just got fortunate and had a mild case.
20906,"But if that's the situation, then why the rush to get him to a hospital?"
20907,"I am shocked I tell you, just SHOCKED."
20908,I think that’s his point.
20909,\[obnoxious barking\]
20910,Can't wait until Trump unfortunately survives this episode and totally embellishes his stay at Walter Reed and how amazed and incredulous the doctors were in his brave and heroic fight to get back to lead the country!
20911,LMAO!
20912,"Right now it's Trump time, everything they post is about Trump doing the right thing (according to them), I'm guessing that's due to election time."
20913,"A month ago everything was BLM related, the classics: ""they're terrorists"" ""every life matters"" and so on."
20914,"We do get a hydroxychloroquine and mask post every now and then about how ""the left has politicized it"" saying one works and the he other one doesn't (without showing any proof whatsoever), you know which is which."
20915,Talking about Snorting while defending the one guy who refuses to take a drug test?
20916,Comical!
20917,Exactly what I was thinking about yours?
20918,Why are you telling me all that?
20919,Misuse?
20920,No.
20921,"That was abuse of resources, just like every other time this administration has abused resources."
20922,So they pick the most wasteful and failing plan to owned the libs....
20923,"No, ""regular Joe"" is dirt poor in Sweden."
20924,"Even though Sweden has a huge housing bubble, median wealth is only 400k."
20925,I must have struck a nerve since you took this personally.
20926,Nice comparison.
20927,"I don't think the citizens of Rosengård, Sweden feel very safe."
20928,And they won't after corona either.
20929,It would be nice if rapid covid-19 tests were even available to the general public.
20930,Like when my 10 year old woke up with flu-like symptoms last Sunday after a sleepover.
20931,We kept her out of school Mon-Wed while she was running a fever and had to miss work to do so.
20932,Meanwhile I'm checking on testing available in my area--drive through testing without Dr. referral?
20933,Awesome!
20934,"Oh, it's for 18+ only."
20935,Hmm.
20936,"Local walk-in clinics, appointment only for a 2 hour period per day and they're booked for the forseeable future."
20937,"Also, all of these tests have an average 5 day turn-around time."
20938,I ended up taking her back to school on Thursday after all her symptoms were gone and her temp was back to normal.
20939,We had been giving them full disclosure of what was going on while she was absent.
20940,The school nurse calls me about half an hour after drop-off to ask me a bunch of questions.
20941,"""Did you get her tested?"""
20942,"""No, I looked into it but it seemed almost impossible to even do so."""
20943,"""Did you take her to her pediatrician?"
20944,"I know they're doing testing."""
20945,I had not because she never became all that ill and our family are far from being hypochondriacs.
20946,"Ironically, the following day I had to take her sister to their pediatrician for an appointment and I brought up the whole situation to him and he was like ""you can call 211 to get a list of places you can be tested, we aren't admitting patients into our office who have COVID symptoms."""
20947,It's a total clusterfuck.
20948,(We're in one of the reddest states FYI)
20949,Generally restrictions on or condemnations of them are met with cries of anti-Semitism.
20950,"I won't weigh in on the legitimacy of that, but it makes politicians and decision-makers hesitant to try anything against the community."
20951,No surprise there!
20952,The WH completely misuses everything!
20953,[deleted]
20954,tl;dr: The tests they used had the same poor reliability as taking temperatures would.
20955,"Not an american either, but both parties rich leadership is wrestling with what the public REALLY wants."
20956,"You don't really have that much choice in America, it's either red or blue."
20957,"You get to choose between the lesser of two evils, indirectly via the electoral college."
20958,"The people who wanted change within the republican party first had the Tea Party, now they have Trump."
20959,"They're populists, going with what ever is put in the news cycle by Trump."
20960,"The democrats tried Bernie twice, first they got Hilary, now Biden."

20969,No one needs the kind of opulence most of us live with but we can afford it so we have it.
20970,Same thing there.
20971,"that was exactly their intention though, right?"
20972,so by that logic they did what they wanted at least.
20973,"They had to have taken these tests daily, the only way they could have found out if they were positive after again...not wearing the proper PPE."
20974,"i dont celebrate any of those, so that wouldnt affect me."
20975,i also dont see what that has to do with what i asked.

20982,"You’re more likely to avoid catching the virus at all, and if you do your viral load will probably be lower because if you’re “losing it” you’re also probably taking precautions."
20983,FHM have never claimed that masks are useless.
20984,They have however argued that a mask mandate would take focus from social distancing which they consider much more important.
20985,I do too.
20986,Maybe I should post the YouTube link as well?
20987,"That's over 1 million false positives per month if the test is 99.98% specific, if my calculations are correct."
20988,How would we handle that?
20989,Yes.
20990,"He's had multiple off the record meetings with Putin since being president, Kushner and others in his admin have been caught setting up back channel private communications between the white house and the Kremlin, Trump publicly went on stage in Helsinki and stated he agrees with whatever Putin says over the US intelligence community."
20991,Trump is massively in debt to the point where no banks would lend him money for years before his election and it's suspected that Russian banks are involved in loaning him money to prop up his public image of wealth.

20998,If you support what parties in other countries are saying you go against what the right wing party in *Sweden* is saying.

21007,Yes.
21008,Am I willing to die for that?
21009,No.
21010,This is a hilarious article.
21011,Half measures aren't the same a boisterous promises.
21012,"Small, insignificant things are easy to keep, but they are hardly the blockbuster promises of campaign candidates."
21013,The bar for satisfying a 'promise' is extremely low here.
21014,Like we would say trump kept his promise of building the wall after building 2 miles of wall that is already failing.
21015,"Or if a promise isn't even attempted to be kept, we assign some reason outside of the president's power as to why it didn't happen (Obama closing Gitmo)."
21016,At BEST it is over promising and WAAAYY under delivering everytime.

21025,"They fog my glasses, make my face hot and sweaty, and its like trying to breathe through a straw, which makes even minor exercise 2x harder (for me at least, and I'm physically fit, so imagine lazy people) and probably a few other things I'm not thinking of."
21026,"Of fucking course I still wear one wherever I go, but many people out there (think Karen-types) absolutely flip shit on minor inconveniences, and *especially* if it's a forced/mandated inconvenience."
21027,"Just one of those things are enough for entitled people to flip out, let alone all of it, coupled with it being a ""leftist agenda"" or ""communist"" or whatever, and plus their stupidity and inability to listen to reason, it's just a recipe for disaster."

21029,"I see what you’re saying, and I get that you have to take into consideration that the virus doesn’t travel alone."
21030,So question.
21031,While the virus is incredibly small (100-150 nm right?)
21032,it is carried by water droplets hundreds of times this size.
21033,"If a cloth mask block the exit of droplets 20-30 µm wide, it follows to say that a cloth mask can block a good amount of virus."
21034,"That said, isn’t inhalation different?"
21035,"After it’s been worn a while and the fabric is damp, what happens when the wearer comes in contact with an unmasked carrier and the mask is freckled with droplets?"
21036,Does the moisture in the mask not allow increased penetration of moisture and this virus?
21037,"Not trying to challenge you, just curious and figure you’d be able to answer that."
21038,"Regardless i wear a NIOSH approved N95* because I have access to it, and because I do interact with positive folks sometimes and a lot of people get ... creative with how they wear their masks."
21039,"My fiancé is immune compromised and has severe asthma, so it’s worth looking like a crazy person."

21043,Bwahahaha.
21044,Biden Wins.
21045,Not as many people had it but those who did have it were more likely to die.
21046,Yeah like this week
21047,And how many are hospitalized?
21048,Asymptotic?
21049,Cases alone is a misleading number.
21050,If you listen to them you should know even dr fauci is against lockdown.
21051,New york is reopening schools because kids shouldnt be lock down by virus that is less risk than the seasonal flu for this age group.
21052,"Andrew Cuomo knows desantis is right, shut down will not stop the virus, but will destroy the economy for no reason, there is no reward for shutting down the economy at all, same number of deaths will happen, Europe sees cases surging everywhere and they will do the right thing to let it be this time."
21053,"Look man, the loss of federal support is a drop in the bucket compared to amount of income most states have lost because of restrictions."
21054,I don’t think federal enticements matter right now
21055,There is zero evidence cases are decreasing.
21056,That’s just a republican talking point.
21057,"They are lying, just like they are lying about everything else."
21058,"Which, if we are following the super detailed Republican plan for the virus, means sacrificing elderly people like the president."
21059,It’s a terrible plan
21060,Too many likelihood functions.
21061,Can no longer invert posterior in closed form.
21062,Send Help.
21063,"In the case of a vaccine with non sterilizing immunity, we could still experience surges but hospitalizations/deaths would go down."
21064,"To me, that is still effective"
21065,Fun fact: the new England qb depth chart has more recent community transmissions than a country of 90 million.
21066,"But i live here in vn also, people here are pretty sensible and will do the right thing."

21070,was taking one of my kids to soccer around there and would run around it while the class took place?
21071,"now it's at Cunningham park cause the jewish center around there isn't allowing anything indoors

21072,Nope.
21073,Its just a bad coldfefe.
21074,Yeah it got better during the warmer months but now it’s turning cold in nyc
21075,"That’s true, which is why you especially *do not* use experimental treatments on the President when they have something mild that they are expected to recover from with bed rest and fluid intake."
21076,Think of it this way: there are experimental treatments right now for the common cold.
21077,They most definitely would not be tested on someone that important for something they were expected to recover from on their own.
21078,We all should.
21079,"I heard things are really spiking in Wisconsin, and that Green Bay Doctors are talking about the hospitals starting to overflow."
21080,How are the police supposed to enforce the masks &amp; social distancing when they don’t adhere to it themselves?
21081,Too much focus on number of cases.
21082,Thats the least important thing.
21083,Number of Deaths is what you should care about.
21084,It might be grammatically correct but it doesn't flow well at all and is jarring to read.
21085,The whole article is written in this way.
21086,Only one single paragraph doesn't have a comma in the first sentence.
21087,It’s not.
21088,Cases have been stable and low frequency for a couple weeks across California.
21089,It’s old news not fake news.
21090,I expect a resurgence in Nov/Dec though after the weather turns colder and wetter and the holidays kick into gear

21110,Even if you qualify for a clinical trial there's a 50% chance you will receive a placebo.
21111,The thought that a clinical trial is equivalent to a fully functional vaccine with enough production for a nationwide distribution is ridiculous.
21112,The alternative is it offers disease protection.
21113,"You can still become infected, but the immune response from the vaccine allows your body to mount a quick defence and clear the virus without disease progression."
21114,Yes!!

21123,I’ve never heard of conversational dyspena could you explain what that is?
21124,Well stated!
21125,"It's also worth noting that, 

a) Trump put us here in every way imaginable, including lying his fucking ASS off on a daily basis."

21156,Most students going to St Johns live in Jamaica Estates and Fresh meadows along union.

21241,The vast majority will deal with covid easily.
21242,Even if only 1% died that means 99% won't and to the avg person they can't grasp how horrific 1% (3 million) dead Americans is.
21243,So the more people in the spotlight that catch Covid and DO NOT die will only reinforce their misunderstanding how dangerous it really is.
21244,Because though many survive it's the continual sustained community spread that keeps rolling and eventually causes others to die down the line.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act

&gt;The concept of an individual mandate goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care."
21442,[114][115] It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems.
21443,"Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay."
21444,"[116][117][118]

&gt;In 2006, an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts."
21445,The bill contained both an individual mandate and an insurance exchange.
21446,"Republican Governor Mitt Romney vetoed the mandate, but after Democrats overrode his veto, he signed it into law."
21447,[128] Romney's implementation of the 'Health Connector' exchange and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans.
21448,"During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Jim DeMint praised Romney's ability to ""take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured""."
21449,"Romney said of the individual mandate: ""I'm proud of what we've done."
21450,"If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation."
21451,"""[129]

On the ACA itself?"
21452,"&gt;However, following the incorporation of an individual mandate into the proposal, Republicans threatened to filibuster any bill that contained it."
21453,"[114] Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican response, concluded Republicans should not support the bill."
21454,"[146]
&gt;
&gt;**Republican Senators, including those who had supported earlier proposals with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as ""unconstitutional""."

21526,"If I was, I would accept that I should be punished, its that simple."
21527,Members of the public have been punished for doing exactly what he did and yet he faced no repercussions.
21528,"If anything, as a leader who is meant to be setting an example, he should be punished far worse than the general public."
21529,"If bojo knew but didnt say anything, then I completely understand; theres no need to cause trouble."
21530,"However once the public found, he should have been punished."
21531,I’d challenge the assertion most medical doctors are democrat.
21532,In fact the most highly paid medical professions tend to lean heavily republican.
21533,They tend to be very against socialized medicine.
21534,And they want to get rid of as many taxes as possible that would cut into their wealth.
21535,I think most scientists (who may also be doctors) lean Democrat for sure.
21536,The GOP tends to be the anti science party.
21537,But among doctors in general it’s pretty split.

21560,What does it mean according to you?
21561,Rapid test alone didn't seem to work for the White House.
21562,"You will need a combination of rapid frequent tests, masks and distancing."
21563,And when you start focusing on wearing masks people start to loose focus on social distancing no matter if Fauci tries to emphasize both.
21564,You can see clear signs of that on reddit when anyone brings up an example of a crowded space and the first thing people do is question if they wore masks and not to encourage social distancing which is likely to be much more effective at stopping spread.
21565,"In an attempt to see their logic, I'll argue that the mask is such a masskve indication that things are going wrong, they don't want people to see it."
21566,"They want to the history of their administration to be seen as without meaningful issue, similar to how FDR wasnt seen with hit wheelchair--gives the illusion of strength

They know that once the entire room is filled with people wearing masks, their downplaying of the virus doesn't work, and their goal is definitely to downplay the virus and keep people working so the economy moves."

21571,So it’s ok for someone to let their mental health spiral than potentially catch a virus that is not deadly for the vast majority of people?
21572,Not really.
21573,I argued with another redditor on the technicality of airborne transmission.
21574,It was so obviously airborne but they just cited CDC who didn't say it was or wasn't.
21575,When did I say I was ok with the death count.
21576,"I'm not saying to excuse Trump, I'm saying to be respectful."

21609,He's defied congress to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia because of his person business interests.
21610,Escalated tensions in Syria.
21611,He sells weapons when it's convenient for his person agenda with no regard for the security of the country.

21649,"I know many boomers that have jumped ship in the last 20 years, too."
21650,It's about keeping their primary source of votes subservient and under control.

21657,Test is testing for a genetic material at a certain level to be positive.
21658,"No idea what that level is but everything in this world is in a spectrum, not yes or no, black or white."
21659,So I imagine somewhere in your body you can have the virus and the mouth swab or nasalpharyngeal swab might not pick up enough of it to reach the threshold to be a positive test (early on).
21660,This is my best guess.
21661,Also what viral load is considered enough to infect somebody?
21662,We don’t really know.. I’m sure mostly everyone’s been exposed at this point but we have our own line of defenses which block it out or trap the virus before it can be mistaken as our own.
21663,I’m assuming healthy individuals can buffer to a certain extent depending on how you are exposed to it.
21664,I don't think it's necessarily the masks alone.
21665,I want to say it also has to do with the mandates and everything that goes along with it.
21666,"The opinions you hear, from non-politicians who are conservative, are concerned with the fact that there is very little talk about how Covid is obviously targeting unhealthy, diabetic, obese etc."

21676,"Short of that I'm not sure we're going to see useful widespread, frequent testing."
21677,I can't tell you that.
21678,Just that most people who are testing positive have been to a sit-down restaurant in the weeks/days prior to transmission

21792,So they’re Star Belly Sneetches?
21793,Seems to me to be a lot of interrelated factors.
21794,• American culture glorifies individualism at all costs.
21795,"While it’s true that your mask protects others, not yourself, that reality means people can rationalize the whole thing as “I’m not responsible for a stranger’s health, they should stay home if they don’t want to get sick.”

• In the same vein, people (especially in America) just plain don’t like being told what to do, *especially* when it’s a *new* thing."
21796,"• America has been fostering anti-intellectualism for *decades,* to the point where many, many people truly believe that their opinion or gut feeling is just as valuable as a professional’s presentation of evidence-driven and data-driven research."
21797,"• In an increasingly post-truth world, you can find *anything* convincingly presented as fact."
21798,"In social media bubbles where echo chambers are encouraged and reinforced, people genuinely only see content that further reinforces their preexisting beliefs."
21799,"• Trump initially misjudged things at the beginning of the pandemic, and so downplayed the severity of the issue to make it look like he hadn’t made the initial mistakes, because his MO is consistently refusing to ever admit he made a mistake."
21800,"This increasingly locked him into a cycle of contradicting medical experts because if he’s wrong now, he was wrong then, and that’s not an option for him, from a purely ego-driven place."
21801,"• His base and his party will go along with *whatever he says, ever."
21802,"* So there’s very little to lose from this behavior, as far as political capital goes."
21803,Just my two cents.
21804,"Think “North Korean doctors discussing dear leader”

If trump dies, these doctors will have to deal with trumps conspiracy ridden, violent and incredibly irrational base."
21805,I wouldn’t want my face on that.
21806,Cruelty upon stupidity.
21807,"At the same time that they stupidly thought their access to routine testing kept them 100% safe, they actively worked to minimize access to testing for the general public."
21808,This is of course how the administration has been run from day one.
21809,I shudder to think of the damage they’d have caused if they weren’t so abjectly stupid and incompetent.
21810,You're ignoring human psychology and that's my point.
21811,We are not machines of logic and some need spirituality to fully thrive as a primate.

21849,we have evidence from the Spanish Flu that states/cities who kept mortality low took an initial hit but were up and running sooner than laisez faire areas.
21850,"Trump and republicans don’t care about the long term, they need people economically happy this year, 2021 be dammed."
21851,Masks are awesome to keep us safe but also appropriately active in the economy/our lives.
21852,If My states numbers are quite low so I’m fine with going to outdoor events with other people around as long as their is space.

21869,For those interested in the administration of dexamethasone and what disease progression in Covid-19 looks like I'd suggest reading the MATH+ protocol as designed by Dr. Marik.
21870,The hypothesis is that Covid-19 is very much a two phase disease.
21871,"The initial viral replication can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (fever, head ache, chills, loss of smell/taste) and most peoples immune system clear the virus without much difficulty."
21872,"The second phase, which actually kills people (not the virus itself), is the hyperinflammatory immune response which is characterized by hypoxia, hyperinflammation and hypercoagubility which damages the lungs and other organs."
21873,There is a critical window on determining when to administer steroids.
21874,"Too soon, and you inhibit the bodies own immune response and seroconversion, too late and the hyper inflammation leads to ARDS."

21880,You one of the Georgian kiddies as well?
21881,"Nope, Florida, Arizona, California and Texas all see cases peak at summer, it still transmits on indoor areas during summer, now all the states with previous spikes are seeing much lower cases and deaths."
21882,"Had New York reopen school way earlier or not shut them down, they won’t see a spike during the fall as well, herd immunity is working, the decreasing deaths is a much more important factor than daily cases, Spanish flu curves are from deaths not daily cases."
21883,Because eventually everyone will get reinfected but the immunity allows people to fight the virus off easier and far less chance to become serious.
21884,"The daily cases stats is irrelevant anymore because this virus is here to stay, only the death curve matters on the way of reaching herd immunity."

21890,My mom had a fever a few months back.
21891,I freaked out and asked her to test her taste buds.

21895,"Had they advertised it as a rah-rah patriotic duty, without TELLING us to wear masks, and had consistent messaging from the beginning, less Republicans would have an issue with it."
21896,Almost every Republican I have talked to personally about it comes off as a rebel without a cause.
21897,It means enough people get infected and become immune to the virus that the potential infection pool for the virus to survive is miniscule.
21898,Is that right?

21968,They don’t want to govern.

21970,Their whole MO is legislating government agencies to the point of ineffectiveness or insolvency and then holding them up as an example of how government doesn’t work.
21971,The USPS is the perfect example.
21972,"They packed the courts and dismantled the State Department, fucked up tons of other departments like screwing with the FDA's ability to simply record data in a consistent manner."

21988,That's not a consenting equal operator at the head of the government.
21989,That's a whiney child and whiney children do not manage the household for a reason.
21990,The healthcare thing was really absurd to witness.
21991,Rail on Obamacare for 6 years (not counting the initial fight to install it).
21992,"Then the moment they have power granted because they promised to repeal/replace they find that both their constituents don't want to lose literally every beneficial thing Obamacare did, and the Republicans have nothing other than to strip back services to where they were when Sicko was our reality (not saying we are miles evolved now, but certainly better on some things)."
21993,Conservatives need to figure out what their actual policies look like to address our nation's issues.
21994,Until that is outlined they have literally no right to govern and it's only this culture war shit + heavy table stacking that's keeping them even competitive in the Federal Government.

- if infectious dose matters for how serious the symptoms are and summer is less propicious for the virus to develop and/or mask use does help reduce the infectious dose (wrong term but I can not think of it in english now), then more infected but a smaller percentage of them are serious cases;

- if vitamin D is preventive, vitamin D levels would be up in northern europe from the recent  summer, and will start declining soon."

22109,We do a rapid test at my hospital and it's nasopharyngeal specimen.

Yeah, when the national party as a whole fixes their shit then you can make your argument."
22125,"But basically everywhere where Republicans have the chance, they have shown they are more likely to draw districts and change voter laws to make it easier for them to stay in power and pass laws that help their special interest donors over the people they serve."
22126,"Hubris, thats all it is."
22127,The pride always comes before the fall.
22128,"Yeah even when my daughter was sick w RSV (she's asthmatic) and having a hard time breathing, they were hesitant to use the steroids on her at first."
22129,I had to take her back into the hospital three days in a row until they finally admitted her and gave her the steroids.
22130,They were concerned about the steroids worsening her immune system to fight it off and wanted to see if she could clear it on her own.
22131,We didn't know she was asthmatic yet 🙄 I doubt they'd use it on him unless they had to.
22132,That combined w the fact he looks awful and they edited the hell out of the latest video.

22149,Probably.

22152,Alienation feedback loop.
22153,"People feel alienated, believe the government is against them (mostly correct)."

22177,But she was weak from bad care and her pickiness of not eating.
22178,And she had heart problem that needed to be checked out.
22179,A bunch of stuff adding up badly.
22180,The virus was the final straw.

22185,"Agreed, but not everyone has that view."
22186,"People have been very fixated on the number of deaths, not the rates."
22187,People generally don't think about things from a statistical standpoint.
22188,"The other reason I think this is because there are news articles out there stating hygiene facts that I thought everyone knew by common sense, so I'm not sure if that's because people were completely oblivious to how viruses spread and are going to let the science get to their head."

22209,"When the virus started, Trump spent significant time telling his base that the virus was a hoax, it was no worse than common flu, its wasn't that infectious, and regularly mocking anyone who wore them."
22210,"A protest group sprung up, which was protesting against lockdown and the disease, which Trump encouraged to keep fighting against the Govenors."
22211,"It was later revealed in the Bob Woodward interview tapes that he was very aware that it was airborne (meaning masks would be needed and also highly contagious), that it was very deadly (he quoted the figure of 5%, which is about right)."
22212,"So in summary, for almost the entire year Trump has been saying that it is a hoax, its a minor disease so not to worry about it."
22213,Republicans seem to have believed their President.
22214,"They're all the same ""team"""
22215,Can anyone direct me to information about actually cases of COVID infection from outdoor settings?
22216,I was only able to find one confirmed case of transmission from an outdoor local (from before socially distancing).
22217,I'm really hoping to find any data that shows how many or how few verified cases of COVID  transmission while outside.
22218,If there aren't any confirmed cases I would love to confirm that as well.
22219,"I feel like this is being studied somewhere, right?"
22220,"Yep, I'm not anti-mask or anything, just saying that social distancing and reducing close contacts is multiple times more important than wearing a mask when in a large well ventilated supermarket."
22221,"Most of our cases in Ireland are spreading amongst households, my county is in a local lockdown-lite at the moment, all bars, restaurants etc are closed but cases are still rising cause people keep meeting friends, having house parties etc"

22223,Tomorrow it might be the other way around
22224,"I'm supposing that, despite what I've learned from the movies, it's actually pretty hard to find highly competent people who are evil, and the small proportion of people who are know better than to get themselves into a highly visible position like President."
22225,"Yeah, even though you could do this test at home, they won't let you, not in the U.S."
22226,"In the U.S. you have to go to your doctor and have them do it, which increases your cost for this test by a couple hundred."
22227,Hard to get re-elected if you do everything you promised the first term lol.
22228,It is a way to physically mark people who oppose them so they can be harassed.
22229,But that only works if wearing masks is optional.
22230,Ordering people to wear a yellow star on their clothes fell out of favor.
22231,"I could answer that, but then I would have to charge you a $100 consultant fee."

22234,They have to take the opposite stance on everything the left wants.

22252,"It's more they have a compulsion to take the opposite position of anything from someone ""telling them what to do""."

22268,"And so circular wheels would be more efficient, just gonna give in and make square wheels?"
22269,"Maybe confront the person that says to make square wheels, they get angry and say 'they know better'.."
22270,So.
22271,"Just make the circular wheels, it's obviously better - and just SHOW that being a better idea."
22272,"Rather, forget it - forget all this voting what ever, just made up shenanigans - just think about things, ask the questions."

22274,And just saying a fallible mundane person to be obeyed no matter what as infallible?
22275,"Not think, just 'do'?"
22276,That's not thinking - not questioning.
22277,"No, everyone's not perfect, no one's infallible."
22278,"Can just live around each other, not mindlessly upholding anyone as infallible - 'leader', no, just be 'people' - neighbors, just living around each other -- perhaps on a big rock floating through an endless void."
22279,"Forget all this imaginary, made up stuff - 'countries', 'nation', no - we're all just 'people', people aren't a made up name, people are 'people'."
22280,"Just to live around each other, with everyone."
22281,"Just think before acting to live with each other -- 'laws', no, all you need to do is look out for each others well being - while questioning everything."
22282,If all you do is follow a script without thinking; 'law' says 'hug person if depressed' - but that hug?
22283,"That's an empty meaningless hug, just following a script and just hugging 'because it said so' -- not really hugging the person, not really caring about the person, just following a script."
22284,"All you need to do is question everything - everyone, not just blindly follow a 'law' 'because it said so' - no, 'think', 'why'."
22285,There are a lot of reasons why scientists think it came from the Wuhan wet market though and it’s also not too impossible to eventually determine where it came from.
22286,"Also Chinese scientists having been publishing studies since 2003 about viruses potentially coming from the sell of exotic animals, and Chinese scientists have been advocating against it for years."

22288,He has a bunch of tweets over the last couple days or so.
22289,"Probably isn’t him, but his account has been active."
22290,"I also think its because Trump decided early on to take a ""*this is not a problem, you guys!"

22292,"I'd be very surprised if we actually hunker down again, though I mostly just go to work and pickup food as it is right now."

22305,Normally yes but you’re assuming the same population is getting it now as in March.
22306,Presently it is overwhelmingly being spread by 20-29 year hence the low death rate even as cases started to rise two months ago.

22373,The only time I've seen recommendations to rerun are in the case of an obvious defect or breach of protocol OR after waiting for a period of time for antibody / antigen load to increase.

22392,"&gt;Within those nine zip codes, the mayor says approximately 100 public and 200 non-public schools would be closed."
22393,Students in the identified zip codes would be allowed to return to their schools on Monday and Tuesday to meet with teachers and plan for a school-wide return to remote learning.

22404,By and large vaccine hesitancy isn't as big an issue here as it is in the US (although it's still an issue) so really the main variable is how safe and effective the first vaccines prove to be.
22405,I have no qualms about taking it as soon as it is offered; I trust the process and method by which Oxford uni have made and tested their vaccine.
22406,"The UK government have done an incredibly shoddy job of managing almost everything that's been thrown at them since Johnson entered Number 10, but I have no doubt that they will be wanting to get this rollout done as seamlessly as possible."

22413,Lockdowns are to *prevent* hospital overload.
22414,That's exactly what we're doing.
22415,A basic risk assessment and five minute preview of the case studies in the world would say we do not need to take any risks at this time.
22416,It's a bad take.

22433,"I'm honestly really glad you, and the few folk who do the apparent dirty work of knowing you haven't had to experience this but to pretend as though because you haven't seen this shit that it doesn't exist, is not only stupid but amazingly, almost awe inspiringly arrogant."

22493,"&gt; It’s no surprise that a kind of extreme social distancing became the norm, even without urging from governments."
22494,Boccaccio’s stories are shocking.

22497,Children abandoned elderly parents and priests their flocks.

22507,Processions and penance became a thing.
22508,Others looked for a scapegoat: usually Jews which resulted in pogroms in several parts of Europe.
22509,The Plague didn't spread across Europe all at once.
22510,Travelling was very limited and so the disease was more of a set of waves that gradually overwhelmed Europe.
22511,"At that time, Europe wasn't spared of war and battles either."

22513,"Finally, the Plague didn't leave Europe and would pop up numerous times."

22611,"There are vitamin D3 receptors on every single cell in the human body, and vitamin D3 enable gene transcription and gene expression and modulates autoimmune function."

22676,"VN has little money, and small (but very good) medical force, so the gov has to find Covid spreaders as fast as possible, all the time, to prevent the spread from becoming serious in the first place."
22677,"Also, most people were prepared for the pandemic since the very beginning, there's even awareness video on TikTok/Youtube/etc."
22678,"If VN failed and had anywhere near the infected count of the USA, then the total death count would be nearly 1 million, not just 200k."
22679,Luckily it succeeded.
22680,Incorrect.
22681,The refusal to allow their establishment to introduce an unnessecary health hazard to other patrons and employees.
22682,Your circular argument is disingenuous.

22693,"Example:

Trump, the president of USA, has tested positive for covid19."
22694,They should have written this article two weeks ago.
22695,Now it's bullshit.

22698,The anti-mask and anti-vaccine people are both dangerous and disgusting!
22699,They don't give a shit about anybody but themselves.
22700,That's why the Covid-19 virus is running so rampant and out of control here in the United States right now.
22701,I think another at 1:53.
22702,Those are the ones that are going to matter.
22703,Just having a positive swab doesn't necessarily make a person positive as there's bystander virus that can be picked up in a swab.
22704,Prolonged exposure to any virus will cause bystander virus to be picked up.
22705,This guy went to Spain during an outbreak and was traveling on a plane.
22706,That'll do it.
22707,But does that mean a person actually has the disease again?
22708,No.
22709,It's just how our immune systems work.
22710,"If it took a full two weeks before he had an antibody response, there might be a case to be made that he actually was reinfected and didn't have existing immunity against the virus."
22711,"But, with that short amount of time to generate IgG antibodies, he definitely had existing immunity against the virus."
22712,"Could be a false positive, could still be chilling in your system as I was positive for a covid well after I recovered."
22713,Extremely small chance it’s reinfection.
22714,I’d get another test.
22715,Russia and China have both released their vaccines.
22716,China even started giving it to their military.

22826,So I been tracking the number in our county based on the numbers they are providing.
22827,"The good news is, it's not growing like crazy, but there's a pretty consistent number of cases week to week:

My Data:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YocplHbPEe_sxf57eznQvPhewZj_ykIWQeWKdTiLLSg/edit?usp=sharing

Based off of:
https://hillsboroughschools.org/doc/2744/school-reopening-plan/frequently-asked-questions/coviddash/

That said, the numbers are adjusted sporadically and often go back and fill over a week ago, there are times when certain counts do not match, or the graph is missing students vs what the totals show."
22828,As of today it looks like everything is accounted for.
22829,I cannot confirm but I've also been told that students who are told to self quarantine and then come up positive are NOT counted in these numbers.
22830,"I cannot confirm this, but it does make one wonder."
22831,It does appear student cases are trending down a bit while staff is trending slightly up.
22832,In general though we're getting 10 new cases on average a day.
22833,"So, it's not as bad as I would have expected, but it's no exactly great."
22834,We also have classrooms that are only half filled so the number of people on campus is no where near what it is during a full school year.
22835,"I prefer data, as eventually I'll need to decide what to do with my kids, and I'll use what I can dig up to make the best decision possible when the time comes."
22836,EDIT: This is Hillsborough county (Tampa Area)

22838,"The recent focus on respiratory infection deaths is not proportionate to the risks we as individuals encounter on a daily basis from death of all causes and although that stat has increased from \~ 123k deaths annually in the US, it is not significant enough of a factor to drastically alter our way of life as we continue to do."
22839,Oh!
22840,"So you prefer to see the 1 percent of the most vulnerable people coming down with Covid-19 and dying from it, eh?"
22841,Just what the fucking hell kind of an attitude is that?

22896,"The pandemic numbers here are unreliable, since the cause of death is being manipulated."
22897,They are inflating numbers of deaths by covid.
22898,The only data we can trust is the number of deaths per year.
22899,"See, below is the total number of deaths per year including all causes."
22900,"Total deaths in the year, from all causes:

2015	877897

2016	997904  - 14% growth compared to the previous year

2017	1037523 -  4% growth compared to the previous year 

2018	1184043 -  14% growth compared to the previous year 

2019	1248276 -  5% growth compared to the previous year 

2020 until october	1071356

If we take the number of deaths that occurred until October 2020, divide by 9 months and then multiply it by 12 We will reach a total number of deaths in 2020 of 1,428,474 a projected growth of 14% again compared to the previous year."
22901,"In other words, imagine that someone 100 years from now looks at the numbers of deaths that occurred between 2015 and 2025 in Brazil."

22903,"The economic graphs of unemployment, poverty, loss of productivity on the other hand will show that there was a catastrophe."

22945,"Testing is great; but, there's a lot of trouble with the current setup that can lead to the spreading of COVID-19."
22946,"An ideal test would be something that could be self administered, mailed out (preventing the public from spreading the virus waiting in testing lines) while being something that could be interpreted (e.g."
22947,test strip turning a certain color) without having to be picked up to be processed.
22948,"You'd keep infected people isolated, protecting those not infected and minimizing the risk of processing and handling."
22949,I’d be more worried about people not testing themselves properly more so than then not doing it.

22964,Their loyalty to him may cost them their lives.
22965,"I heard Dr. Daniel Griffin today on the twiv podcast say jokingly about COVID  tests and to put their use into perspective: “my oldest daughter went to college so I had her take a pregnancy test so I know she will be fine for four years.”

22975,"Living with social distancing is distopic, and it must at some point end."

23167,"&gt; “I would say the sweet spot is 80 percent,” says CUNY’s Lee, who co-authored a research paper in Julyabout efficacy goals for the COVID-19 vaccine."
23168,"The bare minimum standard of 50 percent, set by the FDA and WHO, would only protect half the population if everyone is vaccinated."
23169,That falls well below the theorem threshold for COVID-19 of 60 to 75 percent.
23170,"Such a scenario would be akin to the seasonal influenza vaccine, for which transmission efficacy tends to range between 20 to 60 percent."
23171,"Mass vaccination doesn’t stop the flu, though it does reduce the disease burden on society."
23172,"“We have to make it clear to everyone that the first vaccine to reach the market may not achieve those efficacy levels,” Lee says."
23173,"“It's not that easy to get an efficacy that high for a respiratory virus.”
That’s because current guidance says vaccine frontrunners can be approved even if they only provide “functional immunity,” which mainly confers protection against the symptoms of the disease."
23174,"The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials are not designed to estimate the impact the vaccine candidates would have on transmission, write the authors of the National Academy of Medicine report, adding that we may not learn this impact until well after an FDA approval."
23175,"As they explain, the first priority is to stop the most vulnerable people from dying, especially older people with pre-existing conditions and our limited cohort of frontline health-care specialists and first responders."
23176,"“So much of the focus has been on the return to normal,” Lee says, “and we can't have that type of expectation.” 

This is what I’ve been trying to tell people and I keep getting downvoted."
23177,"Unless we get a vaccine that is 80%+ effective and provides sterilizing immunity, we can’t get lax with masks and social distancing or we’ll be back to surges like we were earlier in the year."
23178,And the likelihood of a vaccine like that coming out in the next year or so is extremely low.
23179,"That’s why Fauci is saying even with a vaccine, we still need to be vigilant with masks and all the other precautions."
23180,"If he recovers easily, they should make sure to put in the part where he has 10 personal physicians and he’s being treated in a private suite in a world class hospital."

23233,"From uk government:

'12,871 cases reported today included a backlog based on the testing date information provided for the 10,806 cases reported by England today.'"

23418,I had to wear a mask over an oxygen tube when I needed oxygen in the recovery room before I went to a regular room.
23419,I think hospitals are taking this seriously.
23420,It was also very clean and they cleaned regularly.
23421,The hospital staff were diligent about wearing masks.

23429,"We have mandatory masks in stores where I live, but 80% of people wear them below their nose, so how can we judge their effectiveness when they might as well be wearing nothing?"
23430,It's hard to so masks don't work when everyone puts them on and them wears them incorrectly.
23431,Do people think we only breathe out of our mouths?
23432,What side is there to be had?
23433,The Trump administration did something unscientific and stupid that everyone could plainly see and now they’re in their own trouble for it.

23523,"You are right considering anywhere below tuscany was more or less covid free (average mortality in tuscany for the first 4 months of 2020 was in line with previous years, so there is an small excess, Lazio because of lockdowns was below average as expected)."

23553,This is utterly ridiculous nonsense.
23554,"The Netherlands had 2000 patients in ICU in April, 1500 for covid19 and 500 for normal care, and the healthcare system was in the brink of collapse."
23555,"The Netherlands had normally 1100 ICU beds, and if there was no lockdown the 2000 that were scaled up were almost gone and the consequences could be far worse also for normal care outside of covid19."
23556,So they say we should just let the virus run rampant and then what?
23557,I don't see any records ever even in the worst flu seasons that the ICU occupancy was that close to collapse (with almost double the normal capacity I have to stress that).
23558,This is just out of this world nonsense with the second wave now underway and already 160+ people in ICU.
23559,Just remember that the UK is where Andrew Wakefield started off the whole modern anti-vax movement.
23560,"Also Boris undoubtedly wants to roll out the vaccine as quickly as possible but knowing the Tories, it will be handed over to Serco who will make a load of money and fuck up at every possible turn."
23561,I think your understanding of the scale of severity and what 'very promising' means is off.
23562,Promising results do not equal cure or guarantee.
23563,The remdesivir trial uses a 7 point severity scale and just says after 10 days more people improved by a point who took remdesivir than didn't.
23564,It shaves a few days off recovery and takes mortality down from 11.9% to 7.1%.
23565,Dexamethasone takes patients who are on oxygen or ventilators from about 26% mortality to about 23% mortality after a month.
23566,It actually increases mortality on patients who didn't need help breathing.
23567,We don't know how the drugs will interact with each other.
23568,"The results are promising, it seems these treatments do help!"
23569,But not to the extent that we can be confident about an outcome.
23570,"Trump's future is still VERY unclear, and the only thing we can be certain of is that they're not going to make it sound like he's worse than he is."
23571,Only the other way around.
23572,Oof.
23573,Still crazy and would be a significant blow to many people with average or below average income
23574,Didn't he claim already that he had taken it?
23575,Any reporters ask the doc about that?
23576,"To be honest, it’s the other way around."
23577,I’m noticing worldwide that it’s the 99% who are flouting medical advice and the 1% who are listening.
23578,"This is why we’ve got such a big problem, no one seems to care because the media told everyone only old people get sick."
23579,"Yet everyone is forgetting the long term effects this has on the organs and ones health, should you get it regardless of age."
23580,This thing will be around until 2025 due to the globalised world we live in.
23581,Accounts outside the US?
23582,IF/when things get so bad they need to flee the Trump Empire  US based bank accounts will already have been seized and or locked down.

23620,"I read rumors that he actually refused oxygen at first and didn’t want to go to the hospital, so it seems more likely he’s a petulant child about this and there’s a good risk of him becoming non-compliant and endangering his health if doctors hurt his feelings."

23624,&gt;This group is anti-lockdown and anti-mask.
23625,Yes.
23626,&gt;They are happy to repeat the anti-mask sound-bites but don't want to go into their thinking or justification for that.
23627,At the risk of upsetting a lot of people: justification for this definitely exists.
23628,"Despite popular belief, countless of contemporary studies indicate that they aren't effective or are counter-productive."
23629,"Even [the WHO itself](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks) -which pleads for their use- admits this:

""Non-medical, fabric masks are being used by many people in public areas, **but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness** and WHO does not recommend their widespread use among the public for control of COVID-19."""
23630,The debate on the whether the situation merits masks aught to be open.
23631,&gt;The response above the person gave is pure evasion.
23632,"There could be a group that is anti-lockdown and pro-mask (until the vaccines go into mass supply), but this lot are not it."
23633,That last response is pretty bad.
23634,"But then the interview is short, and arguments on both sides were simplified to the point neither position is remotely acceptable as a basis for anything."
23635,Both sides have more to back up their claims than what little they say in the interview.
23636,"What is interesting is that there is a number of academics (this is only the medical professionals, there's more branches that aught to be involved) that are openly coming out as anti-lockdown."
23637,"They are raising legitimate concerns and one cannot simply put them away as ""mindless, uneducated conspiracy theorists""."
23638,"But yes, they *also* raise concerns about masks."
23639,"If that's some sort of no-go for you personally, then you could of course choose to ignore everything they have to say."
23640,What exactly in the statement before is so outrageous?
23641,"Wouldn't promoting exercise, healthy food and healthy lifestyles save thousands of lives with relatively little cost?"
23642,"We damaged the economy in society so hard, why are people reticent of taxing sugar and junk food higher?"
23643,As a grocery store worker (at least at my unique store) I really do hope we reduce hours again.
23644,From 9-10pm in my smaller store we literally fight over each other to check out customers because we're so slow.
23645,I think a lot of businesses will keep more reduced hours realizing how bad sales are late at night.
23646,Jeez.

23651,"You are not wrong about people won't go have tests without good reasons, I guess."
23652,That is a common misconception about how laboratory testing is done.
23653,"While specimens are tested in groups of test tubes or other kinds of vials, each specimen retains its own integrity and is not mixed or contaminated with other specimens."
23654,"The groups are often called batches, but to a layperson who hasn't seen the laboratory setup or had an adequate explanation, people sometimes misconstrue the setup, sometimes due to the word ""batch"", and think samples are mixed (that may have been done in some very early setups in the 1930s or around there, but mixing samples is more problematic than just having to retest each individual one due to dilution effects and the like)."
23655,"To my knowledge, what you are describing is not done in modern laboratories and has not been done ever in some areas of science or for a very, very long time in some others."
23656,I wonder if this will change any of these gop fucks standpoint on covid... knowing they themselves have now infected their families
23657,Do other people not hunker down in the fall?
23658,"The last 7 months has been just like how I bunker down in the fall, except now with mask use whenever I go in to public places."
23659,Who’s surprised by this?
23660,Abjectly and immorally lazy and corrupt.
23661,They wasted likely thousands worth and untold numbers of lives because they didn’t want to wear masks.
23662,"Because their base is uncomfortable in them or, just as likely, has some moral issue with them because they remind them of “them face coverin’s them Arabs wear”."
23663,This is sort of like the old underwear with holes.

23665,"Here’s a prescription for one (1) chill pill, which you desperately need to prevent you from flying off the handle at someone for asking a question."

23673,He finally was free of it.
23674,"Point I'm trying to make is, hang in there because if he can beat it alone with zero medicines, you can see this through."
23675,Same here.
23676,And they videoconference all day spitting out droplets (6 feet) and aerosol (27 feet).
23677,Also my coworkers come to my cube wanting to have a close face to face conversation while wearing a surgical mask or other thin material mask.
23678,I tell them to go back to their cube and send me a email or videoconference.
23679,"I do get it, and it usually works OK, but not in a public health crisis."
23680,The right (constituents not politicians) tend to be individualist and want to limit the power of government.
23681,"They see this as government overreaching by trying to ""tell them what to do""."
23682,"They also tend to be skeptical of the arguments used to ""tell them what to do"", because most are convinced, not without reason, that there are people out there that really really want to tell everyone what to do on the theory that they know better."
23683,"It's ""removed experts"" vs. ""individual with complete firsthand details about the specific situation"" argument."
23684,These are generally the mostly want to be left alone people.

23702,Lockdown with case reduction and contact tracing seems like the way forward this fall but of course this is all open to discussion and just one idea.

23710,"The Republican Party seizes on petty social issues of “freedom” surrounding things like masks, abortion, racism, and religion to fool its constituents into ignoring real, complex issues like corruption, lobbying, tax avoidance, healthcare, etc."
23711,"Remember “Christmas is under attack”, or “Athletes Kneeling“?"
23712,That’s what I mean when I say petty.
23713,"Republican “freedom” is the freedom to take away other people’s rights, keeping the other side busy with defending them while the rich loot the middle and lower class legally."
23714,They’ve been doing it since the southern strategy days of the 60’s when the modern Republican Party formed.
23715,It is a system of control.
23716,It is definitely a sign of weakness and a lack of an ability to think about complex social issues.
23717,Their leaders harness that lack of emotional and mental complexity against them.
23718,This is why Republicans vote against their own economic self-interest and sometimes they knowingly do it to spite liberals.
23719,Voting Trump into office is the ultimate extreme expression of that.
23720,"I don't blame the dr too much, not on a personal level."
23721,"He was clearly uncomfortable and trying his best not to lie, I think the time he did so was more of a slip because he felt pressured from the president on the one side and the public on the other."
23722,"It seems like anyone who gets close to Trump has to lie and bend reality by association, he's like a black hole that warps time and distorts information."
23723,They had to walk that back.
23724,It is two monoclonal antibodies.
23725,That does not make it polyclonal.
23726,It is still considered a monoclonal antibody treatment.
23727,"I tend to think those taking the tests are likely to be heavily weighted to covid cases, just because I think most people would tend to avoid going to get a test unless they feel like they have symptoms."
23728,That's just my opinion.
23729,I would be pretty terrified in an area of 9% positivity if that truly translated to the whole population; wouldn't leave my home!
23730,I'm not doing either for years.

23732,Also useally work in the worst hit areas.
23733,ROFLMAO.
23734,The issue with that is that number of deaths is a lagging indicator.
23735,It tells you what was happening 3-4 weeks ago.
23736,The number of confirmed cases is useful because it tells you what is happening a bit closer to the present although even then that's a lagging indicator too.
23737,What you need is solid contact tracing and to predict how many people every known case came in contact with.
23738,That's harder to use as an easy to understand metric though.
23739,Yea it’s one of the internet’s downsides.

23749,"At least the numbers for the RT-PCR tests give us a usable lower bound on the false negative rates, because we know ID NOW is even less sensitive."
23750,Like the great Donald Trump said.... the China virus is a hoax .....
23751,I don't know if its gonna get bigger or not?
23752,"If it does we are ready if not we are ready, but its blown out of proportion and drink hand sanitizer that will cure you.... and who has the China virus HAHAHAHHA drink sanitizer you asshole thet will cure you.... looks good on him ..... FUCK TRUMP 2020"

Either way I guess the idea is to stay home and recover"
23757,may you shit in peace
23758,&gt; ... try to run the Government like a business.
23759,I know this is what Trump *claims* he's doing; perhaps it's true in some sense.
23760,But I have to believe he wouldn't last a week running any business where he was accountable for his performance.
23761,He's also a fucking test patient for mixing powerful steroids with experimental polyclonal treatments.
23762,I mean this goes beyond best medical care.
23763,This seems desperate.
23764,It really is a shame districts didn't start developing robust online learning (bc it can be done) back in the spring.
23765,"There was a huge missed opportunity, though I can understand that most people were in denial that the fall could possibly be as bad as epidemiologists were predicting."
23766,I certainly don't have the answer for kids lacking the various minimum resources to learn at home.
23767,Oops
23768,I haven’t counted but I’ve been doing the same since march as well.
23769,Hugs.
23770,Didn’t know that.
23771,I live in the Santa Cruz mountains and was evacuated for a month and a half.
23772,I just got back and everything is still a mess.
23773,The smoke cleared then returned with a vengeance when more parts of the state caught fire.
23774,My point was that everything you just said is 100% wrong and would most likely be the exact opposite.
23775,"If the have a finical incentive, isn't the biggest finical incentive to make cheap fast tests, sell 1 million times more of them that what they are selling today."
23776,"And sell to everywhere in the world, not just the USA."
23777,"Ontop of that, other people are trying to do exactly this."
23778,"It's only a matter of time before someone beats them to it, then their expensive PCR tests go to $0 as every one is now using the better test."
23779,The Hasidim will just run the schools but make it look like they’re closed.
23780,And somehow that will not be punished.
23781,I believe there was at least one Yeshiva doing this last spring in Williamsburg.
23782,Can't tell if you're sarcastic or not.
23783,If we had been isolated earlier and more aggressively then we would have been past this point.
23784,Instead we have to revisit the half hearted efforts again.
23785,What gain will they have from requiring masks after COVID is over?
23786,Means they shut all bars and restaurants among other things
23787,Well earned
23788,"Where I am, compliance is really high."
23789,I even had to tell a dude in line at the store the other day to please give me six feet and he just profusely apologized and had a brain fart.
23790,Stay safe out there.
23791,We've had some clustered outbreaks but overall the community spread has been low for months.
23792,1626 public schools in the us according to the same source.
23793,15/1626 is pretty fucking good.
23794,Tiny breastfed babies rarely get very sick with colds and similar viruses.
23795,"I believe it's because the baby backwashes a bit of virus into the breast and the mother produces antibodies, which the baby subsequently drinks."
23796,"But hey, maybe I dreamt that explanation"
23797,Seems like all of the phase 3 trial vaccines are relatively safe.
23798,"Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford have shown no severe side effects."
23799,Let's hope Pfizer has enough data to apply for EUA at the end of this month so we can hopefully start seeing vaccines go out sometime in november to the most at risk and healthcare workers.
23800,I’m thinking they are downplaying the seriousness.
23801,He made the video probably against doctors advice.
23802,Its just that the mask mandate in my state at least isn't a 100% compliant right now which I cant understand.
23803,I don’t know what those things are lol.
23804,&gt;EDIT: Apparently acetominophen and dexamethasone are often administered as pretreatments for monoclonal antibody treatments (i.e.

Nope, it's POLYclonal, not mono clonal:

23815,The idea that the Saints player had a “false positive” since the most recent two tests were negative is bullshit.

23857,I saw an interesting post on r/askhistorians where they noted that fascist parties and control-oriented groups often have a loyalty test so as to mandate that any potential members show their dedication publicly.
23858,"The comparison given was that the Yakuza cut off a certain finger, which permanently marks any member as such for life."
23859,"For the GOP, the masks are a publicly-visible mechanism for showing affiliation."
23860,"u/spoinkulous made a good point that the GOP is a reactionary party, meaning that their ideology is generally based on reactions to events or other policies; by default, this means that they had to take a public position on masks when mask-wearing became a health recommendation coming from on high in basically every trusted or educated direction."
23861,"Since the GOP’s base is filled with the wealthy elderly and the uneducated rural Americans, both of whom bristle at the notion that the government would mandate anything that would change how these people (I guess this one’s a “we”, since I’m a semi-rural Texan) do business, the GOP had to take up an opposing position to widespread mask-wearing."

23880,This is what I’d like to know.
23881,1) What is the risk of transmission from socially distanced outdoor gathering of 6 people and 2 toddlers?
23882,2) Should I volunteer our potential risk to others (our guests) or does an outdoor socially distanced gathering already take into account that someone may have COVID?
23883,Therefore disclosure of risk to other attendees is not required.
23884,3) By not disclosing to other attendees your potential risk are you removing their ability to consent to exposure?

23903,"They’re the high risk ones, not me, so I’m about to throw up my hands and say, fine, see you at Thanksgiving but don’t blame me if you get it."
23904,Both pro and anti lockdown?
23905,"From my personal experience they tend towards the latter, but from the post history this guy *claims* to be pro lockdown."
23906,What even is his intent?
23907,"Howdy, neighbor."
23908,"I think you meant ""My *illegitimate* governor."""
23909,Don't forget he was responsible for counting the ballots in his own election.
23910,They’re foreign bad faith actors that want to see the west fall to Corona.
23911,It’s sad really
23912,"Maybe because everyone has evacuated due to the fires, or quarantining because of the smoke?"
23913,"Literally, just compare the way you've responded to people compared to how I've responded."
23914,You can say your same points in a much more neutral way without insulting people.
23915,But they interact with and can spread it to people at higher risk.
23916,Was my school district abnormal?
23917,All classes took a field trip to a health education center every year in elementary school.
23918,So i learned what incubation periods are by 5th grade.

23921,There is no far left in the US.
23922,Very reasonable socialist policies get trotted as the path to gulags and bread lines here.
23923,The actual far left would be people who want nearly fully planned economies.
23924,Not supporting their side but I think their position is that nothing should be “compulsory” in the “land of the free”.
23925,Idiotic of course because they sure do pick and choose what issues they don’t want to be compulsory.
23926,Completely Misused?

23938,It's a very overt sign that something is going on.
23939,You can't avoid it or pretend you don't see what is going on and that bothers them because they want to pretend COVID doesn't exist.
23940,No they don't have disciplined.
23941,"Not even many people wearing the mask, because they still misuse them or don't maintain distance."
23942,"I'm saying that if we (Dutch) all wore a mask properly, we'd be disciplined enough to stick to the far more effective measures."
23943,"Just like the Asian countries, if they didn't wear the masks they would still not have outbreaks because they do maintain the discipline."
23944,Is ANYONE surprised?
23945,Anyone?
23946,Hold them close!
23947,"Figuratively of course...It definitely sucks short term, I’m trying to comfort myself knowing that this is who they are and I’d rather know now instead of 10 years from now."

23949,"&gt; Kyle shot on unarmed man who chased him and threw a bag at him

Being unarmed does not mean you cannot be shot for aggressing on someone."

23951,"Rosenbaum also tried to take Rittenhouse's gun, this is confirmed by witness McGinnis in the report as released by Detective Cepress."

23953,"How was Rittenhouse ""interfering with protesters?"""
23954,"You said this same thing yesterday, except you said he was ""*fucking with protesters,*"" what is your source on that?"
23955,Rosenbaum was the aggressor in the videos.
23956,"&gt; Let me guess, you’re going to say it was a Molotov just like all your buddies have claimed."
23957,"No, it absolutely was not a molotov."
23958,My guess is that there are more people infected but the white house doesn't want that information released.
23959,"Sounds like EDIT: someone’s mad because their anti-lockdown horse shit ain’t flying

At best you’re an unwitting propaganda mouth piece."
23960,At worst..
23961,Your appeal to ethos doesn’t work when people know lockdowns work.
23962,"Yes it is, they are everywhere on this subreddit"
23963,They hate minor inconveniences that much.
23964,That’s all it is.
23965,"They hate being asked to do anything they don’t want to do, no matter how simple it is"
23966,There was almost no testing in February.
23967,"When they said ""New Rochelle"", there were probably already 100,000 cases in NYC itself."
23968,Is it really that painful to wear a mask to people?
23969,Many hospitals stopped all non emergency or elective procedures.
23970,All the staff responsible for performing those are now less busy.
23971,Even when the procedures are available many people put them off because they are worried about exposure or don't want to be in the hospital alone.
23972,Aren't most common colds also coronaviruses?
23973,"They're less severe, sure, but we get them year after year."
23974,"Yeah, why can't everyone just go into Facebook echo chambers to do their research instead of listening to trained medical professionals who spent years in school doing actual research, right?"
23975,Obviously they couldn't know possibly as much as you.
23976,They take the opposite position of anyone who is moderate...
23977,"“Our PM says we should not concentrate on the negative things” recipe of a huge disaster, and if it’s not like you are in a great situation either"
23978,No that’s not it at all.
23979,It means any test just shows that moment in time.
23980,"Doesn’t mean you aren’t positive later and if not enough virus is present yet, you will get a false negative."
23981,Tests are never an excuse to not wear a mask.

24002,We can have a meeting about the most minor issue and making decisions turn into a stupid struggle for power and domination.
24003,It's follow the leader.
24004,Humans will generally follow the leader into hell if instructed.
24005,Fortunately we have the free press to document all of this.
24006,This area is the area that was first put under local lockdown in February and the tests date back to july so that's at least 5 months.
24007,People who refuse to wear masks aren't even quarrantining when they test positive.

24017,Authoritarian iron fists are not the answer to an over hyped flu that only kills the very weak and ill.

24021,Don't tell this to r/NoNewNormal
24022,"Well, yes and no."
24023,At first he insisted he would still go to the sharks game the same weekend after the government said non-essential gatherings of 500+ people should be avoided.
24024,He only changed his mind because he was afraid of his attendance being 'misrepresented.
24025,He had to be dragged along.
24026,I downloaded some travel channels on my Roku.
24027,I plan to watch so I can see what highlights I want to visit when I can travel again.
24028,"Also, some exercise ones."
24029,I need to be more active and eat better than I did on the last lockdown.
24030,"I put on some weight, which I've since lost."
24031,"I tend to gain in winter, so my goal is to at least not gain weight."
24032,"If I can lose, great, but maintaining would be a win too."
24033,I also stocked up on pantry basics so I can cook more on the weekends.
24034,"I've been on medical leave (non Covid), but I'm going back to work soon."
24035,"My workdays are really long and not conducive to cooking, so I'm planning on meal prepping on weekends and in the morning, before work."
24036,That's also when I want to get my exercise in.
24037,"Considering getting a slow cooker for soups, etc."
24038,I get rush projects that require immediate attention and sometimes hours to complete.
24039,"I'm afraid if I cook on the stovetop, things will burn or boil over or catch fire."
24040,"I have some friends who are being careful and taking this seriously, so I can invite one or two of them over for dinner."
24041,"Apartment is small, so that's the max I can have and social distance."
24042,Do you think that Dutchies have any discipline?
24043,"I can tell you NO, unless they are forced to it."
24044,"I have been to many Asian countries and there you see that people have a general discipline, that's why those countries are doing way better than those stubborn Dutchies"
24045,And yet today a church held ceremonies for 600 people 3 times....

24081,Our premier and a few others went to a crammed maskless wedding then opened casinos and bungled up schools and it’s all been a waste of effort on the part of everyone who has used common sense.
24082,Schools were closed for 6 months and my government was given $1.3bil to safely open schools and all they did was fire teachers and increase class sizes while acting like they ran out of money.
24083,They still have a billion dollars left they didn’t spend.
24084,Then this weekend a friend from high school had a wedding where I live and all his guests including others from school are from out of province or from Ottawa and Toronto which have the highest new infection rates.
24085,No masks.
24086,I get people are tired of it but all the places that don’t have community transmission or really really low infections are the ones where everyone nuts up and shuts up for a short period of time and apparently we can’t do that.

24138,"When the other person said it's ""statistically likely that Trump will be fine,"" they meant that any one specific person--even an 80-year-old--is very likely to survive COVID."
24139,A person in Trump's age group has about a 98% chance to live (not controlling for comorbidities).

24157,Is the average time from infection to death known (for those people who have died)?
24158,"I've been trying to find any information, but haven't found it."
24159,There is lots of data on death rates broken down by age group and other demographics.
24160,Articles about specific individuals occasionally mention how long someone was sick before they died.
24161,I can't find anything about averages or ranges.
24162,Do we know of any cases where someone died two days after infection?
24163,A week?
24164,Do most people who get sick and die take 2 weeks or a month before succumbing?
24165,"Is it known, and if it is, has it changed since early on?"
24166,"The only article I found that seems semi-close to answering the question was on plos.org and mentioned the impact of duration of exposure (not duration of illness) on mortality and only covered deaths through March 28th, so it didn't answer my question and is also outdated."

24227,"Than shut up, mask up, and take every recommended precaution, because the more people do that the sooner this will be over."
24228,They're hoping more Democrats die then Republicans.
24229,I think that's a bad bet.
24230,I live in NYC.
24231,People have been reckless for some time now.
24232,Not surprised at all.
24233,There was a place that threw a 300 person wedding in the last week or two.
24234,"I mean, literally everything is in space."

24241,There is a massive amount of water in space.
24242,He's legally murdering his constituents.
24243,Agreed.

24263,No-one died in Vietnam until the end of July 2020 and they've had a total of 35 deaths.
24264,It looks like they've crushed their second wave as well and life is almost back to normal again with a low risk of catching this disease with normal everyday living (with some realistic precautions).
24265,Just saying.
24266,Haha listen to the little kid getting his panties in a twist because he got his bullshit called out.
24267,If you don't like it try checking facts next time.
24268,That i totally agree with....thanks for the interesting news from NZ
24269,I had empathy the first three months of this bullshit.
24270,Now we’re still on lockdown just so grandma can go to the grocery store and I’m over it lol
24271,"*This is fucking rich coming from you, btw.you just listed four days ago that you were going to a meetup at a bar."
24272,Fucking hypocrite.
24273,Not everyone is an agoraphobic shut-in.
24274,It doesn't make someone mentally weak to require socializing to feel normal.
24275,The North remembers
24276,A.
24277,The graph shows a dotted blue line that is the average flu deaths for the year.
24278,"It was already lower prior to lockdowns, then it sometimes continues slightly below (as it was going that way anyway) and sometimes hits the average amount of deaths for flu."
24279,B.
24280,"They are always lower at around summer time than winter, that is how the flu works."
24281,"Again, if you were the expert you claim to be you'd know this."
24282,Even the dotted line displaying the average flu deaths reflects this.
24283,C. I never said that they don't stop the spread.
24284,I said these measures aren't nearly as effective as people think and come at a grave cost.
24285,Oxfam predicted millions to die of hunger alone because of lockdowns.
24286,"That is not including delayed or cancelled hospital appointments for more dangerous conditions like cancer, it's not including how severe poverty always leads to increased deaths in society, it's not including suicides, more people dying of drug overdose and the other side effects of lockdowns."
24287,"My point is, I don't think forcing everyone into their houses until a miracle vaccine shows up is the best approach."
24288,"That doesn't mean I'm okay with people dying of COVID, obviously but you'll paint it as that anyway."
24289,People in this subreddit always demonize anyone who disagrees with them.
24290,I think a more balanced approach would be a better solution to dealing with it.
24291,"Many officials have said that like other diseases, we will have to instead learn to live with COVID being a disease that will unfortunately kill people, similarly to TB or the flu."
24292,Also don't talk to me about balls when you are terrified of going outside and catching the rona.
24293,Most likely from postprocessing
24294,Daily reminder the only solution is contaiment with an aim at eradication (but not an expectation).
24295,"Testing that is smart, and smart restrictions."
24296,"So that a city which genuinely has no outbreaks can just chill out and hang out and maybe even let go of wearing masks, go to movies, etc."
24297,"Because, in that setting you could afford a couple superspreading events."
24298,"You'd catch them, impose restrictions, trace and contain them, and as things improved remove the restrictions."
24299,It's the only way.
24300,"And given there might be future pandemics with other novel diseases, it's an infrastructure worth building."
24301,Like a civil defense infrastructure.
24302,The fewer hard and fast rules the better.
24303,The more strict criteria on government before imposing hard rules the better.
24304,But a clear system.
24305,"An staged alert where ""now is the time for masks""."
24306,Where closing schools is easier than closing bars is easier than a full lockdown.
24307,Where businesses and school develop a hybrid system of learning and can flex any time between online and in person.
24308,Nothing else will work.
24309,"Herd immunity and vaccines won't eradicate, or protect in the long run."
24310,"You need monitoring and controls anyway, as vaccines will be unevenly administered and not fully effective."
24311,"So can we just set a up a solid surveillance and countermeasures system so we truly can go back to normal, because we'll know if it did show up again in our community?"
24312,There should be a subreddit for local news station Facebook comments.
24313,I swear to god the only reason I haven’t deleted Facebook is I’m addicted to reading these comments
24314,Have you checked Spain?
24315,"Also August was a huge month for vacation, especially in France."
24316,The whole city of Paris essentially shuts down as folks leave for the month.

24323,"Thirdly, the virus got here regardless of how far away NZ from anywhere."
24324,It still got to NZ and you still have to take action.
24325,"Lastly, every nation has soverign control over it's borders."
24326,Every country has responded differtly and in their own way but it's unfair to compare lots of different countries to each other.
24327,Phh those are rooky numbers

24688,Its social media i guess?
24689,I’ve been trying it out during this time.
24690,Basically you find a group you’re interested in and join and then you can hop on and chat with people or maybe do activities (im in a writing one that posts prompts).

24701,"I have seen anecdotes and some reports that a meaningful percentage of people suffer detectable organ damage, but not the ""permanent"" or ""disabling"" part."
24702,EDIT: Business Insider is a sensationalist rag.
24703,The smart thing would have been too just have a prepared statement read and that's it; maybe even read by the hospital administrator or by Meadows rather than having his team of physicians come out.
24704,"There are any number of plausible reasons for it to happen that way: HIPAA, National Security, the rapidly changing nature of the disease."
24705,"Unfortunately, now that they've started doing it this way, if they change then it will look suspicious."
24706,The doctors are going to have to come out and take questions.
24707,I and others dismiss them for not bringing sound arguments to the discussion.
24708,"Sure, the hivemind can be wrong, I've seen it when misinformation is the basis of the majority opinion, and that leads to people shutting down others."
24709,"But in simple situations like this, it's pretty hard to fuck it up, the basic facts aren't all that obscure, it's pretty clear what's real and isn't, so people seem to slam BS."
24710,"Getting better at forming arguments can help get past it, if you have solid reasoning to base it on."
24711,[deleted]
24712,Looking at overall ranking as a whole is meaningless.
24713,UGA's ranking is artificially inflated by a number of fluffy liberal arts programs and its top ranked agriculture program (lol).
24714,"When you drill down into actual academic rigor and reputation metrics, UGA ranks very low (3.5/5.0)

Even their business school isn't any better than Georgia Tech's, a fucking engineering school."
24715,They recommended the use of masks while saying it didn't work.
24716,It went from no one wearing it to a few people wearing it.
24717,"In two weeks, they'll triumphally say ""Look, we talked about masks and cases are still going up, look at how right we were, they're not working""."
24718,Schadenfreude
24719,Good to know the United States will have all the vaccines it wants.
24720,"Maybe if I read enough American subreddits, I’ll pick up some immunity by osmosis."
24721,At least for 6 months before it fades.
24722,Also lol at the url saying the opposite of the article.
24723,Someone missed that one.
24724,88% is the number that physician's want to keep people above.
24725,"However as was stated be others there are additional factors such as how fast they are breathing, if they have to use abdominal muscles to breath etc."
24726,96% is fine but if a person is working super hard to keep it at 96 then eventually they are going to tire out and won't be able to maintain it.
24727,WOW this situation came out of nowhere I'm a little bit confused as to the timeline of all people getting infected can anyone clear this up for me.
24728,Bet they regret [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53244688) now.
24729,There's barely any spread in my state except in the rural areas and the imported protesters from out of state.
24730,But then everywhere I've been (I don't go out much but that's because of racism too) everyone has been using masks.
24731,"Unfortunately I'm sure people travel so despite how much we've suffered (cinemas still not open) to try and stay ""safe"" from COVID, there's nothing we can do if some irresponsible infected anti mask person comes from and irresponsible out of control state and spreads it here."
24732,I'm not mad at you but at Florida's leadership.
24733,"It feels like we're in a lifeboat with holes in it, and the mask people are frantically sticking their fingers in the holes and baling water like their lives depend on it."
24734,"And the other half of the lifeboat is busy partying, spilling alcohol into the boat, rocking it and making more holes."
24735,"No matter how hard the responsible people work or how much they sacrifice, in the end the **idiots are going to take all of us down** with their stupidity because with COVID a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and our chain is rusted rotten in many parts."
24736,I guess it depends entirely on him.
24737,"If he humbled himself and urged precaution, that could be a good thing."
24738,"If he chooses to downplay things, his base will eat it up."
24739,The entirety of has Europe faced mass infections.
24740,They have dealt with them with varying levels of competence and success.
24741,This in no way changes the fact that we may very well never have had to deal with this pandemic if China has not supressed those who tried to give them and the rest of the world an early warning.

24748,If Vietnam and S.Korea can do it other countries can too.
24749,USA has a lot of people but it has a comparatively low population density compared to places in Europe and Asia.

24754,"wow 

Is this attitude different from your neighbors in Italy or germany?"
24755,"Pay wall

But there are like 6 leading vaccines that have no long term data."
24756,Maybe they only protect for 6 months.
24757,Is it safe to mix different kinds of vaccines?
24758,"""It's a Democratic Hoax,"" move along, nothing to see here..."
24759,"Despite the seriousness of the situation and all that, I must say I've had a fantastic time reading some comments on this thread, particularly the fart for two minutes of released tension one."

24761,Piece.

24777,Does it thrive more in colder weather?

24891,"I don't live in Toronto, I live in York."
24892,"These 2 regions are separated by Steeles Avenue (north of which is York, south of which is Toronto)."
24893,There are a lot of people who live in York and work in Toronto (my sister is an example--she works at a school in Toronto but lives in Markham).
24894,Toronto is literally the epicenter of the virus (and second only to Ottawa in terms of per capita daily new cases).
24895,"The fact that there is so much interaction between the residents of the City of Toronto, Regional Municipality of York (Markham, Richmond Hill, Newmarket, Aurora, etc...)  and Regional Municipality of Peel--another notable hotspot (which includes Mississauga) means that if you don't contact trace the people that live and work in different regions, you can't find out who is infected and where they got it from."

24898,My uncle was in the ICU COVID-only unit on a ventilator and got something like 3-4 false negatives in a row before he tested positive.
24899,His doctors put him in the covid ward before the positive came back though because the chances of him randomly having something else that can take a healthy adult from perfectly fine to being on a ventilator within 2 days were slim.
24900,"If he was still testing negative while that sick, how many asymptomatic people were there that got false negatives and then went about their normal routines spreading it around because they were cleared?"
24901,I hope your non US state isn’t dependent on tourism!

24907,"People fought because they saw an imperalist, like the French, who came and murder even more people."
24908,"You're also comparing 1960-1970s, middle of Cold War with colonists uprising everywhere, versus 2000s-now where peace is much more common."

24913,Yeah it's got to be the time of year as much as anything.
24914,"A bunch of Southern Hemisphere countries which didn't have a major first wave have been battling second waves over their winter months as things calmed down in the northern summer, with varying degrees of success (Australia and New Zealand wrestling things back under control, South Africa and Argentina not so much)."

24916,France just broke its record for daily new cases.
24917,You are missing the point.
24918,It doesn’t take lockdown to contain the virus unless it gets out of control.
24919,"Many places in the US had the virus contained, but then opened too quickly and didn’t enforce the rules that we know work."
24920,Testing remained inadequate.
24921,So places like Texas lost ground on the virus.

Another elephant-sized nuance here is this: WTH does ""quarantine""mean here."
25105,A large chunk of people have already cut their social contacts to the zero/minimum (let's call it level 1) a more strict quarantine basically means an attempt to A. stay home 100% of time B. try to fully isolate from household members (lets call it level2).

25237,Almost every organisation I have heard of that is testing members is treating the tests as if negative means safe.
25238,That is ABSOLUTELY not how they're supposed to be used and I find it infuriating!
25239,From what I've read the recovery process could take months.
25240,The receding symptoms are a good indicator but the total recovery varies by a lot between individuals.
25241,Stay strong and take care of your self.
25242,Even more now than before.
25243,Strong mentality is important too.
25244,"Australia has the advantage that it’s legal for states to close their borders to each other, that’s not legal in the US."
25245,"But you do realize an R rate over 1 is not good, especially when a “ton of things” are open."
25246,It’s self feeding infection rate.
25247,We already know they are stupid.
25248,More evidence is just meh at this point.
25249,"Tests are somewhat reliable \~5 days after you were in contact with the infected person, but they can still show ""negative"" even though you're actually infected."
25250,"After only 2 or 3 days, tests are very unreliable and still negative in most cases, if I remember correctly."
25251,I think they're most reliable something like 6 or 7 days after contracting it (but still not 100%).
25252,That's a very evasive way of saying you have no evidence of the virus being outside of China before December 2019.
25253,"Lol ""gym rats'"
25254,"Yeah when the Conley was talking I was skeptical, but when the Walter Reed doctors were talking I had more faith that what they were saying was true"
25255,Yep.
25256,"Problem is the US really doesnt have any way to shut down every state at the same time for the same amount of time, even if Trump tried doing that, there would be thousands of lawsuits holding it up for years."
25257,After Trump took office I did an experiment where I invested in a few industries and businesses getting strong favors from the administration.
25258,I only selected those with clear and uncomplicated means of making money.
25259,These were some of the worst investments I ever made and they all did horribly due to either corruption or mismanagement.
25260,Well that's what I get for dealing with the devil.
25261,"If you look at Trumps response, every step of the way, it has been to make the pandemic worse."
25262,"If he was trying to deliberately sabotage America, there is nothing else he would have done."
25263,Good news for sniffer dog trials.
25264,No you advocate for people who choose not to wear masks to have the equivalent public discourse as those were following scientific guidance.
25265,"If you really were truly Pro mask then you wouldn't be advocating for those who reject your rational, evidence-based position."
25266,There is absolutely zero disunity in the medical Community right now masks absolutely are effective if used properly.
25267,We have mountains of fresh evidence demonstrated in mask adoption during pandemic clusters and the effects reduction in hospitalization and deaths.
25268,There is zero objectively rational argument that can be made to not wear a mask right now.
25269,Advocating for equal discussion place for people who reject science based on gut feelings and stubbornness is not helpful and has no place and social Discourse.
25270,Wearing masks in public isn't the game changer so many people on here constantly shout about.

25287,Is this the sentiment in many American cities?
25288,"Thank you, this is a really good explanation"
25289,"The problem is that they are treating 'negative' as 'definitely doesn't have COVID', which is not how the tests work."
25290,"It doesn't make them shoddy - a test which has a high false negative rate can still be super useful for population-level statistics, but the issue is that once you tell an *individual* their negative result, they think it means they're safe..."
25291,There is no way I'm doing that test daily unless I absolutely had to.
25292,Find another method of testing if you want me to test with any frequency.
25293,Trump's entire life
25294,Congrats for being ahead of the curve I guess?
25295,You should stop listening to Trump.
25296,"If you believe him or think he's even remotely smart, that says more about you than anything."
25297,I have no facts to back it up.
25298,This processing out loud on reddit.
25299,But there has to be something that is compelling people to take more risk.
25300,"Yeah, they love quoting Rand Paul when he downplays the virus."
25301,You would think they would believe the consensus of epidemiologists over an ophthalmologist whose career also depends on him sticking to the red party line.
25302,Exactly my thought.
25303,"This is a behavioral issue, closing the stores does not end the behavior."
25304,Maybe start imposing legal ramifications?
25305,"This is targeted at Hasidic communities I believe, Hasidic people aren’t fully integrated into American culture so they won’t necessarily just go to the next zip code"

25314,Lol my comment got removed for being political as I was responding to a political comment.
25315,Great job!
25316,I think it's the same thought process behind their opposition to universal healthcare.
25317,"It's not that the thing is bad, although some fringe elements might argue that case."
25318,The opposition is to the government mandating it.
25319,Small-government conservatives think it should be up to individuals to decide whether or not they want to wear a mask and that the government mandating it sets a dangerous precedent.
25320,This is of course the same party that wants to ban abortion but that intersection of beliefs doesn't seem to bother them.
25321,I'll give you a straight answer since nobody else seems to want to.
25322,The reason my GOP friends give for their position is **opposition to** **government overreach**.
25323,"The principle is that the government should not have the power to compel individuals to behave in a prescribed manner unless there is legislation to that effect (and they generally believe we already have too many laws and regulations, that government is ""too big""), and legislation has to be constitutional -- no law anywhere in the US can go against the basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution."
25324,"Some of my friends actually wear masks, but argue that they shouldn't be forced to."
25325,"Others believe the reported effects of the virus are exaggerated, and try to get away with not wearing a mask at all and participating in gatherings to demonstrate their opposition to he government decrees."
25326,"Many of those also gather for church services in opposition to government decrees, because they hold that any government decree restricting religious practice is unconstitutional on its face."
25327,"It's the same reasoning used to object to the ACA's individual mandate As described in [one of the court challenges](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-10011-CV0.pdf) to the ACA, for example:

""the individual mandate injures ... individual plaintiffs, by requiring them to buy insurance that they do not want, ... \[it\] is unconstitutional because it \[is not\] a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power."""
25328,"The feeling underlying all this is that if you allow government to do something it's not supposed to do, even for a short time, it will keep doing it and people will accept it."
25329,"They fear the ""nanny state"" where government assumes powers that it doesn't have, and they distrust the motives of the individuals in power."
25330,"There's nothing wrong with this reasoning, because there are many cases in history where government does things  that citizens don't want and it tends to keep doing it."
25331,"I think there are two basic problems that brought us to where we are: first, the US government (Trump &amp; co.) so badly mis-managed the pandemic response that many people believe things that aren't true; and second, the initial response included government actions (such as governors issuing stay-at-home orders) that don't really have a good legal basis when used long-term."
25332,"If the government tells you you can't leave your house or you can't gather or you can't operate your business because of some emergency, you grumble but comply for a couple of weeks because you see the necessity and you're used to doing what you're told."
25333,"But if that ""emergency"" streteches on for months, and administrations at all levels just keep on issuing orders without doing the legislative work needed to put them on a sound footing, you arrive at where we are."
25334,It's from a livestream hosted by the [Royal Irish Academy](https://www.ria.ie/learning-pandemics-century-experience).
25335,"Link to video on their official youtube channel here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BonX0ZiMQIY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3808

And since I don't even know who Dr Ryan is, I looked him up."
25336,&gt;Michael Joseph Ryan is an Irish former trauma surgeon and epidemiologist specialising in infectious disease and public health.
25337,"He is executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, leading the team responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19."
25338,"The youngest and fittest can get it first, lots of us will sit back and see how well they fare first."
25339,"The problem is: If you are believing in a god without evidence, how do you know that you are not applying the same reasoning in other areas of your life?"
25340,"Besides, beliefs do not exist in a vacuum, your belief in a god is surely impacting other beliefs you have, and so those beliefs are not well supported."
25341,&gt; anymore.
25342,"Tough for those almost 5,900 or so who didn't make it."
25343,There's no good reason this number couldn't have been a lot less.
25344,Europe isn't a country.
25345,&gt;Nope.
25346,I'm right on both accounts.
25347,There was going to be a drug test if Team Biden agreed.
25348,So then there wasn't going to be.
25349,"&gt;You just lied again, as Trump said he would be drug tested as well:
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;See?"
25350,Here's him saying it live.
25351,"^
&gt;
&gt;You just lied."
25352,Trump saying anything doesn't mean shit when he lies constantly.
25353,"This is a man that said he would release his tax returns and not play golf while president, and look how that turned out.."
25354,"If a drug test were to actually happen only Biden would be tested, much like how only Biden took the Covid test, and probably claim national security or some bullshit as an excuse."
25355,&gt;Obviously.
25356,"We all know Biden has the questions ahead of time as well, but he would need radio help too."
25357,Lol.
25358,Now this is desperation.
25359,You can't handle the fact that for every major presidential debate in history every single candidate except yours came off as not being a fucking idiot.
25360,&gt;Another lie.
25361,Name one.
25362,"And don't ignore the part of what I said that you didn't feel like quoting, anything much stronger than caffeine and you just seem like you're manic."
25363,"You could load up on Adderall like Trump appeared to, but that's not helpful unless you want to look basically like he did when he embarrassed himself on stage."
25364,"Deaths will come, based on the numbers, like 200-300 a day for a long time"

25440,"For a minute, we were able to truly physically distance students and maintain contact tracing info."
25441,That just isn't a reality any longer.
25442,"Fantastic response, thank you"
25443,The American people have betrayed themselves with their asinine politics.

25446,Heard this about houston

25449,Umm I work for HCPS and the classes are a normal size.

25451,"Also, some kids are missing school from being sick but arent getting tested because it isnt severe."
25452,Vietnam is a communist country with corrupt regime and you believe their numbers without critical thought.

25464,I would say it’s more about individualism.

25472,I would love to ask the dude “do you accept that it was gods plan for you to give trump and a bunch of other Republicans coronavirus?”
25473,~120 million in the states
25474,"Their cases per 100k is 29,000 vs USA @ 23,000."
25475,Their deaths are only 184 per million vs usa @ 646.
25476,Weird disparity going on there.
25477,I assume it could be due to the recent surge in infection in frame and/or how many early cases USA did not find.
25478,The fact that you got downvoted for saying this clearly demonstrates that these far left activists want a system similar to the one found in China.
25479,Covid is just used as an excuse to implement it.

25524,"The Spanish flu also had a weird evolutionary event, where the sickest people spread the disease more than the mild cases."
25525,"Soldiers on the front stayed on the front if they were mild, and the sickest ones got sent back to  hospitals in population centres."
25526,"So the worse strains of the flu were the ones that were the most mobile, leading to a worse second wave."
25527,Because not everyone will be vaccinated at the same moment in time.....
25528,Don’t be ridiculous.
25529,Nobody died before March 2020.
25530,"I’ve never seen him look so pale before, didn’t even think it was possible..."
25531,If they all survive that would be an extremely odd look from an outsiders view.
25532,Press would haunt them.
25533,My worry is that they start to hide their positivity in public eye.
25534,As long as they continue to announce positivity the there will at least be some form of accountability

25538,Time to have real consequences.
25539,"This will never fly with the hippocratic oath and general cruel and unusual and inhumane nature of such a course of action, but I still support it."

25544,That's definitely a factor.
25545,I was just stating a separate factor I thought was relevant.
25546,Someone didn't like it apparently.
25547,"Right, so I've had patients worth hundreds of millions and yet they still have the same chance of dying as everyone else."
25548,What's intense about viral infection is that most of the time we don't have a definitive treatment outside of supplemental.
25549,"Sure, money helps, but right now we treat cytokine storm with dexamethasone, which is cheap."

25577,People in my small town are still going out without masks on.
25578,And a big wedding in town with nobody wearing masks.
25579,I didn't say that either.
25580,You have a reading comprehension issue.
25581,Assuming this goes away before April without a vaccine is unlikely.
25582,The herd immunity disinformation narrative is taking a solid beating with cases picking back up in communities around the world that already had a very high seroprevalence.
25583,"We're at 16% nationally, adding 2% a month according to YYG."
25584,6 more months takes us to 30%.
25585,Borough Park is still experiencing outbreaks at around 50% seroprevalence.
25586,Sure it might be round.

25593,No talking about this guy going around in my local area of NY.
25594,Pay them extra for full face respirators.
25595,I teach high school in a conservative community and wear a full face respirator all day.
25596,"It sucks, but cases keep popping up and, even though the school doesn't admit it, we will NOT close."
25597,Not for anything.
25598,Ever.
25599,"There could be two students and no teachers left and they'll still pretend everything is normal, put on that happy face!"
25600,It's sick.
25601,Luckily I have a classroom microphone system.
25602,Fox is already saying it’s proof masks don’t work because if the President of the United States can get it then anyone can.
25603,"To be fair, idk if they downplayed the transmission of it."
25604,Only the severity of it.
25605,"So the irony is that if these 3 get only mild symptoms and come out no problems, it kinda ""proves"" their point in a way?"

25635,"The shutdown was more harmful than the disease around here, although I can't speak for city dwellers."
25636,drama
25637,Whats contributing to that number is their diet which is high on vitamin d and the fact that if you have people wearing masks the viral load at which someone catches the virus it isnt so great decreasing the severity of symptoms
25638,"No way, an article from fox to back up your claim, I'm shocked"

25640,I bet it was due to marketing.
25641,"Lmfao, the contrast between this and the Vietnam thread is hilarious."
25642,Remdesivir is an antiviral that has been tested quite vigorously.
25643,The drug cocktail he also took is an experimental antibodies one that hasn't.
25644,It means that AZ has not yet applied to the FDA for review.
25645,In all likelihood there is something positive happening in their trials and they are now reaching out to regulatory bodies from around the world to share their data as it comes in.
25646,I realize Phase III has not yet restarted in the U.S.
25647,"It may have something to do with this, of it may not."
25648,And then if you do get sick you are told to stay home until you are nearly dead.

25654,Next year is hopeful I think.
25655,Hope you’re right
25656,I noticed this too.
25657,More perplexing is that based on that time frame trump would have already been fever free for several hours before being flown to the hospital.
25658,Why would they wait for an improvement before hospitalizing him?
25659,"I love this idiots, pointing out something and -33 because it's about POTUS."
25660,"Now I see why Politicians appeal to their respective extreme groups, they're a bunch of idiots who refuse everything if it isn't aligned with their engrained extremist points."
25661,CA is doing well.
25662,They are even letting some restaurants open at a small capacity.
25663,How in god's name is FL at less than 1 (assuming the numbers are real because FL cooking the books)?
25664,Well...
25665,If it truly is it probably won't be for long now that they've just gone full without a mask mandate and the like.
25666,"I don’t think it was a false positive in May, as I did have symptoms."
25667,"I had headaches, muscle aches, chills, and I lost my sense of taste and smell."
25668,"This time around I am completely asymptomatic, so I’m not sure what to make of that."
25669,"I will try to get another test, but I’m still going to self-isolate until I get that negative result."
25670,"I am mostly bummed because my urgent surgery will have to be postponed, but I understand."
25671,"The frustrating part is that some people, not having lived through it, might make the argument that the situation was new and that people didn't know what to do and that a lot of the bad decision-making was dramatised."
25672,"No, people knew how dangerous this was, they knew how to stop it, they saw it happen in other countries (first China then Italy and Iran), they had the time to prepare, and they willfully neglected what they had to do to stop it, it was for the most part preventable."
25673,"I've heard a similar concern about how the wider Trump adminsitration could at some point be portrayed or argued for in the future, that people in the past might, with good intention, try to see things from their (people who support that administration's) point of view, and explain rationally why some middle class Americans might have voted for them and how things couldn't have been as bad and comical as they are portrayed."
25674,"Again no, they are, people have the knowledge available to them to make good decisions and they are basically willfully making the wrong ones."
25675,Don't spoil the 2020 season finale
25676,But... every person I know (besides my family and one immunocompromised friend and her bf) go out every other day WITHOUT wearing masks.
25677,"They go out to beaches, huge gatherings, parties concerts etc and spew out “covid is a myth”   I hope to Christ that... people eventually come to their senses and realize how serious it is"
25678,So it's a disease of fat republicans too fucking stupid to wear a mask.
25679,"That's truly funny considering what their president has done to create 130,000 unnecessary deaths."
25680,"Like Trump says, 'It is what it is suckers and losers, vote for me'."
25681,Look up Donald Trump State Park and read about how he turned a $2 million piece of crap land into a $100 million charitable donation.
25682,That wasn't taking advantage of tax laws...

25775,I worked in bioterrorism defense for a few years.
25776,Man... You don't even want to know.
25777,How  many people will actually do that correctly?
25778,Just how effective will  the cloth masks be at preventing spread when when you're cooped up  inside?
25779,I'm in Toronto with a similar climate and buildings to NYC and I'm not very optimistic about  this winter.
25780,We're seeing fairly large outbreaks just like NYC is.
25781,This is with a far fewer amount of people not respecting covid restrictions than seemingly many places in the US as well.
25782,Masks are mandatory and most people are respecting this but it's still spreading.
25783,"As long as the symptoms are gone, they are already good?"
25784, I can understand that they simply don’t have the staff or the hours in a day once there are a ton of cases.
25785,I mean a call to one contact generates a new list of contacts to call and so the lists grow exponentially each hour.
25786,Not to mention the calls that aren’t answered that must then be called again until they reach someone.
25787,To me it makes sense to have a person who may have been exposed to then call their own contacts.
25788,The contacts can easily call a health line if they further questions or need additional assistance.
25789,If the tracers call everyone on a restaurants attendance list and then each attendee calls their contacts.
25790,That’s a reasonable.

25799,"As such, most people won't gather indoor even if they can't gather outdoor."
25800,The smoke is causing people to either abstain from gathering altogether or switch from unprotected outdoor gathering to protected indoor gathering.

&gt; Face coverings must be worn over the nose and mouth and are required as guests enter, exit and move around the stadium."
25806,Face coverings must also be worn any time the recommended physical distance guidelines are unable to be sustained with others who are not in the same household.
25807,&gt; Stadium workers and athletics staff are required to wear face coverings at all times.
25808,"&gt; Each institution will decide whether or not they choose to allow tailgating “or other large gatherings of guests” on property that is owned or controlled by the institution, but it must adhere to either state and local guidelines and regulations or CDC recommendations."

25840,Just imagine if they can't develop an effective vaccine.
25841,Or imagine if a vaccine conveys immunity for only a few months.
25842,As long as the virus is allowed to spread and mutate the greater chance we have of not developing an effective vaccine.
25843,Right not the dominate strain of COVID is significantly more contagious than the strain that was circulating in the spring.
25844,"Couple that with the fact the dry cool/cold air is the perfect transmission mechanism, which is why flu season is October through February, we are looking at perfect storm setting up for the fall/winter."
25845,Add in the fact that governments are removing mask restrictions we are going to see what happened in NYC and Italy happen across the U.S.
25846,"The other funny thing that happens when hospitals get overrun is that the death rate skyrockets because the majority of patients can't be treated and are forced to stay at home, this is how entire families get wiped out."
25847,Doing pandemic exercises with Homeland Security when hospitals get over run they expect death rates to go up as much as 10X.
25848,"Take your vitamin D/K combination, and you want to be taking between 1,000 and 4,000 IU per day, you should take it in the morning or afternoon, taking it late in the day can mess up your sleep cycle."

25850,If you thought it was bad in the spring you ain't seen nothing yet.
25851,See Trump’s debate performance where DT derides Biden for wearing a mask all the time.
25852,DT has been the main source of disinformation.
25853,The glee you’ve noted is because so often the powerful and rich get away scot free in life.
25854,"DTs sloppy personal habits, bad dogma, denial of science, and bad leadership in the face of COVID-19 created (or at the very least worsened) the environment that caused him to fall ill.

25877,Are they all decently smart people but education systems and mentors and such have failed to teach them what's needed (like critical thinking) and society has let that go on too long?
25878,Who knows but I hope it's the latter because then I feel we can at least do something about it.
25879,One thing I've learned is that persuasiveness in this climate is inversely proportional to outrage.

26093,"Yes, some businesses are going to permanently close regardless, but lots of small businesses are closing because they couldn't get federal loans, and the stimulus expired months ago with nothing meaningful coming out of Congress and the White House."
26094,"And COVID-19 isn't only about deaths, it's also about long-term organ damage in survivors that could lead to increased medical needs &amp; costs."
26095,Best route is to maintain the measures in the EOs (while flexibly adjusting them based on circumstance) and call on the federal government to pass a second bill with an improved small-medium business loans program until a vaccine gets broadly distributed.
26096,"Our country failed to address this problem adequately so there'll be consequences for that, but allowing a large second wave to occur by stripping the EOs will be an enormous mistake."

26128,The White House was using the rapid tests as if they were metal detectors for guns which is scientifically ignorant.
26129,The White House Covid stately plan was based on the use of frequent rapid testing and pretty much nothing else.
26130,And right before he got sick Trump was advertising his plan to shit millions of the same rapid testing kits across the nation and that was going to end all the other measures states have been implementing.

26152,"there is a difference between the lockdown unemployment and the - let's say - ""regular"" unemployment."
26153,"speaking of the lockdown, it's MUCH harder to find a new job since many spheres are borderline non-existent and many companies stopped hiring new employees because of the crisis."
26154,this is a way more mentally devastating situation.
26155,Antwerp (Belgium) had a huge surge in August when the rest of Europe and Belgium seemed to be doing much better.
26156,"We had mandatory masks everywhere (even when no one as around) during a heatwave, restaurants and bars closing at 10;30 and a curfew at 11:30 with high fines and jailtime consequences to flatten the curve again."
26157,"It didn't help that no borders were shit down for travel and tourism (which I get) but almost everyone I know went on holiday to neighboring countries and France happens to be the next country with nice weather, no masks and a language most of us speak."
26158,I feel like everyone I know was in France in August/September.
26159,That can't have helped.
26160,"I take the restrictions seriously so I refused to go on holiday when I was in a high risk area, sadly the people who don't live by the restrictions are also the first to go to places with fewer restrictions and more likely to spread the virus."
26161,"Idk why you’re getting downvoted, you’re probably right."
26162,US is only on the first wave still..
26163,So are you saying Trump is receiving Regeneron's MAB under compassionate use?
26164,Isn't compassionate use for those under threat of imminent death without any other options?
26165,Are there not others who are more worthy under that guidance?

26174,In my county (San Berardino) radio ads encourage heathy people to go get tested so we can reopen.
26175,I'm not at all against people who feel heathy getting tested--more testing the better--but the motivation to try and skew the numbers makes me queasy.
26176,We're still averaging more than 3000 new cases a day.
26177,"If you really want to control the virus, you have to have effective contact tracing, and I sincerely doubt we could handle even 500 new cases a day."
26178,"Germany, a country we should emulate, has twice the population of CA, and they are now way beyond capacity at 2000 cases a day."
26179,That is impossible because the pre-existing debt levels are too high for such major expenditures.
26180,"Those European countries (and America) fucked themselves by allowing their debts to balloon to inflexible levels, so they can't spend their way through a crisis anymore."
26181,Let’s all get sick and die!

26197,"&gt; If VN failed and had anywhere near the infected count of the USA, then the total death count would be nearly 1 million, not just 200k."
26198,Luckily it succeeded.
26199,Why do you say that?
26200,"No country has such rates, and younger countries like Vietnam have way lower death rates than older ones."
26201,"I mean if you go there and get into a coversation with a local about religion or something, you' could get the death sentence for blasphemy."

26273,It is very lucky for anyone to hold a job from home during this time.

26275,Early closures all around are starting to piss me off.
26276,I was getting off of work at 7pm at my last job and everything closed at 7 or 8.

26286,"""We're just praying that they'll all be OK.""

&gt;The moral of this chapter for the Grahams is that people should get tested for the virus at the slightest sign of symptoms, the couple said."
26287,"&gt;”My dad was skeptical of the test, because of all that information going around,"" Jessica said."
26288,"""And if he had just gone and got tested and was positive, we would have known right away to go into quarantine."

26290,Yea my bad I saw your post down further.

26292,yes.

26294,&gt;What about if the virus gets on their fur and you pet them after?
26295,That's usually what I get worried about when I take our doggos out to parks and pass by other people.
26296,"I would be worried about that too, especially dogs preoccupation with sniffing each others behinds."
26297,We know the virus is present in faeces so that would seem a pretty simple transmission vector.

26391,"""Penny wise pound foolish"" has always been the term that best described them."
26392,"Imagine anyone who's not a deranged, moronic, dumb ass."
26393,This is deadly rhetoric.
26394,"Between August of last year and March of 2020, both my infant, preschool-aged kid, my husband and I, were sick with colds, flu, ear infections and sinus infections."
26395,In February we got the flu type b(?)
26396,so freaking bad.
26397,"My two kids, husband and MIL got it real bad, along with intestinal issues."
26398,"I though I was spared, so I took care of them most of the morning we all woke up bad."
26399,At 1pm it hit me like a bag of bricks.
26400,The body aches and the fever spike knocked me out cold.
26401,I couldn’t even talk.
26402,I wanted to sleep and I couldn’t find a position in which my joints did not burn/hurt.
26403,Then we got the flu (type a?)
26404,"again in March 16, and that’s when the world stopped."
26405,"I thought we got coronavirus, and it was the flu again."
26406,Most likely brought by my infants day care.
26407,Since March we have not gotten sick.
26408,Because obviously people were hanging out with colds and flus and sending their sick children to school and daycares.
26409,"We’re all getting the flu shot again, because I swear if we had not gotten the shots last year, I cannot fathom how much worse we would’ve fared."

26413,"It's completely fair and accurate to say that we don't know if people who are currently dealing with the after effects of a covid infection will suffer for the rest of their lives, and I ***really*** hope you're right that the majority of long haulers recover within a year, but that doesn't seem very realistic."
26414,"Rather than comparing the recovery time from side effects of an unrelated medication to ""predict"" how long it will take these people to fully recover, it seems more appropriate to look at how people who have gone through other coronoavirus infections (like SARS) have fared."
26415,"Unfortunately, studies have shown that a significant percentage of people infected with SARS were still impacted by their side effects several years later."
26416,"There are quite a few articles that discuss this, but here's one in case you don't feel like searching: [https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-long-term-symptoms-sars-chronic-fatigue-2020-8](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-long-term-symptoms-sars-chronic-fatigue-2020-8)"

26435,"So simple a child could do it:

""The first experiment at this site was conducted by Rowbotham in the summer of 1838."
26436,"He waded into the river and used a telescope held 8 inches (20 cm) above the water to watch a boat, with a flag on its mast 3 feet (0.91 m) above the water, row slowly away from him."
26437,"[3] He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full 6 miles (9.7 km) to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical Earth, the top of the mast should have been about 11 feet (3.4 m) below his line of sight...""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Level_experiment#Experiments"
26438,"All the PPE and tests that were confiscated were ""privately distributed to where the nation needed them most""."
26439,Which means they were sold dirt cheap to private companies that are friendly with or indirectly owned by the Trump administration... so that they could turn and sell them to the highest bidder and pocket a profit.
26440,Because clearly the highest bidders are the ones who needed them most!
26441,reddit phds told me it was just a flu

26448,Bet you wouldn’t tell Trump that.
26449,the ones in the movies I'd say
26450,Literally.
26451,In my fairly rural part of California I've seen a much greater adoption of the mask and distancing rules in the last few months.
26452,I feel like people used to either balk at wearing the mask or didn't take it seriously.
26453,"But not that we've got outside dining and most of the stuff they used to enjoy is more accessible now in a way that is close enough to how it was before, everyone is doing what they're supposed to do."

26461,"And yet, Sweden doing worse than other Scandanevian countries."

26463,"With an incubation period up to 2 weeks, we have only seen half of the Rose Garden cases."
26464,The median is 6 days after exposure.
26465,"At the 6th day (October 2nd), only half of the infected show symptoms."
26466,There could be 20 cases by October 10th.
26467,They will spread it to people that were not at the event.
26468,There could be another another 20-40 announcements.
26469,"The vast majority of us are not gleeful, but you saw that headline a few days ago about the man who spent years working against workers seeking compensation for black lung actually coming down with it himself?"
26470,We feel like most people do reading that headline.
26471,"Like on a human level I feel bad for that guy and his family and don't want anyone to suffer like that, BUT BUT BUT at the same time it's like the biggest karma slap ever."
26472,"It's just so absurd, like you wouldn't have wished black lung on that guy but at the same time you're like ""Buddy, I don't know what to say when 200,000 people died and you still fostered an environment where it was basically taboo for someone like Hope Hicks to wear a mask on your damn plane""."
26473,I think a lot of it is more like nervous laughter than people actually deep down wishing for his death or anything so dark
26474,One of the few things Trump got right.
26475,In the US.

26714,"But mostly I replied to your stupid comment about Sweden, when you know nothing about the situation here."
26715,"Or if you just have faith, god will keep you safe... pffffttttt"
26716,That's not what reactionary means.
26717,It means reacting against the forces of social and economic liberalization.
26718,"That used to mean wanting the king on the throne and people in church, but they've just shifted the goalpost so now it's billionaires in mansions and... People in church."
26719,"No wonder he got covid, he got it in a box"
26720,What is the death rate and hospital admittance rate?
26721,I can't seem to see anything on these stats.
26722,A rising infection rate - particularly if it is in the student demographic - isn't an issue if they're predominately asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.
26723,"Issue is more a mental one, where students are forced to isolate for 14 days."
26724,But the plus is they'll all be good to go for Christmas.
26725,Why does Trump deserve respect?
26726,No ... it's the parents who are suicidal.
26727,I guess the *former* CDC was hungry for some airtime
26728,I'm trying to imagine it and I'm getting nothing.
26729,what's your point?
26730,"don't ask me that, I'm no scientist"
26731,"Define ""pointless"""
26732,Deforestation pushes rurals and live animal markets into major cities where diseases jumping over the blood barrier are more likely to occur and much more easily spread.
26733,We’re not even talking about climate change - though your dead wrong about that too.
26734,I would set up a desk area so I can actually sit and do work and have a designated area for it.
26735,Jesus Christ.
26736,Then they better damn well pass a bill to pay back rent if they are going to force us to “bunker down”.
26737,Really!!
26738,How about a thank you to the doctors who practice “science”.
26739,I guess he know who is people are..
26740,This makes absolutely no sense.
26741,"Like oh yea, the kids will only spread it it on monday and tuesday, so wednesday-friday we should be good to go."
26742,"&gt; I'm sure the word ""incubation"" is too big for them to understand so explaining that would be pointless."
26743,Is there a good timeline diagram of how a typical infection progresses?
26744,"Something like this but with pretty graphs:

- Day 0 - You catch the virus from a friend or family member or at a store
- Day whatever - You become contagious and start spreading the virus to others
- Day whatever - Mild symptoms start, fever, cough, etc."
26745,"- Day whatever - Major symptoms like shortness of breath, dizzyness, low O2 sat
- Day whatever - Last day for 50% survival without medical intervention

Since we only get news on ""Day whatever"" it would make it easier to understand if there was a good infographic"
26746,Or any single one of the Democratic candidates.
26747,I'm agnostic so like -20 probably if zero is neutral
26748,So your link isn't a proof of immunity?

26754,Humans exhibit logical fallacies whether religious or not.
26755,I'm not them but I do not enjoy living my life with some sort of spiritual component.
26756,I would be burned the fuck off.
26757,"&gt;your belief in a god is surely impacting other beliefs you have, and so those beliefs are not well supported

That's not how that works 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
26758,"You can believe whatever you want, but in reality, there is absolutely no reason to believe that there is a creator."
26759,I don't get it either but my guess it someone how has to do with money.
26760,"Either with them production and seeking of the masks or he's afraid of what it will do to the stock market, his prized baby."
26761,Depends on how much God you believe in.
26762,"I mean, based on a recent conversation with someone who’s not as religious as the rest of their family, I think my understanding is it’s about trusting god."
26763,She was saying they can’t talk about basic medical stuff when her mom was in the hospital because that means they aren’t trusting god.
26764,"So I’m guessing masks are similar, they believe that their lives are in gods hands and don’t need to follow precautions."
26765,It's not really that shocking that they'd be using them in the incorrect manner that way.
26766,"This administration, and seems that the white house in general, are so idiotic and out of touch with the real world that of course they'd be that stupid."
26767,"I know we've been the laughing stock of the world to other countries for some time, but damn, these guys aren't helping make that any better."
26768,"Write a book, play an instrument, get a hobby, play online poker ...

NO wait ... Don't play online poker!"
26769,Prone to hyperbole are we?
26770,This is why you’re all dying.
26771,In case you wondered at all.
26772,"People outside who have been locked down and living with limited freedoms for almost a year look at this shit and while at first there may have been some sympathy, that ship has sailed."
26773,I do feel bad for those who are actually trying to act right.
26774,It must suck to be surrounded by assholes.
26775,"He told this a month ago, why is it posted now..?"
26776,But the treatment in an status where he is ok could cause more harm then good.
26777,So it could be a Indicator that it is not really ok.
26778,Actually anti-left is their platform now.
26779,Take health care - it's not like they have their own plan that they are pushing - they are trying to repeal for the sake of repealing.
26780,"The ""replace"" part is not their selling point."
26781,"I can't remember where I heard it, but they are now devoid of any scholarship (you could argue Milt Friedman was in the old days, but modern day conservatives don't have any)."
26782,"So they can only oppose, not propose."
26783,"&gt;Living in a smaller city in the Netherlands Wednesday during groceries, only 5-10% of the people were wearing masks Yesterday during groceries around 20% of the people were wearing masks

It was the same in my go-to grocery store up until a few days ago."
26784,"I could count the people wearing a mask on my fingers, but it seems to be improving now."
26785,"I was doing my groceries one day after they started recommended masks, and to my happy surprise nearly everyone I saw was wearing a mask."
26786,"I'm really hoping that this kills some of the stigma around wearing masks, because frankly not wanting to wear a mask is an incredibly dumb hill to die on."
26787,"Now, if only people would stop passing dangerously close behind my back because I'm holding them up for five seconds by grabbing something from a shelf..."
26788,"There's a lifestyle thing with the first two years in particular, where you are obligated to study general topics unrelated to a specific major, some institutions require students live on campus first 2 years, etc."
26789,"There is a huge dropout rate from 1st and 2nd year students, as this lifestyle is generally new to them, they are on their own for the first time, have no skills developed to deal with increased personal responsibility."
26790,"So, the party and sport aspect is very visible, but by 3rd and 4th year, if you don't have yourself in check, you are probably not doing so well."
26791,"Also, consider that much of your impression is likely from movies/tv, and diligent students who have a healthy academic and social balance, don't really make it to the screen."
26792,I believe these videos were pre recorded.
26793,That man took the completely worthless drug hydroxy chloroquin.
26794,I bet he is bugging and threatening everyone around him like a crazy child to give him what ever he picked up on breitbart and fox news no matter what the doctors say.
26795,I'm helping kids in my family with all their lessons.
26796,"If I wasn't here I'm not sure they could continue because they need someone to teach them, someone to print / get materials, someone tech savvy, and someone with all the above but with time."
26797,We also have two computers so one for each child and stable high speed internet.
26798,"There are a lot of families where even if they could technically do it, they'd be lacking elements to make it truly 'work' (able to get good grades, absorb material, access material)

I don't think the solution is kids going back to school."
26799,"In my opinion if you can't make virtual school work right now, let kids have a gap year."
26800,I know it's not a great thing but it's better than risking kids and the surrounding people's lives and health.
26801,So tldr there's a lot of reasons parents and guardians are sending kids back to school which I empathize with but it's not a good idea.
26802,"Well, that's all consistent with a near-death experience, rather than Covid specifically."
26803,"Going through stuff like this changes people, almost always for the better."
26804,"His account has had only a couple of personal comments, the rest are retweets."
26805,There is a link upthread comparing his twitter activity - I think it is below 20% of normal.
26806,"The left sees certain societal and community matters as problems that need solved — there’s a pandemic and to *make life better for everyone*, we should all wear masks."
26807,"The right sees societal and community matters as a matter of fact, but don’t see them as problems that need solved."
26808,"Yes, people will get sick."
26809,"Yes, people will die."
26810,"That’s tough shit for them, that’s life."
26811,"These perspectives also apply to things like racial justice, gender pay gap, LGBTQ+ rights, etc."
26812,Edit to add: this is why it’s difficult to debate the other side because their entire worldview is so disparate it’s tough for people to concede anything.
26813,Not at all!

26819,"Fun fact until 1914 mussolini was a member of the Italian socialist party, after having been kicked from the party for his support of ww1 he changed his views later creating his fascist party."
26820,So i get what you're saying (fascist are socialist according to some) but they could be correct just not for the years they are thinking of.
26821,"To be clear, the doctor (not trump’s doctor) said he could be discharged *as early as tomorrow* into the care of the WH medical team."
26822,"That doesn’t mean a discharge **will** happen tomorrow, just that it could."
26823,I think their narrative is biden is old and senile and he will surround himself with more progressive people (to them socialists) who will be using him as a puppet.
26824,And I hope that honestly is what happens.
26825,We need more progressive politics
26826,Don’t worry about that.

26830,"I know it's not exactly science, they just have a lot of archaic beliefs."
26831,Oh I’m sorry didn’t know worrying about my kids education was so triggering.

26852,"&gt;Some businesses rely on being open otherwise they collapse

Right, so start wearing masks and following social distancing whenever possible."
26853,It's not hard and I just don't get why people can't do something so simple.

26868,"So, New York City has set up a bunch of ""COVID Express"" test sites that are RT-PCR tests."
26869,I took this last week with my 5-year-old for her to start in-person school.
26870,"We were processed in 10 minutes in the health department office, and got the results about 4 hours later."
26871,"The test is faster than say, going to the Urgent Care clinic on the corner, because the results are from a purpose built lab in NYC that just processes COVID tests from these sites."
26872,"So, it's possible to do a type of PCR test in well under a day, for re-entry to school purposes (since the city generally has low positivity rates, except in certain neighborhoods)."
26873,"From a workplace safety point of view, waiting 4 hours for a test result basically blows out your working day for ad hoc visitors."
26874,"You can get regular staffers to and scheduled visitors do the PCR beforehand, but they may have gone for this rapid antigen test because, hey, 15 minutes, and you can get out of the holding room and into the cocktail reception."
26875,Never mind that wasn't the right way to use the test.

26883,"I think the biggest twist would be if he gets voted out, loses access to presidential quality care, and gets re-infected in the spring after failing to take precautions because he's convinced himself he's ""immune""..."
26884,"I'm guessing it will take 6 more months from this point in time of debating whether or not herd immunity is achievable by natural infection and then something like that finally happens and ends the ""debate""."
26885,I am glad there is at least one redditor who can be objective about this!
26886,I agree we need to prevent this from occurring again.
26887,I know people who think China let it happen and people who think the US sneaked the virus in China and released it there.

26899,Do it like they do it in the Middle East ... get a bidet and wash your butt ... your butthole will thank you :).
26900,"Why does the public need to know in excruciating detail, every aspect of Trump’s treatment?"
26901,We’re all individuals whose bodies may display different symptoms and respond differently to treatment.
26902,The minutia should be between Trump and his doctors.
26903,"The demand, 24 hour coverage, and pointless talking heads on the matter is mind numbing."

26934,"&gt;Knowing whether you have Covid-19 is much more complicated because there are so many different — and sometimes pretty wacky — symptoms, many of which echo those of the flu."
26935,"&gt;The most common symptoms are high fever, sometimes with chills, a dry cough and fatigue."
26936,"&gt;The one sign that really distinguishes the two infections is that many Covid-19 victims suddenly lose their sense of smell — not because they have a stuffy nose, but because they don’t register even strong odors like onions or coffee."
26937,"Not all virus victims get anosmia, the formal name for loss of smell, but one study found that 87 percent did."
26938,"&gt;Less common symptoms include a sore throat, congestion, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain and feeling somewhat out of breath when exerting yourself."
26939,"Some victims have red or itchy eyes, and some get redness or blisters on their fingers or toes — so-called Covid toes, which resemble chilblains."
26940,More dangerous symptoms — which mean you should get immediate medical attention — include serious breathing difficulty; pain or pressure in the chest; blue lips or blue face; confusion or incoherent answers to simple questions; and collapsing or losing consciousness.

26944,I'm not a scientist but really how hard would it be to develop one.
26945,I suspect the pharma comps don't want to because they enjoy selling their fuking PCR tests for $100 plus.

I understand that the point of such sobering statements as these is to discourage people from prematurely reverting to pre-pandemic lifestyles at the cost of the safety of others, but don't you think wording them like this might actually be counterproductive?"
27082,"Like, I am aware that this has never been an explicit policy anywhere, but I think a *lot* of people are in this mindset of ""sacrifice normalcy now so that we can safely return to normal later""; that is, they are treating old normal as some sort of ""reward"" for patience and obedience when the vaccine arrives, and lockdowns and closures are no longer necessary."
27083,"To this end, if the interference to everyone's daily life ends up persisting beyond a vaccine, or ""permanently"", people are going to lose hope, and wonder something along the lines of ""if we really can't return to normal like these experts are saying, then what *is* the point of these guidelines?"""
27084,"And many of them, I can guarantee this, will forego the restrictions altogether, therefore causing the ""no return to old normal"" statements to have the exact opposite effect on compliance."
27085,"That being said, I wonder if these sort of statements have any historical basis in previous pandemics, or really in any catastrophe in history, be it war, natural disaster, or famine."

27171,Bars and restaurants have to close at 22:00.

27330,BURIED HEADLINE: 26 states covid cases remain flat
27331,This is spot on.
27332,It’s the whole everyone’s on their own mentality.
27333,"If I get the virus, I get the virus, and I’m strong, I’ll be okay."
27334,"If you get it because of my actions and die, well that’s unfortunate, but certainly not my fault/is the will of God."
27335,"Don't act like ""leftists"" don't do the same thing."
27336,It is a stupid game they play.
27337,I’m not going to question the decisions of a team of doctors with years of experience.
27338,"Unless you are a doctor, then it’s best for us just to trust those who know what they are doing."
27339,Thanks for the link!
27340,I’ll read up.
27341,Looks like I was wrong.
27342,We need to make a solid law as a baselines that governs outdoor activity during the pandemic.
27343,Clearly specify what is allowed and what not.
27344,Then the police can enforce those guidelines.
27345,Quarantine breakers need to be punished severely.
27346,They are no better than drunken drivers speeding through the city.
27347,Every second they spend outside is a massive risk to those around them.
27348,Otherwise we never get a handle on this situation.
27349,"Well, that and ramming sycophant judges through at an unprecedented rate."
27350,I probably don't have that luxury.
27351,"I'm overweight (but at the pace I'm hoping to lose weight, I shouldn't be obese by Spring), but I'm living with parents (so we can isolate together, my rent money helps them out more than it would some random landlord), who both have a litany of comorbidities."
27352,"It'll be a tough decision when I get fit, I either leave my parents house and move on my own (leaving my financially struggling parents on their own, knowing that if I leave, there's a chance they catch the virus and I never see them again), or give up potentially another whole year of my life in my mid-20's, that I should be using to have memorable experiences and establish my adult social circle."
27353,"I say now that I'd stay home, but knows what 6 more months of isolation will do to me."
27354,"Probably goes without saying but: if you feel like you have been hit by a truck, stay home."
27355,"Otherwise, you will be all kinds of miserable."
27356,I think a lot of it stems from earlier on during the crisis when there were calls for lockdowns and masks in public.
27357,The two became associated and the general thought was if I have to wear a mask that means i should be on lockdown and therefore all of the businesses should also be shut down.
27358,Effectively the association became masks = stop the economy even though there's a lot of steps between the two.
27359,It's now effectively evolved into an us vs them thing with them being democrats.
27360,The point is the Whitehouse was relying on these rapid tests to protect them so they could avoid wearing masks (because vanity).
27361,"Obviously that was a flawed strategy, and a misuse of the purpose of this kind of test."
27362,"No, not really."
27363,Each and every test has a 7% false negative rate.
27364,"It’s not like that once the first one hit that failure, then the second one gets a free ride to work correctly."
27365,That’s just not how that works.
27366,It will be normal enough that one should not treat 4-5 negatives in a row as meaning that one definitely does not have Covid.
27367,That's not what that will actually mean.
27368,Kemp right?

27389,Is Trump’s doctor allowed to share everything or is he only sharing what Trump has consented to?

27420,What?
27421,"Look, we have direct evidence of house parties, weddings being places of transmission and death."
27422,This is beginning to feel like you are merely conclusion shopping responses.
27423,Part of the reason for that is that the far left isn't as numerous and popular as they like to think they are.
27424,"They incorrectly believe that Biden is as bad as Trump, and that anyone right of Bernie or AOC is a Nazi fascist."
27425,"Meanwhile, the politics of most voters on the left likely fall on the spectrum somewhere between Bernie and Biden, and those voters are fine with any candidate that the Democrats would put forward, but the far left continues to label them ""dirty conservative centrists."""

27659,Were you able to use medicare for meds?

27664,Well I did say minimum.
27665,I think it’s actually closer to two years.
27666,I read an article in the WaPo yesterday going over all the different vaccines that are in development atm.
27667,It broke down how they work (different projects are developing vaccines with different methods of action.
27668,"), how far along they are and most importantly it compared how quickly effective vaccines for previous widespread infections were developed."
27669,"After looking through it I have to say that I’d be surprised if we’re back to pre-2019 socializing within a year and a half; keeping in mind how long it would take to develop an effective vaccine, how long it takes to be effectively distributed **and** how long it takes to achieve a herd immunity in all the populations."

27671,"I'm sure any equipment and personal they need will be at the white house now, they've probably been moving things in while Trump was in the hospital"
27672,I think they oppose masks because they believe the virus is not as bad as the media and most of the world says it is.
27673,They believe the virus is only taking out people that are weak and near death anyways.
27674,"So if they wear masks, they see that as legitimizing the virus and the ""irrational"" fear."

27703,"A belief system tends to harbor not just its main political views (which is a collection of cohesive ideas that kind of resonate and are consistent with one another) but also a wide variety of arbitrary beliefs that are completely incoherent to the rest of the system, but were started by a strong impulse, say a popular church leader said something and it started a reinforcement loop and to this day, they spit before they enter the church, because God wanted whatever."
27704,Think about it like gravity.
27705,"Once the main body of mass, say Earth, forms, it has a gravitational pull, so it starts attracting all garbage possible from space, and it sticks to it through gravity."
27706,Same with masks.
27707,"The initial reaction by GOP was to call the pandemic a hoax, and Trump didn't like masks, and the CDC warned people not to use masks."
27708,"Even if they turn around now, like the CDC did, the initial impulse was created and it started a reinforcement loop, where GOP voters communicate between themselves, finding more and more reasons why masks suck."
27709,"""If you wear a mask, like, Clinton wins, because did you know that most masks are made by children in her pedo ring, or something""."
27710,"I'm half kidding, but that's literally what's happening in our society."

27714,Is it rational?
27715,Absolutely fucking not.
27716,It's one of the cases of where our privacy laws go too far.
27717,"The laws are great and protective under normal circumstances, but in a public health emergency it prevents protection..."
27718,"It means we can't have an app like Taiwan does to notify you of positive cases near you (these opt-in things we have here really aren't going to be as helpful)

27731,To be fair they should be doing both.
27732,"The president should be wearing an n95 masks when possible, and they should be testing everyone around him like crazy."

27736,How so?
27737,What am I failing to understand?
27738,I wonder if this experiment will change the way this medicine is used?
27739,Yeah and the percentage positive is still fairly low even with these spikes in cases at 2-3.5%
27740,in the last day or so Clinton Hill and others have gone up too.
27741,but unless it keeps going up it could be explained by coming in contact with infected people.
27742,it's possible the outdoor dining is partly responsible.
27743,cases have been rising slightly since august and some restaurants have been building walls and whatever for their areas.
27744,"at least in forest hills

if all those people could get it in the rose garden sitting outside, I don't see why people sitting outside with a wall on the street side that blocks the air movement won't help in transmitting COVID"

I have to travel from the Netherlands to Poland in a few weeks from now, and I'm tempted to take the train (approx 13-14 hrs), mainly because it seems like a bit of an adventure, also to try and reduce my carbon footprint and because it's cheaper (though these two are less significant factors)."
27859,"However, I'm concerned about the risk of infection on a train."
27860,"While I've read that one study found the chance of infection for a journey is less than 1/11000, that's for just an hour's journey."
27861,Another study suggested that even 2.5 m distance is not enough for over 2 hours.
27862,"So I'm not sure if I should take the train, which I'd like to, but seems less safe than a plane (even if the plane is more crowded, it has much better air filtration and also the flight is only 2 hours)."

27937,Other than the fact that it would mentally scar the other part of the population and overload hospitals.
27938,"For the planet, how bad would it really be if 1-2 Billion would die?"
27939,"If there will be no vaccine (not unlikely) and we will not be successful in containing the virus (likely), these are the numbers."
27940,It might even be higher.
27941,"A seemingly large percentage of those who had COVID, remain ill for much longer."
27942,It could be that this group has a lower life expectancy.
27943,"Unfortunately, we cannot be certain about this due to the novelty of the virus."
27944,"As a homebody, other than losing my job and lots of people dying, the pandemic has been pretty ok for me personally."
27945,I've got no issues hunkering down for another six months.
27946,Plenty where I live.
27947,"I'm not telling where, more for me!"
27948,"I remember over the last few months how there were a bunch of Europeans on reddit going ""Everything is back to normal here because we did *such a good job* locking down."
27949,"You dumb Americans could've had this too if you were smart like us""."
27950,"Part of me wanted to tell them that isn't how this works, but I also really wanted them to be right so I think I usually refrained."
27951,"Also because any pushback against the ""Europeans are smart, Americans are dumb"" meme usually brings more trouble than it's worth."
27952,Im in Toronto and have a lot less cases overall obv.
27953,That was only the first round and there is going to be another two more than likely.
27954,"The fact that a good chunk of Rep members are getting it now may shift their opinion on this virus, or hopefully cause the Dems to come into power and make the right madate's."
27955,"After all that though you have a shit load of people permanently unemployed from this,  survivors with long term health difficulties and a lot of businesses that realize they won't need offices since people can work from home."
27956,"Hotels, airlines, restaraunts, night clubs, taxi drivers, event spacea, convention centres, concert venues, movie studios, cruise ships, etc..... all are seeing substantial forever business changing actions reguardkess if you can still go to the gym and have a beer on the patio."
27957,This is huge and we haven't seen the full shot of the virus yet let alone the ramifications.
27958,"Idk if we are just starting, I mean we can definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel for a vaccine, which will largely signify the end of Covid once everyone in a certain country has access to getting the vaccine."
27959,Doesn't explain the debate-prep outbreak.
27960,Doesn't remdesivir and the experimental therapy only supposed to be significantly helpful if it is within like 2 days of contracting.. or maybe it is having symptoms.
27961,"Basically if he recovers, it may not be because of the medication but he sure would act like it is"
27962,This.
27963,"Or encouraging people to not pay rent, because in their childish minds all landlords are moustache-twirling oligarchs swimming in pools of cash."
27964,"Or cheering on rioting and destroying businesses that have taken years or decades to build: ""it's only money!"""
27965,What about cats to humans?
27966,Now make Whitmer release nursing home data.
27967,Oh yea she wont because she knows she royally fucked up.
27968,"Listen, I’m stocking up on TP now if the rest of you are going to act like idiots this time around...."
27969,"Since the infections at the Rose Garden ceremony and the debate prep surfaced at the same time, my guess is someone who was at both events."
27970,"So in a simpler term, we're fucked..."
27971,Zoom has mute!
27972,[removed]
27973,Thinking that would change the situation is cute.
27974,"You need to change behavior, not just do the same things but wear a mask and think it is safe."
27975,&gt; Let’s clarify this before everyone starts to panic.
27976,This is the largest number of CONFIRMED positive cases in one day...
27977,The death rate has NOT had a significant uptick and yes I know there is a delay.
27978,"“When you test, you have a case."
27979,"When you test, you find something is wrong with people."
27980,"If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases."""
27981,This is why I wear one even when my office is empty.
27982,"For security reasons, it makes sense that historically, presidents are not transparent when they're ill or undergoing surgeries."
27983,"For that reason, I don't trust news from the white house and I expect medical staff to keep details confidential."
27984,"But y'know, there's irony here with the trumpist cult."
27985,"By being pro-choice (body autonomy - my body my choice, no mask), it's gonna cost them their anti-choice supreme court pick."
27986,Hey we have those here in jersey and Brooklyn too!
27987,And yeahhhh.....you’re 100% right speaking from firsthand experience
27988,No.
27989,This week has been crazy.
27990,I'm going crazy.
27991,I feel like a literal fiance is an exception to social distancing guidelines.
27992,"At the very least, you can meet up outside with face masks on."
27993,&gt;	Can anyone explain why they seem to hate masks so much?
27994,Is it a sign of weakness?
27995,I am not american but Republicans in general seem to have a compulsion to take the opposite position of anything coming from a “leftist”.
27996,"Most of the Symptoms are the same, so unless you have a loss of smell, or taste, you probably wont know if you have the flu or Covid."
27997,But doing that doesn’t “own the socialist libtards”.
27998,Which is the obvious priority......
27999,My whole office has been working from home since March and it's been working out very well for us.
28000,"As a wise man once said : ""Oh just shut up man""

what this guys is saying is complete bullshit."
28001,People wear masks and r/france is really pro mask.
28002,I bet giving people masks would help too.
28003,Thanks for the info 👍

28005,[removed]
28006,"They found the most expensive and least effective way of ""keeping safe"" when they could have distanced, worked from home or wore masks for nearly no cost."
28007,People are stocking up again because they’re afraid there is going to be a second lockdown.
28008,"Even if there is, it doesn’t make any sense to hoard and it actually damages industries and leaves a lot of people without resources."
28009,"It’s kind of ironic that hoarding and doomsday prepping actually displays the same individualistic attitudes that so many are shitting on other people for, for going out and about living their lives right now."
28010,"Quite similar, yes."

28019,Okay question/rant.
28020,My roommate tested positive for COVID on Friday.
28021,"I got tested yesterday, on Saturday."
28022,"It’s Sunday now and I’ve been sleeping all day, now I have a super upset stomach which is sort of normal for me but the sleeping all day isnt."
28023,I also have a bad headache but that might be because I’ve been sleeping all day.
28024,I’ve also had an off and on sore throat for a week and a half or so but nothing serious.
28025,I know it doesn’t always take long to show up after exposure but now I’m nervous it’ll come back negative but what if I’m actually positive?
28026,I work in child care and they want me to come back once I get the negative result.

28030,[removed]
28031,Fevers are not a very consistent symptom.
28032,Just get tested.
28033,[removed]
28034,No there are various types of swab tests.
28035,Some are the brain poke some are different.
28036,The double nasal swab one I got was administered the way it’s supposed to go.
28037,It goes up the nose to the point where you can feel it going just past the point that you would ever think of putting a qtip in.
28038,There are valid tests that aren’t the brain poke option.
28039,That one was developed early on.
28040,No lol.
28041,"It's pretty simple: the doctors are saying contradictory things, because the patient has told them to say contradictory things."
28042,And they are trying to preserve his confidentiality.
28043,"Conley has been given permission to say that a steroid has been administered, and he's probably been given an order to also say that Trump will be going home tomorrow."
28044,"Trump is either entering the inflammation phase of COVID-19, soon, and was administered a steroid to help stave off inflammation, and he is definitely not going home tomorrow."
28045,Or he's going home tomorrow.
28046,Both cannot be true at the same time.
28047,Trump doesn't realize how contradictory those two orders are.
28048,"Conley does, but, Conley is bound by his oath to try to honor the patient's wishes regarding the status of his treatment."
28049,The doctors are in a rough position.
28050,Doing better _today_
28051,If you go by states our record is even better.
28052,Living in Perth is the same as living in Perth 2 years ago.
28053,"No social distancing, no masks, no cases."
28054,I feel better off here than in Auckland NZ where half my family lives and lockdowns and strict measures are constantly put in place.
28055,Your point being?
28056,A lil 3rd world country doing better than your first world country
28057,And filtered.
28058,Blood pressure spared.
28059,That is extraordinarily unhealthy physically and mentally (particularly going 95 days without leaving the house).
28060,We have been hunkered down since March as well... but that includes walks 3-4x a week and frequent bike rides for me.
28061,You can leave the house and go outside without risk of contracting COVID.
28062,If you’re extra concerned walk in less populated places early in the morning.
28063,Umm yea even in a high profile business building a guy joked about how people were wearing their masks at their desks.
28064,Meanwhile they turned the corner and saw me with my mask on and gloves working in a hallway on laptops.
28065,Not taking it off until I get into my car and drive away.
28066,"Doesn’t want market to tank tomorrow, desperation."
28067,It's always been my assumption that Donald Trump didn't want to wear one because the masks fucked up his comb over and smeared his makeup.
28068,So he and his Ministry of Propaganda started spreading misinformation about masks and Cult 45 took it and ran.
28069,I truly believe there are 200k+ dead in the United States because Trump didn't want to have a bad hair day.
28070,[removed]
28071,I don’t get it either.
28072,"I like getting to hide behind it, myself."
28073,Sometimes it can suck if it’s hot but even then it’s not that big of a deal.
28074,"I'm not sure where you live, but here in MA, the change in weather is absolutely significant."
28075,"It's sweatshirt weather still right now, but if people are making stupid decision now while they can still go outside, what will happen when they can't any more?"
28076,"And yes, our governors, collectively, Democrats as well as cowboy Republicans in the South, have been a bunch of fuckwits about schools."
28077,"They figured it would be easy - send kids back, parents go back to work, economy solved."
28078,"Unfortunately, we had no data about kids because, you know, we completely removed them from the covid equation for about 6 months."
28079,"They all mistakenly used the lack of data to mean that it would be safe, and we are seeing that it clearly wasn't."
28080,The response to this pandemic has been a complete disaster in the USA.
28081,It would help if we had a President who gave a shit at all.
28082,I’m shocked!!
28083,Shocked I tell ya!

28085,"I'll file this under ""No shit"" as well as ""Things my agency's leadership will continue to ignore until someone loses a lung, after which they will post more signs that no one reads."""
28086,imagine bragging about being the 15th best public university lmao
28087,"Keep in mind he is getting multiple well established AND also experimental treatments, the alternative is rosy reporting."
28088,If Trump survives will his temper get worse (eg.
28089,post Covid brain damage)?
28090,Have there been any studies?
28091,"Similarly, does impulse control decline?"
28092,Does aggression increase?
28093,The POTUS may take his Covid-related fears and anger out on an obvious target.
28094,"I am concerned because the time required to activate the nuclear football and execute launch commands, while classified, is remarkably short."
28095,I’m asking you to substantiate your point with facts and science and you respond like that?
28096,"You see, I wonder where your opinions and information comes from, have you come to this information yourself through your own reading or has it been fed to you, or worse, have you simply gone along with the group think narrative, while actually knowing very little."
28097,"For me it’s important to respectfully question everything you’re told, sometimes there are other motives at play, all I’ve had from you is down talking, condescension and dismissal and yet you still seem to take a moral high ground."
28098,"All the same though, I’m still genuinely interested to hear why you think the virus is “raging”?"
28099,A terrorist organization that the US essentially trained and created in the 80's because communism bad.
28100,We should use swabs on the republican politicians’ lungs.
28101,"More able bodies for the revolution, yes"
28102, this must be due to the region.
28103,In some cases the large metropolitan cities like Marseille and Paris.
28104,Not Sure of this was caused by Ligue 1 house parties.

28154,Murderers.

28162,"I take it that you have not been tested, as you say your symptoms have been passed off as allergies?"
28163,"Thank you for the well wishes, I hope that you can get to the bottom of your symptoms and feel better soon as well."
28164,Great.
28165,I'm already sad and isolated.
28166,Winter will just be even better whoo hoo
28167,It does though.
28168,"I mean if we can’t completely lock down for months at a time, tests can help."
28169,If you require weekly (or daily) tests for schools or before flying you can potentially catch let’s say 50% of active cases that may not show symptoms and require them to isolate for 2 weeks.
28170,And potentially isolate their immediate contacts.
28171,We should still be wearing masks and social distancing with negative tests but now we have potentially reduced exposure even more without completely shutting down.
28172,"No matter who wins in November, we're going to lose."
28173,"While voter apathy is definitely a major symptom, a lot of the imbalance between power and actual numbers on the Republican side is the sheer amount of money the uber-wealthy and the corporate interests pump into their side."
28174,"Until we stop equating money with “free-speech” (which is such an oxymoron when you think about it), we’re never going to get rid of the out-sized influence of the oligarchs."
28175,A lot of voter apathy can be equated to just how hard it is to get anything done on the progressive side when the lobbyists and wealthy donors just have to write checks to get their agenda going.
28176,"I only got through 3 top level before they were already contradicting themselves, ffs"
28177,It actually might be one of the few things that would work.
28178,"Conventional containment like testing, tracing, and isolating won’t work, because the virus is too widespread."
28179,"Locking down would actually be one of the only tools that would universally lower transmission rates enough, to allow for those other tools to work."
28180,It’s political and stupidity.
28181,That’s basically it.
28182,There’s no further explanation.
28183,"&gt;After the science is done, and the knowledge is known to a few people, the  communication and education begins, to teach everyone else."
28184,In parallel the efforts by those with a competing interest start a disinformation campaign to discredit the known material on social media.
28185,Allowing greater profit or political advantage for a period of time.
28186,The athletes have access to resources the regular student population does not.
28187,"They have a great education available if they want to take advantage of it, but of course a lot of them are there for the slim chance of a future NFL career instead."
28188,"The smartest thing for any of them to do is to finish their 4th year, get a real degree (and not just sports management), and *then* consider moving on to professional sports."
28189,"Heck, a lot of the guys on the team who had an extra year of eligibility go on to a master's degree program."
28190,I think republicans in general want less government control over their lives.
28191,They see masks as a complete stripping of personal freedoms.
28192,"At the same time, they tear pro choice women apart and protest abortion clinics."
28193,Fucking hypocrites.

28200,Ha.
28201,Remember Fauci said back in March that Americans would need to 'hunker down' for 14 days to flatten the curve?
28202,I'm cautiously optimistic that people will return to normal life without receiving permission from Dr. Fauci.
28203,Especially ironic given they wanted to “slow down the testing!”
28204,"I think one of the things that drives the older generation towards conservatism is that anytime you give the government extra power or the likes for something down the road it ends up abusing it and not giving it up, so it's easier just to oppose anything seen as expansion of government power even if at the time it is reasonable."
28205,Not good.
28206,Are the bars still open?
28207,Well most of the borders are difficult to cross in the wild due to the terrain and they have enough police force that if they want they can easily control areas nearby.
28208,"Chinese are probably not really drawn into immigrating illegally to Vietnam anyhow, so this leaves only Laos and Cambodia borders to keep."
28209,"And both Khmers and Laotians will be easily spotted, so I can imagine that Vietnam can feasibly ""become island' during covid"
28210,We're all gonna be expert imposters by the time the vaccine comes
28211,Insightful comet.
28212,"A three paragraph article from Slate's Daniel Politi (who puts out an average of 5 Trump ""articles"" per day, every single day) seems like a good source for this serious sub."
28213,"&gt; the test is known to deliver incorrect results

yes, every test can do that

&gt; tests discover the presence of coronavirus once there’s enough viral material in a person to be able to detect it

no shit."
28214,Yet rapid tests are still used on everyone worldwide.
28215,Guess the whole world is completely misusing it.
28216,Yeah right.
28217,McCain was MIC stooge who hated that Trump got elected.
28218,There is no lack of funding due to the tax cut.
28219,Theres plenty of money.
28220,Only problem is Dems want to use it to bail out failed Dem cities.
28221,What does Chicago's pension failure have to do with Covid?
28222,I just read they're hoping to discharge him Monday (*tomorrow*)?
28223,WTF.
28224,And so what if we weren't and 400k people ended up being dead.
28225,You do realize the 200K argument is all hindsight.
28226,So they can play up the notion of fighting for your rights.
28227,There whole mantra is about what people want to take from you and them being the only ones who can protect you.
28228,Dems want your guns.
28229,Immigrants want your jobs.
28230,Antifa wants to burn down your business.
28231,Democratic governors want to lock everyone away in there homes.
28232,GOP whole mantra is too instill fear over people coming to take things away.
28233,This is spot on.
28234,"Nothing shows the failure of the Republican party as a governing organization than when they had control of the House, Senate, and Executive branch and literally couldn't get anything accomplished."
28235,"Mishandled*

Sorry, while I agree with what you're trying to say - I think you're giving them way too much credit"
28236,I like this phrase
28237,Can I ask a question.
28238,What do you suggest parents like me do whose kids are doing worse in school now?
28239,Like a very sharp decline.
28240,"Also, they haven’t seen their friends since March, what do we tell them?"
28241,How do we keep explaining this?
28242,How far do you let your children slip before you put them before the greater good?
28243,I am genuinely asking.
28244,We are sending ours back.
28245,We are still agonizing over this.
28246,If we do virtual my teacher friends tell me the kids will suffer because they can’t focus on their face to face students and virtual students at the same time.
28247,They will try but they can’t.
28248,So do we keep them home and let them get more behind?

28257,Again?
28258,"Honestly it sounds like they would have been fine (some false negatives but not many and then they could do the better nose swab tests via contact tracing), but they tried to do testing instead of masks and not in addition to."
28259,I would take up your old boss's offer.
28260,Especially if you're immunocompromised and he knows this.
28261,Maybe send him an email letting him know you're taking him up on his offer because of your health conditions first in case he doesn't know.
28262,That + an air purifier is your safest option if you're not allowed WFH.
28263,"Yeah I know my doctors have said to get tested like 3, 6, and 9 months after potential exposure for STIs, and the 6 month mark is the most likely test to show positive if you have something."
28264,I guess I thought corona came on strong and was easier to detect.
28265,Thanks for the info!
28266,I wouldn't necessarily call the test itself shoddy.
28267,"It does exactly what it was designed to do, which is to provide a rapid answer to the question, ""does this person currently showing initial symptoms have COVID-19 or something else?"""
28268,"At that initial stage, the symptoms are mild and they look very similar to the cold or the flu."
28269,"So you need a test to tell the difference, but the more sensitive PCR testing can take days or more to return a result, by which time the results may not be clinically useful anymore."
28270,"So a test like this is designed to sacrifice sensitivity for speed, on the understanding that you're only supposed to use the test on someone showing initial symptoms, because by the time a person with covid has symptoms, their viral load will have become high enough that you don't need a particularly sensitive test to detect it."
28271,"But naturally the White House ignored those warnings and used the test to screen unsympomatic individuals, which means that the low sensitivity of the test suddenly became a huge liability."
28272,Are you talking about Pete Dickets?

28514,[1] The recent spike in Europe should clarify the picture very soon.
28515,Either we get a massive number of reinfections or we can assume at least 6 months of strong immunity (which also likely means at least 1 year of partial immunity)

28584,"Based on my readings of wayyyyy too many SARS-CoV-2 papers:

The reason dexamethasone is given is that the cytokine storm, where the various immune cell signalling goes rampant, is often what kills in COVID-19, and it essentially tears up the lungs (and heart and brains on occasion too)."
28585,So you do not want to give the drug *until it gets to that point*.
28586,Dexamethasone calms the cytokine storm.

28636,"There wasn't even anything that I would have given a single thought to, but he perceived a range of potential problems ranging from inconvenience to danger."

28649,That's the main thing they promise in reality.
28650,"Death, violence, suffering, misery, just like all 'right wing' politics today."

28661,I'm probably more likely to die driving to my friend's house than from COVID.

28669,"Also, ~~pretty much~~ all biologists have studied evolutionary biology, which evangelicals hate with a passion, so to some degree they distrust anyone with expertise in any biological science."
28670,And even still there are the right's attacks on academia in general.
28671,"They *could* have played the response to the virus as the Republicans (who control virtually everything right now) saving the country from a plague, but they decided the scientists get to be the bad guys again, and once they commit to something, they interpret any backing down at all as weakness, which is the ultimate sin."
28672,This is the Achilles heel of the entire conservative movement and the people who subscribe to it.
28673,"They simply do not understand percentages, odds, statistics, or how to calculate risk."
28674,There is no such thing as a gradient.
28675,Everything either works or it doesn't-- there's no in between.
28676,So of course this is what brought down the President.
28677,"these stats are coming from labs and hospitals themselves, unmanipulated by the feds."
28678,It's at the CDC national level that we don't know whether to trust the numbers.
28679,"And of course, covid-apologist states may be fudging their numbers, but that isn't happening here in the Golden State where they're taking a go-slow approach to re-opening."
28680,"They're **both** equally dangerous, imho."
28681,It's funny you say that like it's a bad thing and you keep consistently doing it to any response so I don't know what your point is there bud.
28682,That's the way you came across.
28683,I would be very happy if that wasn't the case but you keep doubling down on the stuff so it's kind of hard within the context of this conversation that it could be different.
28684,I just keep hoping it is and keep getting disappointed with the response.
28685,"But, like, the funny kind of disappointment cause it's dumb."
28686,They haven't worn a comfortable mask yet.
28687,Super thrilled to be moving to Michigan in three weeks!

28689,Pretty massive testing occurs here at the moment.
28690,"Even though the distribution of who gets tested is biased towards likely cases, given the numbers (100k+ per day) I think it is quite representative."
28691,Am I wrong to think that?
28692,(even though no formal Implication s)
28693,No you’re not.
28694,"There’s a lot of us, you just don’t see us cause we’re all inside!"

28696,I stand corrected then.

28698,Now expos and youtube ruin everything
28699,Nah man his life doesn't matter.
28700,He's directly responsible for thousands of added deaths to this pandemic.
28701,Unless you wanna say Stalin did nothing wrong either.
28702,He deserves it.
28703,"Na, but 4 of my friends that go to penn state went to a party, and caught covid from it."
28704,They have to quarantine for 10 days now.
28705,You're ruining the country.
28706,"If you lead your life the way you lead your online persona, it's sad."
28707,You've commented before that you don't care for anybody in this country but yourself.
28708,"You've also claimed you served in Vietnam, yet are somehow between 32 and 35."
28709,"Nice try, troll."
28710,"Being stuck in a hospital, you would expect it to increase if he was as ready for discharge as they say."
28711,"IFR according to the CDC :

0-19 years : 0.003%
20-49 years : 0.02%
50-69 years : 0.5%
70+ years : 5.4%

The WHO estimates that there are 750 million people infected with COVID."
28712,1 million / 750 million = 0.13% IFR according to WHO.
28713,"Also, for anybody saying long-term effects, every virus has a long-term effect, it’s just that we don’t hear about their long-term effects as much as COVID’s long-term effects."
28714,"In conclusion, this ain’t the fucking Plague or the Spanish Flu, they were much worse diseases in general, but as a result of recency bias, people think that COVID is as deadly as both diseases."
28715,Something tells me Conjob doesn't care.
28716,Covid is a tragedy and they completely fucked it up.
28717,My conservative Ontario government actually capitalized on it and I no longer am completely embarrassed that they were elected.
28718,"Trump could have so easily done that too, but they tried so hard to convince everyone that the pandemic didn't exist...somehow being retarded enough to think that Trump could just lie for an entire year and never have the economy change."
28719,"But then after a month of that, it clearly wasn't even remotely working, and instead of just stepping up and dealing with this shit, they actually DOUBLED DOWN on trying to pretend that everything is fine."
28720,They could have so easily turned this into the single biggest win their administration could have ever possible imagined.
28721,"It's actually more mind boggling that they fucked it up so badly from THAT point of view than from the point of view of looking after Americans, which they obviously don't give a shit about."
28722,This boy needs bidet Jesus

28743,"No, your immune system doesn't consist of antibodies alone, it's just our go-to target for measuring a response and designing vaccines."
28744,"If we want a vaccine that prevents transmission though, we need to design something that creates a strong and lasting IgA response rather than the IgG response that is generally over-focused on."
28745,It seems the body only loses control of the virus once it makes it past your innate defenses.
28746,We need to design a vaccine that prevents it from getting past a superficial infection in the upper respiratory system.

29134,Cut that testicle off immediately before it spreads!
29135,Catholics are good with science it's the evangelicals that are the crazy ones.
29136,"Vote this year, vote next year, vote every year you can!"

29138,"If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work."""
29139,"You can ad to this that nearly all companies are forcing their employees to work on site and not at home, that theaters are opne, schools are open..."
29140,It is like they want people to die here.
29141,Mask on all day + an air purifier sitting right next to me.

29146,Could be nebraska as well.

29150,Pretty big error bars though.
29151,Here's the metaanalysis I got that from: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1495
29152,Why?
29153,Isn't the border shut?
29154,&gt;I'd rather wait until there's studies done or direct proof that there are long lasting effects.
29155,There are loads of scientific studies that have already been done.
29156,"You're just uneducated and probably don't even know where to find them, let alone how to read them."
29157,&gt;Both are fine and back in work.

29161,"Yeah, I had my first test last week and it was way overblown about how bad it is."
29162,"Like I wouldn’t do it for fun but come on, it’s just a swab."
29163,A cloth mask without a visor will do next to nothing to stop spread in an indoor setting as well.
29164,If you want to stop the spread you'd need a *real* mask and a visor.
29165,"Not that ordinary people need to use it, but if you are in a setting with a high amount of virus transmission, like a covid ward in a hospital, then you need a visor as well."
29166,I'll give the guy in the article some credit for saying that using only visors in hospitals is incredibly stupid.
29167,"Of course, you need both a visor and a mask in a hospital setting."

29172,If the Republican strategy was to do smash and grab on the country then it succeeded very well.

29175,Don’t do business with people who treat you badly.

29178,The only reason you give a fuck is because you worship Trump.
29179,They also crammed through more federal judge appointments than almost anyone before (mostly because the GOP blocked the Obama administration from making any appointments for the last two years of its term).
29180,Where did I say that I thought it was an entity?
29181,Even the way you frame it there is no reason for it.
29182,There is just no reason for any concept of God.
29183,"And by the way, being open minded is being able to change your point of you in face of new evidence, as I recall I never saw any evidence yet."

29195,"That being said, most people start to show symptoms within 3-5 days, sometimes 7."
29196,"But technically it is possible to be exposed to someone with the virus, then start to show symptoms 12 days later."
29197,People tend to be the most contagious 1-2 days before symptoms appear usually.
29198,What makes you think they were unsuccessful in what they wanted to accomplish?
29199,Anything said to the the plebs (not rich) is pandering and lip service.

29205,Always ask.
29206,"The political narrative is that the cure is about to be released, so this is the hydroxychloroquine of the hour."

29208,"It's just ""DAE libruls bad?"""
29209,and the ritual of government with no thought required.
29210,Because using masks acknowledges the danger of this pandemic.
29211,Acknowledging the danger undermines their efforts to sacrifice to poor to keep the rich afloat.
29212,"Pretty much dejavu,,,we tried this back in April,,,please tell our president and state officials that saying ”we must reopen” isn’t a solution"

29224,Time will tell.
