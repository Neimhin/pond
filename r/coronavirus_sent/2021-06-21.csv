187,"Abstract  
It has recently been hypothesized that vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19."
188,We aimed to test the hypotheses that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients.
189,"In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 138 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional vitamin K status in peripheral tissue."
190,Forty-three patients died within 90 days from admission.
191,"In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820)."
192,"Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540)."
193,"Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24)."
194,"The association attenuated and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, and eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80)."
195,"In conclusion, we found that low vitamin K status was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 in sex- and age-adjusted analyses, but not in analyses additionally adjusted for co-morbidities."
196,"Randomized clinical trials would be needed to clarify a potential role, if any, of vitamin K in the course of COVID-19."

232,"In the 1930s, the German government loved science and used German scientific advancement as evidence of national superiority."
233,But any science that came from the wrong ethnic group was rejected.

277,"Not a very vicious one, but still."
278,[removed]
279,"No, it's an argument about how there's enough immunity through vaccines and plain old exposure that we can finally stop using masks and lockdowns in most situations."
280,Vaccine induced protection by its nature doesn't provide as high a level of antibodies in the lungs and nasal passages compared to those who actually caught covid by breathing it in.
281,This means a high enough viral load of covid could last long enough in some people to cause some of the loss of smell/taste symptoms but it should be to a much lower degree.
282,Which all adds up to a 'We don't really know but maybe if you were super unlucky'.
283,It's *always* secondary to some broader issue.
284,"In most cases, it relates to deep mistrust of authority."
285,"If you think that the people in charge of your societies are so bad as to be criminal (and it's understandable that some people would reach this conclusion, given what a mess they've made in recent decades), then you won't trust any kind of medicine that they try to convince you to take."
286,"The inherently authoritarian nature of covid lockdowns makes this issue worse: to a certain section of the population, it fits into a narrative whereby government takes away freedoms, waits until people are desperate for anything to get back to normal, then offers a convenient solution."
287,"You can poke all kinds of holes in their logic, but motivated reasoning can lead people to astonishing conclusions."
288,"And as another poster pointed out, for some people it has become deeply entwined with their sense of identity."
289,"In these cases there doesn't need to be any kind of coherent reasoning behind it: vaccines become associated with ""the enemy"" to the point that they're practically the same thing, and vaccination programmes constitute a personal attack on them and the people they love."

298,Wonder if the hesitancy in Russia is distrust of Western vaccines from the disinformation campaign or distrust in their own government and Sputnik V.
299,&gt;This precipitous drop in COVID deaths is happening without masks or lockdowns.
300,Is that another one of those arguments about how masks and lockdowns are useless?
301,There is no way to stop all preventable deaths.
302,It's simply impossible.
303,"One, sure."
304,"All, no way."
305,"A lot of people here seem to think it’s a “boomer” or older person thing to not get vaccinated, but most of the outspoken anti-vaxxers I know are millennials and Gen Z."
306,Most of the people I know who are 50+ got vaccinated.
307,And most of them are more conservative.
308,The elderly people in their 80s and 90s (silent generation) remember a time when vaccines for different diseases (like polio)  weren’t available so they are actually more pro-vaccine than the younger generations.
309,They have seen the benefits.
310,I only know one “boomer” who didn’t get vaccinated (not counting those who previously had Covid) but he says he would get one if he needed one to travel to another country.
311,The 1918 flu ravaged the world to about two years before it became less virulent.
312,Here's hoping we have a similar timeline with covid.

323,"I'm not a medical professional, so when in doubt please ask a doctor - I've just looked into this a lot for my dad's sake."
324,It's really folks who are on treatments that wipe out or suppress their immune system to the extent that it can't form an immune response or produce antibodies that are the worry.
325,People with organ transplants have to take medications that wipe out their immune response so that their body doesn't reject their transplant.
326,They will die without their medication and don't have the option of pausing it.
327,People on chemo or chemo-related drugs like methotrexate don't have a good immune response due to the drug itself - they usually have to go off their medication or wait until they're in between chemo rounds to get the vaccine.
328,"In short, cardiac patients should have as good protection as anyone."
329,"But like I said, I'm not a medical professional, just worried about my dad haha."
330,Nobody’s saying it’s acceptable.
331,But it’s a huge improvement over a few months ago.
332,"I think the biggest reason for this is because we in the United States are living in the peak of the ""Age of Misinformation""."
333,Uneducated folks buy into everything social media tells them.
334,Willfully pounding the rhetoric spewed by conspiracy theorists.
335,Don't get me wrong certain theories i think can hold some weight.
336,"Most of them are just the title ""Theories""."
337,"As soon as i heard about the whole"" great reset"" and the microchip idea."
338,I had 2 thoughts that came to mind.
339,#1 We are already being tracked.
340,"Ie* cellphones 
#2 If the elitists truly wanted common folks decreased in large numbers they would have already done that long ago."
341,"I always ask the theorists"" Ok, so whats the end game""?"
342,I've never recieved a formidable response.
343,"It's usually just more ""Theories"""
344,There is a lot of RSV in my area and it’s very easily confused with Covid
345,I don’t think religion is really the root of the problem.
346,It’s more of a tool.
347,The root is greed.
348,The billionaires and multi-millionaires throw their power into controlling govt so they don’t have to pay taxes and have their businesses regulated.
349,"To do that they buy politicians, control the media etc to get the message being that govt is inefficient, that taxes are theft, that using that tax money to help the poor is communism, that the greatest thing is “freedom” which means the govt should be tiny and out of the way."
350,"They fund think-tanks to come up with a bunch of talking points and trick people into voting against their own interests by focusing on things like abortion, or immigration, or religion."
351,Follow the money.
352,Giving followup doses of mRNA/subunit after a primer of a vectored/inactivated vaccine could be as effective a vaccine as we have.
353,But it's on individual health departments to make this choice; so far only Canada has done so (in part it's why they have had the most successful vaccination campaign over the last two months).
354,And keep them rolling because the vaccinations are going to need ongoing boosters for who knows how long.
355,"You must give up on some level, some freedom to be a member of any community."
356,"Unless the people shouting “my freedom”, want to go it absolutely alone, they need to get vaccinated."
357,"In my opinion, for what that’s worth."
358,Make sure they keep masking.
359,"I’m fully vaccinated and have continued to wear a mask even though the likelihood of me picking it up and bringing it home to the under twelves is slim, I’d rather be safe."
360,Wait til you hear how many people die each day.
361,"I was just in TX, plenty of people still wear masks indoors."
362,"The governor is an idiot, but glad to see individuals still being responsible."
363,Delta has been shown to more easily escape previous immunity.

365,"&gt; It's only a matter of time before it mutates further and makes our current vaccines ineffective, so how do we combat this?"

369,Which part?
370,Laws can change?
371,Unclear on why my suggestions are impossible?
372,Or my openness to hearing others’ opinions?
373,"If that’s psychotic, then I guess I’m stricken with psychosis."
374,"Haha, dude nobody is saying that."
375,The point is you moving the goalposts.
376,You're acting like you provided a counterpoint when actually it was just a completely different point altogether.

378,You distilled it to a single explanation not me.

385,My kid was born February 2020 and I got hit with a double dose of both (yay!
386,/s).
387,"As part of the PPA, I felt like I had to do all the things all the time, or else I was terrible and clearly my kid would be better off without me."
388,"I know it sounds irritational, but you could not convince me to stop going for anything."
389,Thanks for the devastating news.
390,It’s not going to stop me from wishing well for others though.
391,Sorry to hear that!
392,How did you find this out?
393,How did they test for this?
394,The microchip thing is so easily debunked too.
395,We don't have Star Trek Borg level technology.
396,People who are immunocompromised do not get much benefit from any of the vaccines and therefore rely on herd immunity.
397,Which is what makes anti vaxxers so dangerous
398,Do you know how  it is for people with heart disease?
399,I believe CAD/hypertension.
400,Yep.
401,If it's anything like last year there will be a summer surge as people congregate indoors for air conditioning.

411,"Right, because 100% of antivaxxers that get this variant of covid are gonna die."
412,The vast vast majority of people who don’t get the vaccine are going to be perfectly fine.
413,Coming from someone who is fully vaccinated
414,"Yep, that's how disease works."
415,Some of it is outside of our control and the world is permanently different.
416,"I wouldn't advise looking up how many people die of cancer every day if the 300 figure scares you, btw."
417,"You know, there might be a lot of middle ground between ""come back unchecked"" and ""leave them stranded to die alone""."
418,You are doing right by your kid.
419,Stay strong!
420,"My kids don't have any risky conditions, but with a new variant coming out every other week, I too am wearing masks when I'm in anywhere crowded or indoors."
421,"&gt; The Delta variant breaks through vacccines

Every variant ""breaks through"" vaccines, because they're not 100% effective."
422,The Delta variant isn't significantly better at it than the others.
423,"And when a breakthrough happens, the resulting infection is almost always mild."
424,"&gt;those who have natural ""immunity"" (which dissipates after some months, they aren't even sure, but anti-bodies dissipate after some 3-9 months they believe.)"
425,"This has been speculated on since the beginning, but it turns out the antibodies are still around and kicking."
426,"&gt;So..you have a virus that is 4x stronger than the original

You just made that up."
427,"&gt;As we get more immunity the virus also mutates and gets stronger

That is not how mutations work."
428,The majority of mutations actually produce weaker variants.
429,"It's not some video game where the virus ""levels up""."
430,&gt;Not until you get to like 85% recently vaxxed/very recently recovered for herd immunity.
431,"45% fully vaxxed...is just not there yet, thus....around 10,000 cases per day still."
432,This doesn't take into account natural immunities.
433,"The pandemic is dropping off despite not reaching your arbitary 85% vaccination, even when cities open up completely."
434,&gt; With experts saying they are certain there will be surges in the fall.
435,"Some are, some aren't."
436,Many of them don't have good track records.
437,"I don't know how to tell you this, but a utopia where the only way people die is old age is not realistic."
438,We will see what delta does to case numbers.
439,Seems like it's likely to hit vaccine hesitant communities pretty hard.
440,Maybe if delta turns around the fatalities some of the hesitant will become less hesitant.

464,Trying to do the right thing
465,No more masks here in Ohio either.
466,I had just gotten my kids back into some of their activities because overall case numbers were so low and I'm hoping they stay that way...
467,But definitely watching closely.
468,It honestly depends.
469,"Usually yes, especially if they can’t survive without a ventilator."

481,"I wasn't talking about the vaccine, I was asking about all the research and stats."
482,I'm vaccinated with a dose myself.
483,The issue is that it will take years for everyone worldwide you get vaccinated.
484,"My kids probably won't get the jab this year (ok, chances for serious reactions are low) and the population of less developed countries is unprotected."
485,"True, further variants of concern will likely emerge there and not here, but still, we are not done yet"
486,Any idea what were the UK estimates of flu deaths for the 2019 flu season?
487,We're going a bit slower here now :/ We were ahead of you guys for a while but we've reached the limits of our system.

499,"Already did, fully vaccinated :) I was called first as I was deemed an essential worker (teacher)."
500,"My grandparents are already fully vaccinated, my parents will take their second shots in a week or so."
501,Problem here is that people under 35 can't still go take their shots.

549,That's not correct Taiwan explicitly banned mainland Chinese vaccines and a major source of debate after the outbreak was whether to allow the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine manufactured by Fosun (mainland Chinese company) to be imported.

551,There is strong hesitancy against mainland vaccines but those are not being used in Taiwan.

582,So many people don't care.
583,And I can confirm that there is such an attitude you describe.
584,"&gt;They are not saying that it's unsafe or that vaccines are not approved for under 18's but instead are just saying that everyone 18 and over should be vaccinated, and simply not saying anything about those who are under 18."
585,You're conflating different things.
586,"Yes they're saying that everyone over 18 should be vaccinated, but no they're actually saying very clearly that people under 18 should hold off for now on getting vaccinated."
587,"&gt;Which to me means that if you have kids who are 12 and up, they should be getting vaccinated as soon as they can, so they can be protected from potential problems/issues that can result from COVID-19."
588,How exactly did you derive that from this WHO statement?
589,":

&gt;""Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."
590,"There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children"" 

&gt;The WHO is really pushing hard to try to increase the number of vaccine doses that are going to the less economically developed countries, and this is why the messaging is this way."
591,"So, more vaccines for the brown and black skinned countries, and less doses for children of the mostly white western countries?"
592,"&gt;I would only be concerned if the WHO came out and said that it was dangerous to vaccinate people under 18, and well, that's really unlikely to happen."
593,"So the fact they came out and said children under 18 should not be vaccinated at this time for COVID, until more information and studies are done on this age group doesn't bother you or cause you to even think twice?"

606,how much land can you buy and defend from  squatters?
607,Maybe a few dozen acres?
608,"Even then, what if you are outnumbered or outgunned?"
609,That is why capitalism requires a state which defends private property.

710,"They are not saying that it's unsafe or that vaccines are not approved for under 18's but instead are just saying that everyone 18 and over should be vaccinated, and simply not saying anything about those who are under 18."
711,"In the US the CDC and FDA are who decides what vaccines are safe and who is eligible to get vaccinated, and certain vaccines have been approved for 12 and up."
712,"Which to me means that if you have kids who are 12 and up, they should be getting vaccinated as soon as they can, so they can be protected from potential problems/issues that can result from COVID-19."
713,"The WHO is really pushing hard to try to increase the number of vaccine doses that are going to the less economically developed countries, and this is why the messaging is this way."

1017,Not for variants...do you have any examples of what you're thinking about?
1018,You said there would be around 300 deaths because of the delta variant.
1019,"He said the UK has much more delta variant and have a lower death rate than the US: in other words, if the US had the same death rate as the UK, they would have less than 300 deaths per day."
1020,And you even understood that the US is different because of mask mandates and vax resistance.
1021,"There you go, these are the reasons why the US might hover around 300 deaths per day for a long."
1022,"The delta variant is an indirect cause, the US would probably have similar numbers (give or take 25%) regardless of variant."

1073,"Don't get me wrong, zero deaths isn't realistic - **on the short term** - even if 100% got vaccinated, but the ""reason"" you provided has nothing to do with it."
1074,It's because there's no vaccine that's 100% effective for an entire population.
1075,"However, 100% vaccination would VERY quickly eradicate the virus that the vaccines are effective against."
1076,And then we get 0 deaths.

1132,And parents (for now) get to decide for themselves when there is enough evidence to show the vaccines are safe for their child.

1169,Pfizer is 88% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid.

1171,"It's actually pretty clear that they're talking about everyone under the age of 18 when you put it into the full context:

&gt;WHO SHOULD GET VACCINATED

&gt;**The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older,** including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders."

&gt;**Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."

&gt;There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19."

1176,"However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines."
1177,It's still comparing it to a global pandemic caused by a virus that's stupid easy to spread.
1178,Obesity on the other hand is the result of lifestyle choices (which are likely also the result of the environment one finds themselves in) and is much harder to address.
1179,"Addressing Covid boils down to ""take the fucking vaccine,"" whereas addressing obesity may require societal changes, such as reducing work hours (but not wages) so people can afford to cook/prepare their own meals and exercise."

1232,"The chance of a serious adverse event occuring from having the vaccine is much lower than you experiencing serious negative effects from contracting Covid, unvaccinated."
1233,The pandemic is over if you are fully vaccinated and well within fully vaccinated social circles.
1234,"In places with high vaccination rates, herd immunity should kick in."
1235,Unvaccinated people will be vulnerable proportionally to how many vaccinated surround them.
1236,An unvaccinated person whose contacts are vaccinated is virtually immune.
1237,The pandemic is over for them too.
1238,"However, unvaccinated people in social circles of unvaccinated individuals are very vulnerable to strains that are becoming more contagious and deadly."
1239,"For them, the pandemic will continue, unless enough people vaccinate."
1240,May I ask you a question as an American?
1241,"How would you feel about fully vacinated UK travellers coming on vacation to the US, if they also had to have a negative test before flying?"
1242,"In general, I’d typically agree, but allowing people who are poised to spread a potentially deadly virus should also never be legal in a normal country."
1243,"I don’t see a middle ground, but am definitely open to any and all ideas for a better solution to change my opinion on the matter."

1246,That or give a tax exempt... credit... idk what it's called I'm not a tax man.
1247,They could give you money towards your taxes  if you got the vaccine or they could do the opposite and charge money for not having it like they did with health insurance.
1248,Interesting!

1254,"When delta variant becomes dominant in US, more people will try to get vaccinated but it will be late."
1255,Not being reviewed means that scientists have themselves wrote up the study.
1256,It then goes through peer review to vet out any studied that a wrong.
1257,"In practice, as long as the scientists are well know an respected (in this case), conclusions are likely to stay."

1291,The UK has already [initiated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-seeks-extra-astrazeneca-shots-combat-beta-covid-19-variant-2021-06-01/) about buying the updated vaccine for boosters.
1292,"Meh, in the context of my username I’d be more of a void than wrong."
1293,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1296,*
1297,Singapore has virtually no covid?
1298,We had 15 cases today
1299,There’s zero comparison there.
1300,"But yeah, I said that."
1301,"That's sad :/

How old is he/she by the way?"
1302,No we only fine them for that.
1303,True lol
1304,Where can I buy the dip?
1305,"Cases flat, no deaths for a week, looks really bad there, I hope the media finds some more bad news to keep them afloat soon

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/missouri/"
1306,"Thanks a lot for all the info we are one month behind you guys, so every info is appreciated."
1307,Why do you still go?
1308,Edit: I don’t mean to be rude.
1309,Genuinely curious given the demographic.
1310,Message me the sources I’d be glad to look them over
1311,Like review of products you usually only hear the very bad things or very good things.
1312,No one with a minor sore arm or something ever bothers to report because it’s not worth their time.
1313,"My parents, wife, stepson, aunt and I were all vaccinated and I was the only one to bother to report anything and that’s only because I’m on Reddit often anyway."
1314,"No, anecdote isn't great."
1315,"Since we both shared anecdotes, here is some data."
1316,Breakthrough cases are at least common enough that the Tennessee department of health is publicly tracking them.
1317,"[See here](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html) - the critical indicator report, page 5."
1318,"As of June 10th the state of Tennessee (not my state btw, but where my mom lives, and we had been discussing it) had 940 breakthrough cases."
1319,See this [article](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/st-louis-county-health-department-has-seen-212-breakthrough-covid-cases/63-0bb5f94c-1257-4285-ac39-2d1254fe0620) from June 3rd in St Louis.
1320,"It does say that breakthrough cases are ""extremely rare."""
1321,"But then it goes on to say:

&gt;The department has identified 212 breakthrough infections."
1322,"&gt;More than 350,000 adults in St. Louis County are fully vaccinated, according to the state of Missouri."
1323,"&gt;Even with vaccine effectiveness of 90% or higher, a small percentage of people still will get sick."
1324,&gt;Some evidence shows that vaccination may make illness less severe in breakthrough cases.
1325,"&gt;Still, some of those people may be hospitalized or die from COVID-19."
1326,&gt;Most breakthrough infections present with very minor symptoms.
1327,"In 17% of the health department's cases, the person is asymptomatic and was tested because of exposure, usually to a household member with COVID-19 who was unvaccinated."
1328,The vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant.
1329,"The Delta variant is prevalent in my community, cases are growing in my region, and while most of the people getting sick are not vaccinated, we have seen a handful of fully vaxxed people test positive."
1330,"Given the data listed above, I'd say my clinic's experience is pretty typical."
1331,"I don't feel that it's appropriate to respond to this person's query by telling them breakthrough cases are rare, when rare doesn't mean the same thing in medicine as it does in colloquial terminology."
1332,Certainly depends on the magnitude of damage we’re talking here.
1333,Remember that a bottle of beer also causes brain damage.
1334,Also brains as other organs can repair themselves.
1335,That's so sad.
1336,"I hope it never happens, but if you're going to die, you may as well do it in public and spectacularly to raise awareness..."
1337,That's a giant reservoir for the virus to mutate to something vaccine resistant.
1338,So not great.
1339,That's the best part.
1340,"A conspiracy of this magnitude would require bribing or *disappearing* literally hundreds of thousands of people, and the complete cooperation of hundreds of governments which have political motivations so far apart they usually can't even agree the sky is blue."
1341,"The ones I find especially idiotic are the ones who say ""everyone who's been vaccinated is gonna be dead by winter!!!""."
1342,"Like dude, TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE in Europe alone have already been vaccinated (with at least one dose)."
1343,"Chances are if you ask 10 random people around you, 5 have already been partially vaccinated and will tell you they're completely fine."
1344,And if the vaccines were *anywhere* near as deadly as you say the bodies would be piling up in the streets by now.
1345,I just don't understand how they can ignore the cognitive dissonance between what they say is happening and what they can actually **see** happening.
1346,We still don't have the full story from Russia.
1347,"Suggestion: Read the full Reuters article &lt;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-19-may-cause-loss-brain-tissue-delta-variant-fuels-steep-infection-rise-2021-06-18/&gt;, including this excerpt from it:  
             
""Even mild cases of COVID-19 may lead to loss of brain tissue, according to findings from a long-term study involving 782 volunteers."
1348,"As part of the ongoing UK Biobank study, participants underwent brain scans before the pandemic."
1349,"For a before-and-after comparison, researchers invited 394 COVID-19 survivors to come back for follow-up scans as well as 388 healthy volunteers."
1350,"Most of the COVID-19 survivors had had only mild-to-moderate symptoms, or no symptoms at all, while 15 had been hospitalized."
1351,"Among the COVID-19 survivors, researchers saw ""significant"" loss of gray matter in regions of the brain....""  
         
The Reuter's article links to the ""Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank"" article, and ""This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed [what does this mean?]."
1352,It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.
1353,""": https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690v1"
1354,So that Duterte guy manages to make the right decisions sometimes.
1355,Usually he is just insane.
1356,And a fentanyl addict.
1357,"G-d bless us, everyone."
1358,Most hospitalized patients were unvaccinated before vaccines were widely available?
1359,Shocking.
1360,"This article discusses it, but it’s not the one I had read."
1361,Maybe you can find one that explains it better.
1362,My understanding is that the virus actually resides in vascular tissue and has been found in the penile tissue in patients who have long since healed from the disease with or without other symptoms.
1363,"It was failing rare (from what I remember), but the inflammation seems to have destroyed the small veins that supply blood to the spongy tissue that swells during erection."
1364,I can’t see how increased blood flow to veins that don’t exist anymore can help with that.
1365,I’m obviously no doctor though.

1397,"The people who need to hear this message won't get it because they might literally shoot the messenger, so the messenger wont be coming."
1398,The problem with most of the reporting around vaccines in just pure lack of context.
1399,One vaccine producing lower antibodies isn’t bad as long that amount is well above a threshold.
1400,The problem is scientists don’t know how to interpret the antibody number.
1401,Also there is more to our immune system than just antibodies.
1402,"For example, the PHE found AZ to be 92% effective versus the delta variant while Pfizer was 88% effective."
1403,It doesn’t mean Pfizer is worse than AZ.
1404,Both are equally good and highly effective.
1405,I have heard stories of people dying in their thirties from the delta variant.
1406,Sure it’s not as high but even people in 40s and 50s are succumbing.
1407,Which is scary as fk.
1408,The low risk of a blood clot is definitely scary but you have more chances of dying from covid than the blood clot.
1409,"I did some rough maths and if AZ were given to entire population of India, the total number of blood clot cases would be equally to 1.5 times the peak daily death rate."
1410,And the daily death rate in India was undercounted as well.

1535,To me it sounds like its just as infectious as the original virus.
1536,Infecting people who are NOT vaccinated.
1537,Spreading and getting people who are NOT vaccinated sick.
1538,"IDK, I think im just tired of hearing how every variant is so dangerous when the only real danger are to the people who HAVENT been vaccinated just like the original covid-19 outbreak."
1539,End rant.
1540,Just happy anyone who is vaccinated are still continuing to be safe
1541,That’s really admirable.
1542,Amazing how different cultures work.
1543,In America that decision would backfire and lead to more suspicion.

1545,It's in Florida.
1546,Their governor is fanatical trump minion and they are dumb enough for one school to ban vaccinated teachers from being around kids.

In my country we can get tested for free with rapid antigen tests at pharmacies and test stations."

1557,I'm a competitive athlete so through the recent lockdowns we were allowed to continue training and competing in a contact sport.

1559,"on all training days, days before games and days of games."

1678,"“The highly contagious delta variant is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain that will ""pick off"" the most vulnerable people, the World Health Organization said.”"
1679,"TL;DR higher the vaccination rate and more measures to lower the spread, make mutations less likely to get out of control."
1680,"I'm not an expert, but as I understand it, viruses only get eradicated with high vaccination rates."
1681,Which rate is needed depends on how infective the virus is and how effective the vaccines are.
1682,"When a virus doesn't get eradicated, it inevitably mutates over time and existing vaccines may not protect us to the same extent."
1683,"Even if they do, the risk for unvaccinated people may be higher because the virus can be more infective (it will spread better with a certain percentage of vaccinated people) or have more severe consequences."
1684,The base reproduction number indicates how many people are infected by reach infected person on average of nobody is protected.
1685,"The effective reproduction number is influenced by protection given by measures like distancing, better hygiene and masks on one side and immunity (whether through infection or vaccination)."
1686,"If a virus has a base reproduction number of 6 for example, it can infect a large percentage of the population very quickly."
1687,"If 80% of people are vaccinated with a vaccine that's 100% effective and nobody yet has immunity, the resulting reproduction number is 6 * 0.2 = 1.2. for numbers over 1, the number of cases grows exponentially."
1688,"For these hypothetical numbers, the vaccination rate combined with the effectiveness of the vaccine isn't enough."
1689,You'd need more than 5/6 of the population with immunity.
1690,"Alternatively, measures like distancing and masks make it harder for the virus to infect people."
1691,"If those measures make it 40% harder for the virus to spread, that would change the resulting number to 1.2 * 0.6 = 0.72."
1692,This means it will gradually disappear.
1693,"Now if a certain variant is twice as infectious, those measures aren't enough (1.44 &gt; 1)."
1694,That same strain with 90% immunity would still be under control.
1695,"A strain that the vaccines don't protect against as well, will also result in a higher resulting number."
1696,"That is why vaccination rates are important, combined with other preventative measures."
1697,"Measles for example has a very high reproduction number (12 - 18), which is why high immunity rates (95%+) are needed to keep it under control."
1698,As long as the resulting reproduction number is low enough mutations can't thrive and don't pose a significant risk.
1699,mortality is flat because the majority of their older population is vaccinated and the spread is driven by the young who were not yet vaccinated

1715,"The comparison between the US and Australia isn't a good one,because Australia has been largely covid free this entire time, and that has had a direct impact on vaccine hesitatency."
1716,There has also been far fewer vaccinations given out in Australia.

1860,Yeah just go and see vaccination numbers in past days.
1861,They have been in constant decline.
1862,"And for past 2-3 days, there was hardly any vaccinations done in many states."

1868,"I did not use the word ""cure"" or ""all"" when talking about future infections."
1869,"What I actually said was, ""It prevents almost all future infections."""
1870,"It reduces your likelihood by about 95%, and if enough people were to get vaccinated, the R0 would not be high enough for the virus to continue to circulate in our population."
1871,Sounds like the TVA isn't doing their job.
1872,Gotta prune that variant.
1873,"Yep, this was the same in many countries in the early days."
1874,Germany was an exception.
1875,"UK is now surge testing for delta and judging by current low death/case ratio, their case counting is far more accurate compared to other western countries."
1876,"Yes, you are correct."
1877,"But to properly analyze the data (and I am willing to believe that the authors of this paper did this correctly) you have to do something to the effect of:

1."
1878,Divide everyone into groups (vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated).
1879,These groups will have different sizes.
1880,2.
1881,Divide each of those groups into subgroups based on age and pre-existing conditions.
1882,3.
1883,"Then, for each subgroup, compute (#of deaths)/(# of people in group)."
1884,4.
1885,Then you compare the vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated subgroups.
1886,"For a 96% efficacy, you should find that the above value is 96% smaller for the vaccinated group than the unvaccinated."
1887,"The reason the number of deaths is comparable between groups is that the vaccinated group is so much larger than the unvaccinated group, for the demographics that make up the vast majority of deaths."
1888,As you can see [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833) the UK has an extremely high vaccination rate among the elderly.
1889,Honestly if you want to get this age group to get the vaccine tie it to student debt forgiveness or a straight 50k scholarship (for use on self or kids).
1890,"People aren’t going to be reasonably incentivized by $100, free pizza, a chance to win a lotto, or even possible punishment (think higher healthcare premiums or even death)."

1912,Just blows mind that the one thing he did right is not celebrated by his followers lol
1913,The delta variant is infecting people a lot younger than the original strain.
1914,"If this doesn't convince the 18-26 year olds, nothing likely will."

Vaccines work."

1963,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/11/delta-variant-is-linked-to-90-of-covid-cases-in-uk)
1964,I think it has more to do with how he downplayed the virus than his stance on getting vaccinated.
1965,"Of the very few people I know who are not vaccinated, they say ""it's just a cold, I'm not worried about it, I don't need a vaccine""."
1966,"There is the idea that the vaccines are more harmful than the virus, and that was a thing Trump really pushed."
1967,"All the theater about how when he got Covid, he downplayed the symptoms, never commented about the bleeding edge treatment he got and how average Americans shouldn't expect that level of care, etc."
1968,"I don't think Trump was/is anti-vax, but he planted the seed of why you don't need the vaccine."
1969,&gt;Two years into a pandemic with no cure is scary shit.
1970,We have a highly effective vaccine.
1971,"It's not a cure for current infections, but it prevents almost all future infections if you're able and smart enough to get it."
1972,"My partner is one of those people, but the vaccines don't work as well for her and they haven't approved a third dose yet."
1973,"We also have a young child who can't be vaccinated, so it's frustrating for us that people say it's only the unvaccinated that are affected."
1974,"It's also the vaccinated who will be exposed to Covid by them, children, immunocompromised, the hospital system, and our tax money to support fixing them back up or the shutdowns that we've had to endure in the economy."
1975,"I know people don't have an obligation to help others, but I kind of selfishly wish more would take it into account."
1976,Why is that weird or bad?
1977,Moderna is a fairly small American company who contracted mostly with the US government who I understand to have basically handled their scale-up manufacturing for them.
1978,The understanding was always that their primary market initially was going to be the US.
1979,"BioNTech is also a small outfit in Germany, but they had the RND might from Pfizer (nominally American, but very international company) behind them, and even more importantly their global supply and manufacturing chain, so they'd naturally expect to be selling more globally."
1980,I don't think they even directly took Warp Speed funds like Moderna did.
1981,[Vaccine efficacy has been shown to be lower](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852) in immunocompromised/immunosuppressed individuals.
1982,"How that translates to hospitalization/fatality rates remains to be seen, but there's a reasonable expectation that getting the vaccine is only going to help some of them."
1983,[removed]
1984,Am I reading this correctly?
1985,"Out of 73 deaths from the Delta variant, the majority were from vaccinated people?"
1986,"(39 vaccinated, 34 unvaccinated)?"
1987,And 26 of them were 14+ days after the second dose?
1988,[removed]
1989,I think Canadians might be the most risk averse people I've ever met.
1990,"They're averaging 20 deaths a day (and falling) across nearly 40 million people, with a high and growing vaccination rate."
1991,Seems like overkill at this point.
1992,There's no adequate real world study for 2 doses of AZ.
1993,The data used to determine the breakthrough infection rate for AZ is skewed to a very short period following dose 2.
1994,This was not the case for Pfizer which was rolled out a month earlier in the UK and with 3 week spacing.
1995,The authors state this in the discussion.
1996,"Also, to assume that mild symptoms in a vaccinated cohort confers the same or similar transmission risk as an unvaccinated cohort is extrapolating and is certainly not proven."
1997,"For all we know, having mild non-specific symptoms may be ""safer"" for transmissibility than having no symptoms at all (asymptomatic breakthrough  infection)."
1998,The article posted says the Delta variant is worse than the Alpha variant and 60% more transmittable.
1999,Here is an article from April about the Alpha variant and kids.

2012,For the sake of consistency I will use the CDC percent estimates but understand the true value is somewhat lower.
2013,Where are you getting the Chicago stat?
2014,There's evidence that the vaccine is not as effective in immunocompromised people.
2015,Those people can still be at risk
2016,Trump and Biden are also both elderly with pre-existing conditions
2017,"This is insane, the inventory of mRNA vaccine technology says this spike protein is dangerous?"
2018,If you consider seasonality then you should note that flu deaths reach the level of noise in the summer months.
2019,"SARS-CoV-2 seasonality is less well defined, but it is clear that there are major seasonal effects at play with the virus."
2020,It is not by chance that most of the Northern Hemisphere had major surges at the same time last year as weather cooled despite the major variants of concern that have higher rates of spread not becoming predominant until late winter.
2021,"I am not sure where you are getting your 81,000 deaths estimate from for the 2017-2018 season."
2022,"CDC's best estimate is 61,000 with a wide confidence interval (but if you want to take the high end of that confidence interval, add 30% to COVID deaths to match up with excess death metrics as well)."
2023,That's 167 deaths/day for the worst flu year in a decade.
2024,"The average for the past 10 years has been 36K a year, or just under 100 deaths a day which I mentioned above."
2025,I am unsure where masking and social distancing came into play with my comments.
2026,I was only stating that COVID is still killing more people than the flu.
2027,This is a factually accurate statement that has nothing to do with interventions.
2028,"The number one intervention right now should be vaccination - not continuing involuntary masking, social distancing, or restrictions."
2029,"Unfortunately the political will to mandate vaccinations - either overall or within populations (e.g., government employees, schools, transportation, etc) - is not there."
2030,And so people will continue to die.
2031,"I am not optimistic that deaths will go below 100/day (to me the best threshold to get ""under flu"" levels) in the short term without tackling vaccination in rural and other low-vaccination regions."
2032,It's kind of unfortunate that it requires 3 shots though.
2033,"This states that are gonna hit hardest from the Delta variant are the states that won’t lockdown or bring back restrictions under any circumstances, and have low vaccination rates."
2034,"If anything, I can see mask mandates returning in the “serious states” (I.e California, most of New England, Michigan etc.)"
2035,this Winter if they see small spikes from the Delta variant.

2039,"It's to get as many people vaccinated, and take precautions until then."

2047,He does link the original source though if you or anyone does want to see it.
2048,"But again, I don't know who you think you're arguing against."
2049,Literally no one is arguing you should get one dose but not two.
2050,"You start your comment with ""being hospitalized in any capacity is a fairly significant medical attention"" despite the fact that the data proves being hospitalized is exceedingly rare with any vaccination at all."
2051,And these are the people I'm talking about.
2052,The spread of a virus is almost entirely irrelevant if the virus is made similar to a flu or any other virus that we've lived with for many years.
2053,"For hopefully the last time, I'll mention again that this isn't an argument that people shouldn't get a 2nd dose."
2054,This is an argument that anyone acting like Delta will lead to some new and worrying wave of hospitalizations and deaths in majority vaccinated countries is either misinformed or lying to you.
2055,When we have global cooperation and stop hiding things that can help humanity.
2056,So yeah never.
2057,"There's really no reason not to vax the immunocompromised with mRNA, which contains no virus, dead or alive."

2135,When 100% of the population is vaccinated 100% of the deaths will be doubly vaccinated.
2136,"It's meaningless if you don't consider that the deaths are much fewer and the people most at risk of dying are doubly vaccinated, biasing the results towards the statistic you showed."
2137,More like: Not for a lack of availability
2138,why not n95s that are more effective?
2139,I think my son had covid and the doctor dismissed it.

2216,"&gt;Combining this finding with our minimum vaccine effectiveness against   
symptomatic disease estimate would suggest that a single dose of   
BNT162b2 is around 80% effective at preventing hospital admission for   
covid-19 and around 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19."
2217,"This was conducted with mainline, and B1.1.7 as the main vectors, not Delta."

2341,"Depending on where you are in the country, wearing or not wearing the mask signals something while the vaccination decision is largely unknown but can be inferred."
2342,"Imagine a 2x2 box of outcomes where it's masked/vaccinated, masked/unvaccinated, unmasked/vaccinated and unmasked/unvaccinated, and everybody in your peer group is trying to guess the unknown vaccination decision based on the masked decision and all the other variables they know about you and the local area."

2441,"At worst, a vaccine will have a complication rate of 1 per 10'000, which is a lot and means that it's got really poor QA."
2442,"COVID has a complication rate of 10-30%, and your chance to contract it before this pandemic ends is, according to official Moscow statistics, assuming we're about in the middle of the pandemic, \~10% (you may have to multiply this number by a factor of 2-3)."
2443,So a vaccine with a complication rate lower than 1% and efficiency greater than 0% is safer than no vaccine at all.

2466,"Sure but they can't get the shot, so what use would including them in the statistic be?"
2467,&gt; The difference between 95.2 and 94.1 isn’t actually a difference statistically speaking.
2468,"To be clear, this difference can be statistically significant depending on the variance of each measure (i.e., just because the numbers are close does not mean they aren't statistically different)."

2544,&gt;Yes that's right - the zero Covid countries.
2545,Australia and NZ didn't have much community spread to begin with.
2546,In countries where spread got out of hand you will never have zero COVID.
2547,It will always be endemic.
2548,Well all passengers on the plane are required to quarantine.
2549,I am unsure about flight attendants but that's definitely a potential risk.
2550,All arrivals are required to take a taxi to the quarantine hotel.
2551,This definitely sounds like a weak link to me.
2552,But so far no outbreak has emerged from this aspect.
2553,I assume there's a plastic screen between the driver and the passenger.
2554,And I know for certain the airport taxi drivers are only allowed to take people from the airport to quarantine hotels and aren't allowed to collect any other passengers.
2555,They also keep a record of which passengers were matched to each driver.
2556,"So if a passenger is found to have COVID, the driver and his/her family can be sent to a quarantine hotel too."

2562,"And then Phase III protocols come, and the whole result refers to data provided by the Ministry of Health."
2563,So the whole story smells like shit from a mile away.

2820,Let’s not call it the flu.
2821,"There is some indication of Covid shrinking brain matter, causing diabetes, and making erectile dysfunction five times more likely, among other things."
2822,A few years from now when we know more about the long term effects we can start comparing it to other viruses.
2823,"It's definitely partly a function of time, but the current prevalence of delta in most EU countries is so low now that the virus doesn't have that time."
2824,"Germany (the head of the pack) is at 0.8 doses/person for the population, and upping that by about 0.01 per day."
2825,They're something like a month out from the 1-1.2 doses per population that ended the pandemic in Israel (where there has not been any delta spread since).
2826,"Additionally, most of the EU is using almost entirely mRNA vaccines."
2827,"Over half of the UK's vaccines are AZ, which might have substantially weaker sterilizing immunity."
2828,"The situation in America is rather different, with much of the country well beyond the vaccination point needed to end the pandemic."
2829,But there are absolutely highly populous places that are not there.
2830,"In both the US and Europe though, summer is bringing lower reproductive rates overall, and if there are holes in vaccination population protection we might not see them until fall."

2833,Republican/Lean Republican ≠ Neoconservative.
2834,Wait I thought Delta was ravaging the country
2835,Epidemiologists feel it will be around 30 years before Covid will be as prevalent as a bad flu season.
2836,We won't see that sort of trickle for decades.
2837,"Well, it's like this."
2838,"You can get immunity the easy way, or the hard way."
2839,I guess I'm just lazy.
2840,Definitely not.
2841,A strong immune system might freak out and give you side effects when confronted with a new antigen.
2842,But an even stronger immune system might deal with it without freaking out.
2843,It’s been quite some time since I took sociology in college.
2844,"However, I do remember that the general breakdown was 

Under 18: Adolescents

18 - 40: Young adult 

40 - 60: Middle age

60+: Seniors"
2845,The government wants to do this because only pfizer is approved for under-15s and they just got enough moderna doses to end the pandemic by early July - if you can get them all into arms.
2846,"But since most people have already gotten a first dose, this means just shoving moderna in as the second dose."
2847,"As for safety, there's no reason going in to expect any safety issues, and there have been no safety issues found in anyone who's been given mixed doses."
2848,"We'd actually expect from previous vaccines mixing doses to give a better result, and in particular to give a smaller dose first with a bigger dose second to be ideal."
2849,"However, we also would expect (and have some evidence for) that waiting longer between doses gives a better result, so waiting until you can get pfizer is whatever."
2850,"Please don't take this as anti-Biden or Pro-Trump, but I see this sentiment a lot, and I'm not really sure what the Biden administration did that really any other administration (even the Trump one) wouldn't have done."
2851,"Like, I think the drug companies did a great job."
2852,State run and pharmacy run vaccine clinics did a good job.
2853,"We bought a bunch of vaccine doses, but I feel like that is sort of a given."
2854,The federal vaccine pods were kind of a bust (I don't blame them for trying).
2855,"But really, I just don't see a grand, amazing strategy that was rolled out."
2856,"I see amazing, highly effective vaccines."
2857,no you’re not good you’re still supposed to get vaccinated
2858,"Still not the flu, but yeah the more vaccinations the better."
2859,🥳
2860,I'm facing a dilemma regarding the vaccines.
2861,Soon I'll travel to Germany for my studies and I haven't get vaccinated yet.
2862,"However, my home country offers Pfizer vaccines to my age group right now."
2863,Do you think it's wise to take the first dose here and later try to get my second dose in Germany?
2864,As far as I'm informed it's unlikely for me to get vaccinated soon in the city I'm going as the demand is so high.
2865,I can probably get the vaccine there in late summer.
2866,The only downside I can see is my first dose not getting recognized and I either have to go on without the official certificate (which would defeat the secondary purposes of getting vaccinated for me) or get a third dose.
2867,"So my questions are: Should one get vaccinated asap even if it's gonna be only first dose for some time (like 2 months at most, probably) and is it harmful to get a third dose so close after the second?"
2868,I'm inclined towards getting it now because I want at least some protection while traveling.
2869,&gt; Wait for multivalent mRNA boosters if you really feel that you need additional protection.
2870,"I think this should be the go-to answer, tbh."

3016,Actually Trump said the pandemic was over a couple months in.
3017,So it must be true!

3019,The school thing is extra frustrating because none of the kids under 12 are even eligible for the vaccine yet and now they’re inside small classrooms without masks.
3020,They can’t even be six feet apart with the desks.
3021,There is Delta and Delta+.
3022,I'm just waiting for Delta Super+.
3023,It’s a much bigger and noticeable inconvenience if you were a casual worker in an industry that was fucked by the restrictions but was picked as a loser by our picking-winners-and-losers government.
3024,Do whatever you're comfortable with.
3025,After my second shot I went running the following day with a sore arm and then played VR for hours swinging my arms around.

3031,Thanks!
3032,Vaccine symptoms are gone but my anxiety about the vaccine led to a pretty big bout of gastritis that I'm dealing with now.
3033,The mind is an impressive thing.
3034,"It's all a democrat hoax, remember?"
3035,"&gt; It's only a matter of time before it mutates further and makes our current vaccines ineffective, so how do we combat this?"
3036,This is not necessarily true.
3037,The spike protein is what attaches to our cells.
3038,It is also what is targeted by the vaccines.
3039,It needs to change enough to evade the vaccines but little enough to latch on to the lining of our respiratory tract.
3040,It is not a foregone conclusion that it will be possible to completely evade the vaccine while still being able to do its thing.
3041,"On top of that, even if the above is possible, it will likely be through a series of successive mutations, which will take time."
3042,Pfizer has said it can have boosters ready in 100 days.
3043,So we should be able to boost against the variants anyways.
3044,"I support the vaccine, and anyone that doesn’t get it is a fool but oh my god I am sick of seeing this comment everywhere it’s the simplest thing and yet it annoys me so much"

3050,I’m open to hearing y’all out despite the hostility and attacks from most of you.
3051,Went to costco today and hundreds of people were in there without masks.
3052,Probably 50%.
3053,"In a county where covid hospitalizations are increasing, not decreasing."
3054,It's extremely obvious who is choosing to not wear masks and it has nothing to do with vaccination status.

3059,"Its easy for young adults to listen to all the anti-vaxxers around them whether it be from work, parents, friends, even just hearing about how its ""going to give us cancer"" online sways young minds."

3068,"And a protein subunit vaccine, similar (though probably lower dose) than novavax."
3069,"These should also be easier to update for new variants, but novavax's original dropped off very substantially (96-&gt;60%) from Classic to Beta."
3070,Its just the numbers.
3071,"If you have 7,000 -10,000 getting cancer per day, then cancer is not ""over""."
3072,Its not over just because one wants it to be.
3073,and even the best pfizer is down to 96% for hospitalization.....against the Delta variant...meaning 4% will be hospitalized.
3074,That is not nothing.
3075,"That is even with the best vaccine, we have some 35% not even vaccinated who don't want the vaccine or even outright refuse it."
3076,"It is still way too many thus they will be stuffing hospitals, and even vaccinated will be coming down with it, and getting hospitalized (about 4%) and yes...some will die..even vaccinated."
3077,"Its just a long way from being over and I am sorry people want to be done with it, but...its gonna be a while to truly be ""over""."
3078,"We can enjoy a few months of warm weather but when it gets cold again the virus will be surging in the un-vaccinated populations, of which we have entire states that are nowhere near herd immunity."

3086,"Since they figure 1/3 of the country has already been infected, wouldn't surprise me if half or more of that 25M don't already have natural immunity."
3087,And the rest are standing in the front of the line.

3089,I'm in Maine where we're about 75% vaccinated (over age 12) and next door to other states that are also well-vaccinated (Vermont is over 80% now).
3090,We're completely back to normal with no restrictions.
3091,"Even with a large number of tourists coming in (they're supposed to quarantine and wear masks if not vaccinated, but no one checks), we've had no increase in cases and no recent deaths."
3092,We followed CDC guidelines which are that fully vaccinated people can gather as they like.

3109,80% of Australians haven't even had their first dose.

3122,I think Doug Ford is also partially responsible for Trudeau keeping the borders closed for as long as they have been.
3123,You have people like him saying that there aren't enough border restrictions and that the the variants are coming in from out of the country.
3124,Ford and other Conservatives would be all over Trudeau if he opens the border too early and a causes a fourth wave.
3125,This has to be trolling.

3341,And how many people do you think die from other things like old age or other illnesses?
3342,Im betting a lot more than 300.
3343,"i always thought of it as 

18-29 young adult

30-39 adult 

40-59 middle age

60-84 elderly 

85+ mega old"
3344,Americans are fucking stupid as fuck.
3345,I can say that because I'm an American
3346,"&gt;If the people stop fighting for one minute, it lets the junta catch their breath."
3347,And I'm sure the virus won't let *anyone* catch their breath.
3348,"&gt;And the more of these scumbag junta to die of covid the better imo

And I suppose the civilians don't die?"
3349,Myanmar simply stopped reporting COVID number due to the public health departments basically walked out and not working.
3350,"Right now, the positive rate of tests is about 8% for 15th June 2021 data (ourworldindata numbers)."
3351,It's not a small number.
3352,India was at this rate early June; right now India is at 4.5%.

3358,Yup.
3359,What mystical fairy land do you live in that's had zero death in 2021?
3360,"Do you mean 0 covid deaths, 0 preventable human death, or 0 death in general?"
3361,"Because this post is about covid, your first sentence is about preventable human death, and your sign off just says ""deaths"" without specifying, so it's a little confusing."
3362,"While I feel like I should be worried, hasn’t WHO consistently said something, then walked back their statement, or just completely reversed their previous statements for like the entirety of COVID?"

3364,It's about mask mandates AND allowing indoor dining with masks.
3365,It's two separate studies with two separate sets of data.
3366,"""During the study period, states allowed restaurants to reopen for on-premises dining in 3,076 (97.9%) ""

Why would they be studying masks in restaurants when they weren't even open?"
3367,"""Mandating masks was associated with a decrease in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation."
3368,"Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with an increase in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41–100 days after implementation and an increase in daily death growth rates 61–100 days after implementation."""
3369,The decrease in Covid infections is less than 2% as cited in the rest of the article.
3370,Covid19 acquired overseas.. died in Australian hospital
3371,jusy FYI friend got it twice and now has significant lung damage.
3372,you should get vaccinated if the infection was 3 or more months ago.

3376,"The question now is how is humanity going to stop making stupid mistakes that allow variant strains to continue to emerge before, what has been released or is being tested to be released, becomes utterly useless."
3377,Putting us right back to square one.
3378,That's being very optimistic too.
3379,The only reason you hear about these variants is because they've mutated enough to possibly be or are a serious concern.
3380,We are still somewhat slow to find them before they start trying to take over a region(s).
3381,There are still large quantities of the world with extremely dense populations and areas that are not fully vaccinated.
3382,These variants thrive in those areas.
3383,"We already saw a variant emerge that started having 
 a resistance to the antibodies from survivors in less than a year."
3384,That was with just a few variants (from the original strain) running around.
3385,"If you don't think, with our current actions &amp; choices,  that it could easily do that (or worse) again."
3386,There's something wrong with you.

The vaccine doesn't turn us into immune demigods."

3392,"Generally people with organ transplants, or who are going through chemo, or on certain immune-suppressants(not all of them, my dad has an autoimmune disease but his treatment is so targeted that he's not someone that has to worry as hard as other folks)."
3393,"Think there's some protocol for the latter two that involves people waiting in between treatment courses, but it's still very much a worry and people who are severely immunocompromised are very much relying on herd immunity to get back to their life."

3398,That’s only a concern for third world countries.
3399,Only happened because hospitals did not sterilize ventilators properly
3400,That's not from covid.
3401,"That's from going into overwhelmed, unsanitary hospitals with a weakened immune system(often even further weakened by treatment from steroids for the covid itself)."
3402,"That's existed before covid, and is one of many hospital-acquired infections that covid patients can be vulnerable to."
3403,"I think a lot of the issue here, is that a lot of people would prefer to have a longer period of testing, and would like to know the differences, health wise, between traditional vaccines and mRNA vaccines."
3404,"It’s not so much about being anti-vaccine, it’s more so certain people would like to have all the information presented to them, and have studies that go for a couple of years at least before putting something in their body."
3405,"It’s all about proper education, and if the U.S did a better job educating the public on vaccines, and presented a narrative that was neither leaning towards or against something, people would be more willing."

COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms approached another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated."
3472,"The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

3474,"CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer’s disease than from COVID-19."
3475,"The U.S. death toll stands at more than 600,000, while the worldwide count is close to 3.9 million, though the real figures in both cases are believed to markedly higher."

3630,"Thanks to the well-established cooperation with the company, the contract also guarantees timely delivery from the third quarter of 2021 to end 2022 and the possibility to adapt it to the needs of each Member State depending on their epidemiological situation."
3631,"Member States have the possibility to resell or donate doses to countries in need outside the EU or through the COVAX Facility, contributing to a global and fair access to vaccines across the world."""

3811,I agree with a good chunk of this except the cost rationalisation as I’m sure the cost of vaccinating everyone has already been set aside.
3812,"And I was locked in my house (with the exception of the grocery store, once a day, within 5km of home) for over six months in total so far, so while I understand and sympathise with your point, I don’t think it’s unreasonable nor impossible."
3813,You’re right that it has other unintended consequences as most all of us that went through that struggled on the mental side.
3814,What’s the argument and claim?
3815,Because it seems a bit ambiguous.
3816,I’d say a non-biased expert/group of experts in field of study that can easily denounce the Misinformation that has a say in the what happens to the person.

3829,Why is this getting downvoted
3830,Agreed.
3831,That was a really nice summation.
3832,Now we just need an active government to help realign the capitalist incentives to both encourage continued innovation while evening the cruelty and failures of the current healthcare system to provide adequate healthcare to our neediest citizens (which will be most of us at some point in our lives).
3833,A more transmissible variant runs out of dry tinder faster
3834,"got it ty, I couldn't find anything on google it just kept telling me about the current vaccine and how effective it is against delta lol, gotta get better at my searches or something"
3835,Really?
3836,Aren't they the highest risk?
3837,What would be the point of them increasing their risk of getting terminally ill?
3838,"1 variants make the vaccines less effective meaning a lot of people are still at risk, just not as high."
3839,2 No symptoms means no hospital stay and less transmission of said disease due to less viral expulsion.
3840,3 If you have no way to disinfect your hands to remove your mask it’s better to leave it on till you do.

3868,The sources that can dispute the claim with heavy evidence.
3869,"Oh absolutely, but that doesn’t really exist to begin with."
3870,There’s already heavy involvement of the government in our healthcare system so you can’t really blame the deficiencies on pure capitalism.
3871,Because we don’t experience a pure capitalist system when someone says that capitalism in our healthcare system is causing death what they are suggesting is that the part of the system that is capitalist is what is failing - which I would say is debatable.
3872,The part of our system that is failing is the inadequate government regulations and controls.
3873,"We tend to see that as a capitalist problem because the party that sells itself as more capitalist (GOP) is the cause of failure, but that’s not the result of capitalism but rather the result of corruption and lazy GOP bureaucrats who don’t advocate for smart healthcare policy but rather use their time in power to fuck up the system and give handouts/contracts to their friends."
3874,I feel like it will operate the way it has been operating so far - individual institutions and workplaces will mandate their employees must be vaccinated.

3997,"And there has been a lot of fear mongering in the media, so some people who can get it are avoiding it."
3998,I think the big issue is that Australia has much lower rates of covid than the rest of the world.
3999,It means a lot of people feel like there is no rush to be vaccinated and they can wait for pfizer.
4000,"Unfortunately, last week an outbreak of the delta variant was started with an airport worker who was over 50 and completely unvaccinated, so this risk is higher than people think."
4001,There was still priority groups and people can’t jump the queue by paying for it.
4002,The private hospitals still had to follow the same schedules set by the government.
4003,"But for a brief time for my age group in my city, the availability of jabs in private hospitals was better as their procurement was independent of that of the government."
4004,It’s similar to how some states/cities have more availability than some other state/city/village which is a common issue in most other countries as well.
4005,"Give my fellow Missourians some time, we will get those numbers back up for you all /S"

4009,"As Jacobolus pointed out above, anti-vax and vax resistant folks are concentrated in some areas and not in others."
4010,"On June 14th, Vermont reached the goal of getting at least the first shot into 80% of the State population."
4011,"In contrast, in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Wyoming less than 50% of the population has had a first shot."
4012,Within those States there is also variation by County.
4013,Numerous Mississippi counties have &lt;30% of residents vaccinated.
4014,"Those counties are vulnerable to outbreaks, particularly from the Delta strain."
4015,"&gt; As I understand this is similar to other countries- for example UK endorse mix and match for such situation as limited supply in late December last year, (promoting this alarmist piece from Nytimes)

The ""limited supply"" caveat should apply to everyone who got Pfizer now too - since they got over 7 million Moderna doses delivered this week and most of Canada has had a first dose, many of those need to be given away to those who had Pfizer or AZ first doses (or just go to COVAX)."
4016,But I believe this is then up to the provincial health departments?
4017,"&gt; So basically Canada is not the only one currently allowing heterologous ""mix-match"" but overall the approach is good and logical."
4018,Makes sense.
4019,"I feel like the trials are probably key to establishing efficacy of mix-and-match, but the data directly from health departments is where the more important safety concerns need to be answered."

4022,Aren’t fully vaccinated people still dying from this variant?
4023,You should definitely tell your in laws and they should definitely test.
4024,Who knows who else they may have possibly exposed?
4025,&gt;Pfizer has said it can have boosters ready in 100 days.
4026,So we should be able to boost against the variants anyways.
4027,My issue with that is the time it would take to distribute and re-vaccinate the world population again if it came to that.
4028,Pfizer had their current vaccine ready for distribution in December 2020 and here in NZ we won't be getting doses for any of the general public until August and my age group is scheduled for October at earliest.
4029,If we needed a whole new jab that could mean another year in pandemic isolation with the borders closed.
4030,"Yes, these people probably should not bring their kids to stores or take their kids to restaurants."
4031,Their kids should also continue to wear masks.
4032,"All of these things, in my view, are relatively minor."
4033,"The main point that I was making is that, in the US at least, it has become largely an individual risk assessment, and for many people that assessment will rightly be to return to ""normal."""
4034,"“Of these, 527 were unvaccinated and only 84 of the 806 had received both doses - although it is unclear how long it had been since their second dose, as it takes a couple of weeks to build up protection.”

It is unclear how long it had been since their second dose."
4035,Big data point missing here.
4036,"If they got their second dose &lt; 14 days before they are not really

4037,At some point the supply of lungs will run out
4038,Flu deaths are accepted as completely normal and very rare.
4039,"If COVID deaths are lower than that, it says it's past the time to panic and instead time to relax a bit."
4040,How will that help?
4041,Australia had 1000 deaths.
4042,Nice try.
4043,"There’s still MIS-C to be concerned about, at the very least."
4044,And more aggressive variants developing all the time.
4045,Just because most kids are okay doesn’t mean all kids.
4046,I’d rather take extra precautions and know I’ve done everything possible to keep my children safe.
4047,"Cases are down 10% the past 14 days, and because our vaccination rates are solid in CA, it we see any kind of increase, I don’t think we will see exponential growth, and will flatten pretty quickly."
4048,The virus is running out of places to go.
4049,Wasn't it doubling every 20/25 days when it started?
4050,"Yes, but supporting all the *people* who depend on tourism?"

4053,"These people are so obsessed with this idea of their selfish desires override everyone else's well being and safety (what they think ""freedom"" means), many seem to intentionally seek to be at odds with the larger community for the hell of it or to score points with other similar minded jerks."

4073,"&gt;Considering the WHO doesn’t recommend the vaccine for those under 18, it is somewhat understandable  
             
Young adults age 18 to 39 clearly are age 18 or over, and the WHO webpage in your link clearly states in the eighth paragraph that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people age 18 years and older:  
             
""The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders."
4074,"These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled."""
4075,I'm just like you!
4076,"Well, I already had fatigue, concentration, and digestive issues pre-2020, but I don't want to be the reason someone *else* ends up disabled for months or even for life."

4088,"I'm so happy to read this, I hope that this horror in India will soon be over."
4089,"A question for you, in the US there are so many people who refuse to be vaccinated that we likely won't reach herd immunity."
4090,Do you think there are many people in India who will refuse vaccination?
4091,I wish all the vaccines being refused in the US could be shipped to India.
4092,Same reason people don't take the flu shot every year: They think the risks that come with possibly getting vaccine side effects outweigh the risks of actually getting the virus.

4094,I was shocked that throughout the pandemic we've had meager studies on the actual efficacy of masks in the real world.
4095,A cloth mask or a BFE 98% surgical mask - both are just considered 'face coverings' in studies.
4096,Occasionally they make distinctions for N95 (which are often poorly QC'ed KN95).
4097,The whole thing was immensely frustrating and totally lacking in any real scientific rigor.
4098,To a point.
4099,There are a limited number of mutations that can be stumbled upon by the virus that will be both advantageous for spread and evasion of neutralization by vaccines or immunity from prior infection.
4100,"We need to tamp down on the numbers as quickly as possible, but there is a finite amount of alterations that can be made to the spike before it ceases to function as a virus."
4101,"Oh nonono, full credit completely goes to the other 5 people."
4102,I paid into a Go Fund Me for a doctor who died in the US to help pay for funeral costs.
4103,I don't think she was even born until after I started medical school either.

4508,I'm a foreigner in Russia and I was vaccinated with sputnik as soon as it was available.

4510,I would take any of them offered.

4517,That’s generous.
4518,I say by August we’re fucked again.
4519,[removed]
4520,The lockdown during the first wave was even more strict that Europe or North America.
4521,Everything was shut and police were stopping anyone who moved.
4522,There was an electronic 'pass' system and anyone outside without a pass was fined.
4523,"Once the sputnik vaccine was available though, the government seems to have backed off any attempt at restrictions."
4524,Even the recent restrictions are only 'mildly' enforced.
4525,Aye.
4526,"Definitely get vaccinated, but I'd caution the use of this data to say its just a flu."
4527,"Even mild cases result in brain damage:

So you probably want to avoid this virus even if you are fully vaccinated."
4528,Weird title.
4529,"The guy's uniform says охрана (security), I don't think that qualifies as a ""prankster."""
4530,"Mild cases can still cause brain damage

May warrant investigation before celebration."
4531,so then what do we do?
4532,lockdown for another year?
4533,"I’m not trying to be flippant, I’m genuinely curious what the alternative is."
4534,My wife and I staggered it.
4535,Even though I did J&amp;J and she Pfizer we accounted for the schedules and any potential downtime.
4536,"Even if you get Covid and don’t die or end up in the hospital unless you’re asymptomatic you’re likely to have some downtime from that as well, likely more so than the vaccine."
4537,I wonder what this means for mild cases among the the vaccinated?
4538,"Because if vaccines still don't protect you against brain damage, then we should be lock downing tie sh!t out of the virus."
4539,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01059-y
4540,It has just burned itself out
4541,Most people in most countries won't care what type of government runs the country as long as it keeps out of sight and doesn't interfere with their daily lives.
4542,"Governments should take care of keeping the roads in passable state, remove the garbage and do some basic policing."
4543,Anything else is seen as authoritarian.
4544,This was the mistake of the Soviet Union and satellite states.
4545,The amount of BS the people had to endure daily made them very unpopular.
4546,This is also the reason why so many people oppose and dislike covid related rules.
4547,Who the fuck is the government to tell me what to wear on my face?
4548,Or how many people should I meet?
4549,It's dictatorial
4550,Well that’s not a very good sample at all.
4551,"America’s biggest spike was in January, when nobody was vaccinated."
4552,And that probably makes up at least half of that ‘99.75%’.
4553,They need a sample from the last month or something
4554,"And I gotta say, the x-ray vision is awesome"
4555,This is extremely American-centric.
4556,"You know the delta variant didn’t mutate in unvaccinated Americans, right?"
4557,"It was from India, when they only had a couple of percent vaccinated."
4558,Variants from poor unvaccinated countries are 100x more likely to harm Americans in the long run
4559,How else were they going to show off their new Botox injections?
4560,!
4561,Yup.
4562,Remember how it just went away after the election?
4563,Good times.
4564,Ever heard of Northern Ireland?
4565,"Given that it’s been around for months, especially its time in the UK, we absolutely would have heard if kids were more at risk than before."

4611,I will do my best to avoid any of their products moving forward because of their negligence during this crisis.
4612,I already disliked them immensely because of the talc powder scandal.
4613,Our population is roughly 20% of the USA's.
4614,"Our current 7-day average is 10, and it dipped to a low of 6 before Delta became an issue."
4615,So equivalent of 50 and 30 in the USA respectively.
4616,We’ve already had multiple waves and covid is a way less damaging than the Spanish flu

4656,We don’t have any evidence yet that this variant has worse outcomes for kids than other variants.
4657,I know everybody wants to do right by their kids but the numbers don’t lie: covid is not particularly dangerous to children.
4658,"In total, 322 kids (17 and younger) have died from covid in the US."
4659,That’s out of 74 million kids.
4660,The odds of your kid dying from covid are extremely small.
4661,"It’s comparable to the odds of dying from pneumonia or influenza, two diseases you probably never lost sleep over before."
4662,"Yes of course there are other poor health outcomes besides death for covid but the same is true of pneumonia and flu, and again, you probably never lost sleep over those."
4663,Humans are bad at analyzing risk.
4664,Covid is literally tens of thousands of times more dangerous for the very old than it is for kids.
4665,We all have to take a deep breath and recognize that covid just isn’t a serious threat for children.

4667,"No, at that time only 45+ were allowed vaccines, theyre all in mid thirties"

4694,The chances of this happening were very low.
4695,I know a lot of young people who don't get the flu shot either.

4701,"Oddly, our numbers started plummeting right after the removal of mask mandates - long before we had that many who had received injections."
4702,It initially seemed anomalous to many of us and seems like it could be a one-off.
4703,The intellectually challenging part is that Texas is a pretty large sample size.

4743,45-60% of my in-law’s church has had covid (they got it by acting like full on morons) then the smarter people like my in-laws (probably 25-30%) stayed away until they were vaccinated and have now returned.
4744,"I wouldn’t be surprised if some congregations, even with low vaccination rates are experiencing higher levels of herd immunity than people think."
4745,Family caregivers weren't allowed to take care of their relatives in care homes.
4746,Institutions can't be trusted to take care of vulnerable people cause they're a revolving door of people coming and going.

4751,"The government kidnapped children from their parents, threw them to a bunch of strangers without their parents being allowed to see them, and mistreatment resulted."
4752,Then there's people who couldn't get medical tests or procedures done.
4753,The list can probably go on.
4754,What’s the difference between heard immunity and sort-of heard immunity.
4755,Has there been a study to show heard immunity is possible with mRNA vaccines?
4756,(Serious question cuz I’ve been seeking the data for a bit)
4757,Because whether or not Christianity is true is not contingent on American adherents in the year 2021 being morons about vaccination
4758,"When England sends its people, they aren't sending their best..."
4759,This happened at my work except it was the opposite.
4760,Almost all of us are vaccinated except for 1 stupid guy who gives vague reasons for not wanting to do it.
4761,He was the most unsafe through this whole thing and somehow avoided COVID while the rest of us got sick.
4762,"BUT, a few weeks ago, while vaccines had been widely available this whole time, he got sick."
4763,I was in his small office for over an hour with him while he was symptomatic.
4764,He tested positive the next day.
4765,Nobody got sick except for him and one other unvaccinated employee.
4766,"Many of us were in his office while he was actually symptomatic with sore throat, coughing etc ""allergies"" lol."
4767,"Cases have dropped 35% over the last 3 weeks, so if death drops accordingly there would be 200 average daily deaths in 3 weeks from now."
4768,"Their bet is that they won't go below 100, so they have quite some margin still."
4769,Personally I also think it is quite likely that the average won't go below 100 in 2021.
4770,Even the churches in the northeast tend to be more pro-science than elsewhere in the country.
4771,"The church I attend in NJ didn't physically reopen (basically was fully online-only) until August, and then only with extreme restrictions, and didn't drop the mask mandate until last week, about a month after the state government did."

4773,Thank you.
4774,Eric Ding is a professional fearmonger and the king of cherry-picking data to arrive at the scariest conclusions.
4775,"Not disputing your statement, but I fail to understand how can anyone think that feeling mildly sick for 1-2 days with each shot (which is not a given, I have seen people who only got sick with one or none) is going to be better than the actual sickness."
4776,"If someone gets sick, there's a good chance it will force you to be off work for days or weeks and could drown you in medical bills!"
4777,"Even if you are asymptomatic, if anyone finds out or realizes that you are sick you could be fired or forced to get sick leave..."
4778,I fail to understand the logic of some people.
4779,"Okay, let’s aim for zero in every country."
4780,Nobody can do anything for 3 years.

&gt; • the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 92% effective against hospitalisation after 2 doses

&gt; These are comparable with vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation from the Alpha variant."

4846,&gt;The hospitals are already diverting patients and some only have 40% of nursing staff vaccinated.
4847,There’s a major urban and rural divide in current case spread so the state appears level but the areas without hospitals are seeing high increases.
4848,In the next 2 weeks I’ll bet the graph is up across the state.
4849,The cities have too low of vaccination rates too.
4850,I'll take that bet.

4852,"Testing for years is normally what we do, but the stakes are raised when thousands are dying everyday."
4853,"Also, the data on the vaccines looks really great, so why wouldn't they ""present a narrative"" where they encourage uptake?"
4854,"Also, I think it is reasonable for people to want to understand the vaccines better, but if I'm honest I don't think a desire to learn more is what is going on here."
4855,"Everyone I know who didn't get vaccinated want nothing to do with it, aggressively so."
4856,"They aren't waiting on data, they won't get this vaccine in 10 years if the data still looks great."
4857,The problem is something else.

4863,Did they test positive for irony too?
4864,Biden has no authority to shut down anything but the borders.
4865,Everything else is state’s responsibility!
4866,This could also include those medically unable to receive the vaccine.

4874,"Cases are falling so quickly in Germany that I think the vaccines might outcompete a Delta resurgence, cases more than halved in the last week for instance."
4875,"How was I clearly talking about cases when I all I said was, ""Every state in the south, outside of Arkansas, is flat or showing a decrease.""?"
4876,That's obviously not clear as both cases AND hospitalizations have decreased.
4877,You got caught and now you're reaching.
4878,The article implied that states in the south are showing a rebound in cases/hospitalizations.
4879,That is not true at all and it's irresponsible reporting.
4880,I got a sudden urge to buy an Xbox series x and Microsoft 365.

4894,Don't go bragging.
4895,It isn't over yet.
4896,Absolutely not
4897,Does the fact that Pfizer is given to younger and younger pop vs AZ in older pop matter?
4898,I’m in my forties and when I was younger my dad worked in different parts of Asia and I visited him whenever possible and I had a vaccine passport that I had to present at immigration.
4899,Depending on where I was flying from/to I had to get different vaccines.
4900,And we all knew that vaccination isn’t foolproof so we were all careful.
4901,Surprised to see people against vaccinations these days…
4902,My biggest worry is just that it'll mutate into something that IS harmful for kids.
4903,It was basically a miracle that this didn't affect infants very badly.
4904,I don't have a good sense of why it doesn't affect children worse or how likely that sort of mutation might be.
4905,"And yeah, in Texas and super pissed that Abbott has neutered the use of masks in schools (schools aren't allowed to require it, so of course the families that are most resistant to covid prevention, vaccines, etc aren't going to use them)."
4906,Regardless of relative risks for kids that was a unnecessary butt-head move.
4907,Reasonable.
4908,"Figure this too: the more we are collectively exposed to the virus, the less it is “novel.” So, past infection or vaccination is good."
4909,Minor infection (think young people) is good for society as well.
4910,"Yes, and it is on its way, doubling every 10-11 days."
4911,Think its due to scotland having the lowest infections per pop out of the home countries.
4912,Hi.
4913,"To clarify - you do not “need both doses to be effective against the variants” but both doses confer the highest protection against the sars-cov-2 virus, including the variants."
4914,One dose confers some protection.
4915,Both doses confers more.
4916,Cuba rocks
4917,"inactivated is easy to update, no?"
4918,"just need to change the virus seed that need to be cultured..
  
viral vector works quite the same way with mRNA that they send the genetic code of the spike protein so our cells create the spike protein.. so they should be on similar difficulty..
  
there is a reason why the firsts covid vaccines to be developed are viral vector, mRNA, and inactivated.."

4929,Our only hope with the climate is that enough tech innovations occur that people accidentally contribute to the solution while they buy new shiny things.

4954,A bottle of beer doesn't do enough damage to destroy your ability to taste and smell.
4955,Some long covid patients have not recovered their ability to smell and maybe they never will.
4956,&gt;  The low risk of a blood clot is definitely scary but you have more chances of dying from covid than the blood clot.
4957,Except in the case of Australia the chance of getting covid skews the equation.
4958,The AZ vaccine has caused more deaths than covid this year.
4959,"If Australia had cases like India then for sure, take AZ (or any other proven vaccine) asap."
4960,Sign me up!
4961,There’s a couple of things confounding a clear picture in the states.
4962,Doctors aren’t really testing (several anecdotal examples on the thread as well as my own experience with a family member) nor genetic sequencing even though we have TONS of capacity for both.
4963,"With several studies showing vaccines are ~20% less effective in preventing disease with the delta variant and no surveillance to speak of in the states to track delta or delta plus spreading, I’d contest the unbridled optimism we saw in the thread a few months ago where any suggestion that variants could be a concern was downvoted into oblivion is getting a healthy rebalance."

4965, won't be long until its vax or gulag !
4966,His luck might run out with delta.
4967,I wonder how the coming winter will be when everyone is cooped up in houses.
4968,I mean for the un-vaxed people.
4969,We may even have to get a booster shot in the fall possibly and these people have not even taken the first step.
4970,"Scientists, doctors, health administrators, etc."
4971,"You know, the people who have added decades to first world life expectancies by greatly reducing diseases over the past generation or two."
4972,What makes you think the medical community aren't doing everything they can to protect these people?
4973,"Also regarding herd immunity, in Wales 90% of adults now have their first dose."
4974,So herd immunity seems to be acheivable even in democracies.
4975,It’s not unreasonable to want proper FDA approval.
4976,"Especially when it comes to young people, who are (generally) at less risk of death, as you rightly point out."
4977," bats wings, dog leg , frogs legs and a sprinkle of tiger claw dust."
4978,I love how Cuba is doing just fine even though they are practically left  on their own will.
4979,Wishing them well there.
4980,And getting a shot magically makes their long-COVID go away.
4981,"I already had Pfizer, but sign me up for this one as well"
4982,"That's cool, but the 100 numbers was irrelevant to the conversation since we were talking about heading to 200 and about short term continued drops in deaths."
4983,There was not one person saying we're about to go under 100 deaths.
4984,Vaccinated &gt; unvaccinated
4985,"Wow, this is amazing."
4986,I hope it takes off
4987,"Just let them die, if people want to be stupid so be it."

4993,&gt; Use your brain for a second.
4994,"Take your own advice there, bud."
4995,The liquid explosive threat was pretty much debunked immediately after the liquid restrictions were scrambled into place.
4996,"The realistic chance of someone building a liquid bomb on board a plane, or of hijacking a plane using small cutting objects, is pretty much non-existent."
4997,TSA safety measures have been overbearing and reactive for going on two decades now.

4999,"If nothing else, follow the money trail between the security checkpoint nude-o-scope scanners and the former homeland security chairman."
5000,Good to hear your experience was nothing like mine.
5001,Glad you are ok.  Take care and be safe.
5002,Viruses tend to become more contagious and less deadly over time.
5003,The UK data suggests this is the case with the Delta variant.
5004,"Cases are up, mortalities are flat."
5005,I would consider it a waste of a test.

5011,"Science has delivered … a safe, effective vaccine."
5012,"The government has delivered … the vaccine is available, and free."
5013,There are many countries in the world that are not so lucky and are being ravaged by COVID right now.
5014,But in the US people are snubbing the vaccine by the millions.
5015,What are we doing wrong?
5016,"I think they said this employee is the only one exposed who was vaccinated, and the outbreak was across 2 departments."
5017,So shouldn’t that mean that there is a total of only 1 vaccinated employee across (at least) 2 departments?
5018,Or am I understanding that wrongly.
5019,What?
5020,"The thing is, this still doesn't concern me greatly."
5021,The current vaccines were developed just weeks after the virus appeared; what took months and months was proving they're safe and effective.
5022,"Now that we've proven that, I'd expect boosters to come out *much* more quickly should a vaccine-escaping variant arise."
5023,See: the flu vaccine.
5024,We're able to crank out a new one each year with minimal testing because the prior body of research shows that the methods used will produce a safe vaccine that likely offers at least some protection from the current strains.
5025,You have school in August?
5026,Isn't the Australian government forbidding incoming flights?
5027,Even to stranded Australian citizens?
5028,That is so dystopian and ridiculous I don't even know where to begin.
5029,America is open and we're living like normal again.

5031,"Just because there are the fortunate many doesn't mean we shouldn't be thinking of the unlucky few, especially because covid is so contagious that the unlucky few is still a shitload of people"
5032,I'm not sure why you are worried.

5040,"He has been going to church, work, everywhere unmasked and proud of it."
5041,He has a disabled wife at home.
5042,He hasn't been online in a few days; I hope they are both okay but they are pretty much sitting ducks at this point.
5043,"I feel bad for his wife who even if she wanted to get the vaccine, he wouldn't let her and would block access to it."

5051,"You do understand the concept of 'two weeks to slow the spread', right?"
5052,"Yeah, pretty much."
5053,You might phrase the English slightly differently but you've got the gist of it nicely.
5054,"The study pointed to possible preexisting immunity from other coronaviruses, not just sars."
5055,"Remember, Covid was supposed to be a novel virus with no preexisting immunity."
5056,Yet there was a strong t-cell response from people who only had sars previously not Covid.
5057,I linked the study in my other comment.
5058,"If it were trending up, then cases would be increasing, not decreasing."
5059,"The daily case rate is currently averaging 11,822."
5060,"It was 27,585 on May 21, and 65,619 on April 21."
5061,Every single day is seeing our daily average fall.
5062,"If the R0 was greater than 1.0, that would not be the case."
5063,Ideally we would want that on a world-wide scale to allow for the complete eradication of the virus.
5064,Going out for essentials?
5065,"lol

I'm sure they're paying someone else to do the shopping for them."
5066,If you got covid that many times then it means that your immune system is insanely defective and you should see your primary doctor.
5067,I don't follow this reasoning at all.
5068,"A very common target protein for flu vaccines is hemagglutinin, which is a pretty close *functional* analog for the SARS-Cov-2 spike."
5069,"By this I mean that the subunit vaccines often primarily use HA proteins as the target epitope, and that HA is a ligand to a host cell surface receptor."
5070,"Your reasoning applied here would appear to suggest that, because the antibodies generated by flu vaccines will typically be anti-HA antibodies, and because HA acts as the direct interface between the virion and the host cell, it is therefore the case that the vaccines cannot become ineffective."
5071,"Because if HA mutates to escape antibody recognition then it would also lose its activity as a ligand, right?"
5072,"This is clearly not the case, as is demonstrated year after year."
5073,"At risk of sounding trite, evolution is smarter than we are."
5074,I know LOTS of people trying to convince their one last stubborn relative to get the vaccine.
5075,[deleted]
5076,"Damn, AZ is very low."
5077,What about AZ 1st dose &amp; Pfizer 2nd dose?
5078,"This is from the UK, which hasn’t given out any J&amp;J vaccines, that’s why it’s not in the article."
5079,"Whilst it's just been approved a few weeks ago, the UK doesn't have any JJ on hand to use."
5080,"It's much lower (by 5x or more), but deaths tend to lag cases."
5081,Unfortunately [one of these case trends is not like the other](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer\?zoomToSelection\=true\&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest\&amp;pickerSort\=desc\&amp;pickerMetric\=total_deaths\&amp;hideControls\=true\&amp;Metric\=Confirmed\+cases\&amp;Interval\=7-day\+rolling\+average\&amp;Relative\+to\+Population\=true\&amp;Align\+outbreaks\=false\&amp;country\=USA\~GBR).
5082,"The delta variant seems to be driving a resurgence in cases despite widespread vaccine deployment in the UK, which is bad news."
5083,The consolation will be if the seriousness of the cases (i.e.
5084,"hospitalizations and death) remains low, hopefully due to the vaccines."
5085,It's hard to be sure at this point.
5086,Except this is not the case in the United States.
5087,COVID numbers have been steadily declining for month after month.
5088,"Nobody on this thread is showing their work, just downvoting things that seem optimistic about our trajectory."
5089,"Some people really want to cling to the pandemic as long as possible, I think."
5090,Reading this makes me feel how lucky I am.
5091,I'm a moderately overweight dude that eats like shit whose entire Covid experience was just really bad body aches and shitting liquid death for like a week.
5092,Didn't cough once.
5093,Then again I never get sick either.
5094,I can count on one hand how many times I've had a cold in the last 7 years

5279,"Seasonality must be considered, but so must the current circumstances regarding COVID - deaths are in a steady, downward trend, with no evidence supporting a seasonality being established (yet.)"
5280,"If continued precautions outside the societal norms continue, they will require stronger justification after that point, as we already know that society in general considers even the peak of flu season - at well over 300 deaths a day -  an acceptable number of deaths and an acceptable risk of exposure without altering their daily lives."
5281,"In other words, when we hit 200 deaths a day, you will be hard pressed to convince me that I need to wear a mask or distance myself from others more than what was previously normal, especially since I have been vaccinated."
5282,"You can if you want to, but anything extra you feel compelled to do to protect yourself is on you, not me."
5283,That's probably OG - the results of the trials.
5284,There would presumably be a very small drop-off with Alpha and a slightly larger one again with Delta.

5352,"Yes, the variants of concern have become more infectious as this pandemic has progressed."
5353,"The original coronavirus was infectious with an R0 of around 2.5-3.5, so, without mitigation, each infected person on average spreads it to 2.5-3.5 other people."

5357,Think of what an R0 of around 6 means.
5358,"If your mitigations (so-so lockdown, cloth masks, etc.)"
5359,"can knock the original virus down 2/3 of transmission, so you wind up with an R of around 1 (slow burning pandemic), those same mitigations against Alpha gets you to an R of around 1.5 (much like flu), and Delta to an R of around 2 (much like unmitigated original strain)."

5482,Just don't eat yoruself up with worry over it in the meantime.
5483,Is the real benefit not likely greater 96%?
5484,"So my assumption is that if 10% of infected unvaccinated people with the delta variant go to the hospital, only 4% (and 8% of AZ) of the 10% ie."
5485,0.4% of vaccinated people go to the hospital.
5486,"But: 

* Most vaccinated people are more vulnerable so I'd expect that in the 'natural' distribution of the vaccine this is more likely to say; 10% of 30 year olds go to hospital as a result of the Delta variant and 0.4% of 80 year olds go to hospital once vaccinated."
5487,* Assuming you are less likely to catch the virus if you are vaccinated your overall chance fo catching the virus AND going to hospital is further reduced by whatever factor you have to not catch the virus.
5488,* Assuming you are more likely to live with other vaccinated people the R-factor in your environment is likely further reduced.
5489,I'm not sure if they correct for the 1st point but I'd love to see the overall benefit estimated if they did because I'd be surprised - given the current mortality rates - if this was not at least 99% less likely to be actually hospitalized no matter which vaccination you took.

5513,The way the pandemic started in Germany was indeed a bit different from the surrounding countries.
5514,We coincidentally ended up in a situation that made the statistics look good.
5515,"Covid started with a huge mass infection event (Karneval Heisberg) which accumulated the vast majority of all cases in one region that then got tested and produced a pretty reliable result of the actual infection numbers around that time, giving a realistic death rate."
5516,"Other countries were chasing after minor clusters with their testing teams, not catching the bigger part of infected people."
5517,"So their statistics showed way fewer infections than they had, but still all deaths, blowing up the death rate."
5518,Checking in from the most vaccinated city in America where outdoor masking is still 80+% on my observation
5519,I might note that I got a lot of flack and downvotes when I made a derogatory comment about Chinese vaccines...
5520,"So, are they as good as the western vaccines or not?"
5521,I think it is also showing the importance of vaccination and a reminder that if you are unvaccinated you need to be worried.
5522,100%.
5523,"And the German politicians are ""celebrating"" how ""amazing the vaccination goes"" in Germany."
5524,"Right... it was a total mess from the beginning, also how the EU didnt buy enough doses for months, and then just tried to hide their mistakes, still do."
5525,".....umm, I literally broke that down in the comment to which you responded."
5526,My second child is 14.
5527,I don’t know any of her friends that are vaccinated.
5528,"Many parents who aren’t antivax are still wary of the Covid shot, more so than Covid itself."
5529,My daughter wanted the shot because she couldn’t deal with another year of masks and quarantine.
5530,But she has zero fear of contracting Covid.
5531,"If the government really wants parents to bring their child to get the shot, the messaging has to change."
5532,“Variants” has become such an overused buzz word that it means nothing at this point.
5533,"I don’t care how much greater the chance at contracting DeltaGamaThetaPsi is, so much fear mongering has happened the past year that it’s just white noise."
5534,"If it's the study that I think it is, there were major flaws with it."
5535,"First of all, it wasn't that large."
5536,"Secondly, it was generally younger people (not retired age, etc)."
5537,"It was one hospital system and compared it to rates over the same time from the entire country, even though comparing one region to qn entire country is improper because there were different regional rates of infection."
5538,"However, yes, there have bee other studies beyond that that show it to be very effective too."
5539,"But again, the 95% number, that is the only one from gold-standard trials, was only for symptomatic COVID."

5542,"&gt; German vaccine authority

How does the German vaccine authority have any say on the american people?"
5543,Also they haven't (yet) seen the same rise in deaths.

5546,[removed]
5547,Are you sure?
5548,"The article states:

&gt;The analysis included 14,019 cases of the Delta variant – 166 of whom were hospitalised – between 12 April and 4 June, looking at emergency hospital admissions in England."
5549,I would have read from that that they tracked 14.019 cases of people testing positive to the delta variant.
5550,And positives tests are a good sample you can work from.
5551,"How would you interpolate from that to the general population, make assumptions on the likelihood of those vaccinated to catch the virus is altered not only because they would likely be surrounded by more vaccinated people than those who are not vaccinated."
5552,And if they did this why would they not state that the study was based on whatever actual vaccinated population they assumed to be the baseline that could have been infected.
5553,I genuinely don't know but would love to get some sources if you have the data leading you to the 40% value.
5554,Each new voc has appeared 6 month or so after a surge in the area it showed up in.
5555,"It is conjectured that each one evolved within a single host who couldn't fight off the virus,  though we have no real evidence."
5556,"Each one has a largely unmutated classic lineage as its parent (B.1.1, B.1, B.1.1.28 for instance), so is ""second generation""."
5557,"If the pattern holds then a set of third generation lineages will evolve in a bit,  but it's hard to know how they'll be different."
5558,"If the second generation already reached peak fitness within a single host,  maybe no next generation is possible."
5559,Or maybe viral replication rate and escape will both continue to rise.
5560,"Co-infection of two voc's within a single cell can also exchange mutations, which could accelerate the process (I would assume this is how delta+ happened)."
5561,"I dont want Laschet to become the new Bundeskanzler :( He is a total ""yea sayer"", even worse than Merkel."
5562,"Sitting things out, having no backbone."

5565,Just total joke how NRW is handling it.
5566,"Thank you, I'm working on it!"
5567,"This pandemic has been a stumbling block for me, as it has for many millions of others."
5568,Did you get your second shot?
5569,How did it go?
5570,&gt; The German Chancellor isn’t commander in chief.
5571,So it’s a different prioritization structure.
5572,That seems kind of irrelevant and is actually also kind of wrong.
5573,The Verteidigungsminister (similar to the Secretary of Defense) is commander in chief during peace time.
5574,But this power gets automatically transferred to the chancellor in case of war.
5575,And the chancellor gets to appoint and remove the Verteidigungsminister anyway.
5576,I'm glad I got the big boy moderna shot.
5577,"Everyone says Moderna is close enough you can assume, yet I don’t see any professionals “saying”  it."
5578,I don’t regret getting vaccinated but by god I would sleep easier if it was Pfizer.
5579,I don't have unvaccinated kids of my own to worry about but one of the reasons I still wear mine is because of your 6 year old.
5580,"The idea that it's all ok if it doesnt effect me is mind numbing but I'm amazed people dont get that even if you personally dont know and care about a person who isnt vaccinated, doesnt mean you arent putting people at risk."
5581,"What is the extra mutation, and what animal does that help the virus jump to?"
5582,It's not about vaccine's risk so much as it is their ability to build up an appropriate immune response to the vaccine if/when they get it.
5583,"If only one-third to one-half of them are able to mount an early immune response to the virus, there's still a large portion of those individuals who will be susceptible despite having received the vaccine."
5584,"The article I linked showed only 15% had a reasonable antibody response after one dose, and 46% had no response after two doses."

5591,So you’re saying that every single individual doctor is more important for the country’s success through the pandemic than the Prime Minister?

5593,"If you do believe that the Prime Minister is at least as important as any individual health care professional who got an early vaccine, then you must believe that health care professionals shouldn’t have gotten early vaccines in order for your logic to be internally consistent."
5594,CureVac is different from Moderna and Pfizer mrna vaccines in that the CureVac does not use pseudouridine while two other use it.

5607,You want to mix the immune and vulnerable as evenly as possible to reduce spread.
5608,2.
5609,Sure.
5610,Each new voc we've seen so far has been better at infecting young people.
5611,"Keep in mind our vaccine always reduce infections,  which can only reduce the chance of any new mutation happening."
5612,The idea that preventing spread could increase mutation rate is not connected to reality.
5613,Jeez lighten up.

5620,"Man, I thought I was the only one!"
5621,I'm pointing out that it's not necessarily their fault as the above poster seems to think.
5622,"People have lifestyles that don't allow them to work out, they get injuries and chronic illnesses, they have too much weight from eating cheap food... there are lots of reasons other than character flaws that people aren't healthy."

5626,I wish we would stop seeing this statement made on its own.
5627,"While what you say is technically true we still do not know the long term effects on the individuals who get sick in the ""safe"" areas."
5628,So while their risk of hospitalization remains low it needs to be reiterated in the same statement that there is most likely permanent damage done to the body for individuals with unmitigated infection.
5629,That may well lower the life expectancy by a significant margin.
5630,"Love it when people say “well 78% of those hospitalized were overweight or obese.”

Yeah, and 70%+ of the American population is overweight or obese."
5631,"Sir, we won World War II"

5702,Unfortunate that the “vaccines cause autism” community was already gaining popularity in certain groups before this shit even started.
5703,I have a son with autism so I had some experience with social media antivax moms groups that spread around all kinds of disinformation at least 5-8ish years ago
5704,This post appears to be about vaccines.

5706,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
5707,*
5708,Just comparing the two and their behaviour towards less powerful nations.
5709,I would imagine in time of pandemics nations should forget their grievances.
5710,At least in case of things that can prevent unnecessary deaths.
5711,Like embargo on medical supplies (USA towards Cuba) or sharing of information via WHO (China towards Taiwan).
5712,Ok that’s a separate discussion though.
5713,You said the side effect profile isn’t worse for younger people which just isn’t true.
5714,"The main thing is though, even if the serious side effects are very rare (which it very much seems that they are), serious complications/death from COVID are also extremely rare for most people under 18."
5715,"You have to consider the reward as well as the risk - the same side effect profile would be very clearly worthwhile, by a mile, for people over 65 and a close call for people under 18."
5716,"It may very well be that the risk reward favors vaccinating kids under 18 that have a comorbidity putting them at higher risk for COVID, but not kids who are generally healthy (which is the approach Germany is taking)."
5717,Or maybe they only get one dose.
5718,Listen TWIV and watch on youTube.
5719,"[https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-684/](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-684/)

Shane Crotty explains a study of antibodies, B cells and T cells in patients."
5720,"Also

[https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-736/](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-736/)

Alessandro Sette joins TWiV to discuss the role of T cells in COVID-19, the finding that amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have a negligible impact on T cell reactivity in convalescent patients and vaccinees."
5721,Also I have a question - do we know what happens to the body long term after catching covid even if we are not seriously ill?
5722,"It is a novel disease (still), and we do know masks work not just against covid but for other stuff like flu and cold."
5723,Why would I not continue to wear something like a surgical mask for better health even after majority is vaxxed?
5724,"Masks cause no discomfort and my allergies, flu have disappeared since I started following covid protocol so I only see an upside in wearing masks"
5725,"I believe research in Alberta where I live, has Moderna slightly better than Pfizer, but really no difference."
5726,That's a funny way of saying that at least 75% of young adults (enough for herd immunity) will get the vaccine.
5727,"Yes, I think it will be more like the US ,,mini-surge"" that happened some months ago."
5728,"Well, at least I hope it will be so."
5729,Seriously.
5730,Major political figures in Germany are predicting a huge surge of cases later this year and I‘m questioning if we live in the same reality?
5731,It's almost like we spent an entire year losing thousands or more lives per day and an abundance of caution is perfectly warranted while we distribute and study the vaccines!
5732,[deleted]
5733,"I heard yesterday that out of 31 observed deaths in the UK from Delta, 14 were fully vaccinated people?"
5734,45% rate….?
5735,How can both be true?
5736,"(I’m fully vaccinated and not anti vaccine, just confused here because this seems to be contradicting information.)"
5737,"No don't get me wrong, I too know that their vaccinations have been terrible so far, it's just that I can't stand the phrase ""the best or the worst in the G7"" because at then end we are talking about a group of only 7 countries..."
5738,"We already know Post Viral Syndrome exists and can be caused by a wide variety of viruses, including coronaviruses."
5739,"The symptoms are nearly identical to ""long covid""."
5740,Hard disagree.
5741,Stimulus checks for those vaccinated would’ve pushed those numbers significantly.
5742,People are overestimating how many die hard anti-vaxxers there are and underestimating how many misinformed people there are who just don’t really care.
5743,"It's nice knowing that as a random, 30 year old American with no risk factors I can still get vaccinated like a month before a head of state."
5744,What's wrong with Canada's rollout?
5745,"We are near the top of world in first doses, and going to be complete by early August!"
5746,Canada is doing awesome!
5747,"Yep, same here."
5748,Frustrating that those for whom it was safe to take weren’t taking it.
5749,Have fun!
5750,Where are you going to?
5751,"no its not, it's been updated."
5752,click on link again.
5753,I imagine with the gong-show that is vaccine rollout in Canada we will be producing some good data on mixed dose AZ/mRNA within the next couple of months.
5754,"I'm trying to read through the linked scientific papers, but as far as I can tell from this article and others I have read, people who have had a severe case of COVID within the past 3-6 months do not need to get a second vaccine does (but are still advised to get the first)."
5755,Is this accurate information or have I been cherry-picking articles/studies here?
5756,Does anyone have any sources that contradict this?

5758,"&gt; younger age groups are being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in greater numbers in comparison with people age 80+ admitted to hospital with COVID-19

This is one of those ""true, but misleading"" statements."
5759,"More younger people are being admitted as a percentage of total patients (which as a whole, is going way down) because they have a lower rate of vaccination."
5760,It is not that these new variants are more dangerous to young people than old people or something.
5761,[deleted]
5762,Is that how they're doing it there?
5763,That doesn't seem right
5764,He’ll likely be president in a few years.
5765,There’s a ton of them picking up the banner to be the next nut job and he’s numero uno.
5766,Remember that a lot of people on here calling for endless restrictions and lockdowns really haven’t lost anything to these.
5767,"If you were already a homebody pre pandemic who didn’t travel or have many friends, you might not notice many differences in your life right now."
5768,A lot of pregnant women are getting it ( me included) and it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.
5769,"Getting Covid pregnant would be a complete nightmare, fevers alone Can be detrimental to a fetus."
5770,I'd really like to know how we got here.
5771,Why some people hole-heartedly believe some of the craziest shit.
5772,It's not even that they believe things on the internet just because it looks legit.
5773,I've seen people hear something from a stranger and repeat it like it's a fact.
5774,"My dad just told me a couple days ago that he ""saw on the news"" (doubtful) that they were finally recounting the votes and Biden's presidency was about to be overturned."
5775,I told him that's not how electing a president even works.
5776,Like he wants to believe it so bad he doesn't even second guess it or look it up.
5777,Yes but it would help if others did too.
5778,There are a lot of scary things about adult life.
5779,Covid is terrifying.
5780,What your case of Covid could do to other unvaxxed people around you is terrifying.
5781,You feeling temporary discomfort from a painless jab shouldn't be as terrifying but I know it can be.
5782,You will find the vaccine experience to be painless and actually fascinating.
5783,You will recover in short measure from any side effects.
5784,And you will be relieved to be on the other side of it.
5785,I'm proud of you for going forward with it.
5786,Be proud of yourself.
5787,Do you have a source on that?
5788,I'm concerned that that massive death statistic today does not bode well for the next couple of weeks/months regardless of our vaccination campaign.
5789,"""If it's so important then why don't they pay me to get it""

It's not generally worth listening to these kinds of arguments"
5790,"It is a real thing but it is very, very rare."
5791,"The media likes to hype up things that are scary, because that is how they make money."
5792,"This is what the WHO says:

Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."
5793,There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
5794,Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults.
5795,"However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines."

5797,In my opinion we are looking pretty good right now.
5798,Let the precautions stand.

5805,Remindme!
5806,14 days
5807,What about a bloated govt.
5808,?
5809,It’ll be interesting to see how this develops in the US.
5810,I’m curious to see if it really becomes a problem in low vaccine areas like the South.
5811,I’d like to know how well previous infection and J&amp;J protects against Delta.
5812,Lots of info about Pfizer (and Moderns as it’s similar).
5813,"If someone has had Covid, how likely will they be to catch Delta or become seriously ill?"
5814,I’m vaxxed but I know lots of people who aren’t and curious to see how this goes.
5815,I’m in Texas.
5816,"Like Florida, masks are off in the majority of places and life is pretty much back to normal."
5817,Delta has all the opportunity in the world to spread here if it can get past those vaccinated or with antibodies.
5818,"I know my GP's faves list is 1) Pfizer, 2) Moderna, 3) J&amp;J but no idea of his rationale."
5819,"It's important to note that my GP plays Ozzy, Slaughter, Skid Row, Dokken on repeat over his office Muzak so yeah."
5820,"Not that Fauci determines policy or anything so it's not really a ditch against him, but it's still amazing the government goes on about ""learning from out mistakes to prevent this like last time"" yet is so stubborn about going above and beyond for citizens it just won't put the simplest solution on the table: Direct Cash relief if you get the vaccine."
5821,Saying Delta is a threat will do little for people already against the shot.
5822,[removed]
5823,"If anyone's wondering why they do this, it's to get your insurance information in their system."
5824,"If they already have your info, getting prescriptions will be faster and you're more likely to go to Walgreens for prescriptions in the future."
5825,Publix has done this with flu vaccines for years.
5826,Sorry to see it.
5827,I’m sure it could be any other town in the south though.
5828,Except Florida of course.
5829,They don’t get covid there
5830,"Sorry, I think this report is conflicting with another news earlier this week that 1/3 of death in UK with delta variation has already received both doses."
5831,So efficiency can’t be that high if it’s only twice effective in prevention against death right?
5832,Isn’t that why UK is still in lockdown?
5833,It's still illegal to get a haircut where I live in Canada...
5834,Do you give food to a starving person or a fat person who hasn’t eaten in an hour?
5835,[deleted]
5836,rapid antigen tests are notorious for false positives.
5837,"That's why they're only recommended for use on SYMPTOMATIC patients, not as a screening tool."
5838,"PCR should generally be used for confirmation, if readily available."
5839,More accurate is the Ellume at-home test.
5840,I'm not sure if that's available in your country as it just hit pharmacy shelves in the spring here in the USA.
5841,"Shhhhh don’t think, just consume and comply"
5842,I watched an interview with Dr. Fauci a few weeks back where he said about 40% of people who work at the CDC are vaccinated.
5843,I expected that number to be higher.
5844,Not for lack of effort
5845,"Yes, I understand that, proportionately, the unvaccinated are much more likely to be hospitalised, and account for the majority of hospitalisations."
5846,But you would expect as much.
5847,Unvaccinated older adults are still the most at risk.
5848,"What is surprising, to me, is  the number of vaccinated individuals who still wind up being hospitalised."
5849,Suggests lower efficacy than has been assessed by the initial studies.
5850,That’s all I’m saying.
5851,"they've had it since the march, and probably the reason for their high caseloads at that time."
5852,"Well, why would you want that?"
5853,Just to give another angle mRNA based CureVac have only 47% efficacy.
5854,Why would we believe anything at this point?
5855,You’ve been wrong every single step of the way
5856,[removed]
5857,"Oh believe me, I know."
5858,I have two sons who are immunocompromised.
5859,We need to take additional precautions just like we did before the pandemic and just like we will after the pandemic.
5860,Discounting wars given they ate entirely under human control.
5861,[removed]
5862,"True, just trickier when you live in a state where adults are refusing to get vaccinated and the governor is literally telling schools they're not allowed to ask for those reasonable precautions."
5863,"I've generally landed on letting my son play outside with friends with no restrictions, he attended in-person school wearing a mask all last year, and I'm about to allow playdates with kids whose parents are vaccinated."
5864,But the delta variant stuff combined with asinine state policies gives me some pause for sure.
5865,"&gt;Bro we were never going to eradicate it

That's the long-term goal though."
5866,"We eradicated smallpox and have almost eradicated polio (has been eradicated everywhere except Afghanistan and Pakistan) yaws (was almost eradicated in the 1960s until the WHO stopped efforts and it re-emerged), guinea worm (3.5 million cases in 1986 to 27 cases in 2020) and we're working on malaria (projected to be eradicated by 2050)."
5867,"Preventing it from spreading is the first step toward eradication, and while true eradication (0 cases) is a long-term goal, *functional* eradication (guinea worm only had 27 *total* cases in 2020) is within reach provided we continue to treat it with the respect it deserves."
5868,"If the best they can manage is 6 months of protection, Russia will be in a state of emergency forever."
5869,People will twist anything into their narrative.
5870,Their leaders want people that are too ignorant to look out for their best interest.
5871,I think this is the key to the strategy; it's bit too fast to be re-opening everything when significant parts of the population still don't have access to the second dose.
5872,We can start dropping whatever few restrictions are still in place once everyone who wanted two doses has had a chance to get them.
5873,"Once that's done, I agree that it's full-on Darwin time."
5874,It's your own damn fault if you get seriously ill because you refused a vaccine that was offered to you free of charge.
5875,"So far it's been evolving to be more deadly, not less."
5876,"But on the other hand eventually a large portion of the surviving population will be mostly immune to the worst effects due to either natural infection or vaccination, at which point it no matter how much it mutates it will never be as bad as these first few waves."
5877,"I hope, anyway."
5878,"Thanks, doctor...?"
5879,Exactly.
5880,"We have over 60,000 people on the streets of L.A. County and it's already a crisis."
5881,Let's not evict everyone and contribute to it!
5882,I thought people refusing to get vaccinated was the greatest threat?
5883,No he isn't.
5884,"He said ""may""."
5885,Fucking *thank* you.
5886,The WHO is the *World* Health Organization.
5887,They are not going to recommend vaccinating children until most of the worlds adult population who are more at risk are safe.
5888,Which makes sense.
5889,Because there is a significant risk of the variants being immune to the vaccine.
5890,Also the variants are significantly more contagious and deadly than vanilla Covid.
5891,So sick of people claiming that if the vaccine works government doesn’t need to pay people to get it.

&gt; Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants."
5917,"Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli."

5932,We can't eradicate the disease as long as children remain a natural reservoir.
5933,The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children 12 and up to get the vaccine.

5989,The vaccines are about 95% effective in preventing infection after two doses.
5990,This means that about one out of every twenty people who have both vaccines can expect to get sick.
5991,The other 19 will be fine.
5992,"For those 19 people out of every 20, it's obvious why the vaccine isn't pointless."
5993,And for the 20th?
5994,"Well, they're likely to avoid any serious effects, recover faster, and have less of a chance of infecting others or providing the virus a body in which it can thrive and evolve into a more dangerous state."
5995,So you need a negative test before you board the plane leaving Canada?
5996,or do you need a negative prior to boarding the plane that is bringing you back into Canada?
5997,Sure.

But I’m not sure it means as much to say that Japan’s vaccine rollout is much brisker than OECD member Slovenia’s,  as it does to compare them to their closest economic peers."
6000,It depends on where the Delta mutation is on the RNA strand and how that mutation effects the spike composition and at what location.
6001,"If the mutation drastically changes the spike proteins recognized by the vaccine, the immune system is going to have to start all over again."
6002,"It seems that Delta is similar enough to the vaccine that the immune system does recognize it though, maybe just possibly not as quickly or as efficiently?"
6003,They're still parsing that out.
6004,"As for the completely naive immune system (never infected, never vaxxed) it looks like Delta is outcompeting earlier strains and winning the infection race."
6005,"It doesn't seem to be more ""dangerous"" per se, just more infectious"
6006,exactly.
6007,"if you're in your 50s and 60s and you have structural issues that prevent you from having a proper diet and proper exercise, it means you most likely didn't do those things when you were younger and are now reaping the consequences."

6009,It's all about consistency and safety.
6010,"yes there are people who have those issues despite everything they've done, but in all likelihood it'd have been much worse had they not taken care of themselves."
6011,Its a mutation.
6012,If left unchecked it could end up mutating among kids into something that could effect them more.
6013,As of the moment Kids don't seem to get severe side effects even though they can contract it just as easily.

6019,"A lot of the blame goes to the parents as well, the fact that just barely &gt;1/4 of 12-15 year olds have gotten their first doses is ridiculous when the media is crying ""OMG vaccinate kids or we'll all die!"""
6020,"If the person is a friend/acquaintance, and their choice has no affect on your life, I’d say let them do what they want."
6021,"If it’s a family member trying to convince everyone in the household to stay in another year for them despite being vaccinated, I’d say sit them down and try to come up with a compromise that’s let you resume a semblance of normality while still taking their concerns into account."
6022,Moderna and Pftzer use more or less the same spike protein to stimulate immunity.
6023,It'd be really surprising if they were any different against a variant.
6024,"&gt; 75% of Americans are overweight

6030,The US won’t turn into a variant factory though.

6055,That John Hopkins article that suggests they don't/cant was written about same time as CDC director had made statement.

6072,A recent study (discussed here in the science moderated C19 sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/o3zjtv/differences_in_igg_antibody_responses_following/) found that Moderna produces more neutralizing antibodies than the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
6073,"It's a small difference, and likely due to the 3x larger dose size they opted to use."

6082,"So there is a ""Big anti-vaccine""..."
6083,This is from Dr. Vincent Racaniello's biweekly reddit QA session.
6084,"Protection moderate to severe disease is the goal of any vaccine, NOT the infection."
6085,"After a year or two, even best mRNA vaccine will not protected you from infection unless you got another booster shot."
6086,A lot of people on this forum and popular media don't seem to understand the basic of virology and is always worry about efficacy against infection while we should be concern about efficacy against moderate/severe disease.
6087,"""Not clear to me why boosters are needed."
6088,So far most of the vaccines appear to prevent severe disease with all the variants.
6089,"Infection is not prevented, only moderate to severe disease."
6090,That is how most human vaccines work.
6091,I think there is a tendency to extrapolate from influenza virus where a decrease in antibody neutralization titer against current strains triggers reformulation of the vaccine.
6092,But SARS-CoV-2 is not influenza virus.
6093,I think we need to observe how vaccinated people respond to infection and keep track of disease severity.
6094,"If it seems like more severe disease is occurring in vaccinated people, then we might change the vaccine."
6095,"But remember that T cells protect against severe disease and their epitopes do not change in the variants."""
6096,"""Those studies were done shortly after vaccination when antibody levels are very high."
6097,In a year the serum and mucosal antibody levels will be very low and will not prevent infection.
6098,"However the memory response will kick in in 2-3 days and prevent extensive replication, shedding, and disease."""
6099,"""The benefit of the inactivated vaccines is that they contain other viral proteins, not just spike."
6100,Those other viral proteins have T cell epitopes which can only be beneficial and help prevent disease.
6101,"The need for booster probably comes from not having enough inactivated virus, or it not generating a good memory response."""

6124,But they aren’t a high risk group.
6125,"If we try to get them to “ponder their own mortality” by overstating the risk, they will see through it as they see their peers getting infected and recovering ok. We want them to get vaccinated to stop the spread, we should be honest that’s the motivation and let them decide for themselves whether they want to help protect the vulnerable."

6246,"That's not even the important reason, especially since they actually waited on the manufacturing even though they were paid to start it ahead (the manufacturing ramp up came 3-4 months after approval, it could have happened before approval or at least right after)."
6247,What really sped it up was how rampant the virus was.
6248,That's what made the phase 3 efficacy trials so short that we ended up waiting on the safety trial (which is time based).
6249,"If covid had been controlled everywhere in the world, but not eradicated, we'd have waited years for this vaccine."
6250,This is accurate.
6251,"I would add, however, in every comparable study I’ve seen on the original strain and all variants where they looked at both Moderna and Pfizer with the same or nearly the same criteria, the results have been within the margin of error."
6252,Meaning that for all intents and purposes they have ~~had~~ the same efficacy.
6253,The difference between 95.2 and 94.1 isn’t actually a difference statistically speaking.
6254,The confidence interval could flip either direction.
6255,The **only** study I’ve seen that had a significant difference between the two was a study on efficacy at 3 weeks after dose 1.
6256,That had Moderna considerably more effective against hospitalization than Pfizer (about 10-15 percent if I remember correctly).
6257,"IIRC, it was explained as Moderna shots have a larger dose of the vaccine than Pfizer."

6291,I have a handful of friends who have become landlords and for pretty much all of them it was a house that they had previously purchased and lived in  and they realize they did not need to sell it to be able to get another one so they decided to rent it out instead.
6292,They are good landlords and take care of their tenants and for the most part end up taking the brunt of any negative situation between them and the tenant.
6293,Usually it is absolutely no fault of their own.
6294,it’s a far cry from this idea that landlords are scum bags who are just looking to take advantage of people.

6342,"Abstract

We analyze the tone of COVID-19 related English-language news articles written since January 1, 2020."
6343,Ninety one percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty five percent for scientific journals.
6344,The negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments including school re-openings and vaccine trials.
6345,Media negativity is unresponsive to changing trends in new COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience.
6346,"U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general."
6347,Stories of increasing COVID-19 cases outnumber stories of decreasing cases by a factor of 5.5 even during periods when new cases are declining.
6348,"Among U.S. major media outlets, stories discussing President Donald Trump and hydroxychloroquine are more numerous than all stories combined that cover companies and individual researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines."
6349,They can choose what to do with their bodies even if it kills millions of people.
6350,Every person who has died from COVID-19 died because someone with COVID-19 infected them.
6351,"Today, a cumulative total of about 3.9 million children, women, and men worldwide have died from COVID-19."
6352,"If each one of the dead got their COVID-19 infection from a different person, the dead arguably were killed by about 3.9 million other people who infected them with COVID-19."
6353,"Some people infected with COVID-19 arguably might not infect others, but arguably many do, including superspreaders who can infect a large number of persons, as in the case of the happy, friendly, healthy-looking, and well-dressed person who unknowingly was infected with COVID-19 and was traveling on a crowded train with a lot of people partying from Washington DC to New York."
6354,"After the superspreader reached his or her destination, the person became visibly sick and tested positive for COVID-19."
6355,"A team of medical investigators and contact tracers quickly found, identified, and tested more than 50 people the superspreader had contacted and unknowingly infected during the train trip."
6356,"Nobody knows how many infected strangers, neighbors, coworkers, family members, and others might be circulating among us, while they appear to be happy, friendly, beautiful, or handsome, but, unknowingly are infected and spreading a virus that can sicken, hospitalize, kill, or cause long-haul COVID in any of us having any contact with the unknowingly infected person."
6357,"Arguably, not all persons infected with COVID-19 are superspreaders."
6358,"Some infected persons knowingly or unknowingly might infect 0, 1, 2, or some other number of persons."
6359,"One thing about COVID-19 that we all can be certain about is that before we can become infected, before we can become sick, before we can become hospitalized, before we can have an airtube snaked into our mouths and down into our lungs so we don't suffocate while struggling to breathe and lying unconscious in an ICU bed, before we can die from COVID-19, or before we can develop long-haul COVID, we will have to be infected by a stranger or someone familiar, who is knowingly or unknowingly infected with COVID-19."
6360,That's the main requirement for getting COVID-19.
6361,"Someone has to infect you, and that someone can be any unknowingly infected friend or any unknowingly infected stranger."
6362,Flip a coin.
6363,"Sadly, I have observed that some friends and relatives don't seem to be as upset about the death of a loved one who died from COVID-19 if they think one of themselves was the person who infected the deceased."
6364,"Like it's OK if someone who was recently known to be infected with COVID-19 realizes they infected a person within their own family, and that person died from COVID-19 nineteen days later."
6365,"They act like as long as a friend or relative was the one who infected the deceased, it's not so bad."
6366,It's kind of OK.
6367,It's just one of those quiet family things.
6368,It will go away after a while.
6369,"But, what might be as sad is not knowing how many strangers someone infected before that someone realized he or she was infected or before he or she tested positive, and how many of those strangers died from COVID-19 that someone had given them."
6370,"It seems to me that there may be no shortage of people who know they were infected, but seem to have little or no concern about how many strangers or other people they might have infected, and how many of those other people ended up with a $200 thousand hospital bill, ended up dead in a  hospital, or ended up suffering from the agony, pain, and indescribable hell of unending suffering from long-haul COVID."

6391,We should be looking at the data from a month ago because that's when the uptick started in the UK and vaccines don't become effective overnight.
6392,"One month ago, only 34% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated, many of which were with the less effective AstraZeneca vaccine."
6393,Saying 80% of Adults are vaccinated is very misleading.
6394,Some of the 'reluctance' may not even be that aspect.

6440,I have not had any symptoms and rapid tests were negative.
6441,That being said I did not get a PCR test though.
6442,To follow up on my previous post.
6443,The introduction of vaccines showed a massive decline in infections.
6444,"Also before they were approved, RCT's showed a promising effectiveness."
6445,"The introduction of facemasks showed no real impact on the numbers whatsoever, neither did the lifting of mandates in half the states in the US in march."

6449,Deligeries will probably stay up in july since Pfizer is behind even with the new schedule
6450,the 95th confidence level for 1 dose of Pfizer is 47%- 99%.
6451,"So 1 dose of Pfizer is most likely somewhere in the range of too low to be approved, to the most-protective vaccine in the history of the world."
6452,Yeah...the sample size is too small to make any good conclusion.
6453,What if you had J&amp;J one shot vaccine?
6454,Should you still get a second dose of mRNA vaccine?
6455,I don't think so.

6457,"For infections themselves, the vaccine efficacy is ~88% for pfizer and 67% for AZ against the Delta variant."
6458,IL hit 53% fully vaccinated.
6459,"I'm pleasantly surprised because it looked like we were going to top out around 45ish% at the peak, but we seem to have a long tail with vaccinations."

6469,The idea that Asians wear masks constantly and always follow the rules is just not correct.
6470,"They do on their motorbikes because of pollution, but there are plenty that still don’t, even now."
6471,They also still go to karaoke bars secretly and have parties in their homes- it’s been all over the news there.
6472,"Other than the very young, and possibly pregnant women, I’m not aware of anyone who is advised to avoid vaccination for medical reasons."
6473,"The mRNA vaccines don’t contain any trace of virus, so the normal concerns about infection don’t apply."
6474,"Hopefully Pfizer will be approved for 2-11 year olds before the end of the year, and then it will just be infants and pregnant women."
6475,"And even then, I don’t think pregnant women are discouraged from getting it."

6498,I just hate being forced to.
6499,"While they haven't been tested with 1 of each, there's every reason to believe you'll have similar immunity as someone with 2 doses of the same shot."
6500,How so?
6501,I am one of them.
6502,It reduces hospitalisations by 96%.
6503,"&gt; I thought the vaccine keeps people out from the hospital

In the UK alone the vaccine has already prevented 42,000 hospitalisations."
6504,We’ve heard the same with every other variant and yet nothing major has changed.
6505,Children should continue to wear their masks then if this is the case.
6506,Just like people who aren’t vaccinated should be too.
6507,Yeah but I also imagine they are more homogeneous so when some official speaks there are less distinct layers of 'we vs them' etc.
6508,If the directives were coming from the EU level I am sure any public response would be much worse; but luckily we still have strong nation states though the homogeneity is getting worse.
6509,"&gt;Are you more afraid of the needle than being on the ventilator or suffering from long covid

Why does everyone pull out the words ""Ventilator"" or ""Long Covid"" to tell people to get it?"
6510,"If you're young and healthy, you're at low risk of Covid, even if you got the vaccine, you can still catch Covid, get symptoms and also spread it."

Older relatives would be vaccinated wouldn't they?"
6512,Any word on China'a licensed production of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine?

6520,Yep I see this too.
6521,"There is still the all too common ""We just don't know what will happen long term after taking the vaccine""."
6522,I hear this from parents that are fully vaccinated.

6554,But it will not  be around 90% for sure.
6555,To say that it’s 96% efficiency against hospitalization after 2nd dose just doesn’t quite add up with high death rate.

6813,"My county went from plateauing at 600 cases a day from the start of February through early April to then plummeting down to less than 30 cases a day by the end of May, which was a period of *loosening* restrictions and almost exactly corresponds with a few weeks after the vaccine became widely available."
6814,"That isn't exactly ""herd immunity"", the virus isn't completely eliminated, and there clearly might be other factors involved."
6815,"But as far as I can tell from the actual examples of places getting vaccinated, as soon as a community becomes widely vaccinated, spread of COVID becomes greatly inhibited and it becomes a lot safer to do activities that used to be super dangerous."
6816,"Obviously the exact % that needs to be vaccinated for COVID to no longer be a big threat would depend on things like the efficacy of the vaccine used, how contagious the local variants are, the behaviors of people in the community, weather, etc."
6817,But vaccinations line goes up =&gt; COVID line goes down is a pretty well established relationship at this point.
6818,"I think what you might be missing - if there is a new variant introduced (especially a more deadly one.....)  the cases could still be seen as coming down, but the deaths could remain the same."
6819,Because the variant is more deadly than what preceeded it.
6820,"(the deaths could even concievably go up a little depending on the severity)  Meaning...cases could be down, but deaths can stay at the same rate and not....go down...in the same way that you would expect."
6821,A lot don't seem to know what is going on here.
6822,"Though there is vaccine hesitancy for sure, this is not the reason for the slow rollout."
6823,Japanese bureaucracy moves at a glacial pace and was solely responsible for the slow approval and logistics of vaccination process.
6824,It was only until about the end of May that big vaccination centers opened and the pace vaccinations increased to reasonable levels.
6825,[deleted]
6826,So the key reasons for you to not get the vaccine is because other people around you got the vaccine so your risk is lower.
6827,Why don't you take a second and think about what the world would look like if everyone thought like you.
6828,Do you like that world?
6829,I guess we identify “fantasy” differently.
6830,I don’t want people to die.
6831,I cherish life.
6832,That’s why I got the vaccine.
6833,"They do not cherish life, even their own."
6834,That’s why they did not get the vaccine.
6835,Fairly simple concept.
6836,Thanks for the reply.

6844,"For context, peak flu season kills more than this every day."
6845,That's how successful the vaccines have been.
6846,"Okay... 

1) Even if you don't get hospitalizated, you can get long COVID, which could be months of fatigue, loss of taste, etc."
6847,"If you are very active, long COVID could put you on your ass for months since you lose your endurance."
6848,2) Most COVID cases are symptomatic.
6849,If you did not get symptoms you most likely did not get COVID.
6850,"Further, the vaccines provide much better coverage against COVID than previous infection."
6851,"3) COVID cases may not stay low forever, and if they start to increase it is probably too late to get the vaccine since it takes 6-7 weeks to be effective."
6852,"4) Do you go to bars, restaurants, clubs, etc?"
6853,"If so, you are at risk from COVID in these spaces."
6854,"Also, vaccinated people can spread it, it is just less common."
6855,"5) The rate of myocarditis is still much lower than the rate of severe COVID in young, unvaccinated people."
6856,6) 2 days (1 after each shot) of feeling bad is much better than COVID which lasts for 10+ days.
6857,"Also, it sounds like you have a job that gives you good benefits, so you can just take off."
6858,7) No vaccine has ever had effects that take months/years to show.
6859,The mRNA leaves your body a couple days later.
6860,"This is impossible, not unlikely."
6861,8) I'm not sure the point of this?
6862,"I don't want to get into a political debate but not getting vaccinated only hurts you, not the politicians."
6863,"They are vaccinated and immune, and aren't personally hurt if you get infected."
6864,I hope you decide to get vaccinated!
6865,The more people that do lessens the risk of spread in our entire community and bring us closer to ending the pandemic worldwide.

7089,Taiwan for example has a surge now because they too thought it was over.
7090,Many  national and international experts were jubilant that Covid was over in India and they had managed it well.
7091,Govt appointed panels commissioned sero tests and found 60-70% people had Covid antibodies already.
7092,Infected people were getting out of hospitals within a day or two.

7141,"(if they did that would be a very bad sign....)     So multiple states just do not list thier totals seemingly on Sundays, so it shows as a 0 but..the next day...a bunch."
7142,"So Michigan today is 36, yesterday seemingly no data."
7143,"Colorado 32 so far today...yesterday...a ""zero"" or more probably, no data."
7144,So they didn't go combined from 0 to 68 in one day.
7145,Looking at Monday's is more useful imo.
7146,"(today so far 196, again did  not ""double"" in one day...its weird reporting on weekends.)"

7148,Perhaps some countries with few other options might use it.
7149,Too bad it’s not clear what the effectivity might be against delta and other variants.
7150,Nope.
7151,Actually home grown vaccines are the most expensive vaccines so far.
7152,I think it is more about production capacity.

7185,The risk from Covid is significantly higher than whatever risk the vaccine carries.
7186,And you do notice the rapid decline of cases and deaths from Covid in the US right?
7187,Why do you think that is if I may ask you?
7188,A booster is in the works but 2 doses of current 2 dose vaccines are still effective.
7189,"They are just less effective than they were against the original strain, the wild-type of SARS-CoV-2, which seems to be disappearing as it’s replaced by more infectious strains."
7190,&gt;I would like to signal my highest displeasure with how this pandemic was handled.
7191,I have given up much of my social life for a year and a half.
7192,I lost 42% of my a income in 2020 compared to 2019.
7193,No one has seemed to give a shit.
7194,People canceled contracts that I could have worked with almost zero covid risk.
7195,"The behavior of our elected officials, health bureaucrats, and media has been appalling."
7196,Not getting the vaccine seems to be the only leverage I have against them.
7197,So your method of protesting about Covid restrictions is to behave in a manner that risks extending the pandemic and those very same restrictions?
7198,Have you really thought this through?

7512,The reason we're removing mask mandates and other restrictions on businesses in the US has nothing to do with vaccination rates and more to do with politics and financial contributions.

7563,Most people are healthy and won't suffer from lack of health coverage.
7564,"But in the pool of people who have life threatening diseases, which is much much smaller than the total population (although I don't know the exact number), 45 000 of them died directly from lack of healthcare."
7565,"For reference, ""only"" 3 000 000 Americans die every year."
7566,"Lots of those are due to old age and accidents and a few other factors, but even then, 45 000 out of 3 000 000 is a much higher and scarier number than 45 000 out of 300 000 000."
7567,"And finally, you have to consider that those deaths are preventable."
7568,"Cancer is a big killer, half a million a year, and we spend an enormous amount of resources to lower that number, without much effect unfortunately."
7569,"Same situation with heart disease, all those deaths are hard to prevent."
7570,"But universal healthcare is a known solution that is proven effective in every country in the world and could prevent those 45 000 deaths, and according to many economists, do it while spending even less money than currently."

7583,Well the CIA has done a lot of fucked up things.

7597,"Fewer than 10 of those deaths are under 50, I think, and probably only 1 death is both young and no known health complications."
7598,"And we are poorer than the US, a less robust Healthcare system, worldwide institutions are suspicious on us by default (proven during the pandemic) and more."

7613,"They believe they understand the science better than you do, your doctor does, or even the vaccine manufacturer."
7614,"The antivaxx stance is a bipartisan attraction, from New age woo witches to quiverfull fundamentalist christians."
7615,This is another situation where online communities have become the main way people network instead of face to face.
7616,"Online we surround ourselves with like minded thinkers and gain satisfaction and faux confidence by being one of the few who ""really sees what's going on""."
7617,"And they're so oppressed, these folks who are onto big pharma, losing autonomy over their bodies."
7618,"It's quite scary, and the pandemic has only made this type of social isolation and divisiveness worse."

7633,Yes.
7634,We won't know about the long term effects of mild COVID for a long time.
7635,Brain tissue damage rarely recovers 100%.
7636,"So the effects here are likely chronic, and there no telling what sort of health issues will occur down the track."
7637,"I am deeply disturbed that people are taking vaccines as basically we can now do whatever we want, when they should be used as a tool - conjunction with social distance/lockdowns/testing to eliminate the virus."
7638,"In South and West, east it was Maharashtra."
7639,North it was Punjab for sure because of the presence of delta variant brought by NRIs in vast numbers

7676,They've also said that starting sometime soon they'll require you to take PTO if you have to quarantine after being exposed to the virus on-site and haven't been vaccinated.
7677,What's even crazier is to remember that the US doesn't just affect itself.

7679,Much of Canada's anti-vax population likely gets their information from Fox news
7680,New Zealand is the only developed country to have kept Covid at zero or close to it for the entire pandemic.
7681,All the other zero Covid countries have had major outbreaks at some point.
7682,We've had Covid escape our quarantine system numerous times but have always managed to crush it with contact tracing and twice snap lockdowns when there was risk of the spread outpacing contact tracing.
7683,Nevertheless the Delta variant is a worry and it concerns me that our border to New South Wales is still wide open right now while they have a Delta outbreak growing quickly.

7878,The problem with saying it is we're not at herd immunity and some communities will never be able to reach herd immunity.
7879,So when we get outbreaks and variants breakthrough people are going to say getting the vaccine was pointless and didn't work at all.
7880,It's the rising problem with MMR and TdAP vaccines.
7881,People think that it doesn't work when there's outbreaks from lack of herd immunity in the community.

7892,Soooooo much anger and hatred.
7893,I never thought wanting everyone to be safe and healthy would be so offensive to so many.
7894,You're just wrong.
7895,This virus uses a spike protein to latch onto respiratory system cells.
7896,It needs strong attachment or it can't deliver its payload.
7897,Detecting spike proteins is also what the instructions in the vaccines do.
7898,"In order for the virus to mutate in a way that would hide its spike proteins from your immune system, it would also lose its ability to latch onto cells, and in the process become a virus that cannot infect humans."
7899,"The only ""choice"" it has is to try to thread the needle and find the least-detectable spike proteins that still allow it to latch onto cells properly."
7900,"Too far in either direction makes it either a virus that can't affect humans, or can't spread to other humans, thus ending its life cycle."
7901,"The Delta variant is about as close to ideal as it gets, finding the efficient middle ground between the two extremes."
7902,And it's STILL not able to evade the vaccines.
7903,"We absolutely hit it out of the park with these vaccines, and the advantage is 100% in our court against the virus now."

7905,He also neither funded nor performed this kind of research.
7906,Not that rare.

7910,"That said, I don't think we have data yet on whether breakthrough cases get long haul symptoms."
7911,Wouldn't covid at this level be all year round rather than seasonal?
7912,So more deaths?
7913,Old double vaccinated vs Young unvaccinated.
7914,That's why the UK vaccinated from oldest to youngest.
7915,I agree and fully realise that.

7920,Maybe we can find a way to make an instant test a la a breathalyser interlock on vehicles to keep people at home if infected.
7921,P.S.
7922,sorry for the inevitable downvotes you’ll get by partially agreeing with me.
7923,Why would a protein subunit vaccine be easier to update than mRNA?
7924,Wishing well for others is not the same as demanding fantasy.

7937,We already have five significant variants in circulation.
7938,Two are variants of great concern that had become the dominant global strain within a matter of months between each other (Alpha &amp; Delta.)
7939,Single doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer have also proven nearly useless against the Delta variant.
7940,Our present vaccine output simply can't keep up.
7941,That alone seems to suggest that this virus is mutating a lot and I refuse to believe that the serious mutations this virus has developed are mere pot luck.
7942,It's the same reason young people don't vote.
7943,"""It won't affect me."""
7944,"Thanks, that's a great explanation."

7949,"I'm upset with the unvaccinated by choice, but I hate to think of kids sick and miserable."
7950,No it won’t.
7951,Covid simply mutates SIGNIFICANTLY slower than the flu.
7952,It actually mutates really really slow compared to other viruses.
7953,"Unfortunately it just has some many chances, it seems really fast."
7954,"There is an awful lot of space between ""It's fake"" and ""everyone who gets it ends up debilitated for a long time""."
7955,"We're existing somewhere in that space, which explains how a bunch of athletes have gotten it and went on to play their sport at a high level shortly after."
7956,I get why some people here (Australia) are worried.

7968,Lol Reddit hates landlords for some reason.
7969,My wife and I both work full-time and 18 months before the pandemic we decided to take a risk by purchasing the worst house in our neighborhood and fixing it up from top to bottom to be a rental in order to eventually help put my kids through college.
7970,With two little kids at home working full-time I spent countless hours (mostly weekends and from 9pm-3am) with my own hands fixing it up (and basically a year of my salary on supplies) from top to bottom and turned it into a clean beautiful rental property.
7971,I can’t tell you how many people in the neighborhood have told me that they were so happy that somebody took this house I made it into something beautiful.
7972,Right as I was getting ready to rent it out the pandemic hit.
7973,Luckily after waiting a few months a friend of mine who is looking for a place ended up becoming my tenant.
7974,It’s been an amazing experience and I feel very blessed to have the situation work out the way that it did.
7975,With that being said I would be devastated frustrated and heartbroken with immeasurable stress on my marriage if I had a tenant in there who literally just decided to not pay me a dollar.
7976,This would be  especially frustrating when there is almost a year of unemployment benefits that were amped up with $600 plus a number of stimulus checks that I’ve been doled out along the way.
7977,I get that people had hard times but to just be like eff those landlords seems to be a symptom of this pandemic that is frustrating.
7978,"Everyone says eff the teachers it’s the students, or eff the students it’s the teachers."
7979,Or screw the young or screw the old.
7980,This whole thing has taught us that we are intertwined quite a bit.
7981,Even if you look at the moratorium on evictions as something that was necessary I remember reading articles and hearing people complain about the fact that landlords would not sign new contracts and leases with people who hadn’t paid them for the better part of the year.
7982,The whole point of a contract is that you were entering into it in good faith with an understanding that there would be repercussions On both sides of the terms were not met.
7983,On what planet should someone be expected to re-enter into a contract where is someone has already shown that they will not fulfill their part of the obligations.
7984,Obviously there are predatory landlords that are pieces of garbage but let’s not forget that the trope of the tenant takes advantage doesn’t come from a fantasy either.
7985,Yes.
7986,RemindMe!
7987,60 days
7988,I’m fine with it.
7989,The number of breakthrough infections that also happen to have a false negative test will be negligible.

7995,$1000 tax deduction for getting vaccinated!
7996,But in reality it only saves the average person like $100-$200.
7997,Didn’t they say this a few weeks ago?
7998,Or even a few months ago with the Alpha variant?

8018,"Source: [Decision on possible change in Level 3 COVID alert to come Wednesday](https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202106220014)

Taipei, June 22 (CNA) Taiwan will announce Wednesday whether it plans to extend the current Level 3 COVID-19 alert beyond June 28 when it expires, after it reported under 100 new cases for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC)."
8019,"The CECC on Tuesday reported 79 new cases of COVID-19, all but one of which were domestically transmitted, as well as six deaths, raising talk of whether current restrictions could be fully or partially lifted."
8020,"At a press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said the CECC has been holding discussions with public health experts and local government leaders regarding the alert, which was issued nationwide on May 19 and has since been extended twice."
8021,"The consensus is that ""there should continue to be a consistent policy nationwide,"" Chen said, adding that a formal announcement on the subject will be made on Wednesday."
8022,"After averaging over 400 daily infections from mid-May through early June, daily case numbers dropped into the 200s from June 7 to 12, then into the 100s from June 13-20, and were in the double digits on both Monday and Tuesday."
8023,"The CECC has expressed caution about lifting the restrictions, however, given that only 6.76 percent of Taiwan's population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine shot as of Tuesday morning."
8024,"The 78 domestic cases on Tuesday included 43 in New Taipei and 25 in Taipei, which continue to be the ""high-risk"" zones of the current outbreak, while infections in other areas have become more ""sporadic,"" Chen said."
8025,"Outside of those two cities, Nantou reported three new cases, while Keelung confirmed two, and Miaoli, Changhua, Taoyuan, Taichung and Hsinchu County each reported one."
8026,"Of the 10 cases outside of New Taipei and Taipei, only two had unknown sources of infection, the CECC said."
8027,"The one imported case was that of a Taiwanese man in his 50s, who tested positive after returning from Indonesia on Sunday, the CECC said."
8028,"Meanwhile, the six deaths reported Tuesday were three men and three women, in their 50s to their 80s, who passed away between June 17 and June 21."
8029,"The new cases brought the total in the country to 14,157, of which over 12,700 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day."
8030,"To date, 575 people in Taiwan have died from COVID-19, including 563 since May 15."
8031,A Level 3 alert is the second-highest in Taiwan's four-tier COVID-19 alert scale.
8032,"Under the alert, schools have been closed and many companies have shifted to remote work or staggered working schedules."
8033,"People are also required to wear masks at all times when they leave their homes, and are banned from having indoor gatherings larger than four people and outdoor gatherings larger than nine people."

8283,"Ask the author, I guess."
8284,🤷🏼‍♂️
8285,Yes.
8286,No flu season has killed 120K people in the US in recent history.
8287,333 deaths a day is a high end estimate exclusively for the 6 months of flu season during an atypically bad flu season.
8288,"A typical flu season is about 175 deaths per day during the season, or less than 100 deaths per day averaged across a year."
8289,The flu is also the single most deadly infectious disease still present in the United States.
8290,"So, as of today's 7-day average death rate, we're *still* about 3 times worse than the most deadly (at the population level) infectious disease we face."
8291,That's *after* a significant proportion of the population has been vaccinated *and* seasonal factors are in our favor.
8292,"Of course, that number should continue to go down."
8293,Deaths are a lagging indicator and cases are plummeting thanks to vaccines.
8294,But it's still a dreadful number and trying to compare even today's death rate to a typical flu year is misleading.
8295,Come back in another month or two when deaths are down to 100/day and the comparison may be apt (ignoring seasonality).
8296,get a quick test... they are cheap now...
8297,"Yeah, most of the refusers are in two groups that I've seen - the young crowd and the 40-50s conspiracy group."
8298,"As you said, people older than that are more in tune with the efficacy of vaccines and less likely to be conspiratorial in my experience."
8299,It's people under 60 causing most of the issues.
8300,Is it more lethal because it causes way more infections or is it because it cause more severe outcomes.
8301,"Just tell them she started coughing and if they ask about it later, you gave her cold medicine"

8306,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but then with Pfizer being that effective is it reasonable to assume that Moderna is equally effective since they are similar types of vaccines?"

8312,It is expected indeed that Moderna will increase their deliveries to the EU by a lot by august.
8313,This because they have no delivery commitments to the US beyond end of July.

8350,And it's going to continue to mutate as long as it's allowed to circulate in the population.
8351,Maybe we'll get lucky and it mutates into a harmless common cold.
8352,Maybe we won't get lucky and it mutates into something more like SARS-CoV1 or MERS.
8353,Maybe it stays more or less the same.
8354,"Either way, this pool of virus carried by the kids and the unvaxxed adults is going to have to be dealt with somehow."
8355,"And that's correct for states with high vaccination rates, but in states with low vaccination rates like Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama: large pockets of sickness will occur."
8356,"In Florida, tourism will drive exposure and tourists will spread the virus back to their home states."
8357,In Florida we are on the cusp of losing emergency status.
8358,"July 3rd will be the last day of it, and then we officially lose benefits, help for the needy and sick, special government aid for pop-up vaccination sites, etc."
8359,"By the time specified above, the ""72 detected cases"" of Delta will have exploded into approximately 1,179,648 (on the low side, assuming that each person infects 2 people)."
8360,The real data shows that each person with Delta has the capability to spread it to up to 6 people.
8361,"Not that that is what's going to happen, but it has lots of potential to do so, unless we get the majority of people vaccinated."
8362,"Yes, we know."
8363,But I have heard the vaccines are going well which is useful
8364,[removed]
8365,"A couple hypothetical questions:
1."
8366,"With the US having such a high population of anti-vaxxers mixed with a large number vaccinated people, is there an increased risk of vaccine resistant variants breeding?"
8367,2.
8368,"Similarly with the vast majority of vaccinations targeted at people older than 12, is there a likelihood that variants that infect children at higher rates could emerge?"
8369,I'm just genuinely curious about this.
8370,Hopefully it doesn't give people new anxieties.
8371,I don’t know that telling people why they need to be vaccinate is frightening them into getting the vaccine.
8372,It’s pretty clear that with faster spreading variants people are going to get vaccinated or they are going to get infected.
8373,I think public health officials are trying to scare the sense into the remaining vaccine resisters.
8374,"It's patronizing and will probably not work, but I think that is what they are doing."
8375,"If someone has not been motivated to get the vaccine by now, the variant isn't going to scare them into action."
8376,"&gt;he current vaccines were developed just weeks after the virus appeared

I believe they had the virus's genome mapped within a few hours (I heard this on a podcast)."
8377,Which is a huge testament to the speed with which scientists were able to start getting a handle on what they were looking at.

8385,Sounds like you’re being a good mom.
8386,👍🏼👍🏼
8387,"They also make money giving the vaccine, and know that if you go in the store you have a chance of buying things on that trip and also it increases the chances of you returning for future purchases."
8388,Yeah they always toss out the juicy worm (aka denial/FB) and then get you hooked( to oxygen)
8389,It's fast becoming a problem.
8390,When the world is vaccinated.
8391,"Until then, more variants."
8392,"As long as they don't escape the vaccines, us folks lucky enough to be born in rich countries will be fine."
8393,"Everyone else is in for a much longer bumpier ride, and deaths, lots more deaths."
8394,We should be looking at the data from a month ago because that's when the uptick started in the UK and vaccines don't become effective overnight.
8395,"One month ago, only 34% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated, many of which were with the less effective AstraZeneca vaccine."
8396,It's not but are you really happy about America and China are behaving the same?
8397,Also why even bring up China?
8398,The thing with the UK though is that the surge seems to only be infecting the young unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.
8399,They are using mostly AZ.
8400,[removed]
8401,As I’m in that batch this is what I’m hoping.
8402,"And while it’s Been a bit of a gong show, my brother in law who lives with us is fully vaccinated, my wife and I will be tonight."
8403,My anti vax father in law will be Sunday and my kids at the end of July.
8404,All of us within 8 weeks.
8405,Not too shabby
8406,"I'm trying to work out who is a) contracting in this latest wave, who is b) being hospitalised and who is c) dying."
8407,"My guess is a) mostly secondary school pupils and 18-29 year olds
b) 50 + who haven't been vaccinated
C) 70+ who haven't been vaccinated
But it's just a guess."
8408,Anyone know if any breakdown exists?
8409,Its free for first 3 months
8410,Breaking news - Water is WET!
8411,Study confirms.
8412,I’m wondering if they’ll run the numbers for mix and match participants.
8413,My wife and I are in that category and we are going for our mRNA shot today.
8414,"She is right in the bullseye of the target to be at high risk, so I didn’t feel the need to take any chances."
8415,Other concerns are what this means for traveling to the us since there seems to be a ban against the AZ for entering or doing anything there.
8416,Does it change if we’ve balanced it with an mRNA?
8417,So many questions.
8418,When enough of the world is vaccinated presumably.
8419,A common misconception about this “faster production” is that steps were shortened or skipped.
8420,"Basically, governments paid for vaccine in advance, allowing the vaccine to be mass produced before completing all of their early trials."
8421,"Because the financial interests of the vaccine makers were protected in this way, production happened IN PARALLEL to normal safety trials."
8422,"All of the same timelines applied as would normally apply to any vaccine, they just happened around the same time instead of one after another."
8423,"IT WAS:

Start phase 1 while we look for factories

Start phase two while we mass produce

Start phase three while we set up delivery."
8424,"INSTEAD OF:

Start phase 1

Start phase 2

Start phase 3

Secure financing for mass production

Find factories

Set up distribution channels

Marketing campaign

Take orders

Begin distribution"
8425,Still fucking around and haven’t yet found out.
8426,"They will either die/become permanently disabled, or see enough of their friends die/become permanently disabled to get vaccinated."
8427,The big question is how bad does it have to get for them?
8428,"[why be immune, when you can be invincible](https://youtu.be/OLoUp64YWuc)"
8429,Yeah I'm sorry if I came off the wrong way like I was bragging or something.
8430,I reread my comment and felt like that could be taken that way it definitely wasn't.
8431,I hope your situation continues to improve
8432,There is a reason Russia can manipulate those rubes easily
8433,That could also be a factor.
8434,But a substantial number of hospitalised patients in the UK have been vaccinated.
8435,And the age of those hospitalised patients still skews older.
8436,"""He began taking colloidal silver in 1999 amid fears that disruptions caused by the millennium bug might lead to a shortage of antibiotics."""
8437,Then his skin turned blue.
8438,Nice
8439,That's not true.
8440,My brother doesn't want the vaccine.
8441,"However, my entire family has been fully vaccinated with Phizer."
8442,"I had Covid, then had the one Phizer vaccine that put me in the hospital for three days."
8443,"So, I am his example of why not to get it for him."
8444,I am not getting second vaccination because cardiologist recommended not to get it.
8445,He's coming to visit me in Florida for his birthday next month.
8446,I know the variant is already here in Florida.
8447,I live in a popular tourist beach city.
8448,So there will be plenty of people here.
8449,Then he's going back to his small town in Louisiana that wasn't affected much by Covid.
8450,I am already a nervous wreck about it.
8451,There is no convincing him to get vaccine.
8452,I can see how this could be a disaster in the making.
8453,"Please, don't get mad at him or me."
8454,I thought I was not going to make it through Covid and then the vaccine.
8455,"My brother lost his daughter, my niece, in a car accident during the pandemic."
8456,He needs this vaccation for his mental well being.
8457,He's really happy about it.
8458,I haven't seen him happy in a long time.
8459,"Luckily, we have plenty of outdoor dining choices and activities."
8460,"So, we can avoid indoors."
8461,parenting failures
8462,"For the record, this same data shows that 1 dose of Pfizer is about 94% effective at preventing hospitalizations."
8463,"It feels like they left this out of the press release to encourage people to get 2nd doses, which seems an unnecessary caution (the burying of efficacy about 1st dose, not the concept of getting 2nd doses to be clear)."
8464,"Absolutely true that everyone should get their 2nd dose when available but for countries taking the 1st dose strategy, this is still unquestionably a good strategy and even rising case numbers should not be a significant concern anywhere where 1st dose vaccinations are high, especially in vulnerable populations."
8465,That's what they call the reddit circlejerk.
8466,"People just upvote what they want to believe, whether that's positive or negative."
8467,"I believe many of the people here don't even have kids and are fearmongering because they're worried about themselves, not the kids."
8468,Studies are still showing kids are at a low risk but they don't want to admit that.
8469,The U.S. is at an almost all-time low for daily Covid cases and it blows my mind anytime anyone says otherwise.
8470,It's so easy to check that.
8471,Maybe they should have targeted non-corporate landlord's for the payoff and forced the rest to waive back rent without credit.
8472,Can make it only 5 days for about £100 extra
8473,"The issue is that these deaths, or at least the vast majority of them, are/were entirely preventable, especially now with vaccines widely available."
8474,"my question is: if you're unvaccinated and scared of covid, why would you even go to a convention in the first place?"
8475,So that only leaves people who are vaccinated and people who are unvaccinated and don't give a shit
8476,"Ofcourse the media is making it seem much worse lately, they're just grasping at getting clicks in as soon it'll end with vaccines."
8477,"Having said that, the same story has factually been true for the variants."
8478,"Brazil/SA definitely have some kind of vaccine escape, but they spread less."
8479,UK/Indian both got increasingly better at spreading.
8480,[removed]
8481,I imagine the rules will stay in place at the very least until all ages are eligible for the vaccine.
8482,"Since the vaccination rate may not get high enough, this may be one that will be with us for the foreseeable future."
8483,Over time enough people will have at least some protection either through vaccination or through exposure.
8484,"That should limit the number of people who get seriously ill or die, just like the seasonal flu is among us."
8485,"Ideally wearing masks and working from home or otherwise distancing yourself if possible when you are ill (and certainly when you need to cough regularly) will become the norm, because that seems to be an important factor in limiting the spread."
8486,About to announce?..
8487,they said maybe August
8488," Maybe but I wouldn't count on it: the latest mRNA vaccine, whose name had just slipped my mind, has rather poor results."
8489,"Honestly, based on history, it seems backlash is going to happen no matter what here."
8490,Is the Delta variant the one that has fungal eye infections commonly accompanying it that is so severe it’s prompting the doctors to remove the patient’s eyes?
8491,Because if it is and the vaccination is successful against that variant I think this is exciting news.
8492,Well you are comparing it a population of hundreds of millions so it's a very small amount compared to how many are doing well
8493,"I couldn't quickly find stats on that specific scenario, but keep in mind the difference between percentage and raw numbers."
8494,Pfizer is 95% effective against infection itself (unclear to me right now if this means detectable infection or symptoms.
8495,"My money's on detectability, but digging into the trials would answer this question)."
8496,"Moderna 94, AZ 79, JnJ 66."
8497,So you're looking at a way smaller number of people who ever get infected to begin with.
8498,"Assuming your stat is correct, that 10% of overall hospitalizations still represents a much larger number than would, say, 10% of vaxed admissions because so few vaxed people even get infected to begin with."
8499,"Put another way, 10% of 1,000 infections is bigger than 10% of 10 vaxed infections."
8500,Most people who hit the hospital after vaccination were infected before the vax or shortly after but before their body could develop immunity (within that 2 week post-vax time period).
8501,I found an article on MedPageToday about the Cleveland Clinic.
8502,"Of 4300 hospital admissions between Jan and April this year, 99% were not fully vaxed."
8503,This is in line with what other hospitals are reporting.
8504,You're safer getting the vax.
8505,What about J&amp;J after 56 days?
8506,It gets better with time
8507,[deleted]
8508,"Well, thats because it is true each time."
8509,"If the virus hadnt mutated and we still had the original strain from wuhan, the entire world would have had a much easier time dealing with it because it would have spread less easily."
8510,"I get that its frustrating to hear, we are all over it."
8511,But that doesnt mean this news isnt important.
8512,Unfortunately the virus doesnt really care how we feel about it.
8513,[deleted]
8514,It’s hard to say.
8515,Of the 6 cases 5 were hospitalized and two died?
8516,Makes me think they weren’t testing enough unless this is some super deadly new strain….
8517,[deleted]
8518,what about johnson vaccine?
8519,I’m just anxious.
8520,I’m originally from the states and I was stuck there last year due to covid flight cancellations.
8521,Unlucky timing.
8522,So I have lost people to covid and it really scares me to be honest.
8523,I’m just very anxious.
8524,A coworker is waiting for his test results so it just feels very overwhelming.
8525,How are you?
8526,Time to open the world to everyone that is fully vaccinated.
8527,"Enough of the negative testing, people that are refusing vaccines shouldn’t be allowed to travel."

8550,If the overwhelming majority means 45% of the us population then yes.
8551,"It's also substantially less effective at preventing symptomatic illness with delta (only 67%), which means it's less effective on a population level of slowing spread and protecting the unvaccinated."
8552,The German Chancellor isn’t commander in chief.
8553,So it’s a different prioritization structure.
8554,"Also, given the misinformation that the US seems to be suffering from, having leadership set an example for senior citizens was critical."

8556,Yeah I wonder why.. it's not like we're getting out of a pandemic and some good news is nice for a change or something..

8581,"Once my kids are fully vaccinated then we might get back to some resemblance of normalcy, but until then we'll continue to avoid crowds, wear masks, and be very picky about who we invite into our home."
8582,Nobody’s stopping you from wearing an N95 during flu season.
8583,&gt; To me it sounds like its just as infectious as the original virus.
8584,"This is not what ""more infectious"" means."
8585,"The ""original"" version wasn't actually that infectious: it was sort of just about infectious enough to cause problems, but not much more than that."
8586,"If you were in prolonged close contact with an infectious person, you generally had well under a 10% chance of being infected."
8587,"When these variants are reported as being more infectious, they mean that that chance has gone up."
8588,"Oh, i'm positive it is."
8589,I just would like to have some solid data.

8610,"Ditto Moderna (we have given out some, but nowhere near enough to be statistically significant)."
8611,"You misunderstand what ""more infectuous"" means then."
8612,The delta variant is more infectuous than the alpha variant.
8613,That is a factual statement.
8614,And it does also infect vaccinated people to a slightly higher degree.
8615,Literally nothing will reduce your risk to 0%.
8616,"All of these vaccines reduce the risk of death quite dramatically, though."
8617,I'm hoping it will get scrapped before then.
8618,I could not imagine it possible extending *past* that date.
8619,"It's 96% effective at reducing hospitalisations, so if 1000 unvaccinated people got infected and 100 people were hospitalised, only 4 vaccinated people would be."
8620,"It's even more effective at preventing deaths, and in the UK where 99% of cases are now delta it has been shown that vaccinated people taken to hospitals have lower viral loads, are less likely to die and require less time in hospital."
8621,Not enough data to tell from this study.
8622,CureVac?
8623,It's not even approved in Germany or the EU or actually anywhere in the world.
8624,BioNTech?
8625,"That's the Pfizer vaccine which was developed by a German startup, but it's not low efficacy so you're probably not refering to this one?"
8626,"For her first shot, she chose AstraZeneca and now she received a dose of Moderna."
8627,It’s a shitshow
8628,The pandemic only causes problems because it hospitalises people.
8629,"If COVID-19 never hospitalised anybody, we probably would never have even noticed it, and wouldn't have cared if we had."
8630,"Thus, reduction in hospitalisation is directly the thing that we care about - that's what makes it a valid metric."
8631,"I'm not sure what else you'd think ""valid metric"" means other than ""measure of the thing we care about"", honestly."
8632,"At the time, vaccine in Germany was in very short supply and people were getting incredibly pissed off that the vaccination program was so far behind the UK and US, especially since BioNTech is a German company."
8633,You could only get vaccinated through an invitation code that was mailed to you if you were in the upper age group.
8634,"Then it was opened to a slightly younger age group and people with pre-existing conditions, which is when she got her dose."

8638,"They didn't mention anything about timeline, and I'd take ""public backlash"" all over again if it means getting that vaccine out the door faster to save lives."
8639,Immediate family members are allowed in as long as you provide proof of your relationship.
8640,That includes non-canadian spouses and common-law partners.
8641,My Scottish partner had no problem getting in.
8642,He also says in post 5 those deaths are concentrated in older people with waning immune systems or those who are immune compromised and did not receive full effectiveness of the vaccine
8643,"Yeah, that's always been a metric that we track."
8644,"Nobody makes large-scale vaccine decisions based on just one metric, of course, but that's one of the more important ones."
8645,"So ""listen to the experts/science"" isn't so simple any longer, is it?"

8952,Didn't realize they had done the rollout yet in UK.
8953,"Still dude, I've been desperate for updated Janssen info on the new variants from anywhere basically and latest I found was on the variants from India when shit was starting to get ugly there."
8954,&gt;If the threat of hospitalizations/death is incredibly low then we should be in a good spot.
8955,"I remember Covid becoming endemic or a mild illness was a clear goal

That's not really accurate."
8956,"The goal was to get rid of it, not to solidify it as a seasonal virus."
8957,The virus mutates incredibly quickly.
8958,Keeping low infection numbers is important to preventing it from out-mutating the efficacy of our vaccines.
8959,Frankly we should be trying to eradicate it all together.
8960,"Except for those with kids who can't be vaccinated yet, the immunocompromised [who alone number millions in this country alone], and the mutations and pockets of Covid they create that continue to infect everyone (even if at a reduced rate)."
8961,lakh isn't an english word either.
8962,lakh isn't an english word...it's hindi i believe.
8963,you should continue saying laksha because it's already an indian word.
8964,The landlords would be the ones suffering huge financial losses.
8965,The tenants are already broke.
8966,"That's not what they mean, it's not in addition to your protection from any symptomatic Covid."
8967,Almost all of the reduction in hospitalization comes from not getting Covid to begin with.
8968,"If you're vaccinated and get the Delta variant, you're around 40% less likely to be hospitalized from the early data we have."
8969,They'll doom themselves.
8970,The rest of us will be fine.
8971,Does anyone know how many vaccines they're currently giving weekly?
8972,"Lots of viruses can cause long term symptoms, it's not a new thing."
8973,COVID isn't a huge risk to younger people.
8974,What do you mean hurt anyone else?
8975,You can still catch and spread COVID if vaccinated...
8976,"Wonder how I'm gonna do with one dose of Pfizer and one Moderna, maybe I'm immune 🤔"
8977,Has there been any word on whether Moderna is effective against the Delta variant?
8978,"My father and I both got Moderna, and I’m worried he’s soon gonna tell me to “stay home as much as possible” again for the Delta variant."
8979,There is two sides to it really.
8980,There is factual reporting but then there is a headline that can be completely misinterpreted without properly reading the article.
8981,"There is also mostly only emphasis on negative news, which gets then also blown a bit out of proportion, while good news rarely gets reported on or stowed away at the end of an article."
8982,I think this is what most people are kind of fed up with now.
8983,"Like if I see a headline now saying, 'Delta is coming and its more infectious than any variant so far' then its like oh here we go again."
8984,"But then you look up the only question that matters, 'are vaccines effective against it' and find  out vaccines work completely fine against it."
8985,"So many people, myself included, are more done with the way reporting is done."
8986,"I can see how some people call that fearmongering, because in a way it is, even though most of it is factually correct."

8998,It's not a big deal for the vaccinated or for communities that are highly vaccinated or naturally immune.
8999,Having enough vaccinated adults will protect unvaccinated children in communities.

9006,Why make someone who isn't at risk get it?
9007,"Plus, if you get the vaccine, you can still catch COVID and get symptoms and also spread it."
9008,I get that fear.
9009,It’s reasonable.
9010,And we should (and are!)
9011,vaccinate the world as fast as possible to stop mutations.
9012,"But until a variant emerges that proves itself a serious threat to kids, we shouldn’t get too worked up about the risk to our children."
9013,"It’s fine to take reasonable precautions but we also need to let kids be kids, see their friends, attend in person school, etc."
9014,We can do a lot more damage to them by overreacting than covid would have.

9016,That Pfizer mounted a campaign to discredit AZ and their vaccine?

9019,A biologist's worst fears are drug-resistant bacteria and mutating viruses.
9020,This has been a long time coming.
9021,"The scary thing about having a decent proportion of the people vaccinated, but not *enough* people, is that if vaccinated people become infected and can also transmit the virus, we are selecting for more infectious variants."
9022,"Errors in reproduction, and recombination, can cause higher or lower virulence (severity of symptoms), higher or lower rate of transmission, including possible accumulation of genetic tools."
9023,"During flu season, this is of greater concern, because they can exchange genetic material."
9024,"Currently it is *not supported* that Covid 19 can insert itself into human DNA, but genetics isn't as clear cut as one might think."
9025,"Theoretically it is *possible*, based on the mechanisms of genetic replication, for DNA to be synthesized from a segment of viral RNA, and for that DNA to be mistakenly inserted into the human DNA."
9026,"It is *improbable*, but the more hosts, the more opportunities for the 1/100 million chance event to occur."
9027,"That doesn't mean that the insertion would necessarily do anything, depending on the size of the segment and where it inserts."
9028,"If Covid 19 ever got ahold of the coding for an enzyme to ""intentionally"" insert itself into our genome, or if someone is concurrently infected with a virus that contains that mechanism and recombination were to occur, we would be in huge trouble."
9029,"Also *not likely*, but *possible*."
9030,Yeah I know I was more just contributing that I’d had it I wasn’t actually aware it was going to be moderna until I showed up figured it was going to be Pfizer
9031,"31 counties in Missouri currently have over 20 new cases per 100,000 people per day (based on 7 day case average)."
9032,"Of those, none have more than a third of the population fully vaccinated and most have less than 25%."
9033,The US average is currently 45%.
9034,September is when they're applying for EUA.
9035,The committees are split on whether or not it's enough of an emergency in that age group.

9041,"For tenants who would have been able to pay, it benefits them, not the landlord; for tenants who would have been evicted, it benefits both the tenant and the landlord."
9042,I think the ideal move would have been for the state to pay around 90% and force landlords to waive the rest (in return for reducing their vacancy rate).

9052,"What I think is strange is that a lot of facilities have been approved by EMA lately to make this vaccine, however deliveries will actually decrease by 30-40% in July, meaning that most of the increase will be for export."
9053,Of course the whole planet needs this vaccine - but I think it’s strange that the EU did not at least manage to negotiate that the delivery speed should be at the June level at least until the initial 600M order has been completely delivered.
9054,This is same for Canada (Trudeau only has his first shot and was AZ too) and many other places.

9247,CDC did community seroprevalence surveys across the country and found X4 to X10 infections vs known positive tests.

9305,"That’s basically the band in my mind (alcohol is a choice; driving and breathing in air are not, though not getting vaccinated is a choice)."
9306,"We want to be closer to car deaths than alcohol, but we’re entering that band."
9307,"Now the caveat is that we saw a sizable drop last summer in cases and deaths, so we need to be concerned when we exit the summer months (Or, arguably for the south, when the summer months drive people indoors)."

9316,"So far the variants are kept in check with the vaccine (mostly) but if we lose our resolve to vaccinate any and all, there is the risk of a breakthrough strain that could restart the whole pandemic potentially with greater destruction."

9324,There is a difference between preventing hospitalizations and preventing COVID.
9325,"Two doses of Pfizer prevents 90-94% of COVID cases, which means that the hospitalization rate is significantly lower."
9326,96% prevention of hospitalization means that both doses are less effective at preventing COVID against the delta variant.
9327,One dose could be even less effective.
9328,"This means there are people still getting COVID delta and not going to the hospital, potentially spreading it."
9329,The second dose is necessary caution.
9330,"Yes, and unfortunately these people will have to continue to live like they have the past year and a half."
9331,I can’t help but feel you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.

9525,:)
9526,That’s false.
9527,Decades of data on how vaccines work and even more data on the immune system.
9528,Any ill side effects from vaccines are found very quickly after vaccination.
9529,That’s just the way immunity works.
9530,What who exactly is concerned with?
9531,"Public health officials sure, but the average person cares about hospitalisations and you know, not dying"
9532,[removed]
9533,"So, the study itself included both 1 dose and 2 doses as ""vaccinated."""
9534,"To not confuse anybody, I further broke out the 14+ days after 2nd dose day group as well."
9535,"Did I not do that well enough or something, to the point where you thought that you had to repeat what I just said?"
9536,"""More acxurately"" means that you think I wasn't accurate enough... but I specifically broke out the fully vaccinated group to highlight it."
9537,[deleted]
9538,The vaccine protects you from dying from it.
9539,It doesn’t magically make you immortal.
9540,Some people will only learn by fucking around and finding out.

9545,"Oh well, another variant fear monering over."
9546,Wonder when the next one will come.
9547,"Yeah, the US has significantly more to address than anti-vaxxers."
9548,"For example, lots of the unvaccinated don't want to miss work because of potential side effects or because they're scared they'll get an unexpected out-of-pocket charge:

You guys need mandatory paid vaccination leave ASAP."
9549,"Which is their vaccine trial actually failed, hope they act as quick as possible for other vaccine production like Pfizer"
9550,Good luck passing that.
9551,"Logistics would be hard (there's no centralized authority like the NHS administering shots), but actually getting that past the Senate would be nigh impossible."
9552,"In retrospect, maybe the American Rescue Plan money could've been contingent on vaccinations."
9553,True—She’s 66.
9554,"Is she healthy, though?"
9555,She seems to be.
9556,Trump is 75 and obese; Biden is 78 and has had a history of brain aneurysms.
9557,"The aneurysms probably don’t put you at greater risk, but he’s super old regardless."
9558,Hard to feel back at normal when only 34.8% of your states population is vaccinated sadly
9559,"We throw around the term “unconstitutional” a lot, but to my knowledge, nothing in the constitution would (clearly) prevent a vaccine mandate."
9560,"Depending on how you categorise Puerto Rico, it could actually be argued that there’s precedent for it."
9561,"That said, I know the difficulty that would be faced, and know they couldn’t physically force folks."
9562,Also aware of the whole can of worms that opens.
9563,You’re right about education though.
9564,"It’s a bit too late for current anti-vax adults, but hopefully the education system changes for the better sometime soon so science is accepted as truth over insane Facebook conspiracy theories."
9565,[removed]
9566,Get vaccinated.
9567,"So far, if one is full vaccinated there is nothing to worry about."
9568,Lots of speculation...
9569,"yeah wtf, that's a weird amount of significant figures, I can't believe they have an inaccuracy of the order of 0.01%"

9578,"I support these efforts, but I kinda think the early vaccine getters deserve something...there are places giving out beer, food, money, lotteries, etc for people who get vaccinated now...how about us?"
9579,"Oh, I agree with you."
9580,If the immune system is compromised it may not be able to mount a defense against either the actual virus or the vaccine.
9581,But the vaccine *may* provide a non-zero benefit to a percentage of immunocompromised people.
9582,"From a purely safety standpoint, I don't think the vaccine is any less safe for the immunocompromised, it's just less effective."

9584,I get the impression that honour has died in the US.
9585,We'll get a good boost when under 12s are approved and another boost when colleges start back up.
9586,Might also see full approval come with many workplaces mandating it.
9587,[deleted]
9588,Spain is doing it as well
9589,Stepping away from the narrative of just assuming so much about people who don’t want the vaccine here… and I asked a few people who aren’t vaxed.
9590,Overwhelming response was they dont see an immediate need for it that would preclude a wait and see approach.
9591,Much of this comes from the absolute dumpster fire the media has become over the last few years and most of them just don’t trust the message and definitely not the messengers.
9592,Even Joe and Kamalla said they would nor take a vaccine developed under Trump (or that he approved/pushed) and now they are pushing these same vaccines in an almost religious way.
9593,"Add in all the censorship of anything that does not follow the hard narrative, even if valid or one off issues and that total lack of transparency and shutting down any questions to the narrative even if it is obviously biased and political vs science based drives people (especially Americans) to be more resistant."
9594,The lack of government and media transparency is the primary driver from who I have talked to.
9595,"And given how many times the media has been caught blatantly lying to people, its a fair critique that you have to be indoctrinated in an ideology to not acknowledge."
9596,[removed]
9597,"Looked into the linked article, they found 94% for 1 dose of pfizer and 71% for 1 dose of AZ against hospitalization."
9598,"I'd be skeptical of that 94%, the confidence interval is 46%-99%."
9599,But one dose does seem to offer pretty strong protection against severe illness while a second dose for sure provides strong protection.
9600,"And, notably, the effectiveness of 1 dose of pfizer against symptomatic disease is only 36%."
9601,"You need that second dose, after which you're 88% against symptomatic disease."
9602,Did you even read every post he made?
9603,He says on post 5 the full vaccinated deaths are focused in older folks with waning immune systems or those immune compromised who did not receive full benefit of vaccinations stop fear mongering if you are fully vaccinated you have significant protection

9620,"&gt; so far only Canada has done so 

Germany also does it, actually Merkel did AZ first dose and got Moderna as second dose today

In Chile they decided to give Pfizer as second dose to the people that got AZ in the first dose (after one case of thrombosis they suspended the AZ to anyone younger than 45 or 50 around that, before it was suspended only to women)"
9621,It's a good thing Covid is the only communicable disease that has ever existed or will ever exist.

9623,"Absolutely, and we certainly have the means to do it if we keep the current pace of 35M+ doses administered per day."
9624,They write it on the pcr report

9626,Well sadly she passed away a few years ago.
9627,That’s actually a perfect example of a bad reason and not understanding risk.
9628,That's not how this is calculated.
9629,You compare the chance of hospitalization with and without the vaccine.

9641,"God damn it, I’m tired of my hometown continuously popping up for shit like this."
9642,Sweden resisted any covid regulations for a while.
9643,US Congressman even referred to the 'Swedish Model'.
9644,It looks like it bit them in the butt and they have the highest deaths per population of any of the other Nordic countries.
9645,"Lol, nothing."
9646,Thank your unvaccinated neighbors
9647,"Jeez dude, either that story is made up, you have no immune system to speak of and should be living in a bubble, or you need to stop tongue kissing every coughing homeless guy you run into"
9648,Ok and?
9649,I live in Norway were we barely have infections in comparison to the US but I've made a habit of wearing my mask in crowded places and regularly using antibac.
9650,"I don't mind, it makes me feel safe and protected when out."
9651,I don't want to catch the common cold either so I think it's brilliant that wearing a mask is so socially acceptable now.
9652,That's where you're wrong.
9653,I am not sure I understand your question but I believe the implications of the study are that being fully vaccinated (ie.
9654,both doses) is a good idea to limit your risk of serious illness from the delta variant
9655,It's running rampant in the unvaccinated or partly vaccinated age groups.
9656,We need to get the majority fully vaccinated.
9657,[removed]
9658,[removed]
9659,No one is masking or social distancing here either.
9660,It's as if they think it just went away!!
9661,My son caught covid in November from school.
9662,I know it's not anything to be messed with.
9663,"You are not that guy pal, you are not that guy!"
9664,I am from India whose whole family has recovered from delta variant.All of us have had our first shot.I cann say with 100% AZ (Covisheild) is efficient in averting death/hospitalisation and putting an end to this pandemic.
9665,Both AZ and mRNA can almost guarantee no deaths (albeit less chance of getting infected for mRNA based).
9666,Would a Moderna/Pfizer vaccinated immune system attack the spike?
9667,"The latter, probably."
9668,It's gonna become the fifth human coronavirus and can be added to the list of the other 200 Common Cold viruses.

9671,"As soon as our plant went mask no required for vaccinated and they weren’t going to ask if you’ve been vaccinated, the amount of mask usage dropped instantly."
9672,Over 1000 people on site with only a few handfuls of people wearing masks.
9673,In South Carolina.
9674,This is going to get ugly.
