64,"Besides, they're bootstraps are there for the pulling."
65,"With no end goal, I‚Äôm really worried they‚Äôre just going to linger on and on."
66,There needs to be a vaccination or hospital capacity or SOME form of metric to ending masks.
67,The strictest cities are often the highest vaccinated anyway so it‚Äôs all just kind of useless.
68,We can‚Äôt just keep forcing them indefinitely.

125,From the pfizer study it goes from 80 to 2000.
126,Not really true.
127,"It could've been when ""Women must stay at home and take care of their kids"" was the general thought of *eveyone*."
128,But the Church is very pro education.
129,"The family is the center of the teachings of the Church so it is also very important and women can be pressured by their local leaders, family, etc to sacrifice their education to instead have children."

153,"To me it's funny that they're willing to disobey the church leaders over this because they never complain about free agency when they're told which drinks to drink, which underwear to wear, or which gender to love."
154,And freedom never crosses their mind when they try to push most of that stuff on non-members.

168,The average Catholic can live their life however they want.
169,Cults like Mormonism differ because they have to adhere to strict social and lifestyle rules or face being excommunicated by the church and have your family and friends stop speaking with you.

190,&gt;If there is going to be another dangerous variant its most likely going to come from where all the others have come from: somewhere other than the unvaccinated in the USA.
191,There's nothing that prevents the next dangerous variant from arising in the US.
192,Literally any infected person can be the source of a mutation that becomes a threat.
193,We've already identified several mutations that likely evolved within the United States it has been sheer luck that they haven't been a threat.
194,If the US doesn't get its caseloads under control then the likelihood of a variant of concern evolving increases.
195,Worse yet having a vaccinated population in close contact with a highly infectious population increases the odds of a variant that escapes the vaccines will evolve.
196,Every effort to get the US population vaccinated to the level of herd immunity asap should be a priority given the absolute failure to control the virus by any other means.

292,*
293,Am I allowed to focus on the silver lining that deaths aren't anywhere near as high as they were when cases got this high in the winter?
294,Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective and Israel did a good job over the last year and a half to protect its citizens from becoming infected.
295,"The downside to this is - with vaccines that are somewhere between 50%-80% effective and a reproductive rate of 5-7, you now have a disease that can not be eliminated via herd immunity."
296,Covid transmission will slow to a very manageable level once 90%-95% of people have some level of protection(from vaccination or Infection).
297,This creates a really difficult situation for places like Australia.
298,A seemingly massive exit wave is  unavoidable for y‚Äôall unless we develop new vaccines that bring the efficacy back up to the 90%-95% range.
299,"I saw people wear their mask improperly, and you can see a wide gap around their nose."
300,A mask mandate is still good combined with physical distance and reduced gathering crowd.
301,A data analyst somewhere waited their entire career to make that visualization.
302,"The CDC really needs to pay more attention to some of the social sciences, and experts in human psychology."
303,I find it difficult to believe any experts in those fields wouldn‚Äôt have predicted what would happen after the change in mask guidance.
304,The pandemic moves much more quickly than they seem to.
305,They dismissed any recommendations for better quality masks and their information on N95s is outdated (there‚Äôs no need to reserve them for healthcare workers anymore when N95 manufacturers are laying off staff due to low demand).

314,The Israeli data that shows Pfizer to not be very effective against infections still shows 88% effectiveness against hospitalization.
315,"Meanwhile the latest J&amp;J data shows only 71% effectiveness against hospitalization, so your chances of being hospitalized are over twice that with J&amp;J than Pfizer's."
316,"Somehow, this is being reported in the news as ""New data suggest J."
317,&amp; J. vaccine works against Delta and recipients don‚Äôt need a booster shot.
318,""", which I can only imagine is propaganda because they are still trying to make J&amp;J sound enticing to people who aren't vaccinated yet."
319,"I can easily see an argument for not needing boosters as it is over the 50% threshold that health organizations use for recommending vaccines, but I think outright saying that boosters aren't needed when the data shows those people are at more than twice the risk for a breakthrough hospitalization is disingenuous."

666,Now they are back to wearing masks indoors with vaccinated friends.
667,The was really the result of a few people getting covid after being vaccinated.
668,Hard to judge recent data from my county because it tends to be incomplete.
669,But it looks like rates peaked two weeks ago.
670,After reading this‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to continue living until I see a sequel to the South Park ‚ÄúBay Area‚Äù episode with this exact plot ending with this woman shouting ‚ÄúI just want to still be able to inhale my farts!‚Äù

672,Eating meals that you've prepared and cooked in your own residence is safer and healthier!
673,Cut down on salt!
674,No they aren't founded.
675,"If OP is vaccinated, the others are vaccinated, it's been almost two weeks, and there are no ongoing symptoms, there is no recommendation to continue quarantining (that's actually regardless of vaccination status)."
676,Negative test is not required and as they mentioned you can continue to test positive for some time while being completely free of viable virus.
677,"Of course, people can keep their distance if they choose."
678,But there is no reason OP should remain in any kind of quarantine and should rather feel free to partake in public life at this point.
679,"If they start Fauci ice cream trucks, I will be very sad."
680,In a tent on a playing field.
681,"I've recently thought about it, since correlation =/ causation - could it be that most people on the vents are fat because most of them are old and the majority of older people are obese or at least overweight?"
682,I found one study and the median age was 65...
683,I don‚Äôt even live there.
684,"But I noticed after the surf side collapse, the press conferences Clearly looked like everyone was just peer pressured to not wear masks anymore."
685,"Obviously the whole vaccine reduced the mask usage too, but it didn‚Äôt feel like it was that whole looking at those press conferences."

696,We have a lot to be thankful for in our life.
697,Florida attributes the death to the day the death happened and worldometer reports for the current day.

706,"But I fancied the thought of the nsa using massive data branching tech and correlating with peoples locations/positivity about, how many likely died or became sick because of you being anti mask, and anti lockdown earlier on etc."
707,Just a shower thought though.
708,Really?
709,Then pay your nurses and doctors what they are worth then they wouldn't have to go to other countries to find work.
710,The US is not the only country accepting skilled medical labor.
711,According to that graph white people are smaller and less affected.
712,The coloured are bigger thus more vulnerable.
713,This study you replied was just to establish the histopathological reason why covid would cause ED.
714,They took penile tissue out of 4 guys and looked at it under the microscope.
715,The OP which shows the rate of ED (9% vs 28%) is based on a large group of men with a control that shows the prevalence of ED but says nothing about the underlying anatomic/chemical cause.
716,"‚ÄúThe media‚Äù
It‚Äôs all over this sub too."
717,I'm not a doctor or expert.
718,"But I don't think the vaccine is particularly effective if you get it the same time you have COVID, especially if you are already symptomatic."
719,Bear in mind that lots of people get flu like symptoms just from the vaccine over the first day or two after receiving it.
720,So it could just be that.
721,The media is not making it easier by focusing on vaccinated people in hospitals and breakthrough infections and vaccinated people infecting others.

733,Thank you for the well wishes!
734,I normally get a fairly mild sinus infection once per year and it‚Äôs pretty much felt like‚Ä¶that.
735,But my sense of taste and smell are absolutely decimated which pisses me of to no end.
736,"Or international airports, right?"
737,That antivaxxer who spread the disease and offered themselves up to breed variants may have already or may yet unwittingly kill a dozen people or more from infections.
738,"More likely, if they were able to convince a number of people to also be anti-vaxxers along the way, start multiplying their culpability."
739,At least the spear gun guy stopped at killing 2.
740,It really is.
741,Deeply depressing for me personally just to know what could be.
742,And then maddening when I think about how a strong majority of the few of us educated enough to see the truth have instead decided to use their powers to manipulate and enable everyone else‚Äôs fantasy‚Äôs.
743,I feel like I‚Äôm doomed to be trapped between the idiots and the psychopaths and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it.
744,I think you‚Äôre right.
745,"I‚Äôm in AZ and didn‚Äôt realize this state is only at 46% fully vaccinated, even lower than FL, and viewing the map of vaccination percentages across the country, we are in for a bad fall/winter."
746,‚òπÔ∏è
747,This is because we are fucking stupid!

752,"No mask, no social distancing, nothing."
753,Most people really believe its fake!
754,And the vaccine kills.
755,"I wanna move, im a rational person and I cant be surrounded by conspiracy theorist anymore."
756,"That's not very nice, but ok, here's an upvote for a good roast."
757,"Any international airport is a port of entry and needs border services, I'd think"
758,The Delta variant has also been shown to be pretty good at infecting the vaccinated and these infected individuals in turn are able to pass it on to other vaccinated ones.
759,I mean a lot of them might want the south to rise again‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs a good lesson
760,Turned 41 this year.
761,I completely forgot about mine this year.
762,Literally forgot until like 10:30AM and I was up at like 7:30AM.
763,Shutt upp
764,"And every ""I don't live in fear forever"" shithead would go to the ER the moment they got sick."
765,Did no one ever figure out how to make a decent see-through mask?
766,"I know there were some available at the beginning of the pandemic when I looked because I was wondering about how that would work with people who needed to read lips, but none of them got really great reviews, at least not back then when I was looking."
767,"There are face shields, but that's not as much protection as even a cloth mask, probably."
768,I understand their hesitation.
769,The more Biden is involved the more their base is going to push back.

774,"my county has a mask mandate, i wouldnt if if there wasnt though"
775,"Maybe like 15-20% around me, if that."
776,And everyone wore them during the mandate and it took like a month after it was gone for the percentage to drop under 50.
777,You have bodily autonomy.
778,You do not have the right to go to a bar.
779,"It is a totally sensible regulation to ban unvaccinated people from bars, especially since the alternative is shutting down bars."
780,Got a source?
781,"Shh, this sub doesn't like it when you mention this fact."
782,"If you got infected today, the vaccine would have no protective effect against it, but the infection would have no negative effect on the vaccination either."

789,(Edit: I'm in Georgia and it's not required in the gym but our transmission is so high that I'm back to wearing it again.
790,"Grudgingly, but."
791,The gyms are anywhere from 10-20% masked.)
792,No one is wearing masks.
793,"I went to Subway and there were about 8 people there, and not even the staff were wearing masks."
794,Of course not.
795,That would dent their profits which so-called liberals and progressives are suddenly so desperate to protect.
796,"&gt;In 1902, following a smallpox outbreak, the board of health of the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, mandated all city residents to be vaccinated against smallpox."
797,City resident Henning Jacobson refused vaccination on the grounds that the law violated his right to care for his own body how he knew best.
798,"In turn, the city filed criminal charges against him."
799,"After losing his court battle locally, Jacobson appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court."
800,"In 1905 the Court found in the state‚Äôs favor, ruling that the state could enact compulsory laws to protect the public in the event of a communicable disease."

818,I got really cooked on psychedelics and thought about my mycoplasma pneumonia hospitalization and also watched this https://youtu.be/vz2HdqMGiiI
819,Keep wearing a mask.
820,This is the best and safest thing you can do.
821,It's affordable and easy.
822,Pretty fine with strapped them down and injecting at this point.
823,"The article specifies that, at least at this particular hospital, all hospitalizations have been unvaccinated people."

838,Thanks for the heads up.
839,How‚Äôd it go?
840,How ya feeling?
841,Hey Just to clarify.
842,The study is new but the data you're quoting is actually from studying the Alpha variant.
843,So we really do need to confirm those numbers again with the Delta variant.
844,Especially with the limited data we have from P-town.
845,Hopefully the add'l  data comes soon.
846,It is nuanced.
847,"I‚Äôm sorry that you don‚Äôt understand that, but it‚Äôs not my problem."
848,I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine being irritated at trying to discuss all the aspects of a problem though.

868,I don't think the person I replied to said anything about a doctor advising against getting a vaccine.
869,"You are correct , it is zip codes."
870,In the the north east (Where I am at) there are whole counties with low vaccinated rates Right next to each othen.
871,Why stop at Covid?

880,Even if the singular source isn't found the branches from that source could be.
881,"Point is, we don't wait three months until there's ""high transmission"" to start reacting with mask mandates again."
882,Rather we take measures to keep the outbreak localized and deal with it there and get rid of it surgically.

884,"I'm probably one of the ""unlucky few""."
885,"Healthy, late 30s, was active (lots of running &amp; road cycling)."
886,I had a mild case of covid and I've had chest pain for almost 10 months so far after the acute disease.
887,"One friend of mine is a triathlete, late 20s and had a stroke from covid."
888,Odds are most people will be fine but I guess you just never know.
889,In my humble opinion and I'm not a doctor of course so please dismiss what I say as not relevant.
890,I think if we have a crowd of vaccinated people the spread will be lower in a high group of people.
891,But if one person is unvaccinated that person catches it and they spread it.
892,I know we all can.
893,But that unvaccinated person is at greater risk to catch and spread it.
894,And not to be judgemental but I will be I think vaccinated people are more likely to hang out with only vaccinated people while unvaccinated just don't care.
895,So people would feel more comfortable being in a place with only vaccinated people.
896,I think it goes beyond vaccinated and unvaccinated.
897,It's more how serious you take this.
898,If you are vaccinated you take more precautions.
899,If unvaccinated you take less.
900,Sorry for rambling I am drinking and trying to explain.
901,Did what I say make sense?
902,"Consider the fact that even if you get infected, as a vaccinated person, your likelihood of ending up hospitalized is extremely low."
903,That's good for everyone because hospitals are already overflowing in many areas.
904,"If everyone were vaccinated but still getting infected, at least there would still be room in the hospitals for noncovid patients."
905,Good luck if you get into a car accident in an area with low vaccination rates right now.
906,Agreed.
907,Children and vaccinated patients should be the highest priority.
908,They probably also have the best potential outcomes as well.
909,"Being a healthy BMI and doing recommend amounts of cardio, not eating the SAD are all going to help."
910,You can weaken your immune system by being too lean and running marathons.
911,Most people are not in danger of getting so fit their health suffers.
912,He does remind me a lot of Erich Honecker.
913,I would agree with mandating it on everyone who doesn‚Äôt have a medical condition that prevents them.
914,They will die.
915,They will die in droves.
916,Or are HIV positive?
917,How are lifetime costs relevant?
918,It‚Äôs yearly/monthly cost.
919,That's crazy.
920,"Good, but crazy."
921,"If I was vehemently against doing something, $50 wouldn't make me change my mind."
922,Literally never.
923,The only time I was diagnosed with the flu I wound up bedridden for the week.
924,Like I was in physical anguish getting up and walking.
925,I was 21 at the time and it still kicked my ass.
926,I'm so glad I didn't get swine flu as I heard that was even more intense.
927,"COVID scares me, and while I'm glad the vaccine will probably keep me out of the hospital, there's still a lot of room for extremely unpleasant sick days."
928,So presumably everyone who has HIV because they had unprotected sex should be denied coverage too?
929,"Or let me guess, that's somehow ""different""?"
930,Because it's something the states handle.
931,There are state databases for tracking vaccines.
932,"But whether it's the state or federal government collecting the data, I don't want my local Walmart greeter looking me up when I enter the store."
933,Or for Disney to have access to everyone's vaccine data so they can monitor who is vaccinated at their parks.
934,It‚Äôs more like a pilot who doesn‚Äôt believe in remaining seated with your belt on‚Ä¶instead runs around the cabin on autopilot.
935,Lifestyle choices and pre existing conditions aren‚Äôt the same thing.
936,I mean I think it's just a matter of time before it's worse everywhere.
937,"Pa only has like 3.5 percent more people than Florida vaccinated and although we didn't ban mandates, were not doing much different at the moment."
938,Where did she go?
939,Do you think we changed her mind?
940,My daughter is 3.
941,She has a congenital condition that increases her risk of complications from respiratory illnesses.
942,"She was on continuous oxygen for a year, along with oxygen saturation monitoring."
943,And we were getting monoclonal antibody injections (Synagis for RSV) before everyone was taking about monoclonal antibodies.
944,I‚Äôm furious with the FDA.
945,I really hope the AAP does end up being the voice of reason.
946,They have all the time for Facebook and OAN

964,"The website estimated the charge of an out-of-network/uninsured price for a typical COVID-19 hospitalization in Tampa at more than $62,000 and an in-network charge for COVID-19 hospitalization in Tampa at more than $36,000."

983,Personally speaking I got it for the same reason.
984,I didn't care about me.
985,I cared about my community.
986,If I got the vaccine and helped others I was happy to.
987,I did hear that one doctor Lena Wenn(not sure about spelling) she made a great case about the vaccines.
988,That town in Massachusetts was why they said we should all mask again.
989,She did the math and everything and made the vaccine make sense again.
990,"She said and I could be wrong that there were about 40,000 people in the town partying like it was 2019."

992,And 700 got sick.
993,4 hospitalizations.
994,It was a stress test for the vaccine and it held up.
995,I was down on the vaccine and she resold me on it.
996,It' not really logical though.

1061,"&gt;In  this  report,  we  provide  evidence  of  COVID-19  in the  human  penis  long  after  the  initial  infection."
1062,Our study  also  suggests  that  endothelial  dysfunction  from COVID-19  infection  can  contribute  to  resultant  ED.
1063,"Vascular  integrity  is  necessary  for  erectile  function, and  endothelial  damage  associated  with  COVID-19  is likely  to  affect  the  penile  vascular  flow,  resulting  in impaired  erectile  function."
1064,"We  could  not  detect  viral protein  in  penis  tissue  by  immunohistology,  possibly  due to  comparably  low  viral  RNA  load  in  the  penis."
1065,This result  was  not surprising  since  recent studies  show  that COVID-19  isolation  is  unlikely  from  samples  with  low RNA  loads [4].
1066,H&amp;E  staining  from  our  specimens  did  not show  significant  results  compared  to  previous  studies  in which  COVID-19  infection  caused  mild  to  moderate  accumulation  of  lymphomonocytic  inflammatory  cells  in  a perivascular  or  subendothelial  distribution  [5].
1067,Based  on the  current  findings  we  can  draw  two  hypotheses  about how  the  SARS-CoV-2  virus  can  lead  to  the  ED.
1068,"First, similar  to  other  complications  related  to  COVID-19,  of ED  can  be  the  result  of  systemic  infection  resulting  in widespread  endothelial  dysfunction."
1069,This  is  supported by  our  findings  of  endothelial  dysfunction  seen  in  men with  COVID  and  ED.
1070,"Second,  we  can  also  hypothesize that  the  worsening  of  these  patient‚Äôs  ED  can  be  due  to the  virus‚Äô  presence  within  cavernosal  endothelium  itself."
1071,This  is  best  supported  by  our  findings  with  TEM.
1072,The  primary  limitation  of  this  study  were  the  sample size  (n=2)  and  lack  of  objective  quantification  of  erectile function  before  and  after  infection  for  patients  and  controls.
1073,"For  now,  history  of  COVID-19  should  be  included in  the  work-up  of  ED  and  positive  findings  should  be investigated  accordingly."
1074,Patients  should  be  aware  of the  potential  complication  of  post-COVID-19  ED.
1075,Any changes  observed  in  erectile  function  after  infection should  be  followed  up with  the  appropriate  specialist for  treatment  and  to  help further  investigation  into  the condition.
1076,Future  studies  are  needed  to  validate  the  effects  of  this  virus  on  sexual  function.
1077,Most N95 masks you see are probably also made in China.
1078,History will view him as an incompetent idiot whose total lack of action regarding COVID has directly caused unnecessary deaths.

1096,Idk intended on getting it much earlier but ended up always being overwhelmed.
1097,"And to be honest, I feel like my brain still thinks it's March 2020."
1098,Most are doing well so far.
1099,The main concern is Hawaii which has one of the highest vaccination rates yet hospitals are getting overwhelmed right now.
1100,The Southern states (i.e.
1101,"Texas, Mississippi, Florida) are hot and humid during the summer so people spend most of their time indoors which might contribute to the spread."
1102,We will see what happens in the other states (both highly and lowly vaxxed) in the winter when everyone gathers indoors.
1103,"UK peaked in Delta cases, went down some, not all, and is starting to rise again."
1104,Deaths in the UK have been on a steady rise since a bit before hitting the peak.
1105,The crappy thing about COVID is that you can‚Äôt draw a long term trend line.
1106,"Sure it might have peaked for now, that does not mean it is over."
1107,"I'm sorry, but social distancing is a lot more effective than just ""wearing a mask""."
1108,"We've had remote learning, restaurants and bars closed, no audience on music concerts or sporting events."
1109,These are all much more effective than wearing a mask to the grocery store.
1110,It hasn‚Äôt burnt itself out in the uk.

1137,I fully expect this to make the rounds on Breitbart and Alex Jones soon.
1138,"You heard it first here, folks"
1139,"They will, but the difference between how much of the vulnerable population is fully vaccinated is massive."
1140,The Northeast is 97% vaccinated for the elderly.
1141,The south is at 80.
1142,The number is in the low 70s in some counties.
1143,"That number is massively predictive of deaths, and hospitalizations, to a lesser extent."
1144,"It's why the uk did better than the south, because it's uptake was so high that it's elderly were fully vaccinated, when with a pool of youth."
1145,"That, and an actual lockdown of course."
1146,"the ""case"""
1147,Sadly no.
1148,I get dirty looks every time I go out and at least once a week I get some whacko harassing me about wearing a mask.
1149,I‚Äôm near Tampa :/
1150,It was never whole to begin with
1151,Nope.
1152,I live in a more liberal part of Florida too.
1153,Last year up until around this time actually people wore masks but since august last year there‚Äôs been a significant decline.
1154,"Especially after the govenor dropped the mask mandate and the cdc said you didn‚Äôt need one if vaccinated, there was a period of a few months where I was practically the only masked person in stores."
1155,Things are packed as always though I don‚Äôt go out.
1156,But I will say the past few weeks I‚Äôve seen a bit more mask usage but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs like 30% people masking and 70% people not masking up.
1157,Funny enough since the mandate ended I haven‚Äôt seen many people wearing it with their nose out.
1158,"Me and everyone here I care about are vaccinated, most mask up though some don‚Äôt."
1159,"So I‚Äôm fine, I don‚Äôt go out as it is anyways.. majority of the stores I go into employees aren‚Äôt required to wear masks so it‚Äôs a bit of a shitshow."
1160,Help :( I hate it here.
1161,Every time I go out I get at least 1 guy who looks like you‚Äôd expect giving me a dirty look because of masks I assume and once a week about for months I‚Äôve been harassed about wearing a mask..
1162,"True, because we all sane people know that those with short weewees act all entitled and important and refuse to get vaccinated."
1163,"They need to, else they wouldn't feel manly with only their short tool."
1164,They could but there's records of vaccination.
1165,My doctor had it electronically when I went for the first time after my 2nd shot.
1166,I got the vaccination through AZ state not my doctor's but they pulled it up np.
1167,So may not be as easy as faking a vaccination card
1168,It's 'human season' for covid in Florida
1169,Just like how they lied about having the vaccine as an excuse to prance about maskless.
1170,"And now here we are again, except sort of worse than before."

1205,"it's not like obesity was cured and that's why covid response was improved; obesity is one case where it is really needed, that's why they mention it, it wasn't the focus."
1206,"the conditions in an obese person are worse than normal people so they benefit even more from KD, it's not about losing weight while fighting covid."
1207,"non-obese also benefit from KD, one of the key take aways:

&gt;Karagiannis et al."
1208,"[22] demonstrated that restricting dietary glucose by feeding mice a HFKD (72% fat, 2.4% sugar) largely ablates lung-resident type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC-2) and reduces airway inflammation by impairing fatty acid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets."
1209,"Chronic activation of ILCs, typical of allergenic airway inflammation, needs exogenous fatty acids which are transiently stored in lipid droplets and therefore converted into phospholipids to promote ILCs proliferation."
1210,"This metabolic program, imprinted by IL-33 and regulated by the genes Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Œ≥) and Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1), is controlled by glucose availability as well as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling."
1211,"Moreover, Goldberg et al."
1212,"reported that a HFKD allows for better survival and increased protective IL-17-secreting Œ≥Œ¥ T cells in the lungs of mice with influenza virus [10], while Ryu et al."
1213,"have recently provided preclinical evidence that a HFKD is capable of providing a protective effect against the animal equivalent of COVID-19 in aged mice, with the maintenance of a better oxygen saturation and an increase in Œ≥Œ¥ T cells"
1214,It's basic triage and priorities.
1215,If you only have one lung and two people who need it you give it to the person with the genetic defect and not the 2 pack a day smoker.

1265,We had smallpox plaguing the world for centuries and it doesn't seem to ever have become less of a problem until we defeated it with vaccines.
1266,"This isn't to say that covid is anything comparable or that it *won't* become less deadly over time, but people seem to have fallen into thinking that these things run on a set track."

1326,Typically ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections are upper respiratory.
1327,&gt;We have not done a good job of communicating to the press or the public the concept that limited nasal infection may occur in vaccinated individuals.
1328,Understanding the regional aspects (upper versus lower respiratory tract) of vaccine effectiveness are key to ensure public confidence in the vaccines as well as to help the public understand the need to continue adhering to public health mitigation recommendations.
1329,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/151186
1330,Delta has been around for 6 months and we haven‚Äôt adapted the vaccine to it still.
1331,I thought MRNa would allow more rapid development of vaccines for variants.
1332,And insured.
1333,*That's* got to be how we reach these people.

1335,Insurance companies need to charge more to be covered if you're unvaccinated.
1336,A Virus doesn't give a fuck about antibiotics.
1337,You use antibiotics for bacteria.
1338,Covid is not a bacterial infection.
1339,Just like you would need to use antifungal meds for fungal infections.
1340,You would need antivirals for Covid and we don't have any that work..
1341,But those people wouldn't understand the difference anyway.

1348,"He‚Äôll lose more voters changing course than letting 5,000 or so people die and that‚Äôs the sad truth."
1349,I was annoyed by how difficult it was to understand this title so for anyone else‚Äî parents of high risk 12-15yr olds are upset with how long it is taking to get those children vaccinated.
1350,Looks like Australia is attempting to do the same.

1377,Compared to about 30% of unvaccinated.
1378,So isn't that the bigger issue?
1379,Not only for rona but a shitload of other health problems
1380,When did you think that?
1381,In March 2020 people were fighting over toilet paper supplies.
1382,There is no end game.
1383,That's the problem.
1384,"There is no visible plan or goal here, apparently, except ""let the virus spread""."
1385,Millions of people have died around the world and yet a small percent of people are still stuck in this weird state of denial because they've politicized a virus and refuse to accept that a disease doesn't care who its host is so long as it can spread.
1386,It's beyond bizarre at this point.

1395,"Basically, it was the perfect stress test for the effectiveness of vaccines."

1397,"Only 4 hospitalizations, and relatively low number of positive cases compared to the overall number of people there who were in tight crowded spaces."
1398,[removed]
1399,Florida is at it's highest hospitalization rate ever.
1400,Remember when Florida was offered up as proof that covid wasn't so bad in summer and we overreacted?

1413,People die struggling to breathe.
1414,It‚Äôs an awful death.

1416,‚Ä¶and this is why it‚Äôs infuriating that the CDC keeps saying booster shots aren‚Äôt needed and that breakthrough cases are only affecting .01% of vaccinated people.
1417,"I get why they are putting out this messaging, but it‚Äôs not helping."
1418,Too many people (understandably) don‚Äôt understand just how quickly Delta is spreading.
1419,WTF almost half the ICU is covid...
1420,I think you might have a problem...
1421,Interesting to see if the very high vaccination rates will be enough to prevent uncontrollable spikes in infections.
1422,I know more people who have had breakthrough cases than people who caught it without the vaccine (since most people I know pefrsonally and at work where pretty good about getting it).
1423,It is a lot of people -  why do they insist on calling breakthroughs rare when they are not ?
1424,The civil war was the prelude to WW1 in a lot of ways.
1425,This.
1426,Breakthroughs are certainly possible.
1427,No question about that.
1428,But it's still 3-7 times less likely for a vaccinated person to get infected.
1429,This will help slow the spread and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.
1430,Being vaccinated helps flatten the curve.
1431,"The real question here, will I be allowed outside by then??"
1432,?
1433,"they're probably being downvoted (not me) because they said the *'vaccine alone isn't enough to keep the spread of delta contained'* which ya know, **IT IS** but people have to actually go and take the medicine for that to happen."
1434,What would he be doing differently if he actively wanted people to die?
1435,The weird thing about the civil war is societies in the past have successfully dealt with traitors but we just let them go.
1436,[deleted]
1437,If someone is that small minded.
1438,All vaccines carry a risk that‚Äôs much much much lower than the chances of getting the disease.
1439,Apparently a lot of ya are shit gamblers.
1440,I would take the 99.5% odds of not dying anyday.
1441,And I would take the .001% chance of Gillian-bar .
1442,How is one to be careful getting the vaccine?
1443,"You go get it , it‚Äôs done."
1444,I got Jand J as soon as I could and didn‚Äôt whine like a witttle baby.
1445,I joked about starting a rumour saying covid causes erectile dysfunction on facebook and got about 20 hate messages
1446,"Smokers dont pay more, fast food eaters dont pay more... Yeah, thats absolut stupid."
1447,What is the end game here?
1448,Is it that he just can‚Äôt admit that he was wrong and things are getting bad?
1449,Are they willing to let people get sick and potentially die because they are stubborn?
1450,Come on man!
1451,!
1452,"Probably due to blood vessel inflammation caused by long covid and poor circulation , easily fixed with medicinal cannabis edible form obviously to prevent long covid symptoms as the bulk of the symptoms are due to the inflammation."
1453,"Personal opinion edibles do definitely help while you have covid or just ill in general and you probably want the immune suppression and cytokine suppression for obvious reasons , dont want a cytokine storm or a overactive immune system to smack you silly."
1454,Any idea what the Covid death rate will be in 2028?
1455,&gt; (there‚Äôs no need to reserve them for healthcare workers anymore when N95 manufacturers are laying off staff due to low demand).
1456,"This is why I recommend the N95 to people, that KN95 is made in China, to a Chinese standard."
1457,"In normal times, they wouldn't have even recommended that because it doesn't meet NIOSH standards but in the beginning it was better than nothing."
1458,"It will probably get there, but it will get there a lot slower in places like Vermont or Massachusetts."
1459,"While breakthrough cases certainly happen common enough, you are still 3-7 fold less likely to be infected."
1460,That will slow the spread.
1461,"Eh, the western Pennensula and coastal area is pretty much the same, just with mold and vitamin D deficiencies."
1462,Absolutely
1463,This simply did not have to happen.
1464,I blame gutless politicians.
1465,*Rikers Island has entered the chat*
1466,I‚Äôd like to add - take a look at Iceland they are one of the most vaccinated countries in the world and they are seeing a case increase.
1467,I still suspect there is a lot we don‚Äôt know about how these waves play out.
1468,The good news is people in Iceland seem to think they are on the cusp of being done with Corona and this is just infecting the 20% or so left.
1469,"Edit to add from an article from the daily beast 

‚ÄúThe 20 percent of Icelanders who didn‚Äôt get vaccinated or haven‚Äôt already had COVID are the ones now catching Delta, with the exception of a few breakthrough cases of vaccinated people."
1470,"(Children under 16, who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination, make up most of the unvaccinated group.)"
1471,"A couple thousand people have tested positive in recent weeks, a spike in cases far exceeding the worst weekly case-rates from 2020."
1472,But hospitalizations have not surged to the same degree as cases in this latest Icelandic surge.
1473,"That‚Äôs because older Icelanders, as a group, are highly vaccinated."
1474,"Younger people, who as a group are less vaccinated, are the ones getting infected now."
1475,They have a better chance of weathering COVID without serious symptoms.
1476,And the antibodies and T-cells their immune systems are producing could represent the last‚Äîor close to last‚Äîbrick in Iceland‚Äôs wall of immunity.‚Äù
1477,But shouldn‚Äôt vaccines + natural immunity eventually provide a decent level of protection?
1478,"When that happens across the world, will we really have much risk from variants?"
1479,"It is not 19% of the vaccinated healthcare workers, it is 19% of the vaccinated people who developed infections."
1480,7 / 1497 = 0.47% of the vaccinated healthcare workers... and healthcare workers spend more time in close proximity to covid patients shedding lots of viruses.
1481,"So I suspect that this is a worse than average scenario, but I 100% agree that everyone needs to vaccinate, mask up, and practice social distancing to the extent that they can."
1482,"You're saying ""don't trust current science because science changes""."
1483,You're right for the wrong reasons.
1484,"Trust science now, and also trust when they have more data to make better educated decisions."
1485,i feel like you talking about someone like David Goggins vs the average competitive athlete vs the average person that participates in endurance events.
1486,Very different amounts of stress.
1487,No.
1488,Vaccines are next to impossible to get here.
1489,"Luckily, thanks to low obesity in Africa, our death rate is only about 0.01% from Covid."
1490,Malaria still kills 0.02% every year.
1491,How to stop this?
1492,I‚Äôm dealing with parents who are freaked out that in two years the vaccine is programmed to kill the host.
1493,I wish I were joking.
1494,Yes.
1495,e.g.
1496,most people with herpes never develop symptoms
1497,Yes!
1498,"Please feel free to join me in emailing Pzfizer, Moderna, the FDA, the president, and the HHS."
1499,Too many people in the community are not protecting kids under 12 through masking and vaccinating!
1500,"Schools are opening, hospitals are filling up."
1501,We need Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for children under 12.
1502,Covid erectile dysfunction has been reported a few times already.
1503,Apparently people aren't taking it seriously.
1504,"This might be the first study about it, definitely the first one that I have seen."
1505,Sample size is too small to be very convincing.
1506,"For the majority of these unvaccinated people they think it's ""just a bad cold."""
1507,So stay home and deal with it.
1508,I suppose some people could be genetically immune to COVID like some people are to HIV.
1509,But we have no way to know that right now.
1510,So the vaccine is the best bet.
1511,I have both as well.
1512,My 12 year old is an early puberty kid.
1513,"But I look at some of his friends, and they don‚Äôt look all that different from my 10 year old."
1514,There is such a huge range!

1521,"If breakthrough cases are more frequent as some data suggest (Israel) after some time has passed, that 19% becomes a lot bigger"

1523,But [Vermont ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/vermont-covid-cases.amp.html)is the most highly vaccinated state and they have also seen a pretty steep rise in hospitalizations.

1527,So.
1528,Yeah.
1529,All noble goals.

1531,Hmmm antibiotics to treat a viral infection?
1532,I wish they had a treatment for stupid.
1533,"How about Australia uses the Polish mRNA doses for its younger population, for whom AZ is too risky an option, and in return donates some AZ to other countries which are still vaccinating older age groups?"
1534,I know it's difficult to understand especially as someone that comes from a relatively small island nation.
1535,So I'll try to explain it a bit and maybe you'll see why something like that would never fly here.
1536,"The US was founded by a group of people who were fleeing religious persecution, but were also brave enough to cross an ocean without really knowing what to expect on the other side and no chance of help coming any time soon if things went sideways."
1537,That has fueled an identity of rugged individualism and government mistrust (back then it was the government that doing the persecuting).
1538,"Combine that with the vast geography, we have a country that stretches across the continent, with seacoast to mountains to vast plains of grass, huge rivers and lakes."
1539,"And there's also the local culture, New England was founded by Puritans, work ethic was important as religious observance, and eventually that was replaced by mills and factories fairly quickly in our country's life time so we became densely populated, those people also moved west as the land opened up and the Great Lakes region share many cultural ties with the Northeast."
1540,"Contrast that with the South that remained largely rural until after the Civil War, where one's position in society, politeness, chivalry and religion were important aspects there."
1541,Eventually they became industrialized as well but that only happened at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th.
1542,The cities there are only just now approaching the density that the North has had for over a century.
1543,"And then finally the West, which while settlement along the coast happened fairly early, it was far less populated than the area east of the Mississippi."
1544,There were a few Spanish missions and Native settlements but largely it was a vast expanse of open land with settlements several days' ride apart across the interior.
1545,"Until the discovery of gold, which literally drew thousands of individuals who went west to seek a fortune."
1546,It also became an area where criminals seeking to escape the law after the Civil War went because it was so sparsely populated.
1547,"Law and order were non-existent in most places, if you didn't have your own gun, you'd be robbed or worse, wind up dead."
1548,"The southern end was desert and the northern end a vast prairie where nothing but drought resistant prairie grass grew and huge buffalo herds wandered about, at one time it was called the Great American Desert."
1549,"It really wasn't until the late 19th century that it was linked with the rest of the country by the transcontinental railroad, and even then took until the 20th century before those vast wheat and corn fields we have today existed after public works allowed for irrigation of farmland."
1550,"So you can see we really aren't a homogeneous group of people but a heterogeneous one, not even counting the immigrants that have come since this country was founded."
1551,We share some commonalities but also have vast differences.
1552,"The people of the Northeast always seem to be in a rush in the eyes of a Southerner because of our work ethic, while conversely we view them as taking too long to do anything because of their ideal of politeness while those in the West are mavericks willing to blaze their own trail."
1553,Sure there has been some mixing and urban areas share more in common with each other than rural areas and vice versa but largely each region is unto itself like a separate country with the history and why people came shaping what we see today.
1554,To get people to agree to do anything barring an outside threat like a foreign adversary or an attack is nearly impossible.
1555,"And then there is the undercurrent of individualism and mistrust in government that while unites us all in some ways, also causes some fracturing of the seams."
1556,What some people view as acceptable is an abomination that must be destroyed to others.
1557,"It's never a question of money here, it's always a question of will and we just don't have the political will to do something like contact tracing on a broad scale."
1558,There may be regional cooperation but beyond that it gets very hard to get anything like that done nationally.
1559,"I am in Alabama, where we threw out 10,000+ doses."
1560,I know of people who took kids in to get them vaccinated months or years ahead of schedule because the school systems are open and not requiring masks and because Delta is so prevalent.
1561,"People say ""I'll do anything for my kids"" and now they are really proving it."
1562,"I believe pharmacists have to know, but I was at one a few weeks ago before school opened and the kid getting a vaccine looked like she was 8."
1563,I believe the pharmasists are more of the mindset of not asking any more questions that absolutely legally required.
1564,For the 2024 Republican presidential nominee?
1565,Some of The Guardian's reporters IQ lowered during the pandemic.
1566,Several counties in Eastern Washington are at around 40% vaccinated.
1567,That's not how you break a pandemic.

1638,Those other countries would kill for more AZ for citizens of any age.
1639,Kind of embarrassing that Australia has done this.
1640,Far more lives would be saved if Australia used the AZ that they have and a country with no other vaccine option gets the excess vaccines from Poland.
1641,"Lol, how on earth are you coming to the conclusion that being treated by an inexperienced nurse gives you a 10% chance of dying?"
1642,Have you actually read those articles‚Ä¶.

1644,They are not having more cases.
1645,Just a huge upward curve.
1646,This is the first time they haven‚Äôt gone into a national lock down as cases climb.
1647,60% of their population is fully vaccinated but that still leaves 40% for the delta to infect as those folks don‚Äôt have vaccine or natural immunity.
1648,"Other countries, look at US, never locked down and have had stupid levels of community spread so it‚Äôs hard to compare the apples to oranges."

1660,The American Academy of Pediatrics has already called on the FDA to approve the vaccine for 5-12 year olds.
1661,They know the data shows it‚Äôs safe and effective in children.

1663,That's insane.
1664,I didn't notice anything different with mine after getting the vaccine.

1666,Doesn‚Äôt matter.
1667,Anti-Vaxxers are limp-dicked and inadequate already.

1678,"A year later, I‚Äôm vaccinated and wear my mask on outings since my state has a low vax rate."
1679,There was no binding legal power to the statement.
1680,"As we saw previously and will see again now, governors will ignore any requests from the national government."
1681,"They should, but they won't."

1689,"Not only will the antivaxxers scream and shriek, everyone else who did get vaccinated and did all the right things will be furious that we're being punished because of the antivaxxers."
1690,"It is logistically difficult to donate vaccines that have already been distributed, There is also a time factor."
1691,"Once you realise you are not going to use them all, they may be too close to the expiration date for them to be sent on the (complex) donation route."
1692,Don't forget the cooling and the entire chain of documentation attached to it.
1693,There is a reason Covax only gets their donations directly from the manufacturers.
1694,They can't/won't be dealing with small batches that have bounced back from some armpit county in the US and then try to figure out if these vaccines are still good or if they have been compromised in any way.
1695,Then there are regulatory and legal restrictions.
1696,A lot of manufacturers forbid spontaneous donations in their contracts.
1697,"For similar reasons why Covax does not accept them: imagine some regional state in country X sends 80.000 doses of Moderna to country Y after they have been sitting around in a warehouse, and distributed locally, and then sent back to the warehouse, etc."
1698,"If anything is wrong with part of those vaccines, because the cooling was off, or something, and people in country Y get sick, then Moderna would suffer a major damage to their reputation (through no fault of their own), face possible lawsuits, and the vaccination campaign as a whole (not necessarily limited to country Y or to Moderna) would suffer a blow, with many more people becoming heistant to get vaccinated."
1699,Several things wrong here.
1700,First they're talking about people who have long lasting covid symptoms.
1701,Second just because it didn't happen to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
1702,I'm learning of all the red tape involved.

1705,Similar to lots of things in America.

1724,Thankfully doctors generally base their definition of 'rare' on population-wide observations and statistics.
1725,"But it's still possible for the rate of breakthrough infections to be higher in localized subgroups, as it depends in part on the degree of exposure."
1726,So it may just be that you tend to associate with people whose behavior puts them more at risk for breakthroughs.
1727,"I.e, it's just not rare for you."
1728,It appears we are finding for some populations that an additional booster may need to be administered.
1729,That said even with rising cases I believe Israel is seeing that case severity in breakthroughs appear to be much lower so the vaccines are still helping in that aspect.
1730,&gt; 19% is still really fucking high.

1778,Question for anyone who had covid last year.
1779,I‚Äôm 99% positive I got covid last July after visiting my Dad in ICU (for a non-covid related issue).
1780,"I had many of the symptoms (fever, coughing, aching, loss of taste &amp; smell) but luckily I didn‚Äôt have to go to the hospital."
1781,The loss of taste &amp; smell persisted for about 2-3 months.

1783,"I‚Äôm fatigued easily, i get hot and sweaty very quickly, way quicker than before."
1784,I can walk from my office building to my car 50 feet away and be sweating by the time I even get into the car.
1785,"Worst of all though, I get these weird feelings in my lower chest and sometimes the side of my chest."
1786,It‚Äôs not a pain and doesn‚Äôt outright ‚Äúhurt‚Äù so much as it just feels really awkward.

1810,"The hospital is considering whether being tested twice per week (at employee expense) will be an adequate substitute, but I think they are leaning away from that."

1888,I suppose in theory yeah.
1889,The kn95.
1890,"But there‚Äôs some caveats about fit, and authenticity moreso than some other standards."
1891,Look up the Aaron Collins dude and see if he mentions kn95s.
1892,"I‚Äôm not sure if he does talk about them much, but maybe in earlier videos."
1893,"According to this guy Aaron Collins, he‚Äôs not found fake kf94s."
1894,And also lists distributors he feels he‚Äôs trusted for ordering them from.
1895,I also like the way the Korean standard for the kf94.
1896,"They test it a little more vigorous, with I believe some treadmill walking, talking and things like that."
1897,So it takes into account not just being completely still and the fitment leakage issues that arise from moving your mouth and body.
1898,He tests them himself for filtration and leakage and had a spreadsheet too.
1899,His particle size is something mad tiny like 0.064um while the last thing I read about corona many months ago was corona small particles being 0.4um.
1900,Not sure how accurate the corona particle thing is though.
1901,"So when his tests shows 99.7% filtration for example, that‚Äôs for particles magnitudes smaller than corona allegedly, so logically, the much bigger particles of corona will be filtered at an even greater percentage."
1902,"Just to do the simple math for people... 90% less likely to be infected + 70% less likely to transmit if infected = a total of 97% less likely to catch and then transmit the virus to an unvaccinated person, and 99.7% less chance to catch and then transmit to a vaccinated person."
1903,That‚Äôs a pretty fair and logical plan imho.
1904,However my worry would be it wouldn‚Äôt stop then which is why overall I am against this kind of approach.
1905,I do totally understand and respect your opinion though.

And yes the idea that herd immunity is impossible is a growing concern."
1943,R0 of the original covid strain was predicted to be somewhere around 2.
1944,This supported the idea that with enough of the population vaccinated we could stop the spread of covid.

1966,"What odds, asking for unmasked because the unvaccinated, unmasked are the issue."
1967,"They skew poor, and they skew toward minorities."
1968,"I'm pretty shocked the American ""left"" doesn't consider all of this racist, tbh."
1969,"If you're really medical ineligible, then you'll have a diagnosis from a doctor."

1971,That's racist.

1973,Gotta wait until minority vax rates catch up.

1979,Por que*
1980,I think every Evangelical pastor who claims to heal by laying hands and tells his parishioners not to mask or vax should be required to treat their flock themselves.
1981,Do we think this surge at least hospitalizations and death should at least go by faster than the previous due to higher number of people vaccinated and eventually we run out of people to spread it?
1982,"But this was typically as a result of problems the federal government *caused*, which bears mentioning."
1983,The Civil Rights Movement was necessitated because the *federal* government said black people are 3/5 people.
1984,The Supreme Court told Dred Scott he couldn‚Äôt sue because he wasn‚Äôt a person.
1985,We shouldn‚Äôt give the federal government too much credit for eventually deciding to undo their own fuckery.

1998,Flu IS worse for kids than the pre-delta strains of Covid.
1999,Delta is drastically changing that equation as well many others.
2000,What is so hard about that?
2001,That's real world science/decision making for you.
2002,"Yes, THAT is truly hard."

""But you UnVaxxed must keep your masks on and stay distanced from the Vaxxed and each other."""

Yeah."
2006,That was just a GREAT idea.
2007,/s
2008,This is inaccurate.
2009,These numbers applied to the alpha variant
2010,Right now we assume that Delta is about 2x-6x more transmissible than the ancestral version.
2011,But the odds of outdoor transmission between vaccinated people is considered so low that even if you multiplied the number by 6 you still end up with a very small number.
2012,Most knowledgeable people will tell you it's not worth worrying about unless you are in some special high-risk environment (i.e.
2013,"an outdoor concert where people are closely packed and shouting)

We don't know what the actual rate of outdoor transmission is, best guess is less than 1/20th risk of indoor transmission, though obviously a huge number of variables are in play."
2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33249484/
2015,You‚Äôd be amazed by how many healthy fully vaccinated people in their 30s in the Seattle area where I live are absolutely terrified of COVID.
2016,As in isolating from socializing and getting their groceries delivered by Instacart.
2017,And these are people without kids to boot!
2018,I‚Äôm in that cohort of age and health and vaxx status.
2019,I believe in reasonable precautions like N95 masks in crowded stores.
2020,I still dine outdoors and hang out with fully vaxxed friends.
2021,Is that a 9'er in there?
2022,"They‚Äôre being brutally honest, but politicians and some major media outlets are ignoring them."
2023,Good.
2024,"If it comes down to a hospital bed between my kid who can‚Äôt be vaccinated, and a nutjob 42 year old who actively decided not to get vaccinated, then my kid should get the fucking bed."
2025,Same with people in accidents or who are having other health emergencies.
2026,Enough is enough.
2027,The dumbest 1/3 of society should not be able to hold everyone hostage and hog all the healthcare every time there‚Äôs a covid surge.
2028,They should get the best care currently available from the place in line they have earned.
2029,Many people in Italy kept their elderly parents at home and let them die there.

2051,What's even worse about this article it doesn't touch on the impact of hospitals that can't accept any more patients.
2052,"Patients that need to be hospitalized and can't be admitted, **WILL DIE, not some, not most, ALL."
2053,**  Every person who needs to be in a hospital and can't be admitted **WILL DIE**.
2054,"That person who can't be admitted to the hospital will go home and the family will be forced to care for them, and watch them die."
2055,"Since the family will be trapped in the home with a very sick person, it will be almost impossible to keep everyone in that house from also getting sick."
2056,"Now everyone in that house is sick, passing the viral load back and forth to each other, and since the hospitals can only accept patients as patients die or recover it means with the explosion of cases the vast majority of people who need to be in the hospital won't be in the hospital, which means the death rate for the Delta variant will skyrocket."
2057,This is how you end up entire families dying.
2058,"Once hospitals hit capacity, the death rate for covid can jump by 10-20x."
2059,"Well, 2-6 weeks, there‚Äôs some protection after the first dose and the J&amp;J vaccine of course."
2060,They have to do everything possible once their hospitals get ti this point.

2201,It's important to remember that vaccine efficacy and rates of infection are two different things.

2203,"Regarding that study, it has been observed that the measured effectiveness numbers were variable over the course of the study, and in particular, were seen to go down and then back up again (Moderna between June and July), defying a simple ‚Äúit‚Äôs getting worse‚Äù narrative."
2204,"I have yet to see an explanation or this, but it has caused some people to question the source of this variability and whether there is some confounding factor unaccounted for in the study."
2205,"On a related note, confidence intervals for the ~50% range numbers (Moderna in June, Pfizer in July) are rather large (as much as 12-85% in some cases)."
2206,I‚Äôm also perplexed as to why the study didn‚Äôt match for age.
2207,It would seem that those who got their shot earlier in the year were likely to be older.

2227,This would be a treatment AFTER you are already infected and notice you're sick enough to need it.

2295,"If so, I doubt they‚Äôll see any kind of traumatic surge."
2296,"The governors up there tend to react to the surges better, too, and mitigate the harm."
2297,"Yeah it's not like you can check a 12 year old's ID, and requiring birth certificates to prove age or something would just prevent some eligible teens who want to get the shot from getting it."
2298,"We have had a few people we discovered were under 12 after giving them a shot - there's not really anything to be done other than report it to DPHHS in my state and God forbid if something bad happens, at least there is a record of what went wrong."
2299,We have also had people use fake names to get third doses.

2316,"*For the vaccinated*--and I'd expect, by the 2022-2023 school year, the vaccine will be mandated for both students and teachers--covid is not really deadlier than the flu, though."
2317,"It does spread much more easily, but it sort of remains to see if that will hold once everyone has either gotten vaccinated or sick (i.e."
2318,when the population has more immunity).
2319,I don't think it is a foregone conclusion at all that schools are going to need to shutdown particularly frequently.
2320,I don't think the E in that equation is the same as effectiveness of the vaccine.
2321,Vaccine effectiveness refers to a proportionate reduction in disease between groups.
2322,"So if you had a group of unvaccinated people where 100 got infected and vaccinated another group of the same size, a vaccine effectiveness of 79% would mean that only 21 people got infected in the vaccinated group."
2323,The E in the calculation for herd immunity refers to the probability that a vaccinated person becomes infected.
2324,I.e if you have 100 people vaccinated how many of them do you expect to get infected.

2402,It's possibly a huge win for the GOP to make the feds pay.
2403,"It's a Dem administration and this bleeds funding from other dem agenda items where it's better spent; the state funds end up in someone's pocket which helps the state leader's personal relationships; the next budget will allow them to cut a program they don't like, and thier base won't vote dem regardless."
2404,"The fed GOP may be able to block any move for accountability if they are in the right place, and if they don't, forcing repayment can be spun as a Dem administration attacking the hard earned Florida tax dollars, meant for Floridians, it's like they're stealing from Florida!"

2591,"Recently learning about the high percentage of anthrax vaccine injuries (after recently learning that my old friend is now completely disabled because of it) got me wondering about vaccine debates in general, and it made me more wary of all vaccines."
2592,So that's what started this train of thought for me.
2593,"But my question is about vaccines in general, and since the covid vaccine is the one that I most recently got, it felt appropriate to ask for the sake of this vaccine as well."
2594,"Sure, they are different vaccines, but most people seem to completely dismiss any discussion about vaccine safety at all, regardless of which one is being discussed."
2595,And I feel like there are valid arguments to be made about vaccine safety in general.
2596,"Jesus, if he makes it to then."
2597,He has to be worried about Florida Man who lost a kid because of him.
2598,Someone could be vaccinated and not a huge fan already and lose a first grader who isn't eligible.
2599,"Ah, I apologize I confused them with a different flyover state."
2600,No fema for Mississippi.
2601,That's not at all how the Temple works.
2602,"It's 12 and older, have a Temple recommend and wear the right clothes and your good."
2603,"The 10% of paying the church goes into youth events, cleaning the buildings, and going out to people in need."
2604,Behaving in certain ways and doing and not doing certain things is just showing that you can listen to our Godhead.
2605,Our prophet has said many times to get vaccinated and people just don't listen.
2606,No one is safe from misinformation.
2607,"As someone living in Berlin, I concur."
2608,"It doesn't quite reach the absolute lunacy of Republicans comparing masks and vaccination passports to the yellow star, but it's an outgrowth of the same tumor."
2609,Nearly every mormon i know is heavily anti-vax and very pro MLM so this is really surprising to me
2610,The current leader of the Mormon church is a well-established cardiologist‚Ä¶I think he is the first church leader to really account for the science behind anything and apply it properly to the organization.
2611,Good for him.
2612,I will bonk my head hard against a wall untill my state pays me to stop.
2613,It's my right!
2614,"Jesus Christ could appear in front of these ""hesitant"" parents and tell them to get vaccinated and they'd string him up and then call ICE to report him as an illegal immigrant."
2615,Have they announced a booster shot for moderna yet?
2616,Don‚Äôt be prepared.
2617,That is their motto.
2618,"A Mormon scholar actually was allowed to root around in the SLC church basement back in the ~1960s, and found the rocks, or at least a couple of the most important ones."
2619,"They exist, even if no sane person would ascribe magical properties to them."
2620,What a callous and insensitive comparison.
2621,"Well, Mormons are weird."
2622,"Space ships, hats and rocks."
2623,It‚Äôs all a scam and lol at anyone who believes in the cockamamie stories that Joseph ‚Äúthe grifter‚Äù smith made up entirely in his mentally deranged mind.
2624,The Mormon church is one giant tax break and tax haven for a bunch of control freaks.
2625,Amazing anyone actually believes that bullshit and even more amazing that people pay into this so they can progress into  a higher status within this cult.
2626,Mormonism gives Scientology a run for its money when it comes to the crazy.
2627,You can use the Reader View browser icon in the top left of your screen that looks like a little book.
2628,"As you can see here in [my state's daily covid graph](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/mississippi/#graph-cases-daily), a wave ending in September (which it did in 2020 if you take a minute to look at the chart) can still leave room for another wave in Dec or Jan because of holiday travel and gatherings."
2629,Unless you're suggesting people are not going to travel or gather for the holidays or antivaxxers are going to have a miraculous change of heart or we will actually get vaccine passports standardized across the US federally to travel interstate.
2630,Don‚Äôt let the screen door hit you in the ass on the way out

2637,"How many innocents are they taking out daily, still lol?"
2638,Something that does them in (which is something we haven't been successful at yet) will stop future pain and suffering.
2639,It would be a silver lining.
2640,"Yes, it sucks many would die."
2641,But many are dying now as they fight the Taliban or just get railroaded by them.
2642,The government is doing not much.
2643,These people are desperate and would welcome any help they can get I'm sure.
2644,Have they taken the capitol yet?
2645,You thought last Christmas season was bad?
2646,Get ready for worse four months early.
2647,How bad it gets in fall and winter?
2648,At this rate the virus spread will be limited by the amount of people that simply exist.
2649,"I guarantee you stupid people would still attempt travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas even if we reached 500,000 cases per day."
2650,Terry Pratchett explains it pretty well.
2651,Being poor is expensive.
2652,"&gt; The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money."
2653,"&gt; Take boots, for example."
2654,He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances.
2655,A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars.
2656,"But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars."
2657,"Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles."
2658,&gt; But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years.
2659,"A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet."
2660,&gt; This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.
2661,"*The Civil War, infamous for having the highest American death toll of any war in history, was the last major American conflict before the greater public understood how diseases spread."
2662,"It was therefore the last war where the bulk of the deaths‚Äîtwo-thirds, in fact‚Äîwere not from bullets and bombs, but from viruses, parasites and bacteria."
2663,"Unfortunately, today‚Äôs COVID-19 death toll shows that many have approached the virus with a medical attitude hardly updated from 160 years ago."
2664,"*

And there it is."
2665,The most patriotic thing anti-vaxxers do is bring back old trends.
2666,"Mormonism has already had schisms, technically."
2667,"I'll pay the 50 and carry on, no biggie"
2668,"I'm an exmormon, but they are pro-science to a point - mostly around things like evaluation and gay people."
2669,There are plenty of significant scientific breakthroughs discovered by Mormons and by Mormons at BYU (their church university).
2670,Don't worry folks this is just nature doing it thing.
2671,Strengthening the gene pool.
2672,The future doesn't looks so bright either considering the American learned jack shit from the civil war.
2673,"&gt;NY's Cuomo happened

I'd argue (and I think many users on this sub would agree) that what DeSantis has already done is far more evil than what Cuomo did

And what Cuomo did was disgusting and vile"
2674,Probably at both international airports.
2675,Priority should be set for them instead of a covid denier or antivaxxer.
2676,That's not the reason and never is.
2677,It's a performance.
2678,"They mouth the words that vaguely resemble some sort of reasoning, but it's not about the vaccine."
2679,They were told something by someone they wanted to follow.
2680,It's about their egos and the need to guard their identity.
2681,"They cannot emotionally handle looking at a mirror, and saying ""I."
2682,Was.
2683,"Wrong."""
2684,"Somewhere between pride, narcissism, and egotism."
2685,It depends on whether or not B.1.621 is capable of vaccine escape.
2686,"If so, then it's going to be until at least spring 2022 before we have a vaccine to market for it barring a drastic change in how the FDA will approve updates to the vaccine."
2687,Not to mention the existing supply chain is dedicated to fulfilling the contracts for the original vaccine for the foreseeable future.
2688,There‚Äôs teachers who won‚Äôt even wear their masks properly (because they willfully don‚Äôt want to wear masks).
2689,Of course it‚Äôs foolish to expect students will.
2690,Now you're confusing intelligence with knowledge.
2691,Dude.
2692,My friend is a radiologist out in WA and he is PISSED.
2693,"Called me venting the other day, and I was like have you forgotten everything about me since you moved?"
2694,I believe in science.
2695,"And while I have a healthy distrust in our government in general, dude, 600k+ people have DIED."
2696,He called mandatory vaccination a human rights issue.
2697,I just asked if WA is an at-will state.
2698,Don't like it?
2699,"Find another job, because clearly you aren't meant to be in healthcare if you don't trust science."
2700,"Areas of high transmission, coincide exactly with areas of low vaccinations."
2701,"It must mean that immigrants are ""only"" migrating to areas of low vaccinations?"
2702,How odd.
2703,/s
2704,[removed]
2705,TIL Utahn
2706,Evidently not given how people were dying from a lack of haircuts
2707,Seems to be the general theme for conservatives
2708,"Not hearing about people dying at home is literally true, but it doesn't mean what they think it means"
2709,[removed]
2710,"both of those statements cannot be supported by any peer reviewed science,  they are both utter bs."
2711,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQptarOLSBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQptarOLSBU)

This is the closest thing I could find, I guess."
2712,"It's really a fruitless affair because as far as I can tell, 75% of anti-vaxxers base their opinions on emotions or experiences."
2713,"Just went to Utah with my family, we were in Salt Lake city for one day and ended up having a discussion about the difference between religion and a cult."
2714,I don‚Äôt think we really reached a decision but it was a fun topic.
2715,This is wrong.
2716,"Church policy says that you do not ‚Äúback pay‚Äù tithing, especially in a setting like this."
2717,You are considered a full tithe payer the immediately once you pay a tithe on your most recent increase.
2718,"In a tithing settlement meeting, bishops ask if a member is a full tithe payer, the member answers."
2719,"If yes or no, the bishop is never to inquire to see their finances or require a back payment to true-up their tithepayer standing."
2720,Anything more than this is outside the bounds of their direction by the church.
2721,The only exception has been directing members who choose not to or cannot pay online to wait and pay in person due to covid once restrictions allow them to attend in person.
2722,Yeah.

2730,"&gt;since they enacted a mask mandate, 

&gt;The governor said he has no intention of mandating masks or vaccines for state employees ‚Äúor for anyone else‚Äù and emphasized that he believes those things are personal choices."
2731,What do you mean they enacted a mask mandate?
2732,I don't see that anywhere.
2733,"The difference between our old religions, even though they‚Äôre so similar."
2734,"I‚Äôm an ex-JW and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been like that at all, even when they encouraged everyone to get vaccinated."
2735,"Here's the problem with your thesis, they probably see more covid patients who are unvaccinated than breakthrough cases so using your own logic that should firmly put them in the ""get vaccinated"" camp."
2736,"Further more, the breakthrough cases they've seen are most likely mild cases, whereas the unvaccinated cases are much more severe."
2737,What you're suggesting is mere speculation that doesn't align with the data that we have on vaccines and breakthrough cases.
2738,I‚Äôm over these stories
2739,"&gt; What happened to our free agency

Anyone who is saying this doesn't understand what free agency means."
2740,"Edit: for anyone who happens to read this - from the perspective of the church it means ""you can choose anything you want, but you cannot choose the consequences""."
2741,[removed]
2742,Good thing we are getting a third booster shot.
2743,It's the poor man's version of free speech.

2746,"When it ""tempers"" down that lull is usually considered a completed wave."
2747,I‚Äôve always wondered if ‚Äúvaccine tourism‚Äù has tilted the numbers.
2748,Apparently 100ks of central and South Americans have come to Florida for a ‚Äújab‚Äù or two.
2749,&gt;And the vaccines aren‚Äôt doing a great job at stopping transmission.
2750,"In places with genuinely high vaccination rates (65%+), yes, they are."
2751,"Next to nowhere in the US has those kinds of vaccination rates, especially not anywhere in the South."
2752,Reddit.. the best place to get attacked by rabid idiots!
2753,"Block and move on, lol..."
2754,"I am pretty sure the majority of us with Pfizer are going to have ""mild"" breakthrough Delta cases."
2755,I've been advising high risk people to be _very_ careful until this is better understood and dealt with.
2756,"While breakthrough cases are usually mild on the scale of COVID, folks with complex health situations that put them at risk are still at risk, vaccinated or not."
2757,I am thankful that professional PPE is readily available again.
2758,"At least those at risk have good, easily available options to protect themselves."
2759,"I think the reason is that many Mormons identify as republicans and like many people in the U.S., see morality, Republican Politics, and religion as all being inextricably tied together."
2760,If each of these things are seen as the same and Fox/OAN/News Max/Facebook say masks are evil and the vaccines are dangerous--then like most of the republican base--they're doing the same.
2761,"It isn't religious tenet, it's culture."
2762,"Now, there are many Mormons who don't see things this way at all--but its a large minority rather than a majority."
2763,There are many liberal Mormons who see liberal politics as much more inline with the core value of loving your neighbor.
2764,These folks tend to try to keep their politics out of their religion and are generally very pro separation of church and state.
2765,"Like any group, not everyone is in the same place--but as to a majority--I'd chalk it up more to a media diet that for many bleeds over to perceptions of faith."
2766,It is rare to find anyone who agrees 100% with a religion or large ideological group they associate with.
2767,"People may claim they do, but actions say otherwise."
2768,There have been many recent official statements that are followed with exactness or downplayed by members depending on what their political leaning was.
2769,For example: Conservative members were all for an official statement on prop 8 in California and often pushed people to take an anti gay marriage stance.
2770,"The same people were quiet and had a lot of buts and excepts to a later official statement supporting equal LGBTQ+ rights for housing, employment, social services, etc."
2771,"When Trump was running, his statements or actions were sometimes followed with official statements."
2772,"They never mentioned him by name, but the timing was highly unusual."
2773,"In 2015 Trump and Cruz called for policing Muslim neighborhoods and restricting immigration based on religion and immediately afterward [out comes an official statement warning of the erosion of liberty and supporting freedom of religio](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/publicstatement-on-religious-freedom-and-nondiscrimination)n.

Later Trump begins touting the separation of children from parents at the border and a few official [statements condemning the practice and calling for a path to citizenship are released](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-calls-for-unity-compassion-in-new-statement-on-immigration?lang=eng)."
2774,There are more where these came from as well as **plenty** that clearly support positions that align more easily with conservatism.
2775,Catholics do the same.
2776,Support the pope--but the American Conferences of Bishops ignored his request not to consider denying communion to pro choice politicians.
2777,People are people.
2778,"So, how is the local ward  (congregation) leadership dealing with the letter on Covid?"
2779,They're waiting for further clarification before making changes (going back to masks and social distancing) to meetings....
2780,??
2781,TLDR: It's culture and not religious tenet.
2782,Endemic just means the virus is always present in the community.
2783,I‚Äôm not sure why the word endemic is being used lately to describe a situation in which we no longer have huge surges and things are in control.
2784,"Endemic is not necessarily what we want, we‚Äôd much rather reduce community spread to extremely low levels like we did for Measles, Polio, and others."
2785,Endemic COVID-19 would probably mean seasonal mask wearing going forward.
2786,[deleted]
2787,"Yea I‚Äôm done with this and I‚Äôm
Not sure why others aren‚Äôt...The stats show if you get vaxxed it‚Äôs an incredibly incredibly small chance that you‚Äôll be hospitalized."
2788,So why are we still fear mongering?
2789,"I got vaxxed and social distanced for a year, now I‚Äôm going to live my life"

2791,"This isn't an arbitrary number, it's calculated to cover the risk you run by not getting vaccinated."

2793,I am fully immunized via Pfizer and world+dog should all bend over
2794,And summer power failures.
2795,"Watch the movie Omega Man, hopefully it don't end that way"
2796,Sorry about the paywall.
2797,"I know what you mean, but some of the most trusted sources are behind a paywall."
2798,"The adage of *if you're not paying for your content, you're the product* many times holds true with news sources."
2799,"Like another person mentioned, you can use `readify.me/`."
2800,This is what it should be.
2801,I can't understand why people get so heated when you are just having a discussion and exchanging ideas.
2802,"If I wanted to fight with someone, I'd just visit my dad and start talking politics."
2803,Yeah but I choose to believe that all those numbers are mad up and my uncle brother cletus said it's all a conspiracy perpetuated by Sasquatch lobby in dc /s
2804,get your vaccines people

2817,A death rate of 0.0001 is too high and if people don‚Äôt realize this only their god can help them
2818,"It really strikes me as odd that they're chill being told they need to wear magic underwear, but balk at wearing a mask."
2819,"Like, you gave away your agency by joining a cult, what's the fucking problem with a piece of cloth that protects other people (ya know, the people you're supposed to care about because Jesus said to love thy neighbor?)"

2829,"Yeah, that's basically the same thing we were going to do until we seen the rates."
2830,It would have been a common law marriage thing so I could get in with her on the family plan but the family plan isn't worth it unless you have 2 kids and 2 adults really.
2831,The deductible though is really what killed me.
2832,I would have been ok with a higher rate but to have a higher deductible too was ridiculous.

2838,Which means 33% of a totally full ICU is because of unvaxxed
2839,Who could not forsee this?
2840,What's the point of sending millions of kids back into peer-to-peer school in a locked box than sitting behind a computer monitor like the previous year?
2841,if the boards of education and superintendents want people in the school then they can sit there each and every day while the kids are sitting at home on their computers learning more from youtube than the dribble the trash the american school system teaches
2842,That Florida/Mexico border is especially hard to protect.
2843,Border control wasn't able to stop a single person from crossing over that land border in 2020!
2844,It is quite a large amount actually.
2845,This guy gets it.
2846,"This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, period."
2847,"I‚Äôve seen data that up to 30,000 kids have been hospitalized in total."
2848,That‚Äôs only 0.04% of all children under 18.
2849,The math is the same way the CDC has been tracking breakthrough cases for all vaccinated Americans.
2850,"Statistically, yes the outcome can be worsened by the factors I mentioned."
2851,"If the person is asymptomatic, yeah the comorbidity factors likely won't matter."
2852,"Abdominal fat does 2 things with covid: it displaces the lungs making it more difficult to breathe, and it is known to be active in the endocrine system, worsening the ""cytokine storm"" that happens with COVID-19."
2853,"Smoking coats the lungs, decreasing the surface area capable of transferring oxygen to the blood."
2854,"If you already have a lower oxygen intake, lowering it further when your lungs are inflamed from the virus can bring your blood oxygen dangerously low."
2855,"Yes, someone with 2% body fat can die."
2856,They wouldn't be better off if they were obese.
2857,"Yes, a smoker might be fine."
2858,In which case they wouldn't have been worse if they were a non smoker.
2859,"Those are anecdotal, and can be cherry picked out of the population."
2860,"Statistics show the comorbidity factors mentioned have a net negative effect (increased mortality rate, requirements for oxygen/ventilator) among symptomatic covid patients ."
2861,"Like I said, we are NOT THERE YET."
2862,Places with high vaccination rates are not seeing hospitals be slammed the same way.
2863,Vaccines WORK.
2864,The symptoms only resemble a cold and flu in healthy individuals.
2865,"The at-risk and immunocompromised individuals will always continue to be at-risk and immunocompromised, just as they were before the pandemic."
2866,"I fully understand how scary things are for them, with rampant spread right now."
2867,"But eventually, the risk of overloading the healthcare system will not be as high."
2868,"All pandemics ‚Äúend,‚Äù or at least become endemic."

2889,Same.
2890,I hardly ever see anyone wearing them.

2905,"If there's vaccine escape, everyone in the US is effectively back to square one, that doesn't mean they can't develop another vaccine that would work against the new variant."
2906,But we would have to start the whole campaign over from square one.
2907,That's just a fact.
2908,If anything it supports the fact that we need to get the whole world vaccinated because this just isn't going to go away if the US is at 100% vaccination and the rest of the world isn't.
2909,"I'm the last person that's defeatist, I always think we can figure a way out but I also recognize reality, we can't just ignore the rest of the world."

2952,Your comment made me feel a little less hopeless.
2953,Medical insurance companies need to institute strict coverage limitations on the unvaccinated.

https://deadline.com/2021/08/california-covid-infections-five-hundred-percent-unvaccinated-people-1234813856/  


It's not super clear to me if vaccinated people spread the virus as much as unvaccinated people, but right now, every person infected infects about 1.35 more people:

And if you divide that by 5, each person would infect less than one new person, so the virus starts going away again."
3013,Which vaccine did they use in Brazil?
3014,Why semi normalcy instead of normalcy?
3015,If a place requires it.
3016,Good point about the supply issue.
3017,I don't believe that my decision to take a vaccine would deprive someone else's vaccine.

3025,I am on my phone but I tried to read the report but I can't see the percentage of the death are vaccinated?
3026,Anyone happened to know please share so I can kinda judge the effectiveness of the vaccine..
3027,I love the comments here...new flash...
3028,I worked at a large hmo.
3029,Although we were not patient facing we still had to have all the same immunizations and tb tests as the medical staff.
3030,Every year we had flu vaccines.
3031,You got a pink dot on your badge and you didn't have to wear a mask at work from October to March.
3032,Otherwise you did.
3033,"So when I went to the center to get my yearly mammogram...imagine my surprise to see the raft of workers, no pink dot, and a mask."
3034,"Heck I was just at a nudist resort and there's a x ray tech there who will be leaving ( one of those uber healthy eating exercise types) and a 71 year old man who is in good enough shape that he works at the Amazon warehouse, and has for 6 years now...who will be leaving if forced to take the vaccine."
3035,"While the Amazon worker has spurious arguments, the x ray tech regaled me with not putting foreign things in his body."
3036,"He's also a vegan health food eater, so at least I can say he is consistent."
3037,I just got to witness this on Facebook.
3038,"The person who knows the dying person currently in the ICU thinks that that person's ""covid"" (they used quotes around the word) infection is from being exposed to someone that got the vaccine, and not due to being infected with the virus in it's natural form."
3039,That‚Äôs quite a large number.
3040,I wonder what the numbers are for people passing of the flu for the same or comparable period of time.
3041,I feel like it would be way less.

3056,"In previous analysis I‚Äôve done of the data, the real number they should be spreading is 98.3% or thereabouts which represents being an American, getting an infection and not dying from it."

3087,Same.
3088,"I live in the Bay Area, and even at they gym (which I personally find to be the most uncomfortable place to wear one), there was never less than about 50% of people wearing them."
3089,Most people around here never stopped wearing them.

3095,I pretty clearly said was was pro vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.
3096,I brought up their knowledge base to say they weren't the ones making medical decisions.
3097,"As to your pandering comment, I've repeated myself several times at this point on why I think divisive language is making the antivax movement stronger."
3098,"Your comment doesn't have the goal of trying to increase vaccinations, and will actually probably reduce them."
3099,Its just pandering to the other polarized redditors for fake internet points.
3100,The main thing I‚Äôve noticed is how suddenly everyone is a scientist or politician and has a different way out of the pandemic.
3101,It‚Äôs normal to have differences and different opinions but the pandemic has really showcased them
3102,It would have taken the government longer to come up with a system that all the vaccine distributors could use than it took to make a vaccine.
3103,"Non American here, I see a lot about Texas and Mississippi, but how are things going in the states with high vax rates?"
3104,They meant states and pockets with relatively high vaccination.
3105,The places that are doing the worst right now have average to far below average vaccination.
3106,True.
3107,"The vast majority of fully vaccinated folks never become infected, thus never spread the virus, and never experience symptoms of any kind."

3126,It occurred to me that none of them have ever had to deal with a pandemic like this before.
3127,"As experienced as they are, they haven‚Äôt experienced anything like this."
3128,"Strategies for annual flu outbreaks, local measles surges, illnesses like Ebola and SARS and MERS (affecting relatively few people in a few countries, and rapidly dealt with)."
3129,"I think they were picturing something like the movie Contagion‚Ä¶high lethality, Ro of 4, total immunity from a vaccine."
3130,"Nobody in charge of the response has ever had to deal with a rolling pandemic lasting 18 months, with incomplete response to vaccines."
3131,It‚Äôs going to take more than public health measures and a better vaccine.
3132,"It‚Äôs going to need the help of psychologists, marketing/messaging experts, and politicians to navigate our way through this."
3133,It‚Äôs not a skill set that many doctors or public health experts have.
3134,"And vaccinate, other than that there‚Äôs nothing you can do to prevent getting sick."
3135,So pick your options
3136,Plenty of people died at home from Covid as it is.

3158,What do you mean over 80% of cases are vaxxed people?
3159,All I‚Äôm hearing literally everywhere is that around 96 percent of cases are unvaccinated.
3160,Not when they say things like that boosters are needed but that J&amp;J recipients don't get them because they don't have enough data.
3161,Maybe because [it's illegal](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.benefitspro.com/2021/08/03/employers-tie-health-insurance-rates-to-vaccine-status/%3famp=1)

3181,"And I replied, ""**Right,**"" because I know that, but my point is that it's not the ONLY problem."
3182,"So what, exactly, is your argument here?"
3183,What are you trying to say?
3184,"If your point is that these people I'm talking about aren't a statistically significant portion of people who refuse to be vaccinated, then first of all, provide a source."
3185,"Second of all, okay??"
3186,"That wasn't my point and it doesn't negate what my point actually was, so I'm not sure why you're so insistent."

3525,No idea.

3553,Figure 1 in [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1.full.pdf) is the best data there is.

3620,Burn it all down and get a decent national health insurance system going.
3621,It's abundantly obvious that society doesn't believing in maxing total utility as its one and only objective.
3622,"For example, it is morally wrong to push  one person onto a oncoming train to save 5 people."
3623,"So I think its perfectly fair and not a ""horrible point"" for people to want the medical system to function the same way."
3624,The idea here is that medical resources should go to people who took reasonable steps in protecting themselves.
3625,Another reasonable argument is that you want to disincentive people from taking action that will massively burden the health system and prevent people who actually can not reasonable avoid the hospitable from receiving care.
3626,"Here's another example to illustrate the intuition: someone wore a seatbelt, drove safely, gets killed in a freak accident (people will feel pretty sorry for them because it just seems like sheer bad luck)."

3648,Maybe covid maybe flu.
3649,No testing at the time.
3650,But I got very very sick and felt like I was dying.
3651,I lost some weight while sick and whatever it was scared me so much that I quit smoking and though I had already started working out before it just made me go into overdrive.
3652,I used 2020 as a way to simplify and control my diet like never before.
3653,Cooked every meal and never ate out.
3654,No fast food.
3655,I lost 100+ lbs in less than the year.
3656,And lately I have been trying to gain a little back but in muscle.
3657,Lot of weed though but no alcohol.
3658,I am healthier now then I have almost ever been.
3659,I feel more fit and bouncy then I did even as a teen.
3660,I wasn‚Äôt the healthiest when I was heavy but never felt like I was sickly or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù.
3661,It wasn‚Äôt till I lost more than 1/3 my weight to realize just how bad I really was.
3662,It isn‚Äôt 100% denial but more‚Ä¶ forgetting or not knowing what normal is or should be anymore.
3663,I guess it‚Äôs still denial but it‚Äôs just not understanding how big of a change it can be and what truly feeling healthy is.
3664,It‚Äôs not just weight either.
3665,I know a lot of chain smokers or heavy drinkers who still eat trash and are a relatively healthy weight and they would probably call themselves healthy by their not.
3666,You can be skinny or even fit and still not be healthy in a lot of ways with bad habits.

3672,I have a one year old so right now we‚Äôre staying home and we only take her to the park where we can socially distance and be outside.
3673,Just waiting until more is known about the delta variant.
3674,We‚Äôre fully vaccinated but my child has very little defense against the virus.
3675,Covid season?
3676,Fucking seriously?
3677,gop: learning bad
3678,"The vaccine doesn't make you immune, but it reduces the risk of you getting sick, and the risk that you have a worse outcome."
3679,A strong immune system works in the same way.
3680,"There are studies on how sleep decreased the risk of getting the common cold, and I would assume that it would be the same for Covid.A person that is very fit, doesn‚Äôt have to be healthy, as there are so many more factors for a good functioning immune system."

3682,"&amp;#x200B;

Eating well, having good sleep hygiene, frequent exercise,working on stress with things like mindfulness are going to decrease the risk of getting very sick in Covid, but there is never any immunity."

3713,That's the government's website explaining the law.
3714,Nothing is inaccurate or misleading.
3715,They stated up front the only five factors that can affect rates.
3716,Smoking is not a medical condition but a behavior so it's not an exception to the medical information restriction.
3717,Smoking is a rating factor because congress said so.
3718,Laws don't have to and almost never explain the rationale for why they exist--that's for politicians to do.
3719,I heard if you swallow a UV light you don't need a vaccine.
3720,I don't really think there's anything to worry about.
3721,"I also heard they're making tiny drones that can fight the virus based on the technology they developed for the movie Inner Space starring Martin Short, Meg Ryan and Dennis Quade."
3722,"I mean, this technology was developed before 1986 and has been used many times since then."
3723,They deliver an army of little tiny robots  in a syringe that fight the virus one on one like Power Rangers only smaller.

3916,This is flat out wrong.

3920,IMO that's makes their refusal even worse.

3944,I am kind of person of waiting it out and in fact you can‚Äôt tell what the vaccination will do once it‚Äôs tested and used on the mass public  then you can see the true results.

3999,"There are already so many other restrictions on what missionaries can do (significantly more so than regular members), so why not this?"
4000,"To be fair, this is a very controversial thing (stupidly so but it is what it is), and enforcing this wouldn't be as easy as other things that the members are often raised to do their whole lives."
4001,I never served a mission.
4002,"But my brothers and in-laws did and from what I've learned it sounds like the various mission districts can differ from each other more than I (and perhaps most) would expect, dependent largely on the current mission president for that district."
4003,So I suppose mask-wearing could vary from district to district for that reason alone.
4004,That's just one thought anyway.
4005,"Mormon missions, the culture around them, and even the effects on the missionaries afterwards (not always good, mind you) are really intriguing to me and I find it a really interesting topic."
4006,It still cracks me up that people act like the FDA not being able to give it the full approval yet means anything more than just typical red tape.
4007,It has FDA emergency use approval.
4008,The FDA has put their name down saying they think the the vaccine is so much safer than getting covid that they are willing to sign am emergency use authorization something that almost never happens.

4184,"IIRC, a study from Mt Sinai Hospital in New York City estimated 1.6 million infections happened in the city during the Spring 2020 wave."
4185,Can they raise the rates for everyone then offer a reduction to vaccinated people as a workaround?
4186,Right I forget about all those mink farms that had to basically be completely eradicated
4187,I may be downvoted to hell for saying this but amen.
4188,I was a smoker on and off for 20 years and I've also been obese on and off for many years of my life.
4189,If I had insisted that people not call smoking unhealthy and that people just accept that smoking is healthy for me they would have laughed in my face (rightfully so).
4190,Obesity is no different.
4191,You can absolutely agree that people of any weight deserve love and respect while not simultaneously pretending that being obese is healthy.
4192,Unfortunately that's an entirely plausible scenario.
4193,Definitely hits a spot on the risk assessment table that no one really wants to think about.
4194,"There's a very good chance that a freight train is coming and everyone just wants to hurry up and get to work on the tracks because they're afraid if they don't, the economy is going to kill them first."

4196,95% of S√£o Paulo city adults already got the first shot.
4197,How the fuck is this shit upvoted?
4198,‚ÄúFollow the science‚Äù and yet this entire thread is acting like healthy people aren‚Äôt in fact healthier and better able to fight off viruses.
4199,Literally every metric on mortality we‚Äôve seen from Covid shows that healthy people fair MUCH better
4200,Long Covid terrifies me
4201,Exactly.
4202,Thank you.
4203,Yeah.
4204,I see your point.
4205,I just can't imagine somebody immunocompromised with a broken leg in the hospital.
4206,"So -- with a shortage, the question is who is more important, the immunocompromised with the broken leg, or the unvaccinated person that could have gotten vaccinated?"
4207,[deleted]
4208,To add on there are probably unknown risk factors that can give an individual a worse prognosis.
4209,"At the ERs I cover, I rarely but occasionally see a healthy looking 20-30 year/olds with pretty bad covid pneumonia/PE's on CT."
4210,I did.
4211,"Which is why I said that, I dunno?"
4212,Yah just threw CDC numbers in excel and calculated the growth rate
4213,I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre already there
4214,"Yeah, it's incredibly disturbing how all these people who used to claim they believed in universal healthcare are now laughing about people being bankrupt by medical bills and even advocating denying dying people healthcare altogether!"
4215,"All the past 18 months have taught me is that most people ""on my side"" of the political aisle are just as vile, hypocritical assholes as our opponents."
4216,"Weaker, yes."
4217,Example: the immunocompromised.
4218,Logic tells me stronger should also exist.
4219,"There's a range in immune system effectiveness among humans, and naturally some people would fall in the upper end of the range."
4220,...right?
4221,I skim articles often.
4222,I think that is a bad job then.
4223,They should say the amount of deaths since the vaccine.
4224,Saying 3 % from the start of the pandemic is a very poor job.
4225,I think articles should give deaths from say March on since then a lot could get the vaccine.
4226,Give us that percentage.
4227,"I grow kale and eat it raw, do yoga, crystals, meditation, and I got the vax."
4228,"If something is going to happen with a vaccine, it's going to happen in the first few months."
4229,Usually within the first month.
4230,"Attenuated virus, inactivated virus, viral vector, mRNA - everything about the vaccine is gone from the body in a month."
4231,mRNA is gobbled up by RNAses very quickly.
4232,The spike proteins are catabolized.
4233,But you know what we really don't know the long term effects of?
4234,Being infected with COVID-19.
4235,It does fucky things in the brain for instance.
4236,Will we see a surge in early onset Alzheimer's in a decade or two?
4237,Who knows?

4239,Who knows?
4240,"Longterm damage from a viral infection is not an unusual thing

4248,I had a taco bell employee give me a dab pen to hit in the lobby after he took my order once in Portland.
4249,So it is a little anarchistic.
4250,Just 7 day rolling avg compared to the previous week of that day
4251,This sub seems to think that just because some very healthy people have gotten fucked by Covid that means it doesn‚Äôt help at all.
4252,If it didn‚Äôt help than almost every Covid patient you see in the ICU wouldn‚Äôt be morbidly obese and/or elderly
4253,yes sorry you could be right - maybe summing up two days.
4254,Maybe it will hit 300k in a few weeks tho
4255,The spike in infections began over a month ago.
4256,"If measures in place a couple months ago, which I understand is easy to say in hindsight, the surge likely wouldn't be as bad as it is now."
4257,Do you have additional context for this?
4258,But there is a simple way to prevent it.
4259,"If you are so against modern medicine to refuse to vaccine, you should also refuse treatment via modern medicine."
4260,Many of the drugs used for covid treatment is also used under emergency use and their long term impact when combined with covid symptoms isn't known for sure.

4265,"I'm totally sure they'll obey them and not, you know, just be kids and do the kinds of stupid things kids do."
4266,Every school is basically a community viral hub.
4267,"People don't want to accept that because they don't want kids underfoot, have to work to feed them so they need babysitters, whatever."
4268,Convenience or inconvenience of it doesn't change the dynamic of the disease at all.
4269,"In the first place, we don't really know if its safe to vaccinate them."
4270,"In the second place, a lot of parents won't anyhow."
4271,"In the third place, if there's a thousand kids in the school, that's one thousand families that are going to get exposed the first time a particularly nasty variant comes through."
4272,"Each and every person reading this was a kid at one point, and each of you know that those precautions aren't going to be followed and that little Bobby will definitely be wiping his boogers under the desk, pulling on little Janie's hair, getting up close and breathing in other kids faces."
4273,"Meanwhile little Jimmy is going to think it's funny to steal Steve's mask and wave it around his head, while Steve is busy lining up a spitball at the kid across the room."

4379,The prodromal phase (the time from first infected until symptoms present) is much longer with this virus (4-10 days) compared to other respiratory pathogens.
4380,There is less selective pressure to become weaker in order to continue to spread.

4565,So when do you all think covid will mutate and have more of an effect on children or younger people?
4566,With school starting up I would imagine that it will start to spread within schools and possible mutations could occur correct?
4567,Do you think people would take it more seriously if children were dying at the rate adults did/do?
4568,Delta was the gamechanger.
4569,"The worse health you are in the worse your sickness will likely be, making you more likely to die early due to your already poor health."

4581,"12-19 could have gotten vaccinated since before school let out, their vaccination rates are atrocious."
4582,The vaccine alone isn't going to get us out of this or keep schools safe.
4583,It's because many people really don't understand statistics.
4584,"They think ""If I get the jab, I have a small percentage chance of feeling sick."
4585,""", but if they don't then they get to have this nebulous, easily denied percentage chance of catching covid in the first place."

4664,"If the mechanism goes off, you have to replace the blade and the safety cartridge, which is $100-200 worth of hardware, but that's nothing compared to a finger."
4665,"And yet, says the guy in the video, if anything, getting the saw has made him think about it even more when he turns it on, because he knows exactly what it will feel like if he needs to stop working and spend the rest of the day buying new stuff, figuring out how to swap it in, and recalibrating the saw."

4700,&gt;One of the hypotheses as to why children were catching Covid less is that children have stronger innate immune systems.
4701,This is true but I don't think this can be generalised to a 'stronger' immune system overall.
4702,Kids are more susceptible to many diseases (ie whooping cough) for other reasons.
4703,It's more accurate to say young kid's immune systems are different and it helps in some ways and hurts in others.
4704,The whole idea of a strong or boosted immune system is not a good one as the immune system is complex and is a balancing act between over-reacting and under-reacting.

[Should You Wear a Mask?"

4721,"&gt;With primarily unvaccinated Covid-19 patients filling up hospitals and intensive care unit beds, the US health care system ""is breaking,"" one expert said, as new admissions hit another record."
4722,"&gt;The rate of new Covid-19 hospitalizations among people in their 30s increased by nearly 300% over the past month, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
4723,"New Covid-19 hospital admissions among people between the ages of 30 and 39 are now the highest since the pandemic began, eclipsing the prior record seen in January, according to the data."
4724,&gt;The alarming uptick is stretching health resources thin as many hospitals struggle to meet the demand of those who need crucial medical care.
4725,"&gt;‚ÄùThe system is breaking,"" CNN medical analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, told CNN's Jim Acosta Saturday."
4726,"""It's not just the beds."
4727,Many hospitals can find beds in places like parking structures or cafeterias.
4728,But it's qualified people to staff those beds.
4729,"And the United States is critically short on ICU nurses, so finding the qualified staff to take care of critically ill patients becomes increasingly hard,"" said Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University."

4735,"Back in June when they were like, okay no more masks needed!"
4736,"I'd say 50% still masked, I personally haven't stopped."

4739,"This major entertainment company that owns some of the biggest venues in NJ and NYC is requiring vaccines or negative tests, and then vaccines only on October 1st."
4740,"Once FDA approved, more and more major places will require vaccines vs this small patchwork now."
4741,"Anything is possible of course, but after us getting demolished the first 3 months, those horrors are still fresh in our minds and I'm cautiously optimistic that people around here will do what's necessary to keep it as under control as possible since the end of our major wave last June."

4791,Florida hospital administrators still say the vast majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.
4792,"What‚Äôs more, the admissions don‚Äôt mean that seniors today are, on average, getting as ill as they were in previous waves, according to Ali Mokdad, a professor with the University of Washington‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation."
4793,"He said seniors are now more likely to check themselves into a hospital as a precaution for COVID-19, even if they are asymptomatic."
4794,Mokdad also underscored that the situation would be much worse in Florida in the absence of the vaccines.
4795,"‚ÄúFor the elderly population, it takes less to get them to a hospital,‚Äù he said."
4796,"The wave hitting Florida and the Deep South may be close to peaking, but the full consequences of the infections may not be known for weeks as hospital workers try to hold the line."
4797,The effective reproduction number ‚Äî an estimate of the average number of people a single infected person can spread the virus to ‚Äî recently fell below one in Florida and Louisiana.

4802,"Earlier this month, Governor Ron DeSantis noted Florida‚Äôs COVID-19 mortalities were still trending about 70-75% lower than previous peaks; that gap has since shrunk substantially."
4803,And hospitalizations and deaths typically trail infections.

4806,"Yeah, they are just wrong, governments collect stats on this."

4809,"I mean, there were plenty of news reports of people dying at home when the pandemic first hit."
4810,Yes but you leave out the fact that many of these things reopened last winter with mask mandates and flu didn‚Äôt spread.

4841,Human selfishness has finally beaten out of me the concern I have for individual rights during a pandemic.
4842,We can't work together apparently.
4843,You mean how they probably lied about their vaccination status and just took the mask off?
4844,What?
4845,"Funny because prior to this moment, there have been jokes made about telling people COVID will give them ED to get them to mask and vaccinate."
4846,Here we are.

&gt;‚ÄùJust a couple nights ago, I walked out of the ER and saw ambulances here that weren‚Äôt able to take out patients yet, people on stretchers in the hallways‚Ä¶ People were gasping for air,‚Äù Lee Bond, the CEO of the Singing River Health System, said on the call."
4848,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of time before somewhere in our great state someone goes to the ER and is not able to get treated because we don‚Äôt have the arms and legs to do it.‚Äù

&gt;The Mississippi State Department of Health reported 4,412 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the highest single-day caseload the state has seen throughout the pandemic."
4849,"This shattered the previous record of 3,488 cases set just two days ago."
4850,Physicians say these high daily case numbers will translate to more record hospitalizations in coming weeks.
4851,&gt;The situation in Mississippi hospitals is more dire than it‚Äôs ever been.
4852,Top medical professionals began sounding the alarm this week that the Mississippi hospital system could fail in 5-10 days if the current trajectory of new COVID-19 cases continues.
4853,"&gt;As of Wednesday, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, patients in an ICU and patients on ventilators were at pandemic peak."
4854,&gt;The Gulf Coast Business Council hosted State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs and the hospital executives for the virtual meeting on Thursday to answer questions and spell out to local businesses the seriousness of the delta wave.
4855,&gt;Dobbs said the state reported 36 deaths on Monday due to COVID-19 or complications from the virus.
4856,"Eleven of those deaths were of people under 50, he said."
4857,Three of them were in their 20s.
4858,Two were pregnant women.
4859,All were unvaccinated.
4860,"&gt;‚ÄùHad those people been vaccinated, they would not be dead,‚Äù he said."
4861,"‚ÄúNot only would they not be dead, but they would have not had to go to hospital.‚Äù 

&gt;A little over 1 million Mississippians are fully vaccinated, which is about 35% of the state."
4862,About 1.3 million people have had at least one vaccine.
4863,Mississippi ranks 48th in the nation for vaccine rates.
4864,"It will take another 1 million Mississippians to get vaccinated before the state reaches any sort of herd immunity, Dobbs said."
4865,How about we get an rsv mrna vaccine?
4866,They need to hammer this point.
4867,Any anecdotes on people who have gotten three doses of vaccine?
4868,How were the side effects?

4882,I think for 2-5 it was 3 mcg.
4883,Not sure about 0.5-2.
4884,Looks like a professional rioter.
4885,One thing that is lacking in all vaccination rate comments etc is the vaccination rate per age group.
4886,I thought Sweden would be worse off than Florida due to lower full vaccination rate but then I looked at the actual age groups in Sweden vs Florida and there were stark differences.
4887,"In Sweden 60 and older 90% have at least one dose, 86% have 2 doses."
4888,For 50-59 its 86% and 77%.
4889,Much higher than Floridas rates.
4890,And Swedens vaccination is way behind many other EU countries.
4891,Denmark is like 10%-points ahead.
4892,The Florida age group rates are not very good.

4900,but have not heard of it positively affecting anything outside of the brain.

4904,"If your child is in daycare, then, yes, the majority of their interactions for the past 17 months have been with masked adults."

5214,"I think early childhood professionals, like you, and SPED teachers know this is a problem."
5215,The SPED school I worked for began offering in-person learning again last fall while public schools in our area remained virtual-only.
5216,"They still had a virtual option for those who didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sending their kids back, but they knew they needed to offer in-person too because they were seeing the impact virtual learning was having on these students."
5217,Republicans are pretending pretty well to be.
5218,Insurance companies refuse coverage anyway.
5219,I 100% support them refusing coverage for unvaccinated.
5220,I'm loving that the nurses seem to know something the doctors don't.
5221,"I can't imagine how strong those nurses are though, they see what happens first hand and still have the resolve to not get it."
5222,"Well, basically they're telling that it will take long and it is not so possible that a super variant may arrive."

5269,This outbreak has shown how rotten healthcare is in this country.
5270,Maybe we can move to a more civilized version of it.
5271,It is not illegal to tie ‚Äústicks‚Äù to vaccination.
5272,"Courts have upheld that an employer can fire you for not getting vaccinated, which is a pretty big stick."
5273,"As for insurance, the ACA let‚Äôs insurers raise your rates for ‚Äúrisky‚Äù behavior, like rock climbing."
5274,So they can certainly raise your rates for not getting a vaccine as the risk of such behavior is very high.
5275,"The difficult part for the insurers is they have to prove the rate increase is actuarily justified, and they likely don‚Äôt have enough data to make that case yet."
5276,We need to start looking at death rate since vaccinations became available I think.
5277,"Far better measure of how things ARE going, not WERE going."
5278,Effectively zero is not zero.
5279,This I a bad situation and we should all be more careful.
5280,Vaccinated and unvaccinated (who need to get vaccinated)
5281,You also need to break numbers like ‚Äú75% fully vaxxed‚Äù down to better understand the true lay of the land.
5282,"Where I live we keep hearing similar total average stats - but it‚Äôs because 90+, 80+, 70+ and 65+ are like 88-96%

When I look at 18-35 it‚Äôs like 58%."
5283,"The younger demographics, even the 40-50 year olds, typically have a much lower uptake."
5284,These appear to be the brackets driving a lot of delta spread.
5285,Unless ur an antivax patient
5286,"Half of our deaths occurred in those 3 months when no one knew wtf to do and we're so densely populated that it spread enough before ""lockdowns"" happened."
5287,"Since last June, we've had the same number of deaths as we did at the beginning."
5288,It's getting real old hearing people talk about how NJ is STILL doing the worst because of our death rate without even a semblance of critical thinking and analyzing past the face value of a that metric.
5289,"Edit - I'm in no way attacking you, just venting lol"
5290,Much lower if one is vaccinated - symptoms are reduced - lookin at 99+%effectiveness

5294,Geez I thought we were already in the peak
5295,Delta's Ro is much larger than the previous strains.
5296,The vaccination coverage required for some semblance of herd immunity is higher than 70% now.
5297,"Oh wow, that‚Äôs way more than I‚Äôd expected!"
5298,In the UK our equivalent to zip codes are postcodes and a postcode covers an average of 15 properties (but can cover up to 100).
5299,He also got vaccinated in January.
5300,I'm gonna go ahead and guess that part of the reason COVID causes more hospitalizations in Florida is also because obesity is a little more prevalent.
5301,That can't be helping.
5302,The reasons for the surge are not relevant for DeSantis.
5303,His job is limiting the impact before you run out of hospital beds.
5304,Why are you being a dick for no reason?
5305,I was responding to the comment.
5306,It doesn't matter if it's 100% vaccination rate among adults when 40% of households have someone under 18.

5339,Neither blood clots nor heart arrhythmia are disqualifying conditions.

5582,"We understand that the FDA has recently worked with Pfizer and Moderna to double the 
number of children ages 5-11 years included in clinical trials of their COVID-19 vaccines."
5583,"While 
we appreciate this prudent step to gather more safety data, we urge FDA to carefully consider 
the impact of this decision on the timeline for authorizing a vaccine for this age group."
5584,"In our 
view, the rise of the Delta variant changes the risk-benefit analysis for authorizing vaccines in children."
5585,"The FDA should strongly consider authorizing these vaccines for children ages 5-11 years based on 
data from the initial enrolled cohort, which are already available, while continuing to follow safety data from 
the expanded cohort in the post-market setting."
5586,"This approach would not slow down the time to authorization 
of these critically needed vaccines in the 5‚Äì11-year age group."
5587,"In addition, as FDA continues to evaluate clinical trial requirements for children under 5 years, we similarly 
urge FDA to carefully consider the impact of its regulatory decisions on further delays in the availability of 
vaccines for this age group."
5588,"Based on scientific data currently available on COVID-19 vaccines, as well as on 70 
years of vaccinology knowledge in the pediatric population, the Academy believes that clinical trials in these 
children can be safely conducted with a 2-month safety follow-up for participants."
5589,"Assuming that the 2-month 
safety data does not raise any new safety concerns and that immunogenicity data are supportive of use, we 
believe that this is sufficient for authorization in this and any other age group."
5590,"Waiting on a 6-month follow-up 
will significantly hinder the ability to reduce the spread of the hyper infectious COVID-19Delta variant among 
this age group, since it would add 4 additional months before an authorization decision can be considered."
5591,"Based on the evidence from the over 340 million doses of COVID-19 doses administered to adults and 
adolescents aged 12-17,as well as among adults 18 and older, there is no biological plausibility for serious 
adverse immunological or inflammatory events to occur more than two months after COVID-19 vaccine 
administration."

5627,"Put down the potato chips, or expect to cover all costs associated with medical care for issues arising from obesity."
5628,That's also the opinion of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
5629,They consider the data sufficient for 5-11 year olds and want the FDA to expedite approval.
5630,"But, again, you don‚Äôt want people with covid to be untreated."
5631,They will infect even more people than they would if they were treated.

5657,"The entire hospital is not the ICU, so how many covid cases do you think we‚Äôre talking about?"
5658,That's a fair point.
5659,And I hope when FDA approval is given that many more will get vaccinated (although I can already hear many of them screaming that it was too soon).
5660,"To protect those who still refuse, we're saying then that we should sacrifice the ones who have done the right thing."
5661,No in unvaccinated populations the rate of serious symptoms is 20 percent.
5662,"Yeah, the way to do it responsibly is to mandate that only vaccinated people are allowed in bars and stadiums etc after awhile they‚Äôll get frustrated enough to get it"
5663,"Nope, but the anti-vaxxers did."

5665,You said most of them are impoverished and that the loonies are a very minor group.
5666,That is what I was replying to.
5667,"I don't disagree that resources are a factor; I disagree that the ""loonies"" are a very minor group."
5668,But those who are untreated are MORE LIKELY to pass this virus to your kids.
5669,"So if you‚Äôre worried for your kids, you should be advocating FOR treating the unvaccinated for covid."
5670,&gt;It's a punishment for the behavior that impacts everyone.
5671,"No, it's not."
5672,"Punishment for the behaviour would be applied to everyone displaying that behaviour equally, e.g."
5673,a blanket fine for anyone not being vaccinated.
5674,What about the millions of people who are lucky enough not to catch it or who have only a mild case?

5763,"My insurance company makes exceptions for everything else, they should refuse to pay for unvaccinated customers COVID treatments and lower all of our premiums in the process."
5764,"The places with the highest populations of people (urban areas) do not lean antivax, so yes, it's possible that in your conservative area anti vax is more of a political issue than access to care etc overall."
5765,"In chicago, political antivaxxers don't exist except in the white, middle class and higher areas (reoublican leaning) mainly western suburbs."
5766,"Punishing people for not having the vaccine here will affect mostly poor people, largely people of color."
5767,Maybe each hospital is only allowed 10% Covid capacity?
5768,Excluding hospital acquired covid.
5769,Then they turn away covid patients and/or triage them like vaccinated vs unvaccinated.

5772,"Interestingly enough I moved from oklahoma to austin in the 90s for some time, and you're entirely correct."
5773,"The 90s was the turning point for Austin, it was expensivish back then, more expensive than oklahoma by far, so this person above you clearly has no idea what they're talking about as far as prices in those areas."
5774,"They're correct that people are moving to Oklahoma because it's cheaper, but it isn't cheap cheap."
5775,"The places he mentioned are already expensive, mostly because there has been a housing crunch and historically low wage issue literally everywhere."
5776,Here in Oklahoma houses that were 90k 5 years ago easily go for 500k now.
5777,"Ant-vaxxers are wrong and being idiots, but the US denies free medical care for everyone, already."
5778,"The only way you get ‚Äúfree‚Äù medical care is if you get medicaid or medicare, or pay insurance companies wayyyyyy to much money (and then it isn‚Äôt free)."
5779,"There is no practical way to do this, and we can‚Äôt deny care for everyone who has made a bad decision - you going to deny care for a motorcyclist without a helmet?"
5780,Or a motorcyclist in general?
5781,"Plus, those sick people who don‚Äôt get care under this proposal are going to walk around and infect others."

5893,"If the choice between an unvaccinated adult who refused the vaccination and a vaccinated adult who was in a car accident, the latter should be given priority service."
5894,"I mean...yeah, kind of, especially since addiction is widely recognized as a disease."
5895,"A lot of adult smokers started as kids who sometimes lack good decision making strategies, and alcoholism seems to run in families, either through addictive tendencies or familial/cultural attitudes towards alcohol."
5896,My point is/was that insurance companies (or whatever organization was in charge of overseeing healthcare) would take this kind of moral hair splitting as a license to start denying coverage for all kinds of preventable diseases.

5903,We are having a surge of RSV and no mask mandates are allowed and this is a bomb just waiting to go off as or under 20 numbers rise and we added 65 schools to the list with covid infections.

5905,"Chronic illness is what concerns me for their generation, death is not the only bad outcome from covid and as someone who had sufferers from chronic illness I would not wish it on my kiddo or anyone else's, this had the potential to ravage an entire generation and that terrifies me for many reasons."

5994,"Currently the attackers‚Äô side seems more focused  on destroying *themselves*, so that give a bit of hope the outcome of this one will be the same as the last one."
5995,As of right now 92.9% of those 16 and older have received at least one shot and 86.3% are fully vaccinated.
5996,That means that 71.5% of the total population is fully vaccinated and 77.1% partially vaccinated.
5997,Iceland has also vaccinated children older than 12 that have underlying conditions and are going to vaccinate the rest starting this week.
5998,Those who received J&amp;J are also going to receive a booster shot this week with either Pfizer or Moderna.
5999,In this current wave around 2630 have gotten infected.
6000,"Of those 66.77% were fully vaccinated, 2.24% were partially vaccinated and 30.99% were unvaccinated."
6001,Of course keep in mind that due to how many people are vaccinated it is not unusual for them to be the majority of those infected.
6002,In total 76 people have been hospitalized and currently we have 31 hospitalized.
6003,I don't have a total of those who have been in the ICU but currently there are 6.
6004,Of those hospitalized 71% are vaccinated and 29% are unvaccinated.

6013,"And you need to define ‚Äútruly a lot.‚Äù  Supposing current mRNA vaccines are 99% effective against serious illness (somewhat less efficacious against infection of any kind), 1% of 170 million people is still a high number of people, but statistically a small number."
6014,Make sense?
6015,"Sucks if you‚Äôre in the 1%, but 1% is a tiny minority."
6016,"Additionally, you need to pay attention to the doctors and nurses observing that 96%(ish) of their hospitalized COVID patients are unvaxed, and those who are vaxed tend to be older (70+ on average) with milder cases."

6033,"The United States has the highest per capita healthcare costs and the worst health outcomes in the entire developed world, even after adjusting for lifestyle differences."
6034,It is because the American healthcare industry's primary function is wealth extraction rather than patient care.

6037,"They pay health insurance premiums, they pay nearly 200% excise tax, and if you are in America, each State has received millions (maybe billions) in settlement money."
6038,"If a smoker needs to be treated, they have already paid."
6039,"A couple of years ago, former Washington State Governor Christine Gregoire made the case that while raising the excise tax on tobacco products does reduce consumption, it also reduces State revenues."
6040,"So, if there are 8 million people in the State of Washington, and 12% of them smoke, let's say half a pack a day and the excise tax is $5/pack, that 875 million or so per year."
6041,My numbers may be a little off.
6042,"It's highly unlikely those monies are used for treatment, but if they were, then they've already paid, and then some."
6043,It's a specious argument.
6044,"Now, choosing to not get a vaccine which could drastically reduce the need for hospitalization is also a personal choice for which those people should be responsible for."
6045,"To be clear, I am not advocating or defending the use of tobacco products."

6065,Acronyms vary from hospital to hospital.
6066,I have worked in 4 different hospitals; in one hospital the CCU was critical care for cardiac patients and in another the same term was used for a step-down unit (between ICU and regular acuity beds).
6067,"In that particular case the CCU did take ventilated patients (some step-downs do not), but they could not have patients requiring titration of vasoactive drips because their nurse to patient ratio was 1:3."
6068,"It‚Äôs confusing, I know."
6069,"But if the facility is telling you they have a unit with a higher level of care (yet no beds available), then I would wager their CCU is similar to the step-down unit."
6070,Hope this helps.

6117,This is a state of 4.22 million people.

6214,What would be the consequence of banning/severely limiting travel nurses?
6215,where did he say that?
6216,You‚Äôre really missing the point here.
6217,"I will explain;

Let‚Äôs assume Covid kills 1% of people, as you stated originally."
6218,"Let‚Äôs also assume that if you are admitted to hospital you have perhaps a 5% chance of dying there (1 in 20 people dying who are admitted seems *very* high, but let‚Äôs go with it)."
6219,Now let‚Äôs assume that you are right and every single death caused in error (10%) is caused by an inexperienced nurse (also obviously an overestimate).
6220,"Even when we use those overly generous numbers, that means that if you go into hospital you have a 0.5% chance of dying at the hands of an inexperienced nurse - half of your stated Covid risk of 1%."
6221,"To match the the 1% Covid fatality rate you claimed, one in every ten hospital admissions would have to end in death."
6222,That of course is nonsense.
6223,Do you see?
6224,"Reread your initial sentence, it‚Äôs ludicrous."
6225,"Put another way, if you‚Äôre in hospital there is not a 10% chance that you‚Äôre going to die from a medical mistake."
6226,"If however you are *already dead* lying in the hospital morgue, there is a 10% chance a mistake killed you."
6227,"You‚Äôre mixing up your denominators, quite dramatically."
6228,They‚Äôre blocking virtual learning now too?
6229,Are you kidding?
6230,I would literally pack up my house and move.
6231,Do you have studies showing that Covid reduced gray matter in the brain?
6232,Shirt and shoe policies were anti-hippy mandates.
6233,anti-mask mandates are the same thing to them ‚Äúanti-liberal‚Äù
6234,Not to mention the staffing needed.
6235,"Yes, I can read."
6236,And what you describe isn‚Äôt how medicine works.
6237,We are very fortunate in the US to generally never have to consider the notion of rationed care.
6238,"The best parallel I can make is with organ transplantation, where there does need to exist a ‚Äúrationing‚Äù because the number of available organs is smaller than the number of transplant candidates."
6239,"Under no criteria that I am aware of does ‚Äúcause for need of transplant‚Äù come into play, except in how it effects suitability for transplant, life expectancy, medical need, survival benefit, etc."
6240,"Someone requiring a liver transplant because of prior alcohol abuse does not have a ‚Äúlower score‚Äù than someone requiring one due to a genetic disorder simply because of the origin of their illness (again, origin may play a role in how *other* factors score, but origin *itself* is not scored.)"
6241,So I can guarantee with almost absolute certainty that under no circumstances would vaccination status determine care decisions in the way you describe.
6242,"If anything it probably has a *better* effect at 12 weeks, but there's not enough studies yet."
6243,A small study on older people indicated that immune response was much better at 12 than 3/4 weeks.
6244,Nothing to worry about at all.
6245,"And even at 20, 30, 52, why would he not get one?"
6246,"Remember what a vaccine does, it prompts your body to make antibodies, which is good regardless of the interval."
6247,"Maybe you could reach out to the parents of the 400 kids who have died of Covid and see if they're living happy, normal lives?"
6248,Or maybe just some of the over a thousand that are currently hospitalized with Covid right now?
6249,The ones on vents perhaps?
6250,My kids are living a happy normal life with a mask on and with other precautions that any parent who gives a shit about their kids is taking.
6251,Take your gaslighting horseshit elsewhere.
6252,"Who came up with this ""theory""?"
6253,Sounds like you are trying to link the surge of covid hospitalizations to the supposedly abysmal state of the US healthcare?
6254,To me those are two separate issues.

6286,"There are plenty of incentives to get the vaccine, including reducing risk of death and hospitalization, and less risk of even infection and spread to others."

6324,Our Medicare is more nuanced with regard to payments.
6325,At the moment for instance the payment for giving a covid vaccine is $38.
6326,Since the patient has to be watched for 15 minutes to make sure that there is no anaphylaxis means 4 per hour.
6327,You can work out the hourly rate.
6328,A busy practice would employ a nurse at a set rate much below the Dr rate to administer the vaccines.
6329,If a doctor has other skills eg in dermatology then procedures pay better than a regular consult.
6330,Removing a skin cancer taking into consideration the high rate of skin cancer in Australia means that there are clinics that only focus on inspection of skin and removal of skin cancers.

6335,I mean if the patient had just returned home following a bone marrow transplant or a lung transplant or something then I can understand.

6337,Not to mention Medicare isn‚Äôt likely to pay for ‚Äúobservational‚Äù hospital stays.

6406,I‚Äôve had to start getting back out and working out again and trying to eat better.
6407,I am not a doctor but I can say that the stress of another covid wave has sent me into some depression that I am working through via better eating and workouts out.

6418,People who wanted already got the vaccine.
6419,"The only thing we can do is to vaccinate children, but that will not stop COVID-19, it will spread as easily as now."
6420,"Perhaps we should reward people for getting covid while unvaccinated, or give parents 1000 dollars for sending their child to school while sick?"
6421,Is this the first time a Republican has ever launched a campaign to give people unemployment for any reason?
6422,Sounds legit.
6423,This may be condemning children to grow up without a parent.
6424,Those kids didn‚Äôt choose for their parent not to get vaccinated.

6451,"However, there were  several paragraphs about health officials who thought he could do more, and then gave examples."
6452,I read the second one also.
6453,A tweet stating get your shots doesn't dazzle me either.
6454,I think the president should have been constantly encouraging people.
6455,Standing enthusiastically behind the science of the vaccines.
6456,Giving incentives.
6457,Getting his shot publicly.
6458,Unifying the country.
6459,"Which, I mean he said they were safe a couple times  true."
6460,He did not enthusiastically tell people what amazing science they really are.
6461,"At that point, and this one now, it needs to be drilled into people's head due to all the misinformation."
6462,Did you watch any of the video I linked?

6465,It's safe.
6466,It's effective.
6467,It's free.
6468,I think he said it at least 4 times.
6469,He encouraged any one with questions to go to a reputable source like their GP.
6470,He encouraged them to schedule their appointments.
6471,He thanks the ones who got their vaccine.
6472,He explains that it saves lives.
6473,He is giving incentives.
6474,This is not about the governor though.
6475,I'm just stating that if Trump (who had a history of spouting unverified facts about vaccines) had handled it differently we could very well be in a better place now.
6476,Smokers do pay more in some states.

6479,"I think that is the point they are trying to make, that there is no mandatory, socialized health insurance for everyone in the US."

6486,"I'm just pointing out that R0, which is what the commenter was using as the modeling basis for the calculation, is not relevant when you're looking at spread through communities where the susceptibility is not 100%."
6487,That's the basic assumption of the model.
6488,"When they try to calculate this on a new virus (or strains) they are modeling based approaches to eliminate factors like policy (lockdowns), masking, mobility, population density, and vaccination / prior infection."
6489,"They do this because R0 is believed to be an estimate the ""core ability"" of the virus to spread and has nothing to do with other factors."
6490,It's supposed to be an idealized number.
6491,"All said, it's true that R0 is very hard to estimate because of what you need to build into the model, and doesn't always get close to that ""intrinsic property"" that is intended."
6492,"For example, if some guy on his farm in Idaho is infected first from his animals, R0 will be lower."
6493,"If some guy in NYC is infected first, R0 will be higher."
6494,"The Rt (the *effective* R considering all the other factors like vaccination, lockdowns, etc.)"

6496,"The standard copy-paste response to that is bringing up the old slippery slope fallacy where they claim that will lead to exclusion of those who smoke, maintain obesity, etc."
6497,"However, what's missing from that is an understanding of just how trivially easy it is to get vaccinated compared to, for example, quitting smoking or losing weight."
6498,The remedy here couldn't be any easier.

6738,I find that people tend to have a blind spot when accessing risks within their family unit.
6739,"I know someone who took social distance very seriously and wfh, but ended up getting covid through his wife who was still working in the office."
6740,Yesterday I was on a Zoom meeting for a support group.
6741,In our area we are blessed with a high.vaccination rate.
6742,A guy joined and told how isolated he felt.
6743,Why?
6744,"He is feeling an increasing tone of ""shaming"" from the people who've been vaccinated."
6745,"He, on the other hand has been putting it off, w the usual rationalizations."
6746,"(He is not a personal of color)

IMO If you do civil disobedience you'd better accept there's going to be social fallout.Not everyone is going to hand you free coffee and cookies."
6747,I‚Äôve lost basically all empathy in the last year.
6748,I‚Äôm just going to look out for me and my family at this point until climate change destroys human civilization as we know it over the next 30 years.
6749,I blame these ignorant people for the situation we are in through their refusal to get the vaccine.
6750,"That said, there shouldn‚Äôt be hospital bills whatsoever."
6751,"As much as I want to punish these people for the damage they are doing, I won‚Äôt support that just to spite them when we should have universal healthcare."
6752,"I'll get flamed for asking, but here goes:

im not immunocompromised, offered a third shot."
6753,Any risk in taking it?
6754,My very basic understanding is that everyone needs it but politically bad move to say that now.
6755,Should I take it?
6756,There just simply isn‚Äôt going to be widespread support for a shutdown when there‚Äôs a simpler alternative.
6757,"When we shut down before, it‚Äôs because EVERYONE was in danger and there was no other option."
6758,Now you‚Äôre asking vaccinated people to shut everything down for the people who just choose to not get the vaccine?
6759,"And besides, the people who need the shutdown the most are just going to ignore it anyways."
6760,"They might not be able to go a few places, but they‚Äôll meet in large groups and go where they can."
6761,"All vaccine preventable diseases, for starters."
6762,Oh what joy üò°
6763,I wish I did!
6764,"Unfortunately I think the problem is accelerating as hospitals are forced to close due to lack of funds and lack of staffing, which leads to even fewer available clinical sites."
6765,"It's part of why there was so much talk about getting ahead of the virus and the possibility of healthcare collapse, but I think a lot of people are focused on the problems right in front of them and not on problems they don't see."
6766,Hospital staffing isn't a big issue for most people worried about paychecks and their own job...until they end up in the hospital and it's too late to worry about it.
6767,"I think the same could easily be said about the climate crisis or refugee crises, too."
6768,"American culture tends to focus on the immediate and the visible to the exclusion of anything long-term or distant, and making a giant culture change happen rapidly is next to impossible (this isn't exclusive to America, but since we're talking about American healthcare it's relevant)."
6769,"People pay a token amount of attention to climate change and might recycle, but don't give up eating beef or drinking bottled water because that's more immediately convenient or cheap, but the people dying in floods and fires would probably prioritize it."
6770,"With the hospitals, we could fund our hospitals outside of donations and elective surgeries so that they can staff adequately for emergencies or additional training, but people would rather their tax dollars went to roads and schools that they see every day."
6771,"I wish there were a quick-turnaround solution that would fix the issues, but until there's pretty drastic cultural *and* resulting systemic change the obstacles are pretty insurmountable."
6772,"If a whole country went to work to move a mountain it could get done pretty quickly, but if it's just a small town with some shovels you're still going to have a mountain by the end of the year."
6773,"Yeah I'm not disagreeing with you, only hypothesizing just why we seen that before but not now."
6774,"But it does pose an interesting study, what if there's other cross reactivity with vaccinations and other diseases, and why that exists."
6775,I think it would be huge benefit for public health if we could find those answers and may change how we treat diseases going forward.
6776,There's an incredible opportunity here to learn so much about how the human body works despite all the tragedy and there is so much we don't fully understand yet.
6777,"The average cost of one day in a US ICU with mechanical ventilation (forget ECMO or the Rotoprone rotisserie bed thing) is ~$11,000."
6778,Covid patients are sometimes there for MONTHS.
6779,&gt;The husband of Tennessee‚Äôs former vaccinations director said he and his wife are planning to move out of the state this fall amid growing tension over efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
6780,"&gt;Brad Fiscus told NBC News on Saturday that the couple's decision to move to northern Virginia sometime between mid-September and October was initially ""precipitated by the actions of the Tennessee Department of Health"" to fire¬†his wife, Dr. Michelle Fiscus,¬†this summer amid Republican outrage over her push to inoculate teenagers against Covid-19."
6781,"&gt;""Since Dr. Fiscus wanted to stay in public health, we were looking at where those opportunities would be,"" Brad Fiscus said."
6782,"&gt;As a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics board of directors, Michelle Fiscus already represents Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina."
6783,"&gt;""And Virginia, being near D.C., felt like the best place to move,"" her husband said."
6784,"&gt;While it was a difficult decision for the couple, who has lived in Tennessee for over two decades, ""it was the right decision,"" Brad Fiscus said, especially after what he experienced during a contentious school board meeting that he took part in Tuesday to discuss mask mandates."
6785,"&gt;""We're in an age of misinformation, distrust, and quick to be angry, and quick to protest."
6786,"And we have sort of shifted out of a timeframe of collaboration, understanding and empathy,"" he added."
6787,"""I think maybe the pandemic has turned that up somewhat."""
6788,&gt;Michelle Fiscus formerly served as medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization programs at the Tennessee Department of Health.
6789,She said the state‚Äôs elected leaders put politics over the health of children by firing her for her efforts to get more Tennesseans vaccinated.
6790,"&gt;A July letter from the state‚Äôs chief medical officer said Michelle Fiscus should be removed due to complaints about her leadership approach and her handling of a letter explaining vaccination rights of minors for Covid-19 shots, an effort that had GOP lawmakers fuming."
6791,Michelle Fiscus issued a point-by-point rebuttal to the letter.
6792,"&gt;Fiscus also noted consistent praise for her job performance, including years of performance reviews deeming her work ‚Äúoutstanding,‚Äù most recently for October 2019 through September 2020"

6800,"&gt; If you willingly are unvaccinated, you should not be allowed to have medical care if you catch covid."
6801,Where does that line of thinking end?

6803,"If you eat a lot of candy, no dental."
6804,"If you are type 2 diabetic, no insulin."

6812,But the populated areas in PA are HEAVILY vaccinated.
6813,"Bucks, Chester, Montgomery, Delaware and Philadelphia counties are all some of the highest vaccinated areas in the nation."
6814,Factual information and statistics absolutely matter.
6815,Are you saying they don‚Äôt?
6816,Do you not want to be informed about what is going on?
6817,Just like our power grid
6818,"Someone here seems to be stalking me after getting banned, which is quite pathetic really"
6819,"That is discrimination, since it's statistically likely that the unvaccinated person is impoverished/disabled."
6820,"A lot of Schools in VA and other mid Atlantic states are starting mid August this year, instead of after labor day, so they would be ablebto get kids caught up in time for SOL's."
6821,"At first I didn‚Äôt mind him, but once the pandemic hit he‚Äôs been an embarrassment."
6822,He seems to have libertarian values and hasn‚Äôt done a damn thing to make Knoxville safer.
6823,Recently he‚Äôs followed the typical boot licker path and has announced that he won‚Äôt support any mask or vaccination mandates.
6824,TN will keep making national headlines‚Ä¶ the governor of the state is arguably much worse.
6825,I understand the sentiment but we do also have to consider the reasons for not getting vaccinated.
6826,"Sure, some people might just be idiots, but others might have medical reasons, religious reasons, or a whole plethora of other reasons."
6827,"And as another comment mentioned, going down this path allows anti-healthcare lobbyists and politicians to claim that healthcare should be denied for any condition considered to be your fault."
6828,"It would have been better if the cdc set a target for overall vaccination rate for each county before it could go maskless, but damn I do not envy them for having to deal with public messaging to this country."
6829,Both true and false.
6830,Being healthy will for sure help you fight off illnesses of many varieties.
6831,But that doesn't make you immune.
6832,"But I'm sure there are for sure people out there that are immune to covid, even if there are only 1-2 in the entire world."
6833,Counting infections has become useless since the vaccine.
6834,The relevant numbers at the moment are hospitalizations and fatalities.

6847,*
6848,I hate that those masks were worn by basically every college football coach last season.
6849,It was the worst way to model protective measures to a demographic that definitely needed to see a good example.
6850,Yeah I‚Äôm at the point where I only feel bad that these idiots are taking space from other people who need intensive care.
6851,why are we not doing this in the US??
6852,?
6853,The NZ system is not an outlier in any negative way.
6854,It gets just as good outcomes as the ones you listed for some of the lowest per capita funding.
6855,NZ has very similar health outcomes and life expectancy to Australia and spends 1/4 what the US spends per capita.
6856,Vietnam and Cuba are certainly not as good as NZ.
6857,But it is also not as good as portrayed.
6858,It is standard to wait 4 months to see any specialist.
6859,Only generic drugs are subsidised in most cases.
6860,The wait for elective surgery is often 18 months to 2 years.
6861,"And that is not unique to NZ, there are similar complaints about the NHS."
6862,I'm not gonna lie.
6863,I've seen enough to make me feel sick over what I fear is coming.
6864,I keep telling myself I'm over reacting and I need to calm tf down.
6865,"Maybe I'm still processing, who knows."
6866,"Two weeks ago, I accompanied someone to the hospital bc the doctor sent them with priority based on bloodwork findings."
6867,"Not knowing what to expect, we grab a quick bite, we take some books to read, a power bank for our phones, the usual stuff for us."
6868,We are immediately stopped by a guard and made to look into a tablet that takes our temperature and are asked COVID related questions.
6869,We are allowed passage to get her registered to be seen and we take a seat.
6870,"As we are sitting there, I look around and notice we are in a little section of about nine seats."
6871,"Everything around us is sectioned off with these clear, plastic framed partitions on wheels."
6872,"I start paying more attention and I shit you not, every single person on the other side of those partitions in that waiting room, with the exception of 3 or 4 of the maybe 15 to 17 people there, were in wheelchairs."
6873,So I tell the accompanying party what I am noticing.
6874,"Now, I'm not smart."
6875,"I'm pretty stupid when it comes to things, I'll admit that."
6876,"It wasn't until a couple came in, that a guy kept jumping out of his wheelchair and hopping from one foot to another and saying ""I gotta stay awake, I can't fall asleep"" that I looked around again and noticed almost everyone in those wheelchairs was asleep."
6877,"Ok, all these people in wheelchairs, almost everyone sleeping, super creepy and surreal."
6878,It was the most quiet and crowded ER waiting room I've ever experienced.
6879,I try really hard not to freak out and I try to check in with my brain before I respond emotionally to external stimuli and look for other confirmations but today I went to the store to buy food.
6880,I felt a lot of how I felt when all of this reared it's ugly head.
6881,"A lot of food is gone, shelves looked sparse, most people standing away from other people and some even wearing double masks, which I completely understand."
6882,"I don't know why, but even though I was scared then, I feel even more so now."
6883,Maybe I'm tired of the uncertainty.
6884,Maybe that's what I fear or maybe it's the unknown.
6885,This article made me think of that ER room.
6886,"I know I'm sitting here sulking, bitching and complaining about my fears but I hope those people are ok."
6887,I think about that room often.
6888,Most vaccines aren't 100% yet have huge value.

6894,I‚Äôd rather have medicine.
6895,We still have no treatment.
6896,Yep.
6897,"Always a bit odd to me to see people who waited a year for themselves to be eligible to get a vaccine to now say let‚Äôs just let it rip now that I have mine, I‚Äôm not willing to wait a few more months until all kids are eligible."
6898,"Rate of increasing may be going down in FL, hopefully situation improves."
6899,"From India and UK's data, delta seems to crash relatively fast."
6900,"Can confirm, people are looking at me like I have a dick on my face when I wear a mask in Walmart since half the employees in businesses here aren't even wearing them."

6902,None of this should be happening right now.

6925,Problem with that strategy is a good portion of them now rightfully don‚Äôt like him because of the winter storm debacle.
6926,"He won‚Äôt lose to a Democrat, but he‚Äôs unlikely to survive a Republican primary."

6944,"NY may 'only' have a 60% fully vaccinated rate, but in mid-June we hit a 70% partial vax for adults (there was a fireworks show and all celebrating it lol), which partial vaccination still counts for a lot in terms of overall public health."
6945,Florida has been consistently lagging behind (the state is patchy and has a lot of extremely red demographics who will never get vaccinated) and it's only in this recent surge where people realized they might actually die did vaccinations really tick up overall.
6946,"While they'll start to see the benefits of this in a few weeks, it's still 'too little too late' in many ways with the current surge."
6947,"When Rt was high in early July, I'm pretty sure their vax rate was only in the 30's &amp; 40's, which is obviously a stark contrast from a place like NY having vaccination rates in the 50's, 60's &amp; 70's two weeks prior as what was a preparation for the oncoming Rt increase."
6948,"*-However, if you look at what occurred last year--south to north movement of the epidemic and what's occurring now in the UK/Israel with high levels of infection despite a higher level of vaccination, no region is going to escape an infection surge."
6949,"*

I agree with this, but I think more to my point is that we didn't escape it, we're in it."
6950,"August is likely it in terms of the ""worst"" for delta."
6951,It wouldn't really make sense for delta to hit a place like NY with a decreasing Rt for over a month now only to see the worst of it still yet to come.
6952,"You're correct that this is going to be ongoing patchy slog with different variables such as weather and behavior patterns with no definitive end in sight, but these waves also follow patterns."
6953,"When the Rt went above 1 on June 21st it was guaranteed in NY that we were going to see an uptick in cases, and now so long as the Rt continues to fall, even if cases still rise a little every week, once it goes below 1 then we are similarly guaranteed to see the wave drop."
6954,"I hope I'm not wrong and that cold weather and being forced indoors doesn't cause a terrible surge, but it's actually incredible how clear vaccination is really showing to be key in terms of our public health measures."
6955,"With increasing cases I keep expecting to see a huge increase in hospitalizations and our healthcare systems being overwhelmed, but that's just not happening."
6956,"When cases were *lower* than what we have right now, there was still a bigger increase in hospitalizations."
6957,Who would have thought that more than halfway through 2021 things would look as bad as they did during the surge at the beginning of the year?
6958,"When this all started I had several discussions with my son‚Äôs pediatrician about the lack of socializing due to covid and she said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need to be concerned with that until he‚Äôs closer to 3‚Äù (he was 6 months at the time)."
6959,Now I‚Äôm really starting to think I may need to worry‚Ä¶ we just made the decision to pull him from daycare (before he even went to his first day) because we don‚Äôt HAVE to send him.
6960,"There are no easy decisions, these days."
6961,They key word is ‚Äúwill‚Äù as in we‚Äôre not quite there yet - as evidenced by the strain on healthcare that delta‚Äôs caused.
6962,"It‚Äôll likely be endemic, but a lot of people who are, rightfully, tired are just throwing in the towel and saying ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs not going away, so I‚Äôll move on.‚Äù However in  large parts of the US that policy hasn‚Äôt worked out so well."

6968,I think we'll continue to see regional outbreaks from time to time.
6969,They will continue to be worse in states that have bad vaccination rates and bad compliance with mitigation measures.
6970,we didn't have a national lockdown.
6971,each state announced their decisions on different days based on their own choices.
6972,some states never even locked down...but you know that
6973,I don't think anybody here recommends full lockdown until Covid-19 is extinct.

7031,"Humble question: if the supply is abundant, and the demand for a 3rd shot is strong (assuming the doses cannot be shipped to other countries before they expire), what is the downside to a person who was vaccinated in March getting a third shot in September?"

 https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/covid-19-vaccines-are-free/"
7047,Huh?
7048,I think you are missing the point.
7049,Vaccines are not 100% and were never touted to have 100% efficacy.
7050,That doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt work.
7051,"Also, the more of the population vaccinated, the higher the proportion of vaccinated breakthrough cases."
7052,"To take an extreme example - If 100% of the population is vaccinated , then 100% of cases will be in the vaccinated."
7053,But that doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccines don‚Äôt work.

7058,Improvement isn't difficult when the US has literally the worst healthcare system in the developed world.
7059,It's a very low bar.
7060,It's like finding out there's a wealthy country with no public education system.
7061,It's crazy that's still the situation.
7062,But the way many liberals talk about single payer make it sound like the solution to everything.
7063,It's all rainbows and unicorns.
7064,"No, it's very much like public education."
7065,"You're glad you have it, but there's a lot of problems."
7066,"Just show them their tweets, tell them they‚Äôre smarter than the doctors anyway, and if they get real feisty have security flash their piece."
7067,I wish we could do that here in the US.
7068,Hospitals are completely full due to anti-vaxxers.
7069,It‚Äôs not a reasonable response for us.
7070,"It actually started over a decade ago, when some of the wealthy, like Mercer, Bannon, and others realized that they could rile up the ‚Äúforgot about‚Äù in the rust belt, Midwest and south."
7071,"They are not educated, but easy to get enraged and angry by playing to their ‚Äúthinking skills‚Äù by letting them believe they are smarter than they are given credit for."
7072,"The ironic part is that the wealthy, like Bannon and Trump, were very good at making this demographic feel like they empathize with them and that they were one of them, even though they are the same wealthy group that are intentionally manipulating them."
7073,"They use multiple platforms to spread conspiracy their ties, mistrust and ‚Äútruth bombs‚Äù."
7074,"When people are economically and mentally depressed, angry, and feel helpless, you can fuel those feelings and use that rage and anger to your advantage."
7075,"The end game is to divide and distract the masses, while they control everything behind the curtain."
7076,"Most people were busy fighting over Trump in late 2019, that they didn‚Äôt even notice that we had a near-crisis in the overnight Repo market."
7077,"When everyone is busy watching the circus, being distracted over the latest social unrest, outrage, and clickbait headline, always pay attention to who is pulling the strings behind the curtain."
7078,There‚Äôs not a lot of stuff that I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to do outside of the house if I choose not to.
7079,Groceries can be delivered and my wife and I know our way around the kitchen.
7080,Amazon and Walmart.com (as much as I‚Äôm not a fan of supporting Walmart) can pretty much handle anything else I might need/want.
7081,"But when there‚Äôs stuff I have to go out for, I have a stack of N95s‚Ä¶"
7082,A lot of tests can screen with decent accuracy for variants.
7083,"A PCR test looks for a specific RNA sequence, and usually three of them are run."
7084,"If you make one of those be a sequence only found in Delta, you get a pretty accurate screen for Delta."
7085,"But of course you can't scale that up to screening for all VOC's, only for a couple of the most significant mutations."
7086,Excuse my ignorance but how are the different variants being identified?
7087,Is the test sample forwarded for extra testing to determine the variant?
7088,I‚Äôm presuming that‚Äôs how but I‚Äôve no real knowledge about such things.
7089,that makes all this premeditated murder
7090,"I'm worried about this myself, living in Ohio."
7091,They already have a masking culture plus very low obesity which helps a lot.
7092,I am a physician.
7093,I'm in a place where cases are ramping up.
7094,In the past 2 days I've admitted 4 COVID+ kids to the hospital.
7095,None were there with COVID as the primary reason for admission.
7096,"For me, the spike was much worse last winter, but as I said, we're only just starting to ramp up now over the past 2-3 weeks."
7097,"The sickest kid I've seen from COVID was a very obese 17 year old (roughly 400lbs) who required BIPAP, but he did okay."
7098,I haven't seen any kids under 10 require so much as a whiff of oxygen unless they had very severe developmental delays compromising their neurologic status.
7099,"I wouldn't be more scared of COVID for my kids than I would be of the flu- granted, you can get a flu shot every year though the effectiveness can be hit or miss."
7100,I haven't seen the Delta variant make kids sicker.
7101,"I actually wonder if it causes less MIS-C because last December, we were admitting three kids with MIS-C per week, but I haven't seen one since February."
7102,"If you have an autoimmune history in your family, the complication I would fear the most is COVID being a trigger for Type 1 Diabetes; anecdotally we've seen a LOT of that."
7103,One week in December I admitted 18 new onset Type 1s and 15 had some kind of viral trigger.
7104,"I've taken care of over 20 kids with active cancers who've incidentally tested positive for COVID, and none of them required oxygen, convalescent plasma, steroids, or remdesivir."
7105,Vaccine trials for kids are obviously awesome but I do want them to be more thorough with kids.
7106,No one should be able to say we rushed the trials.
7107,"We need to be very careful with the littles, especially as COVID poses not a lot of direct risk to them."
7108,"It does feel frustratingly slow, but I trust that the FDA is doing what it needs to do."
7109,I wouldn't try to rush the EUA for kids under 12.
7110,"All the world's resources are being diverted towards this, and it's telling that *no* country has approved it for kids under 12- that's indicative of the fact that it's not just US inefficiencies causing the issue."
7111,"In general, not a lot of medications are approved for kids, which can be frustrating, but that's just how it is."
7112,I've seen a couple kids under 2 months get COVID.
7113,Most of them never even actually get a fever.
7114,"However, if they *do* get a fever, they have to stay in the hospital because for any infant under 60 days, we have to do a full workup and monitor them for 36 hours to make sure they don't have sepsis, even if their fever is likely due to their COVID."
7115,Every hospitalized neonate I've seen in COVID was super well appearing and went home after the 36 hour rule out period.
7116,"So yes they are hospitalized primarily for COVID for safety reasons, but they're not getting that sick from it."
7117,No one seems to care about my opinion on this sub though.
7118,Everyone just wants to downvote and insist this is as bad for kids as small pox or measles.
7119,I can do cardio at home.
7120,I have a nice treadmill and a big-screen TV right in front of it.
7121,"But I agreed to do some beta fitness pilot for free in exchange for my feedback, and it runs another three weeks so I'm going to this new gym for that."
7122,"It's way too expensive and fancy for me to afford after the free beta, I only am doing it because free and we USED to have water aerobics before they closed the indoor pool because of covid."
7123,"But cardio in a mask sucks, and I'd rather do it at home without a mask on the treadmill."
7124,"Strength training I could do at home as I don't do much and I have handweights and exercise bands, I'm a middle-aged woman and not some power lifter so I don't need much equipment."
7125,But I like going to Planet Fitness for the machines.
7126,Masks suck less when doing strength training (but still kinda suck).
7127,But people aren‚Äôt doing what they need to even limit the virus on an acceptable in so much of the US.
7128,We have the vaccine and yet we have serious illness and deaths and overrun hospitals.
7129,It‚Äôs not realistic to assume that a minimal approach accepting risk will work unless people get on board with vaccines.
7130,It‚Äôs not going to happen.

7331,Do you care to elaborate on what you said then?
7332,I don‚Äôt like them
7333,What you wrote was literally a nothing sandwich.
7334,There is a reason people who are obese are one of the largest at risk.
7335,You  made generalizations and ignored statistics of people who are at lowest risk and those of highest.
7336,They were expecting someone with a conscience and some meager amount of ethical standard to be elected.
7337,The founding fathers belief in voting was grounded on the fact that the voters are educated.
7338,They did not anticipated the Fox News audience we have today.
7339,What they really need is bootstraps with which to pull themselves up
7340,"The stats for the current variants show this, this is a new variant and it is not yet known how much it escapes vaccines."
7341,Good
7342,That is so insane.
7343,I‚Äôm so sorry.
7344,Agreed.
7345,"That, though, won't happen unless there were an absolutely extraordinary circumstance, likely one that involved criminal activity."
7346,"Not that I don't feel his behavior isn't criminal as it is, but if they removed him for the shenanigans he's been up to with respect to COVID, I'd eat my hat."
7347,"The old Hippocratic oath, ‚ÄúFirst of all do no harm‚Äù, sure makes sense to me, and I think it‚Äôs much safer to the public if public servants such as police officers and nurses are safely vaccinated!"
7348,if you can‚Äôt get the shot you shouldn‚Äôt be interacting with a vulnerable public!
7349,"(And p.s., it doesn‚Äôt hurt a bit.)"
7350,Your cat should run for governor of Florida
7351,"Maybe you were just really busy a few days ago, because this was semi big news and on the front page of various places, including reddit."
7352,"It was a big reason why young people died very frequently during the Spanish Flu, much higher rate than normal."
7353,Body just kicks into overdrive and overexerts itself and you die from the stress.
7354,"https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/i8j6uc/watching_alex_jones_sprint_as_fast_as_he_can_is/g18w3qt/

7355,When he says this he's trying to portray himself as an anti-communist as that's what his base feeds on but it's total BS...
7356,He's a scum politician just like the rest of them
7357,has it?
7358,Sources would be good with these kinds of claims.
7359,Exactly!
7360,Just think of all the other drugs they are given while in the hospital.
7361,Why are they ok with taking all those but not the vaccine?
7362,I have the answer.
7363,Because they are illogical and just plain stupid.
7364,"I overheard someone saying that going to the hospital is what kills you, because ""they pump you full of antibiotics and it lets the virus get control."""
7365,Apparently if you just stay home you are okay.
7366,"Their evidence was a handful of people they knew that all died from COVID-19 in the hospital and ""you never hear about people dying at home"""
7367,I believe you are confusing fast offerings with tithing.
7368,‚ÄúOnly the bishop and his counselors may receive tithes and other offerings.
7369,"Under no circumstances should their wives, other members of their families, clerks, or other ward members receive these contributions."
7370,"The only exception is when Aaronic Priesthood holders are assigned to collect fast offerings (see 34.4.2).‚Äù See 34.6.1

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/34-finances-and-audits?lang=eng"
7371,Unlike my wife's Muslim coworker who refused to get vaccinated and cited religious reasons.
7372,All the unvaccinated who end up in the hospital with massive bills the insurance company has to pay out will end up increasing everyone‚Äôs premiums.
7373,The unvaccinated should pay a higher premium just like they already do with smokers to offset some of those cost.
7374,If nothing else the higher premiums might incentivize some people to get vaccinated.
7375,New Orleans is require proof of vaccination or negative test so there is that.
7376,And that's how you die of Covid without catching it.
7377,"That one is definitely up there but ""illegals"" and Obama's birthday party are the current leaders."
7378,So they're copying the Florida model.
7379,But why?
7380,Don't we have like 400 mil doses on order already?

7389,They just don't heal once those alveoli are damaged or gone.

7403,So much winning.
7404,Florida is #1!

7410,"What's hilarious is people will pay $400 for a fake vaccination card when you can get a real one for free, and some counties will even pay you $100 each time you get a shot."
7411,"Get caught with a fake card and you'll likely lose your job, get heavily fined, possibly lose your health insurance."
7412,My sister is in Texas in a major city.
7413,"She's pregnant, has tons of health issues, made up some stupid bullshit about how masks hurt her face, refuses to get vaccinated."
7414,"My parents and I have been begging her to take the most basic of precautions,  just to stop going to large indoor events."
7415,She posted several videos of a fucking rodeo and her daughters cheer camp in the past 48 hours.
7416,"That was all after I begged her to do anything, even the smallest of protecting herself and her baby."
7417,"She doesn't respond to any of our messages, refuses to discuss it."
7418,I'm terrified for her.
7419,I didn‚Äôt think you were talking about yourself.
7420,"I don't think you can compare deaths between other countries at all really, as every county counts them differently."

7424,Makes no sense to me at &gt;25k cases but thats the report I'm seeing.
7425,"For many people, most of their Facebook friends live in the same state they do."
7426,This means that people in pro-vax states are being pushed to get vaccinated while people in anti-vax states are being pushed the opposite direction.
7427,This is one reason why states are so different.

7434,*
7435,&gt;I pretty clearly said was was pro vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.
7436,Where did I say you weren't?
7437,&gt;I brought up their knowledge base to say they weren't the ones making medical decisions.
7438,"You didn't say that, don't be disingenuous."
7439,"You said they don't have full medical knowledge, as compared to a doctor, as an excuse for their decision to not get a vaccine."
7440,"But that simply isn't true, and infection control is a integral part of a nurse's training."
7441,&gt;why I think divisive language is making the antivax movement stronger.
7442,Because mollycoddling and pandering to anti-vaxxers worked so well previously?
7443,"&gt;Your comment doesn't have the goal of trying to increase vaccinations, and will actually probably reduce them."
7444,"Or, realize that comments will have little impact on vaccination rates and that actions matter far more."
7445,"In this case, the ultimatum is what will force them to get vaccinated or otherwise."
7446,&gt;Its just pandering to the other polarized redditors for fake internet points.
7447,"Nah, I'm calling a spade a spade."
7448,Not really interested in pandering to antivaxxers who are just sucking up all the resources at this point.
7449,I am pretty sure Memphis is the main FedEx hub.
7450,Major transportation hub for FedEx should be in Memphis
7451,"True, but insurance companies typically don't bear that cost, Medicare does."
7452,They were making the virus and it got out.
7453,About 90% of people in the part of San Diego I live in are back to wearing masks indoors.
7454,It‚Äôs about 50-60% outside.
7455,[deleted]
7456,It's one of the main arguments for anti-vax.
7457,Body has an immune system and a healthy body/immune system doesn't need to be 'supplemented' (or the duper crazies might even say poisoned) with vaccines.
7458,Dummies just don't get it and are rolling the dice.
7459,Ok so C19 is like a fart and masks are like underpants
7460,[deleted]
7461,Okay but what does that have to do with proving Moderna is for sure better than Pfizer?
7462,I don't know why you are being downvoted but you are right.
7463,"Even highly vaccinated states don't have the percentage required for true herd immunity against a variant, because each community will be at different levels."
7464,Until everyone who can be vaccinated is vaccinated we will have problems against variants and the more unvaccinated propagate the virus the more variants arise that can actually be variant enough to evolve a different enough protein envelope to where we have to start over from scratch.
7465,I‚Äôll do it if you want me to.
7466,I have no qualms with that at all
7467,How do you figure?
7468,I don‚Äôt really have to go anywhere if I don‚Äôt want to.
7469,If a mask is required I can easily stay home or go somewhere that doesn‚Äôt require one.
7470,It‚Äôs fairly simple.
7471,If CDC implements some sort of indoor mask mandates for businesses or schools I simply don‚Äôt go.
7472,If a business elects to impose their own mask mandate whether or not the CDC has one I simply don‚Äôt go.
7473,"So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just ignoring the rules, I am imposing my own boycott."
7474,If it damages the businesses or economy?
7475,Fuck em.
7476,"If you're a nurse who has no medical reason not to, yes, you should be getting the vaccine, especially once FDA approval goes through."
7477,His Dr. Told him it's unlikely he could get exemption.
7478,He's had 1 shot
7479,"""Yes."
7480,Yes.
7481,Go head.
7482,"Tell us it's the Cubans""."

7484,"Then he should consult with his doctor about his risk with the vaccine, and which one is best for him."
7485,That's the best person he should be asking.
7486,I thought this was established early on in the pandemic?
7487,&gt;Building a new hospital or wing takes a very long time.
7488,They can't do that overnight.
7489,Wasn't it the case that last year [the Army Corps of Engineers turned hotels and into ICU rooms](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/temporary-hospitals-coronavirus)?
7490,I still clearly remember listening to Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite giving a detailed report on how that was achieved.
7491,In March 2020 it seemed like this would be a non-issue.
7492,"I get it with the need for staff, but that's no longer an ""no ICU beds left"" issue."
7493,Per paycheck.
7494,$1300 most likely.
7495,It has to do with managing mutations.
7496,I have a coworker who thinks this.
7497,"He says that because he‚Äôs been traveling through the pandemic, dealing with and interacting with people who have been sick with it, and still testing negative means he‚Äôs immune to it."
7498,"I told him to be immune from it, you‚Äôd have to have had it at some point."
7499,He disagrees.
7500,I hate working with him
7501,It's the same they charge smokers actually.
7502,Who was/is the director of this lab?
7503,Has there been any history of coronavirus related infections in workers there?
7504,Have any staff members at this lab been found stealing animal specimens?
7505,And perhaps selling them at a nearby live meat market?
7506,Was this lab closed and/or sealed for any period of time circa late 2019?
7507,And media will go along with ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù.
7508,Side of science or death deserve the same attention nowadays.
7509,Depressing.
7510,You don't wear a seatbelt either I take it.
7511,Let me ask you this.
7512,Is it fair that the 2.7 million immuno-compromised people are forcibly excluded from public life because others choose to not get vaccinated?
7513,"Because even though I'm vaccinated, I'm also immuno-compromised and even with the vaccine there's still a good risk of me catching it and if I catch it, it'll likely kill me."
7514,So is it fair that people like me have to be shut out of society while those who choose not to get vaccinated get to do whatever they want?
7515,As of 04/08/2021 I am fully vaccinated with Pfizer.
7516,I attended my second larger event last Saturday for a friends birthday celebration and tested positive for COVID-19 as a result.
7517,"My symptoms have been incredibly mild (low grade fever/chills, mild body aches, slight congestion)."
7518,Today I lost my sense of taste and smell as well.
7519,"If you‚Äôre vaccinated, have tested positive, and have lost your sense of taste/smell, how long did it take to come back?"
7520,I wish insurance companies would refuse to cover unvaccinated people who get diagnosed with covid
7521,[deleted]
7522,"&gt; Even in well-vaccinated areas, infected visitors are passing on the virus to vaccinated people."
7523,"Yeah, but so few it is hardly worth mentioning."
7524,I really wish the media would stop harping on this irrelevant factor.
7525,96-99% of the infections are in UNvaccinated people.
7526,^
7527,How are they reporting 28 29 27 deaths per day?
7528,?
7529,"The highest flu death rate in the last ten years was 61,000 in 2017-2028."
7530,For the entire United States.
7531,Most years it was much less than that.
7532,Texas covid-19 deaths have surpassed the annual US death rate from flu for most of the last ten years.
7533,"In fairness the covid deaths are since the epidemic began, so it's not a true comparison."
7534,"It's been theorized for awhile now that in some cases, viruses have been a trigger for adult onset type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune issues."
7535,"When our immune systems react to our own body tissues, there are other cells that produce signals that tell the killer T cells to essentially 'calm down, go inert' so we don't attack our own tissues."
7536,It's possible that having a virus present allows that signal to be ignored or overwhelmed.
7537,"When we have an infection, we have a ton of other signals being produced that tell killer T-cells 'there's a problem here, do your job'."
7538,Too much of the latter signal present when your immune system is identifying the wrong threat can lead to autoimmune issues.
7539,"We still don't typically say with certainty that any specific patient acquired type 1 diabetes from a virus unless it was very clear that an infection came right before the issue, and there are other factors at play like genetic predisposition (I have a mutation in CTLA4 so my immune system is less capable of making the 'calm down' signal.)"
7540,Right now the statistics between adult onset T1D and COVID are very concerning.
7541,Do keep in mind this is for a week and not a day.
7542,We were around 25k/week at the worst of the winter surge.
7543,Seems to be people think I‚Äôm talking about myself.
7544,Fully vaccinated here and totally speaking on the thoughts of the anti-vax crowd.
7545,You already know.
7546,My father had severe diabetic seizures and had to be intubated years ago.
7547,He only lived for a year after that and couldn‚Äôt walk well and had confusion because his lungs couldn‚Äôt function properly then he passed away.
7548,I agree with you.
7549,I wouldn't step on this flight if even one mechanic of an airline said something like that.
7550,I'd boycott the whole airline for a long time.
7551,"And yet we have healthcare, which is an essential service, filled with these morons."
7552,"I was in South Carolina recently for a beach holiday and apparently requiring face coverings during a pandemic represent intolerable government oppression, but if I don't wear a cloth covering over my nipples on a deserted beach I'll get arrested by a sheriff's deputy that drives up and down the beach every 2 hours just to make sure"
7553,this guy looks like if racism was a person
7554,Because suddenly people insist it was actually hand washing and distancing.
7555,It makes no sense.
7556,"People are not really distancing as they should, and they aren‚Äôt lining up at the wash rooms every hour for a 30 second hand wash with hot water and soap."
7557,Quit your job.
7558,You are not guaranteed employment in a free country.
7559,If the boss says ‚Äúget the shot‚Äù you need to get the shot.
7560,In a free country you can not get the shot and you can get fired for it.
7561,Welcome to Freedom.

7568,Maybe this info could be helpful
7569,Always liked those Mormons.
7570,As a German I find this analogy very disturbing.
7571,The first wave of infections and deaths were among healthcare workers exposed to large amounts of the virus.
7572,"Not all healthcare workers are healthy, but they trend younger and healthier than the general public, especially residents and medical students."
7573,[removed]
7574,The irony of these being shipped from China...
7575,"Agreed, Gottlieb is my personal favorite expert and has been throughout all of this."
7576,"Very based, grounded, and realistic."
7577,"He was also a, in my opinion, very good fda commissioner."
7578,Nope.
7579,Not what I wrote or claimed but that is a cute strawman.
7580,Land of the free.
7581,Liberty or death.
7582,I don't know how you read that into my statement.
7583,"If a variant develops that would escape the vaccine, we'd have to start over with a new vaccine for everyone in the US to be protected."
7584,Doesn't mean you'll die unless you choose not to get vaccinated again.
7585,Sounds good.
7586,Weed out the idiots.
7587,"No you really don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs quite ok but I appreciate it."
7588,This is too nice of an exchange for Reddit!
7589,A comorbidity is a disease process in parallel to another one.
7590,Saying people with multiple simultaneous disease processes are more likely to need medical help is the equivalent of saying ‚Äúwater is wet.‚Äù It is not what I claimed and it is not germane.

7600,"Every restaurant PACKED in park city, INSIDE, no masks anywhere."
7601,"Heber city with all the families with 8 kids, NO MASKS anywhere."
7602,Was glad to get out of that spreader state.
7603,Good riddance
7604,Football will be super spreader events all over the nation.
7605,Not just the NFL but highschool and college will have relaxed masked and vaccination requirements.

7608,"So are the majority of people, could be sample bias"
7609,Hi all!
7610,It looks like the University of Florida expects them to peak around 8/18 - It‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens.
7611,Do they follow it up with ‚ÄúChinese lab‚Äù?
7612,I swear these people are about as smart as parrots.
7613,It's on of the ways people die from Covid.
7614,Basically the immune system goes overboard.

7632,Are you seriously and legitimately implying that these people would have the same chances at dying from Covid?
7633,Patients can‚Äôt tell the difference most of the time.
7634,My badge even says ‚Äúimaging‚Äù and yet I still get called nurse all the time.
7635,"I'm 63 and I seem to remember that some of the vaccines you get at birth needed boosters prior to attending public school in NY, USA."
7636,"I remember some kind of cocktail where some of the vaccines were 'boosters',  maybe tetanus?"
7637,Dr. Scott Gotleib (Pfizer board) predicts endemic status fairly  soon.
7638,His prediction track record seems good.
7639,Um...they can't charge more...yet.
7640,Companies would have to renegotiate their contract with insurance providers and renegotiate employment contracts with every employee.
7641,"But in theory, yes, they could charge more for preexisting conditions."
7642,"Sure you‚Äôve got your CNA, but I‚Äôm talking proper registered nurses."

7671,Can we get a discount for being vaccinated?
7672,Or do prices only go up?
7673,Welp.
7674,Guess who‚Äôs less crazy than the Republicans?
7675,iT's beCAusE oF tHe iMmIgRanTs.
7676,I tried to explain this : the surge is because of lack of vaccination.

7678,"But all he does is watch 24 news on ""Murds""  channel."
7679,UGH!
7680,I'm so tired of the propaganda &amp; misinformation.
7681,Bruh
7682,I don't know if it's illegal.

7686,I work in a hospital and there are only a couple I know of with good reasons not to be vaccinated.
7687,The others are against it because of Facebook groups.
7688,"No actual scientific reason, just conspiracies."
7689,So sad but they need to go.
7690,So how are people getting the third dose?
7691,Using a site with no internet connectivity and lying when asked?
7692,Even mobile sites are connected.
7693,"What about getting a new driver's license with my until now, never used married name?"
7694,[deleted]
7695,Agree..
7696,I'm not surprised at all.
7697,I feel like new parents are being more neglectful in general and not always on purpose.
7698,It's because of being forced to work longer hours and both parents being absent to keep up with expenses.
7699,"It's also internet addictions from social media, watching streaming etc."
7700,"It's exhausting just to stay afloat alone and the parents are too drained to interact with their children, so they use their smartphones to entertain and is essentially a substitute parent."
7701,I am genuinely worried for our future generations.
7702,Climate change alone is already horrifying and now emotionally neglected children will have to live in this harsh world they're not equipped for.
7703,"Yes, they told you to hate gay people."
7704,It's really disgusting the way you continously apologize for and defend the church while claiming you're not currently a member.
7705,"The racist, abusive, homophobic, transphobic, repressive mormon church is not the sunny org you claim it is."
7706,But since you're a straight guy you see no problem with it.
7707,Full vaccination takes 6+ weeks and approval still won't happen for a few weeks yet.
7708,We won't have a vaccine for kids until January at the current rate.
7709,There aren't enough mandates to completely suppress a full wave though healthcare worker mandates will help with hospitals and clinics.
7710,Vaccines do not poof you to full herd immunity overnight and the holiday gathering season is very close.
7711,If you're waiting until September and October in the middle of sports and school to prevent holiday spread you're behind the game and playing catch up.
7712,You need to be prepared for school spread in July and holiday spread no later than October.
7713,I suppose.
7714,"I'm just of the opinion the true win would be for this anti vax bullshit, especially among healthcare workers, to stop."
7715,&gt; living with the virus‚Äîthe same way we live with the cold and flu.
7716,The problem with that is this *isn‚Äôt* the cold or flu.
7717,It‚Äôs a much more deadly virus that has a huge impact on the health care system.
7718,That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt do it.
7719,Every time we let our guard down ICUs get slammed.
7720,When‚Äôs the last time Mississippi called in a Navy Hospital ship for flu season?
7721,&gt;The US alone donated 80m doses.
7722,That's shameful - not something to be proud of
7723,"Hey, I‚Äôve been there."

7726,You‚Äôre not alone!
7727,I  thought Bandar Bush loved kids
7728,Medical insurance companies will just pass the cost onto the employers with higher risk employees and how much they have to outlay to cover those employees.
7729,"To give you an example, my fiance and I were looking to put me on her plan with her employer but her employer has a fairly aged workforce and the rates would be higher for a higher deductible than I get through Obamacare."
7730,The only reason why it's worth it for her to be on it alone is that the single plan is basically a free benefit.

7742,"Yes - because we should value humans equally, not matter their background."

7747,Cdc did a presentation yesterday where they are recommending it for the immunocompromised.
7748,"I think it‚Äôs inevitable, and I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot of the recent vaccinations are folks getting 3rds"
7749,"People with comorbidities have a significantly higher chance of being hospitalized/dying, and the data/stats show this."
7750,And Covid is a respiratory disease‚Ä¶ people with smoke obviously have a higher chance of being hospitalized or dying from it I can‚Äôt believe you actually commented that crap.
7751,My dad would be a little better informed if he listened to local TV.
7752,"He'd at least know more about covid, instead of more about bamboo ballots from China or whatever."
7753,"Yeah, that's true."
7754,"Btw, from what you know, my parents (who are 71 and 72) got the Pfizer vaccine back in March and April."
7755,"Since the efficacy has wanted a bit by now for them, are they still protected against severe infection from the Delta variant?"
7756,(They will definitely get the third booster shot once it becomes available.)

7775,"I'd be terrified to be treated by someone who told me ""don't take the vaccine because of microchips"" or whatever fb excuse they've seen posted."

*""There seems to be little difference in the chances of getting sick between vaxed and unvaxed, especially for the vulnerable, according to the article."
7887,"It seems we‚Äôre being sold a bill of goods with these vaccines""*

*""Per the CDC website, it‚Äôs still true that 70 - 80% of unvaxed that get or have gotten the virus have no to mild to moderate symptoms, and the article says that vaxed are about the SAME."
7888,"Doc also points out the Pfizer jab, that I got, is down to 42% EFFICACY!"

7971,"The literal definition of this term is having *more than one disease*, not *more than one risk factor*."
7972,"Risk factors like smoking may or may not play *any* role in your own personal experience should you get COVID, it's pretty random."
7973,"Having said that, I have heard of studies that suggest smokers, people in proximity to wildfires and very unhealthy people are at slightly higher risk of getting more sick if they do get COVID, but literally everyone has some combination of risk factors that may or may not factor in at all."
7974,"So yes, as the previous poster said, this virus does what it wants."
7975,Church was canceled entirely until they got zoom meetings set up and even now they have strict guidelines for how many people can be inside.

7986,"It's not a matter of legal liability, it's a matter of ethics."
7987,The very fact that you brought lawyers and covering asses into this is missing the point.
7988,We don't turn them away because that's punitive and frankly cruel.
7989,"It's a person making a choice as to who gets a bed rather than circumstance, which is an ethical line medicine should never cross."
7990,I understand hospitals and medicine is at the breaking point in a lot of these regions.
7991,"And I'm firmly anti-""antivax."""

7998,The Border Patrol has jurisdiction 100 miles from the border or any coastline.
7999,The death toll of the ACW was absolutely horrific.
8000,Approximately 2.5% of the total US population died as a result of the war ([Source](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/statistics-civil-war)).
8001,That would be the equivalent of around 8 million today when taken as a percentage of the population.

our leaders have been saying this since the **very beginning**."
8008,They were some of the first ones to get vaccinated...they've been telling us the vaccines are miracles from God...they've been asking us to mask up and stay socially distanced.
8009,Meanwhile the parents are outside protesting mask mandate and act like jerks.
8010,What was uncivil about it?
8011,"Yeah, in NY, Saratoga County is the highest at 66% of all people fully vaccinated, but the lowest county is at 35%."
8012,Not that much different from Florida where it's 69%-22%.
8013,The biggest difference is if Gov Hochul imposes more restrictions and mask/vaccine mandates this winter than DeSantis has.
8014,The only question is why they didn‚Äôt push this sooner.
8015,Should change the messaging that they are scared of a little needle
8016,"Too bad so many people wont wear masks, and act like there is a Pandemic going on."
8017,Iceland exists.
8018,There's your data.
8019,Also 62 to 76 is a much smaller difference than 82 to 42 and probably isn't statistically significant.
8020,Pfizer is worse every month in those numbers with the biggest drop in July when Delta took over almost totally.
8021,Delta has only increased each month in recent months.
8022,I think there's very little chance this data is incorrect.
8023,"I just learned about it earlier in the day myself from another comment, so I thought I would share :)"
8024,N95 is designed for smaller particles than pm2.5 isn't it?
8025,I think pm2.5 is 2.5Œºm while N95's filter out 0.3Œºm particles and greater.
8026,That would make them great for pm2.5 at least.
8027,Very interesting article that shows us in numbers how much official stats and actual stats can differ.
8028,I'm sorry we're having to go through this kind of stuff.

8047,Cool.
8048,This was the response  I was looking for.
8049,Thank you.
8050,You changed a mind.
8051,I had covid last November and had the vaccine (not sure which kind) last March.
8052,I started coming down with covid symptoms again 4 days ago.
8053,"I took 2 tests that both showed I'm negative, but today I lost my taste and smell."
8054,Anyone have something similar happen?
8055,Beautiful
8056,Wtf does that even mean?
8057,[removed]
8058,"Yes, because there more people, especially young children that haven't been exposed to it."
8059,"Furthermore, if you think this is bad, get your flu shot this year."
8060,We're likely in for a rough winter
8061,"My wife is an RN at a clinic for a large hospital, and she said one of the doctors there is leaving due to requiring vaccination."
8062,"Not sure what the plan is, since all the big hospitals are requiring it."
8063,KN95 masks may fit children better.
8064,I've worn both and I would say I prefer the KN95 for errands and day to day use.
8065,It's going to be way higher.
8066,My employer is requiring proof of vaccination for compliance with our wellness program.
8067,No wellness compliance = no premium subsidy.
8068,That's a mighty steep increase.
8069,Easily +$500 a month at least for a full family to be covered under our policy.
8070,That‚Äôs fine.
8071,My patience is long gone when it comes to anti-vaxers...I have no pity left for anyone willingly keeping us in this situation as a whole society for the sake of their ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù.
8072,I‚Äôve done everything right for 16 months and I still can‚Äôt get back to normal because of other people‚Äôs actions.
8073,I‚Äôm tired and frustrated.
8074,"If cutting them off from privileges through mandates and vaccine passports is what it takes to get us out of this, I‚Äôm all for it."

8076,Agreed.
8077,"Until we get approval for kids to get vaccinated, with everyone in school sharing air, we‚Äôre still on Mr. Covid‚Äôs wild ride"
8078,Why I can‚Äôt own a gun.
8079,I‚Äôm the same.
8080,"My coworker, an infection prevention nurse, said our health care system is very, very close to also requiring the vaccine for all staff."
8081,Here‚Äôs why: they had an exposure where the nurse potentially exposed a patient to COVID.
8082,"The patient had to quarantine and get tested, and this delayed discharge to a nursing home by several days."
8083,The patient didn‚Äôt actually get COVID but can you imagine the repercussions if they did?
8084,"Lawsuits, refusals to pay medical bills, Dept of Health reviews, etc."
8085,"The truth is that in the U.S. health care is a business, and unvaccinated nurses are a financial risk."
8086,I think we‚Äôll see more hospitals require immunization for their staff soon‚Ä¶
8087,I really hope we‚Äôll be able to get moderna booster if we went Pfizer

8105,And don‚Äôt stop the hand hygiene!
8106,"My non-expert theory: RSV usually continually circulates in populations, and can be bad for kids who don't catch it early (under 2) for the first time."
8107,Everyone is then exposed annually (or more?)
8108,"and gets an asymptomatic case, which keeps up immunity."
8109,"Masks, distancing, and especially virtual school meant they circulation nearly halted last year, and now it's spreading like wildfire because immunity has waned like never before."
8110,Makes sense.
8111,"Refusing to get vaccinated is an intentional health risk, similar to tobacco usage."
8112,That was a helpful tip that I did not realize was there!
8113,Thanks!
8114,Not enough data to support that right now.
8115,"Keep in mind, that there's a fair bit of noise in the data."
8116,"Here's the month-by-month breakdown from that study:

March: Moderna = 91%; Pfizer = 89%
April: Moderna = 91%; Pfizer = 88%
May: Moderna = 93%; Pfizer = 83%
June: Moderna = 62%; Pfizer = 82%
July: Moderna = 76%; Pfizer = 42%

As you can see, Moderna dropped to 62% in June and then popped back up to 76%."
8117,"Obviously that's not the actual efficacy changing, it's just noise in the data."
8118,It's quite possible (even likely) that Pfizer's low July numbers are the same thing.

8160,Now I‚Äôm not absolving them of responsibility - part of what lead to the massive wave there was all the traveling for religious festivals.

8168,Blows my mind that there are those working in the field of health care that choose to reject science meant to protect the health of others.
8169,I mean I think that really depends where you were.
8170,In Philly at my hospital we had well over 100 covids patients last winter.
8171,For most of the late spring early summer we were under 10 and even had zero a few times.
8172,I think we have 13-15 right now
8173,Gotta say I'm actually annoyed at nurses for not getting vaccinated because they had to go to a college-based program with many science electives and then nursing school.
8174,Sorry but for me it doesn't have anything to do with having doctors as a coworker.
8175,If you get a nursing degree and pass your boards you've taken many science classes and you should know how vaccines work.
8176,Many vaccines like hepatitis B and often influenza are mandatory to be able to work in healthcare.

8306,She keeps using her fake vaccine card everywhere
8307,That's only for the unvaccinated though isn't it?
8308,[removed]
8309,Where did I argue that everyone who refused the vaccine is doing it because they are on the right?
8310,Please quote me on that.
8311,You‚Äôre setting up strawman arguments and then declaring victory when you win the argument with yourself.
8312,It's a pretty big dice throw.
8313,Children definitely showed more resistance to the first round of virus.
8314,Delta has definitely changed that.
8315,As to whether children in that region are better behaved?
8316,It's entirely possible.
8317,Generally speaking there's some good arguments to be made that they have a more functional society overall.
8318,"Based on the behaviors of adults in this country, I wouldn't expect children to be exactly conformist about sticking with the rules."
8319,"My personal experience growing up may be different then others, but from what I remember kids did pretty much whatever they pleased as soon as there wasn't someone watching them, and sometimes even then."
8320,How does this match up with your own experiences growing up?
8321,Which is looking at the paperwork.
8322,They‚Äôre not calling where the shot was given.
8323,IMHO sooner than later and not in a good way
8324,Over 80% of cases are vaxxed people.
8325,Worst outbreak yet by far.
8326,They're working as intended fortunately in stopping disease but it's pretty clear a mostly vaccinated population can sustain an epidemic as new variants like COVID emerge.
8327,The chief Epi there has stated 93% vaccination among those over age 15 hasn't brought herd immunity and that it's clear vaccinated people can pretty easily get infected and spread it.
8328,As the 6th most vaccinated country that's pretty awful.
8329,They use several different vaccines there.
8330,He's going to claim himself completely right whenever this is controlled.
8331,The base is beyond repair.
8332,Dumber than I could ever imagine.
8333,"You guys over in the US have had quite intense spread too, so not to sound too insensitive but a fair number of the over 70s who would succumb to covid if they got it, already got it, and are not around to affect the statistics anymore... Not sure how big of an impact that would have on the overall numbers though."
8334,I didn‚Äôt think that people believed that they were too healthy to get sick until I read some obituaries where the deceased person had believed they were too healthy to get sick.
8335,"I'm sorry for your loss.... and if you like your aunt,  I'm also sorry for your future loss."
8336,"Stay strong,  it's a lonely year alright."
8337,Crimes against humanity
8338,Exponential growth and all that.
8339,The vaccine rates aren't different enough to explain the orders of magnitude differences in hospitalization rates.
8340,"If the more vaccinated parts of the country don't have a significant delta surge later, I will be surprised."
8341,Now it is in his political interest to appear to be against it.

8357,Catching and releasing covid positive illegal immigrants is certainly not *helping* the pandemic.
8358,And in a world where *legal* travel is severely restricted due to the pandemic it makes absolutely no sense to ignore the effects of illegal travel.
8359,"Again, if your goal is to increase vaccination rates try and spread accurate information."
8360,Calling people idiots/scum and saying they are worse than legit crazy murderers isn't going to accomplish the goal.
8361,Trying to empathize with them and address the issues that lead to vaccine hesitancy is the correct approach.
8362,"If you're goal instead is to feel morally superior, and trade in your righteous indignation for internet points don't let me stop you."
8363,Just understand that by doing this you are making the problem worse.
8364,"Realize there might be some vaccine hesitant person reading this thread who might be on the fence about getting the vaccine, read your post and get pushed away and insulted by your rhetoric."
8365,"Case growth is exponential, not quadratic."
8366,"Sure you can model the change in growth and try to extrapolate, but you have no idea why reproductive rate is changing."
8367,"In the case of Florida, for instance, it's certainly flattening because they are at their testing capacity."
8368,I think they have done that because vaccines were/are hard to come by in Europe.
8369,Had my second Pfizer dose on Thursday around noontime.

8395,San Francisco is less likely to elect idiots to school board or governor.
8396,"They have mandatory vaccines for staff, masks, and a monitoring program."
8397,87% of population over 12 years old has at least one vaccine dose.

8661,Regardless if your pro vax/no vax/vax hesitant we can all agree staffing is a major issue to address immediately?
8662,Mask compliance among men would jump to 100% if Covid were rebranded as Impotence Disease...
8663,"If they want you to get the vaccine, they shouldn't make the COVID positive dick so big."
8664,The vaccinated dick is a micropenis.
8665,"And the crazy part about that, there's likely more cases than positive tests."
8666,I'm sure they aren't testing everyone who is potentially infected nor contact tracing anymore.
8667,[removed]
8668,[removed]
8669,To me it seems like they misjudged the size of the vaccine hesitant population.
8670,Faucci seemed confident we would reach 'herd immunity' levels of vaccination early on... however the reality is in certain pockets of the country too many people are refusing the vaccine.
8671,I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre taking my comment so personally then.
8672,If you never pretended to be an expert then I wasn‚Äôt talking about you.
8673,Preliminary data is pretty murky on the benefits of boosters at this point.
8674,They are seeing that the presence of the Antibodies start to decline relatively quickly and Tcells after about 4-6 months but as of yet there is not great deal data to show that those declines actually result in more breakthrough or worse outcomes.
8675,"Which is really to say, we can be pretty sure boosters will be needed but we don't know exactly when."
8676,Probably not.
8677,But maybe if they come in for other health problems?
8678,I don't know much about it.
8679,But I understand the sentiment.
8680,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how medical workers can believe this!‚Äù

As a native to the area‚Ä¶ highkey, this tracks."
8681,"It‚Äôs a ‚Äúby faith‚Äù area, not a ‚Äúby science‚Äù area, if you catch my drift."
8682,I think the article is complete BS along with 99 percent of the other garbage anti vaxxers post.
8683,"Okay, I just thought there is some regulatory reason why my hospital and the Swedish Hospital is not offering it."
8684,Might be something related to distribution.
8685,"As your information is more current and probably more accurate than mine, I will bow to the more experienced contributor."
8686,"I was going off the general handbook rules, which aren't as specific as to what a bishop should do in this case."

8693,It is NOT a respiratory disease.
8694,"Covid-19 is a blood-clotting disorder, which often attacks the lungs, but it also can attack other organs."
8695,They don't do either actually.
8696,"Science can't actually prove something is ""good"" since that's a human construct, lol."
8697,They also don't stoke hate and are very much against it.
8698,They got away with it for years by not having to explicitly say it was wrong.
8699,"Instead they just said, ""god doesn't want you to have sex with someone you aren't legally married to"" which is also why they scrambled to try to keep it illegal because it was going to screw up the whole gambit."
8700,"They believe (again this has nothing to do with science, so there is nothing to prove or disprove) that your whole point here is to get married, have kids, go to heaven (some version of it at least) with your spouse, and keep on having babies."
8701,That whole thing falls apart if you are cool with gay marriage and trans anything.
8702,"That's why they aren't all like ""yeah, it's super cool dudes""."
8703,That's religion in a nutshell.
8704,"Even if you give yourself a ton of wiggle room with cute loopholes like ""we have a prophet so rules can change"" you still end up with main tenants that the whole thing is built on that get fucked when the society changes."
8705,It's the natural order of things.
8706,Being angry about it is silly.
8707,"It'll die like all religions do, but be honest about what it is."
8708,It's one of the few religions out there that isn't built on hating.
8709,That‚Äôs fair.
8710,I do know that some of the breakthroughs are two doctors and one nurse.
8711,Granted this is one fifth of the positives.
8712,Still concerning
8713,"Right, but the numbers don't relate to the things that you're saying they relate to."
8714,"There is not a single mention of nurse experience levels, so why are you citing these articles to support a claim about nurse experience levels?"
8715,There was exactly one COVID cluster in Japan the games.
8716,This woman was caught at the airport.
8717,It worked out great.
8718,I never pretended to be an expert.
8719,I don't need to be an expert to see the FDA and CDC are doing nothing while cases hit new records.

8726,Lucky indeed.
8727,We went to a wedding for a couple who had gotten engaged during the lockdowns and had a reasonably normal wedding in June.
8728,It‚Äôs just awful to know what rotten luck we have had to go through with this in the  midst of two surges.
8729,"I just hope it‚Äôll be ok, we postponed last year for everyone‚Äôs health and safety."
8730,It would be so messed up if we did that only for the situation to be worse this year and if god forbid people get covid at our wedding.
8731,[deleted]
8732,"Covid will be there for 100 years, I need to have a test before I fly in another country again."
8733,My cousin was paralyzed after a flu shot.
8734,Guess what?
8735,He still got vaccinated for COVID.
8736,"He understands how rare GBS is and that, especially with his condition, getting COVID would be a death sentence for him."
8737,They refused medical science when it came to the vaccine.
8738,Why should medical science treat them when they're ill?
8739,We all make our choices.
8740,We all make our own bed.
8741,"We can't, and shouldn't, save someone that doesn't want to be saved."
8742,Perhaps they aren't making headlines because they are so few and far between that there's not a story to be had.
8743,Every vaccine will have breakthrough infections.
8744,This is not new at all.
8745,"And I believe at last check the number of people who have died from getting the vaccine is damn near zero, whereas 625,000 Americans alone have died from covid that has been reported, and some estimate it's 50% higher actual numbers of deaths that aren't being reported."
8746,???
8747,I have Mormon relatives and sometimes go to church with them.
8748,Everyone in the congregation of 200+ wears masks and the majority are vaccinated.
8749,This is in a very conservative part of the US as well.
8750,I literally have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
8751,Please stop pulling shit out of your ass.
8752,"No one wants to talk about it, but freedom of religion is absolutely abused by shitty people."
8753,Everything has an agenda these days I feel like - his is keeping us safe and keeping the hospitals from being overwhelmed.
8754,I will say one of his tweets about cases per 100k people comparing us to unvaccinated or extremely limited vaccinated countries was a pretty bad idea - it continues to perpetuate skepticism about the  vaccine.
8755,My hope is this wave peaks in the next couple of weeks and we get this thing into an endemic.
8756,My neighbor thinks their diet protects them since she hasn't gotten the flu ever since she changed her diet years ago.
8757,If your main goal is to not end up dead or with life changing complications J&amp;J has been nearly as effective as the MRNA vaccines.
8758,I'm not disagreeing.
8759,All I'm saying is that I hate that it has come to this.
8760,The ACA certainly charges smokers more for their health insurance policy.
8761,The guy who maintains my lawn equipment chain smokes the self-rolled tobacco and said he paid $150 a month more for his health insurance.
8762,"Car insurance for a smoker costs more, too, as well as house insurance."
8763,Your comment has nothing to do with what I said.
8764,You can be cautious and safe without pretending you‚Äôre an expert.
8765,"Oh, just now starting?"
8766,"Yeah, but I was referring to the behaviors of mormons I've interacted with, not the church policy."
8767,I do understand.
8768,We had ours in June.
8769,We postponed it from June of 2020.
8770,We got extremely lucky the second time around given the low June 2021 numbers.
8771,I‚Äôm so sorry.
8772,Same!
8773,I‚Äôve never gone so long without catching the crud from kids at school.
8774,I did get more headaches though.
8775,I think it was from the constant cleaning products.
8776,I was never told to hate gay people.
8777,"As a matter of fact, I left the church when they told people to vote against gay marriage because they used to say that is was wrong for churches to tell congregations how to vote."
8778,"The reason given for voting against gay marriage was not, ""because gay people should be hated"", it was some nonsense like ""family blah blah blah..."" It's not a religion of hate and is very much against the idea of hate."
8779,"Cult like, weird, with silly beliefs, yes, but not promoters of hate speech."
8780,If this is what it takes...

8782,[removed]
8783,I'd be hitting the muffalettas and po-boys.
8784,"I absolutely agree with the last paragraph, especially if ICU best are full or we run ventilator shortages again."
8785,You‚Äôre over 18 and willingly unvaccinated?
8786,Lowest priority.
8787,(Unvaccinated minors over 12 should still get priority though because they need parental consent and didn‚Äôt choose their dumb ass parents)
8788,Thanks.
8789,It has been a nightmare.
8790,We planned our wedding 2 years ago and have paused our lives.
8791,We don‚Äôt have any options at this point.
8792,I just hope everything will be ok. No one can possibly understand the situation aside from other couples in the same position
8793,"100,000 is the Conservative estimate."
8794,The worst case scenario would involve the United States the US hitting 1 million Covid deaths officially.
8795,"The most likely scenario is 300,000."
8796,[removed]
8797,"Get vaccinated, put your fucking mask on when in public inside places, don't go out if you don't have to."
8798,That's what it takes to flatten the curve.
8799,[removed]
8800,Do you not understand the word immunosuppressed?
8801,If *this* is what brings down the LDS church it will be the most hilarious thing ever.
8802,I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the very idea of medical professionals who don't trust medicine.
8803,"I‚Äôm also a teacher, and it‚Äôs confusing to me how up in arms people get about snow days."
8804,"I live somewhere it doesn‚Äôt snow, and everyone does just fine without extra random days off."
8805,"I get that it‚Äôs fun for kids to go out and play in the snow, but I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs THAT big of a deal."
8806,Can‚Äôt they play after school?
8807,"""As of Thursday, there were 73 confirmed pediatric Covid-19 patients hospitalized in the zone, the highest it's ever seen treated at once."""
8808,North TX only has 73 beds for kids?
8809,73!
8810,?
8811,They also won't mandate people get vaccinated so I'm not sure what your point is.
8812,That's exactly who the CDC and FDA is prioritizing right now.
8813,Idk what it is about Mormons and essential oils / other mlms.
8814,I felt terrible for the bride and groom.
8815,"Scary part is everyone that is positive, except 3 were fully vaccinated."
8816,Pretty wild.
8817,I sincerely wish you the best of luck

8819,"I‚Äôm afraid of head on collisions, so I don‚Äôt drive the wrong way on the freeway."

8821,Depends on the era for missionaries.

8827,I've had one of two surgeries I need.
8828,Sadly the second is going to be delayed.
8829,"I mean, not life threatening, but it still posses me off."
8830,"the apex, or top, of cases before they start to decline again."
8831,Yeah that sounds about right
8832,Outside of some edge cases this has been proven false by nearly every study that has looked at it.
8833,Generally healthy activities such as exercise and good diets have shown strong correlations to lower chance of the worst outcomes if you get COVID-19.
8834,However healthy activities provide no benefit in terms of the chance of developing an infection if exposed or how likely that person is to transmit the disease to others.
8835,Everyone should get vaccinated but let's not start spreading bullshit in the name of encouraging vaccination.
8836,Lol someone's triggered by something that doesn't even exist.
8837,They have to give back any money in rebates if they make too much money.
8838,My boss says Mississippi is the armpit of the United States.
8839,He used to live there.
8840,"Well, no one saw that coming."
8841,The governor should really require a mask mandate for all his citizens.
8842,Doesn't he realize he is literally killing his voting base.
8843,Im having my wedding next month (postponed a full year already and all paid for pre covid).
8844,This is my worst fear despite knowing 95% of attendees are vaccinated and no children are attending.
8845,Our vendors will not let us postpone again and if we cancelled we would be out thousands upon thousands of dollars.
8846,Ugh
8847,I hadn‚Äôt looked at my own state‚Äôs (Washington) data dashboard since the vaccine rollout 8 months ago.
8848,A few things had changed.
8849,"Previously the 65-79 and 80+ age groups had the lion‚Äôs share of deaths cumulatively, but it seems that 50-64 has a higher percentage than before (14%) and hospitalizations seem much more spread out among the age groups, as listed below:

0-19 - 2%
20-34 - 10%
35-49 - 17%
50-64 - 27%
65-79 - 28%
80+ - 16%"
8850,"You can't fix stupid, but Covid might."
8851,"On anti-vax Reddits, they just say these stories are all fake."
8852,My partner works in an ICU and has a Covid patient who is a mother of 4.
8853,One of them has special needs.
8854,She's likely to leave them orphans.
8855,The other day she asked if it was too late to take the vaccine.
8856,I cannot stand the people who are ignoring the shit she goes through every day
8857,"I believe the official name for that logical fallacy is ""Shut Up, That's Why""."
8858,Indoor.

8878,Most of the cases are asymptomatic to mildly flu-like.
8879,No one has been hospitalized or is severely ill.
8880,Vaccines work.

8894,My high school was bizarrely inconsistent with COVID rules.
8895,"While students and teachers had to mask up in the halls, it was perfectly fine for them to take them off in the classrooms where they spent 95% of their time sitting three feet away from each other."
8896,"While different grades had different bell times to keep them from intermingling in the halls, such staggered bells only rang after 11:00, so everyone intermingling at the single 9:45 bell was fine, for some reason."
8897,"And don‚Äôt forget the maskless barbecues for staff and students alike behind the school, because as long as it‚Äôs outside, no guidelines are required whatsoever!"

8902,All they can do is offer modest discounts to the vaccinated through a wellness program.
8903,That's it.

8908,Ya God forbid some of us want increased protection to protect immunosuppressed people around us.

8917,"If you are getting federal help you have exceeded your capacity to care for your own people and without further NPI‚Äôs a military deployment only buys you a week of denial, it‚Äôs like sending in the firefighters while the arsonist is actively throwing Molotov cocktails at the structure."

8997,"We didn't lose on our own, we were hamstrung..."
8998,Can you point to the part that suggests more resistance to immunity than delta.
8999,I tried to read the whole abstract but couldn‚Äôt find a specific part about that.
9000,"This is one of the few news stories where I‚Äôm so glad that I read the comments because it is mostly people saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt get a vaccine, I don‚Äôt want you to treat me‚Äù."
9001,"&gt; we need to live with the ability to travel freely and not have to wear masks

We don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù those things at all."

9003,But the last year has shown us we can adapt to this new normal.
9004,Many of us already have.
9005,"With California mandating that basically everyone in the medical fields and public schools gets vaccinated, I unfortunately have seen many past friends post about how they ""don't want to be an experiment"" and ""we can't trust the government!"""
9006,It's been really sad seeing people I cared about post antivax stuff.
9007,I mostly try to mute them but I really don't feel comfortable talking to them in the future.
9008,I'm very curious how antivax people will navigate the medical/educational fields.
9009,"Will they just succumb to it, or will they have to find a different field, or will they just fight to get an exemption?"
9010,Who knows
9011,Should be across all chronic illness sufferers.
9012,Instagram has only been out 9 years...
9013,"None of my family falls into that category, somehow I got very lucky as they are all leftists."
9014,My dad was scared of the vaccine (got it recently) but only because he was paranoid about having a reaction considering he has significant health issues.
9015,My in-laws however are the *exact* sorts of people I'm talking about.
9016,"I've been with my husband for 15 years and from 2015-2016 we saw his parents (who we lived with temporarily during that time) go from hating Trump during the primaries, to being bootlickers - excusing everything he did."
9017,"My FIL went to John's Hopkins and got a degree in biology, and is actually very intellectual, and a person who reads more often than they browse the internet."
9018,"He means well, but has some really fucked up views do to the fact Fox News is playing 24/7 in their home."
9019,"I lived there and I saw it first hand, they just leave the TV on Fox News all day (even when working/during the day because it will deter break-ins)The brain is malleable; I'm friends with my FIL's college friends and they say he has changed, and I've seen it too - he's now excusing things that he would have found unacceptable  10 years ago."
9020,"This whole conversation reminds me of a bit I saw in a documentary years ago - it was this doctor who was studying serial killers, and so he did brain scans of the serial killers and other random people (including himself) and he saw a distinct pattern."
9021,He saw his own brain scan (not knowing it was his) and identified it as a serial killers....but it was his.
9022,He said he then realized that even though he was predispositioned it never manifested because he had an idyllic upbringing.
9023,"I think that people, as unique as they are, *can be* swayed one way or another - experiences definitely do impact a person."
9024,"So I came here 21 days ago, waiting to get vaccinated."
9025,So I am 12 days out from my last dose.
9026,No need for booster until at least 6 months.

9046,"This pandemic is so closely monitored, surely there is data supporting your position?"

9097,How does he explain the virtually 100% unvaxxed compositions of our nation's ICU?
9098,I'm so perplexed by this idea.
9099,Is this idea that the vaccine is making people who don't take it sick?
9100,Is that his argument?
9101,He should want to take it and save his own life if that's his point.
9102,Will your brother wear a mask and socially distance?
9103,It seems like he acknowledges that the virus is infectious and that people are dying.
9104,I guess that's something?

9121,AAP data (sourced from CDC) shows marginal increases in terms of the total percent of cases among pediatric cases vs. ever before.
9122,"It would be extremely easy to explain this away based on increased adult vaccinations, assuming those vaccinations are effective."
9123,Where are you getting your data that pediatrics are affected more now than they were a year ago?
9124,I would love to have that data so I could share it with family and friends.
9125,Beshear is holding live twice-weekly press conferences again.
9126,"He's giving all that info, Dr Stack is giving all that info, they're having multiple medical personnel on giving all that info, begging for people to get the shot and throwing out all the numbers."
9127,You can hear the despair in everyone's voice.
9128,"They're not convincing anyone new; those of us who've had the shot wanted it, and those who are masking make the choice and know exactly why."
9129,He even made a snide comment over how he hopes people waiting for FDA approval don't just find sooner other excuse.
9130,Great - thank you.
9131,Where I live it was part of the government advice early on and it was never really mentioned again so I just carried on!
9132,Getting Covid isn‚Äôt the end of the world if you‚Äôre vaccinated btw.
9133,It‚Äôs not at all equivalent to an HIV diagnosis or anything like that.
9134,"If you do test positive or are otherwise diagnosed, inform your close contacts and isolate for the period that your local jurisdiction asks you to."
9135,That‚Äôs it.
9136,Move on with your life after that.
9137,the fact that the study is based on information from facebook makes me hesitant
9138,"So, when we get some mutation on mutation action, that's when we could get the super deadly variant no one sees coming?"
9139,"Wouldn't this just be a function of time though, meaning, we WILL get a worse variant at some point IF the virus keeps circulating, which it will because of anti vaxx morons."
9140,Why are they 'forcing' hospitals to do anything?
9141,Hospitals should turn away anyone who isn't vaccinated.
9142,I tutored a lot of nursing students.

9156,"Surprise, that didn't happen."
9157,"Over a year later and we still can't get an appointment, but were hoping to finally get it scheduled this month and now Delta has derailed us again."
9158,"At this point we just have to hope that her condition hasn't worsened because she's obviously an extremely low priority compared to other patients, and assuming that we'd be willing to walk around a Baltimore hospital right now, which we're not."

9316,"In the U.S. we have about 50% of the population vaccinated, with 3 different somewhat effective vaccines, this is an almost perfect environment to create a super variant."
9317,"**Imagine** we get a variant that has the a combination of the epsilon, lambda, and delta mutations which mean it would basically render the vaccines moot, and it had an Ro of 15-18, a viral load 10x that of Delta, and an incubation period of 14-18 days."
9318,"**The imaginary virus** would be spread ridiculously easy, anything short of an N95 mask would be useless."

9324,This is how the death rate can climb to 10-20%**.
9325,"The people who can't be admitted to a hospital because of capacity issues will be stuck at home, and their caregivers will be under high stress, which lowers the effectiveness of the immune system, and constant exposure to the virus, which means the caregivers will also get sick, and most likely also die, because there won't be room for most of the sick, this is how entire families are lost."

9659,"It said since the beginning of the year, so some of that time period is when the vaccine was not widely available"
9660,At this point in time it is probably take more effort to get a fake card rather than going to a place without appointment to get vaccinated

9691,Most welcome

9695,I just don‚Äôt know what to make of all these nurses from all over the country refusing vaccines
9696,TYVM!
9697,Anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers.
9698,"I've wondered whether people with a healthy immune system are more likely to have a bad bout, because their cytokine reaction will be over the top."
9699,That's how it was in 1918; the people who were dying were the young and healthy people.
9700,Not all.
9701,"Taiwan and South Korea, instead being idiotic and pretending masks don't work, ramped up their mask production in early 2020."
9702,I wonder how in hell they managed to create counterfeit versions of cards printed on common card stock with no security features whatsoever?
9703,I will do my best to keep everyone updated.
9704,"And yes, I‚Äôm hoping my vacs can keep up."
9705,We live in a small house (1250 sq ft) and can‚Äôt really distance from one another.
9706,"I'm a cold piece of garbage, but others that risk other people's lives for their own so-called civil liberties are not?"
9707,"And to add on top of that, they are risking people's lives when we have tools to manage this pandemic."
9708,"Regarding what I would say about a loved one that had this option -- if a loved one had the opinion that they felt that their civil liberties were being infringed upon because a private institution was requiring them to wear a mask or get a vaccination, and continue to put other people's lives in danger, including my kids, I would first try to educate them on the benefits, and walk them through several examples and analogies; I would point them to research; I would point them to the billions of vaccinated people; I would ask them to do it for my kids."
9709,"If they still remained ignorant, and believed more in their *make-believe* civil liberty to not wear a mask or get a vaccination when they would otherwise put others at risk, I would disown them."
9710,Enough is enough.
9711,"They had their chance to do the right thing, and they continue to be a drain on society."
9712,"Put COVID aside, if there was a person that was knowingly putting other peoples lives at risk, like playing Russian roulette with people that didn't know they were participating in a game, should people be okay with that?"

9721,Cases are going up in ever state.
9722,"They aren't climbing as quickly in highly vaccinated states, but it's only a matter 9f time."
9723,The vaccine alone isn't enough to keep the spread of delta contained.
9724,$500 more.
9725,It's funny how the Mormon church (slowly but surely) changes their official stance to match modern scientific and social concepts.
9726,Not sure if the leadership genuinely wants a change to more progressive views or if it's just PR to keep the new recruits coming/retaining existing members.

9750,"This is a major issue with major implications, so I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre brushing it off so cavalierly."
9751,Anyone who thinks this is just a political issue must not have been on the internet for the decade before Trump took office or they‚Äôd know this has been building from the same crowd that pushes vaccines causing autism.
9752,"Possibly, but not attending church every week probably makes it easier to skip tithing payments."
9753,I had to supply vaccination records as well as her boosters for stuff before getting into college.
9754,I just don't get why this has to be different.
9755,"Yes, and if you remember in the US and most other countries vaccines were originally available only to elderly and nursing home residents."
9756,"Unless the elderly person had an immediate reaction after being vaccinated, unlikely the vaccination was the cause of death."
9757,Thanks for sharing your experience.
9758,Do you think this might be the breaking point for a lot of people and make them leave the Church?
9759,"I could imagine their argument to be that this announcement is flawed due to the individual fallibility of the leaders, which actually would indicate that they believe themselves to be more devout than leadership."
9760,I don't know where someone would turn if they left over such a disagreement.

9783,"this is a very misleading line

&gt;They also can‚Äôt take your current health or medical history into account."
9784,All health plans must cover treatment for pre-existing conditions from the day coverage starts.
9785,the two should be separate concepts.
9786,"Pre-existing conditions are inherently covered, but like any law, it includes exceptions for new categories and restrictions to be added."
9787,"This is one of those times where the *interpretation* that ""They also can‚Äôt take your current health or medical history into account""

-is wholly inaccurate."
9788,That's layman's terms for ya.
9789,"The nuance of the law that allows exceptions for smokers, by definition has to explain WHY smokers are the exception

9805,"Southeast Asia has many thousands of small farms near jungles, bats, and other wildlife."
9806,"The farms often contain a mix of poultry and swine in close proximity in a hot, humid climate."
9807,Some amount of bush meat is consumed even when there aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwet markets‚Äù.
9808,All these things in combination are a recipe for cross species viral mutation.
9809,There should be no surprise that many people (mostly on the left and outside the conservative zeitgeist) assumed this was a natural evolution rather than a lab leak.
9810,(Not that we yet have proof that this came from a lab even considering this story.)
9811,Wow this was eye opening for me.
9812,Wife and I are supposed to be in the wedding party for a wedding next month.
9813,Most of the brides family is anti-vax.
9814,I‚Äôm immunocompromised from chemo so I just got my 3rd Pfizer dose today.
9815,"My oncologist advised to play it safe and not go, so especially after reading this, it‚Äôs just not worth it."
9816,I don‚Äôt know what my immune system would do and I don‚Äôt want to make such a careless risk like that.
9817,Thanks for your insight and I hope your wife feels better soon (and that you don‚Äôt get any symptoms).
9818,I would love to hear back on if you end up getting symptoms though!
9819,It's both.
9820,"An intelligent person would have that knowledge, because they'd have read about it."
9821,[removed]
9822,"I'm not in it but one of the nurses working on my shift was reading aloud a private healthcare antivacc group saying how to get fired so you get benefits, how that would hurt the stuck up hospital and they'd have to eat the cost of unemployment, and how to apply for the federal emergency rent funds."
9823,"It was all wrapped up by saying that the writer knew not everyone in the group would be okay following through but that hard times demand hard solutions and they refused ""to be thrown in the pitri dish""."
9824,I‚Äôm ex Mormon now and have been for a few years and talking with friends and family that are still Mormon has been interesting.
9825,They‚Äôre all baffled that the church would say this.
9826,I wanna shake them and hope that they‚Äôll wake up to either getting a vaccine or leaving the church.
9827,But they‚Äôll do neither because ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù or some shit.
9828,i had breakthrough delta with a pretty bad cough for a few days.
9829,it was a very very dry cough.
9830,was coughing like every 30 seconds
9831,"I've had several conversations about this with my doctor, and a good friend who's an epidemiology research nurse."
9832,"*IF* we are to think this can ever be over, the vaccine needs to prevent the vaccinated from being infectious... or a great deal less than they are now."
9833,"Otherwise, everyone is going to have COVID all the time, and we'll need regular boosters to prevent getting sick from it."
9834,The vaccine itself is fine but I think they were having problems with manufacturing consistency and supply issues which led to several missed deadlines.
9835,Doesn't help that the two doses are not the same which complicates things more.
9836,Not all of us nurses are idiots.
9837,I'm immunocompromised and just had my booster today.
9838,Very happy to have been able to get it with Delta ramping up and kids going back to school.
9839,But I understand your frustration.
9840,Fuck that lol.
9841,We pay 10k+ a year and they can‚Äôt figure out a simple vaccination measure.
9842,Kick rocks.
9843,Masks are not feasible for a college population.
9844,They might wear them in class.
9845,They‚Äôre not gonna wear one when they go to parties and bars.
9846,Exactly.
9847,"I don't get out of my house except to buy groceries and essentials, and I always do wear my mask, got my first jab and the second will be 21st."
9848,I cannot guarantee everyone will make their part but I am willing to not be the one to be responsible for mutating that shit.
9849,the vaccines have proven to work.
9850,nothing major happened to ppl who have taken them.
9851,"if they can‚Äôt be bothered to get a two second jab just to save lives, then they shouldn‚Äôt be in the damn field."
9852,case closed.
9853,"oh, and if the vaccine is fda approved, then they‚Äôll  just make up another fucking excuse."
9854,my cousin is a nurse.
9855,she decided to play follow the leader with her coworkers and got covid.
9856,then lied to her own father about getting vaccinated.
9857,"If anything, this pandemic and how some people reacted to it has sucked out any and all optimistic outlook I had left and has made me hate people."
9858,"AstraZeneca vaccinees in many countries were offered an mRNA vaccine as their second dose, and it's turning out to be an even better combination than two doses of mRNA."
9859,My brother and I never get sick.
9860,Ever.
9861,Like literally 20 years of no sickness healthy.
9862,He was knocked out on his ass for 10 days and could barely walk up stairs thanks to COVID (thankfully recovered fine).
9863,Viruses don't care.
9864,Right?
9865,I am way more worried about the blood clots Covid can cause than the ones that the vaccine can potentially cause.
9866,"Case in point, a 35 year old VERY healthy friend and her multiple blood clots, a few of which ended up in her lungs."
9867,I dunno how she survived.
9868,"Thankfully, she did."
9869,"Had a horrible recovery, though."
9870,"They never think of long Covid, either!"
9871,"That‚Äôs my biggest worry, seeing so many people I know with long term effects and organ damage."
9872,Hey!
9873,Something I can speak about directly!
9874,Yay (I think)!
9875,"Here is the problem:  Which wins- vaccine/testing mandates, or staffing needs?"
9876,The nurses in the Shenandoah valley (even in the hospitals) are mostly PRN (they got their associate's while also getting their high school degree).
9877,So these are not the most highly trained of the healthcare professionals.
9878,"The ones I know are usually young, married, and their job is just supplemental to their husband's income."
9879,"They usually only work for 10 years, then become a stay-at-home mom."
9880,Because the Shenandoah Valley is still stuck in the 1950's.
9881,So the question is:  which is better- to have no nurses (because there is a perpetual nursing shortage) or have unvaccinated nurses?
9882,"If you live in DC, you say no nurses."
9883,"Because you don't have a severe nursing shortage, and you have choices."
9884,"But if you live in Luray, you say unvaccinated nurses."
9885,"Because at least there is someone there, manning the phone, taking your blood pressure, etc."
9886,Its better than the alternative.
9887,Those of us in the valley are curious how this plays out.
9888,Which wins?
9889,The drive for vaccinations?
9890,Or the need for nurses?
9891,The outcome to this question is still uncertain.
9892,Fun times.
9893,[removed]
9894,Where was this nurse working when she said this?
9895,One thing if she is working in ER where she would only see people who had severe adverse reactions to vaccines.
9896,Another if she worked at vaccination center and for whatever reason a lot of people had adverse reactions.
9897,Doubt the second scenario.
9898,"For the first scenario, people who had no or mild reactions to vaccines would not need to go to the ER."
9899,Only those who had severe reactions would need to go to an ER.

9936,My MIL moved across the country to be near us when we had our baby last year during Covid.
9937,"I thought being around us would help her break away from some of her wilder beliefs, but sadly it didn‚Äôt."
9938,"Over the last year the relationship between my MIL and her daughter (my wife) has worsened to the point that my wife wishes her mom never moved out here, and she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with her mother at all at this point."
9939,"For what it‚Äôs worth, I will not let an unvaccinated family member see my baby again, and we regret that we didn‚Äôt keep my MIL away (though we didn‚Äôt have much of a choice)."
9940,I‚Äôve seen the relationships between several friends and their parents similarly be destroyed over Covid.
9941,"It‚Äôs sad, but if grandparents don‚Äôt love their grandchildren enough to get a vaccine to protect them, then they don‚Äôt deserve to be around them."

9963,[deleted]
9964,Thank you for your take.
9965,I'll admit my negative experiences with nurses is mostly on social media and corroborates your argument.
9966,"There seem to be a few nurses who want to be patted on the back for being a nurse, which seems kind of odd to me."
9967,"So, prior to covid I had little faith in some of them due to what they would post."
9968,"I just don't see how a noticeable, if not significant, amount can slip through the cracks."
9969,"I'd guess that not all nursing programs have the same bar, and passing the NCLEX (86% of people do the first time) may not say much for critical thinking?"
9970,"I really don't know, but for some reason too many nurses (not all, or even the majority, but too many) are anti vax."
9971,Me too.
9972,I do not think I would have gotten it otherwise.
9973,Spain is not setup for people outside the system.
9974,I think there will be a lot of people who will not get vaccinated until it‚Äôs freely available without appointments and lots of paperwork.
9975,I think especially refugees and migrants without papers won‚Äôt get vaccinated for a while.
9976,"Misleading title a little bit, the guy you quoted is not the Astra Zeneca lead scientist."
9977,Their advice would mean that X thousand more people per day aren't quarantining because they only had mild symptoms and didn't feel the need to get a positive test.
9978,"They're just walking around the supermarket for 2 extra weeks, infecting everybody they come across."
9979,"Right, but even with breakthrough cases that doesn‚Äôt always mean hospitalization right?"
9980,Wouldn‚Äôt hospitalizations be much lower in high vaccination areas?
9981,"I feel you though, wish you the best"
9982,Poor mans fight in a rich mans war.
9983,Those who fought didn‚Äôt have slaves.
9984,Slave owners were exempt from service.
9985,kind of implies you get a longer floppier dick with covid.
9986,If the floppiness fades over time it could be a selling point.
9987,I resigned teaching after 25 years of loving it for very political reasons‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a part of me wonders because all school law is written With both explicit and often times the stated implication that the teacher will act to protect the child ‚Äúin loco parentis‚Äù.
9988,I know that the state always just threatens to fire all the teachers and get new ones as if that is an easy task but that might not be so easy right now‚Ä¶ I wonder if it is within the realm of these teachers to do a mass protest and shut down the school system completely in the name of protecting the students from their stupid parents who want them to die?
9989,I don‚Äôt understand the logic of these American politicians acting like it is not happening here except that they want to somehow keep the rich happy?
9990,And why is it necessary for so many of us to die to do so?
9991,So basically fly season for the vaccinated and ICU season for anti vaxxers.
9992,Good to hear at least those that care are not dying.

9994,"Well, last weekend I was accosted for wearing a mask at the market."

10040,Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that m4a is a brand of pseudo universal healthcare that intends to lower the compensation of doctors.
10041,Specifically primary care doctors.
10042,And that will result in further reductions in the supply of primary care doctors.
10043,"It‚Äôs the same time investment to do internal medicine, peds, or family medicine as it is to do dermatology, but Derm Medicare rates are far higher than primary care."
10044,Good luck on your next pandemic when you have to a of specialists but no one to man your hospitals.
10045,Does the US or Florida have at least a contact tracing app?
10046,"The bottleneck in nursing school is at an educational level, not the student level."
10047,There are thousands of nursing students who have finished their prereqs but cannot get accepted because there are only so many nursing instructors and only so many clinical sites.
10048,"Because having a nursing student is a huge burden to hospitals and a major stressor to nurses, when hospitals were at their breaking point last year they stopped accepting students."
10049,"If your nurses are on the brink of quitting from stress, you don't make them take on someone who is constantly asking questions, needs constant supervision, and can't legally do anything that doesn't reflect on your license as their supervisor..and anything they do do is incredibly slow and requires demonstration."
10050,"So there are plenty of people who are trying to get into nursing school, but some schools have am acceptance rate of 30-50 out of 800 to 1000 applicants, because that's how many students they could reliably place in clinicals *before* COVID."
10051,And you can't get a license if you don't get a set number of clinical hours and prove you can perform at a certain safety standard.
10052,"So there are plenty of incentives to become a nurse already, there's just no way to ram people through when to do so would mean you would lose the resource the healthcare system is losing fastest and needs the most: experienced nurses."
10053,My district did this last year (fully in person).
10054,"I'm assuming this year with masks by choice, one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state (even with staff, admin, and teachers), and Delta, they'll continue to do this again, but staff coverage will be non-existent due to ever increasing sub shortage and we'll have to possibly close the building."

10092,The pay structure wasn‚Äôt adjusted up from Medicare rates and Congresswoman Jayapal made it clear that this is a feature as the doctors will have no choice but to accept the bare bones reimbursement of Medicare.
10093,"Medicare is currently structured such that it pays pretty well for procedures, but not so great in the more nuanced primary care consultation."
10094,"Even then Medicare pays far below what a practice needs to operate even accounting for modest efficiency gains via streamlined billing, as was recently found in Washington state where the government had to set reimbursement at 160% of Medicare rates to get enough doctors to sign on to the states single payer program."
10095,"It‚Äôs not because doctors are greedy, primary care doctors really don‚Äôt make a great net hourly wage when all is factored in, but because Medicare rates alone don‚Äôt pay the bills."

10115,Muh freedoms?
10116,"From the article:

Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia and an expert in infectious diseases, told the committee: ‚ÄúThe concept of herd immunity is unachievable because we know the infection will spread in unvaccinated populations and the latest data is suggesting that two doses is probably only 50 per cent protective against infection."
10117,‚ÄúWe need to move away from reporting infections to actually reporting the number of people who are ill.

10521,"If you are able, sit up, sign the AMA papers and leave."
10522,I hate the hipocracy.
10523,If you have modern medicine?
10524,Ok cool.
10525,Let‚Äôs find an island where all of the science denying doctors and patients can go exist together.
10526,Until then?
10527,Stop conveniently believing in it when you‚Äôre on your death bed.
10528,I take my vaccines and I take my preventative medicine.
10529,I listen when I go to the hospital and I respect science.
10530,It‚Äôs not that hard.
10531,It keeps people alive.

10533,"I agree with the sentiment here, but I think you're missing a big point of reference that's even more relevant than the BEA: we have the NOAA amd NWS."
10534,"Think about how sophisticated these entities are: we get notified, in real time, about flash flood warnings, tornado activity, hurricanes... and the related forecasts are (contrary to what people believe) quite accurate up to five days in advance."
10535,"You can easily look up the temperature tomorrow in Fargo, ND or find out how many inches of precipitation Bakersfield, CA got this week in a couple of clicks."
10536,"We should be able to use this as a model for covid: easily accessible historical data, nowcasting at a granular level, reasonably accurate short term forecasts, and maybe some looser insight into local trends."
10537,All the Republican governors need is a lie they know their base will buy....and they know they hate immigrants.
10538,The point you are trying to make is also not supported by the current research.
10539,Delta has quickly overtaken the other variants as the dominant strain due to how infectious it is.
10540,Same argument with PPE.
10541,Totally agree with you on bureaucracy.
10542,The CDC in particular seems to be asleep at the switch
10543,Nah there isn‚Äôt the politcal will.
10544,Better to let the hospitals collapse.
10545,Plus our oligarchs wont allow it.
10546,Don‚Äôt want the slaves getting used to livable conditions.
10547,"Near the top of the GOP nomination for 2024 presidential candidacy, not showing he would win against Biden, assuming Biden seeks reelection."
10548,"I believe his Governor race 2022 polls and favorability in FL dropped per news, but not his national popularity with those not impacted in his state and still interested in calling themselves Republican etc."
10549,"He's basically the GOP mascot for a Governor who fights against all reasonable Covid mitigation so the anti mask, anti vax crowd likes him as long as he keeps saying nonsense like illegal immigrants are causing the surge etc."
10550,They only get upset when he promotes vaccines or meets with the President during a crisis (meeting with Biden fire building collapse).
10551,That's what I've gathered from the news.
10552,"I actually wanted to become a doctor but the cost of schooling for my undergrad was so much, I had to work full time to cover rent and basic expenses...which led to me struggling in classes and not being able to make it to med school."
10553,"There are folks who would love to be trained as nurses and doctors, but there‚Äôs a lot of gate keeping with education in terms of cost and that‚Äôs not just tuition alone."
10554,"At the risk of aiding in a crime, why are people paying for fake cards?"
10555,My (very real) card was obviously printed on the printer at the health department on whatever card stock they had.
10556,"(My actual card is green, probably because the health department bought all the card stock they could, regardless of color.)"
10557,"Because there's no point in thinking about it, not when the solution to averting that is getting more people vaccinated."
10558,We're afraid of mutations and variants but we spent the last several months leaving those chances up to anti-vaxxers.
10559,Have you tried trt?
10560,"Seems what I had found was based on Life Insurance, not health insurance."
10561,"Regarding no sticks:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve raised insurance rates for everyone by 75%, but if you give us proof of vaccination we will give you a rebate equal to 75% of your old rate.‚Äù

To anti-vaxxers that looks like a stick."
10562,To the vaccinated it looks like a carrot.
10563,[removed]
10564,And a lot of these same parents are those underpaid essential workers that everyone claimed to love so much LAST year.
10565,So missing even one paycheck can wreck things for them.
10566,Old people vote.
10567,That‚Äôs right.
10568,That means delta will not survive in the long term.
10569,Which is my whole point.
10570,She's better than the psychopath sitting in office now.
10571,I started following her on FB to see what she is about.
10572,"Not in 100% agreement with her (literally, just one thing - but she is sane!"
10573,"), but she is a lot better than what we have."
10574,What a flawed premise.
10575,We know people tend to become more conservative as they get older.
10576,This happens across almost all Western democracies.
10577,"Conservatism is inherently more bigoted in the United States (seeking to uphold a structure that by design fucks over minorities), and that‚Äôs irrespective of who you vote for."
10578,"It‚Äôs a feature of the ideology, not the party."
10579,"The party just exploits and amplified the angry, hateful part of these people."
10580,It doesn‚Äôt create it.

10583,What articles?
10584,Kids under 12 can't be vaccinated.
10585,Unless I'm unaware of recent changes.
10586,"Maybe they should refine the advice to ""listen to medical experts."""
10587,I don't think most nurses qualify as experts.
10588,At what point do my rights count.
10589,"These people are so freaking concerned about their rights, they think nothing of those around them."
10590,"It's not about rights, they are selfish."
10591,"Talking with several anti-vaxxers that have gotten religious exemptions, they are not religious in any way."
10592,It's just an excuse.
10593,"End the religious exemption, if someone needs an exemption."
10594,It should be a high bar with major expenses required.
10595,Not just a form to sign.
10596,Had you been in certain parts of Canada nobody would blink about getting a vaccine already.
10597,"Certain provinces check birth year only, so anybody born 2009 qualifies, even if December 31"
10598,"Your post history clearly shows you don't really care about the truth, just what you think the truth is."
10599,Go away.
10600,I have a 10 and a 12.

What, like a durian fruit?"
10609,Well... yes?
10610,"Thats exactly what i was saying, that even with good fitness people should be wary of covid."
10611,"Dunno where you saw the disagreement there, my comment wasn't contrary to your argument at all, quite the opposite."
10612,It was already broken and being held together by duct-tape.
10613,That's not going to fix the cracks in the foundation that's been left there by all the previous owners.
10614,In the emergency department we are affected whether someone is hospitalized or not.
10615,"People still come in, often with multiple family members, feeling like shit and worried about covid‚Äîespecially if they‚Äôre unvaccinated."
10616,It amazing how quickly the unvaccinated lose their bravado when they get the sniffles!
10617,"Obesity is prevalent everywhere in the US, but Florida has a relatively low rate compared to the rest of the country."
10618,Florida ranks 44th.
10619,This is mentioned in a couple articles posed today - the salon article on how this ends I think is one.
10620,"A doctor who was vaccinated and got it basically said this is how it tracked for him, but the reading was more like ‚Äúoh it felt like a bad flu for a couple days and then I was better‚Äù"
10621,These people are like firemen who practice arson in their spare time.
10622,There are a lot of people who don't want to be vaccinated.
10623,"Additionally, the risk of variants may cause travel restrictions and restrictions on large gatherings to be kept around."
10624,I have a 10 years old and I am very anxious about her.
10625,Only one in my family not vaccinated yet.
10626,"People May not understand that smaller
Hospitals don‚Äôt have the same capabilities as larger."
10627,They may not have a blood bank and this can not transfuse plasma (a blood product) to suck covid patients.
10628,They may not have respiratory therapy for pulmonary hygiene therapy.
10629,"They may not have the patients normal medications, and although family can bring in home medications, they may not have IV forms of these meds for the Intubated patients."
10630,These hospitals are designed to stabilize and ship.
10631,They don‚Äôt have the beds to prevent pressure ulcers from developing.
10632,"They don‚Äôt have enough pumps to run sedation, pressors, and antibiotics simultaneously."
10633,Most small hospitals don‚Äôt have in house dialysis.
10634,This isn‚Äôt a criticism of these hospitals.
10635,They have a specific purpose and are being asked to do far too much now.
10636,You're not wrong.
10637,"As an actual person admitting kids to the hospital this past year, the *majority* were not there because they were sick with COVID."
10638,"But, I do live in a state where we test every patient for COVID on admission and then weekly after that, so maybe my experience is different from that of pediatricians practicing in states with less testing, idk."
10639,"I've taken care of dozens of kids with COVID, but can count on two hands the number of times I've needed to give Decadron/remdesivir, which we do for all kids with moderate to severe COVID."
10640,And they've all done just fine.
10641,"I can genuinely say the flu in 2019-2020 was MUCH worse than COVID has been, in terms of kids that got really sick with it."
10642,"With that being said, kids should absolutely be running and not walking to get their vaccines as soon as they can, and I'm 100% for masks in schools."
10643,But it's more of a public health thing than a direct danger to kids thing.
10644,Zip codes are a little misleading here because even the Post Office doesn't really use the 5 digit zip.
10645,"They've gone on to use a 5+4 digit zip that's printed on the bottom of every envelope (or used to be, they might not even do that anymore but letter sorting is still by the 5+4)."
10646,The 5+4 is probably closer to what the UK uses just not everyone really knows them because there was no real push for adoption.
10647,It is not that though.
10648,"Even with high vaccination rates, there is enough unvaccinated people to put pressure in the Healthcare system."
10649,One thing to not is that hospitals were getting close to capacity in Seattle area due to non covid issues before the recent increase in covid cases.
10650,So even a small uptick from unvaccinated covid cases will be enough to go over the limit.
10651,"I'm assuming money somewhere, but i'm not sure where to start to dig into that."
10652,"How does this make sense, surely new mexico or something had a bed?"
10653,"I am not USAmerican, so I didn't know about this."
10654,It's just weird to me that tiny Fiji has an app but the USA doesn't...
10655,Then I hope those parents support mask mandates in schools since a Georgia district just closed all their schools again after so many cases that happened the first week of school
10656,Source?
10657,Because the couple people I know who had breakthrough infections basically had colds.
10658,What you described is what people I know in good health who got Covid pre vaccination dealt with.
10659,Isn‚Äôt there a rule that if you‚Äôre 11 and turning 12 within the next 6 months you can get it??
10660,I thought I heard that in the news but I live in Canada now and flip back and forth between US and Canadian news channels.
10661,I  made a jingle!
10662,"If... you doont waanna ... get a infectioooon, get a Mask!"
10663,"Mask Your face, mask your Nose, Mask yourself!"
10664,"Iffff yoooouuu dont waaaaaaannaaaa diiieeee, Get a Vaccine!"
10665,Save lives!
10666,"...

Word!"
10667,This was the exact line of reasoning Lucky used in King of the Hill to avoid hospitals.
10668,That kind of thinking was supposed to be a joke that nobody in real life would ever actually believe

10670,This might be the only thing about Covid that gets our all knowing and protecting patriarchy's attention.

Just like our political system."
10673,You did the right thing.
10674,Enough is enough.
10675,Bulgaria has to be among the top.
10676,All vaccines are available with widespread availability and yet we are at 18% vaccinated.
10677,That argument doesn't really make sense.
10678,"The quicker it burns through a population, the more chances there are for another variant to emerge."
10679,Especially with something that replicates as quickly as delta.
10680,How hard is it understand that there's only 5 factors that affect rates?
10681,"I had a friend who used to always draw dicks like that in highschool, and we always assumed he had a hell of a curve in his penis."
10682,I‚Äôll never forget when he threw mankind off hell in a cell‚Ä¶ guess we are stuck in hell in a cell now.
10683,√Ünima by TOOL was a prophecy
10684,You are very welcome.
10685,I forgot to mention that our cases about 94% Delta at this point.
10686,Where do you think the overflow is gonna go?
10687,It is breaking.
10688,Thanks!
10689,I just looked up an article about Hawaii that said 91% of covid patients in their hospitals are unvaccinated.
10690,That's right in line with our numbers in Ontario.
10691,"So the vaccines are working very well, at least."
10692,"I believe in science, have been vaccinated since it was possible, and follow protocols."
10693,"That being said, is there a symptom that people are NOT trying to tie to Covid?"
10694,"Honestly, this strains belief and makes it even harder to convince the anti-everything crowd."
10695,Trouble breathing... covid.
10696,Can't concentrate... covid.
10697,Dick doesn't work... covid.
10698,"As someone currently fighting off Covid (fully vaxxed breakthrough case, I'll be fine), I have no sense of smell or taste."
10699,My dinner last night was a plate of steamed broccoli.
10700,All I could taste was the salt on it.
10701,Maybe I'll lose some weight out of this shitty deal?
10702,I'm wondering that too.
10703,I know next to nothing about how all that works but can Biden not just close everything down regardless of what the governors are doing?
10704,Because uh.
10705,This is real bad.
10706,Is the graph implying that black dicks are bigger?
10707,Or that black people are getting it more because they're not getting vaccinated?
10708,The quicker it burns through a population the quicker people develop natural immunity to the  variant.
10709,That combined with vaccination rates will stall its ability to spread effectively within a certain population(s).
10710,Yeah‚Ä¶ but how would they prove a patient is not vaccinated?
10711,In an emergency situation nonetheless when the patient may be unresponsive.
10712,I can‚Äôt believe people still need their ‚Äúbelief‚Äù in masks solidified.

10715,For some things yes (like cancer treatment or plastic surgery) but not for other things (think emergency care where time is of the essence).
10716,"For example, a rich person who gets in a car wreck in Denver that requires a trauma activation isn't going to be airlifted to, say Calgary."
10717,Someone suffering from a stroke or heart attack will likely not make it to their preferred hospital in (insert country name here) if they are wanting to go abroad to their doctor.
10718,"And if something goes wrong overseas (infection, mistakes, sub-par facilities resulting in poorer care, etc."
10719,"), then they are in for a world of hurt."
10720,"Sure, the ultra rich who are worth 8 digits + will be far more likely to have (or be able to establish) connections to the finest doctors and facilities, but the relatively well off but not quite as wealthy who could go abroad (think software engineers making 150k + a year, a lawyer, etc.)"
10721,may not have the same recourse.
10722,Good luck finding a doctor state side that can fix a botched surgery done by someone abroad or an insurance company that would pay for very expensive corrective procedure(s).
10723,"Yes, I know there are accredited hospitals abroad that do have modern facilities and staff who are qualified, but even then things can go wrong."
10724,**(TLDR) My point is** that there are certain emergency situations where this is not practical.
10725,"Medical care abroad actually has some risks, and not always because of the facilities and staff (some of which really is top knotch), but because many doctors and insurance companies don't want to touch corrective surgeries with a 10' pole if something went wrong, it will be risky, especially for people who are making good money (working professionals in high paying careers) but not filthy stinking rich (like celebrity / CEO of large multinational levels rich) who would be able to get things fixed easier and without destroying whatever nest egg they have because insurance won't cover the 6-7 figure amount out of pocket to correct it."
10726,It's one thing if a billionaire
10727,The fact that the website is called boing boing XD
10728,I heard smell training might bring it back
10729,More people outside.
10730,It's the same pattern we saw last year
10731,"The weirdest part to me is there has to be some kind of database record that I got the first shot, because they've called me about getting the second one."
10732,I shouldn't be having any kind of issue getting the second scheduled.
10733,I kinda get that but I still don't get his view.
10734,"But I don't get why he can be so anti guardian lol, its one of the better options especially when it comes to actual information."
10735,What's so bad about the guardian?
10736,...and if you overlay the outbreak map onto the electoral map from the last election...

10749,Maybe NJ will be better because of masks.
10750,"In PA things are basically the same minus the mandate in Philly, which people don't seem to be following."
10751,We're only 3.5 percent more vacced than Florida.

10753,"They all look the same, just time shifted."
10754,MA has so far given one dose of vax to ~5 million people.
10755,There are ~7 million people in MA.

10758,"According to data from the state, only 2-3% of the Covid cases are from tourists due to the fact that anyone from the mainland is required to either quarantine for 10 days, provide proof of vaccination, or provide a negative Covid test within 72 hours of flight."
10759,"I've been told the same by a couple of pharmacies, that I need to show my vax card for the first shot to get the second."
10760,Another user pointed out I could just go back after my first shot again.
10761,My comment stands.
10762,There‚Äôs been plenty of research on these vaccines.
10763,If you‚Äôre anti-vaccine at this point it‚Äôs because you‚Äôve decided to be.
10764,I dunno about that.
10765,People really struggle with identifying cause and effect.
10766,"That particular one might be a bit on the ridiculous side, but that kind of thinking is quite common."
10767,"For example, there‚Äôs that stat about how like 98% of shark attacks happen in shallow water or whatever."
10768,"And if you think about it it‚Äôs like no shit, because shallow water is where all the people are."
10769,But you tell that stat to someone and it scares them.
10770,Now pharmacist will check all I'd.
10771,Of people.
10772,And delay vaccine delivery.
10773,"Come on, eating in your open outdoor balcony or garden is safer."
10774,I was *very* upset when I lost my sense of taste when I caught covid last month.
10775,"Luckily it started coming back after \~10 days, but I was really concerned about losing it for good."
10776,Winter is when all the snowbirds arrive.
10777,Florida is fucked.
10778,"He doesn't have the national authority to do that, but he does have the authority to restrict interstate travel as that is the domain of the Federal government."

10781,modern reporting.
10782,"why leave out the most important part of the story, lol."
10783,&gt;	I agree with you both but what is stopping it from getting just as bad as Florida?
10784,Vaccines.
10785,I had to take my five year old to advanced ambulatory a few days ago (she slammed a door on her fingers and I was worried she‚Äôd broken a joint) and when I walked in the aide at the door looked at my mask less face with a terribly tired expression until I said ‚ÄúI only have cloth masks and I know you want me to put on a hospital grade one‚Äù and quickly masked up (along with the five year old).
10786,I‚Äôve seen what polio does to the body (used to live in India).
10787,I have no desire to see my child die while gasping for breath in a hospital.
10788,The fact that adults and parents think that this is ‚Äúacceptable losses‚Äù because of their own selfish desires floors me.
10789,I got the vax the day it came out for my age group.
10790,I did the same for the second dose.
10791,I‚Äôm not going to breathe easy until all my kids can be vaccinated and one of the few mercies is that my five year old is my youngest and will be turning six soon - I‚Äôm hoping the next age group that can be vaxxed is the 6-11 range.
10792,*crosses fingers*
10793,"I feel dumb, it honestly never occured to me to do that."
10794,"I'll take my humble pie with extra cool whip, thanks."
10795,Where are you getting that 600k number from for Seattle?
10796,Seattle's population of 725k
10797,I know people that have clotting disorders and other complications but chose to get the vaccine because they felt getting Covid unvaccinated would be a worse outcome.
10798,Yes and those of us with kids not old enough to be vaccinated and also not old enough to mask (I have a 21 month old and a 3 month old).
10799,We‚Äôre back to lockdown status at our house because of all the selfish people who refuse to vaccinate AND refuse to mask.

10803,"The 10yo is older looking, 20 pounds heavier, and two inches taller than his older brother."
10804,"One takes after me, the other takes after my husband."
10805,Should the unvaccinated be denied admission to hospitals for Covid?
10806,Would that be motivating enough for people to get vaccinated?
10807,Darwin strikes again!
10808,Probably.
10809,Many if not most universal systems do tax bad behavior.
10810,"Long Covid is also associated with people who have pre-existing conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes...etc."
10811,All of which are also associated with ED.
10812,I'm not sure this is really a revelation.
10813,Of course!
10814,I prepared myself for it to be different but it ended up being fine.

10818,[removed]
10819,This is tricky.
10820,Lots of people immediately after surgery end up in the ICU or on ICU watch right after surgery.
10821,So all those elective surgeries require a bed to be ready and waiting in the ICU.

*‚Äú(in ancient Greek theatre) a play in which the protagonist, usually a person of importance and outstanding personal qualities, falls to disaster through the combination of a personal failing and circumstances with which he or she cannot deal.‚Äù*

Batson defines tragedy as: ""A narrative form of literature in which a tragic protagonist, who possesses greatness of spirit, commits himself to an undertaking of great magnitude within a given situation and, as a result, comes to spiritual suffering usually followed by perception and death and possibly by 'redemption.'"
10892,"""

Batson's definition has the following elements:
a narrative form of literature

- protagonist who possess greatness of spirit [Batson does not mean that the protagonist is necessarily admirable for all he or she does, but rather that the hero is elevated in human potential.]"
10893,"- protagonist commits himself or herself to an undertaking of great magnitude

- protagonist comes to spiritual suffering {Keep in mind that ""spiritual"" need not be ""holy"" here.]"

10900,If someone is delusional enough to not have been vaccinated yet I think even this would still not motivate them.
10901,But you would end up with a lot of kids made homeless because their parents went bankrupt after surviving covid.
10902,I would prefer to treat them but publicly state that the policy is vaccinated people ill with covid get treated first and you will get taken off life support and left to die if you are unvaccinated and a vaccinated person can be saved with the oxygen supply you are using.

10943,The problem is the more that vaccinated people are exposed to the virus the more likely they are to get sick.

11114,In a sense it is a heinous act of selfishness to decline a vaccine while the majority of the global south is wholly unprepared and would gladly take the american vaccines.
11115,It's also not a good argument for 'freedom' b/c the most likely payer for that medical bill will not be the unvaccinated person but it'll be the US tax payer (i.e.
11116,the rest of us) when it goes to collection like all those other bills that never get paid.
11117,Speaks volumes for a country that has shifted all the blame and success solely on the individuals and you have people that actually have bought that myth.
11118,The country invests so much in tech that they are just begging for opportunities like this to study and use it.
11119,Agreed.
11120,"However, smokers, the obese, and even rock climbers have to pay higher health insurance premiums and the non-vaccinated should, too."
11121,The goodest.
11122,"To some extent, there is a question of how here immunity is defined."
11123,"If we define it as ‚Äúthe virus can no longer spread among humans‚Äù, of course that is impossible."
11124,"It might have been possible if it was contained in early 2020, but there is no reasonable path to that anymore."
11125,"If we define it as ‚Äúthe population has enough of an immunity that the virus spreads, but has much reduced severities, comparable to either the flu or the common cold‚Äù, that‚Äôs certainly possible - either through vaccination or through more infections."
11126,"But yes, even if we kept every human locked up for 90 days and vaccinated everyone (both impossible), there are many animal reservoirs: bats and cats and seagulls and ferrets and minks‚Ä¶ 

Humans have successfully eradicated one virus using vaccines - smallpox."
11127,"We have spent billions for decades fighting polio, and while it‚Äôs much more contained than it used to be, it would easily become a big issue again as soon as we stop the vaccination program."
11128,And COVID has plenty of characteristics that make it far less likely to be eradicated.
11129,"Obesity does have a unique problem in which every single completely unrelated health issue is automatically blamed on the obesity, and treatment denied or delayed as a result."
11130,"An actual conversation I once had with a doctor:

&gt;Me (at the time, very obese): Hey doc, I think I broke my ankle."
11131,"&gt;  
&gt;Doctor (now former, I fired them):  It's because you're too fat."
11132,"&gt;  
&gt;Me:  I *know* and I was trying to run to help lose weight *at your suggestion* but I tripped and my ankle has hurt too much to walk ever since."
11133,"&gt;  
&gt;Former Doc  Well, just lose some weight and I'm sure it'll get better."
11134,"Obviously, that kind of advice is totally useless, so I found another doctor, got better advice, and lost 100 lbs."
11135,"And I don't attempt to run any more because diet, not exercise, controls your weight."
11136,Running is probably the least efficient way to lose weight.
11137,These days strict calorie control and a couple of daily walks are all I really need.
11138,"67% initiated in chester, 67% initiated in Bucks, 67% in Montco."

11142,For sure.
11143,"This argument could easily logically be applied to obese people, people who do something that people consider outside social norms etc."
11144,These are the kind of situations insurance companies think up on a ***constant basis*** in order to deny coverage.

11181,"If we did than what about the smokers,the drinkers, the obese?"
11182,We could also say their choices directly effected their needing medical care.
11183,I might agree with those who choose not to be vaccinated agree that they won‚Äôt be given priority for a vent if their aren‚Äôt enough because hospitals are having to decide who gets o e and who doesn‚Äôt.
11184,NZ is an outlier.
11185,"Australia, Singapore, UK, Japan, Vietnam even Cubas system works."
11186,That won‚Äôt happen either
11187,"It can be long term (the Governor of Virginia [lost his sense of smell and taste for at least 7 months](https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1390679928337833984)), but if your taste is coming back that's probably a good sign."
11188,"Yea exactly, not to mention that it would be very hard for insurance companies to accurately determine who isn‚Äôt vaccinated bc they just don‚Äôt want to be and who isn‚Äôt vaccinated bc they legitimately can‚Äôt be bc of other medical conditions and we don‚Äôt want to set a precedent where disabled people have to jum√≥ through even more hoops than they already do just to get basic medical care."
11189,"Ah yes, because ""get vaccinated or die"" will really coax the unvaccinated to get the vaccine and definitely wont stoke their conspiracy theories."

11194,Any data on catching covid a second time if you‚Äôve caught it AFTER being fully vaccinated (Pfizer)
11195,That's a fringe position that is completely out of step with the overwhelming scientific consensus.
11196,"As just one piece of evidence to support that statement, [here's a 2015 meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26376864/) which, after noting that more than 100 genetic loci with alleles that impact BMI have already been discovered, found several more of them."
11197,"In other words, being obese doesn't 100% prove that someone is a lazy slob."
11198,"But being unvaccinated does, by definition, 100% prove that they don't trust evidence, and therefore, in my opinion, should be deprioritized for evidence-based treatments."

11205,"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report

11228,"Right now, everyone has an opinion on why, but we don't really know."
11229,We need psychologists and sociologists and maybe even some anthropologists... to give us some insight into why people aren't getting vaxxed.

11396,I only know that there's still the risk of transmission but I want to know more about that (having some numbers).
11397,Obviously I'm excluding people who are medically ineligible to be vaccinated.
11398,Stop being obtuse.
11399,"Anti-vaxxers who get a vaccine preventable disease people are unique because they definitionally meet two criteria: their problem is 100% due to their own bad choices, and they, by definition, do not believe in medical science."
11400,"So yeah, I'm pretty down with deprioritizing those people for evidence-based care."
11401,We don't have unlimited medical resources.

11403,Globally?
11404,No way it will end by 2023.
11405,In the US?
11406,Maybe by mid 2022 if people get their stuff together.
11407,"There is a prevalent ‚ÄúLive Free ~~and~~ or Die‚Äù attitude, but I think it‚Äôs mitigated by being the least, or one of the least, religious states in the country."
11408,The last time there was an anti-mask rally only a couple of people showed up.
11409,We‚Äôre about 60% fully vaccinated last I saw.
11410,Easily in the top 10 for vaccinated states and pretty close to the other New England states.
11411,Masking is about 30-40% based on what I‚Äôm seeing in stores.
11412,Not sure where that is in relation to the others.
11413,"All in all we have room for improvement, but are certainly in better shape than the majority of states."
11414,You sir are absolutely correct about that.
11415,"We think we can conquer it, and we most certainly cannot."
11416,"We don't have anywhere to go from here but management, mitigation, while learning."

11427,This!
11428,"It‚Äôs so hard because there‚Äôs so many different conditions that can cause vaccine intolerance and a lot of them are hard to diagnose so you can‚Äôt necessarily go off of an official diagnosis, and even if you could, people aren‚Äôt just carrying their medical records around."
11429,Doctors are usually the ones giving their patients advice based on their known reaction to vaccines but then if you require a doctors note that excludes people without good access to healthcare or who can‚Äôt afford a primary care appointment just for a slip of paper and even then it‚Äôs not like most people would remember to carry that slip of paper around with them everywhere they went in case they ended up in the ER.
11430,"I have an autoimmune disease and the vaccine knocked me on my ass for 3 months, it caused a pretty bad flare up, but I knew that that would probably happen going into it and me and my doctor still thought it was worth it, but another person with a different doctor and different life circumstances with the same disease might come to a different conclusion so it‚Äôs complicated."
11431,Our medical system already makes it hard for chronically ill people to access emergency services so I could see this making it even harder :(
11432,I worked on a covid unit and I have personally witnessed vaccine regret or asking to get it while currently admitted with covid.
11433,It's one of the many reasons I walked out.

11439,Unless they have anaphylaxis to vaccines there is absolutely no excuse to not get it.
11440,Its NOT a live virus.
11441,Out of everyone I know only 1 person has anaphylaxis and hes a med student relying on everyone to do their part so he can graduate and save lives.
11442,"In the city where I live, a huge number of the unvaccinated are older people who are black and brown."
11443,Many of them have a distrust for doctors and the government.
11444,Many of them don‚Äôt have the means to get to a vaccination site.
11445,"You guys seem to want to paint a picture of Trump supporting Republicans not getting the vaccine, and that‚Äôs just not what the data is showing in my city."
11446,Denying medical care to the unvaccinated with disproportionately affect POC.
11447,"Deductibles and rates aren't what were talking about here, though."
11448,"This post is saying that the unvaccinated should pay their entire hospital bills, and that is an entirely different issue."
11449,"Also, determining fault in car accidents can be a very persnickety animal."
11450,"For example, I was once in a pretty gnarly car accident on the freeway."
11451,There was a sudden backup around a curve.
11452,"I was able to make a safe and complete stop, but the dipshit behind me locked his brakes, swerved out of control and hit me hard enough to push my bumper into my trunk, my trunk into my backseat, my car into the car in front of me and that car into the car in front of it."
11453,"Under typical liability/fault rules, I would have been considered at fault for hitting the guy in front of me, except that when talking to the cops after the accident, the guy in front of me explicitly said that I had come to a complete stop."
11454,"If he hadn't told the cop that information, in no uncertain terms, or if he hadn't looked on his rear view mirror at the right time, I would have been determined to be partially at fault/liable for damages and could have been ticketed."
11455,"I would honestly hate to experiencing that level of hair splitting by my health insurance if I got cancer or accidentally injured myself through tripping over some random thing like a dumbass, both of which I've done."

11472,"If yes, then yes"
11473,I don‚Äôt understand anti-vax nurses‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt they go to school and get a degree where they studied medical science?
11474,?
11475,The reason I feel comfortable in my politics beliefs is utter rejection of a political idea actually gets voted to the top and invokes discussion.
11476,"Suuuuure, because having an auto-immune disorder that excludes you from getting vaccinated is a ""choice,"" and ""personal belief,"" and something you can ""control,"" not legitimate medical advice from a professional."
11477,"People like that *definitely* should be forced to sign waivers and be discriminated against, because their pesky ""beliefs"" put everyone ELSE at risk!"
11478,How *DARE* they be so selfish; their dangerous actions mean they shouldn't be offered a hospital bed in an emergency!
11479,"/s

Shame on all of you."
11480,"Yeah, the anti-vaxxers who eschew this are assholes, but there are *plenty* of people who would fucking *love* to get vaccinated, but their medical situations make such a thing impossible."

11486,That'll show 'em.
11487,Obviously I'm excluding people who are medically ineligible to vaccinated.
11488,"But vaccines are unique in the sense that 1) they are, unambiguously, 100% a choice, unlike obesity, addiction, and other comparable conditions, and 2) they also 100% prove that the unvaxxed person does not believe in medical science."
11489,"So I'm pretty ok with deprioritizing anti-vaxxers, honestly."
11490,"I don't think it's a slippery slope, because I don't see any other issue that meets both criteria."
11491,I think it's to make parents pull their kids from school.
11492,It will a) dumb down some of the future generation by limiting their education and b) push others to enrol their kids into private schools.
11493,I can guarantee you peivate school owners and governora are connected which means cash kickbacks for the governors.

11525,Great times.
11526,It‚Äôs fine if you want to be the principle police but do you have any legitimate solution to the problem that is non-COVID patients being turned away when a significant number of COVID patients made the deliberate decision not to get vaccinated?
11527,No one is intentionally seeking out COVID patients that couldn‚Äôt afford the time to get the shot but we do know several million refuse.
11528,"Therefore, like others said, from a triage standpoint, it makes sense to separate normal patients from COVID patients."
11529,"Wow sorry to hear that, hopefully she feels better soon (and that you don‚Äôt get any symptoms hopefully)."
11530,I doubt that 96-99% is really accurate considering the CDC uses YTD numbers going back to January 1st.
11531,I would say almost all severe cases between January to April were among unvaccinated people since almost everyone was unvaccinated.
11532,"Those numbers skew the statistics and don‚Äôt paint an accurate picture of what‚Äôs going on now, that is that truly a lot of vaccinated people are getting really sick."

11576,Depends how effective the vaccine is and how long the protection lasts.
11577,There are some pretty concerning studies out of Israel and Minnesota showing that Pfizer drops &lt;50% in preventing cases after ~6 months.
11578,The good news is it's still extremely effective against serious outcome.
11579,"I think waning immunity + the incredible contagiousness of delta means we'll never get rid of it, the end game now is to vaccinate as many as possible to prevent the large majority of hospitalizations and death."

11581,"Their selfish choice puts everyone else in danger, this is the difference big enough to warrant no care."
11582,"Offering them care exposes everyone else in that hospital to covid, and in most cases very very vulnerable patients are in there."

11696,He has passed the 12 week mark and I'm worried of the efficacy if he leaves getting the second jab much longer.
11697,I don't want to be pushy about it.
11698,"I tried that a few weeks back, but it ended up with a small argument."
11699,"I think he's been coming around to the idea of getting the second jab, but seeing as it's passed 12 weeks, will he be fine to get the 2nd one?"
11700,"Here in UK we've been told to get the vaccine between 8-12 weeks, so that's why I'm  concerned."

11721,&gt;why are you able to catch and die from something you are supposed to be vaccinated against?
11722,"Because the virus continues to mutate and change, as viruses like to do."
11723,"It's true that the vaccines are not as helpful against the Delta variant as they were against earlier variants of the virus, but they are still quite helpful."
11724,"Unvaccinated people still have a much higher risk both of getting infected, and also of getting more severely ill."
11725,"The more people remain unvaccinated, the more people will get infected faster -- and every additional infected person means an additional opportunity for a mutation like Delta to appear."
11726,Delta is significantly more infectious than earlier forms of this coronavirus.
11727,"It's a more advanced, more dangerous version of the virus than what was circulating at the time the vaccines were developed."
11728,"The vaccines were tailored to three version of the virus that was circulating at the time, so it's most protective against those earlier versions."
11729,This is why the vaccines don't protect us quite as well against Delta as they did against earlier variants.
11730,"But as I said: the vaccine still protects people, it just is somewhat less protective than before."
11731,"The longer we allow the virus to circulate unchecked by having half the population unvaccinated, the faster it will mutate and create even more dangerous versions of itself."
11732,Every new mutation could make the vaccines less and less effective.
11733,It's literally a race of the virus mutating vs. people getting vaccinated.
11734,"The 71.5% the person above quoted refers to the entire population (including kids who are ineligible), the equivalent figure for the States is only 50% fully vaccinated."

11766,"I want to find a credible source that claims we are 300,000 nurses understaffed right now due to burnout and covid"
11767,The ICU beds are the problem.
11768,"Once the beds are allocated, they can't just unplug people until they recover or die."
11769,And covid patients can take up space for a long time.
11770,actually the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics came out and lobbied the FDA to literally rush Emergency Use of the vaccines recently.
11771,"There's growing concern that because Delta is so contagious and many school districts are ignoring masking advice, that huge swaths of kids will get infected, with many suffering long covid symptoms, or even long-term respiratory issues, and of course death."
11772,At a certain point it becomes a numbers game: the chances of rare side effects from these vaccines are vastly outnumbered by the odds of being hospitalized by the virus itself.
11773,This is like saying that studying for an exam doesn't work after you failed an exam you refused to study for.

11828,The technology being used to make these vaccines ‚Äúso quickly‚Äù had been proposed in the 1970s and has been in development since the late 1980s.

11832,The us military has two healthcare plans.
11833,One is completely free.
11834,The other has a 20% cost share until the cap of $1000 per family is reached at which point no other in network costs exist.
11835,Utilization of the free care is 2.2x that of the very modest copay model.
11836,Slight payments moderate usage and that‚Äôs the reason most healthcare systems in the world have some sort of fee at the point of service.

11968,"People equate it to STDs too, like dude are you walking around cumming on people to spread STDs?"

12172,"With 50% vaccinated and if we go with the estimated 50% reduction in infection, that would be a 533/1000000 risk each day for the unvaccinated (because then the vaccinated would have a 267/1000000 to make the overall risk correct)."
12173,"Now, I have no way to know how many of unvaccinated are wearing masks, there are massive differences between states, there is undertesting, the 50% estimate is not necessarily right, so this is a very rough guess."

12415,Japan is 36% of the population fully vaccinated and 48% with one shot.
12416,Many people believe that they are under reporting the actual number of deaths.
12417,They don't test people post mortem so some cases go unreported.
12418,And their actual testing rate is very low.

12423,TN is a gimme state.
12424,&gt;Why would this not happen?
12425,Because we have high vaccination rates.
12426,Implying that the NE is just waiting for a beast of a surge is not taking the overall (positive) impact of vaccination into consideration.
12427,"Yes, there will be individual instances of breakthrough cases (moving forward and especially during this current surge) but when we look at the course of a pandemic, it's not about measuring the impact of a virus' course because your cousin got covid even while fully vaccinated, we need to look at patterns in absolute numbers."
12428,"Vaccinated people may still be able to spread delta just as much as those who are unvaccinated, but their odds of getting infected *in the first* place are still significantly lower, as well as the duration of which they are infected is *much* shorter...thus vaccination still has a massive impact on total public health outcomes."
12429,"I live in NYC and we don't actually need to look at ""nuance"" to just know that we are going through a 'hump' rather than a scary surge (like Florida and Texas) because we have high vaccination rates."
12430,Therefore the impact of delta (while still not ideal) is still far less severe and is and not overwhelming to our healthcare systems.
12431,"Believe me, I was here throughout the entire ordeal and I know what horrific pre-vaccine surges looks like, and this aint it."
12432,"The Rt in [NY](https://covidestim.org/us/NY) is not below 1 *yet*, but it's quickly headed there in the next two weeks, which means that what we're seeing in North Eastern places like NY right now is basically the 'worst' of it as far as Delta is concerned (it's essentially endemic for us.)"
12433,"That doesn't mean we won't still have issues moving forward for years with covid, hot spots will always be prevalent and flu season will mesh with it... but unless another variant rears it's head and KO's delta, then the country as a whole is also on the verge of having this become endemic."
12434,"Places like Florida and Missouri's Rt is falling below 1 as of this week, which means they're going to be out of this mess by September or even the end of August."
12435,That will get needles in arms fast.

12442,"(Honestly, my gut says it would be particularly good for poor POC to do anything and everything...they're building a tent outside a hospital in San Antonio and using a parking garage in Mississippi."

12444,To even get a bed?
12445,"I mean I'm sure they're doing their best there but...)  

There seem to be several ways to proceed with encouraging vaccination / implementation of NPIs:

1) Do nothing different than today (full disclosure - I honestly believe the US will end up doing this so all of this is a bit of a null discussion)

I do think that there is a strong data averaging problem with some of these surveys which is going to make it very hard to have any universal answer."
12446,"I do believe your argument that in Chicago (and a lot of metros), access is likely the #1 issue."
12447,I think that this can likely be solved with money and sensitive community engagement.
12448,"Hopefully, local governments are aware of that and are working on that."
12449,This seems like a challenging but solvable one.
12450,"I do think that in large parts of the country, particularly rurally, access isn't as much of an issue and it is political / ideological (I get why you wouldn't want to believe that and I wouldn't either if I hadn't been told point blank multiple times)."
12451,"At least from a rural perspective, we have hospitals, clinics, in my hometown the hospital would send someone to come give you a shot at your house if you needed it and our vax levels are still low."
12452,"There are just no incentives for them to get shots and a lot of disincentives (e.g., socially with group identity)."
12453,I don't think you can fix this without involving money and even then I don't know that this works.
12454,"So honestly, most of us who engage here are frustrated because there seems to be a lack of any reasonable path forward."
12455,"I mean think about your most deeply held identify, now imagine being perceived to be completely turning your back on that and everyone in your community with the same identity."
12456,It would be hard.
12457,"Overwhelming the hospital system seems to be helping boost rates (which may either be because it was never an access issue or because it's changed the incentives to be more important to do, not sure) I really hope that's not the best answer because it's leading to a lot of needless suffering."
12458,2) Local mandates - This seems like the best way to enforce because they could be uniquely tailored to the situation.
12459,I think cities like Chicago could do really interesting and creative things here with the right funding.
12460,Won't work in a lot of states because of state laws restricting mask and vaccine mandates.
12461,"3) State mandates - This would be tougher because it's broader, but would allow coverage over more rural populations, so for states with smaller rural populations, this could be a path to push vaccinations."
12462,Likely that Illinois could also do good this way.
12463,"Not feasible in most of the South

4) Federal mandates - Only potential for limited application and enforcement, e.g., in the military."
12464,A military vaccination mandate would likely do a lot of good for the South because of the number of military bases and would be in line with previous rulings.
12465,This is likely the most feasible path forward for the federal government.
12466,"5) Private company mandates - For some reason, we seem to have differed here, so this is likely where any mandates will be broadly implemented."
12467,I think that there are a couple of forms this could take

12470,&gt;Israel has been offering a coronavirus booster to people over 60 who have already been vaccinated.
12471,"&gt;No U.S. decision has been made because cases here so far still indicate that people remain highly protected from COVID-19, including the delta variant, after receiving the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna regimen or the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine."
12472,&gt;But U.S. health officials made clear Sunday they are preparing for the possibility that the time for boosters may come sooner than later.
12473,"&gt;‚ÄúThere is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,‚Äù Collins said."
12474,‚ÄúAnd delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with.
12475,"The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward‚Äù with others, such as older Americans."
12476,"&gt;He said because the delta variant only started hitting the U.S. hard in July, the ‚Äúnext couple of weeks‚Äù of case data will help the U.S. make a decision."
12477,"&gt;Moderna President Stephen Hoge said seeing some ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections emerge among the vaccinated within six months has been surprising, even if most symptoms so far have not been life-threatening."
12478,"‚ÄúI think that suggests we are going to need booster vaccines to get through the winter,‚Äù he said."
12479,"&gt;Last week, the Food and Drug Administration said p eople with weakened immune systemscan get an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to better protect them as the delta variant continues to surge."
12480,"&gt;‚ÄúIf it turns out as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,‚Äù said Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser."
12481,"&gt;While the U.S. currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day ‚Äî a 700% increase from the beginning of July ‚Äî that number could jump in the next couple weeks to 200,000, a level not seen since among the pandemic‚Äôs worst days in January and February, Collins said."
12482,&gt;Both he and Fauci stressed that the best way to stem the virus is for the unvaccinated to get their shots.
12483,"&gt;Currently, about 60% of the U.S. population has gotten at least one dose and nearly 51% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n. Areas with low vaccination rates have been particularly hit hard with infections, such as Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi."

12581,Right there with you.
12582,Here‚Äôs some background for y‚Äôall.
12583,Harris County is the third largest county in the United States.
12584,"This hospital (along with Ben Taub Hospital) provides health care for the indigent, a county population size that is only surpassed by LA and Cook in Chicago."
12585,"They accept Medicaid and Medicare, so the disabled as well as the poor go to these hospitals."
12586,"This is where you get your imaging done, see specialists, get cancer treatments, transplants, and heart procedures along with emergency services."
12587,"Almost all of the physicians are residents at local medical schools, and local medical students (there are four) do their clinicals here."
12588,This hospital system did great during last summer‚Äôs huge Covid wave after Gov.
12589,Abbott ‚Äúreopened‚Äù the state prematurely.
12590,The fact that the system is in collapse now is good evidence that mask mandates and lockdown measures help‚Äîcompare this system to Chicago or LA.
12591,It is time to mandate vaccines or tax the unvaccinated.
12592,People should not die because selfish idiots won‚Äôt do their patriotic duty and get jabbed.
12593,Enough of this conspiracy nonsense.
12594,You actually probably only need a booster about every 30 years.
12595,[deleted]
12596,"Many nurses in general are antivax, roughly 50/50."
12597,"But the military only employs BSNs, not ASN‚Äôs , so there‚Äôs a higher education level there, and the military has been amazingly good at getting the word out about the vaccines being safe and effective given the high rate of uptake in such a young population."
12598,"There‚Äôs surely some hesitation, but the DoD is in a much better spot than the civilian populations that surround them."
12599,"Very low vaccination rate and Delta variant, which is extremely contagious."
12600,It's hard to understand why reporters don't just throw in a link to the CDC.
12601,"Like this one with the graph:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html

Sure, not every reader is going to appreciate what that page says but enough will."
12602,It might interest you to know that in January a 70+ Floridian was about **seven times** as likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 as a 30-39 year old.
12603,Whereas now it's been reduced down to **only twice** as likely.

12613,I've been looking for this data and it's hard to find.
12614,Bring in the fridge trucks.
12615,They should be required to pay for any Covid testing.
12616,So if they don't want to get vaccinated they have to get those tests on a regular basis.
12617,"Of the Patient, Health care provider, Insurance triangle?"
12618,"I know patient personally and health care side from my wife, a nurse during the whole 30 years so far."

12622,I shall avoid doing that when you are high.
12623,"As a huge proponent for vaccines, I have to add that many people got vaccinated, and when the CDC lifted the mask mandate in May, took no more precautions, and many people were eager to ‚Äúget back to normal‚Äù."
12624,"No blame, just stating facts."
12625,"This was a big mistake, as we had not yet really seen the impacts of the Delta variant in the US in May, and we were not aware that with the new variant, the vaccinated could still transmit the virus."
12626,"Vaccination is an important tool against moderate-to-severe disease, but it was not expected to provide sterilizing immunity."
12627,"We should still encourage vaccination, but continue to remind that it‚Äôs one tool of many, and that this pandemic isn‚Äôt over yet."
12628,Yes

12630,"Vaccines were developed to battle the first variant, not the Delta."
12631,Still they protect more than no vaccine.

12643,These of course are incidences where hospitalization was required.
12644,There are also anecdotal reports of vaccinated people stating their symptoms were significantly worse than a common cold.
12645,"Note that I am not comparing covid to the flu; rather, I am addressing u/mountain_mustache‚Äôs comment that covid is ‚Äúa mild cold if you are vaccinated‚Äù."

12655,&gt; Some of these mutations render antibodies elicited against earlier virus strains less effective.
12656,This allows the variants to partially escape the immune response produced after vaccination or prior infection.
12657,"Some ... less effective ... partially ...  they somewhat reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines, don't make them moot."
12658,Do you think we're currently at a similar case right now with covid booster shots?
12659,"The two doses right now seem good enough, but a booster certainly couldn't hurt."
12660,"However, they're extremely reluctant to even allow people to get one."
12661,I had two doses of the Moderna several months back.
12662,"Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely don't want to take a dose from someone who is still trying to get their initial vaccination."
12663,But my state is right now throwing out thousands of doses.
12664,"Again, I don't want to take a vaccine from someone who still needs their initial dose."
12665,But there are doses literally being thrown in the trash.
12666,"Earlier in the year, the county kept a wait list of those who weren't in the most critical groups, but who could be called in if there were extra doses available at the end of the day."
12667,"So if you were say, 30 and healthy, but 65+ were being prioritized, you could get a dose if they had extra left over."
12668,We absolutely should be doing this for booster shots.
12669,"We don't absolutely know if they're 100% necessary, but they certainly don't hurt."
12670,The CDC should be encouraging counties to offer extra doses to those wanting a booster.
12671,"But instead, they're playing the same paternalistic BS they did at the start of the pandemic."
12672,"They don't want people to interpret ""you can get a booster"" with ""you need a booster."""
12673,They're also afraid of people interpreting this as the vaccine not being effective.
12674,"So instead, we throw away thousands of doses that could at least be doing some minor good as booster shots."
12675,Should this not be in r/wtf
12676,Good.
12677,"I‚Äôm not a teacher, but I‚Äôve known a few, and they aren‚Äôt well treated here in the first place."

12681,Stupidly
12682,Are there countries where the age cutoff is lower that someone could legally get a vaccine at by just travelling there?
12683,Obviously not all vaccines are approved in the home country so doing that may be all for nought too.

12685,"A question,

12702,[removed]
12703,Social media for many is one of the biggest problems.
12704,People have really learned how to take advantage of the algorithms.
12705,They get people to click on funny memes that many times start out playful and then slowly it gets worse and worse where they don't realize what they are looking at and it's some bogus news misinformation of which there is a ton of all over the internet with a first glance names that sound like they could be reputable.
12706,"And they get surrounded by this community, mixed with memes and jokes and misinformation they get stuck in a loop."
12707,I know people who start to get stuck in out and have been glad I have been able to stop them and point them in the right direction.
12708,Again starts with one meme and turns into some bogus news article.
12709,Luckily I have been able to convince some that one is not true at all and they avoid it and don't click on it further and learn to research and think for themselves.
12710,"Have definitely seen some to far gone, of course can't argue with them too much and it can be really hard to get some people off social media when there are still lockdown and precautions everywhere."
12711,No idea what the solution is or when they will come out of it.
12712,"So much worse right now coming out of a crazy pandemic, lockdowns/precautions, and election where news has been the dominating form of entertainment for some."
12713,"And Italy in 2020 had no vaccines, very few masks, even less actual PPE and barely any knowledge how to treat Covid."
12714,All things considered they handled matters incredibly weil.
12715,This catastrophe was entirely avoidable.
12716,"I was surrounded by maskless, infected people at work and didn‚Äôt get it."
12717,I don‚Äôt know how!
12718,"Oh I see what you mean now, I assumed you meant professionals."
12719,So then true r0 is impossible to calculate at all due to previous infection and vaccinations.
12720,Which is counter to what you claimed when you stated vaccinated r is no where near 7.

We pay insurance so that we are all covered for the unintended consequences of our actions."
12744,"This pandemic is different from obesity, low uptake of vaccination means overloaded hospitals and needing to triage patients."
12745,"It's not just grannies with covid that are dying at the moment, anyone that needs an ICU for a traffic accident is dying because of all the covid patients taking all the resources."
12746,"Not getting vaccinated is like choosing to drink and drive, you are risking other people's lives not just your own."

12846,*
12847,Form a private Facebook group with like minded parents to counter the antimask/antivax ones.
12848,Send e-mails and call School Board members.
12849,"Get parents you know that support proper safety efforts, or even spouses of Educators, to make it clear they will run for office against the antivax/antimask School Board members."
12850,"I live in a very conservative area, and when the online optnout form for masks was posted, only 10% of students parents opted them out."
12851,These idiots are in the minority.
12852,Don't let them believe otherwise.
12853,Honestly not that I saw but I guess someone probably did at some point.
12854,"precisely , which  is all the more reason to not blow this out of proportion and scare so many good folks over something so banal , an upvote from me , but hey downvote all you like my fully vaccinated friend ."
12855,"i will not take back my opinion , cheers"

12860,[deleted]
12861,That‚Äôs the plan.
12862,Not going back it in public unless I have to and being masked when I do (fully vaxed).
12863,There‚Äôs enough anecdotal stories combined with hard data that suggest breakthroughs are pretty common.
12864,The UK‚Äôs react 13 (last report) showed that long Covid risk was reduced significantly or not very much my vaccinaion because of the size of their confidence interval.
12865,"The bad thing is the science and knowledge is about a couple months behind what‚Äôs happening today‚Ä¶ no fault to them, because the science is coming out at breakneck speed."
12866,It‚Äôs just difficult for us to make real-time decisions on the risks
12867,No.
12868,Just here to visit my grandma
12869,It's like saying that we should not give a type 2 diabetic due to diet the insulin.
12870,"They choose to eat the way they do, so we should just deny them health care."
12871,"It doesn't matter if someone is or is not vaccinated, you give them medical treatment."
12872,Do I agree with people not choosing to get vaccinated?
12873,No I don't.
12874,The unvaccinated stopped being my ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù when they decided that they didn‚Äôt care about helping others.
12875,"I am not one of those who laugh at those dying, but those who are unvaccinated and getting sick sure as hell aren‚Äôt getting any sympathy from me either if they decided to continue putting their lives and others at risk."
12876,"Vaccinated people aren‚Äôt faking their good intentions, but after over a year of dealing with not only stubbornness but also an outright refusal to listen to facts and science, all we are left thinking is ‚ÄúI fucking told you so.‚Äù I wish everyone who can would get vaccinated."
12877,"If you don‚Äôt, you absolutely know the risks by this point - there‚Äôs no feigning ignorance."
12878,"I don‚Äôt have sympathy for drunk drivers either because, again, they knew the risks."
12879,"It‚Äôs one thing to put your own life at risk, it‚Äôs another to continue sacrificing other people‚Äôs lives as well."
12880,"It does, but we‚Äôve been using cases as a leading indicator of disease burden so there‚Äôs some utility there."
12881,Perhaps the thinking should be to define precisely at what threshold cases/capita (or something like it) matter.
12882,Obviously this doesn‚Äôt apply for places with insufficient vaccine uptake.
12883,[removed]
12884,[removed]
12885,"Well, now that Covid has a negative effect on cocks I'm sure we will have it cured quite quickly."
12886,"The key is the ""non-essential"" designation."
12887,You don't have a fundamental right to go to festivals or drink in bars and these businesses do not have to serve you if they don't want to.
12888,Smokers already pay.
12889,This new should arouse the interest of anti-Vax men
12890,That is nuts.
12891,They don't have to with flu.
12892,"When hospitals are full and there aren't beds available for other people with other problems it doesn't really matter what the demographics are, does it?"
12893,The residents of many of these states also gutted their own rural hospitals with unreimbursed care by electing politicians who blocked Medicaid expansion under the ACA.
12894,This is a decade worth of chickens coming home to roost.
12895,COVID was rocket fuel being sprayed on the obesity epidemic dumpster fire.
12896,Does anyone here have experience of recently travelling to the US from the UK as a US citizen with their British husband/wife and child?
12897,We‚Äôve been told to bring our marriage and birth certificates.
12898,Any other tips would be very much appreciated?
12899,"We‚Äôre visiting family in California and I‚Äôm a bit worried that we might have problems getting into restaurants, Disney etc with AstraZeneca vaccine passport."
12900,I can care less if this study is real.
12901,Anything to keep this population from breeding is a good sign.
12902,This is literally what my work is doing except the unvaccinated are paying the same as always and the rest of us get 50 dollars off.
12903,A bribe not a punishment.
12904,The concern level is what it has always been: a mild cold if you are vaccinated.
12905,"Be as afraid as you want to be, and keep on eroding confidence in the vaccine."
12906,I'm sure that will be a net gain for our country.üëç
12907,Yes.
12908,BTW they do.
12909,Smokers pay more for health and life insurance.
12910,Same thing for obesity.
12911,"Ok but, smokers have to pay their cancer bills because they choose to smoke and harm others with second hand smoke."
12912,Alcoholics also have to pay for their own bills.
12913,The obese will have to pay for their own bills.
12914,It's making me sick.
12915,My grandparents live in Blountsville.
12916,Thank God they're vaccinated but I worry constantly that one of them will fall ill and won't have a hospital available.
12917,"Probably hoping to get it shot down by the state Supreme Court, so then he can cater to his base while leaving others to pick up the pieces"
12918,And the deep state would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids.
12919,You tried to assert that a vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect you.
12920,"If one has refused to be protected from death and hospitalization as the vaccine confers, in a triage situation as the vaccine-refusers have created, no moral argument will save those many who have had and will have to be passed over for being on a ventilator to save their lives."
12921,You are perpetuating that happening into the future with disingenuous and specious arguments.
12922,"If you willingly are unvaccinated, you should not be allowed to have medical care if you catch covid."
12923,That's it.
12924,"For some positive news, after looking like they may have been entering another wave, cases in India have been declining again, with the seven day average being at 36k cases today (about 3 cases per 100k for India)."
12925,"So while Delta does spread very fast  like wildfire, it also does it's damage very quickly and it appears the anti bodies that delta gives must be quite potent as India is not that well vaccinated yet cases are declining there."
12926,We really need a vaccine for kids omg.
12927,I have one kid under 12 and it‚Äôs stressful.
12928,Ah okay.
12929,I was hopeful.
12930,Though anything is better then what Abbott is doing.
12931,Or rather not doing.
12932,"Nah, because then what about obese people, smokers, etc."
12933,Should they also pay because they did that to themselves?
12934,Could you elaborate?
12935,I read that having had covid + vaccine was the best defense as far as antibodies.
12936,I took Pfizer back in March and I am just waiting to get sick now.
12937,I have heard multiple times that being vaxxed and sick is fucking still awful!
12938,Just not go to the hospital bad and I get that's a win.
12939,I'm just getting ready mentally I guess and I'm curious about peoples experience
12940,"Yes, just like everybody else... but with extra fees"
12941,Thank you for this breath of fresh air of a comment.
12942,Hospitals usually have paynent plans for all income levels.
12943,No reason for others that pay premiums to have theirs rise for a personal choice.
12944,Decisions have consequences.
12945,Florida is a large state and things depend a lot on where you are.
12946,"I live in a county where we are back to masks indoors most places, but my girlfriend lives 30 minutes north in a county where they do nothing at all."
12947,Unvaccinated should be treated as the vaccinated except they should be responsible for üíØ% of their hospitalization costs.
12948,It's not like obesity or smoking where it's a long commitment.

12973,Even people who aren't anti-vaxxers on the covid positive subreddits are parroting this false information.
12974,"Everybody needs to clean up their act right NOW and tell everybody the correct information, because I don't care if you personally want social distancing forever, people want to live their fucking lives."

12976,And that‚Äôs just with the variants we have right now.
12977,Is my pessimism correct in saying that we‚Äôll probably have more variants by then?

13098,Delta changed that.
13099,I agree.
13100,It's hard to believe things like wearing masks or whatever has turned into this raging political debate that people somehow think has anything to do with taking their rights away but here we are.
13101,There's actually a few comments on this post that I think moderators deleted where people were being sarcastic and shitty about me sharing this article as if it was stupid that I was concerned about the possibility of it affecting children more than before.
13102,"I realize it's too early to have strong evidence that this variant is worse for children, but any indicators that point to that being the case are worth paying attention to IMO."

13136,70% less chance of spread by vaccinated compared to unvaccinated.

13146,Insurance companies should hike their rates through the roof since they are more likely to require more resources if they fall ill. You can‚Äôt deny help to someone that needs it but they need to be paying more than I am since they are the ones at higher risk
13147,"As much as I want to say absolutely to this idea, I have to say it‚Äôs not a good idea."
13148,This would open the gate to a myriad of other ways politicians/insurance companies could drop coverage on other illnesses.
13149,I feel like we need to treat these people like potty training toddlers.
13150,We need some kind of positive reinforcement.
13151,Maybe a tax break or something?
13152,I don‚Äôt know.
13153,You literally say it's a big improvement but it's overly romanticized in the same sentence.
13154,Maybe liberals just want obvious big improvements?
13155,The can is already open.
13156,"- smokers pay more
- drug users go to the back of the transplant queue
- foreign nationals in the US needing transplants are denied 

You will be paying a higher premium into the future."
13157,It‚Äôs inevitable.
13158,Insurance companies will be forced to create new insurance groups vax / no vax - how can you justify a premium increase due to Covid when the customer has done the right thing?
13159,"Honestly they should take it another direction just separate the two groups... Vaxxed to the left door please, not vaxxed to the right door."
13160,The freedoms for unvaccinated people are closing in.. rightly so..
13161,"If you choose to drink or smoke, should you be denied medical treatment for the resulting health outcomes?"
13162,What if you are overweight?
13163,This is where these conversations lead *to the joy* of republicans.
13164,"If you‚Äôre not vaccinated, you should face increased incentives to become vaccinated and disincentives to **not** be vaccinated."
13165,But health care?
13166,We cannot use medical care as punishment.
13167,Their cost for insurance is another matter.
13168,**Everyone deserves to be treated by a doctor if they have a medical issue.
13169,Period.
13170,**
13171,"It would be useful to do it because Sputnik V is the only vaccine some people in other countries have access to, and they can't travel to the EU."
13172,"I'm not claiming this particular vaccine is safe enough and should be automatically approved by the EU authorities, though."
13173,I think we need Covid hospitals to be a big permanent thing as long as this is around.
13174,Then the long haulers can get care.
13175,it will be filled with anti vaxxers as they are the majority of those ending up there.
13176,"I‚Äôm probably just being dumb,.. but I dont see anything from Turkey on NextStrain."
13177,And then delta entered the chat.
13178,This might work for the original strain but delta is showing us things that the original didn't.
13179,"I suspect it's more related to viral load and the fact that childhood immunizations are priming an immune system to fight so when they got hit with the original strain, their immune system responded better and faster but now is ultimately succumbing the viral load that delta is producing."
13180,Clearly there's a whole lot more that we have to learn about this virus.
13181,[deleted]
13182,Never underestimate how stupid people can be.
13183,I'm learning this more and more every day.
13184,"Well, it or the Crimean War."

13186,In this case DeSantis would also make mandatory evacuations illegal in the state
13187,"Ok, now factor in 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3-4 years of residency, and 60 hour work weeks."
13188,"And compare that to the opportunity cost of a lost decade of your 20‚Äôs dedicated to learning, where they could instead do any other speciality in medicine and make 2x."
13189,"Which is why year over year primary care residencies don‚Äôt fill with residents as med students are instead going into far more lucrative specialities, and M4A drives down primary care salaries, which will make the shortage worse."
13190,"Because ""The findings were published online [...] and have not been peer-reviewed""?"
13191,[deleted]
13192,The Fraternity strain.
13193,Elephant in the room: the folks who aren‚Äôt vaccinated skew poor.
13194,Good luck ever collecting that money.
13195,Haha have they met people?
13196,Why would cross-border travel matter at all?
13197,The sick people are already inside the country.
13198,Bringing in a few more won‚Äôt matter.
13199,Mandates to access more places should be number one.
13200,I don‚Äôt see how shutting down everything for everyone would come before simply barring the unvaccinated from going into places.
13201,Plenty of evidence shows that having covid while vaccinated can be significantly worse than having a cold.
13202,"Furthermore, most people are not going to be forced to quarantine (with consequent loss of work) when they have a cold."
13203,"Because of this, people should definitely consider how catching covid might affect them, and take appropriate steps (according to their needs) to mitigate that risk."
13204,"In contrast, there is no evidence that confidence in the vaccine is eroded by telling people they should consider how a breakthrough infection might affect them, even if it doesn't put them in the hospital."
13205,"Likewise, there's no evidence that urging people to rationally assess their own risks will lead to some sort of loss for the country."
13206,"Finally, although I can't prove it, anecdotal evidence suggests that adding a thumbs up to a poorly reasoned, deflective response does nothing to win your case."
13207,But they are fun to look at.
13208,"&gt;if we shut things down, the same people who are in the hospital right now are just going to ignore all the rules."
13209,"If we shut down restaurants, bars, gyms, etc like we did last time, they wouldn't really have the choice."

13226,"Many of the country‚Äôs recent infections have occurred among vaccinated people, but they‚Äôve been overwhelmingly mild."
13227,"So even as new cases multiplied, Iceland‚Äôs rates of covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths have remained low."
13228,"Of the 1,300 people currently infected, just 2 percent are in the hospital."

- contracting covid"
13240,"If you understood science, then you'd know that observations will change as data quantity gets better."
13241,They're supposed to.
13242,That's the point.
13243,"If you bothered to understand how political messaging intersects with science, the ""confusion"" around what to do about COVID wouldn't exist in your mind."
13244,Everyone but you knows that you can still contract and spread the virus even if vaccinated.
13245,The vaccines were never advertised as a magic shield.
13246,That's not how they work -- ***they're supposed to keep you from getting seriously ill***.
13247,"See, good Internet trolls address salient points made in previous posts."
13248,I've asked you several questions which you've ignored to continue pretending to be uninformed.
13249,"But great Internet trolls pick better things to ""ask"" better questions about."
13250,Definitely good to know.
13251,The article I shared seemed to indicate this variant was affecting children more but it's probably too early to tell on widespread basis.
13252,Or Vax v nonvax?
13253,"Yeah, this is exactly the thought process that should come to mind."
13254,Everyone can and should get vaccinated.
13255,"But there are so many other behaviors also that could fall down this slope and end up with us back in ""you had a preexisting condition / behavior so you are now screwed"" land that we worked so so hard for so long to get out of."
13256,What were you eating that led to diabetes?

13261,No.
13262,"This outbreak has given us a birds eye view of how selfish,unempathetic and lacking in logic and intelligence half of the US people are."

13290,Last I checked the excess death so far due to COVID is about 950k.
13291,It means more of the kind of scenarios we saw in those videos from Wuhan last year where people drop dead outside of hospitals because no one can treat them.
13292,That's the worst case anyway.
13293,Think even Delta will eventually slow down.
13294,"It‚Äôs the possibility of another vaccine-evading variant that should worry the worlds governments and, hopefully, enable more cooperation in this field."
13295,"&gt; It's a personal choice because all healthcare is a personal choice

When it affects others, it shouldn't be."
13296,These people are literally killing others--both by eating up hospital capacity and by spreading a deadly disease--with their selfishness and arrogance.
13297,"If the government has the right to force us all to stay home and not see our own families over the holidays (also fundamental rights), they should be able to either mandate the vaccine or ration care so that the rest of us don't have to suffer again."
13298,"That is true, but you **are** knowingly putting yourself and others at risk by not getting vaccinated, wearing masks, and washing hands."
13299,And there have been a few cases of people knowingly spreading the disease.
13300,"There was a case of a man getting on a plane, and after it landed, he got off the plane, turned around and said, ""Ha!"
13301,I have covid!
13302,"Now you all do too!"""
13303,I believe he was arrested right there.
13304,They've been predicting a total collapse since March 2020.
13305,Somehow it didn't happen.
13306,And a sudden surge of patients has nothing to do with the system.
13307,The idiots are the problem.
13308,Many countries experienced a similar surge.
13309,"Italy, France etc."
13310,"But none of them ""collapsed""."
13311,And ours is not going to collapse either.
13312,"If you want to criticize the system, fine, fair enough."
13313,But it has nothing to do with the surge of patients due to pandemic.
13314,"True; pre-April it was probably the lack of delta variant, now (when every other country is seeing an uptick in deaths) their good fortune is probably thanks to vaccines."
13315,You can‚Äôt just do nothing.
13316,"I don‚Äôt hate them, I just have   zero regard for someone who will put others in danger."
13317,All forms of pressure should be applied.
13318,We asked the children to clean their rooms and they won‚Äôt.
13319,The room must still be cleaned.
13320,That‚Äôs what the article says as well
13321,Would be curious to know if/when your taste/smell comes back since you‚Äôre vaccinated.
13322,"I don't want to downplay your concerns, but I think it's also important to remember that these things can happen to people with or without the presence of covid, and not everything (or even most things) are going to circle back to it."
13323,"If covid didn't exist and you were telling me these things, I would probably say that you should get a stress test done / monitor your mental health."
13324,Your symptoms almost word for word mirror a time in my life when I was experiencing mild panic attacks.
13325,"I've had periods of my life where work was stressful, or a negative life event occurred (I'm sure your dad being the ICU for health problems has been a stressful life event), not to mention if the world just being chaotic and every news headline being extreme - can definitely have a backlash in peoples overall wellbeing."
13326,"Dude, if you can't take some very mild criticism on Reddit maybe stay of the internet."

13383,There is too much vaccine resistance at a time when we need 90% of people vaccinated to control the spread.
13384,Delta is too infectious for vaccines to work with these levels of skepticism.
13385,I think your ideas are sound from a strictly orthodox viewpoint.
13386,"But in the end, only something extreme will have any hope of stopping the endless variant cycle."
13387,"Vaccines can greatly reduce death in variants, but will ultimately assist with the spread of the next variant, as the most mutated variants will enjoy the natural selection conditions we create with outdated vaccines."

13524,It is called pandemic for a reason.
13525,The idiocy of the population is a different story.
13526,"In British Columbia where I am from we have stated that we are now ""coupling "" cases, ICU and Deaths."
13527,Meaning we no longer are counting cases to decide what health restrictions to enforce but more so monitoring deaths and ICU rates.

13550,I cannot risk being sedentary for months waiting for a surge to pass.

13564,"Very infirm, immunocompromised, or some other condition."
13565,There are a number of these people out there and they are likely still at decent risk even when vaccinated.
13566,"I agree with all those things, then, but I don't think people should be punished for not having one when they get sick."
13567,"Since 2/3 of unvaccinated people are open to having vaccines, the business and travel bans would incentivize more compliance

""hey, can't come in here unless you have proof of vaccinations""

13610,Unsurprisingly we have the worst outbreak in Canada and it's growing fast--not just in one area anymore either.
13611,There‚Äôs a growing consensus among health experts: Covid-19 may never go away.
13612,"We‚Äôll likely always have some coronavirus out there, infecting people and, hopefully only in rare cases, getting them seriously ill."
13613,The realistic goal is to defang the virus ‚Äî make it less deadly ‚Äî not eliminate it entirely.
13614,This is not a surrender to the virus.
13615,"For a long time, we‚Äôve lived with the seasonal flu, a family of viruses that kills up to tens of thousands of Americans each year."
13616,"While we can and should take steps to mitigate the risks of the flu (including getting vaccinated for it every year), we‚Äôve never been willing to shut down society or close in-person schooling to fully eradicate it."
13617,Americans have accepted some level of risk to continue living normally.
13618,The same will likely be true with Covid-19.

13622,"It was ""bear week"" (or whatever it's properly called) in p-town."
13623,I'm absolutely not shocked that there was some breakthrough infection.
13624,Exactly.
13625,Turning away unvaccinated Covid patients is more like turning away people who jumped into a predator pen at the zoo to take a selfie.
13626,These are people who bear so much blame for such an easily avoidable mistake that they should be at the absolute rock bottom of the health care system's priority list.
13627,"It's completely irresponsible and wrong to state that ""vaccine doesn't offer protection from contracting""."
13628,Now who's cherry picking?
13629,"The hospitalization rate for fully vaccinated people is slightly less than 1 hospitalization per 100,000 people and almost no deaths are reported among people who are fully vaccinated."
13630,"This is what we're talking about, death."
13631,Almost no deaths.

13682,Why?
13683,Why not dedicate one hospital in a region where urgent care for the uninfected and vaccinated can go?

13689,Or other necessary surgery.
13690,We were at the last stage before spreading further and hopefully it hasn't.
13691,"Based on all the tests we think we have an excellent chance, but if we had an earlier Covid surge, the surgery would have been postponed."

13695,Who have family they dare not get sick.

Also everyone from pediatricians to child psychologists are pointing out it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to assess IQ measures of an infant."
13802,IQ measures are typically used at an older age than infant.
13803,Typically beginning with preschoolers and up.
13804,"&gt; So you agree, this article you‚Äôve provided and the OP article provides two different models and outcomes and that the scientific community does not have a single model that accounts for everything."
13805,Realize the article I gave you is 9 days out of date.
13806,It was a prediction on August 5th where the actual numbers from Florida overran the prediction in that model.
13807,So that model is obviously wrong.
13808,The only reason I posted it was to show you that the rates of infection go down at the same rate they went up.
13809,The peak was wrong but the exponential growth before the peak and exponential decay after the peak are not wrong.
13810,That's a standard logistics model which everyone uses for biological systems.
13811,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function

If you google the derivative of the logistics function to get a graph of it, you'll see that matches the case rate of the model I posted above."
13812,"The logistics function is the total infected, and the derivative is the case rate."

14075,As an active member of the church I find it hilarious and infuriating at the same time.
14076,We believe that when the prophets and apostles get together and come out with messages like this that it is inspired by God.
14077,"(Not everything the leadership says would be considered ""gospel"" because they are fallible people like anyone of us."
14078,I.e.
14079,"there are books that previous apostles of the church have written, but they wouldn't be considered 100% rule or gospel since it wasn't approved by *all* the the current leadership."
14080,It would be more like  good advice/reading than gospel).
14081,"That being said, this announcement was approved by them all."
14082,This would be considered inspired of God.
14083,"Those who claim they trust in the prophets, but don't follow this don't actually trust in the prophets and apostles."
14084,Basically they have little faith.
14085,I also consider this more important than other guidances.
14086,I.e.
14087,members are supposed to try their best to be like Christ right?
14088,So swearing and crude jokes etc would be considered not following what we are taught.
14089,I guess the difference to me would be: swearing every now and then doesn't out others life in danger.
14090,You can improve yourself overtime.
14091,Not getting a vaccination or wearing a mask when you should is actively putting other people's life's in danger.

That being said I am 100% not surprised that there is pushback from people."
14093,If it brings them to leave the church they are just proving themselves to be tares (parable of wheat and tares).
14094,There's a pretty large problem when it comes to the culture of areas with a high amount of LDS members.
14095,The church becomes more of a status symbol to them then a religious practice.
14096,"A general ""holier than thou"" vibe can run rampant in these areas (Kaysville Utah I'm looking at you)."
14097,"This is very obviously contrary to what the church, gospel, and scriptures teach."
14098,Christ taught us to love everyone.
14099,Help others out of the goodness of our hearts and not be like the Pharisees who were donating lots money to show everyone how much money they have and how awesome they are.
14100,It's not necessarily unique to the LDS church and it's not the church's fault.
14101,Things slowly start to become tradition and greed takes ahold of people.
14102,They begin teaching their kids and their friends to do thing x when really thing x is not taught nor condoned by the church.
14103,I.e some local leader (like a bishop or similar) was telling people not to let their kids stay the night at a friend's house.
14104,This eventually became really common among some Mormon families.
14105,The church has stepped up their game recently and are trying to combat it.
14106,Lots of members I know tend to be right leaning and don't like things like immigration and helping refugees even though Christ very specifically taught us to help everyone even if we don't like them.
14107,(You fed me and clothed me...

14109,The church has amended parts of the [general handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/title-page?lang=eng) to be more specific.
14110,They have a [webpage dedicated to refugees](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/refugees) now.

14114,such an asshole urgh.
14115,This is totally the administrations fault for deciding to have the vaccination record use the most ridiculous ancient tech possible.
14116,"It's freakin 2021, why are you using a hand written piece of paper for the most important medical record you will carry on you for the next few years."
14117,As an American I find this disgusting.
14118,It was nowhere near what your people experienced there.
14119,Do you think that 'thinking a medication is harmful' and 'shooting children with a spear gun' is similar in terms of crazy level?

14210,working people have busy schedules and cant leave their duties easily.

14215,Citing data from Congress's General Accounting Office.
14216,They're saying that 85% of troops who received the anthrax vaccine reported adverse side effects.
14217,And I was a service member who received that vaccine.
14218,And I have a friend who claims to be completely disabled because of her adverse side effect from this vaccine.
14219,"So you can understand my cause for concern and why I would like to hear some doctors respond to vaccine injury claims such as these, right?"
14220,"Type ""readify.me/"" in front of the http...."
14221,It‚Äôs also about treating the one who has more urgent needs (unvaccinated) over the one with mild flu like symptoms (vaccinated).
14222,Not everyone unvaccinated is a dead man walking so you can‚Äôt just assume they‚Äôre all going to be denied care during triage.
14223,"&gt;in short, based on the way the article is worded (poorly) either one of us might be right, but without clarifying info, there‚Äôs no way to be positive who is right."
14224,This is basically how I was going to respond.
14225,At some point we need to make an assumption.
14226,I chose to go monthly because it's the low end and a sufficient motivator in my view but if it's more I'm still satisfied.
14227,Last summer's wave peaked at around the same time and then a worse wave hit in the winter.
14228,It's crazy to think this will just peak in a few weeks and be gone until next fall.
14229,It's crazy to think a virus will just take the holidays off totally ignoring what happened just last year.
14230,I understand not wanting to live in fear and not caring if you get covid.
14231,"Though I find it ironic this is the term many of them use when they are the ones who are spouting off truly frightening conspiracies‚Ä¶

What I DON‚ÄôT understand is how from the beginning, these people willingly exposed themselves (and others) knowing the hospitals were overcrowded, and when they got sick they fucking went there anyway."
14232,That was bad enough.
14233,But now we have a vaccine‚Ä¶ and these people are choosing not to get it.

14242,"Right, we should just stop vaccinating because in the future there might be a variant it doesn‚Äôt work against."
14243,Might as well just die to delta in that case.
14244,"Most (or at least many) American Catholics believe in birth control, gay marriage, women priests, abortion rights, and everything that separates liberal Protestants from Catholic doctrine, but they still support the Catholic brand."

14246,Polls show American Catholics are more liberal than Protestants but the American Catholic Church is one of the most powerful Conservative political forces.
14247,"Thought masks, immunizations, and passports were in full force in NYC ?"
14248,Same!
14249,I got attacked on another thread for saying Pfizer sucks.
14250,"It does, my husband and I both currently have breakthrough Covid."
14251,My Pfizer vaccinated friend and family just got over the virus too.

14255,Died of covid... or overdosed on FREEEEEDOM \*USA USA USA\*
14256,"Ok, buh bye then."
14257,"I‚Äôm sorry, this sounds like BS."
14258,This only lasts until quarantines start happening and they realize you don't have to work from home if you're on quarantine cause all your shits at the office and you can't come in and now your boss has to logistically get shit to you in your house while you may have Covid.
14259,So suddenly your whole office is work from home again because fuck it it's working better that way.
14260,"Since they can charge more for pre-existing conditions/choices like this one, can employer insurance also charge more for conditions people aren't responsible for, such as cancer, or just things related to personal choices?"
14261,It‚Äôs hilarious that they are complaining about free agency as if it‚Äôs the first time a Mormon prophet has communicated any sort of expectations.
14262,That‚Äôs nonsense.
14263,"Two weeks pause will
Absolutely do nothing to cut down the spread of Covid"
14264,Suppose 5 people are in a lobby and all have identical problems.
14265,There are four spaces in the hospital and three have insurance( or sufficient funds) which person has to wait?
14266,I find it hard to believe this would be handled by dart board or dice.
14267,I am sure you have much more experience with hospitals than I do.
14268,Is this actually something a licensed nurse decides?
14269,Reception and billing usually screened me before I ever talked to a nurse.
14270,They make you sign financial liability paperwork.
14271,I was with someone who was trying to get admitted for insanity.
14272,She refused to sign anything on the grounds that she was not in her right mind and did not know if she would still agree to anything she that signed after recovery.
14273,I recall this was an impasse that lasted for a really long time.
14274,Reception never gave in.
14275,A doctor eventually bypassed them.
14276,I had been listening to her for hours so I knew better than to escort her home without seeing a doctor.
14277,"No one doctor, nurse, or reception had any doubt she was crazy at that time."
14278,So you are correct we did technically get in without her signing the admission paperwork.
14279,The vast majority of people (normal cooperative sane people) would have walked away and later said they were refused hospital care because they refused to sign for financial liability.

14285,The big question to me is if yearly boosters will be recommended going forward as you alluded to along with flu shots.
14286,Some vaccine companies are working on combo ones.

14322,"I don't personally care if another person is vaccinated aside from the mutation issue (which is a big issue, but past a certain point of vaccinated population, I don't care)."
14323,But the people who are refusing the vaccine are the same ones refusing masks and social distancing practices and LYING about their vaccination status and driving this spread.
14324,They're filling up the hospitals.
14325,How can I feel remotely safe taking my kids in public... let alone send them to school?
14326,"My trust in my ""community"" is shattered."

14344,"Being vaccinated, his odds are much better."
14345,"Like, 99.9% chance of survival and maybe 1 or 2% chance of needing hospitalization."
14346,I think that's going to have a long tail.
14347,"People aren't able to get needed preventive care for chronic illnesses and elective surgeries are going to get postponed and cancelled, just like last year."
14348,"When I first heard about the elective surgeries getting cancelled last year, I was like ""Cool, people can wait on boob jobs or whatever until after the pandemic,"" but ""elective"" just means ""If we don't do the surgery right now, you won't die today."""
14349,"However, a lot of cardiovascular stuff, excisions of tumors and spinal surgeries to prevent permanent damage and paralysis fall under ""elective,"" because you know, you won't die today if they don't do the surgery immediately, right?"

14381,&gt; Data indicate that Delta is 40-60% more transmissible than Alpha and almost twice as transmissible as the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2.
14382,"&gt; The study, which was conducted in the U.K., reported an 88% efficacy against Delta after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine, but only 30.7% efficacy after 1 dose

&gt; Out of the 469 identified cases of COVID-19, 346 or 74% of them were breakthrough infections that occurred in people who were fully vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or 1 dose of the J&amp;J vaccine."
14383,Genomic analysis revealed that Delta was responsible for 90% of the 133 sequenced breakthrough infections.

14413,"Top medical professionals began sounding the alarm this week that the Mississippi hospital system could fail in 5-10 days if the current trajectory of new COVID-19 cases continues.‚Äù 

5-10 days?"

14416,I've definitely spiraled a bit but whew.
14417,and someone reposted it there \^^
14418,"Honest, as good-faith an answer I can write:

At this time, in a macro sense getting Covid is a bit more concerning than getting a cold."
14419,"It spreads a lot easier, so if you‚Äôre infected and you‚Äôre around someone that‚Äôs vulnerable, chances are they‚Äôre gonna get it, and that can get pretty bad, clearly."
14420,When Covid puts someone in the hospital that person tends to remain there a lot longer than with flu or other diseases.
14421,"We‚Äôre talking two week stays, iirc if you do get hospitalized from flu it‚Äôs 3-5 days on average."
14422,"You see a lot about 80% icu capacity, and while it is true that hospitals reach that point in the winter, with Covid that effectively doubles the number of actual beds needed- ordinarily you can just count on those beds being turned around."
14423,"Secondly, on a personal level, a couple things I don‚Äôt like."
14424,"The biggest one is loss of taste and smell- this is not a usual symptom for colds, it‚Äôs a common one for Covid, even in otherwise mild, head cold like disease."
14425,Some people report a quick recovery on that front.
14426,Some report changes in how their sense of smell work.
14427,"It seems to be the longest lingering symptom Covid usually presents- if you‚Äôre having symptoms lasting for six weeks or longer, it‚Äôs probably the lost taste."
14428,"This isn‚Äôt a world ender- most people with this long term are otherwise completely fine, but a lot of what we enjoy in life is based on taste and smell."
14429,It‚Äôd be a shame to lose it.
14430,"I‚Äôm reassured on the next front based on what we know, but questions are still out there: long Covid."
14431,I still don‚Äôt know how likely it is for that to happen after vaccination.
14432,"So in short, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more concerning than just a cold."
14433,"As for whether or not it‚Äôll be more concerning than the flu in five years, that remains to be seen."
14434,As a woman with a child that is turning two soon.
14435,YES.

14661,It‚Äôs absolute batshit insanity and it runs much deeper than you care to admit.
14662,"Lol, did you really just try to race bait me on vaccination?"

&gt; Keep in mind when wishing death upon these people

Where did I wish death on anybody?"
14672,I pointed out that refusal to be vaccinated should be met with refusal of care.
14673,Why tax the limited resources of our hospitals treating people that don't take any proactive measures to protect themselves and society in general?

14678,"But on a more serious note, I got Moderna and I was not sold on the viral vector delivery method of the J&amp;J vaccine even before any vaccines were authorized."
14679,"Before the pandemic, I only heard about viral vector therapy in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials and none of the treatments met their end points."
14680,"Not to mention, viral vectors are known to be limited in not being able to use the same vaccine type as a booster due to the body's natural immunity."
14681,"The mainstream media are reporting this study to find, eg ""Americans with PhDs are most reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID""."
14682,See the critique comments in the article linked.
14683,"But also, I suggest that anti-vax are more likely to falsify their credentials."
14684,Just a thought.
14685,"&gt; Yes I know its stupid, but these are stupid times."
14686,This sums up so much.
14687,Do any of these models say why they expect that timing?
14688,It seems like everyone just picks an arbitrary date 5-20 days in the future to make us feel like we have to act now to stop the worst but that it isn't going to be too bad.
14689,No doubt.
14690,The main thing I‚Äôve noticed is that people who had no care about politics before Covid are suddenly experts on government policy.
14691,Pre pandemic these people couldn‚Äôt name one person in government.
14692,This is because most people don‚Äôt care about any issues until it affects them.
14693,Yes lol
14694,"meanwhile we're letting vaccines expire and have to throw them away in the U.S, it's really a crime against humanity."
14695,they should have a way to donate vaccines to other countries before they expire.

14701,Because vaccines are not 100%.
14702,I'm going to an indoor concert this week and vaccines are required for entry.
14703,No way would I go if that wasn't the case.
14704,Anti-vaxxers are a danger to everyone and responsible people should not have to be exposed to them.
14705,"If they would like to participate in society, they should take the steps necessary to not endanger others."
14706,Wow it's like the states who offered up freebies *back in Spring* also have relatively free ICU beds
14707,They would‚Äôve pushed and shoved to get the vaccine had it been available to everyone a few months earlier but now I think they‚Äôre just trying to make sure that our country stays in a terrible situation so they can blame the current administration for their troubles.
14708,"This doesn't fully answer your question, but with regards to medications, some things work totally differently."

14714,It's not just linearly faster or slower.

14716,"Some drugs, like aspirin, should be completely avoided in kids."
14717,3.)
14718,The volume of distribution is much higher in kids.
14719,This means that the dose adjustment by weight for certain drugs won't be a straightforward weight adjustment.

14726,It was always going to be a matter of time before an official system was implemented.
14727,Honor system never works.
14728,"&gt;Because the NAb resistance is a remarkable phenotype of most VOCs [reviewed in (Harvey et al., 2021)], we next analyzed the sensitivity of the Lambda S to the NAbs induced by BNT162b2 vaccination."
14729,"**As shown in Figure 2B, the Lambda S is 1.5-fold in average (2.63-fold at a maximum) more resistant to the BNT162b2-induced antisera than the parental D614G S** (P = 0.0077 by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test)."
14730,"On the other hand, the neutralization level of the Lambda+N246-253RSYLTPGD was similar to the D614G pseudovirus (P = 0.21 by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), and this recovered variant was 1.37-fold more sensitive to the vaccine-induced neutralization than the Lambda (P = 0.0016 by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) (Figure 2B)."
14731,"**These results suggest that the Lambda S is highly infectious and resistant to the vaccine-induced humoral immunity**, and the robust resistance of the Lambda S to the vaccine-induced neutralization is determined by a large deletion in the NTD."
14732,It wasn't in the abstract.
14733,Emphasis mine.
14734,TLDR the vaccine targets the Sars-cov2 spike protein.
14735,"The mutations in Lambda, unlike in Delta, are to this very protein."
14736,Yes.
14737,One of the hypotheses as to why children were catching Covid less is that children have stronger innate immune systems.
14738,"This is the ""general purpose"" part of your immune system that targets anything that looks like a virus or bacteria as opposed to your immune system learning how to fight a particular pathogen based on its particular protein sequences."
14739,"However, now with Delta, the doses of virus that are being spewed are so high that even kids' stronger innate immune systems tend to be overwhelmed, so kids are easily infected too."
14740,"Between adults, I'm sure there are natural biological variations in the strength of the innate immune system."
14741,"Taiwan counts anyone whose ever tested positive and later dies as a Covid-19 death, even if the death was natural and not related to Covod-19."
14742,"You know this already though, because I told you last time."
14743,I only come to this subreddit when I'm ready to feel upset for a few minutes.
14744,This subreddit doesn't believe in healthcare as a human right.
14745,It doesn't believe in first doing no harm.
14746,It doesn't even believe in doing the things that save the most lives within our current system.
14747,It only cares about petty grievance politics.
14748,God helps those who help themselves would be my answer to those dumbasses
14749,"Both Eric‚Äôs see what‚Äôs happening in the hospitals, you‚Äôre mad because they‚Äôre telling the truth"
14750,&gt; Do you think that 'thinking a medication is harmful' and 'shooting children with a spear gun' is similar in terms of crazy level?
14751,One is definitely much worse.
14752,The guy with the spear gun will only kill a couple of people.
14753,The anti-vaxxer idiot spreading lies and disease will contribute to the deaths of thousands if not more.
14754,Who‚Äôs excusing anything?
14755,At no point did I say there *wasn‚Äôt* a political aspect to this coming from a particular party.
14756,I‚Äôm saying you can‚Äôt boil down the issue to JUST that supporters.
14757,"If you‚Äôre just going to keep whining about the concept of looking at multiple sides of an issue, don‚Äôt bother responding."
14758,I can‚Äôt deal with that kind of willful ignorance.
14759,It truly does feel like we‚Äôre fighting in a war.

14822,She's a nurse too which somehow makes it even worse.
14823,I even tried to be accommodating and offer porch visits despite the fact that deep down inside I just wanted to scream at her.
14824,"We have a strict policy of no unvaccinated friends or family inside of our home and it made me furious that she thought she should be an exception, like her conspiracy theory way of thinking is ultimately more important than my kids' health."
14825,This shit is absolutely dividing people.
14826,I will never forget that some people cared so little about my children (and all children too young to get vaxxed and vulnerable people in our community) that they couldn't nut up and get a shot and wear a damn mask for a while.

14900,‚ÄúThey can modify premiums to offer potentially tax-free incentives worth as much as 30% of the cost of coverage as part of workplace wellness programs.
14901,‚Ä¶.
14902,"Government guidance released in May suggests that as long as providing proof of vaccination is voluntary and the employer itself isn‚Äôt giving the shots, significant incentives for jabs are fair game.‚Äù

So it‚Äôs not quite the same as charging more for not having the vaccine, but you are allowed to significantly incentivize good health practices like getting the vaccine."
14903,The point is that current BC and Alberta outbreaks are very comparable.
14904,BC's surge cannot be way beyond the rest of the country when Alberta's numbers are only a day or two behind BC's.
14905,This is a statistical fact.

14930,We will only need more and more nurses and lose more and more people if we allow them to willingly put themselves and others in danger for no logical reason.

14936,"There are also virtually no restrictions in much of the country now, with rapidly increasing Delta variant cases."

14946,This aged well
14947,[removed]
14948,He was a patient on my covid icu unit.
14949,And smokers would contribute less on average because they are living less.
14950,Which means less taxes/insurance premiums.
14951,This thought occurred to me a few weeks ago.
14952,It is definitely a possibility.
14953,I'm just not 100% sure how likely it is.
14954,I don't know enough about how viruses work to feel comfortable guessing what the feasible set of mutations consists of.
14955,"For a super virus to catch on, it would have to do 3 things: evade vaccines, be more transmissible than the current dominant strain and be more deadly."
14956,That seems like a lot of things that would have to happen.
14957,"But, on the one hand, we have 7 or 8 billion people passing covid back and forth, many of them who also see animals on a daily basis, many of whom have immune disorders."
14958,There has literally never been a better incubator for variants.
14959,The state he was vaccinated in MIGHT actually be recording that info somewhere else.
14960,"In Louisiana, the state actually has a central vaccination repository (existed before COVID), and all COVID vaccinations that happen in Louisiana get entered into this database."
14961,There's also a Louisiana Wallet digital drivers license app that now includes a person's COVID vaccination status and dates.
14962,"It gets pulled from the state's database, so it's not something that a shady person can update themselves."
14963,"(I'm generally one that is worried about things like this, but right know, I don't care.)"
14964,Ok let‚Äôs speed this along then.
14965,"Oh shit, 70% of the world is vaccinated!"
14966,This guy.
14967,"Ugh, every day he sinks to a new low"
14968,Covid evolves fast.
14969,In the same my my father O2 went from 94% to 83%.
14970,He was taken to hospital when it was around 88%.
14971,A hour later (the time to see him) it was 83%.
14972,That‚Äôs a bit unfair.
14973,"I think everyone should think about, and learn about the vaccine."
14974,"I don‚Äôt understand the hesitation past that, though."
14975,"It's not the weight that feels protective, just my shitty stress/binge eating habit."
14976,I know what's causing it and there's very little I can do about it.
14977,Common side effect.
14978,Should disappear in a week or two.
14979,What identification do they require for adolescents?
14980,Could I bring my 11 year old to a drive through vaccine site and bluff that she‚Äôs 12?
14981,Every season is Covid season in Florida
14982,Doctors cannot ethically or legally refuse to treat a patient who is in immediate danger of dying.
14983,"That‚Äôs because you‚Äôve been brainwashed by Hollywood, *obviously*."
14984,Of course it will.
14985,Catching and recovering from Covid gives you immunity as well.
14986,"We will reach herd immunity one way or another, just we as a society have decided to do it the stupid painful way."
14987,I cannot imagine intubating a child.
14988,Just no.
14989,"I mean, I‚Äôm objectively right given that I know people on the left who refuse to get the shot because they don‚Äôt understand science and not because they support a particular political party, so I‚Äôm not sure how it is you think I‚Äôm wrong."
14990,Why do you have such a problem with examining multiple sides of an issue?
14991,"I know and hope as you do, but if we do nothing or very little we should expect the same."
14992,Keep on owning them lbrulZ.
14993,It'll work any day now.
14994,Only if people take actions.
14995,Sadly Americans rather deny that it‚Äôs here than take actions.

15001,You contribute when you are young and take out when you are old.
15002,"Not that one is counted against he other mathematically, but philosophically we look at a lifetime of contributing and using."

15017,When does max immunity occur after the 2nd vaccination shot?
15018,"It seems that 2 weeks is minimum, and around 6 months is when you start to see a drop."
15019,When is the max?
15020,3 weeks out?
15021,3 months out?
15022,NO

15026,Big brain.
15027,"Well 2 months ago people would have been saying that's because UAE used those crappy Chinese vaccines, whereas we are sitting pretty with our superior western made mRNA shots that would totally protect us."
15028,Now it looks like delta doesn't give a shit and we're all gonna need a booster shot no matter what kind of vaccines we had gotten.
15029,It's interesting that they are accepting previous infections
15030,Florida Man: Hold my beer.
15031,"Depending on the situation, requiring some people to be vaccinated for certain activities makes sense as a public health thing."
15032,For example requiring health care providers be vaccinated makes sense to me.
15033,The question then becomes who and for what activities.
15034,Requiring people to be vaccinated to attend an indoors convention probably makes sense ... requiring people to be vaccinated to enter an outdoors park would probably not make sense.
15035,Holy crap.
15036,We are doomed.
15037,"Not only that, getting a fake card is not cheap."
15038,A fake vaccine card can cost you $60 to $150.
15039,Why spend that kind of money when you can get a real card for FREE and it only costs you 2 tiny jabs in the arm.

15057,OR even a simple ER trauma nurse in the middle of a city hospital.
15058,"You'd have 1) a large, concentrated population that is likely to have easy access to the vaccine."
15059,"2) With a large number of people going to say, 3 or 4 hospitals, those 10, 20 people out of millions vaccinated are going to head to those specific hospitals."
15060,"3) even out of a city, those hospitals may very well be the best in a specific region."
15061,"Oklahoma City, for example, may be the best bet in the entire 100 mile region."
15062,"So, the people who need special care (Say, you have lung issues, or need a specialist, ect)

3) Then you realize that if there are any risk factors for having any side effect (Diabetes, being over/under weight, any kind of age related issue,) May very well be concentrated in certain areas, such as says, say, Areas that are poor, densely populated, have a history of pollution, or high crime, ect)"
15063,"I usually don't, but I think I will this year."
15064,In Georgia you might be better off letting local school boards handle that over letting a State agency.

15073,We‚Äôre about to see a reckoning.
15074,"If I am vaccinated, I have, say only 10% of the risk, but if you're vaccinated too, and you have only 10% chance of getting it, then my risk of getting it from you is only 1%!!"
15075,"Your vaccination helps me, and my vaccination helps you."
15076,"For example, I'm not going to the movies, but if a theater admitted only vaccinated people, I would go."
15077,Why?
15078,Lifetime isn‚Äôt relevant at all for an insurance company/nationalized healthcare because they‚Äôll pay less in taxes if they die earlier.
15079,YOu should watch this [documentary](https://www.thebrainwashingofmydad.com/).
15080,You underestimate the power of brainwashing
15081,Americans only understand dollar signs
15082,All the 3 things you counted are not simple at all due to human behavior.
15083,Nice try but you failed.
15084,Also just FYI we do treat smokers differently when it comes to insurance so maybe we should do that at the very least.

15087,"&gt;DeSantis said Florida was a place that people ""move to to follow their dreams""

15088,I agree with you both but what is stopping it from getting just as bad as Florida?
15089,Just look at our numbers almost doubling every week.
15090,Eventually we get to where they're at if we generally do nothing.
15091,Philly has the same vaccination rate as Broward county.
15092,The mask mandate in the city will help some.
15093,Just look at how it started going up in the south.
15094,Our charts look the same just shifted by time.

15116,Please explain how immigration is causing this.
15117,We've had a notable increase in upper respiratory infections that aren't COVID in our pediatric population.
15118,Much higher than July/August of 2018 and 2019 (and 2020 but that doesn't count).

15178,"Many people see the latest information about vaccinated getting sick and continuing to spread even if they don't get sick (Israel), and they lose confidence in the current strategy."
15179,It seems clear that masking and vaccinations will not stop the pandemic.
15180,"(The delta variant originated in India, and then swept through vaccinated nations without consideration for vaccination numbers in those nations) people see this and realize that covid is unstoppable and part of our lives."
15181,"Thankfully, it isn't particularly deadly, even if it is particularly transmissible."
15182,"It looks like it's moving in the direction of the common cold, which means we will be living with a fast-spreading low-mortality virus well into the future."
15183,"This is a good outcome, and we should start talking about how to continue within this context."

15234,"The family trusted they could be around each other safely, but ultimately his own mom died due to his negligence."
15235,"I'm not an evil person who thinks like this all the time, but part of me hopes that he'll feel guilty about being the reason his mom died and that stays with him his whole life because I'm just so frustrated at losing yet another loved one who did nothing wrong and was harmed by someone they trusted."

15242,NO SHIT it's due to unvaccinated people.
15243,But is anyone bothering to verify the vaccination status of those coming in?
15244,Nope.
15245,"Those same people who are stickers about travel restrictions, pushing for vaccine status cards, have no problem looking the other way."

15255,"It's definitely true that people who have received the full round of current vaccinations are at a much lower risk of severe symptoms or death, a great reason to get vaccinated."
15256,"Unfortunately, only about 15% of the global population has been vaccinated so far, and of course the vaccinations have a limited lifespan if you are fortunate enough to get them."
15257,It sounds like you‚Äôve literally never stepped foot inside of an LDS church.

15286,"The most interesting thing for me is how Idara said that her perception of the pandemic changed when she moved from acute care to a job at the vaccine clinics, it shows just how much one person's individual circumstances can change the way they view what is happening and how tough it is on the ""front line""."

15327,"These Healthcare workers didn't want the vaccines when they were first released because their PPE and precautions had worked for nearly a year, and they had no data to asses the risk of the newly released vaccines."
15328,"The recent vaccination mandates make even less sense to them given the CDC's recent explicit statements that vaccinated people still catch and spread COVID, the blood clot risks are documented, and they have taken care of patients who had adverse reactions to the vaccines."
15329,"They're not totally crazy, but I think they should rate the risk of catching a severe case of COVID higher."
15330,The new variants and the reduced mask wear by vaccinated people significantly increase the risk of catching COVID outside of their work.
15331,"I mean, hasn't it already?"
15332,"We have the delta variant here now which breaks through vaccination at a significantly higher rate, and the lambda variant currently wrecking parts of South America seems to make current vaccines useless."

15362,"Is it weird that they had to turn off comments on their social media posts about this, if everyone was on board?"
15363,Why is it that my TBM family and others that I know well have been anti mask and anti vaccine if the church already had this stance?

15374,Simply waiting around until the next election to replace a lousy governor is not working out.
15375,That's good old hypocrisy in action.
15376,If people who go to church won't listen to Jesus when he commands them to love people why would they listen to living prophets who tell them to mask up and get vaccinated?
15377,"""THE FACT THAT ALMOST ALL THE MUTATIONS¬†arising within a single infection never make it out into the wider world confers a major evolutionary handicap on the virus."
15378,"However, this can be compensated for if the total number of infections is very large."""
15379,"And that is why it matters to other people that a person refuses to wear a mask, get the vaccine, or isolate when they are supposed to."
15380,What‚Äôs my risk while sitting at my desk at work?
15381,"The facts:

I guess I‚Äôm not asking about person-to-person, more so about how easily Delta recirculates in the air."
15382,"Precisely, they can apply certain knowledge, I agree with you there."
15383,But they (the nurses in the article above) are not using intelligence when it comes to knowledge and understanding of vaccines.
15384,Perhaps it‚Äôs more so a lack of knowledge than intelligence then?

15393,It‚Äôs a little bit different because there‚Äôs tons of different underlying causes to certain things like diabetes or obesity.
15394,"But unless someone medically can‚Äôt get the vaccine, these anti vaxxer idiots that are currently causing a problem are doing so purely from stupidity."
15395,"I would also argue that alcoholism, addiction, obesity, etc require longer term treatment and healthy choices to overcome, not a simple needle stick that literally takes 2 seconds."
15396,And many insurance companies and employers offer incentives for losing weight or quitting smoking.

15684,If we pursue natural immunity it will lead to mass death.

15697,The chances of breakthroughs are reduced heavily by increasing the rate of vaccinations in a given population.
15698,No vaccine is 100% but the reason we rarely see breakthroughs with other vaccines (the flu vaccine notwithstanding) is because very many people have taken those vaccines.

15755,But then another person walks up with a hall pass (the vaccine).
15756,So would you walk into the room or take the hall pass?
15757,19% is still really fucking high.
15758,But I think more study and time is needed.
15759,Fatigue for 2 months after getting covid isn‚Äôt the end of the world nor is a headache that goes away with time.
15760,The real question is at 6 months to a year how many still have issues?
15761,The loss of smell is also the most concerning as that hints at brain impacts.
15762,So I‚Äôd want to know how common that one specifically is.
15763,I‚Äôm not scared of covid if it just makes me tired for 2 months.

15765,"I really think society needs to chill out, wear their masks this winter, work from home if you can, and allow until the spring for more studies to come out before we start having lollapalooza and telling everyone there‚Äôs no risk to the vaccinated."
15766,"I was wondering if there was actual new evidence since this is a pretty major thing and the more information the better, especially with the title specifically stating ""NEW studies,"" but reading the article it's the same study that was widely reported and trending from over *3 months ago."

15794,"They have high death rates because they were hit hard early, with massive amounts of Covid circulating before lockdowns even."

15844,Ouchie.
15845,"All viruses replicate in people that are infected, whether that's a breakthrough or not."
15846,"If it wasn't like that, then you wouldn't get sick."
15847,They also need to replicate to make more viruses and spread.
15848,The real question you need to ask is how many breakthrough infections there are versus the number of people vaccinated.
15849,"For unvaccinated people, that's 100%, every infection is technically a breakthrough of their immune system."
15850,"For those who are vaccinated, they have a much tougher immune system but it's not infallible and if their behavior is very risky, even the toughest immune system can fail."
15851,"You can't expect to go into a room full of people infected with covid for hours without any precautions and not catch it, eventually enough of the virus will get into your body that it overwhelms your immune system."
15852,"There is an implied assertion there that the unvaccinated are sufficiently well off, that they have a 401K (or other finances)."
15853,"In the rural FL county I live in, the 12+ at least one jab percentage is 37%."
15854,So 63% have the age-related ability to be vaccinated and have not done so.
15855,This county has 18.1% uninsured rate and a poverty rate of 17.9%.
15856,Both are roughly double the national average.
15857,"This county is not alone, those numbers are similar for three other neighboring counties, all rural."
15858,"People for whom vaccination will cost them nothing, and potentially save them money, are resisting the jab."

15876,"Most of the people unvaccinated are poor and disabled, so your just advocating for discrimination not owning the republicans."
15877,"This is why nurses and doctors make the recommendations on such things, not random people who likely have an adequate standard of living"
15878,"There have been people looking at breakthrough rates only during the time delta has been prevalent, which is probably more meaningful to our current experience."
15879,"However, I suspect that most people have a problem with this statistic because they can't apply it to their personal experience."
15880,"Breakthrough infection rates are highly situational, and vary based on things like a person's underlying health, their response to the vaccine, their individual behavior, and the context in which they live."
15881,"As dabears4hss shows, many of them will reach the erroneous conclusion that the statistic is wrong simply because it doesn't match their experience."
15882,"But the statistic isn't wrong, its just not strongly correlated to many people's reality."
15883,"Unfortunately, given the data that's available, there really isn't a better stat to report."
15884,Ahhh thanks for your comment.
15885,Yeah I tried it for 5 months.

15893,I don‚Äôt get it.
15894,"Covid has really poked all the holes, hasn‚Äôt it."
15895,&gt;People who have had Covid actually have more protection against Covid than people who got both vaccines.
15896,Isn't this totally wrong?
15897,"Sure, I knew all that."
15898,You were arguing that my predictions were overblown and covid was not a big deal.
15899,My predictions for logistic growth were accurate.
15900,Your predictions based on a monthly doubling rate were hilariously poor.
15901,Just read the comments if you need more explanation
15902,FDA screwed up not authorizing vaccine for kids before back to school.
15903,"A few more months of study are not going to fundamentally alter safety, but are going to render vaccine pointless since most kids will catch delta by the time it's approved, short of lock down."
15904,"*checks google*

*total fully vaccinated is 71.5% of population*

28.5% of the population is unvaccinated and they're experiencing a surge in cases."

15921,"I guarantee you most people who are ""mentally disabled"" are getting the vaccine."
15922,people with intellectual disability in particular rely a lot on face to face interactions and often have comorbidities that make them high risk.
15923,"they also mostly aren't on facebook reading covid 19 conspiracy theories, but are hanging out with their families, going to day programs for people with developmental disabilities, etc (and in some cases working), meaning they generally aren't recipients of the disinformation network that is convincing people not to get vaccinated."

15974,"If doctors have to choose between two people on the organ wait-list they choose the one most likely to survive, part of which is complying with follow-on care."
15975,"This is similar, where if you have to choose between two patients to get an ICU bed, maybe don't choose the one who refused a vaccine during a pandemic."
15976,"Of course that's only if you have to ration card, I'm not saying to turn them away from empty hospitals, but it is wrong that people who comply are being turned away because the beds are full of people who haven't, and who maybe STILL won't get vaccinated from future variants."

16190,90 CEOs of leading U.S. companies have urged President Joe Biden to accelerate donation of vaccines to Vietnam as it battles its most serious Covid-19 outbreak yet.
16191,"In a letter sent to the U.S. President, the CEOs of companies like Adidas, Coach, Gap, Hanesbrands, Nike, VF and Under Amour have emphasized that Vietnam is an important economic and supply chain partner of the U.S."
16192,"According to the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (Vitas), the corporate honchos have stressed that the U.S. is best placed to provide the support needed to keep the supply chain going."
16193,"Vietnam ""is now the second largest supplier of apparel, footwear, and travel goods to the U.S. market."
16194,"Further, Vietnam has become a major supplier of crucial inputs for America‚Äôs small but important footwear manufacturing industry,"" the letter says, adding about 3 million U.S. workers are connected - through the value chains - to many millions more in Vietnam."
16195,"""The health of our industry is directly dependent on the health of Vietnam‚Äôs industry."""
16196,"The CEOs have asked President Biden to accelerate the donation of vaccines and other materials to help keep Vietnam on a strong footing so it can quickly recover, noting that the crisis of their employees in Vietnam is also their crisis."
16197,"On August 10, representatives of Vitas and the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association (Lefaso) had a meeting with the CEOs on how to procure more vaccines and resume production."
16198,"Vitas also hoped that the ""health"" of the supply chain between Vietnam and the U.S. will be discussed in the upcoming trip of Vice President Kamala Harris to Vietnam later this month, so solutions to protect the supply chain can be implemented in September."
16199,"Last month, the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA) requested the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to speed up the distribution of vaccines to major suppliers of Adidas, Gap, and other brands."
16200,The U.S. has so far given 5 million doses of Moderna vaccines to Vietnam through the glocal vaccine mechanism Covax.
16201,"Vietnam so far has received 19 million doses of Covid -19 vaccine from the deal with VNVC, the global vaccine access mechanism Covax, and as support from other countries."
16202,"This includes 11.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, 12,000 doses of Sputnik V, 746,000 doses of Pfizer, more than 5 million doses of Moderna, and 1.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccine."
16203,Around 12.5 million of the country‚Äôs 96 million people have got at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine.
16204,More than 1.3 million people have been fully vaccinated with two shots.
16205,I felt similarly about being 32.
16206,"Odds in my favor, not a big partier anymore‚Ä¶ still have a long life ahead of me once this pandemic ends."
16207,"In fact, I traveled and worked abroad so much in 2019 that I told my girlfriend that December ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to stay home all of 2020.‚Äù I guess the universe agreed."
16208,A majority of the unvaccinated are Republican.
16209,Charging them would be just a mild taste of the healthcare they want.
16210,Might even change their minds.
16211,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unvaccinated-america-in-5-charts/
16212,&gt; Where does that stop though?
16213,"Well, if you are asking my personal opinion I would say it stops when we get the pandemic under control or when hospitals are no longer in danger of being overwhelmed."
16214,It's punishing people for being poor.

16217,He‚Äôs not stupid - that‚Äôs the scariest part.
16218,I don‚Äôt understand how Republicans are not seeing that the majority of people dying right now are from their own party.
16219,Don‚Äôt they want their constituents to live and vote for them?
16220,It‚Äôll be interesting.
16221,You have 30-40% of the population (still 100m+ people) actively defying orders.
16222,"It will be much, much worse this year since everything‚Äôs open and these people are dead set on proving their point."
16223,"&gt; if you really were sick, that would be higher priority than reproduction

There are lots of reports of early menstruation after vaccination, but a CDC review of v-safe data did not see an increased risk of miscarriage after vaccination - see preprint here: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-798175/v1

so the immune system - reproductive system signalling is probably more like ""if you're not already pregnant, this month is not a good time for it."""

16297,"Published on the 9th, things have changed since."
16298,"H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî HCM City, the current COVID-19 epicentre of Vi·ªát Nam, will extend its strict social distancing measures for another month until September 15 given the risk of a resurgence, Phan VƒÉn M√£i, vice secretary of the city's Party Committee, said on Sunday."
16299,"Speaking at a meeting to receive goods and necessities for people affected by the pandemic in HCM City, M√£i said the pandemic could become more severe if the city relaxes its vigilance."
16300,"‚ÄúTherefore, it‚Äôs essential that social distancing be applied to reduce the number of new cases and gradually bring the city to a 'new normal' state"", he said."
16301,"In order to do so, people's awareness is the most important factor, he emphasised."
16302,M√£i said the city has gone 80 days since the fourth wave of infections broke out with the Delta mutation.
16303,"The period of social distancing, especially the five weeks of tightening Government‚Äôs Directive 16, were ""unprecedentedly difficult"" days for the political system and people."
16304,"The city has made great efforts to control outbreaks and infection chains, removing hundreds of locked down areas, promoting control of red zones, as well as expanding green zones."
16305,"The health sector also cured more than 70,000 people and administered vaccines for over 4.5 million people."
16306,"With the spirit of making all efforts to take care of people, the city has tried its best to reduce difficulties, while ensuring the supply of goods and issuing support packages."
16307,M√£i said the pandemic in HCM City has been partially controlled but is still very complicated; the number of infections is still high; the treatment system is overloaded and its operation is not synchronous.
16308,The process of receiving and treating COVID-19 cases is sometimes not efficient and the death rate has not decreased.
16309,"He said the Government‚Äôs requirement to control the pandemic by September 15 is challenging, but it was the common desire of the people."
16310,"Leaders of the city affirmed maximum priority towards pandemic prevention, while putting the health and life of the people first and foremost."
16311,"To achieve this goal, M√£i said HCM City will focus on implementing four main tasks."
16312,"The first is to thoroughly apply social distancing, limiting the source of infection, each person and each household must strictly comply with the requirements of social distancing and the 5K message."
16313,"""The pathogen remains widespread in the community, close contacts make it more easy to spread, and that could be very dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions,‚Äù he said."
16314,"Secondly, the city takes good care of people's lives in the coming days of social distancing, ensuring people‚Äôs needs for goods and necessities are met."
16315,"The city will mobilise all possible resources to deploy welfare packages for the poor, elderly people who live alone, freelance workers who lost their jobs, to ensure the basic life of people until they return to a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù life."
16316,"Third, the city will focus on effective treatment strategies, reducing mortality."
16317,"The city is expanding the number of hospitals and treatment facilities to meet the needs of emergency, oxygen support, medical care and deploying F0 home treatment."
16318,"Fourth, the city is speeding up vaccination to achieve herd immunity."
16319,"However M√£i emphasised that even when the vaccination rate is high, implementing the 5K message is still a requirement."
16320,"The need to impose social distancing for one more month was also noted earlier on Saturday by Secretary of HCM Party Committee Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn N√™n at a conference about assessment of pandemic prevention and control results after two weeks of implementing Directive 12, issued by the HCM City Party Committee's Standing Commission on strengthening several measures to implement the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in HCM City."
16321,The city has implemented the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 on social distancing rules since July 9 and started to impose even more restrictions from July 24 to contain spread of the virus.
16322,"On July 23, the Municipal People's Committee decided to extend the application of social distancing measures until August 1."
16323,"On August 1, the city issued a decision on imposing city-wide social distancing measures under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 for an additional 14 days from 0:00 on August 2."

16325,Here's the first google result from 'vaccine delta effectiveness'.
16326,The gist is the vaccines take about a 5%-8% effectiveness hit for Delta compared to the original strain.
16327,"After two doses, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine drops from 93.7% to 88%."
16328,"For the adenovirus vaccine (I believe that's the J&amp;J one), effectiveness went from 74.5% to 67%."
16329,The numbers I referenced before must not have included the adenovirus vaccines.
16330,People that got those vaccines will probably have to get a booster sooner than later.

16347,The doses used are part of the first shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese vaccine that were imported by HCM City-based Sapharco under the sponsorship of the private group V·∫°n Th·ªãnh Ph√°t and delivered to the southern city last month.
16348,"Another one million doses of the 5-million-doses contract arrived at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t International Airport on Saturday, pending quality controls before being administered."
16349,The department also said that two districts including Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n and C·∫ßn Gi·ªù had completed the first dose vaccination for people over 18 years old.
16350,"Specifically, Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n District has a vaccination rate of 152,387 out of 163,961 people, reaching 92.94 per cent of the population."
16351,"C·∫ßn Gi·ªù District has vaccinated 54,130 people, reaching 97.3 per cent."
16352,"The district has more than 71,000 people, of which those over 18 years old number more than 59,000."
16353,Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Xu√¢n H·∫£i and her son had the vaccination at the An H·ªôi Primary School in G√≤ V·∫•p District in an excited mood.
16354,"""Before getting the injection, I was told that I was to be vaccinated with Vero Cell vaccine, but I was not worried."
16355,"I think any type of vaccine is fine as long as the disease could be prevented, and the sooner is the better."
16356,The doctor here enthusiastically consulted us about the vaccination and I felt even more reassured.
16357,"After the injection, I feel that I am still healthy,"" said H·∫£i."
16358,"Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng S∆°n, 55, in G√≤ V·∫•p District, said he was advised by the medical staff about the type of vaccine being injected."
16359,"Believing in the State, he did not hesitate and signed to agree to receive the Vero Cell vaccine."
16360,"Nguy·ªÖn H·ªìng L√¢m, deputy chairman of the Ward 12 People‚Äôs Committee in G√≤ V·∫•p District, said the ward had given clear information about the vaccine and injection work to local residents."
16361,All of the injection sites were organised well to ensure security and preventive measures.
16362,"HCM City's officials have said that the injection of the vaccines are voluntary and all vaccination sites communicate clearly with the people about the vaccine being offered, amid some hesitancy against the Chinese vaccine, despite it having been approved by WHO and the Vietnamese health ministry."
16363,"On Friday, for example, a video clip circulating online showed people leaving a vaccination site on Huy·ªÅn Tr√¢n C√¥ng Ch√∫a Street, District 1, HCM City, after being told by health workers that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and only Sinopharm vaccines were left, on the first day of the 1 million shipment being rolled out."
16364,HCM City's representative said they are aware of the incident but the administration of Chinese vaccine still continued at the site throughout the day.
16365,"17,916 doses of Sinopharm's vaccine were administered on Friday, according to the city's health authorities."
16366,"To date, Vi·ªát Nam has received 2.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines, with the 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government in June reserved for people in border areas neighbouring China, Chinese nationals in Vi·ªát Nam, and people who wish to go to China for trade, studying or work, as well as those who have the need for the vaccine."
16367,"HCM City is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spots with healthcare system straining to deal with the large caseload, and amid global shortage, the city is quickly running out of vaccines to give to its residents."

16566,Gross oversimplification.
16567,Definitely some have access issues and legitimate hesitancy particularly from a historical perspective but it‚Äôs not universal.
16568,"Counterpoint - if all it took was education and access, medical professionals should have essentially universal vaccine coverage and be the biggest proponents of vaccines (because they literally work in a place with vaccines and theoretically are ‚Äúeducated‚Äù about them) but there are significant rates of vaccine refusal there although it is likely most strongly dependent on region, particularly in the US."
16569,For example Houston Methodist just fired over a hundred workers over this.
16570,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/06/22/us/houston-methodist-employees-covid-vaccine-resign-fired/index.html

Also nurse hesitancy seems to be a more common problem that there seems to have been little concerted effort to dismiss:
Survey from American Academy of Family Practitioners on hesitancy (at least initially): https://www.aafp.org/journals/fpm/blogs/inpractice/entry/countering_vaccine_hesitancy.html
A Kaiser survey found higher nurse hesitancy than in the general population and an American Nurses foundation survey found 2/3 of nurses wouldn‚Äôt take the vaccine voluntarily (granted this was from last fall so obviously some more than that got it but still this reads as a giant flashing red sign)
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.myamericannurse.com/nurses-and-vaccine-hesitancy-references/amp/

I highly suspect hesitancy is much higher here in rural Texas, based on some insane comments from nurses here but I can‚Äôt provide empirical evidence on that."
16571,"Perhaps it would be easier to do targeted mandates for healthcare workers like what Houston Methodist did but at the end of the day, the most important thing to me is ensuring that it‚Äôs safe to take vulnerable family members to the doctor/hospital without the risk of picking up Covid from a healthcare professional and here the only way that that will happen is through insurance premiums."
16572,I went on a date with a girl recently who said she wasn‚Äôt vaccinated (at the end of the date) I asked her why and she said covid had a death rate of 0.02% and the flu had a higher mortality rate.
16573,I told her even if that were true that there‚Äôs collateral damage and than morbidity matters too not just mortality.
16574,You can‚Äôt get through to these people it‚Äôs staggering.
16575,"No, it wasn't wrong."
16576,You weighed the risks and made the choice you thought was best for your kid.
16577,"IMO, it was a good choice; nothing magic happens on their 12th birthday."
16578,"And there's nothing ""every man for themselves"" about it."
16579,"Every extra vaccinated person helps slow the spread, and there are plenty of vaccines available for anyone that wants them."
16580,"In the UK, smokers pay over ¬£10 for 20 cig, they pay plenty of tax."
16581,"There‚Äôs a lot of tax on alcohol too, so at least they are contributing, and arguably far more than I am as a non smoker who rarely drinks alcohol."
16582,Regarding sports injuries.
16583,"I assume the reduction in healthcare costs bought about by people being fit and health playing sports mitigates the one off injuries that a small percentage suffer highly infrequently, when you take a holistic view."
16584,"Regarding weight related issues, that‚Äôs much more tricky."
16585,"Personally, I see them as / mental health/self harm issues to an extent in a lot of cases."
16586,"Also, unlike smoking and drinking alcohol, you can‚Äôt go without food so if you have a problem with eating you literally have to still do it to survive, which makes it much harder to control."
16587,"It‚Äôs like if we all had to drink alcohol (I know alcoholics can reach a stage where stopping is dangerous but I hope you realise it‚Äôs not the same thing as, ultimately, they can live without it) or we had to smoke some cigarettes to live."
16588,"Anitvaxxers might come under the mental illness group too, I supposed, in a way, but not in the same way as I‚Äôm referring to for the overweight."

16714,"Experts are now warning that Lambda, which is already here, has developed at least some vaccine resistance."
16715,"It‚Äôs my personal opinion that if we really want to eradicate this shit we‚Äôre going to have to do a hard closing of the borders(both Delta and Lambda wouldn‚Äôt be here right now if we did this), possibly mandate the vax(assuming it still provides at least some benefit for these up and coming/future strains), and enforce an insane fucking lockdown that not many people in this country will be happy with."

16894,it‚Äôs not fair to those who have gotten vaccinated.
16895,Hmm.
16896,Interesting.
16897,The downside to that is that it won't be obvious to someone when there are variants that have been named but haven't gotten a lot of attention.

16906,"There are lots things we could and should be doing:

**Ventilation and indoor air quality**

* The transmission rate outdoors is at least 20 times lower, probably more - the outdoors has an outstanding ‚Äúventilation system‚Äù."
16907,This suggests that that there‚Äôs *huge* room for reduction in transmission indoors by improving ventilation and air filtering.
16908,So: make a massive push to upgrade ventilation systems.
16909,"We could start by distributing large numbers of portable CO2 monitors to the public, since that will make the variation in indoor air quality much more visible to the public."
16910,"That could be beneficial even before many places have improved ventilation: your group could walk into a restaurant, check your C02 monitor, and say, ‚ÄúSorry, your restaurant seems really nice and we‚Äôve read great reviews, but you *really* need to upgrade your ventilation system."
16911,We‚Äôll be happy to give you another chance once you‚Äôve announced the upgrade on your website‚Äù.
16912,"**Better Masks**

* Why are we still using cloth masks?"
16913,"That recommendation was made when a much less dangerous version of the virus was prevalent, and there was a very limited supply of N95 masks, or even basic medical masks."
16914,"Now we‚Äôre facing Delta, and we no longer have a limited supply of high quality masks."
16915,Using outstandingly effective masks instead seems like a no brainer.
16916,"**Better Vaccines, More Vaccines**

* We‚Äôre still using the same vaccine recipe from one and a half years ago, against the original Wuhan variant."
16917,"Trials for an updated recipe tailored to Delta are either already underway, or will start soon."
16918,"Let‚Äôs get moving on that, chop chop."

16924,"* We‚Äôre only on version 1.0.of the mRNA vaccine platform, next generation versions could be *significantly* more effective."
16925,"* Have we tested whether giving third dose of the original recipe, an appropriate length of time after the second, could get us back to the level of protection we had against the original strain?"
16926,That would be fanstastic!
16927,"But wait, much of the world hasn‚Äôt been able to get even one dose yet!"
16928,"That means we need to:

**Vaccinate the Whole F\*\*\*\*\*\* World**

* We say ‚Äúno-one is safe until all of us are safe‚Äù, but we‚Äôre not acting like we believe that."
16929,"If we can drastically reduce transmission worldwide, we would expect to see new variants far less frequently, so the situation would be much more manageable."

16999,"(As I understand that there has been progress there; not just having a white male doctor come over and say ""do this"", but that is a component)."
17000,"The only question I have is what to do about people who are rabidly pursuing, and proselyting, dangerous behavior."
17001,This includes but isn't limited to anti-vax for covid.
17002,Is there anything we can do about those who aren't just refusing to believe but actually spreading the info?
17003,I'm guessing not as it's a real Gordian knot.
17004,"I still wish I could do something to help the healthcare professionals who have to deal with the repercussions of people so ardent about not taking things seriously, and then what happens afterwards."
17005,"States like Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida et al right now, for example."

17009,There‚Äôs not really a reason to assume this pandemic will behave exactly like the 1918 pandemic when the world is so different (including vaccine technology) and the viruses themselves are quite different.
17010,"There may be some analogs, but there will also be many differences."
17011,Today you should learn that most of the world does not have free at point of care health systems.
17012,"I was listening to This Week in Virology podcast yesterday and one of the hosts was saying that since the point of vaccination is to prevent hospitalization and death, counting infections is the wrong metric."
17013,"Covid isn't going away, that much is clear, so for now, it's more important to count what has the greatest impact on our resources."
17014,"Now, that is less persuasive in low vaccination areas, but overall the fight against infection in the US is lost."
17015,Good.
17016,Get rid of these idiots before they kill someone.
17017,"I can‚Äôt believe how stupid some nurses are, and these are no exception."
17018,"Thank you, we'll be getting that device tomorrow"
17019,Not throughout Europe.
17020,Most countries have a copay of sorts for care.
17021,"Typically it‚Äôs modest, but true free at point of care health systems are very rare."
17022,Wrong.

17026,"Absolutely, we're back to my first comment."
17027,I agree
17028,Because my 5 year old niece is being forced back to school and cannot be vaccinated.
17029,"Anti vaxxers threaten her, and countless others who cannot be vaccinated"
17030,100% true.
17031,"Tennessee, drove across I24 in February, no salt on the roads which were covered in black ice."
17032,There was an accident every 3 miles clear through to Nashville.
17033,Most in the world do not receive 100% free at point of service healthcare.
17034,That is not true.
17035,You can find people making unreasonable arguments against vaccines everywhere.
17036,"I'm not denying that medical conditions can make it so you can't get vaccinated (I know that a few of my friends and my mother can't), but it's definitely a majority who can and don't want to (anti vaxxers)"
17037,I thought about this comparison as well and it breaks down because the difference is *knowingly* spreading HIV/AIDS.
17038,"With COVID, much of the spread is unknowingly due to asymptomatic spread."

17044,*
17045,"First check his oxygen level, if its above 93 he will be fine."
17046,Correct.
17047,"You said:

&gt; Aren‚Äôt you more likely to take the sicker one because they need more help?"
17048,"I said:

&gt; Not that simple

Because it isn't as simple as taking the sicker person."
17049,"To show this, I gave a sample calculation of it *not* going the way you said."
17050,Nowhere did I imply that it was anything other than an example with made up numbers.
17051,"It can obviously go either way, and it depends on the difference in likelihood of surviving with and without hospitalization."
17052,Uh everyone should??
17053,?
17054,"why frame it in ""political"" terms?"
17055,We aren't a country that's ever going to get universal health coverage in our lifetime.
17056,There's no mandate from the public for this.
17057,"So at this point, coverage for certain conditions isn't an issue for the right or the left, but rather what's feasible and desirable by the vast majority of citizens."
17058,"For example, we still don't cover nursing homes for those needing assisted living due to dementia and Alzheimer's and Parkinsons."
17059,"Medicare doesn't pay for assisted living, only medical procedures."
17060,But that's a line in the sand we've drawn as a public body.
17061,"It's kind of a death sentence for the immunocompromised and elderly, and we'll have more than 700,000 deaths in the US alone soon."
17062,That's not to account for the long-term costs of taking care of those who survive or providing care in ICUs and hospitals to the dying.
17063,"I don't watch any TV/media, so I'm not sure that's a good universal explanation, and you demonstrated earlier in this thread that your own reading comprehension was suspect as you called the figure in the article a lie, then admitted you were wrong."
17064,I still haven't heard an explanation of why you're afraid of wearing a mask indoors or getting vaccinated to help control a deadly virus shutting down most of the world.
17065,"The only one living in fear is you, you're afraid of masks and vaccines like some weird caveman seeing technology for the first time."
17066,It's not the principle police.
17067,"It's standard of practice, nursing, healthcare."
17068,"Poor people, POC already habe enough disparity without a bunch of middle class/rich largely white people creating more discrimination for them."
17069,More power meaning they will add more things that will not be covered.
17070,Literally more money in their pockets.
17071,"It will end up impacting vaccinated people for example, all people actually."
17072,And apparently it‚Äôs what people like you want.
17073,How is that not giving them more power?
17074,"I promise you, if you are coming to America, you want the vaccine."
17075,Please.
17076,We are burning ourselves alive at the stake here.
17077,[removed]
17078,You're correct and because of that people who are vaccinated and share the same insurance with people who are not vaccinated are probably going to have their insurance go up.
17079,Doesn't limit what employers can do.
17080,"Employers already have health programs with tiers for discounts, just add one more tier like smoking for the Covid vaccine."
17081,Will hit the unvaccinated and in the pocketbook and hopefully sway them to get it.
17082,"But some things you have to smell, like a gas leak or your house on fire"
17083,This article is from last year.

17086,"I am against denying care, period."
17087,"But, obesity is a bad comparison here, one, obesity isn‚Äôt contagious."
17088,I‚Äôm not going to catch obesity while shopping.
17089,"Also, if obesity was as easy to prevent as getting 2 shots, a lot more people would be supermodel skinny."
17090,"It's quite mesmerizing to see what's happening in US, from outside world."
17091,"First, Trump was totally out of my understanding why he was so out of it yet had so many supporters, and now this."
17092,"If any of them had any decency in them, they would ensure their supporter's and their family's safety."
17093,But it almost look like they are treating people as collateral damage for their political gain.
17094,Sad that those who support them cannot see what's happening.
17095,So your OP is kinda spreading misinformation then.
17096,And that is what is concerning in these comments.
17097,Are hospitalization in kids (under 18 from covid) going up from previous weeks?
17098,"Yes, still not as much as the January peak though."
17099,Hopefully because at least some parents had sense to vaccinate their 12-17 year olds.
17100,"PICUs are getting full, but not because more ineligible for vaccination children are dying of covid."
17101,They are however not getting the care they need overall.
17102,Lack of staff and RSV are really complicating things.
17103,"But the media needs clicks so ""all our kids are dying of covid"" seems to be the current fear spreading money generators as parents get ready to send kids to school."
17104,We have all that here and also have to pay out the ass or go bankrupt from medical debt.
17105,It took me 3 months to see my GI doctor via zoom so I could renew RX‚Äôs and I have some of the best insurance in the US.
17106,&gt; I agree with you both but what is stopping it from getting just as bad as Florida?
17107,"Mask mandates, social distancing measures and in extreme cases lockdowns can actually be implemented in states without actively malicious governors."
17108,This greatly reduces the likelihood of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed as we are seeing in Florida and certain other states.
17109,"As a result, the death rate as a percentage of infections can be kept far lower than what we are expecting to see from Florida."
17110,"TL:DR: Maybe still lots of Covid, but less dead people due to a functioning healthcare system."
17111,"Everyone pays for hospital bills, vaxed or not."
17112,At least in this country.
17113,If anti-vaxers don‚Äôt believe in the science of the vaccine then why should they trust doctors and nurses at the hospital when they seek care?
17114,They should be sent home if there are no beds.
17115,Not sorry.
17116,This article is borderline misleading by not even mentioning these numbers.
17117,[removed]
17118,And your ER nurse family member is seeing a fraction of how many people who received the vaccine with no side effects?
17119,"You‚Äôre hearing ‚Äúthe worst‚Äù stories, not the normal."
17120,Does she talk to you about the people that aren‚Äôt intubated that are dying?
17121,Does that scare you?
17122,?
17123,"Is it heartless of me to say we should have free healthcare, but if you get lung cancer and are a smoker or liver cancer for a drinker then you have to pay like the system we're (US) currently in?"

17127,How is it giving them more power than they have?
17128,If our goal is to continue the failed model of ‚Äúregulated‚Äù insurance to the point where we say exactly how the insurance companies must operate ... why do they exist?!
17129,?
17130,It is against the [ACA](https://www.cigna.com/employers-brokers/insights/informed-on-reform/market-rules-under-aca) to do this.
17131,Actuaries set prices based on average risk and cannot set different rates for different policy holders based on individual risk.
17132,&gt;Insurers cannot use separate risk pools to charge certain policyholders higher rates.
17133,I know that.
17134,Try telling anti vaxxers that.
17135,They won't listen.

17146,"Everyone keeps using this word ""romanticization"" which is what I take issue with."
17147,"""Romanticization"" implies people aren't facing facts or reality."
17148,We can't even get 50% vaccination rates in parts of this country.
17149,Would getting 70% vaccination rate be romantic?
17150,"Only in this country is that notion considered ""romantic""."
17151,Keep in mind about 2.7% of US adults are immunocompromised ... and are probably way over-represented in that 5%
17152,We don't need unvaxd nurses.
17153,They're disease carriers that will kill people.

17157,The idea of people knowingly and purposefully bringing school age kids to a plague hotspot just blows my fucking mind.
17158,"I visited Texas earlier this year with my 6 year old, when Texas and Illinois had roughly the same vaccine rates."
17159,"We mostly stayed at home with my sister or went to friends homes who are vaccinated AND work from home, or did outdoor activities."

17165,All covid discussion is locked in a daily stickied thread that is rarely remade and only allows top comments of news articles.

17167,Yes.

17178,Is there any official info from Pfizer that this can be confirmed?
17179,"Any reputable study will do post-tests to measure whether unequal sample sizes have biased the results, although that's rarely an issue unless you're doing a simple t-test in my experience."
17180,"Eh, it‚Äôs always been the inmates."
17181,Yup.
17182,"If you deny anti-vaxxers covid treatment, then what about denying smokers lung cancer treatment, drinkers liver cancer treatment, people who drink too many soft drinks diabetes treatment, people who don't use sun screen skin cancer treatment, treatment to people that got into car accidents while driving over the speed limit, cyclists who got a concussion while biking without a helmet... it's just way too much of a slippery slope."
17183,I know but this article is about the UK where life is almost back to pre-pandemic levels.
17184,They're a lobby group for the insurance companies.
17185,So not a credible source.

17187,"Disclaimer: I'm strongly in favor of single-payer healthcare in the U.S.

That said, romanticization is a pitfall on the American left."
17188,Shifting to a single-payer system isn't going to usher in a utopia of perfectly equitable care of the highest modern standards for everyone.
17189,"It's just going to change the billing structure, and could actually decrease standard of care over the near or medium term (e.g., U.S. cancer treatment is absolutely world-class and cutting-edge \*because\* it is expensive)."
17190,"Meanwhile, the American left does have a habit of pretending that, like, Cuban third-world healthcare is the gold standard."

17199,"It won‚Äôt be hard for them to get other patient care jobs, but that shouldn‚Äôt be an option."
17200,"I absolutely do not admit that a virus that has been around for years and years, that has not only treatments but vaccines to prevent severe illness in high risk infants and kids (you were incorrect to assume that I'd never heard of RSV but I'll ""bet"" that you've never heard of Synagis), is the same as Covid."
17201,My youngest got pretty sick with RSV at 4 months old.
17202,Then she got better.
17203,"She didn't develop ""long RSV"" because that's not a thing, unlike Covid."
17204,"She didn't develop a life threatening inflammatory illness several weeks after recovering from RSV because that's not a thing, unlike Covid."
17205,"And we don't even know what may be in store down the line for Covid patients because AGAIN, unlike Covid, RSV is not a NOVEL virus."

17213,Huge majority of your country isn't anti vax
17214,"There's way too much nuance regarding vaccines, spread, and breakthrough infections to know the exact answers."
17215,"Vaccines reduce, but don't prevent people's chances of infection."
17216,"However, those vaccinated individuals that do get infected can become vectors for spread so vaccines aren't a silver bullet and their effectiveness wanes over time as we're finding."
17217,This doesn't mean they don't work--they work very well for preventing severe outcomes.
17218,We are likely saving 1000+  lives per day in the US at this point because of them.
17219,"Based on this, you can assume that more vaccinated regions will have a less severe wave but to assume they won't have a wave is short-sighted."

17225,"It's going to become ""endemic"" like the flu, except way deadlier."
17226,In the West (and East Asia) we'll see decreasing severity of waves over the coming years as we get more &amp; more of our populations vaccinated.
17227,But there's an increasing realization that we need to expand our health care corps to deal with continuous floods of covid patients that will be coming through hospital doors.

17356,Take the below advice with the same skepticism you should from any internet stranger.
17357,I have heard that the way to do it is like this: Go to the pharmacy website (one with three letters has been asking very few questions) and sign up for the shot putting the birth date that makes your kid 12 and maybe a few days or a week past their birthday.
17358,"Then you get the kid to memorize their ""age"" and their ""birth date."""

17432,The US and Europe have not had the manufacturing capacity of china and India wrt to pharmaceuticals for decades.
17433,So comparing the export amount between nations is an invalid metric in this case.
17434,A million doses exported from the US or Europe is much more significant than a million doses exported from china (whom manufacturers at a much higher rate courtesy of western investment and outsourcing over the last few decades).

17440,"Go ahead and take a look at their actions in west Africa over the last 20 years and you will, hopefully, understand."
17441,China is being generous with their less effective vaccine now because they seek access to the resources of third world countries in the future.
17442,"Exactly the same as what happened when they ""invested"" in African infrastructure only to gain access to valuable mineral deposits."
17443,The mines that china won access to as a result are extremely destructive to the environment and benefit few people in the area that is being absolutely destroyed (the mines are operated by chinese workers and the ore exported to china).

17586,Thanks!!
17587,!
17588,It's tempting but no.
17589,That would just be petty.
17590,"(I assume we are talking about a place with universal healthcare, like Canada)

A person is vastly stupid for not getting vaccinated, but if we start using stupidity as a reason for someone having to pay instead...it's not gonna go over well."
17591,Good.
17592,Your question is extremely unethical
17593,^ This.
17594,"Don't deny care, but prioritize the vaccinated over the unvaccinated."
17595,"Set up hospice wards for unvaccinated individuals with minimal care (pain mitigation, etc.)"
17596,and keep full-service ICUs open for people who did their civic duty.
17597,I wouldn‚Äôt do that.
17598,Pretty sure that‚Äôs assault.
17599,‚ÄúIs breaking‚Äù lol this shits been broken
17600,"Another conspiracy theory rises, Phizer started Covid-19."
17601,"But not to make money of a vaccine, to make money of Mrs for ED, shit just got out of hand."
17602,"When you look at the CDC numbers, most of these children are 12-17 and should be vaccinated."
17603,These are unnecessary hospitalizations and the small percentage that are under 12 should be getting proper care.
17604,My friend's spouse is a doctor at one of those small hospitals without an ICU in rural TX.
17605,People coming in for car wrecks and other non-COVID issues are dying because they can't find any hospitals to take critical patients.
17606,These are the COVID collateral that won't be counted in the final death toll but may have survived if not for COVID.
17607,If you don't have to wear a mask you should not be mandated to wear a shirt or shoes either.
17608,God this is so stupid.
17609,Wait what?
17610,That‚Äôs not how this works
17611,"Only if smokers pay for theirs, drug addicts pay for their, aggressive drivers pay for theirs, ect ect ect."

17614,"Normally I'd agree, but at this point we need something to make pro-diseasers change their stance and this could be it."
17615,Trust the data
17616,We dont have to do that.
17617,That's an extreme case scenario.
17618,"All we have to do, is to make the lives of unvaccinated people miserable."
17619,Require frequent testing.
17620,Prohibit entry to social events.
17621,Require social distancing and masks for them exclusively.
17622,"Even if all this took place at the high school, college, and work level, it would immediately cause a lot more people to get the jab."
17623,An unvaccinated person right now can lead pretty much same life as a vaccinated person.
17624,"Thus, they do not see the consequences of their choice."
17625,We need to have such consequences.
17626,Unfortunately Biden can't do anything but make suggestions.
17627,It's up to the governors.
17628,And do you think any of them would shut down?
17629,Mississippi's governor said they are wide open.
17630,I'm not moving shit.
17631,The global warming was an example of the exact same shit.
17632,"Poorer countries are all perfectly capable of handling this, since clearly they fricken did."
17633,It's the wealthy ones that are the biggest losers.
17634,They had all the resources in the world to prevent covid spreading in their borders and they welcomed it with open arms.
17635,"That first point is interesting, I hadn't seen data that bad for hospitalization yet on the mRNA ones."
17636,"And your second point is exciting, definitely looking forward to the results of that study, I hadn't realized there would be one that should get results that soon!"
17637,It was the first major use of longer range rifled weapons (or rifled bullets - Minnie balls) and seige style warfare that made most close infantry tactics of the day irrelevant.
17638,But not obese people ‚Ä¶ weird
17639,It‚Äôs really only nuanced at the extreme edges of probability.
17640,If your risk of getting Covid is EXTREMELY low then it may not be worth it to get the vaccine.
17641,If you actually live in society and interact with any other people then your risk of a bad outcome from Covid is almost certainly higher than the risk of a bad outcome from the vaccine.
17642,"You bring up that the vaccine may not stop you from getting covid but that‚Äôs not the point, it almost certainly will keep you alive if you do get it."
17643,If you have preexisting conditions that may make you more likely to have complications from the vaccine you‚Äôre almost certainly very likely to have bad complications with Covid.
17644,"The only scenario where going unvacced is better for you is if you‚Äôre almost certain (like over 99% certain) to not get Covid, which is not likely to be the case right now."

17659,&gt; In general I'm against the idea that people should be forced to pay full price when they are already paying for insurance.

17661,"This would not be a step towards a better healthcare system where people don't have to declare bankruptcy, open a gofundme, or simply just die because of the unaffordability of life saving care."

17710,What you seem to be lacking is even a small portion of common sense.

17712,"So yes, you have a higher probability of having a bad outcome when placed in the care of an inexperienced individual vs a seasoned pro."
17713,You just don't seem capable of coming to that conclusion for whatever reason in your myopic argument
17714,It depends.
17715,I believe the CARES Act also allows for some payment of COVID treatment for uninsured patients.
17716,"Also, some insurance plans (not ALL), cover treatment at no cost to patients."

17908,I agree.
17909,People who should have got vaccinated are stupid for not taking care of their bodies.

17918,"It might make one cycle a little off, but the effect is temporary."
17919,"Vaccines basically ‚Äútrick‚Äù your immune system into thinking you have a virus, and since if you really were sick, that would be higher priority than reproduction, then it might be a little early or late depending where you are in your cycle."

17930,It takes time for the virus to get a foothold enough for exponential increase to start.
17931,The southern states are more lax in their countermeasures and people are indoors unmasked more.
17932,The north is starting to see some surge.
17933,I think it won‚Äôt be as drastic as southern states but will still happen.
17934,I disagree.
17935,"If you make the active choice to not trust the vaccine, then you obviously don't trust medical science."

17955,No.
17956,No one should pay out of pocket for hospital bills.
17957,Period.
17958,Looooooooooooool
17959,I don't think that comparison works here.
17960,Antivaxxers deny that COVID-19 exists at all and that they cannot get hospitalized because of it.
17961,If they do they should pay themselves.
17962,Yeah but its a numbers game.
17963,"In the form of higher premiums, maybe significantly higher premiums for the time being."
17964,"They are willingly and severely increasing the odds of having a serious medical event, and their rates should reflect that."

17969,"Actually the provider of the shot is allowed to bill insurance for the administration of the dose, just not the dose itself."

17973,The newest data shows vaccinated people are 70% less likely than unvaccinated to transmit the virus.
17974,Vaccinated people are 90% less likely to become infected.
17975,That's all I need to know.

17978,I am seeing a lot of stuff where experts are predicting a surge in the northern states.
17979,Could someone explain why it is not currently happening?
17980,"All you'd have to do to get around it is print out a fake on cardstock and make it recent enough for you to say ""huh I guess it's not up yet."""
17981,Either way it's a moot point; doctors and nurses would never do this.
17982,"As satisfying as it would be, there's too many people in bad family situations or other circumstances that might prevent someone."
17983,Part of the reason why it's so emotionally exhausting is because of how much empathy they have for suffering even when people do awful things to themselves.

17986,I wonder how much people sneakily getting booster shots is skewing vaccination numbers.
17987,I have to imagine it is at least a little.
17988,"Someone on CNN estimated that about a million people had gotten covid boosters without it being recommended, which from what I've seen here means they lied about it being their first shot."
17989,So that could be a million less vaccinated than we think.
17990,A vaccine primes your immune system to fight the virus it is not a magic cape of invincibility.
17991,The severity of your illness will be almost certainly be massively reduced if you are vaccinated so instead of the hospitals getting overwhelmed and lots of people that could have been saved ending up dying a vaccinated population won't get overwhelmed.
17992,The vaccine is saving a lot of lives.
17993,The vaccine doesn't cause blood clots.
17994,A few people did go to hospital with blood clots after receiving the vaccine but the numbers are inline with the number of people you would statistically expect to be going to hospital with blood clots.
17995,"Covid on the other hand cause massive problems, it does cause lots of blood clots, attacks the heart, brain, testicles and kidneys and causes lots of strokes, heart attacks and kidney failures."

18020,It‚Äôs my understanding that if you don‚Äôt have insurance then they still have to give you the shot but then they turn around and try to get the administration fee from the federal government.

18047,Friend and her family got breakthrough Covid too after Pfizer.
18048,We did OTC test so I made sure to call the health department to report.

18059,Not being vaccinated is not a pre-existing medical condition.
18060,It‚Äôs a life choice.
18061,Similar to how they can charge more if you choose to smoke.
18062,"Again, that‚Äôs their premiums, not necessarily their paycheck."
18063,Most people get paid twice monthly and their monthly premium is spread out over those two paychecks.
18064,They‚Äôre 2 different things.
18065,"Yes, they'll be forced to triage, part of triaging is not wasting time/resources on the unsaveable."
18066,"Treating the vaccinated person who will probably recover over the unvaccinated one that is much less likely to, isn't out of line with triage."
18067,Where I think they need to go a step farther (but I know they can't) is that they should be kicking the unvaccinated out of their bed if someone vaccinated needs it.
18068,The vaccinated shouldn't be died medical care in favor of someone who didn't even try to not need it.

18070,I think the ‚Äúendgame‚Äù for a lot of people means living with the virus‚Äîthe same way we live with the cold and flu.
18071,"With no obsessing over case counts, hospitalization stats, and deaths."
18072,"With no futzing about with asymptomatic positive tests, constantly worrying about the spread."
18073,"With going to a crowded concert, or working in person with other people, without fear of getting a case and maybe the office shutting down."

18084,Not sure if it'll help with covid or not but I'm happy with the results.

18102,"It has been talked about, and studied."
18103,"Vaccine antibodies are better at blocking multiple variants of the virus, while the one your body produced to fight that specific infection may be specialized to fight just that one variant."
18104,"Also, if you only had a mild case of covid, or if your immune system is weaker, or just randomly, your immune system might not ""remember"" as much as it should about covid after it finishes fighting it off, leaving you with a weaker resistance."
18105,"With vaccines, however, the same amount is given to everybody, and you get a more even immune response, and the same strong resistance between almost all people who get it."
18106,"So yes, recovering from mild covid could make you fully immune for the rest of your life, but it might not, just like getting the vaccine might not."
18107,"The difference is that the vaccine is much better at long term protection, and doesn't involve contracting a deadly illness that could kill you first."

18132,"Before someone responds with the viral load information, it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking."
18133,Because it's not immunity.
18134,Getting covid doesn't mean you can't get it again.
18135,Look at the golfer going into the last round of the US Open in May and getting pulled because of a positive test.
18136,"He recovered, tested negative, won the next big tournament, and then he went to Japan for the Olympics."
18137,At the Olympics he tested positive AGAIN.

18196,Honestly yeah.
18197,Any opening up of restrictions should be limited to vaxxed people.
18198,Anyone who isn't should at least still be required to wear a mask at the very least.
18199,Once the vaxx is available for all ages we can probably lose things up more for fully vaxxed people as well.
18200,One silver lining about all of this is that m rna vaccines are comparatively easy to produce so for future pandemics we should be able to make another vaccine.

18214,"&gt;The Rt in NY is not below 1 yet, but it's quickly headed there in the next two weeks, which means that what we're seeing in North Eastern places like NY right now is basically the 'worst' of it as far as Delta is concerned (it's essentially endemic for us.)"
18215,"Sure, a greater vaccinated % makes a difference."
18216,"But, even in NY, you still have less than 60% of the populace vaccinated (vs FL at 50%)."
18217,"Any way you slice it, that's a ton of vulnerable people out there and Delta is showing us that if you haven't been vaccinated, it's going to find you eventually."
18218,And I'm not at all saying that NYC going to see April 2020 or even Winter 2020 levels of strain on the healthcare system (because of the vaccines).

18235,"I am vaccinated but will also be getting a COVID PCR test prior to my flight, because I have no desire to bring Delta COVID to Germany."
18236,I am surprised that Germany isn‚Äôt requiring a negative test even for vaccinated people.

18303,"Given potential seroprevalence from the severity of the spring 2020 surge, duration of the November-March surge in the NE, and higher vax rates, is it still all but guaranteed that the northeast will get much worse, or could it be that this region will ultimately peak without experiencing the southern-like exponential surge?"

18333,Take it all with a huge grain of salt.
18334,How about any one that ends up in the hospital or uses the insurance pays more for it.
18335,And for those that are never using health care insurance cuz we stay healthy all year regardless of vax status get refunds on our premiums.
18336,This way those that use it pay more those that don't and stay fit and healthy here is a refund for your efforts.
18337,"The odds of getting covid and having a hospital worthy reaction is what 3, 4 %?"
18338,The odds on getting a major adverse vaccine reaction are higher than that and you have no idea what awful long term effects await you.

18348,Oh I see what you're saying about herd immunity.
18349,I think though between vaccines and natural infection it will run out of hosts...assuming both of those provide enough protection against reinfection from the same strain or a new one to not develop another surge.

18369,we are seeing that happen in real time.
18370,it's a huge reason-- maybe even *the* reason-- why covid outcomes are so much worse in the US than other countries.
18371,if obesity was strictly genetic it would be relatively consistent throughout time and would manifest more in certain populations than others.

18513,If the 'company' says it wants to up your rate for a lifestyle choice the onus is on you to find a different company that doesn't do that in a *'pretend free market with endless choices'* where you can shop for a better service.
18514,A free market libertarian capitalist would say the free market will create such a company that fits what you want but there's no reason for any company to if they all agree to do the same practice closing out that niche in the market for one to exist.
18515,That's also ignoring that most Americans can't afford health insurance that isn't connected to their workplace.
18516,So it's very rarely a choice you get to make of what coverage you get if the company doesn't want to pay for it.
18517,"Having said all that if we ever got M4A (which won't happen in my lifetime but should have years ago) this same proposal could also open the door to the government having exceptions for coverage based on your lifestyle habits, which should be fought tooth and nail by the taxpayers all paying into the services."
18518,"Obese people being required to pay for diabetes amputations, pregnant women being required to pay for pregnancy because it's a choice, cancer treatment not being paying outright if even a single thing in your lifestyle could be connected to the type of cancer you have, etc."
18519,"This shouldn't be allowed IN THE HYPOTHETICAL, MAGICAL FUTURE where we all have universal healthcare covered by our taxes like a normal nation for the same reason we shouldn't require people to pay fire departments out of pocket for having fireplaces in their home even if they already pay taxes for fire departments."
18520,If you pay into the system with your taxes you get the benefit of the government services.
18521,"Unfortunately, I've found all too often that people rarely see the loopholes in their logic that would hurt themselves in the future in such hypotheticals."
18522,"I'm firmly pro covid vaccination, I got vaccinated as soon was was literally possible, but I'm also firmly against this idea because insurance companies shouldn't have any more power over us than they currently have and a hypothetical universal healthcare system should limit the government's ability, in the extreme, against punishing people for lifestyle choices."
18523,"This is a case of patients purposely choosing to ignore medical advice, interventions, and all other means of improving their situation, and then still receiving very expensive medical care."
18524,"It‚Äôs certainly a grey area, but we currently do almost nothing to hold people financially accountable for healthcare choices and behaviors."
18525,"Auto insurance charges higher rates for poor driving, life insurance charges higher rates for age, smoking, etc."
18526,"We shouldn‚Äôt deny any medical care, but that‚Äôs a different argument than putting fiscal onus or greater costs for avoidable, preventable, or purposely-exacerbated conditions."
18527,The unvaccinated are largely in that category already.
18528,We‚Äôre talking primarily about poor uneducated people and minorities.

18576,I wonder if that person has the integrity to stand by their principles when their life is on the line.

18578,"We should pay for it
That said, I‚Äôm against letting them into the hospital if they opted out of the vaccine"

18596,I've heard a lot of good things about it.
18597,Would be interesting to see who the courts side with.
18598,I imagine the legality is largely irrelevant until someone sues and wins.
18599,Am I the only one that thinks it's profoundly stupid to have a lab dedicated to studying infectious diseases smack in the middle of a densely populated area?
18600,"These labs should be in incredibly remote areas, and preferably underground."
18601,The thing is they estimated 3 million people died there.
18602,While we have vaccine over here in US and people just rather die than get vaccinated.
18603,Doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a slope.
18604,Getting vaccinated for an illness or be expected to cover the costs for that illness is a pretty logical standard.
18605,"As long as standard exemptions are made, then what‚Äôs the issue?"
18606,Don‚Äôt like it?

18641,I went to a local farmers market here in OK and there were some people with signs about not turning OK into Portland and how Portland was a post apocalyptic mess (with crazy pics and cartoons).

18655,No one wants to open themselves up to lawsuits by freely admitting that conditions in hospitals are unsafe.
18656,I‚Äôve seen rural EMS  struggling even to transport patients.
18657,They are tied up on the wall or doing transfers that take 2 Liz hours one way.
18658,It‚Äôs very obvious that the people in charge have no idea how the healthcare system works.
18659,"If this evidence is true, push it to yhe front, it will absolutely catch a few of the idiots."

18682,"My taste is almost back, but my sense of smell is very weak"
18683,Reddit is having a hard time with this.
18684,The prevailing opinion began with masking being an altruistic act to protect everyone and affirm the sanctity of all lives.
18685,Then vaccinating became an act of love to protect those most vulnerable.
18686,"Once vaxed it was a passport to return to 2019, and it became our inalienable right to do so."
18687,"Now there are calls for leaving the unvaccinated to die in the streets, laughing when unvaccinated people die, mocking their deaths."
18688,It makes me wonder if any good intentions in the beginning weren‚Äôt just empty platitudes meant to manipulate people into serving a selfish agenda.

18723,"Okay okay, next question, Can I be so unhealthy or intoxicated that my body is uninhabitable to covid?"

18742,That is patently untrue.
18743,"I don't remember exactly what the heavily downvoted, now deleted, comment I replied to said, but he basically paraphrased that quote."
18744,You're looking at the wrong study.
18745,That was a pilot looking whether the virus was physically present in the tissue of the penis for patients who has previously contracted COVID and also had severe ED.
18746,(The samples were from patients coming in for prostheses or similar treatment) The fact that it was in both patients tested and the levels involved suggest it warrants further study.
18747,The one used for the graph had 100 participants: 25 COVID positive and 75 negative.
18748,"(Which is still small but, with that result size, statistically solid)

There are two other studies referenced by the article as well, all showing about the same results."
18749,That's what makes it news
18750,Our residents understand the value of the vaccine.

18752,Protonmail
18753,Of course it‚Äôs a good thing.
18754,"If they work in the medical field and don‚Äôt see the value of being vaccinated for themselves or their patients, they‚Äôre not exactly highly skilled or intelligent individuals are they?"
18755,"They‚Äôre part of the problem, not the solution."
18756,"If they can‚Äôt be trusted with something as simple as getting vaccinated during a pandemic, can‚Äôt assess the relative risks involved, why on earth should they be trusted to correctly administer the right dose of medicine or dress a wound properly?"
18757,This is a brilliant way to weed out those not up to the job.
18758,"I suspect that with nurses like that out of the picture, mistakes and poor care will drop."
18759,"In a funny sort of way, they‚Äôre doing a great thing for their patients by removing themselves from patient care."
18760,after ludicrous risk comes plaid risk.
18761,The first person I know to get covid was my obese roommate who worked as an essential worker.
18762,She described it as a bad flu and has not mentioned any persisting issues.
18763,I'd say mine was mild too but I have had problems (though diminishing over time) ever since.
18764,"However, I have athletic friends who said it was just the flu and my overweight aunt died from it."
18765,Just kind of amazing the differences of experience.
18766,They're next to Arizona.
18767,This reminds me of that graphic smoking warning label that used to be on packs showing the limp cigarette and the warning: Cigarettes Cause Impotence!
18768,I thought it was smart and would maybe be one of the bigger deterrents for men to stop smoking.
18769,"Look, I‚Äôm fully vaxxed, trying to provide you with good information, and absolutely exhausted by your bad faith arguments so I‚Äôm going to bed."

18771,"Yeah, the anti-vax campaign was started a while ago with ""autism advocacy"" groups headed by a doctor whose study was then retracted for providing false info, and there have been pockets of anti-vax in religious organizations, minorities who have been medically abused in large scales (like the Tuskegee syphilis studies), and fear-mongering."
18772,The only people I feel for are the formerly abused groups.
18773,"Ironically, vaccines are so good now that we've forgotten the horrors of diseases like polio, diptheria, and other deadly common causes of death pre-vaccines."
18774,It's not until those diseases start making the rounds again once herd immunity is breached by too many anti-vaxxers that we see people get scared about be pro-vaccine again.
18775,If they're not too stubborn.
18776,I'm flashing back to years ago when there was a measles outbreak at Disneyland because of unvaccinated kids.
18777,[removed]
18778,A 50% decease is a much bigger decrease than what you are making it out to be.
18779,Not only that...the CDC telling people who were vaccinated they no longer had to wear a mask and no checks on it.
18780,So unvaccinated people just ripped up that mask and it became a free for all.
18781,"No mandates on vaccinations, no employer was checking for vaccine cards, nothing."
18782,"My employer the day they said vaccinated people didn't have to wear masks, everyone threw away their mask like Covid was over and lifted all the restrictions."
18783,I have a problem with their method of finding breakthrough rate - the studies I see tend to take ALL vaccines and then figure in how many breakthroughs have happened.
18784,The issue is vaccines have been around a lot longer than breakthrough cases so it‚Äôs really a skewed number.
18785,"Still, vaccines work to prevent serious illness."
18786,I‚Äôm not denying their value.
18787,Insurance?
18788,Where do you live?
18789,The shot is free in the US.
18790,My insurance wasn't involved at all when getting my shot
18791,This I like!
18792,I know Australia has donated 2.5M AZ to Indonesia and 500K or so to Fiji and Papua as well.
18793,Did getting the vaccine reduce any of the symptoms ?
